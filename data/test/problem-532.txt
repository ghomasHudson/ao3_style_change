She picked through his fridge. “A mad bunch of hissing. Did you know I used to buy all your groceries?”
The next time she shifted the papers, she glanced over. Her eyes went wide when she saw he was awake. The papers slid off her lap and into the floor with a great rustling.
Hermione made a noise of desperate frustration, pulling her wand to cast a Stinging Hex. The journal fell out of his hands. He kicked it so hard it flew against the wall.
He sat Draco on the edge of it, glancing around. No personal effects. Those must all be in the parlor. “Are you hungry? Thirsty?”
“Certainly not mine.” Ron pushed up and rustled around the fridge for a minute, returning with a bottle of vinegar. “How was your trip, eh? Get the letter sent off?”
” A large, transparent bubble expanded from the tip of her wand, floating over to the snake and enclosing it. It twisted and hissed inside, but Harry could no longer hear it. “
Ron swayed his head side to side like a cobra, a wordless little dance of anticipation that made Harry laugh. “Alright. For appearances.”
It was quieter than Harry would have thought possible. Ron’s mother put a protective hand on his other arm, gripping tightly.
“I have strong magic,” he realized. Of course – he could do all sorts of wandless things. And only the night before, she had been telling him how extraordinary his Patronus charm was when he was only thirteen.
. And it wasn’t particularly funny, but Harry laughed anyway. Like everyone else, Draco seemed shocked by that. Much more than shocked - astonished.
cooked for me.” Victoire screeched again, and they both flinched. “My God,” George told her. “You sound just like your mother.”
She didn’t say anything else for a minute, until they were safely hidden in an alley. No muggles would see them Apparate. “I’ll just be off then. I’m making dinner tomorrow – no arguments.”
Ron leaned heavily against him on the way out, bemoaning his empty stomach. His whining had Hermione and Harry in stitches.
He didn't notice Harry's dark look. The gate creaked shut behind them. Harry swore he saw one of the gargoyles swiftly twist a key in the lock.
“Yes, I know who Hermione Granger is,” Greenbaum said, glancing at Harry with a knowing smile. “I don’t live under a rock, Weasley.”
“Fred’s first broomstick,” Arthur interrupted. Though it was clearly also George’s. The twins stood side by side on the Burrow’s lawn, freshly ten years old with short training broomsticks in hand.
First Class. That was quite important, wasn’t it? Perhaps not, if he’d pushed it in here. He ran his fingers absently through the hair on his chest as he walked into the closet. The robes were disappointingly dark.
“That’s McGonagall,” Ron whispered, waving. The figure didn’t wave back, but when she raised her wand the gate gave a massive shudder and creaked open. “I owled her about you already. Don’t worry – she’s not the sentimental type.”
He turned to let his bare feet sit on the cold floor, not quite ready to stand. Falling over seemed like quite the possibility. “How long have I been here?”
“Sure. Maybe I’ll bring you dinner tonight?” Ron glanced over at the fountain and chuckled. “Looks like fish and chips.”
They ate ravenously in quiet for a few minutes, browsing the photos. The fried fish was heavenly, and so greasy he knew he’d feel like shit the whole night. “Find anything at the Archives?”
“Yes, you can.” She gestured to the clipboard. “I’ll take your statement, of course. Should we do that now, or would you rather have your own clothes on, first?”
“I, Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Head Auror of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and Third Chair to the Hogwarts Board of Governors…” He looked over his shoulder, grimacing. “That’s quite a mouthful.”
Ron’s chair scraped back, and he leaned his hip against the counter next to Harry. Very close. Really intimately close. “You did put in effort. More than most.”
George placed his hand over the one on his arm briefly. “Just having tea with our biggest shareholder. You’re early.”
“This is disgusting,” he pointed out, just in case Draco needed to hear it. “No wonder she wanted me to bring it.”
Draco stopped just inside, looking around with a reserved expression. Silent. Unwilling to wake the portrait, Harry waved him up the stairs, and felt him stop at the door to the drawing room. Hermione stood in front of the sofas – stiff-shouldered and jaw jutted out. Such an expression should have looked silly on someone of her size, but Hermione had the potential to be very scary, he’d learned.
“You’ll like Teddy,” he said out loud while he wrote. “But you have to be nicer to him than you are to everyone else. Even me.”
Draco looked meaningfully at the book. Harry frowned. “It was rhetorical. You’re the last person I would let near this potion.”
The trees fell away, and they came up on a dirt road. A gate sat between them and the castle, wrought iron and tall. Sinister gargoyles bared their teeth on either side, one with a large crack down the center of its face, like it had been blasted off and fixed back on later.
He smiled to himself and shut the door, finding Hermione in the kitchen. She had gotten the dishes to start cleaning themselves, and looked a little guilty when he walked in.
“Draco, I think you’re exhausted.” Clinically, perhaps. Harry looked around at the scattered books. “When was the last time you slept?”
“After this,” she explained, glancing nervously to Ron, who was still frowning at numbers. “After you help us, and we catch Dolohov – “
“Naturally.” She rolled her eyes. “He can be quite sadistic when the situation calls for it. Now, repeat after me.”
Her voice was tight, clipped. Deep brown eyes stared straight through him as her brain worked. When she set the clipboard on the table and leaned forward seriously, he was almost afraid.
“I don’t know why I – I shouldn’t have come here.” Draco turned and started looking for Floo powder. Harry saw his hands were shaking.
The two hour game felt like ten minutes. There was so much to see: the Chasers rushing the Keepers, Beaters trying to knock them off their brooms, and the two Seekers hovering above. They were probably the most fun to watch, because they rarely moved. When they did, it was either a bluff or because they actually saw the Snitch – impossible to know and therefore always exciting.
The look Draco gave him was highly annoyed. “And you’ll tend to the potion? It has to be stirred every other hour.”
“Thanks!” The bedroom door shut, and Harry took a deep breath, staring into the flames. He couldn’t. Not so soon, at least.
All he needed was a sign-off. He flattened the parchment down on the kitchen table, dipping the quill in ink and thinking. Everything looked fine. Ron had proofread – for personality mistakes, not grammatical – and given the thumbs-up. He still wanted part of this to be just from him.
Harry looked away from the domesticity of it all, upset by how much he believed Bill’s words. What would this picture look like when Teddy was a part of it? He couldn’t wait to find out.
The neon lights outside shut off suddenly. “I – Probably not,” Harry said. “Crowds. I don’t exactly blend in, do I?”
Stunned, Harry looked down at his tea. The swills had risen to the surface, spelling out very clearly exactly what George had just said.
“This is the guest room, but it’s really just yours,” he said anxiously. “I mean, you stay here a lot. So does Teddy.”
“Oh!” He brightened, clapping his hands together. “I’ve been getting ready to send him something, myself. A care package, if you will. Come up and see?”
“Of course,” he said, defensive. If Ron wasn’t constantly going on about it, the altercation in the hallway at the Ministry would be enough. “Don’t fancy a mob at the door.”
Draco looked down at the tea like he was seeing it for the first time, then back up at Harry, eyes tracking over his face like he was searching for something. “That…” he said slowly, “is an exceedingly personal question.”
The food was incredible. The House Elves – who looked nothing like Kreacher – were dreadfully nice, serving them plate after plate of whatever they wanted. Teddy practically buzzed with excitement at their little adventure. Ron ate more than Harry would have thought possible.
“We talked about Hogwarts last night. You remember how the houses were named after the founders? Well, Salazar Slytherin was obsessed with blood purity. Muggleborns almost never get sorted into Slytherin house. Most pureblood families always do. Like Malfoy.”
“Physically,” Hannah handed the clipboard over to Hermione. Harry frowned, wondering why she was allowed to see his business like that. “You’re perfect. The curse was a hybrid. The Aurors think Dolohov was – “
“Nearly lunch, innit?” Ron checked the big grandfather clock at the top of the landing. “We could go see the House Elves?”
He left the window open, walking shirtless down the stairs and into the kitchen. Hermione seemed worried about him staying on his own, but she hadn’t argued. He was up into the wee hours cleaning the kitchen and tidying his room. Every trace of alcohol had been Vanished. That done, he could relax enough to fall asleep.
“Zis is temporary, no?” The blonde woman said quietly, eyes wide. Her baby babbled quietly. “You can fix zis?”
“Mmhm.” She tilted her head toward the kitchen. “I’m half-drunk and starved. Do you have any Kraken Krisps?”
“I understand that. But what I’m asking, really, is if there’s anything off.” At his confused look, she continued. “Like, mentally? Or…physically, even. Not something the Healers would have noticed. More like…little flickers.”
It was only Hermione. Not much of a comfort, but she didn’t appear to have come to argue with him, because Ron came in after her, the both of them in sweatpants and jumpers.
Harry watched it all from George’s flat, through the gap between the window and the shop’s neon sign. He went there often, to join George during his lunch breaks. The only other opportunity he had to get out of his house was to go to the Ministry. All there was to do there was work out with Ron or Dean or Debra in the gym facilities, or sign his name on a bunch of paperwork. Hermione hadn’t asked him to come into her Department in quite some time.
. Running footsteps sounded somewhere beyond Harry’s field of vision. The man didn’t look up. He gazed at Harry with a strange, panicked intensity.
words. “I had no idea who you were, mind. I couldn’t figure out why no one wanted me at the Ministry that night. To corroborate,” he added, using the Auror term. “Ron said no one wanted to bother me. Because of who I am…because of Harry Potter.”
“You’re keeping it?” Hermione badgered. “You don’t even know if it’s venomous or not. Boomslangs are strong. It could attack you in your – “
Harry swiped his hands over the robes, looking pointedly at the bed. Draco shuffled his legs away, turning to his side, half-curled.
It wasn’t for another two weeks that Harry felt he could go through with it. Draco’s impatient guidance in making the antivenom had been, if not chummy, entertaining. Castor was very cross about being made to bite into a thick plastic screen, shooting venom into a tiny vial. Draco had actually walked across the room to watch that from a distance.
“He’s not allowed to owl us directly anymore.” Élise’s deep red-painted lips pulled into an admiring smile. “That’s when the chicken showed up.”
The third movie was about to end, its characters wrapping up loose ends and making confessions of love. It was bad enough to put Ron to sleep. Harry wished he could do the same.
She scooped something up and leaned over her desk to hand them each a printed sticker of a stylized eye – the Eye of Horus. He followed Ron’s suit and peeled it from the flypaper, pressing it to his chest. The white outlines faded, the eye soaking up the color to sit embroidered on his dress shirt like it had always been there.
“I did what anyone would do,” Draco said sharply. “And, for the record, I was only evening the score. You’ve saved my life – “
Three wasp-like bugs of a dangerous red color. They buzzed around incessantly, slamming into the side of the glass and emitting burps of black gas when they did.
Harry decided against correcting him. It was as much George’s fault, anyway, for telling Teddy to do it.
Harry bit his tongue, thinking that every week of Hermione’s must be long. “Stay there. I’ll put on some tea.”
“Harry, me lad,” Lee said, sitting on the carpet in the sitting room. The fire was low, warm light against the neon that filtered through dark curtains. “How are you?”
“It’s nothing the Ministry would approve of you using, I can say that much. And maybe if you didn’t avoid your brother, he’d have mentioned it to you – “
The man was good-looking. His skin was a familiar shade of brown. Dark, wild hair tumbled to muscular shoulders. Harry idly touched his own hair, finding it to be roughly the same length.
Harry only half listened, getting a better look at the sitting room as they walked past. It was the loveliest place he’d ever seen; misshapen chairs and two couches took up most of the space, a low fire still crackled, and an old record player sat waiting, the needle just hovering over a black vinyl.
Ron was in his cubicle, scratching away at some important-looking document. He sat up and smiled when Harry handed him the stack.
Her eyebrows came together almost disapprovingly as she drew her hand back. The steady shrewdness reminded him of Hermione – he was being very carefully examined. For what, he didn’t know. He nearly just asked where Teddy was. She started walking before he could.
In full dark, they cast glowing charms on their clothes and on the Quaffle. Light gathered down by the shed, and Harry saw that the rest of the party had migrated out. Someone had levitated a table and chairs so they could all sit and watch the game. Laughter broke out every now and then from the audience as George sent random groups of bright red sparks that they all had to dodge and blink out of their vision.
A heavy-set black man rounded the corner. He must have just taken his robes off, because the short-sleeved polo wasn’t at all right for the weather. Short dreadlocks were stuck out from a knot on the back of his head.
Now she was sleeping soundly. Ron had wound his arm around her in the night, his long legs propped on the table.
important scenario,” Harry said, talking faster than he was thinking. “You show up with Harry Potter, no one says a word edgewise.”
He stopped short, catching sight of an intruder in his sitting room. A silvery Patronus beaver paced on the old rug. It sat up when he approached it, speaking with Hermione’s voice.
“We’ll know on Monday, in all in anyways,” Seamus reminded him, settling into Dean’s side and finishing off his beer. “Can we stop talking about work now? You’re turning me into a bitter drunk.”
“Dear Great Aunt Walburga,” Draco continued, rather forcefully. “Would have surely burned my mother’s name off by now. Things as they are, this house considers me the true heir to the property.”
She only glanced at him, then back to Ron. “I’ll see you at home,” she said, resigned to his silence.
“Tell him…tell him that Transfiguration is bonkers on purpose, and he’ll look smart if he never questions it. As for Hagrid, I think he likes it when the little ones are scared - he’ll never admit it, though. You’ll be of no use to him with potions, and Zabini probably does have it out for him…tell Ted to bring up our sixth year Quidditch match where he tried a Wronskey and ended up taking out an entire stand. “
Gray eyes fell on him, ice cold and distant. He stood so abruptly that Harry briefly entertained the idea he was being attacked. Ron would love that.
So Harry and Ron had fought about this before. Harry took Hermione’s side often enough for it to be an issue.
“Teddy’s grandfather,” Harry murmured, shocked again. He reached out, feeling along the blasted, torn wallpaper. The house was fixing itself, yet these remained. “I didn’t know you were related. I didn’t know he had any family left.”
But Molly latched onto Harry, pulling him back into the kitchen to load him up with Tupperwared food. He tried to pass it off to the others, but they quickly caught onto him.
Maybe press Harry against the shelving in a different context, one with a lot more hands and eyes and mouths…and whispers.
The Fidelus charm was less than secure, but the list of people who knew the address was relatively low. “Did you recognize him?”
A group of costumed children passed by on the street, shepherded by shivering adults. Harry trailed behind them, unnoticed. It was quite busy, tonight, every porchlight on and awaiting more trick or treaters.
Disappointment crashed over him. These people were lovely. They treated him like a part of the family, and despite the situation, the staring was at a minimum. They were taking it in stride. Making an effort include him like nothing had changed at all.
Harry did, leaning back down. The snake was poking it’s head out, now, and the flaps near its head were retracted. “Has he been taking care of you?”
He found it ridiculous that their old school houses could have such an impact on their lives. Ron and his family obviously favored Gryffindor colors (which could be excused, as their collective ginger really limited the available clothing options). Harry owned more red and maroon than any brown man ought to, and this house! Along with the china, it all screamed Slytherin. There were other colors, yes. Quite an array. But with notable absences. The reds were either dull (like the Persian bedspread on one of the guest rooms he’d looked into) or bright (the kitchen walls). Never exactly maroon. The blues, and there were a lot of them, were powdery. Never quite Ravenclaw’s electric turquoise. Conscious decisions made, at some point, by one of Draco’s ancestors. And Teddy’s, he realized as an afterthought.
The massive amounts of photographs taken inside Grimmauld Place meant he was somewhat familiar with the kitchen, despite this being his first time actually inside. The long wooden table was the most recognizable feature, but it was empty. No Weasleys or piles of food or Wizard Chess boards.
Draco glanced over his shoulder. His eyes couldn’t find anything to focus on, so he just looked at the ground. “No.”
Harry now had five tubes of crystal clear potion, guaranteed to reverse the effects of Castor’s bite. God forbid it ever happened. He felt marginally better about leaving Castor loose while Teddy was home for the holidays.
He lowered his wand to the next row, stepping far to the left to bring the next burn mark into view, between Sirius (a different one – the dates didn’t match up) and Cygnus. “Phineas the junior. He supported muggle rights.”
Harry knew, inexplicably, what that meant. Binding of the soul. An involuntary shiver went down his back and he flipped past that first page – what looked like a block of history text – and found himself looking at a list. A recipe? The potion had no name, but the bottom half of the parchment was full of footnotes.
“Excellent!” Draco stood, putting one hand into his robes. Everyone tensed. Only Ron drew his wand. But Draco wasn’t going for an attack. Instead, he rolled a small, empty vial across the table. It clinked to a gentle stop in front of Dean, who leaned back warily.
The work day was in full swing as he walked out on level two, everyone in their offices where they couldn’t stare. Only Madame Rashida looked at him suspiciously over her glasses.
The air that filtered out smelled of book binding and old parchment. He got a pretty strong sense of magic that must have been the Archiving spells.
He never managed. Élise and Hermione – considerately – stayed sober with him. Hermione showed up late and strategically placed herself on the far side of the booth, so Ron was sandwiched between them. His loud voice and constant gesturing made it impossible for Harry to ask her any questions.
His first idea had been to Apparate from his front steps. Draco wasn’t sure they would be able to. That’s all he said about it, but Harry understood. Even though just being there hadn’t triggered any Dark Mark alarm, Apparating in or out might.
“Oh, spare us,” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “The safehouses have stores of potions. He got Polyjuice from one I haven’t cleaned out yet."
“A week,” he answered, with a different intonation. Like he thought Harry should already have known that. He raised the mug to his mouth. “Wasted time.”
The conversation turned to Hogwarts. The way they talked about it, it was quite literally the best place on earth. They kept saying it, and they kept saying that Harry had been happy there. The silent
The golden light made her skin shine and her hair look like fire. “Things don’t just happen to you, Harry. There’s always something else at play.”
“So you prepared. While cursebreaking in the meantime. I don’t know, Draco. I don’t think it’s too late for you at all.” He considered reaching out, but refrained. Draco looked jumpy. “We’re in this together. And I’ll help you see it through to the end.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, waiting. Ron hemmed and hawed about something, visibly nervous. Again, Harry wondered just how much of an arse he’d been, before.
As was custom around other Ministry workers, he hunched his shoulders and tried to look appropriately glum while she and Ron made pleasantries. There was an Apparition point in the Old Bank of London, just two blocks away from The Maughan Library on King’s College campus.
“OW!” She screamed, clutching her chest and zooming to the ground. “THAT ONE HIT ME IN THE TIT, YOU IDIOT!”
Ron looked perplexed, and then he laughed. “Merlin, she’s insistent. Nah, it’s just George. He convinced her the two of you were trying it. Illegally, of course. She checked your mouth for mandrake leaf about a thousand times that month.”
Harry knew Ron was talking to himself more than anything, but he was starting to feel guilty. “I can come in, you know. If you need me, or need another body, It’s not like I’m - “
“Moonsickness,” she said, recovering and settling the bag down. The mattress groaned like it was much heavier than its size would indicate. Draco didn’t stir. “Like we talked about last night. It’s common with werewolves suppressing their change with potions. Even Bill…” she sighed and set out three large flasks of differing color and consistency.
Ginny gasped and covered her mouth in faux-shame. “Old nickname. I’m horribly petty, in case you forgot.”
,” she said with obvious distaste, pulling her wand from under her shirt. “I swear, when I find who did this to you…
The ingredients had been re-organized since Harry was last there, stacked and gathered in piles that formed a circle. All in easy reach for someone who spent all their time crouched over the cauldron on the hard floor.
“George has a shop?” He’d heard it mentioned, the night before, but no one had said precisely what it was.
“You can say no to anything you like, Harry. At any time. This is just giving me the right to obliviate you after.”
“Yeah, but Malfoy’s probably using the Manor library,” Hermione consoled them at their lack of progress. “So many of those pre-Renaissance texts were sold out of public hands – the pureblood families keep them in private collections.”
He hadn’t seen George look uncomfortable before now. “Look, you’re the only one who knows about…him.”
Slowly, his surroundings filtered past. Rain pounded onto him where he lay, sprawled out in the mud. All of him was soaking wet, but the moisture on his stomach was warm and thick. He pressed his hand to it, gritting his teeth and forcing himself to his feet. As he tried to sit up, things only got worse. Dizzy nausea joined the sharp pain.
“No.” He walked around the long table, hands in his pockets as he turned to shuffle past Harry in the limited space. “It’s all you asked for.”
Ron looked up with a thoughtful expression. “We could go there, if you like? Maybe a new Boggart settled in we could take care of.”
“He’s my brother. I’ve got four. George, Percy, Bill, Charlie, and one sister. Ginny.” He looked at Harry in a lost, sad way. “I count you as the fifth.”
“Pah!” George said, cooking toast with his wand and scooping beans from the stove pot, bumping Harry’s shoulder. “That wasn’t traced back to me. Staff just assumed. Could just as well have been Skele-Gro. Here.”
Her hair was braided into a shining plait over one shoulder. Looking at her for too long was difficult, but he saw her smile as he focused on a photo of Victoire.
“Depends on what batch these are,” Lee shrugged. Harry had a question or two, but his mouth had been sealed shut.
,” he slapped the memo down onto Draco’s project outline. “Tells us that if any Death Eater dies before he’s finished, it throws everything off and the potion won’t work.”
She shook her head. “Well, it’s strange. When you woke up, you didn’t know who I was. You knew about curses, and
kneazle?” Someone yelled, striding out of one office to bang on a door. “Flanks! I’m not answering for this! You were meant to have them tranquilized be
He grabbed as much produce as he could carry, hoping to ease off the takeout. Five minutes into a search for owl treats, he remembered where he was and simply picked up an extra apple.
The quill hung in the air, waiting for him to take it and sign the same parchment from the day before, which had also just appeared.
“Dumbledore was the Headmaster of Hogwarts,” Seamus cut in. Harry nodded, doing his best to keep up as, over the next hour, his team told him about the war. Some of it, Élise and Debra could tell. Logistics, public opinion. But it was Ron, Dean and Seamus that had been at Hogwarts with him.
Draco turned the corner just as Harry had shoved the book back onto its shelf. He looked harried, like he’d just escaped something horrible.
They walked up the steps. Harry looked around, trying to take in as much detail as he could. There weren’t many pictures around. The ones he did see didn’t give him anything new. It was mostly Hermione, Ron or Teddy.
“I’ve no clue.” He looked at the cat. It blinked at him and abruptly ran out of the room, disappearing through a cracked door.
Well, that was that. Harry didn't know what he expected. He sighed and changed the subject. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you."
Draco picked up the bottle and drank from it. Gulped. A rivulet of red ran down his chin before he brusquely wiped it away, leaving the kitchen without a word.
“No. Other one.” He smiled at Draco’s groan. “Only a bit of a walk, but it’s lovely out. You can wear the Cloak.”
“Excellent point,” Draco hissed, making Harry feel like the thickest person in the room. “I’d nearly forgotten.”
“Because you’re – “ Ron started, then caught himself, smiling sheepishly. “It’s the witch magazines more than anything. The day you find a girl will be a day of national mourning. Molly’ll keel over from happiness, though.”
. How had he not thought to look for it where he’d woken up? His wand was…important. Or something. “Don’t…remember…”
Anyone who shares the Mark is linked.” That sank in for a few moments. Élise wound her fingers together. “I think I can reverse-engineer things, and find Dolohov.”
She waved off his first argument, which was for the best because he wasn’t sure what he would have said. “I’m sorry, Harry, but you’re the only one who has a shot at this. Ron won’t be able to get a warrant, and Draco wouldn’t invite him in. I…I just don’t think I can do it.”
He shooed Harry out, shutting and locking the door. “You don’t recall, but something similar happened with the, erm,
After lunch, he was too busy to chat and Harry certainly wasn’t going to seek out Hermione. He went home, did laundry, watered the pumpkins (easing off the MagiGro for now, as it was over a month until Teddy was due back and they were already straining out of their pots).
“’Ta. Good, erm, luck.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder and strode off. Avoiding the stares of passerby, Harry pinched some Floo into the fire and stepped inside, glancing quickly down at the first line of directions.
Castor stayed away from him, probably sensing his mood. Harry cleaned the kitchen, dusted Teddy’s room, and showered, his head buzzing all the while.
For a tray, he picked up something long and flat that leaned on the top of a Baker’s rack. It, too, looked priceless, made of gilded gold and adorned with twisting, balustrade strips of iron. More of a torture device than a breakfast apparatus. He turned to start loading the mugs, realizing he wasn’t alone. A burning pulse of adrenaline nearly had him grabbing at his wand. Draco was so quiet – and it was of no help how skeletal he looked in the harsh light.
The door pulled wide open, George standing there as though nothing in the world was wrong. “Harry Potter!” He cried, unnecessarily loud. “What are you
The boy was white. Thin and knobby in his youth, with the appearance of someone growing fast. Like his body was perpetually trying to catch up to too-long arms and legs. Hazel eyes were crinkled in laughter, lips pulled wide to show a gap-tooth set of teeth. Deep blue hair stuck up around his ears. His eyebrows matched.
“What happened?” Harry asked. Draco jumped when he spoke, the dark purple rings beneath his eyes making him appear even cagier than was obvious. “Where’s your wand?”
In the photograph, he’d been wearing sun shades. Now, through the round, thin framed glasses he wore he could see that his eyes were a deep green, slightly too bright against his darker coloring. The beard and moustache were new, as well. Too much of it for only three days – he must have been growing it out.
first impression,” Bill grinned, leaning across the table to shake Harry’s hand. “Keep an eye out, Har.”
“So.” Ginny set Victoire on her lap, spooning some potato into her mouth. “I can’t think of a thing to say to you, honestly. Catch any good telly recently?”
“Mum’s just…pretending everything’s normal. As usual. It’s weird, though, because I feel like everyone else is, too. Or – or not even
Mahmoud nodded and pushed one door open, saying something rapid to one of the guards. While he did so, the three of them put their heads together.
“Harry,” Hermione said gently. “Harry, it’s not all bad. We’ll try to recover your memories. It’s…entirely possible your amnesia will wear off on its own.”
Since he was a baby. He didn’t know how to feel about that. Past the line of trees was an open field, only one small shed taking up space in the shade of an oak. A thin trail of smoke spun from the figure sat against it.
“Right. Erm, well, what we don’t understand.” Hannah nodded to Hermione. “What the Unspeakables are interested in, is how exactly you lost your memory. How it happened, but also the extent of it. Do you understand?”
“Harry,” the man said, putting his hand over the wound and pressing gently. Like an apology. “Your name is Harry Potter.”
“Well, that wasn’t convincing at all,” Ron said, a delicate shade of green as they climbed out of the statue steps. The temperature had dropped, clouds thickening in the sky. “You let me talk way too much.”
“It’s an act. With ‘Mione and me – and Ted – you’re just Harry. The rest…” Again, with the bloody scar. “Well, no one holds it against you. Much.”
“How old are you?” Harry asked, leaning over the side of the chair, his chin resting on the arm. The snake shifted his coils, uncurling from the rock and climbing the side of the chair easily. Harry inhaled and kept still.
“Y-Yes, ma’am,” he said, even though they’d just eaten. He turned and, after a moment's thought, threw his arms around his middle.
“Night!” He called. Ron called back the same, and Harry took off down the lane, until even the orange pumpkin lights were gone.
“THEY ARE RUNNING, FOLKS. THE SEEKERS ARE RUNNING ON FOOT – “ The two players were sprinting, somehow keeping their brooms between their legs and simultaneously bumping shoulders, arms outstretched. “ARE THEY CONCUSSED? DO THEY SEE THE SNITCH? INQUIRING ANNOUNCERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW… WHAT’S THAT? HAS SHE – SHE
He’d dated Ron’s sister Ginny in school, he found out. Ron found a photo of her on the mantle, and Harry was shocked to recognize the woman from Teddy’s poster.
“I added your usual withdrawal amount.” She gestured to the file, where a new entry had already appeared. “A week early, but I won’t tell if you won’t.”
After a moment of hesitation in the empty lift, he decided on going to Hermione first. Get this part over with. The black hallway was even creepier when he was alone; his relative confidence wavered as he approached the handle-less door.
Draco stopped dead. It happened so fast Harry nearly ran into his back. Two people standing over near
“I doubt hospitality will hold out much longer,” Ron said regretfully. “About a hundred students are hanging about the Restricted Section, and I think break-in attempts’ll reach a record high once we’re gone. It’s lucky we were even allowed inside on Ministry business.”
Ron lowered his voice, pressing his shoulder to Harry’s like he wanted to hide their conversation from prying ears. “There’s nowhere to go.
Harry didn’t think that conversation had been particularly productive, but so long as they weren’t fighting anymore. “He did.”
Harry could definitely believe that. They descended into a grand sort of entrance hall with ceilings maybe three times the height of Gringotts. A few ghosts were gathered in a high corner. One of them, a young women in lavish, translucent fabrics, waved morosely in his direction. He raised his hand in return.
“There used to be an Elf. His name was Kreacher.” Harry looked up at the flawlessly white ceiling. “It still looked like a dump in the pictures.”
“I’d be the last to know.” He tried for a joke. “Whatever happened to me, I could’ve walked right into it. Tell me – am I the type?”
“Who…who’s coming?” Potter asked. The fear brought him back to his body, a little. “Don’t leave me. You’re the only one who knows who I…”
Which was where he was crouched when he saw something wedged beneath. Not a scrap at all. It was a journal of sorts. Brown dragon leather.
The shops were closed, but the restaurants and candy shops were still open, mingling crowds of young adults standing near the windows.
“I do pay them, you know,” Draco muttered, sweeping his finger along the topmost row, looking for the Pegasus book.
It was a bit much to expect Draco up and cracking, but seeing him slumped against the wall of the first landing corridor was still a shock. Harry rushed forward, crouching down in front of him and calling his name.
“No,” the stranger breathed, dropping to his knees. “Don’t touch it.” He knocked Potter’s hand away, pressing down with his own. “What have you done?”
“Alright. Malfoy. This is…” she gestured to the block of spiky text. Harry glanced over so he could turn to the same page. Still what looked like history lectures. “Thorough. What do you plan to do with it?’
“None of that, now. Stay awake.” He muttered something quietly into the tip of his wand, then pointed it at the sky. Bright white light. A vague, birdlike shape shot up and away, flashing over the treetops.
The curtains were open, sun brightening the parlor and gleaming off Draco’s hair. He was cross-legged on the floor, robes fanning out around and a book open on his knee. The burner plate was lit with a purple flame, boiling the potion that was now a watery pink. It smelled the same, but a bit less strong.
That wasn’t enough. It didn’t feel…paternal? Authoritative? He didn’t know what, exactly, their rapport was.
Harry and Ron were joined by a Greenbaum, no first name given. She was a tall, sturdy sort with neatly flat-twisted hair and upsetting height – really, was
He turned over the two scraps of information he’d been given –  he was in a war, and he was some sort of hero because of it. A celebrity, even. But he was so
Harry thought it over very carefully, needing to get his words right. “Okay. Yes, obviously it’s very weird… So why would he have told you where I was? Why bother, if he was going to kill me?”
There were other differences, of course. The house was renovating itself, so the formerly battered surface of the table was spotless and buffed, reflecting shades of crimson from the wallpaper. The china on the tallest shelves shone green and silver.
“That smells great.” He sat heavily next to Harry. “Oh, the usual madness. I think she’s mad we didn’t wait for her shift at Neville’s.”
Ron darted ahead to pull open a gateway door for them. It led to a not-quite-warm enough stone hall, open on the sides to an empty courtyard. McGonagall stopped just inside, her hands folded somewhere inside her cloak. “I do not believe you need an escort to find the library.”
It didn’t look like the man was really listening to him. He’d turned his gaze up, looking around them into the darkness.
“No. No.” Draco blinked furiously, and his breaths were growing less even. “The curtains opened themselves. There was a man on the street. Muggle clothes.”
“Thank you,” he said. The goblin – Rocknor, was it? – sniffed through a small, flat nose and turned on his heel. Fleur rolled her eyes behind his back.
to the Ministry any other way. The staring still happened as he stepped into the atrium, but he felt a bit more sure of himself today. He kept his back straight as he strode across the atrium floor, glancing at the fountain. The golden blob was an owl, today, wings spread in flight. It wasn’t visibly attached to the floor, but water trickled from its gilded feathers in a steady, clear stream.
“It’s been a rough day, alright?” George dropped his head back to the wood, heaving a sigh. “Harry doesn’t remember that I’m his lover.”
A rickety set of steps went up and around through the inside of the structure. Just between the wooden slats he got a glimpse of brown grass and three high gold hoops. Then they were climbing.
Before she could answer, both sets of curtains flung themselves open with a metal screech. Harry jumped a foot in the air, but Hermione just walked over, peering out at the street.
Like jumping, or being pushed. Whether it was a choice or not, gravity took what it was owed. Yes, falling. Something was falling from such a great height. It would never come back as a whole. Only as a piece. A fracture. A stunning explosion. Ice-blue eyes that lied. Always lying.
“Brilliant, naturally. Respectful and very discreet about his wrongdoings.” Her eyes glinted with amusement. Harry hoped that meant he hadn’t been caught with any Weasley products yet. “I instructed him to wait for you in the Common Room, though I doubt – “
There was a knock at his bathroom door when he was in the shower later that day. Night, in fact, so he was more than alarmed.
“Crouch Jr.” Ron’s voice was soft, his eyes downturned. “It’s a long story. The full moon is this week, isn’t it?”
“Slovenian,” Draco said, after a pause. “Their breath renders smaller insects incapable of movement.”
“’Cause if we did get lucky, and found one of them…well, they won’t come easily. I think I’d rather have a chance at finding Dolohov for certain than Macnair by accident.”
There was a scuffling sound as George tripped over the rug, and then he was standing in the doorway, nose wrinkled. “What the hell is this?”
“I don’t care what they think of me,” he snapped, still at a whisper. “In fact, I welcome it. People like me shouldn’t
“I’ve…been doing research,” she whispered, picking at the fur behind Buck’s ears. “Could you make tea?”
Once they were past a small pile of stacked rocks, he saw the cabin. It was small against the looming forest, built out of brick and wood and a good deal of luck – the angles weren’t at all sturdy but it was clearly old. Smoke rolled out of the chimney, promising warmth.
Hermione never showed, and eventually Ron called it a night, defeating Harry at Gobstones for a fifth time before knocking off. Harry released Castor from the bedroom and let him crawl about the house while he finished up with the dishes and got ready for bed.
Harry thought about it, glancing at the window to gauge the time. “Nah, that’s all right. I wanted to send Todd back.”
“You already asked me – “ His eyes did the fluttering thing again. “No. If he was, Potter would be dead. I probably would, too.”
“What are the phrases?” Harry shoved aside the large, turquoise bag with the rest of the baby toys to the side and sat. George pulled a chair over and propped her up on his knee, for all the effort she made to slide to the floor like a boneless ginger heap.
His eyebrows pulled together, less annoyed now and more uncomfortable. Harry was glad to not be the only one, for once.
“Not bloody likely,” Lee said, following him. “What about those sugarplum doxies from a few weeks ago? Think they’ve calmed down yet?”
“Well…” Ron scrunched his face up. “Don’t tell ‘Mione I said this, but I think she’s convinced she’ll fix you. And I don’t doubt she will, but it might take a while. If you don’t have your memories by the weekend…”
Hostile, confrontational, and brazen. But true. Harry thought they could all see that. He chanced a look at Ron, trying to decipher
“International Magical Cooperation,” Ron explained, then gave him a considering side-eye. “Alright lot, them. I wasn’t planning on going out, but… If you feel up for it…”
But he hadn’t really remembered…had he? He didn’t know if he should feel victorious or worried. “Sorry.”
“Oh, so he’s ‘Draco’ now?” George asked, but appeared to give it some thought. “Knocked him across the face a few times, once. I mean, he was an
“Well, they’re fine, for tonight.” There was a creaking sound. When he turned back round she was laying back on his pillows, arms spread. “You didn’t go to the Appleby game.”
“Fuck.” Harry panted into his water tin, starting to sincerely regret his lack of exercise in the past weeks. His body right after the attack was hard to remember. He should have appreciated it more at the time.
She shook her head, disagreeing with him but falling asleep halfway through the motion. Harry stood there a moment before bending down and gently slipping the time turner from around her neck. It wasn’t pleasant to hold, and he avoided staring into the hourglass part of it as he set it on the mantle, next to the Floo powder.
“After the war, which was your fight, the Ministry went through…serious reform. Very few of us kept our jobs, or even wanted to stay.” Her face darkened. “Our fight was with the Dementors. They were a big problem. They stopped attacking civilians, but no one was going to forget what they did. So, we corralled them in Azkaban, while it was empty. No one knew how to…kill them. Not permanently.”
Ron and Hermione shared a look that Harry just caught. He rolled his eyes and bought the next two rounds as a bribe to stay out of the spotlight. It worked – they passed the next few hours talking about other things, leaving Harry to sit and take in as much as he could. At some point, it was just too much. Names, places, events. The sounds of their voices became more comforting than their words.
“How do you plan on moving forward?” Her hand pulled away and wrapped around a cup of tea that had definitely not been there a moment previous. “You’re going to tell the boy of your condition?”
Like the front atrium, this room was a circle. Bookshelves covered the walls on both of the levels, one big circular desk on the floor, lit at intervals with yellow-bulbed lamps. All under another piece of artwork – only the bird-man here sat at a desk. His one visible eye was open, gray instead of black. There was only one window, nestled between two bookshelves.
. Nothing, of course. He felt fine, his head solidly on his shoulders. It was a relief to go outside, into the cold, with a scarf bundled around his face and hat pulled low. As good as any invisibility cloak.
“Ron, we look like schoolgirls,” Harry muttered as the crowd became louder. Ron looked down at their joined arms like he hadn’t noticed, dropping the contact.
“Hermione said to tell you she’d be late tonight.” Harry had only seen her long enough for her to snatch the book out of his hands and give him a hug. Whatever those two pages contained, she was sure to know by the end of the week. There was a determined look to her eye that Harry was starting to understand.
Bloody hell, this was a nightmare. He could just send some sickles along…but did he even have any laying around? And Teddy might be hurt if there wasn’t a response…
Underneath the two of them, in the same thin banner script as all the other names, was Draco’s name. That made him Sirius’…first cousin removed?
“Hermione…” he sat on the edge, curling his hands together in his lap. “Seems to be the only person completely put off by my lack of memory. The others…I dunno, it’s like I’ve come back from a long trip.”
“To find them, yes. And? All we’ll need is once more. That’s every Death Eater, off the streets.” Ron almost said something else, but bit it back, the
Ron looked very put off by this. “I think I prefer you. Even like this. My brothers have other things to worry about.”
He kept his heating system turned up high to counteract the onset of winter. Castor still complained of cold, and became less active. Now that there was antivenom on hand, Harry stopped removing him from his bed and just slept with a giant snake half-wrapped around his calf.
school. It was always the Weasley’s house, and it was always the holidays. Until the papers were dated 1996, and the pictures were at another house, instead.
“It seems like I got in a fair amount of trouble, actually” Harry amended, thinking of all the detention stories he was told. Draco went quiet after that.
Draco met him a few minutes later, again in muggle clothes and not robes. The bulk of yet another jumper hid his thinness. He pulled the Cloak from Harry and put it on, only speaking when he was no longer visible.
Draco looked faintly surprised that Ron didn’t already know, but shook it off. “Don’t owl me again, Potter.”
“Is it?” Harry looked out, failing to see either of the teams on the ground. Ron filed in to his right. Hermione was still going around talking to the professors.
have done something like it before, and invited the Weasleys. It was the best possible use of celebrity.
Heavy exercise with Dean made every morning a mess of stiff muscles and weak thighs – his shoulder in particular ached almost constantly now – but warm tea usually did the trick, along with a capsule of muggle painkillers he’d grabbed at the store.
“I don’t know why Draco’s so afraid of you,” Harry muttered. “I wish he wasn’t. It would do him some good to get out of that house.”
A shadow passed over them as the pan floated overhead and down, hovering above the empty plate and flipping the eggs once before dumping them down. It smelled incredible.
She dug in her pocket before handing over a cell phone. He almost didn’t recognize it as such, because the one he already owned was so much different. His flipped open. This one was one long, smooth piece of glass. It looked a lot more breakable.
“Sit,” he growled. Draco looked at Harry before he did, his shoulders going impossibly tense as he sank gracefully into the chair. “Harry corroborated your story. No point in questioning you.”
“Where will I go for the holidays?” He asked more insistently. “They won’t take me away from you – ?”
“Hm.” The trees swayed good-naturedly above them. Wind brought the faintest smell of candy and perhaps beer. “Why did Hermione ask me if I was one?”
or plain being arrested on corruption charges. You and Hermione put your heads together and suggested what we do now. Aurors can sort of exist all over, and answer to everyone. No one has too much power.”
Ron swiveled to face him. His cubicle was filled with trinkets, and smiling photographs. There was a smaller version of the poster from Teddy’s room. Ginny yawned, gesturing vaguely to Ron in a
“No!” He said, too loudly. She paused, raising her eyebrows. “I don’t need anyone else taking pictures of me, today. And I don’t want to drag you into it.”
He looked up, face full of curiosity and, more than that, trust. Trust that Harry was about to break. Nothing prepared him for how lost he felt
They reached the landing. The staircase continued above them, spiraling up underneath a white marble ceiling, painted at the center in the image of a man with a beaked, indigo bird head. In Egyptian style, the head was turned in profile. One black eye swiveled around to look at all of them.
“I really, really wish I could answer that," she whispered, at length. No threat of tears, but a very tired softness. “I’m sorry.”
Harry waved it away, feeling stupid, and handed Hermione her wand. Seeing Ron reminded him of what he’d forgotten.
Ron didn’t seem capable of acting anything less than completely normal. Which meant she wasn’t telling him whatever it was that scared her. Harry held firm to his policy of simply not asking.
hadn’t been there a few moments before. He set it down on a blank spot of counter and reached up, into another empty compartment. Out of that came a basket of eggs. An actual
Draco nodded, straightening up just enough to appear natural while still pressing Harry back with his shoulder. Harry didn’t dare move, even though this position was fantastically inappropriate.
Harry set the vial just to the side, where Draco would see it, and turned his head at a noise from downstairs. Coughing. A door slamming shut.
“Flash-forward to the 1970’s, and this…man…comes to power. Only he’s not quite a man, but I’ll get to that. He and a load of his followers – Death Eaters – start trying to spread this pureblood-supremacy shite. It was horrible. They infiltrated the Ministry, used Imperious on the most influential people…you can imagine.
He knocked on the plain door between the edible soap display and a stacked set of boxes with pictures of a tarantula on front. There was a slam, a clattering rush of footsteps, and George pulled the door open breathlessly.
“Harry doesn’t drink,” someone called. It sounded like Percy. Harry was grateful – he hadn’t made any kind of announcement about it, but alcohol had been gradually removed as a Sunday staple.
It seemed deserted until a witch Apparated just ahead of them, fumbling with a set of keys outside a building called
It felt frail and ancient in his hands, the cover a thin cardboard and the pages like onionskin. He very gingerly flipped it to the other side, opening the back and looking at the page numbers. Five hundred and two pages. All this work, for two pages.
Her hair seemed less curly than usual. Flat. And her skin had an ashy hue to it. They walked through the Atrium together, gathering more stares than usual. Harry had to let go of her to Floo, and once they were in her flat she seemed even weaker.
Draco shook his head, mouth tight. “I believe the sight of you would put my mother into cardiac arrest.”
“So why?” He challenged, drawing up to his full height. “Why let it go on?” She couldn’t answer him, and they both knew it. “Why let me be happy? Why let me be a good friend? A better father? A better
They didn’t leave until late. He was thoroughly hugged or had his hand shaken by everyone, and found he was very sorry to go.
Draco nodded tightly. The lack of composure was startling. Harry looked down at his wand, unsure how to proceed. “He wouldn’t be able to get inside. Did he see you?”
The two Seekers suddenly broke apart, but the referee hadn’t yet pulled his wand. Their heads turned in the same direction to keep something in their line of sight. They looked back at each other, and then –
He nodded, hiding his uncertainty as he stepped off. She still had a smile plastered over her face, but just before the doors shut it dropped away. For a brief second, she looked distraught.
“You were famous, and well-liked. Adored, actually. I resented it, because all who adored you turned against me.
artwork of a cartoon man looking down at his crotch in surprise. Harry reached up to look at what it said. As his hand entered the line of sight of a rubber chicken, though, it sprang to life, dancing across the shelf and squawking what sounded like the Irish national anthem.
They and Teddy all leaned over the wood beam, only to fall back as seven figures shot up past the box and into the air in a line formation.
The front door burst open, and Hermione marched in, shaking Ron’s hand away as he tried to stop her. “What is going on in here?”
“It’s been two months,” she hissed. Then she turned and jogged back to the house, leaving Harry standing at the gate by himself.
“See that you do. We’ll need to be far more discreet for your next visit.” As if to make her point, a group of students peeked around the end of the hall, chattering excitedly. Harry definitely heard his name. “Mr. Lupin.”
Something in his tone made her smile. “Do you, now? And I’m sure I don’t need to tell you your address?”
She brushed her cheek with the back of her hand, staring out the window with one knuckle pressed to her lips. "If I could just figure this out...if it wasn't taking so long, then you wouldn't have had to - "
Harry shifted the weight of the bag on his shoulder. She was challenging him, and he hadn’t been expecting it.
but Hermione taller than him? – that made him feel quite small walking between her and Ron. He just hoped she was alright being accused of having secretly married him.
,” he pointed to a hieroglyph, a vertical line with a squiggle above. “If you carve this into a column, it becomes not only linked to that which it supports, but every other inscribed column in the entire structure. And the
Harry thought, wondering if it was all magical theory with those two. Did Draco make jokes with her? He waited, but she didn’t say any more. She just looked at him.
the person you’d rather have? Someone completely resigned to that sort of sadness? What if – what if you send me back, and I do something worse than just obliviating myself? All so you can have Harry Potter back on your agenda.”
“Really? Which one?” He wracked his mind, like the new addition would suddenly present itself. “Was it about Teddy?”
“I can’t turn it off,” Harry blustered, humiliated. Seamus waved him out, shutting the door against the onslaught and casting a
She had the clipboard again. He turned away from the pictures, raising an eyebrow and following her back into the sitting room. A tall lamp near the couch lit up on its own, casting a warm glow over the room. A glance through the window told him they were high up over a busy street. A flat, then.
Harry opened his mouth to ask about that, but the memo that had just fluttered past them had turned in its path, instead stopping over Ron’s head and gently falling. He caught it, eyes going wide.
George sat facing them, long legs crossed so he could balance the notebook. “Gentlemen, would you describe these plants to me?”
“I understand.” Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, hesitating. It was silly to feel like he was overstepping, right? He was their boss until recently. “Only I woke up totally alone, maybe a half a mile from the house. It’s only chance I found it at all.”
The air was unbelievably fresh, and he realized after a moment that this was his first time outside since waking up. In effect, this was the first time he
He bubble fit comfortably inside his robe pocket. Between the snakes compliments and Hermione’s nagging, Hagrid seemed to have forgot there was something wrong with Harry. They were well out of hearing range of the little cabin before Hermione started in.
He nodded, and after a few more general questions about his health, Hannah left. The way she looked at Hermione was odd. Harry got the sense she was deferring to her.
“What exactly happened, dear?” Molly asked, speaking over her son as she rushed over with a levitated plate. “Concussion? Nasty curse? Whatever it was, no one thought to feed you a good meal – “
“He called it residue. And bottled it.” Harry jerked a thumb toward the still-open wardrobe, holding his hand over the bed to feel the warming charm still in effect. Despite it, Draco was shivering. Harry could see it in his shoulders.
“Two schools of thought emerged – magic that could insure against death. We’re all achingly familiar with the second.” He dropped his gaze, jaw tightening for a brief second before he regained control. Horcruxes, Harry thought. He’d heard enough about them, certainly – someone dividing parts of their soul into inanimate – and animate – objects. What no one really spoke about was the magic behind the act, and after the fruitless research at both Hogwarts and the Archives, he knew why.
“Because of this,” Draco said. His eyes were molten in the wandlight, bright and dark at the same time. Harry swallowed, resisting the urge to touch it. That would be pushing his luck.
“But – but that should be in a museum! Or at least accessible to Magical History N.E.W.T. students!” Now things sounded more personal – he wondered just how hard she’d looked for it while at Hogwarts.
Draco took an odd, steadying breath, leaning slightly against the sofa back. “By missive? Or will you be plodding about my work station?”
,” he muttered. Nothing. Forcing a deep breath, he stepped back, looking at the series of bricks with discoloring that indicated they’d been tapped by many wands. Maybe he had to try
semi-regularly and semi-thoroughly. Draco’s name would have stuck out. Ridiculously, his brain spun the possibility that the newspaper had set their sights on Draco as another one of Harry’s ‘possible paramours’. A bloody ridiculous thought.
know. They had photos of the two of you in Diagon Alley together. I’m sure you just ran into her at Gringotts, but you were
“What’s that got to do with…” Harry cast it aside. Hermione probably did have a hand in the Accounting work. Why not. “What are they rowing about?”
Harry closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before opening them again. Teddy looked hopeful. What exactly he was hoping for, Harry had no idea. “I was having fun. That’s what happens.”
It was Elizabethan, aged gray brick and so many windows. No Hogwarts, certainly, but beautiful. The structure itself was a little stark, but unseasonably green hedges and vines adorned the front face, white and pink blossoms bursting all over. Beyond the main house was a large pond, lined with more too-green trees and occupied by what looked like large white swans.
wondered why the Elves at Diagon Alley were so well-dressed. They were bloody citizens and he had no idea! “And a shine to you, it would seem.”
“You see,” Harry went on. “All I know about myself is what others have told me. Friends, coworkers…the papers. But it’s not that simple. There are things I think they don’t want to say. Or can’t. So I wanted to ask you.”
This apparently was the excuse many nearby students needed to stop and stare at Harry. “Hullo, Sir Nicholas. Who says I’m not on Ministry business?”
“I was alone – I had been alone there for weeks. The only person who could have entered the premises was someone else with a Dark Mark. Dolohov must have been trying to get to that safehouse, but for some reason he left Potter there instead.” His eyes flashed to Harry’s face for the briefest of moments. ”I don’t care how injured he was – if he had the wherewithal to Apparate the two of them splinchlessly, then he should have killed him.”
The receptionist took their visitor eyes back, the sticker peeling off looking exactly as it had gone on, and thanked them for coming in. She was quite beautiful, Harry thought off-handedly, with bright hazel eyes and long dark hair.
, it was jarring. The alleys grew even quieter as afternoon set in. It was nearly like having the place to himself.
“Are you absolutely sure, Harry? Can you say with a hundred percent certainty that you were in your right mind, with your memories gone and your stomach sliced open?”
Draco gazed levelly at him, until he actually had to resist the urge to squirm. The stopwatch saved him, dinging tinnily. Draco clicked it off and slid back to the floor.
“Harry,” Nevile began, right behind him. Harry turned, ready to evade whatever he was about to be asked. But before Neville could ask it, the blonde woman Zabini had been speaking to stepped down onto Harry’s bench, elbowing Neville aside. He only made room for her instead of looking angry.
“How – how did he seem to you?” Harry asked, turning. Ron’s eyebrows were pulled low as he wrestled with Minerva’s parting statement.
This silence stretched out. Horrible, meaningful silence. He knew what they were all thinking. Ron’s mum pulled out a chair, sinking into it and staring at him with glistening eyes. This was a mother figure to him. He knew this couldn’t be easy for her, and his heart ached. For all of them.
She made a fluttering motion with her hands that indicated this was all too much to deal with, pulling off her gloves and throwing them on the table, giving Harry a wide berth. He tentatively let go of the snake’s head, letting him bob around to try and smell her. Ginny examined him from a distance, one hand on her hip. Not as angry as Hermione, and not as eager to disengage as Ron.
and walked inside, putting in two orders of that and one Bordeaux, which they did have. Several types. He asked what a hundred quid would get.
her to wear it, though he couldn’t figure out where his discomfort with it stemmed from, or why the heaviness of it was so repellant.
She paused long enough to take a breath. “You’ve seen one, you just don’t remember. The Hogwarts Pensieve is unique in that the Founders used four shared memories as their seed. A complex bit of magic, and lasting. Anyone can add to it – student or staff. It’s a piece of living history.”
“He’s your best friend, Harry.” She waved her ring finger. “And my husband. So I feel I have the authority to apologize for his behavior.”
He stood, walking slowly to the other end of the room. His legs felt fine, not at all wobbly. “So I’m free to go?” His arms had old, faded scars dotted across them. Made sense for an Auror.
Hagrid’s eyes moved up. “He’s been a’right, so long as I keep ‘im fed. Had Butch out catching mice fer ‘im.”
on the doorstep anyway. Draco was halfway down the steps when Harry threw the door open. They stared at each other for a shocked second before Harry got his wits and slammed the door behind him.
“What’s this?” He stepped forward, looking at the blurry, unmoving photograph of a bald man. Underneath it was a series of papers, some typed out and some handwritten.
The cat’s footsteps pelted across the carpet in a burst of feline energy, but it didn’t come into the kitchen. A little radio by the sink played muggle jazz. He didn’t think he was scaring her, exactly, but there was a starkness in her eyes he hadn’t seen before. The clear lack of a response cemented it for him.
Hermione gave Harry an accusing look, then wordlessly tugged Ron back by the back of his robes. “Go on, Harry.”
She turned to the fireplace, pulling her hair back and setting her shoulders. “I was thinking of connecting this to the Floo.”
“Harry, I’m serious.” She waited until he stopped smiling. “I’ve gone over his report a thousand times. It’s perfect. Truly impressive as a proposal, as well as a work of magical theory. Honestly, he should publish it.”
“Here, give me a turn.” Ginny leaned over to take the baby, whispering in his ear. “You’d better start eating before mum has a conniption.”
“I had an intern do it,” she said defensively. Harry didn't believe her. “But yes. One mistake. And I don’t think we can afford any mistakes.”
“I don’t know,” she yelled, “if I am saving your life or ending it! I really don’t! And the same could be said for Draco. I don’t know what more I can
Draco said nothing else as they reached the landing. Harry went to the first open door, finding a room much changed from the last look around he’d had. The empty bed frame was now a four poster, through the house’s interference or Draco’s. A fluffy green duvet stretched across, neatly made and probably not slept in for days.
“Not at all,” Debra said quickly, nodding. Dean and Seamus followed, casting curious looks over their shoulders as they rounded a corner.
“Right you are.” He smiled. “You know word’s gotten around Hogwarts that you’re giving out autographs now. Won’t be able to go there, either.”
Ron’s mouth opened, then shut. He pulled his hands from his pockets and gestured to the table. “You remember chess?”
She screeched, pleased at the mess now scattering Harry’s jumper. George didn’t help clean him up, distracted going through his mail. “Good girl,” he muttered absently, bouncing her on his knee and making an even bigger mess as she giggled her lunch up. “This is from McGonagall.”
Several teller desks lined the long room, goblins and humans sitting behind them shuffling through papers or counting coins. Harry glanced down at the paper, walking straight past them toward the smaller hall at the end. He pushed his hood off as he went, spurred on by the lack of patrons currently inside. The humans that glanced up smiled, but the goblins scowled. He walked faster, following Ron’s instructions.
She picked up the pen and started scribbling on the paper. He peered down, but the words slipped away as soon as she wrote them. Concealed.
Earthshine: Sunlight reflected by Earth that makes the otherwise dark part of the Moon glow faintly. It’s especially obvious during the Moon’s thin crescent phases.
“One owl to the head of Magical Game and Sports and you’d have the Trillenium Stadium all to yourself whenever you want. Not to mention Ginny Weasley’s connections. Fresh Snitches and state of the art brooms.”
Teddy met him halfway down the steep steps in a much less painful hug. “You just made it,” he said urgently, tugging him down the row toward Minerva. Harry waved her way, getting a tight smile in return. “It’s about to start.”
Neville, finally, helped him with the mystery of the snake’s name. Harry owled him at Hermione’s suggestion, making the snake describe it as best he could. Neville said it sounded like Castor bean. A leafy plant with red bark and prickly burrs.
The snake’s body twisted along the wooden beam, the flared head descending and now less than a foot away from Harry’s face.
Biting back the urge to return pleasantries, Harry just nodded and pushed inside, striding through an entrance chamber and through a second set of doors. Past that, he had to stop and look, re-orienting himself in time and space.
When he next snapped awake, it was without any apparent provocation. There was a vague panic in the back of his head. It slipped away as soon as he noticed it.
The third binder, when he pulled it open, wasn’t a photo album at all, but a scrapbook. The first page was a smiling woman with curly blonde hair, holding
“A lot has changed, I think we can all agree,” Hermione said to Draco’s back. Her hand found Harry’s again, and for the first time it bothered him. “Do you need anything from me or my department before you start brewing?”
Silence lapsed. Draco had his head stuck in a book, and Harry wished he’d brought something to do. It wasn’t late enough to try and sleep. He watched the fire for a few long minutes, then chanced a look at Draco. The stopwatch had gone off just moments ago, making them both jump, and now he was carefully doling out half-teaspoons of liquid toadstool.
The next turn – a low tunnel – led them deeper into the castle. The air lost some of its chill and he could feel his nose again. All of the portraits here seemed to recognize him, but he kept his eyes firmly forward, stomach turning. Was she taking him straight to Teddy?
Harry resisted an eyeroll, wondering what it would take for Draco to stop asking him that every time he showed up. “I was worried.”
It was nestled at the bottom of the alcove, beside a stacked pile of trousers. Not very big at all, but ornate. Black stone engraved with runes that glowed the same color as the swirling contents.
George’s smirk dropped away slowly. His eyes went wide as saucers, and Harry couldn’t hold the act any longer. He snorted.
,” Draco breathed. The book snapped shut and he pushed it off his knee, standing without tripping by doing something complicated with his wrists that moved the fabric of his robes just so. “So that’s what this is about. You want to know why you did it.” He turned and walked to the window, crossing his arms. “Everyone’s told you I should be locked up, am I correct?”
Nothing was broken, it seemed. Nothing important enough to keep him from walking. He took a step forward, then another. A persistent, nagging thought that made him stop. It was important, for some reason, that he make sure no one was around.
It was incredible. He almost moaned as flavor exploded across his tongue, and Ron gave him a knowing look, tucking into his own plate and yelling across the table at Charlie about dragons. It wasn’t that Harry was being left out, exactly. It was that he wasn’t being pressured to join.
and weighing it in his hands. It was larger than Hermione’s book, but much lighter. He needed to get home. There was a mountain of paperwork Ron left for him to sign off on, and Todrick probably couldn’t find this place to deliver a letter from Teddy if it came.
. Debra stomped over, arms wrapped tight around her middle, a thick black scarf nearly covering her omni-present frown. “Let’s get on with it, shall we?”
“Well, you were wantin’ a pet, I thought,” Hagrid said, still carefully inching away. He sounded hurt, and Harry struggled to modulate his tone.
It was an utter relief to be alone. He thought it with no small amount of guilt, but the air seemed fresher as he walked home. Did socializing exhaust him this much before? Maybe it was easier when he knew what they were talking about. Either way, this was much nicer.
She nodded. Harry took a second to think, very aware of their eyes locked on him. “You both make it seem like…like I’m an important person.”
Ginny looked back at him for a moment, on the verge of saying something. He knew she didn’t have an answer – at least not one she would ever say aloud. It was in her eyes the same way it was in Hermione’s.
Her brown eyes glowed in the faint light. No visible source for it, he noticed. No torches or lamps. “I ask your advice on things, now and then. You helped us with…research. Regarding Parseltongue.”
“Let us know if you need anything else,” Ron offered. She gave them a strange look and walked off through a corridor labeled
“It’s an old children’s book,” she explained. “Very rare, not seen in public since the fourteenth century. I managed to track the last known auction piece to one of his great-great-uncles. There’s a near certain chance it ended up at the Manor library, though, since the Malfoys were one of the last families to fall out of favor, I think every pureblood with illicit or valuable texts would have had them moved to the Manor to avoid the raids.
“Harry Potter!” He exclaimed in a Punjabi accent. The introductions had been brief with the other two, but now two of his hands clung to Harry’s, grasping tight so he couldn’t escape the thorough examination he received over thick bifocals. “This is an honor.”
He kept his eyes down as he exited the bank, blinking in the sun off the white marble. After the twilight-esque darkness inside (and the
The headlines became extremely benign. It sent a shiver up his spine, thinking of the Ministry take over he’d been told of. It was him, the Weasleys, Hermione, and several other people he did not know. Everyone seemed in good spirits, but the house was like an extra, scowling presence in the background. One photo of George and someone who looked exactly like him had the rug in it. The same rug Harry was sitting on now.
you don’t know.” He stepped very close, lowering his voice so Hermione wouldn’t hear. He was very tall, Harry realized. And, right then, looked every bit like the acting Head Auror.
had really started in on him, as there were clippings added to the sleeves that placed the pictures in time.
In the clutches of death, Potter took a strange comfort from this man’s smile. It was unhappy, turned down at the corners, but it wasn’t unwelcome. “Potter…isn’t a very good name, is it? What…”
“I’m fully aware of the advantages,” she dismissed, waving a hand. “It’s my understanding that the endeavor was your idea.”
“If he was alone with Harry, what scared him off?” Élise scribbled something out with a quill, oblivious to the tension. “Maybe he was hurt, too. Disoriented.”
None of that interested him so much as the woman sitting next to him. She was small and smartly dressed. A burgundy tweed suit jacket hung off the back of her chair as she leaned forward, peering down at a stack of papers in her lap. Curly hair dripped from a large bun. One dark brown hand rested idly on the blankets near his. There was a ring on it.
“Hey, Harry. I thought you deserved a bit of a lie-in this morning. Since you can’t produce a Patronus; I’m speed dial two on your cell phone – I’ve no idea where you put it, but it should be in your house somewhere. Call me if you need anything.”
His eyes went even wider as he felt at the pockets of his sweatpants, a black shirt stretching tight over his chest in the process. “
“I wasn’t sure if you’d make it.” Ron looked very ill at ease. “That first week, when he was gone, you - “ He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, leaning back. “You were a nightmare. Being in the office was like sitting on a landmine.”
The photo was nice, though. It was a man and a young boy sat on a beach, wearing swimming trunks and squinting against the sun. The boy noticed the person taking the picture first, and tugged on the man’s arm until he too turned and smiled at the camera. They waved.
“I don’t doubt it.” But he would be other things. Depressed, alone, ruthlessly determined on work and work alone.
The potion in the cauldron had changed color since the night before. It was beige, now, and very thick looking, churning itself without being stirred. “You should have woken me up,” Harry said. “I came here to keep watch.”
“How generous of me,” he said drily. She laughed, a tinkling bell sound. But, really, he sounded like quite a decent sort, at least with his money. “Bill works here as well, doesn’t he? Is he around?”
She took her wand from where it was stuck through the center of her bun and waved them back into order, levitating them to a table.
Harry decided his outrage was obvious enough, and George wouldn’t really care either way. “Should I even ask?”
“Fine.” The man walked off and disappeared through a door down the hall. In the quiet, George frowned at Harry, who tried not to look too surprised. “That’s Lee.”
After a silent moment, he raised a hand (steady, now) and pointed to the wall behind Harry’s head. The tapestry wall. “How closely have you looked at that?”
Draco looked like he was going to say something, then stepped to the side. Harry took that as a cue and tried to walk out with as much dignity as he could. At the door, a hand closed around his arm. Only enough force to slow him, but he stopped cold.
“Well, you’re the only one she doesn’t gripe at to cut it off. Thought it might soften the blow.” He went downstairs, leaving Harry to follow, a bit shaken. It was early afternoon, the light outside already edging toward gold as the sun descended.
“Four days,” she chastised, fussing with his hair just like Ron had and clapping her hands lightly to his cheeks. Her voice was a much warmer, quieter version of the Howler’s. Though perhaps just as shrill. “
think his goal was, then?” Seamus asked, in the gentlest tone yet. Draco’s nostrils flared, but he answered without hesitation.
The scaly muscle around his neck tightened slightly as a knock sounded on the front door. Harry sat up, the end of the snake’s tail curling around his bicep for balance. “Who is it?”
Harry looked around, which was fruitless. He could only see in firelit streaks and hazy blurs. The sound was centered somewhere to his left, but all he felt was pillows.
“Well, I’ll just go barge in, then,” Harry muttered, grabbing his clothes and retreating into the stall. Dean and Seamus whispered to themselves and disappeared. Harry sent some very ill will their way.
“Morning,” Harry said glumly, watching Hermione stow her wand. The Department of Mysteries corridor was bleak as always. He took stock of his body, testing his left shoulder. Still sore. He’d made use of the Auror work-out facilities (Level 2 ¾ ) very early that morning. Debra gave him a very thorough ribbing when he could only do fifteen press-ups in a row – clearly, his past record was much higher. Ron explained the shoulder was an old injury, and Harry must have just forgotten to adjust for it. He’d been starving when he got down here to meet Hermione. “Hm. Earl Gray?” He wondered aloud, moving his tongue around the inside of his mouth.
Harry had expected Lee to be there, but still found himself a bit at a loss. George had been over to his house twice that week, and never mentioned him. He must have been alright, Harry reasoned. At least something like George, who was, by far, the easiest of everyone to get along with. Except perhaps Ginny. George was like a friend, whereas Ron and Hermione fussed over him like siblings, or…
“Dead.” Ron said flatly. “In the war. He was just a baby. Tonks’ – erm – his grandmum looked after him until you were…better. Old enough, I guess. She passed away a few years ago. Natural causes.”
“September the fourth. 1998,” he read loudly. “I woke up this morning, and I didn’t know where I was. Ron was there. I almost attacked him, because I only saw Voldemort’s face. When will it stop? When will I stop being afraid? When will I be able to sleep through the night?”
He settled into his bed with a sigh of contentment. The duvet was soft and warm over his bare skin, but the urge to sleep had completely gone. They were going to Hogwarts in the morning – not too early, judging by Ron’s state. Harry was excited. And apprehensive. And bloody terrified.
“Doesn’t Hermione bring you groceries?” He had to ask, gathering the empty containers and Scourgifying as Draco tossed them aside. “Where are those?”
“So…” Harry glanced at the clipboard Hermione had surreptitiously positioned next to her plate. “I get to ask questions, now?”
It hopped a few steps inside, holding out its leg imperiously. Harry gently unwound the string attached to the note, flinching out of the way as the owl took rightly off, flying straight through his open bedroom door and further into the house.
Harry’s cleaning finally made its way to the home office. He made Ron take a look to show him what files or binders could be disposed of. There was no way of knowing what he had been in the middle of before the memory loss, which didn’t seem to be a problem. Ron shrugged and said it all looked Duplicated anyway. Original documents were saved in the Auror vault or filed with the Clerks on level two.
“HOGWARTS,” Harry said, and his voice wasn’t his voice. It was amplified, rippling over the sound of the audience like a thousand of him. At the sound of it, the crowd cheered back ravenously. “ARE YOU READY FOR A…QUIDDITCH MATCH?”
“Relax, mate,” Ron said with a forced cheeriness, reaching around to gently pull the elastic from Harry’s hair. It was such an intimate gesture that Harry froze, surprised. Ron didn’t seem to notice. He fluffed Harry’s curls a bit, at some invisible point deciding they looked good enough. “At least the food’ll be good.”
Things swam into focus, through…glasses? He hadn’t been wearing them before, he was sure. The room was small, sparse.
Teddy looked curious again, but kept quiet. He waved once more as they swept off together and that was that.
“I think you’re right,” Ron said, pulling back in and looking at Greenbaum. “Looks like someone flew a broomstick right up to the window. Wind’s coming in, as well."
“What’s new?” Ron said cheerily, abandoning the seriousness of their conversation as easily as shedding a coat. “Have you still got that Gobstone set?”
Ron’s question had something passing over Draco’s scowl. His eyes shifted up and down in time with a silent thought. “I already said I can only do this once. Not to mention the amount of time…the potion alone will need a moon for every living bonded soul – “
“And then...then I’ll have to get Smets and Gallahey to follow up with Catastrophes.” Ron sat at Harry’s kitchen table, head in his hands, while Harry made curry. “Then...Dean’ll still be on the hunt for that cauldron smuggler...so any new assignments will fall to Seamus and me…”
“I do know,” she beseeched, hands still raised as though to defend, glancing back and forth between him and the staircase, where his wand was still pointed. “I know better than anyone, Harry. And I know – “
Hermione was giving him another one of her looks as he walked back to join them. Luna still somehow didn’t look cold, even as the wind swirled her dress fabric all around like Boreus personified.
Teddy nodded. His freckles were sharp against his pale skin. “It’s okay. You…you don’t seem all that different.”
be worse than those safehouses he’s been living in all these years. It must be like a vacation for him.”
He watched her putter about for a few minutes, clearly set on doing anything except sitting across from him. The avoidance was extremely obvious, and he told her so. With an embarrassed smile, she took a spot across from him. The late afternoon light made her brown eyes gleam amber.
“ – and we’ve never been closer than we are now. But I’ve seen your memories, now. I know that – that I didn’t have the entire picture before, and now I can’t tell which path you would rather take. I just know that I – like
“Hello, you three,” the woman said, looking up at them from underneath the brim of a pointed hat. Embroidered leaves and orange flowers danced back and forth. “You’re looking well, Potter.”
Ron made a disgusted face. “Grimmauld Place. We stayed there when the Death Eaters were hunting you.”
was the one who let Death Eaters into the school. His aunt – “ Ron’s nostrils flared, white hot fury transforming is genial face into something stark. “Hermione was
Two more turns, past one classroom in session – the professor faltered as they walked past, meeting Harry’s eyes in an awkward pass – and they were at a small set of doors, guarded on either side by two men in sunflower-yellow robes. They took one look at Harry and stepped aside.
“I still have to make reports to the Aurors, Harry,” she said sternly, looking at the ground. “The Ministry has a vested interest in your recovery.”
“I think the blood is a bit much,” he commented, holding a rook by the foot. Syrupy ‘blood’ dripped down to the foot but never actually fell away from the body, no matter how hard he shook it.
For the first time in memory, he got himself off. In the shower, steam rising all around, he rested his head on the cold wall and took himself in hand. It was a fucking weird thing to do, when he could so clearly visualize the
“But you’re right. I no longer have the capacity or the inclination to hate the undeserving,” Draco said somewhat lightly. “It’s been quite the life change. And if we are being honest right now…I never hated you. Not truly. I spent most of my life in the same position you are now – I only knew the idea of Harry Potter. What others told me, and what I saw when we were in school together.”
As he stepped over the threshold, magic swept over him. It was strong enough for him to notice – the magic around the Ministry and his house were subtle, hidden. This was brusque and unmistakable. Nothing anyone would be Apparating past, he could tell.
“What’s up?” Ron asked, taking what was obviously his usual spot on the desk. Harry sat in the chair, pulling Teddy’s note from his robes.
“He will,” she said with odd certainty, moving to sit next to him. “Because you’re going to tell him I need to see this.”
They only had three hours until Draco needed to be back, and a good chunk of that time had been used up by his boggling over the Cloak.
Harry looked to see, freezing as he nearly bumped noses with the snake. Oddly, though, he wasn’t afraid. Just wary.
A hand dragged roughly along his sides. Searching. He sucked in a breath as the movement irritated the wound. “Please don’t hurt me – “
They’d moved from early childhood to adolescence. Now Harry showed up in the pictures, one brown and black mess of knobby knees and wild hair shoved in with the orange and freckles. He stood out, but also fit right in.
Draco looked to the table. Something caught his eye, and he came closer. He pulled the bottle of wine out and examined the label, eyes and cheeks more hollowed out than before.
LOOKS LIKE MARKS LANDED A GOOD ONE THERE – “ The Slytherin player stumbled backward from a nasty punch to the stomach. “HERE COMES THE REFEREE, WILL HE
Gas lamps with magical fires inside hung from the ceiling, swaying slightly every time someone took a step. The large windows showed a sprawling, lush garden and some tree-lined countryside.
“Christ, Mother,” Ginny groused, pushing their water glasses out of the way as a heavy plate was sat down. Potatoes and roast. It smelled amazing.
Harry nodded, sitting opposite Ron on the plush carpet. Neither of them spoke while Ron set up the board. He was working himself up to something, Harry knew. His eyebrows kept drawing tightly together, then he’d sigh and shake his head.
Ron made a frustrated noise, turning back to the window. “There’s no way he could know. You and Harry are always going at each other. What’s different?”
He’d slipped into the ridiculous announcer’s voice again. “You want to send broccoli flavored sweets?”
He came an abrupt stop at the edge of the trees, where thick underbrush turned to untamed bushes. This could have been a garden, once, but it wasn’t what had caught his attention. It must have been his imagination, but something appeared to have moved in one of the windows. A flash of white.
“I hate the Floo.” He looked down at George’s purple-flannel sweatpants. “Besides, I wanted some fresh air.”
It was a strange thing, to look at eleven year old Harry and Ron. Of course he could see the resemblance in Ron’s face, now, but he had no reference point for himself. Young. Skinnier than even Teddy, hair sometimes very short and other times long. Ron had been chubby and Ginny so small it hurt his heart to look at her.
“I am. Thanks.” He took a glass of water that she filled with her wand. “I’m having a blast, actually.”
“Potter,” Minerva said, hand tight on his shoulder. He blinked away the sudden burning in his eyes. “Let me know if you need anything at all.”
It was difficult to make the camera focus, at first, but he got the hang of it after a few pages, turning and snapping over and over again. He read a word here and there, but not enough to understand what the book was about. There were probably two hundred pages to photograph, so he barely had time to think as he hurried along.
She nodded, holding the mug out. Harry took it. “Well, it’s nothing we were taught. Divination as we know it is Celtic in origin, more based in astrology and…other rubbish. The goal is to discern the future. This – the Greeks called it
“Well…” Fleur nodded her understanding. “Perhaps Molly would like a day off next week. It would be good for Victoire to see her only
“It’s a time turner,” she murmured, tucking it inside her clothes again. “They used to be standard fare for Unspeakables. Any qualified Ministry worker could apply for one. But…we destroyed their supply in fifth year.”
century brought about a mass rebuilding of the Egyptian wizarding societies. The glyphs, when used properly, are incredibly effective. For example…” He leaned forward, and Ron flattened the parchment to the table.
They hadn’t parted in the best of moods. After that scene in the library Draco had ignored Harry until he left. That was two weeks ago.
How horrible. My money didn’t matter, or my name, or blood. I tormented you because it made me angry. I gladly accepted the lies my father told me, because the alternative was unacceptable. How could it be that everything I’d come to believe was important…wasn’t? When I opened my eyes to reality,” he moved beneath the blanket. Gripping his forearm. “It was too late.”
“Those,” he explained, “are departments that could use us, if we have time. Most offices have at least two Auror-trained workers, but sometimes that’s not enough.”
A flash of movement drew his eye to a tall bookshelf. Shoved between several large volumes on Switching and Conjuring and a copper wolf-shaped bookend was an unframed, but upright, photo that he recognized instantly. It wasn’t exactly the one on his work desk, but was taken on the same day. The man and woman – his parents – were still in their wedding garb, only here they were joined by a tall and scruffy haired man who double-fisted two champagne flutes. In his plain suit, he shouldn’t have looked nearly as elegant as he managed.
me…” Harry trailed off as Hermione started scribbling on the clipboard with a pen she’d produced. “What are you writing? Are you a doctor?”
Harry took a step, then stopped as two House Elves popped into existence two feet away from him. They appeared mid-stride, hurrying the opposite direction Draco had gone. Neither of them were Carys. One wore robes and the other had on a blazer and skirt.
Seamus looked uneasy. Harry thought she’d bake Ron on the spot with her glare alone, then her lips twitched the slightest amount. It could have been a cackle, for all it shocked Harry. She waved them on, starting at a brisk stride toward the castle.
for me. You can forget, like everyone else has, that I was ever anything different than what I am now! I mean, can you
It was gold, sitting over an unlit burner plate between the two sofas. Dark red sludge bubbled within. He leaned closer, wincing at the sharp smell. All around were more books, some open, some closed. Glass bottles of various sizes and shapes. It seemed haphazard, but Draco probably hadn’t planned on full grown Aurors falling out of the fireplace.
“Yep. Never a dull day in Catastrophes.” He tossed the memo up and it flew away, turning to Harry with a smile. “D’you think anyone told them to check Catford?”
If Dolohov had seen him then, it meant he’d been in London for a while. Wearing a different face. Harry had been out, a lot. He’d never been attacked, or even noticed anyone watching him the wrong way on muggle streets.
“S’pose. I wonder…the burglar really thought this out. They dismantled the Invulnerability wards so they could fly in, went to the correct window, and disappeared before security showed up. All that, and they grabbed the wrong scroll? Doesn’t add up.”
“You mean you’re putting these in those care packages?” Harry leaned to see what he was writing. George smacked his notebook shut. “What other ‘specialties’ have you cooked up?”
Another Floo trip, and he was standing in a much more welcoming space. Fat brown chairs, a long sofa. A furry gray cat that looked balefully up from its spot on a chess board.
Harry gave him a look. “I’m not going to sleep. No offense, but you look like you need it much more than I do.”
The penmanship was as clumsy as the other one, with a suspicious brown stain across the lower half. Harry was already smiling as he read.
The crowd went bonkers. Across the field, the lion on the banner opened its jaw in a soundless roar, gold letters spelling out
“Self-fertile,” Lee cut in, huffing a laugh. “Bit like you at Hogwarts, George. Pollinated by bees from April to September.”
Looking at his nude body was strange. He must work out quite a lot to be so lean. The suggestion of abdominals lined his stomach. As did the suggestion of a lot of violence. He had scars all over, including the newest one. Some were so small they had to have been acquired without magic. And he hadn’t had them magically healed, either. It was the one on his forehead that puzzled him. The scar tissue was too bright, the lines too jagged. Was it a curse?
“Oh. Hey, Harry.” He ruffled George’s hair and squeezed his shoulder, peering into the box. “What are you two up to?”
Ron’s pint hit the wood heavily. “I just wanted to know enough to tell if he’s feeding us bullshit. No way to step foot inside that mansion without a warrant – and Kingsley’s not bloody likely to grant that.”
“The tree stops whenever a name is burned,” Draco was saying, still on Andromeda’s name. “Had it continued, you would see her muggle husband, Edward Tonks.”
“Seriously. What sort of magic is it? New, I expect. You know, I was toying with the idea of Temporary Tattoo Marks – “
The touch was gone before Harry could even be shocked by it, and by the time he could he was too distracted by the
They crested the hill, but it was a while longer before the trees started to thin. Ron’s exhaustion turned to excitement, his glances at Harry coming more frequently. It might have just been Ron’s weirdness, but the reason for it became clear.
To hear the Weasleys tell it, Fred had been the mastermind of the two. The one who came up with all the chaos, or at least took the blame. Harry would have assumed that was George.

On instinct alone, Harry walked over and pulled her into his arms. She clutched his shirt and pressed her forehead to his shoulder. It was a bit awkward, holding this stranger. But she clearly needed it, and this was the most he could give her right now.
tied his hands without knocking him over. Harry used the silence to undo the tongue-locking curse on himself.
. That was a new one – though, if he thought about it, everyone had been comparing his attitude of late to that same era before the war. The war was what made him different, and who he had been ever since was the Harry they had struggled to love.
“Who knows,” Harry whispered. “Maybe when people find out what you did for us – for the Ministry – “
He resigned himself to the experience, tucking the notes away in his jeans. “Does it have to be today?”
“No,” Hermione said. Ron was half in front of her, valiantly trying to not look scared now that he had his wand at the ready. “No, I’m sure Harry was just surprised, is all.”
Would she continue to pressure him? How clearly would he have to put it before she understood? Or…was she counting on
There was a short, shocked silence that ended the moment Draco shut the door in his wake. Ron had a comical look on his face. “You
“Only half,” Ron chuckled, leaning forward to snag it closer, handing over one Styrofoam box. Harry whipped it open, inhaling the steaming grease and fish smell.
George lowered his wand, showing white, uneven teeth as he smiled back. He turned, saying something quiet to Ginny as she climbed to her feet. She looked up at Harry and nodded.
Draco smiled a private smile. “They’re caretakers of the house, now, technically, not of its occupants. Though for whatever reason they’ve taken a shine to my mother.”
She seemed quite confident, which made him feel like he was overreacting. Before he could think too hard, he signed his name. The parchment vanished the instant he lifted the quill – which also disappeared – and the door swung open.
Draco didn’t look so sure, but it seemed Ron’s question had a calming effect. “No. He can’t stop it.”
“No,” she wound her arm through his, huddling close. “No, Pensieve magic is only touched on in Ancient Runes class, and that’s far from required. Pensieves are highly personal – usually buried next to their owners. A seed is the memory that…gives it a purpose. The Pensieve maker uses that to build the aura – gray matter, if you will.”
Draco was quiet for a long moment, turning his head to the side. His profile was as sharp and angular as his voice. “I was talking about before. At school.”
He knew just by looking at her – different clothes, hair braided back, no longer harried and panicked.
“Whatever happened to me,” Harry started, wishing he’d thought to ask a little more about the mission. “Dra – Malfoy didn’t do it. If my word means as much as you say it does, he won’t be in any trouble, right?”
The beaver vanished as Harry was starting a kettle. His tea was all loose-leaf, for some reason. He didn’t like loose-leaf. He didn’t know
“I’ve worked more than enough.” Her grip on his arm was very tight, and he realized she was using him to keep steady.
“Now, ‘e is at home with ze baby.” She nudged the baby picture toward herself, sighing wistfully. “Ze cursebreaking takes him away for two months, then he is back for two months. He leaves again at ze end of ze week.”
Draco’s hand convulsed around his wand, then released it, leaving it on the floor. “We’ve not spoken for eleven years. I don’t know you.”
“It’s not.” Draco spoke quickly, almost defensively. “It’s the opposite of a Horcrux. You don’t have to – “ his eyes flicked around the room once. “You don’t have to kill anything, for a start. It’s the same branch of magic, but much older.”
Aside from the stares, the alley was enchanting. A narrow cobblestone path was crowded on either side by closely packed storefronts behind medieval timber-frame jettisons. Some were newly painted, or clearly in a state of repair.
care if you live or die, Draco. I owe you that much, and since no one else is lining up for the job…”
The look on his face was honestly hilarious. Harry laughed without meaning to, which made Draco go sheet-white, for some reason. “I’m joking. I was just telling him I’ll be out for the night.”
“Yeah, but – “ But Fleur was allowed to know, he almost pointed out. Instead, he teased. “I mean, if
Harry sipped the tea, trying to look less interested than he felt. Maybe his interest would bring her to her senses and stop this flow of information.
“You don’t have to.” Her heels clicked loudly on the floor. It was so clear Harry saw his reflection as he looked down. “Really, you don’t.”
“I’m gay!” He threw his hands up. She shut her eyes. “I’m fucking gay! Why does nobody know that about me?! Is
Without a word, he held out his left arm and pulled up his sleeve. Harry tensed, unsure of what was happening until the edges of a tattoo appeared. So
Hermione cast him a perplexed look over her shoulder, spoon clinking as she stirred risotto over her stove. “What?”
Something hard barreled into his side, sending him sprawling to the ground just as two sections of wall from the buildings on either side of them detached with more rumbling noises and dust, chunks of brick and cement falling in pieces as the larger two slabs rushed toward each other.
The menagerie looked interesting. He’d be sending Todd the Owl back to Hogwarts that night, but even then he probably didn’t have a pet for good reason. An allergy or something he didn’t know about.
“I plan to,” he said, quite seriously. Minerva nodded and held out her arm. Teddy took it, raising his eyebrows suggestively at Harry. He grinned back, imagining the  prestige that came with this sort of invitation. His friends would be impressed.
The delivery had been made. Harry could go if he wanted, and let Draco get on with it. But the embossed cover of the book seemed to mock him. What was an Elusinian Mystery? Maybe Draco knew more about it. Harry decided to wait and ask when Draco wasn't so preoccupied.
“Yeah, it’s alright. You’ve got that whole – “ He waved in Harry’s general direction. “Mysterious thing going on. It works for you.”
The toast stayed between them, but Draco didn’t touch it. Maybe it would be too much like they were having breakfast together, instead of just drinking tea together. Which was already probably strange enough. Harry was his enemy, after all.
“What – “ Harry started. Hermione grabbed his elbow, tugging him along with her as she left. “Wait. Ron – “
Potter didn’t exactly think he’d done it to himself, but he didn’t say that. The stranger waved his wand, and in an instant the trickling rain ceased to hit them. An umbrella charm. Then a blue ball of fire burst into being over his body, giving the whole scene a sickly glow.
Harry thought desperately back, trying to recall anyone telling him that name since he’d woken up. He could have just seen it written down somewhere, but the only personal things of his he’d gone through just yet were Teddy’s letters, and he was sure it wasn’t in there.
Seamus and Élise looked like they’d been Stunned. Ron’s face turned a bright red. He and Dean looked at the vial mistrustfully. Debra looked like she might smile.
There was one shelf, up high against the wall, that burst with color. He stood, peering up at the strange packaging. There were several boxes of sweets with names that he didn’t…remember, exactly, but recognized. Even more alarming were the names he didn’t understand.
“Oh!” Ron cackled. “We didn’t mention that one yet. The goblins haven’t forgotten we broke in and stole their dragon.”
Dean crossed his arms on the table, scratching at his close-cropped black hair. “We all met first year. You, me, Seamus, Ron and Neville shared a dormitory. Proper fun, that was.”
“How are you doing that?” Harry asked curiously, looking for the trick. Conjuring food was difficult enough; without wand or incantation, it was impossible.
Ron did it too – the touching of the hair, the straightening of the clothes. Harry had been caught, just the day previous, in the hall with a coworker in the Department – Shagworth, Head of Something-or-other. Ron had saved him from the awkward conversation with a muttered explanation about how the guy was usually an overbearing arse. He’d squeezed Harry’s hand in apology, but it just seemed much too familiar for two grown men, no matter how close.
“We need to set some ground rules,” he decided, watching it sniff out the warmth suspiciously. “Are you venomous?”
She stood there with her hands on her hips, breathing hard. Normally she at least knocked, and her afternoons with him were quiet. This was something different altogether. “Where’s the snake?”
Should he try to…hug him? No. That didn’t feel right. Neither did words. No specific instinct presented itself, so he waited.
Draco stuck his hand through the top and back out. One of the wasps sat on his index finger, wings flapping. Harry sucked in a breath.
“The paper,” Harry breathed, almost laughing. Teddy smiled like he understood. Like it was a shared joke. Which he supposed it was. “What I’m about to tell you, Teddy, has to be a secret. You can’t tell anyone. Not even Reena.”
Draco fixed his eyes on Harry. “Lunar potions are notoriously difficult to master. The brewer is prone to mood swings, lack of focus, fatigue.”
Harry glanced at his office door warily, somewhat glad he hadn’t actually touched anything on that shelf. It must be up high for good reason. “Does he hate me?”
He stopped talking when Harry looked up, eyes dancing away. Another feint, another conversation Harry was only half-involved in.
He rode the next two days on a bit of a high. Childish, but fun. Getting Draco drunk had been a happy accident, but it had revealed something interesting: their conversation had flowed too naturally and easily – the wine hadn’t made it easier for Draco to talk to him, it had made it
“Erm. Right.” Harry brought up the wards, walking in a circle and doing everything Hermione had showed him. It looked the same as he remembered, but he didn’t want to mess with them. Better to let Hermione do that part.
The gate shut with a bang. Ron started off at a clip, winding his arm through Harry’s. It was work, keeping up with his and Neville’s long strides. His shoulder twinged. “Blimey,” he chuckled. “You’re excited.”
forget the look on your face when he sent those shield amulets that turned us all deaf for an hour.”
His hair color changed throughout. Sometimes it was red, or brown (depending, Harry assumed, on who’d he spent the day with), but as he got older things made a turn for the primary. Unlike the photos in his office, he looked happy. He smiled with Teddy.
Draco didn’t move, and Harry suddenly felt the need to put it to words. “I was so worried about you – “ he winced. Not
Ron nodded, his orange eyebrows drawn together. “While they were doing that, we were tracking down every escaped Death Eater we could find. Numbers weren’t a problem – nearly every person who’d fought at Hogwarts offered to help.
While he messed with the potion, Harry went to the window, rolling his shoulder. Not quite sunrise, but night was lifting. Ron wouldn’t be awake for at least an hour.
All too soon, it seemed, Ron found them back in the Common Room. Teddy was showing off the wizarding chess set Harry had gifted him earlier that year. The animated pieces killed each other with brute force, reforming themselves once the game was over.
The week marched on, and Harry did not recover his memories. There was no miraculous, enlightening zap of brainpower that snapped him out of it. Just a gradual settling into this life.
“It’s quiet,” Harry couldn’t help but notice, checking the time as Dean and Seamus Apparated a few feet over. It wasn't too early.
“Thanks,” she murmured, taking a mug from him. Buck had disappeared. “You didn’t see me yesterday, you know.”
It took her a moment to respond. Her arms had wrapped themselves tightly around her torso. “Wizarding school. It’s where we all went.”
“Have I never asked you that before?” He blurted before he could stop himself. There was no other explanation for her apparent shock.
He put his things away, stored the snake’s things in an empty cabinet, and made dinner. It had been an uneventful week. Wednesday was spent with Victoire, and Fleur had even hung around in the afternoon. They bundled the baby up in a tiny coat and earmuffs, watching her walk around what little yard he had. Harry liked Fleur – she was opinionated, but funny and always kind to him.
Ron turned to stare at her. “Yeah. Fine," he relented. "It is a good idea. He didn’t seem too keen on it, though.”
It all happened the same, only this time he kept his foot in as his house whizzed by, stepping out capably into the Grimmauld Place parlor.
Harry explained what had happened at Grimmauld Place. The wand responding to him without having been asked. Hermione still looked faintly uneasy, but not surprised.
The first dates were from the mid-to-late nineteenth century. On the topmost row of the tree, the forth sibling’s name had been burned away. There were several other such marks – cigarettes, maybe. If wizards even smoked those. More likely they’d been burned off by a well-placed hex.
“Ha,” Harry said drily, watching a scoop of carrot ooze out of Victoire’s mouth. “How’d you know I’d be here?” It was only just lunchtime – he’d normally be hanging around the Ministry. This was one of the few days where Hermione didn’t need him. “Or did you expect I wouldn’t be?”
“We know exactly how the pyramids were built because of the Pyramid Texts. Since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, scholars all over the world have been deciphering the incantations. The
and look professional.” His voice was so easily authoritative Harry wondered how he hadn’t been Head Auror all along.
Harry felt a creeping dread, but wasn’t certain which part of this was bothering him. It didn’t seem…
“We can, if you feel ready. I’ll take you to your place first, to get anything you need. Then you can stay at ours.”
“Thanks,” he said, settling back as she left. Piano played softly from a record player in the corner. The air smelled like bergamot and lavender. Or maybe that was the tea. He blew before sipping it, flipping through the past transactions listed on parchment. There was a pattern – a small amount was put in every two months. Auror salary, he supposed. Every two weeks, an equally small sum was withdrawn. There were some outliers, though. A year ago he’d taken out four
Minerva stopped, eyes on Harry as she handed him his cloak. In all his gallivanting around, he'd completely forgotten about it. “Have you all you need from my school today, gentlemen?”
“I have an owl,” Harry admitted, pulling the heating rock out from the Menagerie bag. “It’s not here, now, though. It can’t hurt you.”
Hermione giggled behind him, stepping over the hump in the rug and flattening it out with her heel before helping him up. “I’ve been telling you to get rid of this thing.”
At the top of the flight was an unlocked door that led to a flat. The harsh, blinking lights of the sign outside were the only light filtering into the cramped sitting room, which was piled with cardboard sets of un-folded product boxes. Clearly more of a workspace than a parlor.
“I don’t even know…” he sighed, staring at the board like he was seeing something else entirely. His bright blue eyes had gone dark. “The war. Right. Well, it was…a
Which Draco did again, reaching down into one of the empty cabinets and producing a heavy cast iron skillet that
“I can’t do this alone,” she said, composure breaking as her lower lip wobbled. “Not any longer. Not after – “
“I’d like to see you again in the Department of Mysteries, if that’s all right. If you aren’t in by one, I’ll come looking for you. Did that sound like a threat? Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’ll be seeing you.”
She leaned in closer, setting a hand on his cheek. The soft gesture didn’t match the way her eyes moved over him, like she was the scientist and he the specimen.
little git. A right terror, to hear you all tell it…and also a Death Eater, y’know. Can’t be forgetting that.”
“What should I write?” Harry asked anxiously, Summoning a roll of parchment and picking up a quill. Ron folded Teddy’s letter and set it down.
The looks were lingering. Some glanced away after meeting his eyes, abashed. Others didn’t look away quickly enough. It was like they
Hermione took a deep breath, staring at her food. “From what I can tell, Harry has forgotten only what directly concerns
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, put off at Ron’s tone. “Four of them. I’m using MagiGro, so hopefully we could carve them up or something. Teddy said he saw some fifth-years levitating Jack-O-Lanterns on to the suits of armor at Hogwarts, and I guess he’s never done that with me before, so -
Teddy laughed, wiping his eyes. His nose was nearly the same shade as his hair after being in the cold for so long. Then he was serious again. “You have to tell me if something happens.”
Harry thought of the owl that had come to his house earlier in the week with two tickets inside – Appleby Arrows vs. the Ballycastle Bats. The very next Friday.
His words shook Harry to the core, even if he didn’t have enough context to make a real connection. To him, this was just a very sad story. To Ron, it was real trauma.
Her face turned very vacant for a second, and Ron’s face went hard. He pressed a rough kiss to her head and glanced at the clock. It was three in the morning.
The wind was the only sound for a few moments. Teddy stared at him, mouth set like maybe Harry was making an elaborate joke. When it was clear he wasn’t, the look faded into confusion, and then shock.
“A very brief summary of a decade’s research.” Draco put his back – again – to Harry as he sat, like nothing had happened. Harry stepped around to an empty chair, opening the sheaf nearest to him.
“But I took my own memories.” He laughed, disbelieving. “Or was that only a mistake? Had I tried to do something worse?”
He wasn’t even sure Ron would bring up the Hermione stuff with George. Harry just wanted him to be able to have a meaningful conversation with someone who knew him better than Harry did at the moment. He was trying to be a good friend and George was making it awfully difficult.
“Right.” Harry felt stupid. “That’s why you didn’t take me into that house, the night I lost my memory. Because I don’t have the Mark?”
There was a shuffling behind him. Hermione had dropped to her knees, gripping the sides of the Pensieve so tightly her knuckles paled. Not looking into it, though. Looking at the side of it.
“Yes, of course I -  Oh.” He stopped searching the shelf, instead throwing an amused smirk at Harry’s left shoulder. “You’ve forgotten, I take it?”
“All of us, at the Quidditch games,” Hagrid boomed. A massive mane of shaggy gray hair fell over his shoulders, as long as the great beard that Ron was currently suffocating into. “Like ole’ times, innit?”
He turned back, thinking. This whole university was Illusioned. It existed, but couldn’t be seen from the outside. The lower panel slid up soundlessly, letting a burst of cold air that blew his hair about as he stuck his head out.
Ron shook his head. “You had that idea before, but we decided against working with him. He already told everything he’s willing to tell. Just after the trial.”
“Erm. No.” Ron didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. He crossed them, then held them at his sides before settling on pockets.
Draco wasn’t in his usual spot when Harry stepped through. Instead of sitting on the floor, he was standing by the window, holding one curtain out. When he heard Harry, he let it fall, looking over his shoulder in masked surprise. “Hello,” he said.
All eyes turned to Harry. Ginny stopped eating. He did his best not to sink straight into the floor.
Draco swallowed, staring straight ahead with the mug still raised in front of his face. After a long moment, he took a sip.
Harry retreated to the corridor, and then down the steps to the parlor. There was still a fair amount of smoke when he opened the door and Summoned the Cloak, but it was nearly scentless.
He gripped the bottle like he knew what Harry was thinking. “Five hundred? That’s well out of bounds for a Beater.”
“My point, I guess, is that yeah, it took a long time for any of us to recover. But you never have. Not really, I don’t think. It took three years for you to even start laughing again. It was so scary to look at you sometimes, Harry. It’s like there was
Just as Harry closed his fingers around it, the watch flew through them and into Draco’s hand. The alarm went silent.
He’d lost his godfather in the second war, he learned. Ron almost completely skipped over it, just as he did when he got the part where his brother was killed. Then Teddy’s parents – Tonks and Lupin, he called them. Tonks was a metamorphagus. It explained Teddy’s blue hair in the photos.
“Morning,” he said, trying not to startle Hermione. She stood over the stove, already dressed for the day in black robes. The fabric was interesting, catching purple in the light. “You look nice.”
“I brought potions. He asked for them the last time, so…” She trailed off, stopping at the end of the bed.
“Charlie,” the short one said. The bespectacled one was Percy, Ron’s father was Arthur, the tall one and woman were Bill and Fleur. Harry did his best to commit each name to memory.
“You took it from him. After we were captured by the Snatchers, we fought our way out of the Manor. I’m not certain how you got ahold of it, but there it was. Yours was – was destroyed, so you kept it. Worked well enough.”
He was vaguely aware of the feathers flocking to Ron’s face, forming a beard and moustache. Ron was madly trying to fight them off, Hermione was desperately trying to get back inside, and Hagrid yelled for them to keep Butcher outside. But the
“SETTLE DOWN,” Minerva was saying into the wand, her stern voice doing absolutely nothing to quell the increasing rowdiness. “I
As Harry walked back down Diagon Alley, he almost thought he’d get back home without incident. Toward the brick wall that would take him back to the Leaky Cauldron, a bright flash of light forced his attention to an older woman in chartreuse robes. The second his eyes landed on her, she ducked through a door.
“Withdrawal for Mr. Potter,” a voice said sourly. A well-dressed goblin pushed into the room, a heavy bag in his hand.  It clanked as he set it down in Harry’s lap.
Draco glanced at the book disdainfully and leaned to the side, draping his watch against a book spine and writing something down with a large black quill. "How could I? I haven't read it."
“Makes sense.” Her eyes focused on things Harry couldn’t see. “Wards are Ministry erected. Last updated in ’99. Standard Triple-I – Invulnerability stratus was temporally dismantled. This room only.”
There was a short, awkward silence. Dean flinched like someone had kicked him under the table. “Yeah! Yeah. You’re the best Auror the Ministry’s seen in years.”
Draco leaned over the banister, looking down the hall where the heavy black curtains were billowing to either side of a truly horrendous portrait. He pointed his wand.
Hermione stepped back. He hadn’t even seen her get sucked in. Her head had to tip all the way back just to address him.
Ginny snorted. “Well, yes.” She nudged him with her shoulder. “Will you come see me play? The fourteenth, at Allen Bog.”
Castor remained on his rock, flaring his hood toward the kitchen, eyes focused on the intruder. But the intruder was focused on something else.
“We’re going to be fine,” Hermione said from between them. Her tone brooked no argument. “It’s hardly the worst thing that could have happened. You need to remember that.”
Harry cringed internally. It wasn’t how he wanted it to go when he… well, it wasn’t like the forest. There was no blood or desperation. Draco was all drawn and impenetrable, obviously tired but still on his guard.
“I – “ Draco touched the skin under his eye, then sniffed. “I have a natural predisposition to looking ill. Nothing for it.”
A massive crack echoed through the alley. It was so loud and sudden Harry didn’t know where to look, reaching for his wand. The very next instant, he heard Draco’s voice.
“I’m not really in…the middle of things right now. Everyone’s been wilting while we wait for – “ He stopped, frowning at what had just come out of his mouth. “I mean, it’s been scarious – “
“This walk gets longer every damned time,” Ron moped, face red as they climbed a steep incline. The well-trod trail bobbed and weaved over poking tree trunks. “I miss the Thestrals.”
Harry stepped back as soon as it seemed appropriate, bidding them goodnight. Hermione’s lip was trembling again as he shut the door, and he felt bad about it, but he needed to be alone.
Harry cajoled Ron into a restaurant instead of a pub. A small, out of the way sort of place. There was
“You’re not coming?” A stupid question. Harry should be seizing the chance to be in the library alone. He just doubted his ability to actually find his way up there.
“We ‘ave never talked about zis. From Bill, I understand your parents were quite rich. Your godfather also left you hiz vault – the Black family fortune.”
“We’ve been so worried,” Mrs. Weasley complained, levitating a forgotten piece of bread to his plate. “Imagine poor Teddy having to hear – “
Ron had on a thick black sweater and rain jacket, two plastic take-out bags balanced in his arms. His hair was wet, evidence of the rain that had struck up a while earlier.
The sweep of magic was nearly as strong as Hogwarts. Flames flickered to life all down the long hall, throwing weird shapes onto peeling once-blue patterned wallpaper. Ron had warned him against making loud noises in the entry.
Ron leaned on a forearm against the wall, the back of his hand pressed against his mouth while the other gripped his wand tightly, like he thought Death Eaters were going to jump out of the woodwork. Greenbaum raised an eyebrow, unaffected.
The weather stayed humid and drizzling, never quite warm enough to forgo a jumper. Hermione was distant. They obviously spent their mornings together, behind that mysterious black door, but aside from that she kept busy, ushering him into the lift right after Obliviating him. Remembering owl's name had only seemed to consternate her more. She never let on as to why.
The torches on the top floor burned brighter than before, but it was still silent as the grave. He undid the locking charms on Sirius’ door and went to the bookshelf, pulling one of the Transfiguration texts free.
Fluttering paper broke the tension as a memo shoved itself through the transom. Ron caught it out of the air, grimacing at whatever it said. “Residue’s legitimate.”
There. It was definitely a lie, but Harry could live with it. Ron worked through it with his expression, finally landing on baffled. “What’s it like?”
The bored twenty-something behind the check-out gave a thumbs up. George beckoned Harry up the steps, giving him a few seconds to take in the tea-and-biscuit flavored soap display as he pulled a keyring from his pocket and opened up a door.
Harry moved to help, ignoring the protests. He took Draco’s arm and draped it over his shoulder, drawing them both to their feet with a hand on Draco’s waist. He couldn’t even tell if Draco was trying to pull away from him or not, he was so weak.
Hermione was watching him. At the Weasleys’ that Sunday, she was at his shoulder or just across the room, barely speaking unless spoken to. Twice that week, she came to his house – despite the snake that so clearly terrified her – under the guise of bringing food or just sitting. It was driving him spare.
“It makes you shit yourself,” Harry guessed. George snapped his mouth closed. “Explosively. Absolutely not.”
“Not quite the sort of bonding Draco is talking about, though,” she continued, rubbing her temple with one hand. “Looking into the future was pointless, to the ancient Greeks, because it didn’t exist yet. They didn’t believe in pre-determination; the future was what they made of it. These
haven’t been here four weekends in a row since…I dunno, forever? It makes a difference, especially to Mum and Dad.”
George sighed, kicking off his shoes and shrugging out of the orange robes. He was wearing pajamas underneath. “The Wizengamot always agrees with me, in the end. They just like to kick up a fuss to make it look like they don’t need me.”
his family. He positively fawned over Victoire and wrote to Teddy more often than Harry got to. And he had Lee!
“I was thinking chicken sandwiches.” He started pulling the items needed from the fridge, feeling George’s stare on his back. “Are you hungry?”
was the final incantation, followed by Draco’s name. The colors in the room intensified, a very thin shudder went through what felt like the entire house, and then it all faded from view. The parlor was just a parlor again.
