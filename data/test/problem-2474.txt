“Pansy,” Draco reproves again, reaching across the table to take her hand.  “Granger only found out because Harry told her.”
He entered the manor with a few plans for how to tackle the core’s malfunctioning magic.  The majority of which involved use of his wand – but not all.
This is perhaps the role he was born for more than anything.  Curry, pasta, breads, seafood, and most sacred of all – the desserts.  Puddings, biscuits, trifles, and pies.  It feels like returning to Hogwarts in the best way to have so much food freshly made.  He gains about fifteen pounds before he realizes it.
“What?”  Harry prompts his son patiently, returning to the task of shaving.
Harry returns around mid-afternoon.  Draco had re-locked the attic door and spoken to the boys about not going there again.  Advising them that their father kept that door locked for a reason to protect them.  When asked about how they opened the door both boys became defensive.  Trying to hide how they did it.  Albus cracks after several moments of Draco patiently waiting.  Draco has found this a useful tactic.  His confession naturally upsets James who smacks his brother.  Draco sends them to their bedrooms to consider their actions.
It is not the nicest thing to side-along someone who isn’t expecting to apparate.  That’s happened to him more than once and it is unpleasant to say the least.  The sensation is not dissimilar to being dunked into a cold lake and simultaneously becoming nauseated.
“Is it true, what they say?”  Father questions suddenly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I'll be nice.”  Harry asserts, trying not to sound exasperated.  “I’m always nice.”
It is a couple days after Potter’s confession outside the bar.  Meeting at an outdoor café for lunch today.  Potter holds out Draco’s sandwich and drink for him to take.  Having kindly gotten their food from the counter.  They eat their meal in silence for a few minutes.  Continuing to people watch.  The young couple are intertwined again.  Noses touching.  Draco feels vaguely embarrassed to witness that even from several tables away.  How can people be so openly affectionate with each other?
when Harry had come back.
It was getting close to 10:30. Draco fiddled with the dial.
Harry peeked outside: no Malfoy in sight. He checked the time. It was well past ten-twenty. The git had been
Harry stood abruptly and walked into the kitchen to clean his plate at the sink. It was time to do the goddamn radio show. He didn’t stop, didn’t censor himself. This time, he just rambled on and on about his thoughts and Draco.
Lucius opened his bedroom door and stood in the middle of the room. “I suppose you want to know where the bottle is?”
Or the cornflower.
“This one’s from 1613. Mine husband and I hast been most worried about our son, young Felix. He plays exclusively in what can only be described as the most dangerous corners of the Manor, but after my lord and I discussed this over the morning meal…”
Harry had known Malfoy had been required to take some sort of muggle culture classes. This must have been from the teacher. He’d never heard of her.
So why wasn’t he there already?
“Elise hasn’t sent out the invitations this year, yet. The one from last year is still on the fridge,” Lydia said, nodding to card with a painted rooster on the front. She picked it off and handed it to Harry. “What do you think the theme will be? She always leaves hints in last year’s messages,”
“Pleasant memories?” Malfoy prodded, and his old schoolboy sneer crept back into his face. It almost made his eye bags disappear.
Harry really, really wanted to be an embarrassment. Honest, he did. But Narcissa made eye contact with him, cool grey eyes full of surprise, at first. Then she glanced over at Malfoy, then back to Harry. She softened a bit, gave him a bit of a smile. And Harry was so taken aback by the bit of a smile that was really just a slightly softer neutral expression that he forgot about being an embarrassment.
It made sense. “I’ll follow you,” he said.
Draco smirked. Mr Ager clearly teetered on the edge of snapping. With a few more creative letters, Draco would get him to send a vaguely threatening letter. Then, he could simply tip off a rival journalist on Mr Ager’s violent tendencies. The resulting article would potentially end Mr Ager’s career, or at least condemn it to
Campbell looked concerned. “Y’alright there, Harry?”
But after the trials, everything had somehow gone back to normal. Hermione went to school, like always. The Weasleys made delicious sunday dinners, as always. Ginny has loved him, as always.
“I came here to stop flithy Death Eater cocksuckers like you from poking their heads into places they don’t fucking belong. And what happened? You show up, chief of the filthy Death Eater cocksuckers–don’t act like you’re offended, Malfoy, anyone with half a brain knows you’re scum–and poke your pointy ferret face into my world,”
And then the memories Harry hadn’t realized he’d been holding back rushed into his mind.
Harry nodded. “You’re the one who wanted me to read this, anyway. I don’t see why I’m the highness here, your highness.”
“Really? That’s even more atrocious. Have you tried vinegar? Dilute it a bit, make sure you don't leave it on too long or the wood will rot,”
And then when Harry didn’t expect it, he went back into the cascading pattern of notes but without the darkness and tension of before. But Harry understood, watching that back hand, that the darkness would return soon.
Draco played with the idea of running away, maybe immigrating to the States. He could ask Lydia for some rips. He took a deep breath to steady himself and took Potter’s hand.
“Yeah. Sounds good, mate. Glad you’re getting on,”
“A coffee,” Draco repeated, insult on the tip of his tongue but he didn’t say it. Now, he sensed, was not a good moment. “I made one for you.”
Harry realized he would like to make Malfoy smile that way, be at ease that way.
He rustled through the cabinets to find the proper coffee strain and began preparing it. “Just dropping in?”
Draco pulled a face, but he felt his ears getting hot. Damn inbreeding, giving him these weaknesses. “Trust me, Blaise, seducing Potter is the last thing on my list. I’d rather seduce Albus Dumbledore,”
Potter’s brow furrowed. “I took several outfits from your closet at Campbell and Elise’s and brought them to mine. I hope you don’t mind,”
“So it can’t harm me much to know?” Draco prodded.
“Yeah,” Harry said, “Yeah. So how’ve you been? I still can’t believe I doubted you to pass that exam,”
It opened to the correct room: a grand dining hall that hadn’t been used in ages but was too stubborn to disappear entirely. Draco sighed in relief. This meant that only the rooms connected to the sun parlor/music room hallway had gotten lost. All Draco had to do, then, was find out where Lucius was and how to get there without using any of those rooms.
Probably Narcissa’s. He couldn’t imagine Malfoy getting good at any healing magic. But then again…
And what he wished to do was really not something to be repeated.
The dragons on the piano started to move. As Malfoy played, they swirled around. Malfoy would play two notes, then as he echoed them with a higher-pitched repetition the dragons responded. It was like that old animated muggle movie.
“In the bookshop,” Harry answered. He stood in the entryway for a few moments, unsure of what to do next. He gave a little wave to Campbell and then descended the stairs, leaving Malfoy to close the door. Hermione was waiting for them at the bottom.
Potter visibly tensed.
She didn’t wait for his answer.
They had absolutely noticed.
He washed and dried himself, then he went back to the living room.
She and Elise rushed out the door before Harry had the chance to narrow his eyes and declare he smelled a rat. He sighed, gave the dishes a quick scourgify, then flicked his wrist to send them to the correct cabinets.
A popping noise from the store filled him with both fear and relief.
“I don’t have to stay,” Draco said.
“My friend Rolf is studying them. I’m just rounding them up for him, you know. He’s a Scamander. Very odd man,”
Harry had been sitting in the crumbling study staring at his last trainee exam, which he’d failed spectacularly. It was late at night or early in the morning, maybe both. He’d been shut in there for two days, dreading his return to the Auror Academy on Monday. Some bloody Savior he was, defeated by a multiple choice exam on apparition licensing laws, of all things. It should have been easy. Ron hadn’t even studied.
Draco nodded. “She shared with me some… rather upsetting news the other day that greatly impacts her–our position,”
There was dirt everywhere.
The sunlight gleamed through the windows, taunting him.
But if only Luna had taught him how to cook.
Malfoy just sighed and held out his arm. “I guess you’ll just have to figure that out.”
“Of course. Do you have any of that Kona type?” She adjusted her kneazle earrings. They smelled like they were made of real kneazle fur.
back to the fun stuff! no more angsty bullshit for a few more chapters at least.
Malfoy seemed to be having a similar reaction and barked something in French from behind his magazine.
‘Now that you’ve gone and died they think they can sell the Manor to cover their salary increases. Disgusting, I know. And I know this is a huge favor, but I need a word, just a little measly letter with a lock of your hair or something to identify it and tell them the Boy Who Lived thinks they’re arseholes. Easy right?’
“Of course, Potter. I’m starting a coffee shop. Would a death eater drink coffee?”
Weasley rubbed his ear. “Did you ask me something, Malfoy?”
“Don’t push your luck, Potter. You’re lucky I’m playing for you. I haven’t practiced in years and I’ll probably need sheet music,” Malfoy said.
All the mugwumps were gathered now. Mother had taken a seat at a bench only a couple rows behind them, auror squadron back and seated at her left, right, front, and back.
Thanks!
“Was that all you’d ever hoped for?” He asked, sarcasm pulling at the corners of his eyes.
“Wouldn’t what? He was attacked on our property, by your father. Missing for a year or not he’s a powerful wizard, Draco, and I fear you may have forgotten that,”
“Yes,” he said.
Pansy was nodding along. “So, darling, what’s the first plan of attack? Groveling? Money? A good old seduction?”
“One moment,” Draco said. He summoned his French press and Blue Mountain beans. He didn’t need any more bitterness this morning, so the Jamaican Arabica was perfect. Weasley fidgeted as Draco ground the beans with a charm and poured them into the press. Using a modified
The call with his father had gone about as well as expected. In summary, Lucius had demanded he come back to the Manor at once, to which Draco had closed the floo to him.
‘Because I actually talk to her, Potter,’”
Or manipulation.
Malfoy seemed to have gone into some sort of trance when Harry had asked him. He thought about snapping his fingers, waving his hand in front of Malfoy’s face. He could still do that, he figured, despite injured arms and fingers. His right arm was already feeling a lot better, and he didn’t need fingers to wave. And he could snap with his right hand perfectly fine, anyway.
“Because Victor was so in love with his first wife, right? It was like all the love in his life went to one person and so when she left he was left without any. And every week he went to Georgia to get flowers to put on his wife’s grave. He did this every week for years. And Georgia began to worry about Victor’s wallet, so she started giving him the bouquets at discounted prices, and they started talking and they became acquaintances and so on. And poor Victor realized he had begun having feelings for Georgia.
It couldn’t be
“I’m Elise. Nice to meet you,” She stuck out a hand, then retracted it when she realized it was covered in paint.
Potter might be trying to get back here. He might have gotten caught up in some sort of neo-Death Eater scheme. Yaxley. Was Yaxley still around? Draco hadn’t been paying much attention around the time of the trials. Wait. Yaxley was dead. Wasn’t he?
Draco switched to French as well.
He apparated straight into the kitchen of his flat. A pair of large blue eyes greeted him barely centimeters from his own.
she asked.
The iron-wrought gate closed behind Draco, and he started up the drive.
Harry would probably have cream cheese.
Sun was setting.
“No! Thank you. No, I’ll survive. You’re probably right,” He said, ending the call. Even if Harry Potter was really living out in Abford, which he strongly suspected was the case, it would be disrespectful to out his location to the rest of the wizarding world. Draco already owed him enough, honestly. As for the supposed Caribbean island, Draco had a gut feeling that was a ruse. Potter, despite his many, many, many flaws, had a particular dislike for paparazzi of any sort and would no doubt send them on a wild goose chase as far away as possible. Intentionally misleading his supposed best friend, however, would be a new sort of sin for Potter.
Harry ducked into the alley and apparated directly into his house. He summoned an old pair of extendable ears and apparated back. “Miss me, dog?”
Draco couldn’t find the answer. The puzzle piece was missing.
Harry had to fight the urge to slam open the bathroom door and deliver a stinging hex to Malfoy’s nethers so potent the git couldn’t sit down for weeks.
...This whole thing has gotten me rather fucked up, I think. Clearly, we’re both in the wrong and just playing chicken about who’s the wrong-est. Or at least that’s what he thinks. I don’t see a way I could have been in the wrong, I mean, you should have seen the way he was looking at me through that whole day. No, that whole week before it happened. It was like I was a bowl of squash soup and he’d been out all day shoveling autumn leaves all day. It’s the same way Stella looks at green beans, honestly. But then he’d look away…
He couldn’t remember the last time he had been down here. It had to have been in the past week or so. It had to. But he couldn’t remember which day, or what time.
“You’re holding my hand,” he said.
Gabrielle Delacour, despite having been pictured only twice, had the papers in uproar. Was a Potter/Delacour marriage possible? He saved her at the Triwizard when he was fourteen (which was basically lifelong love).
Someone had given Draco a gift. Someone had had faith in Draco. Draco had been his teacher’s favorite.
His mother shot him the same glare she used on him when he was seven years old and complaining about not getting a third dessert. “
Harry took a seat on Campbell and Elise’s sofa, ready to digest their latest gossip. Hardly any of it was more than speculation, but Harry liked the rhythm. Harry liked predictability.
As he talked he let his right hand drift to the seam on the outer side of Potter’s jeans, toying with it.
And where the hell were the Mums? Harry pulled on his trainers and opened the door to the bookshop. He looked down, and Campbell and Elise were just sitting in a corner reading. Elise was in the middle of whispering something to Campbell. Harry cleared his throat.
...I think Stella misses him. I think I miss him. He needs to explain why he ran out like that…
She was watching him stare dumbly at the bed, not moving but wanting to do a million things at once. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked, the words falling from his mouth like the dust in the sunlight before him.
Draco spent the next day puttering around the future coffee shop. He’d cast the anti-dust and anti-pest charms, so the bones of the shop were set. Hours were spent laying plans for the furnishings and kitchening supplies, and he returned to Elise and Campbell’s home late that night. Or, he supposed, their home was really beginning to feel a little bit like his.
She winced. “It may be over a month. I’ll see what Ron can do to stop the Aurors from the inspection, but we need a larger campaign. Ron mentioned to me…”
And they sat on the phone, not saying anything.
Harry gave Malfoy a glare and Alexandre a smile.
“Wonderful progress, dear,” Elise said, joining them. “It took the other one nearly a week to even eat at ours,”
“I was just making lunch, if you’d like to stay for it.”
He picked up one of his letters. It was an apology from the aurors about his furniture. Draco
“Alexandre!” Malfoy said, then began speaking in rapid French. The man (presumably Alexandre) greeted him with a kiss on both cheeks and spoke to him in kind.
Potter pulled some sort of a rude face, but before Draco could properly analyze it, his entire body folded in on itself like a telescope and was shoved through a pneumatic tube that sent him straight into Potter’s kitchen. Actually, he wasn’t, but Potter had graciously apparated them both without telling Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In case you haven’t noticed, there’s not a supermarket around here. Luckily, most of us shopkeepers have discounts for the regulars who just want to eat instead of buy novelty goods,” Elise said.
Draco was finding that Potter’s relationships were of immense speculation to front-page news and tabloids alike. Every so often Draco came across a spread of Potter in various locations with various women. Occasionally he looked disheveled, but more often than not it seemed Potter was simply having a nice lunch with a friend.
Draco gave him a small smile as he took the other side of the folder. Harry looked up, into Draco’s eyes, giving him a shining smile. Draco looked down, the flush from finishing the piece still present. His breathing hitched and Draco’s lips relaxed and parted. Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was leaning in or if he was, but the darkening look in Draco’s eyes told him all he needed to know.
Malfoy had excellent pinkie fingers. They were confident, just as confident and nimble as his other ones, but retained the elegance he would expect from Malfoy, who had been surrounded by grandeur his whole childhood. His other fingers followed in the same suit. Harry watched how Malfoy’s knuckles danced with the music, and he wasn’t sure if they were guiding his fingers or if they moved as a consequence of his fingertips’ dexterity.
Campbell brought out three plates of pasta with red sauce and set them on the table. “Draco, I’m going to be very frank with you,”
“What if she’s not around?”
“You better listen close, Potter. I’m not some sort of windup monkey you can ask to play as a party trick,”
Harry felt his face go red. Luckily, his house was only a few metres away and he scurried up to the door.
When he was younger, he had one rule: if someone asks you to stay for a meal, you take it.
Draco stood just in front of the door, unsure what to do with his hands or how to make his presence known.
Draco pet the larger of the sheep. It nuzzled into his hand. He heard a crunch and turned to see the other sheep eating out of his packed lunch.
This wasn’t right.
“Your mother must be good at reading lips,” Potter said.
“What?” Malfoy looked up sharply from the pots and pans he was anally arranging so their handles all pointed in the same direction. “Of course I eat! I just haven’t gotten groceries in a few days,”
But Harry picked up the phone.
She shook her head. “I started with the rooms furthest away because I figured if Mr. Potter got anxious, he would attempt to find his way back to the sun parlor. If he was badly injured, he would be unable to reach the sun parlor and therefore would not be in any of the surrounding rooms,”
She gave him a hug. “Chicken parm. And do take your shoes off before coming in. Aina just vacuumed,”
Draco listened to her prattle on about North American Prairie flowers for the next half hour. It certainly wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, but it wasn’t unwelcome either. Draco would much rather head about the healing properties of sunflowers than have to move again after a well-meaning witch hexes his bollocks off for flouncing his death eater face about.
“I don’t have–” Draco would protest, trying to draw her attention toward taking the piss out of him instead of seeing right through his problems with frightening clarity.
Harry stood up, and brushing some dirt off his jeans, headed into the house. It was nearly lunchtime, wasn’t it? He glanced at the clock. 10:30. Close enough. The basil plant on the kitchen sink was looking fresh today. Malfoy would like a primavera pizza. It sounds posh, but is actually just the thing normal people order at a fancy pizza place.
Draco could do nothing but watch the ground as Harry Potter approached him. Potter was looking at the dog.
Harry was tempted to ask Malfoy why he couldn’t have just said so, but then he realized something. “That’s just what happened with Lucius, isn’t it? Lucius wanted us all to be hidden from each other, so the rooms all switched around.”
“Oh, yes. The real breadwinner of the Potter family: butternut squash,” he said, fiddling with the number four key.
Campbell rose. “And I’ll get back to making us a dinner.”
The silence was unimpressed.
So what the hell had just happened?
“Do you play?” Potter asked, relaxing.
Did Malfoy like pears?
Draco made the mistake of wandering somewhere near the exit.
“And who else?”
“Of course, dear,” Elise said. “What type of stationery would you prefer?”
He rummaged around in his expanded bag for parchment and a pen. The first letter he wrote told his dear friend Mr. Ager to apply for a job transfer. The second was a lovely flowchart of what would happen if someone were to ruin his reputation. It started with a Rita Skeeter exposé and ended with him spying on innocent men in the shower. Draco had always figured it was best to insinuate strangers were bent, since if they weren’t they would be paranoid about emasculation and if they were, they would be paranoid that someone found out. Either way, it struck them in a vulnerable place. Even Draco would be somewhat unnerved if he received an anonymous letter that confirmed his sexuality.
Harry slid his arms into the body of his shirt. “Alright then, princess,”
hi!! this chapter is a little shorter than I usually do, but there's been a lot of things happening and I really wanted to get this one out as soon as I heard about jk rowlings latest bull shit.
Draco swallowed. “Because I don’t want it. I’d never live there, and cruel as I am, I wouldn’t want the Manor to just crumble from disuse. What we need is a new bloodline to shift Malfoy Manor to, and we need to do it before the reinspection is due. When is that, again?”
from Malfoy. Flute
“You’re a little shit,” Malfoy said, picking up the book and thumbing through the pages.
Then Draco retreated to a corner of the room to sort through more papers in silence. Narcissa watched him with an unreadable expression. Then she turned her gaze to Harry, who refused to cower or blush. That was a lie. He didn’t cower, but he could feel the hot blush rising out of his chest and spreading across his neck and cheeks.
Should he go for a ‘what’s up?’ Is that you greet your best friend after you’ve been away for over a year? Should he ask about Hermione? He said nothing else.
He could hold it again, for appearance’s sake, surely. And quite unconsciously, his hand snaked back into Potter’s.
A cool wash of magic flowed over him. He whipped around. Malfoy was there, but before Harry could demand an explanation he hissed:
“Sorry about all that, before,” Potter said into the bowl of soup.
“I have no idea,” Harry said. “What do you think?”
“Malfoy!” He greeted, smiling professionally. “I trust you’ve seen the paper?”
“He would be rolling in his grave or whatever they put him in. Don’t know if he ever had a funeral, poor bugger,”
“Don’t be a tit. You were more than half in love with him for years.” She took a drink of her tea and a mischievous look appeared on her face. “Oh, Pansy,” she said in a whiny, high-pitched voice. “Did you see the look on Potter’s face when I told him his hair could be curly and luscious and beautiful? But it isn’t because his mum died before she could show him how? Oh, the conflict of emotion! He looked so angry, Pansy, so angry that I finally told him about how much I wanted to run my grubby little spoiled fingers through that staticky load of–”
“How.” Potter grit out. “Did Mister Orion. N. Ager. Know where to find me?” His eyes bored into Draco and the man seemed to grow a good six inches.
Luna must have borrowed it from someone. Probably Ginny.
They laughed. It was nice, like this. Talking like normal people, about normal things. Pansy had been Draco’s emotional support since, well, forever. Even a year ago their conversations (when they had them) were all angry or sad. Now some sense of normalcy had fallen back into place, an occurrence Draco was continually grateful for.
“No, no. It’s not that. There’s another thing,”
He went to Campbell and Elise the next day, and he was already spilling out the story before he crossed the threshold into their apartment.
“No, I’m sorry for making you feel like you had to lie to me. Harry, I was your best friend,”
Had Potter… quoted..?
Elise raised her eyebrows and a hint of something appeared in the corners of her eyes that might have been delight. “How so?”
Draco paced through the halls of the west wing, trying to locate her. She was looking for Potter. His patronus hadn’t returned to him, so she had definitely gotten his message. But he hadn’t gotten a swan in return so she couldn’t have found Potter already.
Draco walked over, and Harry tried not to count it as a success yet. He leaned over Harry so he could smell the citrusy clean scent of his hair. He pointed to the orange jar.
Then Malfoy’s leg moved. Harry heard the lid above him shift, and the light was back. Harry looked through his peephole to watch Malfoy sit at the bench of the grand piano in the center of the room. It’s blocked by the piano, but Malfoy’s looking at something on the key-cover. He’s inspecting something thoroughly, which was strange because Harry couldn’t remember sheet music or anything to note resting on the piano.
Malfoy, too, seemed calmed by the shift in tone. His moody expression cleared, and he looked quite angelic. The soft light enveloped his features, once pointy, now invitingly sharp so that he looked not like some simple human, but like a divine being creating a world with his fingers and his piano and his dragons. Harry had never been all that religious, but if Malfoy had looked up to him in that moment and told him he was a lower deity, nothing all that special but with a few extra powers, Harry would have no reason to doubt him.
They weeded for an hour or so in silence. If George noticed that Harry seemed to be moving through his garden at a much faster rate than seemed possible, he didn’t say anything. And when Harry noticed that George had started sweating a bit, he didn’t say anything, either. He just stood up and cracked his back with a sigh, and an offhand comment about how weeding too much in one day can upset the soil.
But he’d never had the Manor’s magic used against him, albeit subconsciously.
A note was stuck over the rest of the speech. He tried to pull it, but found it was magically stuck. So he unstuck it, then pulled it off.
Granger had a total tally of fifteen relationship speculations, despite her rather public relationship with Weasley.
Cleaning with magic was simple, but adding the proper appliances was another matter. It would be difficult charm-work to weave in spells that would allow his brewing to harness magical energy, but in such a way that the muggles would never think something was amiss.
But Harry wasn’t finished. “He just doesn’t understand that people are around to help him, you know? I’d be surprised if he’d even take a tissue from someone without trying to pay it back. He just tries to refuse anything anyone ever gives him. Then when you think you’ve figured it out, he gets all cold on you,”
Harry nodded distractedly. “Of course, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m doing everything I can. Thank you for your concern.” He went to shake her hand, but she held it out elegantly. Harry compromised by squeezing it lightly.
Malfoy jumped about four feet in the air and his papers shuddered, a flapping noise filling the room for a second before Malfoy’s feet hit the floor. He stared at Harry, who grinned back.
Draco nodded and the swan disappeared. He tried the door; it was unlocked. He opened it, and just as his mother said, it opened into an improper location. In this case, the ballroom. He ran across the room, shoes clacking on the marble floors, to open the door on the other side.
“Huh?” Harry asked. Sure, Malfoy had a nice voice for reading, but he couldn’t say he’d retained much of what he’d said.
“Here’s your package, sir.” The boy awkwardly handed the large box to him.
Malfoy calls him into his home, presumably, and offers Harry an afternoon completely wasted. Then the reporter shows up (if what that idiot does can be considered reporting) and he gets kidnapped? Harry had a right to be angry. He had a right to storm home and never seen Malfoy again.
(See the end of the chapter for
So Draco did.
The tone of the music shifted yet again, and the dragons’ energy did as well. It was softer, now, and the dragons seemed to be lulled to sleep, their bellies rising and falling in time, their eyes slowly drooping down.
Draco scrambled for the floo powder.
“In that case, I would like to extend a formal apology on behalf of the Auror department that your image was taken and produced without your express consent, and–”
“Goodbye, Draco,” she said, looking directly into her son’s eyes. “The next time you come here, we will have found what we’ve been searching for. I have faith that the Manor will be ours for good and whatever you’ve stirred up in Mr. Potter will have settled to a companionable level.”
He took a deep breath. “Campbell, Elise? Would you mind helping me compose a letter?”
The floo rang again.
“He’s here in accordance with the old laws, you know. It’s his choice,” Draco said before Potter could spout any house-elf rights rhetoric.
“That’s not what I mean and you know it. There’s no way you’ll get to apologize for leaving dirty dishes in the sink if you don’t apologize for getting scared like a little bitch and running away,” She’d say, almost bored, not looking at him, digging dirt out of her fingernails and rolling it into little pills with magic before vanishing it.
The street was paved, but the cobblestones were covered with a layer of dirt capable of stealing a shoe. Draco cast a buoyancy charm. Two kilos.
Bathroom. Hair. Go.
She looked behind her, then Harry saw the tears in her eyes and regretted his choice in tone.
“No reason. Just wondering. You’re doing well, yeah?”
“I’m not going to rise to your bait, Pansy,” He drew his head away from her fingers and stood up, taking a dramatic pose. “I’m a mature intellectual,”
The rest of the session passed like so: move, parry, countermove, parry, hit. And so on.
Hermione shook her head. “I actually kind of expected this,” she said, wiping her eyes. “God, I wish I wouldn’t get this worked up. Anyway, let’s have some pizza now, yeah?”
Narcissa nodded grimly. “The only reason they didn’t take the Manor before was because of the trial,”
Draco leaned into the reflection, and saw his own reflection staring back. His reflection’s gaze didn’t linger long on him, though, as Draco shifted his eyes to Potter’s.
“I’d bet you’d rise to Potter’s bait,” She said, waggling her eyebrows suggestively.
That wasn’t true at all. He reconsidered.
Draco tried not to eye it, he really did. But he took the moment and snatched the wand. Potter’s eyes widened with something like surprise. Maybe it was disappointment.
Harry sighed, then turned off the water and finished up in the bathroom.
Harry swallowed. He hadn’t thought that far. “I can’t hold a book,” he said, the words dribbling out of his mouth like a waterfall. “Both hands out of commission. Remember?”
“Yeah. I’ll come see you all soon. Maybe Christmas?”
This was exactly what Pansy has wanted him to do.
“What the hell’s in these, anyway?” Potter asked, seemingly unperturbed.
Potter nearly fell over and had his wand out, a reducto probably ready on his lips, arm out to shield Draco from its effects. So sweet, Draco almost regretted having to tell him what it might do.
Then Harry had noticed he wasn’t blinking.
“A lot of what? My feelings?”
“And that’s not the Ministry?” Blaise said.
Elise had finished setting out the last fork when Harry sat down.
Of course, he thought as he began mixing ingredients in the soup pot, he could clearly stand to let a few things get his way. Draco, for instance. If he had bloody thought about it before kissing Draco, if he’d just asked before doing it, maybe they wouldn’t be in this mess right now.
“I’m pretty sure Lydia has it under control, but I’ll stop by today or tomorrow,” he said, and just like that, the conversation shifted. Malfoy was seemingly forgotten.
An article dated a week later caught him sleeping on a bench at the park. Is The Boy Who Lived Without A Home?, the caption wondered.
His feet carried him out the door and into the still unsatisfyingly tepid weather and across town. Campbell’s and Elise’s bookshop came into view, and passed out of it. He hadn’t even stopped. They weren’t the right people. His feet knew.
He cast a muffliato over her and together they leaned into the side of the building. He sent the extendable ears snaking up the side of the shop towards the window.
Over the course of the next few days he continued to putter around doing nothing in particular.
“Nah, just died in his sleep. You’ve gone all funny looking. Did you know him?”
Draco sent his patronus, the she-jackal scampering off to his mother with two words:
The hippogriffs took one look at him and raised their hooves to knock at the door.
“Yes, you did,”
She sat the large bowl of pasta in the center of the table for all to admire. Which Harry did, before serving himself a rather large portion.
2. If two people have the same patronus, it can be due to either coincidence or an all-consuming obsession with the other.
And maybe Potter had a stash of muscle-relaxing potion in his bathroom.
They say in silence for so long, Draco started counting the seconds. He had just made it to four hundred ninety two when Lydia finally boiled over.
“You too, Weasley.” Draco said, ending the call. He found he meant it.
“Who, Potter?”
He opened the door and Hermione gasped. “How come you didn’t tell me about this sooner?” she demanded, taking in the ceiling-to-floor shelving and quirky decor.
“You ever made a pizza, ‘Mione?” He asked, interrupting her.
Narcissa stood, walked towards him, wrapped her arms around him in a hug. It was probably warm, but Draco didn’t feel it. “I know, darling. Remember, a Malfoy has a silver tongue-”
He slid down the door to sit on the tile floor.
Victor leaned against the thirty-year-old cash register. “So a family is a premature grandfather and a mutt?”
“Hello, er- again. It’s me. My therapist is making me do this and all that. I just got off the phone with one of my mates from school. It’s Carrot’s girlfriend, Perdita. No, that’s not her real name. Yes, I’ve read Shakespeare. There’s not a lot to do in an empty house, you know?”
Two minutes later (precisely two, that is. Pansy was nothing if not precise) two magazines articles arrived at the window.
“Thanks,” he said. She nodded.
“Go on, then, Potter. We don’t have all day,” Malfoy said. He took a seat in a white wicker chair in the corner of the room.
“Fortunately, yes. I think it would be rather rude to have stolen someone else’s artwork and then hung it up in my home,” She had an urban Irish accent. “What are you planning on doing with the shop?”
“Hush, I was trying to be polite!” Pansy mock-whispered.
Blaise’s green-cast face disappeared for a minute. Soon, it reappeared, but attached to a body standing in Draco’s poor excuse for a living room. Luckily, short hair was currently
And he just laughed. “Tell that to them, Malfoy. And it’s not like you’d do anything to stop them. Am I wrong?”
He threw floo powder in the fireplace, then checked the clock. It was only 4, so still office hours.
They arrived in an apparition room Harry wasn’t familiar with. The ones he’s been taken to had always looked at least somewhat comfortable, with sofas and nice color schemes, but this room had no furniture to speak of and was painted a permanently dirty beige. Looking down, he noticed it matched the color choices of the carpeted floor. How nice. It smelled of dust and something burnt.
How was Draco going to repay this one? Because to his count, Potter was at 3 and Draco only had 2.
Toujours Pur. Kreacher would be furious. He’d probably walk in any second now and chastise Harry for destroying precious Black artifacts. Then Harry would feel guilty. Or maybe he wouldn’t. But he’d know that he should feel guilty, which was basically the same thing, right?
Fun fact! Snow White in German is Sneewitchen. Kind of loses its charm, don't you think?
“Woah there, girl. I’m heading out the door right now, I promise,”
He munched it, sitting on the countertop. It wasn’t bad, all things considered. Those things being that there was no butter (not even margarine), no jam, no cinnamon, and no cream cheese. Draco rather liked cream cheese, plebian as it was. He sighed.
“Half-past two,” she replied.
Draco nodded.
Draco just about jumped out of his skin. “Ten-ish?! Mother is expecting us at eleven!” He struggled with the ground and the brick wall behind him again. Potter looked at him again, with an amused but not at all pitying look Draco wasn’t familiar with and didn’t like all that much. See, Potter’s eyes squinted in the squinty sort of way his eyes did after laughing at a joke, and the corner of mouth toyed with the rest of his face, threatening to pull it into a smile. And Draco definitely didn’t like the way Potter wrapped his arms around him and hoisted him into the air. It was simply atrocious, the way Potter’s warm body made him act like a cat dozing in a sunbeam.
Draco looked over. “What did she send you?” he asked.
Draco stared at it. Then he took it. “Yes, Potter. We can be friends, if that’s what your little Hufflepuff heart wants.”
He took it. It was dusty. Her warm eyes crinkled, betraying years of crows feet in the corners.
Two kilometers.
After all, if someone came along and asked for Grimmauld Place, he’d sell it to them. Hell, he’d even give it away for free to the right person. The whole place was a little more than a trash heap, especially since Kreacher wasn’t there to care for it.
Malfoy turned around. “Why not?”
“It’ll be the first they go after. Other than that, I dunno. Do you want me to connect you to Hermione?” Weasley asked.
“And what would you two wizened old layabouts want?” he asked.
Nothing like that voice to throw a metaphorical bucket of ice-water over Draco’s hypotheticals. “Y-yeah. Where’s the, er, bathroom?” Draco asked weakly.
Draco could picture it so clearly.
His mother received him in the parlor, he noticed, rather than the drawing room.
“Whatever you’re having,”
Granger? Weasley really just suggested that Draco talk to Hermione Granger about saving the Manor she was tortured in. Interesting.
The average person walked five kilometres per hour. That meant he should be at Potters house in approximately 24 minutes.
Draco leaned forward.
Harry felt his cheeks heat, and thanked his father’s ancestors for his dark skin.
They shared a look. It was a good look, though. One that wasn’t full of pity, but something like pride.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. He raised his wrists above the keyboard, letting tension gather in his fingers. Then he let them fall, a succession of dark chords playing. As soon as one began to ring, the next one began.
“Whazza verdict?” he asked, looking up at Hermione.
By 2:00 today, Lucius Malfoy would realize Draco was not going to be attending the traditional Malfoy Saturday lunch.
“‘Potter, I thought you’d never acknowledge it! I really did think all that stalking was for naught. But how should I know my schoolboy crush was finally requited? I’m so glad you decided to listen to reason,”
“Lucky enough, you have all the pieces right here. It’s just they’re all broken or in the wrong place. Shouldn’t take me more than an hour or two to fix, if you have an hour or two to spare. Lydia!”
“Alright, there?” Harry asked.
“Merlin-fucking… hell!” Malfoy was shouting at a few mismatched pots and pans. Then he looked up. “Oh, hello Potter,” he said sheepishly.
She turned though, right as she was about to leave. “And Draco?”
“Mind telling me who you belong to? I’m looking for Potter, if you know him, and I need all the allies I can get.” He stopped petting it for a second, and the dog pawed him impatiently. It barked again.
Draco didn’t say anything. Yes, maybe they had no right to mob Potter like that, but it was Potter’s fault. If he hadn’t run away and actually given a decent press release for once, maybe the ordinary person wouldn’t be so excited when the Savior showed up.
She gave all the airs of nonchalance. “I just thought you would’ve found some articles interesting, is all,” she said with a shrug. “It’s getting late. Until next time, darling.”
George was fiddling with an old vcr in the front room. “Grandfather, Harry’s in for tea,” she said.
Harry felt his face heat as he realized the mistake.
A day passed.
“Yes,” she said simply, meeting his eyes. “He’s quite lonely. Could do with a friend,”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nice flat,” she said, musical voice bouncing off the near-empty cabinetry of the kitchen. “Shame about the Squoggles, though,”
sorry this was a little later than i would've liked... i've been OBSESSED with good omens for the past several weeks and have been devoting all of my time to it. anyways, y'all will meet harry sometime i promise
Oh, thank Merlin Draco’s conscience was back to criticizing Potter.
Draco nodded. “Fine, fine!” His voice sounded too high. “I just used to know someone by that name. Probably not the same person, though,” He laughed forcefully.
“Who?” Harry asked, walking into their small kitchen. It was Wednesday lunch, and he was right on time. The Mums (he called them privately) were usually discussing someone or other they had run into or gotten a call from or offended recently.
Thank Merlin for the 6 sane ones.
But a door loomed at the end of the hall, wooden with hippogriffs chiseled into it. It was the door to Lucius’s study, but this wasn’t the hallway it belonged to.
“The piano’s much too respectable to be caught gambling with anyone, much less reckless pretty-boy war heroes who disappear off to fuckass, Scotland, and have the daily habits and lifestyle of an eighty-five year-old retired professor,” Draco said, sniffing imperiously.
Harry took it upon himself to look in Malfoy’s refrigerator. There were about three slices of cheese and some crusty-looking onions. He looked at the counter space Malfoy was using to see if there was any more, but all he saw was the squash.
Nothing of the sort had ever happened. “I had been training them to eat daisies on sight, since a mutual enemy of ours had recently planted a daisy-bed. But I had forgotten she sent you some potted ones, which were on the floor in the kitchen,” Draco said, trying to sound embarrassed. “I trained the sheep too well and she bolted inside, but wouldn’t come out,”
“Sorry, what?”
At the same time Pansy let out a forced laugh. “The problem is they can blame us. Ugly, inbred purebloods who’ve been shitting on everybody else for centuries,”
It was Wednesday and he couldn’t very well apparate into the Mum’s house, given they were muggles. He could imagine their faces if he suddenly appeared in the spare bedroom or something. Campbell would demand where he came from and Harry could never lie to her. Elise, on the other hand, would just pretend she remembered him walking in. He smiled to himself.
Lucius’s eyes flicked up to Draco, then his face twisted together in a mixture of anger and confusion. “You’re with
Harry sighed, a heavy sigh that meant he didn’t really mean the heaviness of it, and that he would continue to pick up Hermione’s slack whenever she allowed him.
“We should suggest it next time we see him around,”
He snorted. “What, nuance? You’re going to need some assistance reading this if that’s a big word to you,”
She did, of course.
I'm letting yall know that I do not support it or her. i haven't supported her since the cursed child came out, and I also do not support terfs.
Surprise, of course, was why Draco didn’t protest when Potter started carrying him, bridal style, around to the front of his store. He was outraged, he was scandalized. He wasn’t at all enjoying the experience, and any appreciation for Potter’s toned arms and pecs was grudging.
Harry walked home, plotting. He knew what Malfoy had said in the shower. That had certainly seemed like he was rehearsing for something. When Malfoy was picking out jumper colors, he had also said something about Harry’s color preferences. How did Malfoy even know his color preferences? It wasn’t like he hated green. His bloody eyes were green! Plants were green. Hell, Harry even had green jumpers. And besides, he didn’t think red was a Gryffindor color. Even though it was. If you went to Hogwarts and weren’t a Gryffindor, you basically aren’t allowed to wear red. It’s the rules. He shook his head to clear himself of that train of thought.
Potter would say he had been a spoiled, too-smart little snot. Yes, that’s exactly what Potter would say.
One last look in the mirror, then Harry undressed and took a shower.
“I sold you the place,” He said, looking like he was making a real effort to keep from rolling his eyes.
Draco remained silent.
“Oh, piss off,” Elise retorted lovingly. “Anyway, whenever I sent him Easter flowers he shredded them,”
81.9 (FM)
“Of what…” Harry started to ask, then Alexandre pulled out his wand and a rack of robes slid in through the door.
“Potter’s here. You know him. He’ll hex first, ask questions later. I can’t-” Draco swallowed. He could hear his heartbeat pumping through the blood vessels in his ears. “You have to move me,”
She started out of her sleep at the sound of her name and looked at him curiously.
“Draco, how lovely you should be playing again. I’d missed it,” Narcissa said.
Harry laughed. “How do you forget I wear glasses? That’s nearly half of my personality,”
“He left,” his mother’s voice said, strong, rooted, elegant. And then he registered Narcissa sitting on her antique chair, embroidering a robe.
“Heart and soul, I dunno,” Harry said, mesmerized by the sudden fire alight in Malfoy. He was pushing him, Harry knew, but what was the worst that could happen? Malfoy wouldn’t play piano for him? Please. Malfoy loved to show off too much, and if Harry seemed to vastly underestimate his abilities then he’d play a more complicated piece.
Draco dropped his toast on the floor. He knew how to solve the Manor’s case. But he’d be damned if he was about to do it on a nearly-empty stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
She curled her lip. “Sleeping, I presume,”
He’d dug his grave, time to fake his death.
He pulled a face.
He was fifteen. Fucking fifteen and being accused of improper use of magic. Umbridge’s little giggle tormented him from behind rows of mugwumps.
She patted the stool. It was the intense sort of green that gave you a headache if you looked at it too closely. “Take a seat. And didn’t he say you wouldn’t even have to talk to him? Just send an owl to the Wizengamot and tell them to stall the enforcement of the re-inspection bill. You won’t even have to see Draco. Here, I’ll help you write it,”
Harry opened the folder. Inside was a handwritten leaf of parchment, detailing in perfect cursive some sort of story. Judging from the title, it was the story of Scheherazade. Harry would read it. Really, he would, but he wanted to watch Malfoy play.
“Come to think of it,” Elise said, handing him a bag of mixed vegetables she had bought for him. “You remind me more and more of the other boy we fixed up,”
Pansy sighed, took a drink of the firewhiskey. She offered the bottle to Blaise, who declined.
“I’m still living in my house,” Potter was quoted as saying. The writer speculated this was simply a front, and our beloved Savior’s home had been ransacked by vicious death eaters. Draco had to scoff at that; all the ex-death eaters were either laying low out of the country or in Azkaban. With the exception of him, of course. And his father, who was confined to house arrest more or less indefinitely.
i'm having a grand ol time writing this (still) and reading your comments motivates me so much y'all don't even know.
They had all finished the chicken when Campbell stood up. “I think I left some cash in the register downstairs. Elise, do you mind coming with me? Harry, if you could finish the washing-up, that would be great,”
Harry smiled. “I will,”
“Scheherazade,” Malfoy said, picking up the now-empty folder and floating it over to Harry. “The piece is an arrangement of Scheherazade. I learned it for my summer recital before fifth year.”
His phone rang.
“Is he in bed?” She asked.
Harry shoved another forkful of Campbell’s noodles into his mouth.
Harry had laughed in relief and told him to stop playing around, come upstairs, Harry’d made a huge mess of things. But Kreacher didn’t move.
A few days later, Harry had testified for Narcissa. She saved his life, he saved hers. Ashe had gotten one year in prison, a permanent Trace to detect Dark magic, and house arrest for five years.
“Let’s have some pizza, Harry,” Hermione said, more firmly this time.
She said it as a joke, but Draco doubted that. Blaise had been a master of outperforming low expectations since he popped out of his mother’s womb two months early, perfectly healthy. “I would bet money he’s got a whole empire up his sleeve of besotted men and women who’d get anything done for him. A regular politician. But seriously, Pans, that’s wonderful. You’ll get the job, I’m sure of it. There’s no one I’d trust more to sniff out my secrets,”
He was silenced as Hermione shoved a slice of pizza into his mouth.
Alexandre muttered something and motioned toward Harry, and the tips of Malfoy’s ears turned bright red. Malfoy said something harsh in French, then turned to Harry.
Because beauty rest was the only way to describe it. Malfoy’s platinum hair messily flipped across his forehead, a forehead smoothed over with eyebrows calm and relaxed. His lips parted, and Harry could have sworn he was smiling in his sleep. But whatever. It was late at night and Harry was getting too poetic for his own good.
Draco couldn’t resist. “First of all, the whole apologizing thing. I couldn’t let him feel sorry for me. Then, there’s his ugly face and skinny ankles. If he can’t pick me up and throw me across the room, I don’t want him. He’s too hotheaded, too, so he might actually pick me up and throw me across the room. That’s not ideal. Besides, he’s probably not even bent,” he finished, making Pansy’s fork fly away into the drawer, much to her disappointment.
He laughed. Draco let a small smile creep across his own face. It wasn’t his fault. The host just had an infectious sort of laugh, that’s all.
He felt something grab at his ankle. Draco shot a slow-motion jinx at whatever it was and ran down the hall to the hippogriff door.
“Er, well, it is a very nice suit and I do like it very much. I just don’t think I’m quite the right person for it, is all,” He said, searching Alexandre for some hint of disappointment. To his surprise, he found none, and the tailor was back flipping through his clothing rack.
“His current wife’s name is Georgia. So Georgia used to do flowers for funerals, like the arrangements for the coffins. And he met her there, could barely see through all the tears and such and thought she was just a nice, kind, older lady. So he asked her for her business card so he could buy more flowers from her in the future.
Lucius was in the study.
He took a deep breath, ruffled his hair in the mirror, took a sip of coffee. It was just a conversation. Draco had those all the time.
He fluttered his fingers between a few notes, creating tension and then resolving with a flick of his wrists above the keys.
“It’s okay, Malfoy. If you can’t do it I can just play something instead,” Harry said.
“Sure, Luna.”
There wasn’t a toothbrush at the sink, Harry noticed. Did Malfoy not brush his teeth? He ran a finger along the countertop, and the finest layer of dust came with it. Did Malfoy not shit?
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you do know where he is? I thought you were serious about the Amsterdam thing,” she said, eyeing the pizza as Harry unceremoniously threw it into his oven. “And you can’t be serious about just letting the pizza bake while we’re away? This whole house could burn down!”
Harry closed his mouth. Malfoy seemed honest, but his hand was rather hot and sweaty. Harry untangled their fingers and wiped his on his shirt. “Whatever, Malfoy,”
He opened his eyes, and Potter’s concerned face peered back.
He refused to look up at his father, the poor sack of bones and anger now looming above him. Draco could hear energy buzzing through the floorboards.
Alexandre stepped forward. “Mr. Potter!” He said in lightly accented English, “A pleasure to be serving you today at Lefevre’s. Should you want to employ my services again, you may contact me via the information on this card.” A matte navy card appeared in Harry’s hand.
She was forced to turn to her nails. “So you haven’t been paying any attention to the papers in the past two years at all?”
Draco gave her a sardonic smile. “Noted. If my flat smells so much like a boxwood bush,”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “She thinks we’re dating, Potter. No press should be here, just do a little hand-hold or something and be done with it. Like it or not, for the next few hours, you’re my boyfriend.”
The Potter in the picture stiffened, then glanced at the camera. He flipped it the bird. He had dark rings under his eyes.
“Saw you just a week ago, down at Victor’s, for some bread,” Harry said, remaining in the garden to check if George had missed any large weeds.
“Straight-Laced Savior–Anything But?” the first article was titled. It remarked on Potter’s apparent single status and his lack of motivation to find a new girlfriend, but had very little substance.
If the going got tough, Draco could always try a good old-fashioned seduction attempt. If nothing else, Draco seemed to be his type in physicality.
He studied Potter for a second, calculating his next move.
“I thought Malfoys didn’t grovel?”
Draco gave them a grateful smile. It wouldn’t be perfect. Hell, it probably wouldn’t be anywhere close to good. But it was a step forward, and Draco needed those. By Merlin, he needed a few good steps forward, and hopefully right into Harry’s arms.
Draco gave them a halfhearted smile. “I don’t want to be any trouble, really,”
“Reading?” Victor all-but exploded. “Next you’ll tell me you walked outside to breathe, or came to my bakery to eat a loaf of bread. Saints preserve my soul. Reading,” He would have rolled his eyes here, if the man’s eyes still had the agility.
He’d always been accustomed to O’s.
“Of course, love.” Campbell plowed on. “I hope he gets something nice for his wife’s birthday on Sunday. She deserves it,”
It was the way his silvery, changeable eyes caught in the light and sparkled, then flickered to the keys below him like they were a challenger to best. It was the way his shoulders rose and fell with the flow of the music. It was the way his wrists drooped and flicked elegantly across the keyboard. And it was his fingers. Those long, deft fingers that found music where Harry was sure he could only have found noise. It was Malfoy. It was Draco.
” Narcissa cut in. Her eyes flashed with anger and Draco knew she understood. “
whew, angsty. or something. this chapter ended on a more serious note than the last ones, so please give me feedback in the comments! thanks
A dog barked. It was a big, black mutt. Its beard grew into five or six muddy dreadlocks at the end and her ears were in much the same condition so Draco would have assumed it was a stray if not for the green collar around her neck.
“Yeah, yeah. So what’s this about Symbolism?”
William the Conqueror was a right bastard.
“Er, great, thanks. I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Malfoy, but–”
They stopped for half a minute, then started again.
He was sure Malfoy would have rolled his eyes if not for his mother’s presence a mere thirty feet away. Wordlessly, he got up and walked over to her.
...I’ve decided he’s just a little bitch and I don’t want to bother with him any more… The radio man declared. Then after a minute and a half of silence he broke. I dunno. Maybe I will bother him. But he seemed really upset when he ran away. I just hope he doesn’t feel like he has to hide from me. I hope he’s just taking time for himself, honestly. Because I know if I wasn’t here talking about my feelings to my dog and an invisible audience for half an hour straight every day I’d be working myself up into hysterics out in the garden. I’d have destroyed half my crops from overweeding. Anyway, weather report…
The floo rang again. Draco’s head snapped up, eyes wide. Lucius would eat him alive in this state.
Draco wandered into the main room and sat at the squat sofa. He had concealed his wand in a sort of disillusioned wrist holster. He would have to think of a new solution for the summer months, but for April it was easy to slip the holster up his sleeve. Maybe if he could find any wizards or witches in this town, they could share their wand-hiding strategies.
The coffee was getting cold.
“Nothing,” He said too quickly. “I tripped,”
“Thank Merlin,” Draco said, opening the styrofoam box to find pasta alfredo messily piled inside. “You’re a goddess, Hermione,”
Hermione ran a hand through her hair. She had started wearing it brushed out into an afro. It was a good look on her. “Malfoy–”
He wasn’t sure what strange masochistic impulse compelled him to tag ‘princess’ onto the end of that line, but it was doing interesting things to Malfoy’s coloring. First, he had gone a little pale, then an angry flush spread across his nose and neck. Then he dove into some magazine he had conjured from who-knows-where.
It was time to begin cleaning. “
Then Harry slowly, carefully cast a levitation charm to move Malfoy onto the little pallet. He’d just about done it when Malfoy’s hand struck the chair he’d been sitting on and he recoiled a bit, trying to turn over. Harry slid him to the ground quickly and waited, his heartbeat pounding in his ears. If Malfoy woke up, he’d be grumpy. And if he was grumpy, then he’d leave. Harry wasn’t quite sure what compelled him to make sure Malfoy stayed in this room with him, but whatever it was it was powerful.
What the hell was Potter playing at?
“Granger–” Draco started.
Turns out, Draco had everything handled.
It was evening, though, which was good. Even a shit sleep was better than being awake alone. He’d forgotten what it felt like. Thank Merlin Potter had swooped in to remind him, can’t have Draco getting too cocky, now, thinking he might have destiny or a soulmate or a friend. He’d probably been mistaken about the patronus anyway. Potter’s was probably just a regular dog or something.
“Under my right hand, I think,” he said. He couldn’t be sure because the immobilization charm dulled his sense of touch, but there was clearly an irregularity in the texture below him.
He thought back to the well-worn leather bound gardening book he kept on the counter in the mudroom. Maybe it had a growth acceleration spell that wouldn’t affect the longevity of the tree. It would be nice for it to be at least six feet taller in two years, Harry thought. Then he could really start collecting fruit.
“I saw you sitting with Draco,” she waved an arm towards her son, who was currently trying not to make it too obvious that he was straining to hear their conversation. “And I hope you aren’t dallying with him for your own enjoyment,”
Of Potter’s friends and associates from Hogwarts, only Luna Lovegood had remained untouched. Draco had made a list.
Draco rolled his eyes. Everyone knows what “objectively” means.
A little bit of truth, enough to make it believable, and enough for Potter to be able to build off of it. Plausible. Draco didn’t like lying to his mother, but it wasn’t really a lie in most ways. No, he wasn’t dating Potter, but with a few well-placed comments and a flick of the wrist he could be.
“I’m not getting in bed with you. Also, don’t rummage around like that. You’ll hurt yourself,” He said, looking over. “I’ll just read to you, does that work, your highness?”
“Your time is soon, Mr. Potter. The bifocals find us all.”
The buzzing of muffling charms greeted him. Shit. It had to be awful news, then.
The pair had infiltrated his flat approximately half an hour ago, and had been so thoroughly put out by Draco sleeping on a card table they wanted to take him on errands with them. He had no idea how they’d managed to unlock not only the front door, but also the door to his flat. The ladies, it seemed, had no sense of wrongdoing when it came to one of their ‘charges.’
But there was a third little factoid that popped up in Draco’s mind no matter how he tried to suppress it.
Potter accepted the mug, if somewhat skeptically. He sat down at the card table, in Draco’s chair just like before. He set his wand in plain sight.
If Draco had been keeping track, which he definitely wasn’t, he now had two things over on Potter:
“Then stop beating around it and tell me why you’re here.”
“Draco, dear-” Elise said.
“Yes.”
A few pairs of robes, thankfully, not muggle clothes, were laid out on a table in the center of the room. None of them would have been Draco’s first pick, but they would have to do. He sighed and wondered if Potter had any muscle-relaxing potions.
And there was the small problem that Draco hadn’t told his father about asking the aurors for a flat. Draco had been arranging to move away from the manor since his two-year house arrest ended. Six months since then, and he had an ugly flat to show for it. It was Friday. Lucius thought Draco was visiting Blaise. And Blaise was well acquainted with many young ladies, especially pure-blooded ladies, and especially Pansy. Lucius almost raised both eyebrows when Draco told him of his plans. That meant he was ecstatic.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then he had stood, breathing heavily, in a pile of broken china. He couldn’t see his exam, now, at least.
written a letter to the Wizengamot on his behalf. Draco had gotten rid of the daisies, though, so maybe Potter had really just been repaying the favor.
“Elise, that’s inhumane,” Campbell said, not looking up from her dish. It smelled like pasta. “You should simply wait outside his flat until he feels terrible about leaving you out in the cold and comes over to sate you,”
Draco drew himself up everywhere but the shoulders. “I’m so sorry to disturb you, but you’re–”
Potter opened his mouth, but Draco started first. “And I’m not a fucking Death Eater, okay? Don’t you think I wanted to get away, too?”
He was explaining all this to Pansy, who was starting to look at him like he was a bit insane.
and since it's nine days after the anniversary.... I love getting comments and kudos, each one makes my day for like three days!
Ron had said it was too light, then. But, twat that Malfoy still was, Harry could see that it had somehow been enough.
She arrived exactly twenty-two minutes later, clutching a bag of cheap Italian takeout.
Campbell and Elise had packed him a lunch. He carried a hot cup of Brazilian Santos coffee, known for its warm, almost chocolatey flavor. It was a gorgeous sunny day (rare in this part of the country) and Draco was walking to Potter’s house. It was 10 o’clock in the morning and Draco was strictly on business duty.
“...to the surprise of me and my lord, the day after next the very room in which…”
“No. I slept on the sofa last night,” For only a few hours. Draco had been having trouble sleeping since, well, since he was about sixteen. He was twenty-one now.
“Shut up, Potter. It’s storytime,” Malfoy said, summoning his chair over so he could sit next to Harry’s bed. He put his feet up on the bed, and rested the chair against the wall. Then he began to read.
Pansy rolled her eyes. Blaise snorted. “Stop talking like a tosser, Draco. Just ask us for help like the scheming little fourth-year you are inside,”
“Oh, no, darling, has someone managed to ruffle your feathers?”
“Shut up, Potter. Just tell me where they are,” Malfoy whined, ears suddenly flushing beet-red.
“Did you paint these?” Draco asked, gesturing to the prints.
Her freckled face grew pale. “Well, Draco, why don’t you follow me into the kitchen?”
“And once you win him over, you win the rest of the town over, too,” Campbell added.
“That’s
Draco looks a bit surprised by that, blinking once quicker than normal.  “Yes, I’ve never met her but that is true.  She is my mother’s older sister.”
“C’mere.”  Harry calls, spread out and relaxed.  He reaches for Draco’s shoulder, running a hand down his arm.
“He was flyin’ with us, but he left to go after Jamie after all that yelling.”  The boy responds.  “He was mad at Jamie for sayin’ that stuff.”
.  Do you know what I believed in when I was five?  I believed Fred when he told me that you really did have eyes in the back of your head!  And in case you’ve forgotten, she is
“Who?”
“Shitting Merlin, Maud’s gone!”  He swears again.  Anxiety gripping him.  What if they couldn’t find her?  What if Bixby found her first?  How were they going to cover this up?
Jamie is okay with that.
good.”  Harry rasps out, still breathing hard.  “Please tell me we can do that again.”
“Aurors.”  Draco answers automatically, face pinking in embarrassment.  Harry can see where Draco’s hands clench into fists under the table.  Shaking from tension.  It was news to him the Draco didn't like aurors.  He had no idea.
“I want to try . . . you inside of me.”  He requests evenly, observing Harry’s reaction.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is it time yet then?"  Hermione prods.  "For us to meet him?”
Lily whines.  “My nan and granddad aren’t killed.”
“Will she be upset?”  Draco questions.  He might be in her place.  It was disconcerting to him that he was with the children more than their own mother.  This was an anxiety he had never stated aloud.  Concerned that Harry would interpret it as a criticism of his ex-wife.  Besides, a good part of him thought this feeling sprang from old sexist beliefs.  But the feeling remained.  The discomfort that maybe he was infringing on someone else’s role.
“Ronald.”  Harry returns, not feeling especially friendly right now either.
The first time he entered the home he realized how much Harry modeled Grimmauld after this place.  Every bad word Draco ever spoke of the place in his youth was wrong.
He does try.  It might even work.  He cannot be certain.  There is a more human sense about him now.  Vision less keen.  Body colder.  Heavier.  Pain more intense.  Agony really.  A gasp emanates around him and he suspects he was successful.
“Sure.”  Harry says not at all surprised.  Seamus must have gained and lost three or four fortunes at this point.  Always interested in the next big business opportunity.  Harry had been approached by his old friend to invest in a number of business ventures.  He'd gone along with a few, but preferred to not give all his money away.  He had to feed his children after all.
He can say anything to Harry, he knows this truth to his core, but it is taking him a moment.  It is ridiculous to be hesitant.  He has been sleeping with this man for several months and living with him to boot.  Surely, he can ask for this.
It is surreal and enthralling at once.
“No and yes.”  She says simply before taking a breath.  “He was a bully and I was little less than a wallflower.  We didn't have much to do with each other as children.  Narcissa invited us to playdates when we were very small, but I was more the tag along to my older sister.  We became friends a while after the war when he had stopped being such a shit.”
“I see.”  Luna acknowledges nodding to herself.  “Unfortunately, we cannot remain hidden back here during the dinner party.  Your little crup would do all she could to join us even then which would cause more fuss.”
“Shut up, Al!”  James yells, breaking his mourning.
What good will that do him?
Harry thought he was beautiful.
“We found her yesterday.”  Jamie grudgingly admits.  “Maud’s the one who’s been digging the holes outside.”
Draco sits down at the table.  Producing his wand with a flourish from his sleeve.  Jamie’s heart sinks.  It’s a bust.  “Children, did you know there is a charm to review recent spells a wand has cast?”
“You may join me in the hereafter in a moment or two, Draco," The man advises him solemnly.  "But, I ought to mention that you have made your teacher inordinately proud.  You are the only child I watched grow to adulthood from infancy.  I have been pleased to witness your good works in this world – even if all that ends here today.”

Harry walks directly to the sideboard where Kreacher prepared drinks for them.  Pouring three glasses for them.  Some mulled wine for the occasion as a nightcap.  It reminds Harry of other nightcaps he has had with Draco in this room.  He stops that thought cold before it can take root.  Trying not to freeze under Narcissa's inspection as he hands her a glass.  Narcissa was an accomplished Legilimens after all.  All the Black sisters were.
“So, it’s
Draco and Jamie work together.
Pansy sniffs.  “Not Theo or Daphne?”
“Are you really defending
Draco clasps her elbow and kisses her cheek.  “Thank you for coming.”  His boyfriend greets, tone genuine.
Harry’s expression is soft, smiling at him.  “I love you.”  His boyfriend tells him.
“My understanding is that Draco Malfoy wasn’t connected to the death eater’s shadow network.”  Kingsley remarks, considering Robards with a careful look.  “None of his statements indicated taking any part in that system.”
“We won’t do it again.”  James supplements as both boys consider their future headmistress.
Harry doesn't let go.
Draco looks amused at his response, smirk growing.  “Then you
It is natural to reach out and take her hand.  A solid support.  The most important thing they have preserved in their relationship.  He clears his throat.  Ginny seems a little teary-eyed too.  Wiping at her eyes with the back of her wrist.
“Ah.”
“I did this.”  Potter states quietly, expression suddenly sad, and staring at where his fingers touch.  Skimming across the scars there.  Draco closes his eyes, taking a deep breath and intertwining their fingers.  Stopping their movement.  He does not want Potter sad because of him.  This is the first time someone has seen his chest bare since he got injured.  He has always hidden it.  There was not a conscious thought to reveal it to Potter tonight, but it seems right.
Hi folks.  Thanks for reading!  I'm 2/3rds of the way done writing this behemoth.  Writing these have provided a much needed distraction during these trying COVID times.  My work is a lot right now and these are a bit of an escape.  I hope everyone is staying safe out there.
“He’s pretty private – which I’m glad for considering.”  He shares gesturing slightly to the scar on his forehead.  Ron and Hermione understand immediately, nodding.  He knew they would.  “He works with some healers.  I met him through his work.  Um, he’s our age.  Never been married.  No kids.”
Harry gets to his feet to follow Hargreeves out of the examination room.  The corridor outside runs along a few central stations where healers and other medical staff go about their business.  He is led through an archway down a short stairway leading to the lab.  Potion stations and equipment set up throughout with staff at work.  He had been back in the lab a few times before to be shown different equipment and ingredients used in his treatment.  He had always been impressed by the modern aesthetic and clean smell of the space.  The potions classroom of his youth at Hogwarts brought to mind stale air and a deep sense of irritation.  This lab was a stark contrast.  It was a place Harry would not mind working.
Leaving the children with Weasley and Hermione is more challenging than Draco anticipated.  He would miss them while they were away.  They were such a significant part of his life now.
He did not return to the manor after his release from Azkaban.  He joined his mother in the serviceable Victorian townhouse that had been left to her from her mother.  One of her few assets not liquidated in the aftermath of the war.  It was there he served out his probation.  There his friendship with Astoria began.  There he began to reflect on who he was and what he had done instead of focusing only on survival.
“Kitchen flirt.”  Draco accuses bantering back.  Harry laughs, ducking in to kiss him.  The sun is setting and the overhead lights in the kitchen cast them in a homey glow.  He knows this is part of infatuation – this clinginess.  But it is fun being here, and it feels right.  Harry has not felt anything close to this way in ages and it is addicting.  Draco is solid and here for him.
Draco’s future was the one on the precipice.  Admittedly Harry felt torn.  He was one of the people who gave a statement on the Malfoys’ actions during the war.  There were a few critical points where Draco quite possibly saved him – or at least gave him a chance.  One memory Harry provided the council of Draco’s hand going lax as Harry grabbed the man’s wand seemed particularly crucial to him.
“Hold up, George.  I know this is a shock, but don’t use me to make a case against Malfoy.”  Bill breaks in, tone reproachful.  “He was a teenager when all that happened, and we know Voldemort was basically holding his parents hostage at the time.  Greyback did this to me - not Malfoy.”  He ends, gesturing to the diagonal scars across his face from the werewolf’s claws.  “I came to terms with that ages ago.”
“I – I ought to tell you something.  You might not like it.”  Draco confesses sounding anxious.  Voice tight making Harry concerned.   His boyfriend pulls away and sits on the edge of the bed, taking their blanket with him and wrapping himself in it.  Back facing him and shoulders tensed.  “In fact, I don’t believe you will like it at all.”
It is out of courtesy that he visits Azkaban today.  Warm cloak wrapped around him and a harsh wind whipping through his hair as the boat ferries him to the island with other visitors and personnel.  The prison is cheerier than he remembers it.  The dementors are gone now.  The oppressive sense of dread is there but not to the same degree.  Azkaban’s walls were built to suppress magic.  The large, slab cut stone indistinguishable between the floor and walls.
“I told her.”
“You have.”
“What’s that?”  Harry questions, leaning against the pillows Draco has stacked against the headboard.  “Is it lube?”  He asks waggling his eyebrows in his best come hither impression.
Six draining weeks of attempted transfigured bone implants later and more aching scar tissue that could not be magicked away, Harry was the proud owner of a golden oak cane made by Ron and a referral to a Healer Hargreeves’ specialty clinic.
“What happened, Mr. Draco?”  Olta asks worriedly in her heavy accent, a tea tray floating behind her as she enters the room.  “Are you ill?  Should I call a healer?”
“I’m sorry, Draco.”  He apologizes quietly.
“Mother.”  Draco greets formally.  Posture perfect.  “Welcome to Grimmauld Place.”
Astoria looks mollified.  “Of course, he did.  Draco is nothing if not cautious, but that does not help him in
Harry looks at her mildly.  “Oh?”  He says, measuring her reaction.  Draco would have told him if he had shared about their dating with Pansy.  He wonders what her point is.
Al looks up at him with a serious expression.  Green eyes magnified by his glasses.  “We had to practice maths and I don’t like subtraction as much as adding.”
“We cannot afford to lose our focus.”  Kingsley states in his deep voice, expression somber as he leans forward in his chair.  “The escalation in muggle attacks - while deeply troubling - has obviously become a smokescreen tactic to put us off the scent of our ultimate perpetrator.  This is eerily what it was like before the second war.”
“Nah, don’t want your stuff.  Just wanna find out if you're death eater scum too.”
“There will be conditions.”  Dad interjects raising a pointer finger.  Jamie doesn’t care what the conditions are.  He finally gets to have a pet!
“It sounds like you are in good hands, darling.”  Mrs. Malfoy remarks tilting her head toward him and Al with a shrewd expression.  “Be careful not to engage anything too bitey, boys.”  She warns them with a smirk.
“Well,
Uncle Ron
“It was okay.”  He answers, gauging his crowd.  Uncle Ron has his feet propped on the porch rail and he’s got a dozy look on like he’s ready for a nap.  Probably a good time to ask questions Jamie guesses.  “Someone told Al something funny.”
“Try to ignore them if you can.  If not, use your best judgement.”  Dad advises.  “Like I always say, do what you can to avoid a fight, but if it comes to you anyway be smart and stay safe.”
“Have you gone mad?”  Ron accuses, eyes wide and expression hard.  “Or are you cursed or being black-mailed?  Because that is the only way, Harry.”
There is a sniff that he believes is Mrs. Weasley.  “It’s important for a child to feel connected to their mother.  The boys bonded with you, but I’ve never been convinced Lily did.”
He has his kids every other weekend.  Organizes some activities for them to do sometimes.  Doing the things he rarely - if ever - got to do as a child.  Attempting to give them the childhood he always wanted.  Traveling new places, trying new things, and generally investigating the world together.  They are happiest then.  The boys more at ease.  Jamie will
The stillness in Draco is not a great sign.  It usually wasn’t.  His boyfriend’s lips thin then and his fingers begin to fidget with the hardcover edge of his book.  “My name?”  The man echoes.
Simone smiles.  “Our friendships precede us.”
“Are Mum and Dad angry?”
If Robards was summoning him now, it was at least a level three concern.  As a deputy head of the department, he was consulted on a variety of issues categorized due to threat level.  Level five being the maximum, where the ministry itself and/or magical society was at risk of imminent doom.  There were four deputy heads of the auror department plus head auror Robards.  Three of them were needed to make official decisions.
“NO!”  Lily sobs, red-faced from crying, lying on the rug running through the foyer.  The three backpacks on the floor beside her flapping up and down, reacting to her distress.  It was not uncommon for Lily’s wobblies to lead to accidental magic.  “No, Draco!  Don’t go!”  She wails.
Harry rolls his eyes.  “If Ginny gets upset, she’ll say something.  She has zero problem giving her opinion.  Believe you me.  I doubt it though.  She’s usually pretty content to leave me all the big decisions and let the kids behave how they want.”
Dad and Draco do eventually show.  Draco leading the way striding through the arched entrance into the main sitting room adjusting the cufflink on his sleeve as he goes.  Dad trails behind, hands in the pockets of one his posh cloaks, and grin easy.  His dad seems a lot happier than the last time Jamie saw him.  Less guarded and gruff.  Jamie knew Dad didn’t like to be away so long.
Astoria stuck around for a bit.  Staying for a few days before relocating to her sister’s.  His sprogs like Astoria.  Her smaller stature, colorful dress, and upbeat attitude draws them to her.  It seems like she likes kids too.
Harry scratches his neck, thinking. “It’s just Hargreeves only sees me maybe every other month when it's usually checkups, and then it’s never at the same time.  Like I said, I have my kids when I’m not working, so I took a half day today.”
“There’s an open bar.”  Ron tells him, inclining his head meaningfully to one of the spaces squared off to serve guests.  He was a good friend.  Hermione smiles bemusedly beside them.  It was nice sometimes to be dressed up like this out doing adult things instead of chasing after sprogs - which is what he would be doing otherwise.  Tonight, that honor fell to one of his few non-Weasley babysitters: Amanda Clearwater.  The young auror had a knack with his kids.
His relationship with Potter makes him feel as he did when he first realized he could be free in Paris all those years ago at the start of his apprenticeship.  Free of Britain.  Free of his father’s control.  The dark shadow of the war slowly drifting to the periphery.  Nervous and excited.  Bewildered to be alive.
Lo and behold he had to turn into something that would always be noticed.  Ruining his grand plan.  It was not to be.  Instead he had to be a bloody phoenix.  Stark white as any of the Malfoy menagerie of animals he grew up around.  Despite this disappointment, there were a few times it had been useful to be able to transform into this particular bird.  Phoenix fire, even fire produced in animagus form, was capable of cleansing dark magic.
“We’re not talking about this.”  Draco mutters, lowering his hands, utterly self-conscious.  He will face his mortification like a man.
“Besides,” Pansy continues airily, “Draco was a good fake boyfriend.  Every time his mother sent chocolates, he shared with me.”
“They’re good people.”  Harry says slowly.  He believes it too.  He wouldn't have them on his squad otherwise.  “All of them are pretty young though.  They haven’t been exposed to a lot of the red tape and bureaucracy within the ministry.  None of them have lost someone on the job yet either.  They still have ideals.”
“Please, forgive me.”  Draco pleads.  Eyes shining.
Dad sighs heavily.  Him and Draco share one of those looks they have occasionally like they’re debating each other.  Dad’s face changes the most during them.  Sometimes it was fun to watch, but now isn’t one of those times.  It’s hard for Jamie to tell if Draco’s expression changes much.  Or what the outcome is.
He eventually gets up and meanders over to where Draco is.  His body already feels dehydrated and sore.  Tomorrow will be a day spent with Hangover Potion and water.  Of course, it already is tomorrow, late as it is – or early.  He winds his arms around Draco, leaning his forehead against his shoulder.
The monthly inter-departmental security meeting almost always takes place in the Minister of Magic’s office.  When he was starting out as an auror he was frequently invited to give reports, but now he was one of the members of the round table.  One voice among the top ministers and chief members of the Wizengamot.  Over the years, the meetings have been everything from quick briefings to all-out war room strategy.  Today was somewhere in between with Kingsley asking him, Robards, and Hermione to stay afterward – for a private word.
“Do you want to come to mine tonight?”  Harry asks hopefully, not wanting to leave.  “I have to get the kids soon, but they’ll be in bed by nine if you want a nightcap.”
“Yes!”  Harry argues.  “I had
“I’ve done bad things though.  Things that hurt your father and other people during the war.”
The whole thing cannot last longer than ten seconds, but when Potter breaks the kiss their faces remain close.
The evening sky gorgeous by the time they arrive.  The city lighting illuminating the architecture and making him feel nostalgic.  Paris is one of the few cities in the western world where there is no distinct wizarding section from muggle.  Everything is rather mixed instead.
“Psst.  Luna.”  Jamie hisses as surreptitiously as he can.  “We need your help.”  He whispers urgently.  If anyone can help them hide Maud it was Luna.  The woman had been bringing all sorts of strange magical beasts to visit with her since he was small.
“He transformed into a dog, right?  A large black one?”
Hermione’s office is the picture of efficiency.  It was rare for Harry to encounter a wizarding space that did not seem to be in disarray to some degree.  No.  Hermione was the master of organization.  Front pages of wizarding newspapers hung on the wall proclaiming some of her greatest achievements from creature rights, increasingly independent examination of law enforcement, and working with muggleborn children and their families to transition them into magical culture.  Harry was enormously proud of the work she had done through the Wizengamot.  He expects she will be the minister of magic one day.
still trusts my judgement.  I know you don’t though.”
Lily cocks her head to the side at that frowning.  “Are you sure?”
“Any hypersensitivity to temperature - water?”
“Hey!”  Harry defends himself, a bit miffed.  “I am a very charming man.”
Over and over again.
Draco huffs, keeping his face covered.  “Yes, because it is incredibly sexy to find out how much of a novice your boyfriend is at sex.”
Wigbins Primary is a quaint looking three-story building from the outside.  Inside holds a large entry way with two main floos.  The wooden floors are shiny and scuffed by the hundred fifty or so students.  Technically, the boys are the only two enrolled, but Lily will go next year.  The nursery school she attends located only a block away.  The first time he joined Harry in picking them up was like a bizarre, miniature Hogwarts reunion.  Apparently, a good amount of people in their year produced children around the boys’ age.
The night gets a bit blurry around the edges after that.
“I think that happens only in stories you read the children.”  Draco replies wryly, fixing his clothes as he levers himself to his feet.  Harry isn’t far behind.
“I’m not going to lie probably 90% of this is Hermione’s idea."  Ron confirms.  "I’ll do the cooking of course – that’ll be my contribution.”
Usual boyfriend stuff Harry figures.
The man was bizarre and possibly brilliant.  Draco will only ever admit to the former.
Narcissa merely extends her gloved hand to his four-year-old as if they are at a business meeting.  Harry wonders how long it's been since Narcissa was around a child.  He would bet Draco was the last one.  Lily stares at Narcissa's open hand before moving forward to give the woman a hug.  Wrapping her little arms firmly around Narcissa’s legs.  Now Harry has seen some remarkable things in his life and watching Narcissa Malfoy’s split second of shock transform into bemusement is one of them.  He wasn't certain the woman was capable of looking fond.
“Yeah.”  Harry confirms softly into the space between them, rubbing Draco's arm in what he hopes is an appeasing manner.  “Things you might know . . . about the other death eaters and what they did.”
“Al, you don’t even know what you’re talking about.”  Dad reproaches immediately.  Jamie knows Dad isn't too serious because he’s still got a relaxed expression on.  It’s not
“Why don’t we live here?”  James voices, face suddenly ornery as the boy starts hopping up the wide staircase.  Two steps at a time.  “We could have loads of fun here.  Is it cause it’s far away?”
“No, I like that.”  Potter responds.  “I always wanted someone who knows what a shit person I can be at my worst but being with them makes me try my best.  It’s like deciding to grow together no matter what – like intertwined branches on a plant, pruned over time.”
The next few memories of this illness are more fractured.  He was asleep for a good bit of it.  Then bundled up in Mother’s arms and one of the last healers being with them.  He remembers reading the word hospital on a sign.
“I hear you’re on the pickup list for the boys now.”  Pansy remarks.  Eyeing him with a smirk as he approaches.  Draco appreciates her teasing.  She was reliably snarky at the best of times.  “Potter must be mad to think you can be left in charge of children.”
“I am.”  Harry confirms, going over to the free chair to sit.  Taking off his boots and uniform cloak.
It is a sad state of affairs that he is accustomed to the screaming and wretched rambling growing louder when the overhead lights go out.  Sleep remains challenging.  He aims for rest instead.  Propped against the roughhewn wall, reclining on his cot in his narrow cell.  The cells are little more than carved in slots along the walls, scarcely big enough for a cot and toilet.  Creaking lamps floating along the aisle walkways cast weak light.
He wakes to a small foot in his face.  Harry is wrapped around him and Lily is upside down on the bed, partly on top of them both.  Draco has a vague memory of Lily coming in last night crying about wetting her bed.  Harry had gotten up to take care of it.  Telling him to stay and sleep, but Draco was already awake and figured he might as well assist.  Harry helped Lily wash and change; and Draco cleaned her bed with a quick Scourgify and a freshening charm.  He remembers falling back into bed, listening to Harry talk to Lily in the bathroom.
“I – could we?”  He questions making careful eye contact with his boyfriend, suddenly feeling nervous.  He wraps a hand around Harry’s cock.  Feeling how hot and hard it is in his hand.  Wondering at how bold he has become.
“I like my stuff.”  Harry defends automatically.  This had been a frequent disagreement of late.  “Is that so wrong?”
His boyfriend gives him a disparaging look, but the barely there smile indicates exasperated amusement.  “You are a hoarder, Harry.  The first step is acceptance.  The second step is allowing me to remove the waste.  Most of the furniture in the attic is rubbish that you refuse to be rid of.”
to pass him the bacon.”
Hermione beams, white teeth gleaming from her almond-toned skin.  Ron grins at them.  They're good friends.  He is lucky to have them.  The thought of dating was ominous enough, but he knew it would be hard for them to navigate too.  He’d seen that firsthand when Ginny began dating again and they had to figure out how to be supportive of her without hurting him.
There is a pause as Draco’s brow furrows further.  Frown deepening in the manner he did sometimes when considering something seriously.  “Are you inquiring about this as my boyfriend or as an auror?”  His boyfriend questions in a neutral tone of voice, setting Harry’s teeth on edge.
Draco swats her away. “I was
“Shhh!  Lily!”  Jamie upbraids bringing his pointer finger to his lips and jogging over the remaining few steps to his sister.  “The crup is a secret!  Be quiet!”  He demands.  There is a loud click of the door behind him shutting making him wince, but it’s just Al when he checks.  Maud races straight to Al the moment she lays eyes on him.  Front paws digging at Al’s legs as his brother picks her up.
“Your daughter believed Draco Malfoy somehow fathered her.”
“Dad, Draco,” Jamie states as he draws near, tone demanding their attention. “When we get home can I have my pogo-go back?  I promise I won’t use it in the house.”
“As I said, you have good taste.”  She repeats, corners of her eyes crinkling as she smiles.  Expression warm.  “I recognized you from a recent photo in the Daily Prophet.  I’ve been following your friend Hermione Granger’s career for years.  She has an impressive body of work campaigning for creature folk rights.  I was raised mostly by house elves, you see.  They are free in France, but not in most places in the world.  I was pleased to see her introduce a bill for LGBTQ protections here in Britain.  It’s long past due.”
“Not so fast, Weasley.  I’ll tell you mine if everyone plays the game.”  Pansy proposes with a smirk, wagging her finger at him.
Harry looks confused for a second.  Tilting his head to the side in the way his children did sometimes before connecting the dots.  “What about her?”
“You are welcome to join me.”  Draco offers, removing his work robes to hang on a hook, and looking back at Harry again.  “We could go to that bird pub nearby you like.  What is it called again?”
“I am, you arsehole.”  Harry says, tone careworn.  “Merlin’s sake, Draco, why didn’t you wait for me before running into that bloody place?  I thought we'd agreed.”
His boyfriend looks a bit care worn on arrival.  Smile slightly strained as he shrugs off his auror robes.  Draco has Kreacher bring Harry lunch in the main sitting room.  James is still in his bedroom having not apologized yet and Albus appears appropriately abashed at his father’s entrance.  So much so, Harry raises questioning eyebrows at Draco, who shakes his head indicating to save it for later.  It can wait.  Harry can take a moment to acclimatize to being home.
“What time is it?” He asked, trying to stand up again.
Draco knew a thing or two about those.
And Harry leaned forward and kissed him. Draco’s mouth remained still for a moment, then he kissed Harry back. It wasn’t a long kiss, and it wasn’t aggressive or deep, but it didn’t feel chaste. It felt like a gift and it felt like a promise. It felt inevitable, like how rain follows after a cloud and how winter falls after autumn.
Ron has gone with him to every single one of the Death Eater trials the months after the Battle. It was nearly three or four times a week for four months, but Ron had understood why Harry had to be there.
Harry didn’t mind weeding all that much. It was nice work, easy to see your progress and quite satisfying to do, pulling the tall and tough pigweeds by the roots and easily slipping the ragweed out of its place.
Malfoy rolled his eyes despite the thin sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead. “Don’t be a dick, Potter,”
“It’s the 22nd this year, right?” Harry asked.
Draco put two fingers into the salves and spread them on Harry’s injured body parts. It was not fun. The salve was cold. But Draco’s fingers were shaking and his ears were red again, so Harry managed not to flinch or squirm.
He cocked his head, communicating mute but attentive interest.
They exchanged a look. Then another one. Elise opened her mouth, then Campbell rose an eyebrow, winning the argument. “Never you mind,” Campbell said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco took his research and went back to his flat.
“Oh, yes! The pear. I’ve put her in and she’s doing very well,” Harry said, feeling slightly guilty. He had, in fact, relied mainly on stasis charms to transplant the sapling, but as far as The Mums were concerned, he was a master gardener.
“You were asleep.” Luna supplied helpfully.
Elise nodded. “Do you think he needs any help? I know a couple lovely florists who send by post,”
Harry laughed along with them, even though he hadn’t really the faintest what Arnie had been like, besides the grumpy-in-a-bad-way man who’d lived across the street from Campbell and Elise back in the day and had died a few months before Harry had bought his place.
The kitchen door swung open. “Christmas Party?” George said. “I hope I’m invited this year,”
Draco waved his hand dismissively. “He’s rather senile, as of late. Most likely, he won’t even come down from his rooms. And if he does, we can just let Mother handle it,”
It was getting dark out. Though there weren’t many muggles around, Harry didn’t generally like to use lighting charms outside like this. What if he put up muggle repelling charms, and one of his neighbors needed to borrow some flour? It would be rude.
Weasley’s face disappeared into the green flames for a few seconds. The flames flickered and blurred, then Granger’s face appeared.
They could never prove the muggles (it had been a whole mob of Death Eaters at the time), he didn’t kill Dumbledore, but Harry Potter? The Wizengamot would not be lenient if Harry Potter was killed. And worst of all, there would be no Harry Potter to testify for him.
“Your mum wanted to meet me formally, remember?”
Malfoy turned back to some notebook he was reading. It had a wild chartreuse and vermillion paisley cover, so Harry guessed it was Luna’s. Malfoy was studying it closely. A bit of hair kept falling into his eyes, and Malfoy pushed it back with a distracted movement. Maybe it was subconscious. Malfoy turned the page and squinted at the next sentence, then turned to ask Luna a question.
“Draco, breathe,” Elise said, hand on his arm and a worried look in her eye. “Our Harry’s not a delicate flower. He’s been through a lot, I’ve gathered,”
So he would just happen to head into Campbell and Elise’s bookstore to look for something to read and Malfoy would be heading over for lunch at about that time. But then Harry would engage him in some sort of talk about what sort of book would be best to look for, and Malfoy would have to excuse himself on account of being so hungry for lunch. Harry, brilliant and prepared as always, would invite Malfoy back to his. After all, he might have made a bit too big of a pizza and it would be a shame to let good food go to waste. Malfoy would walk in and say something like, “wow, Potter, this smells delicious!” Then Harry would tease him about never eating and Malfoy would look slightly guilty, but it would be alright because Harry would say hey, Malfoy, what if you just come to mine for lunch every Friday afternoon? I cook only for myself, really, and I’d like some outward opinions, seeing as we’re friends and all. To which Malfoy would respond–
“No,” Draco said, making sure Weasley could see the paper he was using as a coaster.
“Yes.”
The number of pillows under Draco’s head seemed to have multiplied overnight. It had to be Potter’s doing. How he had managed to put them under Draco’s body was beyond him, but the implication that Potter looked over him at night was simultaneously made him smile a bit and want to change his name, hightail it to rural France and never talk to another human being again.
“Merlin-bloody-fuck,” Malfoy mumbled. His hands stumbled to hide his book somewhere deep beneath the sofa cushions. Harry wondered briefly what sort of book it was, if Malfoy had been so ashamed of it. Some sort of cheap, awful romance written for middle aged single witches, probably. Malfoy’s eyes opened and closed like each movement was a favor. “What was that for?”
Malfoy, could it?
“Remember the vinegar!”
Narcissa started her sentence with a sharp intake of breath. “If you want to do things your way, Draco, you must obtain the resources to do so. Once you show me that, we can revisit this conversation.”
Bloody Aurors had told him his identity could remain private.
“That’s triply atrocious. Do you even have a bed?”
He looked up. “Excellent. I’ll be in in a few minutes. Anti-static brush needs replacing,”
She beckoned in Harry’s direction, and he looked behind him for the other person she was probably actually looking at. But Malfoy nudged him rather hard in the ribs.
“Funny thing, you’re building a coffee shop in old Arnie’s place,”
“Yes, mother,” he said. “But I’m afraid I’ll have to postpone further concerts until later. I have some work to sort through today,” He looked in Harry’s general direction but slightly to the left, like he was scared of meeting Harry’s eyes. “Potter.” He said with a short nod.
He smiled. She could be so direct.
He scrambled for paper, penning a note to Hermione. And then it was off, the postal service’s owl flying as fast as its wings could take it (since Draco had fed it a little bit of his dropped toast).
“The entire Wizarding World?” Draco said bitterly.
Also, he didn’t need to work any more than everyone else. That was something his mind healer had told him.
Harry could make out something on the papers Draco was sorting through. It was something about ownership of ancient wizarding estates.
Draco’s doorbell rang downstairs. He cursed under his breath, then mentally prepared himself for the journey through the empty shop.
“Better move seduction up to number four,” Blaise muttered to Pansy.
But still, better to be going crazy over the weather and his dog than over Malfoy. That could wait until later.
Harry tried to smile, show him he’s really getting on quite nicely, then remembered he didn’t have to. “If that’s all, I better be going. Things to do and all. I’ll talk to you soon.”
Malfoy looked down into Harry’s eyes. “That better?” he asked.
Draco brought his groceries upstairs, nearly falling several times. He’d been forced to let his new mothers pay for them, since he hadn’t quite gotten around to exchanging galleons for pounds or whatever it is they use these days.
“Wonderful!” Campbell said, grabbing him by the shoulder and maneuvering him downstairs. He had no idea how a woman whose head barely reached his shoulder could pull him around so easily, but here he was, standing outside his shop and on his way to the baker’s. He supposed it was payback for falling asleep at his flat instead of theirs.
“How is your little tree doing?” Elise asked.
Abford was a small town.
“Hmm?”
Mr. Magnanimous’s mouth opened, and words came out, but they were silenced by the roar of the closing floo.
God, Malfoy’s bathroom.
and thank God, he agrees, but not without catching the attention of a young lady walking by,”
“I simply will not!” Draco demanded of it. “And you can’t make me.”
And Harry explained the abridged story to her. Well, the very abridged story. It basically ended up as “I think I fell a little bit in love with him and I think he’s a little bit in love with me but we’re both forests with active land mines, if you know what I mean,”
“I say it’s time for us to perform another little muggle miracle of technology, don’t you think?”
on his lips. But then his head was yanked up. He thought it was Lucius, but the force pulled him backwards.
“I’m not sure what to say to that, Malfoy,” Potter said, turning back around to check the soup. “Soup’s done.”
“Whoops,” she said, voice devoid of any emotion. “Must have missed that day in friendship-school,”
hope you all enjoyed this one! it went a little heavy on the angst and drama, but that's showbiz baby.
He realized he hadn’t even said who Draco was. What was the name he had made up for him again? Oh yeah. “This is Posh Spice.” Silly name. “Turn of events, I know. My old enemy turning up and becoming one of my favorite people. He’s just captivating, I suppose. You see, he’s got this air about him, like he couldn’t care less about you, but it slips aside so often that you can see the raw passion he has for so many things. He laughed. It’s really attractive. There’s this light in his eyes and this quirk in his lips…”
“Pink door on the left.” Potter said.
Harry flipped the book over, looking at the title. It was Shakespeare’s
“It’s ten, isn’t it, Stella?”
Mother had taught him the language as a young boy. She had always been fond of France.
“I’m not doing it. I’m not seducing Harry Potter,” he said to no one in particular.
The sun dragged itself through the sky. It had started to glare most uncomfortably. Draco had taken to throwing little bits of sandwich into the street to lure the two sheep closer and closer.  He had just managed to get the larger one to eat out of his hand when the door swung open.
In no time, Luna had dropped them off at Draco’s flat, said a brief ‘ta’ and left.
The floo roared to life, and out stepped Pansy Parkinson, looking rather more mussed than per usual.
Draco decided he agreed. Working with Hermione was more cathartic than continuing to think about Harry and the patronuses and how their magic saw each other as the most compatible people ever and how that meant that if they started anything it would be a huge success but Draco didn’t deserve success and–
He made eye contact with Narcissa. She narrowed her eyes like a smile, as if to grant him permission to continue rustling around as such.
Draco nodded. “I believe my family has paid enough. Besides, the ministry would have to demolish the house if they want to use it for anything without an heir. Old bloodline magic,”
Oh, yeah. That.
Potter gave him an odd look as Gelby ushered them inside. But Draco was walking much too quickly for Potter to say anything.
Draco was studying the embroidery on the sofa he was sitting on. It had rather lovely dragons.
“And then Victor was just
The floo flickered, ready to switch back to the call with Weasley.
“Ah, yes. I’ll stop by tomorrow while Aina’s minding the shop. Busy moving into the flat yesterday?”
Harry had pushed open the door and the elf was behind it, sure enough. He was laying straight up and down, hands clasped over his stomach like a corpse at a funeral. He was clutching Regulus’s amulet in his gnarled fingers.
“Squoggles?”
Adrenaline crash must’ve just hit him.
Potter seemed to consider this, then opened his mouth to speak:
“You think they look good?” Harry said, trying to untangle himself from the ruffled collar of the yellow ensemble.
“I’ve decided he’s just a little bitch and I don’t want to bother with him any more.” Harry declared.
Draco rolled his eyes and sunk into the sleek, modern sofa at Pansy’s flat. “Nightmares, more like.
from the spare room.
But every night, without fail, Draco listened to the radio man. He wasn’t sure quite why. Maybe it brought him back to before all the reparations stuff, when moving here was more about coffee and a little quarrel than, well, learning how to feed himself and a much larger quarrel.
“Miss Lovegood sent a parcel by owl to you this morning,” she said. “I presume it’s important, so I shall leave you and my son to open it.” She handed Potter a cardboard box, wrapped with quidditch-themed wrapping paper.
Right, papers.
So it made sense that Potter’s patronus had changed. He wasn’t the same person as he had been during the war. Merlin, nobody could retire from being a political weapon and icon and remain the same.
God, Hermione. He had called her the other day. She had asked him where he was and if he wanted to talk. He said of course he wanted to talk, ‘Mione,’ it’s why he called her. He asked about Ron. She and him were engaged, right? It’s been awhile. It has, she said. It’s been too long, Harry. Why did you leave? Because I didn’t want to stay, he had said. But he didn’t want to go over that again. S’not fun, he had said. S’not polite conversation, is it?
Somebody tipped off the papers that Potter was vacationing in the Caribbean, and then there was review after review of Jamaican and Bahamian resorts. After the journalists wandered about in the Caribbean for a bit, they started printing absolute rubbish.
Weasley nodded. “Or an anonymous acquaintance,”
! For that, I’m going to name you something horrible. Probably after the most stubborn person I’ve ever met. He’s a real arsehole sometimes. What do you think of
“Ten-ish?”
But Potter was no longer looking at him, and probably wasn’t even listening. In fact, he was several feet behind Draco and Gelby, looking at some sixteenth century lead mirror hanging in the hallway. Mouth slightly open, he was tracing the sculpted figurines of the frame.
Harry smiled apologetically. “I have to go now, sorry. I expect Stella’s getting anxious outside,”
Campbell looked startled. “He’s really a lovely old boy, isn’t he, Elise?”
At lunch it became quite clear that Draco had reached his limit on sympathy for the month, and had left feeling altogether better about the whole Potter situation. Surely, he could stay out of his way, if it even was the same Potter from school. Potter, who had saved the wizarding world and all that. With any luck, it would be a Potter whose parents were very much alive and had just celebrated their anniversary.
Harry nodded, watching Malfoy’s lips from across the room. “Read me another,” he said. “You’re good at it.”
Draco threw another pillow at his face. It did not connect. Matter of fact, it came rushing right back towards him. He tried to deflect it, but it ended up spiraling off his arm and into the grand piano.
(See the end of the chapter for
He noticed Potter apparated across the street. How inventive. Draco smirked and gave a little wave. He cast a tempus charm; it was past four. That was enough protesting for today.
They checked the study. Clear.
“Is Pansy coming?” Draco asked.
“And why are you still home?” Malfoy directed at Harry, spitting the ‘you’ out like a curse.
Draco didn’t blame him. It was a beautiful room, all white wrought-iron and glass. Lilies suspended in the air made up the north wall, and dahlias grew from the south. Daylight poured in from the ceiling, lighting up Potter’s face and making his pupils retract. Draco hoped the light was doing the same thing for his complexion that it was doing to Potter’s, or else he was marvelously outclassed.
“He was already gone,” she said, turning back to her embroidery, voice cold and devoid of emotion. “Must have left as soon as he healed.”
Draco didn’t look up. “Weasley,”
He could feel Pansy’s incredulous expression at the back of his head. He didn’t give it any credence.
Draco whirled around. “Blaise? Did you get a job at last?”
. He pulled out his wand and did a quick diagnostic charm to check for curses. Malfoys didn’t exactly have a good record with books and bookstores. The charm flickered blue, signifying there was no magical presence. He ran a thumb over the pages, exposing annotations in different colored inks on almost every page.
Malfoy jumped awake, one hand on his wand, other hand on his nose. Luna deflected the jinxes he threw.
“So, er, what were you sorting through up there, Malfoy? Looked like a whole library,”
...I just want to talk to him, you know? First I’ll tell him I’m sorry, then I’ll demand an apology. I’ll be like hey, Posh Spice, sorry, but you gotta pull your own weight, too…
‘Draco–er–Malfoy! That’s ridiculous! I hate helping people and exist only to make your life difficult!’”
Nonetheless, he packed the clothes from the night before back into their small duffel.
Potter was always popping up, now, in the most inconvenient of ways. Draco was nearly starting to regret shaking his hand two days ago. Which was really quite a shame, since his mother had owled yesterday to let Draco know she was expecting to meet ‘his Mr. Potter’ on Saturday. Which meant that he was going to have to take Potter shopping for a decent outfit later today.
“I hope this isn’t a sad cautionary story where lack of communication leads to the apocalypse,” Draco deadpanned. “I’m well aware of my problems, don’t worry.”
It was common knowledge that Voldemort used Malfoy Manor as his headquarters. And since Skeeter had published that ‘biography’ on Harry Potter, the wide Wizarding World knew Granger had been tortured there.
i tried to stop working on this until the end of the school year, i really did. But then a snow day happened...
She took another sip. “You could do a lot worse than Potter,”
“Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
Harry cracked a grin.
Draco handed her a mug. They sat on the counter together.
How curious. Harry shrunk and pocketed the book.
Wasn’t like there was anything else to do. He couldn’t move and he couldn’t see.
He prepared for disappointment.
Malfoy went back to the door, opened it. He left and the door swung shut behind him. Harry watched the dust settle again and it dawned on him how utterly alone he was.
And Draco hadn’t prepared Potter for that at all.
That isn’t very many. The Manor was over ten at its widest point. And much muddier. Draco had run the length of it as a fourth year for fun and again in his seventh for other reasons. He had been faster seventh year.
(See the end of the chapter for
, aren’t you? You have betrayed us all,” he whispered. “The Dark Lord will punish me for this,”
Elise gave her a small grin. “Right.” She started. “So Victor’s first wife was the love of his life, and he met his current wife at her funeral. A great conversation starter, you know. How’d you meet your wife? Well, it was all thanks to my other wife, really. Just kidding,” Elise added sheepishly, before continuing:
“You know, Harry,” George said, setting down his teacup. “I’ve been meaning to have you take a look at my garden. It’s no rival to yours, by any means, but neither Lydia nor I seem to be much for routine maintenance and I’d hate the tomato plants to feel neglected.”
“How about you pick out robes this time, monsieur?”
Why was Malfoy here, anyway? It wasn’t to eavesdrop on him for the press, certainly. He already had a place to live, and even after his family had paid reparations there had to have been more than enough money for Malfoy to get a flat anywhere else. The whole mess with the Manor or whatever could probably be solved if Malfoy just lived there. Well, Harry wasn’t very clear on exactly what Malfoy’s case entailed since no one had explained it to him, but if the Ministry wanted to house and Malfoy didn’t, it didn’t make any sense to Harry why he didn’t just let the Ministry take the house. It’s what Harry would have done.
“A girl had to stay at his house, but he was too polite to kick her out, so the house made it so she couldn’t stay by hiding all the bedrooms.”
Draco rolled his eyes carefully, to assure they absolutely didn’t notice the violent red he was sure his ears had turned. “I hate you both. What’s for lunch?”
He quirked an eyebrow and sat on the TV stand.
He duplicated it and stuck the copy on the wall behind him.
A soup for a coffee. Tit for tat.
The figure pulled the sheets off themselves revealing a sweatshirt-and-boxer-clad Draco Malfoy.
Campbell nodded sagely. “That sort of thing tends to leave an impression. So how about George’s new little garden? You should give him some tips,”
He wanted to press his head into a pillow and scream into it, like he had as a second-year after getting his first Exceeds Expectations on a potions essay.
It was half past eleven when Draco realized he was growing uncomfortably hungry. So he took a break. There was nothing much in his flat, but toast would have to do today. Maybe he would get groceries tomorrow. That’s what he said yesterday, but here’s to hoping.
Draco looked through thick, dark eyelashes (had Potter always had such pretty framing for his eyes?) to find the striking front-page Witch Weekly most gorgeous eyes of the month looking right through him, pupils dilated slightly. Draco could feel the inevitable redness of his face and ears but in this moment, he didn’t really care.
Draco scowled, counting out the muggle bills the goblin handed him. “You’re supposed to be sorry for me,”
“The person who wrote the article, in case you didn’t know, is Orion N Ager. He lives in Chelsea and his residence isn’t at all warded against owls from strangers. In case you were wondering,”
Weasley sputtered, possibly enraged, possibly choking down a laugh. The green hue of the floo made it rather difficult to tell.
“I’m staging a protest. He doesn’t want to talk to me, so I’m going to mildly inconvenience him until he’s forced to.”
Campbell laughed. “Just one today. Moved into old Arnie’s store yesterday,”
” Draco said, letting his words ring around the sun parlor.
He a couple of his pillows to the ground, transfiguring one into a blanket. With any luck, it would last the night.
He opened the door of Campbell and Elise’s spare bedroom. He had not been surprised when they had retired into the same room at around 9:30 pm.
He didn’t have his glasses on, but he’d be damned if he’d ask Narcissa to help him with that. Harry wasn’t sure if he should respect her or fear her, and in his indecision had simply settled with a healthy dose of both.
She hugged him.
He couldn’t start with a swish, he realized. That constitutes impermanence. Draco wanted this spell to be as permanent as possible. He took a breath, then cast.
“I found no sign of Draco Malfoy,” Mr Ager repeated.
His house was very green, and sometimes dirty. Actually, mostly dirty.
“See, look,” Draco said, pushing the unwilling Potter into range of the mirror. “Tell me who you see,”
“‘But even Hermione asked me to ask you!’
Draco spun to face her. She was always just a bit shorter than he remembered, but the sharp eyes, the angles of her sleek black bob, her high cheekbones were all the same. “Aurors said furniture is coming in a week,” Draco said. “But knowing them…”
Wait.
“You still are.”
Harry turned back to the pizza dough, frowning, while she continued.
Draco groaned. Of all the people to ramble on about how desperately in love they were with another man, it had to be Mr. Radio Show with the Nice Voice, Draco’s supposed last ally in the great war against having emotions. He didn’t turn it off yet, though.
Harry wakes with a gasp.  Sitting straight up in bed.  His whole body in a cold sweat.  Bloody hell that was a terrifying nightmare.  He falls back to his bed with a thump.  Blowing back the hair that fell into his face.  It is clear what is happening here.
“Nothing more than go along with Potter’s madness,” Draco says calmly, voice mild.  “And get caught up in it myself.”
“You okay?”  Harry checks, halting.  He can feel how hard Draco is and kisses the crown of his head where his blonde hair is mussed.  Draco still doesn't react.  “We can stop.”  He reassures.
Jamie is not sure why Dad looks embarrassed.  He can tell because Dad’s mouth does that thing where he frowns and tries to keep his mouth from moving at the same time.  Draco is smirking and Dad announces it's time for them to leave.
“Will Auror Potter be joining us this afternoon?”  She inquires gaze firmly on her son.  “If I recall correctly, this dinner was meant to be an event you
Kreacher usually did up the house beautifully for Christmas but this year it seemed especially bursting with holiday spirit.  He knows the elf had also been pleased to be celebrating Yule this year.  Harry had no idea it would be something the elf cared about but perhaps he should have.  The Blacks celebrated this too.
“What about the Veritaserum?”  Harry cuts in.  Surely, they can fight that.
“There was always something.”  Harry says, sounding frustrated.
here for treatment or are you here to monitor me?”
Here Hargreeves pauses, gathering the attention of the crowd.  “Much of our clinic’s work focuses on the injured and ailing but we hope to expand our work by utilizing this research fund - generously amassed by you lovely people - to develop serums to aid our transitioning brothers and sisters be who they are at their core.  However they choose to use them to realize their identities.  I thank you and my staff for your gracious giving tonight and hope you enjoyed the cocktails and the auction.  I would like to take this opportunity now to have MTA’s president Carole Vance speak with you further about their organization’s good work.”
“Hello.”  He greets them politely.  It was unusual for him to run into other aurors outside of the ministry, but that was purposeful on his end.
Draco pulls back, still bracketed above Harry.  Hair messed up from his usual loosely combed back style, lips redder.  “Harry.”  The man states, expression mirthful.
“But it’s not even bedtime.”  Albus complains.  Green eyes wide in concern.  Draco would laugh if that would not upset him.
Potter chuckles amusement lighting up his face.  “Can’t say that I do.  But I have an idea of what’s ahead of you.  Fixing up Grimmauld Place was exhausting, and I nearly walked away from it a dozen or more times.”
“What’s your favorite team?”  He continues.
in them.  He lives with them.  He is a critical part of their routine.  He acts frequently as their guardian.  He is filled with pride when he watches James learn to read a new word or summarize what he read after such hard work.  Delighted when Albus shows a natural interest in potions and learning about magical creatures.  Endeared when Lily breaks into a run once she sees him at pick up.  Jumping into his arms like they have been separated for too long.
“Like Pansy said, it could have been worse.”  Draco responds with a shoulder twitch.  Harry puts an arm around him, briefly squeezing the man’s bicep in silent support.  Sometimes he was glad he did not realize he liked men until he was an adult.  He cannot imagine getting used to that with the war going on and all the media attention on him as a kid.
Draco knew when to stop pressing.  “Alright, then.  Let’s go see what your father and siblings are doing, shall we?”
“Canaries.”  Harry supplies.  It was a muggle pub with a bird theme.  Birders ate there and had their club.  The poor creatures were stuffed and showcased all throughout it.  Eyes staring.  It had made Harry inordinately pleased to witness Draco interact with the muggle waitress there who was dressed as a pigeon.  The whole place was bizarre and as far as Harry could tell totally unattached to the magical community.  It didn't hurt that the food was good.
“No, you don’t.”  James refutes.  Looking suspicious as if Draco were trying to trick him.  “You make all kinds of potions and things where you work.  Like that cream stuff for Dad.”
Harry guffaws at that, glancing over to share an amused look with Draco.  His boyfriend sighs instead expression put upon.  Harry kisses his cheek to cheer him up.  Draco scowls at that but doesn't move away from Harry’s arm around his waist.
“Please call me Andromeda.”  Mrs. Tonks intones.
“See?”  Harry emphasizes motioning toward Ron, feeling validated.
The councilman bows his head.  “Retracted.”
She appears somewhat taken aback by that.  “Thank you.  I know Tony thinks highly of you.”  Harry notices she didn't include herself in that statement.  “I must say though, this is quite the surprise.  Did you know Draco is here too?  He works at the clinic.”
Harry snorts, but allows the separation.  Draco reaches out to move a potato back that falls over to his side, but Harry grabs his boyfriend’s hand.  “That’s hot be careful.”
Their sister looks uncertain for a few seconds.  Standing caught under their gaze before running off.  Slippers slapping over the tile.  Teddy sighs and goes after.
Draco gives him an incredulous look.  Clearly surprised.
No death eaters are to carry a wand again or be given one.  The wand has been Harry’s since he was seventeen.  Its loyalty belongs to him despite originally belonging to Malfoy.  Still, it will obey him.  He never hands the wand directly to the man, but he does leave it behind the morning he leaves.  Placing it gently on the indigo patterned placemat at the center of the kitchen table like it’s a volatile animal that may bite him.
.  A few undone buttons?  That’s what gets you going?”  Draco drawls.  “Is that all you need?”
“No.”
“Draco, I’ve brought Auror Potter here to see about the fire salamander salve trial.”  Hargreeves informs, straight to the point.  Harry’s chart floats over to gently land on the glossy desk set to the side, facing the room.
Marry a pureblood witch.  Have pureblood children.  Live at the manor.  Repeat the cycle.  That was what he was
“Very well.”  Mrs. Malfoy drawls blinking once tone nonplussed.  “How does that pertain to anything?”
He and Draco dispense gifts to the children.  It is a good thing too as they appear to be losing interest.  Harry sits back on one of the couches with Draco and watches them excitedly open their gifts.  He is glad the kids like their gifts.  The boys immediately start comparing the weebler whooshes they got them with one another.  Andromeda already warning Teddy he cannot return to Hogwarts with it for fear of using it as a boomerang.  Lily is already cuddling with her new gorgon doll.  Braiding the doll’s serpentine hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Would you like me to order for you?”  Draco offers.
“Can I have that in writing?”  Harry jokes with a wane smile, reaching out to rest his palm on Draco’s cheek.  Wiping away a tear with his thumb.  “I know several of our old professors would be amazed to see that.”
“Indeed.”  Mrs. Malfoy comments dryly, turning then to the house elf serving them.  “Dot, please be a dear, and summon Draco.  His guests are arriving, and I believe this crup business would be of interest to him.”
Draco nods, not reacting otherwise.  “Thank you for your honesty.”
“It went badly then, I take it?”  Potter surmises.
Potter leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers.  “Do you want me to ask Bill Weasley about this?”
“Now you sound like Harry.”
Harry whines at the sight before him.
“I know!”  Lily yells brightly, plopping both hands on the table and leaning toward her cousin with earnestness.  “The daddies put them in there!  Papa and Daddy put me in Mummy’s tummy for me to grow.”
“You were young and scared.”  His professor surmises.
“Should you be?”  Harry responds, raising an eyebrow.  Draco suspects this is an automatic response.  The rebuttal is something he has heard his boyfriend say dozens of times when one of the children asks this question.
The way you feel against me.  Never let anyone touch me the way you do.  You’re so bloody tight and big.  Don’t know if I want to be in you or you in me.”  Draco says sounding desperate, moving his hand quicker.  “Want you to touch me now.  Don’t you want to?”
The sight of Draco Malfoy being freed and looking adrift in the world stays with him for some time afterward.  A grey ghost of a young man at the periphery of his mind.  No longer the arrogant boy Harry met years ago.
“What about our families?”  He questions.  It has been a rare occurrence that he has not done exactly what his parents wanted.
“Ah,” He voices.  All the broad strokes then.  He sort of figured.
“What do you mean?”  He returns bemusedly.
“More school.”  James whines, lolling his head back in his seat, whole body sagging.
“Are you sure?”  Draco tries again.  “I know he would be happy to listen.”
Astoria looks sadly up at him.  Eyes shining.  Draco likes her.  Not the way he should.  The way his parents would prefer, but he does care about her.  It is a start at the least.  She is very slight, pale with thin brown hair framing her delicate face.  He has the distinct sense a strong gust of wind would knock her over.  Her health had always been poorly.  A family curse or some such.  Astoria was a compromise for his parents.  There were few pureblood parents who wanted to arrange marriages between their daughters and him.  The war permanently stained his family’s reputation.  He was either a social pariah or a useless weakling depending on the pureblood circle his name was circulated in.
“Okay, Harry.”  Ginevra flaps a reproving hand at him.  “Not the time.”
“I see.”  Harry responds.  This could be problematic.  He may have to blindly choose and hope for the best.  All the food he had seen brought out seemed small in portion and not quite edible in appearance.  He much preferred heartier food.
I love a flashback episode.  My last two planned OCs are introduced with a dash of world building.  Thanks to everyone who has stuck with this story this far.  You motivate me.  As always, I own nothing - just plots.
finishing the house as befits a proper wizarding home.” And, “Master Harry locks away my mistress’ treasures and her
It is foolish to fret.  He knows they are well aware of his and Harry’s itinerary, but this is the longest he has voluntarily been away from the children since he met them.  He feels slightly anxious about the whole thing.  James has only recently begun initiating conversation with him.  What if being gone causes his relationship with all of them to regress?
“Lily!”  Their sister shouts exuberantly.
The day is winding down and the children are in their pajamas ready for their bedtime story.  Draco has found he appreciates this time with the children.  James even seems interested by the stories.  They pack them off to bed.  Him hanging back as Harry tucks them in.  More and more becoming part of their routine.
“He was called into work.”  Draco explains while adding blueberries to his own breakfast.
Harry sobers at that, glancing sideways at his companion.  He definitely is not the only one who has been thinking about their relationship.  Who are they to each other now the experiment is over?
need to earn your trust back.”

“You going to stay awake this time?”  She had asked, mouth in a firm line and appearing slightly more energized than him.  Lily was a month old at the time and neither of them had been sleeping much between balancing a newborn and two small sons.
“What?”  Draco questions, confused.
There is a pause.
Draco is not disappointed.
They rest like that for a moment longer.  Harry panting underneath him and Draco limply kissing his back before withdrawing and laying down beside him.  He reaches blindly out for his wand.  Casting to release Harry from his ties.  His boyfriend’s arms come apart like lead weights.  Harry remains unmoved otherwise.
The boys voiced missing Ginevra, but there again, Lily never did.  The last two times Ginevra had her, Lily tantrummed at the pass over.  He was told this was typical.  Draco wrote it off as her being so young and not fully comprehending he and Harry would return as scheduled.
Draco is at a loss again.  Is this how Harry feels around her?  Turned one way and then the other?  He finds he does have one question though.  “Do you mind me involving myself so much with them?  Is it overstepping?”
“Draco?”
Ginny grins and shakes her head.  “We’re not going to be ex’s with benefits anymore.”
Draco stills.
Draco honest to god snorts at that, making a pfft sound.  “Baby factory.”  He repeats, laughing to himself.  Harry rolls his eyes.  The two of them were slap-happy now.  Harry has his arm around Draco.  Nursing his glass of water.  It was important to hydrate after drinking.

Compromise was important in divorce.
Dad’s been gone for work all week when the weekend finally comes around.  They don’t stay at the manor a lot.  Weekends mostly, but not every one.  They’ve been at the manor lately so Draco can work on the party-tour-dinner stuff he’s planning.
“Oi!”  Dad challenges sharply.  Jamie bets Dad is giving Uncle Ron
“It was my fault -
“That obviously you are one of the top aurors at the ministry.”  Malfoy states matter-of-factly.  “That you have children . . . that you were married.”
He tries not to cringe.  Waiting to observe Draco’s reaction.  His boyfriend studies him.  Expression vulnerable in a way Harry hasn't seen for a while.  But it isn't a rejection.  Harry breathes easier at that, resting his hands on Draco’s hips.
“Daddy, Mrs. Goldstein brought her baby!”  Lily tells her father exuberantly like this is the most fantastic thing that has happened to her all day.  For all Draco knows, that is true.
Draco’s face screws up at that as if to deny the words.  “Harry.”  The man starts in complaint, circling Harry’s wrists with his hands.  Holding him tightly despite their trembling.
It shocked him to his core when he was sentenced to probation and released into his mother’s custody.  He had expected years if not decades in Azkaban.  He deserved them.  The mark on his arm was proof enough of that.  He had taken it gladly after all.
“Who's talking about chances?”  George spars back.  Face going red.
Harry’s situation was entirely different.
A gavel bangs on the table.  “We will reconvene in fifteen minutes.  We expect an answer to whether you will be providing a statement today or not, Mr. Malfoy.  Evidence submitted will be discussed at that time.  Do you understand, Mr. Malfoy?”
“I won’t have much time for the manor.”  Draco argued, hoping to reduce her expectations.  “My work will keep me busy enough.”
“Oh, yes.  The Asian and North American branches are doing well.  It is past time to open in London.  A club of course, if only to upset mummy.  Plus, it will give me another excuse to see you more anyway since you’re certainly not moving back.”
ago.”  Draco responds incredulously.
“That’ll happen.”  Harry comments beside Draco, nodding sagely.  “Maybe you’ll like them better after you get used to them.”
Then he has the sudden sense of where they are.  Two thirty something year old men standing in an intimate-looking embrace at the corner of a street somewhere in muggle London at dusk outside of a pub.  One of the pedestrians in the distance – a man by the sounds of it – shouts a homophobic slur and two more voices call out simultaneously telling the man to shut up.  Another voice pipes up calling out support for them.
Harry lifts his glass in return.  “And you.”
I love writing Lucius.  This chapter is one of my few planned out attempts at serious plot for this story.  I'm too enamored with fluff most of the time.  As always, I own nothing.  Thanks for reading.  All comments and kudos are so very appreciated!
“And you can ask it to bring up a certain album too.”  Potter had demonstrated asking the device aloud, apparently also called seeri, although Draco was unsure how the device was a seeri too.  He imagined because it allowed muggles to see the images.
“That’s alright.”  He says affably kicking his legs out before him and leaning further back into his chair.  “My marriage ended poorly.  It wasn’t publicized, thank Merlin, but it was hard on the family.  My ex and I are complicated at the best of times now, but I guess that’s what happens sometimes in relationships.”
Admittedly, Draco has some knowledge on how to promote fertility and of arcane magics to
Draco would usually take more care getting undressed, but he strips carelessly and practically throws himself on the man who is outright laughing now.  A wonderful expression that accelerates his heartrate as much as the anticipation of being with his boyfriend does.  Working together to remove his boyfriend's clothes.  Harry wipes his hands on his discarded tee before pulling Draco solidly over top him.
The sooner this is over the better.
Her scream is how he remembers it.  High and screeching like nails on a chalkboard, not so different than her laugh had been in life.
He turns them away from the estate over the rolling green hills that are being dusted by snow.  Sun rays break through the clouds and the sky he can see is a brilliant blue.  The trees they pass have the hangings on of a few autumn leaves.  Clinging onto the previous season.  When they have been up about an hour, he takes them down to the country road miles outside the manor’s exterior ward lines.  Driving along the road toward the estate.
“Is it something you did?”  Harry guesses nervousness beginning to knot his stomach as the cooler air in the room hits him unpleasantly.  “Was it during the war?”  He asks.
much.  Most of the time they are at Grimmauld because it is simpler with the children’s schedule.
“I don’t want to do that.”  Harry grouses, wiping a hand over his face.  “Jamie’s going to be at Hogwarts before we know it and you won’t be able to make it up then.”
“You got it.”  Weasley confirms, interrupting Draco’s spiraling line of thought, nodding to them both.  “Besides, you’ll owe us babysitting duty in the future.”
She nods again as if expecting that response.  “He’ll come ‘round.  Give him time.  Ron always needs space to think things through.  Are you going to make a statement?”
There a great, old pine tree had fallen back by the cemetery during the siege.  Cracked well in half so that only the lower trunk remains rooted to the ground.  A sizeable branch cut off the other half will suffice as their Yule log.
Draco crawls forward over him, sliding along Harry’s body.  Smiling in his way that makes Harry's heart thud in excitement.
“Let’s go to tactical, squad.”  The sergeant concludes.
Mrs. Tonks laughs lightly breaking the awkward silence.  “Oh, Cissy.  My goodness.”
“I know that!”  He bristles, trying to sit up.
“Then what happened?”  Doge asks earnestly, forgetting the latte in front of him entirely and the mission at hand.  Eyes bugging as Clearwater spun her tale.  Harry attempts to muffle another sigh as he sits at a table a couple yards from them.  It would break their cover if he reprimanded them now.  He also suspects Doge legitimately forgot the squad was presently charmed to hear each other.  Clearwater just had no shame.  He admired and despaired about that characteristic in her.  She'd been the rookie for two years now and was itching for Doge to take her place as the greenhorn.  Although technically a trainee, Doge was likely going to be assigned to Harry's squad when the man's trainee probationary period ended.
“But that was
Draco squeezes his eyes shut wishing he could be anywhere else.  He can
“Nothing.”  Astoria deflects cheerily.  “I'm just happy you’ve finally given up calling him ‘Potter’ all the time.  Really, Draco.  You two are dating exclusively for goodness sake.”
“Thanks.”  James replies, grin wide.  “I gonna show Dad now.”  He states, holding out his hand for the folded paper.
Draco is surprised at that reaction.  He expected a biting retort.  “The thistlewick was ingenious.”  He praises.  It may be a worthless compliment coming from him, but he feels compelled to offer it.  “Combined with my mincing of the amaranth, we will earn the top spot.”
Jamie and Al appear, both with ornery expressions on their faces.  Harry reminds himself sternly that Ginny can deal with whatever is brewing here.  He hugs them both.  Instructing them to behave and mind their mother.  Al hugs Draco goodbye after his boyfriend frees himself from Lily’s grasp.  Jamie even draws near to offer Draco a goodbye.
There is a poignant silence.  Draco silently counts his breathing to keep himself steady where he stands.  Watching his father’s white-knuckled fists shake on the surface of the table.  Chains still clattering and echoing around the room.
Draco tended to be dressed sharply for work otherwise and he
“I’ll call you pervert, thanks.”  Draco counters.  Unimpressed.
“So this is the first time anyone’s been here since the war?”  Potter asks sounding genuinely curious.
“I want you to stay the night.”  Potter tells him earnestly, peering at him with deep green eyes.  Hopeful.  “That is, if you want – if you’re comfortable.”
“My name is Hyperion.” The half-valkyrie man answers him coolly, expression guarded.  Golden eyes sharp on him.  “Remember it.”
Severus inclines his head slightly.  “I tried to make amends through my actions as you are.  Although, I never did warm to Lily’s child – not like you and Potter’s children.  No, Potter looked too much like
“I’d like to one day.”  He admits.  It’s the first time he has said it aloud.  “If he lets me.”
“You know I cannot stand pity.”  Draco replies icily, lip curling.  “You had fewer choices than I did.  I’m sorry for what
Harry glances to Hermione.  “The gentleman in the pinstriped robes to your left.”
Bixby so long as he allows.  If he does not permit it, please leave him to his work.”  He instructs.
“Oh, Draco.”  His mother lightly chides.
When he pulls back it is to see Draco regarding him, expression conflicted.
There is a longer silence then.  Not a lull at all.  It is a proper silence.  Every Weasley in the room stares.
It's perfect.  Draco is perfect – well, not really, but nearly, and in all the ways Harry loves.  Pale eyelashes fanning over his cheeks and mouth coy.  Harry knows he is stupid for this man.  “I love you.”  He blurts out.
In short: it is a mess.
There is a silence.  Ron orders a drink and they sit quietly.  This would be fine under most circumstances.  Theirs was a friendship where two mates could sit comfortably for long stretches of time.  But too many of their recent encounters had been strained.  They both shift in their seats.  Feeling awkward.  He thinks it's almost humorous how they grimace at each other.  Mirroring uncertainty.
The last time Harry had seen him, Malfoy hadn’t looked much like his father then either.  He had been a half-starved, and grey looking teenager, standing before the Wizengamot contrite and broken.  The only former death eater to acknowledge his guilt – and the youngest.  The man before Harry now had the healthy hair and skin of someone well-nourished who had actually seen the sun in the last month.
Draco studies him for a moment, frown slight on his face.  Jamie is about to ask again when the man sighs and answers.  “Very well, James.  You may
“Yeah, a girl in his class told him that Draco was a blood traitor - only we don’t know what that means.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Telling Ron and Hermione about Draco at the gala by showing them had not gone well.  He had done that step by step with the hope it would make it easier on them.  Revealing his bisexuality first and that he was dating someone.  Then that it was Draco he's seeing.  It didn't seem to help.  He just wants to lay it all out now.  Done with easing people in.
This is more of a filler chapter.  I did not intend on it originally.  It sort of popped up on its own.  But I'm glad it did because Ginny showed up.  So I figured name the chapter after her, right?  None of this is beta read.  I own nothing - only plots.
Ron hums, scratching at his chin.  “He, uh, he gets along with your lot all right.”
“But you like it here.”  Harry protests.  “I can eat the cock vinny thing.”
“Sorry.”  Draco apologizes, squeezing his boyfriend’s hand as much as he can.  Harry’s expression flickers, and the man pinches the bridge of his nose, dislodging his glasses.  Draco watches Harry steady himself.  Feeling awful seeing the man so upset.
“No, Draco.  I don’t mind staying here sometimes.  This isn’t the same place it was.  I wouldn’t stay here if I felt uncomfortable or bring the kids round.”  He responds.  It’s true.  The manor was nothing like the leaden, dark thing he first experienced during the war or the empty ruin he became reacquainted.  No.  Now it was all Draco.  A functional, elegant estate with purpose.  “My home is wherever you are.”
“I don’t want to take potion.  It tastes bad.”  The boy whines, eyeing the bottle in Draco's hand.
“Me too.”  Draco admits, forcing himself not to fidget.  It feels vulnerable saying that, but he has shared so much with Potter already.  “What should we talk about now that we are dating?”
Little hands immediately smush his face as an elbow lands uncomfortably on his chest.  “Papa, wake up!  It’s my birthday!”
“Do you ever want more?”  Astoria queries.
“You make me sad.”  Talbot retorts, turning toward him.
He loves Harry and he cares about these children, but now he is
“I – uh, I want to thank you, Draco.”  Ginevra hesitantly begins with a small smile.  “I didn’t have a chance to the other night at drop off.”
trustworthy.
“So much of me is bad too.”  He counters.  Willing Draco to understand.  Why this line Draco kept between them made no sense.  “I’ve used Unforgiveable Curses.  My actions have led to people's deaths.  I’ve lied.  I’ve hidden things.  Just because so much of that is sanctioned by being an auror or what I did in the war doesn’t mean I didn’t do it.  That it wasn't cruel or wrong.”
“The initial complaint included a compromising photograph that needs to be addressed further.  That, in addition to the statement collected from a Mr. Ronald Weasley has raised concerns about security.”
“Draco dressed me.”
“We could give her a good home.”  Jamie asserts stubbornly.  He had hoped Luna would help them, but now he’s not so sure if she is.
“Do you like?”  His boyfriend questions huskily.  Face intent and a flash of something uncertain in his dilated eyes.
“Hi.” Jamie says shortly sitting down in his chair.  Al is chattering about school and drawing with crayons on the paper placemat, glasses askew.  The man – Draco – is nodding along, trying to follow, turning a bit to acknowledge them too with a nod and a slight smile.  Once Al gets going it’s hard to get him to stop talking.  Jamie knew that better than anyone since they shared a bedroom whenever Teddy stayed over and Al talks in his sleep.  Lily walks around to Dad and buries her face in his side, hiding it from the stranger.  She didn't like talking to new people.  Mum called her ‘slow to warm.’
“Really?”
“I like bathrooms.”  Draco says suddenly.  Still facing away from Harry.  “The sound of running water always comforted me.  So I hid in them all the time as a child when I was upset.  Thought no one could disturb me there.  I was not allowed to be upset; you see – not with my parents at any rate.  It’s stupid.”
Al flies toward the fence and disembarks.  Leaning his tiny broom against the post and jogging over to join his sister.  “Draco!  Dad!”  His younger son shouts happily.  Dark hair disheveled.  Jamie and Freddie follow at a more sedate pace.  His older son leading the way.
Today Ginevra is dressed in a large, comfortable looking wool sweater with leggings on underneath.  It is an outfit he could easily picture on Astoria during a lazy day.  Stylish but casual.  He feels less well dressed today in comparison.  It is typical for him to take great pride in his wardrobe.  However, between Albus’ intermittent fits of vomiting and Lily fussing and demanding to be held wrinkling his shirt further, he finally conceded defeat.  Instead, he dons some of Harry’s sweatpants and an old auror department tee, finishing the ensemble with his robe and slippers.  Harry seemed to like it though judging by the double take he noticed his boyfriend make earlier in the morning.

like it’s just her.
“It appears so.”  Draco concurs.
The younger members of his squad tell him that Astoria has quite the social media presence and that it is apparently
Harry scratches his side and head at once.  Expression considering.  “I lived with muggles.  If I'd suddenly sprouted purple spots even Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would have taken me to hospital.”  He says.
There is a sound of approaching footsteps causing the three of them freeze.  Maybe they weren’t the only ones to overhear the commotion?  Lily clamps both hands over her mouth, eyes growing wide.  Al’s got his hand on the crup’s snout to muffle any errant noise.  Jamie presses his ear to the door to listen.  He can hear a woman humming a song.  Her voice tugs at his memory.  He waits for an impossibly long moment, trying to discern if anyone else is out there.
The man gets down on one knee extending a hand to Maud who goes to him easily.  Rolf maneuvers Maud around.  Examining her from snout to tail.  “This is an adult crup.”  He tells them cheerily.  “I’d say maybe six years old considering the state of her teeth and fur.  Based on her undocked tail, I doubt she’s been in the care of wizards.  We usually try to hide crups’ magical traits in case they enter the muggle world.  She seems healthy enough, but it would be best to have her more thouroughly checked out.”  Rolf advises giving Maud a good scratch behind her ears.
He is a smidgen of an exhibitionist.  He can admit that.  It doesn't entirely make sense.  Best not to look at it too closely really.  He knows.  Merlin, he knows.  How many times has he changed plans or avoided public spaces in order to not be photographed or reported on?
She had loved him once – in her way.  Or perhaps, more accurately, his aunt had been proud he was born pureblooded and male.  Another link in the Malfoy and Black family lines.  There are pictures of her holding him.  His small, chubby hands pulling at her loose, black curls.  She still appeared human in those photographs.  Adoring even.
“No.”  Draco responds, expression bemused.
Ron squints at him but remains unmoved.  Harry is appalled.
James appears baffled at that.  “I’m not stupid.”  He responds hotly, crossing his arms.
Draco leans forward.  “I believe you would enjoy their version of coq au vin.  It is chicken and Pansy absolutely raved about it.”
James scowls, expression darkening.  “Stop acting like you’re my dad!  You’re
to touch any of the fragile decoration stuff Draco has on tables and shelves.  That makes Dad and Draco to say things like:
“I’m so thankful you were there to pull him out.”  Harry states sounding hoarse.  “I can never thank you enough.”
“I like men.”  Draco mutters.  Quiet enough that Harry nearly doesn’t catch it.  The words.  Then it takes a moment before he comprehends them, and he can mitigate the surprise on his face.  He can’t deny that does send him for a loop.
James is tucked into the nook inside the stairwell.  Brow furrowed and a frown etched on his face.  He can tell the moment the boy realizes he is there.
“I suppose I’ll divulge.”  Draco allows, twisting his fingers in his lap, obviously feeling awkward.  “Alexander Geranos.”
It is funny though.  Ginevra has these expressions that he sees occasionally on the children especially James, but he does not know much about who she is as a person.  Harry only ever speaks positively of her in front of the children and his friends.  But the few times Draco cautiously asked his boyfriend about her, Harry gave short answers.  Saying the two of them were better off as friends than as a married couple.
“You can try.  I’ll send some pamphlets along with you though I’m certain you’ve done them before when you first came to us.”  Hargreeves says, removing the whirring contraption and standing up.  “Our research team has been experimenting with a salve that may be of some help too.  I believe you fit the criteria for that experimental trial.  We’ve made significant progress with dermal treatments to blood curses.”
Harry’s heart soars at her thoughtful words.  It was funny how much Ginny and Molly were alike considering their famous rows and completely inverse wants in life.  But Harry could hear the echo of his ex-wife’s words from what her mother was saying now.
“It is not an unreasonable question.”  Malfoy responds indignantly voice sharp, professional poise crumbling into outright suspicion.  “I have only been back two months.”  Malfoy declares, raising two fingers dramatically in the air, then spreading his arms widely to emphasize his next words.  “And here you are!  Harry Potter!  Our great savior!  Do you know, I’ve had three other DMLE employees in, one right after the other?  None of them even suffering from maligning blood curses!  Supposedly asking their
He’d been a patient there ever since.
Harry cringes, expression caught.  Obviously thinking through his response.  “Maybe.”  His boyfriend hedges, stopping them in front of a public bench, and pulling Draco to sit down beside him.
“I am glad you had him then.”
symbol!”  Draco cries, brow furrowing and clutching at the blankets around him and twisting them in his hands.  “Not mine.  Dumbledore’s.  Yours too.  Everyone’s who fought against . . .
“You are always welcome here, Potter.”  Draco responds tilting his head curiously at Harry.  White blonde hair falling forward from where it's tied back on top where he's let it grow longer over the undercut.  “This is your place as much as mine.”
“You good?”  Harry questions, brow furrowing.  "Talk to me."
relying on hit wizard support.  They were back up for a reason.  Aurors were considered the brains
“Bienvenue à Bruxelles!  Welcome to Brussels, travelers.”  An older, lightly accented ministry witch greets them.  “Passports please.”  She prompts.
“You have it.”  Draco offers with a sincerity that pierces.  Like it wasn't something hard earned and treasured.
“And that’s another thing –
“No.”  Draco cuts him off, shaking his head.  “Never.”
“What’s that?” Lily chimes.  “Is that a hard job?”  Al questions simultaneously.
“Thank you.”  Draco leans forward to kiss him.  “Now get out of here, Potter.  I know the children are expecting you.”
He and Draco reach for each other before he can tell who started and then they’re hugging.  His arms tightening around his boyfriend and burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, breathing deeply before the lump in his throat threatens to overwhelm him.
“When did you hire Olta?”
children and my
“Harry.”  Draco whines sounding desperate.  Mouth opening obediently to let Harry in like he wants, laving at him in return.  Sweat and oil making their efforts smoother.
“No, I am afraid I don’t know, Potter.  Care to inform the class?”  Draco retorts brow raising in challenge.  It is just to tease Potter of course, but Draco would appreciate some clarification.  Potter has consistently dumbfounded him after all.
“Am I overstepping?” Draco asks worriedly.  He tried to not take on a role that was not his.  He never wanted to get between Harry and the children.  “You must tell me if I am.  I’m
“I have – I suppose you could call him my boyfriend.”  Draco answers, eyes sliding over again to look at Dad.  Dad grins back.  Looking keen.  Jamie thinks they have a joke but he’s not sure what it is.  Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron had ‘looks’ like that too sometimes.
Lily quiet.”
He does not care that this boy yelled at him.  Shouted hateful things at him.  None of it matters.  All he has in this moment is concern and affection for him.  It is that which grounds him while a part of him tries to wander away.  A fleeting memory of his mother holding him similarly coming to mind.
The sad bit is he can understand.  The wizarding world had only ever been indifferent or at worst cruel to Greg.  The youngest of his brothers and rather ignored by his parents.  Never particularly interested or talented in any magical craft.  Then the war came, and Greg had been bullied and blackmailed by his death eater relatives into doing their biding.  Greg, at least, had not wanted to join the death eaters and likely would have been killed along with Draco at the end of the battle if the dark lord had won.  Having fought on the opposite side.
The conference room is nearly filled by the time he arrives.  Most of his squad, a couple trainees, and office staff filling out the rest of the seats.  Twysley, his sergeant, and number two is at the podium preparing for the briefing.
“And I informed you it was rude to ask your elder something so personal, but you persisted."  The voice continues in its unhurried manner, almost bored in its cadence.  "You were always stubborn.  Demanding – like your father.”
Lily skips up to Harry looking ornery.  Dark eyes sparkling mischievously.  “Jamie and Al broke the attic.”  She tells her father in a sing-song tone.
Draco’s face crumples at that.  “You’re acting like you can’t trust me.  You promised to do your best to prevent your work from hurting me – but this – this is hurting me.”
The law that he breaks first is providing protection.
Conversely, Harry simply fire called Andromeda and asked her straight out.  He had expected a debate.  They had had their share of disagreements over the years.  But they have always respected each other.  In many ways he owes Andromeda, she was the first person to teach him how to take care of a child.  How to be consistent and good to them.  How to change a nappy.  So it was a surprise that she agreed with little fuss to spending the winter solstice with them.
“About Father mocking me?  I don’t know, Potter.  I rather thought Arthur Weasley was more supportive of his children.”
“Nuh-uh!”  Lily protests loudly crossing her arms.
Harry is the incredible lover.  Draco will only ever admit it to him during the act.  Draco’s only saving grace is he does not make a lot of sense when the man has Draco's cock in his mouth and his fingers inside Draco.  Harry keeps his head propped against a small heap of their clothes, sucking Draco in further as his fingers explore.
“I’ve known Malfoy for years!”  Seamus exclaims, switching tactics to the group’s general entertainment.  “We were boyhood friends!”
“Shit, sorry.”  He apologizes with a grunt.  Grimacing at the smarting pain shooting from his bad hip.  Fuck, that wasn’t attractive.  He runs his hands up Draco’s sides, catching the man as best he can and rucking his shirt up.
“It is.”  Draco affirms with a nod, swirling his wand to highlight each of their calendars’ weeks accordingly.  Orange for the children's stays with their mother.
“Do we get to be friends?”  Draco questions tentatively.
He breathes deeply through his nose, determined. "One of the few good traits I continue to admire in you is your affection for Mother, but you would not afford me the same for the person I love.  I have never loved anyone like this.  I did not know if I could.  I thought it was burned out of me.  And with all this - despite everything that has happened - I still care about you . . . even now though you do not deserve it."
“What?”  He asks, scrunching his nose.  A death what?
Draco nods, expression obviously miserable.  “It is.”
The least
It doesn't take much.  Draco is mostly draped on top of him.  Head leaning on his shoulder as Harry gets a hand in Draco’s pants and jacks him off.  Watching Draco’s eye lashes flutter.  Breathing picking up as the man gets close.  Body solid against him.  Draco releases a soft moan when he comes.  Semen landing on Harry’s stomach where his shirt's still unbuttoned.
“But what if they say no?”   Al asks sounding small.
Where it's just the two of them.
“He used to torture me."  Draco accuses, past caring that the guards are listening.  "He used to force me to torture others.  Every time I was harmed in that place.  Every time Mother was disrespected and threatened.  All of that happened in our home!  You permitted it by not allowing the core to fight back.
Draco drapes his arms around Harry’s shoulders, leaving his hands buried in his boyfriend’s hair, and kissing him deeply.  Harry drags his hands up and down his back.  Stopping their circuit to knead occasionally at Draco’s arse, pulling their groins into contact.  It is one of the slower times.  They had fucked earlier that day before setting out to sightsee.  Only returning as the sun set and their stomachs were full of dinner.
know that’s one of the most difficult potions to meet all the criteria necessary for it to work.”
Jamie never knew that.  He knew his Potter grandparents died in the war when Dad was little, but he didn’t know they were killed by the main bad guy.  Al shrinks beside him, tensing.  Jamie suspects this is the first time his brother is hearing it too.
“Then Rolf and I will find her a good home.”  Luna assures him walking over to Al and ruffling the top of his head.  Then turning to Lily who releases her mouth and goes to hug Luna around her leg.
If he takes a bit longer to provide an answer, then it is a suitable consequence for the boys plopping themselves rudely into adults’ conversations.
“Please?”  Draco questions breathily.  Eyelids heavy as he opens them, holding Harry’s gaze.
He did too, but no one needs to know that.
“Malfoys live at the manor.”  Mother intoned firmly, expression perturbed at the very thought of him
“But do you feel obligated because I set this up?”  Harry asks waving his hand around them indicating the cottage.  It wasn't much, but Draco had been unfailingly polite throughout this new chapter in their . . . friendship?  Whatever this was.  “That wasn’t my intent.  This is meant to be your home – not mine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You cannot shield him from everything, Harry.”  He advises.  And really, he felt Harry sheltered the children more than necessary at times.  “This was a challenge he was going to face at some point no matter what.”
This is all to say Jamie became used to living at Grimmauld with his dad distractedly leaving half-drunk cups of tea in every room.  Used to only seeing his mum on holidays or the occasional weekend.   Dad getting them up in the morning and frog marching a half-asleep Al to the loo to use the toilet.  Then going to get Lily up.  Shrugging on his school uniform and having toast march over to his place at the kitchen table for him to smear with butter and jam.  Lily fussy about having to be up in the morning at all and pouting while Kreacher chided her to eat breakfast.  Al whining about his socks not matching.  Dad rushing in, grabbing his own toast, and ushering them to the main floo on the ground floor to take them to school.
He doesn't want it to end.
It is late and Harry is tired.
Mrs. Weasley’s face is read as she dabs at the corner of her eye.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t know he was there.  Ginny and I – it’s stupid, but to him, it probably sounded like I don’t like Draco.”
But it is odd.
Harry’s dreams are a confused mishmash of everything going on.  He is searching for his potions book so he can pass his exam.  Running into members of the Order of the Phoenix at every wrong turn down a corridor.  All of them pointing him the wrong way to the Prince’s book.  At one point, he is under the invisibility cloak approaching Slughorn asleep at his desk.  The book laid out in front of him.  Harry sneakily grabs the book once Slughorn turns to the side in his chair and resumes snoring.  His heart beating fast from the risk of being caught.  The room seems to sway around him and transforms into one of the old, dusty abandoned classrooms.  Pitch black except for one guttering candle and his girlfriend standing in front of him.  Smiling at him with an enticing expression.
“None of them are as pretty as you.”  Harry deflects.  It is true after all and the way Draco’s cheeks and ears flush in embarrassment makes it worth saying.
“You just don’t get married.”  Draco replied nonchalantly.
Dad was the main problem.  He and Al had begged for a pet of their own for years.  Every Christmas.  Every birthday.  Nothing too big.  A cuddly puffskein would have done.  Mum would’ve gotten them one - he’s sure of it - but she didn’t have them most of the time.  It was so unfair.  Plus, dad wasn’t even here right now which further complicated things.  Jamie is certain if they show Draco the crup first the man would refuse them out of hand.  Or Bixby would find the crup and send her away.
“You want me to leave?”  Harry restates feeling astonished.  The reality of the severity of their argument crashing around him.  “The manor?”
Teddy rolls his eyes.  “It looks like an adult lives here now.”
It is raining buckets several weeks later when Potter meets him after work.  Hair damp and smile winning.  They stop at a muggle pub for dinner.  It is kind of their thing.  It is dating what they are doing now.  Harry Potter is dating him.  Draco Malfoy.  Astoria literally squealed when he told her over fire call.  He had had her house elf wake her up the night Potter told him that he fancied him.
Draco was glad.  Gleeful even when he heard the news.  Laughed hysterically in his cell for what felt like hours.  He felt mad then.  Just as he would calm another wave of hysterics would hit him.  Again and again.  His cheeks had hurt from all the grinning he did.  The guards mocked him, spat on him, but what did he care?  His mother was out of there.  The dark lord would never hurt her again.
“Check mate.”  Ron declares, clearly lying in wait.
“Oh.”  He voices, feeling wrong footed.  “I, er – sorry.  I didn’t realize.”  He probably should have though.  He wasn’t thinking.
The man raises one inquisitive brow.  “Calm yourself, Potter.  I’m not even undressed yet.”  He says teasingly, hand going to his belt and unfastening it.
much better.”  Harry agrees, grinning.  Relieved that Draco appears to be having a good time despite their change in plans.  It is chilly out still; but their coats, food, and drink keep them warm.  Draco is stupidly attractive in his dark green winter coat and the silver scarf wrapped around his neck.  Pale hair ruffled by the wind.  Skin slightly pink from the cold.  Leftover peanut sauce left on the corner of his mouth that his tongue quickly licks away.
“Hello, Mrs. Tonks.”  He and Al automatically greet in unison with Lily stuttering behind in her hello.  Suddenly seeming shy to encounter more adults as she steps closer to him and Al.
the time and still couldn’t fix anything.  It felt like she was only there because she was pregnant and then because of my injury.  There was a lot of resentment between us and we didn’t talk about
He loves magic.
Walking along the street in the early grey morning light is a drastic difference from the inside.  Draco moves to his right side, pulling his arm over his shoulder.  Harry leans on him.
There is no end to it.  His vision swims.  Blinding him.  He has the sense of falling.  Frigid air whooshing past him as he goes.  He lands with a crash on hard floor.  Head knocking back roughly.
“There are always consequences, Harry.”  Draco interrupts, getting Harry’s attention.  Eyes still shut.  “Did you really think I would be allowed anywhere near
The interloping boys crosses his arms looking smug.  “That Malfoy bloke your dad is with is a death eater, Potter.  My mum and dad say he’s a real piece of shite.  They say your dad is always trying to save people but now he’s gone too far.”
Mother was supportive of his return to Britain and his new employment.  Pleased to see him pursue knowledge and create.  Those aspirations she could understand.  Employment and earning wages were strange concepts to her otherwise.  What she outright refused to accept was his choice to live in London and not Wiltshire.
It's the man sitting behind the desk.
This was the strangest of all the statements Harry has heard since the trials began.  None of the other death eaters claimed any responsibility for their roles in the war.  They had justified, denied, cried, and raged; but never owned their actions.
It's a heady experience.  He gasps as Draco takes him in.  His senses narrowing for a few minutes to the velvet heat of Draco’s mouth.  Watching Draco blow him and having people walk drunkenly by, laughing and boisterous, appearing little more than a few feet away.  So many of them had ogled Draco tonight.  He was never jealous of the women.  They never had a chance.  But the men.  Harry has always been a possessive person.  He accepted that long ago.
The hearing room’s doors open wide and he watches Ron being escorted in by a guard.  Harry does his best to maintain a neutral demeanor.  He is angry though.  Angry that Draco has to be put through this because of something Ron said.
“It has been,” Draco cuts in, eyes still focused on the chessboard.  Frowning down at his remaining pieces.  “Challenging.”
“I do.”
There is more clapping.  Harry catches sight of Ron and Hermione in the crowd.  Hermione has that look of inspiration.  Something has got the gears whirling tonight.  Ron seems to know it too from the way he glances down at his wife, smile spreading on his face.
“Bloody fucking hell.”  Bill swears.  Fleur rests a hand on his shoulder.  George’s mischievous expression immediately falls, eyes widening in disbelief.  The others in the room visibly tense.  Molly sways once where she is standing in the kitchen and walks over to hold the back of her husband’s chair.
He observes Harry take in this information.  Automatically tensing for his boyfriend’s reaction.  He can sense without seeing Astoria do the same.  Simone offered this information casually near the end of dinner so she must feel comfortable with Harry and it was her choice to tell people.  He would always honor that, but he has seen this scenario play out badly before even with people he liked.  Draco can only hope Harry will be accepting of his friend.
“Draco.”
“Yours.”  Draco replies mindlessly.  Eyelids fluttering as his body moves automatically.  Currents of sensation flooding him from all sides.  Thoughts held off as he puts all his efforts into chasing that particular sensitive exploding feeling.
The last time they hook up is during the Christmas hols a couple of years later.  Ginny tucked the kids into bed and promised to come over early to watch them open pressies then slipped into Harry’s bedroom.  It was an easy thing to do.  Something they did on and off.  No strings.  No expectations.  They were always good at that part of their relationship.  It was reliable.  Comforting at times.  They both talked about seeing other people.  Ginny had been through three fairly serious boyfriends by that point.  She was still seeing one on and off.  Harry still admitting sheepishly to casually sleeping around.  Told her in the quiet of his bedroom that he never wanted a relationship again.  At least, not until the kids were in Hogwarts.
“I would never dream of threatening you.”  She replies, suddenly coquettish.  “You are an auror after all.”
His hands are scrapped and bloody, but he cannot feel them.  Bits of broken glass embedded in his hand from where he removed the boy’s broken glasses.  Wand tightly gripped despite the pain of it as he stands stiffly.
“Are we in a museum?”  Al whispers in awe, gaping around him.
“Yes.”  Harry answers bluntly.
“Who else can verify this?”
“So you were both rowing?!”  Harry summarizes, crossing his arms.  “Why am I not surprised?”
“I do too.”  Harry agrees recalling that dark forest years ago, cold hands desperate at his neck.  Saving him.  “I owe her a life debt.”
“Dad?”  Jamie starts after a quiet few seconds.
“I'm . . . sorry, Malfoy.”  Ron apologizes, mouth strained as he says the words.  “I may not like you, but all this was uncalled for.  I did not claim that you obstructed any of Harry’s cases in any way.”
Mrs. Weasley obviously takes great pride in her baking ability.  Every cake he has seen from her has been many tiered and decorated with the interests of the recipient.  Sparklers lighting on top.  Lily has to stand on her chair to blow out her candles.  The topic from a moment ago completely forgotten.
“What?!”  He yelps, taken aback.
“Yes.”  Harry says, frustrated, kicking out his right leg.  He was volunteering for this after all.  He could leave any time and not deal with Malfoy’s accusations.  Although, what Malfoy said about the DMLE employees coming in for appointments did not ring quite right.  It would not be the first time someone at the DMLE had toed the line into auror territory.  He may have to look into that.  “Please, if it will put you off this.”
“It’ll be okay, Al.  It’s just the strap.  We’ll fix it.”  He consoles.
His boyfriend looks pleased at that statement.  Cheeks flushing briefly where he stands slightly behind his mother.  It is a good start considering the history Harry has with this woman.  All the good and bad.  But he likes to make Draco happy.  He can do that easily enough by welcoming Narcissa into their home.
Uncle Ron puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.  “You don’t bother him, Jamie.  This also might be something you ask Malfoy, er – Draco about too.”
“I think Uncle Ron should be nicer to Draco."  Jamie decides to say.  Weighing what he knows now.  "Draco’s boring, but you like him.”
The waiter arrives and delivers their pizzas.  A large cheese and a small spinach and mushroom.  He and Al each get a piece of the cheese as Dad helps Lily with her plate.  Jamie loves the way the gooey cheese gets stringy with every bite.  All the best foods are eaten with hands after all.
Draco is the one to separate after several agonizing minutes of this, spit connecting their mouths.  Bending to bite Harry’s clavicle which is one hundred percent okay by him.  It thrilled him when Draco got bitey.  Harry just wants to come.  He can feel it close in by the way his peripheral vision is blinking in and out.  Draco chanting his name pushing him along.
“He’s okay.”  Jamie adds.  Draco was a boring bloke when it came down to it.  He didn’t really play around like Dad, but he was good to them Jamie supposes.  “He makes Dad happy.”  He says finally, thinking of Dad’s goofy expression whenever he looked at Draco.
Father drew himself up, affecting confidence.  Another show of his pride.  Draco was ashamed of him.  Ashamed of his father’s denials.  Refusing to acknowledge entirely what he did.  Spinning stories.  How he damned himself.  The dark lord had steered him wrong according to Lucius, but the essential tenets of dark lord's cause remained close to his heart, not that he admitted
Draco is kind enough to let him store the motorbike in one of the empty stalls of the stables he rebuilt on the estate.  A good bit of Harry feels guilty for moving the bike from his ex-wife’s house to his boyfriend’s family’s - whatever.  It just doesn't strike him quite right even though he and Draco are cohabitating now.  Harry is grateful though and it does give him something useful to do besides wander around the manor’s grounds while Draco fiddles with breaking into the main building.
The elf glares at his master but complies with a deep bow toward Draco and a pop away out of the room.  Draco hopes he did not offend the elf.  Potter clears his throat, getting Draco’s attention again.
I'm nearly done writing the next chapter.  That will complement this one.  The plan is for the next few to be fluffy with some attempts at smutty fun before getting to the most serious arc.  I'm a sucker for the fluff.  Ya'll know that by now.  As always, I own nothing but plots.
“Are you okay with staying here with the kids or would you rather I send them to their grandmother’s?  Molly and I have an arrangement, and I don’t know what you have planned for today.”  Harry says in a rush, dressing hastily.  Clothing hopping to attention for the man to put on.
“True.”  Father acknowledges, expression mocking.  “I would have never sunken so low.  You get that from your mother’s side of the family - unfortunately.”
“Shut up.”  Draco snaps obviously catching Harry checking him out, but it lacks heat.
They had stopped at the café before going back to Draco’s flat.  Waiting outside for Harry.  His boyfriend had actually been in the restroom of the shop at the time.  Draco wonders what picture the photographer would have snapped once Harry returned to their group.
Harry has recently spent a lot of long nights in Robards’ office reviewing lists of names of probable and definitively identified death eaters.  Now that he is an auror, all his workdays are dedicated to tracking death eater movement and hunting the remainder of them down.  It is a natural transition for him.
Dad takes a seat in front of them.  Eyes calculating.  “Knock yourself out.”  He replies, gesturing from Draco to the children sitting across from them.
They work together to reposition as Harry angles him upward, rearranging Draco legs to hook them loosely around his waist.  It strikes Draco how comfortable they are with each other.  How calm and intimate it feels to be in this bubble with Harry.
“Let me ask her then.”  Harry offers.  “We can make a decision from there.”
They do not like him.  That is made abundantly clear.  There are scarcely any British students here, but his reputation and family name proceed him.  Rumors spread.  He even overhears some of them.  No one directly addresses him about his past – or speaks to him past the necessities.  He is outright excluded by about a quarter of the students he meets.  For all the higher purposes that academia serves, the hierarchy has placed him directly at the bottom.
They had the cottage by that point and Harry had tried to leave.  Temper flaring, causing the glassware in their small kitchen to tremble in terror.  He stumbled out the backdoor.  Pissed seven ways from Sunday.  Headed toward their shed where he stored the motorbike.
Harry nods, minding his tongue.  “I'm not here to have a fight with Malfoy.”
