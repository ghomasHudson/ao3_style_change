“The ghost is back,” he says. Potter looks confused, like Draco isn’t making sense. “In my garden,” Draco explains. He’s being very patient with Potter, really. Potter, with his messy hair and his eyes turning back to that electric green as he watches them, as the charm wears off. Potter with his earnestness and his smiles for people who aren’t Death Eaters. Who aren’t Draco.
Draco would know this face anywhere. He’s known it in pleasure and pain. In sleep and in play. He’s known it serious and he’s known it laughing. Harry’s green eyes stare back at him, in the Gryffindor prince’s clothes.
“I don’t believe you informed Draco of your plans,” she finally says. “No doubt, you were quite carried away in other… pursuits.”
“Lily gave that to me, actually,” she says, her voice very quiet and her eyes far away. “Harry’s mother. My sister.”
“I’ve wanted to retire for awhile now,” he pushes on. “Just because I don’t want to be an Auror anymore, or in the Ministry at all. It had nothing to do with you, or with us, or everyone knowing about us.”
“You’re two moves away from losing your king,” the ghost of Draco Malfoy sneered. “Attacking that rook with your bishop was a terrible idea.”
Malfoy shifts his gaze to him, one corner of his mouth twitching up. “Yes, Potter. I didn’t expect plant grafting to be in your arsenal of talents.”
“Yes. It took awhile to— extricate myself. I was never supposed to leave at all. There’s a lot of expectation around family and tradition.”
Granger just looks at him. There’s soot on her forehead. He knows he must be covered with it himself. “I’ll need you in the morning,” she says quietly. “Please go get some rest and come in early tomorrow.”
And then nearly five weeks later, on a dead end stakeout he’d been called to back Potter up on, the tension broke like a storm cloud, in thunder and hot breath in each other’s ears. He would never forget, no matter how many times they’d fucked each other since, the look on Potter’s face when he dropped to his knees and took the tip of Potter’s cock between his lips; the way Potter’s bottom lip had fallen, like the pleasure was dragging it down, and how his eyelids had fluttered shut as Draco tasted the salty slit with his tongue, and then open again as he pushed his lips further up the shaft and sucked. The seconds went all slow and heavy between them. A strange, sympathetic magic.
Draco looks down, and picks at the buttons holding his coat closed. “I’m not sure anyone has, except me.” He sighs. “I can’t remember the last time Blaise left his house, to tell you the truth. I think I might actually be the only one his wards let in anymore, too.”
Malfoy shivers, almost imperceptibly, but Harry notices. He always notices. He is fine-tuned to Malfoy.
he thinks, when they’re lying under his blankets later. Draco messy-haired on his pillow, his lashes fluttering softly as he tries to stay awake. Harry presses his mouth to Draco’s shoulder, and watches the smile tug at the lips across from him. And he thinks:
“Shit.” Draco takes a long draw from his glass. “I didn’t think about where you were going to sleep.”
Granger smiles grimly at him, and his McGonagall comparison has never been more accurate. “I’ll send over all your paperwork to keep you busy, Malfoy.”
But of course, the best thing about Malfoy as a partner is that Harry never has to explain. Harry blinks, and suddenly Malfoy is right in front of him. Very slowly, Malfoy leans in and presses a finger into the skin just behind the hinge of Harry's jaw. He waits there, silent, as if he's counting something. Harry is aware of the breath moving in and out of his lungs, of Malfoy's breath warm against his cheek, and the trace of citrus cologne left on the collar of his shirt. He can feel his blood rushing now through his body, feel his nerve endings flare as if waking from a long, dormant winter. Harry's body, an unexpected miracle once again.
Potter comes back with another young man, large and lumbering. “This is my cousin, Dudley. Dudley, Draco Malfoy. He’s interested in one of the things your mum is selling.”
He thinks about love. About the things people will do for the ones they love. The lines they’ll cross and the messes they’ll make.
Somewhere else ended up being Harry’s tiny flat in Shoreditch. Malfoy kept walking around it, from the front door they closed behind them in long strides to the far back wall, which was Harry’s bedroom, big enough for one queen mattress.
Draco narrows his eyes. “If this flat is such a disappointment, you could always stay at the Manor. No one would ever suspect you of being there.”
“It still looks like your hair— all cowlicks and shag, as if you’ve never seen a comb in your entire life.”
Millicent’s brow wrinkles. “I’m not really sure. Just grunt work, running errands, that kind of thing. Cassius does a lot of organizing, you know? Politics. I don’t have the head for any of that— I’m well happy with my beasts.”
“Don’t you, Potter?” Malfoy was studying him again. “You’re a newly promoted Auror. Hero of the wizarding world.”
Evers cracks a smile, showing off the thick gap between his front teeth. “That’s right. Just like you. We take care of our own here on the island.”
“I’d better get these guys over to their new boxes before they get mad at me and swarm.” He stands up, and so does Ginny. She takes his empty mug from him.
She smiles, and snags a mimosa from Guido as he passes. “Thank you,” she tells the elf, and he nods his head on the way back into the house.
“No.” Draco pulls down a new bottle of Ogden’s and looks at Potter. “I suppose we haven’t. Firewhisky?”
They both froze. Malfoy had a blue-flowered porcelain tea cup in hand, halfway up to his mouth, and Harry was dripping rain water all over the polished wooden floors. A older lady, with purple-tinted hair and large pink glasses came out from the back room, wiping her hands on her apron.
“Of course I’ll agree. I’ll have to get approval from Salazar, but that’s mostly formality. We can’t afford a war right now, and this allows him to save face as well.”
Potter is standing in the doorway of the kitchen, bare chested, his flannel pajama pants hanging low on his hips. His hair is a mess, and there are dark pink patches along his collarbone and neck where Draco’s mouth had been last night.
He remembers now, the way Lucius had smiled up at him when he managed to hover a good eight feet up in the air. He remembers his own wild excitement, the joy splitting his cheeks around his grin. And Lucius, seen from above, his eyes wrinkling in the corners where he was smiling, too.
“Pansy.” She stops, surprised. “About the election,” he continues. “And the bombing, and the anonymous tips to Granger.”
Eventually, he realizes that the crowd has thinned considerably. Lucius is gone. Draco rises to his feet from the chair he’d slumped into, and stands very still for a moment as he gains his balance. He moves toward the door, and he seems to be walking faster than normal while his surroundings struggle to keep up. He thinks he can just make it to the Floo—
"It feels like…it's mine to do." How to explain the forest, and what it felt like to wake up? How to describe the scent of crushed pine needles filling his head even now?
Potter finally speaks. “Why would they plan a rally, and invite the press, if they had no intention of carrying through with it?”
“I don’t, Millie. Calm down.” He looks around, but everyone is engaged in their own conversations. “I swear. It’s just a— feeling I have.”
out of nothing. He didn’t float in through a window or door, he didn’t come down the chimney or climb out of a portrait. One moment the armchair by the window was empty, and the next moment there was a silvery, translucent Malfoy sitting in it.
But Draco doesn’t think of them like that at all. He doesn’t blame Potter. He’s not sure he ever did. When Draco thinks about that day he thinks about the way the light beamed silver through the heavy panes of the bathroom windows, and the way the water on the floor made the sounds around him echo strangely— softer, like the edges of everything were being sanded down, smoothed by his own breath in his ears. He remembers how heavy his body felt, the way his mind seemed to wander, to float out of himself like a dog slipped its tether.
“I see,” said Hermione, and she nodded. “I’m going to have to get back to you on this, Harry. It’s going to take me some considerable—”
She smiles again, and this time it’s one of her real smiles: warm and a little crooked. “Goodbye, Harry,” she says.
market”— Potter makes air quotes with his hands— “I could help her out and list them for her. Supposedly, that tea cosy is the only one they made. Some sort of manufacturing error. Luna told me that made it more valuable.”
—it’s too much. Draco doesn’t know what to do with so much all at once. He turns his face away, hides in the crook of Harry’s neck where he smells and tastes like salt and sunshine.
It’s a sharp, overwhelming pleasure, Potter thrusting into him. He wants more, curls his heels into the back of Potter’s thighs to pull him deeper, to feel his belly pressing and sliding against his swollen, desperate cock. Potter laces his fingers into Draco’s, their hands fisted together above Draco’s shoulders, on either side of his head. Potter pushes his weight into them; he pins Draco to the bed and he moves him with only the force of his hips snapping back and forth against Draco’s. In and out of Draco, stroking and burning him up on the inside.
Naples was supposed to be a dead end. They’d only sent him to tick the box, to say they’d checked the rumor out. But there was Macnair, in an ill-fitting khaki suit, eyes locked with his. There was the particular, weird light in Macnair’s eyes that fugitives sometimes got when they had already decided that they were not returning home, no matter what.
The longest night ends in a gauzy wash of pink dawn and a modest feast for everyone. The rest of the meat they salt and store for the remainder of winter and the spring ahead of them.
Blaise spreads his hands out in front of him and arches his brows. It’s a face he makes a lot around Harry. He really is genuinely fond of Blaise.
Malfoy was a little stiff when he sat down, but he nodded his thanks when Harry handed him a paper plate piled high with food. Harry dug into his own plate eagerly, pretending not to watch as Malfoy picked delicately with his fork.
“Granger?” Draco flips open the file and pulls out five photographs, laying them out in a line. “You think she’ll be Minister before Our Patron Saint Potter?”
Potter sighs, and Draco glances out the window again, just to check. The ghost has drifted closer, and he feels a strange, skittering dread crawl up his spine. “It keeps coming,” he whispers.
It’s silent now in the bullpen, all the murmuring ended. “I want the full weight of the Auror Department behind this,” Robards finishes. “Let’s get to work.”
Draco watches the small, slender bone in Potter’s wrist jump, over and over, with the movement of his hand. He can observe all the minute details of Potter, the tiniest, everyday, extraordinary things, and never feel satisfied.
It wasn’t possible, was it? He and Malfoy weren’t built to love each other. He and Malfoy were a flash point, a coin flipping over itself endlessly. Collision and explosion.
“Precisely,” says Granger. “McLaggen’s public schedule was cleared, but our anonymous source says he was up in Scotland on a hunting trip, and that he never left the location.”
Once Harry started making the lists in his head, they took on a life of their own. Part doomsday roll call, part comforting litany of loves—so many magical things to cherish, so many magical things to lose, if magic disappeared.
Draco pours the rest of the carton of milk down the sink, and then goes out to the shops for more. This is the highlight of his day.
“Wales,” she says. “Ynys Llanddwyn.” She holds her hand out toward him, the portray resting in her palm. “Ten seconds.”
Harry liked the way the moonlight filtered through his bedroom curtains and lay gently across the blankets. He liked it even more with Draco beside him.
Malfoy's hands in his hair, his fingers twisting the strands until it hurts. Malfoy's face so close to Harry's, their teeth sharp and careless. Harry's tongue tasting the slippery heat of Malfoy's mouth and then the hint of salt on his skin, down his neck, across his chest. Biting lightly at a nipple. Harry thinks about fairytales and books of monsters.
Something is crawling up Draco’s spine, something with claws and teeth and it wants to come out through his mouth. There’s a burning pressure behind his eyes and Potter doesn’t
“You ready?” Charlie calls, running from the barn behind the dragon. “I’m going to take the last of his bandages off now!”
Harry pulls the finished knot upwards, tighter until it nestles at the base of his throat like a reminder. He can feel his breath, in and then out, against its pressure. He watches backward in the mirror, straightening the already perfect knot of the necktie. Malfoy split three ways, three slightly different angles in each fracture of glass. Each piece of him reined, leashed. He waits until all three Malfoys look up and stare back at him in the panes of glass.
“It makes sense, that’s all. There’s always been something between the two of you. I haven’t always known what it is, and I doubt you two have, either. But it’s always been there.” She reaches out and takes his hand in both of hers. “Are you happy, Harry?”
“I don’t know what you mean, Potter. Why would I do Auror work?” It’s so easy to slip into his accustomed sarcasm.
Potter told him to use the Floo, so he stands in front of the one in Malfoy Manor, watching the little clock on the mantle tick slowly closer to five. He pulls at the ends of his shirtsleeves, pressing a finger along the cuffs where they lie against his wrist. He’s still not sure what he’s doing— why Potter has invited him back— but there’s a part of him, a part he tries now to stuff down, out of sight, that is glad. Excited, even. It feels dangerous, this hope that he won’t name even to himself. Finally, he smoothes his hand down the back of his hair and then grabs some Floo powder.
Draco seriously doubts that Potter is nobody, no matter where he is. “No, that’s— no. I need to see Professor Snape’s portrait. I can’t just wander into Hogwarts, can I? I thought—.” He stops, and focuses on pulling in a deep breath, then letting it go again. “McGonagall would let you. She’d let you have almost anything you asked.”
“It’s been a really difficult couple of months,” Hermione said delicately. “Do you think it’s possible—”
“This is a Muggle neighborhood!” Harry said, speaking over him. “Why the hell are you wandering around here? What are you up to?”
“My question,” continues Potter, and now he starts to examine the fingernails of his wand hand, as if there’s some dirt stuck under there, “is if you’re nearly done having your fit, or if we all have to keep standing around here. I’d hate to be late for dinner again.”
Snape sat back again. “I’m sorry I can’t be of more help, Draco. But I think you will find your way by making the path yourself. It isn’t disloyal to leave your father’s shadow.”
Draco grits his teeth, grinding the back molars together slightly, then consciously forces his jaw to relax again. “I didn’t say I was giving up.”
Usually, Malfoy would pull back toward the end, finish things off with hands or mouths. But he stayed, flush up against Harry, his mouth on his, chests heaving against each other. Harry wrapped an arm around Malfoy’s back. His shoulders moved under his skin, the miraculous machinery of their bodies. When Malfoy lost himself in pleasure, all the careful calibration of the face he showed the world dissolved, and Harry remembered the young man weeping in a bathroom, and terrified, clutching onto to him as their broomstick darted through a wall of fire. He remembered the little snot filled up with the teachings of his father. And all these facets of the same man just made Harry feel full, right in the middle of his chest.
Harry wrapped the thumb and index finger from his right hand around him, and took the head of his cock into his mouth. He ran his tongue around, in a circle, then flicked it over the slit there, salty and sensitive, because Malfoy jerked above him.
Potter presses the small, brass key into his palm one Saturday morning as Draco is leaving his flat. Draco always makes sure to leave early when he stays over on a Friday night. Weekends together mean something else. They mean something other than fucking.
"We are here today to discuss the efficacy of the Auror Division's Covert Special Forces teams, originally stood up right after the War with the intent to catch and detain remaining Death Eaters still at large. Today's teams, smaller in number and more specialized, continue that mission, and have an expanded objective to respond with all due speed to new Dark threats, foreign and domestic."
,” she gestures at the paper lying on the table between them, the black and white picture flashing as his image pulls Draco’s face down to his, over and over, “we can say ‘cock’ between us like adults.”
He stares down at the light pink brew. “It’s a passing effect,” she says gently. “And then it’s only herbs for immune support.”
“Not yet,” Harry says, tracing along Draco’s thumb and then down into his palm, a slow, promising drag of skin on skin, before he tangles their fingers together. “But they’ll get there, I think.”
They were in the last stretch. The finish line was in sight, and they still lingered. Harry licked the dip of Malfoy’s clavicle, and the chest against him stopped moving. Malfoy stopped breathing, for just a few seconds, and then made a sound Harry didn’t even have a name for, his cock jerking in Harry’s fist and his come going all over Harry’s fingers and the skin where his shirt was rucked up.
“Too much, clearly,” she says, and then she’s looking at something over his shoulder. “I think it’s best if Draco goes home for the evening. Could you make sure he gets there, Mr. Potter?” Her voice is very quiet, and the hallway is empty, but Draco startles.
This is the closest thing he’s ever seen to magic made visible, the way the bees ride the flow of that mysterious force within him. Like schools of fish deep in the ocean, making hidden currents visible to the eye. His bees rode the waves and eddies of his magic, soaked it in, delighted in it. There could be nothing bad about it, nothing truly wrong with Harry himself, if these delicate, astonishing creatures loved it so much.
Pansy softens, too. “Cassius,” she confirms. “My parents arranged it.” She picks at her creme brûlée with a spoon. “It’s funny how we still do that, isn’t it?”
Harry gestures toward the baskets loaded onto riderless horses. “We’ve been luckier than most during this famine. We have a lot of coastline, and we brought dried fish. A portion of grain we can spare will come later should we come to terms. This is a gift, regardless of your decision.”
“You ridiculous imbecile. She doesn’t think we’re working together, she thinks we’re sleeping together.” At Potter’s blank look, he rolls his eyes. “Partner as in ‘boyfriend,’ not partner as in ‘Auror.’ And no, she has no idea who you really are.”
“Potter will disguise himself as someone else, and stay with a partner until we get this thing settled.”
“Harry, stop,” Draco says. He gets his coat off and hangs it up on one of the weird metal hooks by the door. “I’m sorry, too. It’s like I can hear myself being a dick about everything sometimes, but I can’t stop.”
Draco fiddles with the discman, closing the lid and popping it open again. “She asked after you, just before I came. She misses you.”
“Don’t be mean,” Granger says, coming up next to him. “I don’t think he’s ever done anything with a ball other than play Quidditch.”
They never eat in the dining room anymore. There are many rooms they do not enter. Since Lucius’s death, his mother has been going almost non-stop, from one commitment to another. Draco wonders what would happen if she paused.
Draco goes harder. Faster. There is nothing else but his body sliding over and inside Potter’s body, nothing but the breaths they take and the sounds filling the room. There is nothing but him, and Potter. Nothing but them and this moment, right now.
“Of course you do,” Malfoy sneered. “Potter the Savior, Potter the Hero. Never wrong about anything, about anyone, are you?”
She still seems tightly strung— nervy and difficult. It’s hard for Draco to picture Potter living here, or even being related to Petunia.
“Then you have more than one ghost.” Potter puts his glass beside Draco’s in the sink, leaning over and looking out the window.
It’s harder to read Potter’s face while he’s wearing someone else’s, but Draco thinks he might be surprised. “We wouldn’t be here,” he says to Draco. “Working together like this, I mean, trusting each other— if I couldn’t get past things we all did as children, and give people a chance now.”
“Nah,” says Harry. He hooks his thumb into the pocket of Draco’s trousers and looks out at the cream and blush-colored roses climbing the hedges. “We started doing that a long time ago. We’re just late bloomers.”
Two days after that meeting outside the tube, in the dark and the rain, Potter had owled him, and Draco had found himself following him to Hogwarts from Hogsmeade the next afternoon. They'd gone up the twisting staircase to the Headmistresses office, and McGonagall had looked at him so strangely— almost as if he was something fragile and still under her watch. He’d expected suspicion and blame, but all he’d received was the offer of some biscuits from the tin on her desk, and then she and Potter had left to go see something he hadn’t been paying enough attention to remember. And then he’d been alone with Severus Snape’s portrait.
“Oh, busy. I had a steering committee meeting for the new wing at St. Mungo’s, and Mrs. Greengrass’s luncheon. Apparently Daphne is traveling to America next month. Can you imagine?” Narcissa shakes her head slightly, her smooth, silky hair spilling slightly over one shoulder.
Harry swallows. Narcissa Malfoy makes him feel eleven again, somehow. “I did, Ma’am. I turned in my notice before I asked Draco out to dinner that night, actually. I’ve been wanting to retire for awhile now, and the time finally felt right.”
“How to use a blade, I mean. Not the pretty stuff. The stuff that actually protects you.” Harry offers a small smile. “It’s better than just watching, anyway.”
"Is there a time limit on justice, sir? Can we justify giving up, allowing the remaining fugitives their unearned peace from the law, because our search requires patience and time? What does that tell their victims about how much we care for their pain, and their loss?"
“Is this Potter pining for the ancestral den? Tell me, do you actually go underground when you visit the Weasels?”
In the morning, Draco waits in the Ministry Atrium, hovering as unobtrusively as possible near the Floos. He’s become good, over the years, at blending in, at fading into a crowd. There are a few second glances and stares, but most people are too busy heading up to their offices, chatting to colleagues on the way, seemingly buoyed by the fact that it's Friday, and thus almost the weekend.
“Just picture it, Blaise.” He smiles into his disbelieving face. “Imagine it all cleared out. A little herb garden, some more flowers. The hives back behind the trees. Imagine sitting out here this summer, drinking your stupidly expensive fire whiskey, with the bees humming at you.”
“To talk about the tea cosy trade,” Potter says, his face very serious even as it starts to swirl out of sight. Draco is beginning to suspect that Potter has a tremendously good poker face, which is a somewhat unexpected turn.
“You burn a lot of bridges thinking you’re better than everyone around you.” It’s odd for Draco to say any of this out loud. He wonders if it’s something specific to Harry, or just uncanny timing. Draco is tired. Yesterday was spent visiting some of his farmers, trying to reassure them about the coming winter. The harvest was terrible; the growing season was too damp and too cool, again. One bad year is just a bad year. Two bad years and people start to look for someone to blame.
“It’s disgusting, you know,” Granger tells them. “The flirting you do over corpses. I’m going back to the Ministry to tell Kingsley we got Rookwood, before you actually start snogging.” She starts walking over to the Apparition point, then turns back. “Snogging at a crime scene is not allowed, by the way.”
A third finger slips in to join the others, and Draco curls and twists them, strokes in and out while Potter gasps out his non-words. Sweat is gathering on Draco’s forehead and his lungs are burning, his chest rising and falling unevenly.
“Sometimes, Potter,” Malfoy said with a little twist of his lips, “you manage to almost convince me you’re rather perceptive.”
He can’t read Potter in this moment. He can’t tell what he’s thinking. He’s just looking at Draco. He’s just watching him fall apart.
When Potter’s alarm goes off, there will be a quick, shared shower, and then PG Tips in a mug pulled out from the back of the cabinet because Potter hasn’t done dishes since the previous weekend. Potter will be looking for a match to his last clean sock right up until they have to leave or be late to the Ministry. He could leave whenever he wants, of course, but Potter will just hurry through his chaos a little more quickly and run out with him, his red robes tucked under one arm while he pulls on a boot with the other hand.
The doors to his father’s study swing open from the middle, like a gate. These days, they are always closed. Draco takes a moment to look at the gold-etched handles, each ringed with an elaborate wreath of roses and thorns. He can remember looking at those handles when he was eye level with them, can still almost hear his father’s voice bidding him come in, warmth underneath the careful modulation of his voice. He steels himself now, and knocks.
“It’s been over a week, Draco.” Potter looks tired. He looks rumpled with his Auror robes off, smaller and more worn— more human. More Harry. “No word. Not even an Owl. And you expect to just walk in and pick up right where we left off? I’m not sure I can do that anymore, Draco. I’m not sure I can ignore how lopsided this is between us, when it’s been two years.”
Ginny shrugs and waves a hand in front of her face. “I thought I’d be dodging howlers for not being good enough for Harry Potter, but what are they going to accuse me of? Not having a cock?”
Draco’s eyes darted away and then back again. “In person,” he agreed, and looked down at his feet. A bit of pink crept across his cheeks.
“A drink would be nice,” he says, before he can convince himself it’s a bad idea. Potter hands him a heavy-bottomed tumbler and a bottle of Ogdens. He pours a few fingers, and then follows Potter out the door he hadn’t really noticed in the kitchen’s far corner.
, Potter?”  A teacup sitting on the back shelving cracked, suddenly. “You don’t know me, not anymore. And not like you think you do.”
Narcissa’s smile grows wider, warmer. More real. “He is, truly. And he speaks highly of Albus and Lily. It is a new generation, is it not, Mr. Potter?”
He also stops keeping a precise track of time after that first week. It hasn’t been a month, but that’s all he can say for certain, and it’s in this wave of lethargy and unreality that he cracks his eyes open and realizes Ron Weasley is standing over him one afternoon. He knows it’s afternoon because the git has ripped open the curtains covering his windows, and the sun is slanting its way down the sky and shining directly in his face.
“Am I supposed to tell you what I taste?” His voice comes out rough, like it scraped along his throat.
Back outside, he takes a deep breath of cool, coastal air, trying to clear the sharp tang of blood from his nose. Granger goes off to find the owner, and he makes a circuit of the sanctuary’s perimeter, looking for signs of any kind of forced entry. He finds nothing.
Draco listens to his breaths, heavy and even, and matches his own to Potter’s rhythm until he drifts off again.
Hermione looked a tad annoyed with him, but she went on without commenting. “A rise in the number of people infected over the weekend. St Mungo’s is getting alarmed—they haven’t many empty beds left.”
Granger and Weasley wave him away, and he takes a path through some small, twisted trees and sea grass until he gets to the top of a small ridge, and a stone cottage just below. A young girl, seven or eight years old, is skipping rope in the front yard. She watches him climb down the soft sand, and stops jumping when he gets to the gate.
Luna sways around the furniture with her eyes closed, her arms at odd angles, and she hums along to the music with a voice like a pair of wind-chimes, and Harry follows behind her.
“It’s a general wellbeing blend, with a slight Know-Thyself charm. Things you need to work out, things that maybe you haven’t dealt with and need to, these leave a taste behind. The tea clarifies them.”
“It’s not a hovel,” Harry says automatically. “It’s just a very rustic cabin. We’re, you know— roughing it. Apparently.”
Tom Evers is locking up the door at the base of the lighthouse when Draco arrives. His thick, dark hair is curling against the collar of his shirt, like he’s gone too long without a haircut.
And he did. He followed the jolting wake of Draco’s almost-there touch all over his own body, and he whispered things into the gap between them. Secret things. Wild things. All the things he wanted to do to Draco, everything he’d imagined. Draco’s pale face turned darker, flushed all over, as Harry went down his list of all the places on Draco’s body that he wanted to touch.
The other Aurors are drifting back toward them now, but Potter is still smiling at him over the corpse he just made, and he can see how the rest of this day will go like it’s a movie being projected on the back wall of the inside of his head. The debriefing, the witness statements, the wand checks, Minister Shacklebolt’s statement to the press out in the bullpen. Potter watching him all the while.
“But—“ Draco’s mind stutters. He feels frozen, his boot still untied, staring down at the tiny bomb in his hand. The silence drags on, heavier with every second.
“I’m sure we’ll think of something.” He wishes Potter looked like Potter, suddenly. He doesn’t want to stare at Sayre anymore; he wants to watch and touch and taste Harry Potter.
Ginny looked up from the post she was sorting through, startled, then laughed. “Of course you have,” she said. And that had been that.
“That’s it,” Harry whispers. He lifts his chin to meet Draco’s lips again, sloppy and sweet. “That’s it, Draco. God, you’re so—” Draco groans into Harry’s mouth. His entire body is ringing like a bell. Their hands are wrapped together now around the both of them, and they’re thrusting with and against each other. “That’s so good, Draco, you’re—oh fuck—”
“Anyway, they brought out the pot of tea I’d ordered and it had a cosy over it. And I thought—oh, Muggles don’t have Stay-Hot charms. They can’t rely on magic to do it for them, so they make something to help, to keep it warm. They just
The ghost in his garden is just a kid who died here a long time ago. Draco wonders if he’d been happy, while he was alive. If he thought about that life at all anymore; if he had regrets. The ghost quickly loses interest in him, though, and bobs away toward the little gate at the back of the garden. Draco stays, and watches as he inspects every barren plant, lost in whatever world he left behind.
“Hippogriffs. Cassius has a whole stable of them. It’s really caught on over in France, you know. I was skeptical at first, but it really is such fun— I try and go out every day. I’m organizing a trip down the beach in a few hours, actually. You should join us.”
Blaise hums, and Draco can see he’s lost already in his head, in stories he can never know about people he’s never met. On his best days, Draco thinks it’s all Blaise can handle right now— to be involved obliquely, in the small moments of people who are, for all intents and purposes, fictive. On bad days, he thinks it might be as far as Blaise is able to care about anyone, or anything, anymore.
Potter turns on the wireless in the evening, and Draco listens from the armchair, his stomach full and his eyelids heavy. They’re playing an old recording of a Muggle reminiscing about his childhood Christmases in Wales. He’s got a wonderful, scratchy kind of voice, filled with its own particular cadence.
Draco sits up. Potter stirs and then settles, his head half on Draco’s pillow. Draco extricates himself the rest of the way carefully. He slowly pulls the drawer of the guest dresser open so that it won’t squeal on its hinges and rummages around inside until he pulls out a bathing suit, then he creeps quietly from the room, shutting the door silently behind him.
Harry laughs, remembering their faces. The shock, the awe, the bright enthusiasm. “I miss them,” he says. “I miss them little.”
He sat, and stared at Malfoy, who had returned to his own table with a small saucer of milk. Malfoy drank slowly, in small sips, and fidgeted with his napkin. Finally, he looked up with a glare.
Granger is happy to hear about the Warrington house party invitation. “Scotland,” she says. “You know, that’s where our informant said McLaggen was when he was supposed to be here in London for the rally. What’s Warrington like?”
Pansy glances over her shoulder from where she’s sorting through the stacks of vinyl behind him.  “Ha!”
“I’m sorry we have to ask you, Draco.” Granger does looks apologetic, but he knows it doesn’t change anything. They’re both too pragmatic for that.
The room is very quiet, and Draco closes his eyes for a brief moment as the shoe drops. “Me,” he says. He opens his eyes, and sees Weasley’s head swivel his direction. “You know me.”
He passes through the center of the room on his way to his desk, which is in the back, in the Investigations section. He’s quite good at investigative work, it turns out. He’d mostly envisioned a lot of wand fights when he’d applied to the Auror force, but he liked the puzzle of the cases that weren’t upfront, weren’t obvious.
“There’s some Hack-It-Off in the department cabinet,” he said. His voice sounded gruffer than he meant it to. “And Pepper-Up.”
He clutched at Malfoy. He held on to one of his shoulders, and let his other hand slide down Malfoy’s front, chest and then his belly, down to where his shirt had ridden slightly up between them. He let his fingers slide under his waistband, and then he stopped. He pressed his palm against Malfoy’s bare skin there, where it was soft and heated, and moved with his every breath.
“Mr. Potter.” Narcissa gives him a small smile, and holds out her hand. He bends slightly at the knees and brushes his lips over the back, where her skin is soft and thinning, papery with new decades passed. She’s still stunning; silver and blonde and graceful curving cheekbones.
“Yeah. I was thinking the other night about how they’d all come running out after their baths when they were tiny, naked and wet and shrieking.”
Harry doesn’t look up from the blade he’s sharpening, his shoulders tense and his hands very careful. The raw scraping fills the room.
Potter had come back from his ride spattered in muddy grit and windblown, but grinning. “I didn’t expect to enjoy myself here, you know? But that was great,” he’d said, peeling off his sea-soaked sweater and tossing it in the basket just inside the bathroom door. He’d dressed quickly for dinner, which was a small, quiet affair since most of the guests were arriving the next morning.
Pansy’s face tightens, but she gives a little laugh, like it’s a grand joke. “Cassius finds honesty refreshing, you know. Qualities in such short supply often are.”
Harry’s eyes are a deep, verdant green. The pads of his fingers are rough and his bottom lip is slightly chapped.
The name is his name, and the bed is ready for Draco Malfoy on the day he isn’t quick enough. The day a bad man or woman beats him. And Draco is waiting for that day like the bed waits for him. There are waiting beds for every Hit Wizard, and they’re all watching for that particular bad man who will put them in the empty bed, or worse.
Harry wants to tell Malfoy that he isn't afraid—not because there is anything wrong with fear, but because he would like Malfoy to understand. Harry would like to explain that it's the absence of fear that makes his limbs quake sometimes. That there is an empty space inside him, because Harry has known the forest and when he left it something stayed behind, and now there is a hole Harry suspects he might fall through, and gladly, if he isn't very careful.
hovers on his tongue, but he holds it back. It doesn’t feel right somehow. “Well. There’s not much by way of groceries, I’m afraid, but help yourself to whatever’s around.”
He feels Harry’s hand on his elbow just as Granger disappears into the kitchen, and he turns to find him smiling, that secret, quiet little smile that only Draco receives.
He couldn’t tell Malfoy any of that, and it made him angrier. “I know enough,” he shot back, and the wall of crockery shivered and shook behind them.
Draco is about to say something else— to thank Potter for what he’d done, however poorly— but Harry is smiling at him again, and it’s so soft and perfect that Draco holds in any inadequate words, lest he spoil it.
“Oh,” says Harry. “Well, that’s alright then.” And Draco laughs just a little, and Harry leans up to kiss him.
“I am referring to a human one,” said Blaise’s mother. “Every elf in our Hall is free, and may come or go as they please. It shall always be so.”
The guy from Accounting who came by sometimes to nervously tell Harry the Aurors were over budget on office supplies or requests for meal reimbursements, and how his wire-rimmed glasses might fog up and fall off when he sucked someone off.
“Go for the knees, too,” Harry says quietly, and then he steps back. He returns Draco’s hands and body back to him.
It’s funny, the way time slows down in a duel. How your heartbeat gets so loud in your ears, and the breath coming in and out of your lungs feels more deliberate. More finite.
Harry is smiling at him. Draco can’t get enough of his smiles; he hoards them, a now ever-growing collection of the way Harry Potter’s face looks wearing happiness, and the way that happiness pointed back toward Draco is the best thing he’s ever seen.
It takes a long moment for Potter to turn around and look at him. There’s a sinking feeling inside his chest, at the thought of Potter
Granger listens to him repeat the encounter on a Floo Call that evening. “That really only points to a personal grudge for Iwan Rhees,” she points out. “I can’t see any larger significance to link the Sanctuary’s troubles with the bigger picture— the bombing and everything. I’ll see if we can spare someone to bolster their security and keep an eye on this Tom Evers. We really don’t need anymore headlines about attacks on magical traditions.”
bad. Harry had been paying closer attention to Malfoy over the past year. They almost never worked together out in the field, since younger Aurors tended to be paired up with more senior ones, but he watched how Malfoy interacted with other people, and how they treated him back. He’d been surprised by how… well,
This is the thing: he and Draco never needed to schedule time to be romantic before. When they’d first gotten together, they hadn’t even called it romance. It was a one-off, and then something they did in secret because anything else was too complicated. When they started dating officially, and then moved in together, even the everyday stuff felt new and weirdly exciting, because they were doing it together.
This was not something Potter could quite comprehend, apparently. There had been a stuttered apology, which was insulting, and then lots of subtle, searching looks when they crossed paths at the Ministry. It was both frustrating and ridiculously endearing at the same time.
It worries him, sometimes. How easy he finds it now to kill a target. Once, killing had been insurmountably difficult, and it had been the only thing keeping him just this side of a line he hadn’t even fully understood. Now there’s nothing keeping him from crossing a line except his own judgement.
Draco looks away. “She’s already been forced to leave her home. No one else cares what Pansy wants. I won’t force it.” He glances back at Harry. “I’m not exactly desperate for a wife, to be fair.”
“I very much doubt that, Potter. I feel sure your friends and family would disagree, too,” he says after a moment. He stares down at the toes of his own boots. “Anyway, you didn’t exactly do the whole death thing right, did you? Here you sit, very much alive.”
“You know,” Blaise says finally, “I think she was just like anyone else. Muggle, wizard. I don’t think it matters. She thought it was worth not being careful.” He doesn’t look at Draco, but he doesn’t need to. “She was right, of course. You can tell.”
“Sandwich, Draco?” he asks, trying to tug the bread out of Guido’s hands, the elf protesting that he can make lunch for the young gentlemen.
In the morning, Harry is sitting on the edge of the bed, fully dressed, when Draco opens his eyes. First light is just filtering in blue-gray shadows across the room. Harry looks back over his shoulder when Draco stirs, and smiles. His eyes are kind, so kind.
“It’s better for everyone, anyway. They want my protection. An organizing hand. They don’t want my friendship.”
Draco concentrates on the throb of his head. If he pretends they’re not here, eventually they might leave.
Draco is watching a man struggle to fold down a child’s pram, his flailing toddler under one arm, when a voice speaks behind him.
Harry keeps his hands on the floor as Draco moves to his chest, trailing his fingers down the hard ridge of muscle that contracts and eases under his touch. Harry’s belly is deceptively soft under Draco’s hands, and his shirt has ridden up to reveal the light dusting of dark hair trailing down into his pants. Draco marvels at how smooth Harry’s skin is here, how it moves with his every breath, and, further down, how Harry has turned so hard beneath him. Draco stops the movement of his hands. He’s breathing heavier now than when they’d been grappling, it seems. He feels disoriented—slow and shaky.
Draco huffs out a laugh. He nods. And then Harry is leaning into him, his hands coming up to cup both sides of Draco’s face. Harry’s lips move on his, and Draco can taste him. Harry, warm and steady, with a mouth that melts every one of Draco’s walls away. Harry’s kisses are extravagant—long, soft moments of shared breath and tongue and teeth pulling at Draco’s bottom lip. Draco has been starving. He has a castle and a crown and he has his books and his work, but he hasn’t had Harry like this in too long. He feasts.
Harry smiles at the chipped and faded window boxes, and the crooked green door in need of a fresh coat of paint. “Your roots are showing, Zabini.”
Harry and Draco kick off with their brooms, flying up beside him, and the dragon roars in delight, tossing his brilliant ruby head back and forth. Phoenix shoots forward, and Potter laughs, aiming his broom in the same direction. Out toward the sea spending itself on the shore, the sun shining on the water until it was a mirror for the sky, the two of them, impossibly, racing toward the clouds with a dragon.
Draco kneels on the floor in front of her. “Pansy, you’re the anonymous source that’s been sending information to Granger, aren’t you?”
Blaise is already up when Draco arrives this time; he’s standing in the middle of his kitchen, fixing himself a sandwich while Guido mutters and moves around, cleaning up after him.
She lets her hand fall into her lap and looks at him. “I was jealous of her, you see, and angry. Always had been, because she went somewhere I could never follow. It wasn’t until years later, long after she died, that I realised Lily didn’t want to laugh at me when she gave it to me. That she just wanted to laugh
Rowle’s body hits the pavement hard, almost silently. He’s gaunt, strangely weightless. Too many years on the run.
“Got a job loading shipments down on the docks. A little magical cargo— large pieces, animals, things like that— but mostly Muggle stuff. It’s good for him, really. Lots of muscle work and little opportunity or need to speak.”
Harry takes a deep breath. On one side is Luna, smiling brightly at the people sitting around the table with them, but Harry can see her knuckles pale and strained on her clenched hand beside his. Her foot tangles with his on the floor below. On his other side, Malfoy is a wall of stone and silence, his face as cold and impassive as it's ever been, but under the table, where no one else can see, his hand finds Harry's thigh just above the knee, and curls into him, warm and steady.
"More dangerous, too." Malfoy doesn't look up from his chess board as he says it. Two of his pawns have one of his queens in a neat trap at the far corner of the board. Theoretical battles, and all with himself.
“Tell me you’re getting the same creepy vibe from Warrington,” Potter murmurs as they leave the dining hall. Pansy had stayed behind to greet all the other guests with her fiancé, but they were expected to show up on the lawn for a pick-up game of Quidditch in the afternoon.
“Check!” Ron crowed, and Harry groaned as the pieces on his board were either violently vanquished or began a raucous celebration.
Hermione hums, emptying the spent tea bags from some mugs on the counter into the trash can. Draco has been drinking enough tea to wash himself out to the Thames since he came to stay with Dean. “The Goyles took in most of Warrington’s stable. She goes over and sees them almost every day. That reminds me, Charlie wanted me to tell you he’s got something you’ll want to see, when you can make it over to the sanctuary.”
Harry studied the ghost of Draco Malfoy for a moment. He looked much like Harry last remembered Malfoy—thinner and sharper than when he’d been at Hogwarts, with shadows curled up underneath his eyes. He was wearing a plain dark suit and his hair was slightly longer than Harry remembered, almost brushing the tops of his shoulders.
“I see,” says Narcissa. They look at each other, and he wonders how close he is to being hexed. He really doesn’t want to pull his wand out on Draco’s mother.
“Tell you a secret?” Hermione asks, and squeezes his fingers. He raises his eyebrows and knocks his shoulder against hers.
“I have questions,” Draco says. Potter looks like he’s waiting for more, but if that’s the case, he’ll be waiting a very long time.
"'With exactness grinds he all,'" Malfoy finishes. He looks calmer now. His eyes are focused on Harry. "You're willing to do this forever, aren't you? Part of you is already planning to."
They wake up late the next morning—too late. The first thing Harry becomes aware of is Luna's hair draped across his shoulder, and then the unfortunate positioning of her elbow against his ribcage. He winces and rolls toward her a little, then realizes that the only thing covering his naked body is a thin hotel sheet down around his waist, and also that Malfoy is just as naked, and still in bed with him. He squints at them—he's not sure where his glasses have got to.
“Carys,” says Weasley. “She’s known for her food, draughts and spells. The Kitchen Witch, they call her on the island.”
Rowle’s face is nearly purple now. As if all the ugly things inside him have been building and swelling with no release for so long that his very skin is about to burst from holding them in.
Draco has his tower. He has the view from his window and he has his books and maps and correspondence. He has daily briefings from Regulus and dinner with Pansy, whom he’s rather fond of, for all her sharp edges. Draco has responsibilities and he has luxuries most people only dream about. He has satisfaction and he has loneliness. He has many things, but he’s never allowed himself this.
Potter edges around him, and Draco turns to watch him lean over and peer out into the garden. He looks back at Draco, over his shoulder. “There’s nothing there, Malfoy.”
“This isn’t like you. This isn’t Draco Malfoy.” Weasley’s eyebrows are drawn together and he’s looking down at him with his stupid freckled face in a twist and his stupid red hair lit up by the light coming in through the window. This would enrage Draco at any other time, but now he can’t seem to dredge the feeling up.
The palm on Harry's right hand—his wand hand—tingles and burns. He could swear the temperature of the room has dropped. That there is a hint of pine in the air.
Malfoy puts in rows of lavender along the sides of the garden, and round bursts of bright perennials in beds down the middle, all running toward the hives in the very back. Asters and yellow fennel and lion’s tail, and bee balm and red salvia and flowering oregano. The roses he feeds a mixture of corrective nutrients, and grafts carefully-cut stems with creamy blooms onto their branches to make them stronger.
“Well,” Potter says, too casually. “Guess we better get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. Lots of… spy stuff.”
Potter turns the room dark without a word, and the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck raise just a bit; he forgets, sometimes, just how powerful Potter is. The bed dips as Potter slides in, and the quilt pulls a little over his chest. Draco thinks about the conversation they’d had this morning, and he feels a flood of warmth for the man stuck in bed beside him. Once, when he was eleven years old, he’d thought they might be friends. There hasn’t been a day since then that he’s thought it could happen, though, until this one.
,” Harry corrects him, and Draco’s face goes all warm and soft like it only does for Harry, when they’re alone together.
“It’s got me thinking,” Granger continues, “about how to share, between our cultures. I suppose it’s a matter of balance.”
“They like to show off,” Millie says, turning a page. “This gives them ample time to wear more of their outfits.”
He can still hear the tremor running through her voice, even five years later. He shouldn’t have said that. Not about Narcissa. But damn it, hadn’t he waited long enough? Hadn’t he spent enough lonely Christmases with people who didn’t want him? He just wanted to sit in the ragged, blue chintz chair in the Weasleys’ sitting room, with Ginny pressed up against his side, her red hair spilling down his arm while people came and went with a little too much rum punch and a few too many pastries.
It’s a shock, somehow. There’d been nothing left to interpretation in their previous activity, but feeling Potter’s cock straining against his own is something else altogether, and Potter’s face is so close to his, his mouth is so—
Draco smiles. “Just dealing with old stuff. I’ve been spending time with a lot of people who knew the old me. And people who have known both, but— but I haven’t made things quite right with. I guess I feel like I owe apologies, but it’s too hard to begin. It’s too hard to give them. And I feel uneasy around them.”
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of this,” Potter says, his arms folded across his chest as he surveys the situation. “I knew she thought we were— well, you know. But it never crossed my mind.”
“How’s it looking?” asks Draco. He can’t take his eyes off the young dragon, his glittering scales in the sunlight, the lithe way his body moves even under the pain of a terrible injury.
“Flowers, Potter,” Malfoy had said while he poured them both some firewhiskey. “You would not believe the tedious, complicated conversations about flower arrangements I am being forced to sit through. My mother loves her flowers.”
“This is where you’ve brought me for a romantic getaway,” comes a voice behind him, and Harry cringes. “This—
Harry stood on one side of a line he was already leaning over; it was up to him, he knew, to cross it. “What do you want, Draco?”
When he rolls over to face him, Potter’s eyes are already open. There’s just enough daylight to make out their color, and he smiles at Draco.
He helps clean up, taking wet dishes from Weasley to dry with his wand and send away into neat stacks. Weasley keeps glancing at him as if he’s speculating about Draco’s motives, but he ignores it.
“Don’t you? There’s a peculiar smell in the storage room downstairs. Like rotting fruit. You should have a care— I’m told that stuff is very flammable.”
Potter pressed his lips together, hard, but his eyes went soft, and he put his hand out to rest lightly on Draco’s bent knee.
“I think the most important piece of it is that Muggleborns look to be the ones responsible,” says Granger.
Potter ’s breath is shallow, uneven. He swallows, then pulls his wand out from his back pocket. “Finite,” he says, and he’s Harry again. Finally.
“As you say. You never go for the obvious, though, I’ll give you that.” Blaise gets to his feet, pulling the knot around his waist tighter. “Just bid on it— people sell things because they want money for them. He might give you an exorbitant price, but you’ve got the galleons.”
Harry gives her a look, but she just smiles sunnily at him. Within a few minutes, she's gone and Harry is alone with a pissed-off Malfoy.
“Greg, you’ve got to lay off the Muggle junk food a bit,” Draco says, “or St. Mungo's is going to be forced to flush all those chemicals out of your system soon.”
Back home, at the Manor, Draco takes a hallway that’s been unused for more than two years. He turns a handle and the door they’ve kept closed swings open to the portrait room. He walks slowly down a long wall of Malfoy ancestors, and stops at the end, where Lucius takes up his spot. He seems to be dozing, head leant back onto the blue velvet cushion of the chair he was painted on. He looks… peaceful. Draco tries to remember if he’d ever seen his father’s face like that in life, all the lines of his forehead smoothed out, his mouth soft and so very, very human. Maybe when he was very young, when Lucius could be persuaded to let slip the mantle of being a Malfoy. Maybe when they were out on the lawn, just the two of them, and Lucius was teaching him how to fly the little beginner broom he’d given him for a birthday.
Dolohov sends a Killing Curse at him as soon as he enters the room. Harry deflects it with his strongest Shield Charm.
“Than any of the dragons. More than the sanctuary itself.” Granger sighs and puts down her quill, leaning back in her chair, which Draco is jealous to note is nicely padded. “Iwan Rhees, he’s a big war hero there. Bringing the Welsh Reds back is about more than just the dragons themselves, you know? It’s national pride, a celebration of Wales and of its future going forward.”
“Dawlish is coming by around five to collect that basket so he can get all the donated toys to the Childrens’ House,” he said.
Malfoy stopped jerking him off long enough to undo his own trousers and push down his underwear, and then there was a cock in Harry’s hand that wasn’t his own. Just unfamiliar enough to make every way he touched him new. He twisted his hand as he moved it up, lingered there over the swollen head until Malfoy bit his earlobe and groaned into it. The sound filled his head, turned his bones to jelly. He fell harder into Malfoy.
“Spitting nails. The roof’s started leaking again, right in the middle of the kitchen. She just had the contractor in a couple months ago to fix it, so she called him up and told him if he wasn’t there in less than an hour she was calling her solicitor. She don’t have a solicitor, of course— can’t afford one. But I reckon she’s hoping he don’t know that. Anyway, that’s why she didn’t come.”
He looks where she’s pointing, away from the beach. Dunes rolling up and into the distance with nothing else in sight. “What are we looking for? How far is it?”
Potter kisses Draco like he needs the oxygen from Draco’s lungs. Like he can’t get enough of it, and all the bits of Draco swirling around in his breath.
“In a real fight, your opponent won’t stop if his sword is gone. He’ll use his fists and his feet and anything else that can subdue and hurt you.”
Potter looks around again, his eyes darting from Draco to the Ministry workers passing by, and then to the watch on his wrist. “I have to go, Malfoy. Just— just come over tomorrow and we can talk about it, alright?” Potter sticks his hands into his pockets and rummages around. He pulls out a wrinkled scrap of parchment. “Ah, shit,” he says, wincing. “Not tomorrow. Sunday?” He’s still looking for something.
“Why tea cosies?” Draco turns his head to look at Potter, who is watching him in a way he can’t quite pin down. He’s leaning his chin on one of his hands, his elbows on the table. The whole dinner has been casual and easy, and
The Undersecretary, a small, graying man, drones on for another page and a half of opening remarks. Harry's mind wanders. He thinks with pleasure about his plan to spend the day tomorrow with Ron and George. He hides a smile over the fast work of Hermione's quill taking notes across the table, and watches Kingsley swirl the dregs of his tea around in his cup. Luna is wearing her radish earrings today, his favorites, and when he shifts his weight against the high-backed chair he can feel the ache from the faint bruising on his lower back from last night, and the memory makes his face warm and his breath turn slow, deeper—
, base to tip and back again. It had only taken a minute or so before Draco had come, painfully out of control, all over Potter’s fingers and fist and with Potter’s teeth in the flesh of his throat.
For a moment, he and Malfoy simply smiled at each other, then Harry sobered. “I thought you were a ghost,” he told Malfoy. “And you’d come because—because I didn’t get you out. I could’ve done more. I
Frankly, every tree here is a shameful abomination compared to the massive blue spruce that usually stands in the ballroom at Malfoy Manor, but Draco bites his tongue and follows Potter up and down the rows while he fingers all the branches, like some sort of pine needle perv. Finally, Potter stops in front of one of the shorter ones.
“I don’t think it’s about helping them,” Draco says. “I think it’s about hurting Iwan. They say fear makes us do things we’d never do normally, but I think pain twists us even more.”
“It is a conundrum,” Malfoy agreed. “But on the whole, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, it is nicer here than in Azkaban. So I think I’ll stay awhile.”
Draco just looks at her. This enormously talented Muggleborn witch, with her wild, untamed hair and her kind, kind heart. It’s odd, but grace is such a heavy thing, so unexpectedly hard to hold. He wants to tell her so, but he can’t find the words.
“Well.” Granger clears her throat, looking slightly apprehensive. “You’re not going to like this, Harry, but—“
Potter’s breath is on the back of his neck, and Draco closes his eyes. He bites his lip, hard, holds it between his teeth so no sound can escape him. Potter is moving against him now, a steady press and retreat, a rhythm that sets Draco on fire with no way to put the flames out. It’s excruciating and it’s divine and Draco
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Subjects were able to relate everything that happened away from their confined bodies.”
“And I was having tea one day, at this little spot just off the Piccadilly line— I like riding the Tube, so I often try different lines and get off at random stops to look around.” Draco thinks about all the times he closed his eyes and let his finger fall on a random dot sprinkled across the Underground map. How frightening it was, at first, just to walk into one of the cars and find a place to sit or stand, and then to emerge from the stop, up into the bustle and light and everything he wasn’t familiar with.
He smiled at the scathing look that earned him and bent down to finish writing his portion of their statement. They’d only been partnered for a few months, but Harry thought it was going pretty well. Surprisingly well, actually. They’d just wrapped up a long investigation and busted up an illegal hippogriff fighting ring. It had been an ugly fight in freezing rain and muck, but they’d caught every suspect involved. Not exactly how Harry had envisioned spending a happy Christmas Day, but he found now that he didn’t mind at all.
“Am I supposed to think you care, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice was kind of thin and wheezy, and now that Harry could see his eyes he noticed they were glassy and bright. Malfoy really was ill.
“I hate to bring it up right now, while we’re being so well-mannered,” Potter says after a moment, “But I am wondering about the sofa situation. Or the, er, lack thereof. I don’t suppose you have a guest bedroom?”
Only, consider: he’d thought he was on the right side once before, and turned out to be very wrong. Maybe, when you’ve been wrong before, you can never feel entirely sure of anything.
“Made something better already.” Blaise holds up one of the small rectangles, but it looks a little different— just a tiny screen and a big circle button. “But you have to download music onto it from a computer, so it’s not very useful to wizards yet. Pansy came up with a charm to make these run on magic, so they’re perfect.”
“Sounds lonely,” Harry says. And then, when Draco says nothing—because there is nothing to say—Harry says, “I could teach you, you know.”
Care is a magic shaped by relation; it alters and winds its way through all spaces. It is always on the move, always changing its shape, and sometimes— it turned into love. Harry felt, finally, like all his various perspectives on Draco Malfoy over the years had clicked into place, simultaneous and one. He felt certain he could love this man through every view, from any side of before or after.
It’s funny, how that Prophet photographer had caught just this moment. Right before they apparated home, to Harry’s new cottage. When Harry had taken Draco’s jaw in his hands and pulled him down for a kiss.
“You should have told me we were moping at dinner this evening,” Pansy tells him over the last course. “I would have worn a better gown.”
,” Draco finishes. Harry turns, apologies already forming on his lips, but his boyfriend of a few years doesn’t let him get a word in.
When they’ve both got steaming cups in front of them, she says, “I haven’t seen anything down here. The sanctuary business never reaches us here, except when Iwan brings all the news back home at night.”
After they’ve made everything fit, and Draco has found the extra linens, he throws back the rest of his second full glass of Ogden’s and sets the glass in the sink. Potter eyes it briefly, then fills his own glass from the tap.
Potter bites his bottom lip and runs one of his hands through his hair, making it stick up even more than normal. “I can’t— I
Draco hopes the look he’s giving Potter conveys the depth of his skepticism. “Let’s go, Potter. Sayre. We don’t want to be late. My mother is not very forgiving of lateness.”
“You’re a great prince,” says Harry. He touches Draco’s cheek. Most of the urgency is gone between them, but the warmth remains. “And you’ll be a better king. Every kingdom should be so lucky.”
, suddenly, leaning against the wall in the low light from a street lamp further down the alley. All long lines and angles, all silver and moonshine. And his mouth, with a bottom lip surprisingly soft and tender looking for all the cold, cutting words he could spit out. His
The cloth slid gently off in his hands, a small cloud of dust turning, for a moment, the late afternoon air golden and gritty between himself and the mirror. And then there he was, reflected back to himself, older than the last time, worn and ripened.
Draco doesn’t laugh. He doesn’t even smile. He moves past Harry with his bag slung over his shoulder and he picks his way up the crooked steps to the door of the cabin. When he turns the knob and pulls the door open, one of the hinges pops off the frame, and the entire thing lists pathetically to the side. Draco just shoots him a suffering look and leaves it like that for Harry to figure out.
Blaise turns his glass around and around in front of him. “I don’t divulge things about my friends,” he says. “But I would encourage you not to assume anything. I find it’s always best to get answers straight from the source.”
so small, Potter,” he kept saying, in different iterations. “Look, your flat is five paces long. And… three and half paces wide. It’s astonishing.”
When the sun is lost behind the buildings to the west of him, Draco pulls a kitchen chair out the back door and sets it on the little concrete slab in his back garden. He sits down, and he waits. The air turns colder and bites at his bare hands and his face, but he stays. The street lamps down the alley flicker on, and he can hear the noise of people going in and out, rattling dishes and talking to their families or friends. It’s a distant but familiar swell of sound, like the ocean.
“Yes,” interrupts Granger. “It is. And I asked Malfoy here because I trust him, and because he’s good at his job.”
Malfoy was fumbling with the front of his pants now, and then his hand was inside them, pressing up against Harry’s cock, and he had to pull back to catch his breath. Malfoy wrapped his fingers around him, and squeezed. His lips were against Harry’s cheek now, wet and open, breathing hard against him. Harry gasped out something incomprehensible when Malfoy’s hand began to move, up and then slowly down again, tight and without compromise. There was no arguing with this pleasure. He could as soon argue with lightning, and be just as effective. He was on fire, and all it did was build. Higher. Hotter. Brighter behind his eyelids.
She takes a sip of her pumpkin juice. “So,” she says, and the glass makes a sharp knock against the wood of the table when she sets it down. “You’re a collector of Muggle
Potter— as Sayre— has frozen at the exchange, still holding his knife over the crumpet on his plate. Draco nudges him with his foot under the table, and he blinks, bringing the knife down to spread the melting butter that had slipped off.
Evers lets out a low chuckle. “No problem. Would have been nice for Iwan to ask our opinion before building it, though.”
Harry takes time to consider the words. He owes Snape time at the least, he figures, and besides: portrait Snape has never been wrong.
“I did hope so,” Harry says. “I want it to be, anyway. But what about you? Have you thought about it again, lately? That summer?”
“I’ll make your excuses at dinner,” Warrington is saying, and the sound of footsteps can be heard moving around in front of the cabinet. They both stop, still pressed together. Goyle says something Draco can’t quite make out, and something bumps lightly into the door behind his head. Potter’s fingers tighten on his waist.
Three red uniforms on one end, and Potter at the other. The man doesn’t even look at the others; it’s like Potter has some sort of lodestone inside him and every piece of crazy is drawn to it.
Back in the hotel suite, Luna receives them with her arms outstretched, palms open. They both drop a small handful of charmed beetle-shaped listening devices into her waiting grasp.
“It’s… complicated. I asked him for a favour two years ago, and told him I wouldn’t bother him again. Actually, I was hoping you might bid on it, and I could just pay you for it.”
There were a hundred moments before that one, each a seed and a nudge, a single wand flare in the night, indistinguishable until lined up into a pattern completed much later, and by chance. But Harry likes this way of marking the shift, and so: It begins with the tremble of air between them, disturbed into being by the heavy bass, so loud and insistent Harry can't distinguish it from his own heartbeat. With the way everything feels a little unreal, a little smudged at the edges. The press of strangers like an ocean around them, the bodies all moving together, rhythm and abandon, and something makes him wonder what Malfoy's skin would taste like, if Harry's mouth found its way to his neck, just below the hinge of that stone-steel-starlight jaw.
“Because when the fire began and all the protestors disappeared, I looked into the names the newspapers had taken, and all the identities dissolved after a little digging. They don’t
Draco doesn't answer the last part, because he isn’t quite sure himself. It would have been easier. Less mortifying. Stubbornness, maybe? Penance? Perhaps simply the pull of seeing Potter again himself, bad idea or not.
“None,” says Lucius. “But speaking of heirs, Salazar has chosen one from among his most trusted vassals, and I’m very pleased to say he’s chosen you.”
Spots of pink are blooming on his cheeks as he’s pressed harder into the glass. The man slides his hand from the back of Harry’s neck to the front, long pale fingers stroking, squeezing, forcing his head up as he pounds into him from behind. Deeper. Faster. And the rougher it gets, the more force is exerted upon him, the more relaxed the mirror Harry becomes. Lines seem to smooth out on his face. His lips curve, and the lines of his body change from his shoulders all the way to his feet. He
The look on Malfoy’s face— confused, cautious— amused him and broke his heart all at once. Maybe Harry needed to be the change, the perspective. “It’s Christmas, Malfoy,” he said, and nudged the chair in front of his desk out a little. “Come have some dinner.”
People who knew them before could be forgiven for thinking them an odd and volatile team. Harry, with his hero complex and his anger. Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and traitor, suspicious and tarnished. Luna, fanciful and batty with her head anywhere but earth. They would be wrong, though—as it happens they are wildly, improbably good together.
Harry sighed. “I’m going to go get it out of the break room.” He started to push himself up from his chair with his good arm, but Malfoy stood up first.
“You weren’t wrong, though,” he says carefully. “About any of it, except maybe some people’s intentions.”
Harry knows Malfoy is right; Dolohov has very little to lose, after all. There's no telling what he'll do. They will have to wait, try to catch him when he leaves, even though that is precisely the point when they are most likely to lose him.
“And we need him paired up with someone who has access to members of and backing the Traditional Wizarding Order,” Kingsley says.
Draco watches Potter’s fingers tapping against the hard plastic of the seat they’re sitting side by side on. “Yeah,” he says. “I didn’t get what I went for, but I did get what I needed, if that makes sense.” He looks up to Harry’s face. “It helped.”
“I saw that spell somewhere,” he says. “I just recreated it.” His tea is gone, and the bees are still talking, calling out and wondering.
He waited, but Malfoy just kept sliding along the edge, just coasting and skating across the last boundary they’d left uncrossed. Harry lifted his hips, pressed back into Malfoy’s.
“It might not be a problem,” Draco offers finally. “Even if the elves do tell Warrington. He might just assume we’ve had a falling out.”
“A moment, Draco,” Lucius says after the meal, and he follows his father to his study. McNair, his father’s guard, follows and stands post outside the door as his father pours them both a cup of wine. Draco immediately feels uneasy.
Granger sniffs. “I think it’d be a sympathetic cause to most of wizarding Britain, if it weren’t for the violence breaking out.”
“My fiancé is very occasionally useful, I suppose,” comes Warrington’s smug voice again. “Pity it’s never intentional.”
Potter is sprawling out onto Draco’s side of the bed again, burrowed up against Draco’s ribs and snoring slightly against Draco’s shoulder. Potter’s snoring isn’t so bad, really. It’s never obnoxiously loud; more like the warm rumble of a small bear. Draco lets himself hover right between sleep and waking for awhile, drug under by the pleasantness of someone else’s heat and heft against his body.
Draco searches Warrington’s desk drawers, the bookcases, the paintings to make sure they aren’t covering a safe. He even taps on the wooden paneling to make sure there isn’t a hideaway. The only cabinet in the room turns out to be storage for Warrington’s old Quidditch trophies. He’s about to give up when Potter cracks open the door and hisses, “Someone’s coming.”
Malfoy steps off the old flagstones and bends down, running the tips of his fingers through the newly-turned soil. “Do you have a plan for these open areas?”
“Hermione already knew McLaggen had been here,” Potter says. He’s standing at the window, looking outside. Draco takes a step toward him.
Draco lets a smile break through his face. “I told Twinks not to tell her I was here until Greengrass is gone.”
“Yes.” She’s barefoot as usual, in cut-off jeans and her old quidditch jersey. “Better than good, I thought. It was wonderful. And I still love you, Ginny.”
The ghost spins and spins, a dizzy, lurching dance, and he shuts the window. He grabs a new bottle of Firewhisky, and cracks open the seal. Three fingers, four. He stops counting, just fills the glass up to its top and takes it back with him to the bedroom.
“Not like this,” Draco repeated. And he looked Harry in the eyes. He held them. “I have six more months on my sentence. I want to come to you as a free man, in the flesh, with all my faults and flaws and every true mark on my skin. Do you understand? I want to knock, and I want you to choose to let me in.” He sighed. “I want to feel all of it, for real, and not as an escape for either of us. Tell me you understand.”
“Pansy,” says Potter. He holds out one of his hands to her; she looks at it for a moment, and then up at him, at his face. Her hand is shaking when she holds it out to him, but he takes it calmly, wrapping his other hand into a nest around it. He leads her to the sofa and she sits.
." And Draco provides. Harry has known the forest, and now he knows Draco; Draco's hands on his body where Harry's blood rushes to meet him, Draco's mouth around his cock and Draco pressing into him hard, the slap of his skin against every flushed inch of Harry's. He looks at Draco and he touches Draco and he wants and wants and wants, and it feels so good to want him. This desire, ever-renewing, never quite fulfilled. Draco makes him miraculous over and over again.
What he says is: "Me too." And then he ignores the funny look Malfoy gives him and takes his hand, and he threads their fingers together. He pulls Malfoy in to their little knot of people who make life, for all its pain and rage and darkness, worth the effort.
Malfoy clears his throat. “It’s Mother, really. She knows everything about everything that grows out of dirt, it seems. But she doesn’t leave the Manor anymore, and she’s taught me quite a lot over the years.”
Draco looks back again. Harry is closer—he’s moved across the room and is only a few feet away. He nods at the window and the sound of metal against metal below.
The truth is, he’s tried jerking off to all the usual fantasies since he and Ginny decided to split up. He’s always thought he had a pretty full bank of them; old memories of things he and Ginny have done, old visuals of her spread out on their bed, all cream and fire and freckles making paths to trace all over her belly and thighs and breasts.
Potter’s arm comes up to rest beside Draco’s, his hand joining his braced against the wood. His chest leans into Draco’s back and Draco moves slowly, pressing his arse into Potter, rubbing circles into this dangerous heat building.
The street is nearly empty until he gets close to the shops near the park, where people are coming out from the coffee shop with their lattes and paper bags filled with pastries. He heads for the little grocer first, and looks over their tea selection. There’s a nice Assam blend, so he puts it in the little basket he picked up by the door, along with milk and a jar of honey.
Harry reaches out and presses his fingers into Draco’s cheek. The air Draco pulls into his lungs is cold, and he holds it, slow and deep, feels the ache under his ribs.
“I meant at the party.” Potter is doing that quiet-yell, where his volume doesn’t match the intensity of his words and expression. Draco wants to laugh, a little, but his lips won’t do what he wants them to.
He can feel Potter watching him as he pulls down the Ogden’s and pours himself a small amount. The first swallow burns going down and he welcomes it. He wishes he were alone. He wishes his furniture was still shrunk in the corner, the living room empty. He would like to lie on the bare floor for awhile, with the Floo cut off, and revel in the now-fleeting feeling that no one could find him unless he wished it.
Draco turns and runs out into the hall. The doors have disappeared, a built-in charm for times like this, and he passes other Aurors coming up the hall for their Portkeys as he goes down. “I can take someone with me,” he calls, and a dark-haired witch wearing the green robes of the MediCorp peels away and runs with him down to the emergency Portkey point. She gets a finger on it just as they step over the warded line, and they are immediately whisked away.
“It’s not quite the same, I know,” Granger says, looking ever so slightly self-conscious. “And Harry says it’s not as— er, well, that it doesn’t have quite the extensive range of colours all together.”
It takes her a moment— she looks as startled and dazed as he feels— but she nods, and he lets go of her arm. “Put up your flare,” he reminds her, and she quickly sends up a bright ball of green that hovers above her, a beacon for those who need medical help.
Draco sits. He watches Potter open the lid and pull off a triangular piece of the pizza, melted cheese trailing off it. He’s still confused, off-balance. Why is Potter serving him food at all? Why is he even here, in this house? He wonders what his mother would say, if she could see him having dinner with Harry Potter in what was once a Black family home.
“Quite.” They’re all quiet for awhile, and then Granger continues, “I want you to keep a low profile for the next few days, Harry. Don’t go out and risk being recognized. People are starting to ask where you are. They’re noticing your absence. The Ministry will not be commenting.”
charm, but hardly any household ones,” he notes, turning his head for another angle. “Weird,” he says, then looks at Draco again. “My hair, I mean. It looks weird.”
Draco raises his hips and pulls at them with one hand. Harry helps, and together they pull down the fabric separating them. When Harry’s hand wraps around Draco’s cock he can’t believe anything can feel this good.
Potter shoots him a distinctly unimpressed look, but his mouth is full of pizza, so Draco hurries on. “Why are you selling it through Zabini Imports?”
Draco can’t travel further down that road. “Regulus, nothing is forever. Everything is in flux. There’s no use dwelling on it.”
He was both surprised and not surprised to see Malfoy there, knocking back shots of a clear liquor at the bar. After all, Malfoy had always been a timely distraction, hadn’t he?
“The legacy seats.” Granger glances at him, and then back at Potter. “The twenty-eight spots we gave up in compromise when we pushed the reforms.”
Overgrown is a generous description for the back garden, it turns out. Harry can hardly hike through the waist-high weeds and brambles to get at the patio. When he does, though, he knows. This is the place.
Potter rubbed the back of his hand against his chin. The slight abrasions on Draco’s neck from that stubble flared at the sound, and with it, impossibly, his pulse.
He winces. “My apologies. I tend to let work overwhelm me. I don’t really socialize much these days.”
Hermione shows up thirty minutes after the owl he sends her and Ron, who is out helping George do inventories. They sit on the back steps and watch the sun sink down behind the fruit trees.
“I’ll tell Mother. She’ll come up with something you’ll like.” Malfoy points over to the hedge. “I’m going to take a clipping of those roses. I think, judging by the leaves, you have a nutrient deficiency. It’s an easy fix, and Mother can send you some cuttings from her own bushes to graft.”
“Hermione! Malfoy said you were here.” He steps forward and catches her in a half-hug, one of his big, tattooed arms going round her shoulders. “You keeping that little brother of mine in line?”
“Make sure our friend understands he’s not to come here again,” Warrington is saying to someone as he enters the room. Draco can hear the door snick shut behind them. “And then I’ve got another task for you. Millicent is occupied?”
He tries to find Warrington the next morning, but the man is like an eel, always slipping off somewhere. Potter is off riding with Pansy again; he saw them heading out to the stables a quarter of an hour ago. He sees Millicent out on the magically-warmed terrace, flipping through a magazine and drinking something that looks vaguely alcoholic, so he goes out to join her.
When they’d returned to their room, Potter had gone straight in for a shower. Draco listens to the sound of the water running behind the closed door. It occurs to him, in a particularly potent way, that Potter is naked behind those doors, a scant five feet away from him. Soaping up his various body parts.
Luna sits at the bar, her back straight and her hair falling in waves and tangles over bare skin, the low-cut back of her sequined dress shining under the low lights, inviting the eyes of the patrons all around them. Harry stays close to the main entry point and watches. Luna is wearing a different face tonight, but he can still tell when her gaze sharpens—there's a movement that always happens around her mouth, a tightening of the muscles. Harry scans the crowd. It's the kind of old, wizarding cocktail joint that pure-bloods of certain political persuasions used to frequent before the War, and everyone here is dressed to the nines.
It begins because of that look on Malfoy's face. Because it is mostly dark and because he has perhaps forgot that Harry might be looking at him. That anyone might be looking at him. His head is tipped back on his neck. He is looking up at the fairy lights and, beyond them, the stars improbably winking in the darkness, and he is looking out over a wave of people dancing in a ruin, in a city where four out of every ten witches or wizards had been killed or injured in the war and where the blood from it may never completely dry. And they are dancing now. They are dancing anyway.
There’s no room for any other fantasies, not inside this crowding, humming hunger. He wants Malfoy. He wants Malfoy all over, inside him, everywhere. He wants Malfoy to
“So—” Draco took a deep breath, settled himself. “So he could have had a heart condition he didn’t tell us about? Could it have killed him?”
They’ve begun snapping at each other now. Draco wonders whether they should institute a no-wands rule within the flat, out of caution.
He walks around London for awhile as the sun comes up. He had been pleasantly surprised by Muggle London, when he first ventured out into it. It was nice, to be a small speck in a large sea of people. Draco felt like he could breathe. Like he could dissolve and then pull himself back together later, better than he’d been before. He tries to do it often these days.
It’s a little odd, seeing Malfoy here at the Manor again. Harry hasn’t been here since the war. Malfoy meets him in the foyer.
Malfoy’s mouth at the spot where his shoulder and neck met made him arch up, and Malfoy groaned above him, his hips pushing into Harry’s, pushing them both into the mattress.
Harry asks about Pansy one night while Draco is writing a letter to his father. Draco looks closely at Harry’s face, but all he can see is curiosity.
“I didn’t mean to deceive you,” Harry says. “I didn’t want you to know who I was, yes, but only because I had no intention of
Draco scoffs. He traces the blue line on the parchment that marks the Abraxus River curling through their lands like a ribbon. If he could buy grain from the next city north of them, it could be brought downriver by barge. He calculates the coin at his disposal and wonders if it’s enough to persuade anyone to sell such a precious and dwindling resource.
“I think we’ll actually Apparate from here,” Potter says when they exit the last station. “It’s still a bit of a hike, and I don’t want to get a cab.”
Draco can only shrug and nod, and Potter looks around them again before shoving both the parchment and pen back at him. “Sorry, I really do have to go.”
“Ginny and I are taking a break,” said Harry. “She’s got her quidditch schedule, touring all over the world, and I’m always at work late because I’m on the bottom of the pile.”
“Yes, well— I had my doubts.” She turns to Potter. “Dudley! I’m so pleased you could make it, too. I set aside one of the best guest rooms for you two. Do you ride?”
It’s just him, looking into the glass, and himself looking back. Somewhere outside, a bird whistles and the wind whips up the scent of clover from down on the grounds. Just Harry. The faces of his children flash behind his mirrored image: laughing, happy, pink-cheeked and windblown.
Three nights' surveillance with no signs of life at the old manse in the Czech countryside and Malfoy is spoiling for a fight. He slams into their shared hotel room and rips off the black cap he always wears when they're working. His jacket joins it on the floor, and then his gloves, and Luna looks down at them, a dark puddle on the cream carpeting.
“Angry? Merlin, no. Are you joking? I was worried you would find someone younger, that I’d see pictures splashed all over the Prophet of some fresh-faced thing and everyone would be talking about how you traded up. And then you went and not only shacked up with someone exactly your age, but a man to boot.”
When he’s front-down on the bed, Draco kneeling behind him, he whispers back, “I want you. I want this.” One of Draco’s hands cups the back of his neck, and Harry closes his eyes. He starts with one finger, and his mouth pressing kisses across Harry’s shoulder blades. Harry wants more; Harry always wants more where Draco is concerned.
He’s surprised to find Pansy on the other side of his door when he answers the knock. She’s dressed rather plainly—a light blue gown, her hair plaited down her back. He motions her in and dismisses Marcus. She sits lightly on the edge of his bed and he takes the chair in front of his table.
Draco stands, and walks over to the wall of glass, looking out over Narcissa’s gardens. Harry can’t see his face, so he watches the line of his shoulders, the curl of his fists shoved into his pockets.
Draco wonders how he ever enjoyed this. How he ever enjoyed these people. He wonders what Potter thinks of him— if he could think worse of him by now anyway, even seeing him slithering around in his natural habitat. Draco is surprised by how much that thought bothers him. He grabs another flute of champagne and downs it, quickly and methodically.
He should be at the Weasleys’ right now, with everyone else. Not stuck here with Malfoy on the duty they’d pulled by lottery, because no others Aurors wanted it. Malfoy, who shouldn’t even
Blaise looks over at him. Hermione is setting silverware on the picnic table behind them and arguing with Ron about whether to open a bottle of white or red wine. “I always wondered,” starts Blaise. “If you and Draco—“
“Well,” Draco grabs a bit of Floo powder from the small pot on the mantle. “Do let me know, Potter, about the item.” The flames flare up, and Draco steps in. “Malfoy Manor.”
Lucius sits back in his own chair. “To what purpose?” Draco hesitates, and Lucius pounces. “To take your rightful place, or to betray our friends? Is this for—“ He curls his upper lip in disdain, drawing the next word out. “Work?”
Pansy is already in place out in the courtyard and he slips in beside her, Regulus to his right. She gives him a measured look and squeezes his hand. Surprised and grateful, he squeezes back, and then they straighten and wait for the prince and his men to enter.
As Draco’s guard, he’s supposed to watch, of course. Watch for threats. For assailants and assassins, for angry peasants and scheming noblemen. But his watching is different, somehow. Draco has always had guards like he’s always had a shadow, always gone everywhere with someone meant to protect him. He’s never felt watched like this, though. He’s never been so aware of his own body and its movements as seen by Harry, watching him.
“And you’d hit them with that spell you made up,” Ginny remembers. “The ‘warm towel’ spell. That’s the whole reason they did it, you know.”
Malfoy looked up briefly. “No,” he said, and went back to the futile effort of cleaning off his clothing.
“Well.” The door pops open with a little force, and Blaise turns back to look at him. “Perhaps not.” His smile, when he gives a full one, is bright and white and dazzling. “Force of habit, Potter. You know how it is.”
Draco clenched his fingers, pulling lightly at the stands of Harry’s hair between them, and the kisses grew sloppier, more frantic. Harry could feel the hard press of Draco’s cock so close to his own, right on top of the heavy burning in his body that wanted Draco, only Draco. Just when he knew he couldn’t stand to wait for the feel of Draco’s bare skin all up and down him, they heard the telltale click of the magical lock on the far end of the hallway to the Auror office.
“I don’t normally show up to formal events with a friend, P—Sayres. I show up with a date. Surely you can imagine why some people would have that impression? If it bothers you so much—“
“And?” Harry made himself ask. The flagstones in front of the fireplace were cold and hard under his knees, and for some reason he found himself reluctant to hear what she had to say. Like there was a spell over Grimmauld Place that she was about to break.
“More,” says Potter, his voice all rough and dark. The voice he uses when Draco’s cock is inside him. When Draco gets on his knees in front of him. When he wants it, when he wants
Two fingers, then three, and they are both trembling and breathing hard. Draco’s cock drags along Harry’s lower back as he moves. “Potter,” he says. “
Something circles the wrist of Harry's right arm and squeezes—Malfoy's long fingers. Harry realizes his hand is trembling, ever so slightly. Malfoy's face is turned down and he is looking at his hand holding Harry's wrist.
“You can’t think like that,” Hermione said. “It mattered—of course it did. This is not the end of the wizarding world—it’s just a problem we have to solve. Actually, all the people in St Mungo’s feel fine again after about a week.”
“Oh, hello, Malfoy,” Granger says. She tucks a section of her great, bushy hair behind her ear and continues, her voice fakey bright and overly courteous. “It’s so lovely to see you, too. I’m doing very well, thanks for asking.”
“If you… need another home… you could come with me. If you want?” He felt like a tit, but then, softly, a deep, harmonious humming had begun inside the boxes. The sound grew and swelled, like many hundreds of voices singing out a single note on different scales. It was something he’d never heard before, and yet it felt so familiar, a golden and peaceful feeling spreading inside his bones.
"I believe the family was Komensky. There weren't many left even when Dolohov was young, though. It's one of the reasons he was so easy to recruit."
?” Ron had asked him, late at night in the tiny kitchen of his temporary walk-up. It was one of those evenings between Christmas and New Year, that strange, elastic time in between reality. He’d always loved those days back in Godric’s Hollow, when the kids were small. This year, it felt colder and rather empty.
Harry gestured at the huge basket he’d begun unpacking. “I’ve got a huge spread. All the good stuff. Pull up a chair.”
Dean nods. “Just started this one.” He pauses to chew, and then says, “It’s been a good week for it. Finished up two others yesterday.”
“I haven’t been to the Manor since I signed up for the Auror program. I volunteered for the Christmas shift all these years because it was—“
“Yes,” Malfoy murmured. He was sucking a spot on Harry’s neck. It made Harry want to melt, to ooze out all over the kitchen floor. “Yes, Potter.”
Ginny owled him; it was a lovely, messily-written letter saying she missed him, making him laugh and ache. And the truth was he missed her, too. Sometimes, those last few weeks, he wondered if it was possible to love two people at once, or if that was just a cop-out. A weak nature. And then he’d look at Malfoy, all pointy edges and scathing indifference to anything that wasn’t sexual, and dismiss the idea altogether.
On the north side of the property he runs into a familiar face leaning against a post, smoking. Charlie Weasley waves him over.
Draco pulls the pillow away. “I am drinking my own weight in whiskey, Weasley. I am pickling my internal organs and drowning every thought in my head. I’m ceding my flat to a ghost. And I’d like to invite you once again to sod off. This is a solo performance.”
A one-man tent full of bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bath inside. An old boot that whisks you across a continent in seconds. Fizzing Whizbees. Dishes that wash themselves, portraits that move and speak and sing. Handbags holding libraries. Remembralls, Howlers, leaping chocolate frogs.
He tastes sugared lemons, at first, and a hundred feasts laid out on long, wooden tables. Sweat, ash, something sour. He tastes a creeping, crawling fear— how fragile skin truly is, how easily it gives way to spells and knives and knuckles. He tastes copper and water from an old faucet. Then he blinks, and all those things are gone. Only a slightly herbal taste remains on his tongue, and an impression of a fading sweetness.
“Auror Potter.” The voice, memorized down to its lowest chord, remembered precisely up to the highest, and all the notes in between. Harry’s voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione. “I know.” And Harry didn’t hear suspicion or disapproval in her voice at all—he just heard warmth. And love.
“We’re nearly fifty,” he continues. “Think about that. Half a century behind us. Who is Harry Potter, this next fifty years? The answer is: whoever you want to be. And you don’t want to be Head Auror anymore. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for that, Potter. You’ve all given too much, all three of you, to waste the next half century of your lives on what society wants you to be.”
Carys shakes her head, but says, “I don’t know. I never told either of them. Iwan or Tom. I had only just realized I was carrying her when Iwan came back.” She’s looking at Draco, and not at Draco— her eyes focused on something only she can see, something happening in a different time than they sit in now. “It was like someone coming back from the dead. I didn’t believe my eyes at first. And to my everlasting shame, as soon as I felt the joy I knew I would never tell him. I told myself Iwan couldn’t bear it, but I— I think it was me who couldn’t.”
He snorts, his hand coming up to press against his mouth, and then they’re both laughing. The sun is filtering in through the lace curtains over the kitchen window, lighting a trail over the dishes drying in the rack, and all the way across the wooden table. And right then, in the room where they’d fed their babies and sat down to dinner over nearly two decades, where they’d laughed late into the night over bottles of wine with Hermione and Ron, right there, he feels it: a curious lightening between his shoulder blades that spreads out and down into his chest. And he thinks, at last, that maybe everything really would be alright.
Millie stares at him for a long moment, then picks her fork up again. “You’ll tell me, if that changes.” It isn’t a request. “You owe him that, Draco.”
who I was anymore.” He glances at Regulus. “You gave me a chance when I was no one, and I would never betray that.”
It makes him think about Draco. About how Draco’s hands on Harry, so long ago, had pinned him down to the world when he was floating. When he needed it most.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “And I keep thinking about it. I keep thinking about how you couldn’t kill Dumbledore, and how scared your mum was that night in the forest. And I keep thinking about how it felt to be locked in the cupboard when I was a kid. To be so alone.”
Draco brushes at something nonexistent on his sleeve. “My mother is not an idiot, Potter. Of course she put the pieces together.”
Draco stares at Regulus. He’s tempted to laugh, but Regulus wouldn’t jest about something like this. “Well. I suppose we’re hosting a prince then. We’d best get ready.”
Draco runs a hand over his face, still watching the men in the yard. The hawk dives into the high grass just beyond the castle walls and comes back up with something small and struggling in its beak.
After a moment, he straightens his back, tilts his chin, and winds his way over to the Minster’s secretary. “Excuse me,” he begins, “I was told—“
“Not at all,” Draco says. “I’ve actually got a bit of a headache. Maybe I’ll lie down for a little awhile.”
Blaise shakes his head, but his lips twitch up anyway. “You’ve got it bad, Potter. I worry about you and those bees, I don’t mind telling you. And we
"A change in routine is a change in circumstances." Malfoy turns to face them again and takes a sip of his drink.
While he was wondering, Malfoy looked over at him. He raised his eyebrows and Harry flushed, caught. He cleared his throat and looked back down at the crumbled remains of his scone.
“I still feel like we’re missing something,” Draco says. Guests are leaving, the appearance of Aurors being a great deterrence to fun, apparently. He watches Madam Flint hurrying her son along, and he realizes what it is. “Granger, have you got this covered?”
Draco clears his throat. “I’m going to break into his study. He’s probably not stupid enough to leave anything lying around where I can find it, but it’s worth a shot.”
They’d been partners for more than two years now, and Harry had thought he knew how to deal with Malfoy’s moods. Underneath his adult shell, he could still be as mercurial as the boy from Hogwarts, but all his tells were so subtle now that no one noticed.
“The big news,” his father begins, “the news I wanted to tell you privately first, is that Salazar is desperate for an heir before this war with Gryffindor ignites.”
“Draco!” He turns to see Pansy striding across the hall to meet them. She’s wearing riding breeches and tall green wellies, and she looks strangely suited to her surroundings. “I can’t believe you actually came.”
“Ash in the mouth,” whispers Carys, staring down into her mug. “Babies you never get to hold. Roses dripping petals two day past their prime. Salt. So much salt. An ocean of it. That’s what I taste in the tea.” She looks up at him, and her eyes are dry but burning. His own sting in sympathy. “I thought he was dead. I thought Iwan was dead. I hadn’t heard from him in nearly a year, and everyone else was—“ She closes her mouth over the sound trying to escape with her words, and closes her eyes. “Everyone else was dead. The Death Eaters had gotten them all. His family in England, my family here. And I was all alone. Tom has always— always had a thing for me, you see. I knew. And I thought, what’s the harm? Iwan is dead and I’m so alone.”
Potter is waiting by the door when Draco comes out of the bathroom, only he’s used a bevy of cosmetic charms on his face, so he doesn’t look like Potter. The scar is gone, and his eyes are brown instead of their usual, vivid green. He’s done something to his nose, too: it’s wider across the bridge, and shorter. His chin is more pronounced. His hair is a light brown now, but—
“Of course,” Potter says, and he leans up to kiss her cheek, a little awkwardly. “Told you I would.”
And Hermione says, "Yes," and then she says, "Do you remember the smell when Ron burnt those beans, and how all the tea we made tasted of woodsmoke?"
to the point of panting excitement, too. He grabbed at Potter’s hips, then slid his hands back to his arse, holding and pulling him deeper, and Potter’s cock jumped and pulsed and spilled into Draco’s mouth, and it felt like winning. It felt like catching the snitch during a match, only they’d caught it together, playing for the same team. It felt like his chest was going to burst open, jagged and frantic like the beat of his heart, like the dark, wicked,
“Oh Harry,” she says, her eyes lighting up with barely contained mirth and shining in a way he hasn't seen in a long time when it was just the two of them. “Surely, considering
Blaise loves them, though. He points to one of them, where two young girls are looking over the edge of some sort of long cart on a track like the one at Gringott’s, except the track rises into steep inclines and curls in the air before returning back to the same spot. Their mouths are open, stretched into shrieking smiles, their hair flying away from their heads on a perpetually sunlit afternoon.
“Mmm.” Millie goes back to her reading, and he tries to nap, but something is niggling in the back of his brain now. He leaves with an excuse about finding a house elf, and wanders deeper into the house.
And still, sometimes it almost hurts to make eye contact with her, like looking directly at the sun.
Harry knew Draco so well by now, and yet somehow today was different. Today Malfoy seemed very far away.
Not quite alone. He’d almost forgotten his partner in depression. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy had drawn this duty because he was still the newest Auror on staff or because Robards didn’t like him. Just plain bad luck, maybe. When he finished coughing, Malfoy’s pale face was flushed a deep pink, and he grabbed his wand from the top of his desk, waving it at the water cooler on the other side of the room. A goblet filled itself and floated over to him. Harry watched him as he drank the entire thing, then wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand. Malfoy had kept his head down the past year; not particularly friendly but not overtly hostile, either. Mostly, everyone had relaxed around him.
“You’ve got some flour in your hair,” Harry says later, as they’re lying tucked up against each other. Draco braces his arm on the wall beside him so he doesn’t fall off the bed, and turns in Harry’s arms.
"Luna will be gone all night," he says in puffs of air against Harry's parted lips. "Patience, Potter.” And Harry gives himself up to be ground.
“Draco, I—” Harry exhales. He stands and bends down to kiss Draco’s mouth. He lingers for a moment. “You’re a good man, Draco. Don’t forget it.”
Harry smiled, and it stretched out his mouth and the warm space in his chest that was its own kind of magic. “Apparently,” he answered.
The air in the room carries a chill, but in the bed it’s incredibly warm and it’s hard to want to pull himself away. To care about avoiding embarrassment. He’s aware of Potter’s leg against his, and as Potter shifts a little in his sleep his knee curls up until their legs are tangled together. Potter’s shins are bare and Draco can feel the coarse tickle of Potter’s leg hair on his lower thigh.
Weasley sighs. “A much as I don’t want to, I feel inclined to help her if she asks for it. Call it a debt. Also Hermione is upset and up my arse about it, too.”
“Did I think it bothered you that the papers splashed around photos of you consorting with a known Death Eater?” His voice is flat and tight. “An apparently gay, male ex-Death Eater? I did intuit it might be a problem for you, Potter.”
“How? How is it still spreading?” Harry ran his hands through his hair, tugging on the ends with frustration. “We’ve been keeping apart from each other for weeks.”
“You’re not complaining? That’d be a first.” Granger nods her head toward a low, rectangular building on the edge of the complex, and he falls into step beside her. “We can’t figure out a motive. This sanctuary has been really popular with locals— it created jobs, and the goal is to have Welsh Red dragons back on their native ground. They’ve been endangered for years, and only bred in Romania. It’s a public relations boost for magical Wales. So we’re looking at anti-government groups, or possibly some kind of personal grudge against Rhees.”
Potter shook his head, once, nothing wasted. “No. Gods, no. Just, I think I might have made everything more painful, you know? With my timing.”
“Morning, Harry.” Hermione had her new reading glasses perched on the end of her nose. Ron liked to make fun of them, but she seemed to enjoy glaring at people over the tops of the frames.
But Malfoy had beat him to it and said, in a bored-sounding drawl and without ever looking up from his newspaper, "You are this team, Longbottom, same as any of us." And maybe it had started then, actually—when Harry looked at Malfoy and saw his partner, the man he trusted to have his back in a sticky situation, and then saw behind that man, too.
“Professor,” he’d said, drawing near. It hung on the wall right beside Dumbledore, who looked at him and then pretended to be engrossed in a book.
“I’m going to go by the Rhees place, Granger,” he interrupts. “Just to check with the wife, ask some questions. I’ll meet you back at the Apparition point when you’re ready.”
Malfoy will pretend to be utterly disgusted with the song choice, the dance moves, and the assault on dignity the two of them are apparently intent on waging, but Harry has learned where he keeps his secret smile, curled up in the corner of his mouth. Harry looks for it now, and he always finds it on the nights Luna decides that what they really need is dancing.
“I’m going to the Manor now. Best to get the inevitable over quickly. I’ll need my parents’ help to get a foot in again.”
The next morning, Harry went into the parlour and stared at the brown cocoa stain on his rug. Not quite a dream, then. Could he have hallucinated the ghost of Draco Malfoy? He wasn’t drunk, but he was very tired, and he’d been alone with himself for several weeks now.
“That’s a Death Eater,” says Potter, idly. He pushes the bridge of his glasses further up his nose with the end of his wand. Draco hopes he singes off the front of his hair doing that someday.
There’s a new photo tacked up; a young woman in an old fashioned dress he recognises as the style Pansy likes from the period between the Muggles’ big wars, her hair curling softly around her face. She’s looking at the camera, or rather, the person holding the camera, taking her photo. There’s a busy street just beyond her— people coming and going, a child caught mid-shout in the right corner of the frame— but she doesn’t seem to notice anything at all except the faceless, nameless person she’s smiling at. Draco can almost
After awhile, Regulus speaks again. “This war could go either way. You should be ready for a bad ending.”
Potter is waiting by the elevators when Draco finally leaves his office. They ride down to the Atrium, and Draco steps into the same Floo. They come out in a telephone booth in Potter’s neighborhood. The walk is silent for the two blocks to Potter’s house, and neither of them speaks while Potter turns his key in the lock. As soon as the door closes behind him, Potter turns and heads to the kitchen, ripping his Auror robes off on the way. Draco follows, slow. The gap between the feeling and its expression feels looming and large, and always there’s that line inside his head. Right or wrong? Good man or bad man or always in between?
“We’re going to my aunt’s,” he says. “But I thought we could take the Tube, since you like it so much.”
Grab and pull. Slide and twist. Harry knocks him to the floor and follows. They roll across the furs piled up to soften their way and onto the smooth stones. Harry pins him flat with a surprisingly strong forearm across the chest, but Draco manages to trap his leg with a foot and flip them so that Harry is underneath him now.
When Malfoy has returned indoors, Harry follows the raked gravel through the garden until he comes to the large rows of lavender Mrs. Malfoy is tending. She stands up straight when she sees him.
Draco can still see the candlelight flickering over the adults’ faces as the house elves removed the empty plates, still feel the way something opened up inside him like a door to hear someone, anyone, stand up to his father. He hadn’t really understood at the time, had looked again as they left at the portraits lining the main space that ran right up the middle of Regno Hall like an artery, every room opening off from it like an afterthought. Merchants and artists, a famous opera singer and a magistrate of Venice. Royalty wearing heavy ropes of gold from Africa and Rome and medieval London.
“I was orphaned as a baby,” he finally says. “My mother’s sister took me in, but they didn’t want me. They already had a son around the same age, and I was an unwelcome mouth to feed.”
Luna makes a humming noise from where she's seated across from Neville at the small table. She taps her spoon on the edge of her tea cup. "More likely to make a mistake," she says.
“There’s something I need to take care of,” he tells Draco. “I’m sorry, but—well, I shouldn’t be long.”
He looks around, and realizes it’s growing dark; the sun is slinking down behind London’s enclosing skyline. “So have you,” he reminds her. “And there’s something not right about this—“
“I’m going for a walk,” Draco says, wrenching open the crooked door. “Perhaps I’ll be eaten by a bear while I’m out, and all this suffering will be ended.”
“It’s not—“ Draco swallows, and straightens the buttons down the front of his own uniform. If he took it off, would he be more like Draco, or less?
“Well…” Harry hesitated, and Hermione’s gaze grew even sharper. “It’s just that—it appears that Draco Malfoy’s ghost is now haunting me?”
She takes a deep breath. Potter is still holding her hand in both of his, sitting beside her on the cushion. “Yes,” she says. “Since the bombing. I knew Cassius was leading a political revival, knew he wanted to regain power for the old pureblood families and separate us from the Muggles, even the Muggleborns again. I knew he was stirring things up, but—“ Pansy closes her eyes. “I didn’t know until then that he would actually hurt anyone.” She opens her eyes and looks at Draco. “McLaggen came here, the night before the rally was scheduled. The night before the bomb went off. He was agitated, scared. He’s come before and Cassius has had to talk him down, but I thought it was all campaign stuff. And that night was different. He kept saying he thought they were going too far. And then— then I saw the newspapers the next afternoon, and I knew.”
“We have to talk now,” Draco says to Pansy, when they get her alone in her little solar on the second floor. “About Warrington.”
Potter rolls over, closer, and the sheets pull tight over him and then loosen again. An arm slides over Draco’s waist.
“Drink?” Blaise asks, as Draco trails him down the hall. Guido is down on the ground floor, looking up at them from the inner courtyard, the centre of the entire Hall. A high, sweet voice is still singing down among the portraits.
Draco performs the hair charm on Potter’s head again, before they Floo to the Manor. “Remember, Potter,” he says, watching the lighter-colored hair smooth and shape itself into place. “You’re my close friend Dudley Sayre, back in the United Kingdom from a long stint in the United States, originally of the Dublin Sayres.”
It’s been ages since he lay in bed with a lover. Ages since he allowed this easy intimacy. His body curls toward Potter’s without any decision on his part, like a flower turns its face to the sun. Potter’s hair smells like salt and his mint shampoo and Draco pulls a deep breath into his lungs, savoring the feel of cotton and skin, the slow hardening where Potter’s leg is creeping over onto him—
“I see.” Harry looked up at the ceiling. Above him, the projection of Draco Malfoy’s consciousness was probably still attempting to flip the pages of a novel.
“Does that mean you’ll agree?” Harry’s lips are a deep pink and slightly swollen. Draco inhales slowly.
“Watching, but removed.” Draco searches for the censure in Harry’s tone, but he hears only curiosity.
When he emerges around midnight, Potter is asleep on the sofa, snoring. He moves quietly around his tiny kitchen. Out in the garden, the ghost is moving around the perimeter, touching the wall here and there, looking over the rose bushes and shaking its head. It has long hair, but the build of a man, and it pulls an old pocket watch from a front pocket. It moves fretfully, as if searching for a way out. Draco watches for awhile, something hard and icy growing and spreading inside his chest, until finally he pulls the curtains so that the garden is hidden, and goes back to bed.
“Up to?” Malfoy’s face was starting to flush. “I just like it here! Is that so impossible to believe?”
Draco, too, seems softer, more sure. His kisses linger. Naked, their fingers find new scars and marks from the years between them.
“Do you remember that line at the beginning? When he talked about the voices he sometimes heard right before falling asleep?”
It’s always like this; Blaise sits and studies these photographs like other people might read a book. He dreams up stories and names, relations and problems, and always, always wondering at what the Muggles might be thinking in the moment they were immortalised, as though it were the great mystery of his life.
Draco twitches, involuntary, but doesn’t respond to Potter's assumption. Instead, he says, “I know you owe me nothing, Potter. Less than nothing. But I’ll never ask you for anything else, ever again. You’ll never see me again, I swear, if—“
Harry could hear his own blood rushing through his eardrums, but it wasn’t anger fueling the dizzy rush anymore. It was something else. Maybe—
Draco turns away. The window frames his view of the estate, a series of snapshots in his memory of the castle—his home—in rain and sunshine, in cold, clinging snow and summer’s effusive golden light. “Now it’s a habit and I’m the only one who would have me break it.”
“I dug out all the weeds and brambles myself,” Harry tells him, pointing out the new empty spaces. “But what’s left— the flower beds and the herbs and especially the roses over there— well, they need some help. Neglected too long, I suppose. I don’t really know what I’m doing there, I’m afraid.”
Draco stares at the baskets. Is Harry asking to live here? Can Draco refuse such an offer, even for his pride? Even for his heart?
He swims, hard, heaving his whole body against the waves. The sun is coming up behind the castle and the gulls are crying overhead and he swims until his arms are burning, his mouth opening and closing only to pull the cold morning air into his greedy lungs. When he stops, he’s well beyond the breakers and the sea is calm. The shore is a dark line in the distance and the castle still splintering the silvery blue behind it. He puts his face up toward the sky, lets his arms and legs float loose around him. The water laps at his ears, sound going funny and muted.
It’s ugly, of course. Almost breathtakingly ugly, extraordinary in its clashing ostentation. If it were a person, it would be a brash East Ender, a woman wearing too many prints in colours just the other side of too bright, high heels smacking the concrete on Brick Lane, yelling at cyclists to get out of the way. A walking wince. Someone you’d fall in love with, too, in spite of yourself.
Potter leans in, his other hand coming up too and he’s got Draco’s whole face caught up in his gravity. Draco closes his eyes when Potter’s mouth lands on his; the shocking heat waiting for him there, the taste he’s only imagined, and poorly. Nothing tastes as good as Harry. Nothing feels as good as Harry’s fingers tightening, spreading out into the hair behind Draco’s ears, holding him close as though there is any chance Draco might pull away.
Granger and Weasley both look up from setting the table when he walks in behind Potter. After a brief, intense silence, Granger holds out an extra plate to Weasley, who rolls his eyes at her and takes it, setting it down with the other three.
The sounds fade quickly as he makes his way down the hall; there must be a Muffling Charm built into it. He knocks on the giant, carved mahogany door, and one of the birds entwined in the branches of a large tree twists to life from the relief, flapping its wings and looking down at him. It opens its beak, and says, “Come in, Mr. Malfoy," and the door swings open.
“Draco, please—“ Pansy makes a sudden movement at his side, then stops. “It would be best to just let this go, wouldn’t it?”
“How’s the case going, Hermione?” Dean asks from the kitchen, where he’s washing his brushes in empty jam jars.
Harry breathed into his blankets, and waited, but that was all he said. And Harry understood. This— whatever
He owls Ginny to let her know something is coming in the Monday edition of the Prophet. He asks to come over and tell her himself, in person beforehand, but she tells him not to worry. “Come in the morning for breakfast,” she writes back. “We’ll talk then.”
Millicent snorts, and stabs at her fish. She’s never cared much for fine manners; Draco used to think less of her for it, but these days he appreciates the transparency.
The kettle is starting to hum, like it does just before it boils and whistles, but Potter isn’t looking at it. He doesn’t even seem to notice. He’s watching Draco.
Potter cracks the door open in the afternoon, as the light is starting to slant toward evening. Draco lies very still, feigning sleep. He counts the seconds in his head as Potter waits and creeps close. Probably to make sure Draco isn’t dead from alcohol poisoning.
Draco takes a deep breath. He wants to put his hands on Harry. He wants to map out every place he’s only looked at, only imagined in the secret corners of his mind.
Malfoy made a noise in his throat, and then pulled Harry back with a hand around the back of his neck. It was different from kissing Ginny; harder, sloppier, more teeth. Malfoy’s chest was firm against his own, and when he pulled him closer, their bodies pushing against each other, there was no give.
Harry smiled. He felt slow and heavy. Lazy. “You wish, Malfoy. It was good, though, yeah? It was…right.”
Draco wonders what Weasley now owes her the extra minutes of, but Potter screws up his face and says, “Ergh! You’re not allowed to be gross in front of me, you know that.”
“I”d prefer a hole in the ground to that mausoleum you call Malfoy Manor, now you mention it,” he said. “But don’t worry— you’ll be able to slither on home to Mummy and Daddy and the warm company of your servants and galleons soon.”
“Ah,” says Weasley. “Good. Anyone can get to the bottom of this mess, it’s Hermione. I sort of hope you get to the bastard first, though, to be honest. He deserves something a lot rougher than just a simple arrest.” He shakes his head. “That poor beast. A dragon’s heart is all about the flyin’, you know? Worst thing you can do to ‘em, to take that way.”
a tomorrow. But he just nods, and picks his way slowly over to the makeshift staging point they’d created earlier. There’s a witch handing out return Portkeys to people too tired to Apparate back; it’s the same witch that made the emergency batch earlier. She manages a brief, tired smile and drops something into his palm. It’s a small piece of metal shaped like a witch’s hat. As the tug grabs him in the belly, and the world begins to swirl, he glances one more time back toward the carnage, and catches sight of Potter standing on the pockmarked sidewalk in front of the destroyed building. His head is tilted back, and from this distance he looks quite small. Draco could almost imagine he was the boy of the last War again, young and doomed and stupidly noble. He stops that line of thought, though, as Potter spins out of sight and Draco cracks through the ether, back to the Ministry. He doesn’t want to think about the boy
There’s a younger man in denim overalls standing in front of the metal doors to the building. Granger pulls out her badge and he nods at her, glancing quickly over Draco’s distinctive crimson robes and away again. The doors are barred on the outside, and he taps his wand on a mechanism to the side. Tiny springs pop open along the seam and the man forces the thick bar up with a grunt, letting he and Granger slip through a slim margin of open door. It shuts quickly behind them.
Draco sighs. “I’m not sure where to begin, or what exactly we’d be looking for. I think our best bet is to mingle—“ he shudders. “And listen. There’s got to be some Traditional Wizarding Order members on this guest list.”
“I know you’re here and also in Azkaban,” Harry said. “I know this is you, without your body. Hermione did some research.”
“You make eyes at him over corpses, Draco. There is nothing casual about that.” Blaise raises his eyebrows and tips his glass in Draco’s direction.
“It’s just a political party.” He takes a drink from his water goblet. “I think a lot of purebloods support it. I just wondered if that might be what Greg’s helping Warrington with.”
At the end of the long corridor, it opens up into a bigger space facing a single walled pen. Three men are standing at one of the judas gates in the door, looking in at the poor animal making sounds he can now make out— low whines deep in the throat, a kind of wheeze with every exhale. When the men see Granger, they step aside.
