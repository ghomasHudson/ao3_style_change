"So, you love me too? And you want to come to the ball with me?" Harry grinned.
However, as it is in the middle of summer, the last ball is in the distant past and the next one isn't even in your schedule yet, so there is very little you could have done to piss him off. Of course, there still is a chance that he might be pissed off, because it is easily done. And sometimes he just acts that way because he can; because he wants to.
"Harry, please. You have know me for how long now? Seventeen years at least, when we are counting Hogwarts. You must know that I am the arguing type. I enjoy it, and I especially enjoy arguing with you, like I presume you enjoy arguing with me. Its comfortable, relaxing and fun. Also quite beneficial, because I do not explode in the face of the morons I am forced to work with." Draco shrugged his shoulders.
"I tried to let you be the Gryffindor we all know and love," Draco replied, looking at his nails.
The drawled words are like the first sip of water after a long walk in the desert.
You are not sure how, but the first dildo, the smallest of the three is in your hand, while the fingers of the other hand are dipping in and out of your own hole. This time, your fingers move faster, as if the last command has erased the order to go slow. You need to be filled, and you want it now.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Will you just calm down?" he asked irritably, attempting to get a better hold on the squirming boy.
They were nearly equal in height and weight, but Harry had the advantage of having wrestled with Dudley for over half of his life, and managed to restrain the other boy. After several minutes, Malfoy finally gave up his struggles and they paused, panting and sweaty, Harry's forehead resting against Malfoy's.
"What can I say? I'm petty."
"Cockroach Cluster!" Harry shouted at the impassive face of the stone gargoyle. Tearing off his cloak when it did not move, thinking absurdly that somehow it had prevented his voice from carrying, he shouted again, "Cockroach Cluster!"
"Not everything, no," said Harry, his head bowed beneath the fabric of his Invisibility Cloak. "I mean, I'm still snogging Malfoy, aren't I? Andenjoying it. But between us? Yeah."
Draco drew a sharp breath and his hand spasmed slightly. Harry noticed, but decided to ignore it. Draco hesitantly ran the backs of his perfectly manicured nails over the underside of Harry's fingers. When traced Harry's palm, Harry jumped at the tingle that spread up his arm. It didn't quite tickle, but it didn't feel bad either.
Harry pulled away, catching a quick glimpse of Malfoy's flushed face before he closed his eyes and kissed him.
Out of sheer restlessness, and to escape Neville's curiosity, Harry decided to pay the Headmaster's office a visit that night. After whispering the password and beginning to climb the narrow, winding steps, he thought he heard voices coming from the top of the stair. He took the next few steps as quietly as he could and pressed his back against the wall near the door hinges.
Sliding his tongue down Malfoy's jawline, he looked up and caught a glimpse of his face. Draco's eyes were closed and his mouth gaped open in a silent scream.
"No, I suppose we don't," Harry returned.
"Just do it and get it over with, then?" he asked sheepishly.
Harry stared at her blankly for a moment. "I don't understand. Why aren't you telling this to Malfoy too?"
Draco stood and walked over to one of the armchairs, fastening his fly and shooting a glare over his shoulder at Harry as he went.
Malfoy sat, arms tucked tightly across his chest, legs crossed and one foot tapping against the leg of his chair. He glared heatedly back at Harry, somehow cluing into the point of the Muggle game, and refused to break eye contact.
"Do you mean that?" Harry asked, his eyes narrowing.
"Who said it would be wasteful? Imagine how many tardies and call-offs in the workplace it would cut back on. It would only increase productivity. Besides, let me tell you something... Do you have any idea how much I pay for my face cream?"
Draco's eyes narrowed briefly before he nodded and squeezed them tightly shut, slippping his right hand into Harry's trousers. Harry focused on Malfoy's expression, watching with fascination as the other boy's eyelids fluttered nervously and he drew his lip in between his teeth as his hand finally grazed over the rigid length of Harry through his pants.
Glancing with trepidation at the wall out of the corner of his eye, Draco slid a hand over his erection through the material of his trousers. His eyes closed and he sighed as he teased his fingers up and down his own length. Opening his eyes a crack, he gave the wall one last distrustful look before quickly undoing his trousers and sliding his underpants down his hips. Taking himself in his hand, he worked quickly, convinced that Harry would change his mind and make the wall go away any second. Silently, he willed it to remain up just a bit longer, just a bit...
Draco began to move his hand faster, and Harry heard other sounds. The familiar sounds of boys readying themselves for bed, but the voices were different. He heard Crabbe and Goyle bickering over a magazine, and Blaise Zabini's irritated voice announcing that he was trying to study for a Transfiguration exam the next day.
Ron swallowed hard before answering, attempting to give her his best doe eyes while he was at it.
"I'm not upset with Ron," Harry said, wiping away a few flakes of crust clinging to the corner of his mouth. "I knew that I was blowing up over nothing, that's why I went for a walk in the first place. To cool my head."
'This must be what Professor Mason sees,' Harry thought, awe-struck. Looking around, Harry attempted to remember which booths belonged to which couple. There was Theodore Nott and Padma Patil's booth, with a gentle, rippling pool of blue and green swirls. Goyle and Parkinson's booth had a violent pink glare above it, and Harry winced and turned away with a grimace of distaste. And there was...
Harry flung himself face down onto his bed the second he reached his room. The walk back to the Gryffindor dorm had been a highly uncomfortable one. Grimacing, he reached down and tugged on the front of his trousers. All he wanted was to have a wank and a good night's sleep.
Harry glanced around the room, noting that most everyone had been paired off already and were either blushing shyly at their partner with pleased half smiles on their faces, or they looking distinctly unhappy. Then he heard his own name called.
Frustrated, Professor Mason sighed and snapped, "Mr. Malfoy, place your head on Mr. Potter's shoulder."
"That's- that's-" Malfoy made a scoffing sound to cover up the fact that he was slipping.
Draco scoffed. "And how do you think that'll work? What with my working for the wizard that wants to kill you, and all."
Sighing, Harry ran a hand roughly through his hair, pacing away a few steps before turning back to face his shamed roommate. "I'm sorry, Ron. I didn't mean to... I just need to go for a walk, that's all."
"A large portion of what you'll be dealing with in this subject is control. Control of yourself, your partner, and the magic between you during the heights of physical pleasure. Without control, there can be no trust. Without trust, you will be completely lost in this subject."
Harry was grunting softly with every other pull now, his heart beating erratically with the thought that they could be discovered at any moment. Crabbe and Goyle's fight was getting heated, and Crabbe brushed heavily against the bed curtains from Goyle's hard shove. Harry made a sharp sound and pushed his hips up, thrusting into Draco's hand.
Harry and Draco dropped their half-eaten sandwiches reluctantly. Apparently the silently agreed upon ruse to eat as many sandwiches as their stomachs could handle hadn't worked. They'd gotten as far as five before she caught on to them. Moving more slowly than was strictly necessary, they made their way into the tent and turned to face Mason.
It wasn't like last time; no awkward mashing of lips. Malfoy hesitated momentarily, then he was kissing Harry back, drawing him closer and opening his mouth to draw in Harry's tongue.
"Just like the Triwizard Tournament," Harry muttered.
"Er, yes," said Malfoy. "We're supposed to, um, do what we did last week... Only more."
"So, what'll it be today, Potter?" he asked, as though asking what Harry would like for dessert.
"I already told you!" Draco said defensively.
Sliding his mouth away and along a sharp jaw line, Harry collected the thin film of perspiration that dewed Malfoy's skin on his tongue. Pressing open-mouthed kisses on his throat, Harry released Malfoy's left hand and slid a hand up his thigh. Malfoy gasped tremulously and jerked against him. Harry cupped his erection through his trousers as he worked the clasp and fly open.
"Sex Magic!" he shouted.
"Michael Corner and Parvati Patil..."
"Galleons always land Ministry side up. So when you're calling a coin toss, always choose 'Goblin'. That way, when they flip it over, it'll be Goblin side up. The pricks at the Ministry weighted down that side when they made the cast, so that if someone ever lost their coin, when they found it the first thing they'd see is the Ministry emblem. Dad told us it's supposed to inspire good faith, or something. Really, it just makes blokes like us more lucky in our bets."
"What?" Hermione snapped, clearly disbelieving. "Let me see that."
"Yes, wait!" Malfoy followed in Harry's wake.
Harry breathed harshly through his nose all the way back to Gryffindor Tower. Dark and bright spots danced in front of his vision, and he realized that he was hyperventilating without much care.
"I was checking every booth, just in case." Malfoy told him.
Summoning up the courage to look around at the rest of the students, Harry saw that the class consisted of purely Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Slytherins. He supposed that made sense. Gryffindors were brave and curious by nature. Ravenclaws would be interested in learning absolutely every facet of magic possible. And Slytherins... Well, it was Dark Magic, after all. His gaze narrowed as it lighted on Draco Malfoy, who was snickering over something with Pansy Parkinson. No doubt that the two of them would be paired together. The disgusting thought that he might have to watch Malfoy snogging the pug-faced Parkinson flitted through his mind and he recoiled. Malfoy looked up and grinned at Harry.
"Let go!" Draco ordered, pushing against Harry's hands.
Neville looked dejected. He hadn't meant to upset Harry, but he'd been rather curious. The other boys were a little too quick to dismiss the Goblet's decision as a fluke, but Neville open to a more insightful interpretation.
"Ron..." he prodded in a low tone.
"Potter..." he moaned.
The thought brought her back around to the two boys in front of her. They had such potential. At first, she had imagined that the animosity between them would only fuel the heights to which their magic would take them, but she was beginning to have doubts. None of the initially tumultuous pairings she'd had before had genuine reasons to hate each other. The usual schoolchild teasing, hair-pulling and whatnot, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. These two, on the other hand, were on opposite sides of a war.
Harry knew exactly how he felt.
It was the Sex Magic classroom!
"Take away more points, then." Harry told him with a shrug, pocketing Draco's wand. "So, why are you really in here?"
Draco sniggered into his hand and in the process attracted the rather unpleasant attention of a wrathful Professor Mason.
"Well, well, Potter," he drawled, twirling his wand lazily. "That'll be fifty points from Gryffindor, I think."
"I imagine my appearance shocks you?"
So he watched instead as Malfoy blinked several times before focusing on Harry on the couch. He jumped, obviously not expecting to find anyone else in the booth, but a slow grin quickly replaced his expression of shock.
Rosemary moved her gaze to Draco and felt her heart clench, as it always did when she dwelt too long upon certain students. She couldn't bring herself to imagine any of them doing the things that Death Eaters did. It seemed impossible for these smooth-cheeked innocents. If she were completely honest with herself, she would admit her hope that the pairing between the Malfoy boy and Potter would win him over to the other side. That they would both be stronger for it, and it could possibly make the difference between winning the war or losing it. Between life or death, for the both of them.
Draco made a gurgled noise of surprise, but thrust down into the cup of Harry's palm almost at once. In less than a minute, Draco was gripping the back of the sofa and biting his lower lip. Harry sensed that he was close, and hasily undid the zip of his trousers, grasping him through the moist fabric of his underpants.
For the first few moments, neither of them moved. They sat there, mouths pressed together, awkward and uncertain. Malfoy shifted, angling his head to the side slightly. Harry sighed through his nose, frustrated at the lack of snogging, and began kissing Malfoy properly. Draco drew in a quick breath, frozen in place. Harry deepened the kiss by degrees until he felt the blond boy begin to respond.
Some strength, she thought, lay not in power but in endurance.
Harry groaned. He did not want to talk to anyone at the moment, most especially not anyone associated with Sex Magic. Leaving his face buried in his pillow, he didn't bother looking up.
"Well, I'd imagine that being forced to shag one's nemesis would unnerve most people," she said.
Harry didn't answer, opting instead to stuff a large bite of chicken into his mouth. Hermione's eyebrows rose.
"I love being teased. Little outfits, stripteases, being tied down..." - Jacob Bruns, 32, Perth
"Suppose that I am willing to admit that I enjoy our... sessions together," he relented grudgingly, turning to stare at Harry once again. "I'd want something in return."
Harry felt Malfoy squirming, rolling his shoulders and adjusting his body to lessen the strain on his neck. It looked quite uncomfortable, but he was disinclined to do anything about it.
Harry wasn't surprised. He'd never pictured Lucius and Narcissa as very cuddly. But somehow that revelation seemed monumental. He knew the question hadn't been completely answered yet, though.
"What? Why?" asked Harry, confused.
"Mr. Potter!" Professor Mason boomed over whatever obscenity a white-faced Draco had shouted at him. "That's quite enough. Mr. Malfoy, dinner. Now."
"Despite what?" she asked quietly, and if she was slightly breathless she would never admit it.
Harry sighed impatiently, not in the mood to deal with Malfoy's evasiveness. "Malfoy, just tell me what it is we're supposed to do."
On Friday he could have sworn he heard Mrs. Weasley's voice calling him down to breakfast as he inhaled the scent of bacon and pressed a bright orange pillow over his face to muffle his moans. When it was Draco's turn, Harry wrinkled his nose at the sudden odor of potions ingredients and rotten wood. He thought it was quite odd that Draco got off while surrounded by newt's eyes and other assorted pickled body parts, but whatever worked.
Pulling on his sensitive flesh rapidly, Draco silently berated himself. He'd been so close to having someone other than himself touch his dick for the first time. Even if it had been Potter... Potter's hand... almost touching... almost... Oh!
Dumbledore sighed, settling deeper into his chair with a look of utter exhaustion.
"Just wank me off."
"What about you, Potter? Pulling me closer? Wrapping your legs around me? Don't tell me you didn't get something out of it."
"What kind of question is that? N- I mean, of course n-" Draco sputtered.
"What's wrong?" Hermione asked.
"What, exactly, does more entail?" asked Harry.
He heard Malfoy groan softly in disgust, but felt him pull their hands apart to run the tip of his index finger down to the base of Harry's thumb. He stopped, seeming satisfied and reluctant to continue any further. Harry would have let him, but Mason was staring right at them. Shaking his head, Harry trailed his fingers down the back of Malfoy's hand to his wrist bone, the rough pads of his fingers scraping against the soft flesh.
Tonight, however, the cobwebs were absent and a thick trail of dust extended out past the feet of the statue in a half-crescent. Harry drew up short, his sneakers scuffing loudly on the stone floor. He knew that no one could change the password but the Headmaster himself. So unless Dumbledore had returned, it would still be...
"What if I want to make sure he likes it, Parvati?" Lavender asked, closing her magazine and carefully setting it aside.
Harry stared at Dumbledore, stubbornly refusing to listen to the weakness in his knees suggesting that he sit down. Refusing to entertain the image that wanted to make itself known, of Ron and Hermione, bloody and unmoving, with Harry standing above them, wand hanging limp and useless in his fingers.
"What? I'm just saying that it comes as no great surprise, is all." Malfoy couldn't seem to stop grinning.
"Whips, Potter?" he asked maliciously, and Harry blushed to the roots of his hair.
Nodding feverently, Harry swallowed. It was quite a bit to take in all at once. "Yes," he said, meaning it. "I'll read it. I promise."
"Whispering?" Harry pressed.
Harry jerked his chin as he called out, "Goblin!"
Taking the stairs in a slow, loping gait, Harry thought about his current situation. He'd pretty much come to terms with the fact that kissing Malfoy was rather pleasant. He'd also decided that whatever questions that raised about his sexuality could wait until after the sociopath who wanted to kill him had been dealt with.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. He hadn't really thought about that. He had read ahead in the syllabus, yes, but only to the part about manual stimulation. He didn't really have a problem giving Malfoy a handjob; it was like masturbating, only in reverse. But putting his mouth on another bloke's equipment...
"I don't want to anymore!"
"I'm afraid I have bad news, Mr. Potter," she told him tonelessly. "Professor Dumbledore has reaffirmed my feelings regarding the matter, specifically pertaining to the Goblet of Fire. While there may have been foul play involved in your enrollment, your signature was your own. The Goblet made its assessment based on the qualities it found within your character. Had it found reluctance to participate in the class, we would not be here. There can be no mistake. I'm sorry."
Left to his resentful thoughts, Harry didn't notice the figure rounding the doorway of the trophy room until it was too late. He collided with something hard and pointy and it squawked.
"The curtains are still green," he heard Malfoy say, as he felt a hand sliding along his semi-erect length.
Harry snatched Malfoy's hand back, tugging it closer with a painful grip. "It shows," he told him, scraping his nails lightly over the Slytherin's knuckles.
Harry looked up from his preoccupation with Malfoy's neck and drew a deep breath. The cloak was held limply in his hands, nearly forgotten, as Draco looked back at him. Both boys fell into silence, and whatever squabble they'd been having was no longer important. Harry felt as though smoke were filling his lungs, hot and choking. Draco swallowed, his eyes doing the thing where they flicked from one side of Harry's face to the other, as though he was weighing his options. Harry felt the insane urge to kiss him, and took a step forward...
They hit the floor in an ungraceful, tangled sprawl. Harry's nose was smashed against the floor, his hands still caught underneath Malfoy. Draco groaned and shifted, attempting to maneuver around Harry's knuckles pressed into the small of his back.
"Fuck you, Potter," Draco breathed heatedly.
"I could ask you the same," Harry returned.
Harry nodded.
Cursing, Harry turned on his heel and walked a few steps steps away, dragging his hands through his hair. Turning back around, he stalked forward and watched as Malfoy shrunk back from him. All he could see were wide, anticipating gray eyes and inviting lips. Clenching his teeth, Harry snatched his cloak out of Draco's nerveless fingers, yanked his wand from the waistband of his trousers, and turned back the way he'd come. He wasn't in the mood to look at suits of armor anymore.
Just then she looked up and saw him, still smiling brightly at something Parvati had said. She stopped, the smile slipping from her face instantly. Parvati gave her a worried look, placing a hand on her arm.
After a moment Malfoy's stiff, tense shoulders relaxed against him. Harry held his breath as Malfoy settled his head into the crook of his neck and shoulder. His arms were still wrapped around the other boy, and it made him feel strange. But he refused to move them, it would be too much like giving in.
Mason sighed. "Because, Mr. Potter, you are going to have to be the one to take control of this situation."
A familiar Irish lilt carried across the courtyard and the two boys by the lake turned their heads to see Seamus, Dean and Ron coming down the slope.
Harry thought about the harsh pink glare above their booth, and quickly dismissed it from his mind. Thinking about Pansy and Goyle was counterproductive to his goal at the moment.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "The fact that it was the twins, and that they required a signature to procure Harry a girlfriend didn't raise a few alarms in that thick head of yours?"
He drew his gaze away from his best friends to stare off into the empty fireplace. The warm familiarity of the common room did little to thaw the dread settling into an icy knot in the pit of his stomach.
Malfoy sat tensely on the sofa, his knees pressed primly together and wringing his hands. He jumped when Harry entered, his face flickering through a myriad of swiftly concealed emotions. Harry ignored him and made his way over to the opposite end of the couch, slumping down onto it in a haphazard arrangement of limbs. Removing his glasses, he set them on the low table nearby and threw an arm over his eyes.
As quietly as possible, Harry slipped his cloth-covered hand over the doorknob and turned it ever so slowly. As the door cracked open, flashing lights of blue, pink and gold washed over the thin fabric of Harry's cloak. He stared in astonishment as he stepped inside, face tilted up to watch the swirling, glittering vortexes of magical energy dancing above dark peaks of purple velvet.
"Why?" Draco asked.
"Give me back my cloak, Malfoy." Harry said tightly. The sight of such a cherished object in Malfoy's hands sent an uncomfortable skitter though his stomach.
"Er, Professor?" Harry spoke up. "Is that Veritaserum?"
"I don't know what you're talking about!" Draco shouted at him desperately.
Harry, on the other hand, felt Mason's presence like a shock of cold water. He clambered off of Malfoy, feeling uncomfortably hot and sweaty, and immensely dissatisfied.
Mason watched as the two boys left the room. They took care not to bump into one another on their way out the door. She should have known holding hands, snuggling and long talks wouldn't work with these two. It would still take some work, she supposed, but judging by the brilliant white sparks that had been crackling above their booth, she doubted very much that they could hide from their feelings much longer.
"I shall be on my way. Feel free to remain here for as long as you like," he said, and Harry felt a strong urge to say no; to grab onto him and force him to stay. Instead he nodded, and the Headmaster slipped around his chair and out of his sight. "Goodbye."
Draco's eyes went wide, and Harry looked down to see the tables he passed vibrating. He willed them to clatter more forcefully, and the blond jumped and pushed himself flat against the wall of their booth.
"So, everything's all right, then?"
"Careful, you're going to rip it!" Harry warned, his eyes wide and distraught behind his glasses.
Draco didn't answer immediately. He drew his lower lip partially between his teeth and Harry's eyes followed the movement unconsciously. When he let the reddened flesh slowly slip from his bite, Harry looked away and released the breath that he'd been holding.
"I didn't say anything like that, Malfoy," Harry told him, annoyed.
The Headmaster made a ghastly picture, ruined as he was, and Harry hesitantly took his hand, allowing himself to be helped to his feet.
Harry suppressed a grin. Malfoy was doing his best not to let his nervousness show, but with every step closer that Harry took his expression grew more apprehensive.
"We've been using this room since the subject was first brought to Hogwarts over fifty years ago. As our needs during the course of the class often change, it is convenient to have a room that adjusts to fit them. Now, if there are no complaints..."
"Turn toward me," Harry said, surprising himself.
Harry chuckled an unthinkingly ran a hand up and down Draco's ankle in a casual caress. Draco sobered immediately, drawing his leg away to swing into a sitting position on the sofa. Harry knew a moment of disappointment before it was forcibly squashed.
The first thing that Harry noticed was that the booth, quite like the Weasleys' tents at the Quidditch World Cup, was much larger inside than it appeared from the outside. It was comfortably furnished with two squashy armchairs and a loveseat. Harry and Draco each took one of the chairs. Mason remained standing.
Harry felt himself go stiff, suddenly unsure. He'd been so focused on winning over Draco up until this point that he'd forgotten about his own apprehension regarding his virginity. Forcing himself to relax, he let his hand slip from Draco's nape onto the edge of the sofa.
"Not with Neville? Oh, really, Lavender, please! I know that you have to do things with him in that class, but you don't have to... to make sure he likes it!"
"Yes," Harry responded a bit too loudly. "Fine."
Ron cast Harry a pained glance and Harry grinned in response, shaking his head. It was their seventh year at Hogwarts and some things would never change.
"You want me to treat you as an adult, and not a child. I think you have earned it, and so I shall give you honesty at its most complete and ugly." The Headmaster stared at his shriveled hands folded on the desktop. "War is coming. Many will die, and among their numbers will be those within these walls. Teachers, classmates, friends... Some of their deaths you will not be able to prevent, and some you will be responsible for."
Draco shrugged. "I can't bring myself to. If I know ahead of time, I start to think about it, and..." He gave an exaggerated shudder. "I dread these classes enough already."
Draco did as asked, arching his back up off of the floor so that Harry could slide his hands out from underneath him. Harry pushed himself into a more comfortable position, turning his head so that his cheek lay against the cool floor.
His abdomen tightened as a spark of pleasure seared down his spine. He wrenched away from the kiss with an audible smacking sound, gasping in air as he rocked steadily against the warm body under him. Malfoy arched up rhythmically, making small, soft noises as he panted. The sound made Harry growl animalistically, and he buried his face in the crook of the blond's neck and shoulder and marked him with his teeth.
"What!" Two boys rushed to their feet, extreme disbelief evident in their voices.
"I can't believe you're still planning on being a Death Eater. Not after all we've-"
The word was growled and barely audible, and Harry hoped the other boy felt all of the pent up wrath behind it in his bones. Malfoy, however, seemed happily oblivious to Harry's mood, and regarded him almost shyly as he took a few steps forward. The flap to their booth was swaying slightly, and Harry realized with a hot stab of anger that Malfoy had just come from inside.
A load moan is all you hear, and it takes a few moments for you to catch on and realise that you are the one moaning.
Surprise fills you at the lack of shock you feel at the mere suggestion, as you lean down to remove your socks. Rather you find yourself intrigued. How would he teach you? What would he make you do? Which poses would he enjoy seeing you in? Could you make him lose control with the right movements?
“Maybe, if you behave, and I can move that way. Otherwise you will have to live with you on your back and me on top of you, but then, I seem to recall you didn’t mind it this morning, either.”
The twisted thing of it all is that he wants you. He wants you just as badly as you want him. You are certain of it, just like he must be certain of your want of him.
"How is he even allowed to marry into the Zabini family?" Harry asked, astonished.
As they separated Harry had delightfully red cheeks, which made Draco smile again.
"So very needy. But never let it be said that, I have no mercy. You may even choose, Potter. Would you like to fuck yourself with that toy, or would you like for me to fuck you?"
"Potter, look at me."
"But you were laughing with him, you were bumping his shoulders, you never do that with me," Harry said defensively, finally standing up, because he apparently didn't like being talked down to.
Draco was also a romantic, and a cuddler, not that Harry ever was stupid enough to mention that one out loud. Sometimes he was up for joking and silliness, and Harry enjoyed it all.
"I know, why don’t you give me a nice show?"
And just like that, as your hands start to move on their own, you know again why things are that way. Because you are Potter and he is Malfoy and it only makes sense in this room. Because in the light of the day it would never work. Because to the world you are the perfect hero just waiting to settle down, and he is the enfant terrible, of whom everybody has a certain respect, while also cutting him whenever possible.
Draco breathed out a heavy sigh. "Potter... Harry, if I could barely stand you, do you think you would have entrance to my laboratory, where you have annoyed me daily until recently?" And then finally something dropped into place for Draco. "Wait, you are not coming down to me anymore because you are doing junior-field Auror work, on top of your normal duties, is that it?" Draco asked exasperated.
A helpless sound escapes your lips as your hands slow down, inserting the toy inch by slow inch. The muscles in your thighs are contracting due to the effort of holding you up. You want to move, you want to be filled, but you cannot.
"I, I didn't know that," Harry said.
"You were not simply talking!"
It is always him.
A sudden movement of his wand catches your attention and distracts you from trying to figure out the meaning of the words.
"Please!"
“Oh, no, surely you didn’t. Forget it Potter, I know that look, and it is not going to happen. We have a tree to decorate.” Draco sat up, stretching slowly. The feathers adorning the sides of his face, his lower arms and legs and around his hips all the way to his bellybutton, outlining the small paunch that had grown there over the last months. gleamed in the afternoon light, making Harry’s fingers itch once again.
"Well, now that I have you here, what shall I do with you?"
Draco, on the other hand, struggled with his fear of turning into his own father, of repeating the same mistakes, and with the knowledge that he needed to raise his child to live up to Malfoy standards, but also to accept that their child would be half Veela. However Harry knew that was not all of it. He could feel it, the hint of jealousy. While Harry had no doubt that Draco would do everything for this child, it was too early in their relationship for Draco to share him.
Ugh, no, thought Harry.
"Coming, Potter?" he asked, and then winced at his unintentional pun.
"Gathering forces, allies," said Dumbledore. "His army is nearly complete, all of his old comrades found and amassed."
They hadn't spoken about it. They merely began each lesson, eagerly awaiting whatever secret desire would be fulfilled that day.
"Today I want to talk about the actual magical part of this class," the Professor began. "The theory of Sex Magic was brought about by Lerner Cunningham, affectionately nicknamed Lerner the Lecherous, in the mid 1930's. He observed the increased amount of wandless magic that appeared to happen when he and his wife were intimate, such as glasses shattering, furniture rattling or candle flames extinguishing. Based on this, he theorized that when a magical person is involved in sexual activity they are not in complete control of their magic. When that person's partner is also a witch or wizard, the combined magical energy between them is quite powerful, but unfocused. He thought that if their magic could be brought under control, using their increasing pleasure as sort of a catalyst for the strength of the magic to grow as they reach climax, great things could be accomplished."
It is such an embarrassing position, but there is no embarrassment. There is no room for embarrassment in the spell, there is only doing and wanting, and you want him so much!
Putting first your hands, then your knees on the bed you slowly crawl towards the headboard. With every movement along the way, you can feel those burning eyes on your body.
And he had done so. He had spent one whole day in the lab with Draco. Not that he had been any help or anything, and he had understood what Draco was telling him before noon, but it's not that easy to find time to talk to Draco so he had to be creative. And he now knows more about reverse engineering from addictive potions than he knows what to do with, but he also had a nice conversation.
This is something you can only get when you come here, to him. Your arrangement with him gives you the freedom to act in ways nobody, not even yourself, would expect or allow you to act.
Draco raised his eyebrow in astonishment. "Keeping tabs on me again, are we Potter? I can assure you, I did not break any confidentiality rules, though I do not understand why I have to talk with you first, instead of directly contacting the Auror who is doing the investigation. Back when you were a junior, we always discussed your cases, after all" Draco couldn't stop himself from making that light barb.
There is a soft chuckle, and his hand works its way through your hair.
"Go! Away! I have work to do," was the not so courteous reply he got for his effort.
"Not that it was ever needed in the first place."
“Don’t worry Potter, I won’t stop yet.”
The command, softly spoken into your ear, settles easily. As it does so, the knots and tingles in your body loosen up or vanish and you feel carefree, the weight of your responsibilities lifted.
You know you are touching yourself, something you hardly do outside of this room. But in here, under the spell, it doesn't feel like your own touch. It feels as if his hands are on you, especially as you have no control over the movement. The spell has taken that control from you.
You are unashamed when warmth spreads through your body, arousal in its wake. You stand up fluidly as soon as Draco moves his arm to dictate for you to do so.
For ten years, he has been trying to get close to Draco. And, in some way he believes that he is some sort of friend to Draco. Not the good kind of friend, not the tell you all my secrets friend, certainly. But, at least once a month he manages to get Draco to agree to a pint at the pub. Harry believe that to mean something, like a friendship forming.
You moan, you beg, you whimper. He moves just as he pleases, keeping you on the edge. Neither of you closes your eyes.
And with that, he picks up speed, making your body shiver a bit. But only a few thrusts later his orgasm hits him, making him come buried deep inside you, his head hidden in the crook of your neck.
His face is so close to yours that his breath caresses your face. There could be a kiss without both of you having to move that much. And for a moment you hope, but you aren't surprised when he moves back up again and starts moving.
"Looking forward to having you wank me off on Friday, Malfoy," he said coldly. "And I'm not too sodding proud to admit it."
Malfoy drew himself up on his elbows as Harry settled back onto his side of the sofa. A heavy silence hung between the two of them as they straightened their robes and stood. Harry glanced in Malfoy's direction, and Draco looked away quickly.
Harry ducked under the curtain after him and blushed furiously at Professor Mason standing there, looking at him with a small smile on her face. "All right, Mr. Potter?"
Pushing the door open with her foot, Hermione heard muffled sobs coming from Lavender and Parvati's side of the room. Sure enough, both girls were huddled there on Lavender's bed, Parvati rubbing Lavender's back soothingly. It was a familiar scene; Lavender was the delicate type and cried often. Hermione usually ignored it, but in light of the odd behavior of all of the Gryffindors involved in Sex Magic, she decided that feigning interest might buy her some answers.
It was strange, Harry thought. Malfoy offering to give up, yet somehow gaining control of the situation at the same time. It was just like him. Harry felt his chest tighten at the thought of Malfoy gaining the upper hand.
Harry turned to face her. "Voldemort is gathering forces. Tracking down his old allies and mustering up a Dark Army. Dumbledore says his ranks are nearly full. He thinks he'll make his move soon."
"It's okay," Harry said quickly. "Ron, it's okay, really. Just another good prank by Fred and George, that's all. I'll go to McGonagall tomorrow and have her switch the class for Muggle Studies. No harm done."
"I've lost my taste for cockroach, I'm afraid," Albus Dumbledore explained, tucking the cloak under one arm as he reached the other down to Harry. "A rather unfortunate side effect of sharing a cave with a whole colony of them."
Lavender squeaked indignantly. Neville hung his flushed head and gathered his things to sit next to an obviously displeased Lavender. Harry imagined one of the other girls in class reacting similarly when their names were called together and felt his ears burn.
Parvati Patil's perfectly executed carrying whisper, entirely unique to teenage girls, flew over the Gryffindor table the next morning like a very annoying bird.
Harry stared at the other boy in mute shock for several seconds before voicing his thoughts. "You insulted my friends, made fun of my parents, and tried to get me expelled or possibly even killed because I hurt your feelings when we were eleven?"
"Who-"
"So, Potter, you fantasize about doing it in my bed?"
"I am Professor Mason, and I will be your Sex Magic instructor. The class consists of one semester of classroom work and another of independent study, at the end of which you will complete and submit your final projects for my approval. I'm sure many of you are surprised by the briefness of the classroom component, given its content, but this is not a subject that requires much study. It is unique to each person, and therefore lengthy discussions of the theory behind it when they may or may not apply to you are frivolous. Much of the class will be spent in practical applications of the concepts you'll learn in the first few sessions."
Harry moaned, his eyes falling shut again as he arched into Draco's touch. He hadn't known until then that a smirk could be delivered telepathically, but he was learning much in this class.
Darkened gray eyes stared up at him, and the look in them was something that Harry had never seen before. Hatred, amusement, mocking disdain... Those were looks that he was used to getting from Malfoy. This wild, intense look of hunger and anticipation was new, and exciting.
"It's silly," he said dismissively. "It'll just end up in the growing pile of my ideas that Sprout tosses out."
When he turned to give her his best disapproving glare, however, she'd moved on, and Neville was looking at him strangely.
“No Harry, first the tree, then some late lunch-”
I to interrupt you, but you yourself explicitly told me that you need the results for the Jasper-case the second I got them, so here I am," Draco replied, not getting riled up about Harry's stupid behaviour.
You, of course are unable to refuse the order, so you listen to the filthy noise that is only making it too obvious how slow your hand is moving. Dissatisfactory, but at the same time making you long for more. Some part of you is unable to believe the way you are acting, but that part does not matter. All that matters is this lust and want, and the fulfilment of both.
"Slowly, I want you to lose your mind slowly, until lust is all you feel, and all you are," Draco says and so the spell slows down the movement.
But what Draco truly was for Harry was heart and home. Just seeing him, being with him; and it didn’t hurt that they were both still as insatiable for each other as they had been the day of their very first kiss.
"What? So we're boyfriends, now?" Draco interrupted. His voice was high, and his cheeks were beginning to tinge pink. "I'm supposed to give up my future because I've snogged the Boy Who Lived a few times?"
"Once you have determined who is doing what, please move to your booths and begin the lesson." She dismissed them with a nod of her head, and turned to sit at her desk.
"Yeah," Harry said. "That was really helpful when I told her, as well. Thanks, Hermione."
Not only was Harry a virgin, he'd only ever kissed one girl. And that single kiss with Cho had been embarrassing, not to mention highly unenjoyable. After that singularly horrible experience he hadn't been very inclined to go searching for a girlfriend. Harry hadn't even really given sex that much thought. With schoolwork, Quidditch and trying to avoid the seemingly endless attempts on his life, he'd been extraordinarily busy these past six years.
"Not yet," said Harry, unable to resist.
"I. Said. Let. Go!" Draco shouted, punctuating each word with a shove against Harry's chest.
Harry's eyes went wide with malicious glee. "You do, don't you?"
"How did it go?"
Harry gaped at the closed curtain for several moments after she had left until the pull of the Veritaserum began to take effect. Gritting his teeth he glanced up through his bangs to see Malfoy staring at him intently.
Draco swept out the door, sending a venomous glare at Harry on his way out.
Harry paused, twirling the drumstick between his fingers, before asking a question of his own. "Have you had a lemon drop recently, Hermione?"
"I told you-"
"Today I'll be going over the first chapter in the text. I want you all to pay attention and ask questions freely. There is no need for notes, however while I speak I want you to hold hands with your partner."
"...we'll begin. Today we'll be sorting you into groups of two. These will be your partners that you'll maintain for the rest of the semester."
"Not what?" Harry asked, genuinely confused.
"Uh, Harry?"
"Regardless, Mr. Potter, you are irrevocably enrolled in this class. Have a nice day."
"All right, then."
"That good, huh?" she asked, grinning.
"Yes," he said, looking Harry in the eye.
Understanding dawned slowly, and when it did Harry drew a sharp, shaky breath. Draco.
Lavender waved a hand imperiously, dismissing his humbleness. "Those other remedies either don't work very well, or don't work at all. And the charms are either too difficult or leave side effects of their own. This sounds like it might actually work."
Across the table, Hermione smiled. "Remind me to ask Neville what he did to knock some sense into that girl's head."
"I gave them one of the letters Harry had written me this summer. They said that they needed his signature. I asked them what for, but they only said not to worry, that they were going to help Harry get a girlfriend. I never thought they'd go this far, though!"
"Malfoy, supper. You coming?"
Draco was shaking like a leaf under Harry. Harry's fingers lay tantalizingly close to the tip of the his erection, and Harry could feel that the moment rested on a knife's edge. Yet, true to Gryffindor form, he played precisely the worst card possible.
"We'll fail it together, then," Harry groaned, passing a hand over his weary eyes.
He heard Dumbledore take a deep breath and winced, not knowing if he was prepared to hear the sound of his sickly voice again- or what it would say.
"My point is, Harry, that forcing you to have sex when you don't want to is rape." Hermione continued doggedly. "We'll go to McGonagall right now and get this straightened out."
"Yet despite that," Neville continued, leaning toward her.
A loud crack echoed through the room as Hermione's books dropped to the floor.
"Over what?" he asked, even though he knew.
"You want me to make you come?" Harry continued, taking care to make sure he had Draco's complete attention.
She waited a moment to make sure that they would start on their own, and predictably, they did not.
"Thank Merlin!" Malfoy sighed from behind him.
Pushing Harry away, he scrambled back onto his hindquarters, squatting awkwardly on the arm of the sofa.
Harry felt the ground begin to shift underneath his feet as he stood up. McGonagall took one look at him and sighed again.
Harry looked over at Malfoy to see him staring at a spot on the desk in front of him, a muscle in his jaw twitching. Another five seconds stretched before the blond slowly brought a pale hand to rest on the bench between them. Feeling his gut twist unsettlingly, Harry drew his right hand out from under him and inched it along towards Malfoy's. When his fingers had barely come into contact with the back of the Slytherin's hand, he stopped.
"Read the note," he told him, jerking his head toward the front of the room.
"Look, I don't like this, either, but we have to do it and we might as well be comfortable."
"I'm not gay," he told the thin air for the sixth time. "Maybe Ron's gay. He was so interested in knowing what kissing Malfoy was like..."
Draco made a muffled, 'mmph!' sound against Harry's mouth as he came. Harry continued to pump him slowly, until the last of the pulses died out and Draco slumped back against the wall bonelessly. Harry pulled his hand out of the front of Draco's trousers, taking his wand from his pocket and using it to spell his hand and then the inside of Malfoy's trousers clean. Draco mumbled something that could have been thanks, and reached for his wand in Harry's pajama pocket. Harry thought briefly about stopping him; envisioned himself catching Draco's hand and pulling him forward for a kiss. But instead, he simply let the other boy pluck his wand from his pocket and took a few steps back, giving Draco space.
Sighing, she rubbed her forehead with her thumb and index finger and returned her attention to assessing the day's lesson. She had noticed quite a bit of pink energy coming from the Longbottom and Brown booth... She smiled. Those two would prove to be quite the match; not so much in power, but in true compatibility.
"Soon!" Draco choked in reply, and Harry snickered into his shoulder.
Malfoy gasped, drawing back to flatten himself against the wall. "Back off!"
"As I'm sure you're well aware," Mason went on. "Your own participation in this class will differ somewhat from the other students. I've prepared for you a small handbook with all the information you'll need to know. It is requiredreading, do you understand? I will not have you hurting one another because you're too proud to learn how to do things properly."
Ron made a disgusted noise and Harry heard the muted thud of a book falling heavily shut.
"Yeah, so, how did that go? You know, with Malfoy?"
Harry sighed and took the vial, letting the drops splatter onto his tongue. Reaching out, he set it back on the table and at Mason's nod, watched as Malfoy copied him.
"Gay?" Neville asked quietly, the fingers holding the tip of his quill twitching.
"I'm afraid so."
"It's time, boys," Mason told them, glancing at the clock as she held back the curtain to their booth. "You don't have long, as I have an engagement this evening. In you go."
Harry felt Malfoy's mouth open under his and dived in. Draco made a tiny whimpering noise in his throat and pulled Harry firmly down on top of him. Harry let his trembling arms give out and settled eagerly onto the warm body beneath him, one leg between Malfoy's and the other knee dug into the cushions of the couch. Malfoy arched into him and he groaned, deepening the kiss and thrusting his tongue rhythmically into the warmth of the Slytherin's mouth. Malfoy's hands clenched over his ribcage and his left leg rose to straddle one side of Harry's hips...
"Cuddling."
"G'night, Neville," he returned, flipping over onto his back and removing his glasses. Kicking off his shoes and stripping down to his underpants, he let out a sigh, relieved that his earlier problem had diminished. Enough for him to sleep without wanking, anyway, and that was just fine by Harry. He really hadn't been looking forward to wanking off over Draco Malfoy.
Harry immediately shut his mouth with an audible snap. The Veritaserum, however, deemed it necessary to answer both honestly and fully, and he found himself drawing a deep breath to finish.
"I know. It's okay," Harry told him, bringing his hands down to grasp Malfoy's hips. "You just startled me."
"So what if I am?" the blonde girl asked, tilting her chin up defiantly.
Harry followed, going over in his mind every possible scenario he'd imagined for today. Malfoy resentfully giving him a handjob while Harry grinned smugly at him... Himself giving Malfoy another handjob while the other boy gasped and pleaded...
"You'll at least have to go the first day," she told Harry.
Harry watched as Malfoy nodded and left the room. The blond's shoulders weren't as straight as they usually were and his head was slightly bowed. Harry felt something indescribable tug at him at the display of obvious humiliation.
When Malfoy's movements became distracting, Harry sighed and turned to one side so that he could get his arms around the other boy's torso. Malfoy startled violently as Harry pulled him around so that his back was pressed against his chest. Harry leaned down so that his mouth was right next to his ear and whispered.
"Fine by me, Weaselbee," he shouted back.
Easier because when you come here, step out of that fireplace and feel the spell settle upon you, it is effortless to do what he says, to follow his lead, to obey his every command.
Yes, this does fill the need to be out of control, but there is also this ache which stops hurting when you are the focus of his attention. You don't mind that that he doesn't feel the same, that for him it is only wanting you, but hardly the way you want him. This way it is safe, this way it can go on forever without becoming complicated, without becoming dangerous. Sometimes you just have weak moments when you realise that he never undresses for you, never is naked with you and you wish he were. You wish to see him, so that you can fantasise even more. But those things only matter in the back of your mind and are only heard in weak moments when you wish for impossible things.
"He should focus on other leads and leave the in-house work to me. That is, after all, the rule I set up with his team," Harry fumes.
And then the worst of the worst: Parker came along. Somehow, Draco took an easy shine to him. It has angered Harry for nearly eight months now. Usually he is very careful to not put Parker on any potion-related cases, but this time it was unavoidable.
"Why don't you make it more interesting for me, and take what you really want?"
Draco was also very hard to get to agree to a change of plans. Not that Harry minded that too much.
It’s one of the reasons why you don’t have eyes for anyone else but him. Nobody is able to affect your mood like he is.
The grin Draco threw in his direction made Harry’s heart speed up.
"You do realise that I am allowed to talk to people about things other than work right?"
“I seem to recall last year, beneath the tree in the gleam of the fairy lights… you know I would like to do that again.” Harry grinned pulling Draco’s hand up to his mouth to kiss it hungrily, letting his tongue caress the knuckle.
Your body moves in rhythm to the pushes and takes you along on the ride. Your muscle relaxes easily and soon your moans go from satisfied to needy again.
The silence that follows is torture and you wish you could make out Draco's face, but you can't.
“I love you too,” Draco replied softly. “But we will still be putting up the tree first,” he said after he had stolen a quick, sweet kiss from Harry’s lips.
"What is that supposed to mean? We-"
It has been working, though for the last few years he has noticed himself getting more and more annoyed at all the other people getting along with Draco so easily. They have no right to! After all, Harry has to work hard for every bit of attention he gets and they somehow manage to get it without ever putting any effort in or acknowledging Draco for who he really is.
Softly, Harry leaned closer and brushed a kiss against Draco’s temple before he moved back again to caress Draco’s body. The pregnancy was neither planned nor wanted. They both still struggled with the thought of having a child, of giving up what they had together, making room for someone else. But at least he felt a bit of joy and excitement. He saw it as a new adventure, and a family of his own - he had at least always wanted that.
But the both of you are determined to make yourselves and each other unhappy, and right now, as you are looking into those expansive eyes, you can't figure out why things are the way they are.
A surprised sound escapes your lips as you feel the cold gel beneath your fingertips yet again, but this time it feels a hundred times colder.
"I believe the annual Ministry Yule Ball is in two weeks. After six years of you nearly asking, I am tired of waiting. If you are not going to ask me, I will go with Hilton from the Obliviators," Draco threatened.
"Shut it, Potter," Draco snapped. "This is new for me, all right? But judging from your performance last night, I'd say you were a regular pouf."
Which meant that as much as Harry wanted to know what Draco was doing on the other side, Draco must not want Harry to know even more.
"What do I care?" Draco sneered, and shrugged.
"Harry! Neville!"
"Which Deputy Headmistress McGonagall turned you down for," she interrupted smoothly.
"Fine," Harry shrugged, and plucked his own wand from the table. "Expelliarmus!"
"We're not supposed to," he said breathlessly.
"What, exactly, did you do to help those brothers of yours?"
Neville clenched his jaw and hesitated only a moment before following.
Palm slickened, Draco moved his hand faster over the shaft, occasionally making sure to slip his thumb over the head. Harry panted, hips moving ever so slightly in time with Draco's pulls. Feeling the tingle begin at the base of his spine, he let go of Draco's wrist and threw both arms above his head, gripping the end of the sofa. Draco instinctively sped up, gripping just that tiny bit tighter that would send Harry over the edge.
"Come with me, Harry," Dumbledore told him. "I'm sure we have much to talk about."
"What are you-?" Draco began to ask, only to fall quiet when Harry drew his hand away to weave their fingers together. He cleared his throat and swallowed. "Don't go getting queer, Potter."
"Oh, yeah," Ron nodded enthusiastically, making a face. "Disgusting. Right. But, Harry?"
"How's that going?" Hermione asked cautiously.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. Malfoy was such a terrible liar. "And started with ours? I'm not convinced."
"Shut up!" Harry roared. "Just shut it, will you? I'm sick of being used! I'm tired of playing the predictable, reliable buffoon! He can shape me and mold me into whatever weapon he pleases, and I'll think it was me the whole time! I'll think it's real when it's not!"
"Sit down?" Draco parroted, his eyes flitting to the sofa and then back to Harry.
Harry hugged the translucent material of his cloak tighter across his chest, though his muttering made being invisible rather pointless.
With a wave, Ron departed, choosing the hallway to their left. Harry glanced between the remaining two, and started down the one leading to the stairs. He supposed that mindlessly browsing the armor gallery might help him to think.
"Ah, good. All present, no tardies. Just what I like to see. Well then, first things first," she said, closing her eyes briefly. Harry wondered what she was doing until he remembered where he was and immediately began looking around the room for changes. "There. You'll find that you're all now sitting on benches, instead of individual chairs. I find that works better for today's lesson."
Harry snorted a quiet laugh and watched as the Headmaster rose slowly, wincing at a pain that Harry could only guess at, and made his way around the desk to stand before him.
If possible, Draco blushed further, realizing how much his reaction had given away. "Oh," he said quietly. "Yeah. That was it."
When Malfoy's mouth worked silently for a moment, and the blond's eyes strayed to where Harry held his wand with a look of desperation, Harry knew that he'd won. He took the final step closer that brought him chest to chest with the other boy.
Rounding the corner, he glanced briefly at the stone gargoyle guarding the Headmaster's office. He'd passed it often during his late night strolls over the past year and a half, and his eyes were always drawn to the cobwebs gathered at the base where it met the false wall behind it. They never failed to cause a brief pang in his gut- the disuse of the Headmaster's office somehow depressing to him even though he hadn't forgiven the man for the events of Fifth Year. But time eased all manner of wounds, and his bitterness towards the old man had faded considerably since then.
"You've run this little freak show up until now, and until now I've let you because I didn't want to participate," he began cooly. "If I did, then it would say something about me that isn't what I'd like or even entirely true. I don't like boys."
The tear-stained blonde wailed even louder and Parvati sent a glare over her shoulder before attempting to shush her friend. "She's right, you know, Lavender," she said encouragingly. "You could be worse off. You could be in Harry's shoes right now."
"More?"
"Liar," Harry breathed. "You were here hoping I'd show up, weren't you?"
"Yeah," Parvati grinned nastily, and sent Hermione a smug look. "He got stuck with Draco Malfoy."
Harry read the intriguing - and rather sexist, in his opinion - subtitle of the Witch Weekly article again. Glancing furtively at the closed curtains around his bed, he tentatively poked at them with his wand to ensure that the locking charm was still in effect. Surely enough, they resisted the gentle nudge with the tenacity of marble. Feeling slightly better now that he knew that Ron wouldn't be throwing open the curtains anytime soon, Harry read on.
Draco's eyes flickered from side to side, attempting to read something in Harry's face. Harry held perfectly still, waiting for some sign to continue. Finally, Draco out a shaky sigh, lurched up and pressed his lips to Harry's again.
Only then did Harry give in to the demand in his knees, and sat. Dumbledore turned back round to face him and Harry forced himself to look, to see the damage done to the man in front of him, and to feel grateful for it.
Harry's expression went dark and he noted Draco's look of surprise when he turned around to face him.
Hermione sighed, her mouth turning down at the edges. Harry knew the lecture by heart. Hermione wanted Harry to go to university, but Harry and Ron both wanted to become Aurors. Hermione was leaving to attend the School of Advanced Arithmatic and Runic Learning in Greece next year. She and Ron had had a great row that lasted half the summer about her moving so far away. Ron had reluctantly backed down in the end, but Harry knew it still bothered him.
He didn't need to be looking at Malfoy to know that a grin was spreading on his smug face, nor to feel the hand sliding slowly along his waist. Fingers dipped below his beltline and Harry gasped and closed his eyes. The bed shifted, and Harry heard the sigh of sheets as Draco moved closer. His jeans were unbuttoned and pushed down his hips along with his pants. Cool air rushed over his twitching and steadily growing length, and Harry swallowed as he waited for Draco's next move.
Harry continued to glare as he sat up and pushed himself off the sofa. He couldn't explain the sudden flare of angry hurt, but it made his stomach burn nonetheless.
Snatching the parchment out of Harry's nerveless fingers, she quickly scanned the page, her eyes widening.
"To be fair, we both thought that Mason would sign for you," Ron told him. "Hermione's right, though. They can't exactly force you to shag that git."
"You want to know what I think?" Harry asked, deliberately invading Malfoy's personal space and enjoying watching the other boy sweat. "I think you came in here because you wanted to. Because you couldn't help not to."
Just then the door opened to admit one more person. Harry eagerly accepted the distraction and waited for the room to change, hoping that someone might prove to have worse expectations for the class than he did, but the room stayed the same. A witch in long, loose blue robes walked to the front of the room and turned to face the class. Harry's first impression of her was that she was rather ordinary looking. She had long, slightly wavy brown hair that was pulled back from her face and tucked behind her ears. Her eyes were blue and she wore no spectacles, and she had a light amount of freckles across the bridge of her nose and cheeks. Not the sort of face that you would picture when thinking of a person skilled in the arts of... er...
Ron snorted in agreement, skimming over the notes in a hectic rustle of paper. After a while, his eyes began to dart between the pages and Harry, sneaking furtive glances at him when he thought he wasn't looking. Harry thought he knew what was on his best friend's mind, and intentionally avoided his gaze.
"Hey, Neville," Seamus grinned. "Bit of luck scoring Lavender in Sex Magic, eh? I woulda taken it, but I don't turn seventeen for another three months, and my mum wouldn't sign for me."
Rosemary Mason was lazily observing the swirling blue-green clouds above Padma Patil and Theodore Nott's booth when she heard the sound of hot, electric snapping from behind her left shoulder. Whirling around she saw what was essentially a heat lightning storm above the Potter/Malfoy booth.
"Yes," Harry responded, swallowing against a dry throat.
"Sure," Harry nodded, even though he knew Ron couldn't see.
"Once you've established your roles, it will be easier to focus on controlling your magic, rather than the situation," Professor Mason continued. "I do not wish for you to strive for any great restraint in your first sessions. We will work on bringing restraint back into the act later, once we have determined your magical compatibility and the range of your ability with your partner.
"But it wasn't bad. It was warm," he said, furiously embarrassed.
There, hovering in the air, were the words, "Sit with your assigned partner." Harry heaved a sigh and made his way back to Malfoy's table and sat down, doggedly refusing to look at the other boy. Not long after, Professor Mason entered.
