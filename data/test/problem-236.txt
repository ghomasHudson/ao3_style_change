“Then don’t eat too much,” Ron says. “You can do this, Harry.” Ron’s voice is quiet and kind. “I’ve seen the way he looks at you when you’re not paying attention. I don’t think you’re the only one with feelings.”
“I didn’t even know we had him!” Al says, offended.
“Prat,” Draco counters.
“Surrender,” Voldie commanded.
In retaliation for Harry’s cheek, Draco licked the side of his jaw and glared at him.
“Hush you two,” she admonished.
Harry screws up his nose.
There was a pause and Draco hoped Potter had given up on his quest to make Draco’s brain explode.
“Are you Apparating back to London?” Draco asked, walking towards his flat, still not looking at Potter.
"Fuck a duck," Harry whispers, after he and Ron have made it back to their desks and are drinking some tea. "How?" he wails.
“I thought this was about space,” Draco whined.
“I’ll just Levitate these for you?” Harry asked and at Draco’s nod, his trunks were bobbing towards the castle.
“Is this part of the plan?” Draco asks, leaning down to kiss Harry again.
“Off wi’ ya!” Emily slurred. “‘Ome!”
The niffler stirs and its black eyes open and scan the room.
“Huh?” Harry says mid-bite.
Draco catches Harry’s eye and smirks. “So the whole talking to me and looking at my face is a new development, Potter.”
Harry smiled and it was tinged with sadness. “Can’t have that.”
“You could sell this,” Emily said, swinging her glass.
He pulled Draco up to sitting and looked at him. They were still holding hands and Harry’s hand was warm and soft in Draco’s.
“That would be preposterous,” Draco mumbled. “Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy would kill each other before the store opened.”
The water was getting wilder and wilder and Draco was having problems keeping his head above water; he quickly became exhausted from his struggles, as Zacharias taunted him. “Do you see those tentacles?” he asked with a leer. “That’s only a tenth of the mass of one of the giant squid’s tentacles. It has the power to squeeze you dry and will surely eat the husk. So come back to the safety of the boat because I assure you, the squid will have no qualms with your destruction!” Draco shook as
, can you explain the plan to me as if I’m a small child?”
“Well, now that that’s done,” Draco said, turning to kiss Harry.
“Is this the worst idea ever?” he whispered to himself.
“Just add it to all of my other crimes,” Draco said with a sigh. “Haul me off to Azkaban, oh Saviour. Lock me up with the criminals and let me rot.”
“Hey, Harry,” Draco says as he opens the door.
Ron let out a little chuckle. “Yeah,” he agreed nodding. “But you’re especially weird right now.”
Harry has to bite back a smile. “Not like that, you tosser.”
and Harry felt a little wild. “What if he’s still…” he looked over at Rose who had wandered off to the bookcase in the corner. “What if he’s still,” he repeated, “a wanker.”
“I do still want cake.”
Harry lets out a laugh at Malfoy's expression. He's vacillating between amusement and annoyance. Finally, he makes up his mind and grins.
Draco couldn’t stop his laugh at Hermione’s face. He finally started to think they might all have a successful afternoon together.
Harry shrugged. “Haven’t a clue. Do either one of you have any suggestions?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe the two of you get on so well,” he complained.
Harry had a kind look on his face. “It doesn’t have to be everything tonight. I reckon if we get through this date and want a second, we can always delve deeper.”
“Evil mastermind,” he says between laughs. “Yeah, those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges really were your baby steps into villain-hood, weren’t they?”
Letting his eyes move to the

Ron walked over to help her stand before letting out a noise of disapproval. “You don’t look so good.” Hermione got up, clumsily, before leaning all of her weight on Ron. “Oof,” he continued, “you don’t smell so good either” Hermione rolled her eyes and let out a

“Are you forgetting the times we saved each other?” Potter asked quietly, suddenly closer. “Look, I don’t mean to dredge up the past, but it
“Ron!” she yelled as she threw herself against the door. “Ron!” she shouted again. “I need help!”
Are you coming to dinner tonight?
Finally after a few quiet moments Draco asked again, “Why?”
“Let me help then,” Emily said as she grabbed the bags of food from Potter and left him and Draco standing in the entryway.
“Get a job,” Potter said, laughing.

Harry, his hand still over Draco’s mouth, was barely holding back his laughter. He had a fond look on his face and his eyes were smiling. Draco felt lucky he had found such a lovely person after Astoria had passed.
job to find that out, Potter.”
“You know, when I hired Zacharias to kill Draco on the day we got engaged, I thought that was inspired. But now, he is even more beloved by the people, his murder on our wedding day by an agent from Surrey, will rile up the commoners and there will be no recourse but to start a war.”
Draco narrows his eyes and the crinkle around them is adorable. And
when she was angry.
Their server is quietly lurking in the office, his brown eyes troubled.
and thus, inherently better, but it was still
Bob's purring gets louder.
Molly had dropped off the top tier of their wedding cake while they were both at their respective jobs. Originally, Narcissa'd had a problem with their wedding cake not being the traditional fruit cake. Molly had quickly changed her mind with the quality of their strawberry and dark chocolate cake, Draco’s favourite flavour combination. Unlike when Draco and Astoria wed, Draco and Harry weren’t going to have children, so they had agreed to have the cake on their first anniversary instead of the christening of a new child. Draco didn’t put much stock into too many traditions, but he wasn’t going to argue with one that gave him cake.
Draco snorts at him. "Magic, Potter. Means we can get rid of the wet spot."
For all that Draco has been a recluse, his sitting room is still tidy. The furniture is clearly more of Draco’s favourite pieces from the Manor. Harry spies a pillow and blanket on the sofa that is a larger version of the loveseat in Draco’s office.
Draco rolls his eyes. “We need to go to Potter’s,” he tells his mother. “And the creature can’t Floo, so we’ll either need to Apparate or fly.”
at the floor by his feet. When the Disillusionment Charm is lifted, Harry shouts.
“Uhhhhhhh,” Harry croaks out.
Looking around at his equipment, Draco let out a sigh and settled himself in for several hours of brooding in the rain.
“Harry?” Draco asked. “Why won’t you hold me?”
Gin got you last year?” Ron leers.
Draco frowned at him. “What was that?”
Moving in to nuzzle Draco, Harry whispers, “Things are a lot different this year, aren’t they?”
“So would you like to explore more on your own?” Harry asked. “Hermione did relent and expanded your closet.”
“Ronald!” Hermione said, walking in with Hugo on her hip. “What have you taught our daughter?”
“Let’s go somewhere else,” Draco said. “I don’t want everyone looking at me.”
“You can barely hold one,” Hermione said, quite sensibly.
Harry couldn’t hear the rest of what Ron said after that. Hugo’s shrieks of laughter were too loud.
Harry’s calling the store Malfoy’s Menagerie
“Wha?” he asks, intelligently.
Harry sighed. “I’m glad my life is so amusing.” But he couldn’t stop his answering smile. “He was decent when I saw him at Hogwarts. Not nearly as much of a prat.” Then, he couldn’t help himself and added, “Even if it did rain
“Just show me, Potter,” Draco said.
Draco was thankful Harry had volunteered all of his resources when they had pooled their funds and signed all of the licenses. He insisted everyone was on retainer so there wouldn't be an additional fee and Draco
“What?” Draco shrieked. “We’re only business partners.”
“Oh, don’t be like that,” Emily said. “Harry’s only just got here.”
“You know,” Emily said. “When you both said you could open in a couple of weeks, I didn’t believe either one of you.” Emily nodded at him, gesturing to the store that had more than half of its stock displayed. “But…”
. “Potter wants to call our shop
The man in black looked up and down the giant’s body, taking in his oversized muscles and their incredible difference in height.
Draco nodded. “Perfect.” He nodded to his mum and Mrs Weasley. “Better go home with them before they get up to no good.”
Harry scribbles a note, folding it and sending it to Ron before looking at Draco again. “So the case is solved?” he asks. “Seems a bit—anticlimactic if I’m being honest.”
. There have been rumours that someone is plotting to murder my Draco on the evening of our wedding. This cannot come to pass.”
and sends Penelope back to Potter.
“What else did you think we might do?” Harry asked, clearly amused at Draco’s thought process.
Hermione was struggling on the floor, hand pressed over her wound, vision blurring. She tried to stand.
“You tried it on and everybody ogled,” Ron reiterates. “I thought Charlie’s eyes were gonna pop out of his head.
“Fine, fine,” Draco said.
helped out with setting up corporate accounts for mass produced Muggle goods, and Harry sent their money off to all of the vendors. He had an accountant along with his solicitor, and they were taking care of all of the financials so Draco could focus more on the creative side of opening the store.
They walked to it, hand in hand and Draco felt his eyes swell with tears.
. Also he is, perhaps, winding his best friend up a smidge. He’s hoping for a goodnight kiss after dinner and maybe plans for a second date. But he knows Ron will only poke and meddle more if Harry shares his schmoopy feelings.
and Draco Malfoy?” Potter asked.
for that. It would help if you were doing it for some noble cause.”
“Now you just need to get the boy,” Emily said and then she took a loud gulp from her cup. “You called him
Harry looks at Draco and notices his shoulders aren’t as stiff as they have been.
“When’s the last time you ate?” Harry demands, apparently not able to control his brain-to-mouth filter.
“Plan your date another time, Harry,” she said, but not unkindly. “We need to get the kids to bed.”
Potter laughed again. He laughed and, even in the dark, Draco could see the brightness of his smile and how the corners of his eyes crinkled.
The man in black looked up in surprise. “I’m climbing up a straight cliff!” he spat out. “I would like to see you do any better!” He made his way up another metre before stopping. “If you’re in that much of a hurry, you could lower a rope or a branch or something.”
“I’m you,” almost-but-not-quite Draco says. “And you can stop calling me ‘almost-but-not-quite Draco’ in your head.”
“What?” cried Draco. “Is my suffering
doesn't happen for a while. Ron and he solve the case, ("
“The worst thing is that I can’t really see you,” Draco admits.
Ronald laughed. “I don’t even lift. I was just born this way. ‘S not my fault.” The man in black grunted as he pushed himself away from the giant. Ron stalked forward and swung his arm, but the man in black ducked quickly and avoided being hit. Ron frowned. “You’re fast,” he admitted.
Changing tactics, Ron asks, “Do you know what you’re going to wear?”
“Will you leave before you start a fire?” Emily asked, breaking their spell.
“I’m sorry today is so hard,” Harry says, joining Draco on the sofa and pulling him close.
Rolling off of Harry, Draco let out a laugh. “Well I’m certainly not cold anymore,” he said.
that Charlie had found a couple of years ago.
This time, Harry bucked his hips up and Draco’s hips met the meat of his arse.
“Thank you for this, Potter,” Draco says with a soft smile. “I would have been in my head all night if I had gone home. Today was— it wasn’t my best day ever.”
After a few more minutes of climbing, Draco felt the angle at which he was being carried, changed. He opened his eyes and realized they had finally reached the top of the cliff and Ron was pulling them all up to solid ground.
Draco pulled the pillow tighter over his head.
Lifting up his head to glare at Harry, Draco says, “
“You said a swear!” Scorpius shouts from the door.
“Well!” Emily said, pushing Harry out of the booth, startling them both. “I forgot! I’ve got to meet—” she looked around the café— “Stella.”
“But why?”
“Harry, it’s fine,” Draco said, his voice cracking. “I haven’t forgiven myself for…”
Frowning, Draco said, “You said that about the tea too. And it’s rubbish.”
He smiled and held up two brooms. “I found these!” he said proudly. “I was wandering around and found Voldie’s broom shed and grabbed them! I thought if we found Draco,” he looked up and saw that Draco and Harry had joined Hermione at the window, “hello Draco! But if we ever found him, then Harry and Draco could share one and you and I could share one.”
Blaise nodded. “I guess that’s the sixth reason you put up with me. Someone has to keep all the scary mums at bay when you’re around.”
“All of the staircases look the same!” Draco insisted.
“That’s an undetectable extension charm,” Draco insisted.
Draco makes his way to the largest sofa and settles in, tucking his legs under him.
“What do nifflers even eat?” Draco asks.
Draco stops petting Bob and looks up at Harry with a frown. “That is categorically untrue.”
Harry sits back on, resting his arse on his heels. “Do you want me to drag this out or get you ready so I can be inside you?”
“Maybe I like trying new things,” Harry said.
Ron looked over and rolled his eyes. “I heard you, Harry. But you are sort of obsessed with Malfoy.”
Emily and Stella had some intense eye contact and Draco let out a little snort. “Keep it in your pants ladies.”
“Those turned up in Muggle charity shops,” Harry says, watching every twitch of Draco’s face for an idea about what he’s thinking. “Thankfully, the staff had decided they were too scary to sell and had binned them. When the staff threw them into the bin they spontaneously caught fire. After the staff had put the fires out, the toys seemed exactly the same. That’s when they called their police and then the Auror liaison got in touch with us.”
happy, Harry,” he says. “I didn’t realise how happy I could be until I was adopted into this large, mad family.” He pauses to think of how to say what he wants in a way that won’t hurt Harry’s feelings.
“Quit being a prat, Draco,” Ginny says. “You can’t give him away, he’s family.”
“And your eyes are the colour of a foggy morn’ after the rain,” Harry tells him. “So lucky to have you as my husband.” Then he launches himself at Draco and pulls him into a full-body hug. “Love you,” he murmurs into Draco’s neck.
Harry looked up at him and smiled. “Or you could move.”
“There’s nothing more to tell, really,” Potter said with a sigh.
Ron shrugs. “He is,” he agrees. “You're still drooling.”
Harry searches Draco’s face, notices the purple almost-bruises under his eyes; the grey cast to his pale skin; the oily build-up in his hair; the hesitant way he’s holding himself.
“Thanks, Harry.”
"I have no idea what to do with these,” Draco admitted.
After a few moments of writhing under Draco, Harry had enough.
“What?” she started, but Voldie ignored her and turned on Harry who was still bound and gagged.
Hermione nods and looks at Harry in question. He shakes his head a little, appreciating the fact that she would give him an out.
“You’re such a prat,” he says, pulling Draco into a kiss.
Draco glared at her.
“I’m not up to
“No, just Emily,” Draco answered.
Draco took Blaise in, from the top of his tightly curled hair, past his broad shoulders and narrow waist, down his long legs, then back to the slight bulge of his cock and thought. He considered the warmth of Blaise’s dark skin, his blinding smile, the little lines that were starting to show around his eyes, how his cologne smelled like old money and sex. Then he wrinkled his nose.
“Boo,” the crone repeated. “Your love lives while you’re married to another. He saved you from bandits and the Forbidden Forest and you threw him away like rubbish.” She sneered at him. “Bow down,” she said to the people around her. “Bow down to the prince of trash; the prince of dirt; the prince of refuse. Bow down,” she taunted. “Bow!”
Three years passed. Draco still filled his days flying and taking care of his family home. With the inheritance from Harry's death, his farm had been saved. However, none of it made him happy. True to his word, he never found love again. He was no longer in constant mourning for Harry; it was more of a dull ache as opposed to a big, gaping wound, but he had hardened his heart. Despite that, he found himself engaged to be married to the heir to the throne of Wiltshire, Prince Voldie.
Harry powers on, “Alco—”
Ron’s eyes were big as he said, “Guess not long,” to Hermione.
“Muggle plumbing,” he groans to himself. But he’s able to quickly wash himself off and sets a Hot Air Charm all over himself to dry. The spell always leaves his hair really wild, but no wilder than letting it air dry and besides, Malfoy has been aware of Harry’s hair for forever so it’s not like changing that aspect of himself will win Malfoy over.
“It doesn’t exclude it.”
Draco’s eyes search Harry’s face, and he must find what he’s looking for because he turns and lets Harry into his office. Harry gently closes the door and looks around.
She nods and gently hands the black and orange bundle back to Scorpius.
"I'm not going to last," Draco admits.
He preens and Harry files the look on his face under
“Malfoy!” he half-shouted.
“However, I think Rose and Scorpius have already made plans for next weekend. And Blaise is currently abroad with his business and Pansy’s been in France since she got married so yes, I would be alone.” He smirked at Harry and Harry’s heart felt like it skipped a beat. “I supposed it would be tolerable to spend the afternoon with you.”
“Oh, you’re tetchy,” Ron teases. “Must not have gotten too lucky then.”
Harry ignored her pointed stare.
over Draco and walked over to take his hand in hers. Her hand was wet and cold from the deluge, but still comforting. She looked at Draco and gave his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“Arsehole,” Draco groans out. “Yes, two.”
“Where can I take him?” he asks in a rush. “If this is a date AND a birthday dinner, I need somewhere special!”
“Just got word from Mungo’s that the little girl is fine and going to be released tomorrow,” Ron says with satisfaction. “Go look at your clown, Malfoy.”
He’s almost reverent when he kisses Draco. His lips are so soft and gentle, and the almost-there flicks of his tongue are making Draco yearn for more. Draco can feel Harry’s cock, hot and hard against his hip, and when Harry bites the tip of Draco’s tongue, he realises he’s relaxed and there’s no hint of a burn.
“Oh!” Harry gasped. “That feels so…”
“I’m not going to dignify that with an answer,” Harry says, trying to capture Draco’s mouth again but only succeeding in licking his nose.
“If you insist,” Draco said as he followed Harry into the forest. He held tight to Harry’s hand.
“Where the bloody hell did you come from?” he shrieked. “And don’t you have a job?”
i know
“I’ll Heal it,” Harry reassures Draco.
“Arachnids of Unusual Sizes?” Harry raised his eyebrows and smiled reassuringly. “I don’t think they exist.” He motioned for Draco to continue on their path, but then, as if it had appeared from thin air, an Acromantula attacked Harry, sending him to the ground.
“That room is as cold as a fucking crypt,” Draco said, moving close to Harry. “I refuse to sleep in there.”
Ron starts wheezing. At first, Harry’s concerned, but he eventually realises Ron’s actually laughing.
“Dad!” Scorpius shouted from his room. “Do you think Rose will like my mini We-Be’s kit?”
Harry lets out a groan. “Not helping, Ron.” Feeling a smile overtake his face, Harry starts giggling. “You’re turning into your mother, did you know?”
“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said from his corner.
Draco didn’t even try to fight his smile. “He’s everything that’s wonderful about eight-years-old with all of the areshole moments.”
“The Chamber or Secrets,” the rat-like man said. "I am its caretaker, Wormtail." He looked down at Harry and tightened the straps around his chest. “Don’t even try to escape.”
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry taunted.
“That was enough to take a year off of your life,” continued Bellatrix. “Tell me,” she pauses and looks at Harry, cold and detached from Harry's suffering. “How do you feel? And remember, be honest.”
heat if we get naked,” Draco said conversationally, like he hadn’t just made real most of Harry’s wanking fantasies.
Draco’s hair is pulled half up and it looks like there’s a little braid on the left side of his head. He's wearing a pair of skintight, white jeans and his usual white shirt and a fitted cornflower blue blazer. The colours should wash him out, afterall Draco is plenty colourless on his own, but somehow the blue of the jacket makes his eyes sparkle and his cheeks rosy. Plus the tight white pants leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. Harry feels his mouth water as he gawks at the sight and he’s momentarily unable to move.
Harry Potter?” Emily asked. “He checked in as James Evans.”
She held up a hand, easily silencing Draco’s imminent apology. “Mr Malfoy, there’s nothing to apologise for. Magic can be fickle. Especially magic that’s as delicate as yours. We have contracted your business, how many times?”
“Of course,” Draco agreed, unthinking.
“Is there a big difference?” asked the man in black, conversationally, while weaving around the giant.
However, he does hold his breath for a second, but Draco nods and says, “Yes, Potter. That would be agreeable.” Then he Vanishes Harry’s dirty plate and fork.
Harry,
actual husband
There, checking out of the inn, was Harry Potter: Saviour of the Wizarding World; the Boy Who Lived; Defeator of the Dark Lord.
Solemnly, she shrunk down all of the items she purchased and picked up the carrier.
“Can I get under the covers?” Harry asked in a small voice. “I feel exposed if I’m like this and we’re going to ‘chat’.”
“I told you it was a date!” Emily hissed at him. She got up and went to Harry’s side, picked up a bag— clearly a gift— and glared at Draco. “He bought you something!”
,” he said menacingly. “You and Draco might have been that one lucky couple in an age who really and truly had
“We can’t do much when you're still half dressed, Potter,” Draco says, a bit petulant.
to put out the flames before pivoting and shouting
Draco considered the name. “I don’t hate it,” he admitted. “But what the fuck is a Falkor?”
Malfoy turns sharply to look at Harry. “I wouldn’t say a lot, Potter. Don’t worry, I won’t break up the Golden—”
Harry looked to Ron who was beaming at his mum. “I’m not dating Malfoy just because you all like him,” he grumbled.
“He bested Hermione!” he shouted. “Inconceivable!” He looked frantically at Ron and Draco. “You!” he shouted, pointing at Ron. “He may have won against Hermione in a duel, but he won’t be able to beat your strength!”
“Ah,” Ginny says, coming up to their booth. “You’ve got your eye on Pud U’s Keeper.” She winks at Harry and mouths
,” Draco repeated in a weird voice.
Harry does risk a glance up at Malfoy's face at that, but has to promptly look down at the stitching around Malfoy's ankles again because Harry can feel his face heat.
, so he looked back at the counter, feigning interest in the wood grain.
Harry struggled to keep his face neutral. He must not have been successful if Ginny’s glare was any indicator.
“I like my mum,” Ron answers, still smiling. “I do have good news though. Well, good maybe only for you, bad news, generally speaking for the Wizarding World at large. But in this one case, it’s really a mixed—”
“That’s gross, mate,” Ron said, joining them in Draco’s corner.
Harry laughed and got out as Draco followed. They stood and stared.
“Well, if you’re both rich and retired—” he was cut off as he was suddenly sucked into a Man-Eating Bog, something he thought was only legend.
Draco watches Harry undress with big eyes. Then it’s as if he’s just realised what Harry says and he shakes his head a little. “You knew I was bossy when you fell in love with me, Potter.”
“You were singing!” Harry says indignantly.
“You have a lovely home,” Draco says.
“No, it’s not,” almost-but-not-quite Draco says.
“Hurts,” Draco says in a small voice.
“I got married,” Draco admitted with a frown.
With a snort, Harry pulled Draco into an embrace. “Keep telling yourself that, dear,” he whispered. “But you’re really as soft and gooey as a marshmallow. You should see your face when you talk about Scorpius.”
Harry frowns at being demoted from ‘Harry’ to ‘Potter’.
charmed by the way it made his face crinkle up.
“Drama llama,” Emily whispered, winking at Potter.
“No you prat,” Malfoy answers with a smirk. “It’s merely a horrific children’s toy that somehow got cursed half a dozen times.” He takes a drink of his wine. “It
“Ugh,” Draco answers.
“Tell me about Weather-Be’s,” Hermione implored, obviously seeing his discomfort. “Luna says it’s amazing.”
Harry scratches the back of his neck. “We, uh, already had a little kiss,” he admits.
“Inconceivable!” Zacharias shouted. “Ronald, how could this happen? You’re supposed to be this great wizard, strong as Gryffindor himself and yet that scoundrel is catching up!”
“Please...Harry?” Draco asks.
Harry finally finishes and loses all the strength in his arms. He's over-sensitive, but meets Draco's thrusts head on. Draco's fingers are digging bruises into Harry's hips and there's literally nothing better than the slight pain from Draco's fingers and cock. He's still riding the high of his orgasm so nothing is truly painful. But—
Ron nodded and the man in black jumped on his back, pulling his arm taut against Ron’s throat, working to cut off his air supply. “Different strategies,” he panted then pushed himself back to knock the man in black against a nearby boulder. “Different strategies,” he repeated, “when it’s only one man.”
More surprising was the realisation that Draco loved him in return.
Scorpius smiles at Harry and even though he’s a cock-blocking teenager, Harry feels an answering smile cross his face at Scorpius’ obvious joy.
“It’s not too bad,” Harry said, after looking at the trees and plants surrounding them. “Nice and quiet.” Draco frowned at him. “I’m not saying we should build a cottage!” Harry insisted. “It just seems like its reputation isn’t very accurate.”
“Don’t be gross!” Emily exclaimed.
“Still monosyllabic!” Harry declares, delighted.
Hermione’s reply was cut off as she was lifted up by Ron’s magic, but Harry could see she was thinking about it as she floated towards the ground.
Draco rolled off Harry, panting and covered slightly in sweat.
Kreacher waved his spindly arms and Draco’s room was suddenly warm and cozy. Without a backwards glance, Kreacher Disapparated.
“I’m not used to such a tight shirt,” Harry says.
“Merlin, Dad,” Al says. “He’s my age and Mr Malfoy is more uptight than you are.”
“Draco, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Harry grabs Draco’s arm, to try and keep him from offending someone with all of his
He pushed Potter out of the booth and glared at him when they were both standing.
“Of course I am!” Zacharias yelled. “I’m going to—” he pointed to a spot behind the man in black. “Is that an Erumpent?” he cried. The man in black twisted his body to look at what Zacharias was pointing at, while Zacharias quickly swapped the goblets of wine. When the man in black turned back, he had a confused look on his face. “Maybe it was just a low cloud,” Zacharias said in a dismissive tone. “However, it is time to end this.” He picked up his goblet as Draco looked at the man in black in horror. “I'll drink the wine in front of me and let you drink the wine in front of you.”
"Well clearly they've never been in bed with you," he replies in a breathless voice. "Because—
Harry snuggles into Draco, breathing in the sharp citrus of his soap. “Date works,” he agrees.
Draco let his shoulders slump. “The whole point of the business is to guarantee perfect weather,” he said.
Draco woke up with his heart in his throat. The king was still alive and he was still unwed, though the planned wedding was to happen in less than a week. He quickly put his dressing gown over his pyjamas and ran to Prince Voldie’s chambers. He was at his desk, working on businesses of state while Countess Bellatrix was lurking in the corner of the room.
, shuddering, enveloped heart and soul by Harry.
“I’ll have you know, I have changed
Draco rolled his eyes. “What do you want to know?”
“Well, it’s just that I’ve been to some of your events and it’s rained.”
“You know, we’ll conserve even
“May I?” he asks, running his hand down Draco’s buttons.
Emily brought danishes and some new clothes for Draco the next morning. She made a big deal of sniffing around the flat, making faces at the bed.
“Sorry,” he says. “I just got a little carried away.”
“Harry,” Hermione says seriously. “Two things.”
and he knew if he spent more time with Harry, their future interactions would be more amenable and one day they might actually call each other friends.
Malfoy stares at him. Ron hisses
“Quiet!” Lily hisses at him. “Don’t disturb Peanut Butter!”
Harry sent a gentle
The animal in question is curled up in Scorpius’ arms, making a weird rumbly noise. It is louder and rougher than a house cat's purr, but that’s the closest thing Draco can compare it to. Scorpius is murmuring to it and scratching it around the ears.
Jamie looks at him, unimpressed. “You and mum split up ages ago.”
“Oh, I’m freelance,” Harry said casually. “I pick up the jobs I want, when I want. I only have clearance for the jobs I’m working on.”
“No it’s fine.” Draco smiles again. “Tonight would be lovely,” his eyes sparkle a little, “if there’s wine.”
“I’m sorry,” he says stiffly at Lovegood’s bemused look. “Of course you may see it.”
In a shaking voice, Voldie said, “I think you’re bluffing.”
They were briefly interrupted by their lagers and food, but after their server left, Draco jumped back into his tale.
Draco straightened his shoulders and looked down at the prince. “My Harry will always come for me.”
“The doll didn’t have teeth!” Harry shrieks.
“Yeah, but you’re the best.” Ron said and kissed the top of her head.
“Dentures?”
A small cheer went up among the children and Harry smiled. “Can you believe we were ever that small?” he asked quietly.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Whatever,” he said. “I’ll help you get these to Minnie’s office so you can Floo wherever you’re going.”
As they continued their ascent, Draco could feel his breath become shaky while Ron climbed higher and higher.
, quietly, and turned around. “I thought you left!”
Ron nods. “Sure. See you tomorrow.”
Draco frowned, but shook his head thoughtfully. “We sort of skipped that part.”
. Then he'd promptly forgotten all about it because he'd started dating a lovely bloke called David.
Voldie
“What?”
Without any forethought whatsoever, Draco rotates the dingy Time-Turner in his hand.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Keep watching, love.”
“What if no one comes?” Draco asked Harry. “What if too many people come?”
Draco let out a little giggle. “Everything?” he replied. “This is weird, isn’t it?”
” and Harry screamed.
Straightening his shoulders, Draco said, “Unfortunately, I have neither the means nor the experience to start my own business.” He felt himself go back into stiff Pureblood mode, something he was trying to break himself of, but when he was upset, the cold aloof manner came back full force.
Harry held out his arm and Draco took it and they Apparated away.
“He brought you cake,” he says with a wink. “And you sorta maybe asked him out.”
“I like who we’ve become,” Harry says in compromise, then turns to look at Draco.
that good?” Pausing, he thought about a politic way to proceed. “It’s only that when Gin hired him for a Harpies event, it rained.” Then, remembering the afternoon, he added, “Almost as much as it rained today.”
And, she wasn’t wrong. It had been a long morning at the Manor with his mother, Harry, and Scorpius, and then they were spending the evening with all of Harry’s family. Draco had taken Arthur up on his offer of Firewhiskey. Then he had taken one of the older, burly Weasley’s up on
“I think it’s a good idea too,” Draco said to himself.
Mum,” Harry says, grabbing his mug and blowing the steam away. He settles into his chair, inhaling the comforting scent of
Draco couldn’t keep back a smile. “Fine,” he said. “But this better be really bad or else I’m going to talk about my
“Your mum would be very proud if she could see you, you know,” he says as they break apart and feels his heart break at Scorpius’ smile.
“It’s always your fault, Harry.” Draco kissed him again, sweet and warm against the cold rain.
Potter got up and gave Emily back his, still dry, glass. “I tried,” he said to her. “You’re responsible for the rest.”
Draco turned around to the shopkeeper who had a stern look on his face.
under his breath. Rolling his eyes, he started in on what Draco was sure was going to be a ridiculous monologue. “We have been hired to start a war, as I previously told you. As to the whys—” he looked sharply at Hermione— “I neither know nor care. My contact was very clear on what we have to do. You’re both with me because you’re useless on your own. If you have any complaints…” he trailed off with an evil smile. “Well, you know where the exit is.” Draco turned to see where everyone was looking: the gangplank. Meeting no resistance he swung his arms wildly. “Get back to work, you simpletons!” Then he stalked back to where Draco was seated on the ship’s floor.
my clothes.”
did not
“Don’t finish that sentence!” Harry shouted. “Just forget everything.” Slumping deeper into the bed, Harry quietly said, “Please.”
action.”
Harry lets out a little snort when Ron calls the stuffed mice 'artefacts’, but his eyes never leave Draco.
Draco’s face goes pink, but there’s the start of a smile. “I expect no funny business, Potter,” he says with a mock glare. “It’s been a tough couple of days for me and I don’t—”
“I don’t care!” Zacharias shouted. “Throw a rock at him before he can see you!”
Harry looks at him,
“He’s really cute,” Harry admits. "Even if he is a complete terror at night."
"Perfect, Harry," Draco says with a smile.
"Draco!" Harry shouts, half-blind with lust. "I either need another finger or your cock!"
“I don’t think we have to worry about the first one,” Harry said, gently. “And as for the second one, isn’t that a good thing?”
Harry buries his face in the case file and mutters, “Draco came over for curry and a movie.”
“‘S been too long,” Draco answers. “Pull your pants down.”
Draco walks to his room, puts all of their memories on his bed, and locks the door on his way out. He hesitates and casts an extra strength charm that, according to his mother, should stand up to a small dragon. Then he quickly walks back to the sitting room.
The rest of the day goes by in a blur and then it’s time for Harry to Floo home and get ready for the date. He’d sent a memo to Draco about where to meet. Harry thought Apparating together would be a better option than telling Draco ‘puns are the lowest form of humour’ Malfoy the name of the restaurant. Draco had written back in affirmation.
“Shit!” Harry yells. “I’m so sorry!”
“Yes, darling,” Harry says in a heavily sarcastic tone. “You’re truly a martyr.”
Harry’d been a little taken aback at her vehemence.
"Nobody
Draco shrugs. “Well, yeah. You know I’m rubbish with names.”
“So romantic,” Harry says, but he reaches into their bedside drawer to pull out the phial. He whispers a gentle charm and Draco knows the lubricant will be body temperature.
Harry frowns but flutters his eyelashes. “I’m seducing you,” he explains.
Draco bit his lip so hard he tasted copper. “I forgave you for that a long time ago,” he finally said.
Harry’s pleased to see Draco’s cheeks flush.
“She’ll get over it,” Luna replied.
“Taste good,” he murmurs, making Draco shiver.
!” Ron continued.
“So you’ll be here early?” Ron asked with a grin.
“That’s very forward of you, Harry,” Draco said, a little breathlessly.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a smile.
Deciding the battle was already lost, Harry let himself laugh. Luna caught his eye and laughed with him for a bit.
He sits there, adjusting to the stretch that his prep spell had only partially prepared him for. After a year, or a few minutes— depending on which body part you ask— Harry raises himself up an inch and gently lowers himself back down.
“What?” Draco croaks from his hard hospital bed.
“Nah,” Harry said, but his cheeks were turning a lovely shade of red. “We all talked about it before,” he murmured, almost too quietly for Draco to hear.
“Is he going to be OK?” Ron asks when Draco and Seamus are out of sight.
Potter laughed as Emily slammed the door behind them.
“I don’t know about pasta, Lils,” Harry says, making her frown. Al sticks out his tongue at her. “Oi!” Harry says. “Be civil.”
“Thanks!” Harry squeaks out.
Draco spelled his hair and clothes dry and tried to tame the waves he always got before he used styling potions and sighed. “I did have an event,” he admitted. “And I’ve no idea what went wrong. I used the equations I’ve always used. I don’t think any of my potions ingredients have gone bad. The lab is as clean as it has always been.” Letting his shoulders slump, something that would have driven his father spare, Draco sighed again.
They make their way to the Apparation point and in seconds, they’re in the country at a solid, but old, house. Aurors are milling around, casting and talking. As soon as Ron sees Harry and Draco, he walks towards them.
Harry’s laughter set Draco off and then they were both laughing at the sign, in the middle of the afternoon, in a Muggle town with a ridiculous name.
Blue Moon at 7, Emily
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I
They watched the rest of the episode in silence. When it was over, Harry turned to Draco.
Ron nods.
“How many can you fight at once?”
The server nods and scurries off while Harry walks back to Draco who is fidgeting in his chair.
“I can try,” Draco huffs out. He’s able to widen his legs, slightly, and Harry moves so his shoulders are wedged between Draco’s thighs. Leaning down, he licks a slow stripe up Draco’s prick.
“No?” he asks gently.
“Look down at your ankle,” he says gently. “The one that’s hurting. It’s not broken, but you have cut it quite badly.” He points at Draco’s ankle. “It scars, I’m sorry to say.”
Because it
“That’s going to be the death of me,” Harry muttered.
“I know!” Draco holds up his hands in surrender. “It’s just that Ginevra and your mother both have red hair, so the probability of—”
Someone flagged her down and she left Draco to try and make his cuppa drinkable with too much sugar and milk.
“Didn’t realise you could smile so big while you kissed me,” Harry murmurs, and Draco lets out a little laugh.
“I think I’d like to try out the bed,” Draco said.
The day starts like any normal Saturday, a bit of a lie in now that Scorpius is older, and a quick breakfast of porridge and fresh fruit. Draco scans
doing the kissing that I’m opposed to, it’s more…well it’s Malfoy, innit?”
Harry’s using his most exasperating, insincere voice. He’s routinely used it with reporters and it’s never failed to annoy his audience. Draco doesn’t seem immune and he pulls his hand out of Harry’s and pinches him, hard, on the side.
“Luna was invited and Ginny couldn’t go so I tagged along,” Harry answered.
Shouts of “Hermie! Hermie! Where are you?” came through the window. Hermione let Draco take over supporting Harry and she went to peer out the window.
“But you also have some sort of charm on your clothes and you may be counting on the fact that you have an antidote or bezoar hidden on your person and know you can reach it in time, which means I cannot drink the wine in front of you!” Zacharias shouted. “But we also know that bezoars aren’t effective with all poisons and if this is a new version of Weedosoros there may not be an antidote so I cannot drink the wine in front of me.”
“Offer me power,” Hermione growled.
Potter laughed and Draco stood still for a moment at the sound. Yes, he had heard Potter laugh before— they had known each other since they were eleven— but that laugh was one usually caused by Granger or a Weasley. Draco hadn’t thought he'd ever be the one to cause Potter to laugh like that.
Harry smiled. “I’m glad you like it, Draco,” he said.
“Mmmm,” he rumbles. “This is really good.” He looks up and Draco is still smiling, evidently not put off by Harry’s terrible table manners.
“I certainly hope not,” Draco said. “But show me your surprise.”
“A bit mental hearing you call each other Harry and Draco,” Ron admitted. Then he nodded towards a little hall at the back of the room. “He’s in the kitchen with Hermione, getting some snacks together for the kids.”
“Oh, we won’t fight about it, Harry,” Luna assured him. “We’ll just talk about it and she’ll realise that sometimes things happen and there’s no use in getting mad about it.”
“Potter!” he shouts. “What the fuck?”
, Draco was shocked to see it was only a few minutes until three and he and Scorpius both needed to gather their things and be off.
The elf nodded and answered, “Yes, Professor. Hobsey will be right back,” then he Disapparated.
Harry kissed his shoulder again. “How diabolical.” He kissed up Draco’s neck and Draco shivered under him.
“Thank you, Granger!”
After their soup and bacon sandwiches, Harry suggested stopping by the store. He said it was to ‘restock and clean’, but Draco hoped it was just an excuse to spend more time together. They walked the little bit of distance between the cafe and Malfoy’s Menagerie and were so close, Draco could feel the heat coming from Harry’s body.
“I want to do this before we have to go face whatever is at the Ministry,” he whispers then leans down to capture Harry’s mouth with his own.
Harry leans over to nibble at Draco’s collarbone. “I don’t really have any experience with that,” he says to Draco’s skin that’s pink from Harry’s ministrations.
what you want for your special occasion." And yes, it was horribly clichéd, but Luna Lovegood had bestowed it on him at her wedding and as that event had led to the beginning of the success of his business, he'd kept it as a tribute.
“I had hoped we wouldn’t find more,” he admits, levitating the bear and following it out of the office before Harry has a chance to respond.
“It’s fine,” Draco says. “Luna’s just being a menace.”
They were silent the entire walk back, but unlike the walk to the restaurant, it was a warm, comfortable silence. Draco kept stealing glances at Harry and he was pleased to see Harry glancing back. Finally they reached their destination.
fuck off, Ems, he hates me
I must admit, I don’t know if I’m ready for a house full of Weasleys right now. We should see how the smaller gathering goes first.
“I like her!” Stella said in a rush. “It was so much fun!”
“Fuck!” Draco screamed into his mattress. It groaned at him.
“Rings!” Voldie demanded as he shoved Draco’s ring onto his finger. “Your Harry will
“Do you want a tour?” Harry asked.
Harry looks meaningfully at Draco’s clothing change. “Didn’t want to get crime scene cooties on your tight jeans?” he asks with a small smile.
. It sets his body aflame like a pyre on Bonfire Night. He's gasping like a fish out of water— Harry has just enough awareness to wish for a sexier comparison— he's coming so hard. It's all the things wizard porn has promised, but better because it's
Draco, whether it’s from the sudden chill of not being covered by Harry or his words, feels himself shiver as his upper body is covered in gooseflesh.
“I don’t envy you that fight,” Harry said.
“Sure, you probably want a nap.”
“Please,” Harry breathed. He was hard against Draco’s belly button.
“Quit making excuses!” Zacharias shouted. “Hurry up and climb you buffoon! Do I need to find myself a new giant?”
“Ew, Harry!” Hermione had shrieked, giggling. “I didn’t need to know that!”
He glared at the large ginger across the room.
Draco shook his head, blinking back tears. “Nothing you can say can hurt me more than your actions three years ago.”
, I’m all for starting over but we cannot just ignore our pasts.”
“I can’t believe we work so well as flatmates,” Harry admitted. “If you had told me ten years ago that we would end up—” he motioned to them both, comfortable in each other’s company— “like this, I would have hexed you and called you a liar.”
and been happy. But that is so very rare.” He leaned down to whisper. “Because you might have had the happiness that so few have had, it will be fitting that you suffer as so few have.” Voldie lifted the wand and roared “
“It’s a long story and I really don’t want to go into it.” Draco wrinkled his nose. “And don’t you work for the Aurors? They know all about it.”
noticed that Hugo had his mouth stuffed with dirt and grass and groaned.
“But I was there!” insisted Draco. “There were rings and the barmy old man said
Draco frowned back and Harry couldn’t keep the faux-serious expression on his face.
“Quit,” he says, moving Harry so their heads are at the top of the bed. “Quit doing weird things with your face while we’re snogging.”
The man in black Conjured two clay goblets. He reached into his pocket (there must have been an Undetectable Extension Charm on it) and pulled out a bottle of wine and a small phial filled with a clear liquid. He filled up the goblets half-way then handed the phial to Zacharias. “This is a variant of Weedosoros. It’s undetectable, but unlike the standard brew, this is fatal. No painful convulsions, just death. If you are willing—”
“Apparate home?” Harry asks.
Stepping away from Harry, Bellatrix closed her eyes and took a deep breath. On the exhale she whispered
“Oh, yeah, sorry,” replied Ron. “It’s just that your hair looks really nice in this lighting and I got distracted.” He shook his head. “Your six fingered woman is none other than the Countess Bellatrix who is Prince Voldie’s right hand.”
“And that’s my cue to leave,” Ron said, and he turned the whole of his giant ginger body and walked away.
It’s almost a month to the day of their first date that wasn’t either caused by or interrupted by a cursed child’s toy that Draco runs out of patience.
“Are you OK?” Harry asked, his voice full of concern. “Your breathing went all funny and you got paler than usual.”
“Well if you’re going to be reasonable about it,” Harry said, with an exaggerated sigh.
With a soppy smile, Harry pulls him into another kiss. Draco angles him towards the bed and gently pushes Harry toward it, only stopping when Harry’s knees have hit their mattress. He sits, and Draco leans down to kiss him again.
Harry
“If you don’t mind, Bill.” Harry stepped close to Draco— closer than was necessary in Draco’s opinion— to let the four men get to the stockroom.
“Potter if you continue to butcher my son’s name—”
When Harry reaches Draco’s office, Draco is frantically casting. He watches in silence for a few long minutes before deciding to sit down on the loveseat. It’s apparent Draco hasn’t noticed Harry come in, his eyes haven’t left the clown since Harry arrived. His brows are furrowed, his mouth in a straight line, and it’s all Harry can do to not get up and snog him senseless.
here!”
Harry rolls his eyes. "We already talked about dinner at yours, Ron. He said he wouldn't mind."
“I heard you ‘hung out’ with Stella last night,” Draco said back.
“I had to,” he lowered his voice, “wank into a small plastic cup,” he complained. “It was horrible!”
in love with you?”
“Well spotted.” Draco made his voice as dry as possible. “Is there something I can assist you with? I’m trying to gather my things so my son and I can head home.”
“I just want to take care of your ankle,” she says softly. “You’re bleeding quite heavily. I’m afraid you’re going to have a scar.”
“Lower the rope,” said the man in black.
“It won’t be embarrassing,” Draco said. “Not if we do it together.”
“We can do some of the things though?”
Slumping a little, Neville answered, “Do you read bodice rippers too, Harry?”
The man in black’s smile grew bigger. “You’re trying to trick me,” he said. “I assure you, I’m going to give nothing away.”
But now dinner’s over and Draco has
Molly had even gotten in on the fun, buying him a copy of World of Warcraft for Dummies. Arthur had read the chapter about the
“Get me a tea?” his mum asked.
‘Ugh, yeah.” Harry yawns, big enough that it makes Draco’s jaw hurt in sympathy. “We’re definitely owling Luna and Gin multiple times during the next couple of nights so they can suffer like we have suffered.”
were naked in your bed.”
“No, Draco. You don’t.”
“What were they doing?” Jamie asks with an evil grin.
Draco woke up on a ship, disoriented and scared. He searched for his wand, but came up with nothing.
“You feel so good,” Harry whispers into the damp air they’re sharing. He still hasn’t moved, giving Draco ample time to adjust. Draco shifts his hips under Harry and smiles when Harry lets out a gasp.
“Like what you see?” Draco asks, then raises his right eyebrow when Harry looks up at his face.
“Not yet,” Harry whispered back.
“Combo it is.”
what he really meant was
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry says back. “No sass.” He looks at the eagle owl, its huge head scanning the room. “Who are you here for, love?” he asks it. The owl hops towards Harry and delicately extends the leg with a piece of parchment tied to it.
He tenatatively moved his hand away from Draco’s mouth.
Draco was glad Harry had worked
“Eat dirt.” Draco can’t lift his head, and he’s only sort of protesting Harry’s crowing, but he can’t give in to it; otherwise Harry will be insufferable.
“Beautiful isn’t it?” she asked as she waved it over his body, now dripping blood on Harry. “It’s my own invention.” Harry grunted. “Yes, it
“Love you too, Dad!” Scorpius says at volume, seemingly not caring if his peers can hear.
“Have you heard the General Store is going out of business?”
"Historically speaking, I've done a lot for love, Harry." Draco's face is suddenly serious. "I promise to treat your love with the respect it deserves."
WIth a sly look, Hermione interrupted their bickering. “Prince Voldie,” Ginny let out a shudder, “is set to marry the man in black’s True Love this very evening. If you help him, we will crash the wedding, leaving Prince Voldie humiliated.”
“They’re boring,” Draco said.
“I’m just saying you’ve got to name it something better than ‘Draco’s Emporium of Fine Goods’,” she said.
“Yes, but I’m your prat.” Draco yawned into Harry. “Now let’s go to sleep, we have things to do in the morning.”
Draco sighed again. “I think it would benefit everyone.” He glared at Emily. “But there’s not a single witch, wizard, or wix who will shop at a place owned by Draco Malfoy.”
She beamed at them. “It looks like a storm came through,” she said, taking in the store. “It must have been a successful opening.”
“It’s called Pasta Was a Rolling Stone!” Draco exclaims.
“She’d be very proud of you, too,” Scorpius answers. “She would love all of the new family.”
goblet so as to keep it far from you so I cannot drink the wine in front of me.” His voice got higher and louder as he continued his tirade. The man in black didn’t say a word, just kept the small smile on his face.
Draco took a deep breath. “He’s smarter than I was at that age and twice as kind. But he’s terrible at bathtime. It takes twenty minutes to get him in and then once he’s in, it takes twenty minutes to get out!” Warming to his subject, Draco continued, “And he leaves his trainers everywhere! I’ve tripped on them no less than three times. He’s started shouting from his room, something I’m sure he learned from you and your lot, and he refuses to eat chicken unless it’s breaded.”
Seeing his chance, Draco jumped out of the ship, his splash effectively cutting Zacharias off.
Draco stands up, walks over to Harry, and tilts his head down to kiss him on the cheek again. His lips are soft and warm, and Harry hates whomever is leaving cursed objects around London because it’s making Draco sad and it interrupted their date.
“Robert Weasley,” Luna says, kissing her girlfriend on the cheek.
Harry lets out a loud sigh and then a relieved giggle.
Harry opened the door and let Draco walk in. Draco stopped on the threshold.
“Zach, can you just— ” he started.
“Draco!” the owner, whose name always escaped Draco, exclaimed. “It’s good to see you!”
Draco takes off the next three days and hides in his flat, only letting Hermione visit.
Draco felt his own cheeks heat. “Oh, well, then thank you, Harry. You also look nice, um, as well.”
Harry’s brain is suddenly full of flashing lights and the urge to call 999 because Draco Malfoy has
That set Harry off again and soon they were both on the ground, laughing.
Harry turns to pull Draco into a hug, burying his nose in Draco’s collarbone. “Still haven’t seen your tattoo,” he says, mouthing at the sharp jut of the bone.
“You don’t have any obligation—”
“Thanks,” Draco said awkwardly.
Ron turned to Harry. “Sorry, mate,” he muttered, looking for somewhere to stash Harry. “I need to go help Hermie.” He dragged Harry down the hall then turned the corner. There was a suit of armour in a little alcove so Ron gently draped Harry over it. “I’ll be right back,” he said, then took off towards Hermione.
Harry’s heart skips a beat. “You’re no trouble,” he says.
Harry lets out a sigh. “You’re right,” he agrees. “I’ll see you in an hour?”
"Cancel the bloody spell!" Weasley shouted.
“Look, I’m sorry,” he said, “but your dad’s a twat.”

“What?”
Draco rolls his eyes, because since when has
a coward. A spineless, noseless, coward of a man who is more disgusting than all the shit that fills the stables. And I will NEVER marry you!”
Cackling, Ginny said, “Your first story was better. I can help, but it will cost you.”
First he noticed the bonds around his chest, wrists, thighs, and ankles. Then he realized his wounds from the Forbidden Forest had been healed. He opened his eyes when he heard someone walk towards him. “Where am I?” he croaked.
Fred and George started a slow, exaggerated clap that quickly turned into cheering. Molly tried to scowl, but the effect was ruined by the pleased look on her face.
“You’re not going to break me,” Draco grumbles.
Harry was looser now, the slide of slick, decadent and smooth. Harry reached his arms up to pull Draco into a loose embrace and Draco felt surrounded. He was inside Harry’s arms, his prick was
“Pants!” Draco insists.
"Really, he would have beaten me in a few subjects at Hogwarts," Hermione had said, "if not for… well, you know." She'd looked off, uncomfortable with how Malfoy had spent his Sixth and Seventh Years.
doesn’t need to hear it! And especially not from the Saviour of the bloody Wizarding World.”
Draco lets out a low laugh. “Well there’s only about a fifty percent chance the culprit will have their magical signature in the registry. We don’t keep tabs on everyone. Mainly people convicted of violent crimes and Death Eaters. Granger led that campaign—”
Ron and Hermione both frowned at him. Zacharias threw his hands up. “Now do as I say! Otherwise, I swear on Merlin’s grave, I will Silence you both.” He made an impatient gesture and Ron untied the boat's lead and pushed them off of the small dock. “We don’t have all day!”
Draco frowned. “I live, like, five minutes away.”
"Really got under your skin at the time. I still consider that an achievement."
Draco didn’t have words to answer, so he leaned in and kissed Harry instead. Harry’s lips were soft and tasted of vinegar and lager and Draco had never felt as good in his skin as he did right then, kissing Harry Potter.
after another date. This time Draco had taken Harry to a fancy French sandwich shop. He’d said it was a good compromise because the food was
“Where’s the toy?” Malfoy asks. “I want to gather as much as I can from the scene before I take it back to my office.”
Draco let out a little noise of annoyance. “I suppose you’re right,” he admitted. “I’ll call Mother and let her know I won’t see her until the opening tomorrow.”
One thing Harry'd realised, during his great Bi-awakening, was that he’s attracted to competence. He and Hermione had gotten roaringly drunk while Ron had been working late one night, years ago, and they’d discussed all of his crushes.
too much to be comfortable. Draco grabs his wand so he can cast a lubrication charm.
“I can help,” Hermione added. “I’ve been to a couple of events you’ve done and talked to Minerva and the whole process seems fascinating.”
“It was
“I’m just happy,” Draco says. “Horny and happy and a little overwhelmed by everything.”
Draco let out a little laugh. “Yeah,” he said. “It’s just, now that we’re both here and in our pyjamas, under all of these blankets and the duvet, I’m starting to get a little warm.”
“You’re very welcome, Potter. And thanks. It’s been a better day than I’d imagined.”
loved!” he shouted. “I have loved and lost more deeply than you could possibly comprehend!”
“I’ve been pegged!” Harry half shouted.
“He’s docked his boat, right next to ours,” Hermione said.
“Pfft,” Draco said. “So?”
“That would be lovely, thank you,” Draco answered.
Harry’s finger twitched. “That doesn’t give us a lot of time,” he said, frowning then grunted as Ron moved his face towards his own. “And you might as well call me Harry,” he said.
Harry smiled and Draco had to kiss his smile.
“That’s lovely,” said Draco’s mother. Then with no subtlety, she got up from the chair at the little dinette and stretched. “I think I’ll take a little walk around the town. Let you boys catch up.”
believe he’s having a candlelit dinner with Draco Malfoy and neither of them are trying to maim the other.
“Gin’s flirting with Pansy-fucking-Parkinson at your party.” Harry hiccups on his laugh and points. “Somehow we have the same type, post-break up.”
“How did she do it?”
Draco groans. “It’s not a pet, Scorp.”
“Why does it always rain when you’re around?” Draco grumbled against Harry’s mouth.
“Yes!” he crows. “I’d know that arse anywhere!”
“Good luck storming the castle!” Ginny said after Ron thanked them.
“I was thinking we need to have some sort of food and we can write off a case or two of fruit wine and—”
. It’s about a giant monkey fighting a giant reptile.”
Draco shook his head, trying to clear it. “No, nothing,” he insisted. “I’m just getting tired.”
“Oh, there you are,” the man, who is almost-but-not-quite Draco, says.
“They would have killed Harry if I hadn’t intervened,” Draco insisted.
“So,” Harry said. “Now-Draco.”
“Of course.”
“So are she and Stella?” he asked.
p sure it’s a date
“No, Harry. You’re not going to get pissed and flirt with Malfoy. You’re not nearly as suave as you think you are.”
Rolling his eyes, Harry nodded at the elf. “Thank you Kreacher, I know Draco will appreciate that.”
“But we’re not stopping now.” Harry’s not asking and Draco shakes his head in agreement.
They stand in companionable silence until Draco comes back into the foyer, levitating a toy clown. It’s old, probably antique, with a bald skull and painted-on, red eyebrows that were possibly cheery when it was first made and had hair to match. But now, with age, the face has a sinister cast.
hurmph
“He is aware.” Draco spit out.
Harry has to bite back a smile. For all that Ron wants to know everything, in reality, he usually doesn’t want to know
“I was trying to get you to hold my hand, you daft man,” he said, smiling. “But I think you’re too pissed to realise it.”
supposed to mean?” Harry shrieked.
“No, but thank you,” is all Harry can say. He pulls out his debit card, thankful for the twenty-seventh time that Gringotts has adapted to Muggle currency, and hands it to the server. “I’ll go get my companion, can you put everything on here?”
sorry
you!”
His mother tuts at him. “We will be fine, Draco darling.” She lets go of Draco’s hand to pull his head down and kisses him between his brows. “If you’re safe and happy, there’s nothing I can’t endure.”
Draco leans over to wrap Harry’s arm around his shoulders. His heart breaks a little for the sadness he sees on Harry’s face.
“What about that
“Better call me Ron,” Weasley said. “There’s several Weasley’s in attendance today.”
"If you don't have any objections, I'm going to ride you," Harry says, teasing his hole with the tip of Draco's prick.
year, however, Harry and Draco are newly married, and Scorpius finally has siblings. A house full of Potters has done him a lot of good. He’s still a bit of an odd duck, but it’s apparent he’s easier in his own skin.
“It’s not your doing, Potter.”
“The usual, please,” Draco said.
“I was finally able to take all of the dark magic off the doll you recovered last week. Ronald, I’ve owled the thing to yours so your daughter may play with it.”
He’s been so intent on Draco sleeping and eating, that he’s failed to take himself into consideration. He has a small bit of sleeping draught in his medicine cabinet and he drowns it before he can talk himself out of it. From experience, Harry knows he’s got about ten minutes before he’s too woozy to walk so he hurries back to bed. Draco’s awake, his eyes shining from the faint light that streams in through Harry’s curtains.
“We’ll come back,” Harry promises as he reaches down to grab his jacket and pulls it on.
at Draco.
Harry’s a little taken aback. “Oh, er,” he says, scratching his neck. “You left in a hurry. I wanted to make sure you were alright.”
It was that small, sad sound that finally made Draco look up.
Harry smiled, a small private thing. “I’ve never done that before.” He tilted his head, bit his bottom lip. “With a guy.”
Lacking any sort of grace, Harry shrugs out of his shirt and pulls off his trousers, kicking his shoes off towards the wall. He blushes when he hears Draco’s laugh.
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Take good care of the father of my children, Malfoy.”
attractive when he blushes. And Harry’s working on keeping him as pink as possible. Their flirtatious back and forth has been fun. Harry knows Draco is intelligent, but he’s also clever, and quick with a sarcastic retort.
“Are you forgetting the time we tried to kill each other in an abandoned bathroom?” Draco turned, not wanting to relive the worst years of his life and frowning from the shame.
“Equipment,” Harry replied. “How can I help you with your weather equipment?”
“I could give you my word as a Londoner?”
Draco moved back even further so he could lay between Harry, his shoulders wedged between his legs. Harry’s prick was as thick and long as Draco had predicted. He lifted himself so he could mouth up the length, then he took as much into his mouth as he could. He wrinkled his nose a little at the leftover, almost antiseptic taste from the lube. While Harry was distracted, Draco moved his arm and slid a finger into Harry.
Draco feels his ears heat. “That’s… awkward.”
Harry felt his forehead crease into a frown. But he couldn’t help but let out a snort at Draco’s insistence on his son’s name.
Sobering Hermione up took—
for Paris, but Harry liked that it had a large bed and bathroom. Plus, the decor was a little more understated than some of the ‘traditional’ Parisian hotels that Draco favoured.
“Harry,” Hermione admonished him. “Let him finish.”
Harry’s face went fond again. Draco hid his smile behind his hands. They stared at each other for several long seconds.
that’s mine now? How did you even find it? It’s forever away from London and all traces of civilisation! And why are you alone? Aren’t you and the Weaselette shacked up with like seven kids by now?”
with his boyfriend. The show was one of the few good memories he had from Privet Drive. Dudley had never shown any interest when it was on, so Harry had been able to watch in peace.
“It’s a housewarming gift from me and Luna,” Ginny says from the doorway. Then she mutters, "Apparently."
“Then there’s the bed.”
“We’re not keeping him,” Draco half-growled, finally breaking his silence.
Potter looked at him and bit his lower lip. His eyes twinkled and he turned his head as his shoulders shook. Draco heard a stifled laugh.
“Oof,” Ron says. “Do you think…”
“Or I could do that.”
“Oh, I’m gonna make it a thing,” Draco growls then gets up off of Harry.
“I won’t ever be happy, you daft bint!”
Draco grabs his hand as they wait on their server to bring Harry’s card back. He gives them both a little smile and hands Harry the receipt and card.
"Do you know what you're going to call him?" Luna asked as they reached Draco's door.
“It’s good news, Draco,” Harry says.
“You know as well as I do, Draco darling, that food bought with other people’s money just tastes better.”
was a cursed movie. Draco wanted to Obliviate himself to forget it, but there were too many other things he would forget if he cast too strongly and lost the whole day. Like the way Harry looked as the wind flowed through his hair while they were driving. And his wink when he was surrounded by the townspeople.
Shaking his head, other Draco starts speaking again.
“Are you afraid of sex?” Draco asks with a serious look on his face. “It’s OK if you are.” He frowns. “Or if you don’t have any interest in—”
He smirks at Harry and nudges the bear with his foot, making it wiggle a little. Harry pushes his chair away and hisses.
find me. There is no where you can take me that he will not find. Better you—”
Pulling his wand out, Ron cast and the man fell down. He gave Hermione an apologetic look. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to jog him so hard.”
“Not a date,” Draco mouthed to Emily after he turned to look at her.
“I WOULD NOT SAY SUCH THINGS IF I WERE YOU!” screamed Voldie and he threw Draco into his room and locked the door.
“Would a nap help?” Harry asks.
The eye contact was too intense, Draco had to look down. “I think you’re also very attractive,” he told his peas.
a witch,” she reminded her. “We both are.”
Prince Voldie was overseeing all of Draco’s wedding preparations. Draco was clad in a beautiful set of sky blue robes that had flowers embroidered around the pearl buttons ran down the robes in a line from his throat to the floor. The embroidery was done with real gold thread and matching gold ribbons were woven into Draco’s hair. He had a small gold crown on the top of his head and he had never looked more beautiful. For all of the pampering, he had a resigned look on his face.
“And what are we up against?” Harry asked. Ron moved his face so he could speak.
“Good night, Harry,” Draco whispers back.
literterature, or—” he shuddered— “
They sat in relative silence, Draco eating his toast and Emily slurping her milkshake. After a few minutes, Stella came back to their table and settled into the empty seat across the booth.
Draco perked up at that. “Oh, well, you just could have said.” He squeezed Harry’s hand and bit his lip at the fond look he got in return. “Such a sap,” he whispered.
“Ron’s already at the scene,” she tells them.
Harry led Draco to the back of the store and up the stairs to the flat above. They got to the door at the top and he stopped.
“Can’t believe I’m being replaced by a cat you didn’t even want.”
“Why are Ron and ‘Mione so obsessed with Malfoy?” he asked his sitting room.
“Draco,” Harry said. “This is True Love. Do you think this happens to just anyone? There is nothing that can best it. I
“Good plan, Malfoy,” he croaks out after he’s successfully swallowed his food. “We can take turns hiding it around the house.”
While waiting for a return owl from Harry, Draco had started walking around the castle to help calm his mind. He had gotten progressively more anxious as the date of his wedding to Voldie grew nearer. He heard Prince Voldie shout at the Carrows and at hearing his name, he walked into Voldie’s chambers.
Hermione started talking so Ron moved Harry’s head so he faced her. “Well, we have my wand, your daring, and Ron’s strength.”
Voldie shook his head. “I’m sorry?” he asked.
“What’s what thing?” his mother answered.
With a laugh, Draco gets out of their bed and moves to the ensuite bathroom. “If you’re up for it in the morning,” he says, “I’ll be happy to deliver. But I have a sneaking suspicion that you’re going to want a Hangover Potion more than my mouth.”
His tirade was cut off by the appearance of his waterlogged mother. “Blaise,” she said angrily. “You said
Draco smiles. “It’s fine. You’ll be picking up the bill, and free food tastes better than—dear Merlin, Harry, this can’t be the place.”
Harry takes his time unbuttoning the shirt, kissing and biting at each spot of exposed skin. Draco feels a bit like a present being unwrapped and he revels in the feeling of being pampered and
Draco smiled at her. She had a kind face and had never judged Draco when he had done things that were decidedly un-Muggle.
“I’m tired,” Emily said. “Can we take a nap?”
and is shocked when he finds two hours have gone by. He’s sure Ron would say something about Harry being obsessive and well, Ron wouldn’t be wrong. Finally the light show slows down and Harry can hear Draco saying something under his breath.
“Will you stay?” Professor—
It was only because he was staring so intently at the floor that he missed her next gesture, but he heard Scorpius start to laugh and he looked back up at McGonagall. She rolled her eyes at him.
“What’s wrong, Draco?” his mother asked, her voice thick from sleep.
Draco had ordered takeaway from Harry's favourite restaurant and had been sure to only serve small portions so neither of them would over eat and be too full for sex.
“This is easily the least sexy sex I’ve ever had,” Harry says after they’ve calmed down.
After dropping Harry, Draco had moved to his side and they were cuddled together on the bed. “I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck.
It burns a little; they don’t often have time for penetrative sex, but Draco knows Harry will make it worth his while. Harry rubs Draco’s lower back with his free hand.
“No, it’s stupid,” Potter said. “I just—”
Draco rolled over and snuggled up next to Harry, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry closed his eyes and let out a deep breath, enjoying having Draco pressed against him.
“Then you invited me out for a birthday dinner.”
“Is this the point where I ask if I can kiss you?” Harry asked.
McGonagall smiled, clearly charmed by Scorpius. “I’m glad to hear that.” She focused her attention on Draco with a more serious look. “One of the lessons that is of most importance is to learn how to fail.” She raised an eyebrow and Draco could only nod.
The drive was nice. The weather was mild and they were able to roll down the windows and the wind ruffled Draco’s hair.
“If Emily knows about magic, then I’m fine setting things up that way.” Harry winked. “If you can get the stock in and ready in two weeks, I’ll work on everything else.”
Harry snickered, thankful dad duties had pulled Ron’s attention. But then Ron turned back towards Harry.
Draco frowned. “Don’t tell anyone,” he told Harry. “I have a reputation to maintain. Also, going back, you never did tell me why I shouldn’t take a drink from the most muscular Weasley.”
“I would say it was nice to see you, but that would be a complete and utter lie, so I’ll just say, have a safe trip back to wherever it is that you currently reside.” With that Draco stormed out of the café. He was halfway to his flat when Potter caught up to him.
PB squeaks at them both and Draco laughs. Harry joins him as their kids look at them with expressions of horror and happiness.
“Nah,” Potter said. “I set my own hours so as long as I wrap things up before the night’s over, I’ll be fine.”
“Go away!” Draco shouts back.
Draco grimaced. “Yeah,” he said, “it’s just the one kind. But it’s a bacon sandwich and tomato bisque.” He shrugged. “It’s kind of hard to fuck those up.”
“Harry Potter, yes,” Draco answered.
“As business partners, I’ll need to be able to get in touch with you,” Harry said. “Oh and we’re calling the store
“Are we finally moving forward with this?” he asks in a bored tone.
Harry nodded against Draco’s neck then moved so they could kiss. Draco cast the one wordless, wandless spell he knew and his palm was slick. He gingerly moved his arm to keep from slicking up Harry’s stomach and reached between them to gently touch Harry’s cock.
Voldie let out a deep laugh. “I would love to watch you work, you’re a master at your craft, but I’m afraid my plate is rather full at the moment.” He let out a sigh. “I’ve got to plan the murder of my groom, frame Surrey for the murder, the city’s 700th anniversary party to plan. I have little time to rest, much less timeto do things I enjoy.”
Emily rolled her eyes then leaned in. “You should do it though. A store of things
“Those are Funko Pops, Arthur,” Harry said, walking to him.
“I’m sorry?” he asked. “I’m being weird? Have we met? I’ve always been weird.”
“Has it been fifteen minutes?” Ron asked.
“I think it’s time to go home,” he says gently. “You’re going to be fine.”
Draco can’t control the soppy look he’s got on his face, and for once, he’s glad to be so completely, utterly open for another person.
"And… Did you?"
Harry lets out a sigh and is cut off when there’s a loud knock on the door.
Grabbing Draco’s hand, Harry walked to the Forbidden Forest. “Your prince will never catch us now,” he said with obvious glee. “We’ll be safe in the Forbidden Forest.”
“Bugger off!” Harry tells his children. “If I want to kiss Draco, I’m going to kiss him.”
“The founder was a famous cricket player,” Draco said. “He did
Luna didn’t say anything, she just walked up to Ginny and gave her a kiss on the forehead. A gesture that was only slightly marred by the fact that Luna was soaking wet and her hair dripped all over Ginny’s body. She moved down to kiss the tip of Ginny’s nose then placed a sweet peck to her lips.
After sending the letter, Draco’s predictions about his mother are proven correct. She is in their flat, talking excitedly with Scorpius about the niffler.
“So, clearly we don’t get sent to Azkaban,” Draco says impatiently. “Judging by your outfit.”
“Thanks, Potter.” His voice is small and quiet. “I needed that.”
Ron lets out a groan. “No, Harry! You can't do that again! You’re going to end up dead from firewhiskey poisoning.”
A few scenes went by before Draco shouted, “What are those things?” then, “Who is
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Harry asks hopefully.
of a thing.”
“Blech,” Draco proclaims and Harry can hear the smile in his voice. “Emotions.”
“Neville!” Harry interrupted what was surely the start of a rant, clearly a sore subject. “How exactly do you think I know about the happily ever after?”
He motions to where the restaurant is supposed to be and he and Draco start walking together. Harry’s happy that the extra inch (or three as Draco is fond of pointing out) doesn’t mean that Harry has to quicken his pace to keep up with Draco. They seem to walk in sync and it’s another weird tidbit that Harry files away to think about later. Not in an obsessive way, just in a general, kind-of-wondering way,
instead of just a new version of
“What?” Harry asks with a shiteating grin. “You sing all the time!”
Then, as obviously the universe hated Draco, it started to rain again.
“On what?”
Draco cuts him off with a hard kiss and pulls his legs tighter around Harry’s middle. “If you stop now, Potter, you’ll sleep on the sofa tonight.”
“Molly found some nice plates and bowls at the Burrow and said you could have them if you like them. They’re a little floral—”
Draco looked at the cliffs; they were huge and imposing and he didn’t doubt Zacharias’ word that Prince Voldie would have a difficult time navigating them. He let out a ragged breath and pulled his legs up close to himself to help keep in some of his warmth.
Harry nods and slips under the sheets. Draco pulls him close and rests his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Voldie turned back to his two enforcers. “Nothing must happen to Draco,” he reiterated. The Carrows grunted their agreement. “Now go!” he demanded. “Clear out the forest!”
Hermione’s eyebrows raised to her hairline. “See!” she insisted. “True Love! Surely that is a noble cause.”
“How are things going with Stella?” Draco asked with a leer.
Harry walks closer and hears, “And I use mouthwash, sometimes I floss, I’ve got a family, and I drink cups of tea. I’ve got nostalgic pavements, I’ve got familiar faces, I’ve got a mixed up memory and I’ve got favourite places,” so incredibly out of tune and off tempo that Harry falls in love with Draco all over again.
Draco can feel the bed move as Harry reaches over to grab the phial of lube. He lets out a little hiss when Harry’s finger starts to breach his entrance.
dramatic
“If we know to look for dark magic on objects that have a rather macabre effect, then I think we'll be able to easily identify the objects.”
Draco nods. “That would be appreciated,” he says and laughs when Harry’s pleased look falls.
“Fucking hell,” Harry spits out. He whirls to look only at Draco. “It’s the first one. I swear it. No dodgy curry for either of us.”
Hermione was at the rear of the ship, looking off in the distance while Ron was trying to placate their apparent leader.
“Yeah,” Emily declared. “Gotta meet up with...Stella.” She nodded at Harry. “Good to see you Harry.” She turned to Draco and mouthed, “DATE”. Then said, “Draco, I’ll see you later.”
Harry grunts back at him. It's the first Sunday morning of Christmas hols, and they’re supposed to be enjoying a lie-in. The house is empty; Albus and Lily are spending the weekend with Ginny, James is with a friend, Scorpius is with his grandmother.
“Come snuggle with me, Harry,” is Draco’s response, the need in his voice clear.
Harry nods his head. “She’s not wrong,” he agrees. “If we have crooked Aurors, they need to be prosecuted for their crimes. Those in power should always be held accountable for their actions against the people they’re supposed to serve.”
“I’m glad you like it,” Harry said, quiet. “I hoped you would like it.”

All Draco can do is groan and rub at the back of his left thigh.
“What?” Draco yells after he’s wrenched the door open.
Taking that as permission to move closer, Draco moved his hands around to the small of Harry’s back and pulled him closer.
Harry shrugged. “I thought he was with you…” he started before he lost his balance and wavered on his feet, almost falling. Hermione easily caught him, but Draco looked at them both in horror.
“I didn’t mean to break down on you at work,” he whispers into Harry’s neck.
Harry shrugs, a little helplessly. “Cake?” he suggests.
Hugo started to wiggle and Ron let him down. “He’s on the move, Rose.”
Harry shook his head, making his wild hair somehow even wilder. “Fine.” He scowled and Draco felt a flicker of amusement. They were at

“Why didn’t you lead with that?” Hermione shook her head. Then after a pause she threw her hands in the air and asked, “Well?”
at Draco.
“So you were at the three events during which my business failed?” Draco half shouted, putting his cup of tea down when his emotional outburst started to make the tea slosh over the edge.
“Um, Luna, is it something you bought at the shop or is it your own blend?” Harry’s sure to ask because he has sampled her custom brews in the past and had gotten spectacularly high. The experience was fun, but not when he’s about to go on a date with Draco Malfoy.
Then he grabbed his wand and cast, quickly neatening the mess, even if it didn’t organise the papers the way they should be.
“Just shut it,” Harry said. “I’m not going to spoil anything.”
Harry’s head flopped again, but he was able to roll it to look at Hermione. “There’s no way the three of us, with only
“How’s that better?” Harry demanded.
“If you leave a visible spot on my neck, I will—”
In any case, his former slogan of ‘Wizard’s Weather Services promises to use cutting edge Arithmancy and Potions to deliver the desired meteorological results for the needs of any occasion’, was, admittedly, rather dry. Draco did miss the days of being able to call it WWS, but Weather-Be’s had a nice ring to it. At least that was what Luna assured him.
“So it’s not as an apology—”
“I’m only a couple of months older than you,” he said with a sniff. “I hardly think—”
“A decade and a half of dueling will do that,” she responded with a smile.
Harry laughed. “I told you!” he said.
“Don’t be rude, Draco,” Mrs Malfoy admonishes him.
“Oh, fuck off, Potter,” Draco groans.
“Look at it, smell it,” the man in black said. “You can see it’s clear and has no odour or taste.” Zacharias sniffed deeply and smiled. “Give it back to me,” the man in black continued, “and I’ll put three drops in one of the goblets of wine. Then I’ll let you choose which one we both drink.”
,” and Harry huffs out a little laugh.
“Hey, if you wanted to do it, then there’s no bullying. Maybe just some light cajoling.”
Ron nodded and held Harry’s mouth open so Hermione could give him the pill. They stared at him for a few seconds before Ron asked, “How long do you think it will take to work?” Hermione shrugged.
Hermione rolled her eyes again.
“We’re going to
“I hope so,” Draco said, pulling back with a little frown.
"That would be… tolerable," Malfoy allows. "Weasley usually looks bored when Hermione and I are discussing things."
“Malfoy?” he exclaimed.
Malfoy gives him another one of those fond smiles and turns to leave, muttering to himself under his breath as he walks away.
“I can think of several ways to make you happier,” Harry replies, smirking.
of my characteristics—”
She did as ordered and Draco was left to fend for himself. He stumbled when he was finally free from the leather bindings and was promptly pulled away as Zacharias moved them from the edge of the cliff to a more grassy area. “Hermione, take care of him,” said Zacharias, still pulling Draco and motioning for Ron to join them. “As soon as you’re done cutting the rope and he’s fallen…” he trailed off as Hermione finished cutting the thick rope. “Let’s go!” he ordered.
She reaches down and grabs his hand with hers. It’s small and cool as always, but Draco can feel a slight tremor running through her body.
“Probably still you.” Harry smirked and looked down at the table. “Do you have any suggestions on what to order now that we’ve got our drinks?” A slight shudder overtook him. “But not the mozzarella sticks, those were terrible. The next day I felt worse than I do when I drink too much.”
The end of the second week of set-up brought all of the packages from the wholesale vendors. Draco was delighted that they were sent directly to the store instead of being something he had to pick up himself, but he did enjoy the visits with the local vendors. However, the mass produced products meant Draco didn’t Transfigure the packaging since that would have caused too many questions. So putting the stock up from the deliveries took very little time.
Draco looks at the hopeful look on Scorpius’ face and sighs. “You can floo Mother to ask what he might have for a snack, but I’m writing to Potter to let him know we’ve found—” Draco feels his nostrils flare. Only
Pulling back, Draco asked, “Is this OK?”
“I’m drunk,” Draco muttered to himself.
“Ah, well,” Harry winked, “I am both.” They stared at each for a moment before Draco let out a disbelieving giggle and started walking, hoping he was going the right way.
“Why does Uncle Harry sound like a sad trumpet?” Rose asked.
Ron shot Hermione a worried look as she started walking away from Zacharias, Draco, and himself. “Be careful, Hermie,” he said.
“What was your problem with him this time?” Ron asked, gently lowering Hugo to the ground again.
Draco boosts himself up so he can kiss his boyfriend.
Dinner with Ron, Hermione, and
“Very much so,” Draco answered truthfully. “But where are we going to sit? It seems packed.”
“Your mother’s house,” Draco retorted.
He cast, extinguishing the fire and shuttering the windows, then motioned to the stairway. Draco followed him up to the second floor.
“Harry, why are you blushing?” Ron asks.
Harry smiles sheepishly. “Oh yeah.” He looks around Draco’s office. “Can I send a note to Ron?
“You go,” she answers and Seamus smiles in thanks and walks off.
, Harry.”
“Fair?” asked Zacharias. “Who cares about fair? I didn’t hire you for your brains OR to be fair!”
“This pulls out to be a guest bed if you have someone over,” he said. “We did use quite a bit of magic on it to make everything comfortable, so please be careful with it.”
and realises he’s running late.
“Magic,” she repeated. “Like, I knew it was a
“You’re wrong,” he grumbled. “He’s just my business partner.” Draco sent three more bottles of lotion careening to the shelf, knocking down the rest of them. “Fuck,” he muttered and with another spell, straightened them all.
After Emily had finished checking in the guest, Draco walked up to her flat and took the large hunk of brownie from her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“When did you get here?” Harry asks, confused. “Weren’t you snogging Parkinson in the corner?”
Hermione sighed. “I’m sure they'll all have wands,” she responded. “So if you fight ten, that leaves twenty for me.” She paced some more. “We need the man in black,” she said after a minute.
There are huge windows by the sink and oven. It’s early evening, but the sun is still bright enough that golden rays stream through and illuminate the space. It’s homey and welcoming in a way Draco’s never been able to capture for himself.
“Right!” Harry squeaks and starts to shimmy out of his clothes.
“I ate at the café,” Emily said. “With Stella.”
Without a word, Hermione flicked her wand. “I want my father back, you bitch!” she screamed and Bellatrix fell.
Draco can feel Harry’s laughter and he curses his husband in his head. But Harry follows through, and Draco’s suddenly glad he suggested three fingers.

“It still wasn’t your idea,” he whispers back.
“Did you like it?” Harry asked.
“Thanks,” Harry whispered.

With a sly look, Draco said, “A little bit of both.”

“Keep your paws off my husband,” Draco said, affronted.
“Wait!” Draco says, high and reedy.
“Dad!” Scorpius said as Draco exited the Floo. “Rose has a graphing calculator!”
Ron had carried the man in black all the way across the Thieves Forest and over a small bridge when they stopped at a squat little house. It had a bright purple door and a windchime made of glass vegetables. Radishes seemed to be the most prominent, but there was also a courgette, a few potatoes, and a parsnip. Hermione was unaffected, her focus was on who lived in the house, but Ron started yearning for a roast. His attention was pulled to the door as Hermione knocked on it.
“Oh, love, you’re

“They’re family, Draco.”
“What if I gave you my word on the soul of my father, Richard Granger, you shall reach the top alive?”
Finally it was the morning of Draco and Prince Voldie’s wedding. The country of Wiltshire had been busy with preparations for the upcoming nuptials and the 700th celebration of Hogwarts. The Carrows were busy clearing out the Thieves Forest.
“Where are you going with Harry?” Scorpius asked as he grabbed his bag and jacket and they made their way to the Floo.
Draco turned to face Potter. “Emily said it was an ancient text and that it was classy.”
Draco sighs. “Yes, you said it all aloud.” He shakes his beautiful head at Harry. Harry—who… yes, has had several glasses of firewhiskey in addition to the signature cocktails Feorge and Gred have made—is struck dumb by how shiny Draco’s hair is.
“But you already have!” screamed Zacharias. “You’ve told me everything! I know
Draco felt his eyes start to water as he thought about the selflessness of his wife.
“You’re welcome,” Harry answered. Then, “Hey, maybe one day you can bring Scorpius out to Ron and Hermione’s and they can play with Rose and Hugo. Rose is at a Muggle primary school and she doesn’t know many magical children outside of her cousins.”
“I’ll send an owl,” Ron said.
“Ugh, come in,” Draco moaned. He grabbed his wand from his bedside table and unlocked the door.
“And he has no problem marrying someone who is incapable of love?”
“This is all
For the second time that night, Harry shrieked, but this time it was from Draco putting his ice cold hands up his shirt, resting gently on his stomach.
Holding up his hands, Harry says, “I’m sorry, Draco.”
“Yes, Dad, you’ve gone over that like four times.”
They hold hands as they walk down the hall, and Draco cannot believe this is his life. He had never let himself imagine being this deliriously
“Yeah,” Harry warbled. “Because we’re mates and we share a flat and—”
After the months of apologies, his dad being sent to Azkaban for life, and doing well in all of his classes, Malfoy had been less of a tosser. Harry knew, hypothetically, that Malfoy was a little…
“If you’re sure.”
“Are you fucking laughing at me?” Draco demands as he rubs his leg more. “You’ve injured me—”

need to talk strategy for Draco Malfoy and his son,” Hermione said as she walked out of the room.
They stood in silence for a few moments. Just as Draco was about to storm back to the castle and collect Scorpius, Harry spoke again. “I got your letter.”
“You are a big help,” Harry said. “That’s good information, Rosie.”
Then she took in the progress Draco and Harry had made and her mouth dropped open.
“Unhand me!” Harry wheezed. “I’ll beat you to a pulp!” Then his head fell forward.
“Can you hold this for me?” Harry asked seriously.
wandlessly cursed Bellatrix so that her left cheek started bleeding, an exact copy of Hermione’s own curse scar.

is kinda over simplifying it,” he said.
“Gah!” Draco exclaimed.
“And the others?” Draco asks, his frown now creasing his forehead.
Draco shook his head but relented. “Yes you may, Scorpius.”
It was his idea!
“We can make it that easy.” Harry leaned forward and kissed Draco gently. “I mean, we don’t have to do anything, but I’m still interested if you are.”
“Yes,” Hermione answered with another hex, “I find it’s a good opener.” They spent several minutes firing and blocking hex after hex until the man in black went on the offensive. Dodging and returning hexes, Hermione asked, “Oh, are we switching to Sprout’s defense?”
“So,” Draco started. Paused. “The Blue Moon doesn’t exactly have the budget for champagne.” He wrinkled his nose. “They have

Harry shrugs but the effect is muted by the fact that they’re still lying side-by-side on the bed. “It’s a Muggle song called ‘I’m Yours’ and I thought—”
who's making him feel this way.
“No,” Emily replied. “Your news first, then mine.”
“I love you,” Draco says with a pout.
“My bed is tiny.”
Ron nods. "Yeah, whatever you need," Ron says as Malfoy walks to the door. "Hey, Rose has been asking for you, Malfoy. Are you free next week for dinner?"
“And you can romance Malfoy,” Ron adds. “I mean, that is assuming you actually speak to him.”
“Why haven’t you done anything with a bloke before?” Then Draco realised what he’d said. “I mean, that’s super personal so—”
“Thanks,” Draco replied, weakly.
“Happy birthday, Draco.”
Instead of answering, Harry smiles and replies, “I love you so much, Draco,” and Draco melts a little.
“Oh for Godric’s sake, Ronald, dry him off,” Hermione scolded. Ron rolled his eyes and sent a gust of hot air at Draco, who appreciated it, but had no intentions of informing the ginger giant of the fact.
“I believe you said you were going to fuck me into the mattress,” Draco answers in his most prim voice.
Seamus nods and they walk away, talking quietly about the toy.
“You didn’t really break down,” Harry whispers back. “You had some emotions you had to work through.”
“Voldie is publicly disgraced ?” Hermione asked. At Ginny’s smile, she nodded. “Yes. The shame of it will haunt him for the rest of his life.”
“Next week.”
over them both, then kissed Draco. “I’ll always come for you, my love.”
“I need my arm,” Harry says, trying to pull free.
kitten as a housewarming present was a normal thing to do.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice is suddenly serious. “Please look at me.”
Neville smiled back and shook his head. “It astounds me every year,” he admitted.
Draco refused to move. “You killed my one True Love,” he spat.
Draco’s bed creaked again.
"What did queer wizards do before someone invented that?" he asks, still frowning.
Harry's heart starts up a sharp staccato rhythm in his chest.
“Oi,” Emily interjected. “I
“My mother will be in the same room as us,” Draco said, making sure to enunciate clearly. “I do not want you being a pest.”
“It’s Lily’s,” Al says. “I wanted a Crup.”
Draco looked at him, aghast. “We’ll die in the Forbidden Forest!” he exclaimed.
Draco watched, in horror, as Emily began to laugh with Potter.
Draco bites back a giggle and tries to roll over, but there’s a warm lump next to his feet. He sits up and sees a small, perfectly round, orange circle of fur, and his heart gives a little blip in his chest. Harry sits up next to him, making the mattress move.
“Something like that,” Harry answered.
“Well, you brought me food, we kissed and now we’re in bed together.” Draco moves to pull Harry into the crook of his shoulder. “I don’t know what else to call tonight, Potter.”
Ron sighs. “Yeah, I think so too. Go talk to him.”
Harry’s being attacked by the giant squid when he wakes up.
Then, when Draco lost his wife a couple of years ago, he'd become more sombre and quiet, which intrigued Harry more than he cared to admit. The Draco of Harry’s memory had always been a little theatrical and overly dramatic. Now, he has a sense of gravitas and maturity that he wears well. His face is still pointy and pale, but his grey eyes project so much
“Yeah, but you kissed me,” Draco responds and then yawns a little. He twists so he’s looking at Harry instead of the movie. “Thanks for this,” he whispers. “You were right. I'd have stayed at the Ministry all night.”
,” Harry said with a smirk.
“This is just the weirdest  second date I’ve ever been on,” he admits.
Hooker’s Hamlet— because this was his life now— consisted of the building where he and his mother lived, the café, a run-down inn, a General Store, a garage where automobiles were both repaired and sold, and the Town Hall.
“If you’re going to be a prat—”
“C’mon,” Ron said, extending his arms so Rose could curl up with him. She climbed in his lap and snuggled up with him. “You are the
Kreacher didn’t answer, he just barged into Draco’s room. Harry snickered when he heard Draco yelp.
owe you money!”
The next day, Harry was at the shop when Draco got there.
Smiling, Ron ambled over to her. “Hermie,” he said in greeting.
“I’ll pick up pizza,” he says, walking to the door. “But Draco, if you want any, you have to let me back inside.”
A bark of laughter made Draco look up. “Me or your food?” Harry asked.
“She means you,” Ginny says, smirking. “But Draco has certainly been a terror during his life-time.”
“Who knew Kreacher’s shite warming charms would turn out to be such a good thing,” Harry said with a yawn.
Stella came to the table, interrupting the moment.
“No!” Draco shouted. “That’s
Zacharias nodded. “I accept the terms.”
“You can moan and groan all you want, Harry Potter, but I’m not doing it for you.” She looked around at her collected children. “I’m not saying we’re all suddenly pro-Malfoy,” Arthur let out a snort from his corner. “But the boy was just a child when everything happened. And I need to see him in person to know if he’s actually changed or if it’s all just an act. If we can mend fences between our families for the sakes of the next generation, that will be a good thing.”
Groaning, Ron picked Hugo up again and lifted him up , making the boy laugh, high and musical. “Your Uncle Harry needs to let go of his obsession with the pointy git,” he said then lowered Hugo so he could kiss his belly. “Harry, Malfoy’s not ‘up to something’ anymore,” he said over Hugo’s giggles. “Auntie Luna swears he’s given up his juvenile delinquent act.”
“He is a good father,” Hermione added.
“It’s OK to miss her, you know.”
“Back to the soft opening,” Draco said in a thick voice.
“Oh, did I—”
“She just doesn’t notice that her boyfriend has been taken over by an alien?” Draco asked, incredulous.
Draco does as bid and in seconds, he’s back to his world, the broken, grey world where his family is in tatters and he’s alone.
“He bought you a gift,” Emily repeated, gently shaking the bag at Draco. It was Slytherin green with silver paper. “If there’s anything in here
Hearing a groan from another room, Harry could only guess George had heard the discussion.
“Give me another minute,” Draco said. “You’re still really tight.”
“FINISH HIM!” thundered Zacharias.
Draco is once again struck by how different from Scorpius he was as a teen, and he lets out a sigh of relief. His son deserves every good thing Draco can give, and he’s so proud to see how easy he is with his affection. He watches as Scorpius hurries off to board the Hogwarts Express and smiles as Scorpius turns back to wave frantically at Draco with a big grin.
He whirls around, stopping the words hanging on Harry’s tongue.
“You know,” Harry says as they walk into his lounge, a cosy room with big squashy sofas and the general mess that comes from having children, “
, Draco felt comfortable in only treble-checking them. Another month and Draco went down to double-checking his data and potions. By then, Draco was having to turn down events because he couldn't attend each event himself and he was seriously starting to consider looking for an apprentice.
Prince Voldie and his entourage rode to the rocky terrain. He dismounted and looked at the demolished rocks. “Someone fought a giant and won,” he said as he walked to where an outline of Ron’s unconscious body was still visible in the grass. “Again, the victor leaves towards Surrey.” Voldie looked at Bellatrix and gave her a sharp nod.
nasty," Malfoy admits. He turns to look at Harry then Ron. "It'd be easier for me to take care of this in my office," he admits.
“Draco,” Blaise drawled, “does your magic not work during the week?”
and they walk to the Apparition point still holding hands. They reach the site and Draco pulls Harry close.
“I’ll take over,” he said.
“I have to go back to the Ministry,” Draco says, then there’s a loud crack of Disapparation.
“Why?” Draco repeated. “We’ve always hated each other.”
Harry laughed again and gave Draco the soft, fond smile from a few days ago. “You have,” he replied, still smiling. “Several times.”
“I’ve brought tea,” Stella said as she walked towards Draco.
“I brought two joints,” Emily said when they pulled apart. “You can’t be too upset about that.”
“Draco, what the hell are you talking about?” Pansy glared at him again.
“Yes,” Draco says. “Exactly that.”
“It’s actually an upgrade from the old one,” Emily admitted.
Then suddenly, “Ow! Harry, stop!”
Hermione looked at her with clear eyes. “Offer me money,” she demanded.
Harry smiled and Draco wanted to throttle him. “That wasn’t too bad!” he exclaimed. “We both know Venomous Tentacula on sight and the ones that shoot fireballs obviously make a nice, popping sound so we know what to look for.”
“It’s fine,” Draco interrupts.
“Al is fond of Scorpius and there’s a lot of gossip from school. Al really seems to look up to you.” Harry snorts. “He might have a bit of a crush on you, if I’m being honest.”
Suddenly rushing, Draco stands and walks down the hall. “I need to take a shower,” he says over his shoulder.
“I should hope so,” Ron said. Then his face turned thoughtful. “He’s widowed,” he said with a frown. “From all accounts, it seems like they actually loved each other. I’m sure he took her passing hard.” Ron looked at Hermione and Harry could see his heart start to break at the thought of losing Hermione. “Wouldn't wish that on anyone,” he whispered.
Draco pulled his head back to give him an incredulous look. “You were
“Is Master planning on sleep soon, or is he just going to stand in the hall and torture poor Kreacher?” the elf asked.
“No,” Draco says, as sternly as he can while Scorpius makes
Emily shrugged. “Just trying out something new,” she said. “Stella suggested it.”
with a poorly drawn shop sign that had ‘Draco’s Emporium of Fine Goods’ on it. Rolling his eyes, Draco stuffed it in his pocket so he could put it with the other motivational notes Emily had begun leaving him. It had started months ago, about a week after he had started daydreaming about opening his own store.
“Cod or haddock?” she asked Draco.
“Good.” Draco said then kissed him. Dropping his wand, Draco started to fuck his tongue into Harry’s mouth, rolling his hips, letting their cocks rub agaist each other until the bit of slick Harry’s had became tacky and uncomfortable. He pulled back and knelt between Harry’s spread thighs.
Draco cracked his eye to peer at him.
“Are they all…” Harry starts.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco said, unsure if Harry could hear him over the sound of the heavy rain.
“Fun?” Draco demanded. “I have no idea what is going on!”
“Hello,” she said quietly. “My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
He feels Draco nod and wraps his arm around Draco’s waist.
Seamus starts laughing and leaves without another word.
“If it’s too much, I can speed up—”
Draco shrugged and went back to sending various bottles of lotion and bars of soap to the area he had designated as the shelf for self-care items. He smiled when things were all in a row, the glass bottles gleaming. Harry had insisted on sustainable packaging as much as they were able and Draco had carefully Transfigured all of the plastic into glass. Each bottle had an embossed seal with ‘Malfoy’s Menagerie’ and a stylised dragon circling the name. Apparently Ronald Weasley had designed it.
nice.”
Draco smiled. “Why do you look afraid, if you’ve killed him?”
“To Harry and Malfoy,” he proclaims, then clinks his glass with Harry’s.
"Promises of the rich." The man in black spat on the ground by Draco's feet. "Don't make me laugh."
Harry’s smile was brighter and fonder than any of the ones Draco had ever seen.
The paperwork was tedious, but with help, it was manageable. They slogged through licenses for alcohol, food,  taxation, and other minutiae that Draco had no idea went into owning and running a business. After an hour, Emily brought out a bottle of wine. After two hours, she brought out a bottle of whiskey. By hour three, they were done and Emily and Stella were bladdered and Draco was feeling pleasantly tipsy.
As the door opened, Draco sat up in his bed and fluffed his pillow to use as a seatback. He could smell the tea Emily brought. It smelled suspiciously like what was served at the Blue Moon. But the greasy bag in her hand could only be cheese danishes and those were surprisingly good and always welcome.
“What do you think, Draco?” Potter asked as Draco’s bed dipped from his weight. “Should we go into business together?”
“I am the Dread Pirate Black!” he growled in an unearthly voice. “There will be no survivors!”
“Don’t repeat anything I just said!” he said a little wildly. “At least not until you get to Hogwarts! But even then, keep it to your Common Room!”
Harry laughed again and Draco couldn't keep the smile off his face.
Draco Malfoy is
Draco smirks. “And a night in Harry Potter’s bed will keep my thoughts off of everything?”
“Even with a discount, our mark-ups are good. Hermione ran the numbers and what we’re offering will still be a profit.” Harry paused and smiled at Draco. “A smaller profit, granted, but it’s not going to make us go under.”
With some gentle poking and prodding, Draco pulls Harry to himself. “You’re fine,” he says. His shoulders are shaking a little and Harry has a feeling it’s from trying not to laugh.
“Right!” Potter said with a small amount of false cheer. “Let’s start things over again.”
They walked in silence for a few minutes.
“He’s acting particularly unhinged lately,” Hermione muttered.
“Either rase it or rent it to someone local. They’re going to want someone to fill the shop floor and flat upstairs.” The woman whose name Draco didn’t know gave him an appraising look. “Why? Are you interested in starting up a business?”
Shouting
Draco felt his face flush. “I’ve done more new things with you these past few weeks than I have in...” he shook his head. “It feels like my whole life.”
Emily laughed. “No you idiot, it makes the bath water turn different colours and makes it smell nice. It’s really relaxing.”
Harry squeaked. “That was weird!” he cried. “Warn a bloke.” He shifted around in place. “I feel wet in places I don’t usually feel wet.”
“Where?”
Bellatrix gave him a sympathetic look. “Go,” she said. “Do what you need. Please take care of yourself. If you don’t have your health you haven’t got anything.”
“Was it too much?” Draco asked.
“To get

“You had
“Good night.”
"Sure," Harry agrees easily. "But you have to do it. You fucked all the magic out of me."
“We’re all going back to the Burrow,” Harry said, walking to Draco and leaving Mr Weasley still engrossed with the Pops. “You and your mum are welcome to come.”

, but it was nice seeing someone who knew about magic and his world.
“Sorry!” he insists, pulling away. “Just—” he laughs again. “I guess it was getting annoyed at the proximity of someone else,” Draco says looking down at his chest.
“It’s outside but I thought we could just cast a Warming Charm and it would be fine,” Harry explained under his breath.
are exposed and Harry sees the hint of a tattoo under the right one.
what Harry had suggested and feels his own cheeks heat at the memory. Harry had more than delivered on his words that night.
There were three people trying to fix the carriage, a short woman with beautifully dark skin and wild, curly hair, an unusually tall, muscular ginger man who was covered in freckles, and a short, nervous looking man. He had dirty blond hair and washed out blue eyes. As soon as Draco walked close, the short man spoke.
“Harry.”
Draco walks away from the Floo to put his things away. When he turns back to Scorpius and the niffler, he lets out a sigh.
Hermione scanned the guards. “We need the man in black now,” she said decisively.
“Oh, well, let’s start it then.”
“I think it’s a good idea, Draco.” He winked at Emily as she made an approving sound. “Bringing local goods into a single store so that the consumers can shop all of the local wares is a bit brilliant.”
. They burst out of the Bog and landed in a heap.
“Why would you do that?”
He makes a mental note to find out what kind of tea Luna made and serve it to Ron the next time it’s his turn to make them both tea at the Ministry. He hears the whoosh of the Floo and lets out a sigh.
Alecto looked at the members, her sight settling on a large ginger giant. “You!” she shouted, pointing at Ron. “Take care of it!”
“Plus there’s cake,” Harry says.
“Harry, you’re almost naked!” Luna exclaims as she walks into Harry’s room, apparently making her way through his flat in record time.
“Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings us togewer today…” he droned. He had the longest beard Draco had ever seen and was going dotty in his old age. “Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam...” he continued. Draco sighed.
Harry heard that Draco had turned his life around after the war. He dedicated his life to trying to make up for his behaviour and the beliefs he’d held the first seventeen years of his life. Since his split with Ginny, Harry has seen him around at Ministry events looking, quite frankly, tall and gorgeous in his dress robes. And he hadn’t been exaggerating when he said Al had a crush on him: Harry’s son is besotted.
“What, Potter?” he asks. “Is there something on my face?”
He lets out a little snort of laughter, the furthest thing from refined and posh and all those other things Malfoy's supposed to be, and
Swimming as fast as he could, Draco tried to get as much distance between himself and the ship. However the water was cold and he was in his flying robes which were voluminous and threatened to pull him under. The sad band of criminals peered at him from the side of the boat. They were gesticulating wildly, but Draco could only hear snatches of their conversation.
“Oh, I’m not going to
“Is that everyone?” Alecto asked.
“Children!” Harry shouts, then stops as he hears two distinct cracks outside their cottage that could only be Draco.
“A lot!” Scorpius answered. “Dad’s always extra excited when we get to come to Hogwarts.”
Harry gasped. “Where did you get that? It looks exactly like mine and mine was one of a kind!”
“And?”
“Draco my love, there is a shortage of people both beautiful and clever. It would be a shame to lose you.”
Scorpius comes running back into the room with a smile on his face. “Can I hold him again, Gran?” he asks.
“No,” Draco grunts.
Then he takes in his surroundings, as if he’s just now seeing them.
“Most people are on their wedding day.”
Hermione and Ronald shared a glance.
Omg! Caroll-in made THE BEST ART of
“And eat!” declares Jamie.
“Because you’ve changed,” Potter said. “Because I honestly think it’s a good idea.” He paused and looked Draco in the eye. “Because I’m eventually going to want to do something less dangerous than curse breaking.”
“Sorry, what?” Ron asked, unhelpfully.
“I’m sure we’ll find him,” Harry reassures her. “He’s probably  at Fortescue’s trying to steal all of the ice cream scoops.”
about his life. Emily, being one of the only people of moderate intelligence (and who would willingly listen) had been conscripted into becoming Draco’s friend.
“Thanks, Mother,” he whispered.
SIghing, Draco looked around his sitting room. He'd been pacing and had caused a little mess in his wake. The corner desk where he kept all of his Weather-Be’s paperwork had been hit especially hard.
Draco let out a sigh. He
Ron looked at her in confusion. “He’s dead.”
Harry let out a little laugh. “Thanks for the vote of approval.”
“I like this for you,” she whispered into Draco’s neck.
Ron either ignored him or couldn’t hear Harry over Hugo.
“That’s so wicked that you can do that,” Emily said, grabbing some tea bags from a cupboard. “Makes things so much easier.”
“’M with Harry!” Ron shouted back.
Malfoy’s ears, somehow, turn a darker pink. Harry wonders what colour they turn when someone nibbles on them and then lets his head crash back down to his desk.
Rain was coming down in buckets. Draco had been contracted to control the weather for Mrs Zabani’s latest wedding. Usually, Draco didn’t do weekday bookings but Blaise had asked for a favour. And who was Draco to refuse one of his oldest friends? So he set up all of his spellwork, set the potions up at the correct points, and planned for a lovely, sunny, wedding. But then, of course, it had all gone tits up.
Harry laughs quietly.
Harry felt his face scrunch up. “Is his company
“Lovely of you to leave me at the mercy of the masses,” Draco drawls, half an hour later, holding a plate with a large slice of cake. Harry perks up and Draco scoffs. “If you'd rescued me, you might get cake, Potter. As it was, I had to save myself so this slice is all for me. It is, afterall,
Their discussion about Hermione’s genius is interrupted when a memo comes flying back from Ron. It reads
Potter, shouted, “Draco! I know you’re in there! I saw your mum at the café and she said I should drop by.”
Draco snickered. “I wouldn’t mind some
Emily moved so she was sitting next to Draco, leaning against his pillow. Draco, deciding not to risk spilling his tea everywhere, leaned over to set his cup on the bedside table. When he was done, Emily laid her head on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco’s mouth was so hot in the cold room. Their bodies had started to warm under the duvet, but their faces were still out in the cold air of Harry’s room and when Draco’s nose bumped into Harry’s it made him shiver. Draco captured Harry’s lower lip between his teeth and he shivered for a completely different reason.
Rolling off Harry, Draco starts to pull his trousers off. “You’re far too drunk to fuck,” Draco says once he’s down to his pants. “Can you even get hard?”
“Yes!” Zacharias said with a maniacal look. “To the death,” he finished.
“He got you to my home,” Harry says. “And we’re not fighting.” Draco’s blush starts up again. “I would say that calls for a treat.”
,” Harry said gesturing to Draco.
“Nothing,” Harry said in a rush.
“Excuse me,” he said to a woman he had never seen before. “What are you doing here?”
“Rule number one!” one of the twins yelled.
With a tut, Draco rolled his eyes. “They’re in the closet. You need
Draco pulled out the shiny silver paper and looked in the bag. There was a black frame inside. He pulled out the frame and looked at it.
“Sleep. We’ve an early morning.”
does harry know that
“I like it.”
He kissed Draco again, just a quick peck, the same act that Draco had gotten jealous at Emily and Stella for. It wasn’t a huge, romantic moment. It was small and sweet and genuine.
“Yeah, apparently if you’ve seen the previous movies, it’s a little easier to understand, but I felt going into it with no previous knowledge of the plot was more fun.”
“I think I can keep to that timeline,” Harry says. Then he pries Draco’s legs off of him and wriggles down his body until he’s sat between his thighs.
“Thought I’d drop by,” he said, squeezing himself in the spot between Draco and the arm of the sofa. “Just wondering what you’re up to.”
Everything was set up by Friday, the day before the opening, which meant Draco had plenty of time to be anxious.
“Save your money, Mr Malfoy,” she said in a cold voice. “You’ve been a good friend to Blaise so I won’t ruin your business, but rest assured I will never attend an event where your services have been contracted.”
Gently pulling his fingers out, Harry waits as Draco rolls over. He settles himself beside Draco before he grabs the phial of lube and slicks his fingers up again. Gently inserting two fingers, he starts to scissor Draco open. Then he pulls all the way out and puts three fingers back in and leans up and captures Draco’s mouth with his own.
“I asked—”
Things at work settle down after that. Harry and Ron take down an illegal potions smuggling ring and Draco takes Harry out to dinner to celebrate. After walking Draco back up to his flat, Harry gently pushes Draco against his door and kisses him until they’re both breathless. Then Harry asks him out on another date.
Harry nods and puts on his work face to show Malfoy he’s paying attention. Ron swivels his chair so they’re both staring at Malfoy.
“Draco thinks Harry’s got a big one,” Emily said as she walked to grab her coffee from Stella’s hands. They shared a quick peck and Draco tried to quash the feeling of jealousy. He
“Tomorrow.”
“Hon,” Draco mumbles.
“I think we’re still overdressed,” Draco said with a glint in his eye. He rolled over to grab Harry’s wand and Vanished both of their pants.
Draco's immediate reaction is to pull his hands in to protect the Time-Turner, clutching it against his chest.
“You’re welcome,” Draco said. “Wait, for what?”
“I know what you’re going to say, Potter. I did do my penance. I made amends. I did everything after the war the right way! And not only did I do things the right way, I
“Offer me anything,” Hermione demanded in a dangerous voice.
“Won’t that explode the bath?” Draco pulled off his clothes until he was down to just his pants.
Draco let himself be led by the King. “He didn’t come,” he whispered.
“I forgot I had you in my pocket,” he told it.
The walk was nice. They were in a
“Just use a temporary sticking charm and make sure you wear a vest under it,” Ron says in what is surely supposed to be a sensible tone.
"I know," Draco says smiling. "It's one of your better qualities."
Harry ignores the glare. "Do you want Chinese? Curry? Pizza?"
He can feel Draco laughing behind him.
Draco huffed and slid down, moving his pillow so they could share it.
"Potter?" Malfoy asks. "Where is the nightmare dolly?"
“Your fuckbuddy then—”
Draco glanced at Potter’s face and he really did look confused.
When Draco grabbed his trousers off the floor, there was a second note that simply said,
Rose was on the floor making ‘womp womp’ sounds and giggling.
Harry shook his head, thinking about his ill-fated relationship with Ginny. He was glad she and Luna had gotten together. After Harry and Ginny had taken a break during the war, they hadn’t ever been able to make things work after it ended. They had remained close friends, but the spark had died between them and Ginny had admitted he'd become more like another brother than a boyfriend.
"Gratastic!" Harry says, trying and failing to say either 'great' or 'fantastic'. He turns back to his desk and lets his head thump back down onto it.
"Yeah, Malfoy said sorry for being a twat before," Seamus had told Ron, Harry, Dean, and Neville, all of them crowded in Harry and Ron's tiny room. "He never really bothered me much, but he was a right dick to everyone else so I told him 'whatever' and he fucked off."
“Nevermind, dear,” Mrs Weasley said. “Look at these flowers your mother brought you.”
Harry stammers, “Uh, i— it was a, um, gift? From Ginny?”
No matter what happens, Harry's happy to have best friends who support him in his romantic adventures. He reckons their closeness is partially because they’ve been best friends for seventeen years, and partially that Ron and Hermione married at nineteen, all of which makes them too invested in each others’ lives. But Harry is happy to have his friends’ support even if a one-night stand once described their relationship as
“I don’t have to share it with my mother, Harry. I don’t care how small it is, it’s
“Ah, I see you found that,” he said with a little frown.
They both turned when they heard someone clearing their throat. It was McGonnagall and Draco felt his cheeks flush.
Penelope interrupts whatever his mother was about to say with an answer from Potter.
It was too intense, Draco had to look away. “I’m glad of all of those things too,” he said. “You know, before you crashed back into my life, I told everyone no. Emily wanted me to open the store, Mother wanted me to go back into the Wizarding world and try and find an apprenticeship. Hell, Stella just wanted me to spend time with her.”
“This was not what I had imagined when I suggested we stay here,” Harry admitted once he was able to speak.
Draco smirked. “I knew she was dating a Weasley, I just didn’t know which one. But she fancied the girl Weasel at Hogwarts so I put two and two together after you told me you and she had broken up.”
Several Weasleys laughed.
“No! Bad Harry!” Emily shouted. “You used to be so kind and sweet! I can’t believe Draco rubbed off on you!”
“Harry!” Ron says, his voice fond. “This is what you wanted”
“I have a ninety-seven percent success rate,” Draco said, unable to keep the cold tone out of his voice. “The Zabini wedding, the Harpies event, Hogwarts—”
All of the children have been in their flat since they came home for Christmas, and Harry’s Silencing Charms are rubbish, and Draco’s too self-conscious about the size of the flat, so they’ve gotten by with a few lack-lustre handjobs in the two weeks since they’ve had a full house. But it’s Boxing Day, their
“What are you doing with your face, darling?” Draco asks with a frown. “Are you going to sick up?”

Draco, the wanker, hides behind Harry.
a shirt like that?”
Harry spent the next week in meetings and Floo conferences. After Hogwarts, he had taken a few years and lazed around Grimmauld Place, eventually becoming so tired of the rundown atmosphere of the old house that he hired a construction crew to gut it and start from scratch. After
“And yet, here we are,” Draco answered with a yawn. “I do believe it’s about time for me to retire to bed. If you’ll show me where that is, I would be grateful.”
“OK,” Draco said. “Well, I’m going to go to sleep now. Goodnight, Harry.”
Draco rolls over to kiss Harry. "I'm happy to make that sacrifice."
Still, Draco couldn’t leave. He took in the store, the tall wide windows that let in so much sunlight, the gorgeous brown of the cherry wood flooring, the antique counter where the cash register sat. The building had beautiful architecture. It was a shame Draco wouldn’t be able to do anything with it. He hoped that it was leased out instead of torn down because it was really a beautiful piece of property.
“Uh, about sixty guards, guarding one gate?” he answered, his voice going high.
“I hate you both,” Draco said. “I’ve got to go to the café to pick up a tea for Mother.” He glared at Emily. “You are
“We can both sniff each other!” Harry declares and pulls his jumper over his head, tossing it into the corner where he thinks the hamper is.

he gives you a way to open
“Why were you shouting at us to not shout?” Al asks when Harry reaches the front room.
Zacharias scoffed. “Inconceivable,” he muttered. Turning towards Draco, he smiled. It was, perhaps, supposed to be intimidating, but it merely annoyed Draco. “So you see
Deciding he was too drunk to talk to anyone, Draco pulled out his wand and subtly cast a few protection spells on his mobile and kicked it into the shrubbery that was by the entrance.
“A pass on the mechanic, then,” Harry agreed.
Voldie nodded. “Yes,” he agreed. “There is nothing more precious to me than my fiancé. Do whatever you need to ensure his safety.”
“Ah, so he’s your business partner and maybe something more?” Draco’s mother said, breaking their eye contact.
. Suddenly Harry’s left with his cock tenting his pants, a small wet spot, very visible against the light green cotton.
“Draco,” Luna Lovegood says, appearing almost from nowhere. “I’ve been looking for you.” She pulls her wand and Draco flinches away.
Draco frowned at him. “Those are brand new,” he complained. “Now they’re going to be dirty.”
“His son is Rose’s age and we’ve seen them around Diagon.”
Draco let out a sigh. “Fine, you’re right.” He set his face to his best ‘I’m listening to you, but know I don’t really want to’ expression. “Go on,” he said, magnanimous.
He smiled back. “Still, be careful.” She nodded and continued to the edge of the cliff.
“Ron said their red sauce was excellent.”
Rose let out a giggle. “He doesn’t like mashed veg,” she confided to Harry. She looked at Hermione and made a face. “I’m not too fond of it either,” she said in what was probably supposed to be a whisper.
“I can’t wait until we try things out the other way,” Draco teased. “You think
Ron nods and sends his Patronus off.
He hobbles in and takes in the sight of bodies strewn on every surface in various states of distress. Backing up, yet again fleeing his situation, he bumps into a side table and hears something fall. Something shiny catches his eye and he leans down to pick it up. Draco’s breath catches when he realises it’s a Time-Turner.
white vests under plaid shirts. His hair was growing out and dusted his chin, curling under at the ends. Somehow his eyes had always been lined in black, making the grey so cool and clear. And sometimes he'd worn a thin black choker, nestled under his Adam's apple. Harry had thought long and hard about how licking under the black band would taste.
“Oh, so sending my daughter a creepy doll is fine, but a teddy bear with human teeth disturbs your delicate sensibilities?”
“That ship
“Sorry, ‘Mione,” Harry says, pulling himself close to Draco and shoving his nose into Draco’s neck.
Emily gasped and clutched her hands to her chest. “No!” she mock-wailed. “Anything but
“This still OK?” Harry asked.
weird,” Draco muttered.
“I was…” Harry interrupted.
“Unfair!” Harry insisted and Draco smirked.
“So is sudden rain something that happens now?” Harry asked.
“There’s no need for that!” exclaimed the man in black as he stood stock still. Then all of a sudden he smiled. “Can we come to some sort of understanding?” he asked in a conciliatory tone.
“Inconceivable!” Zacharias shouted. “There's no way—”
So naturally, after their Eighth Year had started, Malfoy had been remarkably more withdrawn and Harry'd still felt that flicker of attraction and then pity for the other boy. After winter hols, Draco had started coming out of his shell more. He'd personally apologised to all the students in their year for being such an arsehole.
. Maybe Harry will wake up early on a Sunday.
“Ron!” he shouted as he Floo’d into Hermione and Ron’s lounge. “Why did we invite Malfoy over?”
“About your new tattoo,” Ron replies, more smoothly than Harry expects.
“Not fair!” Harry shouted.
Potter!” Draco insists. “Also, are you wearing Auror robes? How exactly did that happen?” At that question, Draco looks significantly at his Marked arm, and then over to almost-but-not-quite Draco’s still exposed arm.
There is minimal jostling around as Harry’s kids move so the three Malfoys can come inside. Draco and Scorpius take off their shoes, leaving them with the pile of trainers at the door, while Mrs Malfoy casts a protection spell around her shoes.
Harry gently moves himself off of Draco, grimacing at the feeling of come starting to drip out of his arse. "You're sleeping in the wet spot," he declares.
calm your tits i’ll talk to you tomorrow
Harry’s face was hard as he glared at Voldie. “I can assure, I won’t be the last to insult you, you disgusting swine.” Harry spared a glance at Draco to make sure he wasn’t upset, and seeing only support, he continued. “To the pain means that first I will remove your feet, below your ankles, next your hands below your wrist. I would say I would remove your nose, but you don’t really have one so I’ll leave that alone.”
"Draco!" Harry shouts as he rounds the corner to Draco's office.
He and Harry have just finished at a crime scene and are about to Apparate back to their office at the DMLE. Harry's struck speechless by Ron's assessment.
Harry raised his brows. “Oh, am I
“We can do that.” Draco rolled them so they were side-by-side. “But you have to talk to me and let me know how things feel and if I hurt you.”
Instead of an answer, Draco reaches down and rubs Harry’s soft prick through his pants, giving it a gentle squeeze. Harry shifts in his grip, relaxing into his husband’s capable hands.
Draco clutched the tea and coffee he had grabbed on his way to the store. “I
“You,” Draco replied, “thinking. That’s novel.”
“I’m lighting up while you do that,” Emily said. “We’ve got a movie about cats to watch.”
He does as Draco demands and starts to pick up the pace of his thrusts, lifting Draco’s hips up as much as he can in their position, and suddenly he’s brushing against Draco’s prostate. It’s too irregular to be anything more than a tease, but between the time Harry’s spent getting Draco undressed and ready and everything he’s doing
a lot?”
“If I take them off,” Harry says on a gasp, “this will be over far too soon.”
“No fighting at Christmas,” Harry interjected.
Harry turned to the man in front of the register. “Sorry about that,” he said. “Just had to clear something up.” He smiled, and Draco knew it was directed at him, even if he was looking at the man in front of him. “Did you find everything you needed?”
“It’s got a collar!” Scorpius says, interrupting Draco’s thoughts and shoving the animal into Draco’s face.
A few days go by and Harry and Ron find another cursed toy, this time a set of Mickey and Minnie Mouse toys that have embroidered teeth.
Harry feels a sudden, unexpected burst of shyness. “Would you want to fuck me?” he asks.
“You’ll have to ask Scorp’s dad,” Weasley answered.
Draco looks up, and through his blurry vision, he sees Potter.
“Well,” Draco said, peeking up at Emily, willing to call her bluff. “There was this one bloke with the biggest cock—”
But some unspoken agreement, they moved on from more personal subjects as they ate. Harry told Draco about the changes Minerva had made at Hogwarts and Draco talked about Scorpius’ primary school. Then they were both done and waiting to pay. Harry had some sort of plastic card that took care of everything and they found themselves outside.
"I'm almost ashamed to admit this is doing wonderful things for my ego," he says and he starts fucking Harry on his fingers in earnest.
“Potter, are you coming?” Draco asks after Harry forgets how to walk.
him. ‘Mione said it was fine if we just bet on you admitting to yourself that you had a pash on Draco.”
“Quit licking me, you wanker!”
Which immediately backfired as Draco grimaced.
“I don’t want to date Malfoy,” Ron said sarcastically. “But you’ll invite him to ours without even a ‘hey mate, can I invite my nemesis to play with your first-born?’”
Draco could
“I was not,” Draco said, making sure to keep his words clipped. “I would never exaggerate about this abomination.”
They put in their order for mains and Harry ends up getting the spaghetti and meatballs. After inhaling a good portion of the calamari, Harry decides he can’t possibly eat more breaded and fried food
Harry’s brain quit trying to dissuade Draco, and he put all of his energy into snogging him instead. They bit at each other’s lips and Draco slid his tongue into Harry’s mouth. He tasted faintly of peppermint and Harry hoped his own toothpaste had kept away any funk due to sleep.
Stella patiently watched Draco and Emily bicker. When she saw they were done, she said, “I really would have thought something was weird, Draco. There’s a bunch of construction noises from the outside, but when you walk in, everything is already built and—” she pointed at Draco— “your wand is out.”
Draco lets out a laugh, high and hysterical.
When the coughing spell had settled, the woman looked at Draco again.
“Ah, are you leading with Snape’s offensive?” the man in black asked with a smile.
. Draco was bound and gagged and made to sit down by the rock. Zacharias muttered, wildly, to himself as they watched the man in black approach. As he got within speaking distance, Zacharias pulled out his wand and jammed it into Draco’s jaw.
And it wasn’t that Harry was doing anything particularly incriminating, but he hadn’t expected Draco to barge into the bathroom when Harry was doing
In his pyjamas and bed, an hour later, Draco started thinking about what Potter had told him before he had fucked off.
“Does it pass inspection?” Harry asked, almost too quietly to be heard over the noise in the restaurant.
“Fine,” Draco bites out.
Dramatically.
attacked. And Black took me as his prisoner, that much you know. But I wasn’t lying when I said my
“He just meant it as friends,” Harry whispered to himself.
is Zacharias!” he roared.
“Cats?” Draco asked as he dialed his mother. “What’s so weird about that?”
“You weren’t paying attention,” Draco says with a frown. “It’s rude to ignore someone while they’re in bed with you.”
“No one of consequence,” the man in black replied as he pulled Draco up by the arm and started dragging him away from Zacharias’ body.
Draco had talked to the powers-that-be in the Town Hall and said the name was a rather rude word for sex workers, but they insisted people would only see it as a reference to cricket, as was the founder’s intention. Draco thought they were wrong and had insisted they change the name. They had refused.
“I was invited,” she said, her cheeks starting to turn pink.
letting go of Draco’s hand. “My friends say you own your own business and have a son.”
Draco and Scorpius went home not long after Harry asked Draco out. Ron, Hermione, and Harry had moved to the garden to let Hugo run off his last burst of energy while Rose followed him at a more sedate pace, repeating, “Slow down, Hugo,” in a voice that sounded very much like Hermione’s.
Ron shouts, “Seamus!” and he joins the three of them.
“Can I come in?” Ron’s voice comes through. “I know I was joking, but also, like I kinda wasn’t? You’d both better be decent!”
“I know you’re in there, you arse!” he shouts, banging on the door.
“So any big plans besides wining and dining Malfoy?”
“Some weird box thing that ‘Mione got Rose for Christmas last year. Apparently it’s a Muggle thing,” Weasley said as he walked in with a small child on his hip. He reached out his hand and Draco shook it. “Good to see you, Malfoy,” he said. “Welcome to our home.” He pointed at Rose, “That’s obviously Rose and this little one—” he bounced the boy on his hip, making him giggle— “is Hugo.”
Harry nods.
“Excellent”, the blond man said. “Hermione, Vanish the carriage so we can get out of here.” He looked over at the ginger giant. “Ronald, grab him and throw him in the boat.
Before Draco could answer, Luna walked up. "Lovely weather, Draco," she said with a smile. "I've always thought people should spend more time in the rain."
“Sure,” Draco said. He shook his head in confusion. “So you’re…”
, and Draco wouldn’t trade this slightly bumbling, almost awkward sex for the world.
“Well, when two people love each other
Draco flicked his wand and a shrunken box flew at him. “I dismantled it,” he said. “We need to drum up interest in the store. We have to let our future customers have some idea that there’s something new coming.”
Hermione let out a little tut. “You’re as bad as Ron,” she said. “He’s fine now. A little sad, quiet, and very dedicated to his son.” She waved her hands at him, shooing him towards the kitchen. “Go bother Ron.”
“Ugh, Hermione, you don’t want to know how creepy that thing is,” Harry says. “It’s like to give you nightmares.”
Harry held his hands up in a placating manner. “That’s not how I meant it.” He paused, his brow furrowed. “They don’t care about
“Do I really look like that when I pout?” almost-but-not-quite Draco asks. “No wonder Harry laughs at me.”
“I think we could make a life here,” Harry said, optimistically. “We know the tricks of the Venomous Tentacula and it looks like the Bog has a slight sheen to it, so we should be able to avoid that as well. I don’t really understand the fuss.”
“I promise,” Voldie answered. “Nothing shall happen to him. I give you my word as the first of my name, Prince Voldie Plonker Riddle.”
“You might have had
“We don’t have to go,” Scorpius said.
"Surrender!" Voldie shouted again.
“What was her obsession with teeth?” Ron shouts, after they're called to an abandoned house and see the black and white stuffed mice with anthropomorphic features. Their smiles are grimaces and they have individual fingers and toes. Ron stomps over to them and runs a few scans that show they definitely fit the pattern of cursed children’s toys.
Frozen in shock at his daring, Draco’s breath was stolen from him as the Dread Pirate Roberts shouted, “As you wish!” as he rolled down the hill.
“How did he fix it?” he asks other Draco, remembering the sound of glass breaking when he dropped it.
Malfoy had come out. Quite spectacularly.
Harry drops his face in his hand. “Cut me some slack, yeah?” he asks. “It’s hard being a single parent.”
Stella got up off the bed she and Draco were on to pull Emily into a kiss.
Harry
“Southern twat,” she replied. “How will you know how much to use if you add it first.”
“Get out of the automobile and look at it, Harry.” Draco let out a sigh. “I know you want to.”
, and ties the missive to his owl, Penelope. He grabs a treat for her muttering, "good lass," as she flies out the window to Potter and his family. Then he finishes his wine.
“Well, Cedric, obviously,” Hermione had said, winking. “He was the Hogwarts Champion, Harry!”
. He nods at other Draco.
Harry didn’t answer, but he did pull Draco back into an incredibly filthy kiss, all teeth and tongue and wandering hands. While they kissed, they worked on getting Draco out of his pyjama bottoms and Harry out of his ratty flannel joggers. Then they were both left only in their pants.
Opening the window, the woman peeked out again. “I’ll call the Brute Squad!” she threatened.
“Thank you,” said Harry as he leaned against Draco. “You saved me,” he said in awe. They hobbled out of the Forest. They were met by Prince Voldie, Countess Bellatrix, and a few soldiers. They were on foot and all had their wands drawn.
“I don’t need magic to kick your arse!” Emily shouted, coming out from behind the counter of the lobby.
“Drink?” he asks.
Harry reared his head back a little. “I’m sorry, am I supposed to be
