Severus was going to get the boys when he caught them snogging each other and couldn’t help himself and summoned a camera and took a picture, scaring the two boys. Both boys had a different reaction. Once Hadrian realised what his mother had done he warned him not to show the picture. “Hmm How about no!” Severus then darted out to show his husband and the other Malfoys the picture he had taken. Tom saw his husband running down stairs smiling like a madman while holding a camera. “Ok, what did you do this time Love?”  “I caught the boys snogging each other.” Severus showed the other adults the picture.  Just then Draco and Hadrian came down the stairs.  Both of them had murderous looks on their faces. “I’m dead.” was all Severus said before his son and his mate walked over. “What’s wrong with you Mother?” “What?! It was one time!” Severus hid behind Tom so the teens couldn’t do anything. “I won’t lie, it's very cute.” Narcissa said with a sly look. It was Draco’s turn to freak out. “Mum. Stop!”  “Well it’s true.” Both boys groaned in annoyance and their parents just giggled at the two boys. “Well that was eventful.” Lucius said smiling at Draco and his mate. “Father.” “Yes Draco?” “Shut up.” “Alright”
Severus was nervous about teaching Hadrian how to shadow travel. “Hadrian has seen what it has done to me. But then again, he might last longer than I did.” Severus carefully made his way to the training yard that the Malfoys had and met up with his sister and Hadrian who were already training. “Hello, brother.” Elaina walked over to him and instead of crushing him with a hug, she gave him a small hug as if she knew. “And before you ask, yes I know. Tom told me.” Elaina smiled at her brother before turning back to Hadrian and once again started to train with him. Severus made his way to the benches before sitting down and watching his son and sister train. When they went to take a break, Elaina came to sit next to him. “So, what does Hadrian know about so far?” “Let’s see. He knows about the feeding habits, both yours and mine. He knows some wordless and wandless magic. Now, we’re working on shadow traveling. Remus should be here soon with Remy, Draco, and Valorie to teach the unforgivable curses.” Right when Elaina said that, Remus and the other teens arrived. Valorie and Remy were chatting away and Remus and Draco practiced wand movements. When Draco saw Hadrian, he ran towards him and tackled him to the ground. The two wrestled each other, trying to pin the other to the ground. Draco ended up pinning Hadrian and grinned at him like a madman. “Hey, Hadrian,” Draco purred. Hadrian looked up at his mate and smiled at the gesture. “Draco, I’m surprised to see you here.” Draco nudged Hadrian’s face with his own, nuzzling him like a cat. The two snuggled in the grass and gave each other a small peck on the cheek. “Well, it’s not easy to get rid of me,” he taunted. Severus cleared his throat, ruining the mood. “If you two are done lolling around like dogs, we need to get back to training.” Remus gave Severus an offended look. “Really, Severus? You just had to say ‘dog’, didn’t you?” The man looked at him as if he was taking this way too far. “Shut up,” Severus told him. You are a wolf, not a dog.” Remus turned away and folded his arms across his chest. “You know that wolves and dogs are from the same family! So don’t pretend that what you said wasn’t insulting,” Remus shouted. Hadrian and Draco looked at them, watching them act like three year olds. They had enough of the bickering. “Will you two quit it?!” they yelled at them. Severus turned his anger to the boys, eager to put them back in their place. “Stay out of this you two. If you ever try to tell me what to do again, I will whack you on the head with a hammer!” Draco got to his feet and helped Hadrian up. “Mother, what the frick?! And really, we know you are not going to get a hammer and hit us on the head. You don’t have the guts to do that,” Hadrian replied. His mother was starting to get annoyed. He began to march up to them, shouting: “We’ll see about that.” Elaina stopped her brother in his tracks, shielding her nephew and his mate from Severus’s wrath. “Brother, stop this. There is no need to punish them. They were only joking. Also, you could hurt yourself and the baby with such riled up emotions.” Everyone except Hadrian stared at Elaina and Severus, shocked to hear the news. “Hold on,” Remus said. “You…are having a baby?” All eyes were on Severus, waiting to hear his response. He turned to face all of them and realized that his secret was out. He sighed, knowing it was no use to lie. “Yes. I am going to have a baby.” For a minute, the training grounds were silent. The news sunk into everyone’s heads. Instead of the disappointment that he thought he was going to receive, they all ran up and congratulated him. He was bombarded with questions, the next popping up before he could answer the one before. “Do you know its gender yet? How far along are you? Have you decided on any names?” he was asked. Severus backed away from the crowd that was slowly moving closer. He was starting to get overwhelmed by them, making him feel dizzy. Elaina and Hadrian saw what was happening to Severus. “Guys, calm down. Give him some space.” Hadrian started to get worried because no one listened. Severus slid down to his knees, holding his head in his hands. “P-please, stop.” was all he said before falling over, his breathing labored. Elaina rushed to his side and held her brother in her arms. “Tom. I need Tom.” she thought. She rolled up her sleeve and touched the Dark Mark tattooed on her forearm. “Tom, I need you. It’s Severus. He’s having an anxiety attack,” she said. Tom appeared in a puff of black smoke, waving it away to get to his husband. Tom knelt by Severus, picking up his head and held his hand. He saw him trying to get up, but told him to lay back down. “Easy, easy. It’s ok. Just breathe deeply,” Tom said. Severus did what he was told and took deep calming breaths. Tom touched his husband’s neck, feeling his pulse. It was starting to return to its normal rhythm. Tom looked to Elaina and asked her what happened. “Well, Draco and Hadrian were playing around and Severus told them to get back to training. Then, he and Remus started arguing with each other. Hadrian and I tried to stop it, but I then accidentally let the secret slip when I tried to get him to calm down. Everyone started to crowd around him and we tried to stop it, but he started to have an anxiety attack.” Tom glared at everyone, furious that they were not listening to Elaina’s and Hadrian’s warnings. “What is wrong with you people?!” he screamed. “Why didn’t you listen?” Remy stepped up, trying to find what to say. Tom just glared at her and Remy backed away, her ears flat on her head. “Father, let’s take Mother inside. I’m sure everyone has too many questions for him,” Hadrian said as he helped his father to support his mother as they walked back to the manor. Narcissa and Lucius were eating breakfast when they saw Tom and Hadrian supporting Severus as they walked to the stairs. “Hadrian, what happened?” Narcissa asked as she got up, seeing that Severus was very weak. “There’s something my father will need to tell you both.” Hadrian said as he helped his mother up the stairs.
Even though Remy’s eyes were closed, she could see a misty silver light emanating from her mother’s wand. The light started to swirl in the darkness and began to break into tiny bits, like stars in the sky. Remy began to see other things forming. Trees stood tall all around her and she felt the underbrush of grass and dirt beneath her feet. A cool breeze wafted across her face and she was suddenly conscious that the room and her mother disappeared. She looked around at the familiar scenery and realized that this was the forbidden woods. Remy stepped forward and saw that she was no longer a human. Standing on four legs and with fur coating her body, she realized that the human girl was gone and in her place was a wolf. In panic and desperation, she looked around for any sign of help. None came. “It is a feeling that you have never felt before,” a voice echoed. Remy recognized that voice. It was her mother! Thinking that her mother might be close, she ran. She propelled herself faster to catch up to him. Her mother began to talk again. “It will be your comfort. In the night, you will thrive. In your new form, your body will feel light. Your heart will no longer feel fear or hesitation. You will be free; overflowing with strength.” As Remy ran farther through the woods, she saw this to be true. Nature seemed to guide her and the air invigorated her with every breath. In her past visits to the forest, the very essence of the area seemed eerie and haunting. Serving detention during her first year and running from her werewolf mother had made it all the more horrifying. Yet standing as a wolf, none of that bothered her anymore. “Your mind won’t want to believe it. It will tell you that a wolf is invading your body, trying to take over. If you believe that notion, even for a moment, you will black out as you did before and lose control.” When her mother mentioned that, she began to see images of her family and friends injured because of her. They had bite marks all over them and blood spilled nonstop. The world started to spin. She tried to tell herself to make it stop, but it felt like her mind did not want to listen. “But, if you give into the wolf, you will realize the truth. That you are the wolf. A child of the moon. Once you accept that, you will finally be in control.” Remy stepped back, trying to make sense of it all. She stumbled back into a small puddle and it splashed against her. She stepped out of the cold water and shook her paws. In that moment, she caught a glimpse of her reflection. Her wolf’s reflection was breathtaking. Her dark fur blended in with the night and her amber eyes glowed like fireflies. Even though she looked different beyond compare, she noticed one thing that the human and wolf had in common: the light in their eyes. That curious spark inside of her was still the same. She began to see who she was no matter what form she was in. Remy smiled at herself and howled. A golden light began to envelop her and for a brief moment, she saw both the girl and the wolf.
Harry was sitting on his bed when he heard a tap on his window. The young boy looked over and saw an owl.  He smiled a little and opened the window and took the note from the owl and opened it. It was a letter from Griphook telling him to meet him.  Harry left right away and when he arrived he met a goblin named Snaggletooth.
Alira unwillingly stumbled into the Potions classroom. As she entered, a wave of fear washed over her. She saw the Dark Lord himself, Tom Riddle, kneeling over a fire grate. Looking closely, she saw a face in the fire. She recognized it as Lucius Malfoy, Malfoy’s father and one of the Dark Lord’s most powerful Death Eaters. Sitting at a potions table was Headmaster Karkaroff of Durmstrang. Alira remembered hearing whispers from Ron that he used to be a Death Eater before being convicted to Azkaban by Dumbledore. With the three of them present in the room, she had no doubt that they were plotting the downfall of Hogwarts and the ‘impures’ of wizard kind. Tom got up from his spot and walked over to the center of the room, trying to make sense of the spectacle. Severus joined him at his side. Hadrian led her in front of them both, with her trying to squirm away. He swiftly kicked the back of her legs, her knees buckling and forcing her to the ground. “Kneel! You are in the presence of Tom and Severus Riddle, the King and Queen of Darkness.” Alira internally gasped at the revelation. She remembered reading about the King and Queen of Darkness in her studies. They were extremely powerful and influential nobles of the magic community, known for their knowledge and practices of the dark arts: controlling time and space, taking new forms, splintering their souls, and even conquering Death. The tomes never mentioned them by name, and Alira was shocked to see their faces in person, much less know who they are. Alira looked up at the two of them, hatred twisted on her face. “I can see where Hadrian gets a lot of his traits,” Alira snapped. “Ugly,” she looked at Professor Snape, “and evil,” glaring next at the Dark Lord. “I’m not surprised,” she taunted. Tom was infuriated that she was insulting his family; nevertheless, his face remained as passive as a stone. He took a step towards her and bent down to her eye level. Wand in hand, Tom lifted her head with it and forced her gaze into his. She wrenched free from his grasp and spat on the ground in front of him. Tom was surprised by this girl’s bravery. “It talks. I can see why you were placed in Gryffindor. You are very brave for one so small. Brave, yet foolish. If you ever insult me or my family again, I will not hesitate to slit your throat and hang your head as a hall ornament,” he threatened. “Let me guess, your name is something sickening like Bella or Rose or Sophie.” Alira defended against that. “I am Alira of the Gryffindor house. I’m not an ‘it’ and I know what your name is, Lord Voldemort.” Hadrian intervened at that moment. “My father is not to be called by that name anymore,” he spat. Hadrian looked at his father and explained what transpired. “I’m sure you heard of what we were doing father. However, we were ambushed by her in a mysterious room. She took out Valorie, Draco, and Remy single-handedly. Luckily, I was able to knock her out with my magic. For her insolence, I suggested that we maim her. However, Valorie objected.” Tom looked at his daughter. Confused by her actions, his eyes shone with a hint of disappointment. “Why did you do that Valorie? You know that we must cut down anyone who stands against us. I thought you were better than that.” Although Valorie was not physically hurt, her father’s dejected words stabbed her the most. It did not make her falter to defend Alira, for she tried to get him to see what she saw. “Father, when she attacked us, I sensed that she was different. As you know, I have fought against many of Dumbledore’s assassins. When they fight, they fight mercilessly, caring for nothing but themselves. Alira, however, fights with courage and valor. She even helped Hadrian, her ‘enemy’. Her kindness saved Hadrian from his conflicting sides. She treated him with warrior’s honor. It is only right that we do the same.” Tom looked to his mate, hoping that he would get a truthful answer. “Is this true? Did that really happen?” Severus lost his words. He wasn’t there for the fight and could not vouch for what Valorie saw. He could only tell them what he experienced. “I...I don’t...know. When I arrived, the Gryffindor casted a spell on Hadrian. I didn’t know what she was doing, so I shoved her aside. My only concern was helping Hadrian, not looking out for the enemy.” Tom looked back to his son. “That is why we are here, father. Since one of us had objections, we hoped that you and mother together would deliver the proper judgement for her crimes against us.” Valorie was through with her brother pushing her around, despite him being the stronger one. “How is having a conscience and true justice a bad thing, brother?! You wouldn’t know justice if it rolled over your foot!” Alira looked at Valorie with a newfound respect. Maybe not all Slytherins were bad after all. Tom hesitated on scolding his daughter. Her words had sunk in. The look in his eyes had given Valorie hope that she had changed his mind. “Fine, daughter. For you, I shall deliver as you call it, true justice.” Tom returned his gaze to Alira. “Valorie has vouched for you despite what you’ve done. She believes that you can help us. I shall not go back on my word because I greatly love my daughter. Here’s how we will decide your fate. Since many of us want you dead, while Valorie sees you have potential, I’ll be willing to turn my head and give you a chance. Although, we have to see how much you are worth to us. So tell me, Gryffindor warrior, are you prepared to bargain for your life?” Alira was confused. “Bargain...for...my life?” Tom chuckled. “Yes. If you want to live, you have to prove to us that you are not worthless. Now, here are the rules.” In a flash, Tom seized her chest and ripped out her heart. Alira screamed. When her heart left her chest, she could no longer feel the emotions of everyone in the castle. The sounds and feelings she felt in emotions suddenly stopped and was now left in a void of emptiness. Her magic immediately waned, leaving her tired and breathless. Alira’s bound hands touched her chest where her heart was. “What did you do to me?!” she cried. Tom cruelly chuckled at her. Her heart beated in the palm of his hand, its glow ominously illuminating the shadows that fell on his face. “You no longer have your heart. You probably do not know of this magic, so I shall explain it to you. When a witch or wizard pulls out a heart, it becomes enchanted and its owner is forced to obey every command given to them. You will bargain for your life, little warrior. If you do not or if we deem you worthless,” The Dark Lord then placed her heart in Hadrian’s hands, “Hadrian will kill you.” Valorie was about to stop them, but she was held back by Malfoy. “No! Stop this at once! She is not worthless! Hadrian! Just as you had seen the difference in Violet, I have seen a difference in her. Are you really that blind to see that she is good because your hatred for Gryffindor runs deep?” The Dark Lord resumed telling her of the deal. “You will not stall for time. You will not call for help. You will not struggle or fight back. Do any of these things, and all Hadrian has to do is bite.” Hadrian raised her heart to his lips and placed his fangs on it. Immediately, Alira felt like her chest was about to explode. She held her arms close to try and stop the pain to no avail. Hadrian removed his fangs and spoke into her heart to command her. “Bargain for your life, Gryffindor scum! Tell us! Why should we spare your life?” Alira knew of some talents that could save her life. Perhaps that would earn her heart and life back. “I am very talented with magic. The professors here tell me that I am a natural and a quick study. I have learned many spells during my three years here.” Hadrian looked at his father for his response. “Your paltry spells pale in comparison to my children’s powers. Valorie and Hadrian are stronger than the great Merlin and my Death Eaters are the best of sorcerers. Try again.” Alira hoped that would work, ending the bargain quickly. This proved to be tougher than she imagined. “I am a very skilled fighter, able to hold my own in a fight. The Slytherins here know that, especially Hadrian, since I crossed blades with him. Magic alone might not be able to convince you. Allow me to fight by your side. You won’t be disappointed.” He gave it thought, only to retaliate her offer. “My family and I are exceptional fighters. We’ll be fine in holding our own. Next!” Alira thought of another way to be of use. “Throughout the years, I’ve been collecting dozens of Muggle weapons and caring for them for my own uses. I have a multitude of weapons you can choose from. I even crafted one myself. If you don’t want me to fight for you, then take my weapons.” Tom shook his head. “If you didn’t notice, Hadrian and Valorie already have weapons. We don’t need anything made with a Muggle’s shoddy craftsmanship,” Tom bargained hard. This girl had to prove that she was undeniably useful, having something precious that no one else could offer. “If you want information, I can get you information. Let me be your spy. I am an empath and am able to feel the emotions of everyone here.” Alira didn’t know what to say about her sudden break in her empathic powers moments before, but still continued. “I can gather intel from the inside. See what people are feeling. No one would suspect that a Gryffindor would be helping, well...you. I can report any suspicious behavior and potential moves against you.” This time, Professor Snape spoke. “Absolutely not! I will not have you ‘be our spy’, only to rat us out to Dumbledore when the time is convenient to you.” Tom smirked at the girl. “If my mate thinks that it's a bad idea, it is one. Tick tock, little warrior! Rack your brain and try to come up with an excuse to keep living.” Alira thought that those options would satisfy them. Yet, they still turned her down. Those seemed like the only noteworthy abilities that would help sorcerers like them. They still thought her as worthless. Her heart was to be eaten and she would become one of many helpless victims who never stood a chance. Becoming more frightened by that prospect, she blathered out anything she could think of that was useful, something that might save her life. However, each offer she gave became lamer than the previous ones. “I have experience with battle strategy! I know about magic events of the past! I can recruit followers for you!” Tom, Severus, and Hadrian began laughing at her attempts to save her life. Alira knew that her excuses were terrible and they knew it too. “Mmm. Nothing. That’s what I see: nothing. You have one last chance to convince us. Otherwise…,” Tom motioned to Hadrian. Snape was advising Hadrian how he should eat her heart. “I find that most blood pools in the upper chambers. Bite there, my child, and you will have tasted your first heart.” Alira shouted in vain. “I can be your servant! I will devote my life to you if I have to! Please! Give me my heart back! Leave Hogwarts alone! Let me go!” Tom knelt in front of her. He cupped her saddened face in his hands. “And here I had thought we were on the verge of a breakthrough. Wait, no I didn’t. Kill her.” Valorie protested furiously while trying to break free of Draco’s grip on her arms. “No! Father, no! NO! ALIRA!” she shrieked. Alira began to cry. She had no heart. She had no future. She was going to die. What would her family think? She would be leaving her brother sisterless, and her family broken. Alira looked into Hadrian’s eyes and he looked into hers. They watched each other, waiting to see what the next moment would bring. Alira could only see the remorseless face of a monster. That would be the last face she would see before she died. She watched as he once again raised her heart to his mouth, feeling the sharp edges of his teeth graze the glowing heart. The pain was excruciating. Her screams reverberated throughout the classroom. Alira wasn’t able to save her life. Her vision became cloud white, focusing in and out, in and out. She wasn’t able to concentrate, her only focus finding solace in Valorie’s kind pleas for her to be spared and her heartbeats that seemingly echoed louder and louder. Nothing was able to save her. Suddenly, an unexpected thought entered her mind. She didn’t know why, but that thought may it be her best chance to live. Alira never told anyone this, not even her own parents. She promised herself that she would never tell anyone, no matter how trustworthy. Probably going to regret it if she was able to live, she yelled her secret over the pain. “I can enchant weapons to deflect magic!” Everyone’s eyes widened at her scream. Hadrian nearly dropped her heart from the surprise. Alira slumped in shock and relief, gulping tearful breaths. With the exception of Alira’s heartbeat, everything was silent. Tom broke the uneasy tension. “...What?” “I...can enchant weapons...to deflect magic…,” she slowly repeated, gasping for air. Tom and Hadrian didn’t know what to make of that. That little girl, able to enchant weapons to deflect magic spells? Tom bursted out into a fit of laughter. Hadrian followed his father’s example. Then, Snape, Mr. Malfoy, Karkaroff, and Malfoy began laughing at her too. Their cackles confused Alira. “What’s so funny?” she asked them. Tom began composing himself, laughing off his last bout and began to strode around her. “What’s funny, is not only your pathetic excuses, it’s also your overreaching lie to save yourself. How stupid do you think we are? You knew that you were going to die, so you were willing to say anything to save yourself. The first and last time an enchanted weapon was crafted was almost two millennia ago by Godric Gryffindor himself. The Sword of Gryffindor is the only known magic-imbued weapon in the world’s existence. And it’s not like Godric Gryffindor shared his methods with anyone. He took his secrets with him to the grave! You craft enchanted weapons?! It’s ridiculous!” Alira gathered herself, settling back on her knees. “Don’t believe me? Ask your son. He knows what he saw. I can tell when I looked at his face when he saw the weapon.” Both of Hadrian’s parents looked to him, who began backing up from the uneasy stares. “What is she talking about, Hadrian?” Snape asked him. “When-when we were about to battle, I saw her weapon. A sword. It was quite beautiful. The part that threw me off was that it looked like it glowed with a white light. I was quite exhausted from using magic and I thought I was hallucinating. I’ve never seen a sword glow before and I imagined it was all in my head. I’m quite skeptical about her claims, but that would explain why the sword was glowing.” Alira smirked at the Dark Lord, knowing that he would trust his son above anyone else’s statements. She then looked at the far wall where her sword leaned against the wall. Using a potions table as a crutch, she lifted herself from the ground and walked over to grab her sword. Hadrian was just about to stop her, but Tom and Severus held him back, curious to see how this was going to play out. Alira held her sword in her bound hands, the hilt resting easy in her palms. “I made this creation last year. I used the purest of steel to forge the blade, fusing it with silver. Guess I made the right choice with silver. Quite useful in a variety of ways. It’s also what I used to craft the arrowheads I shot at Wolf girl there. That’s why she was knocked out cold.” Remy instinctively placed her hands over the wound. It was still quite fresh and dripped blood. “Wait...that’s what you shot me with?! You could have killed me! Silver harms werewolves!” Alira made a face. “You’re fine and alive, Remy. Silver doesn’t kill werewolves. Only knocks them out for a while. I was surprised you fought its effects and were ok...ish. I’m sorry about that, by the way.” “I accept your apology, Alira. A lot of people in your position would probably scare easy from that too.” Remy said. Alira nodded, glad to clear the air with one person. She resumed talking about how she made her sword. “...I wanted to do something different with the cross guard and decided to braid it. I wasn’t as good of a smithy as I am now, so I learned a metal bending spell as a substitute to magically braid the metal into what you see. As for the stones, I used thulite and shaped it into a butterfly and lunalite for the flower. Once I enacted the ritual, it was able to imbue the sword with its magic properties.” Hadrian internally smiled. She unknowingly gave away her secrets. There was no need for her anymore. With those ingredients, they could perform the ritual without her help and dispose of her. “And...that is how you craft enchanted weapons?” he asked craftily. “Yes. Well, mine that is.” Hadrian’s smile slipped away. “What do you mean ‘yours’?” Alira let out a laugh. Tom and Hadrian shared a look of confusion. “When you guys aren’t threatening me, you sure are funny. I thought it would be obvious to master sorcerers like you,” she quipped. While Tom and Hadrian stood there like boulders, Severus became impatient. “Stop toying with us, Gryffindor girl. What do you mean?” Alira caught her breath and tried to stifle her laughter to explain. “Like a person, every weapon is different. Unique. The ingredients needed and the ritual is different for everyone. Not only do you need to take the caster into account, but also the initial owner of the weapon. Take this for example: I wanted to add rubies instead of those pink gems. When I tried, the spell became unstable and had to stop it before the room blew to pieces. It sensed that the rubies were not the perfect fit for me and would not work well with the sword, so the spell backfired. It’s sad though. Would have wanted fire magic too. Rubies are a bit of my specialty. Imagine what I can do to your scythe.” she said to Hadrian. “If you want me to enchant your weapons, untie me. I also would like my heart back. Also, I want your word that you will not harm innocents in Hogwarts or anywhere else, like Ginny.” Malfoy scoffed. “Do you have rocks for brains? Valorie and Hadrian told you that Ginny is a traitor. She is dangerous, a menace to the future of wizard kind.” His father spoke up from the fire grate. “Tom. You should get rid of her. A deal like that could cost you if you are not careful of her. Besides, it would be a win for us if we are rid of one more pesky Gryffindor,” Lucius advised Tom. Alira was insulted. “Hey! I may be a ‘pesky Gryffindor’, but this pesky Gryffindor is the only one here that can enchant weapons.” She laid her sword up against the wall and crossed her arms as much as they could be. Hadrian went over to talk with his mother, father, and the other Death Eaters. Alira watched as they huddled and whispered away. For a second, Professor Snape hunched over in pain. She watched as he recovered from it. Hoping to get a reading on his emotions, she tried to concentrate on them, but remembered that she could not feel them anymore. The girl lightly brushed it off, thinking it was karma catching up to him. Once the small group disbanded, Hadrian shimmered his scythe to his hand, walked over to her, and held it up. Alira recoiled back, thinking that he was going to strike her head. Instead, he changed direction and split the ropes in two. She gasped at the gesture, shocked that he would be the one to cut her ropes. She rubbed her sore wrists to get the circulation to flow. “You promise you will not do anything to mess up this scythe?” he asked, holding it out to her handle first. “Yeah, I won’t do anything to mess it up…,” Alira said, taking the scythe from him, “...much.” Hadrian wanted to maim her, but held it in. Alira examined the weapon thoroughly. She ran her fingers through every groove and crevice in its hilt. Her hand slided on the blade, her index finger lightly touching the tip of the sharp blade. Testing its balance, she gave it a few swipes. This went on for a few minutes. Getting tired of how long she was dragging it out, the professor interrupted her. “I think you have seen enough of the scythe. Are you able to do it or not?” “Of course I am able to do it. Performing the ritual is the easy part. Getting the right materials for said ritual is the hard part. Like I said: every weapon is unique. Not every weapon needs the same kind or type of materials that I used for mine. Hadrian’s and Valorie’s are no exception. So…,” she held her free hand out towards him. “I’ll be needing my heart back, please.” Snape laughed at her. “No. You don’t need your heart to do your work. My husband said you need to prove your worth to us.” “But-but, I d-did. I told you that I know how to enchant weapons s-so they can deflect magic. That shows I’m useful,” she stammered. “You told us you were useful. You didn’t do anything to prove it. To prove that you are useful to us, you will enchant our weapons, and have it done by the start of the winter holidays.” Alira’s jaw dropped. She stood there, processing what he was asking for. He was asking for a lot. “That’s absurd! Do you know how long it took me just to find my own ingredients for the ritual?!” she vented, waving Hadrian’s scythe around to demonstrate how big of a task this is. “It took me half a year to find the right combination! I went through a lot of trial and error for that. And that is not the only thing I have to do. I have to find a way to correctly combine those ingredients with the weapon. It’s not like I’m forging it from scratch. I also have to prepare the ritual, find the right setting, perform the ritual, while making sure I won’t blow up anything. And it’s not only Hadrian’s weapon I’m doing. It’s Valorie’s and yours, and anyone else’s you want me to do! That could take years to complete.” Snape looked smug when she became frazzled. “Well then! I guess you better get started, little sword smith. And just so you won’t get bent out of shape about where your heart will be…” He walked to one of his shelves lined with potions. He pulled out a small box, gilded with gold, much like the one Hadrian used to store Ron’s heart. The professor placed her heart in the box and closed it, lifting it up to hear her heart softly beat within its walls. “Your heart will stay here. Where we can keep a close eye on it.” Alira threw her hands up in exasperation. “Great! I’m a prisoner.” Hadrian snickered. “What else is new? You were my prisoner since I tied you up.” Valorie rushed to her mother to back away when his eyes flared bright red. “You forgot Valorie. How easily I could just kill your little friend…” Snape’s voice trailed off as his hands began reaching for his stomach. Feeling dizzy, he sat down in the closest seat and tried to wait out the pain. It wasn’t this bad a few minutes ago. He tried to catch his breath. Alira looked at him confused. One second, he was threatening her and Valorie that he could easily end her life any time he pleased. The next, he looked like he was the one whose life would end any second. Professor Snape prided on not displaying weakness. It was both difficult and weird for her to see him in this state. Tom, Hadrian, and the others sprinted to help him, pushing Alira away again. Alira noticed that while everyone was tending to Snape, the box containing her heart was left unguarded. Not wanting to be their servant, she tried to get her heart back. She creeped closer to it, trying not to draw attention to herself. When she was a few inches away from grabbing it, Tom shot her a look. “Don’t even think about it,” he sniped at her, then returning to care for Snape. Alira deflated after her attempt, knowing that if she were to try again, she’d die. Mr. Malfoy would probably alert them from the fire since he had such a good front row view of the action. After a minute, Tom and Hadrian helped Severus to his feet. “We better take him to the hospital wing. Madam Pomferey will know what to do,” Hadrian told his father. “I’ll help,” Draco piped up. “I’ll help your husband get there. If you want, ride on my shoulder in your snake form. That way, you can be there too.” As they marched their way up to the door, Alira shouted out to them. “What about me?!” Hadrian turned around. “You can get started on finding what you need for the ritual. There are plenty of materials here that can probably be of use. Lucius Malfoy and Headmaster Karkaroff will watch you.” As Violet was about to join them, Hadrian asked if she could assist him in a different way. “Violet, do you think you can stay here? Alira’s arm looks like it needs tending to and you're the best with potions.” Violet smiled. “Yeah, Hadrian. I’ll help her. Make sure that professor is ok!” Hadrian turned to Karkaroff next. “Make sure she doesn’t try to get her heart back.” Karkaroff bowed to him in response. “Of course, young Riddle.” Hadrian left Alira behind in the Potions room. “Uggghh! Why did you have to say anything, Alira? Why?” she mumbled berateledly to herself. Her eyes caught Karkaroff and Lucius staring at her every movement. “You can’t get out of this one, Alira. Not now anyways. I better get started before they nag,” Alira said under her breath. She walked to a giant cabinet filled to the brim with magical objects. Opening the wooden doors, she rummaged around, starting her mission to enchant their weapons.
“If the dust covering you is any indication, then yes, I think that really happened.” Draco replied.
Again, Harry felt the anger leaping in his chest, and this time, his mouth was open and ready to strike.
Across his study sat Dumbledore, peering serenely over his half-moon spectacles, surveying Severus with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes.
. I am disgusted by what Vernon tried to do to you and I am deeply sorry that I was unable to help you.” Dumbledore said.
He stayed like that for a moment, lost in the cascading water, but he wanted to talk to Draco, and that meant that he needed to get a move on if they were going to speak any time tonight. With a sigh, Harry started lathering soap up and down his body, letting an errant thought through that this would hopefully be something he and Draco would do one day. He felt himself hardening the longer he let the thought play out and had to really concentrate on what he was doing, or this shower was going to take much longer than he wanted.
Carefully shifting Draco so as not to jostle and wake him, Harry walked up the short flight of stairs and into the house, taking extra care not to bang the sleeping boys head on the frame as he crossed the threshold. He took him up the flight of stairs and to Draco’s bedroom, where he lay him down on top of the covers. As he turned to leave, however, a hand reached out and grabbed his arm.
“Go to Hogsmeade, my son. Floo there and I will be right behind you.” Lucius said, giving him a small, reassuring smile as he offered him the floo-powder.
“The only peace you will ever know will be in death, Dursley. I’ve made sure of that. Try to enjoy the rest of your days, as I’m sure they are limited.” Severus said viciously to a still sobbing Vernon.
This time, there was no hesitation from his teacher and Harry was quick enough to shield and dodge the first few spells that Severus threw. The outcome was the same, however, when his “
Severus liked many things in life, though you wouldn’t know it by his attitude or looks. For example, Severus enjoyed it when someone understood a complex potion in his class and was able to recreate it with no help. He enjoyed it when he could spend all day in his potions room and brew until his back ached. He enjoyed being able to read the Prophet while he had a cup of tea before the sun was up. But he especially enjoyed tormenting Potter whenever the boy presented the opportunity.
“It could have been a horrible marriage, but it worked rather well for both us. In fact, the only bump in the road we really had was when Draco found out. He had woken late one night, just a year before he was due to start Hogwarts. Lucius hadn’t been quite as careful as he usually was when he had another man over, and Draco walked in on them – clothed, thankfully – but he saw enough to know that Lucius wasn’t being faithful. I won’t bore you with the details, but it wasn’t easy getting Draco to accept that that was how things were.
“Sorry, Draco… I just.” Harry started, before sighing again. “I just let myself hope for something that I shouldn’t have. And I felt like a first-year, all over again, staring into the Mirror of Erised… I keep hoping that I’ll somehow be able to talk to them, my parents, and I know it’s childish, and I want it so fucking bad… But, Remus was, I don’t know, kind enough to let me know that my parents probably didn’t have time to get portraits done before, well, you know what.
“You see, Potter, I am allowing you to see only what I want. If I wanted you to see a memory, it could be easily done.” Professor Snape said. “For example…”
“I’ll kill him, Harry. If you want him dead, I’ll do it. No one will ever know.” Draco said, pulling back from him.
“Draco, wait. Potter Manor is located at 212 Sampford Arundel, Somerset, UK. I would appreciate it if you considered this your house as much as mine. I’m really sorry, I meant to tell you sooner, but Sna- Severus had me occupied for a few days. I hope we can catch up later?” Harry reeled off.
They didn’t talk much during dinner. Everyone was hungry and the food was delicious. They had all had seconds of everything, and Harry was pretty sure he could eat a third burger if he really wanted to.
“Tell me what’s going on, Harry. I will do everything in my power to help you, whatever it is.” Draco said.
“Yes Lord Riddle.” Snaggletooth led Hadrian and his father to the Riddle vault.  Hadrian put the rings on and they all morphed into a single ring.  Then he put the Hogwarts ring and the Black ring on.  His father gathered the money for his son and handed the pouch to the boy.  They then made their way back to Severus and went to Diagon Alley to get Haardrian some new clothes.  Hadrian picked out a black formal top with black pants (similar to what Snape would wear minus the black cape) and he also picked out black converses.  He’s a total emo so what.
Hadrian was surprised to hear how kind and sweet his parents were. He always thought of them as stern and strong-willed people. With what his dad told him, he found a new side to his parents: the kind and gentler side. Not the sides that he had grown used to. “I had no idea…” Hadrian whispered. Tom nodded his head. “Before you and Valorie were out of our lives, we were different. We had lived our lives happily and care-free. However, the day that you were taken and that we had to give your sister to your aunt broke our hearts. It changed us to the people we are today. We learned from our pain and became strong. That pain made us grow colder. We used everything we had to find you, but it was in vain. We had lost all hope, until you found us. Now, you and your sister made it back home. And that is all that matters.” Tom hugged his son, holding him as if he was that small infant all those years ago. Moments later, the others walked in. Remy lightly chatted with her parents, while Elaina and Valorie were constantly teasing Draco. Hadrian was glad that his family was getting along, sort of. “What are you doing?” Tom asked them. “Well, we’ve been thinking about our situation,” Remy said. “We thought about how we never learned the truth about our families until now.” Valorie stepped in, determined to find the truth. “And we want answers. About how Hades and I were separated. Why Dumbledore is hunting us…” Remy interrupted her, the thought plaguing her mind was finally going to be answered. “And why Hadrian and I were given false names and backgrounds.” Tom sighed, knowing that this was coming sooner or later. “Questions. They always come in threes,” he joked. The teenagers glared at him, conveying that this was serious. “Ok, ok. I’ll tell you the truth.” Elaina gave him a side glance, reminding him of what they promised earlier. Tom nodded slightly, ready to tell them the truth. “When Hadrian and Valorie were born, we were attacked by the Order of the Phoenix. They found out about our children and wanted to kill them. Hadrian, Valorie, your powers are far greater than you think. With your mother’s and my bloodlines flowing within you, you have been blessed with great power, ones that are even said to surpass Merlin. The Order feared that you would one day use that power to overthrow Dumbledore, so they decided to try and kill you. We fought back, but it was not enough. They started pushing us back, getting closer to you. We didn’t want them to harm you, so Severus asked his sister to take you both into hiding. Your aunt was successful in taking you away from the battlefield Valorie, but the Order got to Hadrian before she did. They had us on our knees with wands at our throats, making us watch them kill you Hadrian. Suddenly, Dumbledore changed his mind. He thought that if he took you away, it would make us suffer far worse than killing you. So, he stole you in the night and burned our home to the ground. His conquest later took him to the Lupin-Black household, and took Remy from her family, fearing that her powers would destroy him. Dumbledore had told the press that I had gone crazy and brought destruction wherever I went. People have feared me since then. He later placed those spells and blocks with Molly Weasley, trying to conceal who you really are. He then asked his associates, McGonagall and Hagrid to take you to your new ‘families’ and made sure that you never found out the truth.” The three looked at Tom with shock. They never thought that Dumbledore could be so cruel. Tom continued his story. “Now that you know the truth, we need your help to defeat him. His rampage has gone on long enough. We can help you harness your newfound powers so when you challenge him, you will be stronger than ever. We have to stop Dumbledore. We cannot have him hurting our family ever again.”
Draco never thought that anyone could look that handsome, until he met Hadrian. His flowing jet black hair was like the celestial night sky, dark and sparkling. His facial features were perfectly designed, probably carved by a sculptor. Hadrian’s red eyes glowed mischievously in the light, as if he had a dark secret kept close to his heart. Draco was slightly staring at him, trying not to be so awed by his looks. “Draco, you’re staring.” Hadrian had noticed that his mate was staring at him. “Sorry Hades.” Draco turned his head as a heavy blush appeared on his face. Hadrian was about to say something when they heard a knock on the door. “I’ll be right back, Hadrian.” Draco got up from his seat at the dining table and walked to the door. When he opened the door, he saw a girl who was the same age as Hadrian and looked just like him. “ Hello. Is this the Malfoy Manor?” Draco gave the girl a questioning look. “Yes, and who would you be?”  “Oh sorry, that was rude of me. I’m Valorie. Valorie Riddle, Hadrian’s older twin sister.”
While cradling Amelia in his arms, Severus conjured a cradle to put her in when he was teaching. Amelia reached for Severus’s arms and burbled sounds, trying to convey that she wants to be picked up again. “After class, I will hold you again. Just relax, little one.” Amelia was comforted by Severus’s voice and stopped making noises. The man turned to his class, the first class of this year. “Welcome back to another year. Let's try to make this as fun as we can.” He summoned each table a cauldron. “We are going to make the Draught of the Living Death. Now, can anyone name its ingredients?” He saw that his son’s hand shot up along with Remy’s. He remembered that they were talking about this the first time they met. “Yes, Hadrian?” Hadrian incited two of the ingredients that he remembered. “It has a powdered root of asphodel and an infusion of wormwood.” Severus smiled. Those two ingredients were most crucial to making the potion. “Correct. Remy, can you name the rest?” Remy beamed in delight, knowing she could answer the question. “Certainly. The other ingredients are valerian sprigs, sloth brain, and the juice of a Sopophorous Bean.” When Remy was naming them, Severus wrote them on the board and how much to mix in. “Good job, Remy and Hadrian. These are the ingredients for this potion. I want you to make this. The students who make their potion as accurate as possible to the recipe will get an A. Go grab your ingredients,” Severus ushered. The Slytherins scrambled to the cabinets, racing each other to get the potion done quickly. Hadrian and the others quickly got their ingredients and started their potion. Severus surveyed the students from his desk, rocking Amelia in his arms. She fell asleep, snoring cutely. Occasionally, she would toss and turn slightly, dreaming in her sleep. “She’s so adorable,” Severus thought. How could anyone abandon such an adorable bundle of cuteness? Someone like Ginny, who was heartless did. Every day, Severus promised her that she would be taken care of and not be abandoned because she was very loved. Severus held her to his chest, keeping her warm and comforted. Unconsciously, she smiled at the warmth. Severus rested Amelia in the crook of his arm and placed his free hand on his stomach. He thought about his unborn child, excited to see him or her when the time comes. He thought about some baby names to pass the time. “Emma, Chase, Hunter, William. I wonder what gender it is going to be…” Hadrian calling him interrupted his thought process. “Mother! We are done.” Severus walked over to their table. He didn’t want Amelia to be affected by the potion, so he turned to Hadrian. “Can you hold her for a second as I test your potion?”  Hadrian took his adopted sister with a smile. “Of course I’ll hold her.” As Severus made his way to their table, he noticed that most of the girls were staring at Amelia. “If any of you want to see her, you may. But try not to scare her, please.”  The girls squealed with excitement as they quickly finished their assignment. Severus turned his attention to his son’s table to check his work. Once inspecting the potion, he smiled and turned to his son. “Good job you four. Perfect score. 20 points to Slytherin. As he finished, many others had finished as well. “Professor, may I please hold your daughter?” Severus turned his attention to a girl, seeing that it was Pansy. “You may as long as you’re careful.” Severus watched as Pansy made her way over to Hadrian, who handed Amelia to Pansy, knowing that his mother was watching their every move. After checking everyone else’s work, for the rest of class, the boys were chatting while most girls were cooing over Amelia, who was still in Pansy’s arms. “Mother, do you want to sit down?” Severus turned to his daughter, who was sitting with Remy. Valorie gave him a concerned look, making sure he is not overexerting himself in any way. “Sure,” he said reluctantly. As much as he did not want to appear weak, he had to be cautious in what he was doing. He sat down and relaxed in his chair. After getting comfortable, he noticed that some students were staring at him. They knew that there must be something wrong because they knew that their teacher was always attentive and standing. “Professor, are you ok?” a boy asked him. “I’m fine,” Severus responded. “Just a little tired.” The students knew that there was more than he was letting on, so they pried for answers in a subtle way. Pansy turned to Severus, bobbing back in forth to rock Amelia. “Professor? Um, I was wondering if you can tell us about your children. Apparently, we knew nothing of their existence until now. And I hope you can tell us how you adopted little Amelia here.” Severus predicted that he was going to have to spill the story sooner or later. That time was now. “Before I tell you, I need you to lock all the doors. No one can know what I am about to tell you.” All the students sprang from their seats and locked the window or door that was closest to them. “Colloportus!” They all said to lock the openings. Severus knew that there were nosy ghosts and students lurking around, so he took initiative to keep his information under wraps. Once every door and window was locked, the students took their seats, waiting to hear Severus’s story. “Ok, before I tell you everything, this is what is going to happen. After we finish our work with Potions, the second half of the class will be me telling you about the secrets I am going to share right now. This information is crucial, so I don’t want anyone blabbing about it to anyone as soon as class is over. Got that?” The students nodded obediently, not wanting to betray their teacher’s trust. “Good. You all know that Valorie and Hadrian are my kids and their father is Tom Riddle. That they are the heirs of Slytherin and my pride and joy. You all might be wondering how come I never told you about them. The truth is that I didn’t know that they would ever return to us.” The rest of Slytherins looked confused “What do you mean that you thought they would never return?” Goyle asked, scratching his head like an unintelligible ape. Severus shot him a look to be quiet. He did not like it when anyone interrupted him. “I was getting to that Goyle, thank you. I must let you know that Dumbledore is not the person you think he is. He appears to be a nice man, but in reality, he is a demon. He is the reason why Hadrian and Valorie were taken from me. When the both of them were just newborns, Dumbledore and his goons invaded my home. Tom, my sister, and I fought as hard as we could, trying to force them out. I was too weak, due to giving birth a few hours earlier. Unfortunately, they overpowered us and pushed us further in. They came into the nursery and tried to take them. I told my sister to take the two of them and flee as far as she could. But, she was only able to save Valorie. Dumbledore got to Hadrian and wanted to kill him. Their objective was to kill the both of them, for they hold great power within themselves. I told Dumbledore to leave him alone for he was just a baby, but then they changed their minds about killing him. Instead of ending Hadrian’s life, they decided to take him away from me, to make sure I suffered every waking moment knowing that he was taken. He succeeded. I hoped that one day that I would be reunited with my children. A month ago, they found us. Since then, we planned to stop Dumbledore from his cruelty. The attack that happened here was no accident. My husband and I decided that now was the time for revenge. Moody was there when he attacked us, the one who gave Dumbledore the idea to kill my children, so we decided to kill him first. We hope to take our revenge further, to stop the ones who wronged us fourteen years ago.” Severus stopped his story, taking a breath. Already, the fourth-years were shocked. They had hated Dumbledore for his unorthodox ideas of giving mudbloods and squibs the chance of learning here. Now, they despised him for hurting their teacher and others. “Professor, are you also the ones who killed Potter and Granger? Did they wrong you too?” Blaze asked him. Severus didn’t know how his students were going to react to this, but he thought that they deserved the truth. “Harry Potter and Hermione Granger did no wrong. In fact, they are here with you right now.” The Slytherins looked around, trying to see where they might be hiding. No one seemed to understand what Severus was saying. “Where are they?” they asked. Hadrian and Remy stepped forward from the still crowd, all eyes on them. “We’re right here,” the two said. The Slytherins inspected the two of them, noticing similarities they had not seen before. “Wait, wait, wait,” Pansy said, trying to catch up. “You are Harry and Hermione?” They nodded. Everyone gasped, realizing who they were being mean to. The other Slytherins were shooting out apologies one after another, trying to earn forgiveness from their former enemies. Remy and Hadrian accepted their apologies to the Slytherins’ surprise. Severus got their attention again, calming them down. Crabbe raised his hand to get Severus’s attention. “Professor, how did Hermione become Remy?” Did Dumbldore do something to her too?” Remy decided to answer that one for herself. “I’ll tell you. Dumbledore took me away from my family. He also feared my power, just as he did with Hadrian and Valorie. When he stole me, he placed blocks on me to keep who I am a secret. Those blocks turned me into Hermione Granger. They did the same to Hadrian and that’s what turned him into Harry Potter.” Everything made a lot more sense once Remy explained that. How Harry and Hermione did not want to hate the Slytherins, but were forced to by some unknown power. The Slytherins felt they had been overloaded with information. They still had more questions, so they started to ask. “Professor, you still never told us how you adopted Amelia,” Pansy said to Severus. Pansy held the little bundle of joy as she slept, completely unaware of the drama that was happening in the room. “About three days ago, I found Amelia being abandoned in the woods. I didn’t want her to be eaten by the wolves, so I took her in.” Pansy was disgusted that someone would do that to an innocent baby. “Who would do such a thing?” Pansy asked, her tone filling with hate. “Ginny Weasley.” Everyone but Hadrian, Valorie, Remy, Draco, and Severus were speechless. When they did speak, it was one giant scream. “WHAT?!” Remy covered her ears, sensitive to the sound because of her wolf hearing. “Please don’t yell,” she told them. “Besides, you might wake Amelia.” Luckily, she was a deep sleeper and did not wake up from the loud noise. “Sorry, but that is just wrong,” Pansy whispered harshly. “No one should do that to a child. That Weasley girl will pay for what she has done.” Severus agreed with her, remembering when he threatened Ginny. “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she does.” Severus looked around and spotted Tom in the corner of the room. He acknowledged his presence by nodding to him. The Slytherins thought that was weird. “Uhhh, professor? What are you doing with that snake?” Blaise pondered. “That ‘snake’ isn’t a snake, but a human in their animagus form. Everyone, please meet Tom, my husband.” Everyone’s heads turned to the snake who was waving at them with his tail. “Hi!” he hissed. Hadrian could hear his father, so he translated to the others. “He says: hi. And father, return to your human form. You’re creeping them out.” Tom reverted back to his human form, his scales shimmering back into his body. “Hello.” The Slytherins jumped back, startled to see the snake turn into a human, into Tom Riddle himself. “It’s nice to meet you all.” That made the students uncomfortable. Severus noticed it and tried to put them at ease. “Don’t worry. He won’t harm you guys despite what you might think. Besides, he is very sweet.” Tom playfully nudged him, knowing that Severus was just flattering him. “Stop it. You only say that to make me look good. Besides, have you told them yet?” Severus looked away, the silence answering Tom’s question. “Oh. So you haven’t. You tell them about the others and not our tiny surprise?” The students became confused again. “Tell us what? What surprise?” they asked Tom and Severus. “Please calm down, I'll tell you.” Severus noticed how Tom and his children stood close, ready to stop the others from crowding around him. “As you all know, I’m able to bear children.” Severus closed his eyes. “I’m pregnant again.” He opened his eyes and saw that the class's eyes were wide in shock. They started to ask questions at once when Tom snapped at them, his eyes glowing harshly. “Alright, one question at a time. Your stressing Severus out.” The others quiet down when Astoria Greengrass decided to break the silence with a question. “How is this possible? I mean, you’re not even a female.” Severus looked to see who was talking and saw that it was Astoria. “This may come as a surprise, but I’m a vampire. As you all know, my parents were Tobias Snape and Eileen Prince.” The class nodded and he continued. “My mother was a pure-blooded vampire, my father a muggle. My mother wanted to keep the tradition of having a pure-blooded vampire child, so she turned my father into one. That was how the pure-blood line continued. I took on more of my mother than I did my father. With that being said, I was born with more feminine traits, such as my height, my personality, and even my body. My body functions more like a female’s than a male’s. I may look like a male, but I’m a female on the inside.” The students became intrigued by their teacher’s history. Even Valorie and Hadrian were surprised. This was the first time he said anything about his parents and why his body is the way it is. “As for you Hadrian. You’re just like me.” Severus glanced at his son to see his reaction. Hadrian tried to hide his face from the other’s view. It turned beet red from embarrassment. He gave his mother a ‘why did you have to say that in front of everyone’ look. As much as he appreciated the information, it seemed like this topic should have been said in private. “Calm down, Hadrian. I will give you more details when we are alone,” Severus consoled. Hadrian was able to relax a little now that he knew his mother was not going to go into extreme detail. Severus heard the clock tower’s bell ring, realizing that class is already done. “You all did great today. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. We will pick this up tomorrow. You have no homework, so you can relax. I will see you at tomorrow’s class. If you have any questions I will happily answer them.” The students were ready again to ask Severus about his baby, but Tom gave them his glowing glare again. “You can ask your ‘baby questions’ tomorrow,” Tom said, taking Amelia from Pansy. “Unless it is about schoolwork, Severus has had enough questions for the day.” He shooed the Slytherins out the door except for his children, Remy, and Draco. The four of them were the last ones to pack up. Hadrian gave his mother another glower. “Seriously, mother? You had to say that in front of all my classmates?” Severus looked at his son’s face, who expressed that was going to hang over his head for quite some time. “I thought you deserved to know, son. Besides, I think that tidbit might help you get ready for your future,” he said as he nodded in Draco’s direction. Hadrian was immediately reminded of the embarrassing picture his mother took a month ago, embarrassing both Draco and himself. “That’s it. We’re out of here. We will see you when classes are over.” Hadrian dragged the other three out the door, slamming it behind him. Tom raised a knowing eyebrow at his mate, wondering why in the world he made his son mad. “I had to tell him sometime,” was all he said.
“Stupefy!” Draco blasted the practice dummy across the room. Remy clapped at his performance. “That was great. Now I want to see that happen with you standing near the entrance. Make sure your aim is precise. I’ll set up the dummy as you get ready.” Draco rolled his wrist a few times before heading towards the door. He aimed his wand around the room as practice. “Ok! Fire away!” With it propped back up, Draco channeled his magic to hit it in the face. “Stupefy!” he yelled again. The dummy went flying in the air again, flipping around until it hit the wall. The loud bang was startling as everyone looked up to see it smack the wall. Hadrian grumbled a little before he resumed what he was doing. “Much better!” Remy told him. “You sure? It looked a lot like the last one. Just a lot, lot louder.” Valorie came to his side to point out what he was doing. “Your arm is too tense. The reason you have to channel the magic more is because you’re not relaxing. Just Let the magic flow. It’ll come.” Remy also offered her advice. “He isn’t channeling enough. If you noticed, his shots sometimes go out of alignment before it reaches the target. Channel more, Draco. You got this.” Valorie and Remy quarreled about what he was doing wrong as they reset his target. As they went to go do that, he went to go take a peek at what Alira was doing. She was sitting at a lone desk, writing down lists and organizing her papers. He propped himself on the back of her seat, blocking the light she needed to work. “Go away. Don’t you have something to do?” she snapped. “Nope. I can do this all day. That attitude of yours definitely won’t sit with Hadrian or Tom.” He swiped one of her papers from under her quill. Alira pushed away her chair and snatched it back, scoffing at him. As she resumed her work, he leaned on her shoulder. “What are you even doing anyway? You aren’t even forging the weapons,” he criticized. “I’m planning everything out. Things like this take time. Now, go away and do your magic….Maybe I can use that.” He didn’t leave. Instead, he leaned on her further which annoyed her more. “So, I am thinking the reason why you are acting the way you are right now is because you have become an ordinary witch.” He hugged her closer which made her really uncomfortable and irritated. “Think about it,” he quipped. “You, Alira Silverstone, a powerful witch in Gryffindor, is able to nearly defeat everyone in this room. With your weapons and empathic magic, you were strong. Indestructible. But now, it’s hard for you to do magic. I’m just guessing right now, spitballing really, but I think I have figured out the reason: your heart. Or rather, your lack of it. I’ve heard that empaths are able to easily channel their feelings into their magic, making it easy for them to perform it. But, you lost your heart and the ability to fully feel. Without it, it's harder for you to do magic. Am I right?” Alira lost it and elbowed his ribs. He let go of her, but was unimpressed at her strength. “Really?” About to hurt him even more, she readied her fist to punch him. “Sit down. Get back to work, Alira,” Hadrian shouted from his side of the room. Her punch stopped halfway as she unwillingly began to sit down. Trying to fight his command, she tried to maintain her stance, but wasn’t able to resist and slumped back in her chair. “You’re the worst,” she remarked. “Draco! Come on! Hit the target again. Hope you don’t miss it!” Valorie said, pointing at the dummy. Leaving Alira to do her thing, Draco positioned himself with his wand out. Relaxing his arm and channeling his magic, the tip of his wand ignited and a big blast sent the dummy soaring away. “That was amazing!” Remy yelled over the bang. The loud sound made everyone jump again. Hadrian was getting quite annoyed at the interruptions. “Can you all do something that’s not ear shattering? I’m busy over here.” Hadrian was sitting cross-legged on a cushion, holding his wand out towards a teacup. A Transfiguration spell book was open next to him. Remy and Valorie came to check on his progress as Draco repositioned the worn out dummy. Hadrian calmly let out a breath as he focused his magic. The wand’s tip fizzled a little bit, but began to steadily glow. “Oh! You almost had it,” Valorie squealed. His wand stopped glowing and his focus now elsewhere. “Will you stop distracting me?!” he sniped. “Sorry, but there was definitely some sort of glow-y action happening there,” Valorie pointed to his wand. Remy tried to encourage him. “Come on, Hadrian. You can’t let distractions keep you from transfiguring this thing. You can do it,” she added. “What’s going on?” Draco asked, walking over to them. Seeing as they were piled over near Hadrian, he joined in. “Ooh! Are we messing with Hadrian?” he said, jumping onto his mate’s lap. He snuggled into him, getting comfortable while Hadrian looked at him incredulously. “Draco, do you have to sit right there? And why are you being more annoying than usual?” With a big grin on his face, he slyly smiled like a cat. “Hey! I’m not doing anything,” he refuted. “Hadrian! Concentrate!” Remy advised. “Yeah Hadrian, concentrate,” Draco said in a mocking voice. He readjusted himself, putting more weight on Hadrian’s wand arm. Frustrated that they were bothering him, Hadrian let out a low growl. “You know, Draco? One of these days, I’m going to turn you into a ferret.” He shook Draco off of his arm and held it back out to the teacup. Valorie whispered some more encouragement. “You can do it, Hades.” Blocking out everything, Hadrian kept in mind the teacup and the magic flowing through him. A golden glow circled his wand and began to trail to the teacup and change its shape. Its porcelain started to become furry. Draco, Remy, and Valorie watched with bated breath at his wordless magic. “Hello!” Violet sang as she burst through the door. The teacup, in the middle of transforming, returned to its original state. Hadrian groaned. “I am never going to get this spell out,” he angrily thought. “Hi everyone. Why are you all over there?” she asked as she set down her bag, vials clinking against each other. “I’m trying to do this complex, high-level transfiguration spell wordlessly, but for some reason, something happens to ruin it.” Violet stopped for a second, but then resumed taking out her stuff. “Ok, I’ll be over here. I just need to heat this one potion up. I am so glad there is a burner in here.” Her potion bubbled, each little bubble popping as loud as a firecracker in Hadrian’s mind. “Violet, do you have to do this here?” he sighed. “I did it earlier before I left, but it got cold. I’m just reheating it.” With all his might, he blocked out his surroundings, imagining that it was only him and the teacup. His wand glowed brightly, the golden light swiveling around the teacup again. The transformation was a little faster than before. The fuzz grew and it became a more round shape. It was almost finished, its new form beginning to materialize. Hadrian held his breath a little, almost finished. Poke! Draco’s finger poked at his cheek. “Bah!” Hadrian screamed in surprise. His wand moved from its position and was now pointed at Draco. The spell on the teacup transferred over to him and transfigured him into a small, white ferret. Valorie, Remy, and Hadrian looked at each other, then at Draco the ferret who was now chittering angrily at Hadrian. “Is that...Draco?” Violet asked from her spot at the desk. She and Alira got up from their desks. Draco’s ferret began to move in circles, his tail lolling behind. Hadrian busted out laughing and everyone else followed suit. They watched him chase his tail and run around. “This is both the cutest and funniest thing I have seen all day,” Remy wheezed. They watched Draco stumble around a bit more, laughing at the cuteness of it. “Here, let me turn you back to normal Draco.” Hadrian couldn’t help but giggle at his boyfriend as he cast a spell to turn him back to normal. The spell to revert Draco to his normal form than the one that turned the cup and then him into a ferret. Draco stood back up on his two legs, shaking off the excess fur that clung to his robes. “What the heck, Hades! I was playing with you. And for that, I was turned into a ferret?!” he snapped. “I didn’t mean to. You broke my concentration and then the spell transferred over to you. Don’t blame me for that,” Hadrian reasoned. Draco wasn’t going to let him get away with it though. No one turns him into a ferret and gets away with it, even if it was an accident or on purpose. He briskly flipped his wand into his hand and pointed it into Hadrian’s face. Hadrian looked at the wand, then at Draco. “What are you doing? I said it was an accident.” Draco concentrated and his wand glowed bright. The light hit Hadrian and turned him into a small black snake. Hadrian wiggled around, sometimes his face flopping on the floor. “That’s for turning me into a ferret, Hades!” Draco smirked. The others watched him slither and flop around, hissing loudly at them and mostly Draco. The group got another bout of laughter and were cracking up at the funny scene. Draco turned when the doors opened and saw Severus and Tom walking in. They looked at them and realized that their son was missing from the room. “Where’s Hadrian?” Tom asked them. The rest were laughing so hard, they couldn’t stop to respond to his question. Draco on the other hand, tensed up as he realized he got busted, but he wasn’t sorry for transfiguring his mate. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the snake. Severus and Tom looked down at the little creature, processing that they were looking at their child. Severus’s motherly instincts took over and tried to find who would do this to his child. “Who did this? Who turned my son into a snake?! Was it you, you sorry excuse for a Gryffindor?!” Alira was still laughing from earlier. “Hahahaha, I wish! It was so funny! I should have thought of something like this earlier.” He was shocked that the Gryffindor girl wasn’t the one who turned his son. She had an explainable reason to, after all. “Well, if it wasn’t the girl, and it wasn’t anyone else, who turned Hadrian into a snake?” Valorie tried to calm down and tell her parents, yet to no avail for Hadrian did another funny flop. To get her point across, she pointed at Draco. Tom and Severus turned their heads slowly and looked at Draco with a confused and angered look. “Draco,” Tom started, “did you turn our son into a snake?” he said quite calmly. Draco’s eyes shifted around. He tried to not look guilty, but he was doing a bad job at it. “All right. Fine! I turned Hadrian into that. But he deserved it. He turned me into a ferret! If you want to blame someone for this, blame him.” Hadrian the snake hissed at his parents. Tom was able to understand everything he said. “Don’t listen to him. It was an accident. I swear! I was practicing and then he distracted me. Turn me back! I don’t like being this small.” Tom turned him back, a loud crack echoing throughout the room. Hadrian stared at Draco intensely. His hair was frazzled. He blew it a piece out of his face, only to have it fall back right where it was. Draco stared back with a victorious smile. Immediately, the two of them got into a loud shouting match. “You turned me into a snake!” Hadrian sniped. “Your spell was not an accident, you liar. You started everything first!” Draco shot back. It only got louder and louder from there. The fight escalated to the point where they drew their wands at each other. Not wanting an accident on their hands, Severus quickly disarmed them. “Expelliarmus!” he screamed. Their wands fell to the ground with a clatter, the room now in silence. “Enough, both of you!” Severus told them. “This is unacceptable. You should not be acting like toddlers, fighting with each other in petty arguments. I expected much more from you.” Hadrian and Draco looked at the floor, both not wanting to meet Severus’s disappointed face. “Sorry…” Draco mumbled to his mate. Hadrian turned away, vehemently muttering under his breath. With that out of the way, Severus and Tom took in the room. “I’m surprised that we never found this room after all these years, Severus.” Tom told his mate. “I agree. I remember every nook and cranny I took refuge in, but this is one I wish I would have found. It’s quite cozy. It’s a wonder we never found it, Tom.” They turned to Alira who was handing back Draco and Hadrian’s wands to their respective owners. “How did you find this room, little girl? I think we deserve an explanation.” She turned to them with a weird look. “Well, I actually didn’t find this room. It found me, if that makes any sense.” “How can a room find you? It’s a room.” Severus stated. “It’s actually pretty interesting. I even remember the day it happened. It was about four years ago, a few months after I arrived at Hogwarts. I was having a pretty rough week. Classes were getting harder, and I remember being up to my elbows in homework. I also didn’t have any friends, so I really had no one to talk to. I usually did my work in the common room, but it was crowded and it got pretty loud late in the day. It was annoying me one day, so I packed up my bag and took a walk around the castle to clear my head. When I got to the corridor here, I remember leaning against the wall to relax. Then, I remember thinking to myself ‘I wish there was a place I could be by myself. To focus on my schoolwork, train without distractions, and relax in peace.’ I looked up, and then I saw the huge door that you entered. When I walked in, I found all of this,” Alira gestured to the room around her. “All this equipment was already here. The desks, the potions set, the rope, the practice dummies, the boxes, the bookshelf, that super incredibly soft couch with the big cushions, EVERYTHING was already here. I just sort of moved in.” Hearing her explanation, Remy jumped into the conversation. “That sounds quite familiar. I remember reading about something like that in a book. If this room is what I think it is, this is the Room of Requirement,” she conjectured. “What is that, Remy? I have studied quite a lot of history about Hogwarts itself and I have not heard about anything of the such,” Tom asked her. “It’s one of the very few magic rooms placed around Hogwarts. The reason that very few have found it is because they wanted a place for a specific reason, and Hogwarts gave it to them.” She turned to Alira and began to speculate about her situation. “When you found this place, Alira, you said that you wished to find somewhere you could study, train, and relax. That must be why the Room revealed itself to you, already filled with everything you could possibly need. For us, Hadrian said he remembers thinking that he wants a room to train and hone our powers. That sounds quite similar to your wish, so it made that same Room appear for us! That’s incredible!” Remy remarked. “How did you find out about this, Remy?” Valorie asked her. “Back at the Malfoy Manor before we came to Hogwarts, I was reading some textbooks. You have seen me read them, Val.” Valorie thought back at their time. She remembered playing with her wand at breakfast, watching her girlfriend read a bulky textbook. “So that’s what you were reading! There were others with similar covers. I helped you pack them into your trunk. Those were really heavy. How many of those books did you pack?” Valorie questioned. “I packed ten of them. I wanted to bring more, but the others couldn’t fit, so I settled for that. It has supplied me with enough reading, though. I only got through three of them.” Valorie stared at Remy dumbstruck. “Three of those things? They are big! About how many pages are in there?” Remy did the math for the many volumes she got. “Well, each book has about 200 pages, give or take the length of summary at the end,” she quipped. Valorie leaned in and gave her a look. “Uh-huh. Out of how many volumes in total, again?” Remy stood quiet for a second. “...out of forty-eight volumes in total. Why are you complaining, though? You don’t read them. Although, those books could have been a lot longer. But it wouldn’t be called ‘A Brief Recapitulation of Hogwarts Lore’ if it wasn’t for its small size,” Remy said. “Brief?! Small?!” Valorie laughed. “Laugh it up, Val. But back to the thought at hand, one thing the book does not specify is how the Room comes to aid its user. In the book, it said that the Room will choose those who are worthy and will use the Room for the right purposes. I wonder what it means….” Remy thought about it for a little while, sorting through the possible theories and already known facts. She decided to drop the topic for now. Severus and Tom began to tour themselves around the new training grounds. As Valorie said, it was quite spacious. They inspected the sectioned out spaces. They were mildly surprised that it was up to their standards. “So, is this to your liking, Your Majesties?” Alira asked sarcastically. “It’s quite alright,” Tom told her, “although I wonder why you’re here.” Tom shooed her away to her corner, leaving him and Severus alone for the moment. “We have to keep a place like this a secret, Sev. That little girl may not have blabbed to anyone about her secret hideaway, but she might now that we have occupied it. I can tell she doesn’t want to leave and we are not planning to either.” Severus nodded to him. “My thoughts exactly. I’ll be sure to command her to not speak a word of this to anyone. But, I am more worried about the others. I don’t want unsuspecting students to stumble upon here when our children enter.” Tom agreed. They both worked out a plan to make sure no one else saw this room. As Hadrian and the others began to practice their magic together, Severus and Tom walked around a little more. Near the edge of the Room, both of them sensed a mysterious air, something that seemed long forgotten to the world. “Something’s there on the other side,” said Severus. Behind a large ornate tapestry was a wall with cracked carvings. The wall didn’t look like a place of interest; it looked like a child scribbled on it with a sharp stick. Inspecting it further, they realized the carvings made the shape of a crude looking keyhole. Tom opened the folds of his robes and took out his wand. “Alohamora,” he said.
Harry slowly got to his feet, but his excitement was plastered on his face, ready to start planning the trip to Diagon Alley.
“What my son does and who he does it with is his own business. I would not deign to interfere with whatever was, or wasn’t, going on there. However, I do wish to caution you. He is struggling with the loss of his father, and I would truly hate to see you get hurt by the fallout of that.” She said.
Severus looked at Harry, and for a second, Harry thought he was going to yell at him. However, a smile broke out on the older man’s face.
He found no sign of anything else, but the feel of dark magic still hung in the air. Whoever had captured Vernon had made him suffer; tortured him for who knows how long before taking him back to the Dark Lord. Severus shook his head and returned to the hallway where he met Dumbledore coming down the stairs.
Harry laid there panting heavily. He looked down and saw Draco wiping the remnants of Harry’s seed on the sheet before Draco crawled up to him and propped himself on one arm with a big smile on his face.
“Excellent, my boy. Now, if you wouldn’t mind excusing me and Professor Snape? I’d like to have a quick word with him.” Dumbledore asked.
“It’s yours, Harry. I have had it for quite some time, not using it, not moving it, knowing full well that it was not meant for someone like me. I can’t think of any person that it would be better suited for than you. I won’t take it back.” Severus said.
Draco meant so much to him that it was hard to believe they had only been together for such a short time. A sudden realization seemed to smack him and made him stop chewing. He
Harry was starting to grow worried the longer he thought about what he was doing. He was running away from the one place in the world where Voldemort couldn’t get to him, and not only that, but he was heading to a place that had most likely been abandoned for 15, nearly 16, years; a place he had only just found out about earlier that day. He was mental, and he knew it. He was starting to second-guess his decision, and was about to yell down to Stan to just take him back, when the bus came to a sudden stop, nearly tossing Harry from the bed.
“Listen, Harry. Owls in the wizarding world are fiercely loyal. There are stories out there about Owls who have died attempting to save their masters, and I truly doubt that she’s actually gone. She might be giving you some time, surely, and I’m sure that her feelings were probably a little hurt, but…   she’ll be back. Or she’ll be waiting for you to find her. She knew, probably more than
It was funny, with him being in Slytherin, you would think he would have hated Gryffindor’s on principle. But something about Hermione’s know-it-all attitude, and Ron’s inability to stop eating attracted him, and by his second year at school, he had a solid friendship with them. Now… Now Ron and Sirius were dead, and Hermione was most likely never going to recover.  He couldn’t help the tears that started flowing down his face at the thought of them, the tears that threatened to overcome his body and cause painful sobs that he wouldn’t be able to stop. But there was a time and place for that, and if he didn’t get help soon, it wouldn’t matter that they died to save him, because he would be joining them.
“I need to confess something, but I don’t want to because talking about it makes it real… And I don’t want it to be real….” Harry started, before sucking in a deep breath and continuing, “I-I told Hedwig to leave.”
“At the very least, I wish you would have told me, Professor. I thought you left b-because you were disgusted with m-me, disgusted with what you had seen in my m-memories.” Potter said, voice cracking with emotion.
His wand snapped into his hand a second later, eyes scanning the water for any sign of Severus. He waited and waited until he was finally rewarded with a ripple, too big to be caused by a fish or bug, and cast his revenge.
Draco reflexively squeezed Harry tighter to him in his sleep and Harry couldn’t help the smile that crept over his face. A knock on the door prevented him from enjoying the moment any longer, however, as a voice called out to him.
With a sigh, Harry turned around and swept the room with his eyes, making sure she had gotten everything.
“Umm... Narcissa told me about you and Mr. Malfoy... I just want to say thanks for taking the time to train me, even though I’m sure you’re in pain right now... It can’t be easy when the loss is so... new” Harry said lamely.
curse.  He had been cut from his collarbone, down his chest, nearly avoided his nipple, down his ribs, and finally stopped in the lower left quadrant of his stomach. Truthfully, Severus was surprised; surprised, because the boy should have bled out far quicker than he did.
SIRIUS, SO YOU DID NOTHING BUT SNEER AT ME! SIRIUS MEANT MORE TO ME THAN ANYTHING, AND I THOUGHT VOLDEMORT WAS GOING TO MURDER HIM! OF COURSE I WENT TO SAVE HIM!” Harry screamed at Snape, not caring about the pain that was like fire in his side.
“We’ll be back in a bit. We just need to talk about some things. Maybe you guys should head up to the house? We’ll meet you in the drawing room when we’re done.” Harry said, waiting for Draco’s affirming nod before giving the other boy a kiss on the forehead and dropping his hand before walking over to Remus.
“Why did you go there? Why did you attack them? I would have been fine never having to see them again. I didn’t allow you into my head so that you would go and take revenge on my behalf.” Potter croaked out.
Harry went inside and up the stairs to the bedroom, followed by Draco. Both needed a bathroom to freshen up and agreed to meet in the kitchen.
“I do not think I would label it ‘sentient.’ It is more, I think, a collection of magic left behind by previous generations of your family. Somewhat of a connection to the people of the past, if you will. Family rings have been known to carry protective spells, runes to prevent harm, etc. There is nothing to be lost from putting it on, but perhaps you should think about it. There is no harm in waiting.” Dumbledore said.
Draco picked up the pace and Harry was openly moaning now. He could feel the orgasm building in his stomach and he tried to warn Draco.
“Yes, Professor Severus, sir? What can Meemy be doing for you?” questioned Meemy, throwing a look to Harry, only to be met with a faraway look from her master.
Dumbledore was silent for a moment, leaving Harry to look back and forth from him to the ring, before he spoke.
Dizzy soon joined them with the burgers that looked to be cooked perfectly. Harry could see the juice that was oozing from each patty and his stomach gave a loud rumble that got a laugh from Draco.
Hello again :) Writing at work seems to be going okay, though I swear I'm going to end up forgetting something and it's totally gonna mess the story up, but we'll cross that bridge if we ever get to it. You guys have seriously inspired me with your comments and I can't say thank you enough. Much love from me <3
birthday. When they arrived back at home, Uncle Vernon did nothing but glance at Harry once more, muttered something under his breath, and retreated inside. Harry sat there and tried to get his emotions under control while he had some peace, before getting out of the car and retrieving his trunk and empty owl cage.
He had gotten up from his chair, given Harry another long look, and then squeezed his shoulder as he left.
“That’s how life was until I got back this summer. Vernon had received a letter from Dumbledore, informing him that my Godfather had passed. He seemed more agitated, always muttering under his breath about how ungrateful I was. I got a surprise from my aunt, though. When she was shoving food into my room one day, she also gave me an envelope, inside it was a letter and some documents from my mum. It is one of the best things I’ve ever received.” Harry’s voice broke, but he continued, silent tears slowly falling. “That night, after I had fallen asleep, my uncle tried to sneak into my room. He hit the tray that held my food, though, and woke me up. He looked so... odd. The look he was giving made me uncomfortable, and when I tried to ask him what was going on, he told me to be quiet.
Hey guys... I know it's been a really long time since I updated this, but I won't make any excuses, though I do have a lot xD I hope this isn't a disappointment!
He slowly started to undress, pulling off his robes and letting them fall to the floor. A casual glance at the mirror caused him to freeze; his undershirt was caked in dry blood, and caused Severus momentary panic before he realized that he had only spelled Harry’s blood off his outer layers before apparating to the Dursley’s earlier. He drew in a shaky breath and continued undressing, stepping in the shower when he had finished. He systemically started scrubbing his body, starting at the top of his head and going all the way down to his feet, watching the bloody water drain by his feet. As he started shampooing his hair, he let his mind wander…
she gave me… I just yelled at her again. I told her to leave and to stay away from me and shook her off my shoulder. I haven’t seen her since.” He explained.
The table all raised their glasses and drank before Dumbledore sat down. He swished his wand in Harry’s direction, and suddenly there was a small pile of presents where his plate had been moments before.
Harry waited until he heard her retreating from his door before he opened the large envelope. What he saw made his heart stop. It was a letter from his mother, followed by some official looking documents with numbers and addresses on them. Could this even be possible? How? Why? Why
Harry chuckled as Draco swam up behind him and wrapped his arms around his chest. Harry leaned into him, a small satisfied smile snaking onto his face.
“Of course.” Harry said, walking away from the man, flexing his right arm to see if it felt like anything was there. He couldn’t feel a change and couldn’t help the smile that was again forming on his face. He made his way back to Draco who took his hand in his and ran the opposite hand up and down his arm, undoubtedly feeling for the wand. Harry grinned at him and Draco grinned back, finding nothing.
“Harry? Harry, my boy, you must focus! Close your mind!” Dumbledore said, anguish leaking into his voice.
Harry woke up and immediately threw up over the side of the bed. The burning, stabbing pain in his scar was making him sick, and he couldn’t help but feel like he had just been thrown across the room. He knew he had just watched Severus attack Voldemort, but he wasn’t sure why. What had Voldemort seen in his memories to make him doubt Severus?
You have to want the curse to hurt someone, and righteous anger wouldn’t work. Could he take that theory and use it here? He was desperate to try, and this was as good a lead as any.
Narcissa startled him when she lightly pulled on his arm, and when he glanced down at her, he could see his own emotions reflected: pain, loss, anger, pity. Well, he didn’t want to be
“I know you... dislike the taste, Potter, but the benefit that it’s having on you is obvious to anyone who has seen you in past weeks. You need only continue them for a short while more.” Severus said.
The door opened behind Harry and he turned to watch as his elves brought out a cake that was formed to make a 1 and 6. The icing was what drew his attention, though. It looked like it was shimmering with a thousand different gems, the same colors represented in his ring. It was breathtaking.
It was with these thoughts that Harry stumbled into the kitchen and prepared himself a simple breakfast. He had bacon and eggs cooking and juice poured before his brain caught up with what he was doing. Harry sighed, feeling slightly lonely, before he pushed the morose thoughts to the back of his mind and continued cooking.
“A Death Eater came into the room and told the Dark Lord that they had captured Vernon Dursley.” Snape said.
“You disgust me, Petunia. You couldn’t just stop at hating Lily, could you? No, you had to go and make sure her
Harry was looking at him, slightly open-mouthed in shock. Severus took a deep breath as he leaned back into his chair and scrubbed his face, closing his eyes as he tried to find the right words.
“You caused my wand to twitch in my hand, nothing more, and nothing less. An impressive start, truly, for someone who has never attempted that before.” Severus commented. “From now on, that’s how I want you to cast every spell you use. Even the simple ones. Understood?”
“I doubt he will turn away anyone who wishes to help the light side. I think the real question, Lucius, is whether you will be able to hold your prejudices enough to help their cause.” Severus countered.
Trigger warning, for those that need it. I will do my best to warn you ahead of time, but in case I miss it from here on out, I'm sorry.
When not a moment later Vernon was screaming with pain, Harry started moving. By the time he was off his bed, he had his pants pulled up, ready for Vernon to try something else. It seemed, however, that all his attacker could do was flop around in pain. Giving a vindictive smile, Harry reached under his bed and ripped the floorboard loose, grabbing the envelope containing his mother’s letter, and documents pertaining to him. He quickly pulled out from underneath the bed, grabbed his trunk and bird cage, and strode towards his door, which blasted open of its own accord with little thought from Harry. In the hallway, he was greeted by his deathly white aunt, and for a second, he reconsidered what he was about to do.
“Also... I hope you don’t mind, Harry, but I took the liberty of restoring your stables. They have been returned to their former glory, and the address on that paper is to our breeder. I’ve arranged for you to go and pick whatever horse you’d like.” Narcissa said.
Harry let his train of thought drift back to Draco. The boy, maybe he was a man now, in his arms had been through a lot. He could see it in his face, in his eyes, whenever Draco thought someone wasn’t paying attention. Harry knew that kind of pain, the pain of losing those you love. He knew the courage it took to keep going, to pick yourself up and try again. He resolved, then and there, that he would do everything he could to help make sure that Draco came out of this on top.
Remus sighed and suddenly looked much older. He had a slight frown marring his face that made Harry want to comfort him.
And then there was nothing except for their heavy breathing, and the shower dutifully pouring down in the background. Neither of them moved for a moment, and then Draco’s arse made it suddenly apparent that it did
He thought through the techniques he had already tried: Wand placement and grip, the force he was trying to put behind the spells, how loud or quiet he spoke the spell in his head. Nothing seemed to work; not well enough that it made any difference.

Does anyone want me to write a truth or dare with the HP characters or no. please let me know so  i can start working on it.
Narcissa traced her fingers on her sister’s handwriting, following the different swoops and curls that made up her signature. A letter or any type of message from Bellatrix hadn’t arrived in a long while. Rolling up the parchment, she pocketed it in her dress. She wanted to save it as a memento. The owl hooted to get her attention. It began to twist its head in weird directions. Remembering she had to pay for the delivery, she dropped a few knuts into the pouch tied around its ankle and fed it some leftover meat from breakfast. The owl affectionately nudged her hand, thanking her for the snack. It flew out the open window and left the manor. Slightly closing the window behind her, Narcissa returned to her workstation. Adding one ingredient after another, she kept thinking about her sister. Maybe once they see each other again in the winter, she can help Bellatrix through her problems. While she worked on the potions, her hand kept touching the letter in her pocket. She began to reminiscence of her sister and their childhood together. A few tears slid down her cheek. Narcissa wiped it away as she began stirring the cauldron. After making a few more potions, she looked at her stash that was ready to be added to the potion cabinet. “That should last us quite a few months,” she said to herself. Narcissa packed the vats into the cabinet. It was a bit of a tight squeeze. One of them threatened to fall onto another. Once she was able to stuff them all in there without them spilling, she cleaned up the worktable and took a small break. She returned to look at the letter, reading it over and over again. “What are you doing?” Narcissa looked up and saw Sirius leaning on her chair. She held up the letter. “Reading this. It’s from Bellatrix. She sent it to me a few hours ago.” Sirius read the first few sentences. “ ‘...but I ask you not to go through with it’. What does she mean by ‘not going through with it’? After all that she has been through, wouldn’t she be happy that we are finally standing up to Dumbledore? Truthfully, I was waiting for her to bust down the doors and say that she’s in.” Narcissa chuckled at his comments. If her sister wasn’t so down, she would get into the plan as much as she could. Next to Elaina, she would have been the most motivated and pumped up person. “I wish Bella was here,” Narcissa sighed. Sirius clapped his hands together, getting her out of her deep thoughts. “Well! We can certainly worry about that when it happens. Since you are done with your work for the day, how about we play a game of Wizard Chess? Elaina is helping out your husband with his job, so why don’t I help you out with some fun?” Narcissa smiled. “I think I’d like that.” Sirius and Narcissa began to set up the board, the chess pieces reluctantly getting into their positions. Some of the pawns began to sass at them when they were starting. The games were really close. There were some points where the other looked quite certain to win, while the other took the lead unexpectedly. They laughed together, complementing each other on their chess skills. After a few games, they noticed that it was starting to become nightfall. Lucius and Elaina came downstairs and spotted Sirius and Narcissa playing chess. “I call dibs on playing the loser!” she called out, racing downstairs. “You can play after Narcissa, Elaina. I’m taking her with me tonight.” Her interest piqued, pulling her focus out of the game and onto her husband. “Where are we going tonight, Lucius?” she asked curiously. “Somewhere special. We could use a little levity from our work. We won’t have it much longer once we get deeper into the war.” From her spot at the table, she hugged Lucius. “Give me a few more minutes. I am ‘no mercying’ Sirius into defeat. Bishop to F-4.” Her command to the bishop and knocked out Sirius’s rook. “Check!” she declared. Minutes passed. The game was getting brutal now that the two of them were down to their last pieces. Sirius looked like he was going to win after taking down all but three of her pieces. Narcissa was able to turn the tables and beat him. Once they finished the game, Narcissa got up with Elaina hopping in to take her place, the pieces regenerating themselves. “Come on. Let’s go.” Taking Lucius’s arm, Narcissa walked with him to the door, leaning on his shoulder. Narcissa noticed that a bag was bouncing on his back while they walked. “What’s the bag for Lucius? Are we taking a trip somewhere?” Looking forward, Lucius gave an ambiguous response. “Yeah. Somewhere.” Narcissa loved their walk under the night sky. A gentle breeze blew towards them. Fireflies flitted around. The night was alive in its own special way. The couple walked in silence as they made their way through the forest. They enjoyed each other’s company, even when nothing was said. When they arrived at the spot Lucius intended to bring her to, he ran over to the center of it and yelled ‘surprise’! “I came here last night when I went to search for the gems. I thought of bringing you here to this beautiful place. Now that I have, you made it so much more amazing.” A bright smile lit up her face, warming her cheeks more so than the sun could. “I brought you here for a midnight picnic. Our food’s in this bag. Do you like it here?” Narcissa took in the scenery. The clearing was a lush green, the stars sparkled in the sky, the water streamed with the luminous opals and splashed a small wave on occasion. “I absolutely love it here! Thank you!” Lucius opened the backpack and took out a blanket for them to sit on. Being a gentleman, he led Narcissa over to sit down in the center. As Lucius sat down, Narcissa rested against her husband as he took out their food. “Did you bring…?” Narcissa started. Before she could finish, Lucius held up the item she was talking about. It was a tiny blueberry pie the size of his palm. “You did! I love tiny food.” The two of them ate their food, chatting away about their day and other things. Whenever a bird was nearby, they threw a piece of bread from their sandwiches to feed it. Once there were a lot of birds, they counted how many who were waiting for a snack, trying to portion out the crusts for each bird. By the time Lucius and Narcissa got to the pie, all the birds left. Though the pie was small, just sharing it with each other made them enjoy it even more, including the part when Lucius accidentally smeared the jelly onto his cheek. Leaving their food behind, they began to play together: catching fireflies, collecting stones, splashing each other, and playing tag respectively. Lucius tackled his wife to the ground when he tried to tag her, rolling until they laid next to each other, the soft blades of grass prickling at their exposed skin. As they stared into each other’s eyes, nostalgia took them back to when they first met at Hogwarts. Their love for each other was still strong, its strength unchanged even with the passage of time. “I love you…,” she whispered in his ear. Narcissa slipped her hands around her husband’s neck and lifted her mouth to his. She kissed him, so softly, so delicately. Lucius began to kiss her back. He saw her eyes widen as the kiss became more intense. Tingles shot throughout their bodies like a bolt of lightning. “I...love...you too…,” Lucius gasped between kisses. Narcissa tousled his hair, played with it. The golden strands became a little messy, falling over his face and rubbing against her forehead. Their lips tangled and danced, their symphony of a kiss becoming faster. After a while, they stopped to rest. Both were breathless. Narcissa rested on Lucius’s chest, his heartbeat a comforting song and his warmth a pillow. They gazed at the clear sky together, watching the stars light up the night. “Look there is the…,” they both exclaimed at the same time. Realizing they were pointing at the same star, they laughed. Taking turns, they pointed out the major constellations and retold the stories that made up that particular group of stars. “Ok, who would have thought I would be so grateful for Professor Sinistra’s class?” Narcissa asked herself. “If it wasn’t for the required Astronomy classes and her constantly reminding us about the different constellations, I wouldn’t be having this kind of fun.” Lucius chuckled. “I agree. This is quite fun. Also…” He turned to look at the bag that drooped over. “I...I have something for you.” He shifted away to grab the bag. Narcissa sat up expectantly, watching as he rummaged through the bag. Lucius pulled out a stunning necklace. Held together by a silvery chain, gems were studded throughout it. Narcissa realized that the gems looked quite familiar. Pivoting her body, she looked at the stream with the glowing stones at the bottom. The same stones that were in her new necklace: the Opals of Protection. “Elaina helped me a little bit with this. The night before, she made a comment saying that she wasn’t going to pass up making jewelry out of some of them. That got me thinking about making one for you.” He held it up for her. Turning around, Narcissa lifted her hair so he could clasp the necklace. She gasped softly as the cool, smooth stones touched her skin. Narcissa admired the necklace, cupping the opal that dangled in the center.  “So that’s what you were doing with Elaina. You are very bad at lying to me, you know that right? You can lie to others, but you can’t fool me. Either way, I love my gift!” Narcissa leaned in to kiss him again, but was interrupted by a loud rustling in the brush. Realizing they were not alone, Lucius stood up in a protective stance in front of Narcissa. He whipped out his wand, pointing it towards potential places where someone could be hiding. “Who’s there?” Narcissa called out, still on the ground. No one answered, but the rustling became louder, the person closer. Gripping his wand tighter, Lucius prepared for an attack. As the person came closer, his grip loosened as he saw the figure. A girl with light brown hair, tangled in knots with specks of dirt dotted all over. She wore a Hogwarts uniform. It was tattered, falling to pieces. She had gashes all over her face; some of them looked fresh. Stumbling over her feet, she held onto a low tree branch with one hand, while the other tightly grasped her stomach. “Help….Please…,” she called out to them. The girl fell to her knees with both of her hands over her stomach. She moved her hands for a second, revealing a deep wound in her abdomen. Crying out in pain, the last of her strength ebbed away and blacked out on the forest floor.
You all better be happy. My best friend and i are both tired from  working on this for three freaking days
It has been a month since Severus reunited with his children. That day seemed so far away now. Ever since that day, so much has happened. He first found out he was pregnant. Then more of his family returned. New faces became allies and friends. “Has it really been a month? It seems like much longer...” he thought. He pressed his hand to his stomach, feeling how much he had grown. At the start of his pregnancy, he didn’t show. Now, his stomach started to protrude a little. Narcissa helped him a lot during that month. She gave him weekly check-ups and corrected his eating habits so he can feed enough for him and his baby. He has been feeling a lot better lately with her help. He was even able to walk around the manor without an escort. As he walked around the back gardens, he became lost in thought. Only one day was left before he and the children were to go to Hogwarts. From there on out, they were going to be treading in dangerous waters. Hogwarts was under Dumbledore’s control and everyone there followed his every command. If they were going to kill him, it had to be strategic and sneaky. Severus was interrupted from his thoughts when he heard a piercing cry ring out from the woods. While Tom and Narcissa gave him strict orders to not wander away from the Malfoy Manor, but his motherly instincts had taken over and he followed the sound of the cry. It was a heartbreaking sound. It was torture for Severus to hear that. He walked and walked, trying to find whoever was crying. After passing through the light part of the forest, he came to a densely wooded area. It was much darker and the trees blocked out most of the sunlight. Severus was tempted to shadow travel to find the child, but he told himself not to so he does not hurt himself. For another few minutes, he traveled through the woods, but didn’t see much except for trees and squirrels. He was close to the sound, but couldn’t find where that child was. As if he was in a trance, he walked to a giant tree that had a small hollow near its roots. Near the hollow, was a young woman holding a baby. Severus walked closer, the leaves crunching from his footsteps. The woman heard him and darted away, leaving the baby behind. He did not get a good look at the woman, except that she had fiery red hair. “Must be Molly or Ginny Weasley. It seems typical of them to leave a child out in the middle of the woods,” he thought. As he walked closer, he saw the baby bundled in blankets. A baby girl looked up at him with saddened eyes. She was tiny, the size of a newborn. She had tiny fuzzies of black hair on her head and her eyes were a light brown. When Severus looked at  her face, he had a flash of Ginny Weasley in his mind. “That stupid Weasley girl. She gave up this child for no reason.” That made him furious. He suddenly had the urge to kill her, punish her for what she did. The baby sensed his anger and resumed crying, reaching her tiny arms to the angered male. Severus tried to calm her down by rocking her back and forth. She stopped crying and reached out to his finger which he held close to the child’s torso, grasping it in her tiny hand. He gasped softly, seeing the sweet gesture the baby made. The male pressed his forehead to the baby’s, holding her tight. “Don’t worry, little one. I’m here,” he whispered. “She needs a name…” “Hmm, how about Amelia? Ameila Cici Riddle. The little girl giggled and seemed to like her name. “Alright. Amelia it is.” Severus held her tightly as he made his way back to the Malfoy Manor. He didn’t want to stay much longer in the woods and Amelia needed the proper care she deserves. By the time he returned, the sun was high in the sky. It warmed his skin, but irritated it a little. He was able to stay in the sun for a few hours, but affected him greatly if he stayed in it too long. Severus entered through the back door and saw Tom and the others eating lunch. They didn’t notice his presence until he closed the door. “Was your excursion in the garden helpful....” Tom’s voice trailed away as he saw Severus holding a baby in his arms. In his shock, he dropped the plate and it shattered on impact. Everyone turned to Severus, surprised to see him with a baby. “Severus,” Tom said, trying to keep his composure. “Where did you find that baby?” Severus looked at Amelia, who was staring at him with her big eyes. “I found her. The Weasley girl abandoned her in the woods. I heard her crying and I decided to follow the sound and it led me to her,” he explained. Narcissa gave him a disapproving look. “You went outside the boundaries of the Manor? Severus, your intentions may be pure, but you can’t just wander off like that.” Severus glared at her briefly before returning to rocking the baby in his arms. “Does this mean we have a new member of the family?” Valorie asked. Tom walked up to Severus and the baby. “Hold on. We can’t just take in this baby. We are heading to Hogwarts tomorrow and it’s not like we can just bring a baby onto school grounds.” Severus was starting to get mad that Tom didn’t see they had to take in this baby. She needed her best chance, and that best chance was with them. “I’ll just tell Dumbledore that I found her in the middle of the woods and decided to take her in. It’s the perfect cover up. He won’t suspect any attacks from me if he knows I am taking care of Amelia,” he reasoned. Tom was confused. His mate wanted to attack Dumbledore and take care of the baby. “You are not attacking Dumbledore in your current state. And you gave her a name?!” “It’s also the perfect time to get revenge on Ginny,” Hadrian said. “No one should do that to a child.” Tom had to deal with Severus and Hadrian defending the baby. “Wait! You can’t just rush in like that. And Severus, what will happen if Dumbledore does go after you?” He thought about that for a moment, trying to quickly form a plan. “We’ll just help Mother and attack Dumbledore. Easy,” Valorie chimed in. “No, you are not. Severus, they...” Severus had enough trying to explain this nicely. “Ok, enough! We are keeping this baby Tom. And that’s final! If anyone else has a problem with that, you can take it up with me!” He headed upstairs to his room with Amelia in his arms, leaving the dining room with a roomful of confused people.
Harry Potter was NOT looking forward to going back to the Dursley’s. He hated them, he hated their stupid house, and he hated the stupid summer. This year was definitely going to be the worst. You see, during the school year, Harry had been lured into a trap set by Voldemort, a trap that lead to the death of 2 of the people closest to him, and left another of his friends in a coma, one from which anyone doubted she would ever wake.
Harry had a sense of determination that he hadn’t had since Sirius died, and it drove him to his feet. He needed a shower but would head downstairs when he was finished to see if Snape had arrived yet. He needed the man's knowledge, now more than ever, if he was truly going to face the Dark Lord. He was more ready than ever to start training with the older man, and could only speculate on what he was about to learn.
Harry started dragging his prick back and forth over Draco’s, every now and then punctuating a thrust with a kiss. Soon enough, Harry felt the hands on his back tighten and Draco locked up, letting a small moan escape from his mouth. Harry picked the pace up, taking only a few seconds to drag his own orgasm up to the surface. He joined Draco in bliss shortly after, burying his head into the crook of the other boy’s neck. He stopped moving shortly after, not wanting to ruin the post-climax high by accidentally rubbing something overly sensitive. He opened his eyes and watched as Draco’s breathing steadily returned to normal. He waited, and eventually, Draco opened his eyes, looking at Harry with a slight smile on his face.
“Well… I’m gay… so I kind of understand their situation. I don’t understand why adoption wasn’t a choice, since I’m sure you can find a pureblood surrogate, but it’s not really my place to comment, is it?” Harry replied.
“That, Potter, was just what I wanted you to see. The first was a real memory, the second was not.  However, you would never be able to tell the difference between the two.” He replied.
Harry watched as her hair turned from the platinum blonde that he was so used to seeing, to a deep, beautiful brown. His mouth was hanging open in shock.
When Harry had given Remus a tour of the Manor (they had ventured upstairs with a shouted ‘One second, Sev,’ so that Remus could get the full effect of the place) they returned downstairs, re-joining the others in the drawing room.
Harry cracked a wide smile and leaned down to press another couple of chaste kisses to his lips before swinging his leg over Draco and standing up.
“Any sane person would feel nothing but outrage at your treatment, Harry.” Draco said incredulously.
When he arrived, he quickly made his way through the room, packing only the rarest ingredients and easy to transport things into a chest. He had finished in minutes and he shrank the packed trunk and put it into a pocket of his robes; with a last sweeping look of the room, Severus spun around and went back down the stairs.
“Meemy was starting to worry you would not be returning tonight. Master Potter has been asking for you since he realized you left, hours ago. Meemy did not know what to tell him.” Meemy rushed out.
Harry felt something wet on his cheek and realized the memory had brought tears to his eyes. He wiped the tears away and readjusted his position. He grasped for something else to think about and latched on to the first thing that popped up.
Harry raised his eyebrows, shocked that the man had used his first name. But he didn’t have time to reflect on it, because Severus had turned abruptly and started walking to the back door. Harry caught up quickly and the pair walked outside into the brisk morning fog. They reached the lawn and Severus walked Harry through some warm-up stretches before the pair set off at a comfortable jog.
He arrived seconds after the old man, and noticed that Dumbledore was stiff with tension, wand by his side. Severus stopped in the middle of putting his wand away as he, too, noticed what Dumbledore had upon landing.
Harry was a little hesitant when he nodded to his professor. He really didn’t want to duel with him, but he could see the logic behind the training. He let out a deep sigh before he raised his wand.
It was with one of the greatest efforts of his life that he pulled himself together, and continued towards his home.
Well, he tried to keep his tone neutral. Guess that’s hard to do when all you can think about is the ride home sitting next to someone who wished you dead.
“Don’t ‘hello’ me with that tone of voice, boy. You damn well better show me the respect I deserve,” His uncle snarled, turning slightly purple with rage.
“And now I’ve unloaded all of this on you, and that’s not fair.” Harry finished, trembling slightly from all of the turmoil he was feeling.
It was probably around 8 pm, and Harry was dragging his feet through the grass, having abandoned his trainers and socks when the heat had spiked at 2 pm. Meemy, thankfully, had brought him a plate of food a few hours ago that he had all but inhaled, because all Harry wanted now was to crawl in bed and call it a day. He slowly made his way up the steps to the door that would lead him into the house, when a small noise from his left stopped him.
“Only that you are the most handsome, refined man I’ve ever spent the night with. Definitely nothing about you being adorable.” Harry gasped out.
“Thank you, Harry, for trusting me with your truths, and your demons. It takes someone incredibly strong to be dealt the hand that you have and keep bouncing back from hardship after hardship. You are truly the best parts of your parents, and they would be so proud of the boy, the
“MASTER HARRY, SIR, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!” Meemy cried out, making Harry jump and upset the flimsy bandage he had made for himself.
. I might have been able to completely eradicate that magic. All I’m able to do now is contain it to your right hand.” Severus snapped.
“I’ve no idea, Harry. It came in the mail a few days ago, but your uncle refused to let you have it. You will read it, and hide it. If he finds it, I will deny ever giving it to you.” Aunt Petunia said, sounding a little snippy.
Harry decided to make himself a sandwich before he went to find Draco, so he continued on to the kitchen. It was nearly three in the afternoon, and dinner was only a couple hours away, but he was famished. With everything that had happened, he didn’t think he could be blamed for it.
If Severus was truthful with himself, he would admit that he was more shaken earlier than he seemed. Thinking of how close Harry had come to death caused Severus to give an involuntary shiver, a feat considering how hot the water was. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that Harry needed help, that he needed someone to guide him. By the time the scent of his earthy, deep-woods smelling soap hit his nose, Severus had resolved himself to fully helping the boy with whatever he needed.
Harry stood as well, watching as his teacher walked to the door and opened it. He thought the man was going to leave, but he turned around and spoke once more.
Around the middle of the second day, Harry started to let his thoughts roam free, feeling confident he could keep his focus on keeping his shields up while letting his mind wander. One of the first memories that drifted across his mind was the one that Snape had shown him of his mother as a child. He could see his mother’s eyes closed and face lightly bunched up as she laughed at what his professor had said to her. He realized Snape appeared amazed to have made her laugh so hard, while he also looked pleased with himself.
Remy bolted upright, gasping for air. Her body ached all over, as if her bones shifted while she slept. “It’s ok, Pup. You’re safe. Calm down,” Remus told her. Remy hugged her mother. In the comfort of his arms, she was able be with him when she couldn’t during the vision quest. “Remy, how much did you remember?” he asked her. “Everything. I remembered everything!” she exclaimed. Remus beamed at his daughter. “I knew you could, Pup. The reason why I gave this vision quest to you is because I needed you to see that the wolf is there to protect you, not to harm you. I knew that you would be stronger than me and control the wolf side.” Remy broke away from the hug and stretched out her sore muscles. Her mother started to explain further. “What I taught you will be able to help you stay in control when you decide to shift. When you need the wolf, try to think that you need protection and have to dawn your armor quickly, but remember that your ‘armor’ is an extension of you. When you want to revert to your human form, remember how it feels to be safe with your family and friends.” After stretching herself out, Remy had a dark question that formed in her mind. “Father, even though I know how to control the wolf now, what happens if there is a time that I cannot control it at all?” Remus knew that was coming. “There is nothing you can do to stop it. Sometimes, the wolf will become stronger and you will lose yourself to it.” Remy drooped at her mother’s words. What was the point of the vision quest if it was inevitable that the wolf will take over? “Also, something else I wanted to tell you. There may be nothing that you can do, but there is someone else who will.” Remy was getting tired of the cryptic speech. She may love riddles, but not at the expense of harming the people she cares about. “Who then?” she asked. “When your wolf side does take over, it’ll be better if Valorie is with you. Only a wolf’s mate can keep them calm and content. That is why your father was able to calm me down when I turned last year. Your mate is a bind to who you are at your core. Valorie will be an anchor that will guide you out of the beast.” Remy lightly blushed at the mention of Valorie’s name. She tried her best to not think of being seperated from her mate when the wolf took over and instead wished that they would always be by each other’s side. “Thank you for helping me, mother. Now, can we catch up for real this time?” The two of them talked and laughed for what felt like forever. They chatted about how school was going for them and how the plan to take down Dumbledore was going. At that moment, they felt like they didn’t have to hide that they were not close, although everyone knows that they are family. The two of them were peaceful that they could be who they are, even though no one could see it.
Hadrian woke up with a start. He felt cold scales rubbing against his arm. Once he sat up, he saw a huge black mamba curled up by his arm, watching him sleep. Hadrian decided to try talking to it to see if it was his father. “Father?” Hadrian hissed in parseltongue. The snake responded: “Yes, Hades?” “I know this is going to be weird, but you’ll get used to it,” the snake, or should he say his father, hissed. “Ok then, Father. Let me get up. I'll carry you out. Ok?” His father looked at him with that blank snake expression. “Alright.” Hadrian got himself ready for the day and headed downstairs with his father wrapped around him like a shawl. When Hadrian got to the kitchen, he saw his mother preparing breakfast. “Someone’s up early. Good morning Hadrian.” his mother greeted him. “Good morning, mother,” he yawned. Severus walked over to him and gave him a kiss on the forehead. He turned to the animagus snake and bopped him on the nose. Tom shook his head like a dog and hissed at Severus. Severus looked at Tom as if he was being mean. “Is your father ok? What is he saying?” Hadrian looked at his father who was looking back at him and hissing a lot. “Father!” he scolded him. Severus couldn’t communicate in Parseltongue, so he didn’t understand what they were talking about. “What? What did he say?” Severus asked again. Hadrian gave his mother a weird look, not knowing what to tell him. “Just...just a lot of...snake profanity.” Severus glared at Tom, wanting to shake him for saying such things. Profanity just for bopping him on the nose! Hadrian’s mother turned away from them and resumed cooking. Hadrian shrugged, not really caring what they were mad at. He retreated to his room to pack everything he was taking to Hogwarts. The young teen grabbed his things and started to lay them out on the floor. When Hadrian grabbed his scythe, he looked it over. It was a beautiful blade, his birthright as a son of the Riddle family. He twirled the weapon a few times in his hands, getting a feel for it. The scythe was pretty heavy for being small, so it weighed his hand down a bit. Hadrian swung it around a few times, imagining he was cutting down his enemies. With that weapon, he would be able to obliterate his enemies; his parents’ enemies too. He would protect his family with his strength. Hadrian sheathed his scythe, placed it in the bottom of his suitcase, and resumed packing. He grabbed his school supplies and robes and placed them carefully in his suitcase, not wanting to ruin his weapon. When he finished packing, he headed downstairs. Hadrian was greeted by Valorie, Remy, and Draco, all sitting at the table and waiting for breakfast. “Good morning!” they said. Hadrian waved back. Draco bolted up from his seat and ran to give his mate a hug. “Hey, Hades,” Draco said. The two nuzzled each other for a few seconds and walked back to the table. Valorie was amusing herself with her new wand by conjuring up small fireworks and Remy was speed reading through this year’s textbooks. “Little brother,” Valorie called to her sibling. “Did you try out your new scythe yet?” Hadrian nodded back, remembering how it felt when he wielded it. “It was amazing! I’ve never felt so strong before,” he commented. Valorie was happy to see her brother excited about their new weapons. “Right?! The blade is so beautiful. Sturdy too. I’ve had my fair share of weapons throughout my years of hiding, but this one is by far my favorite. I wanted to carry it with me wherever I went, but apparently, Mother said: ‘No weapons at the table’.” Severus turned around to his daughter, giving her a stern look. “You could hurt someone if you are not careful, Val,” he told her. Valorie groaned at that, knowing that she is extremely careful when she handles weapons. “Mother, I know to be careful. It’s not like I’d swing it wildly. I’m old enough to handle weapons,” Val scoffed. Draco looked at her smugly and Valorie noticed it. “What are you staring at, Blondie?” Draco chuckled in response. “Nothing. I just know that you try so hard to be mature and tough, but you still act like a child.” Valorie seethed and was going to snap, but Hadrian yelled. “Will you two knock it off?!” His sister and mate looked at him and returned to what they were doing before. “What’s with all the yelling? And why does it smell so good in here?” Remus walked in with Sirius and the Malfoys, hungry for a delicious meal. Severus headed towards the table with multiple plates in his arms. “You’re just in time. Breakfast is ready.” He placed the dishes on the table, which were laden with food. As everyone started to eat, Severus was looking around for Tom. “Um… has anyone seen Tom?” he asked them. When he said that, a hiss sounded from the counter. Tom was still in his animagus form and was hissing to Hadrian, telling him to translate what he was saying. “He says: he is right there. And he said that he is not changing out of his animagus form because he has to get used to being a snake. That it has been a while and needs time to adjust.” Severus nodded to him and gave him a small plate of tarts. Tom the snake looked at him questioningly, tilting his head to the side. Severus put his hands on his hips and pouted at him. “Unless you are hungry for mice, I suggest you eat those.” Severus turned away to serve himself a plate of food, leaving Tom with his tarts. Everyone ate their breakfast, even Tom who was nibbling his food. When they were done eating, the group who was heading to Hogwarts was frantically trying to pack for school. Remy was organizing her books and quills, while Draco and Valorie lazily tossed in their stuff. “Come on everyone. We have to leave in ten minutes. Otherwise, we will miss the train,” Remus called out to the kids. Hadrian, Draco, Valorie, and Remy came down with their suitcases trailing behind them. Severus turned to them with his own suitcase. Tom was curled up on it, asleep and unaware. “Do you have everything?” Severus asked the children as he turned to go up stairs to get Amelia from the nursery that was supposed to be for the twins. “Yes,” the four yelled after him. After Severus returned with Amelia in his arms, the kids said ‘good-bye’ to Sirius and Elaina, who were staying behind. The group started to make their way to the train station. It was a little long with Amelia who was crying for five minutes straight and when Tom was nearly crushed by Severus’s suitcase multiple times. When they finally made it to the station, everyone was exhausted. “We’re here…” Narcissa said, helping her son drag his suitcase over to the others. “This trip was a bit more challenging than I expected, but we made it,” Lucius said to his wife. The nine of them headed to the entrance barrier to Platform 9 ¾. When they got there, Valorie was unamused. “What are we doing here? Where’s our train?” she asked. Hadrian realized that she had never been to the platform before. “Watch this, sister!” With his suitcase in hand, he sprinted to the pillar between platforms 9 and 10. Instead of crashing head-first into the wall, he disappeared. Valorie’s jaw dropped, surprised and confused. “Where did he go? Is he dead?” Draco laughed at her naivete, glad she isn’t all that smart. “That is the entrance to the platform, stupid.” He laughed at her as he ran through the barrier, trying to catch up to his mate. Valorie snapped out of her trance, craving payback at Draco for calling her stupid. “Get back here, Blondie!” she yelled at him, bracing herself for impact against the wall. There was no crash and she kept running. When she looked up, a magnificent crimson train stood on the tracks: the Hogwarts Express. Many families were helping their children with their belongings and saying their ‘farewells’ to them before they left. Valorie could see Hadrian and Draco heading to one of the bottom compartments to stow their giant trunks away. She followed them, still entranced by the hidden platform. By the time Valorie reached them, Remy, Remus, the Malfoys, and the Riddles were transported to the platform. “So much for being discreet,” Lucius grumbled.  “You’ll be fine, Lucius.” Narcissa placed her hand on her husband’s arm. Remy ran over to her friends and helped them with their luggage. Before Hadrian got on the train, he turned to his mother and hugged him. “I’ll see you at school, Mother.”  Severus hugged his son back. “If the Weasleys try anything, let me know.” “Alright, Mother.” With that, Hadrian climbed on to the train and found where Draco and the others were. Hadrian walked over to Draco and sat down next to him. Remy and Valorie filed in next, taking their seats across from the boys. “So this is the Hogwarts Express…” Valorie commented, taking in her surroundings. “I like it. Never been on a train before.” Remy looked at her in shock. “You’ve never been on a train before?” Valorie shook her head. “Nope. I’ve spent most of my life in hiding, so I never had the chance to really go out in public with large crowds. Never been on any sort of public transportation until now.” Remy dipped her head in sadness for her mate. “I’m sorry that you never got the chance to live a normal life,” Remy said. Valorie put her arm around her mate and pulled her close. Remy looked up and into her eyes, blushing furiously. “It’s ok, Remy. I don’t really think that much of the past. Besides, I get to make my future into the normal life I always dreamed of.” Remy said nothing else and snuggled up next to her mate. The two couples talked to each other for a few minutes, letting time pass by until the train left. The train took off and headed to its destination: Hogwarts castle. After a while, the candy trolley passed by their compartment to offer them sweets. “What does everyone want?” Hadrian asked them. “Surprise us,” Draco told him. Hadrian walked out with his wallet filled with money and bought Chocolate Frogs, Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans, Pumpkin Pasties, and Fizzing Whisbees. He handed the lady the money and took the armful of candy back to the others. When he laid out the candy before them, everyone’s eyes lit up. Remy and Draco immediately grabbed what they wanted, while Valorie tried to decide what she wanted to eat. She held up the jellybeans, unsure of what the box meant by ‘Every Flavor’. She decided to try one and got a caramel bean from her pick. “Mmm. These are delicious. Anyone want some? Try the caramel ones. They’re good. I’ll grab one for each of you.” Remy grabbed her hand before she started to pluck out any more jellybeans. “Val, I don’t think you know what the box means by ‘Every Flavor’,” Remy said cautiously. Valorie smacked her hand away, stuffing her hand in the box. “Of course I do. Every single sweet and delicious flavor you can think of is all in this tiny thing. Why are you all giving me these weird looks?” Everyone looked at Valorie like she still had so much to learn. “Val,” Hadrian said. “When they say ‘Every Flavor’, it means every flavor.” Valorie looked to her brother and then to the box. This tiny box of beans had every single flavor ever thought of? She laughed at thought, as if they were just pranking her. When she realized that they weren’t laughing along, she saw they were serious. “You mean it… it has every flavor, ever?” she asked. Hadrian nodded at her and grabbed a bean from her box just to show her. He popped an orange bean into his mouth, which filled with the flavor of sand. “Gross. Ugh, sand,” he said in revulsion. Valorie snatched the box back and pulled out a sad-looking gray jellybean. When she ate it, it tasted like rubber. She spit out the treat and tried to take the disgusting flavor off her tongue. “What is this? Nasty! I’m not eating another jellybean from this box ever,” The others laughed at what happened, leaving Valorie to sulk with the beans. She got her taste back after eating a Pumpkin Pastie. The four of them chatted away during the train ride, snacking away at their sweets. With such a fun vibe in the air, they did not expect to see Ron. Ron looked at them with disgust, hating every fiber of their existence. “Bloody hell. I’m cursed.” Hadrian turned to him, staring him down. The Weasley boy was just as annoying as ever. “Me too.” The red-haired teen turned to look at the boy who said that. Ron has never seen him before. He seemed familiar, but he knows that he has never met him. “Wait a minute...Who are you?” he asked. Hadrian stood up and gained his composure. He looked at Ron with malice in his eyes. “Your worst nightmare come to life,” Hadrian responded. Ron stepped back from the boy, seeing that there was more to him than he thought. “I highly doubt that,” he quivered. “But, seriously, who are you?” his voice getting slightly high-pitched. “Hadrian Riddle.” Ron jumped back in realization. “Wait. You’re...you’re...But how, why do you look so familiar?” Hadrian looked at Draco, nodding their heads to the same prospect. “He’s so stupid,” Hadrian said to Draco. “I know, right? He’s always been the stupid one,” Draco said to Hadrian. Ron was not going to get pushed around by Draco, so he tried to insult him. “Sh-shut up, Malfoy. You’re just trying to look cool in front of your new friends. Sooner or later, they’ll leave you. They’ll see you for who you really are: a monster.” Draco rushed up from his seat and tried to strangle Ron, but Hadrian held him back. Ron turned to Hadrian, a more calm expression on his face. “You and your friends have no idea who you are with. This guy here will take you for granted and toss you out to the vultures when he deems you as useless. You might have trouble making the right friends, knowing that you are hanging out with him,” Ron gestured to Draco. “I can help you out there.” Ron held out his hand and Hadrian reached to grab it but instead backhanded it instead. “No and this is why.” Hadrian then turned to Draco and kissed him. Draco immediately responded to his mate’s kiss, melding into it. The two vigorously kissed for a few seconds, leaving Ron to process what happened. Ron looked at the pair with shock, his head turning to look at the two. “WHAT?! When did this happen?” Draco looked at Ron smugly, who was still a little stunned from watching the two boys kiss. “A month ago, stupid,” he retorted. Ron was speechless for a moment, clearly having no idea of what he got himself into. He turned to Valorie and Remy, trying to salvage the two of them away from Draco. “You two have got to believe me. Draco is the wrong sort to get caught up in. The worst. Let me take you away from that.” Valorie gave Ron a cold smile and stated: “Nope, I like my brother and his boyfriend very much. And leave my girlfriend out of it.” Ron was now very confused. “Brother? Girlfriend?” He looked to the girl who Valorie said was her ‘girlfriend’. She looked just like Hermione, except that she was taller and had black streaks that Hermione didn’t and her eyes were an icy blue color. Similar to Lupin’s eyes. Ron looked at the look alike girl, who folded her hands across her chest, trying her best to avoid making eye contact with him. No one seemed to listen to him, so he tried to leave. Yet, he was still drawn to Draco’s friends. “I still can’t understand this. Why do you look so familiar?” he asked Hadrian. Hadrian was silent for a couple seconds, leaving Ron puzzled. When Ron saw that Hadrian was not going to answer him, he turned to walk out of the compartment, but Hadrian grabbed his wrist before he could. “Oh, Ronald. Don’t you recognize your old friends, traitor?” Hadrian’s eyes flashed a bright red, scaring Ron even more. Ron looked into Hadrian’s eyes, then at the girl who looked identical to Hermione. “Harry? Hermione?” he whispered frighteningly. “Those aren’t our names anymore,” Hadrian said threateningly. Hadrian released Ron’s wrist and left him in shock. The train had stopped and they arrived at Hogwarts. People were starting to file out of the train, so the four of them had walked out of the compartment, leaving Ron their wake. They had to tell him the truth. After all, he betrayed them. Hadrian and the others left the train and found a carriage big enough for the four of them. Once they arrived, they got in a boat together and made the rest of their journey to Hogwarts. “So this is the legendary Hogwarts,” Valorie said as they got closer to the school. “This is going to be fun,” Hadrian looked at his sister agreeing. “Once we get in, when they call for transfers, Val, Remy, and I will raise our hands.” Valorie and Remy nodded in agreement. They reached the shore and walked all the way to the castle. “All right, students. All the first years and transfers are going to be sorted by the sorting hat.” Professor McGonagall called out as the new first years approached her. “But first, do we have any transfers?” Hadrian, Valorie, and Remy raised their hands. “All right, what are your names?” “Hadrian Riddle.” McGonagall’s eyes widened with fear but she didn’t say anything. “All right. What about the other two? “Valorie Riddle.” “Remy Lupin-Black.” “Alright. Let’s get started.” Hadrian went up and McGonagall placed the sorting hat on him. “My, a hard one. Just like your parents I say. But an heir to all houses. Better place him in SLYTHERIN.” Then Valorie went up. She also got Slytherin. It was finally Remy’s turn. The hat had then decided Slytherin was for Remy, even when Sirius and Remus were in Gryffindor. Dumbledore stood up from his place in the Great Hall, raising his hands to the bewitched sky. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber!” The headmaster clapped his hands together and a lavish feast appeared on the tables. Hadrian rolled his eyes at the food, knowing that this couldn’t hold a candle compared to his mother’s food. “Mother’s cooking is so much better than this,” he grumbled as he slowly added food to his platter. Valorie nodded her head, imitating her brother and piled her plate with ignorance. “I don’t want to eat this terrible food,” Valorie complained. The four of them didn’t eat much. They only ate a little to appear as normal new students. When their last course was over, the leftover food and drinks disappeared. Dumbledore walked over from his place at the table to the golden podium set in front. “So!” he said, smiling to all his students. “Now that we are all fed and watered, I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices.” Hadrian and Draco silently groaned, not wanting to endure Dumb-as-a-Door’s long winded speech. “Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has been extended to items such as Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises four hundred thirty-seven items. I believe it can be viewed in Mr. Filch’s office if anyone would like to check it.” Draco looked at Hadrian with a ‘kill-me-now’ look on his face. Hadrian returned it with an ‘I’m-sorry-and-I-don’t-want-to-listen-to-this-too’ look. He squeezed his mate’s hand and reassured him. Dumbledore was still talking, boring the four of them out. “As ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is Hogsmeade Village to all below third year.” Hadrian pretended that his hand was a puppet and made it talk whenever Dumbledore spoke. The others muffled their laughs as much as they could, trying their best to not draw attention. “For those of you who do not know your teachers, let me introduce you to them. This is Professor McGonagal, Deputy Headmistress and Transfiguration teacher. Over there is Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Next to him is Professor Sprout, who teaches Herbology. Professor Sinistra is the Astronomy teacher. There’s Hagrid, our Gamekeeper and teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Right here is Professor Snape, Potions Master and Teacher. And…” At that moment, the doors crashed open. Everyone swiveled around to look at the latecomer. Hadrian, Draco, Valorie, and Remy all gasped when they saw the stranger’s face, for they had met him before. “Sorry I’m late…” Moody said, his voice carrying in the giant room. He limped his way towards where Dumbledore was and shook his hand. “Welcome, Alastor,” said Dumbledore. “It is an honor to have you here.” On Hadrian’s shoulder, Tom stared at Moody, his eyes ice cold. He despised the fact that he instigated his family and now he was here to help Dumbledore. “May I introduce Professor Moody, our Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and the newest addition to our esteemed faculty.” It was customary to greet any new teacher with applause, but no one clapped for Moody, with the exception of Dumbledore and Hagrid. “That’s the guy who was talking to us at the Three Broomsticks,” Valorie whispered. “How did he get a job here?” Remy asked her. “If someone as loony as him can get a job from Dumbledore, we aren’t safe. Dumbledore could hire more aurors to keep an eye on the students. Specifically, us.” The four of them resumed to ‘listen’ to Dumbledore’s speech while keeping an eye on Moody. Moody was unfazed by the less-than-warm welcome. He took his place in an unoccupied chair at the faculty’s table. Hadrian made eye contact with his mother, glad that he listened. His mother had a look of fear in his eyes, terrified of the new addition at the table. Hadrian was worried that he was going to have another panic attack, but he was composed enough and looked calm. “...I’m sure you will all enjoy it immensely,” the headmaster continued. “I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts, we have the honor of hosting an exciting event over the coming months. An event that has not been held in over a century. The Triwizard Tournament!” Everyone’s eyes lit up when Dumbledore said that. They started to talk over each other, excited for the event. “Triwizard Tournament? What’s that?” Valorie asked her brother. “Don’t know. Never heard of it.” Dumbledore raised his hands to get back everyone’s attention. “As I was saying, we have the privilege and honor of hosting such an event this year. This friendly competition was held between the largest magic schools in Europe: the Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Hogwarts. With that, I would like to introduce one of the schools who is here to participate: the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. At that moment, dozens of girls in pale blue robes entered the room. Every boy (with the exception of Hadrian and Draco) was drooling over these stunning girls. They were beautiful, vivacious, and irresistibile. The young women skipped their way along the trail to the center of the room, releasing a kaleidoscope of butterflies from their hands, which fluttered around until it poofed into blue glitter. Behind the young ladies, was presumably the headmistress. She was as tall as Hagrid, perhaps even taller. Dressed in black satin and studded with magnificent opals, she sashayed across the room to Dumbledore, shaking his hand vigorously. “Dumbly-dorr. It is my honor to preside over this convocation. It is wonderful to see you again, old friend.” Dumbledore greeted his guest and led her to an empty seat at the faculty table. He returned to the podium and signaled the Beauxbatons ladies to take their seats at any table of the four houses. “Welcome ladies of Beauxbaton Academy! It is a pleasure to have you here. Now, the other school who will be joining us in the tournament is Durmstrang Academy!” The doors bolted open once more, this time with handsome boys. Each of them had a staff, which they banged on the ground in an eerie rhythm. They spinned them around and grunted, as if they were fighting a battle. When they came to the front of the hall, they circled around and lined up near the walls. The headmaster of Durmstrang then entered the room, covered in many fur coats that shone in the light. Hadrian heard his father talking to him in light hisses. “That’s Karkaroff, one of my Death Eaters. I’ll tell him of our situation later so he can help us.” Hadrian nodded, watching two headmasters greet each other. “Dumbledore!” he boomed. “How are you?” The two greeted each other with a handshake and a firm pat on the back. “Wonderful, Karkaroff. Your students look exceptional as always.” Dumbledore led him to the last unoccupied seat and told the students to sit at any of the four tables. “And welcome students of Durmstrang! Thank you for coming. Now, The Triwizard Tournament was first established as a friendly competition between the largest European schools of wizardry. Not all of you will get to participate, but those who are chosen will. A champion will be selected to represent each magic school, and the three champions will compete in three magical tasks. You may be asking yourselves who will be selecting these champions. We have brought an impartial judge that will decide which students are most worthy to compete, the Goblet of Fire!” Dumbledore raised his wand high and summoned the Goblet of Fire before him, its blue flames waving wildly. “The Goblet of Fire has sensed the courage and determination within these three champions and will summon their names forth to me. Those who are chosen will have the opportunity to compete for the Triwizard Cup, a thousand Galleon prize, and the glory of their school.” The Goblet’s flame turned red, signaling that it had found its chosen three. Three small, charred pieces of paper fluttered into Dumbledore’s hands, which held the names of the champions. “Fleur Delacour of Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum of Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory of Hogwarts are your three champions. Everyone erupted in cheer, while the quartet only clapped politely. Dumbledore congratulated the three of them and told them to sit down when the goblet spit out a fourth name. Before Dumbledore could even read it they all heard a tap on the window. Dumbledore turned and opened the window letting an owl in. He took the letter from its mouth and opened it. Once he finished reading the letter, he dropped it, his eyes full of terror. “What’s the matter, Headmaster?” Mother said in false concern, knowing the answer. “Harry Potter and Hermione Granger are dead.” Everyone but Hadrian, Valorie, Remy, Draco, and Severus gasped. “And they were killed by the Dark Lord.” “Father, did you write that?” Hadrian hissed quietly to his father. “Yes I did. And what are we going to do about Moody?” Hadrian glanced up at the one-eyed man before looking back down at his father. “Kill him. I think it should be you because you have venom. Let him know that us Riddles won’t back down till Dumbldore and the Order is dead.” Tom looked at his son and decided that if it means to protect Severus, then so be it. “I’ll strike once he goes to his quarters.” Hadrian turned back to Dumbledore, who was trying to get his students to calm down and failing. “Everyone! Please, calm yourselves!” he roared, his voice echoing across the Great Hall. “Harry Potter and Hermione Granger’s death will not be vain. The Dark Lord is in power and there is an army of Death Eaters out there somewhere, ready to do his bidding. The professors and I will stop them. We won’t let them win. I’m sorry to say that in light of this moment, we will have to cancel the Triwizard tournament. But, we will push out the Dark Lord and his army once and for all.” All the students looked uncertain. If the Dark Lord was able to kill the boy who lived and the most intelligent witch at Hogwarts, how would the professors stand a chance? Some people were gossiping. Some were crying. Everyone but Hadrian and his family were in despair. Since everyone was focused on the tragic news, Hadrian decided to tell Valorie, Draco, and Remy about his father’s plan. “Ok. When we leave to our dormitories, father is going to follow Moody to his quarters and wait until he is unpacking. Once he is, father is going to kill him with his venomous bite.” Remy and Draco were ok, but Valorie was concerned for him. “Are you really going to go through with this? With no help or backup?” Tom nodded his head, acknowledging his daughter’s concern. “I will be fine, Val. Once I kill Moody, I’m going to head to your mother’s room and stay there for the night. I will greet you both in the morning so you know that I’m ok.” Valorie had pet her father’s head and gave him a small hug. Dumbledore ordered the prefects to escort the students to their respective dormitories. Draco took the lead, for he knew the way to the dormitories best. When the professors and students left, only Dumbledore was left standing in the Great Hall. He looked around fearfully, for he knew that the Dark Lord was onto his plans. The headmaster composed himself and stared at the ground. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he wanted to be in power for as long as he could. Before he left the room, he noticed there was a tiny, burnt piece of paper stuck to the bottom of his boot. It was the same paper that came out of the Goblet of Fire. Dumbledore unfolded the paper and read the name that was on it: Harry Potter.
I hope you are doing well. I don’t need to tell you how I am. You’ve known just how I felt for a long time and will still remain the same probably for eternity. I’ve heard rumors that you, Lucius, Draco, and the rest of our friends are trying to take down Dumbledore. I admire what you are trying to accomplish, but I ask you not to go through with it. You are fighting a war where the game is rigged. We’ve seen what they’ve done. The losses that would follow. We weren’t able to stop them before and still we can’t now. Dumbledore will win, no matter the cost. I lost Rodolphus and my sons to him. I don’t want to lose you too. For the good of you and your family, Cissy, I am asking as your big sister to not do this. Don’t do it. Don’t go up against Dumbledore. Promise me. I’ll probably see you again during the winter holidays. I want to see that your family is doing fine. Please stay safe, little sister.
In the course of two days, we have had a great deal of losses. According to Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he received an ominous letter at the Welcoming ceremony. The letter’s contents contained a malicious declaration that said that Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and Hermione Granger, the Brightest Witch of Hogwarts had been murdered. The letter said that the one who murdered them was the Dark Lord himself! It seems that Harry and his sidekick were not able to escape the Dark Lord’s wrath after all. They may have evaded his grasp for the past thirteen years, but were not so lucky recently. Many students were distraught by the unfortunate loss, for they have adored the two of them. “It seems like yesterday that we were in the classroom together, learning about magic. Hermione and Harry were the ones who helped me with my Potions class. I wouldn’t have gotten my grades up if it wasn’t for them. They helped me find the courage to not give up. And now they’re gone,” one source had said. Another was particularly shaken. “They were the strongest students that Hogwarts had. And they were murdered by the Dark Lord. If it wasn’t for them, Hogwarts would have been under You-Know-Who’s control. With them, the world was a brighter place. What’s going to happen now that they are gone?” another source said. To answer that question, I don’t know. The future isn’t set in stone, especially with how uncertain these times are. Many students were lining up to give their responses for The Daily Prophet, but were too saddened to be able to share. Now that a new year is starting, an unexpected arrival has come to Hogwarts grounds. New transfer students Hadrian and Valorie Riddle and Remy Lupin-Black have been accepted into the school. This raises many questions for our readers: who are these young sorcerers and what are their intentions? With the rise of the Dark Lord comes the rise of his offspring. A little birdie had whispered into my reporter ear and told me that: “The new twins look very similar to Severus Snape, the Potions Teacher at Hogwarts.” I say to my little source that you may need to get your eyes checked out because Severus Snape most certainly does not have any children. These demonic siblings and their odd friend have already made the students and faculty uneasy. No one knows if they are as mean as their parents, but that remains to be seen. Two days ago, we received an anonymous tip revealing that Auror Alastor Moody was murdered in the middle of the night. No one knows who had taken his life, but my writer’s intuition tells me that the new arrivals had something to do with it. Dumbledore and the rest of the Hogwarts faculty are doing everything in their power to prevent anyone else from getting murdered. For now, we can only hope that the future will be better from here on out. To Harry, Hermione, and Moody, we give you flowers for all of your heroic sacrifices. Stay magical, my lovely readers.
The troupe walked down the staircases, descending each flight with ease, for the stairs seemed cooperative this time. Hadrian kept poking the prisoner with his wand while keeping it hidden in the folds of his cloak. The ghosts and a few of the professors were wandering about; he did not want to raise suspicion in their group. After another flight, the Gryffindor girl tripped on a step. She grumbled at the stairs. Valorie walked to her side to help her up, since the girl’s hands were tied at the moment. The small girl elbowed Valorie aside at first, trying to stand up on her own. However, her footing on the stairs made it awkward to stand, so she reluctantly took Valorie’s help. “Are you ok?” Valorie asked her, as she took a place next to her while Hadrian escorted them. “Like you’d care.” Contrary to what she said, she knew that Valorie cared. She sensed that Valorie did genuinely care for her wellbeing. But she didn’t know what emotions to trust anymore. Today has been proving that over and over. To pass the awkwardness, the Gryffindor began walking with a gait that showed an air of strength. As if she was strong and brave through anything. Valorie walked in stride with her for the hope she could see the same kindness and compassion she saw in the mysterious room. Trying to get an answer, Valorie struck up a conversation. “How long have you been a student here at Hogwarts?” The prisoner looked away, unwilling to speak. Internally frowning at the conversation fail, she tried again. “That room we were in was so cool. When did you first come across it?” Nothing. “Not much for talking, huh?” Valorie asked her. “I’d rather not swap pleasantries with my captors,” she said bluntly. She glared at Valorie, but the Riddle girl gave her a kind smile. “Ok. Suit yourself.” The captor glanced behind with her peripheral vision, seeing Hadrian make a face to convey that she better look forward and keep walking. Valorie saw this and the result of a worried look on her face. Instead of striking up a casual-ish conversation, she tried to ease the girl’s worries. “Sorry about him. Usually he’s really nice. As long as you don’t catch him in a mood.” She could tell that the prisoner was warming up to her, for she saw her shoulders slacken with comfort. “I’ve been meaning to thank you for saving Hadrian back there when you could have left him like that and escaped instead. That was really nice of you.” The prisoner scoffed in response. “Ok, well, I didn’t save him. That was more of the Professor's work back there. And besides, I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t going to hound on me as soon I tried to leave, ok?” The Gryffindor picked up her pace, with Valorie following suite. She gave her a genuine smile. “Thanks for saving us anyway. I’m Valorie, by the way.” Valorie hoped the Gryffindor girl would open up, at the very least reveal her name. Still, silence blanketed them both. “Alira.” Valorie looked in surprise as the Gryffindor took a deep breath. “My name is Alira.” Valorie smiled at the response. As the pair made their way down, Valorie noticed someone heading towards them. Happy since her transfer, Violet skipped up the stairs. “Hey, everyone!” Tailing beside Hadrian, she talked with Valorie. Alira recognized her as Neville’s little sister, the one who changed houses. As Violet danced around to greet everyone, she stopped short at Alira. “Oh! Who’s this?” she asked Hadrian. “Our prisoner,” Hadrian said. Violet frowned; nonetheless, she walked next to Alira. Curious to why Violet chose to leave the Gryffindors, Alira asked her about it. “You’re Neville’s younger sister, right? I’ve been meaning to ask you this: why did you leave the Gryffindor house for the Slytherins? If anything, you could have switched to Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, but you chose Slytherin. I thought you would have made a wiser choice, knowing what we learned about them from the start.” Valorie became interested in that. Since she has not been in school for long, she wanted to know what her classmates thought of her. Although, she can tell that they have a negative disposition of them. Violet began to recount her past. “It was because of Neville. Ever since I could remember, he always bullied me for the littlest of things. He always said that I wasn’t good enough to be his sister and never will be. When I had met with Professor Snape, he offered me a position by his side and a home with the Slytherins. I had enough of Neville’s insults, so I left. From what I have seen and experienced, the Gryffindors were more of the mean ones. Neville had turned them on me the first year I arrived and no one tried to defend me, make me feel welcome, or stay when I made my decision to leave. That’s why I left.” Alira hung her head. She felt Violet’s anguish as she recounted her past. Alira felt guilty for not helping her when she should have. “I’m so sorry. If I had been more attentive, I could have convinced the other Gryffindors to stop. I understand why you left, but what I still find puzzling is that you chose the Slytherins out of the other two houses. They’re Slytherins. How can you follow them? Slytherins are a dangerous threat to the magical community.” Valorie was taken aback by Alira’s statement. “You’ve never actually gotten to know a Slytherin, have you?” Valorie asked Alira. “Well, no, but from what I had seen with Malfoy, what else is there to know? The rest are just like him,” Alira fumbled her words. “You’re new here Valorie. You haven’t seen what Malfoy and his ‘delightful’ entourage have done. He started fights, insulted people who aren’t Purebloods, deliberately casted spells when it was forbidden, and broke many rules each year. And it’s not just him who is doing that. It’s all the Slytherins.” Valorie scratched her head in confusion. Her house has been nothing short of nice since her family arrived. Apparently, there was miscommunication and rumors being spread. “That doesn’t make any sense, Alira. I’ve seen the other Slytherins with my own eyes. They would not do something like that.” “Ok, did you really not know any of this? Students here know that there is not a witch or wizard who doesn’t turn in Slytherin. I mean, people call Slytherins evil.” Valorie tried to keep her composure while trying to defend the Slytherin side. “Who calls us that?” Alira looked at Valorie as if she had grown ten heads. This Slytherin was very naive compared to the others. “Everybody!” Alira said a little too loudly. A few heads turned when Alira shouted. Embarrassed by her outburst, Alira sheepishly smiled and hung her head. To keep her in check, Hadrian began shoving her with the hilt of her own sword. She yelped each time when the butterfly stone jabbed her back. The group descended the stairs in silence from then on. As they got to the dungeons, where only the Slytherins roamed, Hadrian began to violently force Alira to walk. He took hold of her shoulders and kept pushing her to the point where she stumbled every other step. Slytherins began to scorn her as she walked past them. Valorie tried to convince her brother to ease up, but he looked at her to be quiet. Finally reaching the door to the Potions classroom, Hadrian and the others walked in with Alira struggling against him.
He looked up at the ceiling, quite bored but well rested. It has been a few days since he had been admitted into the hospital wing. Tom and the rest of his family frequently visited him, even bringing little Amelia along. Severus knew that he couldn’t postpone his classes while he was recovering. The morning of his leave of absence, he asked Violet to take over his classes. They had to get past Dumbledore to see if she would be able to teach. Dumbledore stubbornly argued that Professor McGonagall or Flitwick should be the substitute until he returned. However, he was persistent in arguing that he wanted Violet to do it. Even though she did not have any teaching experience, her proficiency in potion-making was enough to convince Dumbledore to let her take over the class. All in all, the good outweighed the bad. “Severus.” He looked up to see Poppy call his name. “You have visitors.” She walked his family over him. Hadrian and Valorie rushed to his bedside; Tom trailed behind them with Amelia in his arms. “Mother!” the twins yelled. They each gave him a hug. “Severus,” Tom smiled. “How are you feeling today?” “Better. Thank you.” Severus placed a hand on his stomach. Thanks to Poppy, she had saved him and his baby. Severus turned to the twins. “Is your studies going well?” They nodded. “Yes. The classes are fine. We are learning more magic, although Potions is not as fun without you there,” Valorie hummed. “We also have been honing our fighting skills in our new training room. Once you are out of here, I would like to show you it. It’s amazing in there. Quite roomy and it has everything we could ever need.” Severus nodded to her. He looked to his son next. “Speaking of the founder and original resident of that room, how is the little swordsmith’s progress on our weapons? Anything new?” Hadrian shook his head. “No. The only thing she has been doing is rummaging around in the Potions cabinet for anything useful and mapping out our weapons. We shouldn’t be surprised though. Quite typical of a Gryffindor to slack off.” Valorie gave him a moderate nudge with her shoulder. “Will you lay off of her already? She has already been trying to help us and she is on our side. She is willing to help us, after all.” Hadrian nudged her back. “The reason that she is helping us is because we have her heart and she has no choice. You defending her is why father wants me to give the status updates about her. They don’t trust you since you trust her.” The two siblings nudged each other back and forth, quibbling over their standing. “Stop it, you two. As long as she managed to not destroy my supplies and put the Potions classroom in utter disarray, I can be fine with whatever she is doing. It’s her choice to slack off. It will be her fault if she does not complete the weapons in time and dies because of it. Also, please tell me the classroom is ok.” Tom stepped in while Hadrian and Valorie resumed their sibling-y fight. “It’s fine. Violet has been keeping it the way how it was left. She has been running the classes smoothly and also has been keeping up with work the Dumbledore has been requesting. You made the right choice making her your protege, Sev.” Tom handed Severus Amelia. He cradled her in his arms, while she reached up to grab his clothes. She grasped a part of his sleeve tightly, pulling it down to play with it. She made sounds as she waved his sleeve, pulling it back to Severus and then towards her arms again. Severus laughed as she played with him. Looking at her and then at the rest of her family, he felt happy that his family was there for him. He looked back at Amelia, smiling and reaching out for him. He kissed her forehead and grasped her hand in his. “I’m glad you are all here with me, he said as he looked down at Amelia. “Thank you for all you have done. I want to help you once I am better.” Poppy chimed into the conversation. “You can resume your work as professor, Severus. From observing you for the last few days, I have seen quite an improvement in your health. By tomorrow morning, you can leave and be with your family.” That news made Hadrian and Valorie stop fighting. They ran over to give their mother a hug and then gave Poppy one too. They were excited that their mother was ok again. “Thank you, Poppy,” Severus elated. “You’re welcome. Don’t overdo it with those glamour spells unless you absolutely have to, ok?” Severus nodded. At least he didn’t have to hear the reprimands from Narcissa’s condescending voice. Poppy let them stay for a little while longer. Severus kept Amelia in his arms the entire time. Hadrian and Valorie were talking about school, sometimes provoking each other and elbowing their sides. Even though it was only an hour, the sky was getting darker. “I think that your mother needs a little more rest for tomorrow. You’ll be seeing enough of him once he leaves.” Severus handed Amelia back to Tom. He gave her a little kiss as Tom took a hold of her. She cried a little, wanting to be back in her mother’s arms, but calmed down after Valorie played peekaboo with her. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Good-bye,” Severus smiled, giving them a small wave as they left the room. Severus readjusted himself, pulling the blankets more onto his stomach. He glanced down at it. The thought of it worried him that it was only going to get harder and harder to hide. “Severus, don’t worry. As long as you do as I say, everything will be fine.” Poppy seemed to read his mind. As she walked over, he raised any eyebrow at her keenness. “Ok, did you develop a power to read my mind?” Poppy chuckled at his joke. “No. You are clutching your stomach and looking at it with fear. It’s not hard to put the pieces together. Besides, healers are supposed to know how their patients are feeling.” She set down his medicine at his bedside, the bottle tapping the stand with a sharp clink. “Also, you are not great at hiding that worried look on your face.” He frowned at her, glaring as he gulped down the potion. “You’re mean.” Severus laid back onto his pillows, his head slightly touching the headboard. He relaxed himself as he knew that it was going to be a long day tomorrow.
. Harry’s eyes raked up and down his chest. He had almost-pointy shoulders that led to pale white biceps and noticeably muscled forearms. His chest was well defined with pecks that had just started to form; his nipples almost translucent. He had a six-pack that was barely detailed, but still there; his belly button an outie that seemed to complete the whole package.
He could tell when Harry had completely entered him and let out another shaky breath that turned into a laugh when Harry wrapped his arms around him and kissed his neck.
When he got his emotions under control again, he read the last line of letter once again. “Look for Severus Snape” his mother had said. It would be a cold day in hell before he turned to his head of house ever again. Snape had failed him last year, failed Harry when he needed him most, and so many people had been hurt because of it. After carefully folding the letter back up and putting it carefully back in the envelope, Harry picked up the other documents to take a look at them. The first page was a list, in his mother’s writing, of about 6 different addresses, some of which were listed in the country, with 2 listed in America. Did he really have this many properties? The last address was listed in Somerset, which according to his mother, was the house he would enjoy.
“Not the true extent of what you will be learning, but he knows that I plan on ‘taking you under my wing’ as it were.” Severus replied.
Nonverbal spell training took much longer than Harry had expected given the success that he had had when Draco had fallen asleep outside. He didn’t know why the following day had yielded different results from the previous night, but he jumped straight back into it.
Harry had one hand on the back of his head, making sure his mouth didn’t move, and the other was firmly planted on his arse, pulling him towards him and grinding their groins together.
Dumbledore spoke first. “First, you must understand that this is something that cannot be undone. Once something is protected under the Fidelius Charm, it will remain that way. If you were to die telling no one of its location, you would take the secret to the grave. No one would be able to find this place again. However, if you were to die having told two people of its location, then those two would become the new Secret Keepers, so it is imperative that you only tell those who you trust without a shadow of a doubt.
Harry sat in the kitchen until the sun had fully risen. He was still processing everything that Narcissa had said, still trying to find a reason for her telling him so much of their personal lives. Was she really just thankful for the small amount of protection and comfort Harry had been able to offer or was there something more to it? He was pulled from his thoughts when the kitchen door opened and Draco came in.
“Owls should be arriving any day with O.W.L results and school shopping lists. I’d be more than willing to arrange for someone to escort you when you head to Diagon Ally.” Dumbledore said.
“Yes, it’s alright. Just unusual.” Draco replied. “You can start moving; I’ll let you know if anything changes.”
“I don’t want to sound like I’m accusing you, but… I thought you said there were only two floors? Why can’t I open this door?” Harry inquired, curiosity burning in his voice.
It was unfortunate that the boy had seemingly inherited most of his traits from his father, and not his mother; so much wasted potential. From what he had seen of Potter, he was the exact opposite of what a Slytherin should be. He would often find him running headway into a situation without thinking things through properly, and the
He quickly noticed Potter’s tear-stained face and red puffy eyes and was slightly shocked that he couldn’t tell the boy was crying sooner. He had been totally silent in doing so, his voice being the only thing that gave him away. Severus hesitantly moved from his spot near the door and ended up hovering near the foot of Potter’s bed. With another wave of his wand, he had conjured a black wingback chair, which he promptly sank into.
Still, Draco did not move. It seemed he couldn’t hear them, too caught up in his own grief to listen.
“I think… Well, I know a lot of things could be answered if I just told you how I came to be here. How all of this…” Harry made a sweeping gesture to the lake, and the Manor in the distance, “came to be mine. If you have any questions after that, I could answer those.”
Draco had woken up to a strange pain in his back when he screamed out. Narcissa and Lucius came running into Draco’s room to find that their son had pitch black wings that were dripping with blood on the wooden floor of his bedroom.  Narcissa smiled and walked over to her son. “My little dragon. Your wings are beautiful.”  She said as she rubbed the soft black feathers of her son's wing causing Draco to purr. “ Go take a shower and get that blood off of you.” was all Narcissa said to the new veela. Once Draco had finished showering and getting dressed he smelled a sweet scent coming from the front room. Draco walked out front where he saw the dark lord and Severus. Then he noticed the boy next to them. “That’s where the scent is coming from.” was all Draco thought as he approached.  When his wings appeared so did the other boys.   The boy looked at him with a strange look before walking over and smelling Drace and his eyes widened. “Mine.” was all the boy said before attacking Draco with a hug, snuggling up to Draco’s chest. Draco, having no clue what was going on, looked at his parents with a confused look.  Narcissa just smiled and nodded her head. Lucius also gave him a look that said “go on.”  Draco turned his attention to the boy and realized that this was his mate.
Hadrian was left alone in the dining room when Draco went to the door. “He’s been out there for awhile,” Hadrian thought as he got up to go see who was at the door. He froze in his tracks. A girl who looked just like him was talking to Draco. “I’m Valorie. Valorie Riddle, Hadrian’s older twin sister.” Hadrian stood in shock as he heard what she had said. “I...have a sister? Why didn’t my parents tell me?” he asked himself. The idea of having a sibling never crossed his mind. Sure, he had Dudley in his old life. Yet, that pig was always more of a bully than family. He took a step closer to get a better look at his “sister”. The girl had his jet black hair. Her facial features were more curved and soft, giving her an attractive feminine vibe. Her skin had a pale sheen to it, as if she waited in the shadows’ wings most of her life. What surprised him the most was her eyes. She had pitch black eyes, dark as ink. The girl pushed her hair out of her face, making her barrette slip down her bangs. Her eyes turned blood red for a moment before she clipped it back in her hair. Hadrian thought it was strange that she voluntarily had a glamour spell placed on her. “Maybe she doesn’t like her eyes,” he thought. He unconsciously walked toward her a few more steps. Valorie noticed the boy behind the Malfoy kid and realized that was her twin brother. “Hello little Hadrian,” she called out. Draco turned around and jumped, startled by his mate. “Don’t sneak up on me like that!” he scolded. Draco gave him a small dig for emphasis. Valorie laughed in response. “I can see that my little brother has taken a mate. Draco Malfoy, I am not correct?” Draco was a little intimidated by her, shuffling close to Hadrian. Valorie loved it when people were scared of her, whether it was from her personality or from her fighting skills. “You’re fun to mess with Blondie,” she sniped at him. “I can tell we are going to get along just fine.” Hadrian looked at his newfound sister, struggling to find the right words to say. “S-so, y-you’re my sister?” he timidly asked. “That’s correct. Twin sister, if you want to be more accurate. Our parents had sent me away with our aunt, Elaina. They didn’t want Dumbledore to find out about my existence, so Aunt Elaina took me in and raised me. She told me now was the right time to come back home.” Hadrian didn’t have the slightest clue of what this girl was talking about. Aunt Elaina? Dumbledore trying to find out about her existence? It made no sense. He didn’t want to seem rude, so he just asked her about this Elaina person. “ Aunt Elaina? Why are you asking this?” she questioned. “Oh, right. You probably don’t know this yet. I don’t know why they didn’t tell you when they came for you. Elaina is our mother’s sister.” This was a lot of information to process in a couple of minutes, so he just put on a big smile, saving face. “Is Elaina with you?” Hadrian asked. Valorie smiled, glad that her brother wanted to meet the person she grew up with. “Yeah, she is. Hold on.” Valorie stuck her head out the door, searching for her aunt. “Elaina! Come here!” she yelled. A girl stepped out from behind a tree, revealing herself to the boys. “Oh. Sorry Val. I found an owl. It was so cute. Ah! Is this him? Is this my nephew?!” she squealed. Hadrian didn’t know what to make of this woman. She looked just like his mother, except she had long flowing hair and an everlasting twinkle in her eyes, like she found her destiny in the stars. Elaina ran straight for Hadrian, wrapping him in a bear hug. “Hades!” she squeaked. It is so nice to finally see you. You’re all grown up. I’m Elaina. You can call me Aunt Elaina. And just so you know, I’m a hugger.” She squeezed him tighter, suffocating him by the second. “It’s nice to meet you…” Hadrian puffed, trying to catch air. His aunt let go of him, finding a vase full of flowers more interesting at the moment. Valorie shook her head and chuckled. She knew her aunt was  aloof at times, but this took the cake. “Our aunt is...a bit of a free spirit you can say. A total opposite of our mother,” she said to Hadrian. With the arrival of his new sister and aunt, it started to become a bit surreal. Draco looked to Hadrian, trying to see if his mate was processing this well. When he looked in his eyes, he could tell this was a brain overload. Draco looked to Hadrian's aunt, who was fixing herself up in the hallway mirror. She looked to the boy, taking in his vibe. “You must be Draco Malfoy. I can tell from your shining blonde hair and your family’s symbol on your ring.” Hadrian’s aunt walked over to him and gave him a bear hug too. Draco was not one to get hugged from strangers, so he twisted away from her strong grip. “Put me down! What is wrong with you?!” he screamed. She backed away, glaring at him with disgust. “Really?” she said. “I just wanted to hug you. No wonder no one likes you,” she drawled. Aunt Elaina walked away from the boy, heading back to her nephew. Draco looked from Elaina to Valorie. “What is with this family?” he thought to himself. Draco stepped back, away from Hadrian and his new family members. Hadrian always thought that he would never have a real family. When he was still Harry Potter, he was told that his parents were murdered by the Dark Lord. Now, he was told that said Dark Lord was his father, the Potions Master who he was forced to hate was now his mother, the “bully” during his first three years of school was now his mate, and he now has an unknown twin sister and aunt. “Wow…I can’t believe this is real. I have a family. A big family. And they treat me like royalty,” Hadrian thought to himself. Hadrian’s twin sister interrupted his thoughts when she was talking about a fight with an assassin. She was talking as if it was no big deal. “So, this assassin was chasing me, but I was smart and hid in the trees. You know, they never look in the trees. Especially when it’s raining. At that moment, I ambushed her and used my magic. I killed her in record time too, ‘cause the lightning struck the tree and fell right where she was laying. Perfect way to hide her body. Made it as if it was an unfortunate accident. Now, we are done recounting my glorious moments, where is mother and father?” she quipped. “They are upstairs,” Draco responded. “I saw them head up when it became dark and Severus was acting weird when they went up.” Valorie was delighted to hear that her parents are with them. “Can I see them?” she asked Hadrian. “It has been so long for the both of us and I can’t wait to be reunited with them once more.” Hadrian had to step in her way because she was starting to climb the staircase. “I don’t think you should. Maybe when they come down on their own terms, you can reveal yourselves to them. “That sounds fair,” Valorie commented. “Come on, Aunt Elaina. Let’s get comfortable.” The two walked in tow to the living room, immediately putting their feet up on the couches. Draco already had enough from those two after they insulted and pushed him around as if he was dirt. “I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to bed,” he sulked as he went up to his bedroom. Elaina conjured a pastry in her hand, munching on it as she walked up to Hadrian. “Let him be. It’s probably too much for him right now. He does have a large family after all,” she said with her mouth full of crumbs. “Come on Hadrian. Talk to us about your life. How’s everything going?” Hadrian grimaced to himself, like he had a teaspoon of salt shoved down his throat. “It’s probably not up to your expectations of “the best life,” he said, trying to delay his awkward life story. “It’s fine. I do love hearing stories. Especially ones from our family,” Elaina comforted him of his fears. “Yeah, it’s not like our life was full of sunshine and rainbows either,” Valorie chimed in. Hadrian was relieved. He was glad that his family was so understanding. “Um…ok,” he whispered to himself, boosting his confidence to recount his darkest moments. “I was taken in by my fake Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. They were the ones that raised me. They didn’t treat me like their nephew. They saw me as a monster. Feared me for who I really was. They isolated me from the rest of the family, pretending I didn’t exist. When they did involve me, it was for me to do their chores. They worked me to the bone and their son, Dudley, kicked me around and bullied me. In those moments when they went way too far, my powers spiraled out of control. It punished them somehow. I even let a snake loose, which turned out to be my father’s. It was funny. In that week, I received my letter from Hogwarts. Hagrid the giant came and took me away from my aunt and uncle. I got my supplies and went off to Hogwarts. Now that I think about it, my school years were very confusing. I fought my father who I didn’t even know was my father at the time. I defeated an ancient evil that was sealed underneath the school. I guess what my classmates said about me being the heir to Slytherin was true. And last year, I found one of father's allies and my godparents. And now, here we are. I apparently am a completely different person, I have a family and a mate, and everything that I thought was true has been nothing but lies. What has happened to my life?” Hadrian sat down, reliving his key moments all over again. Everything he thought was good turned his back on him the moment he was involved, becoming the new evil that plagued his life. His old tormentors in the past three years became his new family. His true past and his identity have come forth now in the present, making him question what was real and what was not. Elaina, sensing his discomfort, hugged him. “I’m sorry you had to live through that Hadrian. Under different circumstances, we would have had a happy life, living out our days as a powerful and successful family. But now, we are here to change all that. I know we can’t erase what has been done, but we can make your new life happier than it ever has been before. Hadrian’s eyes lifted, a spark ignited inside him. A revelation had brought forth a new obstacle in his path. Under different circumstances, he would have lived with his real mother and father. Under different circumstances, he would’ve had a normal life. Now, because of this obstacle, it was threatening all he held dear. “Dumbledore,” he whispered.
“Meemy, would you mind showing me to an available room? I’d very much like to get some sleep. And I’m sure that I woke you with my arrival. What time is it, anyways?” Harry asked.
He turned back to Harry and captured him in a deep kiss that took Harry by surprise. He let it linger for a moment before he pulled away and slipped out of bed.
“We need to move. The Dark Lord is here and he has begun attacking my wards. They will keep him out for a short while, but nothing more. Finish your tea and meet me in the study. I will be right down.” Severus said, ignoring the worried looks that the Malfoy’s had, and headed out of the kitchen and up the stairs towards his potions room.
Petunia, who up until that moment had been trying to avoid looking at the intruder, immediately snapped her eyes to him. Realization dawned in her head, and Severus could see her pupil’s contract to tiny beads.
” at his own left hand. Immediately, it was slick with oil. He set his wand down at his side before rubbing the oil between his hands, warming it a little as he did so. Draco had been watching him with interest, and Harry was soaking it up. Harry then took Draco’s hand in-between his own and started lightly massaging it. Draco seemed a little tense at first, but the longer Harry worked, and the deeper he started to knead the muscles and pressure points, the more he relaxed. Harry started at his fingertips and worked his way down Draco’s hand, continuing past his wrist and down his forearm. Here, he applied a little more pressure, working the tight muscles under his hand.
The last thing he saw as he was whipped out of the kitchen was Voldemort standing in the doorway, his look one of pure rage.
The others were conversing lightly; Harry could hear Severus telling Dumbledore and Narcissa about a potion he was brewing that would enhance all of the five senses to a super-human like state. Harry listened for a moment before he turned his eyes to Draco. A smile tugged up on the boy’s face when Harry locked eyes with him.
He heard Draco gasp by the sink that he was leaning on and he looked over at him. Draco’s expression was one of shock and his hand seemed frozen in place, half way to covering his mouth. Harry walked over to him and held his face in between his hands.
“Severus, you are a wanted man. I dare say Voldemort wants you as much as he wants Harry, possibly even more. It would not be wise to send both of you to somewhere as easily accessible as Diagon Ally. If you wish to accompany Harry, then I must insist on having someone else there.” Dumbledore said.
As soon as Harry was on the other side of the door, he leaned against it and let his head bang against it.
“When you first entered my mind, you saw me pacing back and forth. At the time, I wanted you to see nothing, so I put my memories behind a mental barrier, if you will. And for now, this is what we’ll start with. It
“The secret of any good Occluder is the way they choose to hide their true memories and feelings, while providing a fictional train of memories. I personally choose a memory that has some truth to its base, and then twist that memory to suit my needs. For instance, the memory of me torturing the Dark Lord. Everything was real up to the point of me casting a curse at him. From there, I substituted my own reality.
It was late when Severus returned to Potter’s manor. He had stopped by Spinner’s End to pick up a few books he thought he might need in the coming days. Severus had made up his mind about a few things. One, Lily Potter’s son needed help. Two, he was in the prime position to offer that help and he would be damned if he stood by and did nothing. He was already regretting not offering the boy more help when he showed up at Hogwarts nearly 6 years ago. But, he wouldn’t dwell on past mistakes when there was so much work to be done.
He was going to make a BLT, something that was light, but would hold him over until dinner. He set about making it, using a simple household charm to clean and chop the lettuce and tomato while he cooked the bacon. He was about half way through the cooking process when he heard the door open behind him and heard someone shuffling their feet across the floor.
between us, you need to tell me the truth.” Snape said evenly, looking Harry square in the eyes. He could see his pupils dilate a second before he answered.
Harry walked over to the bed and laid against the pillows. He could see Draco looking at him out of the corner of his eye, but he couldn’t bring himself to meet his gaze.
The man would gradually pick the pace up and hold it there until Harry thought he would have to stop and then, seemingly reading Harry’s thoughts, would slow to a light jog again. He kept them at it for an hour, the end of which Harry was exhausted. His legs felt like jelly and he was sure he had never run so much in his life.
Remy paced endlessly in her mother’s office. Hadrian and the others were holding the fort down until her mother returned. Luckily, there were no crashes or shouts. No spells being cast or roofs collapsing in on themselves, so that means no one was arguing. Remy repeated her mother’s words like a song: “Pup, we need to talk later on. Once class is over, meet me in my office. Don’t look at anyone or say anything. Just discreetly go to my office.” Those words scared her. Remy expected them to talk and laugh, catch up on the days they weren’t together. She did not know if her mother was going to give her bad news. From his tone, it sure did sound like bad news. Tirelessly pacing, she ran the words back and forth in her head like it was the most impossible riddle in the world. In the midst of her pacing, she caught sight of a few of her mother’s belongings. She remembered seeing some of them when he taught last year, but she never paid much attention to them until now. Stacks of unfamiliar books lined countertops. There were tanks filled with many different creatures: grindylows, hinkypunks, changelings, and many others. Jars were filled with many materials: leaves, flowers, liquids, animal specimens, formaldehyde. Crystals, metals, and ores of many colors covered the desktop. Near her mother’s bedside, was a photo of him and his friends. Before Remy arrived at Hogwarts, her mother told her the story of the picture.
Chapter Two is out. I'm so sorry their short but I rather have short chapter with lots of details then a long chapter with not enough. FYI if you die from a cuteness overload don't blame me.
It was nightfall. The time to bring down Ron was finally here. While everyone else was asleep, Hadrian was the only one who was awake. As he passed Draco’s bed, regret from earlier came flooding like a tsunami. “I wish I could take that moment back,” he thought guiltily. He snuck out of the dorms, careful not to wake any of the Slytherins. Hadrian had to be very quiet, for the stairs creaked when he added the slightest bit of weight on it. Luckily, his classmates slept like the dead and were not awakened by the loud sounds. Hadrian creeped his way out of the dungeons and made his way to the stairs. When he turned to the giant stairway, all the ghosts were out on patrol. They floated around the staircases, keeping an eye out for each floor. Even Peeves was out on watch, a mischievous gleam in his eye. If the faculty sent Peeves to patrol the corridors, they meant business. Hadrian waited for the right moment, for the ghosts to not guard the area near the girl’s bathroom. He tip-toed as quickly as he could to the entrance. None of the ghosts saw him, so he was safe for the time being. The young man tried to open the door, but it was locked. “Alohomora,” he whispered. He swung the door open. No one was there. As Hadrian made his way to the entrance of the Chamber of Secrets, he heard a familiar voice crying her eyes out. Moaning Myrtle was floating over her windowsill, weeping her sorrows out. When she heard Hadrian’s footsteps, she looked over to where he was standing. “Harry? Harry, is that you? It has been awhile, hasn’t it? I have been waiting so long for….Wait, you're not Harry.” Hadrian walked closer so she could see his face. “Hi, Myrtle,” he said to her. The ghost cocked her head in confusion. She had never met the boy, and yet he knew her name. “I have never seen you before. Who are you? How do you know my name? Did one of your classmates tell you to come and make fun of me? If so, get lost!” Hadrian turned to look at the ghostly girl and smiled at her. “My name is Hadrian Riddle. You knew me before as Harry Potter. Before the new term had started, I took an inheritance test and found out who I really was.” Myrtle was intrigued. She floated over to Hadrian and studied the boy. “Hmmm. It’s nice to have a somewhat familiar face here. I can see that you take on much of your father’s looks. You look even more handsome as Hadrian, Harry,” she flirted. Hadrian rolled his eyes. It seems that girls were in the mood to flirt with him today. “Please, call me Hadrian.” Myrtle flipped over on her back and laid down in the air as if she had no care in the world. “So, what are you doing down here, Hadrian? Shouldn’t you be asleep like your other classmates?” Hadrian decided to tell her about his plan since she was trustworthy. “I’m here to take down my former friend, Ron, who now is a traitor to me. You aren’t going to stop me, are you?” he asked. Myrtle shook her head. “I wouldn’t dream of doing that. Your mother told me that if I were to ever meet his son, I should befriend him. Besides, we are pretty close,” she said as she held out her hand to caress his cheek. Her hand went through his face and sent a cold shiver down his spine. She floated back to her spot by the windowsill and perched on it like a cat ready to pounce. “Taking down that Ron Weasley sounds like a dream. After his constant insults two years ago, I have grown to despise that boy. I am happy to help you in any way that I can, Hadrian,” Myrtle declared and punched the air for emphasis. Hadrian thought about it. Having Moaning Myrtle help him wasn’t a bad idea. Besides, she can keep a secret and is in no harm from Dumbledore. After all, she is dead. “I think you can help me. I am going to lure Ron down here. When he enters here, I want you to tell him that his sister is in the Chamber of Secrets, begging for help. If that doesn’t motivate him to enter, flood the bathroom and drown him.” Myrtle smiled at the thought. “Gladly,” she accepted. Hadrian walked to the entrance of the chamber, tracing the snake design with his finger. “Chamber of Secrets! I command you to open for Hadrian Riddle, son of Tom and Severus Riddle and heir of Slytherin!” he hissed in Parseltongue. The entrance lowered itself and opened up, leaving a giant hole in the girl’s bathroom. “I’ll see you later, Myrtle.” Hadrian hopped down into the chamber and slid down into the darkness. As Hadrian made his way down to the center of the labyrinth, the guilty feeling he pushed down minutes ago came back. “I had recruited Moaning Myrtle to help me and left Draco out. I am a terrible person. I wish I could take that moment back.” Every ten seconds, the words: ‘I wish I could take that moment back’ plagued his thoughts. That nagging voice was screaming louder and louder inside his head. “I wish I could take that moment back….Ugh. Stop thinking like that, Hadrian. Focus on the task at hand. You won’t help Draco with that attitude.” Hadrian had entered the center of the chamber, the remains of the former basilisk littered on the ground. If the creature had known he was the heir or if Hadrian had known that two years ago, they wouldn’t have fought each other. Hadrian stepped to the center of the room, held out his wand, cleared his mind, and focused on Ron Weasley. He imagined his thoughts overpowering Ron’s. He pictured Ron completely blooded and close to death before having his head cut off.  Hadrian made his way to the statue that sat in the very back of the chamber where he noticed an egg shell. Hadrian walked closer and saw a baby basilisk sitting amongst the shells. “Hi, Buddy.” Hadrian hissed at the baby basilisk as he reached his hand out to pick it up. “I need you to hide. I’m going to kill someone and they might hurt you.”  The basilisk decided to trust Hadrian and hid in the boy's cloak. Hadrian hid in the shadows and waited.
GORE WARNING. Don't like please skip. We'll give a warning in the chapter so you know were it starts and ends
Turning back into his snake form, Tom watched his children head to their next class: Transfiguration. He knew that McGonagall was going to have one heck of time trying to keep her cool while teaching the class with his children  and their mates there. Tom decided to go slither around the castle and keep a low profile. Since the castle was still looking for the ‘killer’, traveling out in the open was not a good idea. He took the high ground and used the beams holding up the pillars to hide in the shadows. As he went through the corridors, he passed many students who were hurrying to their classes. A few ghosts floated around, guarding the doorways to see who was passing. Luckily, they did not look up as Tom sneaked past. Tom’s job was to stealthily gather information about any plots against his family. The first and most obvious choice was to check first was Dumbledore. He made his way up the stairs, listening to as many conversations as he could. Most of them were about classes and schedules, and Moody’s death. Nothing odd to note about. Tom arrived at the secret staircase where Dumbledore’s office lay hidden. Since the office was guarded by a griffin statue and a password, Tom had weaved his way behind it and scaled the wall to the door. It was open slightly, a small crack peeking out. As Tom slithered in, he heard Dumbledore talking to someone. He recognized it as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s voice. “...and you are sure that they are of the Riddle family?” Tom instantly straightened when he heard Shacklebolt say that. He took position on top of a bookshelf that was covered with many magical objects and trinkets. “Yes, I’m sure.” “What about the daughter of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin?” Dumbledore made a face just thinking about it. “Her name is Remy Lupin-Black and is also Slytherin. I highly doubt they know that the Weasley twins are actually Lestrange twins.” Tom couldn’t believe it. Bellatrix also had twins that were taken from her. “That’s why Bellatrix went insane. She missed her boys so much.” Tom’s mind was racing when he realized that Dumbledore took from his second best Death Eater. Like what he did to him, he took Bella’s children. “What is their real name?” Kingsley asked, not knowing that he was doing Tom a favor. “Christopher and William Lestrange. Aside from them, let us plan to get  the Riddle twins on our side.” Hearing this made Tom furious. They planned to use his children against him. “I thought that Tom only had a single child, not twins.” Kingsley looked at Dumbledore with a questioning look. “Turns out he and whoever his mistress is had twins. “They’re so stupid. Too bad they don’t remember that it’s Severus, but I must keep my guard up.” Tom stayed in his spot, watching the two men talk about how they could get Hadrian on their side. Once they left, he slithered down from his place on the shelf and made his way to Severus’s class, which was just ending and the students had an hour break. After what seemed like forever, all the students left and he made his way into the class to find that Severus had shattered vials on the back shelf and a silver knife in the wall. “What happened here?” Tom turned into his human form as the door shut and walked over to Severus, who covered his head with his arms. “Severus? Are you ok?” Severus looked up from his arms with an annoyed look on his face. “I. Hate. Gryffindor.”
“That awful Skeeter woman! Harry’s sidekick...I was more than just ‘a sidekick’. And ‘odd friend’? I’ll show her ‘odd friend’.” Valorie covered her mouth, shushing her before she could say anything else. “Quiet, Rem. Do you want everyone to know?” Remy slackened her shoulders and calmed herself. Hadrian snatched the paper for himself and read every word. This time, he freaked out. “That’s insulting! Seriously, they think that mother is a female when clearly he is not. And they called father ‘mean’! Skeeter obviously has her facts wrong and Dumbledore is an idiot for having her write that.” Draco took Hadrian’s rant as his cue to make him stop talking. He stuffed a jelly tart into Hadrian’s mouth. “Hades, calm down.” Hadrian nearly choked on it, but he was able to swallow it without any harm. “Are you kidding me, Dray? You could’ve choked me to death!” Draco rolled his eyes. “Like your sister said, do you want the world to find out? If not, then shhh! And that is also for not letting me go on last night’s escapade.” “I thought you were fine!” Hadrian retorted. “Well I am now.” Draco lashed back. Violet was watching them as if it was a comedic play. By the time breakfast was over, the couples were no longer lashing out at each other. Violet took off in the direction of her classes and the rest of them walked down into the dungeons where Potions took place. They had to make a Draught of Peace for class today. Everyone got top marks. When it was time for their second class for Potions, Hadrian took the time to show his mother the article. “Mother?” Severus turned to his son. “Yes Hades?” “Look at this.” Hadrian handed The Daily Prophet to his mother. “This is certainly a pressing concern. But, I highly doubt that anyone will take Ms. Skeeter’s words seriously. That newspaper is nothing but propaganda and lies. There will be many loyal readers that will believe her, but there are also those who see past it and know that there is something beyond that.” Severus told his son. “But, mother, shouldn’t we try to keep the news under wraps?” Hadrian asked him. Severus shook his head. “No. Just let it continue. People will believe what they want to believe and we cannot change that. It will also scare Dumbledore and might make him slip up. We should use this to our advantage.” Hadrian nodded. As much as it scared him that the newspaper might expose him and his family, they had to just roll with it. Do the things they could control. When Potions class was over, Hadrian’s plan began to unroll. He looked himself over in the mirror hanging in the classroom. Every hair on his head was perfectly coiffed and the blood on his robes stood out like crimson flowers. He walked out of the classroom in step with Valorie, Draco, and Remy, his head held high. They arrived at the Transfiguration classroom. The door was open a few inches. Hadrian could hear the Gryffindors talking. He tuned his ears to the conversation and backed away step from the door so they could not see him. “...Don’t you guys think that this is weird? Yesterday, those disgusting Slytherins barged into our common room and made threats. And the next day, Ron is missing. I have not seen him since yesterday. I hope he is ok.” Hadrian took that as his cue and slammed the door open. The Gryffindors’ heads swiveled around to see Hadrian. Silence filled the room more than any sound could. As he and the others walked toward their desks, the Gryffindors stared at the red splotches that dotted his robes. “Blood. He’s covered in blood,” the Gryffindors thought. Hadrian glared at anyone who looked like they were to approach him. The Gryffindors clicked the two pieces together about Ron’s disappearance and Hadrian’s bloodstained robes: Hadrian killed Ron last night. “He killed Ron. That monster killed Ron.” By the time Hadrian and the others sat down, they were too panicked to say anything. Professor McGonagall walked into the room and briskly sat at the head of the room. She did roll call to make sure that everyone was there. When she neared the end, she called out Ron’s name. “Ron Weasley? Ron Weasley? Has anyone seen Mr. Weasley?” Lavender spoke up while keeping her eyes downcast. “I have not seen him today, Professor. Maybe he is out sick.” Her voice trailed off as she peeked a quick look at Hadrian and squeaked in terror when they made eye contact. McGonagall penciled that reminder into her notes. “I will have a talk with Mr. Weasley later so he can catch up on his classwork.” The class was as slow as a flobberworm. Professor McGonagall gave a lecture the entire time. The Gryffindors engrossed themselves into taking meticulous notes. They did not want to anger Hadrian or any of the others by unconsciously looking in their direction. Hadrian wanted to laugh so much. Seeing the Gryffindors terrified of him was hilarious. He glanced at Remy, who seemed far away in her thoughts. Remy tried her best to follow along, but something weighed heavily on her mind. Hadrian waved the feathery side of his quill in front of her face. She was startled from her trance and made a face at Hadrian. “What are you doing? Focus on your work,” she whispered. Hadrian nudged her arm. “Funny. I could say the same to you. What’s on your mind, Remy?” Remy knew there was no way of getting out of this. Back when they were just Harry and Hermione, he could tell if she was feeling off. That’s what happens when you grow to be close friends. “Well, I’m just worried about my mother. I am very glad that he is here with me, but I wonder if that will only put him in danger. Am I...being selfish?” Hadrian put his hands on his friend’s shoulders. “Look, Rem. I know that you care for your mother a lot, but remember: he knows how to take care of himself. He would not be the DADA teacher if he didn’t. As for you, you have placed other’s needs before your own. It’s ok to be selfish every now and then.” Remy felt more relaxed. “Thanks, Hadrian. I really appreciate that. But, I am also going to talk to Mother and see how he feels about this.” The girl returned to her notes, but she looked more relaxed and had a small smile across her face. She worked vigorously through the notes to try and understand the lecture. Professor McGonagall let her students leave early since she finished her lecture before the bell rang. Hadrian, Remy, Draco, and Valorie left before any of the Gryffindors. Their exit made them feel like they were royal nobles and the rest were just lowly servants. The Gryffindors did not want to cross paths with Hadrian, so they stayed back for a few minutes and let him leave. Hadrian and the others turned to another hallway and laughed their heads off. “That. Was. Hilarious!” Hadrian laughed. “I saw their faces when we entered and exited the classroom!” Valorie chuckled. Draco began to mimic the Gryffindors terrified faces. “Oh, Hadrian, don’t hurt me! Ahhh! That was too good!” They double over, their laughter echoing. They arrived at their DADA class early so Remy could check on her mother. “Hello mother.” Remus turned around to face his daughter. “Hello Remy.” Hadrian walked over to the werewolf to greet him. “What are we learning about today, Professor?” “Just simple dueling today.” Hadrian smirked at that. “Now I can scare the Gryffindors even more.” Hadrian went and sat down with Draco and his sister. The Gryffindors started to arrive and took their seats far away from Hadrian. “Ha! Weirdos,” he thought as the Gryffindors eyed his every move. Hadrian and the others were eager to start dueling, especially Valorie. She was summoning her scythe in and out of existence behind her back. “I really want to rip those Gryffindor scum to shreds. We can use our scythes in the duel, right Hades?” she asked her brother, a malicious gleam in her eye. Hadrian shook his head, for he was disappointed too. “No. We only use our wands in dueling. Nothing else.” Valorie deflated at her brother’s response and her smile turned into a giant frown. “Dang it,” she pouted. She twirled her blade before she tossed into her other hand and poofed it out of sight. Remus stood in the middle of his classroom on top of a raised, narrow platform. He had his wand in hand and looked at the large crowd of students that surrounded him. “Welcome, students. As you know, I am Professor Lupin and I am honored to be teaching here again. Now, you are all familiar with dueling, yes?” Everyone nodded their heads, even Valorie who gave a half-hearted nod. “Very good,” Remus continued. “I am going to review how to duel, so there are no accidental injuries today.” All Gryffindors glanced at Hadrian and knew right away that he had a trick up his sleeve. Hadrian gave an innocent wave that made the Gryffindors shudder. “I need a volunteer to help me out. Who would like to help me demonstrate how to duel?” Remy immediately shot her hand up in the air and nearly stood up. Remus knew that his daughter was eager to help him, so he gladly called on her. “Remy! Come on the platform.” Remy rushed to the steps as quickly as she could and popped next to her mother’s side. “I am so glad that I can help you mother. I’ll do anything to aid you.” Remus was touched by how loyal his daughter was. He placed a gentle hand on her shoulder and smiled. “You make me very proud, little Pup.” Remus turned back to the crowd. “So, first, you need your wand out,” he motioned to his students as his daughter drew out her own wand. They both took a few steps closer until they were face-to-face. “Greet your partner by swinging your wand to your side, then bow.” Mother and daughter moved in sync, their movements swift like a pack of wolves. “Once you bow, turn and take twenty paces away from your partner and have your wand at the ready.” Remus and Remy pointed their wands at each other. This reminded her of when they were at the Malfoy manor and practicing dueling in the training yard. They repeatedly practiced their spells until it was perfect. Looking back, it was such a simpler time. They had barely strung together an idea to take down Dumbledore. Now, here they were: back at school and executing their best laid out plans. Remy focused herself back on the present, focusing on the demonstration. “...we are only using the approved attack and defense spells. I am now going to attack Remy, and she is going to block my spell. Block it successfully, and you will nullify the spell’s effects. Expelliarmus!” Remus’s spell shot towards his daughter. Remy became focused and remembered her training. She blocked out the world around her and imagined that the spell would disappear. “Finite Incantatem!” she yelled. Her mother’s spell fizzled out halfway towards her. Remy was happy that she was able to block the spell. Last time there was a demonstration for dueling, that idiot for a teacher Lockhart was blasted onto his butt when he tried to duel Hadrian’s mother. Everyone was impressed and cheered. Her classmates seemed to have found a new Hermione Granger. If only they knew the truth. Remy and Remus bowed for their audience. “Thank you, Remy. Now, all of you will practice these spells on phantom opponents.” Remus summoned the phantoms. Several blue columns of light filled the edge of the room. A glowing phantom of a scowling witch or wizard manifested in place. “I will survey all of you until you are ready. Once practice is done, I will call on two students to duel on the platform. Go find a phantom and practice those spells,” he instructed. The rest of the students began to duel. Before Remy ran off to practice, her mother stopped her suddenly. “Pup, we need to talk later on. Once class is over, meet me in my office. Don’t look at anyone or say anything.  Just discreetly go to my office.” Remy gave a small nod and headed off to a phantom without looking back. She found an unoccupied phantom next to Hadrian and began to shoot offensive spells at it. After she felt satisfied with her skills, she took a small break and observed Hadrian. He was going full offensive on his phantom. One after another, he shot spells out of his wand, some of which he did not even say out loud. His phantom was starting to cower in fear and not even bother to try and defend itself. Hadrian’s eyes turned red for a brief moment, his emotions clearly getting the better of him. “Hades, calm down. The phantom isn’t going to do anything if you keep shooting spells at it.” Hadrian’s growl scared everybody in the room, causing them to stare at him. “What?! Stop staring! Not my fault that the phantom is afraid of me!” Hadrian growled again before non-verbally shooting a killing curse at the phantom. The phantom fell to the floor: dead. “Alright, let’s start dueling. Hadrian and Ginny are first.” Remus clapped and everyone gathered around the platform. Hadrian and Ginny walked up to the platform and got ready. “Are you two ready?” Remus said as the two fighters nodded. Hadrian and Ginny bowed to each other and walked twenty paces away. “Ready?! Begin!” Ginny started with a simple spell to try to disarm Hadrian. Hadrian easily deflected the spell. She tried again to no avail. Hadrian decided that it was his turn. “Legilimens!” Ginny screamed as Hadrian was able to worm his way inside of her mind, seeing when his adopted baby sister was born. That memory fueled the anger smoldering inside him. “So, you ran into the forest after your daughter was born to keep your mother from finding out and just left her to die. Well, I know you will not make ‘mother of the year’. Relashio!” Ginny’s wand flew out of her hand and into Hadrian’s. With Ginny’s wand in hand, he gave her a psychotic grin as he pocketed it. She looked around helplessly, looking to see if anyone would help her. “Someone! Stop him! He took my wand and that’s not fair in a duel. Professor! Tell him to give back my wand. Please!” Remus just stood there, watching as Hadrian advanced towards the Weasley girl a few steps. “Professor! Please, help her! This isn’t right.” a Gryffindor girl pleaded. Remus held up his hand to silence the student, leaving the rest of the students to watch Ginny Weasley fall to her demise. “I told you not to press your luck with me Ginny, or you’ll end up with a fate worse than death. Apparently, you did not heed my warning. Now, it’s time for your punishment! Stupefy!” Ginny was sent flying to the edge of the platform. She was stunned for a few seconds before she was able to move. Holding her side, she struggled to her feet. “Stop this Hadrian! You keep talking tough, but….” Ginny was hit with another stun spell, silencing her. “Shut up!” Hadrian yelled at her, his voice becoming more beast-like. His eyes flickered a dark red until they started to glow brightly. A Gryffindor girl saw this and tried to get onto the platform to stop him. She raced toward the stairs as fast as she could, but Hadrian stopped her. “Confringo!” The edges of the platform erupted into flames, preventing anyone from climbing on. The girl’s cloak was singed by the fire, but she was able to put it out. She tried to look past the flames to try and spot Hadrian and Ginny, but the fire was too big, too out of control. The girl pulled her hood close around her face and stepped away from the burning platform, for there was nothing she could do. Hadrian returned to the cowering Weasley, who was coughing from the smoke. The flames brightened his blood-stained robes, giving him an even more menacing air. Hadrian smiled at Ginny, glad that she was overtaken by fear. He decided to take it step further. “Crucio!” he yelled. Ginny felt pain unlike anything she felt before. Pain like fire-dipped daggers flooded through her body. She clenched her teeth, trying to keep her pain hidden, but it was unbearable. She could not tell the difference from the heat of the fire and the heat of the pain. Her blood felt like lava, her lungs searing dry, her organs overheating from the pain. Ginny let out a sharp cry, her shrieks echoed throughout the room. Fueled by Hadrian’s emotions, the fire grew bigger and bigger, and the pain grew worse and worse for Ginny. When the cruciatus curse began to wear off, Hadrian used the same wordless magic he used on the phantom. He did not hold back. He let out all of his anger towards Ginny through her torture. “You. Never. Should. Have. Abandoned. Your. Daughter. Ginny!!” Hadrian yelled, emphasizing each word with each spell he cast. The anger he felt on the inside began to show on the outside. His wings emerged from his back, black feathers falling around him and smoldering in the flames. The Gryffindors screamed at the fiery-feathery sight. They were too shocked to do anything. Hadrian walked closer to Ginny. To her, he looked like a giant that was ready to pound her into oblivion. “Stop! Stop it!” she coughed. Hadrian knelt down to study the expression on her face. Ginny desperately wanted to flee, but her body resisted. The young Riddle chuckled to himself. “I noticed that I seem to capture the same expression in the victims I torture. Defiance, giving way to absolute fear.” He raised his wand and unleashed a spell that brought pain upon her. “Enough!” Remus yelled over the commotion. Hadrian’s wings retreated into his back and his eyes dimmed till every speck of red disappeared into a black void. The fire that surrounded the platform fizzled out into smoke and ash. The once inferno of a classroom revealed a very angry Hadrian and a wounded Ginny struggling for help. Ginny was in bad shape. She laid in a crumpled heap, battered and bruised. She had quite a number cuts and burns on her arms and face; her body throbbed in pain. Blood steadily spilled from her mouth. Everyone watched in fear as Hadrian made his way down the steps to Draco. “Hades, are you ok?” Hadrian just gave him a blank look. Draco placed his hands on Hadrian’s face and shook it to snap him out of his trance. “Hades, come on! Snap out of it!” After shaking him back to his senses, Draco pointed Hadrian to his creation of destruction. Remus knelt by Ginny’s side, checking to see how she felt. After a minute, he levitated her body. He turned to his student’s with a grim expression, yet with a hint of smile. “I’m going to take Ms. Weasley to the hospital wing. No one is to leave this classroom until I get back. If I find that any of you set the class into chaos, all of you will be sent to detention.” He walked away with Ginny’s body floating behind. Unknowingly to everyone, a shadow slipped out the door along with Ginny and the professor. Hadrian walked over to Valorie, Draco, and Remy. Together, they looked at the cowards who called themselves Gryffindor. A smile crept onto Hadrian’s face. “Ginny Weasley is as good as gone.”
