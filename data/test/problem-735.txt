“Er- I couldn’t sleep.. Would you be a nice cat and purr for me ?” Harry asked, almost pleading. “Please.”
Draco stayed for a bit, staring at Luna. Could he really trust her ? Maybe. But at the same time, Potter didn’t know it was him under the fur. So if Potter needed a cat to pet, maybe Draco could help him, as a way to repay the savior. Eventually, he meowed back at Luna and licked his paw.
The discussion turned into lighter subject when Harry attention get drawn to the couch again. This time, he saw Crookshanks giving a slightly head stroke at Magnolia, before leaving to follow Hermione.
“Don’t know yet, will tell you. Anyway, don’t wait for me at breakfast. I don’t know how long it will take.” Harry answered casually, his hands deep in his jeans pocket under his opened robe.
Slightly, as Magnolia was fixing the door heading to the girl dormitory, Harry moved cautiously toward the cat.
Hogwarts a year ago. Harry didn’t know exactly what she lived during the last year, nor she what he lived. They were on a different page now, too different, and the feelings had evolved too much.
“Why you called him prince then ?” Hermione asked a bit coldly. “He has nothing to do with Salazar Slytherin.”
“ You know who was working on the restoration ?” Hermione asked, letting Crookshanks jumping on the ground.
“Of course, there is still an empty bedroom in the eighth room dormitory and the professors are waiting for you. I don’t doubt you will be able to catch the different classes.”
Draco was sure he would be red as a tomato if he wasn’t hide by the white of his fur. Just by picturing Potter naked under the water. Well, he already did it when he was younger, but it wasn’t his fault ! Potter was quite charming even if he was a insufferable and pretentious git, and as a teenager, it was hard to resist to the hormones. But as he was panicking, not knowing how an actual cat would act. After all, he didn’t want to raise any suspicion if he was a cat or an animagus. It would be too much humiliating.
Draco snapped his head up, about to say that he didn’t need to be safe. However, his nose bumped into Potter’s one, their lips suddenly so close that they were brushing. Panicked, he closed his eyes, not bold enough to move an inch. Suddenly, he felt Potter’s hand slipping inside his own, grabbing his fingers and and holding his hand. Draco couldn’t resist to close his fingers around Potter’s. And then, Potter’s lips moved, slowly, slightly, until they reached Draco sharp cheek, and he let light kiss on it.
So Draco crawled out, to discover that there were no teacher around. Contrariwise, there were just four students. They were chatting and Draco slipped between Potter’s legs because of course it would be Potter who that on the couch. Around, there were Luna, Granger and Longbottom, as usual the two last didn’t pay much attention to him but Luna just let her hand down and brushed his fur while he passed by her. Draco went hidden behind a armchair, and lied down.
After a couple of hours, Luna went back to her room and Draco welcomed her with a meow and went to rub himself against her legs.
But Harry got cut on his sentence by Malfoy lips fucking crushing on his own, and for a moment, Harry didn’t know how to move, how to breath, how to function properly like a normal human being. Malfoy pulled back, some traces of his old tears painting his blushing cheeks.
Once they arrived in the headmistress office, Harry noticed immediately that it looked quite differently from when Dumbledore was occupying the place. More tidy, and neat.
Looking away again, Draco pinched his lips, making them a thin line, and Harry wanted to kiss them again.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, he was so happy that Malfoy was able to answer his good night that he just grabbed his hand a bit to roughly, making the now smaller boy startle. Harry was about to withdraw his hand, but Malfoy just closed his fingers on his own, their fingers intertwined. Harry’s smile grew wilder, as he kept watching Malfoy side, his face illuminated by the white light of the moon.
Those two months was the greatest in many years, his head was only focus on work, no thoughts about the previous two years, about the fear, about the hate, about being killed, about worse, about his father, about his mother safety, about Potter. And this work helped, a bit, at day at least. However, the nights were awful, full of nightmares and almost blurry memories. And that was the reason that lead to Draco mistake.
“I’m gonna take a night shower, you can join me, but no watching ! I know you, the cats, you wouldn’t believe how many times I found Crookshanks watching me under the shower.” Potter whispered.
Without thinking, Draco followed Granger when she get out of the common room and ran way faster to go down the Astronomy tower. When he eventually reached the corridor that lead to the Great Hall, he stopped running and started to walk and wander, letting his thoughts run free. He needed to be sure he could used his ability again to turn in and out his animagus form with ease before going to see professor McGonagall. But did he really want to ? Because, if he went to the professor, he would have to go to class with the other eighth year students, with the entire school that probably -no surely- hated him,and it was well-deserved. He would have to just stay there and worst than that, Potter would be among them. Draco meowed pitifully, grabbing the attention of few young students around, that cooed at him and tried to pet him. But he didn’t want to, he didn’t deserve to and hissed
“ I’m glad to see you again, and that you seem to feel better. I supposed you are here for your set up ?”
“This summer.” Potter snickered. “Upset that I’m taller now ? You won’t be able to look down on me now.” He added in a tease.
Harry answer with a aggressive kiss, he grabbed Draco by his waist, and pressed his body against his. He kissed this time, a real kiss, opened mouth. Without waiting, he pushed Draco on the bed, deepening his kiss. But when Draco moaned into his mouth, Harry lost his mind, his hands roamed all over the tiniest body. He broke the kiss and looked at Draco, his hair sticking in every direction.
After playing at exploding snap for three hours straight, Harry eventually went back to his room to get ready for the shower time. Malfoy left him about two hours ago, disturbed in his nap by the scream of Seamus, when he realized that Dean was in fact cheating. Harry petted Malfoy head quickly, who was napping on his bed, and headed to the bathroom.
“Of course not, but if you want, I can lend you some pajamas, it doesn’t seem comfy to sleep in your uniform.”
“There is no way we share a compartment with Gryffindors.” She hissed, looking up at Blaise. “ I still prefer to stay in the bloody corridor !”
“Because I hope it would calm you down, and yes I know it’s crazy. But hey, I had to face reality.” Harry ended with a shrug.
One breath, two breath and suddenly, Parkinson was about to turn sharply when Zabini layed a hand on her shoulder, still blocking her way out.
Thus, Draco decided to enjoyed the time left by doing nothing. He literally acted all day like a cat in his human form and he had to admit it was kinda satisfying. The only break was when he turned back into a “Magnolia” to go pick some food in the kitchen.
Suddenly, Draco noticed his blond hair was in front of his eyes, and chocked on his spit, the reality hit him hard, and he tried to flee immediately. He pushed up on his arms but he was blocked by sodding Potter. The said-Potter muttered in his sleep and moved a little. Draco didn’t hesitate and pushed harder. He couldn’t stay here, there was absolutely no way he could stay in Potter arms while he was in his human form, no way. Damn it.
But he regretted immediately, his eyes getting wide in fear, he curled up even more, like it could protect him.
“Not a word.” Parkinson answered this time, surprisingly. “And with Mr Malfoy in Azkaban and Narcissa in France, we don’t know anything.” She blinked quickly, and inhaled a quick big breath, and turned his head.
“Come with me, Potter, the hallway isn’t a place to have this kind of conversation.” McGonagall said after a long moment of silence.
He was still wondering, regretting his choice to leave Luna’s room when Potter picked him up, and started to carry him, pushed the cat formed against his chest, a hand caressing his furry back. Draco tried to think of a plan to escape Potter big ô too big and soft hands, but those terrible hands was relaxing him. As soon as they entered the bathroom, he let Draco down and started to quickly get undressed. Draco could understand that the teenager was in a hurry, but still, he could be a bit more decent !
Ron had been Harry's first ever friend, ever since they'd sat together on their way to Hogwarts for their first year. His friend had welcomed him into his wonderful wacky family without a second thought, even going so far as to break him out of his bedroom after his muggle relatives had locked him up during the summer between his first and second years, using his dad's flying car to do so and had become something akin to a brother to Harry.
The Hogwarts Headmaster took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it, extinguishing all of the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins and plunging the Great Hall into a state of semi-darkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the entire room, the bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames painful of the eyes.
This time it seemed that only the bushy haired girl was unaffected by what was going on as she let out a deep, dramatic sigh, closed her book as loudly as she could and announced,
, one student on either side as they dropped their slips in. Draco was last, finding himself paired up with Ramona this time rather than Lara, and hesitated a fraction of a second before he released the piece of parchment into the flames.
“He's just a Quidditch player, Ronald,” Hermione huffed, pulling him along by the sleeve of his ill-fitting jumper as he began to gush once more about the wonders of Viktor Krum. “Honestly, sometimes I don't know what to do with you…are you
“Not pitiful,” Javier hurried to reassure him. “But we did think you looked a little bit lonely all by yourself so we decided that now would be the perfect time to introduce ourselves.”
Dumbledore seemed to lose track of himself for a moment, behave like the forgetful old man he appeared to be and going on about an excellent joke he'd heard regarding a troll, a hag and a leprechaun walking into a bar. They'd never get to hear the punchline as a Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly, breaking his unexpected train of thought.
“I am glad to find you all here,” Madame Maxime addressed her gathered students in her own native tongue, moving to stand directly behind Draco so that she could place her large hands on his shoulders. “I hope that you will all give Draco your full support and any help that he may or may not require as he represents our school in the
“A picture of your parents outside their house,” she continued, snorting cruelly. “If you can even call
Personally Draco couldn’t understand why anyone under the age of seventeen would even want considering how dangerous and deadly the Tournament was known to be. Truthfully he was amazed that so many seventeen year old, himself included, were willing to risk their lives for the sake of glory (admittedly it was eternal glory) and a bag of gold (a
“Page 135. Religious tensions in England during the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in the introduction of serious penalties for witchcraft,” Professor Binns droned on, ignoring the grumbling spreading around the classroom as they obediently opened their text books to the required page. “Henry VIII's Act of 1542 was the first to define witchcraft as a felony, a crime punishable by death and the forfeiture of the convicted felon's goods and chattels.”
“Technically I think this is a Scottish castle, rather than an English one,” Harry pointed out, rising from his seat on the bench and shouldering his bag. Pausing he held his hand out to the older boys who rose to stand side by side in front of him, Javier literally towering over him whilst Claude was only a little bit taller than he was. “I suppose I’ll see you around?”
No, not really. Oh, his reasons for entering still stood, but now that the moment was almost upon them he realised that he would be infinitely happier if someone else were selected.
Thierry said not a word, just stood in the corner of the room glaring across at Draco, his fists tightly clenched; his complete and utter jealously as plain as the nose on his handsome face.
“I still don't know how you find the time to read as much as you do,” Ramona admitted, tracing the pattern covering one of the larger books on the top shelf before dropping down onto the bed with enough force to cause her to bounce upon the mattress. “I tried reading those books you recommended over the summer but I…I just couldn't find the time...”
Harry took comfort in the fact that Ron seemed equally as surprised by this knowledge, reassuring him that it wasn't just his muggle upbringing keeping him in the dark this time. Ron was a pureblood, like Fleur only nicer, so it was obviously just a case of Hermione spending far too much time in the library, yet again, rather than him not being told things.
Reclining against the headboard of his ridiculously large bed Draco couldn't help but wonder what he'd done to deserve friends like the ones currently surrounding him. He also couldn't decide whether or not he meant that to be a happy, relieved thought or an exasperate one.
“What’s going on, my dear Javier, is your delightful boyfriend whose flying fists and pointy elbows have been keeping me and Ramona awake has just had the audacity to request that we keep the noise down as he’s trying to sleep!” Draco snapped, still holding the pillow in position to deliver another blow. “Funnily enough that’s what we’d like to be doing too!”
?” a student further along their table grumbled loudly, earning himself a sharp look from the offended
That was what his parents had told him growing up when they would share stories of their past so that he could understand the decisions they had made and learn from their mistakes. Several students spluttered, trying to come up with an answer, but no one spoke.
, given Seamus's unfortunate habit of creating pyrotechnics with even the simplest of spells let alone the complicated ones, was definitely something to be worried about.
“There's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all of the magic schools,” Hermione answered, her voice much gentler now that she was addressing Harry. “Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts to that no one can steal their secrets.”
A boy, aged somewhere between thirteen and fifteen, with piercing green eyes partially hidden behind a rather unattractive pair of wire rimmed spectacles. He was handsome, there was no denying that, although something needed to be done about his messy hair.
had once belonged to Slytherin house although even the simplest bit of research would reveal that that was more of a coincidence than a rule. After all Draco’s own parents were proof that being sorted into Slytherin wasn’t a confirmation of darkness.
A deep sigh escaped him, the parchment fluttering dangerously beneath his hand, before he decided that his only option was to explain things as simply and as quickly as he could.
Draco snorted, waving his wand over the circles of parchment and watching as the rose into the air performing odd little spinning motions as they folded like a circular concertina, creating rigid folds and an almost deadly point. The wider part where the outer edge of the circle had ended up gathered was quickly secured with thin ribbons in their house colours.

together,” Ramona chuckled, stepping back so as to allow her brother and his boyfriend to slip out of the room whilst also assessing the drape she'd just hung. Eventually she nodded, happy with its placement. “I was already sharing with Josephine so that's no problem. She's even let me change the colour of the drapes around her bed to a beautiful jade green which matches those ribbons she always wears in her hair. Unfortunately I'm now also sharing a room with Skye Dreyer who has already taken over the entire dressing table with her hair products and make-up necessities, not to mention covered almost the entire floor with more pairs of shoes than I thought possible. Desiree Morel, our resident
Every single occupant of the room including the three Headteachers standing closest to the Goblet let out a sharp gasp when a burst of flame shot into the air, spitting out a charred piece of parchment which slowly fluttered down until it was at just the right height for Professor Dumbledore to reach out and snatch it out of the air, holding it at arm’s length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had returned to the vivid blue white.

It wasn’t until he was massaging his moisturiser into his pale skin that his thoughts strayed from the actions he was completely purely on autopilot, his mind taking him back to one of the many times that he had his ex-boyfriend, Dieter, had showered together. Dieter had always been amused by how complicated Draco’s shower routine was but had delighted in “helping” him to apply his moisturiser as it had regularly led to something more pleasurable.
Lucius had pointed out, however, that just because he hadn’t murdered anyone didn’t mean that he was innocent; Karkaroff had been a planner, apparently, and had been the one to organise several kidnappings and executions even if others were the ones to do the deed.
with the Hufflepuff's. It wasn't a challenging lesson, Herbology never was as it was 75% practical with only 25% of the course relying on written work and most of that was done during their one theory lesson a week rather than homework, as they spent the hour and a half squeezing yellowish green pus which had a rather pungent smell that reminded Harry of petrol from ‘

Draco was still thinking about what Luna said when she came back and turned off the light with a motion of her wrist. Why Potter would need some cat help ? He had friends, a lot of friends, and even more admirers. And more than that, he had the she-Weasley. He clearly didn’t need any help. He would do it to please Luna. As he was drowsing, he suddenly woke up clearly when his cat ears caught something, a muffle sound. His curiosity tickled, he stretched and jumped down silently, exiting by the door ajar. As he followed the sound, it became clear that it came from the boys dormitory. And it leaded just to Potter’s door. Suddenly, it a loud gasp made Draco jumped. Okay, now he supposed that the raven-hair teenager was awake.
And so, here he was, laying down on his bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about what to say Hermione the next day. But, unsurprisingly, all his thoughts were monopolized by a certain blond that was not that far away from him and it was killing him.
“No !” Parkinson exclaimed. “He won’t disappear without a word ! He won’t…” She whispered her last sentence, fidgeting his fingers on her skirt.
“It’s the first time I have nightmare since it’s the first time I slept in my human form since long.” Malfoy explained before snapping up his head. “ I just should turn into a cat to sleep!”
Potter moved closer and it was too much for Draco, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He was panicking and scared, he didn’t want Potter to hate him anymore but he couldn’t see it otherwise now. He took a deep breath and concentrated, so in the space of a heartbeat, he was a cat again. A form way easier to escape in.
Slowly, very slowly, Harry’s hand came nearer, just under the cat nose, who had stayed still. Seeing that he wasn’t moving, Harry kept going, brushing slowly the furry cheek of Magnolia. Harry couldn’t contain his smile, when the feline closed his eyes, gently nudging against the hand.
Running, keep running, stop thinking, Harry scolded himself. The sun eventually rose up, and as he took a break and conjured some water, he admired the beauty of the landscape, colored from pink to orange. Every morning, he witnessed it, and every morning, he was impressed by the incredibly colors that painted the grass and the sky, it was a different painting every day. He smiled, when suddenly a white flower fall at his feet. Harry picked up, and looked at it, curious, before looking around, wondering where it came from. There were no flowers trees by there, the wind should had bring it to him. But as he studied more carefully, he noticed some grey reflects on the petals, and he couldn’t help but smile. It reminded him a certain blonde guy, and he wondered how he would look with the flower on his hair. His smile dropped, and he threw the flower away, blushed spreading up his neck. He shouldn’t be thinking about him, or about something so... cheeky. Malloy didn’t give any living sign since he testified for his trial, not even a ‘thank you’.
Draco all but purred his name as his brain switched to her native language which he had spent the last six years learning.
Thierry Giles was quiet possibly the quietest person he had ever met, speaking only when there was no other option. He wasn't shy, as such, merely preferred the peacefulness of his own company over the liveliness of others. No, Draco couldn't see him enjoying sharing a room with Claude and Javier but then again he was already sharing with Fabian and Jan who were just as lively as the couple were, so he probably wouldn't be too happy either way.
“Sir, I’m sorry, but it’s Mr Bagman that wants him,” Colin managed to get out, holding out a slip of parchment for the Potions Master to snatch out of his hand. “It’s to do with the Tournament. All the champions have got to go; I think they want to take photographs…”
“Harry, guess what?” Colin gasped loudly, practically vibrating in his seat as he was overcome with excitement. Hermione offered him an indulgent smile, her fondness for the overexcitable founder of Harry's fan club well known. Ron merely grumbled about being cold and hungry. “Guess what, Harry? My brothers starting! My brother Dennis!”
The Ravenclaw’s seemed to be of the opinion his stunt was a cry for more attention whilst the Hufflepuff’s clearly saw it as an attempt to steal their own legitimate champion’s glory.

“What happened?” Lucius demanded, holding onto her chin as she reclined back into his favourite armchair and examining the cuts to her cheek. “Cissa, what happened to you?”
look,” Claude responded with a cheeky grin, leaving the buttons of his jacket undone in favour of running his fingers through his wild hair. Rather than taming it as the action could have done his careless movements only made it worse, one side of his hair sticking up and out whilst the other lay almost flat. “What do you think?”
“There’s no need to aggravate your ribs any more than they already will be simply by travelling via international apparation,” her husband responded calmly as he settled his son on his hip, locking his arm around Draco’s squirming body. “Would you mind carrying the suitcase? It has a feather-light charm on it to counteract the internal expansion charm.”
students at the implication that they were not interesting enough. His friend elbowed him. “I…um…sorry…”
“Because I admire him as an athlete,” Ron protested firmly, his entire face, neck and ears flushing an alarming shade of puce. “Not because I think he's hot or…something…I'm not...”
His studious friend sounded so distraught over the idea of missing out on one of her precious classes that Harry couldn't help but snort, his eyes moving slowly along the varied faces of the faculty members. Most looked anxious, worrying for the new students travelling across the lake, but Snape as per usual wore a mask of indifference tinged with annoyance.
“I wonder if JJ will ask Madame to swap rooms at some point given that it seems a little unfair that of the only two couples attending this tournament he and Fabian had been split up while Javier and Claude are together,” Draco murmured, placing the last of his textbooks on the shelf before moving on to sorting out the rest of his school supplies. His quills were some of the finest money could buy, at his father’s insistence, and were kept in a protective leather roll up case which had his families crest embossed on the outside. It had been his mother who had insisted that he have a personal set of silver inkwells which he could refill as needed, the delicate design of snakes, peacock feathers and roses showing off the quality craftsmanship of the piece. “I can't imagine Jan or Thierry having a problem with swapping.”
was stood with a small group of his own students and Draco noticed as he felt Ramona grab hold of his arm to steady herself as she giggled that they all seemed worried.
“Oui,” Claude confirmed, tracing the outline of the badge with his fingertip. It was roughly two inches wide, about half the size of the crest in fact, and a brilliant purple colour. “It is the emblem of my house, Papillonlisse. You are a Gryffindor, no? That is the name of the house with the red and gold colours, yes? You have a lion for your house emblem, correct?”
just like everyone else had but that didn’t mean he was actually stupid enough to try and do something like this. Seriously, he’d had enough
father told me about it ages ago…heard it from Cornelius Fudge himself. But then, Father’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry…maybe your fathers too junior to know about it, Weasley…yes…they probably don't talk about the important stuff in front of him.”
“It’s been nice speaking to both of you but I need to get going,” he apologised to the foreign students he’d just spent the lunch hour getting to know. “I have to get to the dungeons.”
Offering the mystery boy a quick smile, almost a smirk, Draco turned and proceeded to lead Lara across to the long bench, holding her hand as she took her seat. He then took his own seat, running his fingers through his hair just as Professor Dumbledore called for silence.
“He didn’t seem to approve of Fleur,” she pointed out, thinking back to the confrontation. Harry nodded, agreeing with her statement as he recalled the blonde’s words and actions to his nemesis. “And just because his family history is a little bit...dark…doesn’t mean he is.”
, down to the building where the magical boats were kept safe, back up passed Hagrid’s hut before eventually bringing him to the Quidditch pitch. Once there he walked out onto the grass which felt unusually soft underfoot thanks to the cushioning enchantment which covered the entire pitch to minimise injuries during a fall or a crash, made his way to the centre circle where the two captains were always required to shake hands and lay down on his back with his hands behind his head so that he could watch the colourful morning sky.
And of course the young photographer was excited about that, given that he himself had dreams of becoming a professional photographer once he’d graduated from Hogwarts; he was probably imagining himself in the shoes of the photographer that the

He looked tired; his skin even paler than usual, his eyes circled by a ring of darkness whilst his thick, inky black hair hung limply around his face. It was so desperately in need of a wash that she considered pinning him down and scrubbing his hair clean like she sometimes had to do with Draco who had never been a fan of bath time, not even when he’d been a baby.
The silence continued as Harry walked along the teachers table, none of them saying a word to him, not even Hagrid who was usually so friendly with him, and he disappeared through the door. He found himself not in an antechamber a he’d expected but at the top of a thin winding staircase and so, as the others must have done, he followed it down until he finally reached the bottom and stepped out into what appeared to be the trophy room; there were trophies on every available surface leaving only a couple of spots on the walls available for a few portraits of wizards and witches who looked to be former Headteachers of the school.
He was cute, in an adolescent kind of way, with his jet-black hair which appeared to be completely untameable, his emerald green eyes and his lithe physique. If he were being honest the as yet unidentified boy was pretty much his type personified were it not for his age, easily identified by the classes they’d seen him entering or exiting; three years might not sound like such a big deal but when one of the couple was
She had little time to cry out in shock, pressing a hand to the shockingly painful injury, before her mother grabbed her by her hair and dragged her out into the hallway. With her body bent double, her mother pulling her head downwards as she walked, it was almost impossible for her to navigate the stairs down to the ground floor without tripping and crashed into the wooden bannister more than once. Her father followed a little way behind.
“I came to say goodbye,” she murmured, reaching up with her other hand to tuck her long blonde hair behind her ear. “Lucius and I are leaving the country. We no longer wish to be associated with the darkness of the last few years and have decided to begin anew.”
“Tonight,” she murmured decisively, only looking across towards her brother and his boyfriend once Draco had nodded his head in agreement. “Before we retire for the night.”
Ramona grunted softly in agreement before letting out a deep sigh, slapping her hands against her thighs as she rolled off of the bed in such a way that she could spring to her feet.
As reassuring as his parents words had been it had been his friends that had saved him, none of them afraid to correct him when he was in the wrong or point out when he was letting his “green side” as they referred to his jealousy get the better of him. They'd worked as a team, Claude, Javier and Ramona, to keep him from becoming his own worst enemy.
“Don't talk with your mouth full,” Hermione scolded him automatically, grimacing at the unpleasantly familiar sight before her. “And nobody knows where the school is, obviously.”
“Jan won't care, you're right about that, but Thierry might,” Ramona pointed out as she continued to alter the colours of the walls, ceiling, window drapes, bed drapes and even the door to create a soothing blend of blue, greens, purples and deep reds. It was…perfect, if he was honest, and it amazed him how well his friend could read him. “Jan will be too busy appreciating the female population of
A flash of white-blonde hair prompted Harry to hiss sharply, abandoning his attempt to close the door and leaving it open a crack as he hurried to take the seat beside Hermione.
Odette and Desiree sprung into action, making their way along the centre aisle between long student’s tables in a series of elegant twirls and flourishes. A murmur of surprise spread through the gathered students, most of them obviously over-awed by the display.
Herbology was significantly more tense than usual due to the fact that every single Hufflepuff bar Hannah Abbott, refused to so much as speak to him for the duration.
). As for the remaining candidates they were some of the smartest students in the entire school, consistently achieving exemplary qualifications in their chosen subjects.
, each and every one of them remembering the interesting lessons Hagrid had organised for them the year before. Once again the Gryffindor’s had been paired up with the Slytherin’s for the subject and Fleur surveyed their outdoor classroom area with an expression of disgust which only got worse once they found out exactly what they'd be doing – feeding newborn ‘
A hand grabbed him by his upper arm, squeezing too tightly as he was pulled into the centre of the room which was packed to the rafters with
Breakfast passed quickly once he'd joined his friends, filled with the usual comings and goings of owls and the chatter associated with the first day of a new school year. Neville, who always forgot something, had a large package dropped into his lap by his grandmothers owl which turned out to be his uniform jumpers whilst Fleur received a fashion magazine and some makeup, not because she needed them but because she was a spoilt little bitch.
Narcissa hadn’t been able to attend the wedding but she had managed to visit a couple of months after the baby’s birth without the rest of her family finding out. Nymphadora had been the most adorable thing she had ever seen, wriggling in her multi-coloured blankets, gurgling almost constantly and snuggling against her chest as she held the young infant.
At this point Hermione turned the book so that the boys could see the simple family tree which was printed on a portion of the page which had to be unfolded so as to view it all.

– Please be aware that in some places I will be utilising some of the original material, although it has all been adapted and altered to fit with my changes to the overall storyline. None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.) As the story progresses this will happen less and less but in this first chapter, particularly in the very first section where the “scene is being set”, I struggled not to include some aspects. Just wanted to warn you.
Javier shrugged as best he could under the sudden onslaught of his boyfriend who had obviously grown tired of stretching out in front of the fire and had dropped down onto the bed alongside the trio, landing almost entirely on top of his boyfriend and snuggling his face into his neck with a content sigh. If there was one thing Claude loved to do it was snuggle and all three of them had been reduced to acting as his teddy bear on more than one occasion although since they'd begun dating he targeted his boyfriend almost exclusively.
“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” Moody growled, his voice sending an unpleasant shiver down Draco’s spine; he’d heard all too many tales about the infamous Auror and his methods of catching Death Eaters, or more often than not suspected Death Eaters and his treatment of them. He was on the side of the Light, yes, but he had always operated in the grey area. “But you don’t hear him saying a word, do you? How odd…”
Meeting her son’s tearful gaze Narcissa managed to muster a reassuring smile, wiping away his tears with her thumbs before pressing a gentle kiss to his silky smooth forehead. He truly was her pride and joy, the best of both herself and Lucius in both looks and temperament.

“Professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have travelled a long way,” she responded, smiling approvingly down at the bespectacled wizard. Draco noticed that she was playing up her accent, turning her voice into even more of a purr than usual. “They will need attending to.”

song, to say the least, as it didn’t appear to have a tune as such, each student singing it in whatever way took their fancy creating a jumble of words and notes.
Hermione recited clearly and of all things it was this piece of information which caused him to frown. He didn’t like the idea that there were witches and wizards who would hold someone’s magical status against them when searching for a potential husband or wife.
Don’t ask me where this idea came from. I was literally driving home from work one day and thought to myself, “I wonder what would happen if you swapped Draco and Fleur around” and…well…apparently that was enough for my brain to latch on to and not let go until I started planning and then subsequently writing. I’ve got a rough idea of where this is going to go but I am definitely open to suggestions. Comments also welcome. X
“There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways…their magical prowess…their daring…their powers of deduction…and of course their ability to cope with danger,” Dumbledore’s voice had taken on a deadly serious tone but most students only seemed excited by the prospect of the challenges that were to be set for the champions, particularly regarding the oncoming danger. “As you know, three champions compete in the Tournament, one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will with the

Unbuttoning his blazer he hung it over the back of his chair rather than put it away in his wardrobe and pulled out his silk robes, slipping them on over the top of his shirt and trousers. The robes were fitted to his waist, secured by exactly twenty-eight minuscule buttons covered in the same light blue silk as the robes, where it then flared out to allow ease of movement. As with the girls robes they stopped just past his knees, leaving the bottom of his trousers and his smart black shoes clearly on display, but unlike the girls robes the cuffs of the sleeves weren't quite so tightly fitted. After fixing the layered collars of his robes so that the sharp points hung as they were intended to he smoothed out the mini-cape and carefully transferred his ‘
once more as the Great Hall descended into confused murmurs and then suddenly a fourth piece of parchment was expelled into the air.
Harry had never felt more betrayed in his entire life than he did in that moment, and given his less-than-stellar upbringing that was saying something. His so-called best friend was siding with the rumour mill over him, the boy he’d known since they’d met on the train?
Krum straightened up from his previously hunched position, making his impressive height even more obvious as he blatantly looked Harry up and down, judging him, before smirking and looking away. Cedric looked back and forth between Bagman and Harry, his expression making it clear that he’d assumed that he had misheard something. And Draco looked, if only briefly, truly worried. This expression was quickly covered up with a charming smile.
Draco found himself studying the faces of the many students in that particular table, searching out two in particular, as his mind supplied him with the information his parents had given about their former house; founded by the somewhat infamous wizard Salazar Slytherin the house tended to be composed mostly of Pureblood students, due to its founder's mistrust of Muggleborns, and as such the house was traditionally home to students who exhibit such traits as cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. It was said that most
students had evidently caused there to be slightly more excited chattering than they were all accustomed to. Harry suspected that this might be due to the “unusual” breakfasts which the House Elves had been all too happy to prepare from them; at the Slytherin table the
their clever friend trailed her fingertip down the page until she reached the point where she wanted to read from.
“I hope it’s not always this cold,” Ramona muttered, rubbing her hands together as her eyes glanced across at the grand marble staircase which dominated the layout of the large room.
“10 points from Gryffindor, Mr Potter, Mr Weasley and Miss Granger, for your tardiness,” the notoriously strict Potions Master drawled as they hurriedly took their seats. “Each.”
“Mr Crouch. Mr Bagman,” Professor Karkaroff called out, his voice sharp as a knife. “You are supposed to be our…er…objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?”
“Well, shall we crack on, then?” Bagman suggested brightly, clasping his hands together with anticipation. He was far too excited about the prospect of the deadly
“Then it is a good thing that we speak English,” the Frenchman chuckled, his accent thick but his words clear and easy to understand. He held his hand out to Harry. “Claude Dupont.”
Yes, most potions required shaking to activate the ingredients, but what they were doing was so far beyond what was needed it was unreal. They’d be lucky if they didn’t explode.
“No,” Draco responded, pitching his tone to be reassuring even as he turned to gesture at where Claude was now stretching his arms above his head, his jacket half on. “Claude.”
He couldn't decide if he want Colin's little brother to with the, or not, although that was rather selfish as it would be better for the younger boy to be in the same house as his brother. It would help him settle in and make friends, having someone familiar to go to.
“When arguing a case it is important to present the correct facts,” Claude argued quickly, grabbing hold of her wrist when she tried to flick his ear. “Otherwise it puts the other facts you stated into question which, considering how true they were, would be a problem?”
His fellow champions looked at him in something akin to horror, the idea of un-excusing themselves from the difficult exams abhorrent, whilst Madame Maxine offered him a smile.
“So…going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name?” she'd giggled derisively from the door which had been left open since their friends had joined them. Her stance had been exactly how Harry had pictured it in his mind. “There's money involved as well, you know…you'd be able to afford some decent robes if you won…”
Blowing on the ink to dry the last of it off he folded it, slipped it into a muggle envelope and sealed it by licking the adhesive strip. He couldn’t use Hedwig to send the letter, his owl far too easily recognisable, and she was less than impressed with his decision to use a school owl, clicking her beak furiously at him before disappearing into the rafters high above him.

As he watched a picture of Cedric Diggory’s handsome face appeared in the centre of the badges only to disappear in a swirl of deep red ink which then proceeded to form the words,
“Actually, I can,” she countered primly, setting aside the spoon she had been using to eat her own breakfast of muggle coco-pops and retrieving a heavy tome from her school bag. “It just so happens that I was curious about Fleur’s relatives and decided to check out a book about ‘

In that moment Harry was reminded of a character from a cartoon Dudley had watched once, Harry catching parts of it as he’d completed his chores; when he was angry the

“Ron, that’s just hearsay and…and utter nonsense,” Hermione snapped disapprovingly. “If you’re going to give information to others at least make sure that it is factually correct first.”
The males, it turned out, were the ones with the deadly looking stingers whilst the females had been gifted with ominous looking suckers and both had a nasty habit of shooting sparks out of the tips of their tails every now and then, propelling them forwards a few inches whilst burning whatever was in the vicinity. This, unfortunately, included Dean’s hand.
The house elf disappeared with a tell-tale pop, allowing her to make her way up the first flight of narrow stairs towards the sitting room on the first floor of the tall and thin house. Portraits of her ancestors stared at her as she passed them by, some calling out and demanding her attention but she remained focused on making her way up the staircase.
“You're going to have an interesting year,” Bill responded, his eyes twinkling even as his words filled Harry with dread. Every year thus far had been an
“Only my friend Hermione,” Harry answered, pulling the crusts off of his cheese and ham sandwich before taking a bite out of the softer centre. “But she had to go to the library.”
Ron cleared his through, nodding towards the rest of the class who Harry now realised were completely focused on him. Despite the fact that this was an altogether too familiar experience it didn’t make it any less uncomfortable for the teenage wizard who sat up straighter in his chair, rubbing at the back of his neck with his hand as Trelawney spoke up.
“Who are you with, Javi?” Claude enquired, munching happily on the sweets he'd been thrown having given up on completing his essay. “It better not be Fabian Houtman…”
He found Hermione waiting for him outside Snape’s classroom, facing off against every single Slytherin in their year, each of whom appeared to be wearing a large yellow badge.
students, Odette and Yvette. He doubted very much that they had been studying as Draco and his friends had been, that wasn’t really their style. Oh, they were bright enough pupils and would graduate in the top third of their class but they wouldn’t put an ounce more effort into their education than was absolutely necessary. For them the real challenge was in their search for a suitable husband.
“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well that you did not make a mistake!” McGonagall snapped, her hands coming to rest gently on Harry’s trembling shoulders. It was comforting, to know that she would stand by him always. “Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!”
“And don't worry mate, well keep this between us until you want to tell everyone,” Ron murmured reassuringly as they reached the classroom, groaning when he saw what was written upon the chalkboard in cursive writing. “Ugh. Not the
He had been captivated by the Ravenclaw Seeker, the only girl on their team, since the first match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw the year before. Just seeing her pretty face and stunning smile made his stomach feel funny, like there was a giant butterfly trapped inside it. The thought of seeing her again had been one of the things get him through his time with the Dursley's before he had been spirited away to attend the World Cup with the Weasley's.
Potter sighed heavily and sat down on his bottom. He reached Draco face with his hand and made him look up to meet his green eyes, without any glasses to hided them. Draco gulped, ready for anything coming, maybe Potter wanted Draco to see the disgust in his eyes.
Harry tried to wake him up before what he guessed was an awful nightmare. He put one of his hands on his shoulder, framing him with his right arm then and shook him slightly, his other hand still brushing his hair.
Of course it would Potter, Draco sulked, his head laying on his pawns and his tail waving in the here. Saint Potter, the Savior, the Greatest. What is he doing there anyway ? Isn’t he supposed to enter directly the Auror training ?
“Please, I’m serious.” Draco was pleading and Harry stopped because he absolutely never heard Draco pleaded, not to him at least.
Magnolia hissed in annoyance, Harry couldn’t believe he could see that, and gave McGonagall a tiny paw kick, as if it was her fault for his name. She shushed him away, but Magnolia didn’t move, and just hit the floor angrily with his fully tail.
“Oh shut up Malfoy, you were having a nightmare, and even, there is no way you can be a burden.” Harry said back, shrugging.
Thus, he gestured Malfoy to the bed, then he went around and lay down next to the slytherin. The other young man was a bit stiff, laying on his back, his eyes closed.
gave it to him. However, he didn’t want to risk coming across Potter, so he just ate there, and watched the little creatures bustling and working.
just didn’t want any of you ?” Hermione couldn’t help to ask back with a cold smile, not kinda forgetting her bitterness against the slytherin girl.
He had died, and a part of him never came back. Even with Voldemort dead, the nightmares never stopped, he couldn’t never stop this anxiety running through his veins and catching his heart. He felt so different comparing to a year before, and not only in his head. In few weeks, he gained about fifteen centimeters, and was always hungry. To avoid thinking too much, and to have something to keep him busy before September, he started a real hard muscular training, starting with a run at six o’clock every morning. It helped him, because the time he spent running, hitting, squatting, pushing and lifting, he didn’t spend it at thinking about what’s coming next, at his loneliness without his two best friends, at the people who died because of him, at Dr- Malfoy who didn’t even say thank you for saying something at his trial.
Malfoy jumped on the side and sat down, staring at Harry and the latter was sure that git was smiling.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t trust his voice at the moment, so he just nodded, but before he turned back to enter his new room, he decided to be bold. He stood up in his tiptoes and let a kiss on the corner of Harry’s mouth. Then, without waiting his reaction, he got into his room.
“No, don’t move. It’s okay. I hope you won’t mind however, because I’ve got no silk here.” Harry added with a smile.
“It’s not like I miss him or whatever, but he didn’t even send me a word after the trial, not a thank you.” Harry mumbled.
The map opened itself and the ink appeared, drawing the plan of the castle with every soul, living or dead, living there. Feverishly, he looked for his room, and his heart stopped when he found it. There was effectively a tag with his own name, next to the bed, but on the bed,
Draco turned his head, to show that no, he is not. But Luna understand this gesture as an invitation to pet him. Draco wanted to stop her but he couldn’t come to terms with hurting her, so he just let her do.
Draco tried to run, ashamed to be caught, even more that Potter seemed annoyed. However, surprisingly, Potter squatted down and started to scratch Draco between his cat ears.
And he felt suddenly hungry, as quietly as a cat, and unnoticed, Draco left the Astronomy tower, and walked down to the kitchens. After stealing some food that was actually left for him, he went on the stairs outside, just in front of the big door of the Castle. It was his favorite spot, warming by the sun. Although, as the term just began, there were a lot more of students, coming and leaving the castle, and soon enough, he found himself coming back to the tower. There, nobody would disturbed him.
Eventually, Draco supposed his fell asleep, because the sound of walking woke him up. Opening a eye, he caught an orange fluffy tail, and a pair of feminine legs.
Draco Malfoy was sleeping on the couch of the eighth common room. Well, sleeping was a big word, he was drowsing, his mind repeating what had happened the evening. The fact that his own friends didn’t spare him a look, even if they couldn’t have a single idea that Magnolia was in fact him, Draco, and that the only one among the bunch of students whom could be a bit nice to a poor cat was Potter.
So, obviously, Draco was tired, so much tired, that this day, a bit after noon, when he had to cast a rebuilt spell, he missed a wicked curse, which hit him directly. Draco could only thought that it was funnily ironic before slipping in unconscious. He woke up after two days, Mrs Pomfrey had told him, trapped in his animagus form. And nobody could say how much he would have to wait before he could turn into himself again. It was two weeks before the return of the students.
Malfoy didn’t move, and seemed to think about it, looking into Harry’s eyes with those big grey smart eyes. Yes, definitely, it was Malfoy’s eyes, Harry wondered how he could have ever doubt about it.
“Anyway, as I said, there is your new common room.” McGonagall resumed after giving a look to the cat at her feet. “As you are not many this year, you all will have a single room, already defined. You will found your timetable on your desk. I hope you’ll see this cohabitation a way to pass over old animosity. Thereupon, I’m leaving you settle down.”
After all, he didn’t want to search for a new place, and he kinda appreciated the Atronomy Tower, and maybe also because McGonagall asked him to not wandered too much in the castle. So, when the evening came, and the students too, he tried his best to avoid Potter, but when the said boy squatted next to the fireplace where Draco was “hiding”, and opened his arms, the resolution flattered in a second and jumped into his arms.
It was night about the end of August, as they were almost finishing the cleaning all the lingering curses from the battle, Draco couldn’t sleep. A vivid nightmare woke him up, a terrible mix of what happened and what could have happened, of the reason that made him start to learn how to be an animagus and what could have happened if he didn’t. And the rest of the night, he just stared at the ceiling, switching between human being and cat, trying to calm down and convincing himself that he was safe, well safer than possible.
He chuckled when Malfoy mewled indignantly, and was turning away, already heading to the end of the bed as Harry had just reach the headboard. He grabbed him just in time before he was out of reach and put his on his chest.
The eighth years, however, didn’t asked about why Harry was talking with the two slytherins so friendly because immediately, Parkinson dropped the bomb.
If Harry was totally honest, which he wasn’t at this precise moment, he would admit that Malfoy, and how weak he looked, along with the urge of protecting him Harry felt during this trial was a bit a part for his non-relationship with Ginny. Not that he wanted to have anything to do with the slytherin. He helped them at the manor by pretending to not recognize them, and his mother literally lied to Voldemort for him. It was just a fair act, but he was still annoyed by the silence. He couldn’t help but being annoyed. Maybe Malfoy was still mad because Harry kept his wand ? But Harry wasn’t even sure he could give it back to him, as he disarmed the blonde teenager for it, there was no proof that his wand would even work. Well, that was what Hermione explained in one of his letter, when Harry complained for about the ninth time about Malfoy.
Harry hummed. He knew very well how it was having that bad nightmares. He grabbed Malfoy delicate shoulder and lead him slowly to the bed. Malfoy let him do, and when they agreeing to the bed, Harry made him sit down on it.
Draco was about to meow when Potter raised his neck and kissed his wet nose. Draco yelped, and tried to move back, but he quickly gave up, Potter was too sodding strong !
Draco turned around abruptly, letting go Potter’s neck but the lastest didn’t put away his own hands. The slytherin prince felt himself blushing with shame and tried to open his mouth to defend himself, but Luna talked before him.
But it was easier to talk to a cat than to a human, even if knowing that it was Malfoy underneath all this fur.
“I’m just curious of what Malfoy is doing his freedom, thanks to me.” He added, crossing his arms on his chest.
Harry couldn’t stand it, he had to know. He had to know now. Slowly, as slowly as he could, he stopped petting the cat and get up. He took his wand on his nightstand. Silently, he went to his truck and opened it. He stopped, his heart beating like crazy, when it squeaked. For a couple of minutes, he stayed still, waiting for any sound of the cat, Magnolia or Malfoy, waking up. But nothing. As soon as he was sure, he kept looking into the truck. When he found what he was looking for, he leaned forward. Silently, he cast a lumos.
As time went by, Harry started to believe from the deep of his heart that Magnolia wasn’t just a cat. Besides that his fur was the same color of Malfoy’s hair and his eyes the same shade of grey, Magnolia always acted quite self-consciously. He absolutely never ever give him a look when he get undressed, and stared obstinately at the wall. Even if now the white cat slept near him, close to his head or chest, he always tried to ignore him when there were others around, like he couldn’t show affection to Harry when they were not alone. He was a picky cat whenever it was related to food. And he never answered when Harry called his name, more than that, he even tried to scratch him.
The first surprise that welcomed the 8th year students was a common dormitory for all of them. Harry didn’t expect them to be a lot, but they were no more than ten, and a big part were Gryffindor. In fact, the only other houses’ students were Luna, Hannah Abbot, and Parkinson and Zabini. Professor McGonagall, well now Headmistress McGonagall, leaded them through the castle, reminding them that even if they had a bit more freedom because of their age, they still couldn’t wander in the corridor during night, and Harry could swear she was specifically looking at him.
Harry decided that he was eventually thinking too much again, and stood up. He changed to some sport outfit - which was in fact, just pulling in a short - and got out of the house, going down the stair with the less noise he could. He kept his wand on him, of course, a year of being on guard 24/7 let some habits. It was still dark outside, but the sky was getting a bit lighter by the East, finally it wasn’t that early, maybe around 5 am.
Draco was whining pitifully scratching the carpet in frustration when suddenly, he felt being lifted and turned around, facing beautiful green eyes and a big smile.
“Thank you.” Malfoy said as he stood up as well. “Can you turn around ? It’s the bare minimum privacy.”
Suddenly, two soft knocks at his door made him sat up straight. It was so soft however, that for a moment, he thought he had just dreamed it. But when the knock happened again, he stood up, grabbed his glasses on the nightstand and went directly to the door. As he opened the door, he faced Malfoy, who was still dressed up, but his hair was in disheveled, like if he has just slept like that. However, what made Harry worried, was how Malfoy looked pale.
Malfoy stopped as he was cursing in a low voice, fighting against his buttons shirt according to the sound he could hear.
Eventually, Malfoy closed his eyes and put his fluffy head between his paws, slowly starting to purr.
“I.. I don’t want to describe it.” Malfoy shook his head, still not rising his head. “ It was awful enough the first time I endured it, it’s even harder to relive it again, and again, and…” Malfoy broke into a sob.
“Anyway Magnolia, I have to go or Hermione is going to lecture me again, like in good old days. You would believe that it would change but no. It’s good to know that some things never change. Right, I’m releasing you kitty.”
“Yes yes, let’s go.” Potter smiled and, after being sure that the cat in his arms was comfortable, he went out of his bedroom.
“And as he was working on a pretty tricky hex, he got hit. Hopefully, the professionals were close so they cleaned the curse before it got too much dangerous. However, his body answered at the offensive by turning into his animagus form.”
It was during the last activity that the eighth students came back. Well, it was Potter, Longbottom, and Luna. Potter went directly to him and sat down, after picking him up and laying him down on his knees. Longbottom kept talking with Potter like it was bloody common for Potter to pick up cats and petting them, and sat down on the armchair. Luna sat next to Potter and him, smiling directly at Draco. The lastest was trying to escape the raven-haired hands, but this man was goddam strong.
But it was like Potter understood just the opposite, as he started to pet his head, and his neck, brushing him with his fingers, soon Draco found himself purring, low almost inaudible.
“Er- yeah, well, I knew that you were Magnolia.” Potter answered, looking ostensibly away, flustered. “ I discovered it like two days ago.”
Eventually after a couple of minutes, Malfoy seemed to calm down, stopping trembling, and releasing the front of Harry pajamas. Harry wondered if he would just go back to a more peaceful sleep, it instead, he saw Malfoy’s eyes slowly opened, shiny like if he had just cried. All of a sudden, he jumped away, blushing hard and trying to put his pajamas right, as it had slipped over his shoulder again.
“ And why you would you care ? You changed you mind ? Want him in Azkaban eventually ?” Parkinson glared at him.
Shut up, that’s not funny ! Draco grumbled in his head, but he hissed in real life. Potter just laughed with Pansy and Blaise, which was a odd scene, and he left the common room. The walk toward the headmistress office was plunged into silence.
Flustered, Draco scratched under his ear, a bit like when he was a cat, looking with the corner of his eyes to Potter. However, this small gesture didn’t get unnoticed. A knowing smile appeared on Pansy flat face.
Malfoy rolled his eyes but didn’t move, so Harry stood up and went to his trunk, searching for an extra pajamas. He found the marauders’ map, but just hided it under more socks until he found what he was look for.
Harry was staring at the ceiling, listening at the sound of the night, while the silence reigned inside the Burrow. It was the middle of a particularly heated night, and Harry could feel his sweat rolling down his back. He scrunched his nose and turned his head, looking at the empty bed on the opposite side of the room. He was really grateful that Mr and Mrs Weasley let him live with them during the summer, even if Ron went with Hermione in Australia to find her parents, leaving him almost alone with Ginny most of the time.
Potter snickered next to him and Draco refrained to sigh loudly and punch Potter shoulders. Instead, he greeted professor McGonagall and left, following by the gryffindor. For the biggest relief of Draco, the corridors were empty, he was resisting to turn into a cat again, the professor being clear that she wanted Draco to be a usual student again, as usual as possible.
“I’m glad everything is settle, I’m going to ask the house elves to prepare your room Mr. Malfoy, it shouldn’t be long. You could wait in the common room, I’m certain some students would be happy to see you.”
Draco remembered his first day, always surrounded by a least two powerful wizards. Not as powerful as Potter though,Draco couldn’t help but think, before focusing again on his task.
“Oh sorry, I didn’t want to make you worried, er, Kitty.” Harry said as he joined the bed, cringing at the use of his last word.
On those words, Draco jumped on his paws and slipped through Potter’s hands. And went up to the girls dormitory, the farest he could from Potter and his wandering hands. He went straight to Luna’s room, he could recognize it by her perfume, sneaked through the door and went to the armchair, next the fireplace. Contentedly, he curled up and started his grooming.
The third morning after that event, Draco was getting a bit more comfortable around Potter. Maybe sleeping in the same bed was helping a bit, that and the fact Potter was petting and caressing Draco, well Magnolia for him, each time he had the opportunity.
Malfoy lay down next to him and put his fluffy head on his chest, looking at him with one eye. He was staring at him, like waiting for more. Harry gulped, he had no idea what he was doing, but he wanted to let know Malfoy that he would be always safe around him.
“Why ? Is there any problem with the cat Magnolia ? Is he unbearable?” She asked, walking past him and stopping just before the gargoyle in stone.
As he started running, he tried to not think of Hogwarts, the place he would call home the most, a place he was going back at the end of the summer. Yes, because even if the Ministry offered him on a place at the Aurors training directly, Harry hesitated. He didn’t know if he really wanted to be an Auror after all. He was already the savior, too much attention was on him, the newspapers staying out of his way only because he was at the Burrow and barely leaving it. Being an Auror meant always being on the first page, and he couldn’t stop thinking that he would always wondered if people indulged him because he is the Savior or because he actually did a good work. Eventually, he decided, along with some others students, to go back to Hogwarts and to do his seventh year again. Sadly, he wasn’t sure Hermione and Ron would be able to join him, Ron expressing his wish to join the Ministry right away, like many other of their year students who were not too kind to go back to castle after all the traumatic events they assisted. Hermione, on the other side, was more into coming back and passed the N.E.W.Ts with her usually top grades. But if his two best friends were not there, Harry would felt alone, he already missed them so much. He already felt alone.
Draco wanted to stay and observe this Death Eater's actions, but he didn't want to arouse more suspicion. He would come back to stop this Death Eater, but he couldn't do it

Longbottom wouldn't be satisfied with casting a bloody Incarcerous like a normal wizard. Draco could feel himself condescendingly rolling his eyes as he struggled against the plant. When the vines began constricting around him, he could feel his breath being squeezed from his lungs. "Your side," Draco coughed as the vine tightened painfully around his ribs. "I'm on your side."
Draco assumed that they were discussing the case of Ginny Weasley's death, but also didn't want to pry or make it seem like he was trying to stir up bad memories when they weren't offered willingly. This

They parted and soon Draco was following his own advice, running down the stairs and across the stones of the keep, nearly slipping on them. The sky was spitting something between rain and ice, and it bit sharply against Draco’s cheeks as he ran. When he crossed the drawbridge, he could see the dementor in the distance. It was closing in on Potter. Potter
When he emerged, Potter had turned more lights on, which was helping Draco feel a little more awake. Now, at least, he could clearly see that Potter was already showered and dressed in a pale green button-up shirt with a dark green tie draped loosely untied around his neck. A very familiar pale green button-up and dark green tie.
, clearly. Potter had the frightening ability to do that to him. Potter’s brainlessness was a contagion upon all humankind. A door slammed, and Potter let his head fall back down against the mattress by Draco’s neck and cleared his throat.
Draco sighed with relief. Oh thank Merlin. Thank Merlin, and Morgana, and Salazar’s big sweaty bollocks. “The truth, I guess.” Draco could practically feel his eyes going all mushy and sparkly as they looked into Potter’s eyes. He felt his hand tightening around Potter’s wrist. “I took the second potion, but I’m fine, and I really, really,
In the treasure chest containing Hannu’s jewels for the afterlife, there had also been a vial of the Fountain of Youth. An actual, surviving vial.
Harry stood in the doorway looking down at him, gripping the door frame so hard his knuckles were paling. He looked
The wands flew from both Death Eaters’ hands as Draco and James cast their spells simultaneously. Draco cast some additional binding and disillusionment spells to nullify the Death Eaters until the Aurors could arrive. “Nice work, James. Have you seen your dad?”
“I can still work with the Ministry from afar. I can even make the occasional appearance. Maybe I’ll bring my very famous date,” Draco nudged Harry. “We’ll be the talk of the country.”
. They had only been worn once, and they were still practically new. Inspired by the Victorian riding style, they looked sleek, stylish, and masculine.
Draco swallowed and reached for the door handle. He hesitated. Took a breath. He pushed the door open ever so slightly. He poked his head into the bathroom. There was a large mirror over a beautiful white sink. The shower happened to be in a large white jacuzzi tub; Draco could just make out the details through the small gap not hidden by the shower curtain. ...The shower curtain that undoubtedly concealed a very naked Harry Potter. Draco swallowed nervously. “Are you going to be long?” he mumbled as if something had suddenly gotten stuck in his throat.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter dive and then Draco was diving too, catching up, diving right beside him, and then behind the stands. They were neck and neck, both reaching forward, shoulders pressed tightly together.
“That’s just brilliant, Potter,” Draco said, gesturing toward the fleeing student and glaring. “Do you have any idea what you just did? Of course not, you complete and utter--” Draco roared in frustration, not even bothering to look at Potter again as he marched toward his quarters to wash up for tea.
“You may have… a point. About us. That I hadn’t previously considered. I’m willing to try...to make an
have some misguided ideals about those sorts of things. Just look at us now, getting along! You aren't nearly so repulsive as I once believed you to be! How delightful!” Healer Victoria’s eyes had gone wide and watery. She was standing on her feet, looking pained.
“I’ve never--” Harry murmured as he licked his way toward Draco's other nipple. “Could you--” Harry stammered again and Draco smiled. Finally he
“You four,” Draco pointed at four Death Eaters on the left. “Capture the Minister of Magic. You should find her hiding down that hallway.” Draco honestly had no idea if there were even any
from the inside? He looked toward the window. Even though it was late April and flowers had already begun to bloom, it was snowing outside. Feathery swirls of frost were forming against the glass. It looked cold, and comfortable, and familiarly Malfoyan. “I’m leaving, Potter.”
“Well...er...yes, but I...um…” Draco had been leaning back in his chair far enough to see that Harry’s knees began banging together uneasily beneath the table. Harry's feet were squirming back and forth as he nervously ran his palms up and down his thighs. He was clearly uncomfortbale, and had no desire to talk about the Elder Wand.
Harry shook his head defeatedly, staring uncertainly up at the dementors and looking completely overwhelmed.
Fine. If Potter was going to ignore it, then so was he. Draco began to walk to his potions desk, but Potter got there first.
Draco nodded. He still remembered the castle as clearly as if he had only left it yesterday. When he stepped inside the Potions classroom, Draco inhaled and was instantly filled with nostalgia. It was a smell he didn’t even realize he had missed--half-burned potions and misfired spells, layered with that distinctly unique Hogwarts scent of pumpkin spice and woodsmoke against cool stone.
“Yes. Bring me my research journal, won’t you?” Draco closed his eyes. He hated this. He hated that Potter was being so…
wasn’t ready to stop running and face Potter. “Ugh,” he groaned into his hands. “Pull yourself together, Malfoy.” Draco stood, washed his face in the sink, and then dabbed himself dry with a towel. Even the towels were green and delightfully soft. He looked up to find himself staring into a gold-framed mirror. He lifted his sharp chin from side to side as he studied the edges of his face--the masculine lines of his nose and jaw, the smooth hair held at the nape of his neck with green ribbon--making sure nothing looked out of place. “Be professional. This is business.” Just business, his mind repeated. “Right,” he muttered, a little disturbed that it sounded more like a question than a statement.
Because he very frequently found himself focusing on the memory of Harry Potter in his bed. The feeling of Potter’s hot breath against his neck. Against his
Granger stayed with Draco for a few more hours, until she was certain that he had stabilized. Once he was actually capable of speaking, he reviewed his exact symptoms with her. They concluded that it was probably some kind of fossilization or mummification potion, probably used as a preservation spray and not intended for human consumption. Granger completed Draco's research notes before she left, giving him explicit instructions to wake her in case of an emergency.
should be the one to flirt with Potter at the pub. In public. Where people could see. Still, he was suddenly nervous and excited all at once.
“Professor Malfoy,” Granger was saying, and he forced himself to pay attention, “has been doing some very brave and brilliant potions work, as you may have seen in the parchment I posted this week. He needs an assistant, however, before he can be allowed to continue. Kindly, Healer Ruby Victoria has volunteered. Thank you, Healer Victoria.”
Harry pressed two fingers between Draco's lips and Draco moaned, sucking them deeper into his mouth, running his tongue along the callused pads of Harry's fingertips. Harry trailed his wet fingers back down past Draco’s cock, over his bollocks, not stopping until they were pressed tightly against Draco’s puckered opening. He slid one finger gently into that tight heat and began to move in small, teasing circles. "Harry," Draco groaned again.
“Who am I fooling ?” Harry let his hand softly covering the cat’s back. “Of course I missed him.” He admitted, blushing slightly in the dark. “I wouldn’t imagine it, but after not seeing him for a year, barely meeting him those two times wasn’t enough, I thought more about him than about Ginny ! Er-“ Harry felt embarrassed.
jumped down, before going to the armchair of the room and curling up. Harry grabbed his clothes, but this morning, before getting dressed, he made sure that Malfoy wasn’t looking at him. But the Slytherin was a polite git, or a prude one maybe, and he was obviously looking at the back of the armchair. Harry smiled and started to get dressed.
Draco weighted the pros and cons, hesitating. Potter must have feel it, because he entered slowly the room, and let the door ajar. He got around the white cat and sat on his bed, letting the way clear between Draco and the exit. After some minutes of silent where Draco didn’t move, he eventually sat down, and Potter let out a relief sigh.
To be honest, Harry was surprised with the sudden boldness of the request, but he couldn’t more glad.
Well, Potter wasn’t very good at showing disgust and disdain. In lieu, all Draco could see was worried eyes, and maybe
Midnight had passed since a long time now but Harry was unable to fall asleep. And this was maybe or maybe not because Malfoy wasn’t with him tonight. He stayed in the common room with Parkinson and Zabini until the rest of the eighth years arrived. They were all surprised, especially Hermione, to witness all the three discussing in an almost good mood. Well, all this time Pansy was trying to make him speak, dropping some hints but Harry didn’t let any secrets out, and he was kinda proud of him.
“We don’t know exactly why, but Mrs Pomffrey supposed it is because of the shock. He isn’t hurt, so maybe the moment he will feel safe enough, unconsciously, he would be able to turn back human. But as I heard, you take care of that.” She added, the corner of her smile twitched up.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea, you need to be able to sleep as a human, it will make you rest way better.”
So he was right. He was fucking right. But it couldn’t be right ? How ? Why ? Too much questions, and not a single answer popped. All he was sure about now was that it was Draco fucking Malfoy sleeping on his bed, under a white cat form. Thinking about something, and being sure of that same thing was two very different … thing.
Clear yesterday ? Draco thought. What Potter was talking about ? All he said that he was missing him and that he was sorry, nothing was clear at all. Wait… was he saying that he knew before that he was a cat ? On instinct, he turned out into human and crossed his arms.
Surprised, Draco felt his cheeks got hotter. They stayed for few seconds, staring at each other dead in the eyes, holding their breath like if just doing this simple thing would break the sudden heavy atmosphere. But something else broke it. They heard steps outside the room and Potter just closed the door hastily with a motion of the wrist, hence dropping Draco hands, and suddenly, Draco felt cold.
He was trying so hard to not lose control to his anger, to won’t help Malfoy. But just thinking of it he wished he was the one that killed Greyback from his bare hands. Instead, he managed put this aside.
What should he do now ? No really, good job Harry… How could he just go to bed and pretend to not know ? He couldn’t call him Magnolia anymore, nor Malfoy ! He was certain this idiot would panic and hide forever, and he surprised himself by not wanting this option.
