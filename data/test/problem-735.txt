And so it had, at last, occurred to him that he had been holding onto something that was keeping him isolated and was contributing to his unhappiness.
he likes you.”
right about the consequences, well. At this rate, Harry was practically speeding towards the Janus Thickey Ward anyway. He had everything to lose, regardless of what he did next.
Blaise stood, lifted his shirt a bit and pulled out a bit of his briefs, showing everyone the colour. Neville, after a moment, did the same. They both left the room shortly after. Not two minutes later, they strolled back in, Blaise flashing a bit of Neville’s briefs as proof of the switch. “They’re a bit tight, but they’ll do,” he said as he sat, smirking.
He went to give Ayesha a hug, too.
But then Harry, seemingly oblivious, smiled at him, and something in Draco relaxed.
Snape sneered at him, and Draco was filled with sudden regret for every time he'd ever sneered at someone himself.
He would not walk off this floor, accepting his losses, to go privately lick his wounds and hope that tomorrow they could act like it hadn’t happened.
"But... You really, er, care about him, yeah?"
had written about them. Though, perhaps it was true he should read the whole article first before he assessed his emotions. He picked up the paper without answering.
“Actually, I–” he started, then stopped, suddenly feeling awkward and shy. He turned out not to need to say much else, though, because her eyes had finally strayed to the rucksack hanging off his shoulder.
There was absolutely no hope of Draco holding back the following laugh. “Do you want a thank you or something?”
Well sod it, he decided viciously, his heart still galloping in his chest. Sod Lavender’s theories, and sod bloody Dumbledore.
“It’s not enough,” said Harry.
I can tell.”
(See the end of the chapter for
This time Harry stopped.
She winked, and Harry grinned. “Of course,” he said. “But now you’re set to go?”
"I didn't think you really—"
And damn if it didn't still amaze Harry that Draco Malfoy could sound that concerned over
"Are you not still living with choices
"You saved 'er. Even though she was not your 'ostage."
Many of his material possessions had been shrunk down and tossed into it, in fact.
There were no words for this, Draco decided. He had actually kissed Harry Potter; he must have been certifiable to do so but he had. In public, no less. And Harry was kissing him back. Had Harry kissed anyone before? Draco knew it was ridiculous—not to mention selfish—of him to hope the answer was no, but he did anyway.
It was all too tied up in Harim and everything else, somehow; Harry never quite knew what to feel or what was acceptable to feel, really.
"Tell you what," Cedric said, "use the prefects bathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the Fifth floor. Password's 'pine fresh.' I have to go." And with that, Cedric walked off.
Hermione rolled her eyes then. "No Ron. Harry knows what he's doing, perhaps for the first time in his life. Once I figured it out, everything fell into place. You can't honestly tell me you don't see it."
And looking at Draco, he still felt love. Not thoughtless, not maddening, but soft. Though still plenty strong enough that his double vision brought a haunting sadness he had no words to properly describe.
Reid hadn’t done much. Her examinations of his mind had thus far been conducted with clinical professionalism, and they hadn't been invasive on a personal level. The Unspeakables had proven that they didn’t much care for Harry’s life and experiences beyond the necessity for relative data acquisition. In fact, when Reid had stumbled upon something of purely sentimental value, she had avoided it.
There were no similarities here, he told himself as he fiercely pushed the image from his thoughts and locked it away.
Snape had glared at his godson, but walked away none the less.
"Do you ever get tired of your own voice?" Malfoy demanded once he had faced her again. "Could I possibly get through a single sentence, Granger?"
“You’re a bit mad to of come here, though,” Harry pointed out worryingly. “You could be caught.”
The Slytherin opened his mouth, but Weasley beat him to it. “He got a letter from his mum.”
Harry stared. Red started creeping at the edge of his vision as he slowly took in Malfoy’s meaning. The blond didn’t actually know that the other Taken weren’t all muggleborns, he realised. Of course he’d be pleased. Merlin, how could Harry have forgotten who this boy was, even for a day? Anger flared hot in his chest.
And so he knew that this moment, this devastation, could not be allowed to go to waste.
"Not likely," Hermione said almost automatically.
“Then you have your answer right there, seems like,” Harry said.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He still hadn’t quite got the hang of apologising for things he hadn’t even done. When he failed to say anything, as was becoming the usual, she went on. “Look. I get on your case, yeah. But that doesn’t mean I don’t
He sat on his own bed, staring at Malfoy’s closed curtains again and wondering desperately if he’d really just done the right thing. If it was going to have any effect at all.
"Some. It's a riddle, I've got to solve it I guess. But that’s not really what we need to talk about."
“Pardon?”
"Your turn then," she said, secretly gleeful she'd gotten through her turn with minimal tension.
Harry was in a state of shock as Malfoy placed his hands about Harry's waist. It was all Harry could do to let Malfoy lead, since he'd never been completely successful at dancing. He'd been absolutely atrocious with Parvati just an hour ago, he knew, but now he was dancing with Draco Malfoy. It was probably only due to Malfoy's skill that Harry hadn't yet fallen, and they were hardly moving as it was.
"It's fine," he assured her, still avoiding her eyes.
Draco simply nodded mutely. He had no way of knowing personally what sorts of things were expected of senior Aurors in the field, so he couldn’t argue no matter how stupid he thought it sounded. They’d just been illegally transported from Hogwarts grounds to a graveyard in the middle of nowhere and that wasn’t crime enough?
Draco raised an eyebrow, waiting.
He couldn’t risk them using this as an excuse to leave him behind, not when he’d went through so much just to be allowed there. More Aurors had joined Timothy when Harry had went down, and he hurried to explain what must have happened. Thankfully, they all took him seriously.
"Do I get to be filled in?" Hermione asked Harry, if only to break the silence.
For all Harim’s efforts—and perhaps Harry’s own efforts—emotion was the one factor that could not be entirely smothered. Even when everything else seemed to separate adequately, Harim’s emotions bled through. They always had, from the very second Harry’d woken up in this world where Draco Malfoy was the love of his life.
He didn’t like it, but it was better than not being there at all.
Harry, Dumbledore and the Auror force had set up an entire plan to draw out the monster and prevent his attack when he hadn’t even yet been capable of attacking! And then, given the chance to stop his return, they hadn’t. They’d hidden behind gravestones and let the world’s greatest evil be reborn. Why the hell weren’t they doing anything? Where the bloody hell was back up? If they all hadn’t of grabbed that portkey at once, some or all of them would have died by now!
Lucius's wand raised a fraction, and then Severus was between the two Malfoys.
Harry barked a laugh, unable to stop it. “It’s okay,” he promised. His smile faded a bit, but he forced the next words out without the hitch that threatened. “I forgive you.”
“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone. His eyes flickered past Harry and landed on Draco where he still stood near the cave entrance. “I thought you might bring him along.”
Harry suppressed a shiver at hearing Harim’s voice again, and ignored it as best he could.
He desperately wanted his life to be as easily fixable as Neville’s. A series of steps to take—people to talk to, press to manipulate, and potentially lawyers to contact. And then, for Neville, everything would be alright.
was this entire time, but that
“Er–”
Hermione shrugged. "Dare I suppose."
It was not a large party that awaited him, either, thankfully. In fact, there were only the five of them.
“No, Professor Snape sir please. I can f-fix this!” she begged loudly.
“Oh, hi Harry.”
“Quidditch?” asked Harry, heart quickening despite himself. He hadn’t been certain that they even played Quidditch here, and was exhilarated at the thought of flying again.
“We need to talk,” Draco said.
"No professor," said Draco, but he was distracted through the rest of class.
"Truth, I guess."
Hermione only waited patiently for him to continue.
"Not really a trio anymore," Hermione pointed out as Lavender Brown made her way to Ron’s arm. She turned back to Harry. "Speaking of, where
At that, Draco sat up on his bed. Harry was here? As in,
“It... none of that matters now. I forgive you, you’ve been through enough,” he said. “We both have, yeah?”
"When did you know you were bent?"
Anywho, this chapter goes out, in small part, to commenter allalrightagain: I’m sorry I had to fib a bit back when, even if it was only by omission. I’m of the mind that all will be forgiven in just a minute lol.
In the present, Harry was newly certain that Sheila had been right, because the presence almost constantly in his mind was so suddenly and thoroughly absent that Harry could barely feel a wisp of him. Harry was, in that moment, no one but himself.
Sheila had looked satisfied. “Just as you struggle with the disparity between your own feelings and Harim’s, it is likely the same on his end. He loves Draco deeply —perhaps
, he thought silently. “I think my mum'll be fine with it."
“What makes us gods?” asked Harry, honing in on his opportunity.
a god?”
"I need an escort?" Harry inquired politely.
“That is why I’m inclined to be lenient with you,” Fontaine continued. “You will clean cauldrons for Professor Danes every night this week, and you will
Brilliant green eyes fluttered open and a lazy smile appeared. “‘Time is it?”
Hermione rolled her eyes. She recalled quite well the day Draco and Harry had come through her fireplace and announced that they’d just tied the knot. She was still holding a, admittedly very minor, grudge that she hadn’t been there to see it. They hadn’t had much choice, after all, what with the way they were constantly hounded by Skeeter and the rest of the media in those days.
Harry swam immediately toward them, mildly surprised no merpeople went to attack him. The ropes tying the hostages were very thick and strong, and Harry wished momentarily for the knife Sirius had sent to him for Christmas, but wishing now was useless and wouldn't free his friends.
"People haven't been looking at us quite so much anymore," Draco said. "It's been dying down. Yet Diggory just glanced over at you
" Draco demanded.
But Malfoy only nodded, flippant, his expression unchanged as he kept his eyes on the professor. “Unfortunate, that.”
But she dispelled him of his notions immediately. “No, Harry,” she promised. “The opposite, in fact. See, I was waiting for something. At my wits end with the stagnation. Knowledge, it turns out, is useless with nothing to apply it to. And then, like a gift, there was you. A perfect riddle, tailored just for me. A combination of both of my life-long pursuits—Mind and Time. Talking to you and helping you, Harry, has been… I cannot describe it. It has fascinated me, more than you have realised, perhaps. Once we finish here, I believe I will have fulfilled what I was meant to.”
Harry blinked, his heartbeat stuttering before it suddenly kicked up rapidly. “Really?”
"I said to stop interrupting me you little—" Malfoy cut himself once her words registered, and gaped at Hermione as though she'd sprouted an extra head. His mouth opened and closed again, but he seemed at a loss. So Hermione plowed on.
Harry considered telling them all the truth, watching Cosima’s face crumple when he explained how Malfoy really felt about her and those like her, what he’d said. He imagined how they’d all react, the hate they’d start looking at Malfoy with in her defense. In the end, Harry pushed down his anger and shook his head.
Draco groaned and leaned against the wall. "I'm an awful person," he said, pulling Harry from his incredulous state.
Malfoy looked at Harry then, comprehension dawning at having heard Cordelia’s name listed after Cosima’s and Celine’s. Harry recognised the sudden guilt, and he scowled at the blond in response. Of course Malfoy would only be apologetic now he knew it wasn’t just muggleborns being targeted. Now that he knew it was people who were supposed to have been his friends. His guilt meant less than nothing, in Harry’s book.
Lavender blinked several times. “Is this about Draco?” she asked finally, throwing Harry off completely.
“Everything,” said Harry. “If I had just listened to you. I mean, you wouldn’t have even been there if it wasn’t for me volunteering. You could have died because I had to go be a hero.”
Harry hoped his confusion didn’t show on his face.
While it was true that Harry wasn’t actually entering the maze—thank Merlin—he would undoubtedly be apparating in at the first sign of actual danger. Hermione had informed Draco that Dumbledore was lifting the Apparition Wards during the task, so as to make it easier for the Aurors on hand to do their jobs. Draco hadn’t even known that was possible, and Hermione had seemed fascinated with the logistics of such a thing. Unfortunately for Draco, he’d yet to learn to apparate and couldn’t do so without help. The only way he’d be able to get into the maze was if he snuck in when it first opened. He didn’t have any other options.
His name was said frantically, the feminine voice laced with anxious worry. Harry could feel soft hands pressed to his cheeks. And, for a dazed moment of relief, he thought
Hermione patted him on the shoulder, exasperated. "Clearly."
Draco laughed aloud. “Speaking of unobservant,” he said when he’d finished, “you really didn’t know I wanted kids?”
“ … drama! … total princess—!”
“Does Mr. Potter not have the right to decide whether to fight for himself?” Lucius interjected, staring at Harry oddly.
For a moment, the woman simply stared at him. Then, slowly, she lowered her wand. “You’re not a Death Eater,” she said, sounding near incredulous. “You’re just an idiot kid.”
Harry held his breath for only a single moment, but then Draco—having returned unnoticed during the final explosion as planned—was sliding into the seat next to him. "Sorry professor, I just went to get the scurvy grass," he paused to tisk at their ruined potion, "though I suppose it was a waste of a trip."
is in love with him!” she hollered. “Are you truly so despicable that you would destroy our only son in this way? That you would choose something fickle as status over your own flesh and blood?!”
There was the sound of shuffling then, gravel shifting loudly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry Potter was beginning to get a bit nervous. There was only a week left until Christmas, when, at this rate, he would have to show up to the Yule Ball dateless and utterly humiliated. Cho's rejection still stung more than he wanted to admit, especially since she was going with Cedric. The only consolation was that Ron had yet to find anyone to take either, but thinking that with any sort of relief only made Harry a poor excuse for a best mate.
Draco's jaw was flexing, and Harry wanted to calm him but didn't know how. "I came out fine after the first task, this time'll be no different."
The way she said the word ‘bloodbath’ with such relish made Harry smile. “Why aren’t you trying out?” he questioned. She seemed like just the person for it, to him.
Surprise!! I hope no one minds the surprise update! There is an actual reason I am posting this early: I wrote this chapter and the next one in tandem with each other, because this one is actually built into the next but it’s—as you can see—long. Inserting it all in the exact section where it technically belonged didn’t read well and was more disruptive than anything. So after some discussion, it was decided that this be split off and posted as something of an interlude chapter/enhancer for the one following.

asked Fontaine. Then he sighed at their expressions. “The truth is we don’t understand how this happens, we wouldn’t know where to start. And, frankly, we don’t have the time. The investigation is open and being handled by professionals. There is nothing else to be done but wait and, in the interim, enforce our rules.”
“They’ll need more protection than just whatever handful of Aurors you can scrounge together standing on the sidelines,” Draco refuted. “I mean, can you even see into the maze if you aren’t a Champion?”
“Fine, I guess we’ll just move on from that,” Lavender said with a small shake of her head, “but secondly: are we honestly

They hadn’t been fighting because of that, that was nothing new to either of them. But there was no way to express this, so they both simply nodded along with the words.
“Library,” answered Malfoy. “That’s where I usually am around now.”
He sagged with relief when he caught sight of Harry, and Harry tried not to grimace at his obvious hope. Harry slid into Neville’s booth. “What did you do?”
Harry blinked. “Y-yeah. I just wasn’t, uh, sure that you would be okay with me being er—”
Draco huffed out an aggravated breath. "What the rutting hell am I supposed to
"—know what she told me? Said she can't tell the difference, people treat her just the same. I'm just one more example of how mad she is, according to them all. Simply because she believes a few strange things, honestly."
“You could pick truth instead,” she told him sweetly, her smile revealing nearly every tooth. Not for the first time, Hermione felt a bit wary of the dark haired girl. She thought perhaps Luna was intended to be the innocence to her lawlessness.
, while we’re at it, are a threat to us too, more so in some ways. Have you ever thought about how much faith we place in them? I know you grew up with muggles, Potter, did they love you?”
After a few sighs and halfhearted protests, the five of them were all sat down on the floor, crossed legged.
He shook it off quickly, though. “Sometimes I forget how foreign you are,” he sighed. “Quodpot is only the greatest sport in the world.”
“What’s it say?” Weasley added in a tone that Draco thought sounded rather like concern.
time…”
as I did—Merlin I almost wish I could go back to being clueless! I can't handle this—I can't handle
Harry had crawled forward while Draco was going on, and now he'd cut the explanation off with his lips. Hermione knew she should look away, as this suddenly felt a very private thing to see, but she didn't. None of the others did either, though, so she felt a bit better about it. Harry and Draco were not the only ones breathless once Harry pulled away.
“I wasn’t,” Draco answered genuinely. “Not at all.”
Harry’s expression morphed from amusement to concern in the space of a blink. “Hey, I didn’t mean to scare you. Is something wrong?”
Hermione nodded. “Yes, sir. They could take Polyjuice potion. No one who isn’t involved would know. And trained Aurors would be far more equipped to take on You-Know-Who.”
This was followed by the sound of a sharp crack, like rock being split apart. Draco’s breath was coming in shallow pants, and a glance at the Auror next to him revealed an upper lip pulled back in some mix of awe and disgust. He couldn’t understand why in Merlin’s name they weren’t stopping this right now. As soon as the thought crossed his mind, Not Fleur held up her index finger.
There was unfortunately nothing for it. The silent but undeniable
“What I mean is, he’ll just be dead. And we’ll all cry and mourn... but then we’ll move on. You know, heal.” Hermione understood then, but her friend continued anyway. “He won’t be here but not; looking at us but not knowing us. Awake but not… well you get it. It’s lucky because it won’t be that.”
The continuous sense of déjà vu nearly had Hermione dizzy for days afterward. It was as if Harry's name had come out of Goblet all over again, only completely different. Ron behaved the same, meaning of course that he pretended as though Harry no longer existed, as did the majority of the school, meaning distrustful or offended glances and mumbled insults. Everything was just the same, with the only exception being the near entirety of Slytherin House. Instead of ridiculous badges and hissed insults, the Slytherins now guarded Harry and Malfoy as though they were some sort of royalty.
“What are you on about?”
“Oh.”
“I’m not a medic or anything,” he replied anyway. “I don’t know how to help him. Who is he?”
she added.
“I know we haven’t really talked about it, so if you don’t—”
“You guys gotta stop looking at me like that,” she admonished. “I might start thinking you’re homophobes or something… well okay, no I wouldn’t,” she amended, laughing for a reason Harry didn’t understand. “But yeah, I’m a lesbian, and proud of it too.”
came to see.”
It was like he could no longer contain the question. No longer stomach it.
, you would not choose that monster. You would choose us,” she said as she walked away from Lucius Malfoy.
then?! I don't know what he
Since then, Cole and the other Aurors who’d been Polyjuiced had essentially vanished. It was rumoured that Scrimgeour, supposedly on Dumbledore’s request, had selected them for a top secret mission. Hermione had assured Harry, however, that it was nothing to be concerned about. Harry wasn’t, for once. He had enough to be concerned about already.
He was right, but Severus still spoke. "Now, if you please."
Harry and Malfoy stared at her, shocked speechless again. “You mean…?” Harry tried.
Lucius deigned to speak to—were conversing.
There was a brief flash of pity mingled with something else before the blond got back on track. “Well, I was going to ask ‘what if they hadn’t?’ but this actually works better. Why did they protect you, then, why not take you to some church and have you drowned?”
"Constantly," Harry replied.
“Look at it this way,” Edgar said easily, “most people aren’t pieces of shit, especially not Healers. Believe me, if you study for that long to be able to help people, you don’t care who they are. Unless you’re fucked in the head. All’s I’m saying is that even if this law gets passed, which it won’t, than the chance anyone actually uses it is crazy unlikely. Like, not gonna happen.”
Draco shook his head dismissively. “Right. Let me just sneak into the third task. Why should that be difficult? There’ll only be hundreds of people in the audience and an Auror every ten feet. Piece of cake.”
There was a scattering of applause and laughter, as if agreeing only partially.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a huff, Hermione rose. "Certainly not," she replied, and stomped off in search of Luna.

"It's just that erm, how exactly are you going to
“Wish I could show you what you looked like just now,” he said, and Harry recognised that he was being teased.
He and Malfoy sat beside each other as the stands filled up. Half the school must’ve showed just to watch, the chatter deafening while more and more people filled the field. Harry could just make out Joshua, his dark silhouette in direct contrast to the slightly shorter, lightly tanned brunet next to him. Even from where Harry sat, it was clear they were already arguing.
“What worse results?!” Theo snapped. “There is no worse, worse would be you dead.”
“I’m really happy for you two,” Harry said sincerely, feeling sheepish.
"Do the world a favour and at least get a room," Ron said venomously. "Other people
“Draco Malfoy.”
defend
And he’d been incredibly unfair to Lavender, too.
Draco wanted to defend the old wizard and his parents, but he held his tongue when he realised he didn’t know how. There was nothing to prove the Auror wrong. Here they stood, having gone through the whole maze and staring at the finish line, and nothing had happened. It didn’t make sense, but there was nothing Draco could say.
“That doesn’t seem fair,” protested Matt.
She seemed to have gotten temporarily lost in her offensive ranting, but then she shook it off. She blew out another annoyed breath. “Fine. Just stay close to me and try not to get killed, will you? I’m probably already going to be demoted as it is.”
Ron looked uncomfortable now. "Uh, but... there's only a few minutes of class left..."
"I'm sorry what was that?" Pansy asked innocently.
Harry could practically
"You didn't see what it was like down there. You were... comatose. You all were," he defended.
Their faces were close enough for their breath to mingle, and Draco only had to shift forward a fraction to bring his lips to Harry’s. The kiss started off slow and deep, saying everything the blond hadn’t said the way he’d clearly wanted to. With Draco’s lips gentle so insistent his, Harry could practically hear the words.
Not Harry, who had obviously landed badly, twisted around to scowl at him. The look was all at once so familiar and not familiar at all that it stole the blond’s breath for a moment.
The question was so quiet that Harry’s heart clenched. “No,” he said firmly. “Dudley knocked me about when we were kids and he was still capable of catching me. And my uncle will be... my uncle sometimes. But it’s nothing like what you’re clearly thinking, alright? They wouldn’t dare. I know I’ve got magic now, and if there’s one thing they’re afraid of it’s magic.”
I’m a little afraid to say it: we’re soon going to entering the final ‘act’ of this fic, so to speak. At least according to my outline and increased mental planning. Judging by where we’re at, I think I can risk making an educated *guess* and say that this fic will probably clock in at ~90k by the time it’s complete. I think. Which is WILD, holy shit.
It made it
Luna was not alone when Hermione found her. The blonde was in the greenhouse with Neville; they’d made fast-friends, he being one of the only non-Slytherin in all of Hogwarts besides Hermione who showed her—and Harry as well—open support.
She disapparated without further comment. Harry sat down on one of his kitchen stools, his mind once again a jumbled mess.
Before she could answer, the Auror who looked like Diggory showed up. He took in the sight of all three of them standing around the cup and blinked. “What’s going on?”
exclaimed Noelle,
“I do not hate you, Draco.”
Malfoy’s shoulders slumped. “Right,” he said, standing up. “I left my Charms book in the dorm.”
"She's my friend too!" Harry waved his arm toward Hermione. More bubbles. "I don't want

"No! I—wait. Huh?" Ron turned and scanned the area around them. Most had returned to their fun after Harry and Malfoy had left, but then there they were. A young blonde was twirling in the arms of the female Slytherin in a way that was decidedly non-platonic. As he watched, the blonde suddenly went up on her tiptoes and planted a brief kiss on the Slytherin girl’s lips, afterwhich they both blushed. Ron, once again, was gobsmacked.
is in perfect bloody health,” Harry spit. Then, remembering himself, he bit his lip apologetically. “I’m sorry.”
Draco looked around, double checking that no one was in the hallway before turning back to the red head. “I need his cloak, Weasley. And I really, really need him not to know about it.”
he thought,

Harry couldn’t help sucking in a surprised breath, immediately locking eyes with his husband.
“You’ve no idea,” Malfoy admitted. Harry echoed him.
Harry thought, unbidden, and then nearly stumbled over his own feet because he had no idea where that’d come from. Draco Malfoy certainly was not
It didn’t seem long before Bagman—who, as far as Draco knew, had no idea what was actually going on—was shouting, “Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin!”
time I do something you don't like?"
“I’ll let Skeeter know you quit.”
Harry just looked at her. “A good thing,” he repeated slowly. “I tell you that I think I’m well and truly on the way to being erased, that it’s getting that much harder to keep my mind my own, and you say it’s a good thing? Weren’t you listening at all to what I said happened yesterday?”
“You know,” Neville began, “it’s really horrible of me to think this, but, in a way, it’s lucky.”
“Neville,” Harry sighed. “Listen to me. You have to be more careful if you’re going to keep doing this. He’s not just your manager; he’s the head of your label. And that might just be one thing, if he wasn’t married.”
Except then, before he had time to properly panic, she was bursting into laughter at his pained expression.
Pansy laughed. "Alright then. Go on Neville, choose someone."
Hermione sighed, took a breath, and launched into the tale that was last year. By the end, Draco was gaping openly at the both of them. Harry didn’t blame him, he wouldn’t know what to say either if he hadn’t lived it all himself.
“Gentlemen,” the man greeted kindly, as though Harry and Malfoy had come to introduce themselves instead of standing before him bleeding and mildly bruised.
Guess what! This chapter officially makes this my longest fic! I’m so happy to post it, especially since this chapter nearly defeated me with how hard it refused to come together like I wanted it to. But I championed through it eventually, and it’s a bit longer than usual. Hope you guys enjoy :)
Luna looked intrigued, Neville slightly more apprehensive. "Alright I suppose," he said slowly.
“What in the rutting hell did you do?” Theo sighed.
“Ron was asking about you again today,” she was saying to Draco. “I thought you’d like to know that. I never would have imagined a year ago that the two of you would be friends. Or the two of us, for that matter. But I’m so glad we are... I miss you. We all miss you. Your parents miss you. Harry misses you, though I’m sure he tells you that himself often enough. He’s... not well, Draco. I don’t think you’d want to see him like this. His birthday came and went a while back, turned fifteen and he didn’t even blink. It’s—”
to understand how you could love him that much and still…”
how it is for you to be around family. No matter what you think of me, I have always understood why you do what you do, even if you don’t want to hear that. But you have to know that Amjad is different; he’s always thought you hung the moon. So I don’t want you to lie to him if you’re just going to hurt him later when you realise you can’t handle it.”
thoughts on Harry's new reality so far? I consider this to be when things really get started. The next chapter is also the last one I had pre-written before we started, so we're in the swing of things now.
Harry released a deep sigh, exasperated and guilty at once. If he were honest, he hadn’t thought about his mission to help Neville since he’d last seen him. It had simply gotten buried beneath everything else that was going on, just as he’d hoped it wouldn’t. Which meant, of course, that he really had nothing to offer the man.
The room turned to look at her simultaneously as she flushed. “Sorry,” she said. “I only thought that perhaps Mrs. Malfoy was on track about the Aurors. Except, what if instead of sitting on the sidelines and hoping, they actually, er, went in?”
"Goodnight, Hermione." He left the library still feeling chilled and more than a bit out of sorts, the ridiculous letter crumpled in his fist.
“Who says I’ve been avoiding you,” the other boy defended.
It took hardly any time at all to spot a certain singer, even with how different his hair made him look in person. He was sitting alone at the bar, eyeing the whiskey in his glass with an absent expression. Harry took a deep breath and sat down on the stool next to him. The other man looked up at the movement, and his fingers visibly tightened around his drink.
“Dismissed.”
"Oi," Draco said, "I'm sitting right here."
"Er... Zabini–erm, I mean should I call you Blaise?"
And then, cheeks reddened, she turned heel and stormed away.
"Well... take a bath, okay?"
Draco winced as the words reverberated through his mind. Despite what had happened this year, Lucius Malfoy had not been a bad father. For most of Draco’s life, his father had done nothing but push him toward greatness. He’d said it was what Draco deserved.
Answers like how beautiful Draco was, especially when he smiled, and the calming sound of his voice. Like his selflessness when it came to his sister and his dearest friends. Like the way he’d get so excited about his job, and how he would encourage Harry to do what made him happy. Like his honesty, his self-confidence, his stunning capacity for forgiveness.
The Potion master’s status as Draco’s godfather didn’t mean that Harry had to like him, apparently. Not that the blond would expect him to.
"Don't try to compare any of that other shite to this. This is about
Malfoy cut him off with his lips. Somewhere far far away, Harry heard someone—or perhaps several someones—gasping. But it was the last thing he cared about. At the moment, there was no one else in the entire world that mattered but Draco.
Cedric, however, didn't appear to notice anything amiss. "Listen... I still owe you one for telling me about the dragons. Would have told you sooner but you've been... anyway. About the golden egg, does yours wail when you open it?"
memories, remember? Thinks they’re all horrible and avoids…” Harry’d trailed off, locking eyes with Sheila as it had occurred to him. “That has something to do with all of this, too, doesn’t it? This entire situation. He vanishes—er, occludes more forcefully when
,” Draco said. “It also doesn’t make me feel better for you to blame yourself for what happened when it was my decision to be in that bloody maze. I would have figured out a way to do what I did with or without you, probably with even worse results.”
Harry nodded, glad for their enthusiasm.
was going to be at the wedding, being Fred’s brother and all. It was just too strange to think on for very long.
expect you to tell me about Bella. Not right this very minute, because we’ve been in here for ages and people probably assume we are doing something inappropriate—” Harry felt all the blood rush to his face and neck at that, and Draco looked minorly derailed. “Merlin, what, are you shy now?”
The younger blond remained silent, unwilling to make any assumptions.
“I need to talk to you,” Harry told her. “It’s important.”
On Friday, Draco decided to mention it to Harry, Hermione and Ron. He definitely hadn’t expected the sharp look Hermione sent Harry’s way, or for Harry to look sheepishly at the floor.
“I don’t have a very clear idea what’s going on with the two of you, mate, but I think you need to fix it. We all hate seeing you like this.”
Harry had shaken his head.
Harry could only nod mutely. Now that he’d been told all he was interested in learning, reality had begun to set back in, and his attention returned to Draco. He hardly noticed when Dumbledore left.
It wasn’t that he thought Sheila would ever share what he told her. Harry was actually fairly sure she would understand what he’d chosen to do about Bellatrix. But that wasn’t what mattered.
“Married life’s really worth it then?” Ron asked with a half smile.
Now he stood just outside the women’s restroom, waiting casually until, finally, it opened.
Harry scoffed. "He's staring at
“Tell them I’m going to take the longest shower I’ve ever taken, so it’s fine if you lot eat breakfast without me. And Dad?” he asked before the older man could leave. “Could you call him Harry?”
Draco looked at him for a moment. "Sometimes I still can't believe this is real," he told Harry quietly. "You don't know how long I—you can't know what it was like."
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Ah, but we’re free spirits by choice dear,” she reminded him, eyeing a certain blonde across the room.
Lavender must have read enough in his expression, because she sighed heavily. “Merlin, Harry. Well, I say you had better invite him, anyway. There’s not many opportunities you’ll get to do something like this. Maybe the setting will help you finally work out how you feel, or something.”
"You take your own hostage," one of them said. "Leave the others."
"You mean Pansy Parkinson and Luna Lovegood?" Hermione asked cheekily.
“Not that this isn’t adorable,” Blaise eventually said. “But choose someone else before I get bored.”
"Hey Potter!" Malfoy's unmistakable, honeyed voice interrupted Harry's thoughts and had him tensing before he'd even turned around.
As they walked off the grounds, Harry thought how lucky he was to have avoided seeing Dumbledore face to face, but he knew he would have to some day. He wasn’t ready right now for how that would feel. It was an effort not to be too visibly relieved when they landed back in his flat.
sleep.”
Snape turned to Dumbledore in the next second. “Do you believe Rufus would agree to this?”
Harry very nearly slumped with relief.
Pansy sighed. "You just need to go about it the right way, love. Despite what you believe, Potter looks at you the same as you look at him."
who you’ve just informed me has agreed to speak to you again. Regularly. And you’ve not done anything since!”
“I wanted to speak with you,” Lucius said.
“I deserve to see this through,” he said. “Polyjuice everyone else. I don’t think that the others should still be put in danger, but I should be there.”
Auror Fleur silently commanded him.
He avoided having his eyes on Ophelia for too long, and instead smiled in welcome at Daphne, Dean, and another man Harry hadn’t yet met in this life.
Neville rolled his eyes, but then he got a serious look about him. “Heard about what happened with him the other night. Makes a bit more sense now why you might’ve had your change of heart. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s what made me feel better about trusting you.”
And with that, the Slytherin girl stood up and stormed off to her rooms, leaving Draco slack jawed and Blaise back to silently admiring his nails.
“Me and Cel were just a couple of little girls,” Cosima explained, “but Anthony was this educated sixth year. So when everything happened just the same, big search parties and super strict curfews and the whole damn works turned up nothing until he just stumbled right into the Great Hall on Christmas, suddenly a Squib just like us…”
Draco blinked in confusion, even as his heart returned to a normal pace. “For what?”
“I know exactly what I’m talking about,” Harry retorted, getting frustrated now. “I had the story all written up. I had photos.”
Bellatrix’s next closest male relative, Sirius Black, had at that point been long disowned—this by his late father, Orion Black, whom was believed to have likely been assassinated by his cousin Cygnus, who stood to gain the title of Head—unaware, of course, that he would maintain it for only a handful of years. A footnote indicated that Orion’s wife, Walburga, was said to have died of heartbreak.
In the end, Harry was deemed having shown
When Theo entered the room and sat down next to him, Draco wondered absently if the other boy had recently acquired the ability to sense when he was in despair. It seemed unlikely, but lately what did Draco know?
Harry’d even spontaneously divulged at Draco’s birthday party a few weeks back—in front of quite the audience since it seemed that nearly all of Hogwarts had shown up to celebrate the once despised “Prince of Slytherin”—that the sorting hat had wanted to place Harry himself in Slytherin. Draco had a field day with the fact that he’d refused, which Harry had found incredibly endearing.
Midway through the week, though, Draco finally noticed that there was something else to be concerned about: Theo was avoiding him. At first he thought he was imagining things. Theo still hung around the Slytherin common room at night as he always did; still spoke to all his friends as though everything was fine. But whenever Draco would enter the library, or sit down in the Hall to eat, or get anywhere close to Theo, the other boy would get up silently and go find other things to do.
Draco swallowed. “What’s today?”
And then he went right back to staring at the textbook in his lap as though he hadn’t said anything at all.
Harry had given a slow blink. “He’s occluding against me.” It had been a revelation accompanied by almost no shock. Of course that’s what the prat had been doing! How many mental walls had Harry tried and failed to construct against Snape, back in sixth year? And yet Harim could throw a wall up between himself and Harry, shoving him out like it was nothing, retreating behind it like it was an iron shield. Vanished, Harry had assumed.
Draco hissed mentally.
Draco took a few minutes to speak again. "Right, I—um. Class is probably a good, er, idea, yeah?"
“Wait!” Harry shouted, which at least got her to pause. He hurried to explain, wordlessly turning off the stove and sending the eggs into the fridge with magic. “Please just give me a second. I just forgot what today was, I promise. I
Who wouldn’t,
Draco bumped him in the shoulder. For a while, Harry allowed himself some space to enjoy himself. Draco and his friends swayed along, or danced, mouthing some of the words here and there. Even Ophelia seemed to loosen up around Daphne and appeared to be having a grand time herself.
Harry did so gladly.
It was the desperation in Draco’s nearly-black eyes that did him in. “Alright.”
Harry suppressed his sardonic snort at Malfoy’s version of an explanation, knowing it would hardly help the situation. He couldn’t stop his eyes from rolling, though. Fontaine didn’t notice; he let out a long sigh and stood up, walking towards the window to his left and staring out of it. His back to the two boys, he spoke again.
The older Moore sounded worse than Umbridge, which was possibly the worst insult that could be bestowed on anyone. What sort of a mother has record of her daughter’s existence sealed to save face?
“Nope,” she replied, lips popping on the
“I believe so master,” another unfamiliar voice replied somewhat fearfully. “The portkey has been used.”

McGonagall stepped forward and rested her hand on Harry’s shoulder. “The Tournament cannot go ahead as planned Mr. Potter. It will have to be postponed or cancelled.”
“They’re making me Polyjuice as some Auror, the one who’ll be Polyjuiced as me,” Harry finally answered for himself. “I only get to show up after Voldemort makes a move.”
“But—”
A look at the man was enough to be sure, as the family resemblance to his older brother was strong. Harry greeted him like they were old friends, and hoped he wasn’t too stiff about it.
Blaise’s curtains had opened approximately twenty seconds after Harry had left the room. Draco wished he was a bit more surprised.
Draco smiled, sitting up now and looking genuinely elated. “Do you love me?” he inquired of Harry.
The Auror must have heard his footfalls, as she suddenly stopped and swung back around to face him. Her wand was pointed at his neck in seconds.
from me!"
my friends, actually. Harry will go with you to see them inside.”
Draco grabbed the back of Harry’s neck and pulled him forward, crashing their lips together. He decided this was far better than being dead.
Harry spared himself a moment to wish he might have come upon a mostly empty house, in which Molly might’ve been making pastries or engaged in something equally simple to pass the time, and wouldn’t have minded the interruption of a little company.
“Are you ever planning to propose?” Draco inquired lightly, taking a sip of his champagne.
It took Harry a few moments longer than he should have to think of what to say. “Let what happen?”
Accident or no, that would have been murder, had he not been ludicrously lucky.
But what he found when he lifted the sleeve derailed him.
that?” Malfoy demanded, ignoring her last comment completely.
“Do you have an alternative?” McGonagall tactfully inquired.
“Yes...” Draco replied slowly.
" the blond hissed.
"Ah," the girl appeared delighted, "but Harry doesn't."
It was a common thing to refer to Draco Malfoy as the Prince of Slytherin, but Hermione had not quite guessed at how literal this could be taken until she'd found herself sat next to Harry in the Slytherin common room yet again. Harry was now surrounded by Slytherins at any given time, so, when night would fall and they naturally congregated towards their common room, Harry tended to follow, leaving Hermione to decide whether or not she would go along too. For the third night in a row, she had.
Now: wherever you all are in the world, please please be safe. Stay home if you can. Be careful if you can’t. Make good decisions and think of others when you do. As always, much love and thank you so much for reading xx
Pansy giggled. “Fine. I dare you to dye your hair bright apple green for a week.”
“I never properly apologised to you, son.”
It was like cold water had been dumped all over Harry just then.
“You didn’t mention you’d be coming by today, dear,” she admonished fondly. “Shamim will be thrilled.”
And among them, barking orders in a high pitched, feeble voice, was the most foul creature Harry had ever seen. It wore black robes that covered the majority of its form, but what was left was more than Harry had ever wanted to see. Its limbs were a sickly shade of white, veins stark against it. Its head resembled that of aliens Harry had seen on the telly a few times growing up, with red eyes to boot. The thing looked as though it might collapse at any minute, a wand held uselessly in its grip.
But here stood the bright-eyed, dimpled proof that he couldn’t of torn
They roared their agreement, and Neville flashed his brightest celebrity-watt smile back at them.
"Not a problem. I'm here to talk about Harry."
Harry smiled. It had only been a handful of days since he’d settled into his new—old—rooms. Really, it was his own wing; there was plenty of space for practically all of his belongings, so nothing had needed to go into storage. And nothing that had already been there—waiting for him to return, apparently—had even needed to be removed.
But Potter said "How much have you had to drink, Malfoy?"
Far more interesting was what had happened after, when Karkaroff had entered the classroom and insisted that he and Snape talk. As it ended up, Karkaroff hovered over Snape for the rest of the lesson, until he finally dismissed them. Harry and Draco silently agreed that Draco would stay behind and eavesdrop, and so Harry left the room along with the others.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "That's what Harry thought. But I don't buy it, especially not now."
someone screeched, and a jet of dark purple light went just past his side and hit Draco squarely in the chest.
“Nice!” Dean yelled from Harry’s right. “When you said right up front you really meant it!”
The words were playful, but Harry wanted to give a real answer, sentimental as it was going to sound. He looked Draco directly in the eyes. "No, I didn't. Not this you, anyway. I'd never heard you laugh like you do when you're happy. I'd never seen you be playful or protective or caring. And now that I have, it doesn't matter who calls me disgusting or delusional or whatever else, because you are incredi–"
Harry laughed and kissed him, and it felt every bit as brilliant as the first time they'd ever kissed. "I love you," Harry said between that kiss and the next. Another "I love you" after it. Then another kiss. "I love you." And another. "I love you." And another. "I love you."
“I noticed,” replied Harry. “I just don’t care anymore.”
Maria and Celine looked taken aback. “Clark likes everyone,” said Maria.
The blond smiled wider and sat up, rolling his shoulders. "Didn't mean to nod off, knew you'd probably come. Any luck?"
The majority, if not every student in the room besides Harry himself, likely already knew everything that Hanson said. If there was ever a day for messing around, this was it. But no one did, completely immersed in the ‘lesson,’ which was really just sports discussion disguised as work. Not that Harry was complaining. He was actually fascinated, learning about how a faulty Quaffle could have given birth to an entire game all its own. The rules seemed fairly straightforward, all essentially boiling down to: score a point and don’t let anything explode in your face. He came out thinking that he might actually have fancied playing, if his heart didn’t already belong to Quidditch.

"Don't do what?"
best friend, and tell her everything while you’re at it. I’m sure she’ll take you right in, believe you straight away. Surely won’t think that you’re a nutter at all. Because she’s
“Er,” Harry said.
The five of them all looked around. She was right, obviously. They must’ve come miles—perhaps hundreds of miles—to get here. There was no telling how long it would take the rest of the Aurors back at Hogwarts to track them and apparate here. After all, Draco had no idea how closely they were being monitored. What if the rest of the Auror force hadn’t yet noticed they were gone?
A faint glow lit the cavernous space as soon as he’d stepped inside, greeting him with acceptable reading conditions. Perhaps it knew what he was here to learn; everything before him was a part of his inheritance, after all.
“No!” he said quickly, then took a deep breath. “Lucky that it’ll either be one or the other. I mean, you heard what the Healers said. If Draco wakes up, he’ll be alright. I mean... there might be stuff he’ll have to work though, but for the most part he’s supposed to be okay if he lives. And if he dies, well, then he’s dead.”
“What?” Harry asked.
The darkness didn’t begin or end with Draco, but he was a part of it. And that would always be true. It was high time Harry began acknowledging it.
He was alive.
“You’re a pureblood without any magic,” Celine had mimicked once several days ago, voice pitched in an obnoxious mockery, “a disgrace! You’re not welcome in any home of mine!”
"—the least you could do is dance with me."
Hermione sighed. Harry had missed two weeks of classes so far, and refused to even entertain the subject with anyone—his godfather included. Sirius wasn’t much for applying force, even after becoming Harry’s legal guardian. Narcissa had also tried to convince Harry this wasn’t what Draco would have wanted, but she couldn’t exactly hold up against his retorts. The older woman had abandoned her life just as much as Harry had—more so, even.
“I’m not here for… anything like that,” Harry began, but Neville cut him off with a scoff.
“It might be good for you,” Harry said. “Why should you have to keep those memories?”
The Slytherin girl smiled. "Truth."
Harry pulled back a bit to see the Slytherin's face again. He was so
“You came,” he said, ushering them all in.
Harry and Malfoy exchanged a look, and Harry could tell they were thinking the same thing. How long had it been since the two of them were actually
“I would offer my advice,” she eventually said, a sight colder than she’d ever spoken to him before, “but I think that’s become rather a lost cause. You might as well just leave.”
He related all this to Sheila, who hummed. “And Draco?” she asked, seeming to brush away Harry’s joviality. “I assume you’ve not heard from him since your confessional.”
"Truth," Blaise replied without missing a beat.
apart for everyone.
She reached forward and pulled the redhead into a hug. "Happy," she answered. "And now especially."
Blaise turned the lights off a minute later, ignoring Greg's exhausted-sounding, futile protests.
The blond turned, slowly, to look at Harry.
This is where I started listing song inspiration. I’ve deleted a lot of those chapter notes now and linked the Spotify playlist at the end of the fic. If you’re coming across this now: enjoy the music!
It hadn’t been a snap decision, even though it might have appeared that way to some. But it hadn’t been. It had been Harry, standing in the ringing silence of his flat, and coming to the uncomfortable realisation that he was very, very alone there.
He didn’t dare risk a glance at the Slytherin, instead focusing on
“You’re gonna do it right?” Theo asked. “Use the cloak?”
"What?"
Because, Harry, all people are who they are due to their knowledge base and formative occurrences. What we perceive and go through build our preferences, solidify our fears, desires, intentions, aspirations, you name it. This, as well as all the many reasons why we behave as we do in accordance to certain positive or negative stimuli.
What about the summer Harry? What then?”
“Your other arm you sniveling failure. I need a servant who will perform what I ask of them with some degree of success,” spit the Dark Lord disdainfully.
The relentless hollering from the crowd was met with the first strings of a recent Coldplay song.
switch, obviously
Draco said. He’d never been told which Death Eater had done it, had never asked.
Like how Bellatrix Black, at the ripe age of twenty nine, had ruthlessly terminated her betrothal contract to one Rodolphus Lestrange, by allegedly—and in this case
“What.” The word attempted to be flat, but cracked on the edge.
“I’m alright, mum,” he whispered into her long blonde hair. “I’m alive.”
“Having a good day Mr. Potter?” professor Hanson asked him as he entered the classroom just then. Several people giggled, but Harry just nodded.
"What," spit the other man.
He was relieved, admittedly, that questioning it now
"I don't know Harry," said Hermione. "It didn't sound like he was very rude to you. And you said he was alone when he asked."
“So, love,” summarised Malfoy, blunt as ever.
“Then you have nothing to be worried about,” he assured her.
” Draco stressed each word as though they were separate statements. “I’m—I wouldn’t even know who I am without you anymore. And you’re just completely alright delivering yourself to the monster whose life mission is to kill you because
Harry gaped at him.
He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. “What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he asked.
have to be the one who knows best for you, mate.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Harry was saying to Neville later that evening. “The way Lav dove, the poor bouquet didn’t stand a chance.”
“Come on,” insisted the blond. “At least tell me why you don’t like your cousin.”
"And yet," said Pansy, "not much seems to have changed."
"I owe her quite a few apologies," Malfoy said quietly. "Owe you a couple too Panse."
“What about if professor Clark doesn’t like you?” he asked, unable to stop himself glancing at Malfoy again, who pointedly did not look up.
“May the best Seeker win?” Harry asked, tone equally light.
It was Draco’s father that spoke. “How is none of your concern,” he paused as his wife’s elbow met his ribs with a stern look. He continued smoothly, though, as if nothing had happened. “What is important is when, which will be during Potter’s final task.”
Draco nearly fell out of the bed. "Come in then," he croaked.
murdering her father, Cygnus Black—the then Head of House Black—and her mother, Druella, in their sleep.
"Gillyweed," replied Draco.
"Your mother can't of—"
Harry sat back, his food entirely forgotten as he digested the horror story he’d just been informed of. Eventually, Maria stood. “I have Siskin for first, too, come on. They say he really hates it when kids are late.”
But Neville was looking at her with the same coldness he’d shown Harry when he’d first sat down. “Perhaps to you,” Neville allowed.
your better half?"
Noelle looked Harry over and then smirked at Malfoy.
Harry shrugged, but he knew his doubt was obvious. The minutes ticked by.
Pansy cut both her friends a venomous look. “She’s
“I always look pale,” Draco defended. Then, seeming to replay his words, snapped his jaw shut.
“I didn’t realise that you…”
“A horrible one!”
That is even to say nothing of the cost to your magical core. Magical signatures notwithstanding, and to be explicitly, abundantly clear, Harry: you share the same
Harry briefly pictured himself taking Draco clubbing with Lavender, Parvati, and Pansy Parkinson, and cringed. He was certain
Lavender rounded on him. “You don’t even
“And I have to insist that that would be counterproductive,” Snape fired back.
"Lo–Neville."
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath. He looked determined. “Okay, I believe you. Okay, I won’t take my willful naivety out on you, now. Whatever my original reasons for allowing you to prove it, you do seem to have changed. I won’t just throw that away.”
He blushed immediately. "Uh, Hagrid took me to get robes before first year, and I met Draco. I thought he was a bit of a, well," Harry shrugged. "Didn't start on the right foot on my end. I didn't tell him my name though, so he didn't know he'd met me, really, not until the train."
Neville whistled low, pitying. “Harsh,” he said, all sympathy.
Lucius only stared at her. “What does our family care for Harry Potter?”
been trying to take over his other self’s life, in the sense of dropping in and acting like everything was perfectly normal. Letting everyone believe the lie. Maybe it had caused this, in part. He missed his friends, his life—but he hadn’t made any effort to reacquaint himself, really.
This Neville here with him was not so different, he suspected. He didn’t want to be disloyal, and he let what people said get to him, but he had bravery in him. That had been what Harry was appealing to.
“Ron.”
“You were telling him the truth, right?” his sister finally asked, sounding almost unwilling.
“My Lord…” the servant choked, “my Lord … you promised… you did promise…”
you to give a toss that I was a person before you buried me.”
Blaise made a lazy gesture for her to continue.
Harry abruptly felt awful for how hurt she sounded. “Lavender,” he said uselessly.
"He deserved that," Fred's amused voice assured Harry, who promptly whipped around to see the twins standing not ten feet away, appearing as though trying not to laugh. They'd clearly been there the entire time. Harry tried not to show his surprise when Fred winked at him, playful as he ever was back when they were friends. And suddenly Harry realized that none of the other Weasleys had ever told him they weren't still friends. Harry’s mind chose that moment to remind him that Luna was actually friends with Ginny. He’d just... assumed the red haired girl hated Draco, and therefore him by default. But had she ever actually said so? Had he even spoken to her about it? The only one of the family he could now recall having an outright issue was, in fact, Ron.
Harry knew that in a few minutes he’d join them and Harry would have to choke out a thank you before doing what he really wanted to do and hitting him upside the head.
Thank you to everyone who reads this. And thanks a million to everyone who has or will comment, I really appreciate/d it c:
"Blaise," he said.
The (even sappier, because that’s how I roll) epilogue is written and will be posted tomorrow. I’m emotional.
Hey all! I hope you liked the chapter; I’ve been saying for a while now that Draco will become more centric soon, and that time is finally getting started. I honestly am excited.
Neville was glancing between the two of them cautiously, and Lavender was barely keeping her false smile on her face.
There was, of course, no response from Harim.
of all people, surely he wasn’t perceiving anything the way it was truly meant.
“Starting to think I might be with you there,” Neville said.
Harry was tired. It was nearly all he could feel, an exhaustion so acute it overrode everything else.
“You can call me Harim, if you prefer,”
"Ah, but I’m half sloshed, you aren’t. And you hate me."
“Oh no. You owe me an explanation for why I had to come into work to find out that not only did you not give Skeeter your ‘epic’ story, but now she’s hounding my arse and accusing us of slacking off for the whole month,” Lavender yelled. “And then I go in to see what exactly you think you’re doing, and you tell Neville Longbottom to never even speak to me?!”
“’lo Neville,” she said when her friend came in.
"Bit rich for you of all people to complain about prejudice, Malfoy."
Some questions answered at last... thoughts?
At that, she was abruptly shushed by Madam Pince, but for once the chastisement hardly mattered. "That's genius!" She exclaimed in a whisper this time. "Neville helped I take it?"
“Draco,” said Theo’s voice.
“No more than it’s always been,” he reminded her. “Believe me, it’s worth it. So long as you love him.”
Neville sat down next to her. “I’m actually here to, um, see my parents. But I told Blaise I’d stop in while I was here, see if there was news.”
The four of them turned to look as Auror Krum joined them.
But this was
But, he privately realised, he had people who made the attempt to help him as best they could.
“Okay,” Theo said finally. “I’m... I’m really glad you’re alive mate.”
"I wouldn't do that again—I swear it this time."
Harry looked up at Hermione helplessly.
Not all that long a time had passed when Neville returned, blowing into the room as though hell itself was on his heels. He sat back down and breathed out a great sigh of relief. "Thought for sure Filch had me," he told them once his breath returned.
“Are you grand-gesturing me right now?” Draco asked finally, over the music. “Is that what this actually is?”
“Get out, alright?” the blond said, still not looking at him. “You want to be a self sacrificing Gryffindor you can go be one. Away from me.”
Faintly, Draco could just make out the sound of gravel shifting underneath someone’s feet.
Harry absorbed that information, too slowly. Of course, he thought. What had he been thinking? That they were somehow going to stop a coming war using the information in his head? It sounded incredibly naive now that Sheila had laid it before him like that. They just wanted to know, for themselves. Because they wanted to know everything. In his past life, Hermione had often complained about the lack of action taken in her line of work. But he hadn’t given it much weight. He’d been living in his own haze at the time.
The man’s face softened a fraction, as though he could not help it. “I’ve always loved you Cissa,” he attempted to assure her.
Harry was more than happy that Draco and Hermione were friends, that they spent time together without him even. It was like he and Hermione were always meant to be a part of a trio, and now Draco had filled the vacant space. Except not at all, because Harry still missed Ron terribly.
The Slytherin’s smile lessened. “You never talk about your family,” he said as though it’d only just then occurred to him.
special
Malfoy shrugged—
"Wonder how many times he'll have to reject me before I finally get it, yeah?" Draco said, attempting to sound light. The words, instead, came out rather hollow even to his ears, and he internally winced.
Harry tried to speak, but no words would come. His throat closed, a damnable heat building behind his eyes.
Lucius looked like he had something else he planned to say, but just then the statue swung aside again. Weasley, Hermione and Harry all came out.
You share your temperament; this is the scale at which you feel and process emotion.
Cosima nodded, giving him a sad smile as if she’d realised what it cost him to ask. “Not all of us do, though,” she admitted. “They let the Taken stay and go to the specialized classes for the magically sensitive, hoping our magic will come back someday. But… some of us don’t bother. Last we heard, Anthony goes to no-maj law school now.”
“Harry Potter!” called the second voice. “You are miles from protection and have nowhere to run, come out and surrender painlessly.”
Draco’s eyes sharpened, and Harry was filled with the disconcerting notion that Draco could see right through him. That the blond somehow, inconceivably, would have a sense what those words meant to Harry.
Pansy practically suffocated him.
“Hey uncle Remus,” Ayesha called with an answering grin; she strode towards the older man and gave him a familiar hug.
Neville and Blaise burst into the room, supporting each other and laughing maniacally between heavy breaths. Hermione couldn’t recall when Nev had ever looked quite as carefree.
And you know it’s true. They call us demons; every single time we’ve revealed ourselves, we get murdered in droves. Because muggles can’t be trusted. And mud–
"Draco..."
"Herm-own-ninny," Viktor called over to them before Harry could think of anything to say. "'Ze scores!"
And so, as someone who has gotten to know you well enough to care for you genuinely, I will say that this is no longer a suggestion, it is an order—one that I make despite your discomfort and your pride, for the sake of your well being: merge. You should not go on this way, and you don’t have to.”
Draco had been dating Harry for a while now, but he didn't think he'd ever get used to Neville Longbottom feeling comfortable around him, let alone being friends. But Neville was actually alright, he and Blaise had made fast-friends. And Draco also knew it made Harry happy to still have some of his friends from Gryffindor.
When he finally did speak, it was one word. “Go.”
“You and me both,” said Draco, surprised at earning a genuine grin from Sirius.
” the cold voice said suddenly, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine.
"Cedric Diggory is staring at you," Draco told Harry the next morning at breakfast.
He cut off abruptly, the whole table going completely silent when Malfoy appeared and sat down right beside Harry.
“Consider Harim. One has to wonder if he, however unintendedly, assumes he lacks the coping skills to abide your particular traumas. So perhaps he occludes not only to keep his memories in his sole possession, but so that he can avoid confronting yours any further than he has already. All the while telling himself his change in tactic is to spite you… It’s speculation, of course this is all speculation, but it is undoubtedly sensical.”
sounded in Harry’s mind, and he found that he could not look away.
“For now.”
Draco sighed. “I was only thinking how long it would be before I stop... catching myself. You know, second guessing if all of this is real.”
The Slytherin seemed to recoil, but Harry must have imagined it. There was no way for shame to have just flashed through those eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then he took Draco's hand. The Slytherin swallowed his gasp of shock. He'd asked, but he may as well have been pissed to of done so. Potter was completely sober, had likely been so all his years. Afraid Potter would change his mind and sit back down, he quickly dragged him onto the floor.
They came to the right door soon enough and the volume of hundreds of people screaming in welcome hit them full force as soon as Harry opened it. Neville had clearly just taken the stage—and was riling up the audience as one did.
“You say that like you aren’t one of them,” Neville said, sounding genuinely confused now. “It doesn’t make sense. Since when would you even care about anyone but yourself? This story would have been a goldmine for you.”
Theo stared at the hands in his lap. “It felt like the truth. And then they tell me
This chapter has been the most difficult to write thus far, purely due to having so much on my plate currently. And also admittedly due in part to Dumbledore being a cryptic little shit who’s very difficult to write for lol. As always, I’d love to know how you guys are feeling.
“I think it’ll take a bit more than a notice-me-not charm to get by trained Aurors,” Draco said.
“And is that really what you want?” Harry said, a bit breathless, needing to be sure.
“That doesn’t matter,” his father waved him off. “If all goes correctly, we’ll practically be heroes.”
"Neville's resourceful," Hermione told them. “But Snape’s potions are quite secure."
“You’re still not speaking to me then?” Harry asked quietly from the entry way later that evening. Blaise’s curtains immediately closed with a flick of his wand. The only other person in their room was Greg, and based on his lack of reaction Harry guessed he already had a silencing charm around him.
No, Draco didn't. But Severus already hated Harry, and the man wasn't an imbecile. He'd know who took it, given that Harry would have to use it in front of everyone during the second task. The only hope they had was if Severus were unable to prove that Harry had stolen it personally, then his hands would be tied. Which forced Draco’s reply, "If we do this, we can't get caught. You can't afford it."
“That’s different,” Draco insisted. He’d dropped Harry’s hand, and his fingers felt cold at the loss. “You know everything about my parents. All I know for certain about your family is that they’re muggles.”
"I—what?"
Anyway, there’s only one more regular chapter before the epilogue! I will probably post those on back to back days. Oh my god. I just can’t believe it’s almost finished. Come cry with me in the comments.
“I honestly didn’t pick up on it until a couple years ago,” Draco admitted.
“You know I switched subdivisions,” she explained. “That alone makes me stand out—it’s expected that Unspeakables remain in the Chamber they initially select upon entry to the Department. There’s never been a rule made that you
ummm 1000+ kudos??? holy shit??? I love you guys ?!??!

the tension bleeding from his friend’s shoulders. This was his element, Harry thought not for the first time. He loved this. And Harry knew personally that Neville hadn’t been certain that he’d get it back.
All four Aurors regarded him questioningly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah?" Harry asked warily after he'd turned to face the taller boy.
Harry sighed, very strongly regretting his attempt at humour. "I'm not going to die," he assured them. "You lot made sure of that today, remember? I'll be able to breathe just fine now. I'll do whatever I've got to do and it'll be alright."
“So. Twenty-five hundred children. Roughly five thousand parents. Add in some single adults, maybe another couple thousand just to be sure we count everyone. We’re somewhere close to ten thousand wizards in North America. Are you with me?”
Andrew Pucey, he recalled. He had a few vague, throw-away memories of the Pucey brothers.
the nature of your original relationship with Draco Malfoy,” she’d asked bluntly, “in your past life?”
“Ooo-kay,” Ayesha said dubiously. She hesitated then, her next words exceedingly careful. “You know you can always talk to me right? About anything that’s going on. I know you’ve got friends, but… I can be here for you too.”
The man, or minion as that’s what he clearly was, spoke then. Though it was less speaking and more chanting, as though the words were some kind of incantation. “
"Who says Potter will have a date?" Blaise asked with clear amusement.
Harry winced, putting his hands up. “Sorry! Parvati let me in, I swear.”
The older man opened his eyes immediately. “Awake at last,” he said after a moment.
She’d already turned back towards the floo without a word.
"Erm. If there was absolutely no consequences, what's the first thing you'd say to Snape?"
Lavender grimaced a bit, and Harry felt another twinge of guilt. But she encouraged him to go on just the same. So Harry sat down, and he told her about the Unspeakables, and some of what he’d been doing for them in exchange for his time with Sheila.
“You were fairly silent in there,” his father observed.
“They really are very pretty, aren’t they?” said Maria.
“Muffliato,” Harry cast; Neville’s expression shifted into a quizzical one.
“And how has that been so far?” she asked lightly, after he’d told her of his decision to move back to his family Manor.
The past few days, the current news had been all about the Death Eater trials. They were a formality, as all but Lucius—and, of course, Snape—would undoubtedly spend the remainder of their days in Azkaban.
This was my favorite chapter, and the one I was most looking forward to. I really hope you guys liked it.
Neville sighed audibly. “I’m never going to be anything, am I?”
“You—
“Right,” Harry said. “But people still watch Quidditch, yeah?”
“Oh, he didn’t,” Theo assured him. “He took it off in front of me once. Wouldn’t of even thought about it again if it weren’t for this.”
This time there was a return of cheering.
“Krum had the most points,” Auror Fleur told him. “It’s the fairest option we’ve got since no one bothered to tell us what we should do at this point.”
“Think he’ll ever come back?” Neville asked, breaking her from her thoughts.
“With great efficiency, as well,” she had confirmed. “Basing off your own accounts, it may even be that some part of Harim is actually occluding relatively constantly, and so experiences a burnout when someone external is actively using legilimency.”
Draco’s grey eyes softened as he remembered the same conversation that Harry was. There was an apology in them—one that Harry didn’t deserve but was immensely grateful to receive regardless. “I hope you know it is.”
“Hm. Not quite,” Harry replied and pulled Draco back down on top of him. Their lips met again and Draco decided that the world could wait just a bit longer.
“So, you’re really just waiting on me,” he finally said. “To get my… mind in order?”
The other two and Draco looked at him in question.
Harry glanced down to see the two boys in question in each other’s faces now, animosity written on every feature. An image of himself and Malfoy arguing flashed through Harry’s mind, and he felt a ridiculous flush begin crawling up the back of his neck, paranoid everyone knew where his subconscious had travelled off to.
"Malfoy," said Harry. His voice sounded strange to his own ears, and he noticed that Malfoy straightened a bit.
He couldn't quite keep up with the range of emotion on Harry's face. But then the brunet said, "That's a really good thing, because I love you too. I would have said it earlier, but I thought it deserved a bit more privacy than we had at that moment, not to mention time for me to snog you properly."
It’s just that most never desire to. We enter with an idea of what we seek to learn, and we dedicate our lives to the pursuit of that knowledge. But, much to the disapproval of my superiors, I felt I had already learnt everything I wanted to about the Mind, and I wanted to pursue something else—highly unusual to my colleagues, as well, of course. To them, there is
"Don't do that," snapped Malfoy.
Neville gave her a small smile and handed her a coffee. “I knew you were up here visiting him and thought you could use that.”
Hermione had quietly stood up and turned to leave, preparing to give them some time and go contact Narcissa, when Draco’s voice stopped her in her tracks.
Edgar bit his lip. “Oh, uh, no, not really. I was only saying that because my big sister is one. She’s–”
“No no,” he insisted quickly. “I mean, yeah. Let’s do all that. I’d like to see everybody. It’s fine.”
Neville just looked at him.
Your excuses about—about James don’t actually excuse you!”
And suddenly Hermione could no longer retain the calm she'd painstakingly clung to since Monday. "You are both insufferable!" she screeched, and Malfoy flinched in surprise. "Only look at each other when the other looks away—how the bloody hell do you even
Draco wanted badly to glance over the stone that blocked him from sight, but he knew doing so would be profoundly idiotic. He listened as closely as possible, trying to make out anything that would give him a clue as to what was happening to the Auror. Mostly, it was all laboured breathing.
. It was impossible, ridiculous, absolutely mad that everyone had managed to ignore something so blatantly obvious.
"And don't forget it," he said smugly.
The blond was rounding the corner by the time she caught sight of him, and Hermione broke into a run. She caught up with Malfoy half way to the dungeons. Out of breath and irritated, she grabbed his arm and yanked, effectively halting him in place. He rounded on her, knowing full well who'd been following him, that hateful sneer he'd obviously perfected on his face.
The Slytherin blinked. "What? What about Potter?"
Harry had only had to check three other places before he eventually found Neville at Lewis & Williams, a popular wizarding club for elites. In his timeline, Harry had been invited to patron on no less than fifteen separate occasions since the end of the war. But now, as a non-celebrity, the front staff only eyed him with calculation and informed him he was not allowed in. In response, Harry had handed over a ridiculous amount of galleons with a tight smile, for which they’d looked the other way while he’d slipped inside.
“Everything alright?” she asked slowly. “Who’s it from?”
Somehow, Lucius stood over them in the next minute. The man dropped to his knees, placed his wand against Draco’s temple and murmured another spell Harry had never heard. But it hardly mattered, because Draco did not stir.
Neville rolled his eyes, not moving from his position. “He said that I’m going to be forgotten. I wasn’t talented enough to maintain what we had going, and I ought to be working on my backup plan for once we ran out of C grade hits. Isn’t that what’s happening now?”
Harry stood completely still, cheeks flooding red with the mortification of immediate understanding.
Snape’s lip had curled up so far that Harry could see his gums even from where he sat. “That is
It was honest. Even if he didn’t know anything more than that.
to date him?”
“My new friends call me Lev,” he told the crowd conversationally. “Think you can all do that for me?”
In any case, on with the show.
It was Draco’s turn to sigh. “Dumbledore doesn’t think me tagging along is a very good idea.”
For a moment, Sheila looked confused. Then she seemed to understand, and her face smoothed.
“It was Mr.

“I wonder how long it will take,” Draco murmured.
Draco's look said he was both exasperated and entertained. "You were scared then, of losing ickle old me?"
“Don’t even
“Sunday.”
Please note: my estimate from before was definitely off. There is still so much to get to! Basically I’m going to just stop estimating and strap in. If we cross 100k, I hope no one has an issue with that...
"Fancy you?" Malfoy supplied.
Ayesha eventually took the glasses back, and Remus joined them.
“And your dad knew that, by the way,” continued the Gryffindor, determined to have it all out on the table. “He knew that and he followed him anyway. Worshipped him. Threw his entire life and you, his family, away for him, didn’t he. Someone who, based on what you were just saying, was less than him. But he wasn’t, was he? Because magic doesn’t favour based on blood. Your magic isn’t stronger than mine because you’re a pureblood and I’m not, is it? You say we’re gods because we have magic, but then you pretend like it’s up to you or anyone else to decide who deserves their magic and who doesn’t.”
Something unidentifiable flashed through Malfoy’s eyes at that, but it was gone in the next blink. Then he closed his notebook with a dull slap, tossing it beside him and straightening.
Hermione giggled like a loon, positively giddy with relief. "I'm glad that Viktor has himself sorted and won't tell me a thing, otherwise I would feel guilty."
“Potter.”
Neville put his face in his hands, and Harry waited. “I think someone got a photo,” he said finally. “I’d like to believe it was just of a kiss but...  I can’t believe how stupid I am.”
"Hey—Harry!" A voice called before he'd even rounded the first corner. Harry knew it was unreasonable to think Cedric could have heard the horribly awkward conversation he'd been the subject of at the Slytherin table, but Harry could also sometimes be the paranoid sort.
“Anywhere!” yelled the blond. “You could have gone anywhere! The entire wizarding world would’ve given the skin off their backs to raise you after what you did! Instead you got dropped with those wretches who—gods Harry. You slept in a bleeding cupboard!”
Harry did not wait long before a cry of “PEEVES!” rang through the space. The following minutes were some of the most anxious and stress inducing of Harry’s life. In the end, Moody had managed to just save him from being discovered by the likes of Snape and gotten rid of Filch. Harry was freed of the trick step and given his egg, though Moody had wanted to borrow the Map. Harry hadn’t had much of a choice but to agree. He wasn’t too upset though, since things could have ended a lot worse. Not to mention everything Moody had said when Harry’d pointed out the strange things that had gone on this year had given him quite a bit to consider.
Harry gave her a grateful look. “I’ve got Transfiguration first, with professor Siskin. History with Hanson, second. Then Magical Creatures with Clark right before lunch.”
“So you can save your bloody sob story about how you’re responsible so naturally you had to destroy every bit of good left in your life afterwards. You

, or trying to, but she still could not quite relax here as Harry seemed able to.
Quietly, Draco’s mum left the room. The white haired wizard conjured a chair next to Harry’s and sat down in it without speaking. Then he reached over and placed something in Harry’s lap.
Draco swallowed. “Er—”
Hermione would marry Viktor soon. In just minutes, in fact. There weren’t too many people here to witness it. They hadn’t wanted to risk the press making an appearance, so the guest list had been narrowed down to family and closest friends. One of which had just opened the door and shut it softly behind him.
He’d known immediately that it was the right decision to leave, and the hours he’d since spent packing up and clearing out had brought a sense of acute relief. It was almost as if Harim was actively encouraging him, for once.
“So, what you’re telling me is that you’ve not only known where a
"Sod off," Harry said, and left Malfoy standing in the hallway.
“Hm,” she said, slotting her arm through his own as they all walked back.
"Honestly Ronald," Hermione chided, "do close your mouth."
“Sir,” said Malfoy to the elder man’s back, “I don’t understand why nothing’s being done.”
Something must have gone horribly wrong—or right, if one shared Harry’s point of view that is. This Voldemort couldn’t possibly be a real threat; he didn’t even look capable of doing magic.
It took some convincing to get him to drink from the glass, Merlin knew why, but he did soon enough.
her pawn,” Harry hissed, familiar hatred rushing through him with such ferocity he felt almost lightheaded.
“What the fuck was that?!” she demanded.
Theo blinked. “You woke me up to say hey?”
“You want what?” Weasley said.
Harry sighed. "Dare."
“Huh?” he replied, remembering Joshua had said something to him.
“Lucius is correct,” Snape said after a moment. “With the Tournament in play, there is a clear time-table to work with. Without it the Dark Lord may become... unpredictable. Potter could potentially be at even greater risk.”
I don’t think. Because of my mum, I mean.”
The hug was so incredibly awkward that Harry nearly pulled away immediately. Except that in the same moment, pale forearms came to cautiously rest against Harry’s sides, hands momentarily locking behind his back.
“Just think it’s a bit rich you’d start caring
since you seem to have disregarded that as well. Your father was killed, but not
To his horror, Harry could feel his eyes beginning to prickle with tears. “It’s good to see you, too,” he finally managed to croak. Ayesha and Remus gave him twin looks of concern.
He narrowed his eyes at her. “There?”
Harry’s scar had hurt before, but never anything close to this. Vaguely, he could hear Auror Reid’s voice yelling for help, but the pain was too much for him to focus on the words. He must have collapsed only a handful of seconds ago, but it felt like years. After several moments, when the agony had receded enough to allow him to think properly, he forced himself up, doing his best to ignore the remaining sting.
"The highest compliment," proclaimed the blond. Draco leant down to kiss him quickly then, but that was a lost cause. It was never quick, because once they started in, they had trouble stopping. It was why Rita Skeeter—the cow—had had plenty of images to splash across her articles day in and day out for those first couple of weeks before the novelty had worn. And alone in Draco's dorm room, it was even harder. Five minutes at least had gone by before Draco finally left.
Nearly everyone politely ignored Neville’s violent blush, but Pansy released a short cackle seemingly before she could stop herself. “Your turn Neville,” she reminded him joyfully.
It would be a long time before Harry left that day.
Blaise grinned wickedly. “Why, it’s because he’s secretly in love with me, of course. Right Nev?”
Harry didn’t miss the way her eyes rolled before he turned, and he just barely kept his chin up. He led them along in awkward silence for a few moments before he heard an aggressive sigh—and then Draco’s hand was grasping his own.
“It’s not as bad as you think,” Hermione said.
produce answers.
Harry had, like with everyone else, given her a second chance at life. Unintended, but a consequence of his actions nonetheless. If she had proven herself an even somewhat acceptable person, he might’ve found the strength to leave her be. But here was the proof she was certainly not. And that was all he needed.
Draco blinked at Harry in surprise, clearly demanding more of an explanation. Finally, the brunet took a deep breath. “I snapped,” he admitted. “I’d just found out that it was his Dad that cursed you and then—”
“Harry!” Ron called as soon as he’d come into the common room. Then his brows furrowed in confusion. “What’re you doing here, mate?”
Harry stood up, wishing Neville a quick farewell before heading towards the exit. Lavender stormed after him, her heels clacking loudly against the floor. He had half a mind to avoid the coming confrontation entirely and apparate away before she could catch up to him, but he knew that was only a delay. And besides, he needed all the information he could get at the moment. So once he reached the pavement outside, he slowed and allowed her to grab his arm and yank him around.
"It's true," Pansy assured them all. "No one was looking anywhere but at Snape. I still can't believe none of you let me in on the plan, though," she huffed.
Hermione smirked. "I'm sure he will."
“Or not,” she was swift to add. “We could just visit Remus here more. Amjad would be happy, and I’m sure Dumbledore doesn’t mind.”
A minute later, she sat down on the sofa, and Harry felt warm at how much lighter she seemed compared to when she’d first come in.
“You know, we used to be friends,” Neville said wistfully. “Me and the guys. They welcomed me right in, just after I’d finished Hogwarts. Said with me at the mic, they’d finally make it big.”
“Sorry,” he said sheepishly.
Today, however, Hermione had brought different news. Peter, who had been until now unconscious and recovering from his brush with death, had woken up. According to Hermione, he’d been immediately dosed with Veritaserum and questioned extensively. The ministry, as a result, was now working to locate Sirius, encouraging him to come out of hiding with the promise of being absolved of all charges. It had only been a few hours, however, so he hadn’t yet shown up. Harry didn’t know how long it would be before he would.
Harry and Neville had sat up the night after their meeting with Barbara to select the tracks—a healthy mix of Alternative and Pop music, so that he could build an audience from having a wider sound range. On top of that, Harry had already listened to this performance during rehearsal, and he’d already known how talented Neville was, of course.
in the space of one week.
"How sweet," Blaise teased from behind him. "Watching him sleep, gods the great Harry Potter is a sap."
“So… you hate muggles and muggleborns because you’re afraid of them.”
“You’re my dad.”
“All right,” Harry accepted, stealing Draco's hand back just shy of desperately. The blond smiled again, squeezing, and their companions seemed to relax.
"We know darling," Pansy said, thinking it was relatively safe to speak again. "We feel for you, really. But Potter's more than oblivious isn't he? He probably thinks you were having him on, given your history I'm not sure you can blame him."
"Huh? Oh, yes I'm fine Ronald."
Lavender looked away. “What happened,” she said, her voice now flat.
badge was conspicuously absent from Malfoy's person.
I’ve finally linked the music below :)
“Then explain it to me, Harry. You know that’s all you have to do.”
“Do you think Ron will propose?” Harry asked his husband later that night. They’d returned to their flat in London about an hour ago. It was the early hours, and Harry lay on their sofa with his legs across the blond’s lap.
Long moments crawled by before Malfoy calmly said, “You’re finished?”
"Like erm–together? We're together, yeah?"
"I do believe that's
Suddenly fed up, Harry stood from his mattress and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s bed curtains, immediately tossing them aside unthinkingly. It wasn’t until after the fact that he realised that the blond might not of been decent, and firmly pushed the wandering thought from his mind in the same instant.
Harry shrugged. He was more worried about where Snape was leading Draco than about what the bloody
Most everyone came and went, but Harry and Draco’s mum were practically permanent fixtures here since Draco was brought in. Hermione showed up often enough to bring news and make sure they’d both eaten, occasionally bringing Viktor in tow while he was still in England. Having the most points had indeed left him with the Triwizard cup, and now the Durmstrang student had enough money to travel on his own, allowing him to remain with Hermione for a few extra weeks. He never showed any less concern than Hermione when it came to any of her friends, always asking after Draco’s current status and how everyone was holding up.
Harry nodded carefully. “I did. She believed me, and because of her I’m… getting some help.”
"How pissed are you, exactly?" Harry asked slowly.
“Thankfully it’s not up to you,” Draco told him with a shake of his head, and then turned to fix every adult in the room with a look of ice. “You’ll
Draco laughed, it was a startling but welcome sound that made the Slytherin seem even more human. She smiled wryly at him and went to leave.
Draco.”
“You were one of Skeeter’s little rats,” she said testily. “You’ve some nerve showing up to a Holly’s doorstep after you wrote that shite about Angie and Coach.”
Ron stood up then, walking over to get in Harry's face. "How long?" he demanded.
. Instead, he said "So, in other words, I'm the reason you are without a date?"
Hermione sat down next to Ron, who hardly breathed a word to her these days, and began working as if nothing was going on. Neville did the same, only he always looked nervous in Potions, so nothing with him would seem amiss. Blaise looked relaxed as ever. Harry breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth, giving nothing away as Snape began to explain today's potion. Harry hardly heard a word of it, and it wouldn't matter seeing as the entire goal this period was to brew the potion wrong and make the greatest mess possible.
Later, when the embarrassing tears had dried on his face and he lay with his head in Pansy’s lap, he realized that his friends probably had no idea what he and Harry were fighting about. Blaise and Greg had clearly heard enough to put it all together, but they couldn’t know all the specifics. And Pansy had to know less than nothing. Yet they’d been here for him anyway. He thought of Harry—not that he’d stopped—and hoped, despite his hurt and anger, that Hermione and Weasley were doing the same.
“I think I need direct,” Harry responded, his voice small.
about saying ‘good thing,’” Draco warned.
loved
"Yeah," Blaise added. "Don't be so clingy. Clingy is never good."
The blond put a hand on her shoulder and gently turned her so that she was facing him. She looked up into his unusually serious grey eyes.
“Are you nervous?” the blond asked her gently.
“Everyone was paired off right away—me and Cel were a no brainer. I guess they thought it would make a difference if no one was ever on their own,” Cosima told him. “Didn’t matter. Emily Hernandez was next. Showed back up on Christmas, just like always.”
“I would appreciate that, thanks.”
Unfortunately, it was like Harry had somehow heard his thoughts. “Wait,” he said, and Draco resisted the urge to kick him. “I don’t want people risking their lives for me while I just sit and hide somewhere.”
"Oh thank Merlin," Hermione's voice cut in from behind Harry. They both turned to face her, startled. She beamed at them. "I worried you'd never get over yourself," she told Ron.
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "How long what?"
“Why wouldn’t we?” Daphne wondered, seeming genuinely baffled. “It’s a free concert.”
“Might I ask what your argument was about?” said the man.
. “The afternoon’s ruined anyway. I’m for tea.”
“How do you even
It was some minutes before she pulled away, clearing her throat. Still, she seemed to be cautiously hopeful as she was leaving. Harry thought that maybe fixing things wasn’t so impossible a task after all.
“I mean it. We’ll have to figure it out. If they can find somewhere to hide me away from my dad then they can surely find somewhere for you. Alright?”
“Friends again for two minutes and already excluding the rest of us from your conversations,” Celine lamented, a hand coming up to rest on her forehead like someone swooning.
It’d been nearly two years since the last time Harry had seen Ginny, and the time had an effect, but it was overshadowed by the less subtle differences. Her curtain of fiery orange locks was missing, for one—hair instead cut into a pixie look that curled gently around her ears. It heightened her somehow, bringing out the angles of her face and lending more maturity. She looked feminine and entirely comfortable, and it made her seem, to Harry, even more a stranger than when last he’d seen her.
Finally, Harry said, “Because, if so, that means you must think you were a better wizard than Voldemort.”
But Harry had not gotten the impression it had ever been a place to entertain.
the gillyweed?"
Eventually Neville did, and Harry did both, and everyone laughed uproariously—themselves included.
“Are you staying?” Draco asked into his ear. Harry almost shivered, but thankfully caught himself. “Or do you have to go back there?”
Disbelief coursing through him, he turned towards where he thought he’d seen blond and was met with the sight of none other than Draco Lucius Malfoy. He was hovering over someone on the ground, but he looked up when he felt Harry’s gaze.
Lavender regarded him for long moments, clearly intending to be unfeeling but not altogether managing it. Harry swallowed against his guilt. It wasn’t his fault, he told himself.
“No, Averie is douche’s little sister,” Joshua corrected. “But it doesn’t matter what Matt does anyway, I’m too good, so I’m not going anywhere.”
"Practically livid. Oh he's giving me quite the spectacular death glare now, you should see it." Harry thought Malfoy sounded entirely too delighted about this to be sane.
"Suppose that's fair," said Malfoy a moment later. Harry's mind whirled. Surely Draco Malfoy did not admit his own faults.
killed our father!
"Oh, you know. I'm disgusting, a stain on the family name, so on and so forth."
“I won’t.”
about it."
“What took you so long, Matt?” Not Harry asked.
Hermione Granger stood in front of a full length mirror, looking at her simple gown with a mix of wonder and adoration. It was the same long sleeved, lace white dress that her mother had worn to marry her father.
The Slytherin stared at him for a long moment before he finally spoke. “Me, I suppose.” The words were quiet and uncertain, enough that it made Harry’s heart beat faster.
“Hm?”
“Because they—I appreciate what I have now. In a way that no one can understand,” Draco explained. “What I went through made me stronger. I can’t just let someone obliviate all of that away.”
That was all it said. Hermione assured him that it didn’t mean anything and that everything would be fine, but Harry wasn’t so sure. Regardless, he did as she suggested and sent back a reply straight away with the date. For now, though, Harry would simply have to put Sirius and everything they needed to discuss out of his mind.
She fixed him with a look. “I believe it would help–”
she asked. Jacqueline grinned at her.
"Didn't you know I had one?"
As if Harry could just do that!

Harry looked dejected and guilty. “I’m sorry.”
Draco sputtered a little at this but clearly couldn’t deny it, or form any response at all by the looks of it. He cleared his throat and adjusted his seating position just a fraction. Hermione refused to overanalyse
The Aurors who were taking place of Cedric, Fleur and Viktor had already transformed. When Harry had thought to ask, Scrimgeour—the somewhat intimidating Head Auror—had told him that the other Champions had been slipped a strong sleeping potion during dinner last night and secured elsewhere.
with Harry Potter. You must be touched in the head, Granger. I hate that four eyed—"
Harry shrugged. “I mean, that’s the gist of it, honestly. I was kind of a wanker the last time we talked. I actually came to apologise.”
“Alright,”
The Slytherin nodded, breathing out in relief. He shook his head, then, as though clearing it. “You’re not going back.”
Narcissa Malfoy stood, unmoving, as she stared at her husband with blatant disgust. “Harry Potter will die,” she repeated, incredulous that Lucius then had the audacity to nod.
“Do you recall earlier this year, when your scar began to hurt in class and you came to see me?”
Not minutes later, they were pulled back. “Harry what’s—” Hermione broke off when she caught his expression. “Oh.”
Draco’s pale brows drew together. “Why do you think they hate you?”
“Draco please,” he begged, ready to go to his knees. “I never lied. I swear I didn’t try to—it wasn’t some kind of trick. I didn’t even know that that was what you assumed until just now. There
Hermione and Harry, despite everything, couldn’t help but laugh.
Harry wanted to ask all at once, so desperately. Instead he said, “I hate knowing you were hurt.”
Things continued on much the way Maria said they would. Someone seemed to exit the field no less than every five minutes. Thankfully, for first tryouts, nothing actually exploded. Harry might’ve gone deaf if there had been. Of the original roughly two hundred plus players that had come to try out, only about fifteen or so from each House were left. He could only imagine how intense things were going to become the following day, and certainly understood why Maria was so anxious for Wednesday.
“Do you know how many muggles live in North America right now, Potter?”
“Part of me knows that you’re being this way because you’re scared I’m going to get myself hurt,” Harry whispered. “I mean, you told me that. But this other part of me doesn’t feel like that.” He stopped, trying to get a grip on himself so he wouldn’t cause a scene in the middle of Potions. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to take points from him for daring to show emotion, seconds left in class or no.
He could only pray he’d not lose the second chance Draco had given him over the truth.
Later, Harry would wonder what possessed him to do it, would try in vain to find some way to explain the way he must have taken complete leave of his senses. Because, for some unnamable reason, he’d actually, willingly reached out and wrapped his arms around Draco Malfoy.
It was very difficult not to panic, but he knew Draco would want him to keep his head. He tried not to pay mind to the merpeople around him, or what they might do when his time was truly up. Still, he kicked and swam despite his burning lungs and exhausted limbs. Just when he thought he might black out, his head at last broke the surface.
Parvati stood on the threshold of Lavender’s flat, clearly surprised to find he’d been the one knocking later on that evening. But she didn’t look visibly upset at the sight of him. Lavender must not have verbally shredded him too harshly—or so he hoped, at least.
“She was taken,” explained Cosima. “She’s gone.”
"Panse," Draco hissed through his teeth. The Slytherin housemates closest to them were smirking or giggling.
“Why you hate muggles, why you think purebloods are so much better than everybody else. Why you thought Voldemort was some kind of saviour to wizard kind,” Harry ticked each one off on his fingers. “If you can convince me, I’ll leave you alone for good.”
The actual reason chose that moment to stroll into the living space and seat himself on Neville’s knee. “You lot are missing all the fun sitting around here talking,” Blaise informed them.
“You didn’t tell m–” started Malfoy.
"Is that an invisibility cloak?" Theo demanded once he'd regained himself.
Harry flinched, Lavender’s words shredding him. He didn’t accept it, though, not completely. They couldn’t know if she was right, he determined. It had to be more complicated than that. “She was—she’s still my best friend,” he told her, his jaw tight.
“Your mom’s a cold hearted bitch, Cel,” said Maria. “You’ve known that for years.”
For the next unbelievably nerve-wrecking couple of hours, Draco did his best. Time seemed to pass strangely, though he thought it may have just been the stress. The only real means he had of knowing approximately how much time had passed was when the woman would open a pouch on her hip and drink what must have been Polyjuice from a flask.
Harry made a noncommittal noise, hoping that Draco would let the topic drop. But he had no such luck.
Lucius, likely realising his mistake, remained carefully blank. “Pardon?”
Narcissa Malfoy crossed the floor in a flash and slapped her husband across the face. “Don’t you dare lie to me you
“Of course we did. You won didn’t you?” she teased. Amjad rolled his eyes, but he didn’t stop beaming until Harry and Ayesha had to leave.
“Imagine if that spell went mainstream, eh. You might be out of a job.”
“It’s not been that long, Lav,” Harry reminded her, nevermind how long it felt when he thought it all over.
“I don’t know what you want me to say!” Malfoy exploded. “I’m not going to sit and tell you everything you’d like to hear. I’m certainly not going to
“Ah, I see the issue,” she said. “My colleagues have led you to believe that you’re here to accomplish something of grave importance, yes?”
“You were a
"Oh for the love of—" Harry cut himself off by firmly pressing his lips to the blond's.
“You mean you’re where you want to be
. He didn’t even look nervous, Neville even thought he looked like he was having a grand time.
"Not like that!" Harry insisted, attempting to calm his boyfriend. Draco's stormy expression, unfortunately, didn't ease. Pansy had clearly been serious about Draco being the jealous type. Harry thought perhaps he could have worded his statement a bit better. "I mean it, it wasn't at all like that. It's
"Um sure. Pansy?"
“Of course you are, Sirius,” Hermione said. “We didn’t mean it like—”
“Me?”
Neville himself lay next to him, his hand lightly tapping along to the music streaming from his sound speakers.
Neville looked crestfallen. “You don’t think it’s too late already?”
A long stretch of a moment later Draco nodded once, and some of the stiffness left his shoulders.
So, as some of you already know, I didn’t originally intend for Harry’s career path, or really Neville himself for that matter, to take on quite the size role that is now currently the case. By the time I realized this was more important (for pacing, connecting events, etc.) than I had assumed, it was kind of too late in the process to prioritize accuracy highly in that respect. So I kind of do the best I can, as you can see. All in all, if that whole business in this chapter came off as pure nonsense, I’m sorry. I tried. If it doesn’t phase you: thank goodness.
“This is what we’ve been working for Cissa,” he told her with horrible excitement. “The Dark Lord will return, and once he rises to power we will stand by his side. Our family name will once again command the respect we’ve been denied for years.”
"In a couple days I might be a while dead," Harry joked, smiling until Draco went still.
Which was how Harry ended up here, in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione blinking rapidly once he finished recounting the events of a half hour ago. She had the oddest look on her face. "I believe Malfoy, uh, asked you to the Ball."
A stab of fear hit Draco when he thought of the Mark on Severus’s arm, on his father’s arm. What was the last thing he had said to his father?
“Go with him.”
Malfoy snorted. “She just didn’t know where I was, wanted to meet up like we usually do. Then she decided that I was busy, because she doesn’t like you.”
The door swung closed again and Draco turned back to face her. “You deserve every bit of happiness in store for you today, love.”
“You’re talented, Neville. You could make it on your own. You just have to decide you want to try, and then go for it. Don’t let your so-called friends or your dickwad of an ex be the reason you miss the chance.”
"The meaning of what Professor?" Draco asked sweetly, his rebellious side returning in response to his godfather’s tone.
"All my life I suspect, but you'll have to forgive me for not figuring it out sooner, seeing as I'm fourteen and all," said Harry.
"No way!" Harry tried to say, but only bubbles issued from his mouth.
“Who’s the one with the best chance of nicking it? Or who would do it without asking too many questions?”
Maybe, in some ways, he was. And maybe, he thought, that was okay.
“Awesome!” he yelled. “Let’s get started then, huh?!”
“Are you so blinded by hatred and the promise of power that you would choose it over your own family?” Narcissa demanded coldly.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose. “I hate them because they don’t deserve our fear. Because we may as well be gods in comparison to them, but we cower like sewer rats so as not to risk extinction. I hate them because they have no right, but they outnumber us so vastly we’ve no other choice.”
“Narcissa,” Dumbledore replied, perfectly polite. “I do wish it were under better circumstances.”
Harry looked back and forth between them in bewilderment. “Why hasn’t there been an announcement? Or… a lock down of some sort until she’s found?”
thing to do, and Draco clearly thought so too if the amusement in his slate eyes was any indication. He didn’t comment, though, only waited.
Draco smirked. "Didn't you?"
“And maybe it’s not different at all,” Ron replied. “We break up for all the same reasons every time.”
The blond relaxed again. There was nothing to be done about it anyway, since Draco didn’t much care for the thought of obliviating all of his friends.
The gardens were beautiful and vast, and Harry almost had to resist the urge to ooh and aah with the first time visitors. This was, after all, his family’s estate. Looking out at the endless coloured rows and clusters of all breeds of flower and plant should offer nothing new for him.
Ron nodded slightly, rubbing the back of his neck. "Yeah, I sort of figured that actually. Weird to hear you say it just like that though. Not bad weird!" He hurried to correct. "Just... weird."
"Right, uh. I dare you to... go stand at the top of the Astronomy tower and sing the Hogwarts song as loud as you can."
friend, Lavender,” he pointed out. “Not mine.”
I hope the story flow all ends up making sense and working for you guys once you have the next chap!
“My job’s done,” Harry answered back, perhaps a bit shaky. “I’m gonna watch with you if that’s alright.”
Draco nodded seriously, but his relief still shone in his bright grey eyes. "Yeah, good thing. Anyway I knew you'd be here and you were closer so I thought I'd come share, but I really should go tell Harry."
“Who’s Slytherin’s Head of House?” he asked aloud, thoughtlessly. Both Remus and Ayesha turned to give him matching quizzical looks.
Cosima looked down at the wand in her hand, mournful. “I’m no-maj born,” she said quietly. “You’d think that would make it better, easier somehow. I mean, Cel’s pureblood. One of very few like
“I just can’t look at him right now, alright?” he said. “I just can’t.”
"Anything I can do to help?"
“I’ll see you out there.”
“Mate,” Neville went on, clearly addressing him even though his eyes were on the crowd. “I think
“You woke up and you couldn’t do magic anymore,” Harry said, giving voice to it as he couldn’t believe it otherwise.
“What did she say?” Harry asked. “Did I do something to her?”
The Healers had told Hermione over and over again that Draco couldn’t actually hear anything anyone said to him while comatose. Talking to him had just become sort of therapeutic. If he could really hear her now, it had to mean he was waking up.
That was the first time he thought to ask. He leaned over so Ayesha would hear him above the crowd. “Hey, who’s he playing against?”
He put both his hands up, palms open.
Over two months after the battle, Hermione Granger could be found sitting in what might as well have been known as “Harry’s chair.”
“The pair thing stuck, though, like it gave everyone some kinda comfort that the staff was at least doing
"When did you fall for Harry Potter?"
Not even a hundred kids showed up to try for Quidditch, and the stands were more empty than not. Still, Harry was thrilled. After all, Malfoy was right when he’d said less kids meant more chance of making the team. Not that Harry had any doubts.
family think he’d gone mad if he could manage. But if he couldn’t, well… He looked at Hermione a touch desperately. “Right. If I could speak to you, erm, privately, just for a few minutes…? Please.”
The dark skinned boy gave a wicked grin and nodded.
“Wait,” Harry cut in, “what’s happened to her?”
Not Fleur mentally assured him
Lavender blinked. “Okay, first of all, you didn’t tell me she invited you to her
She’d merely ignored his tone. “Not that there is a precedent to go by, but I’d imagine anyone who proves capable of performing occlumency against a second occupant of their very own mind would be considered talented indeed.”
“Barely got away,” Neville agreed breathlessly. “But Merlin, you lot should have seen Blaise. The
He, of course, didn’t actually make it very far before the three caught up to him.
“Shouldn’t it be Krum then?” Not Fleur said. “He had the most points going in. It’s only fair.”
The Slytherin scoffed. “Please, like I’m going to set myself up to lose to you again. No, I’m going for Chaser, so you had better be on your game, Potter. I’d quite like to start winning matches.”
before that could even be possible. You understand that, don’t you?”
"You think it was a
They found themselves on the ground within seconds, Harry must’ve followed Malfoy down, now rolling and kicking and hitting everywhere that could be reached. Magical means had been entirely set aside in favour of baser instincts. This made sense, Harry thought even through his haze of dark anger. This was familiar territory, fighting with Malfoy instead of playing nice with him. The violence almost felt like being back home, Malfoy hollering obscenities and trying to throw Harry off where he had him pinned, throwing punch after punch.  It wasn’t all that long before they were roughly pried apart by an invisible force and held there, an absolutely livid Professor Clark pointing her wand at them.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled the green eyed boy toward him again. He lightly brushed his lips over the Gryffindor's, more a ghost of a kiss than anything. "You can be sure," he whispered. "Especially these next few days, promise me you'll be sure."
It was all she could do to keep her tears from spilling over. Not trusting her voice anymore, she nodded.
Harry all too happily did as he was told, just as horrified by the sound as he was the first time he'd tried to open it. It was why he'd wanted to put this off in the first place. But Draco had brought up the second task a few days ago, worried about its' fast approaching.
"You really are pissed," Harry breathed, but then he recovered himself. "My Hippogriff—"
loved
At four in the afternoon he found Theo, predictably, sleeping. It wasn’t as though waking him up was something he’d never done before, and for far less important reasons. Draco shook the other boy’s shoulder until he groaned irritably and opened his eyes.
Ron raised an eyebrow at Harry from where he sat on a moved armchair, by the looks of it waiting on Percy to decide his next move in their nearly-finished chess match.
Harry raised an eyebrow before he could stop himself. That had been a very
"Mr. Malfoy," Snape said, interrupting Draco's meal and therefore his staring-at-Harry time.
spit Harry. “Shouldn’t be surprised, you’ve never given a toss about anything that wasn’t about
But none of this changed the fact that he had not confronted
Malfoy scoffed. "Why should I waste my time talking to a—"
Which was how Hermione returned to the Slytherin dungeons with Luna and Neville both in tow.
“Oh Merlin,” Draco breathed.
“I think I’ll dare you to put on some makeup. I’m a bit curious how you would look, you see.”
The last thing Harry wanted to discuss was the row he’d just had with Draco. He held up his hand against any questions and headed toward his room. Seamus looked up when he came in, and Harry pretended not to notice his surprise. He simply went over to the bed he’d not slept in for weeks and closed his curtains.
The cheers were deafening, and he struggled to remain afloat as he gasped endlessly for air.
“Wasn’t planning to, actually.”
The following scream was terrible, and Draco’s back straightened so tightly that his body jolted. The Auror by his side gripped her wand tightly, much like Draco was doing. Then, before he had time to even fear for her, she peered very quickly over the edge, and then breathed out very long and slow in obvious relief. The scream had been the servant’s then. For a moment, Draco pitied the unknown man.
Harry nodded, doing his best to pay attention after that and allowing the thought that he’d soon be let outdoors to serve as encouragement. Professor Clark had said to meet near the Founders Statues, where she’d then be leading them into some adjacent woods on the grounds for the lesson. Harry wasn’t sure what sort of creature to expect, but he was looking forward to being beyond the castle walls nonetheless.
And just like that, the game was back on. Hermione wasn't sure how long it lasted, or when she had fallen asleep. But the next thing she was aware of was a hand shaking her shoulder and Draco's voice saying "Hermione, come on get up. Breakfast's nearly over."
He was nearly out of his seat when Pansy reached out and yanked him back down. "Jealousy isn't cute on you, dear," she chastised. "Diggory may be fit, but you've got to have some trust that Harry chose you."
Draco glanced at Auror Fleur in fear, worried for the Auror who was wearing Harry’s face. She appeared to be forming words with her lips. After a moment, Draco realised in horror that she had mouthed
And Harry Potter was looking at him like he loved him.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "This is my dorm as well, so either go find somewhere else to be sickeningly in love, or go to
In any case, Parvati had been right. It wasn’t twenty minutes later that the floo flared up and Lavender came through. She didn’t notice him immediately, heading straight to the kitchen and setting her purse on the island.
Draco tossed his head back and laughed then, it was a full and rather mesmerising sound that Harry immediately wanted to hear again. The thought made him feel so ridiculous he nearly blushed.
"Harry," she said, earning an eyebrow raise from each Slytherin.
“I have to admit,” Draco told him over the music, “I thought at least some of it was… the technology they use? That computer magic to change voices. But he’s actually good.”
,” Blaise told her. “Why say yes to
“No one got in my head,” Harry defended. “I just woke up and realised that it was wrong.”
me. Had to fend ’em off. None of you lot saw anyone?”
Harry knew it was a bit ridiculous to feel guilty, as this was all to do with Voldemort and not him, but he still regretted taking this opportunity away from the other three. Harry’d never wanted to be a part of the Tournament in the first place, but the others had.
“Aren’t I always?”
"A riddle, I'm good with riddles. What is it though?" He sounded quite relieved, and Harry was glad he hadn't waited until morning to come if it put Draco a bit more at ease. Still, he’d already decided that everything else could wait. All he really wanted right now was to lie down next to Draco.
Weird time to post, maybe. But honestly as soon as I got the go-ahead from my beta I just wanted this up. So here it is! *hides*
Harry had taken one look at the calendar that morning and fallen into an understandably dark mood, as was the trend for years now. It wasn’t long after that he noticed Harim had made himself quite deliberately scarce.
Draco glanced at Dumbledore, praying that the old wizard wouldn’t actually consider the question. It seemed the opposite was true, as he actually looked somewhat angered. But Harry had already latched on.
“Your room.”
He struggled against the arms that held him away, but they only laughed at him. When Cedric suddenly appeared, a giant bubble around his head, Harry was immensely relieved.
"It wasn't necessary, Panse," Draco said. "You would have just been one more nervous person who might've given me away before I made it back."
Some part of his brain was reminding him he should probably be very suspicious about now, but he—strangely—wasn't, and that seemed alarming in itself.
“What if I mess it up?” she finally asked. “Viktor’s family has never been all that supportive of us. And his fame... it can be so much sometimes.”
The other three glanced at each other, as if open discussion had never been a second thought to cross their minds. Draco sighed and continued walking; they had classes to interrupt.
Theo looked at him like he’d just asked what colour the sky was. “You’re a bloody
Sheila sighed. “Let’s try something different,” she suggested patiently. “I’d like to see if perhaps I could talk to him—Harim, as you refer to him as.”
“It’s not like that!” Neville exploded, and then looked around in momentary horror before realising he, in fact, couldn’t be heard. He took a deep breath. “They have an open marriage, okay? Kelsey’s known about us all along and she doesn’t care because now Blaise’s dad is dead they’re going to get a divorce as soon as their marriage contract is up, anyway. Seven months. I’m not some side piece. He loves me.”
Maria nodded. “Totally.”
For a moment, all he could see was a sixteen year old boy. One that was crying. Anxious. Terribly afraid and turning to lash out with the brand of astounding violence he’d been raised on.
"You've no idea," Malfoy sighed.
“I can’t believe I missed that,” Lavender pouted, though her eyes were sly. “Surely you know you’ll have to take your real friends out now.”
Parvati gave him a sympathetic look. “She should be back soon. I can clear out for a bit if you like?”
The ginger smiled and left him standing there. It was the sound of voices coming around the corner that finally snapped Draco out of his state, and he threw the cloak around himself hastily. He tried not to feel too proud of himself when the group of Gryffindors passed right by him, oblivious.
Happy Monday you guys! I’ll be completely honest: I have been so nervous about posting this particular chapter. It has undergone more revising at than I think any previous chapter, because I just haven’t been able to stop anxiously picking at it for some strange reason. (Also, it’s quite long, fair warning.) So I’m almost relieved to finally be posting!
Emerald eyes widened and settled back on Draco. “You did? That’s great! What’d she say?”
Relief flooded Draco all at once, even as—amidst continual sobs and moans—a sinister, yet still blessedly frail voice said, “Robe me.”
And just like that, everyone was scurrying away.
And he hated how much that sounded like an excuse, even to himself.
He could hear others still all throughout the rest of the house, as the stairs creaked and voices occasionally carried. Presumably Victoire had brought little friends along, or was off badgering her grandfather somewhere.
"Not yet," said Draco. The comment was so quiet that, thankfully, Lucius had not heard it.
“So here’s what I say you do,” Theo continued.
Unless, of course, they were naked.
Apparently the last Thunderbird Seeker had graduated this year, and so the position for it was open, instead of trying out to be a substitute of sorts. Harry thought that it was fate, because there was one Chaser’s spot open as well—the one who’d held it formerly being a girl who’d, according to Cosima, sustained an optical injury that hadn’t been completely healed in time.
“He’s here to see you,” Ginny said casually to Hermione as the younger woman crossed the room towards the far sofa and plopped down across from her and the twins—next to a man Harry hadn’t seen in years.
“No that’s all right, Molly. It’s already been an entire half hour after all. Wouldn’t want to keep anybody. So, Fred and myself are expecting. I’ll be due in November.”
“No,” he insisted. “Because now I... I’ve had a lot of time to understand Draco. This—week after week of just sitting here. That’s what you were afraid of, and
with his antics, which seemed to amuse Draco endlessly, and was thus tied for first place with Cedric. They were sent off with the assurance that the Champions would get the necessary information a month before the final task, followed by the order to go about as normal until then.
. Draco had not been pleased to discover that Harry had not figured out anything regarding what was expected of him, and had insisted that they begin trying to decipher it immediately. Harry had tried to warn Draco, asked him to get ear plugs or something to serve as proper ear protection, but the blond had waved him off.
Harry nodded, surprised and grateful, and followed his companions out.
“Anything.”
Reid was a more immediate concern, of course, what with the possibility of her actually probing his mind at any moment.
His voice was low, dangerous. Harry thought back on his words, quickly realising what the blond must of heard in them. “Hey, don’t. I’m perfectly fine.”
"Yes I suppose I still have the two of you. Won't show up alone, at least."
She turned around to face them again just in time to see Harry pull back from the blond, stricken. “What?”
Neville swallowed. “What can I really do, though?” he eventually asked. “You lot— er I mean, Skeeter’s people are vultures. I can’t just stop seeing him. Do you reckon I ought to get out in front of it?”
"S'pose I can't fault you for that," Harry sighed.
“Don’t say anything to her, Neville, ever,” Harry warned, and Neville’s back straightened. He nodded.
But his smile was soon dropped, replaced by trepidation once they’d arrived and were led inside.
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “I like this job because we’re mates,” he said. “I’d hardly want to work on behalf of some pompous arsehole who thinks he’s Merlin’s gift to wizard kind.”
she privately chastised.
But Harry couldn’t just walk out. This wasn’t what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to make it
spoke a foreign language, but he hadn’t even consciously thought those words before they’d just come out of his mouth. That was significantly more alarming.
“Answer the question,” the Auror said through gritted teeth.
Draco’s head whipped back just in time to watch his family owl swoop down and place a letter in front of him. Draco blinked at the bird dumbly. “Pyxis?”
"I'd tell him he should be nicer to students,” Neville answered immediately. “Er, I reckon he might not be as Snape-like then, but terrifying first years isn't exactly the best skill for a professor. I wouldn't say it to be rude or anything, just to try and help him understand where some others are coming from."
But that was another problem for a different day; right now he had to stop his sister from thinking he had some kind of problem with Dumbledore. Even if he did, just not in a way she’d ever understand.
Finally, after several long moments, Draco quietly said, “I’m sorry again about the Hippogriff.”
“Is it any different on her end?” Draco pressed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” whispered the Dark Lord. “And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?”
"Good luck, love," Pansy said, giving a quick peck on the cheek. Blaise gripped his shoulder for a moment and then they all four walked away.
“In the meantime there were actual search parties,” said Maria, recalling it all. “By that October, everyone was pretty sure they were looking for a couple of bodies. When they showed up in the castle and seemed perfectly fine, the staff actually got mad, like they thought Cel and her just played them all or something. Wasn’t ‘til later that they realized…”
"Potter wants to talk to you."
“All right everyone,” he said. “My time’s about up, and then I’ll have to make way for the people you all
“Help me!” Draco shouted. Harry realised then that Draco likely didn’t know Harry wasn’t actually an Auror.
Harry stood rather abruptly then. "I think I'll just get a head start to class," he said. Draco was still too stunned by how the conversation had turned to follow, only snapping out of his stupor when he noticed Diggory standing and chasing Harry out of the hall.
"How've you been, 'Mione?”
“Well it was the worst thing I ever went through, so yeah,” Draco told him bluntly. “But it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. They told me that’s why I didn’t die. And now I want to be grateful for that and get on with my life, be happy now, you know?”
Sheila had nodded, following Harry’s train of thought. “It’s a very real possibility that, although he has dressed it for you as a desire to make your life difficult in revenge, he may actually be exercising a defense mechanism against
Harry stared, speechless.
"And why's that?" she asked anyway, smiling back.
Neville was quiet, picking back up on his tapping along to the music. “Okay,” he finally said. “Tell me what we need to do, then.”
“Nothing much,” he answered truthfully. He’d seen the blond’s place of work, and they’d had that moment at Hogwarts—but that felt too private to gossip about, really. Not to mention wrapped in things he’d rather not discuss. He gave her something else instead, taking the opportunity to seek friendly advice. “I was… considering inviting him to Hermione’s wedding, actually. She said it came with a plus-one, but I don’t know if that’s too… you don’t really invite your mates as a wedding date, I mean.”
That night, Harry returned to his flat. He sat on his plush lounge chair, staring off into the middle distance for a long while, before he stood and exited through the floo.
His wretched counterpart was wrong, anyway, or exaggerating. Harry had fancied himself in love with Ginny once, sure, but the whole thing had lasted longer than it should have, and wasn’t even very long, besides. Moreso, after the urgency of the post-war had faded, it had been perpetually lacking in meaningful intimacy.
Neville’s bachelor pad was absurd. One might’ve thought the person who lived here was overcompensating for something, if that person wasn’t Neville. The art on the walls alone must’ve cost someone a limb. The rest of it—the square shaped white-leather sofa, secondary storey above his head, and vintage record players—just drove it home. Harry briefly wondered where the indoor pool was, because he couldn’t put it past.
“Professor Hanson is supposed to be great,” said Celine, “and Clark, of course.”
Harry and Hermione groaned in unison. "Not sure that's the best idea," said Harry.
“Harry!” she said, with what was clearly pleasant surprise, and Harry’s heart lifted.
Harry did his best not to laugh again as Draco tripped a bit and righted himself before finally rounding the corner and disappearing.
“Where did you come from?”
Harry felt a surge of pride that he’d managed this for him.
Weasley was on his feet in the next few moments, his body only slightly sluggish with lingering exhaustion. “Listen Malfoy—”
“Phee,” Draco warned shortly.
It would be down to Blaise alone to discreetly watch for Draco's entrances and exits, since Harry's role in things—as well as Hermione's and Neville's—was to occupy Snape's attention by bringing his wrath down upon themselves. All the three of them could do was pray it would all go according to plan and they wouldn't be forfeiting their entire lives to detention with the man as a result.
He’d told himself it had been a bad idea, because he was afraid.
"Oi!" Ron said. "What'd I miss?"
“You’re foul,” he finally spit, unable to find sufficient words.
The Slytherin was staring at him, incredulous. “Funny,” he finally said, “I don’t want to talk to you.”
A hand touched his chin, lifting Harry’s eyes back up. Poignant grey eyes bored into his while Harry held his breath.
Harry couldn’t help his blush, and Lavender made a delighted sound.
leave him alone. But they were partners, and they couldn’t just allow the other to go off and be angry. At least, not by themselves.
Malfoy didn’t reply.
go to school here."
"You know, I hate how everyone talks about your eyes. Like they belong to your mum or something. They're your eyes. They're stunning because of you, not because of her. I'd never get tired of looking at them. Does that answer your question?"
“Harry—” Draco tried and failed to interrupt.
Lavender’s expression shifted into one of offense. “Hey. That kind of sounds like you’re judging, like, everyone at work, including me. Suddenly you have a problem with telling the truth?”
“Ah, don’t be so defeatist,” Neville was mid-cajole. “I bet–”
Draco, though, was still clearly waiting for an answer. Harry had to at least try to reassure him, but he knew sugar coating wouldn’t solve anything, so he resigned himself. “Sometimes I have to... go without. Mostly it’s just housework and insults, though. A few really big lies,” he admitted, “but Hagrid told me the truth when he met me. And I’m here now, so everything’s alright.”
Hermione barely knew him in this world, and she had still done what she could for him. And—regardless of the reason—Sheila was doing what she could, even despite his not making it easy.
He was not too surprised to get away unscathed there.
feel and we’re going to be
“Harry!”
“Oh definitely,” Draco assured him, a laugh in his voice. “Think a kid might be next.”
"What?" Harry said, shaking his head. "No, you're missing the whole point."
Then, after several tracks had gone by, the music paused for slightly too long of a moment. People looked about themselves in confusion, but then relaxed at the sound of Neville’s voice.
“Merlin,” Draco sighed. “Just—damn it all. Come here.”
standards.”
Lavender gave Harry a look of outrage. “You prick!”
"Oh no," she said, lifting her chin in defiance. "You don't get to blame me for this one. You decided to fancy him all on your own."
“And here I was thinking I’d soon be disowned.”
Draco smirked, eyes sweeping the room to give his next words more effect. "Well, it seems we're alone in my bed. So now seems a reasonable time for you to do so, and maybe repeat that, for the sake of my ego of course."
,” Theo deadpanned.
Draco looked between the two of them somewhat helplessly. “I still don’t understand what’s going on.”
Draco looked at him, surely unimpressed by his reaction. “Hardly. She got revenge for the potential blood heirs she lost. She punished him for daring to think his children were his own pawns instead of hers.”
“Will someone
She waved her hand in the air in some sort of all-encompassing gesture Harry suspected he was meant to interpret. “I mean, I assumed you probably don’t want to talk about it, but I did overhear it. You have to know everyone there did, really. But Harry, if you feel guilty, whatever you’re doing here isn’t the solution. You can’t just quit your job. I need you.”
And even if Lavender
Harry looked out across the water. "Yeah, I'm ready," he replied, clutching the gillyweed in his grip.
It was incredibly slow and taxing, and Harry felt he was barely making progress. His hands, he knew, were no longer webbed, meaning that the gillyweed had lasted nearly as long as it was going to. He kicked harder, feeling the webbing of his feet begin to disappear as well.
He turned to her again after a moment, finally looking away from the giggling girls. "You knew about Harry and Malfoy," he accused.
She sat up, and Draco helped her the rest of the way. There was no helping her second groan, the dungeons did not have comfortable flooring. And it was so cold, every part of her was stiff—exhaustion hung over her like a cloud. How late had they all nodded off?
“Well that’s certainly new.”
Harry looked down at his page of half-formed doodles and back up. He sighed, unable to recall what he’d been taught in Transfiguration this morning, either. If he’d been taught anything at all, that was. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Just distracted.”
“Do you–” she started, but was interrupted by Cosima’s sudden appearance. “Did you hear?” she asked Maria. Harry’s back straightened; she looked absolutely dejected.
Harry dropped Malfoy’s harsh gaze then, staring at his own feet so he wouldn’t have to look at the professor. The rest of the class was deathly silent as they watched the spectacle Harry and Malfoy made.
I couldn’t explain it, but it’s there, right behind your eyes.”
"Fantastic," Draco bit out once he recovered. "Now I'll have to show up alone while Potter'll have a date."
“Has something happened?” she asked, expression morphing into concern.
“You think this might actually of all been a setup?” Not Harry inquired.
“Good,” Draco said curtly and turned to walk away.
Harry felt his cheeks flush, hating that he couldn’t refute it. Hating the lie. “I’m not here in defense of what I’ve done. I told you, I’m trying to make it right.”
"Do you think this is some kind of joke?! Did you think you were free to
Hermione burst out laughing, her whole frame shaking with the mirth she'd somehow been restraining. Draco smiled at that and grabbed hold of his collar, pulling Harry towards him and kissing him breathless.
But Draco had turned away from him, allowing long moments to stretch on before he spoke again. “I need some time with this,” he said, his voice now flat, detached.
"Of course not," he snapped, looking at his friend at last. "That's just my father's way of saying that he'll now be intercepting any letters sent to her and any she might send to me. My mother's already assured me that she accepts me, this is purely Lucius."
Lucius merely nodded and left the room.
Harry smiled. "It's alright, given the number of times I've nearly said Malfoy."
“All right I’ll give it to you two,” Joshua said when the group caught up with them, “you’re pretty good.”
After the elf had gone and returned and gone again, Lavender turned back to Harry. “So if it isn’t Draco, do fill me in on why you’ve suddenly gone mental.”
There was a smattering of boos and Neville just nodded. “Exactly, I feel the same!” he assured them. “But I love music, so I’ve gotten permission to play some hits most of you’ll be familiar with! That sound good to everyone?!”
Harry looked around, and chose the safe option. "Neville."
But he couldn’t. There was no way to explain without revealing everything.
“What’s happened?” Harry wondered aloud to Joshua as they entered History of Magic. He’d been noticing since leaving breakfast how particularly cheerful everyone seemed to be. Siskin had laid into several people for having private conversations during first. As Harry took his seat, students murmured enthusiastically to each other all around him while awaiting professor Hanson’s arrival.
“So... this was all for nothing then,” Not Harry said after a moment. “I mean, one of us grabs this cup and the task’s over. Unless You Know Who is planning to attack in front of the entire audience, I think old Dumbledore was having Scrimgeour on.”
Harry looked at her blankly.
"Regardless," said Severus. "Draco is old enough to make his own decisions and live with the consequences."
“He can’t be expected to compete like nothing is wrong!” Hermione protested. “That’d be grossly unfair and not to mention completely dangerous!”
"Merlin! Are you all incompetent?!" Snape demanded before stalking over to Harry's workstation. "I really shouldn't be surprised Potter, your abysmal effort in my class is as unmatched as ever. Another thirty points from Gryffindor! And where is your
“‘lo Neville,” said Harry, hoping if he was calm, things would go smoother.
“He wants to be close again,”
he could sense in his mind maintained his resolve.
"Why?"
“Never mind,” he said soothingly. “It’s nothing.”
Harry shuddered at what he knew Snape must look like, and Malfoy seemed to automatically pull him closer in response. Harry stiffened on reflex, they'd never been quite this close. Malfoy's body was suddenly everywhere—he didn't know how to describe it. He didn't think he could.
"You were supposed to be making sure Draco was in the clear, not looking at Snape, if I recall correctly," Harry gritted out.
Malfoy felt the change, though, and pulled back again before Harry could say anything.
“You already are somebody, you know,” Harry reminded Neville, matter-of-fact. “And you never needed them.”
Time easily got ahead of Harry lately, as he spent the majority of his days practicing defence magic for the upcoming task as directed, and his evenings surrounded by friends in the Slytherin dungeon until he eventually followed Draco to sleep. Harry wouldn’t say he’d gotten
Harry pushed past a young girl who was nearly crying with excitement, trying to squeeze his group through. He had to flash his badge at glaring fans more than once before they made it to the section at the bottom of the stage.
Part of Harry still didn’t believe he’d be watching Hermione get married just days from now. It had been a long time since he’d imagined that was something he’d ever actually witness, nevermind that this was an entirely different groom. And, Godric, but
“You know it wasn’t on purpose.”
Half way through the period, Hermione's cauldron blew up in her face. Snape descended on her, obviously trying to keep his glee at Hermione's failure in check, and having little success. The chaos began when she leapt from her chair and began wailing. The pleased gleam in Snape's eyes disappeared, replaced by obvious apprehension at the sight of tears. Ron, smack in the middle of the whole mess and completely ignorant, looked gobsmacked.
Harry laughed, but then he remembered what they'd been talking about. "Tell me why you said you were awful first."
“I convinced him and Narcissa to go shower and get some food in them while they had the chance.”
Hermione eyed his hand, split and looking quite painful. The Slytherin didn't even appear to notice. "Sure, as long as it isn't a lie. Anyway I came to tell you: I think you should try again."
Not nearly long enough later, Harry pulled away. Draco’s heart stopped, the fear that this was another cruel dream rushing back. That was, until Harry said, “I’m so sorry.”
“But she didn’t, did she? Oh,” Draco whispered, his eyes shining. “She had… she had nothing to do with it. It was all you. It was
Harry was sure it suited Reid just fine. She didn’t need anything from Harim’s lifetime, and so the black hole where Harim typically dwelled had been unlikely to register with her.
Okay so, sometimes I have to go back and make minor edits because I don’t catch the little plot hole in time. It’s happened a handful of times (sorry), but I’ve been catching them as I’ve been rereading to make sure everything is correct before I finally finish up this fic. This latest time was fully an accident as I just wasn’t paying attention. So, to course-correct for those who read it before I fixed it: Bellatrix was twenty *nine* when she “took over” her House. Not twenty. That is important. Full disclosure, the HP movies mess with my perception of ages every now and again. My bad.
Harry finally looked at him, his mouth opening like he meant to reply but producing no sound. Finally, he swallowed. “I need to be a part of this. It needs to be me.”
“No,” Draco interrupted, his voice low. “You listen. There’s always been bad blood between us, Weasley. Even before we’d ever spoken two words to each other. And since then the words have not been kind ones. I’m not going to apologise, you’re not going to apologise. No need to waste the breath on pretence.”
Draco tossed himself down on the sofa opposite, grabbing a pillow to put over his face. "I'm doomed," he said, voice muffled.
Severus looked on silently, preparing for the fallout if he were to have to step in on the boy's behalf. If Lucius raised his hand or his wand, Severus would have no choice.
"They said—I mean I heard that they took the person you care about the most. For the task, earlier," said Ron.
“You and me both,” said Draco.
"I think," began Draco, "that since you so rudely rejected me the other day—"
Draco blew out a long breath. “I don’t hate you, Dad.”
Harry kept walking, but the gesture made him feel about a million times better, as was clearly the intent. His grin returned in full force. Draco smiled back at him, fondly exasperated.
"I didn't really know how much you had to drink," Harry explained, shrugging. "I couldn't be totally sure..."
It was then that Harry finally recalled his conversation with Colin, a week ago now.
fashion, Slytherin House threw a party in the dungeons. Or more like Pansy threw a party, and it seemed to Draco like half of Hogwarts showed up. He noticed Diggory and Krum around more than once, both of them clinging to Chang and Hermione practically the same way Harry was to Draco. Harry hadn't released Draco's hand all day since the task, claiming the memory of Draco's unconscious body tied to an underwater statue was still too fresh in his mind. Draco wasn't about to complain.
Green eyes met his own and hardened with determination. "Yes he is, Professor."
It took every ounce of willpower that Harry possessed to keep himself in check. “No,” he said, immensely proud of how calm he sounded. “I want you to explain to me why.”
“I did—I did everything you—you instructed,” the man called Wormtail begged.
“Draco?”
"Wish you'd call me by my name, I am sitting right here you know," Harry cut in.
Harry watched Malfoy’s face as he spoke, and decided that enduring that awful conversation with Dumbledore this passed summer had been worth it just for this. He knew things about Tom Riddle that he’d never wanted to know, never asked to know. But Dumbledore had sat him down, his usually sparkling eyes sombre as he explained in grave detail how Voldemort had become who he’d been and why, and what Harry had had to do with it.
“Amjad. You told him you’d go to more games. That you wanted to see him play,” she explained. “And I really want to believe you weren’t just saying that. But seeing as how I had to practically escort you there
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his friend’s excitement. “That’s great, Hermione.”
"Save it, Malfoy," interrupted Hermione. "I know you don't really believe any of that rubbish about blood."
Draco's face had darkened, but he finally nodded.
“One person’s business isn’t everyone’s business, even if it’s the truth,” Harry retorted harshly.
“I don’t know what you’d like me to tell you,” admitted Harry. “Like I said, I want to be different. I’m tired of ruining people’s lives for money or whatever.”
In hindsight, it really shouldn’t of been such a surprise that Dumbledore would tell him no. Pointing out that Harry was also ‘
`Seven Years Later`
“I’m sure the other players had nothing to do with it,” Harry said, mock solemn.
These were things Harry had been given the opportunity to have seen and learned and recognised on his own, in only the relatively short time since his life had been so thoroughly rewritten.
Harry tried to keep the frustration off his face. It seemed everyone in his life had heard ‘what happened’ with him and Malfoy, and yet Harry hadn’t actually been told anything substantial. What the bloody fuck could he have said that had suddenly made him and Malfoy everybody’s favourite gossip? “Right,” said Harry flatly. “Well there’s that at least. Let’s just go back to talking about
my friend. Or, or I mean, you were, to me. Before I bollocksed it up by acting how I did. I understand if you wouldn’t want to be, anymore,” he finished lamely, feeling very small.
Draco looked at his friend for a long moment before finally choosing "Truth."
Heartbeats by The Knife is playing at the beginning of this chapter; I couldn’t resist the opportunity
“You lot are getting bolder,” Neville said flatly, not bothering with pleasantries.
Harry was impressed, the blond didn’t even appear out of breath as he must have been.
But he couldn’t possibly.
He abruptly felt horrible. This was her job, and he had been yammering on ceaselessly about his problems since the very beginning. This conversation alone was enough to showcase how little Harry had learnt about her, in return.
“I don’t care,” Sirius replied. “I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s over, and that’s not until June.”
“That’s the last thing that would change how highly I think of you my boy. Merlin, I chased pants a fair amount myself, surely past the point of judging others. Much less family.” Sirius assured him with a wholehearted laugh that brought out Harry’s relaxed grin once more. Sirius glanced at Draco then. “And I’m not going to bite anyone, no need to look so pale.”
“Uh,” Draco replied eloquently.
“I don’t want your damned pity,”
This.
Draco nodded, some of the weight of the past few weeks returned to his shoulders, and stood again. "Suppose I'd better go and find out."
Harry handed over the bundle of food.
a father! You get to remember how he taught you to fly, and took you on trips. You get to remember him cheering for you on the stands and laughing with you in the grocery aisle and telling you to hide when you’d done something ridiculous and your mum was likely to be upset. Your mum that you also had and
It was the other man, the human, who spoke next. “It is ready, Master.”
After all the information they had to share was exhausted, Sirius rubbed his eyes. “What’s the time?”
Harry placed the last of the records back onto the correct shelf, and silently left before the sun began to peak over the horizon.
“Stop,” Harry said. “I’ve told you before and I’ll tell you a million times if I need to: we weren’t
Harry cringed a bit. “I- you’re right,” he admitted. “I wasn’t trying to…” he cut himself off, fumbling awkwardly. “I’m sorry. That’s, er, that’s all I came to do is say that, actually.”
Neville was staring at him, mouth slightly open but apparently unable to reply. Blaise eyed those lips for a few seconds, to give them a chance to form words. When that didn’t happen, he decided he’d been patient enough.
“They’ve been here for years... A Death Eater used Crucio on them until they went mad,” he admitted. “I come and see them now and again, even though they don’t know who I am.”
She pursed her lips. “I’m chopped liver then, am I?” she said, brow raised.
All except, of course, Ron. Harry barely saw him anymore, only in classes, where the redhead would determinately ignore him. And in the Great Hall during meals, where he would sit next to his brothers and act as though Harry were not in the room. Harry had taken to sitting with the Slytherins during these meals, since there was no spoken rules against this, and most of his friends were Slytherins now anyway. Hermione, though, tended to sit wherever Viktor sat, making conversation and possibly more friends among the witches and wizards of Durmstrang. Harry was glad that she'd found someone who seemed to genuinely care for her. Though they'd spoken little, Harry knew that Krum was a good person. He'd stuck by Hermione when she'd chosen to stick by Harry, and for that Harry was extraordinarily grateful. He hoped that the two of them would stay together once the tournament was over, it seemed they would.
“That’s not—of course I care about you more than them. What kind of a question is that?”
Draco thought back at her loudly.
“And then what?” Lavender demanded, almost shrill.
"Oh well, uh, I do, but I hadn't needed it lately. Is Draco and everyone asleep?"
Yourself and Harim have led vastly different lives, and have, therefore, remarkable differences. This is exacerbated in your current circumstances as you have thus far proven frankly unwilling to make sense of one another. The antagonism between you is what keeps you from merging as you should have long before now. To stress the point: you
It spiraled jaggedly around his wrist, the width of a wire, and upwards, wrapping again and again around his arm until it disappeared into his sleeve at the crease of his elbow.
"Fine with you, or fine with us?" Harry wondered.
you. Mine
"Yes, well, it's the way it's going to be, apparently." He stood then. "I should turn in for the night."
Draco smiled softly, and it lit him up as it always did. “You’re staring at me,” he explained.
After a long moment, Theo looked back up. “Was it... was it horrible?”
Other people were looking over at them now, and Draco cared so little that he himself began to wonder if perhaps he had overdone it a smidge.
Harim’s voice echoed through his head, apparently too exasperated to keep silent as he had been.
