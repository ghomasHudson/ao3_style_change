home not good or stable enough for him, hm?”
“It was nice to meet you too.”
“Well… never mind. We can talk about it later. I’m tired, where can I sleep?”
Harry had woken up at 6AM, despite going to bed at nearly 1:30, being used to doing so to prep Uncle Vernon’s breakfast. When he went downstairs and began pulling out pans to prep eggs and bacon, a very angry creature (same as that Dobby creature, but much,
“What do you mean, my dear boy?”
“Why… why can’t I see your scar?”
"I'll, um, be spending the rest of the summer there studying with Professor McGonagall so I may already know my way around, but I won't say no to a friend."
“To defeat Vol-”
Well, he didn’t really
“Is… Is something the matter? Aren’t you all wizards and witches?”
He took a few minutes to think before he seemed to come to a conclusion.
The Calming Drought he ended up with really looked more like a Death Drought, in Harry’s opinion. When Snape came around to inspect his potion, the man smirked.
The office itself was very orderly, and much more spacious than it had been when there were so many people in it earlier that morning. Harry looked at all the trinkets on the walls, examining them in detail. His eye caught one in particular, a three-dimensional golden structure in a cabinet. It was a pyramid with a rod piercing the middle of it. In the middle of the rod was a sphere.
“Yes, he does tend to do it. But when I’m feeling especially anxious I like to break out a dish or two I specialize at.”
“Ah, Mister Potter-” Seeing Harry’s slight look of distress, she corrected herself. “-I mean, Mister Evans. If you will follow me.”
He took a moment to think before asking his next question.
The old man’s eyes grew wide at this, but the mask quickly fell over his face again.
Uncle Vernon snarled.
“Hello, Harry. Madam Malkin.”
Harry smiled.
Harry stared at her, slightly dumbfounded, but eventually nodded and closed his mouth. She nodded in return, satisfied.
“Could you please get Mr. Evans a drink please? Perhaps pumpkin juice?”
Harry blanched, the name coming to his mind instantly.
showed up.
“Excuse me?”
“You know my name.” It wasn’t a question.
a wand.”
Harry looked puzzled.
“Evans," Harry corrected the man. The sallow-faced man’s expression hardened at Harry’s correction.
A woman with a scottish accent and small glasses spoke reverently.
The old man slowly shook his head.
“It’s, uh… Harry. Harry Evans.”
The old man turned towards the giant, a placating look on his face.
However, Harry was already gone. He was instantly standing besides Dumbledore, looking pleased. James was in his hands, quivering slightly.
“I see we have an eloquent talker on our hands, hm? What’s your name?”
Harry became happier, more involved in his schooling. He even made a friend at school who he kissed under a tree, before Dudley managed to chase them away from him by calling them rude names.
Remus chuckled.
Harry’s face warmed. This was the first he’d heard of his mother.
At that, Draco shut the door in Harry’s face.
Harry opened the door to find Remus scrawling some notes with a quill on a parchment.
So it was a shocker when he was cornered by five older boys, boys who had heard that he was a faggot who needed to be taught a lesson.
“Now, I’m sure she didn’t mean-”
“-a murderer! I’ve seen him on TV! Didn’t he escape prison a couple years ago?” He scooted back in his seat, considering setting the man on fire.
Harry looked at him, slightly perplexed. While James was groaning a little on his shoulders, he was fine.
“No, Harry, this is definitely
Once he felt he was done, he turned to Remus just as they were entering a back alley.
Harry chuckled.
“Well, just as there are families such as the Weasleys who share our goal, there are those who oppose it. They would see their leader be in charge. The Malfoys were one of their lord’s biggest supporters in the first conflict, and, by all accounts, they are still present in this second conflict; his father especially so. While Draco himself may not be involved just yet, I fear he soon will be. A friendship with him could jeopardize everything we have worked for. It is not my place to tell you what to do, Harry, but I encourage discretion and caution. The country’s safety, if not the entire world’s, hangs in the balance.”
snapping Harry out of his reverie. He walked to the counter.
Harry stared at him for a moment before bringing up his hand. He closed it briefly, and when it opened there was a fire dancing in his palm.
Remus took a moment before responding.
“Ah. Now. Yes. Well, apologies. I’m finishing up the curry now. Once we eat, we can pop on over to Diagon Alley. Remus should be up in his study if you’d like to go work on your Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons? Or, you could simply sit here and watch me cook. Your choice.”
Not super powers. Not random unknown abilities.
Remus confirmed they had everything he needed. Remus walked with Padfoot to a discrete alleyway so he could morph and disapparate. Harry decided to go ahead without them and folded in on himself, landing in his bedroom. He collapsed on the bed and fell asleep.
The statue started turning and rising, with steps following it leading upwards.
Harry takes his first lessons with McGonagall, Snape, and Remus.
He glanced up at his aunt and uncle to gauge their reactions to his words. They were both pale, staring at him in shock.
“I was definitely pulling my punch there, Harry, but I’ll be damned! I’ve never seen a shield manifest over such a large area! Try casting some fire at me so that I might display what a standard shield looks like.”
He walked up the path, following the old man’s billowing robes. They reached the entrance to the castle quickly, where the old man opened the humongous doors with a wave of his hand.
“Well, Harry, the intention was always for you to attend Hogwarts when you turned eleven, just like all wizards and witches in Britain do at that age. However, by the time your birthday came around, your uncle had moved your family to America without informing us. Being that America is in another school’s jurisdiction, we had no idea that’s where he had taken you. And since they didn’t know you moved there, Ilvermony didn’t invite you to attend their school either.”
Minerva McGonagall, the professor who would be responsible for Harry’s catch-up education.
“Harry… When I heard what happened to your parents, I knew who betrayed them. It was the only person who could’ve betrayed them. Peter Pettigrew. I confronted him, with the intent of taking him into custody, but things got… out of control. He exploded the street, killing several Muggles - non-wizarding folk - and, I thought, killing himself. I was sent to prison for all their deaths, at least slightly satisfied thinking that he was dead for his betrayal. We didn’t find out until two years ago that he was still alive, which was when I broke out to hunt him down. Unfortunately, he escaped from me, and… here we are.”
“It’s nothing. I understand, Remus.”
“And, professor, I do not
"I would like to cover Mister Evans' purchase as well."
“He’s- Oh, I see! That’s wonderful! It’s a pleasure to meet you!”
James shook his head, curling in on himself. Harry knew he’d have to move James off the bed when he came back up, but figured that the snake deserved a couple minutes on the most comfortable surface in the room.
He opened his bedroom door and shut it behind him. He used his quieting ability on himself so that his uncle wouldn’t hear the stairs creak as he walked down them. He walked up to the front door, stopped the quieting, and opened it.
Evidently his uncle would
It wasn’t long before the sobs started. He made sure to quiet the room so that Remus and Sirius wouldn’t hear him.
“You know, Father has heard some rumblings from the Ministry that they’ve actually managed to track down
“Why don’t you shower up and we can meet in the Great Hall for breakfast? After that I could help you tend to your classroom. Mine’s been set up since I left last year, besides Hagrid delivering some magical creatures my third and fourth years will be taking a look at this week.”
Sirius chuckled lightly.
Draco smiled, which made his steely eyes glint.
“What do you know about wands, Mister Evans?”
Harry slouched in his chair. He wished he kept his cigarettes. Maybe he could change the coaster back.
Remus and Sirius, decked out in bathrobes with pajamas underneath, quickly came down the stairs to find this scene.
“I’m not planning on making it a habit. Just a small gift to myself for making it through another year.”
. The sun was just peeking out from behind the clouds when there was a knock on Draco’s door.
“Mister Potter. I thought I would see you a few years ago. Welcome to my shop.”
Several quiet gasps went up around the room.
Harry made his way slowly about the room, greeting each fellow professor in turn. When his emerald green eyes landed on Draco, he wasn’t sure he understood the emotion that filled them. Shock, maybe?
Rem.”
Harry didn’t get the best feeling from her explanation. He felt, as he assumed Sirius did as well, that there was perhaps a bit more to her hesitation to letting him stay with Remus and Sirius than simply letting him be around others his own age.
Draco enters the school for the first time in years and ponders what it will be like in his new life.
“I have also seen him conjure fire, and he has suggested that he is skilled with apparition too.”
He practically jumped out of his seat as he threw it open for the large owl, and the letter it held in its beak. He tore it open, anxious and excited to read the words within.
The creature - Dobby - nodded vigorously and disappeared with a
“It’s what I’m supposed to do. Get up, make breakfast. Then I can start my day.”
. What a pity.”
Harry looked at him in confusion.
“Unbelievable! I grew up hearing stories about you. Not that Father would tell me any, mind you, but the house elves were always particularly chatty when they didn’t know I was listening.”
Rubeus Hagrid, the groundskeeper for Hogwarts.
And Severus Snape, the greasy-haired man who stormed out of the room earlier. He was supposedly a double agent working for Dumbledore, but there were more than a few grumbles at hearing Dumbledore’s explanation of this.
can’t do
“Ah! Harry! I wasn’t expecting you back until…” He waved his wand in the air, performing a charm to tell him the time.
So there Harry was, standing on his lonesome staring at the snakes while Dudley fawned over the next kitten or puppy he would raise in abuse. He looked into the eyes of a beautiful jade-colored serpent when he heard a voice.
Harry laughed.
“Uh, thanks. My last name is Evans.”
Aunt Petunia screeched. Uncle Vernon shoved her back and followed right after. The old man stared in shock, his mouth open slightly as he watched the fire in Harry’s palm.
“Impossible. He shouldn’t have been able to find us! Vernon!”
“Erm… You as well, Professor Malfoy.”
Harry hummed.
“Now then, Mister Evans. I will be your Transfiguration teacher during the standard school year. However, before this new year begins I will attempt to catch you up on all essential subjects - Transfigurations, Charms, and History of Magic - excluding Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts. After my lessons, you are to make your way to the dungeons for Potions lessons with Professor Snape. You will partake in private Defense lessons with Professor Lupin on his own schedule. Have I made myself clear?”
Alastor Moody grumbled.
The man looked amazing. His red, long-sleeved shirt and black, denim jeans fit him tightly. His modernized glasses replaced the clunky, round ones he had all those years ago. It looks like he had finally managed to tame his hair, having it looking somewhat… nice.
“Yeah. I really enjoyed the practical magic I did with Professor McGonagall, and I was hoping you could show me some more stuff. She didn’t want to do
Ron walked to Harry’s bed and opened the curtain slowly and was shocked at what he saw.
Next thing they know everything stopped, a second later they saw Draco get lifted in air and went to Harry.
He was watching Remus get Harry ready and laughing at the fact that every time Remus would put harry in his dress robes Harry would kick them off.
Remus nodded, he knew the rituals by heart because his father made sure that he knew them from an early age. The traditions where another thing, his father never taught him those because his mother didn’t want her son to be a traditional pureblood.
“As for Remus I am not sure if you knew that you are a direct descendent of Rowena Ravenclaw” Gurlok said. Remus was shocked himself no one had told him this at all, of course his father didn’t really care about that stuff.
“When she had the baby, we decided that it would be best to give her to some muggles, not because we didn’t love her it was just so hard” Narcissa said quietly.
It took months and a counselor to help them work through everything, but it was for the better because their marriage and family is stronger then it has ever been.
Once it was gone Remus set the goblet down and held onto Harry because he didn’t know how much it would hurt his little boy.
Draco looked at both of Harry’s friends “Look granger I don’t like you and as of right now that won’t change. I don’t like you not because of your blood status or the fact that you are mixed contrary to what you believe. I don’t like you because you think you are smarter then everyone first, and you can’t accept that someone is smarter. I also don’t like the fact that you come into this world with a self-entitlement, thinking that you will change the world and not looking at the world you came into” he looked at her.
Draco sat on the made bed thank you house elves for that one Harry sat in front of him as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.
Remus held his son closer “what will that mean for Harry here” he asked the goblin.
So sorry for taking so long with this chapter, I have been writing it for some time and it has taken different paths but its finally done.  Thank you to everyone who has read up until now and has been waiting for this. The actual story is about to happen so the updates will be a bit sorry but the story is very involved and I want to make sure the chapters are good and not half assed.  Again if you have any ideas on who should be with who go ahead and tell me, the only ones who are off limits are the ones that are already established, I can't wait to know what you think. Make sure to leave a kudo if you like it, comment if you want to also, and thank you so much for liking it, ok I am done on with the story. Oh one last thing I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO HARRY POTTER. If I did well it would be different
“When I got to Hogwarts and became friends with James he didn’t believe what my family did and made it known that everything my family held dear was wrong. I thought that if I told him that I actually believed it and followed he wouldn’t want to be my friend again” Sirius said sadly.
He opened the letter and all color drained from his face and he quietly passed the letter to Narcissa to read.
He walked up the stairs and found his and Harry’s room and opened the door quietly, he didn’t see Harry, but he did see clothes around Harry’s bed.
Sirius said ok and got up and told him he would give Harry a bath while Remus cleaned up the kitchen. Remus laughed and then groaned looking at the mess but started to clean anyways, after the kitchen was clean he went upstairs to get dressed himself.
“Thank you, we kept Harry a secret because I was working for Gringots at the time, and they have rules, Plus with everything with Voldermort we didn’t want to risk anything” Remus said.
Five minutes later Gurlok came into the room and sat down, he smiled at the little family “first of all congratulations on the marriage and bonding” he said while nodding his head. Sirius smiled “Thank you, it was a quiet one with just Harry and the ministry officials” he said taking Remus’s hand.
“Well I never have been talked to like that in my life, I am here to see Harry Potter thank you very much” she said loudly so everyone could hear. The name Harry Potter was a name that everyone would get sad to hear. Molly though had been told by Dumbledore that Sirius’s son was Harry Potter and that when the time come to have her son Ron become his friend.
Ron Weasley walked into the Gryffendor common room looking for his best friend and his girlfriend. He saw Hermione sitting in an armchair by the fire reading a book, but he didn’t see Harry at all.
“You know her better than I do, but she did sound like she was honest so why not give her a chance” he told Sirius.
Sirius looked down and smiled at his new daughter as he put her into bed that night, life was now crazy for the family.
Once they all were dressed they floo’ed to the Leaky Cauldron and went into Diagon Ally, they went straight to the bank. Once they were in Gringotts they asked for Gurlok the Potter Manager.
Ron was still in shock just staring at the scene in front of him not knowing what to do or say. Apart of him wanted to yell and scream but then another part of him wanted to be the understanding best friend.
Sirius jumped up when he heard Lily’s scream, he grabbed his wand and threw on his rode. Remus grabbed his wrist stepping in front of him, “we don’t know what we will find.” He took a shaky breath “remember your oath. If the worst has happened, we grab Harry and come home.”
“Because Sirius is a part of the sacred twenty-eight, and the most noble and ancient house of Black, he will have more in him for that reason. The Lupins are an old pureblood family, but sadly not in the same standing,” Gurlok said.
Silence filled the room. Remus laid the letter on the nightstand with silent tears rolling down his face, as he flicked his wand and the bassinet holding harry floated to the foot of the bed. He laid his wand down and turned the lamp off letting the moonlight fill the room.
Gurlok nodded and wrote down what both men wanted to tell the wizarding world, the heritage sheet would stay in Gringots with the goblins for safe keeping.
“Yes, everyone will know that he is Harry Black. Like I said we have done this before for other people. The wizarding world will think that Sirius was working for us and we decided to hold the birth certificate until his contract was up because of the sensitive nature of cases” Gurlok said.
They spent the last bit of summer laughing and joking and spending time with the Malfoys, Sirius and Remus were also putting off talking to Harry. They knew they had to cause it was August 25th and they had a lot to tell him. They called Harry into the living room and told him to sit down. “We have a lot to tell you and we need to you to listen and not talk unless we ask you how you are taking it ok son” Sirius said. Harry nodded his head; he knew something big was about to happen.
Now James, Lily and Harry where hiding out under a charm, only their friend Peter Pettigrew knew where it was located. Lily put a charm on the paper to make it glow and make a sound if something had happened to them, it was a smart idea. Sirius and Remus always made sure to keep the paper within earshot, always fearing the worst.
He said goodnight to his friends and got in bed and laid down and closed his eyes, he heard in his mind “goodnight master Harry, sweet dreams” he smiled at that and slowly fell asleep. He didn’t know what his future at Hogwarts would hold with Dumbledore trying things, but he knew with his friends and Hogwarts herself with him he could take anything.
Once she stepped out of the floo she sat Draco down in her lap “Dragon I must tell you something, you have a sister her name is Hermione. She hasn’t been around because of unusual circumstances, but she is home now and will be with us forever” she said to her son.
Lucius brought Hermione into the room and showed her to Draco “Hermione this is your big brother Draco” he said with a smile lowering himself onto the seat beside his wife.
Getting Harry up on a normal day was always hard but today all they had do was remind him what they were doing today and that he would see his Draco again and the boy jumped up. At the breakfast table Harry was all jumpy and ready to go. Luna for her part was sad to see her big brother to go school she would miss him.
Sirius was getting mad, but he knew that the goblins hated thieves, he nodded his head “do we know who it was and what they were trying to get” he asked even though he had an idea on both. Gurlok nodded his head “yes it was Dumbledore, and he wanted the gold and the papers I have in my hand” he told Sirius as he handed the papers over.
Once home Sirius took a sleeping Harry to a bassinet they had bought in case of emergency. Remus followed him looking over his shoulder putting his hands around his waist, “life is about to change drastically for us.”
“Before we begin I must ask are you both sure you want to blood adopt him, Harry will have more of Sirius’s family magic in him then the Potters and Lupins” Gurlok said.
Draco for his part leaned up and kissed Harry’s lips softly, the kiss slowly started to heat up and they fell back into bed and under the covers.
Narcissa put Hermione in the middle of the bed and got changed into her night clothes and laid down beside Hermione.
“Harry mate why are you wearing Malfoy’s quidditch jersey” he as his best friend?
Coming back to do their 8
The day came for Harry to head to Hogwarts the little family gathered in the kitchen one last time to eat breakfast. It was quiet no one wanted to say anything, they wanted to take in this moment. After breakfast Harry pot his trunk and Owl and they flooed to Kings Cross station, they landed right on platform 9 ¾.
Remus slowly crept out of the bedroom and made his way downstairs to prepare for breakfast, so everyone could eat and get dressed.
Harry had this feeling of home when he got on the boat and he heard a whisper, but he could not make it out. As he got closer to the school the whisper got clearer, he had no idea what it was, and it freaked him out for a bit. Stepping off the boat and seeing Hogwarts right in front of him was amazing.
Sirius chuckled “that is an understatement love.” He let a sigh, “no point trying to sleep, why don’t you go shower, I’ll start collecting things we need for the will reading tomorrow” he spoke his voice shaky and crackly.
Remus remembered about Harry’s heritage sheet “Gurlok what about the other piece of paper in the folder” he asked the goblin?
Remus took in this family feeling more and more like he didn’t belong in this world. He didn’t grow up with money like these people did.
Clothes started to come off and moans could be heard through the room, two boys who loved each other continued to show it to each other.
Both families got ready and flooed to the leaky cauldron, Lucius was the last with both boys to arrive. They walked out to Diagon Ally and made their way to Gringotts, they knew this moment would probably change everything for them. This was the beginning of what they were dreading but also knowing that it was bound to happen.
He learned that night that maybe Slytherin House wasn’t that bad of a house, also that maybe the ones who came back where not that bad themselves.
Today was going to be a big day for the little family, they would finally make Harry their son, he already called Sirius papa and him Dada.
As he closed the door le leaned against it, he heard the shower running and knew he would be alone for a while, so he sat in front of the door and everything rushed back to him. The site of the door blown in. His friend the loved like a brother sprawled out on the floor. The gut wrenching feeling he had when he couldn’t find a pulse. The weight of it all broke through to him and he let it all out.
The owl went straight to Sirius and held out it’s leg for him to get the parchment that was attached. Sirius took the parchment and gave the owl a treat and watched as the owl fly out the window back to its home.
Narcissa flooed into Sirius’s and Remus’s house calling that she was here, she saw Sirius walking into the living room with a smile on his face.
Narcissa picked up Draco smiling at his accidental magic “oh my little dragon you are a wizard I’m so proud” she said as she hugged and kissed her son.
Gurlok nodded his head while snapping his fingers and a goblet appeared in front of them.
The little family spent the day just being together and bonding, it was something they made sure to do when Lucius wasn’t working.
He and Harry had a strong friendship, granted it didn’t always seem that way but when you are young you only see the shallow parts of things.
Gurlok said to give them 15 minutes to get this sent to ministry and get everything set up then the family could leave.
They both left just as the house elf handed Remus Draco’s bag with his night clothes and his stuffed dragon and a change of clothes for tomorrow.
Harry looked over at Draco who was laying back with his hands over his head smirking wearing Harry’s quidditch jersey.
Draco moved Harry slowly until he was right up against him, he knew that Harry wouldn’t want to do anything atleast until he talked to his friends.
He looked and saw his husband talking to a woman with light blond hair, she had on a beautiful dark green skirt that would have gone to the floor if she wasn’t wearing heels. Her shirt was a beautiful black shirt that looked like it had lace over it and on the arms.
Both boys where giggling as Draco came down in front of Harry, the parents where in awe of the two boys.
Hours later Draco was laying next to his naked boyfriend smiling softly thanking whatever powers where in the sky for giving him this wonderful man in his life.
“In the wizarding world the sacred twenty-eight are compromised of the oldest and most powerful pureblood families, they have this power from practicing the rituals and traditions of our ancestors who showed their respect to the magic we hold through these traditions and rituals. We are taught from an early age these traditions and rituals and exactly what it means to be from an ancient and noble house, and the power that luxury holds” Sirius said.
“I will hand this to you both and then we will go over everything on the sheet” Gurlok said while handing over the sheet to the two men.
Remus grabbed Harry and told Sirius to go on first and they would be right after, Sirius nodded his head and grabbed the floo and threw them into the flames and in stepped into them and in a loud and clear voice said Malfoy Manor.
Remus took over for Sirius “Xeno is having problems with the loss of his wife and he couldn’t deal with a baby” he said smiling at the little blond-haired girl.
Narcissa knew that before Lucius cheated they had a strained marriage, they never made time for each other.
Sirius took the letter and broke the seal and slowly opened to the letter, he took a deep breath and looked at his husband before reading the letter.
Sirius just laughed out loud “A spell that most purebloods are taught to keep dress robes on, most don’t use it, but mother made sure we used it all the time” he told Remus.
If he did not have his father and his brothers and his uncles to teach him how to be a proper Weasley not the one his mother and Dumbledore wanted he would probably do what they wanted.
“Cissa come on in we are in the study” he said as hugged Narcissa.
They walked to the entry way themselves Remus and Draco went first followed by Sirius and Harry.
Gurlok looked at both men “now Sirius we can’t do the full pagan ritual I am sorry because that will take too long, but we respect the rituals, so we allow some of it. So, with that I am sure you know an abridged version of this right” Gurlok asked the man.
Sirius picked up a sleepy Harry and walked to the little boy’s room slowly, upon arriving he put Harry in bed and covered him up and leaned down and kissed his forehead. Remus leaned down and did the same.
He tightens his grip on Sirius the only tell his crying being the wet spot on Remus’s stomach. He ran his hand through his boyfriend’s hair as both men just dried themselves to sleep, to full of grief to speak.
“Draco had a nanny for a little bit because at the time I didn’t have the time” Narcissa didn’t want to admit she just didn’t want to do the hard part of raising a kid.
“What power can own a school have though” Harry said confused. “Well Hogwarts is more of a sentient being then just a school” Remus said. “She is also the center of where Magic originated, it is said that deep inside Hogwarts is a power that holds all of the magic of the world. Those who hold it rules the world, but no one has ever actually heard it because Hogwarts will not give up her secrets” Remus said.
Sirius smiled “Cissy this is my husband Remus, and our little boy Harry” he said as he took Harry from Remus.
They were shown into a room and waited for the goblin to enter the room, 5 minutes later a goblin entered the room and introduced himself “hello my name is Gurlok I am the Potter Manager what can I do for you” he asked the men.
“The baby is perfectly fine she was with the babysitter at the time, her name is Hermione Jean Granger, we can do everything tonight and be done with it” Amelia said.
Amelia told them that they are free to go and to have a wonderful night, she watched them walk out of her door hoping that life for little Hermione was filled with love and laughter.
When he walked out the door he met his husband in the middle of the two rooms, they slowly walked to their room to lay down cause today was a crazy day, but they wouldn’t trade the day for anything in the world.
Remus gave Sirius a tender kiss, “I’m going to shower, and then try to catch a few hours of sleep.” He gave a halfhearted smile and headed for the bathroom.
Sirius smiled softly “we came home to an owl waiting for us, and our surprise it was from Mr. Lovegood” he said.
“James ran it and that money Dumbledore wanted for himself, so he wanted to try everything to get it. Now he wants to try and get you so he can kill you and take your money and power” Sirius said. Harry was in shock, but he also knew there was more to everything, “there is more I can tell” he told his fathers.
Amelia wrote it down and took out her wand and said a spell and the birth certificate materialized,” I just need both of you to sign and it will get sent off and it will be official in the magical world” Amelia said as she passed the parchment to Lucius and Narcissa.
Narcissa knew it was time to go and get Draco from Sirius and Remus, she hoped that he had fun and made a new friend.
The next day Remus got up and walked over to his god son’s bassinet and saw he was up, he picked up Harry and carried him downstairs and into the kitchen. Remus sat him down on the highchair while he made breakfast for them.
The new family left Gringots and made their back to the leaky cauldron and into the floo to head back home.
Remus gave a minute for the fire to die down before he grabbed some floo powder and threw it into the fire and held on to Harry and stepped into the fire and with a clear voice said Malfoy Manor.
Hermione looked at her best friend “Harry your happiness is important to me, with I get why you said you fell for Malfoy here. I’m not saying he isn’t nice looking, but his personality is something to be desired” she said looking at Malfoy.
Hermione and Ron have drawn away from him. They don’t pair up with him in class, or force him to do his homework. He has to sleep in the room where Draco’s body lay, cold and still, because he can’t bear the thought of having to ask Ron to move to his room instead. Half of him thinks Ron wants him to, so that they can talk it out and be friends again, but the other half thinks Ron doesn’t want to be around a killer.
Next chapter already! Slightly longer as well, which I hope you enjoy, and I am no longer blindly stumbling along! Ok, maybe some stumbling, but I have a faint idea of a plan.
The moment of hesitation is too much. There’s steps below, thundering towards him, and then arms around his waist to pull him to safety. He’s numb, the terror and apprehension sticking in his throat as they turn him around again, peeling his fingers from the filthy scrap of paper.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And as I keep telling you, Malfoy was a dick from day one. He’s not going to suddenly change when he’s stopped being a weird silent ghost boy.” Ron mumbles, then falls out of his chair as Hermione sends a flying cushion his way.
She nods. “Psyche ward. It’s only for me at the moment, until I pass a test they’re going to make, and then I’ll be teaching others and practicing on my own patients.”
I really don't know how to write panic attacks, I've never experienced or seen one happening before... If you do have more knowledge on them, and feel I've written something wrong about it, please tell me, so I can do better in the future. Thank you!
“Not speaking to me either? Wow, you’re really stuck up your own arse. Even on the losing side, with dear old daddy in Azkaban again.”
“Awww, come on!” She pouts. “Aren’t you curious about how Looney Lovegood knew about your obsession with phoenixes?”
Pansy’s already sprawled on a chaise lounge, suspiciously similar to the exact one she had claimed in Slytherin, excluding the colour. This one, like many others, is a deep purple. It reminds him of a bruise.
“Right! That’s enough!” Poppy bustles over. “You’ve given your presents and had a nice chat, but these two need rest! Only two visitors each!”
“I understand, but the board of governors and the ministry won’t.” Flitwick frowns, sitting on his stack. “I’ll talk to McGonagall about it. For now, I’d like one of you to bring Mr Malfoy this work.” He pulls out his wand again, flicking it and levitating a stack of paper over to Harry. “I’m sure Miss Granger will be able to explain it.”
His bed is piled with blankets, far more than necessary. He thinks he sees dried blood on a pillow, and remembers when he’d seen Draco spitting blood into the sink in the morning. He had gone back for his socks, having accidentally left them behind, but Draco had looked so furious at being caught that he’d fled and never mentioned it again. Perhaps he should have.
To die, Draco thinks. I wish I could die and leave everyone to their own business. Mother wouldn’t have to worry about him, and all of his new friends wouldn’t have to keep on pretending they liked him. The rest of the world could celebrate, dancing on his grave in vengeance for the horror he’s caused. Most of all, Draco wouldn’t have to keep on living this rotting life.
Corner, Michael

“Please, take a seat.” Narcissa smiles, a ghostly beauty even in her older age. Harry sits on the edge of an armchair, the cushion stiff and uncomfortable beneath him. He wonders for a second why they would have such a horrible armchair when they have so much money. Then he remembers how Draco had more pride than common sense, and he sighs internally.
“Draco!” Pansy hurries forward, from the entranceway, dress swishing about her knees. “Thank Merlin, I thought you weren’t coming. Your Jaebo keeps asking for you, I think he might run away to try and find you if you don’t talk to him.”
Draco can only helplessly nod, watching the small figure dance around the paper. What a mad turn of events.
Thanks for reading!
“Trust me, Harry, having a huge gash in his arm will probably be better than having the Dark Mark.” Theo’s voice lowers at this, his own fingers rubbing at the fabric over his own arm. “It’s like a living thing in there.”
He knows they don’t actually mean it. They’ve become a weird mesh of interconnected friends, so none of them can truly hate each other without offending one of their own friends. He may hate the way Blaise manages to rile him up, but when Ron plays chess with him every evening, it’s impossible to stay mad for long.
Enjoy!
“There’s too many wrackspurts buzzing around the eighth years there.” She smoothly descends into the seat opposite Ginny, next to Ron.
Mind magic, mind magic… Aha! Harry pulls out a thick book, suppressing his coughs at the flurry of dust, and tucks it under his cloak. It’s not like the book will be missed.
“Draco, stop i-”
Mind made up, Harry grabs some parchment and starts copying up the spell, along with the potion. He’s a terrible potion maker, but Slughorn could do it for him. All Harry needs to do is work out which food Draco would reject.
“A little.” She concedes. “Neville has approached me about the same topic. Not the same subject, but the same topic. If you’re willing to put in the extra work that will come with it, I will be willing to place you both with the professors.”
(The drip, drip, drip of blood, trailing in a smooth stream down his arm, pooling on the cold stone floor and creeping towards him-)
He stares at the dead man in front of him. It does make sense. This is just his punishment, isn’t it? He should have kept the list, he should have tried to make amends, but he’d been too caught up in Theo and his own head. Now it’s too late.
“Mrs Malfoy, I-”
She must have been like a mother to him, in some ways. She must be like a mother to all of her students.
Ron and Hermione dating is fine with him. He’s happy for them. It’s only when it becomes like this, him awkwardly trailing after them, that he can’t help but wish things were like before. When he was the one in the middle, the one they relied on. When he had some reason to be in their lives.
Someone screams behind them, a girl, or a high-pitched boy. Footsteps, horrified gasps and panicked cries, echoing in the stone hallway. The tea seeps into the floorboards, soaked up by the pastries or merging with the scarlet liquid.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do up your buttons.” She downs the rest of the cup. “If you want to date me, I won’t have you being ogled by other girls, got it?”
“Theodore!”
“Hello!” Black calls from beside him, watching as the group of people swarm into the wing with two wrapped boxes. “Is that food? Merlin, please say it is, I’m starving!”
Going back to Hogwarts would be hard for anyone after a war, but it's a little easier to manage when you're not alone.
Draco stares at him, dread bubbling into something entirely different. ‘How can you say that? You-’
Slap!
My cat keeps meowing at me and trying to open this cupboard, so I really can't think of much to say. She's an adorable fluffball, but I really can't deal with her sometimes...
Theodore sniggers, trying to make light of the situation, but that’s not how Gryffindors work. The tip of a wand is instantly poked into his face by Neville. “Don’t be so cruel! You may have bullied us before, but in case you haven’t noticed, you aren’t exactly the top dogs right now.”
“Why would they be annoyed with the rooms?” says Neville.
“I’m going to take you to the Hospital Wing, alright?”
“You can paint moving pictures?” Remus gasps.
Remus’s grin falters. “He’s...alright. Andromeda is doing a good job. Says he’s changing his hair colour to match her clothes these days.”
The days pass. He manages a tiny bit more every day; a short stroll in the gardens, a whole bowl of soup, changing into new pajamas, running water and shampoo through his hair in the sink. His mother notices instantly, of course, and now sits with him while he eats, or reads to him before bed like she used to. She’s trying to make up for it all, he knows, and he wants to tell her that it wasn’t her fault, she wasn’t to blame, but every time he takes in enough air and is on the verge of saying it… his voice catches in his throat. Her forehead will wrinkle up, eyes pleading, but he can’t speak. He just can’t.
Any ideas for upcoming chapters or one-shots, please leave in the comments section!
“Granger. What happened to that little club you had? Vomit.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
He can’t help letting out a choked chuckle of confusion. It may make his throat burn in resistance, but he couldn’t not laugh at that. What else is he supposed to do? Accept that as fact? Accept that Harry bloody Potter just kissed his forehead, and his heart is thumping in his ears, and there’s a grin spreading across his face, and he is most definitely, certainly, absolutely fucked.
To have Malfoy as his friend too, he needs to, unfortunately, make friends with his friends. It’s no good being together if you hate everyone your partner loves.
“Wait, wait- sent to a safe place? So Draco isn’t dead?” Harry's head is reeling.
(“I’m sorry.” His green eyes were wet, voice trembling. “I didn’t mean to. I thought you might- I thought it would help. I’m so sorry.”)
“Darling, I was getting worried!” Pansy fusses, shifting over to give him room.
They’re sitting in Draco’s room again, posters and books strewn all over the floor. Pansy has assigned herself leader of the campaign on the pureblood side, placing Draco on poster creation and Hermione on research and debate. The house elves that usually bring Draco food took one look at the mess and never returned, so now it’s up to Luna to keep him fed. This has the unfortunate consequence of him being forced to actually eat all the food, as Luna won’t leave for classes unless he does, but he enjoys her company for the time she is there.
“Just a lot on my mind. Have you seen Ginny?”
“I think I’d prefer to be helping people with better laws, rather than running the whole operation.” She says modestly, tucking her clipboard underneath her arm. “There’s not much diversity in the ministry yet. That’s something I’d like to fix.”
Potter grins, excitement dancing in his eyes. “You’re on.”
He jumps to his feet, walking away as quick as his legs will take him, a clawing horror in his stomach forcing him to move, constantly move, or else the guilt will catch up with him and he’ll be punished. Hermione tries to stop him as he leaves the classroom, but he pushes past her. He needs to get out.
Leaning his chin on his hand, Harry drifts off again as they all start talking about… something. He isn’t really sure. All he knows is that Parkinson has put one hand over Malfoy’s head, and started playing with his hair. Is that normal? Sure, Harry had suspected they were dating in sixth year, but he’d thought with Malfoy budding up to Voldemort they’d have split up. Evidently not by the way Malfoy nudges closer into her hand.
Speaking of Parkinson and Zabini, the two of them have moved from giving him sly glares to giving Nott them instead. He’s asked Luna about it, who’d muttered something about too many wrackspurts. Ginny had then told him that Luna ‘isn’t a seer, y’know’ and that he should ‘go ask Trelawney if you’re so interested’. He hadn’t asked Trelawney.
This is… unexpected. “Luna. You’ve got something on your cheek.”
“You never think.” Theo snorts, and the somber mood lifts. “Look, there’s no use worrying about it now. What happens will happen, and we can’t change what happened in the past. Let’s just focus on this.”
"Draco? Draco, darling, is that you?" The familiar whine of Pansy comes from the other side of the door. Pansy. He hadn't even considered that any of his old friends would come back, especially as most of them were cleared of everything. Letting out another sigh, he resigns himself to listening to her whine until they get to Hogwarts.
“Hey, Draco! I brought you some food from the kitchens.” He holds out the treacle tart to him, which is exactly like Potter, because he knows perfectly well that Draco despises it.
“I can’t just leave it alone, though!” Harry kicks at the shards of glass, then turns to glare at Blaise’s newspaper, since he can’t see his face. “This is all your fault. If you hadn’t used so much of my magic, I wouldn’t be-”
Draco grabs Harry’s arm, stopping him at the last second, battling with himself. Harry tilts his head curiously, waiting for him to explain, and at his hopeful face Draco crumbles.
Who is it? Can you guess?
The gates creak open, large and ominous, and a gusto of cold wind blows into Harry’s face. He shivers. The stench of dark magic and death is strong in the air, creeping out of the estate eagerly. He hurries inside, relieved when the gates rattle shut behind him, trapping the hissing fury of darkness inside.
His chest tightens, nerves firing up. Pansy whips around to rip into the perpetrator, only to find they've slipped back into the crowd. Thank Merlin. The blame for any trouble caused would land directly on their heads alone right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not yet. I thought you might like to deliver the good news.”
Speaking of smells, there’s another one mixing with the pastries. Metallic. Thick. Something familiar he can’t quite put his finger on. Finally, he lifts his wand, muttering a spell that lights up the candles around the room.
“I know life might be hard for you at times, people might say stuff because you are mixed, but it is ok mummy and daddy love you very much. Your big brother will love you too and be very protective” she said as she looked down at the baby.
An hour later while Remus was making dinner the alarm sounded, and Sirius went to go get Harry, While Remus finished dinner and put the plates of food on the table, he put Harry’s baby plate on his seat.
Harry saw his friends walk up to them and grabbed the desk chair and sat down “So Harry what is going on, Ron told me what he saw” Hermione said softly.
“I umm stole him to because he is a git, a beautiful and sexy git” Harry said quietly.
“We want to honor the name that was given to her so her first name will stay Hermione Lyra Malfoy” Lucius said with pride.
Narcissa said they would come by tomorrow and pick him up and explain what went on once we know everything for sure.
After a bit they all changed into their robes and waited for the train to stop, upon the train stopping they got out of their compartment. Their parents said that someone would take their stuff off the train. When they got off this big hairy man was telling them to stand beside him, they followed him to the lake, and they got in a boat. Draco, Harry, Theo, and Blaise all got in one boat. Pansy got into a boat with some other girls and they were off.
“You are right son, when we adopted you our blood was added, so from Remus you became a descendant of Ravenclaw” Sirius said. Harry was in even more shock; his mouth was open in shock. “Now for the Blacks you are descendant from Slytherin and Merlin” Sirius said. “Because of those you own all of Hogwarts and all the power that comes with that” Sirius said.
While the goblin was gone getting everything set up Remus and Sirius where talking about what they had just heard.
Narcissa had already thought about it “We will take her, I can’t have anymore kids and a daughter is what we wanted to have after Draco” Lucius nodded his head in agreement.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and knew it was for the best, they both knew that if they let everyone know that the little boy in Remus’s arms was Harry Potter he wouldn’t get to live a normal life.
Walking out of the room he walked into Harry’s rom and kissed his forehead, he was happy that Harry took to Luna so fast.
Narcissa smiled and told them what happened and the background, she wasn’t ashamed of what happened at all, her marriage was better then it has been in many years.
After breakfast they went into Lucius’s study and made a list of things they would need, they decided to put Hermione beside Draco.
Molly for her part knew she had lost that one and backed away before anything else could get said. She yelled for her son to follow her, Ron turned around and looked at Harry and Draco “I am sorry for her, she is out of her mind” he said. Harry nodded his head and watched Ron walk away, he turned to his father “dad why is he different from his mother” he asked Sirius.
“With the adoption we have put a birth certificate to the ministry in your behalf, the reason we will tell them for you not registering your son with them when he was born is because you were both helping us. We have done that before, so they will not ask questions, people will just think that Harry Potter died along with his parents” the goblin said.
Sirius nodded his head and stood up and put his vial in the goblet first, he then put Remus’s vial in second. He got out his wand and put it over the goblet and started chanting “sicut superius, et inferius, sicut intus, sic non” Sirius stopped chanting and put his wand away.
Remus nodded his head and took out a vial “here is the Potion you sent with the crushed rune and some of my blood mixed in” he set the vital beside the Goblet.
This time it was different this week it was longer, and Ron was beginning to worry about his best friend.
Before anyone could comprehend it was the day Harry would turn 11, he had already gotten his acceptance letter to Hogwarts. They also knew they would have to sit him down and explain some things to him before he went. Both men knew that with Dumbledore still the headmaster of Hogwarts he would try something with their son. That would wait for a couple of days though today was a day where they would go with the Malfoys to get the boy’s school stuff.
Narcissa looked at Lucius and knew he was embarrassed and ashamed so she squared her shoulders and told Amelia what happened.
The door opened and in walked Ron and Hermione holding hands, Ron looked nervous as all get out and Hermione just looked confused.
Remus grabbed the papers and walked up to the bedroom where his boyfriend was sleeping. He set the papers on the dresser, as he did Lily’s scream filled the room, “SOMETHING’S HAPPENED, GET HERE NOW!”
Remus looked at his boyfriend “I sent a letter to Gringotts stating that we would be for the reading of James Potters will” He told his boyfriend. Sirius nodded his head as he had a mouth full of food. Remus continued “I told them that James left the will in a stack of papers that no one can open but the Potter Manager, and we would be in soon” he said.
Upon arriving home Sirius took the shrunken shopping bags up to Harry’s room, while Remus and Harry followed quietly. Sirius was taking out the crib and putting it together, once everything was put together and in its place, they stood back and admired the room.
Sirius turned looking down at his god son, “I swear I’ll protect you.” A tear fell down his cheek as he headed from the bedroom casting a charm, so he could head everything around Harry.
After that night things went from tense to an easy time in the common room, no one fought or yelled, everyone stayed with the cliques they had for many years.
Halloween night Voldemort was defeated, but Dumbledore was set that he wasn't and was trying to get everyone to think he wasn't. When really it wasn't Voldemort they should be afraid of...
Remus nodded and stepped back pulling Sirius around to face him, “look at me” he puts his hand on his boyfriends checked raising his bloodshot eyes to him, “you don’t have to be a black around me it’s okay.” His own eyes were on the verge of streaming tears, “we will get through this.”
Not saying they didn’t fight all best friends did, they also kept some things to themselves Harry didn’t want to know all the secrets of his and Hermione’s relationship.
Remus growled “look Albus I respect you but I will not allow you to take Harry to a home where the people will hurt him physically and mentally because mark my words Petunia and her husband will” he said with conviction.
Narcissa sat Draco down also and the four adults sat down in the chairs, so they could talk and catch up.
Both boys put on boxers and jeans, for Harry to get Draco to wear jeans was a trial. He would only agree if it was designer ones and Harry would agree to get new clothes.
Remus looked at the paper “what about in the nuggle world, and there isn’t a way for anyone to try and take him away from us right” he asked the goblin?
When they got to the atrium they both flooed back home and took Hermione to their room because after everything that had happened that day they were both tired.
That was all he needed was for Draco to keep him calm and grounded, he opened his eyes and looked at his best friends “so I have to tell you something and you can’t interrupt me until I get done is that clear” he asked his friends?
Remus sat and though for a minute “Well Siri you grew up with James and wasn’t his father’s middle name Harrison. You can have them say that you named him Harrison after the man who was like a father to you and James to honor your best friend” Remus said.
Walking through Diagon Ally quiet, no one paid any attention to the family. They also noticed that no one talked about the Potters at all. Once they made it to Gringots they went into a room to wait for Gurlok to arrive.
Sirius took the vials out of his pocket and looked at it, he had put his Animagus hair in the potion, but the hair had a dark protection spell on it. He had also put some of his blood in the potion and mixed it all up.
Narcissa looked at Draco who was making faces at Harry “Do you think you can keep Draco for the night because we don’t know when we will be able to get back” she asked her cousin.
Both men went into their room and got ready for bed, it had been a long day for the little family.
“I was always told from an early age that the Black family was from a very powerful family and we should be proud of that. I didn’t know how true he was, everyone knew that to be a Black was a privilege” Sirius said.
Remus looked at the quiet boy in his arms and saw that Harry was fast asleep, he smiled and put Harry down for a nap. Both men walked out of the room and Sirius put up a spell to let them know when Harry woke up, and walked downstairs to put the other things they got that day away.
Remus looked “why will he have more of Sirius’s then mine” he asked.
As she walked out of her office and shut the door Narcissa looked at Lucius smiling “I am excited, we will give her the best life” she said with a smile.
I am so sorry it has taken so long to put up a new chapter, I would say life has been crazy but it hasn't really. Life has been mostly me going to doctors and therapist and trying to work up the energy to write.  I am getting better and I now am starting to want to write. The first thing I did was finish this chapter, I hope it is up to what you expect I really did try my hardest to make it as good as I know you guys deserve.  I am going to try and write more because I have the desire and the want to write again, it hasn't been there in a little bit.  Just to warn you I have a new story coming it is a modern day non magical AU Drarry story so be looking for that one.  Finally thank you for waiting and for understanding that I had some personal problems and for sticking by me I love you all very much.
Sirius stepped up “Let me try to get him into them” he said as he took the robes gently from Remus.
They spent a couple of hours inside the store getting a crib, dresser, baby changing table, some toys, and most of all clothes. Once the little family was done getting everything they took it outside and in an ally Sirius shrunk it all down and appropriated them home.
Gurlok was surprised at first because not many people got goblin made wills mostly because whatever was written in that will was iron clad as the muggles like to call it. Also, it was made by blood magic and because of that nothing in this could be made false.
Sitting down Amelia took out a piece of parchment and looked at it and then looked at Lucius and Narcissa.
Lucius guided Narcissa to the entry room and got some floo powder and threw it in and told Narcissa to go first and he would follow.
Lucius walked into the room with Narcissa beside him, Hermione and Luna were already giggling and talking about whatever they talked about. “Happy birthday Harry my dear” Narcissa said, Lucius agreed and with her smiling at the two boys who were still holding onto each other. They could do that in private but in public all they could do was hold hands if they wanted it, but they had to act like the heirs they were.
Ron walked over to her and sat on the arm of the chair “Hermione have you seen Harry” he asked her quietly making sure no one heard the conversation they were going to have.
Sirius nodded his head shifting Harry to a more comfortable position, “James and Lily wouldn’t want that. And as his god father I won’t allow it to happen,” He glared at the old man. “they made it obvious they wanted their son with us, so we will take the boy home with us tonight, we have a copy of their will and it will determine everything,” he finished as he took Remus’s hand in his as he apparated them home.
Before either one could say anything, Draco make his presence known “look Weasley and Granger I won’t lie and say I want you both to be my friend, I will tell you that Harry’s happiness means everything to me. I promise to respect both of you to the best of my ability mostly because I love him” he said looking at both with a sneer on his face.
Harry took a deep breath “well after the Halloween dinner Draco came up to me and wanted to talk to me alone. I was hesitant at first but then I could tell he was being honest, so we went to a deserted classroom and talked” Harry said softly.
Looking down he saw a paper there all he saw was James name and he jumped up tears still rolling down his face. “Sirius,” Remus said his voice full of concern at his boyfriend’s tears as he noticed the shimmering paper. “A letter from James,” he asked walking over to comfort his lover.
Gurlok snapped his fingers and the goblet disappeared “now that the adoption is done he is fully your son congratulations. Now even though he is your son he keeps everything from the Potters, that was rightfully his from birth” Gurlok said.
What Lucius never knew was since he could talk he was getting other lessons on how to be a Malfoy from his grandfather even after he died. Draco would go to his grandfather’s private study and take lessons.
He looked at Hermione “where could he have been these past four hours” he asked out loud.
Sirius put Harry in his dress robes and said a spell and when Harry tried to take off his robes again nothing happened.
Lucius knew that both these men might have heard terrible things about him or his family, he wanted to make sure that Narcissa’s family were comfortable.
Amelia came back in holding a baby in a blue blanket, she handed the baby to Narcissa smiling softly at the look that both parents where giving her.
Once they signed it she sent it off, she told them she would go and get the baby and she would be right back.
He stood there and watched her for a moment just smiling at the way the fire reflected off her tan skin, how she had her beautiful hair up in a bun. To him she was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Sirius nodded and went into his study and wrote a letter back stating that they would love to have dinner with them one night, he sent it with their owl.
“This is my husband Lucius, and our little boy Draco, Welcome to Malfoy Manor” Narcissa said smiling making sure to introduce her family.
Harry was shocked at that he had no idea that Dumbledore was that evil “but why did he kill them” he asked. “Well kiddo he wanted something from you that he though if you were dead and so were James and Lily the will he forged would go to” Sirius said. “Harry you are powerful, James and Lily both are descendants of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff” Remus said.
Walking through the door a goblin nodded his head “Mr. Black it’s a pleasure to see you again, I am sorry it had to be on a day like today” the goblin said. Sirius nodded his head “it is ok Gurlok you said we had something to discuss” Sirius asked him. The goblin nodded his head and took out a bunch of papers “As you know I am now the head of all the estates, well a couple of days ago someone tried to get into Harry’s Potter Heir vault that James set up for him” he said.
He didn’t have to be as smart as them they loved him for who he was no matter what he said and did. He loved Hermione very much and would probably marry her one day, Harry on the other hand was his best friend.
Sirius smiled “she only said that because we are the same age” he said with a laugh.
The next morning, they woke up to Hermione crying, Narcissa smiled down at her and held Hermione as she slowly got up.
Upon walking into the great hall, he saw the four houses and up front he saw Dumbledore he told himself not to make a face at the man. McGonagall brought out this old hat and it started to sing, Harry tuned it out as he looked around the hall. He saw the magic pulsing it was a mix of all four house colors, he was brought out of his musing with clapping.
Both men shut the door quietly and Remus put the charm to let them know if Harry woke up before going into their bedroom to get ready for bed.
He handed the goblet to Remus “help Harry drink it all up love” he told his husband with a smile as he sat down.
They decided on Lyra because it is near the constellation that Draco is named after because they wanted to keep Narcissa’s family’s tradition.
He and Remus had two kids to take care of and to make sure they knew every day that they were loved and supported.
“Who are you to talk to my son like that Molly Weasley, No one wants your dirty poor hands on them” Sirius said with a dark growl in his voice. Harry had never heard his father talk like this in his life he was always nice and sweet and kind. Even when him and Luna did something wrong or pranked them, he never talks to them like that.
“Is there anything else that is needed to be talked about” Sirius asked, the goblin shook his head no and they left Gringotts after getting money out of their vault to get school supplies. As the day went on, they had almost everything but books, Harry kept on looking at his wand in amazement.
Harry was furious at Dumbledore for what he did, and he inadvertently passed some of his power to Hogwarts. There was a power serge inside Hogwarts, and no one felt it, but it could be seen cause the lights got brighter for a second. He was hit on the side by Draco who told him to get behind him because they were going into the great hall.
Lucius and Narcissa stood up and walked around and kissed Draco’s cheek and told him they loved him.
To say Harry was nervous would be an understatement, he closed his eyes for a second and just breathed in Draco’s sent and felt his boyfriend squeeze his waist softly.
Remus shut the window and went over to his husband “who is the letter from love” he asks quietly.
What would Harry's life had been like instead of Sirius ruing off to get Peter he took Harry to his home and raised him with Remus? How would Harry's life been if he was raised in a home with two loving fathers? Also what if on that
Walking downstairs he saw his boyfriend putting some cut up pancakes in a plate onto Harry’s highchair. He sat down and they started to eat and decided after they ate and got ready they would go to Gringotts and get the paperwork out of the way and then go shopping.
Sirius put the letter down “I will open it after we put Harry to bed, she can wait I want to spend the time with my family” he said as he sat down to play with Harry.
Draco for his part laughed softly leaning up and kissing Harry’s neck softly knowing that rest was over, and he wanted more of his boyfriend.
Remus Lupin was sitting in his living room late at night because he couldn’t sleep for some reason. His boyfriend Sirius Black was sound asleep in bed and had been for most of the night since they had gotten back from James and Lily Potters house celebrating Halloween with their god son. He looked at a piece of paper that James had given him. And made sure he took home with, with specific instructions to take it to Gringotts if something was to happen to him and Lily.
His mother on the other hand always made sure he knew what love and compassion meant, he just knew to show it in private and to the person you where meant to be with.
“Dumbledore also wants that power so he can rule the magical world and only you have the power to know where it is if you want to, Hogwarts will only talk to you” Sirius said. Harry had no idea what to think all this was a lot to take in. He knew though that he would not let that mad man anywhere near him or his school.
After making sure that the only people who could deal with the Potter vaults were Remus and Sirius and Harry when he came of age.
Everyone though Draco was a stuck-up snob, he knew everyone called him the ice prince of Slytherin. For the most part people would be right, his father was a jerk who made sure he had the perfect heir.
He looked at Ron “I will try and respect you also, but I can’t make promises, If I had the power I would end the feud, but it is a binding one that can only end when the money is paid by your father” he said.
Later that night when Harry had tired himself out playing with his stuffed toy lion that Sirius had charmed to walk around and roar whenever Harry moved. Harry tired himself out walking around everywhere.
“Well kiddo Molly’s husband Author doesn’t like Dumbledore and anything he stands for; he has raised his sons different” he told Harry. “Well Percy looks up to Dumbledore and so does Ginny” Remus added. Lucius nodded his head “yes Arthur is not a bad person and has came to me in secret to hide the Weasley fortune from Molly” he told the kids.
A woman with dark brown hair curled around her ears stands, nodding politely at the cheers. Heartstringer. She looks sensible enough, with a flat expression, yet Draco can see the twinkle in her eyes from a mile away. Hopefully, she will be decent enough to let him pass the subject.
He pushes against him weakly for a few seconds, then resigns himself to the hug and the inevitable tears. In some way, it feels good to cry like this. He may give himself a headache and a snotty nose, but  with every sob, he feels himself getting freer. Harry holds him through it, rubbing his back and whispering comforts that Draco doesn’t really process, yet can appreciate.
Finally, Malfoy’s lips open. Silence. He makes a strangled noise, pale cheeks flushing, and instantly snaps his mouth shut again.
Tears are streaking down his father’s face too. “Can you forgive me, Draco? I didn’t mean for you to get hurt. I didn’t mean for it to ever get this bad. I wanted us to be happy, to be powerful, to be alive and together. He forced my hand, Draco, I knew he’d kill us all if I didn’t let him recruit you. I failed you. Please, my son, my beautiful boy, please forgive me!”
I’m too old. You said and father said and-
He winces, hurriedly turning to leave before a thought hits him. “Hey, Pans?”
“You’re welcome! Careful, there’s a-”
Now he has to tell Draco’s real mother that her son is dead.
“I’m sorry.” Sirius mutters from above him, fingers resting on his hair. He’d found Draco not long after his father had vanished, and had carefully led him over to a column, patting his back and trying to provide comfort despite having no idea why Draco was upset.
“What is it?”
Draco winces, feeling heat flood his cheeks. That. Years ago, when he’d still thought this strange obsession with Harry was hate, he’d been passing a girl in a corridor, Crabbe and Goyle following him. The girl had held the sweater, nervously trying to hide it. He’d taken it, laughed at her like the bully he was, and learnt she was going to return it to Harry. At first, he’d kept it so he could later use it for a prank, line it with a potion to cause boils or something similar. In all the panic of that year, he’d forgotten about it.
“Leave him, Pans.” Blaise smirks. “If you tell him to get up, he might just stay there out of spite."
“Sorry.” Harry bites his lip, forcing himself to turn away from the room. “Are you ready to go down?”
‘First, the spellcaster must prepare a meal dipped in the following potion, and offer it to the intended. If the intended accepts, the Votum spell cannot be cast. However, the spellcaster cannot explain to the intended that they should not accept, as this would reverse the spell to grant the spellcaster their worst fear.’
Hesitantly, he takes Harry’s hand and hauls himself up, blankets wrapped around his shoulders tightly. They make their way out of the common room, through the corridors and around staircases, ducking into rooms whenever teachers pass by. Technically, they’re allowed to wander around in the night, since it’s the holidays and they’re eighth years, but Harry had argued that it was more fun this way. Draco agrees, although he wouldn’t ever admit to it. This sort of thing is supposed to be far beneath him.
Thank you all so much for answering my questions! The majority have said they want....
"What are you doing here?" The Golden Boy jabs, and it's almost funny how annoyed he is, except it isn't. It really isn't, because Draco knows why he's annoyed. He would be annoyed too if the person who'd caused the death of so many friends was standing right in front of him.
Hesitantly, he drops his arm, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. His father is watching him with that cool mask, the one that means he’s trying to hide how lost he is. Draco starts thinking of ways to excuse it, thinks about shoving Harry away, thinks about how disappointed his father will be if he finds out.
Harry dumps his head on top of the page and groans. His eyes burn, his stomach growls, and some foggy part of him is getting convinced that he should just go and let Hermione do the work for him. A nice long sleep sounds perfect.
“Do you not want Draco there too?” Harry frowns, thinking back over any interaction Neville and Draco have had. He didn’t think they hated each other anymore. Sure, Neville was terrified of Draco’s bullying in the past, but Harry had thought everyone had gotten over that (ignoring Terry and Fletchley).
He shakes his head, feeling a little faint. How could he have never realised? Did he never doodle something and see it move? Then again, he was far too busy trying not to die to doodle lately, and the skill tends to come out around the age of sixteen. He’s read a few books on it.
Malfoy’s been in their room for a while, so he’s been crashing with Ron and Zabini. He can tell his presence there is a welcome relief, since Ron has stopped moaning about how obnoxious Zabini is every morning. Unfortunately, Zabini clearly doesn’t feel the same way, as his massive wardrobe has creeped slowly into the centre of the room, making it hard to move around in there. Even without that, Harry can see why Ron hates his roommate so much. Every morning, Zabini sets off three irritatingly loud alarms, and refuses to switch them off until both of them are up and out of the door. Parkinson’s always waiting outside, with fifty tonnes of makeup and clothes in her arms, and brushes past them into the room to start their daily makeover session. It would be cute if it wasn’t so bloody early.
The old man stared at Harry.
Harry chuckled. “You know I have a thing for blondes.”
The old man stepped on the tallest step, Harry following behind him. When the statue stopped rising, they were staring at a short corridor with a wooden door leading into a new room.
“Molly, you know as well as I do that I take Severus’ Wolfsbane Potion religiously around that time every month. Harry will be in no danger so long as I have that.”
on the front door.
You can’t be! You’re-”
Draco hadn’t seen his beloved son in exactly 10 years now, thanks to his bitch of an ex-wife. She had consistently sent back every single letter and postage Draco ever sent to Scorpius, and Draco never heard a thing from his son.
Draco and Harry go on a jog together, and make some plans for the day.
“Let’s keep the conversation vague, Harry, when in public. But, yes, that is the goal.”
Harry nodded. “And what is that? Hogwarts?”
Dumbledore cleared his throat.
But anyway, I LOVE comments. They're basically heroine for me. So please, please let me know if you like it! Even if you don't, I love constructive criticism! Thanks loves.
“Well, this book says to stir my potion five times counterclockwise with my wand.”
Remus’ look dampened a little.
He looked at it for a second. She looked up to his eyes.
“Ron ‘accidentally’ burned my copy of
That thought actually did a good job at holding him at bay, until
Remus sighed.
The professor’s eyes bore into Harry’s.
“Ah, my dear Petunia,
“What are you? To me, I mean? You said you’re my, what?”
The scenery of Hogwarts’ grounds was quite gorgeous, though. Birds fluttered through the air, chirps able to be heard over the panting of the two men as they made their way past the lake.
Harry blanched slightly at that.
“They weren’t murdered. They died in a car crash.”
He nudged James’ head, waking the snake up.
Harry was positively beaming after his first lesson with Professor McGonagall. However, that all took a dark turn once he entered the dungeons with Snape.
There was a small chime as he entered, but he could see no bell. It must be a charm, he figured.
He went far into the back of the shop and returned with a simple-looking box.
“So, then why are you on my doorstep in the middle of the night?”
Harry snorted, a curious look on his face. “Don’t you know? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
The old man looked towards Harry.
“Yes, Harry?”
“Licorice whips.”
Harry quickly flicked his hand, casting a silencing charm around them.
He soothed at her use of his name and he stood to follow her. He felt so out of place in the castle, being dressed in oversized jeans and tee shirt while following a full-grown witch in robes and a pointed hat. It was quite a trek to make it to what seemed to be her classroom - the castle was very large.
Scorpius would be 13 now, entering his third year at the illustrious school.
“Um, yeah. Getting it done early.”
Harry grimaced again. He’d reminded Snape of his proper last name numerous times during the lesson, but the professor hadn’t used it once.
Harry smiled a little oddly.
He gruffly shoved Harry aside and opened the door, pointing the shotgun right at the old man, who, for his part, seemed completely unfazed by the deadly weapon pointed at him.
The snake made a sound that could resemble a scoff.
“Can you describe my scar to me?”
Harry nodded slightly.
Harry looked at him.
I’ll see you in an hour.” Harry laughed.
The redheads recovered first. The man spoke.
They still looked slightly stunned, the black-haired man more so than the brown-haired one. The brown-haired one spoke up.
Dumbledore nodded.

Harry blanched.

He was never especially quiet about his sexuality - after all, for a boy with no experience with human friends or caring relatives, what did it matter to him that he told people who he truly loved? He never knew that loving anyone other than women was taboo.
Harry blushed slightly.
Harry sat on his bed, stunned.
Harry looked down, stomach dropping.
“I see! If you ever need help catching up, you can always send me a letter! I’d be more than happy to Floo over and tutor you.” She looked at Remus. “I’m staying in Ginny’s room for the rest of the summer since my parents are volunteering at some American hospitals.”
When he opened his eyes, he found everyone in the room staring at him in shock.
His eyes glanced up to Harry’s forehead, immediately becoming unfocused.
He looked around the alley they were in. It was damp and filthy.
Harry sighed. If today was any indicator, these lessons would not be working out in his favor.
“You are doing exceptionally well, Mister Evans. Despite your lack of incantations, or wandwork at all, you seem to be adept in magic even sixth years have struggled with. We will spend the rest of the practical work this summer focused on covering each spell individually that fifth years are expected to know, though I expect you to make short work of this curriculum. As for theoretical work, I would rather focus on the History of Magic material than on the theory behind wandwork and incantations, as I’m not sure they would provide any use to you. Besides, wandwork and incantation theory are not tested in either OWLs or NEWTs so much as being able to perform the spells, so you will have no issues on that front. Now, you are to make your way to the dungeons for your first Potions lesson with Professor Snape. Understood?”
Sirius gave a short bark, which Harry suspected was a laugh.
Harry nodded slightly, dumbfounded. The boy was strikingly gorgeous. He had long eyelashes that curled up beautifully. Both his jawline and cheekbones were immaculate and stone-cold. His eyes were steel and piercing. And his lips… Harry thought of what he wouldn’t give to make out with them.
Harry’s eyes widened in surprise. Standing before him was a very old man with a very long white beard. His face was wrinkled, and sitting on the edge of his crooked (clearly once broken) nose sat a small pair of reading glasses. He had a small cap on, and was wearing billowing red robes. He was a strange man to show up on your doorstep in the middle of the night.
The inside of the castle was even more medieval - and impressive, Harry thought privately - than the outside. Torch sconces, suits of armor, and complex paintings lined the wall.
Harry watched this in fascination.
“The other main thing to know about wands is that the wizard does not choose the wand. The wand chooses the wizard. Let’s see if there are any here that work for you.”
“If you know what’s good for you, you’ll leave us alone! We want nothing to do with

was a professor here?!
Harry nodded.
Harry shrugged and glanced at his alarm clock. 11:58PM. It was almost time.
They stepped through the fire, landing in a nicely decorated living room with a loveseat and plushy armchair. There was also a connected kitchen with a large dining table and new appliances.
Harry was measured for his robes while he thought about the enchanting boy he had just become friends with. Draco.
A flash of anger seared through Harry’s chest. He clenched his fists and his teeth, trying to stop his magic from lashing out in anger.
Remus shrugged.
“I see. Did you know…?”
While somewhere with the name “the Leaky Cauldron” didn’t sound very hospitable, Harry figured he’d give it a shot before making any judgements. After all, a place called “Hogwarts” ended up being a castle full of magic, so what frame of reference did he have for this world?
, did you hear? Simply fascinating. What is it that your parents do?”
The snake thought on this for a moment.
Harry looked at the ground.
“Not to worry, Harry. Charms conceal its true visage of only
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Master Black, this
Sirius blanched slightly, looking nervous.
“Nearly.”
“I see. Well, Harry, how would you like to be friends? I’m sure you could use someone to show you around Hogwarts once you arrive in September.”
“I’d imagine Snape didn’t give you the same call.”
“Please try this wand, Mister Evans.”
The old man kept his face passive, but Harry could tell he was holding back surprise. He grew up reading facial expressions to know when to avoid his uncle, aunt, or cousin.
When they returned to the quarters, sweat streaking in rivulets down Draco’s face, Potter gave him another smile.
In the room were so many people that Harry didn’t have time to really get a good look at any one of them before he was whisked into a chair. The whole room had fallen silent when the door opened, with most of the inhabitants staring at Harry in awe. One fellow with a sallow face and greasy black hair’s expression was closer to resentment than awe, however.
“But then, why didn’t you take custody of me after they died? Why was I left with my aunt and uncle?”
She bobbed her head.
She spent the whole of the afternoon testing his magical capabilities. From turning mice into pillows to spurting water from his hands to even being able to turn decidedly just the tip of his nose invisible, Harry aced all of her tests. By the time mid-afternoon came around, Professor McGonagall had a very impressed look upon her face.
He looked sheepish.
The old man nodded slowly.
“...And?” He drawled out the “a,” making him sound somewhat like an animal in a zoo.
“I get it. So, why didn’t he kill me too?”
“What are you... doing here? How do you know my name? Are you a stalker? If your plan is to hurt me, I promise you have another thing coming.”
“Want me to show you?”
Remus had a curious look in his eyes but nodded.
Sirius spoke up.
“Do you feel any nausea?”
“Well, it’s… It’s… My apologies, Harry. What were we talking about?”
The jog itself wasn’t too bad. Draco
dragon heartstring.”
“Quiet, woman! Harry need not know everything there is to know about our personal lives!”
“Um…”
The old man turned towards Harry.
“We still have some shopping to do, Hermione, but I look forward to seeing you in the classroom. And you are of course welcome at our home anytime.”
Upon reaching her class, she directed him to sit in the only chair-and-desk combo available while she sat in her chair behind the large desk at the front of the classroom.
“Are the paintings moving?”
“At least, that’s what
A loud scoff sounded from the back of the room. A man, giant in stature, was practically hidden amongst the shadows.
He took his time to pick out a wand, muttering to himself. Finally he decided on one, but the minute Harry’s hand got close to it a small jolt of electricity shot out of it at him.
Harry nodded sullenly. He could’ve left the Dursleys years ago, been involved in a world of magic and, maybe, love. Instead, he suffered under their harsh treatment and never knew of his heritage.
He sat down, looking at everyone else.
wasn’t gasping for air by the end of it as he and Potter made their way back to his quarters in the dungeons. Certainly not.
Hi everyone! I had a burst of inspiration today and wrote way more than I normally do. I don't want to get your hopes up that I'll always write this much.
“Don’t even start, Sirius. The boy needs a good, stable home to stay in.”
“Yeah, so… what’s Transfiguration?”
bit of magic.”
The giant nodded, settling back into his corner again. The man turned back to Harry.
Padfoot looked up at Harry as he left the shop, tail wagging. Harry was tired but smiled at his godfather.
“I see. You share more than your last name with your mother, though. You have her eyes.”
“Are we done?”
“Very well, professor. It’s a slow day anyway. Call when you need me!” She disappeared into the back.
If the room could have possibly gotten more silent, it would have.
. I was in the graveyard, watching as the Dark Lord was resurrected after the murder of Barty Crouch. And if you still doubt me, how could you explain the reactivation of the Mark?” The man pulled up his left sleeve to reveal a dark tattoo, which was a skull with a snake swirling around in his mouth. James hissed at it.
The rest of the people in the room introduced themselves.
“Yes, Harry. Paintings and pictures move in the wizarding world.”
There were two distinct
“I’m glad we did that, Draco. What’s your plans for today?”
That snapped Harry out of his reverie and he nodded. He continued walking, the old man quickly taking the lead again.
Mumbles broke out across the room.

picked out the name, James had done that himself. But still.
Harry stared at him blankly.
Harry turned to James, a questioning look in his eyes.
“No, dear boy, I am not here to harm you or your loved ones.”
Diagon Alley. We are at a registered apparition point in Muggle London. This alley has been charmed to keep Muggle attention focused away from it so that we can enter the Leaky Cauldron discreetly. That’s where we’ll enter Diagon Alley.”
Draco makes an unexpected acquaintance at his first meal, with a promise for further interaction.
“This can’t last forever. Once I turn 18, we’ll get out of here.”
Harry nodded.
The moment the advert had been placed in the Daily Prophet, Draco had sent an owl to inform Minerva McGonagall of his intentions to apply for the position and his qualifications. She had sent a response back letting him know the time for the interview, which had been over a month ago.
“Harry, may I ask why you were trying to cook breakfast this early?” He had slight bags under his eyes, his face looking a little more gaunt than normal. He was obviously tired after the long night last night, and being woken up at this time didn’t do him any favors.
“Get out of the way, boy!”
“Sorry, Molly.”
“Thank you Remus. I’ll probably go to bed now.”
Several people eyed the greasy-haired man.
“Yes, well, we had best be leaving too, Albus. I’ll see you soon.”
At that exact moment, eight hours ahead of his time, Sybill Trelawney sat up in her bed, having experienced a vision of a power surge in America.
“Ah, of course. I should have... remembered.”
“Remus?”
She shot her gaze over to him.
. That is Kreacher’s job!” The creature - or Kreacher? - crossed its arms. Sirius scowled at him.
Harry nodded, a blush tinging his cheeks again.
Harry sat down in a chair at 9:55AM, looking around at the empty office. Remus and Sirius had woken up just in time to see him off and wish him luck, and he responded with a wave before turning in on himself.
James sat curled around his shoulders, dozing peacefully. It was 11:55PM, July 30th. Harry was about to turn 15 years old.
Ollivander opened his eyes and nodded again.
He turned to give another small smile to Harry while Madam Malkin bagged up his purchases. She handed it to him and he left the building, the small
Remus cleared his throat.
The old man’s eyes narrowed upon seeing James.
“Yes, Potter?”
It was, all in all, a very strange experience for Harry. Especially since he was normally expected to eat last, waiting for Dudley to wake up and have his many portions of it. Usually there wasn’t an abundance left for Harry, often just enough to keep the growling in his stomach to a minimum.
The man’s eyes twinkled.
Harry chuckled.
The snake looked at him, narrowing its eyes.
James hissed loudly.
Harry shuffled his feet, embarrassed at all the racket caused.
Harry grumbled, pissed off at everything.
Ollivander nodded gravely.

“I, uh, cast a charm on it. Notice-Me-Not. Again, don’t want undue attention.”
“Did… Was that you?”
Harry shook his head.
right into the kitchen, startling Sirius who was hard at work over the stove.
“They… weren’t something I was allowed to ask about.”
“Um… Professor?”
Harry nodded. He paid for the wand with some of the coins in his pouch and exited the shop.
, Remus! Can any wizard do that?”
He didn’t get nearly enough time practicing trading spells off with Remus before Sirius called up that lunch was ready, but he was definitely starved.
“Harry, you know the overall goal of our, shall we say, club?”
It was startling.
related to combat, and I wanted to see if I could do this shielding stuff she mentioned.”
Both Harry and Remus turned to see a dark-skinned teenage girl with glistening, coiled black hair walk excitedly towards them. Her smile was toothy and sweet. Remus’ eyes lit up at the sight of her.
“He has his own ways of blending in in public. Just… be prepared for what may happen whenever we speak to another witch or wizard. Dumbledore wasn’t joking when he said your story is legendary. Every child raised since that fateful night has grown up hearing stories of your defeat of You-Know-Who, and adults everywhere praised his defeat exuberantly. We may be stopped here or there, but so long as your scar stays mostly out of sight, hopefully people won’t put two and two together too easily.”
“Yes, Harry?”
“Harry does not need to be a
“I’m sorry for her behavior, gentlemen. I promise she only has Harry’s best interests at heart.”
Madam Malkin called Draco to the counter, where she had a pile of robes waiting for him. He placed two stacks of golden coins on it.
Harry scoffed.
Draco scowled again. It’s almost as if Harry
“Vernon. As charming as ever. May I ask why you didn’t inform me of your move to America?”
He turned to Sirius.
“What was his name? I’ve probably taught him.”
“Now then, Harry. I will go draw some money from Gringotts. Why don’t you and Padfoot go to Madam Malkin’s and get fitted for some robes? I’ll meet you there and pay for the selection.”
He stood up and started picking up his stuff, throwing it into a rucksack. He didn’t truly have any “personal” memorabilia, as everything was either a hand-me-down from Dudley or stolen, which was useful but not exactly personal.
Draco stared at Harry open-mouthed before he promptly shut it.
Dumbledore shook his head.
Remus placed a hand on Sirius’ shoulder, placating him. Harry could tell the men were closer than friends. Curious.
“Hermione, this is Harry. He’ll be starting in your year this September. This will be the first time he’s attended a school for magic.”
world. You have no right to keep him here.”
Soon they came upon a statue of a large eagle, wings curled protectively around itself.
“Well, I don’t go by my father’s name, even though everyone knows me by it. I’m just trying to lie low for now. Don’t want any attention.”
Remus and Sirius turned towards Harry.
“I will not tolerate that kind of language in my classroom, Mister Evans. And it is
“I… I think I can. What’s your name? I'm Harry.”
required for.” With that, Snape went back to his paper.
“What’s going on, then, brat?”
Remus glanced at Harry disapprovingly, but chose not to be the one responsible for Harry’s proper use of language. He’d leave that to Minerva.
"Understood, Mister Malfoy. I look forward to your next visit."
“There’s a lot to discuss with you, Harry. James was your father’s name.”
Remus put a sly smile on his face.
“I’ve never known anyone with that name.”
Harry Evans was born an odd boy, but it took a long time for him to figure it out. He was treated as an "other" in his house; he cooked the meals, did the laundry, cleaned the house. He had a set routine every day that left him little time to himself, but how was he to know this wasn't normal?
He closed his eyes as he drank deeply, appreciating the sweet, sugary taste of the drink.
“It’ll be fine. Besides, if they’re threatening I can just set them on fire. Or lift them up into the air and lob them away, like that crazy lady at the supermarket the other day.”
“Um… dude?”
The door creaked open -
“I’ll be right with you! And please do stay still, Mister Malfoy!”
Then, they were standing in front of a huge castle. As it was still the middle of the night, the whole thing was dark except for lights in some windows here and there.
“Well then. Let’s see what you can do. How about you turn this needle into a matchstick?” She walked over to his desk and placed a lone silver needle on it.
“You probably do. Remus Lupin? Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts?”
“You called it ‘teleportation.’”
“Lucky me.”
“What of it?”
A red-haired man’s eyes lit up.
A moment later, they were teleporting. It was the same feeling as Harry was used to at this point.
Draco scowled. He grabbed his wand and cast a
“Please, Hagrid.”
Harry nodded again. She waved her hand, permitting him to ask them.
And so the man did, going back to his business.
Remus shouted “
Harry hummed in understanding. He looked towards the brown-haired man and the mustachioed man. “Who are you two?”
Harry talks to a creepy old man on his doorstep. Revelations ensue.
Harry thought over this, then shrugged.
Professor McGonagall had covered the basics behind the three Unforgivable Curses, which actually was what gave Harry the idea for this particular power. He had tried it on her, telling her to hand him a quill so he could write down the names of certain spells. She hadn’t seemed to remember the command had been given nor that she had followed it, so Harry deemed this spell to be a very worthwhile one. He wasn’t sure how powerful it was or how physical the commands had to be - for instance, could he tell Snape to treat him like any other student? However, he suspected that if it indeed worked that this would be suspicious to the others, so Harry refrained from trying to change something so core to Snape’s personality.
Both Harry's and Madam Malkin's eyebrows rose, his because of Draco's kindness and hers because of two expensive orders in one day.
There was no way she could reject him, right? He knew - better than anyone - what his family did and what his name meant to the wizarding world. But he also knew that Minerva would be hard-pressed to find someone with qualifications better than him.
Draco nods.
As if this day couldn’t get any worse, Potter starts yelling at them. Draco wishes he could sink into the floor and disappear forever. Not only is the pain in his ribs starting to make him think he’s got a broken rib that will pierce his heart and kill him, but the pain of possibly having to now fight off Potter is making him feel woozy. Or maybe that’s the knock to the head from when he first fell.
The other boy looks at him curiously, tension melting, then pulls up his sleeve. The Dark Mark twists against his arm, faded ink writhing as though in pain, but there’s another line around it. White ink, marked on in a circle of flowers around the Dark Mark. It shines in the sunlight, iridescent and glowing.
“Draco, love, Theodore needs people to go to. All the compartments are full, and those filthy Gryffindors are stalking the corridors like bloodhounds. You don’t mind, right?”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“No. I suspect he was sent to Limbo.” Theo collapses into a chair, grabbing one of the cups and taking a sip, only to grimace at how cold it is. “And if we find a descendant of Vizzini’s son, we can get him back.”
Back to the common room.
‘Smoke?’ He draws out, looking between them.
As always, any questions or ideas or just random babbles are always appreciated.
“Right.” Remus narrows his eyes. “Well, I would suggest looking in the library, if you’re allowed in the Forbidden Section. There’s a few books on mind magic, and I’ll owl you any books I find in this place. Please, Harry, don’t actually test out the spells. You don’t know what damage it could do.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Her heels click against the floor as she walks away, leaving him in the dark and the silence once more.
Then he’s gone, shattering into white light that melts into the floor and the walls, leaving Draco bitterly alone again, unspoken words caged in his throat. He sinks into himself, heart throbbing. His father is gone, forever.
All of your ideas were amazing! You've given me such inspiration that I think I might do draco-centric fics during my large gakushuu-centric fic, and I'll probably be keeping them to about 10 to 15 chapters each, just so my motivation doesn't run itself dry.
“How so?” Lupin glances up at her, as though he doesn’t know, as though it hasn’t been splashed over every newspaper in the UK.
In the end, the ministry lets Black go without trial. Draco has a feeling that’s only because Poppy threw a fit when asked if he could be moved. The poor woman has been running around all of the past few weeks, tending to their needs as well as dealing with the day to day injuries around the school. With the Christmas break in full swing, there has been less than usual, but he’s seen far too many students come in with a broken limb from falling on the ice.
I'm kinda tired from school starting up again, so this chapter might be all over the place. It's more lighthearted than Draco's view of the world, just to give you a break from the misery, and to show you not everyone is completely ruined by the war.
They’d borrowed the projector and film from Mr Weasley, who’d been clearing out some of his muggle junk thanks to Mrs Weasley. The painted animals in the common room took offense to it at first, hissing and clawing at the lines of where the projection began, but soon they got bored and wandered off. Draco doesn’t understand the plot of the film much (all of the characters seem pretty stupid in his opinion), so he’d zoned out quite a while back in favour of relishing in the warmth from Harry.
Ron quickly stuffs the remains into his mouth, making Neville marvel at how it seems to disappear as fast as the leaves of a Chameleon Flysnap. With that sorted, they stand and make their way to the front of the hall.
Draco takes Luna’s tea absentmindedly, draining it in one long depressed sip. He’d always assumed he’d die before he grew up. Now he thinks about it, the future is just as unsteady as the war had been.
“How are you here?” His father’s grey eyes flick over him, hand dropping to rest by his side. “I thought- But you were at Hogwarts- You should have been safe!”
Harry flushes. “What? No! I was just packing up my stuff, saying goodbye to the room, y’know?”
Shaking his head, Harry pushes his legs to their limit trying to keep up. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the bizarreness of Hogwarts.
The Dark Mark. He hates it. He can feel how poisonous it is, sense when it creeps up to Draco’s head and slides inside his brain. He wants it gone.
Her sewing rests in her lap, head resting back against the armchair she’s sat in on his right. Someone’s put a cushion under her head, letting her sleep without acquiring a painful neck once she wakes. Small mercies, really. He hadn’t been quite sure what to do when she’d appeared not long after Lupin, eyes wide and disbelieving. She’d thought he was gone for good. That hurts more to him than the occasional stab of pain in his arm, or the flashbacks. All his life, he’s tried to protect her from all of that, whether it be waving a stick at imaginary monsters or working to kill his headteacher so the Dark Lord wouldn’t hurt her.
With every word, Draco feels his heart tighten. Forgiveness. How can he forgive him? His father had put him in impossible positions again and again, taught him hate and fear and prejudice from the moment he was born, spat at him and glared at him and cursed him until Draco did exactly as he was told. His father was the one who’d lead him down this path of destruction and pain and death. How can he forgive him?
“Harry!” Hermione calls, ignoring the odd dip in volume as she brings Draco over to him. “Do you remember where you put Draco’s old wand?”
“Young master Draco always want to be taken back here, Mister Potter, sir. He never walk here on his own, sir, not with those legs, Gobsy thinks. Young master Draco always needing help with everything. Gobsy thinks young master Draco was waiting to die, sir.” Gobsy’s eyes fill with tears, hands trembling. “Poor young master Draco. Mistress and Gobsy happy he went. The creepy crawly shadows not good for him, mister Potter, sir. Always creeping in his head.”
Maybe if he hadn’t been so suspicious back then, he could have helped Draco more. Maybe he wouldn’t have cast that spell.
Hermione taps her foot, listening to the shuffling inside the room. She should start bringing a book to read here, honestly. Twenty minutes is far too much time wasted.
On second thought, maybe not.
Hesitantly, he pokes it with his wand. Was that a twitch? Or just his imagination? It’s hard to tell with the light, so he squints closer, and then a brighter light floods across the page and he turns to thank whoever it is and stares up at Luna and Theodore in the doorway.
“Was anyone else in the room with you?”
Fuck.
“What about Draco? I thought you two were going to move in together?” Luna tilts her head, voice light and curious.
Harry nods, closing his eyes to try and process that. Vizzini, mad spells, sent to a safe place, descendant to get them back. To get Draco back. “Theodore… does this mean we can save Draco?”
“Malfoy, can you hear me?”
“Blaise, darling, sweetheart, lovely rose of my soul.” Pansy drifts in next to them, slipping her arm through Blaise’s. “Your intelligence and bravery take my breath away, and I’ve never seen anyone with better fashion sense than you, my-”
Alarmed, he opens his eyes and sits up suddenly, a wave of dizziness crashing over him, even brighter sparks flashing in his eyes than the blinding white light. He doesn’t know where he is. The room is huge, arches crossing high above him, white and blank. As his eyes adjust, he sees he’s wearing a plain white shirt and shorts, but there’s no bandages over his dark mark. In fact, there’s not even a dark mark there.
He pushes himself to his feet hastily, brushing down his robes. They need a thorough wash after today. The gaps looms in front of him as he marches towards it, shuts his eyes, and waits for the tingle of magic.
There’s a slight click, then a creak, and Pansy has to peek around the corner, just to be sure. But it is. The door of Draco’s room is open, and Potter, anxiety written across his ridiculously stupid face, is stepping inside. The door clicks shut behind him.
Potter. That fucking lunatic. Pansy knows she appears crazed from the frightened looks she’s getting, but that dungheap of a wizard has crossed the line. First, he decides he likes Draco, so evidently he set all of this up just so he could get him.
Harry winces at the bitter tone of her voice, heart plummeting at her words. Lucius really is dead, then. How can he tell her about Draco now?
A bit of a short chapter, this time, but I think the next one will be longer. I have the final plan in my mind, so there may only be about five(?) chapters left. Don't worry, though! There will probably be more, knowing me, and there's always going to be my shorter fanfics being uploaded.
His friends tough he was staying at Hogwarts for Christmas but really, he went home with Draco, at the time they were friends who admitted to liking each other.
Before Harry or Draco could say anything, Ron piped up “I don’t like Malfoy and that will not change, no matter how much you want it to Harry I am truly sorry Malfoy can explain it better then me. I will respect your decision and try to get along with him to the best of my ability because I want you to be happy” Ron said quietly.
Sirius nods, unable to find words as Remus takes the letter guiding him to the bed where Remus laid down and pulled Sirius down with him, laying him on his chest as he rubbed his hand though his hair, “do you want to read it now or later.”
Amelia looked at the couple and asked if they wanted to keep her name or change it. Lucius looked at his wife and they agreed.
Remus nodded his head softly, he would have talked more but the door opened and Gurlok came back in and told them that the family was free to leave, and everything was done.
Now that his father was in Azkaban and Draco was named Lord Malfoy he was determined to bring the Malfoy name back to what it was when his grandfather Abraxas was alive.
They got to Harry’s room and opened the door and discovered Lily laying on the floor against Harry’s crib and Voldermort sprawled crossed the floor eyes grazed over with death. They knew without a checking for a pulse that she was dead. Their hearts broke, and both wanted to cry but they had more important things to worry about right now.
Remus pulled out the will and passed it to Gurlok “this is the will of James and Lily Potter who died last night at the hands of Voldermort” He said sadly. Gurlok took the paper and once he did the paper unrolled itself and you heard a light and paper appeared. He knew this will was to be a real one because that was the spell goblins used when someone came for a will made from them.
Once they were outside they were greeted by a familiar voice, “Good evening gentlemen, chilly night tonight.” They looked up and were greeted by a smiling Albus Dumbledore. He smiled at them but both men knew not to trust that smile. He walked up the them and held out his hands “now boys give e Harry, I saw the inside. Voldermort may be dead but his followers will still peruse Harry for revenge. They will suspect a wizard family first, he would be safest with his aunt Petunia” Dumbledore said smiling.
She looked at the baby ‘so tell me about that little one” she asked.
Draco stared at the little girl and slowly leaned up and kiss her forehead and said he loved her.
Narcissa smiled “hello Remus it is very nice to meet you, and this little boy his so cute, he looks just like you Sirius” she said smiling.
Sirius nodded his head, “the oath won’t let me do anything rash, now let’s go.”
“No when you sign these papers Harry will be both of your responsibilities, now if you both where to get married and wanted to adopt him by blood then we would do that here” he told both men.
“You came into the wizarding world demanding for muggle-borns and the traditions you loved in the muggle world to be celebrated here. You never once learned or even though that wizards have our own traditions and or ideals. You get mad when people call you a mudblood and I get it but you never asked anyone why you where called that. You are ignorant of the world you live in and claim to love, you are also very prejudiced against anyone who you believe is wrong. You never once took the time to maybe ask why I acted the way I did” he said to her.
Harry walked over to Slytherin’s table and sat down and waited for the sorting to be done, once Blaise was sorted and sat beside his right side, they waited for Dumbledore to talk so they could eat. After what seemed like forever, they could eat, they ate till they could not eat anymore.
It was the end of January and this whole week Harry has been missing when he or Hermione has been looking for him. That wasn’t anything new since they got back from Christmas break Harry would go missing for a couple of hours.
Draco grabbed Harry’s face and gave him a soft kiss on the lips, pulling back he looked at Harry “I am fine with telling anyone you want to tell. As long as I get to call you mine” He told Harry.
Narcissa smiled and told them that their daughters would go to Hogwarts together, they would be best friends.
Lucius and Narcissa flooed into Amelia Bones office “Come on in and sit down we have a lot to talk about” Amelia said softly.
Both men nodded their head smiling softly, Narcissa told a house elf to get Draco’s things ready for a night away.
Walking to the atrium to floo back to Malfoy Manor was crazy for Narcissa, she was mad and upset when Lucius told her what he did.
Gurlok looked at both men and pushed the goblet toward the two men “First did you bring the items I asked you to bring” the goblin asked the two men.
Tears poured as he sobbed remembering the sight of Lilly sprawled on the floor. “Forgive me my friends, I shouldn’t have trusted Peter,” he sobbed into his hands. As he shed his tears he felt something fall into his lap.
Sirius walked over to the crib and saw his god son crying. He picked Harry up and walked back to Remus ricking the baby trying to get him to calm down. They both walked back downstairs, out of the house into the cold autumn air.
The night that Sirius had been both dreading and anticipating had finally arrived, they were going to Malfoy Manor to have dinner with his cousin. He wasn’t sure how this would turn out, but he had hoped that it would work out for the better cause Narcissa was his cousin and to the Blacks family meant everything.
Remus nodded and lifted Harry so Sirius to prick his finger, Sirius made sure 3 drops of blood landed on the parchment, and then he healed his sons finger.
“So Narcissa was something wrong last night and is everything ok” Remus asked.
He turned to Draco and smiled “the beginning of December he told me he liked me and wanted to take me out but knew people wouldn’t understand. We went on dates in the Room and Requirement and I went to spend Christmas with him” Harry said as he turned back around to his friends.
Remus just looked at Sirius “what did you do” he asked his husband?
Remus had put a part of his magic into that rune, and then crushed it up and mixed his blood with the rune and put it in the potion and mixed it all up.
“He wanted us to take and adopt her because we have Harry and we know how to take care of a little girl. He had the papers already all we had to do was sign them and send them to the ministry” Remus said.
After a big Blaise, Pansy and Theo found them and put their stuff away and they were off to Hogwarts. Harry told his friends what his fathers told him; he knew he needed his friends in on what was happening. He trusted these people and knew they would be there for him no matter what.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and took the paper and quill and signed it, a bright light shinned from the paper for a minute and then disappeared. Gurlok smiled “congratulations on becoming the guardians of Harry James Potter” he told both men as he took the paper and put it with the folder of the will.
Harry for his part just sat there and knew that things were not great, but it was the best he could do right now. His boyfriend was trying and for Draco that was all he could ask for, he understood where his boyfriend stood with Hermione and wasn’t going to make them become friends.
Together the apparated to the field outside of James and Lily’s house. Walking up to the house they saw the door blasted open. They drew their wands and ran inside to find James lying on the floor battered. Sirius rushed over checking for a pulse, “Damn it!” He groaned when he didn’t find one.
Both men knew life would be hard but for Harry they would make sure he had a life full of love and laughter.
year they found out that all the returning students would share a common room.
“Now,” Sirius’s voice came out choked and cracked but also firm in resolve.
Narcissa was saddened by that, she hated when people lost their lives, well people who where good and didn’t deserve it.
“I didn’t realize until too late that James would have still been my friend even though I though different things. As for being a direct descendent of Merlin I didn’t know, my father never told me, all he said was our family was the most powerful pureblood families around and we had to keep the traditions and rituals and to always be proud to be a Black” Sirius said.
“Now the heritage sheet for that we will need some of Harry’s blood” Gurlok said.
“I understand that this is a sensitive subject, but I have a 5-month-old baby who by a spell says she is your daughter. Please explain how she can be your kid, and how she ended up in the hands of muggles” Amelia asked.
He smiled and thanked his telling them they were the best in the world, He watched them walk out the door slowly.
“having even two of the houses of Hogwarts makes you owner of it plus the power they give you themselves is something else. Plus, Harry the money that James had, you see the Potter’s made sleek easy’s Hair potion and they still own it to this day” Remus said. Harry was shocked at that he knew all about it everyone used that, but he had no idea who owned it. “you see your great grandfather made it, rather then selling it like he had the option to he kept it and kept it in the family” Sirius said.
Remus opened his eyes to the morning light shining into the bedroom, he looked over at the black-haired man in his arms. His husband oh how that sounded so wonderful, they decided to get married quietly at the ministry with Harry with them.
Dinner was a calm affair with everyone eating and talking about random things until Lucius asked a question.
Hermione put her hand on his and smiled up at him trying to calm him down “Ron honey maybe he is in his room” she told her boyfriend.
They spent 3 hours getting clothes, furniture, toys and everything else they would need to raise a little girl.
After breakfast both kids went up to their rooms to get dressed, Remus yelled for them to brush their teeth also. Sirius and Remus were waiting by the fireplace for the kids to get down so they could go to Malfoy Manor. The first to run down the steps was Harry dressed in his black robe with the Black crest on it, and on his hand was his heir ring that Sirius had given to him this morning at the table.
Draco smiled and nodded his head not fully understanding, all he knew was he has a sister now.
He knew that Sirius was a Black just by looking at him, he had the signature Black hair, and dark skin tone that the Black family were known for. He also had those grey eyes that Narcissa, Bella, and Andy had.
Remus cradled Harry in his arms while Sirius handed the parchment back to the goblin, the wait seemed forever.
He landed in an expansive room with white walls and beautiful dark wood floors, he cleaned the soot from himself and Harry and looked around the room they where in in amazement at how beautiful the room was.
Sirius woke up to the smell of pancakes and slowly got out of bed, he looked over at the bassinet finding it empty he freaked out for a second but heard a giggle downstairs and knew where Harry was.
Ron for his part was embarrassed by his own mother, he also did not like Dumbledore the only ones in his family that liked the man were Percy, their mother and Ginny. He had heard them talking and to hear them plant a friend and they also thought that Ron would do that.
As the four adults where talking Harry and Draco where sitting away from each other looking at each other and giggling.
Sirius and Remus where shocked at the last one neither one of them knew that about Lily though that one came as a shock.
They were led down to the dungeons and got told the password was Salazar and when the wall opened, they walked in. Waiting for them was a man who was wearing all black, his hair was black also. “Welcome to Slytherin house I am the head of house Severus Snape, here we are family. Make sure you remember that one, do not do anything stupid, if you want to do something don’t get caught. My door is always open for you whenever you need me, now go find your rooms” he said.
Remus and Sirius knew things where bad. Voldermort had this crazy idea that Harry was going to kill him because seer saw it and had told someone. Severus Snape, the little bat had run to his master and told him when he heard it. Voldermort blamed Harry and now wanted the blood of his god son.
He heard a giggle in his mind “yes I can understand you and I will talk to you whenever I have something to say to you. Also, if you ever need protection just call on me and I will protect you” the voice said. “Now that you are here, I can begin to repair myself” she said, he asked her what she meant. She had told him that Dumbledore let her go, the Headmaster was able to keep her up, but he would not do the spell every morning to keep her up.
She knew they had a lot to do today and she was excited to do it, she needed to make a list of things they would need.
Just as everyone calmed down a house elf came and said dinner was ready, everyone walked into the dinning room and sat down laughing.
Ron nodded his head and kissed her lips softly and stood up to make his way up to the dorm room that he shared with Harry.
Remus went to get the tea that had finished and brought it into the living room and poured him and Sirius a cup.
Gurlok looked at the two men “I feel that we should wait to go over it when you both decide if you want to adopt him” the tiny goblin said.
“So, Sirius are you still going to be an auror” he asked.
“Now what do you want to do with the baby” Amelia asked the Malfoys slightly nervous of the answer.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other not knowing what to say on one hand both here upset that Harry kept a relationship from them, and with Malfoy of all people. On the other you could just look at them and see the love between them.
Sirius for his part sneered at Molly and was about to say something when Harry beat him to it “Mrs. Weasley my name is Harrison Orion Black thank you very much” he said with a sneer in his voice. Draco for his part was smirking hearing Harry put this woman in her place, he did not say anything because he knew Harry could handle himself just fine.
Sirius though it over “or we could change his middle name to Orion after my father, then it will be less suspicious. We can still go with Remus’s idea but say he has my father’s middle name to honor my father who I loved also” Sirius said.
Walking into Gringotts was always an adventure for Harry and Draco, seeing all the people around and waiting in line. Watching the lady yelling for some reason and then the guards taking her away. Both boys watched Sirius talking to a man and then they were all being led into a room. When they sat down Harry had to sit in front beside his fathers, he wanted Draco beside him, but he sat behind him.
Just as dinner got done an own flew into the dinning room and landed beside Lucius, he took the letter that was attached to the owl’s leg and the owl flew off.
He realized he was losing his best friend the beginning of the summer after fourth year, he sat Harry down and talked to him about everything. The friendship slowly got stronger and by the time they started fifth year the two of them where best friends again.
James made sure Sirius swore on a wizard’s oath not to do anything stupid should something happen. James knew that if something where to happen that Sirius would do something stupid and get himself in trouble.
Narcissa just nodded her head quietly, Lucius looked at Sirius and Remus “I am sorry to cut this short, but something came up and we have to go to the ministry” he said in a daze.
“Now Sirius the Blacks are a direct descendent of Salazar Slytherin, and Merlin himself” Gurlok said.
Finding his room was easy he was rooming with Draco, Blaise, Theo and Goyle and Crabbe, the last two boys he had no idea who they were. They all brushed their teeth and got in pajama’s Harry decided he would write his fathers tomorrow he was tired and wanted to sleep.
Ron told Hermione he would go and investigate the dorm room and see if Harry was there.
The little family saw the Malfoy’s and walked over to them and Luna went to Hermione and hugged her. Harry went to Draco and smiled at him, both boys were excited to head to Hogwarts. Hugs were exchanged and promised of letters, Luna and Hermione crying cause their big brothers were leaving them. Goodbyes were said again and both boys walked to the train and got in and found an empty compartment and put their stuff in. They waited for their friends to get there, while they waited, they talked about random things.
They both looked at Harry knowing whatever they where going to hear they might not like but whatever it was they would allow Harry to explain himself, so with that idea in mind both nodded their heads.
So sorry it has taken me awhile to put up a new chapter, the characters have decided to change up my whole plot, so I have a new idea and I will admit  the new plot is better then the old plot. I hope to have chapter 3 up sooner then this one was, I am writing now, and my cousin will edit it and then I will get it up after. Please feel free to comment if you have questions or ideas. Subscribe if you want and leave kudo's if you so desire and bookmare if you please. Thank you to everyone who has done any of those it means alot to me and my cousin. I can't tag him because he doesn't have an account on here. Now I will quit with the note and onto the story.
“Remus, I-”
He rolls his eyes, but does them up anyway. “Anything for your slender hand.”
Suddenly, a loud bang startles the two of them, saving him from having to explain that awkward secret. They whip their heads to face the noise, and dissolve into laughter when they see it’s only the two boys at Hagrid’s setting off fireworks. There’s faint yelling from some teacher out of a window, and the two figures sprint back into the cabin, letting the sparkling dragon twist about in the air.
