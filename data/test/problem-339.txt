It wasn't so boring, though. Hermione's really quite nice. She reminds him, in many ways, of himself.
Draco lowers his head again to catch the other boy's gaze, hungry, but open and honest in a way that lets Draco see straight into his soul.
walk away, but only a few paces. He drops his bag carelessly onto the ground, then he lowers himself down next to it, back resting against an old tree trunk. He looks at Draco, expectant.
"Yes, after." Draco clears his throat. Apologising doesn't seem so scary now, more awkward than anything else. But Harry beats him to the punch.
Color fills Draco's cheeks when he realises his mistake. "I'm- you weren't there. In class. We- I, wanted to know you were alright."
It seems, to Draco at least, Harry knows exactly why he's here. To fulfill whatever saviour complex he's developed, through the medium of Draco.
"Hello." Hermione's whispered greeting to Harry is forced and overly-cordial; it makes Draco wrinkle his nose in disgust. Her gently inclined head, barely an acknowledgement of him, shoots even more cool ice into his heart. She hates him, he knew she would, and she does.
But he doesn't get to finish the sentence, because his world twists and turns and falls away in front of his eyes, the stars tumble over each other in a hasty dash to fall out of the sky and into his lap, the waves change their direction and crash against the sand with all the ferocity of a lioness.
"A little bit." Draco clenches his jaw, but Harry presses his lips against his cheek. "No, not like that. I miss talking to her. We always fight, and I just miss when we didn't; we really were good friends before. I'll always care about her, but, I dunno, I think i'll always miss her like that too."
"I dunno ... maybe, Ron. I hardly have it all planned out in my calendar." Harry huffs, annoyed by the line of questioning. Honestly, he hadn't thought that far. Though he supposes it would be nice to not have to designate seperate timings for his friends. Ron on Wednesdays, Draco on Fridays has the potential to get  a little sticky.
The whole point of separating the 8th year dorms was to discourage House chauvinism, but Harry doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. His bed, rug, and curtains are discordantly red and gold when compared with the the rather dull, monochromatic tone of the rest of the room. In the far east corner, a handful of wooden chairs have been pushed out of the way into a haphazard pile. When Draco cranes his neck to look over the bed, he notices the muggle weight training equipment scattered on the floor in front.
Or maybe it's fate that does so, because Harry's waiting for him, fist raised like he's about to knock as soon as he opens the door.
Draco didn't get off scot-free. One of the terms upon his reentry into Hogwarts was the assigned weaker, duller wand. His one is still at the manor, itching to be used, while he's instead stuck with a barely functional stick.
The electrifying touches, the possessiveness, the concern and the care. The revelation makes Draco sway on his feet, forcing him to sit heavily on the nearest chair.
Draco's nights are frequently host to nightmares. It's alright, Draco's gotten used to it. But it really does become an inconvenience during the day, when he's running on less than five hours sleep, and his god-forsaken wand isn't accurate enough to perform the intricate spell required for energy.
Draco, of course, knows this. In fact, he was going to repeat a similar statement to him as an apology. But Harry saying it just irks him.
He just has to get through a few more hours of this torturous waiting, before he can run to the lake after class.
"I'm sorry- " Harry says, sounding not at all sorry. "It's just- the great Slytherin prince, unable to skip a stone."
The quite literal dark tunnel he'd started to tire from walking down opens up to a burst of light at the end, making for a disgustingly fitting metaphor
Draco hesitates. He doesn't know why, really. Probably due to his stubborn aversion to help. And probably in an equally large part due to his better judgment somehow turning to mush when Potter's too close to him.
Book, picture frames, clothes and various other objects litter the floor. Actually, Draco's not entirely sure there still
Harry's rigid again, simultaneously firm and slouched, muscles worn and tired. Hermione's eyes widen in recognition.
"You don't have to do that." Hermione says curtly, tossing her hair over her shoulder. She sets her eyes on Harry's, so that he's forced to look at her, forced to be truthful. "I know you two are...
Draco stands there, dumbstruck, because what the hell does Harry think he's doing. They've got class tomorrow, and he's here, asking Draco to drop everything and go with him anywhere.
"Harry- where are we going!" Draco asks quietly as they rush through the corridors, guided by Harry's wand-light. He doesn't get anything from Harry but a wry smile, and a whispered "
Draco's one of the first to enter, a wide smile stretching across Slughorn's face when he greets him.
Draco notes the bags under Harry's eyes, and the concern lacing his voice. Ginny probably wasn't the only one there all night.
. You didn't, and that's the problem. Did you even care about her? At all?" Hermione's voice is a rough whisper across the table. She's as angry as Ron was, but somehow, her fluid control scares him more than his reckless abandon. "You make Harry happy. I can't understand why, but you do. So i'll try my best to accept this. But don't think, not for a minute, that i'll ever forgive you for this. Never."
Ginny's supposed to be what Draco is to him. Hermione can't in good conscience slap Harry on the back and congratulate him, not when it would shatter Ginny. He's always impulsive when it comes to emotion, but this is different. This is the most awful thing he could have done.
So when the time to leave finally rolls around, Draco's not sure he's even going. The dinner itself will be painfully awkward, and getting there itself is a whole other torturous task. He'll be walking, alone, through crowded hallways full of people who probably despise him.
"He didn't. I noticed in most of our practicals, you asked to borrow one, and I kind of put it together. This one's one of my spares. It's not brilliant, but it'll do. All it has to do is cast an
Harry stands, not in robes, but grey sweatpants that hang too lowly and a stained hoodie with a large muggle slogan on the front. His hair is messier than usual, and his glasses are missing, distracting Draco even more efficiently with his clear emerald eyes.
Draco wouldn't have dreamt of saying something that sounds suspiciously like he needs Potter, but this is a careful situation. He has to know how Harry knew where he was. He can't have just heard them talking ; he appeared far too quick for that.
You'd think that after everything Draco's been through, this wouldn't even rank in the top ten of his grand list of most stressful situations.
Of course, his instinct is to refuse. He didn't go through the trouble of carefully avoiding Harry just to end up showing up at his door later on. But it hits him in that moment the inherent fault in his actions. He didn't stop talking to him for Harry, or for Ron. He did it for himself. Their friendship got too real, too quickly, and Draco couldn't stomach the downsides that came with it.
Draco's not entirely surprised, Harry's been talking to him more and more before, during, and after class now that the secret's out. What
Harry's triumphant grin at getting a reaction from him. "I'm sure you can come up with something." He jokes, and Draco's just about to do just that, when he feels a warm hand come to rest on his shoulder, and it promptly knocks any coherence he'd possessed out the window.
But Draco never thought much of it. It was always just expected that he'd marry someone respectable, rich, probably horribly arrogant, and most importantly,
It's strange, different, but Draco's different now too. Sure, he's still stubborn, snarky, somewhat arrogant without meaning to be; but he's changed. He's not as prejudiced anymore, more open to new things and people. Not so blinded by his father, too.
"I'm alright." He says quietly, but loud enough so that Harry can hear him over the wind. Anxiety gives way for exhilaration, and the warm excitement defends him from the chill of the night. "I'm ... this is amazing." He adds after a few moments, and Harry twists around to smile at him.
He locks the door quickly; thank god the key's magical itself, otherwise fiddling with a locking spell would've cost him another ten minutes, and rushes after Harry.
Then again, he did get all of this from one conversation, so perhaps take his conclusions with a grain of salt, and because he didn't have the option of discussing it with Hermione, even more so.
Lonely, Draco does appear to be. But he, unlike the moon, is left unaccompanied by anything, star or otherwise.
Maybe he's not openly sweet in the traditional sense, his prickly nature prohibits him to be, but he's solicitous in his own, strange way. It's why he came to Harry, (even though he was prompted by Hermione) just to make sure he was okay.
Draco's got an unshakable feeling in his gut; that the joy he feels is the calm before the storm that's soon to hit, wrecking everything and returning the world to it's suitable state of despondent entropy.
Draco's unable to switch his feelings on and off, unable to attach and detach himself from someone at will. So when he notices Harry missing in his potions class, he's immediately concerned.
"Got it!" Harry, oblivious to the prior conversation, bounds into the room, holding up the carton of milk like a trophy.
"It's dripping oil everywhere." Draco couldn't sound more repugnant if he tried. "Look, it's going to stain your robes."
It's easier this way. Anyway, why does it matter if Draco and Harry's friendship is kept quiet? It's not like Draco's his
"Hermione- what-" He fumbles for the blankets,  drawing them up and over himself. She rolls her eyes - Hermione's never been the kind to wait for people to get up to speed.
We've hated him since 1rst year." He sounds to be in a state of disbelief. Harry understands that, too. Ron's lived most of his life knowing Malfoy to be an arrogant, racist git, who cared for no one but himself. It's hard, to shift a view that's been so firmly attached. But then, if Draco can change, why shouldn't Ron?
Harry looks amused - more amused than he should be, quite frankly. What's so funny about someone having a fall?  Draco could've died , or hit his head, or gotten injured!
Hermione rolls her eyes, only so Draco can see it, and stands. "Well done, Harry. Now maybe make the tea?"
Phrases like 'Quidditch practice' or 'Duelling' or something of the sort always seems to come naturally out of his mouth when the situation requires it.
"Are you trying to start something?" The perpertrator - a younger student, Griffindor quidditch uniform- snaps.
Potions is easier with a partner, but Draco doesn't think that's going to be a possibility, so he moves silently to the back of the class.
Draco glares, eyes narrow , but for once not cold. He'd never admit to it, but it is funny, in a way.
Of course, he has Harry to thank for that. Hermione, who too was rather excited about the upcoming Yuletide celebrations, toned it down a bit upon seeing Draco's dark demeanour. Harry, on the other hand, takes some inane pleasure in seeing Draco irritated.
Draco regrets asking; blushing and looking away. Merlin, this boy will be the death of him. How he's going to get through tonight with his heart still in his chest he doesn't know.
They'd both reached it under amicable terms. Not that Draco would've done differently if Harry hadn't told him to. He's all in; Potter could ask him to trim the Whomping Willow and he'd happily run off to find some shears.
A morbidly amusing thought crosses Draco's mind at that - even if he says no, Harry'll probably just follow him anyway.
Or any less stupid. Boasting about the deed is bound to bring attention to it - a mightly shame for Draco, but hopefully it reaches McGonagall and it will be worth it to see him expelled.
"Thank you." Draco says softly, pulling his hand back towards him. It's warm now, and not just because of the sun.
Draco returns his playful grin. He doesn't notice her, but Hermione notices them, glancing between the two. He should be careful; she's more perceptive than she lets on.
Long one this time, to celebrate this fic's one month anniversary! I can't believe how much support this has accumulated over just one months, it's incredible. Thank you so much, guys. Enjoy the chapter (it's packed with fluff and protective Harry, just you wait and see <3)
It's not that it's been a dull term- far from it. Draco's experienced more in the ways of friendship and care in the past few months than he has in the entirety of his eighteen years of existence. No, it's not boredom.
"You're a terrible lier." Harry snorts, moving closer. "Tell me or i'll keep bothering you until you do."
She snatches the carton from him with a glare, and sets about helping him with the tea. Harry sends him a wink that makes his heart flutter nearly out of his chest.
And then, as if a switch had been flipped, his boderline hysterical laughter turns to completely hysterical sobbing. He's crying uncontrollably, shoulders shaking and hot tears creating channels down his face.
Draco freezes. Slow, he's too slow. Panic starts to set in. This is different from duelling; one is an organised sport, with rules and sanctions and safety measures, the other is a darkened, isolated corridor with a student, judging from the interaction thus far, who has no regard for Draco's safety.
The image, fresh and visceral shoots into Draco's mind. But he steels his nerves, and tries to push past the anxiety, the terror, and remember the relief, the
Draco narrows his eyes in irritation. What do they expect? For Ron to up and curse him right there and then?
A quick healing charm later, and the cut is rapidly receding, healing itself swiftly. Draco almost wishes it hadn't worked, just so Harry would keep holding his hand.
"We do too. Professor Shrike's brave to take on two N.E.W.T level classes." Harry says, rummaging through his bag. Draco twitches impatiently. It's right there, the book, fallen onto his lap.
He sighs heavily and sinks down onto his bed, glowering at his closet like it's to blame. It's no use. No matter how much he talks the coat down, he can't seem to bring himself to return it. He's not even fooling himself anymore; he loves the stupid thing.
But then, like in the library, Harry snaps out of the trance, and he backs away. "Let's go. It's freezing."
, and he shouldn't want him. And despite the fact that Harry's made his desire for Draco abundantly clear, he's waltzed around the subject of Ginny smoothly enough to make Draco foolishly put her aside.
None, not even the two girls who were oh-so-eagerly whispering to each other before can say anything now.
Draco's chest fills with an empty feeling, and the overwhelming need to apologise grasps him and shakes until he caves. "I'm sorry, too." He mutters.
Harry's chest heaves, like he wants to sigh but he knows he's got no right to do so. So instead, it's Hermione herself who puts down her spoon in exasperation.
Green eyes meet grey a second later, and it startles Draco into looking away, down at his book to at least try to pretend he's focused on the work, or what Slughorn's rambling on about, or anything other than what he truly was focused on.
Harry doesn't say anything, staring at Draco for a moment. Then he looks around the corridor quickly to make doubly sure they didn't have an audience. "Let's go." He says quietly, moving away from him. For a second, Draco's worried Harry hasn't forgiven him at all, but he doesn't lead him back to the dining hall.
Turning his head away to break eye contact sobers him up well enough for him to nod. "Alright. I'll try."
It's fitting in a way - Draco's always had the spotlight on him, now he's cast away into the shadows. Logically, it makes sense, he understands.
Ginny still doesn't acknowledge Draco, not even after they sit down at one of the tables. In fact, she doesn't even look in his general
Draco can feel Harry's chest rise and fall with his deep breaths, and it lulls him into a peaceful resolution, drifting away like a ship on the blue expanses of the ocean.
But really, he's not jealous. He's not in love with Potter for god's sake. He can have himself a girlfriend, or whatever makes him happy.
spell is one thing, but for a healing charm to go wrong, well, Draco's more willing to just bind up the wound the muggle way. He's quite good at that, actually.
Draco shuts his eyes, mentally preparing himself for the next words that leave his mouth. "No. You should've." Draco turns. "You're right. I did it because I didn't want you to pick him. Because I was ...
He says it with such haste that Draco's worried something's wrong. Maybe something is - Harry looks as though he's been jolted rather viciously and harshly from a dream, like he's woken up to something very unpleasant.
"I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"I don't love you like I loved her. Because you're different, and I can't love you in the same way. It wouldn't be fair. And anyway, i'm different when i'm with you, too. I'm ... better when i'm with you."
But now, he's even more so, floating rather than walking through the halls he once strode down confidently.
Ginny blames Harry for not being what she needs, and Harry blames her for a similar reason, even if he vehemently assures against it.
Draco's eyes linger on Harry's, but it only takes a moment for him to take note of the intensity they hold. Does he look like that, too?
It's stupid, Harry has a life outside of classes and watching Draco. He's practicing quidditch again, started meeting up with Ginny for dates, his friends for outings. His life is as good as it can be, all things considered.
briefly once or twice, and there's been days where they've spent hours and hours acting like strangers. But from what he heard, it's a lot worse that he's letting on.
Draco pulls away, pressing fingers to his swollen lips. They feel the same, but different now, almost like they're a part of Harry. That he's a part of Harry. The idea of that sends such a spike of pleasure rushing within him that he almost forgets why he stopped Harry at all.
of ours blew out of proportion. Well, not out of proportion, I think you're completely justified in being upset with me, I just ..." He pauses to pinch the bridge of his nose. "I was wrong. I wanted to say that what I was doing was wrong. I don't care who i'm seen with, really, I never have. You shouldn't feel like a scandal because I forgot myself for a moment. You don't deserve that."
Draco's tongue tangles itself; he can't speak for a long moment. Harry should look much better with his expensive, tailored robes, but here, he looks completely at home. It suits him, better than any robes ever could. Draco's transfixed.
"How could you?" His voice shakes, just like the tremor in his hand, and the guilt, rushing in like a tsunami, hits Draco all at once.
"Do you miss him?" Harry asks carefully, like Draco may explode if he says the wrong thing. Considering how Draco tenses at the question, it may not be a ridiculous concern.
He can only venture a guess that the draw to the healing arts stems from both his love of potions and a strong desire to attone for the countless sins he's commited in his short life.
Wooowee! Another one!! Sorry it's a teensy bit late, I've been struggling to keep to schedules recently
"Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
He's got his answer, really. " Why can't you say it?" He repeats, and he feels desperately like he's trying to hold onto a hope rapidly fading in the blue swirl of a storm brewing within him.
Draco's just about at his wit's end when Harry suddenly pulls him into the open courtyard, and they finally come to a stop.
It's almost worth it when he sees how Hermione's eyes sparkle with newly discovered hope. "Thank you, Draco. Really."
"We can't do this." Draco mutters, closing his eyes in a rare moment of vulnerability. "What will everyone say?"
The sun catches his face, illuminating his skin, turning it a dewy, warm tone, and the wind ripping through the trees tossle his hair into more of a mess than it already was.  "But no one comes here, so far out of the way, for no reason."
Draco's delusional mind is definitely reading too far into this. But never mind, no one's going to burst his bubble, not now, at least.
He wonders if Harry asked Ginny like this too; hands brushing skin, barely an inch of space between them, voices in low whispers that come with short breaths and fast heart rates.
Non verbal spells are hard, because they rely solely on your ability to control your magic, drawing power directly from the source. See, wands are just a conduit for magic; the real power's contained within your core.
He leans forward away from Harry's chest, craning his neck downward so he doesn't have to look at him behind his back. His words need to be picked carefully, and Harry's eyes, painted with painful concern won't help him at all.
"Don't. You don't need to justify yourself to me." Draco snaps. "You don't love me. It's not the end of the bloody world. I don't need you to comfort me, or protect me, or try and make it sound any different to what it is. Just leave me the courtesy to process it, and
This is made vividly clear when Harry invites Draco to sit with him at Breakfast the next morning. It's a bizarre idea, really. Draco's grown accustomed to skipping meals, breakfast in particular, to avoid the trouble (no eggs are worth the jeers). So it's just strange that he finds himself saying yes.
Harry winces. "Actually, I didn't. I wasn't going to apologise at all. But then I got here, and I saw you and I dunno ... I realised I had to. You were right."
"How did you know? Where I was, how did you know?" He blurts suddenly. It's strange, Draco's always had exceptional control over his words. Something's different with Harry. He feels like he could tell the boy all his deepest, darkest secrets, the ones he'd locked away somewhere far into the pit of his heart; and that everything would be just fine.
Thank you to all who read and commented! No songs this time :( I legitimately just sat in silence as I wrote this !
Draco shifts uncomfortably next to him, tugging at his sleeves, fiddling with his fork, sweeping his eyes back and forth over the room. He's about three seconds away from just standing up and racing out.
Actually, he's so put off by the notion, that he skips breakfast, far too sick with worry to even THINK about eating.
If he had to guess, he'd say being in the sun, feeling it's warmth reach right through his bones, touching his soul and igniting a fire within his very core, would be the closest thing to living for
aware of what to do or say in a situation, he keeps his mouth shut about it. Draco's thankful, he does NOT want to have that particular conversation with Harry. Not now nor ever.
He still hasn't given the coat back. It's been two days, and yet the offending item of clothing still hangs in his closet, mocking him to no end.
However, ever the proud Slytherin, he doesn't look up at the whispers or the jeers, pretends to not notice them, but the relief he feels when he hears them all stop abruptly is evidence that they affect him more than he'd be willing to admit.
"It's moral support!" Harry says, defensively. Hermione's nerves have started to rub off onto him, making him teether dangerously on edge. But surely Ron can't stay mad at him for so long, even given the circumstances. I mean, it's not like Harry's
"This is it. I'm officially insane." Draco murmurs, brushing the sand off his trousers. But even if the feeling is fabricated, it's still nice.
He smiles back, and steps in. Somehow, it's even more of a mess than the last time he saw it. There's stuff
"I should be thanking you, Malfoy." Harry snorts, but his face is dead serious when he looks at Draco. "I know everyone's sick of how I act when Ginny and I ... disagree."
"Shut up!" Draco screeches from some deep, raw part of him, and it's shocking enough to stun Ron into silence. "Just shut up!"
But it's short lived, because a second later, the crunching of leaves from behind Draco announces Harry's entrance.
But Draco finds his rythym eventually, relaxing and pressing closer to Harry, whose fingers dig possessively into Draco's hips, harsh enough to bruise.
Draco agrees almost instantly but he's not sure that that's what he really wants. He can't think of anything he wants to say, either. But the instinctual reaction within him surges forward, consuming his mind, the words spinning around his thoughts and making him dizzy.
Hermione's anger is quelled a little. She knows this, she's seen firsthand how awful Ginny feels in the relationship, and how equally awful Harry feels.
He's acutely aware that he has to return with a book vaguely related to their study focus, otherwise their suspicions will only worsen, so he idly runs his fingers over the spines of the neatly stacked books, trying but ultimately failing at paying much attention to the actual content, or even the titles for that matter.
And when the end of his last class rolls around,promise in mind, run to the lake he does. It's a strange concoction of emotion that spurs his steps onward. Worry, anticipation, a great deal of fear too. It's not a foreign feeling for Draco, but it really doesn't get easier with practice.
"No, you did it because you couldn't bare to see me choose them." Harry scoffs, spitting out the words before he really registers what he's said.
When he can't see anything in the trees, he chalks it up to some small animal or something, because really, who'd be out this late, so far from the castle?
They'd dismounted minutes ago, a comfortable silence punctuated by the gentle rustle of the trees settling over them. Harry had planned all of it, all the way down to how they'd get off at their spot by the lake, seeing as though they haven't visited in a while.
Harry studies him. It's uncomfortable, Draco shifts under his scrutinising gaze. He feels like Harry's searching his very soul, laying him out bare and drawing all the secrets he'd fought to keep hidden out into the light.
"That was ... different. He caught me off guard, it was a hex not a jinx, and I panicked. This is nothing like that. Now just hurry up with it, Harry, people are watching."
"So...?" Ron prompts. He looks as though he wants to point out that this was supposed to be a private discussion, but years of knowing Hermione stops either of them from vocalising such thoughts.
I'm so, so, so sorry for the delay. I had exam after exam this week, and now, I've unfortunately had the displeasure of falling ill, and there is a high chance I've contracted the 'dreaded' Covid-19 virus. There's definitely perks to it - I get to take time off school to watch Netflix, catch up on sleep and studies, and write all day!
What was he saying? He can't remember. It's inconsequential, anyway, because everything is, now. Nothing matters, except the beautiful boy standing in front of him. The beautiful boy who loves him.
I'm thinking of listing some songs I listen to while writing each chapter, so here you go for this one!
more close. Now whenever Harry sets his hands on Draco's shoulders or neck or back; Draco believes he's loudly proclaiming something he'd
The stars, minute but plentiful, follow the moon along in droves, accompanying it on it's journey across the infinite bounds of space. Draco thinks it to be nice; the moon, lonely as it is fabled to be, is never truly left without the company of the stars.
Draco turns to say that to Harry, but his words shrivel and melt away on his tongue when he notices how close Harry's face is to his. They stay like that, for a second, cold air passing between them, the slightest breath sounding like a gust of wind.
Draco tilts his head upwards so he doesn't have to look at Harry anymore. He's afraid of how much he craves him. Like an addict to a drug.
"No." Harry says brazenly, and Draco almost wants to snort in amusement. Trust Harry to care so little about ettiquette. "I'm not leaving until you listen to me."
It's funny, the memory associated isn't as painful physically like the other ones, but it still sits on Draco's consciousness and weighs him down like a stone to the bottom of a river.
"Did you-" He starts, looking at Harry in question. He didn't explicitly tell him not to tell her about his 'wand situation', but he thought it was quite clear he didn't want it to be public knowledge. But Harry shakes his head, looking just as confused as he does.
"I don't know, Draco. If you want me to be honest, I don't. I know what you did, what you've done," Draco cringes at the memory, "But I - no one deserves to be abandoned. No one can't be saved."
He's sure people look at them strangely as they pass; sworn enemies, laughing and walking together as though they were old friends. And usually, Draco's hyper aware of that sort of thing, but not this time. This time, he's not thinking about what everyone else is thinking about; and it feels amazing.
"Harry, listen."  She starts, watching the flames flicker in the fireplace to distract herself. "I know you love him too. I've seen it, and I didn't want to believe it, but I know. I love Ginny- I love Ginny more than anything and quite frankly, I love Ginny a great deal more than Draco."
"I couldn't care less about what people will say, Draco. And you can't make me care anymore than I can."
sorry. That was rude," He mutters. "I just ... I don't like talking about her. Not when i'm like this."
"Ouch! Hermione-" He says, gingerly detaching her from his side. Not for the first time, Harry's starting to wonder if maybe she's more anxious about this than he is. "Don't worry, really."
But Harry doesn't talk, and when Draco looks over, it's almost like he's been frozen solid. He just stares, out into the sky, fists clenching and unclenching periodically.
happy to be near him. Draco groans dramatically, more gently releasing his bag onto the floor and sitting cross legged next to Harry, close enough that they're barely centimeters apart.
But it still keeps him lying awake hours after he should have been asleep, well past midnight. He groans, cursing his dependance on the stupid boy as he changes positions again, though all his attempts to get some rest have been in vain.
Draco looks back to him at this, frowning. His eyes are closed, head tilted upwards to try and catch the last of the sun's rays before it dips behind the horizon, and the moon takes it's place.
It's every ounce bitter as Draco wanted it to be. He clenches his jaw and digs his nails into the soft fabric of Harry's coat, repressed spite threatening to come free.
"See you tomorrow, Draco?" Harry seems to inexplicably KNOW he's messed something up; call it magic, if you will. He says it gently, like he's taming a wild animal.
The class, some of whom bore witness to the incident and the rest quite well informed on it, stare at the unfortunate pairing in anticipation.
This makes Harry lean on him a bit too much in reciprocation, and they stumble, Draco's back hitting the door with a soft thump.
Harry's silent for a long time after that, and Draco's too scared to try and gauge his thought process by glancing at his face.
Still, it's these firm reassurances that Harry will be there, regardless of their disagreement, that helps Draco keep to his promise.
Ginny Weasley. The only female in the litter of offspring produced by Molly and Arthur Weasley. And, unfortunately,
"Draco! Come in." She's 180'd by the time she greets him, a welcoming smile plastered on her face. But Draco knows better, from the strands of hair that have come loose from her tight ponytail, and that tired look in her eyes.
"I'm just worried about him. He won't talk to me, or Ron, or Ginny. I was hoping he'd talk to you, at least."
At some stage for Harry, Malfoy started to become Draco. Draco's different from Malfoy. Malfoy's awful; rude and childish; an irredeemable bully who Harry would sooner hex before getting to know. But Draco, Draco's like an old book. Falling apart at the seams; a shadow of a former glory; But filled with so many secrets and stories you can't help but want to read.
Although he's already working pretty hard to make up for his sins - with the amount of classes they share, avoiding Harry is damn near impossible.
He doesn't hear the sheets rustle behind him, and he can imagine how the tense tautness of Harry's body pulls him into heart-stopping stillness. "Don't." He says sharply, and it's like a knife's kissed his chest where Harry should've.
making a fuss about Harry not telling anyone before, perhaps he deserves this horror. It's certainly self inflicted.
"You have to care, Harry." Harry doesn't acknowledge him, instead rubbing his fingers distractingly over Draco's jaw, making the other boy press into his palm, not entirely of his own volition.
Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, is a tall, muscular wizard. He's supposedly an ex auror; though that's just a rumour. The amount of intricate field work he knows, however, is probably good evidence for the claim. He's also American, which is strange. Well, it's not
"Let me finish. But I didn't mean what I said, Harry. He's changed, for the better. And i'm in no place to deny you the happiness you feel when you're beside him. He makes you smile, Harry, and I don't think you understand how rare that is. To find someone who makes you smile like that. I can't say I'm okay with the idea of seeing you together, but give it time. Give me time."
Somehow, a stone finds it's way into his hand - he doesn't remember picking it up, but he must've. It's not as smooth as the one Harry picked out for him; it's course, scratches his palm and makes him swear, dropping it again. Cursed stones, cursed skipping stones.
But now that Lucius is safely tucked away in one of Azkaban's hellish cells, Draco is free to choose whatever career pleases him.
. Like his cheap muggle cologne he insists on wearing (Draco'll never admit to how delicious it smells) and his earthy shampoo that he either uses too much of, or is far too strong (Draco doesn't really mind).
Up, upwards to his neck again, calloused fingers rubbing at the top of his spine, palm resting in the hollow of his collarbone.
It's the most popular subject this year, and despite the dwindling numbers, there's still been enough interest to prompt the need for two classes.
Draco, without his own consent, finds himself sympathising with Harry. Draco could, theoretically, hide himself away like a recluse after this year, never to be seen again if he wanted. Harry has no such chance. He continues to be forced into a role he doesn't want, well after Voldermort's death.
"When i'm with you. When i'm happy. It's like, I can't help but feel guilty, because I shouldn't be happy. I don't deserve to be, not after giving up on her like that."
"She's probably right." Draco assents, still trying to come to terms with the extraordinary amount of
Draco has to remind himself that, despite the somewhat pitiful character his family's name has adopted, their actions,
Harry sighs and Draco feels his arms wrap around his middle. His stubble scratches against the skin of Draco's shoulder where he rests his head. "No,
That doesn't mean he's fine with it, because as soon as he meets Harry's eyes, he's swallowed whole by the allure of them, and he's soon floating somewhere north of heaven, relishing in the attentive stare Harry's giving him. His hand falls from Draco's neck, but he doesn't notice, which is testament to how taken he is, how far from himself he feels.
"I'm not about to take tips on cowardice from a Malfoy." He steadies his wand, his lips move, muttering a spell Draco's never heard before, and three things happen in quick succession.
"Good." He drops his hands from next to Draco's face, and back down to his waist. He kisses him again slowly; tantalizingly slowly, like he's trying to draw out every ounce of need Draco has for him.
His tongue feels heavy in his mouth, words slow to form. The smell of Harry's cologne; musky and oaky and absolutely
He's gasping for breath at the end of it, knees pressed into the wet dirt, hands gripping his own sides in a pseudo-hug, comforting himself for there's no one else to do it for him.
"No. It's not." The words tumble from him in a nonchalant manner, though Draco knows he cares about her, and the fallout of their relationship. He has to care; it's Harry.
But by that evening however, he's rather vehemently cursing her in his head. Why on earth did he agree to do this? He's been standing outside Potter's room like a lost puppy for the past five minutes, trying to work up the courage just to
Draco watches him go, a part of him bitter that he's got Ginny's key. He hasn't got any right to be; Ginny's his girlfriend, of course he'd have her key. But he can't help but imagine it's
Ah, so Harry's avoiding his own 'Draco problems' by refusing to talk about them. It's a tried and tested strategy, in his - and Draco's - defence.
emotions, and though it's tiring and completely out of character, there's a certain thrill to it, the thought of what
It's awful; and it's amazing in a way. Draco had spent the months after his trial not sad, but empty. Void of feeling and any emotion other than bitter. Now, he's got
But he's being hypocritical. He can't simultaneously hate Ginny from drawing Harry away from him, and hate Harry for wanting to be near him.
Draco rises, follows him out of the hall and into a corridor, far away from prying eyes. Harry looks around conspiratorially, checking for any quiet listeners, before finally turning to face Draco.
" Hermione says, and Draco can feel her icy stare even through the door. What on earth are they talking about?
"Come on, Malfoy. Don't be such a prude. Just try it. Unless, of course, you're scared." And the little bastard has the nerve to quirk an eyebrow, as though he's one upped Draco.
There's no fire, no danger, just miles and miles of black night, framed by midnight blue tainted clouds and twinkling fairy lights spotted around the crescent- shaped moon. And there's Harry too- right in front of him, his hoodie soft beneath his clenching fingers.
Harry does move; he steps in front of Draco, placing himself even closer between him and Ron's wand, because he's
"I dunno, she injured her leg in Quidditch yesterday. I took her to Madam Pomfrey and everything to get patched up, but she's still there now. She was there all night, too."
Draco's face appears clear in the lake, lines of stress and exhaustion cutting into his sickly looking face.
He looks happier , healthier. Like the break after the war was good for him. His eyes don't look as tired, skin not so pale, lips not so worried down by constant biting.
"It's fine." Draco says, trying his best to make it sound not as clipped as it eventually comes out.
"You're kissing him now! You're breaking Ginny's heart now." She's boderline hysterical, and they're both in each other's faces, so close they can see the nothing in each other's eyes. Neither can think of something to say, neither can think of the answer or the question or the right thing to do.
It's another topic he avoids, but it's more jagged. Where Ginny's a careful waltz, the war is a tiptoed walk over a bed of thorns.
Hermione laughs, shaking her head. Draco thinks about how easier it is to make her laugh than to maker her cry. He wonders why he ever tried,
"I can't." The humiliation paints his cheeks red. "The ministry wouldn't let me keep my wand. The one I have now won't let me cast most spells."
"You know, I couldn't believe you said yes. It's not really your scene." Hermione says. It's dressed up to be casual, but Draco can hear how calculated it is. Not in a bad way; it's admirable how protective she is over Harry.
Aimlessly is wrong, however, because his feet have a mind of their own, and lead him to the spot that's burnt into his memory.
For a moment, nothing is said, and Draco's shoulders slump lower still. It's scary, in a way, how the one subject completely changes Harry's disposition rather violently. It rattles Draco, more than he'd like to admit, drawing up familiar feelings he'd rather keep buried. It's his fault though: he's pressing a sore nerve.
Swallowing the rough lump in his throat, he raps his knuckles sharply on the wooden door. "Potter? It's Draco."
Ron lets the door slam shut with a loud bang behind him, and Harry realises he can't handle Ron the way he handled Draco.
It's strange, though; as soon as his trembling arms are wrapped tightly around Harry's waist, he seems to calm his galloping heart down quite a bit. Usually, it's the inverse; being around Harry, and this close too, well, he should be even more of a nervous wreck. But he just feels strangely
be personal. But if he could just get him to see Malfoy for who he is, not who he thinks he is, he'd be okay.
The room looks off in the same way Harry's does; single dorms sound great until you start to miss the closeness and company of your friends. The single bed, single wardrobe, single bookshelf; it's all wrong.
This feels strange to Draco- he's sure it feels strange to Potter too. They've never talked aside from to hurl insults at each other, but now, here, they're having a conversation that feels much like an exchange between - dare he say it,
"I can't Harry. It's too weird. Every time I see him, I just ... I think about everything he's done and I can't block it out."
Ron Weasley, face ablaze the same color as his hair, comes charging towards them, with a distressed looking Hermione in hot pursuit.
, some reason to prove what's happening really isn't, that this is some elaborate joke and reality will slap him into awareness soon.
"Tell me, Draco." He presses on, unaffected by Draco's comment. He's heard too many anyway, they all blend into one. Draco makes a mental note to up his game.
"I know. Ron, I know. But just listen for a sec. He's changed, really, he has. I swear he's not who you think he is."
Draco goes silent, ears burning in embarrassment. He's starting to hate the attention, particularly when it's so presently drawn to him. I know, it's ironic.
Harry smiles, apparently deciding to put Draco out of his misery, and drops his hands to his waist, pulling him impossibly closer. Draco lets himself be guided by those hands until he's flush against his chest and they can't physically get any closer. Even then, it's not nearly close enough.
Draco's overactive imagination had run amuck again. Stalking him, honestly. Naivety is a new skill Draco's seemingly beginning to master all of a sudden.
"Harry. Where have you been?" She asks tentatively, stepping closer carefully, as though fast movements would make him startle and flee like a wild animal.
"Was being the operative word." Draco continues, flinching when Harry accidentally presses too hard against the wound. It looks a lot worse in the light of day. Nothing life threatening, obviously, but it's decidedly not pretty, all purple skin and stained blood.
The words sting Draco, but only because they're the same ones he'd been repeating to himself over and over again.
He can find no purpose in standing and arguing with the oaf, so he just turns to leave, when he speaks again.
Harry all but shoves the door open in his haste, and Draco follows after him obediently. There's a look of determination on Harry's face that tells Draco to just roll with it.
Even after he knocks on Ron's door, he can feel her eyes on him, making him squirm. Now he knows what pet fish feel like.
God, he's going to be punished for thinking that, he knows he is. Wishing ill on someone is never a good thing. But it is rather cathartic for Draco.
stubbornness is coupled with unbearable righteousness, which leaves Draco quite at the mercy of his incessant pushiness.
It's a concern Draco may be projecting a little. After all, he's asked himself the same thing on far too many an occasion. Yes, Potter's got a saviour complex. But there are plenty other broken toys out there for him to fix, expecially now. Why Draco?
Hermione, unsurprisingly, takes the first tentative leap. Draco has to keep reminding himself of her Gryffindor status.
It's like his own ignorance was the last barrier between him and the raging flood of emotion that finally hit in it's absence. Everything became so much more
Draco doesn't come to class the next day. He doesn't move from his bed for pretty much the whole morning, alternating between crying his weight in tears, and falling into periods of fitful sleep.
Draco turns his head towards Harry's, and watches him bring his hand up to his mouth, brushing his lips over the back of Draco's knuckles.
As always, please comment! It encourages me wayyyyy more than kudos or hits, because it's a direct connection to you guys, the readers!! I love hearing your thoughts!!
"You don't have to hold hands and braid each other's hair, Ron. Just tolerate him, please. That's all i'm asking." Harry says.
"You're back." He smiles at him, this time close to the water, a smooth stone in hand, ready to be thrown.
He, completely aware and under no compulsion or coercion whatsoever, purposefully disrupted the immovable routine they'd struck up.
He knows Harry's just worried, but he can't help but feel a little ashamed at the mention of the incident.
"I've got to get going." Potter says, snapping out of the trance he'd been in, consequently snapping Draco out of his.
Draco's exhausted by the end of the day; cleaning Harry's room, despite Hermione's help, was a big job, and he's well and truly knackered by the time he finally gets back to his own room.
strange, to the other students at least. To Draco, who's never met an American, it's quite strange indeed.
"Well ...?" Draco huffs, unimpressed. It's late, and he's grumpy, and regardless of how much he likes Harry, he will jinx the boy if he's dragged him out here just to sit in the
Something evil and malicious and hell bent on ruining Draco's life must've possessed him when he agreed to help Hermione clean up Harry's room. Really, there's so much that could go wrong. Draco embarrassing himself in front of Hermione, for one.
Draco's eyes fill with water from repressed emotion, and an overwhelming feeling filling him sits on his chest like a heavy stone, rendering him unable to breathe much less think properly.
He glances up, fully prepared to throw all caution to the wind and smile broadly at Harry and Hermione. But the relief is dead in his gut before it even really becomes evident.
Draco should be offended, he should walk off, and never come back. Should stop talking to Harry all together. No friendship should be built on a clear power imbalance like the one they have.
"Harry. Harry!" Harry wakes with a groan, then a jump when he realises Hermione's standing over him.
The 8th year dorms aren't separated by house. Inclusitivity, or sportsmanship, or something like that - Professor McGonagall had given a good ten minute speech about it after the sorting ceremony.
"You should go too." Draco says, turning his back on Harry. He folds his arms over his chest to self soothe, feeling how ragged his breaths are.
Its the first thing she's said to him outside of 'pass the porcupine quills', and hence is a touch jarring. Maybe it's not just her words that make Draco frown. It's the way she says it; like she's run out of options, despaired.
Draco thoroughly regrets the decision he made last night. Apologising to Harry seems infinitely scarier now that the sun's up, and the moments until Draco's forced to see him again become fewer and fewer.
Draco rests his head against Harry's shoulder, huffing out a short laugh at Harry's expense. "You're mawkish."
"It's strange, you know." She says, and immediately, everyone's eyes are on her. She has that quality about her; she's soft, gentle; but when she talks you want to listen. "Seeing you two together. It's strange."
Harry hums, and Draco's breath catches when he feels cool fingers brush across his cheekbone. "I don't care."
"While I appreciate the sentiment, Harry, it really is. But he needs time, and i'm alright with that. He doesn't owe me anything."
Draco's heart drops. "Do you miss her?" His anguish is brilliantly put on display by the stutter in his voice.
Somewhere along the way, the tree had become their tree, they'd staked a claim upon it. Regardless of how old and ancient the tree may be; it's the thing they turned to to symbolise their new friendship.
Yes, he's always been acutely aware of how attractive Potter had progressively become over the years; he saw all the girls pining after him and throwing themselves at his feet rather pathetically in his senior years at Hogwarts. And yes, Draco's also aware of his own occasional more-than-friendly feelings towards certain guys. Blaise Zabini for example; oh the many nights he spent fantasising about him.
It's strange to Draco; how people he's never met seem to take great amusement in staring at him for too long and far too intimately. Draco doesn't know half the students who've hurled insults at him, yet they all seem to be quite familiar with him.
Draco's eyes, along with Harry's and a dozen others', move towards the source of the noise. Draco's not entirely surprised at his findings.
Harry hurt him; and it's one of the worst pains Draco's ever experienced. He hurt him and he didn't even mean to.
Draco feels a stab of hurt at that. "Different isn't awful." He says indignantly, and Harry seems to realise he's said something wrong.
He repeats, and the words sound a lot worse when Draco hears them from his mouth. "What's that supposed to mean?"
Draco's still buzzing from the irritation, but when he feels Harry's hand on his arm, pulling it back and into place, large palms wrapping around his own slender fingers, all he can think about is the sound of his own heartbeat, thumping like crazy in his throat, in his chest, in his head.
He's not a complete fool, of course he won't try a cruciatas curse, or the killing curse, but certain hexes can come a close second in terms of pain thresholds.
His breath hitches when Harry's wandering hand moves to the back of his neck, and he hopes against hope that Harry doesn't notice and withdraw from him.
Draco's aware he's being ridiculous. Harry's not stalking him, really, it's a fantastical idea. But even as they get the all clear from Madam Pomfrey to leave, and are walking down the hallways to the dorms, Draco still can't shake the unsettling feeling that Harry was watching him - that he knew full well where he was.
"Draco-" Harry catches up with him just as they're about to enter their Defence Against the Dark Arts class.
Well, that's his logical reasoning anyway. He's coming to realise that emotions and feelings are far from logical.
She didn't really. If it had been anyone else, Draco would've thought the statement to be confrontational, but that's just Luna. She's unnervingly honest.
Draco's just as familiar with consequence as he is with pain. Which is useless, really, because it does little to prepare him for all the backlash.
Draco can't help but smile. She - much like Hermione - is really very nice. Blunt, but nice. Who would've thought, Draco's starting to get along with Harry's merry band. "As do I."
Harry was vulnerable and frustrated and tired, and Draco took advantage of that, right? It must be his fault. It can't be Harry's, or Ginny's, or anybody else's, so it must be his.
His pride, though a sin, is the only thing stopping him from childishly glaring back. Ron should just hex him and get it over with;
Maybe it's the unsettling looks the people around are throwing him that makes time seem to drag on and on. Draco feels like he's an animal in a circus, or an exhibit at a museum, on display for everyone to prod and point at.
Hermione, seemingly becoming aware of what she said, sighs loudly, rubbing her forehead. "Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that."
Harry and Draco stop outside a potrait of a tired looking man, behind which lie the 8th year dormitories.
Harry slides down the bench, closer to the students on his left. He plucks a blueberry muffin from a basket in front of them. "Sorry, can I have this?"
Harry's eyes wander to the side, and he smiles mordantly. "What exactly do you want from me, Malfoy?"
Of course, it's not always so easy, but this, flying a broom, this is a damn good start, and even if Draco's not able to completely detach himself from his experiences, he'll be content with what he's about to agree to. "And yes. Let's go."
Somehow, Harry and Draco had come to a non-verbal agreement that they'd meet after their last class every other day,only because meeting everyday got a bit finicky, with Quidditch and assignments and whatnot. It's strange, how this arrangement has never been explicitly adressed nor confirmed, yet Draco's not exactly jumping to question it's validity.
Or, it could be a gift. A strange, second hand, oddly personal gift. Though really, if he was to give Draco something, he'd hope Harry would try harder than
"There's things I tell Ron, and not Hermione, and things I tell Hermione and not Ron. There's things I can just tell you too. Things I think you'll understand in a way they couldn't."
Hermione doesn't fancy herself a genius. People say she is, and she knows she's smart, of course she does, but she's never, and will never, call herself a genius.
Draco winces, and the guilt comes rushing in again. "I didn't want to. I just thought it would be easier."
"Forgive me, I must have heard you wrong." Draco's voice drips with all the poison of his younger self's. "Because it sounded a lot like you were implying I relinquished our friendship for
He tugs the parchment out, silently cursing that he kicked it so far under in his panic to cover it up.
"Why are you here then?" Draco chirps, drawing his eyes away from the mesmerising boy and joining his gaze into the horizon.
And at his word, they're plummeting down towards the ground. No, not the ground - the lake! Harry's flown them out to the lake, and he pulls so close to the water that Draco can reach out his hand to ripple their reflections; he does, one arm still wrapped possessively around Harry and that comforting feeling of safety.
Ron, in the span of 30 seconds, has already started to thoroughly vex Harry. That's got to be some sort of record.
"Here. Picked this up so you had an alibi." He's smiling easily again when he hands Draco the textbook, but something's hidden behind his grin, behind his eyes.
"Yes, well, your friendship with him seems to be having quite the affect on ours." She remarks sharply, pursing her lips.
Suddenly, Draco feels guilty again. Harry's alone. He lost two friends in the span of two minutes, and he's left alone and probably very upset.
"I didn't realise I needed a reason." Draco says, but the words hold little of the malice they would have in the past. He's too tired, what the point? What can it achieve?
Draco's half-lidded eyes refocus on him, trying hard to appear unaffected by his touch but failing spectacularly.
"Remember, just be gentle with him, okay? He's really upset, Harry." Hermione says it in a hushed whisper, one hand tightening around Harry's arm.
sign up for this. This year was supposed to be complicated enough with the whole wizarding world's eyes on him, watching, waiting for him to slip up. He does
"I'm sorry for surprising you like that. I really am, Draco. But I asked her to try, so i'm asking you to, aswell."
find out, not until Draco's alive and breathing. He'd sooner live his life as a muggle than have Harry know about his ...
She's quiet at that, and Draco needs to say what he's thinking. "Listen, Granger, I wanted to apologise. For everything I said to you, everything I did-"
The snow, though pretty, is incredibly annoying, Draco's decided. He sits, huddled up against their tree in his thick sweater and a miserable frown.
"Harry." Draco breathes again, raspy and hoarse and obscene in the most delicious way. His fingers wrap around his wrist, fighting every instinct that's lighting his nerves on fire and stopping Harry's hand. "We
But why does he feel so ... empty then? Like he's just ticking off a box, filling out his name on a role. He really must have a deathwish, because a part of him - more prominently than he'd like to admit - yearns for the excitement, the adrenaline fueled adventures of his previous years at Hogwarts. Everything seems so ... dull now. Mundane.
Draco stops too, moving in front of him. " No, you couldn't have. By the time you would have heard, you would have been too late. "
She's shaking with anger by the time she's done, and fiery red fills her cheeks, but she doesn't move. She doesn't want to make a scene, and she hasn't. "I think you two should go." She mutters.
. He's probably going to hear about it for the foreseeable future too, what with Christmas being in ten days.
Draco's come to realise how lovingly the words 'shut up' can be said in the time he's spent with Harry. How somebody can say it with a smile, or not a scowl. How it can send sparks of warmth through him.
Now that Harry mentions it, Draco can feel something wet running down the side of his face - or at least, he would if he wasn't  so zoned in on the sensation of Harry's warm fingers pressing gently but firmly into his cheek.
Draco avoids her eyes, remembering what kind of memories she probably has associated with him. It's not everyday you're held captive in Malfoy Manor. There's no guarantee she'll set it aside as quickly as Hermione did.
She'd known when Harry had cupped the side of Draco's neck tenderly, when Draco had lost his train of thought and seized up, anticipation settling over his cheeks and coloring them red.
He twists his head around to catch Harry off guard with a weighted kiss, urgent and desperate like he's afraid it'll be his last.
Expecially not when he can see them together, all over each other like filthy dogs in heat. It's disgusting, Draco is disgusted.
It is nothing like casting a spell, Draco soon discovers, because his rock hits the water immediately with a large splash and a strong feeling of shame creeping into his cheeks.
In his other life, he'd have gladly died thinking Harry to be a pompous arsehole. But now, he can't sit next to the boy for five minutes without wanting to snog him senseless.
Harry listens to him, he checks up on him, cares for him. That should be enough; girlfriend and best friends and the whole of Hogwarts be damned.
Draco wishes he could yell at Harry that if the temperature was too cold in the afternoon, it surely would be unbearable at night, but he can't. It would be downright callous to criticise him for everything he's done tonight. And anyway, it would have been a lie- right now, Draco doesn't care about the cold.

But Draco manages. Subtlety is out of the question; he's rather evidently ignoring Harry when he darts out of class as quickly as he can, or conspicuously turns his eyes away when their gazes accidentally meet. But, he manages.
And then, without warning, Harry's lips are against his again. He tangles his hands into the front of Harry's shirt, needing to grasp at
- I'm aware that some chapters happen the day or night after the previous, but there are week jumps elsewhere. So between chapter 15 and this chapter, about two to three weeks has passed. It would be very boring and tedious to go through everyday, and plus that would make the story move toooo quickly.
Even if he wanted to, he has a feeling Harry wouldn't let him. His fleeting touches and gestures of closeness have become far less fleeting and
"I didn't know you were taking Care of Magical Creatures." Harry says, close enough behind him that Draco doesn't dare move, at risk of accidentally brushing him.
a plan for Harry. He doesn't know what he wants. It hurts, to see him with somebody else, but it would hurt more to be in a relationship with him, to have to drag him down like that. Draco's not stupid; he knows how they'd have to sneak around, shy away from cameras like they're doing something wrong. The articles that were released when the press caught wind of their
Draco can't fight down the small smile that spreads across his face. It dulls as they sit in a comfortable silence, staring out at the water's edge. Something in him feels as though he needs to return Harry's favour.
Unsettling is the wrong word, perhaps. In a way, Draco thinks it's touching. That Harry cares enough to look out for him like that. But the more reasonable side of him is screaming itself hoarse, telling him to stay far, far away.
He kicks the map underneath his bed in a smooth, fluid movement as he stands, stretching upwards and yawning theatrically.
But Draco shouldn't return to this place, regardless of how peaceful it may be. If Harry's been here once, he'll come back.
It means that he's asleep almost as soon as his head hits the pillow, which is a rarity; Draco's insomnia seldom shies away for any amount of weariness.
"Alright. Now flick your wrist forward, like this." Harry moves his hand slowly with Draco's demonstrating the action. "It's like casting a spell."
"How can you be sure-" Draco presses, and Harry lifts his other hand to pry Draco's fingers fully off his wrist.
A part of him wants to laugh at himself. He's behaving ludicrously. All he has to do is apologise, two little words,
At this, Draco's eyes widen. He doesn't think Ron would actually be able to get away with hexing him, not here, out in the open like this, but a threat is a threat, regardless of how shallow it may be. Also, it would take a great deal of courage to be
Draco folds his arms over his chest, wrapping his-no, Harry's- coat tighter around himself, as he watches Harry disappear behind one of the pillars. He returns a moment later, and Draco's eyes widen at what he'd gone to retrieve.
She does see, but she shouldn't. She shouldn't look. "Ginny loves you, and you love her. It can't be over."
"N-o, thank you." While Potter can waltz around doing just about anything perfectly, Draco's perfection comes from a very carefully selected set of talents he chooses to reveal to the world.
Okay,okay,okay. Few things first off before people start commenting about it, I know this is long but please read it if you're confused. Hear me out guys!
The interaction lasts but a moment , but there's a whole anthology of emotion written in Draco's mind by the time it's over.
Draco should watch where he's going. A shoulder slams into his, making him snap out of his contemplation and rub at the spot of impact. He can already feel the bruise starting to form.
He's overreacting, and he's able to introspect enough to realise that. It's not like as soon as there's barely a foot of distance between them he suddenly becomes public enemy number one.
Harry doesn't ask again when Draco doesn't answer, just keeps a firm handle on the broom. Draco appreciates that, it gives him time to breathe- in, and out, and to open his eyes a little.
Draco smiles. Harry's likely only saying it to make him feel better, but it's working. "I was what? I misheard that."
"And what exactly do you want?" Draco murmurs, the private  thought somehow finding its way onto his lips.
Having said all this, you'd be forgiven for thinking that maybe, Draco's dreading the apology. And he is, in a way. But he's always been annoyingly pragmatic, so he realises that the only way to deal with the fear is to attack the root.
Privately, he sources a little joy from the fact that Harry doesn't seem to be talking to Ron either. Or Ginny for that matter. It's a cruel twist of fate; finally Harry's free to be all Draco's, and he's not even Draco's anymore.
"We should get back." Harry says very suddenly, and as he moves away, Draco's serenity moves with him, bringing him crashing into reality again.
Draco sniffs irritably at Harry, making a show of waving his muggle watch around in the other boy's face. He can't cast very reliable Tempus charm with his new wand, so he's been reduced to wearing the clunky, silver plated thing under his robes. It can't be so bad; it was too expensive to be bad, even by muggle standards.
He wakes from another aforementioned nightmare late, so late in fact that the moon is still high in the sky, the sun yet to start it's long climb up into it's place in the center of the universe.
Ginny and Harry don't talk, don't sit next to each other, barely even glance at each other all through the next day. It's unsettling, really; how stressed and agitated Harry is. Draco wouldn't know what Ginny's feeling, he hasn't seen her at all. But just because Harry's still sitting with his friends, it doesn't mean he's avoiding his problems any less. Hermione had asked about Ginny's absence, but she was only met with a half hearted shrug from Harry, and a nudge from Ron to bite her tongue.
"Draco ..." Harry says, frowning, and his lack of eloquence makes a stone drop into Draco's stomach.
That's my point. We're not kids anymore. It's time to move on, Ron. Life's too short, you know that."
It was all going so well too. It's Draco's fault. His darling father would've scolded him for being so naive, so hopeful. The world's rougher than that, he's not a
It's warm too, regrettably, so he can't bring himself to think rationally and give it back. "Thank you." He says, when he realises he's been cozying up into the coat without a word for far too long.
." Draco mumbles out, but he's too far gone to inject any real warning into his words, sounding more abashed than threatening.
Once safely back in his room, Draco takes a moment to process what he heard. He knew Ginny and Harry had been fighting- Harry'd mentioned it
"No! Wait-" He says suddenly, making Harry's eyes light up again. "Forgive me, I was just ... confused."
"You're both in my life. Ron couldn't convince me to hate you, just like you can't convince me to hate Ron. I'm not going to pick. It's bloody ridiculous." He growls, scrubbing a hand over his eyes. Clearly, Harry's spent more than a moment's thought on this. "He's never overreacted like this."
It's the same speech Harry gave to himself when he made the decision to befriend Draco. He took a chance, went out on a limb; and in the end it all turned out quite well.
"Oh dear. I've said something wrong, haven't I?" She says, looking at Hermione, then Harry with wide eyes.
Perhaps Harry would be his solitary star. But the stars' only commitment is to the moon. Harry's commitments are far from singular.
"I didn't know." Harry murmurs. Draco can see the pity radiating off of him like a disease. "Will you get it back?"
Draco clenches his jaw. Of course, he didn't expect Ron to warm up to him instantly, but still, it feels like a step backwards.
"What would I do without you?" Harry murmurs under his breath, and they share an intimate smile, the rest of the world not privy to their closeness- Draco certainly shouldn't be either.
Thank God Hermione was too busy with rather aggressively dragging Harry out of bed than her surroundings.
The jealously that is usually aroused in situations like this is misplaced by a deep admiration this time. He can hate their relationship as much as he wants, but he can't deny what an amazing boyfriend Harry is.
Even if Draco's small freak out was unwarranted, it did make him collect himself a bit more. The pain from his hand sobers him further. A
Draco's eyes wander to Harry's, expectant, but he's confronted with an accusatory glare instead of a supportive one. He resigns easily.
That surprises Draco. Ron and Ginny he understands, but Hermione? Why would Harry's cold shoulder extend to her?
"Stubborn git. I was going to say that it was really well done." He says, grinning at the blonde boy.
Disclaimer : I do NOT support engaging in a relationship with someone purely because you believe they can 'save you' or because you are in a vulnerable place. They maybe be taking advantage of you without either of you realising it. Draco and Harry's relationship in this story is NOT something anyone should aspire to, and it is pure FICTION.
He knocks on the door, as nervous as he was last time he did so, but for remarkably different reasons. "It's Draco." He calls through the wood.
"You didn't have to." Harry half smiles, like he's fully aware of his shabbiness, daring Draco to say something more.
Harry knows how personal this is to Ron. God knows how the Malfoys have beaten down his family to smithereens with their vicious vocal tirades. It couldn't
His room is, for once, uncomfortably empty. Well, it's always empty, but not uncomfortably- disconcertingly so. Now the dull, static air eats into Draco's already isolation -damaged psyche, making his already intense shivers infinitely worse.
"I don't want to be my father." Draco blurts suddenly, disrupting the calm. He feels Harry's eyes turn towards him, but his own gaze remains unflinchingly steered towards the river. "When I leave here, I don't want to become what he wanted me to be."
Draco scarcely breathes, at risk of Harry feeling the shuddering gasps. He needn't worry - the pulse beating away wildly under Harry's palm is a dead giveaway of his anticipation.
It's probably midday when Draco tears himself away from his tear-soaked pillow, detangling himself from suffocating blankets and numbly walking to the tea-set he'd brought with him. He's not hungry, but there's a dull ache in his stomach, telling him he should probably eat.
"I don't know. On occasion, maybe. He's my father, regardless of everything else." It's the truth. Maybe Draco doesn't miss Lucius, but he surely does miss the idea of him. The idea of having a father. It's what he always clung to, through all the times Lucius made him feel like he wasn't his son. "Do ... you? Miss your father?"
"Draco, I asked you to sit with me, right? And you said yes, so sit with me. You're not here because of them." Harry says, offering him a lopsided grin that traps Draco's breath in his throat.
It isn't easy. And Draco's rushing this quickly before it's over. Because even if Harry believes, with every inch of his heart, that he wants Draco, there's always going to be a part of him that yearns for what he had with Ginny.
From there on out, Harry's a lot more ... forward towards Draco. A wave here and there across the dining hall, or a chaste tap on the shoulder in greeting. It's small things, undetectable by others, yet it's the highlight of the past three days for Draco. He yearns for the comfort, the stillness he feels when he's with Harry. Because then, even if just for a moment, the whole world, all his problems, they slip away into obscurity.

"You're upset. With me?" Harry asks, and Draco's sure that if he could see him he'd have that concerned look of his all over his face. It would probably break Draco's attempt at a stoic resolve.
If only there were a book amongst these millions to teach him how to stop feeling the way he does towards Harry; oh, how he'd give that book his full and undivided attention.
He can work alone, it's not the end of the world. He's already lived through that, and it did not feel so trivial, of that he's sure.
"I know, alright? I know. Relax. It's all fine." His hand is back in it's familiar position, dancing over his neck. Draco shudders in barely repressed pleasure, and Harry can't help the smug grin that finds it's way onto his face.
Potter, with his ever empathetic nature, picks up on the lack of spite from the usually very spiteful blonde.
It's Harry's turn to wrinkle his nose. "Sweets? For breakfast? Here I was thinking you were an adult, Draco."
Well, not entranced. It's not magical nor captivating in any pleasant way. He's watching a car crash unfold, not admiring a beautiful sunset.
Something in Draco physically recoils at that. The idiot has no idea what relationship Draco and his father share-
The lake is uncharacteristically empty when Draco arrives. It plants a small seed of worry in Draco's head.
"Draco! It's Harry." That snaps him into action. He scrambles out of bed and tugs his trousers on, throwing a sweater over his night shirt.
Harry's annoyingly stubborn. Actually, it makes sense he's bonded so well with the people he has; they're
Oh, how Draco envies her. Not for being able to kiss Harry, or sleep next to him, or rake her hands through his untameable mop of hair; but for being able to just

grew to have an acceptable understanding of non verbal spells. He supposes if he had more practice he'd be brilliant, (probably even able to protect himself from people like that Gryffindor) but as learning non verbal spells wasn't really a big priority in his life, what with the aftermath of the war and all, he's just average.
It's the strangest feeling he's ever had - like he's here, but not really, like he's actually far away in some Neverland, floating in a sea of carefree calm. He very nearly shuts his eyes, but even in his state, he knows how much that would reveal.
"Thank you." He says, in earnest. He doesn't like that Hermione knows, but it's a kind gesture, and he's recently grown rather fond of those.
He knew that before, really. It's why he came to Ron, not the other way around like Draco did yesterday. They're both stubborn, but in different ways, which means Harry's got to get through to Ron differently.
"I told you that i'd been playing Quidditch again ... more and more recently, actually. I'm not joining the team or anything, nothing competitive-" Draco's glad for that. He hasn't been to a single Quidditch match; he doesn't think he could stomach it ever again, and if Harry played, he's not sure Hermione would give in so easily about making him go. "I just missed flying. Don't you?"
