“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again. Harry looked to Millicent to see if she already knew about this, but she was too busy talking to Ginny to notice Percy striding over toward and a girl with long, curly hair, his chest thrust out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Thanks for sticking with me. I love this fandom and all of you.
“The smallest bottle will get us through, toward the Stone.”
Thankfully, he was not alone.
“For how to outlast this woman,” Pansy said, taking a seat opposite them on the other couch. Harry could feel Draco’s weight pressed against his side. He thought about moving
Harry started at a noise from the Gryffindor table. One of the ghosts was removing, no, almost removing his head before replacing it to the horror of some of the students and the entertainment for some of the old ones.
“What? George, speak up,” said the obnoxious blonde boy.
“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly.
“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”
And Jo Rowling, if you're reading this, call me. I have an idea.
Harry smiled.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence – the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and one, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and dropped his lamp, it
“Yeah?” asked Harry, encouraging her to continue.
“Sorry, I had to wait for Goyle to go to sleep. He’s normally out like a light, but it seemed like he was waiting for something tonight.”
Harry had later apologized, and Draco hoped they were done with it. He should have known better.
“But Harry…what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”
No one slept that night, and everywhere they went security was tighter than ever. Ron had become an instant celebrity due to his near death experience.
Umbridge turned sharply on her heels.
Harry stood facing the mirror, watching as his mother stroked his hair and his father smiled down at him.
“Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, Nott…..”
“While I saw Potter here, as nothing more than a nuisance, something that stood in the way of Cass becoming a champion Cass thought that Potter was a good kid, defiant, unruly but better than most.” Ely eyed the crowd, contemptuously.
“I don’t know, Harry, Snape May not be your favorite Professor, but I don’t think he’d go against Dumbledore. He’s smarter than that.”
“Salazar, this place is going to the dogs, that oaf teaching classes. My father’ll have a fit when I tell him.”
“I threw it because for once seeing Wood win was better than seeing him lose.”
“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “It seems you’ve inherited some of his talents. He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”
“Then what, Draco?” Harry moved toward him. “As far as I’m concerned you’re the one who doesn’t trust me.”
“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables. Harry noticed as he passed that the tables were positioned exactly beneath the four house tables alone in the Great Hall. Harry supposed that the dishes full of food were transported to their counterparts above at mealtimes.
His reflection winked at him, and he felt something drop into his pocket.
He could almost hear Malfoy mocking him. But he knew that even Malfoy would not allow him to be subjected to this if he knew what his home life was really like. No one would assume that he was a pampered prince anymore. He breathed a quiet sigh of relief as the footsteps walked back him. He rubbed at his mark once again, and felt a twinge in his thigh where the mark lies. He tried to ignore, but it came back, sharp then burning, like someone had turned on a heater and pushed it to close to his leg.
Millicent took Hagrid’s flute to her lips and blew. It was better than Harry could manage and Fluffy seemed to be appeased. Hermione looked at Millicent quite impressed.
“Early? How inconsiderate? Do they think that that we have nothing else better to do then to make sure that you get gone some place? We could have been out and not returned until five o’clock on the nose.” Harry merely rolled his eyes, knowing that they would have complained either way.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at breakfast. They were all the same. Harry even saw Malfoy get one.
The blonde boy scoffed, reminding Harry sharply of a younger Draco. “Those are just urban legends.”
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
Harry’s head hit the back of the tombstone.
“Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act and who was acting of their own freewill.”
“Aw,” said Snape. “So, it was incompetence. Brilliant.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry could hear the boos from his housemates as the Gryffindor team walked out onto the field, and smiled a little as they told the commentator what they thought of his comments. Flint and Wood walked to the center of the field with Madam Hooch for a few last minute rules.
Mrs. Zabini ran her fingers up and down the spine of her wine glass.
“Thanks, Dobby,” Harry said with a broad smile.
“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in here….”
“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. “There was someone behind the trees….they shouted words…an incantation…” Crouch seemed to doubt Hermione’s words, but none of the other Ministry wizards apart from him seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of chocolate and watched Lupin move to extinguish the lamps, he thought of how to ask his next question.
Sorry, I've been missing lately. I have no excuses because I hate when writers complain about their real lives. So, here is more of the story to make up for my absence and negligence. I love you all and appreciate every comment and kudos.
Harry walked into the Great Hall and immediately spotted Malfoy drinking his poncey tea and refusing Goyle so much as a sip.
“What…live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?”
“Which one will get you back through the purple flame?”
Warrington’s body hit the ground beside him, the pain in his scar reached such a pit that he retched. Cassius Warrington was spread eagle on the ground. The Slytherin was dead. Harry stared into the face of his competitor, his school mate, Ely’s boyfriend, someone’s child, someone’s friend, and heard the scream of someone in Voldemort’s circle.
“Is it you?” he asked once more before all hell broke loose. Draco tried to turn and run, but Harry got both his hands before he could pivot an inch in that direction. Draco pulled, desperate to get his hands out of Harry’s grip, but he was unrelenting. Draco was unable to get to his wand.
Harry stood beside Petunia on the coral pink rug that she had picked out herself. He can see the pictures of Dudley on the mantelpiece, in the same place that they have always been. The nightly news is still playing on the television. Dudley’s pre-bed snack sits half eaten on the kitchen table, but the chair he was sitting in has been overturned. Everything looks the same, and Harry has the strange urge to abandoned Petunia and start cleaning everything up.
“Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt…I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
Mr. Weasley was right, they did have good seats. They were close to the Minister himself, and Millicent and her family. Harry waved at her, and noticed the rather similar looking but older girl sitting beside Millicent looking bored even with all the excitement in the air.
lending light along with the roaring fire emanating out of the ornate fireplace. In front of the fireplace in a lowered alcove were multiple chairs and couches were some students were already congregating. Doors lined all the other walls leading here and there, except for the far wall and part of the ceiling.
“see that there, that silvery stuff shinin’ on the ground? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the
Harry could see how even a girl who seemed to have it all like Fleur would envy his friend. Hermione was a force to be reckoned with. She knew it, and she made sure that others knew it too.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”
Just as the two men were about to launch into their plans, Harry said, “There’s one more thing.”
The boy Harry had danced with wanted to kiss Harry. Malfoy wanted to kill him.
“You mean, Snape can turn into a bat,” asked Harry, a shudder moving through him.
Thank you all for reading, commenting, leaving kudos, loving this story, and perhaps loving it so much you curse my name and wish I'd fall into a vat of hot lava....., well, a girl can only wish that she makes anyone feel that much about her story good or bad.
“Yeah,” said Millicent. “It will be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade.”
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a question. Harry started with an excuse, but McGonagall put her hand up.
“I don’t get it…What happened?” said Harry, wiping some sweat off his brow.
Tracey looked quite put out about it, but took his hand anyway.
“Together?” he said quietly.
“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was watching Harry closely.
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
“No.” Harry yelled at the same time Millicent yelled, “Yes.”
“For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. “Is this a hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist….”
Harry was a brilliant auror, and Draco knew it wouldn’t take him long to figure out Dra…their secret, and Draco wasn’t sure if his resolve could last against all those soft things or not. But he knew that Harry could never ever know about their connection. Not ever.
And he did…first his head then his body. Tall and untidy hair like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed then fell out the end of Voldemort’s wand. He walked close to Harry. Harry wanted to reach out to him, but knew he couldn’t. His parents could no more embrace him now than they had ever done.
To anyone else it would have looked like the horde of students were just returning to their rooms eager to get close to the fireplace. But as Tracey Davis nudged Millicent in comradery, Harry knew there was something in the air.
Then, Remus touched his shoulder.
“Petrificus Totalus!”
“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed….”
“No,” said Harry calmly. “It shouldn’t have, but you know that’s not Ely’s fault. Don’t you, sir?”
They listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
“And then, there’s Millicent, and Sirius, while I am aware that you have spent a good chunk of time in Azkaban you should know that whatever terrors you may have
I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point, but how you handled that dragon was simply amazing. Don’t get complacent though, Harry. You’ve only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you.
Harry watches Draco as he stalks toward the kitchen and the bathroom. He thinks briefly about following him, but if anything the Elmer’s Lock Incident taught him was that Draco was very concerned about personal space. Harry was pretty sure that the concierge at that place in Prague was still feeling Draco’s hex after they were forced to share one bed in their hotel instead of two.
“If you think life right now is shit just wait, Potter. Cass has got it easy now. The dead don’t have to make any choices.”
Blaise sat his chair back up, and the few people who sniggered when he fell were now getting back to work.
“You got a Firebolt and the first thing you do is hide it under your bed?” Flint sounded scandalized. Shocked and disgusted.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.
“So,” said Hagrid. “if you wan’ ter come a bit nearer.” A few people cautiously approached the fence, Blaise among them.
Harry turned prepared to get out of the water, when he heard something splash behind him. Harry sighed heavily assuming that Myrtle had come to take a peek after all.
“Lucius Malfoy may have a long arm, but this is my territory, and there is no crossing boundaries unless someone has my say so.”
“Rule one in sentient magical objects, Mr. Potter, they are rarely able to destroyed so easily. This mirror will fight for its life against you, even if that means soaking your energy to stay beside it forever.”
“You’re going to ask him to strip for you?” asked Blaise.
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” Ron continued.
Harry was surprised when Flint, of all people, came to see him. “I’m just checking to make sure that you can still compete,” he said, but Harry was glad he came anyway.
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that spread over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer….”
“Mount your brooms, please,”
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open until you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, or like his common room wouldn’t open unless you said a specific phrase.
(Thank you all for bringing this to my attention.)
“It looks like he’s going to have a coronary.”
from scoring.”
Harry nodded.
As Harry was walking to his room, he overhead some yelling from Percy and Ron’s room. “You’re not going anywhere until you’ve found my badge!” yelled Percy.
Professor Lupin nodded.
A Very Merry Christmas to you
“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred.
“Why not? That woman had the nerve to write quite a few scandalous things when I was out of the country this summer, and I intend to make her pay for each and every word, and if I have to do that through you, then I’m okay with it.”
“Soon,” Harry echoed and then Padfoot was flying away into the night.
That was the first time that Harry had gotten Draco his tea.
“I’d be upset to if I had that head of hair,” Tracey Davis said tossing her long perfectly straight hair over her shoulder. Harry wanted to hex all her hair into the floor.
“This”, said Flint. “is the Golden Snich, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s fast and difficult to see, and you have to catch it before the other team’s seeker does. Whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. The game ends when the Snitch is caught. Three months is the record, but I would expect any of my players to beat that if it mean getting a win.”
“And I know that Millicent Bulstrode is one talented witch. She’s strong and crafty. She’s got a smart mouth and is both cunningly evil, and beautiful….And I know that while she was pretending to enjoy her breakfast that she was making a mental list of all the people that had sent those fowl things, and she’s going to destroy them in the most elegant way possible because she is a Slytherin. But I am a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors prefer to do things the messy way.”
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks…I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmistress if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.”
“There, look.”
“Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes narrowed.
“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the house cup.”
“You is not insulting my master miss! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard. Mr. Crouch was right to sack bad Winky.”
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight.
“They’re getting hungry. Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up. I don’t think they could resist the large crowd around the pitch. All that excitement, emotions running high….it was their idea of a feast.”
Harry turned to her.
Harry nodded. He had seen the influx of different wizards. He had heard a group of kids their age speaking French not a few moments ago.
Harry was in the library intent on getting his Potion’s essay done before next class. Snape never did like to take points from Slytherin, but the man did seem to take a sick pleasure in taking points from Harry and making him even more of a social pariah. Hermione and Millicent sat in front of him. Millicent was dutifully copying some source information for a Herbology essay while keeping her face perfectly stoic. Hermione, on the other hand, was having more difficulty keeping focused.
“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”
“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You should drink that directly, Lupin.”
“If my mother didn’t tell me that I couldn’t refuse any eligible wizard you could forget it, but” Then she turned to dance with the boy.
Draco was.
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made them all very nervous. Harry urged Hagrid to let the dragon go, but Hagrid said he was too little.
of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.
Lupin’s face was blank but his eyes shone with something Harry couldn’t name.
“Yes, well the evidence was pretty damning.”
“What?” asked Hermione. “But everyone else is going that way.”
Then Harry noticed that someone else was standing by the fire.
I don't own HP. I just love them.
“See you over the summer, then.”
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?”
“No, sir and No, sir,” replied Harry.
Draco thought about checking no before answering honestly. As long as they didn’t need to know who, it didn’t matter anyway. The following questions were more intimate.
Harry rolled his eyes, but didn’t respond.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?” He was headed down the hall fielding Malfoy’s remarks when he heard someone else call his name.
Draco walked quickly down the street, the sound of footsteps behind him echoing loudly, but there were still too many people between him and a safe apparition point. Just as he was about to stop and confront the man, he turned only to see that no one was there. He turned back and reached for his wand, but it was too late, someone had stunned him and he was being whipped along in a side apparition.
tell Miss Granger even Gryffindor will suffer. She isn’t here, but don’t think I didn’t see her outside of the staff room. Professor Snape shooed her off as soon as she was finished asking Professor Flitwick her questions.”
“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually. “he wouldn’t take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. Millicent was still breathing, but it looked as if she had been knocked out.
gave up her seat beside Harry.
“ Yeah, don’t worry, Dad,” said George.
Wait, was being a pyro catching? Maybe he should put a hold on the Prophet flames.
Harry had been looking forward to the game, but now it seemed as if it was just going to be another lesson. Everytime he felt a chill Harry shuddered involuntarily. The sky was getting so dark it looked as if it were filled with dementors, cloak to cloak ready to watch the match like everyone else.
Remus says, “Hi”, and reiterates everything that I said about your scar. We’re concerned for you. And we’ll write soon.
Draco cleared his head.
The hood was removed from his face, revealing Draco’s father.
So he knew. Harry stumbled backward.
The blast ended skrewts and boggart were nothing compared to Warrington’s voice angry and just a tinge frightened when he heard the boy shout not an hour into the trial.
‘It’s you, mate,” said Ron. “The schools divided, two Hogwarts champions, one younger, one older. One, is a Slytherin brute and one is known to have friends in other houses and to be an all around decent kind of guy. The rivalry is real, Harry.”
Harry and Ron had come up with a brilliant plan to plot their demises in new and creative ways to appease Trewlaney, but there was no easy way out for them with the essays they had to write for Professor Binns about the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. While Harry’s head of house Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes for a mystery test that Harry was sure was going to involve a poisoning at some point in the future. While Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms.
“Just too long without flying I guess,” Harry lied.
“Not all of us have a new stepfather with a villa,” replied Harry.
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. As the sun began to rise Harry could hardly believe that he had left Pivet Drive only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three completely Dursley-free weeks.
“I owled Flint here and asked if he wanted to have a little one on one at the old pitch and he accepted my challenge.”
“And this is merely the summer home,” said Blaise, coming up beside him.
Harry blocked out the rest of their discussion, but tried to take it to heart.
“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand, sweeping it until its beams fell on a pair of feet. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor, stunned. There was no sign of Mr. Crouch at all. Dumbledore pointed his wand at Krum and uttered, “Rennervate.”
“O’….of course, Professor,” Hagrid said, smiling brightly at the thought of Buckbeak’s escape. “Come in, come on in….”
“Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now, Okay, so we’ve had the worst luck in the world….injuries, tournaments being called off, but we also know we’ve got the Best. Ruddy. Team. In. The. School,” he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the same manic glint in his eyes that Harry often saw in Flint’s. Malfoy and a few of the others started laughing, but Flint silenced them with a lifted hand, his eyes never leaving Oliver Wood.
“Of course I did,” said Flint, looking rather fondly at Oliver.
It was the man’s eyes that did it. One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye, and then it rolled right over, pointing at the back of the man’s head so that all they could see was whiteness.
The dissenters nodded meekly before filtering out of the Hall. Harry nodded to his friends and they too, walked away. Ely moved off as well, but Harry couldn’t let him go.
“Do you think he’s coming to save you? Do you think he’s going to rescue you? No,” the man said. “He didn’t want you then did he? You were obviously right there right under his nose, and yet I can still smell the burning skin? I bet you’ve never even been with anyone else.”
“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire.”
want it is that sometimes you choose wrong, and humans do have a knack for choosing precisely those thing that are wrong for them.”
“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as he did, Harry knew where his wand had went.
“It isn’t worth it, Pro... Remus,” he said. But Remus stepped further into the room.
“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from around his navel. “Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!”
“See you around Malfoy,” said Harry. “It was great talking to you, but Blaise and I have got to get to class.”
“As you wish, Unhonourable Disgrace to the name of Black,” Kreature murmured again to a Sirius who was looking anywhere but at the elf.
“You should have realized Peter, that if Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter,” said Lupin.
Harry settled into their first Defense Against the Dark Arts class with his copy of The Dark Forces: A Guide To Self Protection, and waited for class to start. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive clunky footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooded foot protruding out from under his robes.
Sirius smiles at him comfortingly. “No worries, kiddo. Would you like some breakfast? Moony’s made pancakes.”
“Azkaban, he won’t be getting out of it this time. Those contacts that you have been working gave him up as fast as they could.”
“Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the extraordinary nurse.
“Professor Dumbledore told me all about it.”
“Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,” said Mr. Weasley. “The terror it inspired…you have no idea, you’re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house and knowing what you’re about to find inside….” Mr. Weasley winced. “Everyone’s worst fear….the very worst….”
“Potter,” Moody growled. “You’re next.”
Flint smiled a little.
It was almost as if none of them had ever encountered a silencing charm. Amateurs.
“It’s in my school bag,” Harry said.
The courtroom was large and grand. A hundred people or more were sitting in the stands, looking down at him, some with serious expressions on their faces and some with condemning ones.
It looked as though Harry had found out what the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
to be getting back to Slytherin table anyway. Blaise had been trying and failing not to eye him for the past few minutes.
“You mean we could share?” asked Harry. Draco opened his mouth to vehemently deny that he ever alluded to any such thing, but Harry continued.
“You did the right thing,” Remus said. “But the Ministry is out to prove something, and whether you like it or not, you and Sirius are both influential people. It doesn’t help that a werewolf is also in your company.”
A stunned and giggling Angelina was then pulled into his arms and the two took off where Angelina and her former partner who was now dealing with smoke coming from his pants left off.
Messers. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present
“Potter….what’s,” said Warrington. “Harry?” And then a cold voice, “Take care of the spare.”
“And yet you denied her any rights.”
“Did he really murder thirteen people with one curse?”
“Me too,” said Harry, congratulating his new loved up friend.
“Draco,” Harry said again. “Please, please I didn’t know.”
We do all have to be good at something. Great positivity, Blaise.
Harry struggled to get loose, but then someone else had his other arm before he could get free. He pulled himself to the ground, hoping to dislodge the two assailants that were holding him back. He learned a few things after fighting off Dudley and his friends all those years. But this was different.
Millicent didn’t know the full extent of his time with the Dursley’s, but he had a feeling the Slytherins knew more than they let on. Harry slipped out of the room their eyes on his back.
Harry shouted, but water rushed into his mouth. Finally, his foot met something solid, and Harry was able to kick himself free. In a hurry, he placed his hands on the side of the large bath, and tried to push himself up. A loud screeching filled the room then, and Harry lost his grip on the side of the tub in a hurry to protect his ears from the sound. He had heard this before. It was the merpeople. Harry turned, and faced the open water. There was nothing there.
“Yes,” Quirrell laughed. “He was trying to frighten me. Like he could with Lord Voldemort on my side.”
Harry had been wondering the same thing. It made sense as to why Black had automatically went to the tower in search of Harry, but why had he left witnesses?
Flint snorted. “Of course it wasn’t, Bulstrode, nothing ever seems to be Potter’s fault.”
Before Harry could ask what type was that, the remains of their food faded from their plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the deserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,
“I should have known,” Blaise said, leaning toward Harry. “Who else would be barmy enough to have assigned us a biting book?”
Harry keeps quiet, because maybe he did kill the older boy after all. The sinking feeling in his stomach would certainly suggest so.
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeons an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. Why did Snape hate him so much? What had he done? And just how was he supposed to learn all this with a teacher who seemed bent on humiliating and cornering him every chance that he got?
Quirrell smirked.
“If I find that you have besmirched our house in any way you will face consequences, and I do not mean a loss in house points.”
“Ever want a repe….”
Harry hadn’t needed any more instructions. He had thrown some clothes on, and had thankfully had enough foresight to grab one of the school broom’s from the shed because when he got to the pitch Flint was already there waiting impatiently, only his broom in hand.
“Then, to Ms. Millicent Bulstrode for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Slytherin House fifty points.”
“A tracking spell,” Fred supplied. “That means that no matter where she is, that Malfoy can find her. In case she gets spooked by the little ghoul and decides to make it a run for it before he can cattle her down the aisle.”
“What could be wrong? It would take strong magic to jinx his broom,” said Blaise.
Draco had been bracing for the inevitable confrontation all night. Harry would look at him with those big, green, clear eyes and Draco would want to give in and tell him the truth. He knew that if he did that Harry might forgive him. But he had gone this long without letting anyone know the truth of his circumstances. He wouldn’t let Harry be with him out of pity.
Remus sighs.
Krum opened his eyes, he looked dazed.
He turned to see Millicent walking up the stairs from the dungeons. Wow, Harry thought. Millicent was wearing a deep green almost black suede strapless dress that fit her incredibly well. Her hair was beautifully done in loose waves to one side, the jewels she was wearing only exemplified the fact that she was definitely shining.
Millicent shook her head.
Harry nodded. He understood. His friends were behaving exactly the same way.
“Millicent,” a voice called. “What are you doing?”
No, Harry thought. He didn’t think Voldemort would be pleased at all.
“I can’t believe we are finally going to meet Basks,” said a young girl with purple hair and a nose piercing.
He gave an unexpected harsh laugh and then clapped his gnarly hands together.
As soon as not Moody saw Harry hit the ground, he stood and with a fierce anger in his crazy eyes he fired the Dark Mark into the sky. Then before anyone could do anything, he slung killing curse after killing curse at Harry.
“Can’t, Ron, sorry,” said Hagrid, glancing at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.
Harry stood there, speechless.
“No,” Harry screeched trying to fight his way back to the mirror. He has to see them. He had too. He would go back to the Dursley’s tomorrow for fighting Snape, but tonight he had to see them.
“You ought to be ashamed, Dobby, talking about your masters that way.”
He didn’t have time to waste with Malfoy. He had to see if there was something he could do about Hagrid.
“Let me speak to him….face-to-face….”
“You’re an arsehole,” Goyle said to Harry.
“You do,” Harry said.
Then after removing the sonorous from his voice, hsaid a little hoarsely, “They’ll be talking about this one for years.”
Harry didn’t dare look back at his Head of House as he left the room with Lupin and Ron.
The Marauders Map
He didn’t want to box himself in. He had never really felt anything serious for a member of either sex, but there had to be reason he never noticed any of the girls at Hogwarts before, but could still remember what Bill Weasley was wearing the first time they met.
Harry couldn’t think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
“WEASLEY!”
“Arthur…it’s not…Him?”
He meant his mark, he knew he did. Draco stood. He wasn’t going to let Harry bully him into an argument. He couldn’t see his mark no matter what. He stepped forward. Draco moved back. And things changed.
Harry let Greg go after that, having decided that it was enough for the day. Being able to cast Protego might not necessarily be on the curriculum, but it was something that Greg needed to know especially with Voldemort being back, and Goyle’s father being one of the men that Harry had seen in the graveyard that night.
The group rushed outside. “Dad, it’s just the Irish,” said Fred.
While the discussion of what Winky was being paid went far worse.
Sirius chuckled lowly.
“She was brushing the dirt off his face, not beating him with a wet rag, Weasley.”
“Don’t you dare let go, Potter!” it said. Its voice distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort, his wide eyes said that he had no more expected this than Harry had.
“What?” said Harry. “How?”
He laughed. “I guess fighting off a troll really makes you hungry. McGonagall did say something about the food being brought to the common rooms.”
“Same,”
It had been the first time that anyone had said something like that to Harry, and it felt good.
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled, but they were the only ones.
“Forgot?” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ‘earts goin’ that fast…” Harry gave him a look that said continue. After Stan stopped shaking he went on.
“Leave!”
Harry squeezed a piece of flesh on Malfoy’s side. “Jealous?”
Hermione tried to help Sirius.
Then Warrington and Ely’s head popped above the water. Cassius seemed to cradle his boyfriend as the two made their way to the platform. Ely was enjoying the attention, allowing Cassius to garner the cheers of the crowd for saving him. Cassius helped Ely on to the platform and the Slytherin boy took a deep nod toward the people.
“Kids, now!” he said in a tone Harry had never heard from the older man before.
“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”
“You don’t have to tell me that,” Remus said. “We both saw the same thing the other night, Sirius.”
The champions were dismissed and Harry started the long walk back to Slytherin on his own. Warrington had took off in the opposite direction and Harry didn’t bother to try and find out where he had gone.
Harry fights to get his wand out of his pocket, but the dementor has more to feed on this year than his kind did two years ago. Harry can hear a body hit the ground, and agonizing screams fill the air, and he knows that it is Sirius.
“I shoulda known there was something’ fishy goin’ on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it ter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he’d bin the Potter’s Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.”
Professor Lupin seemed to consider him.
“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens that you won’t go looking for…”
“Fancy a swim?” the man asked in Harry’s ear.
Pansy stiffened.
“Though my French did come in handy tonight.” He looked over at Fleur. “Thanks for the introduction by the way,” he taunted.
“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. When he appeared once again, he was dragging something or someone along with him.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore gave a warning look over the hall.
Then reared back and Harry had nowhere to hide, and he couldn’t run. He was going to get flayed alive.
“You’re a witch, which makes you different. You’re a brilliant witch, which makes you even more different. And you’re the kind of person who calls people out on their crap and who willingly goes with two kids who don’t know that
“Retirement means that the house elf is put down.”
“I don’t even know how he did it, but….oh, Harry, it’s so bad. And gosh, now, she’ll never agree to go with me when she hears about this…” Ron trailed off.
“I certainly do,” said Fudge.
The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.
“Home?” said Remus walking towards him. “Now, tell me, Harry, do you really consider Number Four Pivet Drive your home?”
“I believe Harry said goodbye to you. Didn’t you hear him?”
After getting the water, they met up with a few more familiar faces. Oliver Wood spotted Ron’s red head, and mistaking him briefly for one of the twins stopped and pulled him into a quick conversation. He had made the Puddlemere Untied Quidditch team and Harry felt happy for him. Wood was a good player. He knew from
“A speaker for the defense.”
“Of course not,” said Pansy, disdainfully. “That wouldn’t have been appropriate.”
“Did you ever see a mind healer for that one, Potter, or not, because I really think you should consi….”
“Why?” said Percy curiously.
Harry knew that it would take time for Sirius to be free entirely, but he was glad that his days at Pivet Drive were numbered.
“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws, but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker.”
Harry went back to the dungeons, and knew that someway he had to make it up to Professor Lupin. He just didn’t know how. He was almost there, when he ran into a shaking Hermione.
“Don’t mention it, Dobby, it was merely a present for the work you do for the school,” Blaise added, sounding a bit rehearsed.
There were older voices too. Apparently Rita had run another article, and the whole population of England thought that Krum deserved someone better. But as far as Harry knew Millicent wasn’t interested in Krum like that. She had told him the day after the ball. We just get along, she had said, and that was it. Harry had believed her.
“Let’s have a change in subject. Millicent have you got nothing to say about Harry’s new look.”
Harry wanted to scream, but in the end he didn’t have to say a word.
“Fluffy?”
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. He was alone….completely alone…
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
Remus started, his tea spurting from his mouth.
“I said to meet me by the gate three minutes ago, Wood.” The man looked like he had last year. Large, burly, with a no nonsense air about him, and that tone in his voice that said that Harry…no Wood, this time, would be running extra laps.
“This is a masquerade ball, Potter, no one hear even knows who you are. This is the time for you to forget that little fact as well. As a matter of fact, how about we give you another name? Alberto, Renato, perhaps…. Silven?”
people like Ron or Malfoy didn’t have much of a head start.
“Remember that we don’t think it’s the brightest thing to do, but we’re here for you no matter what.”
“Me loving him was never the problem.”
“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble as it is. If I hadn’t been here to save your skin.”
Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
“That doesn’t mean that you don’t love him.”
“He’s a werewolf,” said Hermione. “The sickliness, that time Snape took over his classes, the essay…”
Flint leveled him with the old “Captain’s glare”. It almost made Harry feel nostalgic.
“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”
Flint moved to the front of the group, and started to read out room assignments.
“It was years ago, Potter, no need to get all head up about it. We paid the price for the crimes that we committed that’s it. What happened to Basks?” Draco asked, hoping to
“It was a retirement present,” Harry defended. Now, he was pissed, “I don’t understand that. You’re my best friend. We spend nearly every day together and you’re telling me that you don’t think you mean more to me than our old librarian?”
Harry thought for a moment of trying to see if Professor McGonagall would sigh his slip, but thought better of it.
Harry stood. “I’ll see you later, Ron.”
All the love, my beautiful fandom family.
Krum looked around as if he was concerned they were being listened too.
“I know Eloise to be a very respectable kind of girl. So, I’m not too sure if I believe you, Zabini.”
“What about you?”
“Stay there,” she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girl’s dormitories Millie right on her heels. Harry and Ron barley have time to exchange a mystified look before the pair are heading back down the stairs,
Sensing Winky wouldn’t be up for anymore conversation the group walked away. The other house elves plied them with food and Hermione promised that she’d knit Dobby a new sweater.
I had seen that rat hundreds of times. I knew it was him. And I knew I had to get out. He was with Harry, and I had..I had…”
“I have something to ask you,” said Harry. “Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You now that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”
“Look at the state of his robes. He dresses like our old house elf.”
Harry knew he was in the hospital wing. He didn’t even need to open his eyes to tell. He could feel the familiar lumps in the hospital bed’s mattress. He could hear Madam Pomfrey humming slightly as she moved from place to place. He could taste the bland, chalklike substance in his mouth that spoke of having being forced fed some pepper up potion. Harry decided to just lay for a second, and enjoy the bright light shining through his eye lids. His body was sore, but it was nothing like the pain he had felt when he had come crawling through that hallway.
Harry was never more amazed by magic than in moments like this. Flying, spells, those were one thing, but the Great Hall for the Yule Ball was spectacular. Snow drifted from the ceiling, glitter and shine had replaced the dark wood and boring paint.
The teachers had tried to stop it, but no one could seem to get the howlers to quiet. Quite a few of them had set off to get Professor Flitwick. Millicent continued to eat her breakfast. Only those closest to her could see that her hand was beginning to shake. But she was proud. She was a snake, and she was not going to let these people see her break. But Harry knew that it was getting close and that a person could only take so much. Some of the other Slytherins had tried to form a circle around her, but anytime one of them got close, the howlers would seem to attack. It was like they wanted to make sure that Millicent could be seen by the whole populous.
“Ah, yes,” said Moody. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can cast the Cruciatus. But you need to really mean this curse. You have to want to cause your enemy pain. You don’t need power, just feeling.”
“You’re a menace,” Remus said, as he successfully smacked Sirius’ hand away as he reached once again for another piece of the man’s bacon.
“Happy Christmas,” she greeted. “I liked my new broach Zabini, steal it from your mother?”
“Weasley! You idiot!” shouted Millicent.
“We’re making a move, Potter. Keep up for full tilt.”
“Yeah,” Millicent said. “I think I’m going to go get something to eat,” she said pointedly looking at Harry. Harry smiled, grateful that all it took was taking on a giant troll for Millicent to realize that Pansy and her horde weren’t nearly as important as she thought they were.
Fred then eyed everyone in the hall.
“…then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley wearily. Harry heard some chairs move, and scurried off down the stairs where he found the rat tonic. By the time he returned to the room, Percy had found his badge underneath all of Ron’s things. Harry handed Ron the tonic and went to bed.
“Yeah, Sea,” said Dean Thomas who bumped his shoulder into his best friends.
“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly. Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them beneath the graves.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Millicent laughed.
“Yeah,” said Hermione. “She doesn’t think much of Bagman.”
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” she said. “You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think
“You didn’t pass out though, did you?” said Harry in a low voice.
“Yep,” said Moody.
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.”
Harry woke up to someone tapping his cheek insistently with something cold and wet.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
Harry turns to look at him.
I don't own Harry Potter, I am just a fan. Unbeta'd. Thank you for reading.
“No, sir, I merely don’t wish to hear my mother’s screams anymore.”
Malfoy turned to Hermione.
When Draco opened the door, Harry was standing there waiting for him. Draco moved instantly into Harry’s open arms, and kissed the other man the way that he always imagined that he would. And Harry kissed him back like he would never get the opportunity to do so again.
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon, hope, happiness, the desire to survive, but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.”
“Hmmm,” she huffed, a small smile at her lips. Let her smirk, she didn’t have to know that Draco could recall every single time he had seen Potter less than clothed and cold give a more accurate depiction that even Luna could even if he wasn’t an artist. Some things you don’t forget, and a sweaty Harry Potter in Quidditch pants is one of them.
“Come on, Potter,” he said, dressing quickly. “There’s a lot I have to tell you.”
Neville looked at his arm like it still hurt. “I wasn’t really ready, but I told Madame Pomfrey that I felt well enough to leave. I needed to thank you.”
“Your posture is horrendous, Potter. Didn’t you attend those dance lessons? I’ll have to ask Goyle for the memories.”
“When they get near me I can hear Voldemort. I can hear him murdering my mum.”			Lupin reached out and squeezed Harry’s shoulder. He pulled back.
Harry thought. Yes, something was bothering him.
“Three turns,” she said. “That should get you there.”
“You know what I think of?”
Alone in the Manor, Draco would spend the night’s cleaning every surface that nosey aurors had traipsed through and every room Voldemort had ever set eyes on, without magic. But some nights, some days he would be unable to leave his bed. He was an outcast from society and separated from his family, and was dealing with his new status of traitor. Death Eater scum. He had to block the Floo and shore up the wards even after Potter had testified on behalf of he and his mother. Even among his fellow Slytherins who were still licking their own wounds, it was a case of turning up their noses and whispering about how the mighty had fallen.
“Look---“ he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.
Catching the look on Harry’s face Neville continued. “People only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you know enough
Harry went back to the library where Millicent, Blasie, and Hermione were testing Neville on his potions knowledge. Harry told them what he’d heard.
Snape glowered, eyeing Harry with all the hate he had the first time he had ever saw him that first year. Then left Harry to his perfected ingredients.
Harry was stunned.
“I want to talk about the other day,” said Harry. “About Herbology.”
“HARRY POTTER!”
“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow. “What did you want to attack us for?”
Harry looked at her incredulously. “What Potter? My family makes it their business to know powerful witches and wizards, and being an Animagus falls into that category.”
“I don’t know,” Millicent said innocently. “One moment he was trying to cast the levitation spell and the next his eyelid was trying to swell shut.”
“I assume you got Flint’s owl, Potter. Back on the team, congratulations.”
Harry couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and the position of his arms. The figure looked like he was carrying something. It looked like…a baby or maybe just a bundle of robes.
“Which means,” said Dumbledore. “That we need to change this back.” He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became silver and green once again and the serpent was back in its place behind the Head
“Millicent,” Harry sighed, just happy to see his friend again. He released a breath, Millicent putting him at ease the way few other people could.
Harry knew that was what Malfoy was egging for, to get Hagrid fired, he just didn’t know why. He wondered really if Malfoy even really knew why.
Hermione looked aghast, Professor Trewlaney looked vacant. Seamus Finnigan then got his hands on Harry’s cup, and decided that it looked part Grim and part donkey. Harry, tired of hearing everyone talk about him dying, when for the past two years that had been a very good possibility was in a sour mood when they got to their first Transfiguration class later that day.
“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Blaise seemed to be.
Kingsley nodded. “He’s taunting us. He knows that we almost had him last time, but managed to sneak away.”
Pansy stared at Harry in shock. She swallowed hard before nodding her head.
Really, thought Harry.
“I’m not too sure,” said Draco’s charge Harry thought was named Cora. “He does seem a bit intimidating.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How many does she need?” asked Millicent. “She already has enough to furnish my family’s mansion and hers.”
“Show me, Draco, please. Just fucking show me.” He pulled, grabbing ahold of Draco’s sweatpants. His shirt had rolled up during their scuffle. Realizing this, Draco reached to pull it back down, but as the waistband of his pants fell just a little lower he felt Harry’s frantic movements stop and heard him suck in a breath. Draco reached slowly to move his clothes back to where they belonged, but knowing it was too late. Draco scrambled to his feet, face hot, sweat down his back over the mark he had fought for two years to convince himself didn’t exist.
“Say how are you getting on with your golden egg?”
Through the door was a large room with another doorway at the end of it, but as soon as they emerged black flames sprung up keeping them out. They were trapped.
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.
Wand head tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open. On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.
Tiny, Dennis Creevey, Colin’s brother edged forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teacher’s table.
“I’ll try,” laughed Harry. “Maybe I’ll ask Trewlaney for suggestions.”
“I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight…but your mother needn’t have died….she was trying to protect you…Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain…..”
Silence filled the room so profound Harry was sure Ron in another classroom could hear just how quick he turned his head in Nott’s direction.
“Harry Potter should kill you if any of the things that they have been saying about him are true.”
“We’ll that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.
Harry could hear Blaise’s chortle from the opposite side of the room.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, before clearing his throat. “I mean, I wouldn’t know. Quidditch locker rooms were years ago.”
“What?” asked Ron.
Thank you all for reading and commenting.
“And what else do you know, Fred?”
The mentor program, Harry learned, was really quite easy. For the most part, mentors were tasked with looking after their respective first years. Were they doing okay in classes? Were they homesick? Did Snape need to be contacted for any reason? Most of the time, the mentor program was never revealed to the first year.
Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, slaving hanging from yellow fangs.
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“Did you see that?” Hermione asked, finally catching her breath and her temper.
While politics in Slytherin were clearly defined, Gryffindor was more of a free for all, and Harry didn’t envy them at all.
“But you are right, sir. Of course there are no werewolves near Hogwarts.”
And it felt then, like everything had set itself to rights. His clothes were dry. He had never fought to breathe. He had never struggled against unspeakable monsters. Because Draco was here, and he had protected him. And he knew that he would fight any and every monster for the man beside hi….
“A recent demonstration of the Killing Curse.”
Krum approached Harry then Blaise at his side.
“Fine,” he said, shortly then remembering that he was actually friendly with Harry said, “You?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley. “This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s and Harry, another friend.”
Harry nodded, matching Flint’s forlorn look at the Firebolt, knowing that as soon as it was in Snape’s hands he would never see it again.
“Are we meant to go in that?” asked Malfoy, sounding about as frayed as Tracey Davis looked.
Harry nodded once quickly, hoping that the twins were wrong.
Harry opened his eyes slightly, just enough to see Percy’s face rapt with attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry.
“Not so bumpy,” Harry filled in.
“Can we have another go? Just one more?”
“An old man came too,” Harry said, his throat still constricted. “Bertha Jorkins. And…..” He looked at Sirius and Remus.
Now, that wasn’t what he had expected at all.
“Oh my gosh! Potter!!”
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his relatives smiling happily. Harry sank down on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying all night if he wanted too. Nothing at all.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh,” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s apology aside. “I just though’ you two valued friendship more’n that.”
“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.
Harry nodded dumbly.
Then Harry turned and left the grieving parents in the hall. He had his own family to be getting back to.
“Besides, we’ve got no proof,” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know anything about how the troll got into the castle and they’ll believe him. He’s the Professor we’re the students,
Harry nodded.
They had missed the sorting, but thankfully, not the food. After another summer with the Dursleys, he would be grateful to be on whole, steady meals again.
“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you must’ve known Sirius Black as well.”
“Well, no,” said Draco, knowing he sounded ridiculous. “But compared to your other best friends, Hermione or Ron, or any of the other Weasleys, yeah.”
“He’s back in the country?” said Harry, an odd tinge to his voice.
“You need to go to Dumbledore,” said Blaise, suddenly their voice of reason. “That’s what you idiots should have done weeks ago.”
Harry wanted to close his eyes, but he wanted to see this.
“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. “Yes….thank you, Weatherby.”
“Absolutely not,” Harry replied. Favors in Slytherin were handed out with more care and consideration than most did their homework. Favors with no strings attached were unheard of.
“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.
As they left the Great Hall, someone bumped Harry’s shoulder, but instead of seeing a green robe it was a blue one.
“What happened?” Hermione asked him.
“My dad, too?” said Harry, astounded. “Three years and two of the cleverest students in school made it possible. Your dad and Sirius helped Peter to transform and in fifth year they all could change form at will. They couldn’t keep me company as humans, but they could as animals.
Draco braced himself and opened the door begrudgingly. And before Draco could turn her away, Hermione shoved his goddaughter in his arms. The little bundle and only red head he could stand cooed and reached for him.
He found Hermione, Ron, and Neville in Zonkos, and Millicent and Blaise in the Stationary shop. He had to side step Crabbe, Goyle, and Malfoy to get to them, but it was worth it. He sidestepped Crabbe, causing him to bump into Malfoy who dumped a whole vial of ink down his front. Harry followed it with the quick dry charm that he uses on his homework then fought to stifle his laughter as Malfoy was told he would have to pay for the solid gold vial of ink, not that he couldn’t afford it.
“You’re going to the Yule Ball with me, I will be by your rooms later tonight to make sure that your dress robes are suitable. If they are not you will wear what I pick out and you will not complain. You will meet me for extensive dancing lessons until I can say with all certainty that you will not embarrass me.”
“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage. “I’m…I’m not wearing anything.”
Harry nodded, understanding now. “The three and only loves of my life. And when I say, Mr. Potter, that I would do anything to keep them happy and safe and whole, I mean anything. Blaise told me about what transpired after the events of last year.”
“You let me go. I told you I was going to get it….”
“I am also burned off the map,” continued Sirius. “You know what would be a good idea?” said Sirius. “We’ll add you to the map, and then have a celebratory burning of your effigy. It would almost be like a coming of age thing.”
“Yes,” said Harry. “But why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just….”
“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.
Flint nodded at him, before exiting.
Yawning, Harry ignored the elegant looking black boy, intent on trying to pay attention to where they were going.
“When! When I was almost murdered first year, when the basilisk attacked me second year, when the dementors….”
So, he rose his wand.
Harry kept his eyes closed, hearing the curiosity in Mrs. Wealsey’s voice as she and Bill Weasley listened to the conversation that was quickly turning into an argument right outside the hospital’s doors.
“Everything under control, sir.”
Tumblr: inkdrinkershadowsinger
“Ah,” Harry started to explain then. “Wait, how did you know I was staying at the Leaky?”
“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on—I’ll see what Professor Snape has to say about you.”
Sirius says hello. He is currently out at the shops. The ministry has allowed him that much leave to stray from our residence. We are working on attaining license for a visit to see you very soon. Having a Hogwarts champion for the school looks quite good on the Ministry and a happy one looks even better. I did quite enjoy what you said about SPEW at the first task, that was wonderfully put. Should I think Ms. Granger or Ms. Bulstrode for the lovely outfit you were photographed as wearing? All joking aside, I am glad that you are well. Sirius has been in a tizzy, and I confess that I am not that much better. But using what skills you have and what tools are available is a wonderful lesson for dealing with the Dark Arts and I’m glad that you remembered that. You always were one of the best DADA students. Please also tell Ms. Granger that I still have her last essay with extended notes and commentary if she would like me to owl it to you for her. She has been quite insistent on its status.
“To do her a favor,” Pansy said, finally taking her place by Malfoy’s side. She looked the same as ever though perhaps there was something different about her nose? More uppity? Harry wondered. Or perhaps it was just the way she was staring down at Millicent that made her look so pugish.
“I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.”
Harry watched as a rather flustered looking Pansy sat down beside Tracey Davis, and instantly began sorting through several books and pieces of parchment.
Harry screwed up all his courage.
But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
“Together!” Harry heard Millicent shout. And as one Harry heard Millicent Bulstrode and Hermione Granger shout at the top of their lungs: “Wingardium Leviosa!”
“What’s that supposed to be?”
“Yes,” said Remus, smiling. “For the entire summer.”
“Won it,” said Hagird. “ in a card game, the fellow didn’t seem to put out though. He acted like he wanted to get rid of it.”
Instead, Draco thought about fucking some random dark haired man fast and rough until he came all over the bathroom walls. He cried silently for all the “soft” moments then put back on the face of comrade and friend.
“You don’t understand, Professor,” called Draco Malfoy. “Harry Potter’s coming—he’s got a dragon!”
“Ah, don’t worry, Gin,” Charlie said. “I might be seeing you sooner than you think.”
Harry clapped along with the rest though when “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin he had to move over to make space for him at the table. In a moment, Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
He looked at Remus and the two had a quick unspoken conversation before Remus spoke, “So, what’s your plan?”
“Macnair,” Harry continued.
Dumbledore looked at Harry then.
I'm not sure if I still believe in the concept of soulmates as I once did, but I still bear a mark of my belief. I can only hope that another bears the same.
“Love is like that, isn’t it? All consuming, enthralling, and filling every atom.”
Draco scoffed internally. Why did megalomaniacal pricks like him always talk about a new world order? He was selling illegal creature parts not ancient Merlin artifacts.
Bagman frowned.
Once every one had joined them, Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione and Millicent, and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
His hand stopping millimeters away from ending their argument. Draco had heard plenty of talk about Harry’s soulmate. When he was feeling particularly rueful all he wanted to talk about was how wonderful they were going to be and all the things he had planned for the two of them in the future. Draco had to listen to Harry talk about how lovely he was going to be, how kind and gorgeous, and how he better like Quidditch as much as he did all while Draco was sitting right beside him, but never this.
Dragons.
“You’re due in court in ten minutes, and you have grape jam on your face,” Kingsley said. Harry nodded briefly, wiping away the jelly quickly, Shacklebolt
Harry also had to bite his tongue at Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon agreeing to take him back next summer as long as he stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter.
Also, this will be uploaded within two weeks of the last posting, which is now. I promise. All the love.
“They are going to drive aren’t they?” he had asked when a knock sounded at the front door.
Sure, there have been those who had professed that their marks matched, and Harry had even gotten close to a few of them before they were ultimately outed as liars and scam artists. He had wanted to believe it so many times only to have it all taken away.
“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?”
“What do you think of?”
“Oh,” said Draco in mock surprise. “Have you solved it already, Vince? If that’s the case, you should have said and then we all would leave.”
Pansy snorted, clearly unimpressed with Harry’s ignorance.
“Mate,” Ron said in complete shock. “That was wicked. The way that dragon just nudged you the egg. We all had no idea what you were saying of course, but…. Wow! I’m glad that I told you about the dragons in advance.”
“Arthur,” called Mrs. Weasley. “Time to go.”
Madam Pomfrey was not impressed with his desire to leave the hospital wing, but he assured her that he was well enough. Harry was just slipping on his outer robe when the doors of the hospital wing opened.
“I just hope I don’t mess it up,” he said, cheeks blooming.
“Ha, ha,” said Ron. Draco had once again found himself at The Weasley’s ancestral home, otherwise known as the Burrow, this time for George and Angelina’s engagement party. Draco wondered briefly to whom Molly Weasley had sold her soul to have had so many of her children find their marks at such an early age. Ron and Hermione. George and Angelina. The Weaslette and Blaise of all people. Even Percy Weasley had been hopping around Neville Longbottom as of late. Bill had Fleur and several amazingly gorgeous children. Draco was even sure the dragon tamer had a mark mate. Why else would one move to Romania?
He had to tell someone. He was almost to the dungeons when he ran into Hermione, she seemed to be waiting for him.
“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. Snape rattled off the correct answers, Hermione the only one writing down his every word until Snape snapped at the rest of the class to do the same.
“Yes, I am Malfoy. So, I’d take Potters advice and pick on someone else.”
“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are you?”
“Now, if you’ll wait a minute Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
“Voldemort’s……”
Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t stupid, but he also knew he wasn’t going to keep this to himself. Malfoy was going to tell, he was just going to tell someone who had more authority to get Hagrid in trouble.
“He gives me the creeps, always has, ever since I was a child. The thing always did prefer my brother. Like everyone else in my family.”
The man paced back in forth in front of Harry’s workstation, glowering down at him like he had committed some kind of heinous crime. Nothing Harry did was right. His slicing was subpar. His dicing was disastrous. And his stirring was the “strongest indication yet that you are an incompetent buffoon and unworthy of the house of Slytherin”.
“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train back home tomorrow, you’re so—“
Blaise laughed. “She has enough of them, but that one suited your eyes.”
“Do you want to ride the train Harry or would you like for us to apparate you all the way?”
“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly. “Dobby doesn’t care what they think anymore!”
Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw Harry that morning, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Harry smirked at him leaving the room with a, “Scared, Malfoy?” before heading to the Great Hall for breakfast.
“It’s not that easy,” said Lupin, then noticing Harry’s expression. “I think it’s better if we leave this conversation here, some things you’re still not quite old enough to understand.”
“The whole what?” Harry asked. “What are you talking about?”
“Well, I’m going,” Millie said instantly. “and it would make sense for Granger to go, because Blaise and Neville don’t really know Hagrid.”
“On my whistle, Harry and Cassius!” said Bagman. “3,2,1…” After a short blast of the whistle, Harry and Warrington ran into the maze. Harry’s chosen path seemed completely deserted, Warrington having split off at a fork some way back.
Goyle eyed him wearily, and Harry reminded himself that it beneath Goyle’s large exterior that he was really a softie.
“They are a bunch of snotty nosed brats.”
His head of house had tried to kill him.
Viktor momentarily looked as if he thought Dumbledore was going to say something to him, but Dumbledore had forgiven worse crimes then going to a school that supposedly teaches the Dark Arts. Snape had been a Death Eater and somehow he had wormed his way into Dumbledore’s good graces again.
“Sorry, I forgot how rubbish you were at healing cha….”
“Of course, I trust him.”
“Cassius Warrington was a good person and a great friend. He was steadfast and strong, gifted in astronomy and like the stars he had memorized, he was headed for a bright future. His death has affected you all whether you knew him or not. I think that you have the right therefore to know exactly how it came about.
“Potter, Malfoy, stay behind please.”
“Professor Snape seems to be very interested in the Dark Arts. Have you ever seen his office?” Harry asked, but as Professor Lupin kept sipping his drink, he assumed that it was probably too late for the man anyway.
But what, Harry wondered, would that be for Snape?
“You were brave enough to head out with me to that duel,” said Harry.
“It’s here,” Draco said, when he finally braced Harry’s hand on his back, dangerously close to the Mark. Draco took a deep, hopefully silent breath and shook his head. Harry couldn’t see him, but the Mark magic was working now, so wordlessly Harry began casting the healing charms on Draco’s skin. Harry’s hand moved over Draco’s back trying to calm him and help the magic connect and heal quicker. His hand massaged into Draco’s back, his shoulder lulling Draco into an almost hypnotic stupor.
Ron looked like he had been abruptly woken from a vivid dream while Fred like Harry, merely looked a little dazed. Malfoy further down the aisle looked as if he hadn’t been affected at all. Harry wondered at that before he saw Draco remove something from his ears.
“Of course not, everyone knows that those are just rumors.” Draco turned to Ron, and raised his wand.
Uncle Vernon stiffened as Aunt Petunia and Dudley cowered behind him.
Pansy and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin and Millicent then the others. Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon…..
“Dean?” he asked as the boy helped him to his feet.
The two boys laughed as they made their way out of the common room and to Snape’s class.
“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.
“Wealsey! Hey, Weasley!”
His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him unrecognizable?
“Yes,” said Ron, “but it’s like a status symbol isn’t it among purebloods?”
Draco hoped Harry wouldn’t feel him stiffen.
Harry berated himself for not asking Myrtle sooner.
Turns out by the time Defense came around the rain had dulled to a steady drizzle. Tracey Davis had her hood pulled up over her hair and bunched together toward her miserable looking face.
The Irish fellow stared at Dean like he had personally AK’d his mother or tried to Crucio his cat, but all Dean was doing was having the time of his life, or at least that’s what it looked like to Harry.
The man came out at once.
“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky’s unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house elf…. I mean to say….”
He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. Then he entered the enclosure.
“I assure you Kararoff that you have nothing to worry about. Dumbledore has everything under control.”
Blaise turned that way inconspicuously. He had his eyes on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly.
“Yes,” Lupin said, looking at Harry, not even trying to deny it. Lupin made a move to step toward Ron, but stiffened when he saw how Ron flinched from him. “I am what she says I am. I am a werewolf. I got the bite when I was just a child. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. As long as I take it the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. A harmless werewolf. However, back then there was nothing to control me. But then Dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic. He said if we take precautions that there was no reason why I couldn’t come to school.
“What happened to you?” Harry asked. Then remembering Ron’s letter from the summer stating that Millicent had become quite the staple at the Burrow as she helped the twins with their various products he thought he could guess.
“No, Potter,”
He opened and hoped probably in vain to see a picture of himself in its pages.
“I didn’t need too,” Harry cut in before the diatribe could begin in earnest. “Because I changed it,” he said. “I changed it to you.”
“Excellent,” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure that I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real….”
Harry was there, so that meant that Draco was too. Harry would invite the still grieving couple around to his messy home and insist that Draco stay. Draco would automatically pull Hermione into a conversation about her newest bill, one of the only things that she was passionate about anymore and Ron and Harry would take turns going through and disarming old House of Black items that Harry hadn’t bothered to go through. If they found a particularly nasty one all four of them would work on it together until the curse was broken, sometimes they worked on it all night, until finally an exhausted and frustrated Hermione would cuddle up with her husband and the pair would finally get some sleep.
The music shifted.
“Yes, I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time…furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.”
“I’ll be moving to Chaser, Flint says I’ve got the speed for it,” said Malfoy. Harry simply nodded, knowing Malfoy couldn’t be that pleased at having to change positions. Crabbe looked like he wanted to say something else, but then Professor Lupin snorted loudly.
Harry scoffed.
“In case it wasn’t clear when I burned your mark off my body, or changed jobs then let me make it cleared, I want nothing to do with you. You didn’t want me and now I don’t want you.”
proof.”
“It’s okay,” Professor Lupin said. “You don’t have to worry about the essay, but,” he said looking at Malfoy. “If you have already done it, I will count it to you as extra credit.”
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile.
“But Professor Dumbledore said we could call him….” Dobby stopped, appearing nervous. “He said we is free to call him….a barmy old codger if we likes sir! But Dobby is not wanting to Harry Potter, sir. Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.”
“Come on, Granger, you’re a witch aren’t you?” Millicent shouted.
Then a rustling in the woods drew their attention, and Winky the house elf made her way into their field of vision.
“Ready?” she called, her face pale but determined. “Now, don’t hang around after you’ve won.”
Malfoy tried to lower his hand, no doubt going to say something about the curriculum, but Moody either not noticing or not caring about his discomfort kept staring at him with his mad eye.
staying at Hogwarts?”
“Then why don’t they just change it?”
Dobby looked confused between Hermione and her righteous anger and Blaise and his rather impressive impression of a kicked puppy.
“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.
“I just want to see his leg, see what happened.”
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “—how dare you---might have broken your neck.—“
Wood looked at Ron like Flint had somehow just announced that Wood was about to give Flint top secret Quidditch secrets, but then he said, “It’s just to gather intel, Flint, you do remember that right?”
“We can explain afterwards,” snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. Scabbers was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to escape Black’s reaching hand.
“It’s just a fact, you get away with far more than any of the rest of us. You waltz in here five minutes late for the meeting this morning, and instead of scolding you Shacklebolt offered you a tart.”
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming.
“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape, cut up these roots.”
“Your slave wages?” asked Blaise, though he was fascinated by the fifty pence.
“Course, my Lord, of course, you are merciful, thank you….”
“Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. “I was just thinking of making one.”
Harry smirked.
“That was me doing my duty by the Hogwart’s champion,” Malfoy answered.
“I wasn’t beating him, Bulstrode,” said Ron insistently.
He had his Firebolt in his hand ready to mount again, but dropped it when the dragon made a swipe at him.
He certainly didn't want to be there when his whole face was swollen shut, and Snape was the only one who could fix him.
He approached cautiously, moving steadily toward the rumpled heap that was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. Malfoy’s blonde hair barely stuck out from the cloak as he screamed and kicked against the fabric of the enlarged cloak they had been under.
“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s disgusting the way…”
They didn’t reply.
“I’m getting it burned off,” Draco declared. “in the morning if I can, as soon as possible so you don’t have to worry.”
“I am perfectly fine, Potter,” she said, loud and clear enough for everyone who was paying attention to hear what she said. It was then that Harry realized that the letters waiting for Millicent were not ordinary letters, but howlers.
“You see, Potter,” said Draco standing. “I’m very intrinsically motivated. Hagrid is a stain on this school, worse than the mudbloods. Half breeds are abominations.”
“Wait, what?” Pansy said as Harry took off toward Hagrid’s. Pansy following him.
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me…things I want to know the truth about…..”
Harry allowed his sore muscles to soak in the water. He had played pick up games with Sirius and Remus this summer, and while Remus was the more athletic of the two he was the most content with a book in front of a warm fire. Sirius was more likely to want to play a game, but his coordination was a little less than ideal. His eye sight even worse. Nine times out of ten, Harry would catch sight of the snitch before Sirius could get two feet off the ground.
“No, not like them. The Potters were a great family, purebloods and wealthy. We would have been friends in another life.”
“….makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying. “Harry’s got a right to know. I’ve tried to tell Fudge, but be insists on treating Harry like a child. He’s thirteen years old….”
The air was suddenly full of swishing cloaks. Every wizard hooded and masked. One of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes, “Master….Master….” he murmured. The Death Eater behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on their knees and kissing his robes, before backing away, and standing up, forming a silent circle, which encircled Harry and his headstone. Harry tried to catch Warrington’s attention but the boy wasn’t looking anywhere near him.
“We’re not playing the first game,” said Flint.
I asked if I would still be able to see her for Christmas and my parents told me, of course I would.”
As they started to walk back Harry noticed the scarf wrapped around Krum’s neck. “That’s funny, my friend Blaise has one just like that.”
Everyone in the crowd watched as Harry moved ever closer to the dragon.
“Oh, Bulstrode, you even have Fred and George beat on this one,” said Ron.
“If that was your tryout, Potter, I’d have to say you should have tried it on someone else, the Captain perhaps? Anyone but McGonagall. You’re lucky she didn’t dock any points for your and Malfoy’s little stunt.
There was a mad glint in Snape’s eye that Harry had never seen before.
“He’s an auror, and not a horrible one,” a voice said from the corner. Harry hadn’t noticed the man before, but there he was shrouded by shadows. The man stepped out, his magical eye, one leg, and general gruffness all on display.
Harry tries to laugh it off, but the nightmare won’t leave him.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
Children don’t want things like that, they want things like these….”
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing. He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his parent’s best friend…..He felt dazed…What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the criminal they’d seen on television?
Pettigrew was found hours later in a trash can outside of Wolverhampton, England. The aurors had taken him captive and then delivered him to Dumbledore. And there in the presence of the Minister for Magic, Dumbledore, Professors Snape and McGonagall, Harry, Millicent and Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew was forced to confess under veristserum what he had done not only to Harry’s parents but also to Sirius Black.
Millicent rolled her eyes, and George, wisely, changed the subject.
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
“Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta.
“Really, Potter?” Millicent asked. “Have you picked up any book since you’ve been here that wasn’t a Quidditch magazine?”
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocked the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them Hagrid was behind it.
For a while he could almost feel himself slipping into old habits. He could feel those thoughts start to wiggle their way into his brain again. After Sirius’ death, it had felt as if the whole world had swept down on him. He was at the bottom of a tornado, and the wind was relentless as it pushed him into the Earth. The fact was that Harry had never been wanted by the Dursleys. They had never cared for him the way that they should have. He had gone through some pretty serious formative years sheltering under the belief that he was unlovable. That he was unwanted. It was why he had balked at the idea of having a soul mate for so long. Because if some poor sod was stuck with him for eternity, and even they couldn’t care about him, then what did that say about himself.
And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the blissful clean slate of an imperioused mind.
Blaise who was completely unperturbed lay on Harry’s bed, his hands propped under his neck, looking for the whole world like he hadn’t just tried to feel Harry up.
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. Roasting marshmellows, and plotting ways to get Malfoy expelled from school took up the majority of their time.
“Yeah,” said Goyle defending him. “It’s why he always beheads them before he does anything else if they’re used in Potions.”
The sound of an angry Bludger zooming close to him and Seamus Finnigan in front of it, trying to outrun it. The boy, unable to fly anywhere else, came barreling towards him. Harry caught only the boy’s freckled face as he flew nose to nose over Harry then into one of the canopy’s supports followed by the Bludger. Harry didn’t know which made the sickening crunch that filled his ear, Seamus or the breaking beam, but Harry knew his stomach would never be the same again. He wrenched himself free of the nail in just enough time for the beam to have its final say before it fell right on top of him. Harry landed in between the bleachers, but he was trapped.
“What?” Draco asked. Then clarified. “What do I think of when?”
Someone was slapping his face.
“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry. He had never meant anything more. “Wait, what about Professor Lupin?” said Harry. “Will he be living with us too? He will right?” Harry knew that the two were good friends, and Harry was sure that wherever Lupin lived that it wasn’t great. Harry thought it would be nice for the two friends to be together again anyway.
“This isn’t safe—she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on,” said Blaise, pulling Harry out of the room.
“How are you here?” he asked.
Ginny and Millicent were through next. Then Percy and Ron.
“Exactly,” said Kingsley.
Ely put his hands on Harry’s shoulders.
“All Slytherin I’m afraid.”
Harry noticed Neville receiving a package, but it wasn’t until they were leaving the Great Hall that he heard about what it was.
“THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT….THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT’S AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER BEFORE. TONIGHT….BEFORE MIDNIGHT….THE SERVANT…WILL SET OUT….TO REJOIN….HIS MASTER…..”
“Hermione better do that,” said Millicent.
“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all right. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the Kiss any moment now….”
“Fine,” said Harry, shaking his head. He opened the door, and Hermione poised herself at the edge.
“Let’s do this smart,” said Harry. “We can open the door from here. Hermione you go first, then I’ll take the flute from Millicent so she can go.”
“He will be back. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; which shows just how little mercy he has for his followers or
The next morning he got a letter from Sirius. He hadn’t wanted to write to him, but after Hermione had heard about the pain in his scar, she notified him that if he didn’t write to Sirius that she would. And instead of Remus and Sirius getting some clinical depiction of what he had told her happened on the pitch Harry had explained, but backed it up saying that it was probably just a freak accident or something like that.
They strode toward the wall and in a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine steadily puffing smoke.
“What’s this?”
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give.
“But,” said Marcus. “I wouldn’t go looking him in the eye. That’s how they brainwash you.”
Hermione found her way over to them. “You wouldn’t believe what idiotic things people are saying, like Black could get in here with a disguise and he surely couldn’t have apparated. No one apparates in or out of Hogwarts.”
“Right,” said Draco. “But Potter, do you know what kind of creatures live in the Black Lake? Do you know what haunts those waters? What the flicker of shadow is that blocks the light for only moments in the dorm?”
Sirius froze.
“Well, well, well,” he whispered. “we are in trouble.”
Harry prepared to duck, since he was sitting close to Crabbe, but no pillow came flying their way. He watched as an odd look flittered over Pansy’s face before she quickly changed the subject.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind he black chessman, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them were the white pieces.
“How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?” Harry wondered aloud.
The leader walked closer to Draco, his wand still in the man’s grip.
“See you there?” asked Harry, ignoring the glares of his housemates who were eyeing him skeptically.
That evening, Snape stopped by the common room, gathering everyone. He had to make an announcement. It was rare that Snape was seen in the Common Room. If someone needed him or if they were in trouble, it was always encouraged for them to go by his office during office hours, only. Snape didn’t like to be disturbed, unless you had a very good reason. And what a good reason was to Severus Snape constituted blood or death, nothing less.
Draco’s head whipped in his direction, and Harry had to fight the urge to rush to him.
“Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed…”
“Where?”
Hermione rounded on him.
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy his thoughts. The Quiddditch season was approaching and Marcus Flint was in full Captain mode. He scheduled practice after practice and they were now headed to the Quidditch pitch for another one.
Still, his head hit the grassy pitch with a smack. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, but it did make his scar stop hurting.
“Hello, Draco,”
“And what exactly could Professor Lupin help you with? The man is not an expert in much, surely you didn’t go to him with my classes’ homework?”
And Jo Ro, if you've happen to come across this story, please message me....because I have an idea.
“Yes, him---Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?”
Maybe Pansy had drugged him and this was all a hallucination.
Harry nodded.
Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory placed his wand against the tip of Harrys.
“Of course,” said Sirius and Remus at nearly the same time.
“A favor to be named later,”
He sent up emergency sparks, but doubted anyone could see them in the smoke and flame. He had to get out of there or he was going to be buried under the collapsing ceiling.
“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at Malfoy.
“This is money?” he asked.
They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey, but Harry did notice the lingering looks Ron and Millicent kept sending him.
Hermione raised herself up to full height.
One second it was an indecisive whirl then it was…a house elf?
“Why did you do it?” Harry asked. “Why did you throw the last match?”
The group stopped off at a magical creature shop to see if anything could be done for Scabbers and so Hermione could look for an owl that she had been wanting. As Hermione headed to the back of the shop off in search of a sale’s assistant, Harry went with Ron to the counter.
Millicent gave Ginny Weasley a panicked once over before joining in beside her, Fred had one of Ginny’s hands and Millicent the other as George held his wand out, cast Lumos, and started to lead them back to the hill.
“We’ll just have to—“ Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
“Divination, Granger, you?” said Millicent.
“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” Uncle Vernon had said. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.”
Harry ripped the parcel open and gaped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Blaise dropped his package and jumped off his bed for a closer look.
Harry had gotten the point plainly enough. But as much as he would have liked to physically be there for his friend, there was no way that even Lockhart level memory charms would be enough to make the Dursleys forget their personal life mission of torturing Harry at every possible moment.
“No,” muttered Hermione. “It’s her.” Harry and the group followed Hermione’s line of sight to one Fleur Delacour.
In a moment, the dark shape seemed to multiply outward and the weather took notice. Lightening started to strike and Madam Hooch was trying to ground everyone, but the players too desperately absorbed in the game hardly seemed to notice.
Millicent laughed.
Out in the hall, Millicent said, “That was odd.”
Millicent looked decidedly unimpressed.
Marcus, too, seemed pleased when Gryffindor got a point, though Harry was sure no one could tell but him. He was sitting so close to the seventh year and his Captain that he could see the slight upturn of his mouth when Wood managed to block a goal.
“He’s the dog….he’s an Animagus.”
THE FIREBOLT
The defense classroom changed and shifted with the style of the professor. Lockhart had preferred portraits of himself painting portraits of himself and more mirrors than Harry thought proper to own. Remus had preferred books, and the creatures themselves to study and understand. Even Crouch Jr. had a very fine aesthetic going with his various utensils of death and dismemberment.
And with a sounding, “Riddikulus!” Professor Lupin put the boggart back into the wardrobe.
Harry stared at the door. “Harry,” said Hermione, tugging on his arm. “Look at the birds,”
And what on Earth could Hermione have up her sleeve?
“Draco, Mate,” the man was crying for real now.
“You wish,” Harry said, running toward the champion’s tent before Draco could pull him into a dance. Harry could hear the sound of the other boy’s laughter even after he went inside.
“Now, Greg, are you ready? Remember, Riddikulus!” Goyle nodded. His wand shaking slightly with nerves.
“So you found someone to consort with even lower than the Weasleys did you, Potter?” drawled the voice that haunts Harry’s dreams.
Next part will be the Yule Ball....can'd wait for the dis...I mean the dance.
Blaise turned and looked at him.
Still, the night wasn’t a total loss. When he was finally able to sneak away from Pansy on one of her “breaks” he had run into one Marcus Flint, chaperone extraordinaire.
Millicent led the game, and they slowly began to move across the board. Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a buddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Millicent
The hat was placed on his head, and the announcement was made:
“Yeah,” said Harry. “but I’m learning. And every new thing I’ve learned makes me feel sicker than the thing before.” Then he turned his back on his house mates and started to walk away. He stopped when he heard Marcus Flint’s voice.
Classes Begin
“That doesn’t mean that you don’t love him.” Please mean that you love me, Harry prayed. Harry watched as tears came to his mate’s eyes that little Rose reached up and wiped away.
“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly. “but I thought a good sharp shock…”
“And how do you defeat a Kappa? Ms. Davis?” he asked Tracey, but seeing as how Tracey had been charming her nails different colors all last class instead of listening, she merely shook her head.
“Should I be offended?”
“Ely,” Harry said, breaking Voldemort’s rant. “Remember him, Cassius, Ely. He’s your boyfriend. You love him and he loves you. You’re going to get out of here, and make your own life remem….”
Snape looked at her, but Millicent stood even straighter.
Harry nodded, took a breath and then dived under the water.
“An old piece of Dark Magic has revived me tonight, three ingredients. Flesh of a servant and my father’s bone were easily at hand. But the blood of a foe? Any wizard who hated me would have been enough, but I wanted to rise to former glory more powerful than when I had fallen. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago…Harry Potter……for then the lingering protection his mother gave him would then reside in my veins too. My faithful Death Eater entered the boy’s name into the Goblet of Fire, ensured he won the tournament, and touched the Cup first. The Portkey activated and brought him beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and protection, and into my waiting arms, and here is the boy you all believed had been my downfall…”
After the excitement from the Gryffindor/Ravenclaw game when Snape burst into the room no one immediately took notice, but when he ordered everyone to the Great Hall they knew that something had happened.
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
Harry and asked Millicent to see if perhaps they should say something to Hermione, but Millicent had just said, “Granger is a big girl let her handle this. Besides,” she laughed, “it's absolutely hilarious”.
Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. If living with Malfoy had taught him one thing it was that Malfoy’s act was about eighty-five percent hot air.
Pansy nodded.
“Millicent, no!” Harry heard Hermione yell.
This is it, Draco thought. He has finally gone insane because there was no way Harry would ever have said that to him.
After thanking Bagman for his blatant offer to cheat, Harry met Hermione were she had been gathering signatures.
“I hope he’s up to it, since you Gryffindors were mainly responsible for driving away the last one.”
“Creevey, Dennis!”
“What d’you mean?” said Ron.
Millicent eyed him as he licked his lips, nearly salivating at the thought, but didn’t say anything.
Yet, Harry couldn’t get his dream out of his mind. Voldemort hadn’t been alone there, he had been talking to someone….plotting Harry’s death.
Turning to Harry, “And thanks for the bracelet, Potter. I was surprised to see you had that much taste. Sorry I didn’t get you anything.”
“Exactly, Master Flint, we cannot and will not underestimate the Gyrffindors. They are a tough team, and Wood is a dedicated player who, though he would never admit it, would do darn near anything to win. The scouts are also here for him, and you never know, they might be watching a few of you others, so if you care anything about the fame and fortune of being a professional Quidditch star then you won’t play like you have your head shoved up your own arse.”
So, when Millicent got up and headed out the doors of the Great Hall, Harry noticed. Harry was about to stand to follow her out when Professor Quirrel came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
“Don’t worry about Pansy, she’s just trying to get Draco’s attention,” said Millicent.
“But we’ll be smart,” added Millicent. “There will be no barging around and knocking things over like the Gryffindors do, you heard what McGonagall said as well as we did. Black is smart, one of the cleverest boys in their year, and that means that we have to use all the cunning we can to catch him.”
Harry stood from the table, he had had enough.
Harry thought he’d be free after the first couple of dances, assuming Pansy would abandon him for greener pastures, but she had stuck to him like glue. “You are the hot commodity, Potter,” she had said. “So, don’t think I’ll be letting you go to dance with other girls.”
Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but---
Pansy steeled herself. Her shaky voice calming.
We are being taught an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history wizarding or Muggle will show how impermanent both the choices and prejudices must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought already laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. And those of us who are more robust,” she eyed Zabini like Pansy eyes third years in last seasons’ robes.
Unbeta'd all mistakes are mine.
“Three..” Goyle raised his wand. “Four…” He started to move it. “Five…,” Harry said, and then cast the incantation at the same time Goyle cast the shield spell. Harry’s spell bounced brilliantly off of Greg’s plant, and Goyle beamed up at him.
“How are we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?” asked George as they all dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding at dinner that evening.
“I just want to be able to have the same with him, you know?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, Not Slytherin.
Draco couldn’t take him. Harry spent more time in the gym than Draco ever has so physically kicking him out wasn’t an option, but he could leave him there.
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join me… or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging for mercy….”
“It’s all right, Mil. Malfoy was the one who found me.”
The man shook his head.
“How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” he whispered. “And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?”
“I went looking for the troll because I—I thought I could deal with it on my own—you know, because I’ve read all about them.”
Harry reached up to wipe at his eyes, and he could have sworn that he saw Draco’s hand twitched in response.
“Oh no you do…”
But it was too late. Snape saw me at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was…”
“The Champions, and you are one, Potter, and their date start the ball with a dance. It’s traditional.”
“Here,” said Hermione, getting out of her bed. Ron and Millicent lay asleep in others across the room. She pulled her necklace off and handed it to Harry.
A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harrys….they met in mid-air…and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating. He clutched at it with two hands, where in the middle neither the red or green lights were wining, but a golden light was being born between the two wands.
“Seems like you have some experience in that area, huh, Zabini,” said Millicent, like she knew more than the rest of them.
doubt loads of people just walk around with eggs in their pockets. Why didn’t I see it before? We have to go.”
“Sorry,” the guy said shortly.
Snape froze. Harry stared dumbstruck at the message. But the map didn’t stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.
Harry nodded, his swollen nose blocking his vision so that he couldn’t see if Flint agreed or not.
“Have a nice summer, Harry.”
“I don’t want him to be miserable, I just want him to be on guard!” returned Mr. Weasley. “You know what Harry and the boys are like. After everything the last two years. But Harry can’t do things like that this year. When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked him up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.”
Harry laughed.
Harry stopped walking.
Harry was announced as being the first to complete the task as he dragged Malfoy to the platform.  A towel was tossed over his shoulders as an eager and lost looking Crabbe and Goyle told Draco about the clue.
“He…doe..hurt…..”
If you want to read something amazing. I would suggest starting with "The Child of Azkaban" by LonelyHarvest. I was literally blown away by this one, and the imagery this person conjured lives rent free in my head.
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes. This was it. He was going to do it. He was going to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance…..then Hermione was shouting.
that he wasn’t excited. Let Snape try and pull something. Harry would be ready.
Millicent smirked, "You've learned well.”
I do not own the Chosen One, and this is unbeta'd.
Millicent looked the same as she had last year, but her cheeks and neck seemed flushed and red.
Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope….no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew beyond fear or reason, that he was not going to die crouching here in a faux game of hide and seek with Voldemort. He was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet…he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself like his mother had fought so valiantly to defend him.
There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said, “Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Roberts’ before they hit the ground, though. They’re having their memories modified right now.”
“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,
“Ms. Parkinson?”
“Aw,” said Dumbledore as the odd looking man, clunked his way into the Great Hall. “May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher? Everyone, Professor Moody.”
“So, Black was the Potter’s secret keeper?” said Madam Rosmerta.
It was Ron and Hermione, sitting outside Florean Fortesue’s Ice Cream Parlor. Ron, too, looked like he had to stop by Madam Malkin’s shop. Harry didn’t think it was possible, but Ron was even taller than he was last year.
“That’s not true,” said Harry immediately. “Blaise is more loyal than you think.”
“Oi,” Harry says, passing one of the drinks to Draco.
Warrington stood there for a beat, but it was long enough. Harry found his wand and cast a lightening fast Stupefy towards Warrington who had made the mistake of many before him in underestimating Harry. The boy stunned and still as stone began to fall towards the cup. Harry got to his feet, and ran. He was only feet away, but somehow Warrington was already coming out of the stupefy like he hadn’t really been stunned at all. Shaking himself out of the curse as fast as Harry could now throw off the imperious curse.
“Okay, but I get first dibs on the shower. I may book better than you, but somehow your sheer stubbornness keeps you from stinking as much as me.”
“No,” said Seamus too quickly. “Not nervous at all. It’s just Wood is very, very keen on winning today, and Ron and that darn cat have kept me up all night. Around four a.m. I was willing to sacrifice the rat myself, but Ron kept having to get up to block the door which meant we all had to keep getting up.”
As always, I appreciate your comments and kudos. You can get in touch with me here, on my Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger
“I told Granger here where you left it, and she just bounded off to get it, just like that.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “Sorry, that you have to be here. That you have to do this, but it can be over….”
Ron nodded though he was sure Millicent had meant herself.
Harry smiled. He couldn’t believe it.
“Really?” asked Blaise feigning nonchalance. “Or am I not now standing in a room with three Weasleys, a werewolf, and an ex-convict who just so happens to be related to the person who is vying for custody of Harry? Not to mention that Harry’s credibility has not exactly been at the highest after the events of the tournament.”
Draco entered the meeting purposefully late. Harry was always early, and seats at the table usually filled up quickly which meant that Draco could get a spot along the back of the wall, hopefully out of Harry’s eye line. He entered right as Shacklebolt was standing.
Fred merely rolled his eyes, like the two had talked about this before.
“But didn’t any of you fall off your seats?” said Harry awkwardly.
Blaise was up when they came back.
“Fleur,” Harry finished. “Looks like she got a piece though,” said Warrington looking at a large burn on Krum’s face. “Not so pretty anymore.”
“Laughed,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed. An when reinforcements from the Ministry got here, ‘e went wiv ‘em as anything still laughing ‘is ‘ead off. Cos’ ‘e’s mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad?”
“Yeah, no worries, I love what I did get though,” Harry assured her pointedly.
Pansy reached into her bag, and pulled out some parchment and a quill.
But when they reached the edge of the wood, they were stopped by a large group of anxious looking people.
“Oh, my...,” said Sirius, then he whispered, but Harry heard him clearly, “Run. Now.”
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.
“No,” said Millicent indignantly. “I can take it off just fine.”
Ignoring him, Harry focused on Lupin.
“Dear Harry,
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn’t have to ask what had happened.
“In a muggle supermarket?” Harry asked, surprised by Remus’ statement. “Why don’t we send Kreature to the Alley?” Kreature was an elderly house elf that Sirius had apparently forgotten the existence of until they had stepped foot back in Grimmauld Place.
“Potter!” said Snape, suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Harry shook his head. “You belong to me because I belong to you.”
“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily. “Come in, come in, make yourself at home.”
“A really unexpected twist that… shame it couldn’t have lasted longer….Ah, yes… yes, I owe you.. how much?” he asked, as Fred and George had just scrambled over the back of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.
“Sorry, Potter, but I need this. I need to do this for me and Ely. We’re going to start a life together, finally. And I’ll be free of my father and his influencers.”
you know. Looked like he hadn’t ever slept rough in his life. One of the old lot followed him home one night. Bloke lives in this massive place in the middle of London, and yet, said he was doing it all for the money. No one who lives in a place like that is hurting for galleons, are they?”
“Come on,” drawled Draco. “If anything, it’s his Animagus form.”
Two weeks before he could stand a glimpse of himself in the mirror. The pain in his side where the mark rested seemed to breathe. A weird fascination had taken hold of him, and he caught himself looking at it often. He looked at it more than he ever had before. The large scabby place on his side begged to be itched, to be removed and irritated though otherwise it didn’t physically hurt him, much.
He cast, “Sonorous,” on his voice. Then waved a wand over his kit. His outfit changed into Hermione and Millicent’s invention.
“Good then. I had my doubts, but Cass seems to think more highly of your abilities than I do. He was always one to favor lost causes and abandoned pets.”
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.
No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly. No I don’t think I really want to….
Just as he turned around, he barely missed running into someone.
Things couldn’t have been worse.
“Nice to meet you, too, sir.”
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end…to black out….to die…
Dumbledore explained the rules, and that it was a competition. One person, a champion, from each of the three major wizarding schools in Europe would compete. Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Hogwarts.
Harry had wondered what the twins had to do with anything when Blaise spoke again.
“I mean it you brat,” she said.
Moody began to beckon the students forward, and each bristled slightly under his wand. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under the curses influence. Tracey Davis got on her hands and knees and moo’d like a cow. Crabbe grabbed Blaise and pulled him into an embrace and took him around in a version of the waltz, not caring how much Blaise was struggling in his arms until Moody too, made Blaise forget that he cared at all. Draco hopped on one leg, a seemingly tame action, but one that clearly brought back some painful memories because he kept brushing his backside as if he were checking for a tail.
At this point, Harry found he could not continue. Fawkes had left his knee, having fluttered to the floor, he rested his beautiful head against Harry’s leg. Pearly white tears fell to his injured leg and it started to repair itself.
Harry smiled calmly, contrasting the ferocity in Draco’s chest cavity.
Instantly, Peeves shouted, “STUDENT OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED IN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR! LITTLE FIRS….”
Flint halted the team as he spotted the Gryffindor’s all in a huddle. Oliver Wood standing in the middle of a rapt group featuring Fred and George, and none other than Seamus Finnigan.
Millicent was making some sort of motion at him behind Snape’s back.
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, “it’ll be easy.”
“What did you expect?” said Blaise, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the dark now on every side; they were encircling them….
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy case glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy
“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking…They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.”
“Make them bow to you and cucumbers for those ghastly bags under their eyes.”
Thank you all for reading and for the lovely comments, you know who you are, I appreciate it more than I can ever properly say. I, of course, do not own Harry, at least, not alone. I feel like he is all of ours, so thank you for sharing him with me. And Jo, if you're reading this, call me, tweet me ,stop bantering with Stephen King and send me a message on Tumblr ,at inkdrinkershadowsinger because I have an idea.
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.
“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose—that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”
Blaise gave Harry a look, which Harry tried deftly to ignore as he didn’t want to interrupt Hermione mid speech with a laugh.
Love,
“Well…through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He wasn’t smiling…
Malfoy smirked across the table.
“What are you doing here? I didn’t think you liked Quidditch,” Harry asked.
Nulli Secundus means Second to None.
The tongue of flame shot the last piece of parchment into the air and Dumbledore grabbed it eagerly.
Blaise leaned in so no one could hear him.
“He was never going to meet you—Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”
Harry shook his head, and followed Flint back into the castle.
“What are you doing?” said Lupin. “Where’s Ms. Bulstrode?
“Now, now, Percy, let him catch his breath!” said Mr. Bagman.
The whole thing made Harry feel off. Thankfully, the girls had continued their corral, and sat around him at dinner, keeping the conversation moving fluidly.
“Of course not.”
Several people were already at the table. Sirius sat at his place at the head of the table, and promptly dawned a pointy party hat that looked like someone had stolen it from a Muggle’s third birthday party.
“Never…do….that….again,” said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.
“Hagrid,” Harry began. “We should have been here to help too.”
“Eh?” said Hagrid. “How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated.
“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a squeaky voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper! It didn’t sound anything like Winky did it?”
“Remus!” said Harry as he hugged the other man.
“Everything will work. Sirius and I will both give our testimonies, and the Wizengamot will be forced to put an end to this.”
“Why would I?”
“It seems we have had a change in decoration,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”
“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice was shaking slightly, but his wand hand was quite steady.
“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Blaise, pointing at a rather neatly wrapped box. “I caught Millie flipping through a wizarding catalog a few weeks ago, but I wouldn’t go asking her about it, she’d just deny it was
“I was lucky once, right?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I’ll get lucky again.”
Every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. After a brief run in with both of the castle’s guards, Millicent pulled him in the direction of Gryffindor
the fireplace. Malfoy as prefect was standing along the head boy and girl. Malfoy looked harried in the firelight as he batted questions from two over eager first years who Harry guessed were likely twins.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” she asked.
He apologized quickly to Professor Lupin then left the classroom, hoping that he hadn’t ruined his shot at more lessons in the future.
Guys this is a short update because I needed to slightly rewrite the second task. But the good news is that there will be two updates for next week to make up for my lack of direction. I do hope you like this chapter though. Finally some Drarry interaction, and there will be more next week of course.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked.
He didn’t want him.
Draco lurched his hand away from the man, and went for his wand. Then all hell broke loose.
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll—in the dungeons—thought you ought to know.”
Recently, he even came back smiling, clearly pleased with his efforts, and Harry had rarely ever seen Flint smile. It was weird.
“You wait here,” Harry said, as he watched as past Harry shut the door to Hagrid’s hut. Harry waited until the executioner and the Committee member entered the hut, then he went for Buckbeak. The beast pulled against his freedom, desperately trying to get back to Hagrid, but Harry pulled harder, digging his heels into the Earth. He pulled until the beast seemed to give up and go easily.
“He’s already killed a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think he’d not be able to do it again?”
Some of the other members of the team Terrance Higgs and Adrian Pucey among them were flying around the pitch, looping and tossing what looked like a rather large medicine ball. At Flint’s feet was a large wooden chest. Harry had never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seas were raised in stand around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles
“Tut, tut,-- fame clearly isn’t everything.”
Remus had pulled an Aunt Marge.
“Well?” said Snape.
“You don’t have to know right now, Harry.”
“Come on,” he said irritably. “The both of you, not you Weasley,” Marcus sneered as Harry and Millicent followed him, Harry thought to his execution.
“Traveling, demontors, and Cyndi Lauper must agree with you, Potter, because you’re looking quite the catch.”
“Someone should be sent to look for her,” said Mr. Weasley. “She’s been gone quite a….”
He stopped when he heard Filch’s voice.
“True, but neither would your mark mate.”
“Well, I… I mean, look I just came out here because I thought you were worried about it, but….”
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
“Is anything worrying you, Harry?”
Remus laughed, looking younger in his joy.
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws…Something was bounding toward them out of the dark….something enormous. It was a pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
“Who has time to wait for you to finish your nightly soak and face routine, Zabini.”
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-dementor, a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.”
“That’s nothing,” he said. “Just something to keep me entertained. I was thinking about taking someone from the team, I think…”
“It’s not too late, you know?”
“All the kid’s will probably just walk right on by it. It won’t be anything special to them. You remember how we were in school, we didn’t pay attention to anything.”
Suddenly, Harry felt wide awake. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him. What about Blaise? Should Harry wake him?
“’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.
“Aren’t they friends?”
Snape became stern again.
“What is it you were saying, Bulstrode, we could be prefects if we wanted to,” said Fred, moving towards them.
“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?” he whispered. “Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears? I will not have you run away with a false idea of your father, Potter. Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you, your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts, and likely sent to Azkaban, and you would never have been born.”
A noise in the next room made them all jump, but it wasn’t Malfoy.
Warrington. Whistle. Fleur. Whistle. Krum.Whistle. Oh sweet jumping Hippogriffs. It was his turn.
It was Filch and Mrs. Norris.
Eventually, the pair separated, but Harry’s hand was still in Draco’s hair.
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s. He hesitated not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door.
“Remember all that tea I gave Malfoy for his pre-bonding gift?”
“Because that’s where I live Potter,” said Draco.
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
Then, “We’ll help you.”
Harry looked out of the corner of his eye, and finally noticed Remus glance their way. The man was still laughing at Sirius’ antics, but his eyes were trained on Harry, assessing the conversation that was going on between him and Mrs. Zabini.
It was clear who Crouch had been talking about.
“I want Fang,” said Malfoy, quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
They were part way to the door before they heard an extra set of footsteps.
Hermione gasped. Harry and Millicent wheeled round.
“What’s happening?”
“No, please leave!”
“You drink that,” said Harry. “Go back, get Millie, grab a broom and fly through the trapdoor. Go to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I won’t be a
Harry and Hermione ran toward him.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and led it to his side. Draco looked into his eyes, and Harry nearly burst into tears because he knew what would be there. In his dream, he had felt his mark burn almost like it was branding itself anew onto his skin, but it was not Harry’s skin that the mark was reappearing on. It was Draco’s.
It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes--- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, everyone only thought Sirius killed Peter. I believed it myself,” said Lupin, sounding regretful. “Until I saw his name on the map. Peter’s alive Harry…the map never lies. Ron’s holding him Harry.”
“The Ireland supporters are really going at it, huh?” asked Fred as the group plus Millicent walked back to the camp. Ginny and Millicent were singing Irish folk songs with George as accompaniment. Ron was still going on about the beauty that is Krum in motion when they entered the tent and Harry heard a particularly loud explosion of fireworks before Mr. Weasley rushed inside.
“Avada Kedavra.”
“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every move not to move his lips
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Professor McGonagall was out of sight. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that message.
“You won’t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue and one I need to teach you before you die…. Perhaps another little dose of pain?” Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s father. He heard it crack as the curse missed him.
“There’s only enough there for one of us,” Hermione said. “That’s hardly one swallow.”
“Oh, Weasley, hadn’t you better be hurrying along now,” said Malfoy, as he refused to address Harry directly since Harry had snubbed him in the booth. “You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”
“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. “I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
Millicent shook her head wildly.
“We’re the chess pieces,” said Harry.
“Here,” Blaise said, passing Harry some water. “You can’t fall asleep, the gang will be here soon.”
Malfoy tutted.
While Millicent was in the tunnel with Lupin, she had idea. With all of that Slytherin cunning she knew that they had to cover their asses in case somehow Harry’s brilliant plan and the weak binds around Pettigrew’s wrists weren’t enough to hold him. So, she had made a decision.
Okay, I hated how Eloise Midgen was picked on for being chubby in the books so I gave her some sass with that ass, and Blaise loves it so there you stuck up Ravenclaws....lol
Warrington nods.
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
“Minister,” Lucius acknowledged, a slick smile on his face. “The charges,” he followed.
Harry didn’t bother looking at the Malfoy heir. He could always sense when Draco was near. And the two had decided before Draco left the hospital the other day, that neither of them would discuss Draco’s involvement in Harry’s rescue. If Draco wanted to help Harry then Harry had a role he could fill. Spy.
“The loo,” Draco answers. Perhaps, that second drink was a little too much for him. Draco, while an excellent auror partner has always been a piss poor drinking buddy.
“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.
“I’d like to see you fly sometime, Potter. I’m always looking for new talent in case people get too comfortable.”
Edited 8/7/2019
Draco never thought he’d be here. Sitting on a bean bag chair in Luna Lovegood’s living room staring up at a mural of Harry Potter. But here he was.
“They think that maybe Black…..”
“See?” said Harry as if Dean Thomas’ words could affect the match and given the relieved look on Seamus’ face, maybe they could.
the pair.
The two boys moved toward the door. “Are you at least sorry you called me stupid?” Harry asked the dark skinned boy.
“He more than makes up for that, sir. He’s one of the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers we’ve ever had.”
“Why don’t you trust me?” he asked. “I’ve never pressured you into showing me your mark, but to think that you feel so low about your place in my life…” He stopped, face red and nearly out of breath after his ranting. “You’ve met my family for goodness sake. Sometimes I honestly think they like you more than me. Hermione and Ron call and the first thing they ask is how you’re doing.”
The now golden thread connecting Harry’s and Voldemort’s wands splintered, a thousand more beams arched until they were enclosed in a golden, dome shaped web. The Death Eater’s scrambled to help their master.
“Sleep on the couch then. I’m going to bed,” said Draco.
“That one was quite popular back then too.”
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
Just then Hermione got up to go return a book. As she rose so did Pansy. The Slytherin nearly stepping on the other girl’s soles as she hurried to walk behind her.
“He doesn’t want a new rat,” Harry said reading Ron’s expression.
Malfoy has signed on for team building exercises? Is anyone else game?
As the two laid in bed together, finally without armor, Harry ran his hand over Draco’s mark, and thanked God for every line.
Harry walks into the kitchen, and picks up the steaming cup.
“Sirius, No!” Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again.
In the morning, Draco had to pry Harry’s body from his side. He woke, Harry’s head on his chest, tilted up so Draco couldn’t possibly miss the peaceful look on his face. Harry’s leg was between his own, Harry’s arms wrapped around Draco tighter than a noose around his neck. Draco gently pushed Harry off, less they were put in another awkward position, but this time Draco did something truly stupid like nuzzle Harry’s hair or let his fingers hitchhike across the little valleys of Harry’s spine. He went to the bathroom and took a real shower, putting up enough silencing charms to keep Harry asleep.
Harry watched the figure slyly as the young figure moved in his direction. Harry thought briefly that it might be someone with nefarious intent before putting that thought aside. It was fine. He wasn’t Harry Potter now. No one could see his face or know his identity. He was James no last name. He didn’t need one, not tonight.
“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared, happily, waving a hand at them. “Beautiful aren’t they?”
Fine, Harry thought.
“Perhaps you have to marry her next? That’s a task few survive,” he said so only Harry could hear.
“Oh, yeah,” she said, touching her hair like she had forgotten that it had changed at all. “My mother nearly had a coronary, but it was almost time for school anyway so I figured why not. I know it’s not blowing up my aunt, but a little bit of teenage rebellion never killed anyone, yet,” she smiled and Harry laughed.
“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!”
“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.
“No,” said Harry.
“Hermione and I…” Millicent spoke up.
Harry smiled, no doubt remembering Draco’s insistence that even in the middle of foreplay that Draco’s clothes were not to be ripped or town in any way. And “for Salazar’s sake Potter, do not rumple the silk.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked.
“And where will I sit,” asked Ginny.
Their run in with Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been the icing on the cake. Harry wondered if it was possible for hair to break off. If so, he hoped that those snowballs he threw at Malfoy’s head as they were scurrying off did the trick. Just as Harry was thinking of all the possibilities and was stepping back out into the corridor at school he heard some footsteps.
