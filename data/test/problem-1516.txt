The nightmares were that little bit easier to cope with that night. One might even say they weren’t even nightmares
Hermione narrowed her eyes, clearly noticing the topic change but likely just happy that Harry wasn’t obsessing over Malfoy like he did in sixth year.
Harry groaned, pulling his gaze from Draco to the desk in front of him - there was nothing worse than staring at a blank parchment, waiting for the first sentence to be written.
Thinking of Hogwarts, he’d need some people in there. He knew Dolores Umbridge had worked there as the Defence teacher, so she would have a good knowledge of the school, and she’d embraced all of her duties in the Ministry wholeheartedly, despite not being under the imperius curse. She’d make a fine headmistress.
Most of it was speculation and fairytales - he scoffed after reading the first few lines of one of them, which was clearly an erotic novel - but one of them was particularly useful. It had been written by a couple who were both researchers and soulmates, and had done a considerable amount of viable research on the subject.
?” Harry winced at Bellatrix’s high-pitched screech, cursing himself for dropping his wand. Not that he would have been able to defend himself, probably, but he could have at least had a chance.
Harry scoffed, running his eyes concernedly over Draco’s figure. Draco rolled his eyes, saying “I’m fine, get out, I need to go to the toilet!”
Draco straightened and looked haughtily down at Harry. “I can,” he said indignantly, taking all of one step before swaying again.
“What’s wrong, Ronald?” Hermione said, reaching the top of the stairs. “Brilliant, Harry’s out of bed. Dinner?”
“They’re death eaters - surely they won’t stick to their deal?” Fred — or George, Hermione wasn’t sure — raised one eyebrow, growing considerably more pale by the second.
Draco had got in response wasn’t what he wanted to hear. Had they shared nothing, in the past twenty-four hours? One conversation with the other two Gryffindors and Harry remembered who he really was - Harry Potter, Saviour of the wizarding world, outgoing, reckless Gryffindor.
Draco told them so, to which Grang–Hermione replied, “well then, it’s a good job we’re in the biggest room, then, isn’t it?”
Hermione elbowed him, and he shot a glare at her, immediately cowed by the one she returned. “Let’s go,” she said, sighing.
Draco frowned - he wasn’t sure about the beliefs Harry had been brought up with, and while Harry was very accepting he wasn’t sure what the tone of his voice suggested. “No, it was homosexual. That’s where another of the theories arose - in the case of two male soulmates, they can get pregnant.”
“No need to be scared, Potter, now drink this.” Harry tore his eyes from Malfoy to see Snape, looking greasy but…concerned?
“Alright, well, that’s done.” A bit of an understatement, but Ron really had other priorities. He started running back, shouting over his shoulder, “now come on, we need to take Bill to Severus, he been bitten.”
Ron jumped as Dumbledore walked right through him. He took one glance at the potion and announced to Harry, “we have to drink it.”
He was just coming to the terms with the fact that maybe the Black House didn’t have any when he heard footsteps and voices — Ron and Hermione’s — coming down the stairs.
“We’ll have a lot of fun, won’t we Potter.” Bellatrix’s high–pitched voice caused Harry’s headache to pound harder, as if trying to break out of his skull.
Severus walked into the room a moment later. “Nice to see you, Harry. Shame Remus isn’t here tonight — he hasn’t talked to you in a while, has he? — but he’s checking on the Yorkshire set of muggleborns with Bill tonight.”
He’d watched Remus take Draco’s off yesterday — it had been painful, judging by Draco’s silent winces, but the way he’d looked at his wrist in wonder, lightly grazed his fingers over the clear skin…Draco had assured them both that the pain had been well worth it.
Draco was absolutely shattered the next morning, having only gotten four hours of sleep, but it was worth it to see Harry’s face light up at the sight of the cake on the dining table, complete with seventeen never–melting candles.
He wasn’t particularly shocked at the idea, but pulled back into his own mind. Harry smelled of freshly cut grass and leather, on the surface, but underneath there was the faint scent of cinnamon. Draco inhaled it, falling asleep with Harry in his arms.
Harry felt all the blood drain from his face, and a glance to the side confirmed that the same had happened to Malfoy. “And what does that
, of all people, was in the dungeon, he felt his chest twist. He hadn’t made a promise, exactly — not like the one he made to Narcissa, but as good as. And now the boy was in the dungeon; likely being tortured, if he knew the Dark Lord at all.
The study session was...fine. It wasn’t anything special - Ron wrote one line and then fucked around for the next hour and a half, Harry wrote about half of his transfiguration essay then joined Ron in fucking around, and Hermione wrote twice the amount required before worriedly wondering “will this be enough?”
“There isn’t.” Molly’s eyes hardened, even as they shone with unshed tears, and she turned to the twins. “Polyjuice. Now. Make sure you have enough left for Ron and Hermione, and bring two boxes for a bit of our hair.”
As he did before, he left the food next to Harry’s bed. But as the weekend progressed, Harry didn’t eat any of the food Draco gave him. He rejected Draco every time he tried to talk to him, slowly chipping away at his sanity.
“Thank you, my lord.” Draco didn’t allow even a flicker of disgust across his face, as he knelt to kiss a polished, black shoe.
He cast a heating charm around the kitchen. Kreacher had died around a year before James had been born, but in his later years had not been very helpful anyway. Harry didn’t have to call down the rest of their family, as they appeared after smelling the enticing of scent of waffles. “Have some fruit as well,” Harry instructed, indicating the bowl of fruit next to the plate with four hot, fresh waffles. Draco and James, who both had very sweet tastes, put strawberries and chocolate sauce on theirs, while Harry and Scorpius both preferred blueberries and small quantities of syrup.
Now was a different situation. His soulmate, who he’d comforted last night, was applying dittany into a bruise on his side, green eyes slightly narrowed, and Draco could feel small waves of anger gently pulsing through the bond. Hopefully not at Draco.
“Let me do this - it’s the least I can do,” Harry had said, already dipping his fingers in the salve. He focused on the task at hand - there was something therapeutic about the way the bruises and cuts faded under his fingers, how Draco relaxed, how those trusting grey eyes stared into his own.
After what seemed like an aeon, Harry stopped moving. He tried to take note of his surroundings as best as he could, being tied up and blindfolded — it was cold, and the air smelled of mildew. He heard some murmuring, before a loud
Harry walked up the staircase to the dorms. It was quite late, and not surprising that Hermione and Ron thought he was shagging someone. Seamus, Dean and Neville’s curtains were already drawn, and Harry pulled off his uniform, pulling on an old, baggy t-shirt of Dudley’s and climbing into bed.
Harry blinked, tensing his muscles to try and get rid of pins and needles tingling across his skin. Apparation remained the most unpleasant method of travel.
Harry gestured to his cloak draped over his chair, looking confused. Draco rolled his eyes and drawled “not
Despite being prepared, Harry jumped when Draco walked in, and was even more surprised when Draco appeared to be unharmed. “Why don’t you look hurt? I felt -“
Regardless, Harry had lost a lot of weight, looking more like his first year self with each passing day. He had permanent, purpleish bags under his eyes, and his head was always throbbing at the base of his skull. Whenever it approached his scar, Harry automatically grabbed his wand and put up a
Severus nodded and gathered the last dregs of his magic, apparating directly into the dining room of Grimmauld Place and collapsing in the nearest chair.
die.” Draco smirked as Severus had apparently appeared in the doorway, eliciting small gasps from Weasley and Granger.
“Shut up, the pair of you.” The eye-roll was audible in Severus’ voice. “You’ll survive a small amount of time on the floor—”
Quickly realising that it was almost impossible to have a private conversation in such a crowded house, Narcissa was sent to get a system of safehouses set up with Millicent, Seamus, Dean and Luna. After a lot of arguing, it was determined that Ginny could stay, but first she had to go and visit the rest of her brothers.
Everyone was dying, these days. Harry must think that Remus had abandoned him — but then again, the poor boy was probably used to it. Remus couldn’t do him any good, anyway.
“Let me - it’s the least I can do.” Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes from under his lashes, his words barely a whisper. Draco couldn’t identify what he was feeling through the bond.
Draco must have blacked out, because suddenly he was facing a toilet with someone rubbing circles into his back. Not quite ready to face reality, Draco took three deep breaths, before straightening and hoping that his instincts had taken him somewhere safe.
“No it isn’t you idiot, we learned the charms to take out various liquids and foods from clothes after the great gravy incident of fourth year.” Indeed, Blaise already had his wand out and was siphoning away the last of the juice. “My problem, on the other hand, is much more significant - I won’t be able to get a pulpless glass of pumpkin juice!”
She rolled her eyes before continuing. “This is going to have a drain on your magic, but not as bad as mine. Just a warning.”
his voice easily filled the room, but he wanted to make sure every one of his followers heard him. “In one hour, all of you will go to the Burrow, where the Weasley blood–traitors live. You will erect anti–apparation wards and give them an ultimatum: they will have fifteen minutes to either give you Ronald Weasley and the mudblood Hermione Granger or their house will go up in flames with them in it. Once you have got the two children, you will immediately bring them back for questioning within half an hour of leaving, without harming them. Is that understood?”
Overall, Draco had rather preferred his private meals with Harry, but this was worth it - not only because Harry was slowly becoming more social, but also because when he was around his friends his eyes gradually gained the light they’d once had, he smiled for freely and those casual touches that Draco lived for increased significantly. Furthermore, the density of the shadows around Harry’s mind decreased, at least while they were conversing.
“You should really get better with the glamours if you don’t want anyone to notice them, you know,” Draco said, carefully straightening the parting of his hair. He no longer put gel in it, favouring loose waves, but that doesn’t mean he could leave it like Harry’s.
“They’ll likely take you through the Thief's Downfall, so you have to do some of the disguise the muggle way.” Millicent said. “The lighting at the bottom is
The healing books were completely useless — they talked about letting people recuperate in a comfortable environment, and that their magic would help. If Voldemort let Potter have access to his magic, he’d break out.
However, Harry wasn’t brilliant at keeping his emotions in. At mealtimes, he occasionally sent through a spark of panic, making Draco jump, before inserting himself smoothly into whatever conversation Harry was having, stopping him from having to answer whatever he had to do. Draco didn’t mind; he was very well trained for this sort of thing from the rigorous pure blood training his parents had put him through, and the Gryffindor table was hardly difficult to navigate. And it was made even easier to bear by Luna, with her odd insertions with perfect timing and non-Gryffindor robes.
No answer from behind the curtains. Draco got ready for bed, grabbing another book and settling into bed. He’d have to owl his mother for more books at this rate.
Harry looked down at Draco’s face again, feeling his pulse stop for a couple of beats, before continuing beneath Harry’s fingertips. Should he try to give Draco a choice? Is Draco as willing to spend his life with Harry as Harry is?
pain, but he ignored it in favour of listening to the thoughts racing through Voldemort’s head as he threw bright green curses left and right in fury. Harry assumed this was the aftermath of Narcissa leaving with Ginny, and the rest of the people who Voldemort had probably locked in the dungeons. He was panicking about
Then they got to the Great Hall, and it was as bad as the Feast last night. Flashbacks of everyone who had died, even those who didn’t die in the Battle, like Moody, hit Harry harder than the Hogwarts express ever could. He pushed all the emotions that threatened to well up down, down, where he didn’t have to acknowledge them.
Draco nodded and took her hand, noting her strong grip and steady posture. She’d never been one to mess with, but now her eyes conveyed a clear message:
After what seemed like an age, but was more likely five seconds, Granger held out her hand. “I accept your apology - any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine, and I think you’ve changed for the better. Call me Hermione.”
He didn’t care what Severus thought. If there was a chance to help defeat the Dark Lord, he was taking it.
Tearful reunions ensued as Ginny saw Harry, Ron, Hermione and Remus, and she even gave Draco a brief hug, Luna quickly following. A rather hearty bro hug — with a great deal of back–slapping — occurred between Harry, Ron, Dean and Seamus, but tears shone on their faces anyway. Hannah and Millicent Bulstrode looked uncomfortable on the sidelines, and started talking to Severus, rather than interrupt the reunions, who in turn looked relieved to have a distraction.
Nagini was in a levitating ball about a metre above the ground, and appeared to be asleep. No alarms went off; no inferi burst out of the walls.
“Thanks, Potter.” Draco was suddenly very aware just how close he was to Potter. Their robes were touching, their hands still clasped, Potter's lips not two inches from Draco’s. Those very soft looking, full, kissable lips. Draco forced himself to look into those very green, sincere eyes.
Harry had woken up that morning at 8:53, to the image of Ron’s face about five inches from his. It was really quite terrifying.
“What have you done?” Harry groaned, turning to see Draco coming up the aisle, looking as beautiful as ever, with a grin to match Hermione’s.
Harry had been lying in bed, staring at the wall, when he’d felt a shooting pain at the top of his thigh.
. His hair was limp, instead of sticking out at all angles with its usual vigour. Potter’s usually tanned skin was paler, and extremely unhealthy, as if he hadn’t been outside in months. His eyes were dim, looking haunted with ghosts no one else could see. The bags under his eyes looked permanently carved into his face, a horrible purple-grey behind his glasses. His clothes, already too big with the glamour on, hung limply off his skeletal frame - his shoulders slumped, looking like he was carrying the world on his shoulders, his collarbones sticking out at the base of his throat and Draco was sure that his ribs were sticking out underneath his shirt.
Take it, take what you need, just don’t die, come back, come back to me Draco,” Harry screamed, cradling Draco’s body.
Harry took three deep breaths while counting to ten. As he watched, no stray hexes came near him - no one so much as looked at him. In his mind, he retreated to the edge of his mind, where the bond left, bathing in the warm emotions Draco radiated, not particularly registering them but just revelling in the fact that they were
muggle, he supposed, which went against his previous beliefs) but it turned to approval, before he turned back to his conversation, where the Weasel was yelling at Thomas. Thomas was attractive, Draco thought, glancing at his arse, but he didn’t hold a candle to Potter.
Harry groaned and waved a hand at Draco, before grunting “How am I supposed to get up with a Hippogriff on me?”
He waited for the boy to be fully alert, then, not seeing the point in beating around the bush, said “Did you tell anyone else about the horcruxes?”
“A bit difficult to do that while on the run from...everybody.” Potter shook his head, his hair flopping everywhere, then ran a hand through it, making it messier. He hadn’t picked up that habit until fifth year, Draco had noted, and always been rather confused since he knew that hadn’t been Potter’s best year. Maybe it was a nervous habit? But then why on Earth would he bite his nails…
“Fine. In any case, I’ll get the pleasure of watching you fall down them.” Draco smirked, opening the door with his hand and pushing it open, before gesturing with his hand. “Go ahead.”
They looked like they were about to object, but stopped at Molly’s set jaw and the tears lining her eyes, turning and slowly making their way up the stairs.
Granger sighed. “I know we all have our stuff, and we’re working through it differently, but we need to talk to him soon.”
Draco didn’t quite pull away, allowing Harry to make the next move. Harry didn’t hesitate, surging upwards, his arms wrapping around Draco and his fingers digging into the soft material of the jumper that started it all, their mouths clashing together with fiery passion, and Harry knew all in the moment that this was what was meant to be.
Narcissa took a deep breath. “Well, I heard that there were more children in the dungeon, and that was the final straw. I grabbed my bag in the middle of the night, grabbed them and ran — though not before setting off a couple of those swamp bombs from the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.” Everyone around the table snorted appreciatively, none louder than Ron.
looking after. She wasn’t as determined as Potter, which was a relief - she only talked to him when the class was required to pair up, which wasn’t often. On top of that, he had somehow managed to find Draco’s nook in the library where nobody harassed him.
Harry rushed forward, ignoring the lingering pulse of pain and anger in his mind as he pulled the chain, sighing in relief as a boat appeared.
Dreams of Harry had kept him from spiralling, during those times when Nagini slithered outside of his room, when his father had looked at him with such disdain in his eyes. He’d determinedly kept Harry away from Voldemort’s probes into his mind, guarding them fiercely and giving up little pieces of himself instead. But never Harry.
pure–blooded Blacks in the house. After a while, he finally gathered himself and snapped his fingers, causing everyone’s luggage to float in the air. “Everyone will be following Kreacher to their rooms, now.”
half a foot shorter, so it was bound to be shorter. On top of that, the neckline was very wide - Harry usually didn’t think twice about it, but it was
Draco’s heart broke at the tone of Harry’s voice. It broke a little more when he answered his own question; “You think you deserve it.”
Harry knelt at his parents’ grave, gently setting the lilies in front of the tombstone. “Hi, mum, dad. I guess it’s been a while. The war is over now; for real, this time. We killed Voldemort back in January, which meant a shit tonne of government stuff. This is my first day off in a while, which is a bit rubbish because I saved the wizarding world — surely I should be allowed a few more days off, right?” Harry chuckled slightly, wiping at the tears already starting to run down his face. “I’m dating someone, now — Draco Malfoy. I guess you knew his father, but know that he’s nothing like him. Absolutely wonderful — the complete opposite, really. I think you would like him.
Draco was quite confused these days. Not only had Potter decided to become his potions assistant (not that he was complaining), he was sitting next to Draco in charms and transfiguration despite not needing much help. He had apparently asked Granger to look after him in ancient runes and arithmancy, which Draco wouldn’t mind except he didn’t
“Ask me what?” Hermione jumped, her hand instinctively going for her wand as she spun around. At the sight of Malfoy, she sighed and sat back down. A glance at Ron revealed that Ron was sneering with disgust at him. It was just childish of him, at this point — Malfoy had brought Harry back, for goodness sake. Perhaps they shouldn’t trust the Slytherin indubitably, but they could at least be civil and give him the benefit of the doubt.
This left the pair in a rather precarious friendship, flirting and acting rather domestic while both simultaneously denying that they were picking up any hints from the other.
“...Haven’t seen Harry in a while. I know he’s working through some stuff but I didn’t expect him to change so much. I miss him.” Granger looked guilty.
Now, though, he couldn’t feel further from the Dursley’s. He was wrapped up in Draco’s arms, his breath tickling the nape of Harry’s neck. He didn’t feel comforted, exactly - more safe, if still on edge. Like being in the tent behind Hermione’s various wards last year.
“”Maybe not at the rate my NEWTs are going...might go work with George at the shop. Might have to get you to pull a few strings though mate.”
“Barely.” Draco rolled his eyes and hummed lightly under his breath as he reached out with long, nimble fingers, tying Harry’s tie, those grey eyes focused solely on his task. Harry held his breath, not daring to move until he was finished.
Ginny turned to leave, but her hair flared in a fiery arc as the familiar cracks of apparation sounded outside, followed by a wave of magic passing over the Burrow.
Harry bottled the potion - he always ended up with this job, despite his propensity for dropping various objects - and missed the hole to put the stopper in three times as he stared at Draco. His hair was loose and slowly curling due to the humidity, and he kept absent-mindedly brushing it out of his eyes as he packed his stuff. Harry found it ridiculously endearing.
“Don’t need to do anything.” Potter’s eyes were wide and sincere - he was either an idiot who believed he was fine, or an idiot who thought Draco was horrid enough to leave him in this state.
Ron shouted, and another deep cut appeared on Nagini’s body; but the snake was still hissing and lunging towards them. She landed a bite on Bill, who collapsed in the corner.
He started to shake Potter’s arm, but he started screaming when Draco did, so he let go. Potter then stopped screaming, going into abrupt silence, and Draco sat up, trying to see if there was another way to wake him up, but the twitching suddenly commenced again, and Draco just though
As the last rays of golden sunlight illuminated the sand, making it sparkle like glitter, Remus decided that he should probably go into Shell Cottage. At some point during the day, one of the kids had left out a meal for him — it was still on the sand, under various charms to keep the sand out and keep it fresh. He felt a stab of guilt at not eating it, but he had spent most of his time in the woods. He hadn’t even seen it until he’d made the decision to go back to the house. But after a childhood of having barely enough to eat, he still felt that pang of guilt whenever food was uneaten.
“Lucius will know as soon as I open this door, and the wards are so intricate that I can’t stop it from happening.”
“Well wear this then.” Draco walked off, and Harry sat on his bed, eyes following him curiously as he crouched down next to his bed, seeker reflexes catching a green shirt hurled at him over Draco’s shoulder.
Remus allowed Severus to haul him to his feet, before apparating to Grimmauld, leaving the Burrow empty once more.
He was silent for the entirety of the train trip. Pansy had figured out that he wasn’t feeling talkative, finally, and didn’t attempt to engage him in conversation, allowing him to wallow in self pity in the corner of the train carriage.
Manipulating the wards in the Forbidden Forest had been ridiculously easy. It was as if the old forest was helping him unravel the dark magic. Getting past the death eaters posted nearby was also easy, since they weren’t paying attention — just complaining about their shitty assignment.
“It is. But we can’t kill him.” Voldemort’s voice was silky in front of his followers, and Harry could almost see why they would follow him. Almost.
“Great.” Malfoy — oh dear Merlin, Harry was going to have to call him Draco now — leaned against the wall, clearly sulking.
Draco continued into the ‘Common Room’ - distastefully cluttered with chairs of all shapes and sizes, although there was at least a colour scheme. Purple wasn’t the best colour - Draco couldn’t help but think the room would look great with green accents rather than purple, even if he is rather biased - but at least it wasn’t Gryffindor red. He looked at the names, becoming increasingly panicky as he didn’t see his name, but there is was, next to-
But most importantly, it wasn’t a mind. Which meant the bond had gone wrong. Draco was relieved - he’d decided that he didn’t really want a bond with Potter, especially if the git figured out how to use it to his advantage. Draco shuddered at the thought of Potter finding out just how much Draco thought about him.
“Well, when you phrase it like that…” Draco raised an eyebrow, before stalking out of the room. Harry followed close behind, for once not worrying about anything other than how much homework Flitwick was going to set.
“How many people did he murder here?” Ginny wondered out loud, as they walked over limestone paths that were now decorated with dark red stains.
“Come on, you can have a nap in here…” He said, continuing to murmur under his breath as he carried her in.
Myself and detectivetalos came up with Carnes Consuo for our joint fic, Pinky Promises, which is an AU set in Harry’s third year where Remus finds out about the Dursleys :)
“I’ve got to go.” Harry sprinted out of the room, all the way to the dorms. A couple of people yelled at him as he sprinted through the common room, but he ignored them in favour of locking himself in his bathroom, casting a hasty silencing charm and hurling his guts out into  a toilet.
“Professor! Glad you could make it.” Bill smilEd welcomingly, gesturing to the table. “Make yourself at home, pasta will be ready in a bit.”
“No you don’t. You could just stay here with us.” Conan put a hand on Remus’ shoulder, and he almost melted into the touch — he didn’t like Conan romantically; — he didn’t like
He had to figure out what he was to do next. Most of the ministry was under his control — he had a living, breathing, machine, designed to wipe out all the muggleborns and blood traitors. Once that was done, and they had no opposition, they could start on the rest of Great Britain; and once the muggles were under his thumb, he’d have even bigger armies to take over the rest of the world.
Draco sighed and shuffled over, his movements at odds with his stiffly straight spine and expressionless face.
“Anything remotely interesting happen? When did you get a new cloak?” Blaise fingered Harry’s cloak.
Harry filled up the cup, miraculously not getting any of the potion on his hands, and lifted it to Dumbledore’s lips. He drank it without complaint, but once Harry was out of sight, started moaning in pain. Harry grimaced, but forced himself to take out another cup of the horrid potion.
finished healing — before turning on his heel, tailored robes flaring as he stormed up the stairs, leaving Harry alone once again.
“Move your skinny arse over,” Draco grumbled, burrowing further under the duvets and elbowing Harry towards the wall.
She winced as the Dark Lord roared “GET THEM!”, squinting to try and figure out who the two people were. One turned and flung two red stunners at the killing curses, the impeccable aim stopping the curses in midair—
Harry nodded, turning around to face Draco. He waited until Draco looked him in the eye, before saying, “Thank you.”
,” scrambling for a foothold in the conversation. He felt malicious glee spread through him as the boy writhed on the floor at his feet. Afterwards, he lay unmoving, his chest barely moving.
“You wish.” Harry continued to smirk as Draco sneered at him, before turning his attention to Slughorn at the front of the classroom.
, the spell revealing no one else. Next she called Kreacher, summoning Harry’s letter from her bag — he grumbled, but Harry had apparently phrased it correctly as he obeyed her orders to tell her about the wards on the townhouse.
the old man’s fault — Severus had had terrible choice in friends during his years at Hogwarts — but the idea of actually being able to do something
Draco walked backwards into the room, bringing Harry with him, until his legs hit the side of a bed. Harry kept walking and the pair ended up sprawled on the bed, tangled in each other.
“Well a lot of people lost people in the war, and they deal with it differently. For some people, that means using me as their punchbag.”
“A blood potion. A blood magic potion. And he’s tying someone’s life to his own — probably the same person who the other healing potions were for.” Draco’s mind whirled with possibilities as he paced in front of  Severus, who was sitting on the sofa, watching him with a bemused expression.
“We have to give it a go.” Ron was so pale that his freckles looked like spots of blood on his skin, but his mouth was set in a determined line.
It had been agreed that Narcissa was going — being the sister of Bellatrix, her magic was likely similar enough to pass any tests. Severus was also going, as he outright refused to let the ‘kids’ to get all the glory, and he was an excellent dueller. After more debates, Millicent Bullstrode was decided to be the third — her mother used to work at Gringotts, and Millicent went there from time to time, so she had extra knowledge of the layout of the bank.
“I shouldn’t cause worry for other people either.” His jaw clenched in stubbornness, and Hermione smiled at the glimpse of the old Harry she knew and loved.
on the silk items — but he could just use ironing charms once they were out. Severus said he had a hideout which could be used until Potter could take them somewhere safer — his godfather had likely left him somewhere with loads of wards, since he would have been the last living Black who had access to areas. There was a building which Draco knew existed, but not its name or whereabouts — probably under a Fidelius. Hopefully, Potter could get them in.
“That sounds...intense. I’m glad our war has finished.” Harry shuddered, before continuing. “Two wizards? Was it a platonic relationship?”
Draco flushed at the pet name, and Harry grinned, before planting a huge, wet kiss on Draco’s flaming cheek.
Kreacher snarled, spitting out every word. “It has a silver chain, with a big green shiny and a letter on, and Master Regulus trusted Kreacher with it, so you shall not be having it!”
“I couldn’t...there was no way out. Even back then, there was no way out. I tried running away once, when I was six - I got down the street before something literally controlled my body and took it back.” Harry was still shaking, and Draco didn’t know what to do - never, after a nightmare, had Harry not sat up. Draco remained silent, but sat down on the side of the bed. Harry didn’t say anything, but didn’t calm down either, so Draco slid under the covers, awkwardly folding one arm in front of him and draping the other over Harry, who shuffled backwards, uncurling slightly. Holding his breath, Draco slid his other arm under Harry, pulling the other boy flush against his chest. Harry let loose a sob, that had likely been building up for a while, the tension leaving his body as he continued shaking.
Voldemort had meant to take it out, he really did, but what with Severus leaving, then Narcissa breaking out the kids and ruining the trap at Godric’s Hollow, he’d really had a lot going on. Not to mention, Alecto and Amycus were completely
However, two hours later, Harry was curled up in the corner, clutching his stomach. He’d previously survived for longer on less food, but the years of Hogwarts feasts and cakes in the summer had spoiled him. Not to mention that that last slice of bread had tasted a bit iffy.
“Harry, mate, what’s wrong?” Ron knelt beside Harry, laying the back of his hand against Harry’s forehead. He was burning up, but also shaking with full body tremors.
Inwardly groaning at the thought of having to move, he straightened his back and caustiously moved forwards, grimacing as his hands came across a barrier, which caused an unpleasant spark against his skin similar to static electricity.
“Polyjuice. The twins made a special one that lasts longer — if we assaulted some high ranking members of the ministry, people could easily get the documents we need.”
“We do - but not you.” Arthur looked at Molly, who nodded. He turned to the twins. “You have polyjuice in your room, right?”
Dumbledore strode up to the wall, and cut his hand, red blood spraying across the rock. Instantaneously, the entire cavern was illuminated in a blinding white light, coming from the wall, a section of which disappeared.
“Could you describe it?” Hermione said hopefully. She heard a sigh from the other side of the room, where Draco was standing.
He realised that he’d been staring at Potter’s lips when there was another burst of white from the end of Potter’s wand.
“You can bring it a bit closer, y’know,” Harry said. Ron looked at him doubtfully, but dragged it over a bit more, so he was about five feet away. Harry nodded at him, and he smiled slightly before sitting down.
was with his horcrux, and Dumbledore’s silvery hair was glimmering on the stone of the island. He removed the anti-apparition wards with a wave of his wand, knowing that the Potter boy didn’t have a way out of the island, and apparated to the island.
, because this was the second person from his inner circle who had left. Behind the shield of instability, Harry heard the word
Harry rolled his eyes and forced his mouth to turn up at the corners slightly - Ron always waited until the last day to pack, always forgot something and that something was, without fail, needed the day before it arrived. “It’s impressive you’ve got him packing this early in the week.”
Green light shot out of his wand - straight at Harry, who didn’t even flinch - who fell backwards, almost gracefully, out of the tall window behind him.
Harry thought. How did he proceed? Should he hug Draco? Should he break the tension with a shitty joke?
Harry wasn’t quite sure when he noticed, but at some point he realised that he was falling in love with Draco. It didn’t quite hit him all at once, but rather seeped into the edges of his thoughts and settled into the corners of his mind, ready for him to acknowledge when he was ready.
“That…a lot happened. I’d rather not talk about it, but…wait, isn’t there a pensieve around here somewhere?”
“Only me, Harry, Ron and Dumbledore — and Voldemort,” she added as an afterthought, not missing how everyone else at the table flinched at the name, “know about it. So no.”
Surprised to not see any fear in the boy’s eyes at the sight of him, Voldemort narrowed his eyes slightly. “No.”
— perhaps he’d put up with his friends’ bigotry too much for Remus’ tastes, but he’d never actually joined in said bigotry.
He ran headfirst into some aurors, all under the imperius, based upon their sluggish movements and slightly dazed expressions, before they hardened into suspicion.
Draco stumbled out, turning to look at the house a safe distance from the flames. The fire was rampaging throughout the house, and one particular flowerbed had been attacked.
Harry checked his own stance. He was exhausted, but not in a way food or sleep could fix. He was slightly slouching, shoulders curling inwards, and his face was devoid of emotion. Better than not being there at all, Harry figured, not caring enough to sort himself out.
Just as the last letter was sent off, Harry swore loudly, clutching his forehead. He saw the world pitch to the side before he was in Voldemort’s head.
to — Remus secretly learned French and found out Sirius’s angry–sounding tangents were really just dramatic lists of everything he loved about Remus. Remus smiled softly, watching the closed door of the cottage — the softly peeling paint, so close the to steel grey of Sirius’ eyes…
“I felt well enough to come down. Also a bit of cabin fever — there’s only so much that happens on the streets of London.”
“Hermione, I understand that you’re worried, but they probably just haven’t had an opportunity.” Molly’s words were kind, but her tone was clearly condescending.
“Food!” Draco announced, sitting at the end of Harry’s bed without invitation and putting the basket on Harry’s stomach.
“No, Draco, it is. I was his ‘secret weapon’ — of course he wasn’t going to tell anyone about me. Carry on, Mrs. — Narcissa.”
Harry started at his name, but Dumbledore was mumbling about ‘Ab’ again. Harry bit his lip, feeding Dumbledore the sixth mouthful.
As she entered the cell, Harry tried one last time to break through the film, screaming with the effort. As a knife was thrown towards his face, directly at his eye, he succeeded, the entire world going back as the knife made contact—
“Thank you, Harry.” Harry smiled, a soft, precious thing. Which quickly changed as his eyes glinted dangerously.
,” she brandished her index finger at the boys, who flinched slightly from the action, which was quite similar to Molly Weasley, “will stop me, because it is the right thing to do, and I won’t let you.”
He didn't even offer to bring Draco food. He was clearly just asking as a courtesy.  Anyway, Draco didn’t need food. Or coddling.
“No, no thank you. I think I’m going to head off to bed. Thank you,” he added, as Remus turned to leave, “I — I genuinely cannot express my gratitude enough.”
It took a whole minute, during which Harry had started fidgeting, but he seemed very impressed with the results when Draco said “done,” and he examined himself in the mirror.
“I’m hallucinating, right, guys? Harry’s not standing in front of me. He can’t be.” Draco said from behind Harry, his voice getting quieter. Harry turned again, and grabbed Draco’s face with both hands.
Then Hermione — I assume it’s Hermione, since that definitely isn’t Ron’s handwriting — added in brackets:
They took a small infiltration group; the residents of Grimmauld place, as well as Narcissa, Bill Weasley (in case there were any extra wards to remove), and the Weasley twins (who brought a veritable armoury of pranks from their shop). Once Ginny caught wind that Narcissa had given them free reign to destroy her house, she insisted that she come along, and then Percy had protested that he, too, was a Weasley, and should ‘participate in any shenanigans that were to take place’.
Voldemort’s eye twitched, and he sent another barrage of spells at Harry. Rather than fight back, he absorbed the power, banishing the darkness. Then, he slowly breathed out, sending bright diamonds, sharper than knives, shooting towards Voldemort.
would have found a way to contact us.” Hermione stood at the head of the table, the assorted Weasleys and Fleur sitting around the table.
, Draco told himself, listening to Harry’s footsteps falter for a second before he got into his bed. It was the first time they’d slept in separate beds
Harry abruptly stopped rambling, as Draco waved his wand and removed the glamours. “Would you please get the bruise salve and dittany from my trunk?”
Harry’s eyes darted around nervously as he was levitated into marble halls. He took in every detail he could, not that there were many — whichever family lived here clearly enjoyed the minimalistic look.
The trio made their way down to the hall. Harry kept his gaze on the floor for the most part - if he didn’t look at the walls, he wouldn’t see Lavender with Greyback, dead students, dead Tonks, dead Remus, dead Death Eaters. The images of the Death Eaters were less depressing and more disturbing, but all death is sad.
“Is Blaise still trying on clothes?” Draco asked, hopeful that the other boy had decided to go to the toilet or something.
First, he was in the basement with Ron, Luna, Dean, Ollivander and Griphook. He spoke into the mirror;
Ron could practically hear her sigh, before she apparated to him. “Ron, that doesn’t matter. This is a memory, remember?”
Blocking out the sounds of screaming, Draco focused on his task, not allowing for any thoughts other than
Sure enough, red eyes met his, and the Dark Lord nodded at him. Severus swiftly made his way to the right, listening intently to the conversation.
He was quite sure it was a shared dream - why else would Harry have gone to the bathroom? - but clearly Harry was avoiding the topic. He probably regretted it. The thought wiped the smile from Draco’s face altogether.
He shook his head and pinched his cheeks, trying to get a little bit of colour into them. He put the mask on his face — it was moulded perfectly to fit his face, which he found slightly disturbing. He quickly turned away from the mirror, preferring not to associate himself with the masked death eater in the mirror. What had his father gotten him into?
wand - the wand lying on the side of the sink - and an echo of pain radiated from the scar, and it had to go.
Lucius looked at Harry as if he was less than dirt on the bottom of his shoe — but then again, he practically was. He hadn’t had a shower in what was likely close to a month, was still bleeding and without the potions would likely be suffering from blood loss, and despite the potions his thigh still looked disgusting, as if it wouldn’t be healing anytime soon. Meaning he was stuck here, just barely alive, but alive nonetheless. If Bellatrix came in, and Harry could get a hold of one of her knives…
, Potter, what were you expecting me to do?”) and started waving his wand in an elaborate celtic knot, murmuring the incantation. Harry noted in a delirious state — he was probably going to faint in a minute — the stark difference in colour between Malfoy’s pale hand and his own coffee–coloured skin, with the words “
his mind back to his body, opening his eyes to everyone crowding around him. After noticing that everyone there knew about them, Harry said “I’ve got some clues about the horcruxes. Not much, but…”
“Mum and Dad…well, the death eaters came, and they were asking for Ron and Hermione. And Mum and Dad…”
His head shifted and those electrifyingly green eyes cracked open, likely seeing right through him. Seeing those made something snap in Draco, and suddenly he was running away, because he couldn’t handle the truth of the dungeon.
Summary: Draco couldn’t stand the sight of the dark mark, and essentially cut it out of his arm before passing out. Harry, upon waking up and finding Draco in the bathroom, used Dittany and essence of Murtlap to heal the wound as best as he could and cleaned up the mess in the bathroom, before passing out with Draco draped across his lap.
The next morning, to Draco’s surprise, Harry asked if it was okay for Hermione and Ron to join them for lunch outside. It was a beautiful - the last dregs of September were still in the atmosphere, crisp leaves on the ground, warm sunshine beating down, but a breeze hinted at the winter to come.
“Look, Hermione,” Molly’s voice took on a harsher tone, the stress she was feeling transparent, “I understand that you’re concerned for Harry — we all are — but we have a lot to do in the next week and a half, and will just have to trust Dumbledore.”
place after a fifth year had tried to ‘remove the stick up his arse’. As if a stinging hex would remedy that. He’d been shifty all lesson, and since he’d been occupied before the lesson he’d ended up having to take up a seat next to Potter, who seemed oddly indifferent. To Draco’s delight or horror, he wasn’t sure.
“We need to stop answering questions with questions.” Draco shook his head. “Yes we’re friends, I just assumed you wouldn’t want to be seen in public together.”
Harry got ready for bed in the bathroom, emerging to closed drapes around Draco’s bed. Sighing, he cast silencing spells and stared blankly at a book he’d pulled from his trunk, wondering why Draco’s eyes weren’t as lit up as before.
“Or you could just get a wig,” Dean said. “They do these big, black ones to go with costumes and stuff.”
Around six-thirty, he went back up to his room, treading quietly so he didn’t wake up Draco. He pulled on his school robes and put everything he needed into his bag, before heading down to the library and pulling a few books about the topic of soulmates.
Voldemort groaned inwardly as he thought about the situation. He, Lord Voldemort, had to ensure that Harry Potter, his sworn enemy, lived, otherwise he’d lose another horcrux. He knew the diary was missing, and had checked on his ring straight after bringing the boy back to the Manor, only to find that it had disappeared and the wards surrounding it were in ruins. He’d have to get the cup out of Bella’s vault soon — he’d gotten
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as Potter’s bright green eyes flew open, wide at the sight of Draco. Suddenly aware of his position — one leg draped over Potter, his nose bare inches from Draco’s — and flew off as quickly as he could.
He was eventually levitated into a dining room, of sorts — there was a long table, chairs and a chandelier, and a huge oil painting of some blonde person. He looked vaguely like Malfoy, but it clearly wasn’t him — for one thing, he wasn’t fifty years old. And his face structure was different. And his eyes were steel–grey, not blue grey.
They dozed for another two hours, getting ready just in time to come across Ron and Hermione on the way to breakfast.
Thankfully, Potter was already there, although he looked terrible. Taking a couple of deep breaths, he examined the bloodshot eyes contrasting with the green irises, the even-more-dishevelled-than-usual hair, the paleness under his caramel skin and the mud on his robes. He looked like he’d been crying then gone outside for a mud bath.
Harry sat up in his bed, almost falling out in his haste to get his wand. He was covered in sweat, his heart was racing, his chest was so tight it hurt and he was breathing heavily.
Draco turned his back on the smouldering daffodils, fast walking to their meeting point. If Draco knew Lucius at all, he knew that he would have grabbed the other two death eaters and ran straight to the manor to tell the Dark Lord about his misdemeanours, but Draco couldn’t just turn up early.
Ron sniggered beside him, covering it with a cough as Harry elbowed him. “Let’s go,“ he said, throwing the redhead a dirty look before practically
The full realisation hit him, and he groaned and turned over so his face was fully pressed into his pillow, as if that would make it go away.
Harry landed on his feet in the entrance hall of Grimmauld Place, the hallway a bit narrow for the three of them. Mrs. Black started her screaming, and Ron and Hermione came thundering down the stairs, wands brandished.
He stopped for a moment at the point where he’d dropped the resurrection stone. He could see a little bump in the leaves where it must be. Resisting the temptation to disturb his parents one last time, he levitated it, and the surrounding leaves so he wouldn’t have to look at it, and forcefully buried it about two metres off the path, before smoothing the earth over the top so there was no evidence.
The corners of Draco’s mouth rose, but he still refused to open his eyes. Harry fidgeted until he realised that Draco was not planning on letting him go, resigning himself to another hour or so in bed. He tucked his head under Draco’s chin, smelling the scent that was
Draco heaved a sigh and rolled his eyes, but didn’t deny it. He just sat on the bed, occasionally stroking Harry’s hair.
Harry looked at Ron. He didn’t look any different than he did in sixth year, before everything. His face was relaxed, probably daydreaming about the food he was going to eat. His posture was terrible, showing he was at ease, and his long legs were stretched out. The only difference was he didn’t try to hide the way his eyes lit up when Hermione walked in the room, and he jumped to his feet saying “Let’s
He grinned like a lunatic as he went through the portrait whole, resulting in knowing smiles from Hermione and Ron. “Just had a good shag, mate?”
Harry was hoping that with a belly of food, and with the image of concerned, grey eyes, he’d get a peaceful night’s sleep.
and setting it hovering above his head, illuminating the pages of the book he’d picked up. Looking at the cover, he realised it was one he’d read before, so he opened it at a random page, reading the same sentence over and over as he listened for the door to open.
Harry stood with his back to the wall, in a vaguely offensive duelling stance - wand out, arm extended, other arm not really doing anything at all. He flinched as he saw bright colours out of the corner of his eye. He was not on the school courtyard, he was not duelling death eaters, it’s just Draco and his friends in a classroom.
“Due to favouritism” Draco cut him off. “This isn’t ground fine enough, and if you knew anything about potions you would know to stir the water and add the egg gradually so that it doesn’t clump and settle at the bottom.”
He leaned back against his headboard, staring at the photo with him on a broomstick, at the life he could have had. A life full of happiness and unconditional love.
“Doesn’t make sense for Dumbledore to have kept everything under wraps — at the very least, if he’d told me that Potter was missing, I could have checked around Malfoy Manor at least three weeks ago. Then again, he was a very secretive old man. He probably had his reasons.”
“As you wish, my Lord. We have the rest of the ingredients, although some of my stocks will be used up, so we just need the blood. I assume you only need one dose?”
. Panicking, Bill blurted “Same as it always is, Perce,” realising his mistake as soon as the words left his mouth.
Voldemort gritted his teeth against the pain, ready for it this time — it felt like his skin was burning, but this was more important. He watched as the boy obsessed over Lucius’ boy — Draco — and tried to convince himself that he loved some red–headed girl. It was a form of occlumency, Voldemort guessed — giving him useless pieces of information to keep the important things hidden. Voldemort tore through the flimsy memories, searching — and here he was with Dumbledore, looking at memories — was that his mother? Never mind that — and here the boy was telling some others — Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger — and the pain was now overwhelming. Voldemort almost pulled out from his mind — but there, in the corner there was a piece of darkness that screamed “home.” Voldemort shot towards it, relishing in the comfort it provided. Then he frowned. Why would one specific part of Potter’s mind be painless, when the rest wasn’t?
Harry was already looking a bit better, after a night’s sleep. Somehow, his hair was a little shinier, and looked a little thicker, and the shadows under his eyes had lessened. He didn’t look
Draco had walked over to Harry’s bed, drawing open the curtains, and his eyes met terrified, green eyes.
Suddenly, he had the vague impression of air rushing against his face as his body was jostled, and then a wave of
“That was my nightmare,” Draco whispered. Whispered because his throat had closed up, and mind was blank with fear.
“Well, this is a big, pure blood house, so there’s probably a brewing room somewhere. Would Malfoy have visited here? I think I saw his mother’s name on the family tree…”
“Yes, it would be on the documents, because we cannot send owls to their houses. I can get them to you by Thursday at the latest.”
On the other hand, this means I’m writing a few more small one shots than usual - most of them can be found on my tumblr, but there are 3 extra ones for fic contests on my instagram :)
“We’ll have to be quick then.” Severus sighed and hazarded a glance at the boy in the cell. His eyes were opened but glazed over, and he didn’t react to them at all. “I could easily levitate him out and up, then we could wake him up at the safe house.”
However, Draco was quite sure he was the only person who had seen Harry’s true self. The fear he’d felt when mentioning the other two thirds of the golden trio...well, they weren’t much of a trio anymore. At breakfast, it had just been the couple, whispering over eggs and toast, laughing with the Gryffindors. Harry hadn’t even been there.
“The Three Broomsticks? Really?” Harry knew Draco hadn’t been out much into the wizarding world, and had noted his discomfort in Honeydukes.
He didn’t know how long he sat there for, but when he finally came back to reality his limbs were stiff, the cold had reached his bones and nothing had come near him. He cast a quick tempus which revealed he’d been sitting there for the best part of ten hours, and the feast had just started. He stiffly stood up, casting drying and warming charms which chased away most of the cold and began the trek back to the castle. He really didn’t want to go to the feast, so he headed down to the kitchens. The elves always made too much food, and he wasn’t bothered about waiting if they needed him to.
Friends. Voldemort had wished for them deeply, at a time, but he saw them for what they were, now; a weakness.
“I’ve never been the one to do them, so no, but they don’t look very difficult, from what I’ve seen — it should only take two days at most to learn how to do them.”
- Harry and Draco ended up with four children. James Sirius Potter-Malfoy (do I really need to provide background information?), Scorpius Severus Potter-Malfoy  (don’t hate me, I personally hate Snape. Lucius didn’t take very well to Draco coming out, and Snape was Draco’s godfather, and Harry doesn’t harbour *that* many hostile feelings so they agreed. I’m not particularly happy about this but at least it’s not Albus Severus. I hate Albus Dumbledore), Lily Narcissa Potter-Malfoy (Narcissa had been much nicer about Draco being gay and had brought Lucius around). Harry didn’t get Draco pregnant for five years, until they got exceptionally drunk and he was pregnant again. Draco was also very irritated because he had to take time off work, and he’d been up for a promotion. The child was born female and named Lyra Aster Potter-Malfoy, but at age 9 she came out as gender fluid and asked to be called Li.
Harry fed Dumbledore the penultimate cup full, not noticing an immediate change in his condition. Harry drew his wand — he didn’t know how long he had until Voldemort appeared, but figured that he may have to hold him off temporarily while Dumbledore recovers.
“I’m looking out for him because he’d been hexed and because you asked, and he carries a better conversation than anyone else in that class anyway. And Harry, I don’t ‘study’ with him outside of lessons!”
Harry shuddered as a wave of pain flew through him. Voldemort must have been weakened, in the graveyard — this pain was worse than anything he’d ever been through, as his skin was peeling off, needles tearing through muscle and his bones must be
“Had enough time in there, I’d expect. Come on, time to make breakfast.” Vernon pulled Harry’s arm, ignoring the gasp from the five-year-old as it pulled open more of the wounds from the belting the night before. “Eggs, bacon and toast, boy. And don’t burn the bacon, it’s Dudley’s birthday!”
The closeness of the trio really made Draco miss the rest of the Slytherins - he hadn’t actually owled them, but he resolved to.
“Those ones over there are the Lestrange vaults, and these ones are the Black ones. If we work together, it would only take a few hours.”
“What’s up, Mal-Draco?” Granger had a forced smile on her face, but Draco couldn’t see any hostility behind it.
“So we don’t have anything to worry about?” Hermione asked. Harry had gone back to staring at his core, which was gently fading, disappearing before Severus finished speaking.
After a significant amount of time — he had five slices of bread on his plate, but was also quite sure they’d stopped coming - a different magic brushed against his skin. Curious, he turned over, to see red eyes staring down at him.
He had to go to the library, look up why the bond had remained at the very least. Draco doubted Potter would appreciate Draco knowing about his emotions, and Draco certainly didn’t want Potter knowing about his.
Draco gasped dramatically, raising a hand to his forehead. “As if I would ever! What kind of cold hearted bastard would dare entrance the precious Saviour!”
“How are we doing down here, Potter? Cozy?” Voldemort laughed. He’d always hated his laugh — it was too high pitched — but he revelled in the shiver that travelled down the boy’s spine.
Draco startled as Voldemort swept into the room, a book clutched in his right hand. Catching himself, he bowed deeply, a whisper of robes to his right telling him that Severus had done the same.
Harry looked over his shoulder a couple of times, as if to check if Draco was still there, before striding into the common room, Draco following three steps behind.
” Pansy said pointing to a jug about two feet away. “And I thought the pining prat over here was the over dramatic drama queen.” She nudged Draco, who had zoned out while staring at Potter. Again.
Flitwick, precariously balanced on top of a stack of books (Draco was sure it got higher every year) announced that they’d be working on the mind bonding charms again, with ‘the same partners that they had the lesson before’ (he dropped a significant look at Draco and Harry with that announcement).
The fat man grabbed the skinny boy’s arm, revealing familiar black hair and bright green, terrified eyes. Draco took a step back, an uncomfortable twisting in his gut.
I have more mocks so I’m probably not going to release the next chapter(s) until Christmas :( updates will be on my instagram (@huffinglepuff) and you can also message me on my tumblr if you want (also @huffinglepuff) :)
Harry grabbed his arm as he started to get up from his chair. “Just do it. You’ve always been good at magic, and…” Harry hesitated, but Draco’s worried face strengthened his resolve. He was surprised to believe it as he said, “I trust you.”
Harry proceeded to get ready with a huge smile on his face, which was quickly wiped off when he saw the weather.
Harry continued to grind up the egg while Draco cut up the horseradish, then moved it all to one side and started on the murtlap.
Hermione hummed and sat down, rereading the message. “It doesn’t seem like him. The entire message is oddly formal, but then he put Dumbledore instead of Professor Dumbledore.”
Rubbing his arm — apparently she’d elbowed harder than Draco had noticed — he sighed and said, “I guess I forgive you too. The apology was very much appreciated though.” He turned around and opened a cupboard, pulling out a bag of flour.
He looked up at Malfoy - maybe he’d help, since he’d helped in the bathroom? But his face was oddly slack, his eyes unfocused. He raised his wand at Harry, but his arm shook, in the same way that it did that night on the tower.
Remus lost himself in the work — he had so many things to do, it was easy — anything to avoid thinking about his grief. About Molly and Arthur. His friends. His family.
Hermione huffed lightly as the blonde turned and went up the stairs, his steps falling a little heavier than they needed to. She turned to Ron. “Library?”
“Which is bad because…?” Hermione glared at Ron over the top of Harry’s head. She wasn’t that much taller than him, barely two inches, but it was enough that on her toes she could easily see over the top of his head. Ron, of course, was well over six foot at this point.
At meals, having gotten bored of their room (or rather, Draco had gotten fed up of lugging heavy baskets up six flights of stairs) they often went out onto the grounds, at the side of the lake or a healthy distance from the whomping willow. A couple of times they went to the courtyard, but there were an unusually large number of students present there. It wasn’t a huge issue, as the pair were generally enjoying the unusually warm September weather, often dozing under the sun while lying on the lush grass. Draco often complained about crumpled robes or grass stains, but Harry saw the grins he tried to hide.
He nodded to Hermione, indicating that she ask Kreacher. “Kreacher, please tell us about Regulus’ death.”
Draco took another sip of tea, shifting the robes on his lap slightly as he tuned out the conversations around him, his world narrowing to that single messy head at the Gryffindor table.
but they knew their spells, and could be in charge of punishment as well. If he got Umbridge to give them more power, they could keep the other teachers in check as well. He’d let them decide which subjects they wanted to take — Dark Arts or…
Draco anxiously ran a hand through his hair. The death eaters were supposed to be here by now - they said two in the morning, and now it was five past. He didn’t
“I don’t really understand them…” Ron glanced at the page of numbers and runes, if anything to escape Hermione’s glare for a couple of seconds.
After two and a half hours Draco felt a spike of panic, which caused him to bolt upright, before hearing Harry’s voice;
Hermione, despite how suspicious she’d been of Harry and Draco these past few weeks, hadn’t been particularly concerned. While in public, the pair had quite clearly been a couple - granted, there hadn’t been any PDA, which would have been the main deal, but Harry had always been a very private person and likely didn’t want anything in the press - they wouldn’t print anything without proof, thanks to a couple of strongly worded letters from herself.
Draco looked at the box again. He wasn’t ignorant, he knew what plastic was - and the translucent material did seem ideal for holding food. Muggles were surprisingly innovative without magic, Draco found.
“I just wanted to make sure that I was doing the right spell,” Remus offered as an explanation, but Severus didn’t miss the way his voice quavered slightly.
Dinner had been fine. He hadn’t spent long there, he’d wolfed down his meal and started to walk to the common room. But halfway there, he’d been overcome, almost knocked to his knees, by what had hit him. He’d stumbled and scanned the room, looking for someone who had hit him with some new hex, but he was alone. He’d stumbled to a toilet and locked himself in a stall, leaning against the door, letting the grief wash over him in waves. He had never felt anything like this before.
Harry had no idea either. Thankfully he didn’t have to muddle his way through an explanation, as Kreacher brought a small basket that probably had an extension charm, saying “Kreacher hopes it is enough, he knows how much Master enjoys his food.” He smirked again.
“Which spell?” Harry asked, regretting it immediately as Draco stiffened, and sat upright, carefully smoothing his previously creased brow.
He was also lucky in that Potter didn’t take arithmancy or ancient runes, which Draco took for the challenge more than anything else, and didn’t come as naturally to him.
.” A little glass tube came zooming out of the bag, and Hermione peered at it, before shrugging and saying “Good enough. Do you know how to remove memories, Harry?”
was in the Chamber. The killing curse would work on living things, but not the objects, and even if they
“Then I’ll do it myself.” Draco braced himself for Voldemort to raise his wand, readying himself to jump in front of the curse - but it never came.
He’d have to learn to hide his emotions at all times - nobody needed to be worrying about him. Even if he and Draco were no longer nemeses, that was all the more reason to hide them - he didn’t want anyone he cared about running after him all the time, worrying about whether he’s eaten or how he’s feeling. He’s fine.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at Ron, but cast a couple of detection spells over the parchment before delicately folding it and placing it back in the envelope.
Ron peered into the basin again, seeing that the potion was pretty much drained, a few drops lingering just beneath the object. At a closer glance, it was clear to see that the flash of silver he’d seen before was from a locket. The chain was heavily tarnished and the locket engraved with a large, green
“To be fair, the hat only had since the Battle to write this one instead of the whole year.” Hermione chided.
Draco held on tight to Harry, not letting go as he fell asleep again with his face buried in Harry’s hair.
“So how do we get into the ministry…” Bill trailed off, and silence hung around the table before Hermione spoke.
, of all people, to be at the door, crammed into the narrow corridor, with Harry — only identifiable by his glasses and distinctively green eyes — draped between them. He grinned, lifting his head even as a nasty cut across his collarbones split open, and slurred a greeting before collapsing, leaving the two death eaters to catch him.
kills him, of course; but something tells me there’s a reason he’s keeping Potter alive.” His voice was laced with sarcasm, and Draco was surprised Severus wasn’t making much of an effort to be quiet; then again, he probably knew that Draco had been awake since the door opened. He
He followed Granger and the Weasel out of the common room - the redhead was whining about food, while Granger fondly shook her head. At least, if he was following them, he wouldn’t have to worry about people noticing the door opening randomly.
And then Harry was on his knees in the unforgiving ground outside, because “nasty little freaks don’t deserve to kneel in the grass”, biting through his lip even after he tasted blood as Vernon’s belt landed again, and again, and again…
She looked on in satisfaction as death eater after death eater was put under the cruciatus. Karma, for trying to hurt her son.
He apparated to the gates of Hogwarts, dispelling the wards with a flick of his wand. He had little use for them, now.
, but it was better than just staring at the wall. He skimmed the text, not really absorbing the information.
“There are room assignments on the wall - we’re in that corner of the school with all the empty classrooms, they’ve been converted into dorm rooms. We’ll come with you, we haven’t dropped off ours yet.” Hermione said. Harry was immensely glad -  he really didn’t want to go roaming around the castle alone.
Draco cleared his mind, before reaching inwardly. He’d always seen his mind as a sort of island, with an ocean surrounding it as a defence. It was as tidy as ever, but there was a rope - it was glowing, for whatever reason - stretching out across a glittering, green ocean. He followed it, and it went into…
new passages, all leading to the seventh floor. She’d agreed to spread the word to the rest of the portraits to let any kids running from someone know about them, and Ginny told all of the Gryffindors, with Neville by her side, about the plan. Most of them would still have to go to lessons, and the teachers would protect them as best as they could, but if too many people skipped defence and muggle studies it would likely result in teachers being fired. However, if they could all spread the word to the other houses, that would be good, because everyone needed to stick together.
Draco jumped as he heard a cold voice in his ear, one that sent a chill down to his very bones. “Kill him,” said Voldemort.
He walked to the dining room, clipping his heels on the floor as he went. No reason to sneak in, considering that since Lucius had fucked up Snape was now the Dark Lord’s prized possession.
.” The Dark Lord’s voice was soft, coldly calm, as he directed the unforgivable towards Narcissa’s husband.
do. We need a silver one, preferably untarnished, though it won’t affect it much if it has a bit of tarnish.”
Draco continued grumbling all the way into the bathroom, and was still grumbling when he got out. Harry moved to go into the bathroom, but stopped when he noticed that Draco’s head was tilted slightly, and was watching Harry with unnatural stillness.
each from the Carrows, rather than the several ‘cast’ on them by the Slytherins. Crabbe seemed to have been genuinely trying his best, but hadn’t been a very good spell caster, fortunately.
, Draco realised, registering the still hand buried in his hair and the soft breaths sounding above him. He opened his eyes, seeing through his blurry vision a spotless bathroom. He hoped, for a second, that last night had been a dream, except why would he be asleep in the bathroom, on Harry’s lap, with his arm in a bowl of bloody liquid?
crush, and didn’t worry about being around his Gryffindor friends any more because Draco was there to effectively save him from the horror of social interaction. Harry was even beginning to think that he might comfortably survive his eighth year.
“It occurs to me that—” Draco took a dry swallow, as Ron and Hermione turned around. Why did silence stares have to be so heavy? “It occurs to me that I haven’t apologised. To either of you. So this is me doing…that.”
He was in a cavern, or sorts, roughly hewn into a cliff face with weirdly dark sand covering the rock. Hermione was to his left, and he sighed in relief.
Kreacher muttered something under his breath, and turned hateful eyes on Hermione. She glanced to the side, but Ron still seemed breathless, so she was on her own.
“He’s drinking this really dodgy potion. Harry said that we need to see what’s in that basin, remember?”
Draco asked him if he was getting up, after changing (Harry assumed - he still hadn’t turned over), and Harry just grunted, not moving.
At eight o’clock exactly, Draco went down to the dining room, not at all surprised to see the Dark Lord holding court.
“Potter, that is a terrible saying. What if you’re on a stealth mission? Or trying to navigate a very delicate situation?”
Harry didn’t quite know what Bellatrix was doing to his body, and he didn’t really care. It was clear that he wasn’t getting out — if Ron and Hermione had gotten the hints that something was wrong, they would have arrived by now. Which meant he was here forever, and Voldemort would never die.
, he realised he had five minutes to get to lesson and put the books back on their shelves, before hurrying to defence.
and grasped onto it with two hands, digging his fingers in — how did he have fingers here? — so as to not get whipped away by the furiously swirling thoughts.
“Something less morbid?” Pansy pleaded - she wasn’t one for anything gory, preferring nails, makeup, hair and herbology, which usually rendered the first three pointless.
“My Lord, according to my son the Granger girl is a mudblood in his year, and the Weasley boy is likely a blood traitor along with the rest of his family.”
Harry wasn’t feeling very good about this. Granted, he and Malfoy were ‘soulmates’, apparently, but that meant Malfoy knew when Harry was having one of his episodes. He didn’t even tell Ron and Hermione about those - he certainly didn’t want Malfoy, who harboured no positive feelings towards Harry, knowing. What if he went to the press? Or an adult? Harry didn’t want anyone to help him - he should be able to help himself, and the idea of pity, of people looking at him with ‘understanding’ eyes, trying to tell him what to do...he couldn’t stomach it. Malfoy was giving him a look already, and Harry couldn’t take it.
At this point, Harry heard banging on their door. He jumped in surprise, drawing his wand, before remembering he had two very excitable children. “I don’t think they’re going to give you five more minutes.”
They wolfed down breakfast (or rather, Ron did and then bothered the other three, forcing them to eat faster as well) and went back upstairs to grab money, casting umbrella charms and
wasn’t because the jumper was a lot softer than he’d expect it to be, and clearly had temperature-regulation charms woven in, and smelled of cedar, and smoke, and Harry - that odd mixture of smells he got a whiff of every time Harry leaned over him to get something. He just wanted to bury his face in the fabric, to inhale it and wrap his arms around himself. This really wasn’t proper behaviour for a Malfoy, but anyway.
They appeared a couple of seconds later in a flurry of sand. Severus glanced down and saw little granules at the bottom of his robes, so he cast a quick
She would have liked to see them one more time, but as a muggleborn was simply putting them at risk. Furthermore, Bill and Fleur’s wedding was two weeks after term ended, two days after Harry’s birthday. She frowned — she still was uneasy about that letter. She’d debated sending a reply, but eventually decided on not, since it may endanger Harry and Dumbledore’s location.
“Do you mind if we can go sleep somewhere? Not that Draco would admit it, but he’s dead on his feet.”
“Fine, I’ll make waffles,” cheers from the two boys, “but only one each. We’re going to the Weasley’s for lunch.”
After a while, Kreacher sat up, looking like a mess, with mucus everywhere and large, bloodshot eyes. “Kreacher, do you still have the locket? We want to help fulfill your Master Regulus’ dying wish.”
“Potter, are you going to be cooperative today?” Lucius sneered down at him from the other side of the bars.
Therefore, she was very much awake when her husband abruptly stormed out of the room, and when the rest of the death eaters started charging down the corridors. She followed slowly, putting on slippers and a robe before padding down the corridors.
“Of course I don’t, you know the Dark Lord operates on a need–to–know basis. Otherwise we would know what that massive operation was a week ago.”
Harry didn’t sleep, just listened to Draco’s rhythmic breathing and stared at the wall with glassy eyes. When Draco woke up, gently tugging his arm out from underneath Harry, he didn’t move, not to sit up nor to cling to Draco like he wanted. He lay, staring at the wall, not really listening to what Draco said. He didn’t feel anything, except that he wasn’t leaving his bed. He didn’t want to go outside, he didn’t want to talk to anyone, he didn’t want to eat.
“Yes, of course, sorry for keeping you up so long,” Hermione started to shoo out the rest of the boys, levitating her piles of parchment out of the door.
“So I’m staying behind, right? Since I need to be near Harry?” Draco asked. He didn’t know how he felt, but an unconscious Potter was preferable to the Weaselette.
Remus to act with hostility — they’d been perfectly civil when they’d both been teaching, even if Remus had probably suspected that Severus had leaked his being a werewolf (he hadn’t — it had been nice to have someone his age to talk to in the staff room, and he would never stoop so low anyway,) but Severus still found himself checking his expression, making sure it was neutral, as the door opened.
Breathing a sigh of relief as a couple of aurors left on the third floor, she transformed into Umbridge, transfiguring her plain, grey suit into a pink skirt and jumper, with a long, pink cloak to go with it. Using a little compact mirror with a photo of Umbridge’s face stuck into one side, she checked that her face was perfect, before straightening her shoulders and leaving the lift.
“Yes.” The first word Malfoy said since coming into the house was laced with defiance, his stance shifting into something slightly more hostile, even as most of his weight was still on Snape.
Draco frowned. “Her allegiance is to her family, although I’m not sure whether or not she considers Lucius family anymore. I’d be surprised if she’s left — for now, she’s safe in there as long as she acts the part — but she may eventually leave. If we encounter her alone, she might be willing to join our side, if only to follow me.”
Harry nodded, wiping away a tear that had started to run down his cheek. “And he asked me — he asked me to tell you that he loves you.”
would. Malfoy was his nemesis, a boy who was nothing but sneers and mean comments. Draco wouldn’t tell anyone. Not Draco who was crying on Harry’s shoulder, not Draco who had sat with Harry for half an hour, until he calmed down.
“Are you sure its supposed to look like that?” The area where Voldemort’s nose should be wrinkles as he looked at the potion with disdain.
Ron shook his head. “Elf magic works differently — they can get in and out of apparation wards by apparating. Only very, very ancient wards can prevent them — back from the old days, when elves were still considered powerful beings. Then they put in laws and binding spells, and elves were all but forgotten, as were the old spells. The binding spells prevented elves from actually harming wizards, so they were dismissed as a threat and were generally forgotten when new spells were developed. The new spells…they’re easier to do, but not as effective against magical creatures.”
good passage,” Severus muttered, just as Millicent grinned and stepped aside to reveal a roughly hewn staircase.
She smiled at him, ignoring Weasel’s grumbling as she linked arms with him and headed for the Gryffindor tower.
But no, his bed was hard and lumpy, the walls were much closer to him, and Harry scrambled backwards until his back hit the wall as the many locks on his cupboard door opened.
Satisfied that he had his answer, and less satisfied that the boy was a horcrux, Voldemort pulled out of the boy’s mind.
secret mission?” Ron asked, in an appalling Scottish accent that strongly resembled Professor McGonagall.
Harry prayed for someone, anyone, to come help him - a nosy neighbour looking over the fence, a sudden visitor - but no one came, no one ever did, it was just him and Vernon and pain…
Potter started whimpering and shaking as something happened, muttering something about getting past something. Draco had no idea what was going on, but knew that he had to get Potter out of that dream.
“I think we all know what - or who - Draco’s cup of tea is.” Millie looked at Draco. “So Draco isn’t going into a club unless he’s following a certain green-eyed boy.”
By November, the teachers had either joined them in the room, which had expanded to three times the size of the Great Hall with individual rooms for the year groups, or left to try and get help. As much as they asked for it, the Room couldn’t provide a passage beyond the boundaries of the school, so everyone had to wait it out until the Hogwarts Express arrived at Hogsmeade station. The fifth, sixth and seventh years of all the houses had worked together to get everyone’s belongings out of the dorm, and the elves knew to bring three meals a day to the Room. McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick and Vector taught duelling during the day, and the entire student population were very adept at disillusionment charms.
There was a spider in the corner in his room, he noticed. Perfect. He brought up all those feelings of hatred - towards his father, for forcing him into this. Towards the Dark Lord, for being a racist idiot. Towards the spider, for scaring the living crap out of him every time he saw it out of the corner of his eye.
He walked into the common room to see Theo, who had always been an early riser, but refused to talk before having his first cup of coffee - a habit he had picked up in sixth year after someone asked the elves to start supplying the breakfast tables with the stuff in the mornings. He wasn’t going to Hogsmeade, as he had become disenchanted with the village after one outing and did all of his shopping using catalogues and owl order (Draco assumed - he’d never seen Theo doing any of this but he always had Christmas presents for his friends and
“Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on?” Harry was fed up of Malfoy and Flitwick having some coded conversation between themselves.
“Yes you are.” Ron tried to drag Harry off the bed, but a spark caused Ron to quickly retract his hand. Harry smirked triumphantly, before lying facedown on the bed.
- to Megan, Becky, Madi and Alexa, for reading this crap before it’s been edited, correcting typos and providing feedback and encouragement every step of the way - I love you guys as well.
“To be fair, he ran the DA” Seamus replied. Harry just shrugged. He’d never really been able to duel like that - maybe it was the bond?
. No sooner had Harry read that out loud than Draco had snatched the letter from Harry’s hands, running the risk of being singed by the magic for any news of his mother. After being assured that she was safe, he sheepishly handed the letter back to Harry, who was looking murderous, if slightly pale after the burst of magic. He almost went to Malfoy Manor to check that Ginny wasn’t still being held there — Ginny could have been forced to write the letter like he had — but Draco pointed out that there was no way that Ginny could know about the safehouse and its location unless she was actually there. They quickly fired off letters to the rest of the Weasleys, who hadn’t been in Grimmauld but who’s letters had been full of anxiety and questions, updating them of events. Harry asked Kreacher to take the letter to Hogwarts, so everyone there wouldn’t need to worry.
“Just because the most action you get from anyone who isn’t your right hand is a hex in the corridors.”
Shaking himself out of his stupor, Weasley also stuck out his hand, and said “Same sentiment. Call me Ron.”
Hermione had clearly been listening, but Ron saw that she still found it difficult to tear her gaze away from Harry. Ron wasn’t surprised — he’d expected him to look bad, but he was covered in dried blood, his clothes were dirty and torn, his hair was limp and greasy and his face was hollow. His clothes were even baggier than normal, hanging limply off his skinny frame, and Ron shuddered to think of what damage had been done underneath.
Blaise ended up taking thirty-seven minutes, and was immediately punched by Pansy for wasting her money on
Hermione rolled her eyes and tapped him on the shoulder. “Do you have the location, Ron? Because Draco needs to see it so he knows where to go if anything goes wrong.”
Bright light blinded Harry as Draco removed the spell keeping the cloth bound around Harry’s eyes. It took him a couple of moments before he realised where he was; Godric’s Hollow.
at him, and reopened the two matching cuts on his cheeks — Bellatrix really had gone all out. In fact, now that he knew the boy wouldn’t die, she could go back down and let off some steam. Fenrir too.
They ended up just outside the cave containing the lake where the locket had been stored. Harry had suggested it, weeks ago — it seemed fitting to end the horcruxes where one had been stored. Not to mention, there were no people for miles.
at Kreacher, causing his wooden spoon to go flying out of his hand. He’d also incinerated most of the curtains in the house - not that this was a huge loss, they were ugly and moth eaten and dispelled dust in unnerving shapes every time they had been moved.
He ducked into a nearby alley and apparated again — to Nottingham, then Northampton. His magic was in shreds, barely holding on, but he made the final jump, straight into the kitchen of Grimmauld place. He knew that he was completely worn out, but he was too stressed to sleep, so he made a cup of tea and tried to collect his thoughts. The familiar motions calmed him — boiling the water, leaving the tea bag to steep, adding milk and half a teaspoon of sugar to sooth the sharp bitterness. He took a sip, breathing deeply, before frowning — there were voices coming from outside.
The Dark Lord nodded his dismissal. Draco fled out of the room, as calmly as he could, walking directly to the bathroom and putting up a strong silencing charm before throwing up into the toilet.
Ron told the others about Grimmauld Place, and they keyed the floo networks together so that they’d be able to floo back and forth easily. Since both places had floo networks that used to be connected to the main network, it wasn’t difficult to make an exclusive connection between the two houses.
“The Aurors would never attack a member of the archives. Do you have a way out? That—” he shot a spell that froze them in ice, which immediately started to melt under the temperature regulation charms of the Ministry, “—won’t hold them for long.”
Malfoy — Draco — rolled his eyes. “Alright, I’ll go get my books. They’re all in the room with Pot—” he caught Hermione glaring at him, “Harry. In the room with Harry.”
Fleur’s parents arrived two days later, listening to their daughter’s story in rapid fire french and consoling her. The presence of her parents rejuvenated Fleur, who cleaned the house like a demon. This in turn made the other inhabitants guiltily help out, the wedding preparations coming along surprisingly well.
They spent an hour combing through the archives, shrinking any documents that seemed vaguely useful and shoving them into bags. As they finished, an alarm was raised, the ear–splitting sound echoing around the room.
Sitting there, grinning like a loon at Draco while stuffing half a sausage in his mouth, Harry felt...free. To be himself.
He headed up to the Great Hall for lunch - Pansy said she’d be there, so he couldn’t skip. He stuck to the sides, but he stuck out like a sore thumb - none of the older years were out yet, and his shade of hair was particularly distinctive. There were the usual whispers, but nothing that he couldn’t ignore. Not until a distinct pain in his side - a stinging hex, followed by a tripping jinx. Draco rolled his eyes, but wasn’t given an opportunity to draw his wand for defence as he was struck by a
Harry was already sprinting, but so were the Carrows. Harry blasted the walls of lost objects, trying to cut them off, but they were gaining, and the reckless expense of magic was costing him more than it should. He grabbed onto a table leg and swung himself around a sharp corner, his mind racing;
“Budge over,” Harry said, walking over and sitting in the space James left on the side, popping Scorpius between his legs.
Draco rolled his eyes and walked over to the book, looking over it properly. It didn’t look particularly difficult to brew, similar to the healing potions they were brewing before, but illegal due to the blood magic involved. Draco wondered if Voldemort knew that he was tying someone else’s life to his own with this potion.
“Hermione? What — what’s happened?” His gaze flicked around the group — all the adults were standing, but Draco—
Hermione presented the knuts that she’d perfected — every member present (except Mundungus, who everyone agreed couldn’t be trusted not to sell it) got one, and they turned silver while remaining the size of a knut under the touch of each person they were keyed to, so that they knew which one to not spend. Since they were so small, Hermione also presented small bands under disillusionment charms that could be resized to be placed anywhere on their arms or legs, with a small pocket to place the knut in. The date would appear on the serial numbers, and then everyone could reply “yes” or “no” to whether or not they were coming, at which point all of the replies were logged in a book in Grimmauld Place. It had been surprisingly difficult magic, but it would do, for now. She and the twins were still working on the notebooks — so far, they had managed a link between two notebooks, but were struggling on adding a third, and making the notebooks bigger on the inside so they wouldn’t run out of pages within three days. They’d agreed that if they didn’t succeed by the end of summer, they’d send one with Ginny, to keep them updated on Hogwarts.
I’ve got the spell down,” Draco mumbled under his breath, his fingers tracing a delicate pattern on the parchment as his grey eyes scanned the pages, oblivious to Harry watching him from the other side of the bed.
He thanked the elves before leaving - they didn’t bring him anything and instead watched him part with knowing smiles.
“You think I don’t know that? This is what the muggles wear to go clubbing.” Pansy did a little twirl, the low cut back revealing her lack of a bra. “I think I’ll wear it to go clubbing, and you’re coming with me. There is ridiculously loud music and there are ones just for gay men - exactly your cup of tea.”
“Hermione’s terrifying guys. She’s gonna terrify her way to the top of the Ministry.” Ron shook his head, eyes wide...
He didn’t get much before a pair of red eyes were looking at him, rippling around the edges with a hot, burning fire.
did he freeze? He’d just figured out that he liked Draco, and now he’s scared him away for good. He walked the route to the Slytherin common room under his invisibility cloak, but unless Draco casts one hell of a disillusionment charm he must have ran all the way down.
At the beginning of the last week of term, Hermione had sent her parents an owl telling them to go into hiding, having magically enlarged her trunk to bring almost everything she owned to Hogwarts so she could go straight to the Burrow at the end of term. Hermione was quite sure that they were going somewhere in Europe, although she hoped they would go further. As they were both sensible and dentists with a hefty salary, they had more than enough money to move to another country, and good qualifications to get jobs.
Ron had paled at the mention of his family. Hermione looked at him, and then back to Malfoy. “Ron’s parents…well—” She bit her lip and glanced at Ron, not wanting to reveal something so personal for him.
Bill tried his best to paste a bland smile on his face. “I found a discrepancy in a file, and felt it was important enough to bring to the top.”
“Harry…” Draco almost whispered. Harry didn’t notice the water trickling down his face, or his robes steadily getting damper. He watched a drop of water travel from beside Draco’s eyes into the corner of his mouth, which was slightly parted. He dragged his gaze back up to Draco’s eyes, which flickered down to Harry’s lips in return.
Hermione nervously shifted from side to side. “Well, this is just a theory, but when Harry first came into contact with you, his core was probably incredibly damaged — if he hadn’t had the blood potion from Voldemort, he’d be dead. You two obviously have compatible magic, as you were able to successfully complete the Anamchara ritual, but if two people’s magics are extremely compatible, a ritual like that can result in a…” Hermione’s voice trailed off, and Ron nudged her. “A permanent bond between your cores.”
, Harry replied, as he was still dragging him along. Thankfully, Draco started walking properly, practically gliding to the table. He slid into the seat between Harry and Luna, who had joined Ginny.
“I wanted to do a muggle degree in art, but I’m not sure how to get in with wizarding qualifications” Dean looked contemplative rather than down heartened at the obstacle.
Harry’s mind was, in fact, a forest, with a gently winding river leading in. There were no hedges like before - Draco would have to teach Harry to keep his mind guarded at all times.
had done — terrible things. He cringed internally at the sheer number of insults he could remember hurling at Ron and Hermione, mostly for their connection to Harry, making fun of things they couldn’t control — Ron’s family’s wealth, Hermione’s teeth (oh dear Merlin, that
Severus huffed softly, and they sat in silence for a few moments. Draco considered stretching his hands towards the fire as well — it was awfully draughty in the manor — but Severus spoke. “On an unrelated note, most of the death eaters are going on a raid to do...
Severus made a non commital sound, before setting up the ingredients for the potion. They worked in silent harmony, used to the motions at this point. The potion bubbled a dark red as the blood was added, before they turned down the heat to let the potion simmer for a twelve hours.
“It doesn’t look like its time–consuming, just physically taxing, so tomorrow evening at the latest.”
Resigned to his situation for the while, Harry curled up on the cold floor, shivering from either the
In fact, Potter had seemed different all day. Ignoring the glamours, he’d barely been part of the conversations at the Gryffindor table at breakfast, he’d looked close to nodding off in defence when studying
Draco took the mask that was held out — it was truly beautiful, even if it’s purpose was disgusting. Dragons were melded into the sides, breathing plumes of fire around Draco’s temples, which led into swirls across the face.
“Bit late to be asking that, isn’t it Potter.” Draco raised one eyebrow, refusing to let his face betray even one of the many emotions swirling inside. (Instead, he gathered them up, popped them in a box, sat on said box, and wrapped it in thick, heavy chains.)
Stammering and stuttering, they told the story. How they’d seen a tapestry flapping back and forth, as if someone had gone through it. Slipping through the doors in the wall just before they’d shut. Almost having Potter in their grasp — only to be outsmarted by two
“Harry, are you alright mate? You haven’t been in dinner, or breakfast, or lunch…” the Weasel looked at Potter with guilty eyes.
“He’d better not, I am not dealing with Ron’s bullshit. He’ll think you’ve engineered it for your own benefit or some shit.”
Not seeing any reason to beat around the bush, Draco took a deep breath, “Does Potter like me…romantically?”
“I just don’t understand. The war is over. There is no need for prejudices anymore. What is wrong with people and why can’t they just let. It. Go.”
Sn — Severus — that was going to take some getting used to — rolled his eyes. “The bond is glowing slightly, meaning it’s active. You’re probably providing small quantities of magic to Harry’s core, so it will heal faster. You shouldn’t be feeling a drain, though, since it’s not that bright.”
It felt like an eternity had passed by the time it was over, though Ron knew the spell only lasted around five minutes. Hermione collapsed as soon as she finished chanting, but Ron caught her easily even as his muscles shook with exhaustion and his legs threatened to give way.
With every visitor, the magic needled against his skin, going deeper each time, the pain increasing. He retreated further into his mind, not quite sure what was real.
“Why did you have to knock over MY pumpkin juice? It was the first glass out of the jug, which is now empty.” Blaise glared at his glass, and then Draco, while holding an empty jug to his face.
He’d never had to rectify a relationship with someone before — not to this extent, in any case. He’d been prepared to do some serious grovelling when he’d gotten back with Harry, but after Hermione’s grateful reception he’d become complacent. He’d never had to fix relationships with anyone in the Slytherin house — they often went crawling back to him, full of apologies—
After a hasty breakfast, the group headed down to Hogsmeade, minus Theo. Everyone had plans - Pansy had a friend at Gladrags who always held down the latest clothes in her size, Blaise wanted some new clothes since his last ‘conquest’ had torn...something. Draco hadn’t been paying attention. Millie wanted to go to Dervish and Banges for - something…this Potter obsession was really keeping him out of the loop. Draco didn’t want anything in particular, just to be outside maybe do some early Christmas shopping.
“Why are you asking?” Weasley’s tone was definitely irritated at the start, but it jumped up in pitch as Granger stamped on his foot again. Draco’s respect for the girl was growing with each passing moment.
Harry smiled. Draco had noticeably relaxed now, engaging in conversation with Dean about nothing in particular. Seamus eyed Draco up, clinging obviously onto Dean’s arm, but Harry noticed that it was more to do with romantic jealousy than prejudice against the Slytherin.
Harry smiled softly at the way Draco’s eyes glimmered with delight at the shining cauldron Harry had brought. “Who did you have to fight to get that?”
A thought suddenly occurred to Remus. The archives would show all muggleborns that had already attended Hogwarts, but what about those who should be going this year? “Professor McGonagall—”
He heard the door open behind him and closed his eyes, keeping his breathing even, resisting the urge to turn over. To stand up and take those short steps to Harry. To kiss Harry senseless and run his hands through his hair, to see if it was as thick and soft as it had been in the dream.
Suddenly feeling exhausted, Harry sat back against the wall, gently threading his fingers through Draco’s soft hair, murmuring whatever came to mind under his breath.
Harry turned to look at Draco, who shrugged in turn. They didn’t even need words to communicate at this point.
Ron yelled, and Ginny immediately came sprinting out, several metres of snake close behind. She shot a couple of spells behind, which enraged the snake, but its several bleeding wounds did not seem to hinder its movement much, if at all.
Hermione patted her arm. “If it gets too crowded here, we have space in our place as well — it’s the old Black house, so there’s something like ten bedrooms, and they’ve all been cleared out, even if they could use a bit of a clean.”
He continued walking until he’d reached the trees where Hagrid had been chained. He put up some wards and protective enchantments and removed his cloak, before sinking to the ground, his back against cold, hard, bark, and finally let his tears fall.
. Harry concentrated on his physical body, the cold tiles beneath his hands. “I was just leaving. Bye!”
Hermione had been watching her watch, and suddenly stood up, startling Ron, who’s been dozing on the sofa next to her. “It’s been twenty–four hours. I’m going to McGonagall.”
“I bet ten galleons that Blaise will be another fifteen minutes” Pansy said, checking her purse for funds.
Harry declined his offer, going into the bathroom with some pyjamas he’d picked off his bed. Draco sighed, waving his wand to get rid of the light before putting the book on the side, not bothering to mark his page, closing the drapes and lying down, staring at the canopy over his bed.
“Ginny, Luna, Dean, Seamus, Hannah, and Millicent. And it’s rude to interrupt, darling.” Draco sighed and slumped in his chair. Narcissa shot a disapproving look at him, before continuing. “We’ve all been hiding out there. That was, until I felt a tug on one of the wards the Dark Lord had set. That was another thing I’d done before I’d left — left undetectable strands of magic on all of his alert systems so I’d know when they were triggered. I apparated to Godric’s hollow just before the wards went down, and spent some time rigging the apparation points. You two would have been completely overwhelmed otherwise.”
“Sure.” Harry smiled until Hermione’s face left the fireplace, then slumped back in his chair and waved his wand to remove the glamours. He went upstairs to lie on his bed and do nothing for a few hours.
“You think you can get my son to open the doors, don’t you? Well you can dismiss that idea — I have no intention of him getting anywhere near here.” Lucius spat at Harry’s feet, for good measure.
Harry grinned in satisfaction, eating his daily slice of bread. Hopefully, he’d be dead within two weeks.
Ron hummed in agreement, flinching as Voldemort snapped Harry’s wand, before flicking his wand and restraining Harry with black ropes.
Pansy joined Draco and Millie to Dervish and Banges - the two girls were a lot more efficient than Blaise when it came to shopping, as Blaise always wanted to try on ten items for every one he kept. The shop was as interesting as ever, with little dark detectors (that thankfully didn’t hiss and spit at Draco - that had been a bad day for everyone) and odd tools that no one knew how to use. Millie picked up a few of these - for digging up Merlin’s balls, Draco could only assume - before going to the wizened old man behind the till to pay. Draco considered himself lucky that people served him - while he hadn’t been out many times during the summer, Potter’s words at his trial had had more power than he could have ever imagined, and while he wasn’t often given a warm welcome, most places accepted whatever business he brought.
Harry winced and pulled out his wand, watching as Dumbledore swallowed one mouthful of the potion. His beard twitched at the taste, his eyes losing some of their twinkle.
Harry’s was...something different. Draco could see the silhouettes of trees, and a river lazily winding inwards. Harry’s mind must be at the end of the river - indeed, that’s where the rope seemed to go. No wonder Voldemort could have penetrated his mind so easily - it was as simple as following the river.
The four of them had met at the kitchens, neither Ron nor Hermione questioning the fact that they weren’t eating in the hall, likely at Hermione’s orders. Honestly, Draco was terrified of her.
He turned into the circular room, directing an expelliarmus at a snow-white beard. He pointed his wand at Dumbledore, who stood, tall, arrogant, wandless, facing Draco with a knowing twinkle in his eye.
He went deeper, and deeper, following that gentle tug of the wards down dozens of stone stairs. The air was muggy, and repulsive — his very magic shied away from it. Sure that he was going in the right direction, Draco continued his descent.
he’d admitted to maybe, perhaps, having a tiny, little, crush on Draco, but really, there was no reason to make it a big deal because it would probably go away. Ginny had raised an eyebrow before nodding, knowing secretly that it was definitely more than a tiny crush, and honestly those boys had better get together after the war because if she had to put up with their pining for much longer she was likely to put someone’s head through a wall.
Hermione nodded, a bead of sweat running down her forehead. She kept the fire contained to that one corner for another minute, then two — then she exhaled, and the cave was thrust into darkness once more.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “I didn’t know the wizarding world was so accepting of gays. My uncle - he wasn’t the nicest person, but he was a raging homophobic, and there wasn’t much representation of homosexuals in the muggle world, from what I saw. It’s nice to know that the wizarding world got at least one thing right.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m glad to see you too, but if you carry on strangling me I won’t be here for much longer,” Ron grumbled, even as a small smile danced around his mouth.
The group wandered down to Hogsmeade, spending a large amount of time in Zonko’s, by request of Ginny and Seamus, and then Hogsmeade, where Ron bought half of the shop and Harry, Ginny, Seamus and Dean split the other half. Sucking on sparkling sherbets (“They make your eyes sparkle for a few hours, depending on the colour apparently - the closer they are to a precious metal or mineral the longer they sparkle.” Neville had read off the packet), the group then jogged down to The Three Broomsticks with their jackets held over their heads in the drizzle.
This brought on a chorus of laughs. Hannah was talking about her mother’s bakery, and how to add magic to it to make it more efficient, when Harry suddenly tuned out the conversation. The front door had opened to let a group of Slytherins in - at the front, Draco. He was wearing a dark green jumper, grey trousers (that did wonders for his arse, Harry noted when he turned around. Not that he was looking or anything) and polished, black boots. Harry felt slightly shocked - he’d never seen Draco in non-wizarding clothes, and they suited him (even if it was like seeing a hippogriff in a three-piece suit). Harry snapped out of it when those grey eyes turned on him - he hoped he hadn’t looked as gormless as he imagined. That wouldn’t bode well for their friendship.
Still, it could have been a lot worse — he got to do what he loved most, and nobody actively hated him; not even Ron and Ginny, who were quickly warming up to him, even if neither initiated conversations.
was going through this? He had no reason to be - the git had won the war, defeated the Dark Lord, saved them all...but he’d lost, too. First he’d lost his parents, then his godfather, then Dumbledore...and there were casualties on both sides last year.
- it was 4:30 in the morning. He knew he wasn’t going to get back to sleep with the adrenaline coursing through his veins, so he padded down the stairs of Grimmauld Place to make himself a cup of tea.
He spent all of his time in the potions room. Nobody really came up there, and if they did, they had to deal with Severus’ wrath.
Then, they stopped shouting and Draco’s stomach dropped with dread - he was almost sure what was going to happen, his fears confirmed when the fat man dragged Harry over to a bloodstained corner of the otherwise immaculate garden. Harry dropped to his knees in anticipation of what was going to come - and indeed, the fat man was unbuckling his belt. Draco backed away, further into Harry’s vision - he didn’t want to see Harry’s back cut open. He wasn’t squeamish, as such - he thought he might become a healer later in school - but the purposeful harm of a young child was more than he could stomach.
Tremors racking his frame, Harry turned away and let the tears run down his face. At least he wasn’t hungry anymore.
Draco snapped out of his daydream as Slughorn dismissed them - he’d only got away with daydreaming as he had finished his potion early and had already bottled it. He took the bottle to the front of the room first, and left quickly, avoiding eye contact with the rest of the class. He was normally the only person alone on a bench, but was perfectly capable, and Slughorn didn’t want any extra trouble so he didn’t say anything. Draco was used to being ignored anyway.
Draco hurried after the sea of red, craning his neck to keep his eyes on the familiar, bushy hair, next to a very tall redhead.
to not get them fired. They were all questioned about their daily routine, and it was decided that Hestia Jones, Bill and Remus would go down in their place. They acquired a hair from Albert Runcorn easily enough, and Severus decided to go as him, having already perfected the haughty sneer Runcorn so often wore. Kingsley and two of his aurors were going as themselves, and were all going to go down — one more person than they’d originally said, but the more people there were in the archives, the quicker they could get out. They hadn’t been able to get a hair from Umbridge, so Tonks was transforming into her — first, she was going to wear a face that would be easily forgotten, and only transform into Umbridge when she had to go into her office. According to Kingsley, she’d be in the department of mysteries all day, holding trial over several muggleborns.
“Hello, Hermione. Yes, I’m doing well Hermione, how are you? Yes I am going back to school, why are you asking?” Harry was used to Hermione’s usual bluntness, but was in a weird mood.
After a while, Harry’s enthusiasm started flagging, despite them being his closest friends - indeed, it had been three hours. Seeing no indication from the couple that they were going to initiate a break, Draco mentioned something about homework which had Hermione jumping to her feet, because “I’m so sorry that we kept you, Ronald also has to do some homework, don’t you Ron…”
“Professor?” Harry held out his right hand, and Snape rolled his eyes before delicately placing his hand in Harry’s. Harry snorted lightly at the expression on his face, and closed his eyes, concentrating on Number 12, Grimmauld Place.
Voldemort watched Lucius leave, before turning back to the library. There was a little book at the start that told you where each topic of book was — there was a huge section on healing, and a very small section on horcruxes. Voldemort went down to each section and removed a few books, before sitting in a small chair. He briefly considered asking Lucius to bring his chair upstairs, but decided not to since it would probably take the incompetent man a full day.
“For chicken and sweetcorn soup, brought by yours truly, you are. Come on Potter, don’t be pathetic, it’s barely gone nine.”
Harry rolled his eyes in reply, before getting up on unsteady feet and pulling the shimmering material out of his trunk, bundling it up and throwing at Draco. Draco caught it easily and pulled it on, calling out “be back soon” before slipping out of the door.
Finishing his second slice, he looked up to see Harry watching him. “Are you going to stare at me all night?” He barely listened to Harry’s response, noticing how full he was. He held out the plate, telling Harry he was “genuinely not hungry.”
He went down to the common room to stare into the dying embers of the fire for a few hours. He’d really have to start sleeping later - he had far too much spare time in the morning.
Voldemort had been diligently plotting how to lure Potter to Malfoy Manor when he, along with his little friends, had simply
Harry pulled the pillow back, pressing soft kisses to Draco’s neck and jaw. “We both know how much you like bottoming.”
“You can’t even see the shifty little edge bits,” Harry said, running his hands through the glamour, even though you couldn’t tell.
“You two looked like you were enjoying yourself in the bar. Didn’t want to disturb you.” Ron shrugged, and Hermione elbowed him before looking at them sheepishly.
Harry went and had a very long shower, just standing there and letting the warm water hit the back of his neck. He went back to his room at 5:30, taking his time getting dressed. Malfoy was still in bed, asleep.
“You have a house elf?” Draco exclaimed in surprise. Harry had barely nodded before Kreacher was at Draco’s feet,
Harry huffed and pulled Draco closer to his chest, but nodded at Death, because he couldn’t really do anything else, could he? Every second was precious.
to use a pensieve, but nothing could prepare him for the stomach–churning sensation of falling down a hole combined with the fact that his feet were still planted firmly on the bedroom floor.. He closed his eyes against the swirling greens and blacks of the pensieve, opening them when he’d stopped spinning.
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but Draco couldn’t help but feel that the next time he woke up was much more pleasant — at some point, Harry had abandoned his side of the bed, and was curled up in a small ball, pressed into Draco, while Draco had one arm lazily draped over him.
Draco nodded, and Seamus accidentally spat out half a mouthful of eggs. Spluttering, as Dean thumped him on the back, he said “Just? You’ve
“Not at all. Snape tried to teach me, in fifth year, but it didn’t go...well.” Draco felt a wave of guilt pass over him. He was pretty sure it was his own - he hadn’t known about how Severus died until after the Battle, but he knew Voldemort - he shuddered at the name - had killed him because he thought Severus had some power that he wanted. Draco was quite sure it was some power he’d got from Dumbledore - so if Draco had killed Dumbledore like he was supposed to, Severus needn’t have died. Draco had spent a lot of time thinking about it when he’d seen the story, after being released from the ministry cells. However, if the bond had been made correctly, it could also be Potter’s guilt. He
After twenty minutes Harry was quite bored, had finished his food and felt he had an adequate amount of bread and butter, so he announced he was going to turn in for the night. There were a couple of looks of surprise, but they relaxed when he said he was “just catching up on all the sleep I should have got last year.”
He curled into a foetal position on his bed, trembling, whimpering slightly at the headache. It was too close to the aching of his scar for Harry’s liking. “He’s not back, there were no more horcruxes, he’s dead” Harry whispered, a mantra to drive the nightmare away from reality.
Potter stumbled backwards, leaning heavily against the wall, blood pooling on the floor. Voldemort smirked and took steps forward, deflecting spells with easy flicks of his wand.
Severus rolled his eyes. “It’s not that far, so hopefully no splinching should occur. Everyone ready?”
He closed his eyes, just for a moment, but the steam and soothing scent of the soap must have made him pass out, because next thing he knew, he was in bed.
Harry groaned inwardly as he heard Lucius’ tell–tale footsteps for a third day in a row. He was especially fond of the cruciatus, although still nowhere near the viciousness of Voldemort or Bellatrix. Curiously, Harry had yet to be visited by Fenrir — a full moon must have passed by now, and Harry had expected that that would be when the werewolf would visit.
