Draco was still asleep when Harry came back in, so he cooked some pasta for supper and went to check again when he’d finished with his own helping.
“It’s so odd to me that in wizarding culture, we sort of give up creativity and imagination as we leave childhood. It’s tragic. I’ve been wondering and trying to work out what about magic precludes us from writing novels and plays and making art that isn’t a portrait of some inventor or politician, and I’ve just absolutely no idea. You know I don’t even know any wizards who play a musical instrument? My godson wanted to learn to play the piano, and his tutor is a muggle. Do you know any wizards who play the piano?”
“Put your right hand on the door and face toward me,” Malfoy instructed. “Palm down, that’s right. Plant it solidly and make sure your stance is strong as well. Good.” Malfoy placed his own hand on the door and extended the other, “Now take my hand.”
Harry and Theodore escorted Malfoy to Theo’s bedroom. Malfoy set his bag down and prowled about the room with the Dark Detector held out in front of him.
“Right, so. I’ve got to be careful. Because it isn’t just me I’m concerned with, because Theodore is my main responsibility at the moment, and he needs a safe and stable and comfortable life more than I need to. Helter.”
“So Haz,” Dudley remarked around a mouthful of roast potatoes.They were sitting across from each other at a very long table in the garden at the Burrow for the monthly Sunday dinner. Dudley had been a bit shy of joining initially, but now he turned up more often than Harry did. He was very popular with Arthur, and they’d developed a habit of going for drives together after the meal was finished. “How’s the dad thing going?” Harry had already progressed to pudding and was enjoying a helping of raspberry fool but Dudley’s appetite was rivaled only by Ron’s, so he took longer over each course.
Draco went quiet for a bit and thoughtfully clinked the ice in his glass before replying, “It’s a bit daunting. This wall of shit.”
“He was quite obsessed with Harry in return, though,” said Hermione, thoughtfully rubbing her pregnant belly where she had dripped raspberry juice on her shirt. “He was always seeking him out and bothering him. He used to come and find him on the train to school every single year. Except sixth year. I suppose that’s what set you off, Harry.”
Malfoy shrugged, “Not since he was a baby. We saw them for a bit shortly after the war, til Aunt Andromeda and my mum fell out again. She used to mention you, actually.”
Hermione frowned a little, “Well, yes we did know, Harry. Malfoy’s part of this werewolf rights group, and he comes to liaise with the department sometimes. I see him around the Ministry, and they send him to offer testimony at depositions. He’s really well spoken, actually.”
Malfoy smiled rather sardonically, “Not by name. It was ever so subtle. She called you Little Teddy’s Godfather like you were the Minister of Magic or something. No name needed.”
“There isn’t anything wrong with being gay. I didn’t mean to imply that. There’s nothing wrong with it, okay?”
“Oh,” Harry was a little disappointed. “Well that’s all right. I’ll send you an inscribed copy when it comes out.”
“I believe you’re right.” Draco pressed a damp kiss on him. “But look out, because I think it might be catching.”
“In my bag,” Draco said, looking amused. “There’s a nightshirt. Just toss it to me, if you don’t mind.”
Draco had the grace to look embarrassed at that and the manners to apologise, “I’m sorry. Of course not. I only meant. I’m not here to contaminate your godson with the evils of our forebearers. I know what you're afraid of, and I promise I don't want to be a bad influence on him.”
Theodore looked at Harry, his face full of concern, “Will it give you bad dreams, Harry? Talking about it?”
Harry made a sort of squawk that he refused to be embarrassed of, “Yes, you’re incredibly vicious, and I’ve definitely learnt my lesson. Please do it again!”
Kal made a slightly unseemly sound himself, but gamely waved goodbye as they made their way toward the door, “Bye Theodore! Bye Theodore’s dad!”
“I don’t have any rosettes anymore,” Draco said a little stiffly. He looked a bit pink under his cap, and Harry had thought it was with cold, but now he wasn’t sure.
“I’ll show you,” Harry interrupted firmly. “Theodore, you’ll be hungry. You can have a bit of that pie Aunt Molly sent us for your tea. It’s on the cold shelf in the pantry.”
“Oh Potter, if you want to go incognito, I recommend not allowing yourself to be plastered on the cover of a magazine. How could I ignore that face?” he pulled a moue that shifted between a broody scowl and a sullen pout.
Malfoy raised his wand almost casually and pointed it at the ghoul. Some shimmering lavender mist wafted out and settled briefly on the ghoul before being absorbed into it. Malfoy then holstered his wand and lifted the ghoul off the wall, folding it deftly into quarters as if it were actually only a tapestry. He pulled a sack out of his bag and stuffed the ghoul inside, then tied off the mouth of the sack in a tight knot. The ghoul bestirred itself once it was in the sack, bulging and wriggling in Malfoy’s hand.
Harry couldn’t imagine why Malfoy backing down should make him feel so increasingly guilty, “You’re not going to get in trouble with your boss, are you?”
“Yes, do come along Teddy,” said Molly brightly. “I’ve mixed you a Sweet Dreams potion, and if you wait much longer to drink it, you’ll be all groggy in the morning,” Molly’s voice was shrinking as she pulled back from the fire.
Shadowfax followed Draco out of the room, and while they were gone, Harry lit the lamps with his wand. Draco returned presently, barefoot, and with his pale hair loose to his shoulders. He was wrapped in a blue silk paisley dressing gown, so sumptuous looking that Harry thought it must have come from his Malfoy family fortune days. Draco regained his seat, and Shadowfax sprang into his lap.
Andromeda leaned down to take the book off the boat and looked down at it, still looking rather shocked. She read the title aloud, “
He took Harry to a wizarding museum, formerly the family home of the MacNairs. There were a number of fascinating magical artifacts there, and all sorts of portraits that could recount the history of the subject and answer questions. Harry even found a portrait of his father’s father, Fleamont Potter which gave him bemused but detailed answers to Harry’s excited questions about James’ childhood, though it could not be made to understand  that Harry was James’ son.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Okay.” And he kissed Draco’s cold mouth to show that he wasn’t making that particular mistake at all.
“Well yes, hasn’t it always been Theodore?” Andromeda Vanished her handkerchief and Conjured a new one.
“And then Harry was the school hero over and over, and I was incredibly jealous that he was so brave and talented and so admired and that I could never show him up.”
“I mean,” Harry shut his eyes briefly, his middle feeling squirmier and squirmier. “More than that. Not that he likes me more than you! I mean er. We like each other like. Like. Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione. Or like er. Aunt Ginny and Aunt Luna. Luna. Sorry.”
“Yeah,” Ginny stood up and Harry rose and wrapped her in a hug. It was nice. The flowery perfume he remembered from their relationship was gone. She smelled sweetish, a bit like hay, and she still hugged back as if she were determined to prevail in a contest. It made him want to laugh.
Dean seemed to notice Theo and Draco for the first time, “I reckon you didn’t come in so I could give you a hard time about your hair, though. Wand working all right, I hope?”
Harry crept up to the bed and lowered himself slowly to his knees, scarcely breathing. He reached for the dust ruffle very slowly, as if moving too quickly would make a noise, trying to hold in the giggles that wanted to rise up from his chest. Just as his fingers brushed the cloth, Draco burst out from under the bed and jumped at him, knocking him over.
The shop attendant helped them choose everything they needed for the cat, while Theodore trailed around behind, holding his purring cat in his arms. Draco walked beside him, but Harry fell back to last of the procession, wondering if the lingering prickles of surprise and embarrassment were an over reaction and trying to jerk himself out of the feeling enough to enjoy the rest of the trip.
Draco was quiet for a moment, like he was thinking how to answer, “Because I liked having things that no one else was allowed, and I thought he would give them to me if I sucked up to him. And because there were people I hated, and I thought he would hurt them and make them go away. And because my nasty parents expected it of me. And deep down because I knew he was dangerous, and I thought it was much safer to be with him than against him. It wasn’t,” he added. “It never is.”
Draco smirked, “Oh my absolute pleasure. Now do go on. It is very fucking delicious finally being able to impress you, Harry.”
Harry noticed that music had struck up somewhere in the near distance, though he couldn’t see who was playing it. A sweet flute over the thrumming of a harp. “This place is incredible,” he said again.
Malfoy tucked in at once without even his customary slathering of jam, “Lord and lady these are heavenly. It really is appalling that you bake, Potter.”
“I shall hold you to that strenuously. I don’t suppose you’d be willing to tell me what this one is about?”
As he trotted out of the room, Harry decided that Draco would likely be able to sniff him out with his heightened wolfish sense of smell quite easily, so he decided to cheat. He cast a quick Disillusionment Charm on himself and shot a Muffliato toward Draco for good measure.
Malfoy looked very well, compared to the last time they’d met when he’d been drawn with fear and misery and looking quite pale and rather scrawny. His face had healthy colour, and he’d grown into his pointed features in the interim years. His sleek blond hair now hung to his shoulders, pulled partially back in a neat half knot. He wore simple navy blue robes and had a large black satchel hung over one shoulder.
“You know I’m trying to hear what Harry has to say, and you two keep annoying him,” Dudley said mildly, helping himself to some of the raspberry fool.
Harry laughed, and he knew it a was a little too loudly. Then he stood up, “I think we’ve only got the library left now.”
“I know, I know,” Harry yawned. “You’ll turn me into a great big juicy toad and feed me to a raccoon.”
In addition to navy blue robes with the school crest embroidered on the back and a navy cap with a low peak, Theodore’s school uniform required plain black lace up shoes, “Won’t you get detention for being out of uniform?”
“It’s all right,” Draco said. “I know you didn’t. No, I wasn’t bitten by the brooch. That’s a werewolf bite. Though I did get it for essentially the same reason. Cowardice. Treachery.”
“And sometimes I got hurt or saw my friends hurt. And sometimes I thought I’d die. And that changed me. It changed my mind and it changed my body and mostly in not very good ways. And it was wrong for them--the grownups--to let those things happen to me, because I was a kid. It isn’t because I think you’re no good or you can’t handle it. That isn’t the point. The whole point of the cursebreaking is to make sure there isn’t anything that will hurt you in the house. If I let you stay and watch, you might get hurt anyway, and that’s the last thing I want. I know you’re interested, but there’re more appropriate ways for you to learn about that stuff, okay? You trust me?”
“Well, I think the conspicuous question is, why have you written the books you’ve written? Wouldn’t the more obvious choice be an account of what you went through during your time at Hogwarts? Or your disappearance leading up to the defeat of You-Know-Who?”
“I think I’m too cynical to be a proper integrationist. Too much of our culture is built on the idea that we’re important because we have magic and maybe that we’ve been chosen to have magic because we’re important or because we’re already special. We’re special because we have magic, and we have magic because we’re special.
“Mind you keep hold of that,” Harry advised, nodding at Theo’s breakfast. As an inveterate dawdler, Theodore had missed most of breakfast, but Molly had held back enough bacon and toast to make him a bacon sandwich for the walk to school from his Port point.
“You’re amazingly loving, Harry,” Luna said matter of factly. “But you’re afraid of not being in charge of it. You can’t be in charge of it every time, though. You’re not a gardener with a watering can. You’re a flower, too. Just like the rest of us.”
Draco quieted them all with an impressive Silencing Charm, “Very well done, Theodore, thank you. Now I don’t know if you’re aware, but this portrait is hung to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm. Do you know how to tell?”
“I think I might be an integrationist now,” Draco remarked over drinks one drizzly November evening.
After slightly too much lunch, they moved on to Sirius’s room. Harry was rather dreading it, and Draco must have sensed his nerves, because he seemed a little tense as well. But Harry unsealed and unlocked the room, and they stepped in. After a minute, Draco’s shoulders lowered and he smiled as he paced about with his Dark Detector held out in front of him.
“I’ve not been apprised of the normal options for this situation; we must have gone to different finishing schools. And I wasn’t trying to ambush you. Who grabbed who?”
“Oh, that’s an easy one. One of my dear friends takes Witch Weekly, and she’d never forgive me if I turned it down. I know what you’re thinking,”
Notably, they watched both the Pride and Prejudice miniseries and the newer film, and their debate regarding the merits of the respective Darcies grew so heated, that they were obliged to call on Hermione to be their tie-breaker. Hermione did not seem at all surprised to find them in their pyjamas together but as she only said that Colin Firth was better looking but Matthew McFayden was more pleasingly awkward, she was not much help.
“Hm, let’s see. Exploding Snap is right out, ha. Our options are a bit limited as there’re only two of us. And you’re a wolf,” he added as an afterthought. “Or at least you look like one.”
Draco rummaged in his bag and pulled out a corked flask, “You have no idea. Erm, Potter I really ought to take my last dose of wolfsbane. Could I borrow a good sized cup?”
“Because you have school and only a fortnight left of the term, so you shouldn’t miss any of it,” Harry answered absently, stirring his coffee.
“I mean you’re taking ages,” complained Theo. “You’d go faster if you let me help, I reckon. And I’m hungry. Sooo hungry!”
“Oh yes, of course. We’ve just been sorting out what Theodore needs for the morning. Go on Theo; I’m just behind you with your school bag and your
“I expect you’d be doing all the work, actually,” said Harry, feeling guilty again for reasons he could not fathom.
Draco went a little pink, but he nodded, “Exactly. You’re not alone. And you still get to be a whole person, and there will still be people who can see that, even if it isn’t every single person you meet.”
“That’s great, Hagrid,” Harry helped himself to tea. The pot was wrapped in one of Molly Weasley’s magical tea cozies, and the steam that rose off the tea was thick and stung his eyes.
Harry sighed, “There was a boggart in his cupboard. Theodore’s. It came out last night and scared the living daylights out of him.”
Theodore held up a new copy of the book Draco had sent him, then got up from the bench. There were tiny boats moored to the near side of the shore so that visitors could send gifts across to the patient side. Theodore caught hold of one of these and sailed the book across the moat to Andromeda.
Theo cut the picture away from the frame, slowly and carefully, Mrs Black raving behind the Silencing Charm all the while.
“I think maybe a dove wouldn’t quite do,” said Theodore slowly. “Because of being so small. I think I’d want someone a bit more sturdy?”
“Little menace,” Draco said fondly, scraping her off his shoulder and turning her onto her back in the crook of his elbow, “I should have warned him about you, and then he wouldn’t think you’re doing that to be nice.” Shadowfax hugged and kicked his arm with evident affection.
“This is it here, is it?” Draco nodded to the neat stack of manuscript pages on Harry’s otherwise quite untidy desk.
“Harry took loads of pamphlets,” Theo remarked in an indulgent sort of tone, as if it had been well beside the point but harmless enough not to begrudge Harry his collection.
Theodore thought for a moment and smiled a crafty sort of smile that made Harry want to laugh, “Set fire to it?”
The hostess set off at half a trot, and they followed briskly behind her, through an ordinary dining room, filled with muggles on dates, down a dim corridor and through a door that looked like it was going to lead to the kitchen. It didn’t.
“I don’t mind you asking me questions about being gay, Theodore,” Draco said kindly. “You haven’t offended me. But Harry’s right about it being usually something you let people tell you on their own. You might want to be a bit careful in future. People can get quite upset when they have to talk about that before they’re ready to, and sometimes it can be. Unsafe for them. All right?”
When they had been going out for a couple of months, it occurred to Harry that Draco might enjoy some more artistic pursuits, and brought him to several muggle art museums, and a poetry reading to extremely favourable responses.
“Harry, mate I’ve seen that face a thousand times. You’re blaming yourself for something.You want a chat, I think. Or a wobbly. Follow me to work and have it there while I get ready to open, or I’ll be late.”
While he was pondering it, Theo remarked, “Oh we like those books as well. I like The Hobbit better, though.The Lord of the Rings makes Harry-” he checked himself before declaring that the books made Harry cry, but added, “Are you gay, Draco?”
“Oh,” said Harry, feeling very foolish. “Right. Erm, no he doesn’t live with us. I wouldn’t have someone move into our house without asking you.”
“Of course you do,” Dean was already swinging himself back over the counter and gathering up wands from the shelves. He poked a wand box at Theodore, “Try this one. Applewood and dragon heartstring. Ten and a quarter inches and a bit whippy.”
Draco smirked, “I mean of course the very particular Potter magic that--let’s see how did you put it again?--helps us see into hearts and lives that are not our own. Something like that?”
“Your fault,” Harry murmured without opening his eyes. He wondered how Draco had known he was awake and decided Draco must have woken him. Shadowfax was on the bed somewhere. He could hear her purring.
“Not very long. But I erm. I did have a dream about you that I’ve just woken up from.” Draco nuzzled back into Harry’s chest and dragged light kisses across it. Despite the warmth of the blankets and the sweat on the back of his neck, Harry’s skin prickled into gooseflesh at the touch.
Harry was very taken aback, as he hadn’t realised Theodore recognised Draco, but he was saved from making a proper answer when Theo’s Portkey began to glow. He handed Theodore his bookbag and his hat and had only time for a hasty goodbye, before Theo touched his finger to the Portkey and vanished.
Harry swallowed and shook his head, “But I. What if I muck it up somehow? Theodore really does need D-Draco more than I do. And if it doesn’t work out and Draco doesn’t want to be around us anymore? He’d be devastated.”
“Darling,” Draco came and put his arms around Harry’s neck and bent to kiss his temple, “Everything is fine. I’m meeting the movers at my old place, and it’ll only be a couple of hours there, and then I’ll be back and help you sort out what you want to wear to the premier. Deep breaths. Remember your exercises.”
“Of course,” Draco told him. “A familiar is invaluable. My rabbit Scorpius was the only thing that got me through my sixth year.”
“It’s horribly unprofessional of me, but as you’re helping with the ward anyway,” Malfoy seemed to have been prepared for this eventuality because in his satchel, he had spare gloves and an extra face shield for Harry to wear during the removal.
“There was one more thing,” Draco said. “I’ve had an idea on how to involve Theo, since he wants to see some decontamination so badly.”
“Of course. I should give him his hot chocolate while it’s still warm,” Draco announced, rising to fit the action to the words.
“Aunt Ginny told me ages ago, like when I was nine,” Theodore said wisely. “Does it mean anything else?”
“Glad to hear you’re getting on with the next book,” Hagrid said eagerly. “I about tore through the last one. Never thought I would have enjoyed that sort o’ thing. Made up stories and all. But you’ve got a knack, Harry. You’ve got a knack for anything you try, really.”
“Yeah, I just wish they’d let me have a broomstick,” Theo glanced at Harry. “I already know how to fly.”
Draco chewed thoughtfully, “I know people eat it? I believe it’s round, unless it’s like those strange little semi representational pictograms the muggles put on the lavs.”
“Well, you’re getting along great,” Ginny gave him an encouraging wallop on the back, determined not to lose any more ground in mateyness, apparently. “You’ll make a fabulous queer, Harry.”
“Harry!” Hagrid was inside as well, sitting on a painfully compressed poof pulled up to Luna and Ginny’s kitchen table. Ginny was sat across from him in an ancient Gryffindor jumper and faded Harpies leggings, holding a steaming mug between both hands and resting her stocking feet on Fang’s back.
Draco was lying on his side, petting Shadowfax, when Harry peeked in, but he sat up with a smile when Harry came in with the dish, “What’ve we here?”
“I’m really glad to hear you say that. Relieved like. Because. I hope I’m not being presumptuous, I just think I’ve felt things like. Like we’re sort of. Finding our way back to the beginning that. Maybe we should have had? If things had been different when we met? Know what I mean? Like. Things are sort of shifting about. Like we are, ourselves?”
“Only to be sure it is quite saved,” said Harry, not as embarrassed to be caught eavesdropping as he knew he should be.
Harry woke the next morning to the sound of rain, but realised quickly that it wasn’t the rain that had woken him when something small and light bounced off his forehead again. Harry startled and reached for his glasses. The something small was flitting about his head on little paper wings, and when Harry reached out and caught it, he saw it was a tiny scrap of parchment folded into the shape of an origami crane.
Harry counted backward from ten in his head before he answered, “I know. Right. I am in over my head.”
“Oh just fine,” Hagrid said, smiling over a huge sip of tea. “Pumpkins are comin’ along. Grawp was down from the hills the other day for a visit, and he’s well.”
“Okay,” Theodore leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder for a tiny moment, then let go of him. “I know.” Theodore drew a deep breath, “Harry?”
“No, actually it solves some of my problems. Love is erm. It’s a powerful motivating force for that type of lasting fixation. And platonic love doesn’t typically arise from so little information, so an infatuation or attraction is a good catalyst. And also if they’re a couple at the end of this book, it gives them an automatic reason to work together in the next book. The story makes more sense if Belle is falling in love with Diana.”
“That’s a good thing,” Draco said patiently. And by the time Harry finished his breakfast, Draco was sound asleep.
“Yeah, exactly,” Harry willed himself not to titter awkwardly and was mostly successful. “It just seems a bit. Trivial. Selfish. Know what I mean? Shouldn’t I be focusing on Theodore?”
When Harry looked up from his outline, Draco had stowed his Dark Detector and was watching him anxiously.
“But,” Harry added hastily. “I. I don’t mean that I don’t want to see you, because I do. I’m just trying to say. Be patient with me? I might be quite slow. Is that okay?”
Malfoy drew his arm back and yanked his sleeve down, “What does it look like, Potter?” He was clearly trying for his old sneer, but he looked young and frightened and embarrassed.
“I’m going to learn as well, when I’ve had enough Potions for them to take me,” Theo said staunchly.
Malfoy’s Dark Detector seemed to guide him at once to a particular corner, under a tidy little desk with a formerly handsome quill and several sheets of loose parchment laid on it, as if its owner had only just got up from it. Save for the dust, of course. Malfoy knelt, then lay on his front, the Dark Detector still held in front of him. He crawled determinedly under the desk, then with a little aha! of triumph, tore back a corner of carpet, and emerged a moment later with a wooden box upheld in his dusty, black dragonhide glove.
“Better?” Harry asked about four minutes later, when Draco had disappeared his bacon and eggs and was now focused on his tea but at a more reasonable rate.
“Nothing. I mean it was a long time ago,” Harry said apologetically. “You sent me that valentine when you were in first year and I was in second year. The singing one. ‘His eyes are as green’ as a something or other.”
Malfoy had begun to cast the spell. Harry was too focused on his own task to make out the murmured words of the incantation, but he fancied he could feel a little warmth growing in his hands. Both the palm on the door, and the palm pressed to Malfoy’s. As if they were live circuits. There was a pleasant prickle of gooseflesh rising on the back of his neck.
Harry had done quite a lot to prepare for Theodore’s arrival, though it mainly hadn’t been choosing videos to watch together. Before it was decided that Theodore would be coming to him, Harry had been dawdling through finishing with the cleaning up of Grimmauld Place, as it hadn’t really seemed a priority compared with everything else going on in Harry’s life.
“Sure, of course. Erm Theo. If you have any questions or you want to talk about anything. Just. Just tell me. We can talk about anything, okay?”
Harry drew a deep breath, “Yeah ready.” He shut his eyes, then opened them again and looked right into Malfoy’s pupils. He thought of Theodore. Of seeing him for the first time in the photo Remus had shown him of a tiny baby with turquoise hair. He thought of Theo zooming around the room on the toy broomstick Harry had given him for his third birthday. He thought of Theodore sitting on the floor picking out tapes, and he thought of Theo fending off a boggart attack.
“Oh, is this about that werewolf thing?” Ron interjected, leaning toward them, away from a half-serious argument with Hermione about kneazles.
“Exactly,” Harry nodded. “That’s it exactly. And sometimes, people consider it a bit private, and they want to decide for themselves who they talk to about it, so if you ask, they don’t get to pick their own moments, and it can make them feel uncomfortable. Does that make sense?”
Draco poured himself a little more tea, “I did know you. I should have said hello to you; I’m sorry.”
“I’ve never really been wooed like this before. It’s so sweet of you. Happy when I’m happy and all.”
Harry hesitated, then added, “It turned into a werewolf.” Ron let out a low whistle. “I know. It wasn’t even a real werewolf, it was like. This horrible. Half man half wolf thing. A monster. It was awful.”
“Well houses have names. Like the Weasleys have The Burrow and Victoire’s house is called Shell Cottage, and Draco when you were a kid, your house had a name as well.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, “It was a bit complicated, but I’m really glad I got to see him. No one ever even told me anything about him, really. Not even Sirius, and he lived with my dad’s parents for a while.”
Harry shouldered Theo’s school bag so that he could focus on not dropping his sandwich and checked his watch, “Bout ten seconds.”
“I’ve got to,” Draco said, his voice still rather faint. “There’s no one else.” He waved away the Strengthening Solution and took another pull on the pain potion. “I’m sorry. I should’ve told you it isn’t very nice to look at.”
Harry glanced at the window, but all he could see was a scrap of dark sky, Venus glinting palely in the distance.
“I hope you’ll come back,” the welcome wizard smiled sincerely. “If you come on Saturday mornings, you’ll usually see me. Just look for the bloke with the pink hair and come say hi. I’m Kal.”
“I don’t need to butter you up. I’m sure you’ll be interested because of your ego--er I mean because of your well founded confidence in your ability to improve people’s lives.”
“Brilliant summer, Granny!” Theodore said eagerly. “Draco showed us the YLHC--oh, that’s the Youth Lycanthropy Health Centre--and everyone there’s really nice. And Ara from my support group is going to be starting at Hogwarts with me! I hope we’re in the same house. It’ll be nice not being the only werewolf. She’s been on wolfsbane longer than I have. I just had my first doses two weeks ago. It’s called a pro-er. A pro something.” He looked at Harry, “What’s it called again?”
“Inside my bag, there’ll be a pouch. Check the pouch. There should be a flask for a Strengthening Solution and a pain potion. And I’ll need to eat something.”
Malfoy raised his chin, though his blush was spreading quickly across his face, “Would it be stupid to say sorry?”
Draco tossed his hair, “I’ve long since given up expecting you to restrain all your revelatory impulses, Harry.”
Harry didn’t have all that much in the way of things either, as-despite the small fortune his parents had left him and the larger fortune he’d made from his book--he had a horror of spending money on himself. He suspected that was what had prevented him from making Grimmauld Place properly livable before, though when he confided those feelings to Ron, Ron had laughed and said, “But you’re paying rent even though you already have free accommodation, numpty, so it can’t be that.”
“I didn’t expect you would. It’s one of Hermione’s favourites, and she lent it to me because it’s so different from the sort of thing I write, and she thought it’d help me clear my head and relax. It’s sort of helping me with the romantical type bits I’m adding into my Belle Brewer story, though. It’s a love story. I’m quite enjoying it.” Harry paused, feeling he was doing more than his share of talking. Though of course, Draco couldn’t speak either way.
Andromeda was extremely taken aback, but she found her voice when asked a direct question, “T-er Theodore, it isn’t nice to say that word.”
Without even bothering to check if anyone was looking, he walked through the wall between Platform 9 and 10 and vanished. Theodore followed him eagerly, and Harry brought up the rear.
Harry opened his mouth to point out that Malfoy had not officially been engaged yet, but Theo lit up at the words.
They both sipped their tea and if either wiped their eyes on their sleeve, the other was too polite to notice.
“Why does it make people unsafe for other people to find out they’re gay? Or why does it make people feel uncomfortable? If it’s just about liking people, why does it have to be such a big deal?”
Luna rose from her chair, “Hagrid, let’s go and feed the chickens so that Harry and Ginny can talk in private. If Harry blushes any harder, I’m sure he’ll faint.”
Harry didn’t scowl, and he knew he didn’t because he was specifically trying not to, “Like what? My face isn’t like anything.”
“When you say you’re not going to talk about Harry Potter, you mean the Harry Potter persona? The Chosen One? The Boy Who Lived? Are you still chafing under it? I imagine you find it a bit wearing, but you must have the urge to correct it or at least update it. Get yourself out from under it?”
Harry’s television and VCR were objects of great fascination to Theodore, and he asked to have a go with them nearly every time he came round. In preparation for his stay, Harry had gotten very enthusiastic at the video rental near his flat and bought a perhaps excessive percentage of their secondhand stock. There was a teetery stack of cases piled up round the telly he’d just brought back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was particularly looking forward to introducing Theodore to
They found Shadowfax waiting for them when they returned to the sitting room. Draco seemed ready to relax for the time being. He clambered onto the sofa, and Shadowfax followed him and sat on the armrest near his legs. Harry decided to relax as well.
“We can talk about the merits of each suggestion, after I’ve got them all recorded, but at the moment I only have mine down,” said Theodore patiently. ”I’ve actually been sort of doing some research in the school library.”
“Well,” said Harry slowly. “I’ve kind of already fucked it up, actually. But I think I’m sorting it out.”
Harry turned around to find Ron Weasley beaming and waving and striding toward him, his magenta robes even more garish in the mundane green and brown of the road and the field behind him.
“His rights for werewolves group actually has a whole platform about youth outreach. A lot of the new werewolves are really young because of.” Hermione screwed up her face as if it stung to say his name aloud, “Greyback. Attacking them in the war,” She shuddered and Ron rubbed her arm. “According to Malfoy, it’s uphill sledding, though. Because of him, ironically. Greyback. People think werewolves only want to be around kids to bite them.”
not going to act like we are,” he laid very pointed emphasis on I’m. “I’m not here to intrude on you or my cousin or to convince him to start doing in muggleborns or whatever it is you were just shouting about. I’m here to do a job that I’ve been asked to do, and that I’m damn good at. I’d be very pleased to help provide my cousin with a safe and comfortable place to live, but I’m not going to beg you to let me do it.”
“It’s okay,” said Harry. “Thanks.” He gave Hermione a hug and she buried her face in his shoulder, “It’s okay, Hermione. Don’t cry. I’m sorry.” Ron patted them both.
They shared the rest of the steak and kidney pie from the night before, and then Harry brought in his television and VCR and set them up where the screen would be easily visible from the bed.
“Well. Er. I suppose the rude answer is. Because I didn’t want to write about my experiences. They’re mine, and other people already feel entitled enough to them as it is. If I hadn’t written fiction, I wouldn’t have written at all. I hate talking about myself.”
“Well I think it’s brilliant,” said Dudley staunchly. “Having a big family,” he raised his bottle of butterbeer like he was making a toast, and they all followed suit and drank.
“Rosie’s five,” Ron began, then changed tack at the look on Harry’s face. “But I see what you mean. You’ll have to have another sweep. Or why don’t you hire one of those cleaner services?”
Mingled surprise at Malfoy’s composure and irritation at being defused by him rolled over Harry. He took a deep breath as well, “Okay.”
There seemed to be some sort of communication between Malfoy and the Dark Detector, though Harry could not understand its mechanism. It apparently guided him about the room randomly, and he paused to pass it over various spots or objects without obvious reason. He spent quite a long time lingering at an old tapestry on the wall that showed a fat yellow moon hanging over a hillside with a stream running past it.
“You’re not wearing your rosette,” Harry remarked as he and Draco climbed the hill toward the Hogwarts quidditch pitch one cold, bright December morning. There was a quidditch match at Hogwarts on the last day before the Christmas holiday, and Harry and Draco had gone up to see the match and to take Theodore out for dinner in Hogsmeade before the journey home. Theodore was very excited as he had never seen Hogsmeade before. Harry was also excited. Draco was rather nervous.
Theodore considered, “Well it should be something sort of simple, because they usually are. And something that’s to do with all of us together. I’m not sure the Den works for that. You’re not really a wolf, Harry. Sorry.”
“Well, that’s just the thing. If it was only me, I would have already. Well. I might’ve. You know. But it’s not just me. I’ve got to think of Theodore as well. He needs a stable family more than I need a,” Harry trailed off.
A desire to laugh in relief mixed with annoyance at being caught out for being afraid when he hadn’t even noticed himself that he was afraid. Harry nodded. “I suppose I am,” he said rather stiffly.
Theodore started giggling about Draco saying ‘dick,’ “It’s okay. You should hear the kids at school.”
“I had both,” Draco offered. “Scorpius my rabbit and my owl Achilles. Achilles was more like a colleague, though. Bit of a dick at times, really. ‘Scuse my language, cousin.”
The audience rose in a standing ovation during the bows, and instead of filing out with everyone else when the house lights came up, Draco sank back down into his seat and surreptitiously Conjured a handkerchief to wipe his tear-sticky face.
“All right, then. Put your head down again. You’re in my light.” Draco obeyed and Harry opened the book and flipped back to the beginning. “This is another muggle book. More novels, ha. It’s called
Theodore tried five wands in total before sending up a blaze of turquoise sparks, the same colour as his hair.
“I’ve decided something,” Harry’s godson announced, grave and bespectacled over ice cream. He was drabber than usual. Among wizards, he liked to match his hair to his clothes, but when he was with Harry in the muggle world, he turned his hair to its natural mousy blond. The matching habit and the natural colour both put Harry in mind of Tonks. It still twinged a bit some days, those little echoes of his friend in her son who had never known her.
Draco was still looking about him curiously, “Between all your uncharacteristic apprehension and the way the room was sealed up, I thought for certain there was a hell mouth in here or something. I’ve seen you meet a dragon with more swagger.”
“It makes me feel like a fucking idiot,” Harry said rather jerkily. “When you two discuss me behind my back like you’re my parents, and I’m your naughty kid.”
The dinner was delectable from start to finish, and when they stepped out onto the pavement afterward, it seemed perfectly right and natural, though it was thrilling, to take Draco’s hand and lace their fingers together.
Theodore smiled almost carelessly, “Okay. I know. Me too.” His genuine casual assurance made Harry feel so bursting with affection that he thought he might well up. He gave Theo a hug instead and didn’t even mind a quick swipe of claws through the basket from Twinkle.
“You said Belle Brewer isn’t you, but you also said that the magical world needs more art and fiction so that we can understand each other better. How can it be both? Something’s very fishy here, Potter.”
Theodore drew breath as if to finally speak, but instead burst into noisy tears. Feeling a bit useless, Harry shuffled up the bed and put his arm about Theodore’s shoulders, “Hey, it’s all right. You’re safe. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”
“Though not dirty knickers,” Malfoy smirked but there was a smudge of jam on his cheek that made the expression less annoying somehow. Harry wondered if Malfoy’d had that particular dimple at Hogwarts and his ears got a little warmer.
“Behave yourself,” he told him. “Don’t sleep through breakfast, and don’t make yourself look like professors and cancel lessons.”
“I’m not helpless! I can throw things,” Theodore said staunchly. “And shout. Harry said that’s the thing to do if I see a monster. Yell my head off, and he’ll run and help me.”
“Oh,” Harry tried to tuck himself against Draco’s shoulder without interrupting the activity in his hair. “Is that what’s upsetting you?”
Dudley patted Harry on the shoulder, and Hermione made little fluttering motions with her hands like she wanted to give him a hug but wasn’t sure if she’d be allowed.
Behind them, the Floo hummed, and they stepped out of the way in time to avoid Theodore jumping out of the fireplace.
“But I’m still working on my new Belle Brewer story. I can’t just stop; they’ve given me a big advance. I have to finish the book.”
Theodore bowed his head over his dish of ice cream as if he were being scolded, and when he looked up again, Harry realised with dismay that he wasn’t so much serious or abashed as frightened, his amber eyes were wide and tears were starting to rise in them, “Harry, is Granny going to die?”
When Theodore had finished with his water, Harry rose from the bed, “Come on, I think we need a little change of venue for the night.” Theodore got up and followed Harry obediently  out of the room. Harry paused in the corridor to shoot a Silencing Charm at Mrs Black’s portrait before they went on down to the kitchen.
At a quarter to eleven on September first, Harry and Theodore hurried through King’s Cross station toward the departure platform. Theodore had Twinkle’s basket clutched in his arms, and Harry was dragging Theo’s trunk, bewitched to hover the tiniest bit off the ground and glide smoothly along as if it were wheeled. Draco was waiting for them at Platform 9, with a steaming paper takeaway cup in each hand. He was dressed in neat muggle clothes, save for the black dragon leather jacket that matched his boots.
“Harry,” Theo said hesitantly, though in a tone that Harry thought suggested he’d meant to speak up for some time. “Erm. Is Draco coming home with us? Does he live at Grimmauld Place now?”
“It’s called a Dark Detector,” Malfoy answered, drawing on the gloves. “It helps me find things that shouldn’t be there. Which room is yours?”
Ron considered, “Well, you know Andromeda was never very keen on Remus, if you believe Mum. I think she’s probably sort of in denial about Te-er Theodore.”
Harry turned to move in the direction Draco indicated, “So what happened to the big family home out in the country?”
Theodore sighed but collected his bag and swooped off to his room without another word of complaint.
“Don’t you cheek me, Harry Potter. I’m extremely vicious, and I could easily rend you to bits with my fangs.” He spat lightly on Harry’s erection and gave it one long, hot lave with his tongue before going back to Harry’s chest, kissing, sucking, nibbling bluntly.
Harry conjured a length of green ribbon and a length of silver ribbon and wound them quickly into a rosette, which he handed to Draco, “There you are.”
“It’s your book,” Draco seemed to be feeling a little embarrassed as if he thought he might finally have overstepped. He ducked his head for a moment to tie his hair back up, then got up from Harry’s chair and raised his Dark Detector. Harry took Draco’s place at his desk, and smoothed out his outline for the book, pinning the corners to the blotter so that they wouldn’t roll up as he wrote. He scribbled notes and additions on the outline while Draco scanned the room with the Dark Detector.
Harry spared a moment to marvel over the paradox that was Luna’s grasp of subtext, “Is it that obvious? Or have you been talking about me?”
“Yeah, well. I reckon it’s easier to make good choices when you have good influences. The er. Right side can help with that a bit. And for your information,” Harry snapped. “The people who raised me were rubbish also. My parents definitely weren’t the beginning and end of my er. Moral development.”
Draco dragged in a long breath through his nose, “Most of the fortune necessary for its upkeep was sunk into the coup effort, and the rest was confiscated by the Ministry after the war. Since my parents both had their wands snapped and couldn’t even use glamours on it to pretend everything was fine while the roof fell in, they. Vacated. My mother fled to Romania where she has no doubt found herself a black market wand and a new blood supremacist husband and perhaps a second round of blond offspring. And my father. Fled this plane of existence. So. Not much family, not much home.”
Theodore popped up every now and again to present some piece of analysis to Harry, whom he regarded as a quidditch expert, second only to Ginny. Theodore happened to be sitting with them for a particularly long time out when Draco got up to get them all hot chocolates from concessions.
“There is one last little thing to remove, and with your godfather’s permission, I’ve saved it to last so that you can see it done. If you like.”
“I know,” Harry stooped to pet Fang. “I’m putting down roots into my desk chair, I think. All I ever do is write these days.”
The faint spots of colour on Malfoy’s face brightened into a vivid pink and his silvery eyes sparkled with anger. But instead of shouting back or pulling out his wand, he drew a long breath through his nose and blew it out slowly, “We’re not sixteen anymore, so
They ate a very scrumptious and luxurious dinner in a muggle tapas restaurant, then went on to the play. Though they’d read the play before the holidays to prepare themselves, they were both riveted by the performance. There was something thrilling about being so united in their feelings, not only with each other, but with the rest of the audience and the cast as well.
Harry coughed quietly, hoping to get her attention without startling her but she still jumped, “Goodness! Hello Harry dear! You gave me a turn. Everything all right?”
“He’s not your responsibility; he’s mine!” Harry hissed. “You’re not his dad just because you know how to be a werewolf already.”
“Everyone is at first,” Draco said gently. “It isn’t the sort of thing you just know intuitively if you’re a decent person. You have to research. I wasn’t impugning your. Dadship.”
“And think of the people in your book that you told me about,” Draco said. “The one your aunt Hermione sent you. Accomplished Lycanthropes Through History. We’ve always been here, and some of us have been very gifted.”
On the second day of Theodore’s visit to Shell Cottage, in flagrant defiance of his editor, and as he had written a fairly solid number of pages the day before, Harry decided to pay a visit of his own. There had been something preying on his mind for some time, and it had only gotten louder since his trip to Diagon Alley with Draco and Theodore.
Draco changed Harry’s fork into a piece of chalk just to lovingly annoy him, but Harry was laughing too much to be annoyed as he handed it over.
When Harry woke almost too cosy the next morning, he thought that Draco was still asleep. He turned out to be mistaken. Draco was tucked up against Harry’s chest, his hair pooling out over both of them, his skin warm and soft and fragrant with sleep. Harry hugged Draco and kissed the hair that brushed against his lips, and Draco hmm’d sleepily and shifted to look up into Harry’s face.
“Liar. You couldn’t look more delighted if you tried with both hands and a Lumos. How’s the third one coming on?”
“Well,” Theo plucked at a loose thread in the knee of his robes. “Quite a lot of his letters have been coming with Godric now, so I wondered.”
Harry laughed again, “I’m starting to suspect you don’t have the slightest interest in avoiding my chaffing.”
Theodore sighed bravely. “I’ve decided to go by Theodore, Aunt Molly,” he announced as he stepped into the green flames of the Floo.
“I’ve an. Awkward request. Burning with desire as you obviously are, every time I utter your name. Do you think we could er. I tend to find sex quite erm distracting, so if we could keep that side of things rather tame for a bit?”
“Then you had best come inside. Maybe stand on the mat until I’ve dried you, though,” Luna stepped back from the door to admit him and waved her wand to cast a Drying Charm over him as soon as he was inside.
“You shouldn’t’ve typed them up on this haunted typewriter. Going to have to destroy that as well. Dear me Potter, you really must be more careful in future.”
Draco handed him the knife, “I’d recommend you start in one of the top corners. Bit closer to the frame, perhaps? Perfect. Mind your fingers.”
“It’s nothing to do with romance. She’s almost like my mum; she basically raised me. She was actually the first witch I ever met. So obviously I can’t let her down, even if I’d rather be writing than written about. Can’t disappoint Molly.”
Draco didn’t let go of Harry straight away, “Would you stay with me tonight? Sleep here? I really want to be with you tonight.”
Draco nodded and dug in his bag, withdrawing a blue sheet of parchment, “We’re a very legitimate group; we work with St. Mungo’s and the Ministry. It isn’t just a load of crackpots meeting in someone’s extension once a month.”
“You could write me a note,” Theo wheedled. “My teacher’s had the copy of Witch Weekly with you on the cover sticking out of her bag for a week.”
Malfoy shrugged, “Not likely. But. Even so. It was a mistake for me to come here. I should have known at the outset that it was a mistake.” He fiddled with his left sleeve, shoving it up and down his forearm nervously, “I did want to see you.” Harry gawked at the admission. “Not to do you a mischief or anything,” Malfoy added quickly. “I just. Don’t you think it all ended a bit. Abruptly?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, but he unpinned the rosette on his own chest and pointed his wand at it, “Geminio.” He handed Draco the second rosette and watched Draco pocket the green and silver one. “Any special reason?”
“Oh, erm.” Harry used the remote control to pause the tape and tried to give Draco a concise explanation of films. Draco slumped against him as he spoke, and Harry thought he was probably bored hearing about it, but he was grateful for the contact anyway.
Draco took the instructions to heart. He went back to kissing Harry’s chest, wet, sharp kisses up and down Harry’s torso that made Harry shiver and clutch at Draco. His hands scrabbled at Harry’s borrowed pyjamas, searching for ingress, popping off buttons, yanking down Harry’s pyjama bottoms.
“They’re not alive,” Draco corrected gently. “The purpose of the portraits is to preserve wizarding history, so the charm that animates them scrapes a sort of impression from a living person, then after the person dies, their house creates the portrait. The portrait can give some biographical details of the subject and has a semblance of the subject’s personality.
Theo smiled, “Thanks, I like yours. Nice to meet you, too. I might not be back that soon, because I’m starting at Hogwarts in a bit.”
“Well you do, but sometimes you look ready, but then you want to spend another hour doing indiscernible things to your hair.”
Draco looked taken aback, “I know I’m not.” He was quiet for a moment, then started again tentatively, “I know all this is a lot, Potter. I know it is. That’s why I’m trying to help. It’s so much more er. Avalanchey if you don’t get on top of it in advance. This isn’t me trying to show you up. This isn’t about me at all or about you. It’s about Theodore.”
“It’s really disgusting,” Draco assured him. “Sometimes I think it would be better if it weren’t hot. But they tried improving the flavour about five years ago, so now it’s bitter, scalding, and tastes vaguely of banana. It’s a bit like eating a boiled banana skin, but without the interesting texture.”
Draco laughed, “I was going to. I assure you. Lubricus,” he added and glided slippery fingers over Harry’s cock. He raised his hips and positioned Harry against him, “I know I’m bossy, but you might do some of the work?”
They went to Ollivander’s next for Theo’s wand, and Harry suddenly remembered Dean Thomas had apprenticed with him when they found Dean behind the counter.
“Harry bloody Potter!” Dean came out from behind the counter to wring Harry’s hand and give him a friendly slap on the back. “It’s been ages. I nearly didn’t know you under all that hair! You’re not cutting it yourself, are you? One word for you: lineup.”
“All right, never mind. I’ve gone off that idea. I don’t mind being the only novelist, if I can prevent that.”
“Hmm,” said Theo, too well mannered to disagree with a compliment openly. “So how did you go from that to wanting to be a cursebreaker and get rid of monsters?”
“I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. Especially over something like that. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, and I’m sorry.”
“It went to me, actually. He’s just a kid, and I’m looking after him. And he isn’t a Black, he’s a Lupin!” Harry snapped.
But the box had split along the middle, each half falling aside to reveal what looked like a snippet of yew branch, covered over in soft gold. At once, the branch extended, wrapping itself around Malfoy’s fingertips. Malfoy gave a yell of pain and surprise, but even over his voice, Harry could hear another voice. A familiar high, sibilant voice that turned his stomach.
“Like I say, I thought you might like to see some nice magic. There’s more to the world than the bits that have hurt us,” Draco added quietly.
And then it was over. Draco was lying on the kitchen floor, in the shape of a lean, grey wolf. After a moment, he pushed himself up to sitting, lifted his head, and let out a long, sweet howl. Then he bent and sniffed Shadowfax, and let himself be sniffed in return before turning his attention to Harry.
“Oh no, don’t mention it,” Draco smirked, but it was that new smirk, and Harry quite liked it. “Tell me more about how funny and clever and handsome you find me. I’m rather enjoying it.”
“You’re excused from lessons and homework for the three days following a transformation, but if you need more time than that, let me know and I’ll write to Professor McGonnagall. All right?”
“Maybe I am,” Ginny turned a cunning look on Harry. “Are you hungry, Harry? Maybe been daydreaming about a lovely blond potato?” She grabbed for the biscuit tin in the centre of the table anyway.
Malfoy looked away first, and Harry realised he’d stopped chanting, though he hadn’t dropped Harry’s hand.
Theo’s face sort of flickered, and he tried to smile, “I sort of knew you from Granny’s photos. Did you know me? I suppose you haven’t seen me since I was small?” He grew his hair out all in a moment til it was long and blond like Draco’s, as if he thought that might help with the recognition, then seemed to think better of it and changed it back to its naturally mousy colour.
“Look Potter, I didn’t mean to put you on the spot earlier. As I say, it’s your book. I’m not trying to write it for you.”
“Lovely to have you. In that case, I’m not sure if you’re familiar with our menu at all. We do a selkie mermish fusion here. The menu is pre fixe, as people unfamiliar with those cuisines tend to find it a bit overwhelming to choose something from a list. The first course tonight is something we like to call swan feathers, though don’t worry; it’s nothing to do with feathers. They’re lovely and crispy, sort of our answer to breadsticks, served with a spicy kelp aioli. Then it’s an incredible braised eel for the main course. So tender it’s like biting into a wave. And for dessert, our fennel ice cream. Incredibly refreshing on the heels of the wild garlic in that braised eel. Now, while we work on the starter for you, would you like to try our flight of wild flower liqueurs?”
Draco shook his head, “I’ll be all right. This much’ll get me to the loo in a pinch, and I’ll be better still after I have another sleep. Thanks for breakfast. That helped a lot.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, “Exactly. Yes. Getting to know each other. That’s what I want, too. I want to know you better.”
“No trouble at all,” answered the cursebreaker in a cool, familiar voice that made the hair stand up on the back of Harry’s neck. The cursebreaker stepped forward, waving away the smoke that had built up in the Floo during Harry’s delayed answer and it was Draco Malfoy.
Harry Disapparated, and they reappeared in Diagon Alley’s Apparition area. He followed Ron to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Ron let them into the shop. Harry helped Ron arrange a display of the new line of Tickling Cloaks, and did not throw a wobbly.
“I’ll help too,” Harry offered. They each started at a new painting and carefully cut the enraged portraits out of their frames. Theodore using the knife and Harry and Draco both using Severing Charms. When they’d cut down every portrait that hung in the corridor, Draco sealed them all up with his wand and tucked them away inside his bag.
“I didn’t like. I didn’t feel emasculated or anything stupid like that. I wasn’t upset because Luna’s a woman. I just.” He sighed and dropped his voice, “At the time, I thought we were like. Perfect. And the idea that we weren’t and that you could just walk away made me feel like. I didn’t know anything about anything. I was. Scared.”
“Thanks, Dud. I know. But I’ve engaged a service that comes to your house and finds all the curses and monsters and gets rid of them, but you’ll never guess who turned up.”
“Off you go and have your tea like you promised while I sort that out with Draco,” said Harry firmly. “And I want to hear piano practise within the hour as well.”
“Well, you’ve already made well over the fundraising goal for the YLHC in advance ticket sales, so by that metric it’s a smashing success. And it’s a brilliant play,” Draco said firmly. “They’re going to love it. It’s going to be an absolute sensation. And we’ll be on either side of you the entire time. Moral support.”
“Christ no! I hope not! Obviously I want people to think about my work when they read it, but I’m not trying to supply anyone with pre-formed opinions.The stories I feel most impelled to tell aren’t an autobiographical account of my personal perspective. And if they were, I suspect they’d be quite soggy and not half so much fun. In writing at least. I hope people are having fun when they read my stuff. That was actually a major part of why I wanted to write fiction, so that people would have a bit of fun with it.”
Malfoy pressed his hand, “We can handle it.” He seemed to think better of it, “But it isn’t your job; it’s my job. If you’d rather not come in after we take the ward down-”
Harry swapped the mugs round so that Malfoy had the empty one and poured in a little milk, “Well, I am. I was a bit shocked, but I shouldn’t have been. Nosy. Rude.”
“Rabbits can be a bit delicate as well,” Draco advised. “I had to keep Scorpius in my dormitory mainly, which is likely why you didn’t know anything about him, Potter.”
Dean calmly extinguished the till with his own wand, “Not that one, then. Let’s see. Maybe the beech…”
Harry let out a little shout of laughter, “You found me!” He hugged Draco about the neck and kissed Draco’s nose, because it seemed appropriate to match his exuberance. Then Harry let himself ooze out of the wardrobe. Draco had started up his triumphant frolicking again, and Harry rather wanted to join in, but he was laughing too much. When they had calmed down a little, Harry took the Disillusionment Charm off himself and started counting down from a hundred again while Draco beetled off to hide. Shadowfax had gone to sleep on Harry’s bed, and stayed behind.
Harry was having lots of fun with Draco, who seemed keen on introducing Harry to new things. Magical cuisine Harry had never tasted. Magical places Harry had never visited. Silly things like quiz night at the Leaky Cauldron and mooncalf dances at the Magical Creatures Reserve in Ireland.
Draco answered with his mouth full, holding one hand daintily in front of his mouth, “Would I do that?”
Malfoy hefted the squirming sack, “You asked for a decontamination under some very specific conditions, and my superiors sent me to execute it. It’s my job to be here.”
“You can’t think your way into it,” she said with a shrug. “You just have to go out and get some experience. Take a chance. It’s a leap of faith.”
Ron chewed his lip, his face clouded,  “Nobody thinks you’re a fool, and nobody thinks you’re going to fly off the handle. We thought it would. Stir up bad memories to talk about Malfoy.”
Harry sprang forward and grabbed the top edge of Malfoy’s glove, just above his elbow and wrenched it down, forming a bag around the branch. To Harry’s relief, the glove and the branch came away with a tug, and though the branch writhed inside the glove and screeched in wordless fury, the glove held. Harry flung the whole thing back at the wooden box and shoved the pieces together. It reformed instantly, and the voice was silenced. Somewhere in the house, Mrs Black had begun screaming about cowards and blood traitors also.
“Mine’s got a unicorn hair core, and it certainly went happily along with Harry after he took it off me,” Draco said, gazing at Harry and not Dean.
Theo nodded and took another great bite of his sandwich before reaching out with his free hand to touch the old biscuit tin that they were using for a Portkey. With the old familiar jerk behind the navel and a swirling of their surroundings, Harry and Theodore were pulled through the Portkey and landed staggering in a field. Theodore nearly dropped his bacon sandwich into a cow pat, but managed to save it. Harry congratulated him on his quick reflexes, and they walked on to the school in companionable quiet.
“Isn’t it? Owing your life itself to this person. Being desperate to find them, and knowing they know you but having only the tiniest details about them. Tiny intimate details. Just the sound of their voice and their patronus.”
Draco was in bed when Harry went back to the room, his hair more disheveled than ever, but he smelled minty as if he’d just cleaned his teeth.
“Are you really all right, darling?” Harry stroked Draco’s hair back from his face. “You don’t have to say yes. We can talk about it.”
“You can’t really expect me to believe you didn’t know this was my house? I signed my name to my inquiry letter! Plus there’s the address you had to give to get here. I know you know it!”
“Oh are we finished with the seduction bit already?” Harry asked as Draco shoved away the blanket and shed his own pyjamas.
“So you wouldn’t say you’ve sort of fictionalised any part of your experience and ascribed it to Belle Brewer (the lead character of Potter’s novels)?”
Theo’s expression shadowed, “Are they alive? And you have to wait for them to die before you can destroy the picture?”
Harry stroked his back, “I’m so glad you enjoyed it. It’s a lot, isn’t it? Live theatre’s really intense sometimes.”
Harry was less prepared for that question. He drew a deep breath while he thought how to anwer, then looked at Draco for help.
that she had received for Christmas earlier that day and then sit still while she read it back to him and Rose, who had been attracted by the first recitation. Ron got tipsy and announced that it was all right with him if Harry wanted to go out with a toff, ignoring Hermione’s giggly shushing. And when Molly put on her Celestina Warbeck record, Andromeda had Draco out of his chair again to dance with her.
Draco took the water gratefully and gulped, “You’ll be in front of the Wizengamot on Statute of Secrecy charges if you’re not more careful, Harry. You didn’t even check if we’re alone.”
And Harry clasped Draco to him, kissed back gratefully when their mouths met, dragged his hands over every bit of Draco’s skin he could reach.
Harry was so flooded with affection for his godson that it brought tears to his eyes. He reached out and squeezed Theo’s shoulder,  “I’ll be fine, darling. I’ll have a Living Peace, if I have to.”
Draco shrugged, “Feels strange being back. More than I anticipated. I’m different now,” he added. “I don’t want to be mistaken for a person I don’t think much of anymore.”
“Here you are,” Draco echoed. He kissed Harry again, then reached for his wand, “Nox maxima.” The lamps were extinguished immediately, but there was a glimmer of orange light coming in from the street lamp outside the window. Draco replaced his wand on his night table and cuddled closer to Harry, disturbing Shadowfax who jumped off the bed.
Draco didn’t respond apart from a slow thump of his tail, so Harry found  the book he’d been reading down the side of his armchair and squeezed onto the sofa next to Draco. Draco rested his lovely head in Harry’s lap, and Harry rested his book on top of Draco’s head and sipped his drink.
The cock in question went from quite interested to completely hard so quickly that Harry got a bit dizzy and had to shut his eyes for a moment.
“Well, I like attending to you,” Draco said. “You’re always attending to me. Anyway Tergeo isn’t good for this. It leaves you sticky.”
“Planned a nicer date for when you were free and brought my best mate here to laugh at me for getting in my own way.”
“About my name. I think at Hogwarts, I want people to call me Theodore. I mean I want everyone to call me Theodore, and I thought it might be easiest to start at my new school.”
He crossed the room to Harry in one joyful bound, and Harry had the chance to appreciate just how very big Draco was in that form as two huge and heavy wolf paws landed on his shoulders, and Draco nuzzled wetly against his cheek, into his ear and down his neck.
Harry was feeling a little overwhelmed under the onslaught of questions, “He doesn’t transform yet, so this all feels a bit premature.”
Theo made a huffy sort of sound of annoyance, but at Harry’s raised eyebrows, he stumped off to the kitchen for his tea.
Dean rolled his eyes with evident affection, “Oh he’s up to his nose in wedding planning but convinced I don’t know a hydrangea from a satsuma. You’re coming to the wedding, yeah? Seamus’d never forgive me if I had you in the shop and didn’t make you promise.”
“We’ve just had a bit of a fright. There was a boggart in Theodore’s cupboard, and I thought it’d be best if we didn’t sleep at Grimmauld Place tonight. I don’t suppose you could spare a couple of beds?”
“Wow, congratulations!” said Kal, popping up again for another high five. “I finished at Hogwarts a couple of years ago. You must be really excited!”
“She’s definitely not my Ginny anybody.” Harry laughed, “Am I the only one who you still call by their surname?”
“Mmmmm,” Draco set his mug down. “Thank you so much.” And he shifted slightly to drop his head back onto his pillow, even though the tray was still half propped against his lap.
“Well, as I say I’m not going to beg you,” Malfoy said. He turned away and began to pack his Dark Detector into his satchel, “Perhaps you’re right, and there’s too much between us to work together effectively.”
Draco shrugged, “I wouldn’t’ve wanted anything to do with them if they hadn’t. Well. I got there eventually anyway.”
“Astute and nosy though you are, Potter, I hope you can accept that you do not know every teensy tiny detail about my past, present, and future. And anyway, this isn’t about you; it’s about Theodore.”
“There’s a start,” said Ron bracingly. “Want me to speak to Hermione? She could probably find a book or something. Or knows someone you could talk to through the DRCMC.”
“If you imply that I’m romantic again,” said Draco, pinking in the cheeks and looking delighted. “I shall turn you into a racoon.”
“Yes, it’s packed,” Theodore’s voice came out smaller than usual, and Harry was immediately awash in regret for speaking to him impatiently. He still looked quite peaky.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “You’re totally right. Our obsession with our own superiority, our exceptionalism sort of poisons our relationships with all our neighbours, doesn’t it? Muggles, lycanthropes, centaurs, merfolk, elves, goblins, veela, everyone. But we’re all intelligent. We all have culture and values and insight. And we all deserve to have equal influence over how our world functions. It doesn’t belong to wizards more than it does to anyone else.”
“You’re right, Theodore,” Draco agreed. “Grimmauld Place does sound dreadful. And I expect you’ve got an idea or two on what might be better.”
The hostess showed them to a table that looked as if it had been cut from the stone of the islet, “Your server will be with you shortly.” And then she was gone. Harry didn’t see where she disappeared to.
Harry hadn’t been expecting that, and he held out his left hand, feeling rather conscious of how dusty and grubby it was. Malfoy’s hand was cool and soft, as if he’d just washed it. He held onto Harry firmly, like there wasn’t a reason in the world why he shouldn’t.
“Yeah, well I’ve run out of guest rooms, and you told me this one isn’t dangerous--hello darling, aren’t you beautiful? Oooh! Steady on, now.”
Draco nodded, and they collected their coats, then  walked out of the theatre to the pavement, where the January night air flew past refreshing to a deep, sharp chill. Their noses began to run nearly at once.
“Then why would we need to decontaminate the house? All that cursed stuff is so old, so why doesn’t it stop like the pictures do?”
“It’s settled then,” Theodore said, proudly, circling THE GLADE where it was written on the kitchen wall. And so it was settled.
Hermione considered, “He’s quieter now. Not so desperate for attention. Sort of reserved in fact. And he’s more polite. Most of the time. And he’s really passionate about his cause. That’s when he gets a bit rude. He can be a bit. Pushy.”
When Harry unlocked Regulus’ room and let Malfoy into it, he made a little hum of surprise and dismay.
“Why can’t I stay for the cursebreaking?” Theo asked while he waited for his Portkey and picked at the remains of his breakfast. His hair was in dark curls that morning, quite like Harry’s. It made Harry feel both rather flattered and a sense of foreboding, considering that Theodore was saying exactly what Harry would have said at his age.
“Thank you,” Draco said uneasily. Then, “I think I’m supporting Hufflepuff, actually. I’d just as soon have one like yours.”
“Don’t say girlfriend, Potter, or I’ll hex you. I’ve already made it crystal clear that I’m a homosexual, haven’t I? Astoria’s like my younger sister, except she doesn’t have my rubbish parents. I swear you’ll like her. She’s terribly funny and clever. Shades of your Ginny Weasley, actually.”
Draco nodded emphatically, “Yes! Well, it doesn’t need to be about lycanthropes specifically, but yes it should be, and I’ll help you!”
Malfoy had gone pale when Harry reached for him, but now for some reason, he was blushing, “Very astute of you. But I hope you’ll excuse me. I can’t really bear to confront the worst night of my life at the moment, particularly not on an empty stomach.”
“Nah, well still in London, but I’m over on Grimmauld Place now. I needed the extra room. How’s Seamus?”
Harry took quite a long time to find Draco, eventually discovering him lying flat on his belly in a bathtub on the third floor. Draco found Harry behind a heavy set of drapes in the portrait gallery somewhat more easily. Harry found Draco in the pantry, and it turned out that he was hungry, so they stopped their game for a snack.
Harry was wondering idly if offering cake would be showing off, when Theo put down the last bite and a half of his sandwich and looked at Draco.
“I thought you would probably want to go somewhere in the muggle world so that people don’t gawp at you,” Draco explained as he stepped back to let Harry out of the house. “And I live in Islington, so I just walked.”
“Good morning, Theodore. Potter,” Draco handed Harry one of the cups, then dug in his jacket pocket and handed Theo a paper bag. “Just a bun. In case you missed breakfast.”
“So touchy,” Draco sighed. “Actually I didn’t buy the magazine because of your face. I was dying to read what you had to say about the books, of course.”
Draco conjured a sort of settee and gestured to it, then sank onto it after Harry, “He was my cousin as well, wasn’t he? Your godfather.”
And Draco drew him close, lifted his chin, and kissed him. A warm little query of a kiss. And Harry tried to answer, yes, yes, yes. Yes!
Harry thought it might be bad form to laugh, “Yes, I actually knew that already. Thanks,” he added. “Apology accepted.” Then he continued rather stiffly, “Sorry for that time in the bathroom. I’d no idea what that curse did, or I never would have cast it on you.”
“Good, now I’ll incant to dissolve it. You just let it pass by and go.” Malfoy looked at Harry, “Relax. I can see you clutching. It won’t go if it doesn’t have your permission.”
Harry caught Draco’s hand and kissed it, “Oh is it for my benefit?" He received a little more shoving, but he quite enjoyed it.
“I haven’t told Granny yet,” Theodore said rather fretfully. “I don’t think she would like it. I think she really likes me being Teddy.”
Harry thought Draco would spring past and run for home base, and he pushed himself up, ready to give chase. But Draco only gamboled about triumphantly, bumping heavily against Harry’s knees, and several times nearly treading on Shadowfax, who was insistently underfoot.
“And I’ve spoken to her healer, and we can have a little visit tomorrow. Straight after school, okay?”
After they took their seats, which were warm stone, possibly warmed from inside, Harry looked up at the sky. It was the dusky colour of a shadow, and didn’t give the slightest hint that they were actually inside a smallish restaurant in Islington. He noticed that Draco’s shirt was the exact same twilight colour as the sky and also that it matched his eyes.
Harry’s ears were going hot, and he dug in his money bag for the gold to pay for Theo’s wand so that he could avert his face.
Harry felt strongly that if he didn’t leave quickly, he’d make some sort of unseemly sound of surprise and hilarity, “We’ll tell him you said hello. Come on, Theo.”
On Saturday morning, after a hasty breakfast following a certain amount of dawdling from Theodore, Harry and Theo took a muggle bus to the Youth Lycanthropy Health Centre, which looked from the outside like one of those cramped and musty old shops that sells hideous antiques by appointment only. Inside, it was clean and spacious and surprisingly modern for a wizarding building, with lots of angular furniture and white tile floors.
“I do understand the importance of having a decent homelife, actually! And I’d never have sent him to the Black family looking for one! Being raised as the heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black is the last thing in the world either of his parents would have wanted for him! And no wonder, since it was full of blood supremacists and murderers!”
“I’m very sorry that I was such a horrid little tick to you at school,” Malfoy said. Then after a pause in which he looked hard at Harry’s face til Harry wondered if he had jam on him as well. “And I’m sorry for the time I trod on your nose in particular.”
“It makes you like your dad,” Harry added, having found his voice. “And he was one of the kindest, cleverest people Hogwarts ever saw.”
“Weren’t no chickens fed, and you know it,” Hagrid muttered, going over to the fireplace to warm himself.
“But you’re so nice now,” Theodore objected as if he suspected again that they were teasing him somehow. “You got the ghoul out of my room.”
“My wand’s fine. I’ve actually come in with my godson,” Harry stepped back and nudged Theodore forward, “My godson Theodore Lupin.”
Harry laughed, “I’m trying to say that I can’t just be all helter skelter this time, even though I’d really like to. Er.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “I really feel like I was the one being jostled, and you were doing the jostling.
“But it isn’t a living thing itself. Most old magical houses like this are enchanted to make them. It just needs to be connected to a magical house or the spell wears down. We put them in a sort of insulated chamber, and the magic leaks out over a while, and they stop moving or speaking. But it isn’t death, because there isn’t real life to begin with. ”
“Ergh,” Harry shuddered. “I usually give Theo some ice cream afterward. The first time, I didn’t think he’d be able to get it down.”
When Harry opened his palm to look at it, it opened its miniscule beak and spoke aloud in Draco’s voice, “I shouldn’t be at all cross if you decided to drop into my room this morning. Quick as you like.” Harry smiled and tucked the crane into his pyjama pocket, then got out of bed.
Here Harry was interrupted because the Floo buzzed again, and Theo jumped out a moment later, nearly banging into Malfoy.
“Thanks petal.” Ginny turned to Harry, shaking her head, “Come on, Harry. I thought you were past this. Can’t we just try and get along?”
Draco laughed, “Good lord. This is you at fifty percent is it? What a sobering thought.” He sipped from his hot chocolate, “How did it go? What did he say?”
On their way out, they stopped at the welcome desk, and the welcome wizard gave them some leaflets on the counseling and potioneering sessions, as well as some informational pamphlets. Harry took every one he suggested and came away with a thick stack with titles like
Draco pressed a hand to his heart and pretended to swoon, “Handsome on purpose, am I? Do tell! What am I doing on purpose to make myself so handsome, Potter?”
Draco watched a fairy land on a water lily and wipe its tiny brow, “Well. Your first name is on the tip of my tongue. But every time I nearly say it, I feel a bit.”
“I know.” Harry felt his own eyes start to tingle, “And I suppose I acted just how you were afraid I would.”
Harry’s brief silence appeared to make Draco rather nervous, “Is it all right with you if I seduce you now? It won’t be at all fun if you don’t enjoy it as much as I do, so do speak up.”
Theo returned his attention to Draco’s arm, where his sleeve was still pushed up and noticed the bite scar for the first time, “Did the cursed thing have teeth and bite you?”
“I just need a chalkboard to show you the options I thought of. Oh, and to compare them to yours and decide which we all like better,” Theodore added. “We could put it to a vote.”
“Not only for me, though. You didn’t only save me. Everyone was.” He let out a heavy breath through his nose. “And you stopped it.”
He’d had a cup of tea in the kitchen out of his Chudley Cannons mug and a slice of toast and a soft boiled egg. He’d dressed in his baggy Harpies jumper that he’d nicked from Ginny when they were engaged and his old Quidditch leggings from his Seeker days at Hogwarts. They were worn almost through at the knees, and he liked to fiddle with the barest patch when he was stuck on a difficult sentence. He’d carried a cup of coffee into the library and locked the door behind him, then switched on his wireless loud enough to hear but too quiet to make out any lyrics. Then he sat down at his desk to read through the last page or two of his manuscript aloud. So far so good.
“This is brilliant magic,” Harry looked around eagerly, scanning again for the musicians. “That’s really thoughtful of you,” he turned his gaze back to Draco. “Thank you for bringing me here.”
Draco was going pink again, belying his nonchalant tone when he answered, “Excellent. I’ll collect you at half seven. Muggle clothes. See you tomorrow night.” He leaned in, and Harry’s heart began to riot in his ribcage, but at the last moment with a glance at the dregs of the crowd, Draco only squeezed Harry’s hand, then stepped back and Disapparated with a pop.
Whatever it was, Harry had to put it aside to prepare for Theodore’s arrival. There was a tremendous amount to be done. Several of the rooms he had simply sealed up by magic, as there was no use for them and plenty that needed seeing to in the rooms they were to actually live in. He’d selected a guest room for Theodore and practically gutted it. The grimy, faded wallpaper and ancient carpet had been torn out and replaced, along with the furniture. Harry gave the room a fresh coat of paint, but apart from laying a thick rug on the floor, a twinkly star patterned duvet on the new bed and hanging a poster of the solar system on the wall as a nod to Theodore’s current space obsession, Harry had decided to leave most of the decorating to the room’s new occupant. He did rehang an old tapestry, as he felt it looked nice with the poster.
“Huh. I suppose I hadn’t really thought about Belle falling in love,” Harry said slowly. “Dnno how I’d do with a romantic story.”
Harry sat down on the bed and kissed him, “I didn’t know you wanted me lying next to you the whole time like a very big teddy. Are you hungry?”
Harry hesitated a moment, then admitted, “If I watch something scary before bed, I’ll have terrible nightmares and not be able to sleep again til the sun comes up.”
Up close, Harry noticed that although he’d thought the wooden object was a box, there didn’t seem to be any opening or even a seam to show where it had shut, “Are you sure there’s something inside?”
“Oh goodness,” Draco sat down beside Harry. “Lord and lady, Harry. You came out right in the middle of a quidditch match?”
“Are you? Would you come and have a look at my room? There was something really horrible in the cupboard the other day. I can hardly sleep for wondering if it’s back.”
“Excellent. I wanted you to know that I’ve checked over the house, and there isn’t anything Dark or dangerous left in it, so you’ve nothing to worry about in future. Nothing here is going to hurt you.”
Harry was having a good writing day. He hadn’t been expecting one. Good writing days required adherence to all his writing rituals, and he wasn’t sure if they’d quite feel like home at Grimmauld Place, and he might need to work out some new ones or make adjustments. But they had felt cosy and familiar like a well worn jumper, even in the strange place. He was very pleased.
They ambled along for a bit while Harry thought how to say what wanted saying. It was a remarkably fine evening, and it was very easy to be content in it.
Draco’s eyes went very wide in a way that was even higher praise than his quite lavish compliments, “Right now? I could read a bit of your new book well before it’s come out?”
Theo took a crunchy bite and answered with his mouth full, “I will.” Theo’s hair was blue-black that morning, rather blending in with his cap so that his head seemed to be peaked and not only his hat. There was also a new scattering of freckles over his face that Harry supposed was inspired by their night at the Burrow, surrounded by Weasleys. Harry enjoyed these little tweaks through which Theo showed his clannishness. It filled him with affection for his whole family.
“I don’t mind if you see,” Draco said carelessly. Then added, “I do have to take all my clothes off, first.”
Harry frowned, “Is that what you’d say if there were a boggart in Rosie’s cupboard, and she woke up screaming in the middle of the night because it attacked her? Oh I’m not a bad father; it’s just one of those things. Can’t be helped. Go easy on yourself.”
“Oh.” Draco tossed his silky hair, “Well then calling it a familiar is simply one of our few non-rubbish traditions, and I’m not going to toss it aside simply to avoid your chaffing.”
Harry shrugged, “‘S’all right. Didn’t the Healer say it was interacting with your Mark? I expect that’s why it grabbed you like that.”
“It vibrates when it detects Dark spells or objects. There’s something quite seriously cursed in here. Please tell me you haven’t been using the room regularly.”
“Riddikulus!” Harry bellowed, and the boggart exploded into dust, which glittered in the air for a moment, then settled dingily to the carpet. Harry turned to Theodore, “You okay?”
“That’s all right,” Harry patted Hagrid’s elbow as his boots reconnected with the ground. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt your visit.”
Draco only bumped against Harry’s legs again and ambled sleepily toward his room, Shadowfax at his heels.
“Thank you,” Harry sipped from the cup, expecting coffee or perhaps tea, but it was hot chocolate. “We should probably go through so that Theo can get onto the train.”
“Then I need advice,” Theodore said rather dramatically, pushing up his spectacles. “Everyone here is too cute. You’ve got to help me work out which I like best.”
“Good,” Malfoy holstered his Dark Detector and got out his notebook. His falcon feather quill flashed across the page, “I don’t suppose you know anything about the former occupant?”
Draco shook his head in amazement, “Really something, those muggles. Like,” He nodded at the television and took another bite of pasta. “I can’t believe that’s a thing, and I just. Had no idea. It’s.
“I. Am trying to be er. Measured and responsible. Which is a bit new for me, because I’m used to just doing things as soon as I notice I want to.”
“Missing him. Wishing I could get his advice or just talk to him again. I thought I’d come in here, and be knocked out with it. But it’s not like that now. He seems just as far away as he did before I opened the door, and that’s sad on its own, I suppose. But I can bear it.”
“We don’t usually pay house calls at the weekend,” Malfoy said thoughtfully. “But I can come back tomorrow if you really would rather have it out as soon as possible. Wouldn’t blame you.”
Malfoy licked jam off his finger and after a moment’s thought, took another scone, “Milk, please. Milk first please. You don’t sound sorry.”
“Well I never met another one before,” said Theo stoutly. Then added apologetically, “Sorry. I think my granny thinks they-we’re not very nice.”
“Well you didn’t have to ambush me, if you wanted to hear from me. You could have done something. Normal.” The kettle whistled, and Harry turned his attention back to the tea, “Do you mind teabags? I fucking hate loose leaf.”
“It seems to have had a very specific effect on you,” Harry tweaked Draco’s hair away from his face to watch him blush.
Draco fell asleep after the film ended, and after several very pleasant minutes of being softly snored against by Draco and death-glared at by Shadowfax, Harry very gently extricated himself and got up. He went out on the stoop to watch the sunset, just for a breath of fresh air. He could still smell Draco on his clothes, even out in the open, and it made him smile.
“Well, I’ve promised myself I’m not going to talk about Harry Potter, so I’m afraid I can’t satisfy your intrigue on that point.”
“And you want to make sure I don’t fly off the handle or obsess over Draco Malfoy like I’m sixteen. And you laugh about it right to my face, and it makes me feel like an absolute fool.”
“Hi, yes. Very welcome. Should be done in a few minutes. Thanks,” Harry took the pinafore off anyway and tossed it onto the sofa before coming to kiss Draco hello on the cheek, “That okay?”
Something about the sound of his name in Draco’s mouth sent a little zing of excitement straight to Harry’s groin. He shifted in his seat to press his knee more firmly against Draco’s, “This is going to sound very Victorian of me, but you’ve somehow made it really hot to hear my name from you.”
“You really do this all on your own every single month?” Harry asked, offering the Strengthening Solution again.
When Harry returned to the room a quarter of an hour later with two plates of bacon and eggs and two cups of tea on a tray, Draco was sitting up properly, leaning back against the headboard. He was wearing the nightshirt and had clearly made some sort of effort to smooth his disheveled hair.
“Oh yes,” Draco sounded a little wobbly. “Just savouring.” He Vanished the handkerchief, but his eyes continued to stream so that he was forced to Conjure another.
Draco shunted Shadowfax gently to the floor, and stood, shrugging off his dressing gown. He was panting hard, a soft whine coming up in the back of his throat. Harry noticed suddenly that there was dense, silver fur rising on Draco’s limbs. Draco doubled over with a deep groan, and Harry could hear painful cracks as his bones stretched and shifted.
Theodore shook his head, “No, this is my first time here.” Harry noticed for the first time that there was a framed photo of the staff behind the welcome desk. Standing beside Priti in the second row was Draco, waving and beaming. One of those expressions Harry had never seen before. Harry averted his eyes, as if the real Draco might come round the corner and catch him looking.
Harry checked his watch as well. He wasn’t sure why, “Do you want privacy? I could leave. I mean go to my room.”
“Theodore,” Harry began when they were waiting at a zebra crossing outside of Diagon Alley. “I’m sorry about earlier.”
Harry lowered his voice and trained his eyes on his mug, “I’m bad at this. I don’t know how. I barely know how to look after Theo even without making it more complicated.”
“Yeah!” agreed Theodore, setting down a plate of pancakes at the table. “And I made the pancakes with chocolate bits in them, and that always makes it a good day.”
“Er I would be remiss, and Theo would certainly think so, if I didn’t ask you to stay and have it with us. I cook other nice things, not only scones. My bread is nice. I could do you some beans on toast or a bacon butty.”
Harry staggered under the weight, “All right! Don’t knock me down now!” He steadied himself with a hand on Draco’s back, and his fingers all but vanished into the dense, soft fur.
Harry kissed his rosy cheek, “If you say so. Darling.” Draco drew out his wand menacingly, but Harry only kissed him again.
“I’d like to get you something,” Draco announced as they stepped into the cool darkness of the shop. “A post owl or a familiar. Whatever you like.”
Harry grinned, “Thanks Hagrid. I’ll have to bring you some other books to tide you over til this one comes out of the oven.”
Malfoy frowned, “Well. It’s been all right so far. But no, no I think you’d be better off with a ward. It’d be irresponsible of me to go away without warding it.” Malfoy took off his bag and set it down on the floor,  “Are you familiar with partner wards?”
“Hermione’s all right, but I shouldn’t like Theo to feel like I was noising his business about the whole family, so maybe not your mum. She can be a bit er.”
When Harry came out to meet him, Draco was standing on the hearthrug with an overnight bag slung over his shoulder and a wicker hamper in his arms.
Draco shrugged, “My second boyfriend was muggle-born and he seemed to think I would get something out of those Lord of the Rings books, so he made me read all of them.”
“I thought I was a bad influence? Or have you changed your mind so quickly? Maybe you’ve decided that there’s more to being a decent person than having decent parents and more to being a bad person than having bad parents? There’s more to moral development than having been born on the right side.” Malfoy said over the last of his scone.
“Of course!” Harry reached across the table and patted Theodore’s shoulder. “Is it all right if I sometimes call you Theo?”
“Yes, thank you,” said Draco. “And sparkling water for the table, if you have it. Or would you prefer still?” He looked at Harry.
“Have you got a wolfsbane source yet? Some people just go to the apothecary, but they just have whoever’s on duty when your order comes up brew it, and it helps a lot to have a specific potioneer you get it from so that the formula is more consistent. And there’re workshops that teach you how to brew it yourself as well. Some people choose confinement over wolfsbane, but it’s really not recommended for such young patients, because it can cause adverse outcomes in terms of mental health.”
Harry was surprised when Draco rang his doorbell to collect him for their outing instead of coming through the Floo.
“No, that isn’t what I mean!” Draco considered for a moment, “You said Belle Brewer isn’t you, and you wouldn’t want to write about yourself anyway, but. You also want to help people see into lives that aren’t their own. You should write a play. About us. Not you and me, but about our world, the world that already is. Help people understand that they’re not looking at all of it. Put it right in front of their faces, and make them see!”
“That was some very quick thinking, Potter,” said Malfoy in a faint voice. Then he slipped forward out of his chair, and his head lolled toward his knees in a swoon.
“Good,” Malfoy had gentled his voice, in aid of Harry’s relaxation apparently. “Now look at me.” Harry obeyed, though it made his ears warm. “Good,” Malfoy murmured again and began to incant.
Harry opened his mouth furiously, but realised he was indeed worked up, so shut it with a click, and tried to calm himself with first a long swig of gillywater and then counting down from ten and then twenty and then thirty.
Malfoy donned his protective gloves, then raised his Dark Detector and stepped into the room. Harry followed close behind him, pulling on his own protective gear. The Dark Detector was vibrating so hard that Harry could hear its high buzzing against Malfoy’s  gloves, like the whine of some tiny insect. Dust clouded up round their boots when they trod on the ancient rug, and Harry was grateful for the face covering that protected his nose and mouth. Apart from the dust thick on every surface, the room was pin neat.
“Fun, yeah! Fun is important. I think our self-seriousness is behind a lot of our social ills, actually.”
“Yes, all right. I don’t typically discuss where I like to piss on second dates, so let’s call the subject closed, if you don’t mind.”
Harry’s own ears were getting hot, but he couldn’t help laughing, “You’re clearly being handsome on purpose; you can’t act all surprised when people notice.”
“Well,” Draco’s hand slid up Harry’s chest and around to the back of his head, where he began to play sproingy games in Harry’s coils.
“Of course,” said Harry promptly. He looked about them, then pulled Draco into the narrow alley between the theatre and the building next to it, hugged Draco to him again and Disapparated.
Draco shut his eyes helplessly. “I really like beards,” he mumbled. “That wasn’t the only reason, of course. But.”
Harry glanced about him to see if Theo was in eavesdropping range, but judging by the distant shouts, Theo was still trying to have a game of one on one quidditch with Victoire in a neighbouring field.
“Ouch!” Harry dropped his hand at once. The handle was buzzing so sharply, Harry felt almost as if he’d been stung. “What was that?”
“What?” snapped Harry. “What?! Why are you looking at each other like that? Don’t tell me you already knew?”
“Love’s not trivial and selfish, Harry,” Hagrid said seriously, coming back to the table from the fireplace. “And there’s more to it than sacrifice. You can look after your godson without losing yourself in it.”
Draco sat back on his haunches, his tail thumping hard against the kitchen floor, and cocked his head.
“The first time is the worst,” Draco dug his fork into his helping of steak and kidney pie with relish. “This looks scrumptious. Though I think I could probably be wheedled into ice cream afterward.”
Draco came first, groaning and shaking, but it seemed to Harry that it was only by moments because the trembling of Draco’s body and the hot splash of Draco’s come against him pushed Harry into his own orgasm. With a grunt, Draco collapsed off Harry as completely as if his bones had turned suddenly to pasta. Harry wanted to cuddle him close, but didn’t feel capable of very coordinated movement, so he groped about and found Draco’s hand and kissed it and brought it to his heart.
After a little more pie, and a leisurely helping of ice cream, Draco got up from his seat, checked his watch, and looked out of the window, “Won’t be long now.”
“Of course it isn’t real.” Harry paused, not sure how much of an explanation he should provide, “Brains are very good at working out patterns because it helps you stay alive. You know that sort of berry makes you puke if you eat it. That sort of animal will take a bite off you if you try for a cuddle. Dirty water will have you up with your tummy all night if you drink it. The thing is, well before you were born, a load of scary things happened to me, and my brain got used to it.
“I know you didn’t,” Harry told him. “I don’t expect you to understand everything in the world before anyone’s told you about it. It’s okay not to know something, and it’s okay to ask if you want to find out. That’s a little bit different, though. Asking someone if they’re gay. Do you understand how it’s different?”
Harry turned to see what Theodore was aiming for and sickening horror rose in him when he saw. In the mouth of Theodore’s cupboard, a horrible figure slunk out of its shadows, wolf-headed but man-shaped, gangling and hairy, it’s long arms nearly dragging on the ground, its toothy jaws opened in a snarl and frothed with drool.
After they finished in Eyelops, Draco said he needed to be off, which made Harry feel ashamed again. They walked him to the Apparition area, and Theodore made Draco promise to come see him off on the Hogwarts Express, and Draco promised readily enough.
“Er a bit. He was my godfather--your cousin, I suppose--my godfather’s younger brother, Regulus. He was a Death Eater, but he was a saboteur. Stole things from Voldemort and hid them in order to bollocks up his plans. I thought it was only one thing, actually. A locket. But it must have been more than one if there’re still Dark objects here, since I saw the locket destroyed years ago. It was seriously cursed, though, like you say. Tried to kill me.”
“Well, yeah, but actually that’s the other thing that’s bothering me. We cleaned the house ages ago. And then I went over it again before we moved in. But there was still some monster lurking in it, ready to jump out and get my godson!”
“You have such  a poetical mind, Theodore,” Draco said fondly, kissing Harry’s cheek as Theodore was on the other side of the table and not in reach. “I suppose you take after your godfather.”
Dean frowned a little, “Hmm, that’s unusual. It does happen, though. Sometimes the wand’ll sense a powerful affinity, and decide that’s as good as permission.”
“No,” said Harry firmly. “It’s all right that you were scared of the boggart. That’s the whole point of boggarts. But you’re not allowed because you’re a kid, and I’m a grownup, and it’s my job to see that you’re safe. Okay?”
Draco burst out laughing, “Yes, it was terribly childish. I might have made better decisions if I’d had a friend like you, steering me right.”
Andromeda was dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief again. “That’s lovely, dear,” she said weakly. “I’ll give it a good read.”
“Are you really going to laugh at me about not knowing what muggle things are and then not tell me? What’s an astronaut? Can you get it in a shop?”
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow, “I never saw your inquiry letter. Our custom is to assess the client’s needs in person, so it wasn’t considered necessary.” He hesitated a moment, as if wondering what he could get away with, “Of course I did recognise the address as one of the homes formerly belonging to my family, but so many of those old family homes have been sold or seized and repurposed since the war. I see a lot of once familiar houses changed over into flats or shops or village schools.” He smiled another smile that Harry had never seen before, “I was gratified to find my youngest cousin living here. I’m glad that the last Black family home should go to the last of the Blacks.”
Harry expected Draco to either admit that they had hated each other at Hogwarts or to try and politely defer, but he was surprised when Draco did neither.
Theodore was loitering over a bite or two of pie crust when they came down to the kitchen, but after a gentle prompt from Harry, went off to practise piano with a good enough will. Harry put the kettle on, and Malfoy accepted a scone after being asked twice.
Draco gasped and gave Harry a little shove, “I am beautiful as the day, and you repay me with slander.”
“It’s not fine! I can’t believe we decided to book the move for the same week as the premier. We’ve both gone insane. Theo’s going into care, because his guardians are unfit.”
“Of course I would.” After a moment’s thoughtful silence, Draco added, “I think I told you quite a bit ago that you’ve got me wanting something only you can give me. Now I’ve seen a play, I’m dying to see a Harry Potter play. You don’t have to write about lycanthropes, or anything you don’t want to, and you don’t have to write a play at all if you’d rather not. Obviously. You’re already great as it is. I just think. Here’s a historic space, all ready for you to step in and fill. Something we’ve never had before that you could give us. Something huge that isn’t. Tragedy. Or sacrifice. Something beautiful.”
Harry knew he shouldn’t be shocked. Theodore was a bright child, and his grandmother was quite an old woman with a serious illness. Harry took a deep breath and reached for calm, “I want to tell you that Granny’s going to be fine. I hope-we all hope she will. But that isn’t the sort of thing you can know in advance, Theodore. Sometimes things work out how they should, and sometimes. They don’t. The healers at St. Mungo’s are very good indeed, and they’re going to do everything they can. Spattergroit is nasty, but they’ve seen it loads of times before, and they know what to do.”
