Draco said nothing, not sure how to explain away an owl in his hotel room. It hadn’t been there when he came in a few minutes before. It had worn a ribbon marked as a portkey on its other leg. The bird had apparently been portkeyed directly into his room and would likely portkey back now that its delivery had been made.
“Hi, my name is Draco— I’m from London, England, and I’m 25 years old,” Draco told the camera. In boy garb, he styled his pale blond hair short and parted on the side. He wore a crisp grey button-down shirt and flashed a dazzling smile.
“Did that really just happen?” Weasley asked.
“Well, that was unexpected,” Mike said. “Draco certainly knows how to use her body to play to the camera, and how to get a model to react a certain way,” he explained tactfully. “Although I’m not sure Courtney Act appreciated it.”
“Ha! He hated the rest of us, but he was always fascinated with you. Barely had time for anyone else in Slytherin.”
“CUT!” Michelle cried. The three looked at her. Lorena paused with the drumstick still in her mouth. “Take it down a notch, or we won’t get the episode past the censors,” she warned.
Late that night, Draco sipped at his cognac as he thought about the prophecy and the ensuing conversation at dinner in the Great Hall.
Draco looked down at her flat feet self-consciously.
It wasn’t until he reached his old Charms classroom when Draco realized that not only had he fled a loo by saying he needed to use one — he paused at this epiphany to gently beat his head against the stone wall of the corridor — but he had also ruined an opportunity to ask Potter for his assistance in the ritual that would help Crabbe move on. He banged his head a little harder at that thought.
“Now I’m really curious,” Lady Cakes said. “What else do you have in there?”
“Sometimes you have to show a little skin,” Draco lip synced with a flirtatious grin. She twirled one leg in a knee-high white sock around the pole before spinning and swinging herself upside down into the splits, her yellow plaid miniskirt falling to reveal yellow plaid knickers. “This reminds guys of being naked. And then they think of sex!”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked gently.
.” Lady Cakes held her by the shoulders. “You can do this. Just make some shit up. Think of Beyoncé like a blank slate and just do something totally outside the box. And if that fails, we gonna pray.”
Finally, there was his relationship with his fellow queens. This had been another intense journey over the past several weeks. Sure, they ribbed and sniped at each other. But even that reminded him of life in Slytherin House. It almost felt like they were becoming a family to him. Again, he caught himself wondering what would happen after he left the show. Would he still connect to them once he returned to the wizarding world?
Draco ignored the rebuke and set about collecting the rest of his son’s books as quickly as possible. One might say that he fled the store after paying. But he was already having such a rough time with things, so I’m going to be charitable and let him off the hook this time.
“Now,” RuPaul continued, “You will each have thirty minutes to make over your partner’s face. We’ve blacked out the mirrors to keep it a surprise,” he explained. “The queen who paints the best face wins. We’ll start with the queen on the left painting the queen on the right, and then switch. On your mark, get set,

Jason Isaacs raised an eyebrow. “I’m going to say that she
Draco’s smile fell and his eyes darted around. “Who told you that?!”
“Shall we show them Goldie’s trick next?” Draco asked, then turned to the audience. “Who wants to see Goldie hide the salami?” The audience cheered.
“That’s taking away her agency!” Crabbe shouted back. “She got enough of that from her dad. Death was the only matter that gave Ophelia any agency!”
“Do you use that word in the states,
“Um, I just want to say that I think I would be a good president,” Goldie said. “Our country needs a makeover, and I’m...gonna give it one. If elected.” She smiled nervously and shrugged.
“Thanks in advance,” Crabbe said. “Maybe I’ll see you on the other side — whatever that is.” He grinned, shook out his ghostly limbs, then gave him the thumbs-up sign.

“How are you feeling, Miss Lady Cakes?” Paris Davenport asked.
“Really?” Draco asked at the camera, raising one eyebrow.
“Good evening, I am Puerto Rico — um, I am Lorena Gucci, and we need more Puerto Rico in US government. And sexy. Vote for me and Make America Sexy Again.” Lorena smiled stiffly at the camera and lifted her hand in a pageant wave.
She threw her hands up over her head and launched herself forward, landing on her hands and pushing back up into a forward flip. What happened next may have to be chalked up to a combination of stress, determination, lack of sleep, and accidental magic.
“Hmm. And you think that your talking about potions and cauldrons on national TV is safe because muggles don’t know any better?”
“Let’s keep this ball rolling! Category is...Sexy Vacation Realness!” RuPaul announced.
Steve-as-Taylor-Swift dropped her jaw in shock.
He was a little worried that this ignorance would catch up with him sooner or later. But for now, he would continue to rise to the challenges as best as he could.
Eventually, everyone was out of drag, the cameras turned off, and the queens returned to their hotel. Draco entered his room that night to find a bag with Courtney Act’s cake-smeared wig and dress lying on the bed. He cast a few cleaning charms until the items were back to mint condition, then conjured a bouquet of yellow roses in a crystal vase. He wrote a quick apology note on the hotel stationery and carried it with the flowers and the bag down to the front desk to have them delivered.
Intoxia-as-Carrie held up her card. “I said
Well, let’s be honest. The Malfoy name hadn’t garnered that much respect since before the war. And there was the other matter that Draco preferred not to think about too often; he couldn’t claim to be part of that family anymore. But he still hadn’t been prepared for a muggle who barely knew her to make her feel so inconsequential.
“Now, sign here to allow Gringotts to forward the tax payment directly to the DOUR,” Malfoy continued as Harry scribbled his signature. “Sign this form to tell Gringotts to mail your bank statements on plain instead of lavender-colored parchment, and this other form to tell the Ministry the same.” Harry scribbled.
“Steve Donovan, you are safe.” Steve fell to her knees and sobbed. Kali and Ivana both sighed in resignation. Draco couldn’t help the small smile at seeing Kali in the bottom two.
“Well,” he said, finally, “I might have said something rude to her once or twice when we were younger.”
“Chin up,” Draco said, “We’ll watch the episode together tomorrow. Then you and I can plan a performance that you can be in, too.”
— honey, this is
“Paris Davenport.”

Harry closed his eyes and tried to push back the smoke that threatened to come out of his ears. He could remain calm. “I’m sorry,” he said after a moment. “How did he die?”
silhouette.”
She shook her head. “This book covers a broad range of topics, but none of them in much depth. I don’t see anything in here that would help troubleshoot the ritual. The ritual itself is all the troubleshooting the author can offer for dealing with a ghost in the first place.”
“I can’t make any guarantees,” he warned. “But I hope it helps you feel a little better.”
“They say they’ve never heard of you before you showed up on
“And Kali—” Draco turned to Kali— “What
Everyone clapped.

That was Draco’s cue to shrug at the audience in her yellow plaid suit and whip her long, sandy-blonde hair around. “I’m like totally buggin’!”
henge in
Draco and Potter looked at each other awkwardly for a moment before Draco looked away. He walked over to the window for the sake of a reprieve from Potter’s intense gaze and looked out upon the dark Hogwarts grounds instead.
“Say, shouldn’t you have a Hogwarts reunion coming up?” Professor Burbage tapped her finger on her chin.
,” she declared, circling around him with an eye toward appraisal. “Really, now! You should have died when you were sixteen. You were so pretty then.”
“So, hangover potions and cauldrons.” She shot him a pointed look, maintaining an otherwise nonchalant pose as she flew alongside him.
“No shit! That was the most physical challenge I’ve ever had as a drag queen!” Cindy commented.
“I didn’t know you were a CAWW,” Harry commented.
The queens cheered. A member of the Pit Crew walked in with a tray that held a single pair of sunglasses that looked like two bright pink stars. One by one, each queen stood next to RuPaul and donned the sunglasses for their reads.
And when that precious pride had been bruised by a
Draco was washing his hands in the loo when Kali entered and smiled at him through the mirror.
“She thinks it’s her show and she can do whatever the bloody tit she wants with it,” Draco rolled her eyes, “And she’s right.”
After Carmelita’s elimination, the queens tiredly hobbled back into the workroom.
“Yes, GAWD!” Emma cheered.
!” Venus held her thumb and forefinger close together. “So close!”
Goyle squeezed the candle in frustration. It wailed like a dying rubber chicken.
“I didn’t do any actual magic, after all,” Draco continued. “Maybe this whole episode could be brushed aside like the Voynich manuscript.”
“Do you remember when you first started to think you might be falling in love with me?” Draco asked.
Finally, each queen had looked in the mirror.
He cracked open the door of his room, checking to make sure no one was watching, then snuck down the hall to where Lady Cakes was staying. It was very handy that so many of the queens had decorated their hotel room doors with performance photos so he knew exactly where to go.
The pair shared a private smile as they looked into each other’s eyes, before turning back to the others again. “Besides,” Draco added, “that tattoo is a work of art. You’re not going to see it in Madame Inkwell’s shop anymore since she retired and sold the business, but if you really want to see it--”
—Flashback—
She pulled her hand off the tip and waved it at the audience, revealing that the light had gone out. Draco squealed.
Venus Flygirl, Draco, you’re both safe.”
“I should be on the fish team,” Lorena complained. “Everyone knows I’m the fishiest of any of these bitches!”
” Draco answered, holding up a platter of chicken. Michelle fixed her with a piercing glare.
He sighed and downed his drink. Maybe he could slip away and take care of another reason for coming back to this blasted school.
On stage, Draco held the parchment to her bosom and sighed happily.
Draco crossed her arms. “Maybe,” she groused.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked.
“Goldie Hanako, your look tonight really cooked, but your performance in the challenge was...
Draco smiled sheepishly. “You should still go easy on your wrists tonight,” he warned, still unsure whether the potion would completely heal muggle joints.
“Let’s move on to the next part of the choreography,” Todric continued, “The pole-dancing solo numbers.” He gestured towards a pole by the back of the stage.
His eye caught a group of people in front of the doors holding signs. A man on the end held a bright pink sign that read “Draco Malfoy,” and Draco approached him. He was wearing a black T-shirt, cutoff shorts, and the ugliest sandals Draco had ever seen. Even Harry Potter, The Boy Who Most Certainly Never Lived For Fashion, never wore such a ragged ensemble, but the man seemed to be content with himself.
“In her defense, she didn’t get as much from her Secret Santa as some of the other queens,” Ru explained.
“I haven’t been hanging around here much since I died. Anyway, they’re going to help me move on.”
She had been given the hardest stunts in the pole-dancing segment, and had questionable ability to pull off some of the maneuvers. Carmelita was a very feminine pageant queen, more accustomed to posing the house down than performing athletic dance numbers.
The queens shook hands with each other as the camera panned away to a commercial break.
“You have won a two-thousand-dollar gift card for Wild Hairs — the wigs for queens who want to stand apart from the crowd.”

Acacia led Draco back to the kitchen set and turned off the burner. “Good god, get it together, girl.”
about it,” RuPaul laughed.
“You’re like RuPaul now!” Steve added. “He doesn’t need a last name, and neither do you.”
When it was her turn on the set, Draco grabbed a saucepan and placed it on the stove.
While they were talking, Granger casually strolled over to Draco’s costume racks and examined them. She held up a small red dress with a white collar. “Are you really going to play Little Orphan Annie?”
“Honestly, I don’t know why she’s here,” Intoxia told the judges. “She’s not a performer, so I don’t know what she hopes to get out of being here in the first place.
, very now.”
Harry, who had stopped by Draco’s table for a moment as Ron Weasley watched over the room, suddenly let out a loud guffaw. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned Ramsbottom on this show,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “Should we plan a trip there?”
Granger-Weasley huffed. “If you were trying to recreate the room as it looked before the fire, I don’t think the room could have made that possible,” she said. “After all, all those contents were destroyed in the fire. The room is probably working exactly as it should.”
RuPaul laughed.
,” Lady Cakes added.
“Let’s move on,” Granger-Weasley continued, unrattled. She pulled out her wand and transfigured the lipstick into a table.
“So we’ve heard. Many, many times already,” Scorpius muttered.
“Girl, I’m shook,” she answered. “I really felt like I was on top of my game, but I psyched myself out. I kept thinking that I had to nail this challenge to prove myself as a comedy queen, and I just got too far into my own head.”
“I’d rather be Trinity, anyway,” Carmelita said. “She’s sexy and she has fewer lines.”
“I have a few more bottles. I’m happy to share,” Draco told her. The judges laughed.
Draco froze. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Harry puffed out his chest in pride. “Thanks, Bulstrode! I admit I was a bit nervous at first about making pâte à choux, but it was a lot easier than I’d expected.”
The audience roared with laughter and applauded. Pansy, the Greengrass sisters, and Millicent were all red in the face and looked like they were about to die.
“Of course,” Goyle chuckled and Draco wasn’t sure why. “But do think about the reunion!”
“For dating,” Crabbe answered her.
“Oi! Watch it,” the woman growled.
Ivana Mann chuckled. “Girl. At my age, I’m grateful to still be alive after that marathon!”
Goldie gave the notes a thoughtful look. “You know, I kinda like it. Especially since you didn’t change my lines all that much,” he laughed.
—Confessional—
Draco smirked at the camera. “Oh, and have I mentioned that I’m fluent in French? Cette synchronisation labiale, n'est pas une problème.”
hold you to your word on that.” Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
“Oh, Ru's beard,” he breathed.
“Your healthcare system is a world-renowned travesty,” Draco answered automatically.
Goldie picked up the toy and examined it. “Hmm,” he said, “I don’t know, maybe you could take it apart and try to use the stuffing for something?”
Goldie tapped a long, pink fingernail against her chin in thought, then shrugged. “Hmm, I don’t know! I guess I would wait until I found out if I was nominated before making a choice?”
“We’ve already had Sahara Davenport and Brook Lynn Heights in toe shoes, and you not gonna wear toe shoes
Draco felt exhilarated, finally having a direction he could feel passionately about. He spent the rest of the evening showing Harry what he had learned so far and demonstrating some of the lip syncs he had been practicing before Harry had come home.
“I was spending so much energy worrying about what would happen with this court case,” Draco said. “Losing the right to my name still hurts, but now that I’ve lived through it, I feel like I should have more focus on this competition. From now on, I’m looking forward and upward.”
“Yesss, dear, show us the tea!” RuPaul called out as Draco sat on the couch and picked up a cup and saucer, daintily raising the cup with a pinky finger extended gracefully. Draco posed for several shots with the tea set, pretending to pour a cup, pretending to sip with lips puckered over the rim in a flirty pout. Mike Ruiz kept taking shot after shot and RuPaul shouted out encouragement.
“Sorry, that’s not a match,” RuPaul answered.

Et dès que je l'aperçois
“Did you hurt yourself?” Draco whispered. He held out his hand for the other wrist, and Lady Cakes complied.
“Now the gloves are off, I see,” Goyle scowled, pointing the candle at Crabbe. “You’re just lashing out because you’re disappointed the spell didn’t work.”
She closed her eyes and breathed slowly. After a moment, she folded the letter back in the envelope and stuffed it into the half-heart-shaped slit in her gown. There would be time to process this news later.
“Maybe you’ve been dead this whole time,” Burbage looked up from where she had been waving her arms in front of a dozy. “And you just haven’t realized it.”
The Bent Unicorn was packed, much like it had been the previous week.
Lady Cakes sighed and held out the wrist in question. Draco gently peeled off the glove only to find a wrist brace underneath.
Paris looked delighted. She joined Lady Cakes at the back of the stage.
“All right,” RuPaul said. “Now that we have concluded the opening statements, our first question is from Rachel Maddow.”
“So don’t fuck it up!” Warren added.
“And the winner is...Acacia!” RuPaul announced. The queens applauded.
The competition takes a magical turn when the queens perform a magic show for a live audience!
sisters?” RuPaul asked.
Draco nodded, but remained silent.
who went without padding.
Draco’s Doric chiton concept isn’t entirely bullshit. The historical version would have been a much bigger rectangle that wrapped around the body and was held together at the shoulder and with a belt. This site helpfully gives a little history and a picture of how it would have looked: http://fashionteach.blogspot.com/2014/06/chiton-dress16.html Of course, Draco’s version has a halter top, only covers the front, and is a LOT shorter! That’s “couture,” right? ;-) (Her hair is similar, too -- but much bigger, of course!)
(See the end of the chapter for
“But any other queen could have taken what she got and turned it into something more complicated,” Michelle argued. “This was a sewing challenge, and she barely even sewed!”
“The End,” Burbage finished, and curtsied as Draco clapped slowly, unimpressed.
“Hmm, okay,” Paris commented of Ivana’s makeup job. “Not what I would do for myself, but okay.”
.” Harry frowned. Malfoy’s lips were smirking again, in a way that Harry couldn’t help but stare at. Harry had never liked Malfoy, so it was all the more infuriating that he had grown into a very unfairly handsome man.
“Oh!” Goyle nodded. “Good, I told him he should talk to you. Try to get you out of the house.”
Draco rattled the ice in her mostly empty glass. “Cheers,” she said as an answer.
“Draco, since you won the mini challenge, you will get an extra five minutes with Bruce,
Lady Cakes shrugged and decided to follow Draco back to his hotel room. Once they got in the door, however, the larger queen shrieked.
RuPaul laughed. “Okay, I think we need to cut this short before our legal team hears back from the censors.”
“Well, you have a family now, hon,” Kali said, and smiled softly at Draco.
, she reminded herself. She had trained for this.
“We caught a performance last week, and I’ve been getting advice from some of the kings on how I might form my own act,” Millicent added.
don’t have the numbers backwards,” he said slowly in a soft voice that made Harry shiver involuntarily. “But I’m beginning to understand how you could fail Potions so badly.”
“I think you’ve picked on the wrong group of fags,” Draco told him quietly, his eyes narrowed. “I have a certain skill set that I’m authorized to use in case I’m faced with a tangible threat. I know ways to make you feel pain beyond anything you’ve imagined. I could make you hurt so badly that you
Draco’s mouth dropped. She quickly corrected herself and gave a more dignified nod, albeit with delight shining in her eyes.
“Taxes?” Pendleton scratched his head after handing Harry a cuppa. He had thinning grey hair and looked to be in his eighties. He at least seemed kinder and more patient than Woodletter, Harry thought.
Instead of Victoria Sponges, she has
“Team Paris, you are safe. You may leave the stage.” The safe queens walked away, leaving Team Venus looking nervously toward the judges.
“Ohh!” Lorena whined. “I want some!” She took the chicken platter from Draco. “I laaaahve this chicken!”
“But—” Potter stepped closer into Draco’s personal space and lowered his voice to a purr, “—being around all our crazy friends will be so much more fun if you’re there.”
“You’ve won a custom gown from legendary designer, Bob Mackie.”
“Right. So this went on for several months before I finally figured it out.”
“Amen!” The queens and judges responded in chorus.
Lady Cakes smiled softly at her. “She’s your mama,” she said, “she loves you, boo.”
“Oh, and one more thing, Potter? You are officially no longer my client.” Malfoy flashed him a dazzling smile. “Pick me up at eight o’clock. Now that I know what sort of finances you have at your disposal, I expect you to take me to someplace very expensive for dinner. Dress appropriately.”
“It just looked so normal,” Harry added, laughing. “I expected you to be the type with silk sheets and 300-year-old furniture at the least.”
“Still, you’re lucky that it was something within the realm of possibility for no-mags,” she added. “They may think you have unusually talented gymnastic abilities, but they don’t think what you did was impossible.” She gave him a broad smile. “Let’s just consider this a warning and hope you can continue to stay in the competition without any more magic! It would be a shame to have to destroy evidence of one of your stunning performances and obliviate everyone, wouldn’t it?”
Draco looked back and forth as the other queens joined arms. These popularity contests were starting to wear thin on her.
The next morning, Draco rose late enough that Scorpius was already in the kitchen when he went down to make tea and breakfast. He could hear Aunt Aura and Professor Burbage chatting in the dining room.
Draco scowled, though she pretended not to notice. “From now on,” she continued, “any more mail will be relayed through LAAD and I’ll pass it along to you. We can’t just let all these owls fly around delivering mail in front of no-mags. We managed to obliviate Ivana and Steve last night. Plus Kali and another no-mag who saw the owl in your hotel,” she added.
“Not that I’m not grateful for your visit,” Draco said, pouring himself a fresh cup of tea and sitting down with his breakfast at a modestly sized table in the kitchen (he never dined at the dining room table anymore). “But I didn’t even know you were a ghost. What brings you here? Why now?” He took a delicate bite of toast and looked at his guest.
“Oh! Yes, of course,” he mumbled.
“I’ve brought my good friend, United States Senator Elizabeth Warren here today! She’s going to help give you some pointers for the Frock the Vote debate,” RuPaul continued. The queens cheered.
The magician held up a matchbook and stared intently at it. He waved his other hand, and suddenly the matchbook burst into flames.
The other queens each served looks that fell somewhere on a spectrum of sexy-scary-insane-ugly. On behalf of real witches everywhere, Draco felt slightly embarrassed by the parade of imitators. Though he had to grant that of the queens, only she and Kali had any idea what a “real” witch should look like.
The queens danced. The music was available on iTunes. It had become a familiar drill by this point in the competition, one which Draco was glad to continue for another week.
on a rectangle, so this is my way of honoring the cycle by putting the rectangle on me.” She flashed the judges her best smile for good measure.
“OhmygodI’msorry!” Kali sputtered.
has sex there.”
Harry was experiencing a private internal meltdown, too distracted by those pink lips and the little vee of Malfoy’s neck not obstructed by his collar to fully process what the other man was saying.
“Bitch, who are you talking about?” Steve challenged.
Knees still a little shaky, he stepped down and to the right, following her direction. Traveling by portkey halfway across the planet had been rough, but a minute of discomfort still beat the twelve-hour horror he was sure he would have experienced if he had used the muggle plane ticket offered by the World of Wonder company. The price of a round-trip portkey ticket — and the added fee to alter the muggle records to make it appear that he
. He still wasn’t quite used to it, but the more it happened, the more he wondered why he had lived so long without it.
The light turned red and a buzzer sounded.
Last week on DDR: The queens lip synced and performed pole-dancing routines in a Rusical about '80s and '90s movie heroines! Draco did all right playing Cher from Clueless, but her "red carpet realness" runway look was...well, carpet.
“Oh! Well,” Draco slipped out of her Trelawney voice as she contemplated this request, her accent growing rougher. “What kind of ghost would you like? Ancient Roman soldier, creepy child, or maybe a Victorian whore suit your fancy?”
But he couldn’t be proud of any of that anymore, so he focused his pride on the badges instead.
“Ta,” Draco said. She perched on the edge of the couch in her 1940s pinup ballerina outfit. Lorena frowned.
“Maybe next time, I will.”
“No, Ru, and I’ll keep it real with you,” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher replied. “I’m a female...in Hollywood...over a certain age...and dead. There aren’t a lot of job offers for me to choose from.”
“It was my father who disowned me,” Draco explained, “but my mother — I never expected her to go against him...or even to record a
“Now Mary, I see you brought a drink with you. Are you thirsty?”
If Scorpius didn’t mind this nickname as much as Draco did, he didn’t show it. This was turning out to be a terrible day.
“I’m sad to see Steve go,” Lorena Gucci commented with a sigh as she took off her oversized rhinestone earrings.
Last week on DDR: Draco has a lot of social media followers, Millicent wants to see women in drag, the queens talk about seeing owls, Draco has to stop using Malfoy in her drag name, Draco makes up song titles for Seduction, Ivana is too helpful to the other queens, Draco adopts a drag spider and talks about fashion accessories he designed at Hogwarts, Kali asks Draco to use magic to fix her costume, the queens show off three looks in the ball challenge, Ursa Minor debuts the runway, Draco has a muggle studies lesson, and Ivana sashays away.
“Girl, how is

Lorena-as-Ariana held up a card. “
This week: it’s time for the queens to run for president! Draco feels a little out of place here. What’s a Brit to do with American politics?
“Oh no, what’s that?”
“Americans, I know you are all frustrated with the politics that have divided your country. So I am extending an olive branch. Let bygones be bygones and forget this silly nonsense. Come back to England. We have all the things you love — dreamy accents, castles, rolling hills dotted with sheep, and quaint little towns with names like Ramsbottom.”
“Now, for your maxi challenge this week, we’re going to play a different kind of game,” RuPaul continued. “SNATCH GAME!”
The worst comment, by far, suggested that Draco’s attempt at Grecian couture made her look like the world’s worst-dressed house elf.

spell to amplify her voice. Harry quietly slinked away to his seat.
“Oh, do you know what?” Lorena asked, her face lighting up as she had an idea.
“I can help you carry those,” he said. “Just the four suitcases? Come on, the van’s just outside.”
“Welcome to life, boo.”
“Really? The best henge?” RuPaul asked in delighted amazement.
Draco switched the phone to her other ear. Her accent went even coarser as she said, “‘ere now, luvvie, I’m takin’ off me stockin’s fer ya! Ooh, me ankles are bare!”
Potter attempted to school his features into seriousness. “You really thought you were destined to fall in love with Moaning Myrtle?” He said, trying to appear sympathetic only to dissolve into laughter again.

Draco had warmed up considerably to

“Why Potter, what have we here?” Millicent paused in the act of changing into Harry Gryffindor’s Hogwarts uniform, looking at the food with hungry interest.
“Now, we all need to recite the incantation three times in unison. It’s ‘
Ghosts apparently had no hang-ups about broaching sensitive topics and it was bloody annoying.
“Malfoy!” Potter called again through the bookshelf. “Al said he saw Scorpius, so I wondered if I’d bump into you. Hang on a sec.” With that, he disappeared.
“It’s me, Draco Malfoy,” he explained to her apparition of furrowed brows, head tilted to one side.
” RuPaul quipped. “Why, Miss Bennet! Whatever will Mr. Darcy think?!”
The queens clapped. Venus cheered for herself.
Acacia screamed. “What are you doing?! It’ll bite you!”
“Like a drag queen,” Draco responded.
“All right, now let the music play!”
“Now, our Rusical will be divided into two acts,” RuPaul told them. “Team Paris will portray iconic sheroes of films from the 1980s. Team Venus, you will portray iconic sheroes from the ‘90s.” Several queens snapped excitedly. Draco went along with it.
The other queen smiled. “You still look like you’re sad about something. Need a magical black woman to help you fix your shit?”
“‘Good luck to my sisters — win that crown!’” Paris Davenport read aloud. “Oh, I miss her already! ‘Except Draco your next.’ Damn, girl!” she laughed.
—Before the Viewing Party—
Draco started rifling around the werkroom in search of a pen. After a few minutes, he plucked the pheasant feather out of the hat he had worn in the Red Carpet Realness challenge. He grabbed a pair of scissors, and, taking one of the scissor blades, began shaving barbs off the bottom few inches. He then cut a small bit off the bottom at an angle until it resembled a writing quill.
” Draco’s head jerked back to the screen so fast that it was practically a miracle he didn’t give himself whiplash. The queens who had been taking turns strutting were now lined up along the front of the stage while people sitting on a panel criticized their outfits. One of them talked back to the panel in a deep baritone voice.
When the queens reentered the werkroom after the last challenge, they saw Steve Donovan’s lipstick message on the mirror.
“This is actually my first time sewing with carpet,” she told them. “I found this old rug in my boyfriend’s attic. It wasn't easy material to work with, mind you, but I’m happy with the way it turned out,” Draco said, smoothing a hand down the narrow sleeve of her jacket.

be gay. That’s my white noise!’” The audience gave another round of laughs.
—Confessional—
Draco took the small burning stick and examined it up close. The smoke fumes smelled noxious, though they didn’t have the added stale, dead-animal bouquet on the smoking queens’ clothes that occasionally overpowered her when she stood next to them. Interacting with so many smokers really made Draco wish she hadn’t inherited her mother’s sensitive sense of smell.
“Right, even
Paris shook his head. “Well, this is a hot mess,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Acacia’s confused, Martha Stewart’s confused, Michelle’s confused...honey, we’re
“Are you ready for some magic?” he continued. The queens cheered.
“Now,” Draco held up his hand to signal for them to chant together.
—Confessional—
The rest of the pub was deathly quiet. Pansy Parkinson reached over and patted Draco’s arm. Even Granger and Weasley shot him sympathetic glances.
“Yes, I do see that.”
“Steve is Elsa,” Intoxia continued, “Paris is Okoye from
“Chicken butt,” Lady Cakes interjected absently. Draco and Lorena both stared at her.
After his fourth year at Hogwarts, when the Dark Lord had risen again, Draco had been given this opportunity over his summer holiday to
Of all the people to lurk behind a book, Potter was the last person Draco wanted to find. He harrumphed and rubbed at the bump forming on his head as he put the puberty book back on the shelf.
Draco’s head snapped up in confusion.
“I know I can’t sew,” Steve mumbled. “But I tried my best. I’m just too dumb to get it right.”
— I mean, no offense,” she added quickly, realizing she was talking to two other queens who had chosen the same world wonder.
“We need to wrap this up in five minutes,” Martha warned.
?!” Draco cried.
“Indeed! These are all going to be fixed in a circle, and you’ll see Stonehenge as it’s meant to be seen, complete and pristine.”
Me: NOOOOOOOO
“Goldie,” said Paris.
“Yes, I designed a series of masks, too,” he said dully when the assistant refused to answer. “But I do love my badges.”
“Well,” she began. “This is my take on a Doric chiton, which is what women in ancient Greece would have worn instead of a toga. But I’ve made it a bit more couture with the halter strap and the, erm…”
.” Paris raised her eyebrow. “I still remember when you said you could work with Hair of the Dog in our cooking show challenge. Are you sure you can turn this out the way you think you can?”
Still a bit shaky but immensely relieved, Draco joined the other queens in dancing on the runway to one of RuPaul’s latest singles (now available on iTunes).
“The library is permanently closed!” RuPaul concluded. “All right ladies, good job — but I think we have a winner...Draco!”
“Very well,” he said, “I suppose I can forgive you.”
“Right, I suppose I must carry on alone then,” Kali said, trying to maintain a wobbly British accent. “It wouldn’t do if I annoyed you enough to turn me into a toad.”
, Bitch!” Carmelita yelped after Kali accidentally sank a stiletto heel onto his toes.
“Sure, but a love ‘born of enmity?’”
Draco blinked. “I...suppose I can give that a try.”
The other queens oohed and ahhed as Venus clapped in delight.
“Yeah!!! Give us that USO Show realness!” Leslie cried.
Several queens ooh’ed and clapped their hands. Draco furrowed his brows, jaw dropped. Magic had never been a performance art in his understanding of the universe. Kali, the one queen who knew Draco was a wizard, shot him a look that implied that he wanted to be on Draco’s team for this challenge.
” Helena added. “I liked that she did some traditional Indian dance on the runway. It doesn’t completely make up for bad acting, but she’s got some fierce looks.”
“Oh.”
I’m not usually one to write fics with non-fictional characters, but this story wouldn’t leave me alone so here we are. Apologies to Courtney Act in particular! I think she’s fierce and an amazing performer. I don’t really think RuPaul would let other queens have that much power over one of the contestants, though.
“Look at my eyes, Harry,” Draco said. The girls giggled. Such was the side effect of wearing snakes around a Parselmouth boyfriend.
in the past few weeks, especially since their continued coverage of Draco’s performances on
The smile fell from Courtney’s face. “They’re British,” she deadpanned. “You’ve really never heard of them?”
—At the Viewing Party—
The next day was Elimination Day. The theme for the runway was Cosplay, the fictional recreations meant to provide a switch from the non-fictional portrayals of the Snatch Game.
RuPaul doubled over in laughter. “That’s okay, Taylor, that’s okay. Just shake it off,” he told her. Taylor shook her arms and head.
Granger-Weasley nodded, then turned to Potter. “Harry, we’re going to burn the book. Care to do the honors?”
He looked around the bookstore. “Why, you’re rather bold to be hitting on people as a married man, aren’t you? Isn’t your little wife here? What happened, did she finally run off and leave you?” He winced. He didn’t know what inspired him to say that thought out loud.
Draco gasped.
“Up next, Kali Sister…”
"Don't worry, I'm British. Our body composition is at least ten to fifteen percent alcohol."
Lady Cakes held up her Draco puppet. Draco cringed to see that Lady Cakes had dressed it in a white rectangular scrap of fabric and a wonky eyelash. “Lady Cakes, do be sure to fasten your chair strap when we ride in the artmobile! Hash fag, safety first, ta!”
“She’s not just
“And the koala?”
Paris and Goldie shook their heads. “None at all,” Draco replied. He snuck a glance at Paprikah, who was standing just off the screen and watching with interest while holding some type of camera equipment.
“Gentlemen, start your engines...and may the best candidate...
“Condragulations, my queens! Now remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an Amen in here?!”
“Now, in addition to performing professional illusions, you’ll need to come up with a name for your magic act, write captivating dialogue, and create a magical look — using makeup provided by Salmon Buffet.”
“That’s one hell of a tuck,” special guest judge Reese Witherspoon commented. “How in the world did she hide that so well?”
—Confessional—
Paprikah raised an eyebrow. “You might be surprised,” she said, and turned the new mic on before zipping Draco back into her dress.
, he reminded himself — but it might work.
“What the…” he uttered.
“Hi Ru, this is the best day of my life,” Lorena-as-Ariana-Grande smiled and batted her eyes.
“Oh, don’t worry about it — just a few of the old crowd speculating on whether you’d show up tonight.” He maneuvered Draco until they were in the Great Hall. “Look who’s here, everyone!”
—Confessional—
chicken,” Lady Cakes preened. Draco smirked.
Draco beamed at Paris for good measure.
. Steve, who was still wearing tap shoes, proceeded to tap dance all over the stage as she lip synced. Lady Cakes chose to stay in one place most of the time, but served as much face as she could, emoting everything into her lip sync.
Paris shrugged. “Sure, let’s try running through it.”
“You don’t think I know about pop culture?” Draco sneered. “I was Cher, bitch!”
“This is all very creative, but we need to avoid mentioning the Smurfs,” Michelle told him. This time, Draco looked confused. “I don’t think we can get the copyright clearance for that.”
reviewed the previous episode. Seeing Draco openly express his love for Harry in the lip sync, and Harry’s love letter to Draco, helped convince more than a few people that he wasn’t simply with Harry for personal gain.
“Sorry, not a match,” RuPaul continued. “Okay, are you ready for the next question, Emma?”
“How is your head?” RuPaul asked.
Draco felt proud of this runway look and reveal. So far in the competition, she had been struggling to keep up with the others. But for the first time, she felt like she was really
instead of birth control?”
,” Draco continued, wrinkling her nose, “It seems I have a bit more studying to do. Do excuse me while I run through my Lady Goggle lyrics a few more times.” With that, she got up and wandered over to a vanity, where she picked up a glowing rectangle and extendable ears (or whatever the muggles called them) and tuned out the other queens.
“For our first trick, I’m going to use our magic wand,” Draco announced. She picked a plastic wand off a table to the side of the stage.
was an honorific,” he explained. “I thought she was like The Lady of Cakes. But actually, it’s a descriptor. It’s the
” RuPaul announced.
“That’s the stick she gotta take out of her ass so she can lip sync for her life!” Acacia cackled. Draco responded with an eye roll and a rude gesture.
“Bored with the afterlife,” the spectre clarified. “I talked it over with Greg again, and he said that you’d been thinking about death a lot since your wife died and all—”
When she got to the end of the runway, Draco removed the cords from her belt and lifted the henge up to waist height. She began to spin, moving faster and faster until the skirt rose up into a rippling field of green perpendicular to her body. Underneath was now visible a pair of nude pumps and a flawless tuck.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called out, entering the werkroom.
Jones took a playing card and appeared to spin it in the air between and around his hands. Draco burst into laughter, his face turning pink.
“Balenciaga, Dior, Givenchy—”
The time finally came for the queens to get into drag and line up for their runway presentations. Draco took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and stepped onto the stage.
“Yet,” Draco answered. “Why are any of us here? Aren’t we all celebrating the beauty of drag?”
It had been so long since Draco had been surrounded by magic that he was starting to feel a little off kilter. The idea of a magic challenge made him feel practically manic.
Teddy’s eyes lit up. “Really?? Brilliant!” He punched his fist in the air.
“RuPaul, I am a man in my eighties. And at my age, I find that I don’t care as much about formal titles as I used to,” he explained. RuPaul nodded. “So you can call me Jiggly, just as long as you call me.” RuPaul laughed.
Draco nodded, thinking.
“Very well. It all began when your father was at Hogwarts.” With that, Burbage slipped into storytelling mode.
“You will need to find out who is responsible for managing the Black estate and ask them how to file the estate taxes. That will be seventy-five galleons for my services.” He jotted the information down on a piece of parchment and handed it to Harry. The to-do list had only two items.
“I do! She really came through tonight, and I finally feel like I know who she is now,” Michelle explained.
“Girl, you’ll be fine,” Venus said, re-shaping a wide-brimmed red fedora that must have flattened slightly in his suitcase.
Draco nodded to him in greeting.
“Lorena is the type of person to punch down when she knows she’s not doing well,” Draco said. “It helps her feel better about her own performance. What she
“Bored enough to stop by and say hello? I see how I rate, then.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest as he scowled. This was not an auspicious way to start the day.
Bianca laughed. “Honey, everyone is a horrible prat when they’re a kid.” Draco gave her a faint smile. “Look, no one else has your life experiences. But the trick is to take those experiences and find something about them that you can look back on and laugh at. And then make us laugh with you.”
Ironically, the more he thought about it, the more Draco realized that he really didn’t
Draco pouted. “But I bet the audience would like to see me perform some magic, wouldn’t you?” She addressed the audience, which cheered enthusiastically.
Lady Cakes laughed. “You know, like in the movies. When white people have problems, and a black person swoops in to save the day?”
“It’s just a spider,” Draco reasoned in the face of the general chaos into which the room had degenerated. He watched as the others all shunned the unfortunate invertebrate in fear.
“I got Sasha Velour!” Steve informed the room delightedly, pulling out a papier-mache crown and a few yards of various types of fabric.
“They’re drag queens, Draco.”
“Now, there’s something about you that makes me want to ask — do you feel like a dangerous woman today?”
Lorena and Goldie grabbed each other’s hands as they faced RuPaul.
and get people buying. Are you a marketing maven, or merely a
After a moment of silence, Goyle sighed. “Out, out, brief candle.”
“Kali Sister, your performance as Jameela Jamil took us to a Bad Place. Lorena Gucci, your Ariana Grande made us want to say, ‘Thank U, Next.’” RuPaul paused for dramatic effect while the two queens stood nervously. “Lorena Gucci, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
Draco flicked the back of his head. “Hush. You’ll miss the good part.”
Harry gasped. He struggled, writhing, his limbs trapped. Then he squirmed and shouted.
“You wanna know what?” Lady Cakes asked the camera with a devious grin.
Lady Cakes stroked his chin. “What’s your George Takei?”
It rankled. To think that
“All right, well, we’re glad to have you here,” RuPaul continued. “Now, let’s meet Ariana Grande!”
Kali nodded glumly. “That Snatch Game was brutal, but I feel like they liked my outfit on the runway, at least.” She fiddled with her beaded veil. “I’m giving them Bollywood bling realness. RuPaul even gasped when she saw my Padmavaat, so who knows? I’m hoping it helped.”
. I’m Paris Davenport, and I approve this message.”
“I just wanted to apologize for yesterday,” Kali said quietly. “I was thinking about it last night. My aunt always tells us that we can’t talk about her being a witch because it has to be a secret. I guess there are laws about not doing magic where people can see, huh?” He ran a hand through his long hair and nervously wrapped it into a sloppy bun.
“Pleasure,” Draco shook his hand, still confused. “What happened to her?”
“I’m going to write down the form numbers on a little sheet of parchment,” Malfoy continued, scribbling with his quill. “Then all you have to do is go to the relevant offices and point at the numbers with your greasy little finger.” He shoved the parchment at Harry. “We’ll try again tomorrow.”
Goldie gave her an admonishing look. “Draco, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“Mm-hmm.”

He rolled over and sighed up at the ceiling. This truly was a terrible time for his libido to decide that it had a thing for Malfoy again.
“Oh, yes, I’d very much like to see
“Now, here’s how the game works, ladies! I will ask a series of questions, our celebrity contestants fill in the blanks, and you will give an answer that you think will match theirs. First up, Emma. Dirty Diana is so dirty, she uses
Draco shook out her jitters and nodded.
The judges chuckled. “I’m sure you are,” RuPaul replied.
“Hmm, I see a sky-blue bodice...grass-green skirt...is this going to be something a little close to home for you?”
Eventually, it was time for the queens to get into drag and present their three runway looks for the Ball.
—At the Viewing Party—
“Well, she’s not on
“I designed these badges when I was in school,” he explained. He pointed to each one in turn. “This one says ‘Support Cedric Diggory,’ that was my first one.”
Carson added, “My stones tell me when it’s time to get on my knees, too.”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders and answered, “RuPaul’s Drag Race. It’s an American reality competition show about drag queens.”
” RuPaul doubled over in laughter. “Because fuck him and the horse he rode in on!”
—At the Viewing Party—
“Do you want me to help you run through your lines?” Draco offered.
“Who finally got you to stick to a diet?!”
“Morning, Dad,” his son greeted him.
“This is a
The next few hours passed in a blur of neon lights, tequila shots, and male go-go dancers. All thoughts about the Wizengamot, his father, the Malfoy name, and the disastrous kitchen challenge faded from Draco’s mind as the night wore on, the queens all laughing and having a good time.
,” he answered. “But it doesn’t quite fit with what RuPaul was implying.”
“That was it,” Draco answered. “Really, it’s not a very realistic prophecy at all. They’re just teasing because they want to laugh about me getting my jollies on over a ghost.”
“I don’t wanna have to send my Latina sister home,” Carmelita told the camera, “But there ain’t no way I’m going home so early. Bitch better start packing.”
Luggage mishap aside, this was going well enough so far, he thought to himself. Draco’s first solo venture among muggles wasn’t the horror story that his family had warned him about as a child — nor was it the cause for stress that Harry seemed to think Draco might face. He chuckled to himself as he wondered why anyone would think a wizard needed to take a class for muggle studies.
—At the Viewing Party—
Draco blinked rapidly. “Thanks,” he muttered with a shuddering breath. Gradually, the queens pulled away.
Draco blinked. It was roughly the size and length of his forearm.
“Can you maybe play up the idea of cooking?” Michelle suggested. “We don’t need to see a step-by-step recipe if you can make us laugh.”
Draco shook his head. “I’m much more suited to laughing
Draco and Venus looked at each other uneasily.
got a large sack,” he flirted. The man gave a suggestive smirk. RuPaul leaned forward and pulled a large ball out of the bag.
One by one, the queens strutted down the runway in their swimsuits. The fishier queens like Lorena, Steve, and Goldie opted for bikinis that showed off their figures. The “pageant queens,” Paris and Acacia, made a big show of wearing multiple cover-ups that they tore away until they were wearing sequined one-piece suits. Kali, Venus, and Intoxia opted for vintage pinup looks. Lady Cakes and Ivana both camped up their looks — Lady Cakes by wearing flip-flops and a horridly loud swimming cap with a striped suit that made her look like a giant beach ball, and Ivana by wearing a knee-length, ruffled rubber suit that would have been legal beach attire one hundred years ago.
“But rectangles are so important to our society,” Draco said in her defense. “People spend so much of their days looking at rectangles — on their phones, on their computers, on their tellys. And now they’re going to watch
!” Leslie shouted. “Tchaikovsky betta don’t!”
, he saw that it was time to get out of bed. He stumbled over to his wardrobe, slipped into his favorite dressing gown, and stumbled down the stairs to the kitchen to fix a cup of tea and toast.
The music started up and both queens lip synced to
“I have no idea what’s going on,” Steve said. “Draco is freaking out, Acacia is freaking out, and me, Paris, and Goldie are looking at each other because none of us know what to do.”
“The Room of Requirement?” Granger-Weasley frowned. “Are you sure it’s still operational? It was heavily damaged in the fire.”
“All right, Kali Sister,” RuPaul continued.
“You know I’ll help, too,” Goyle said, “Though I’m hoping you won’t need too much magic from me. I’m a bit rusty these days.”
“W-what betting pool?” Draco asked, thrown off balance by Nott’s heavy arm slung over his shoulder. That, and the fact that all the hair on Nott’s head had mysteriously migrated from his scalp to his chin since Draco had last seen him.
That night, the runway challenge was Signs of the Zodiac. When it was Draco’s turn, she stopped in the doorway that framed the entrance from backstage, striking a pose in profile. Her right side faced the judges and revealed a long, sparkling silver gown that graced the floor on either side of a long slit up to her hip, showing off leg for days. The gown hugged her lithe frame around the middle to show off a shapely backside and tiny waist. Her arm gracefully extended in front of her, encased in a long, sheer sleeve studded with tiny crystals. The gown had a high neckline that showcased her naturally long, swanlike neck. She wore her hair in a pale blonde chignon gathered just to the right side of her nape.
“Every time you open your mouth, a koala reaches in and steals another tiny handful of your brains.”
Goyle rolled his eyes. “Yes, Draco. You can call them muggles. You know I went to a muggle school after the war, and it was the best decision of my life. And if you’d read my Christmas newsletters, you’d know I’ve been teaching English since I finished my PhD.”
As the queens got out of drag and prepared to go back to the hotel for the night, Draco looked around the room. The past several weeks had felt like an intense journey in multiple ways. His approach to drag had grown and stretched with each challenge, for one. He wasn’t sure he would even recognize the queen who had entered the workroom in the first week.
Draco had already gotten back up and began striding to the back of the runway.
The overhead lights flickered.
Lorena huffed and rolled her eyes. “I don’t think I have to worry, either,” she said. “My look was on point, the audience liked my number, and I deserve to stay here...but I can’t say the same about everybody here.”
“No need to get jealous just ‘cuz I got cast as Princess Leia!” Acacia shot back.
“No, we’re not looking for Wes right now,” RuPaul said. “We’re looking for Amelia Earhart. Has anyone seen her?!”
“Please, let it not be something sexual,” James muttered to himself and took a swig of firewhiskey.
“And you’ve never seen a drag show when you’ve gone to a muggle gay bar?”
the Golden Trio this time. Or maybe it was because walking down the hall next to Potter made him feel just a bit ill. He knew he shouldn’t have eaten that stupid sausage.
Last week specifically: The queens staged a presidential debate! Draco campaigned on a platform of returning the United States to the British monarchy, then later underwhelmed the judges with a ballet look in the Pinup Runway challenge. Paris won the mini and maxi challenge. Goldie and Lorena lip synced and chantéed in a double save.
“Yes. She was a judge on a reality competition show for bakers, and —
“Let the music play!” The music (now available on iTunes) started up and they all danced. Another queen left, and now just seven remained.
, Draco thought. It wasn’t the most elegant conversation starter. The show staff had warned them that they were to approach certain talking points while putting on their makeup in each episode, so it was only a matter of time before the subject of family was introduced on camera.
Later that day, all seven queens headed to the stage to meet a magician who would teach them magic tricks for their acts. Draco had no idea what to expect.
“I won the challenge!” Ivana smiled at the camera. “All these bitches underestimated me because I’m the oldest, but who’s laughing now? Age before beauty,
“Here you go, Draco,” the manager said at the end of the night as he handed her a small bag of galleons as a booking fee. “I dare say this turned out great for business! Same time next week, yeah?” Draco agreed, not having anything else on his calendar until the
’?” He sang, with the air of someone whistling past the graveyard:
“FOOD FIGHT!!!” RuPaul shouted, seeming to have recovered from the sudden turn of events.
“They’re men, Draco.”
“Draco,” RuPaul called as they approached. “A little bird told me you were having some trouble earlier,” he said. “What have you got here?” he asked, gesturing curiously at the quill.
“Yeah? What?” Lady Cakes asked.
“I don’t think your government knows about this to ban it,” Draco reflected, “but discretion is a good idea.”
The queens looked at each other.
“Reunion? What reunion?”
The audience cheered again, and Draco jumped up and down in delight. “Yay!!!”
“Show them what we already know and love about you, Draco!” Andromeda added.
Acacia was dancing up a storm. By this point, she had already twirled in a giant circle around Draco, death dropped, and landed in the splits.
“Yes,” Crabbe agreed.
“I still remember the first time I brought Harry back to my bedroom at the Manor,” Draco told his grandchildren, a little smile sneaking onto his face. “Of course, he had to complain about it. ‘
“What with the way you have with animals, I thought you’d go for Danaerys or some kind of Disney Princess of the Damned,” Lady Cakes said.
Draco pondered this. She really didn’t know any Seduction songs. She decided she might as well make some up.
, haters!”
“Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have anything to do with these runway decisions,” RuPaul added, “so please don’t send me any hate mail about cultural appropriation.”
“I think we’re given this amazing platform on this show to speak up for what we believe in,” Paris responded. She rubbed contouring lines onto her cheek.
“Who are you gonna be, Miss Lady Cakes?” Paris asked.
Harry found his floo address and flooed him immediately. Rather than a floo call, however, Pendleton insisted on inviting him over to tea.
Lady Cakes looked at Draco over the notebook and raised her eyebrows. Draco made a noncommittal gesture. It seemed like a perfectly valid question. For all she knew, muggles had some way to see noises in different colors. Maybe it was a privilege to see white noise.
Draco felt her cheeks heat up and closed her eyes, trying to remind herself why she shouldn’t hex the muggles. She didn’t think that a tag made any more sense in this context.
Aunt Aura laughed. “You never told him!”
—Confessional—
Curse Granger-Weasley for making perfect sense.
“Hello, Draco,” Narcissa called. “I just want you to know that in spite of everything that has happened, you are still my son, you will
The audience met this greeting with a wild mix of laughs, jeers, and odd catcalls.
“Just put it in the center of the circle, Goyle,” he said. Once Goyle had done so, Draco used his wand to light it.
A new chapter by December 21 -- it’s a Solstice Miracle! And true to Solstice spirit, this chapter is Draco’s darkest point in the story. After this, it’s going to be all sunshine and kittens. JK (well, mostly JK)
“It’s not enough just to look fishy and flash your ass on the runway,” Michelle lectured, wagging her finger at Draco. “You’ve got a great body, but this is Season __! We expect more from you.”
“Yes, of course, you’re the only man for me. But now is
“She’s going
“That depends. How do you feel about baking?”
Draco, why don’t you take Rose Dawson since you can speak with a British accent?” Draco looked up from the script, hoping his confusion wasn’t too evident on his face.
“Ay, dios mio, this is not how I wanted this to go!” Lorena lamented. “I’m not ready to be in the bottom two again. But Goldie is no match for me! I am going to turn. This. out.” He snapped his fingers.
“What would you like to say to Middle-Class America?” RuPaul asked.
“What do you mean, come for you? I was Nicole Byer. I was there to make jokes about cake.”
“And what precisely does that mean to you?”
Malfoy looked up in shock. “What?”
month?" Harry gaped.
Draco had never felt like his father approved of him. If Lucius didn’t complain about Draco’s behavior, he complained that Draco wasn’t at the top of his class at Hogwarts. He wasn’t a good enough quidditch player to beat Potter. He didn’t learn the dark arts fast enough.
“Yeah,” Lady Cakes agreed. “I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but I think there’s a lot you can do to make him funny. Venus, who are you playing?”
“I don’t think it’s going to work,” Granger-Weasley said. “I think the room is too glitchy to make it happen correctly.”
Draco huffed as he went to work transfiguring three suitcases to match the original and repacked his bags. He felt his face burn with humiliation as he moved flashy gowns, wigs, accessories, and dozens of other items the average man wouldn’t be carrying into the newly transfigured luggage.
“There’s a sewing challenge in the first episode, every season,” Lady Cakes added.
“Welcome back, ladies. I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul told them. “Lady Cakes McMansion...you are safe. You may join the other girls.” Lady Cakes bowed her head and went to the back.
“We almost died,” he continued. “But then, this is Harry Bloody Potter we’re talking about, and almost dying just reminds him of the good old days when he was young and almost died on a regular basis. So while I’m still in shock from the ordeal, he whips out his wand and rattles off spell after spell. Next thing I know, I’m levitating above his lap while he’s on his broom, both our trousers down, and I’m hanging on to my own broom with my hands above my head. And then he’s hissing in my ear and all I can think is, ‘Thank Salazar for Stefan,’ because I’m not sure I would have survived Gryffindor Sex Night otherwise.”
That was a partial truth. Draco was also suspecting that he may have to adjust his attitude in order to form a working relationship with the other queens, but he was far from ready to admit that yet.
and you are strong. And I want you to know that you are not alone,” she smiled.
This was the day of Draco’s hearing before the Wizengamot. He hasn’t heard any more from Harry, only that he had found a lawyer and they were working on the case. London was eight hours ahead. For all he knew, the case had already been settled and Draco’s fate sealed.
“And I can’t tell you how many sacrifices I made,” he continued, voice wavering slightly before he caught himself. “In the end, I was just a little too...
“Well, I grew up in the British countryside, in Wiltshire, just a stone’s throw away from the
“Remember, you’re in the running for America’s next drag superstar,” Michelle chided. “You’re beautiful, but we also want to know that you can think on your feet.” Draco nodded solemnly.
now? People have been wanting to follow you on Instagram, Twitter, et cetera – and clubs are wanting to book you for gigs! They need a way to contact you.”
By the time all the queens had arrived, there were fourteen in total. In addition to Goldie, Paris, and Venus, Draco learned that the other two queens who had been there when she arrived were Steve Donovan (a showgirl from Las Vegas who apparently didn’t use a fake drag name either) and Lorena Gucci, a fashion-obsessed queen from Puerto Rico.

“Is it the kind that screams when you squeeze it?” Weasley asked.

“Whatever we do, I think we should be sexy about it,” Lorena commented.
“That’s funny, I’ve never heard of you.”
“Ooh, I love it!” Special guest judge Helena Bonham Carter added.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, my platform is based on teamwork. Vote for me, a good old-fashioned drag queen, and I will
“Why hello, Draco!” RuPaul greeted as he approached Draco, who was styling a blonde bob wig at his work table. “Tell, me, who is this going to be?”
—At the Viewing Party—
“Trixie Mattel is going through a goth phase,” Michelle Visage deadpanned.
“How in the hell did that get in here?!” Lady Cakes cried. “You want me to call the front desk, sugar? They need to bring in Animal Control!”
The queens chitchatted amongst themselves for a few minutes before they were interrupted suddenly by the large television screen hanging on one wall. RuPaul’s voice was heard calling out an odd phrase that made no sense to Draco’s ears as they all turned to the screen for the message.
“Now, for this week’s maxi challenge, you will be starring in “Sheroes: The Rusical!” The queens cheered. “You will be split into two teams. Venus and Paris, you won the mini challenge, so you are the team leaders. Come forward and choose which queens will be on your team.” Venus and Paris stepped to the front of the group, standing next to RuPaul.
“So, for today’s mini challenge, you need to do and say whatever it takes to sweet-talk your way in. In the end, the queen with the funniest powers of persuasion wins. Now, you’ve got fifteen minutes to get your all-access VIP drag on. GO!”
I’m alive! It’s been...a long time since my last update. What’s my best excuse? The 2020 dumpster fire? My creative muse getting quarantined on a desert island without internet? The fact that this fic got stuck on a word count with 666 in it for over a year? Hmm, it must have been the word count!!!
“As your friend, I should warn you not to take everything she says too seriously,” Zabini said. “She’s blowing everything out of proportion! What will you drink? I can’t recommend the wine — seriously, would anyone expect good wine at Hogwarts? But the cocktails are excellent. I brought Highbridge’s, top-shelf icegin. Only the best for you, my friend! Let me get you a Freezing Niffler. Have you had one before? It’s Highbridge’s icegin, crushed mint, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a little gold dust, served on the rocks. Of course, Highbridge’s icegin is also delicious on its own or with tonic. But try this!
