Teddy sighed in frustration. "You can't tell me the ..." And put your hands around your mouth, whispering "Secretive secret now?"
"That's it! It's not true. End of the story."
"Sit. Now."  Hermione repeated.
“Oh!” Harry felt the vibrations of the blonde's voice run through his body when he came to his defense “So ... I was minding my own business when I saw this coffee shop and, I love with coffee, I decided to come in and order a cup. I look to the side and the clerk is staring at me. And he continued to stare. Super creepy. But then I thought, ‘oh, he is cute, what could go wrong?’ So I stared back and winked at him.” Luna chuckled and Draco smiled. “But he kept looking at me and doing nothing. Then these two disappeared for about 10 minutes and I stood to wait for someone to come and get my order”
"That what?"
"Hey."
"Harry ...I don't know how the wolf can react to that ..."
"Hmm ... I'm not sure." Realizing that the brunette had remained silent, waiting for an explanation, he continued "I thought about medimagic ... Maybe specialized in potions? Don't know. I don't think I would be exactly well received at St. Mungus with this whole Death Eater thing. And since we lost the Manor, my mom will probably want to move to the remaining property in France ... Why?"
Harry wasn't even surprised this time and he felt strange about it. He was angrier at being cheated and not having his hot cocoa than scared.
"Great. What she wanted?"
Crookshanks hissed at the man. The man hissed at Crookshanks.
Harry replied with incomprehensible grunts.
Pansy Parkinson frowned but returned to sit next to Ginny, who returned the parchment on which the brunette was making her notes so that the two could return to study.
Evidently, he was also slightly obsessed with keeping his hair extremely well aligned, all the time. He spent an eternity in front of mirrors, every time he passed one of them. Yes. Vampires apparently have a reflection, at least in modern mirrors. Harry had been acquiring a series of useless facts about vampires. In this case, theoretically, vampires did not appear in mirrors with silver background, as it is a pure metal, but most of the current mirrors had an aluminum background and aluminum is not so demanding on what or who to reflect or not.
"Do you prefer that I treat you as a boyfriend?"
He couldn't let that get in his life, right?
And then? Well, he kind of ran home to make sure he got there before it started to get dark and he lost the protection of the mantle of the sun. He had already been forced to make three different excuses for his group of friends about why he couldn't go out at night this time.
>vampires have no venom (I prefer this version, there would be too many vampires if creating them was accidental). So, being bitten by a vampire doesn't make you one (I like the version of the vampire drinking your blood and you have to drink his)
"Good morning, I guess, for you too."
“You made him laugh! It's a good start. What did you say?” Neville asked excitedly.
Crookshank snorted at him, leaving with his face and tail raised in contempt.
Teddy felt a hot, wet breath behind him. He turned in fright, facing the icy snout of an animal at least three times its size. He raised both hands to his mouth in amazement.
Uncle Draco shook his head. Teddy looked at him in agreement. Uncle Harry was crazy. They couldn't invade the park ... Okay. Uncle Draco just blew up the gate lock with a spell.
So for the past 37 days, he had been secretly becoming healthier overnight. In a short time, his muscles would be marked under his clothes, his entrances would stop advancing, his hair would be light and silky again as it was in his twenties. Perhaps he would even let them grow again. And the colleagues from the firm and Martha from the front desk would say "You look so young Dave" and he would say "I know".
Comments:
"No further. Does not matter. The question is: Do you like him?"
“What are you doing here?” He snarled.
Ronald sat in an armchair with his legs curled up against his chest, looking at the blonde suspiciously. “What kind of name is Draco? Are you one of those guys who pretend to be a vampire or something?”
Harry knew what his favorite sweets were (Belgian chocolate, the ones his mother sent him in the owl mail, but not the ones in the yellow packaging), where he liked to spend time alone (under the second tree, from left to right, of greenhouse number 3) and that his favorite book was "The Tales of Beedle, the Bard", more precisely, "The Warlock's Hairy Heart".
They both sat uncomfortably on the couch, not looking at each other in the eye.
Speaking of Mrs. Malfoy, Narcissa had been much more friendly than Harry had expected. Okay, maybe she still had the same face as someone who has shit under her nose all the time, but in general, she was friendly and seemed happy with her son's happiness, even though the relationship seemed a little strange at first, she soon became comfortable. Who really hated him was Cassius, Lucius' favorite albino peacock, whom he had made a point of keeping and with whom he needed to correspond regularly from prison with photos and greeting cards of the peacock. Draco had told him that he was sure his father would die of heartbreak if they had gotten rid of the bird. Neither his boyfriend nor Narcissa liked the animal very much, but, he tolerated them. Harry, on the other hand, had the slight impression that he could still be murdered during his sleep by the peacock.
Harry spread his arms in confusion. What's wrong with him?? A stranger just broke into his home! Harry turned away from the stranger fearlessly, grabbing the phone and dialing.
"OK. Turn your back." Said Uncle Draco.
"I'm just going to take care of this here, okay? I'll find you later." Said Blaise, and dragged the unconscious man into the alley.
“Hmm…?”  Harry did not answer, confused, not knowing how to explain the origin of the man without being instantly placed in a sanatorium.
Ginny and Luna each removed a sock and Draco took off his jacket, causing Ronald to grumble.
"I never said that."
The blond snorted. Both friends came from a clan different than his, which had been broken up on a territorial issue and had moved to London and been adopted by Narcissa's group fifty or sixty years ago. And although they accepted the leader's recommendations, they thought this whole “life debt” story was bullshit. Draco didn't.
“You guys held hands! It was very cute! Did he ask you out? What's his name?”
Hermione ended up hanging there all day.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head in agreement. In his mind, he said “So that's it. Goodbye ”and closed the door, but that’s not what came out of his mouth and he didn’t know why, but he would probably regret it later.
To Draco's amazement, the murderous tree stopped trying to attack, returning to its initial position and remaining immobile from there. "How did you ...?"
"I thought that the bat-turning part, fangs..." And to demonstrate, opened his mouth and pointed both canines with the indicators "And all that had convinced you".
"Well, I suppose if you still feel like I haven't paid my debt, I have to stay."
"We understood man. But Mione is right." Said the redhead, putting an arm around his girlfriend's shoulders. Since the end of the wizarding war, their relationship has remained as firm as the stone walls of the castle. "You are exaggerating. MAYBE Malfoy is acting kind of weird, I mean, he's always been kind of weird and ... You got the point! But, nothing more than expected."
(See the end of the chapter for
They would sit in awkward silence and watch something on Netflix, each on one end of the couch, very different from Draco's provocative attitude two days ago, as he practically placed him on his lap. Harry did not understand exactly why. He supposed it was an attempt to escape the temptation to tear his throat out, but the sudden detachment bothered him. Harry Potter didn't know why it bothered him.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look.
Harry pulled hard on the chain. Draco needed to support himself with both hands to keep from collapsing on his body. He snarled. Harry smirked, slowly winding the chain around his hand, bringing the blonde closer, until he could hold the metal ring on the collar. With his index and middle fingers, he wrapped the silver ring, forcing his boyfriend to look up.
"Why would I do that?"
"No. I was angry that you ran. Do you know how hard it is to have anxiety and not know something, and it keeps going round and round in your head? It's very boring. And it's awful to sleep. And you still have another day without talking to me! Don't you have a cell phone?"
"He does not like me. And he just said something like "Wow, your skin is really cold" and I said something stupid. And I was clearly not in a hundred percent self-control. You saw. He must have thought I wanted to attack him."
"I don't know ..." Harry felt his hair stand on end as the vampire's icy fingers ran over his neck. "Do you want to find out?"
He looks at his desk, the part that hasn't fanned out with the wind. Pens with lids bitten in anxiety or lost forever were scattered among notebooks, books, and loose sheets. A lonely, now cold, cup of coffee looks at him disappointingly. Once again, he had slept in the middle of his studies.
“Six.”
"Fine. I said that. And that he is stubborn as fuck. And he makes all of this SO harder than it could be, because he doesn't want me there, but he also doesn't have the LEAST sense of self-preservation. In one second he is complaining that he does not need protection and blah blah blah, in the next second he is playing in front of a fucking car!"
They stared at each other in silence for a few seconds.
"Potter." He said, turning on his back. Painfully, he decided to add. "Please."
With Mr. Filch's immense disapproval, then director Minerva McGonagall was that person. Like a vivid memory of the Winter Ball, however, without the hassle of ending at midnight and, reluctantly, entitled to Whiskey of Fire and cocktails that gave off multicolored smoke that Professor Slughorn, curiously demonstrating to have formidable bartender skills, prepared.
"And would you be forced to do this thing?"
“The cafeteria guy”
Harry didn't know whether to be worried or offended.
The brunette gave an indignant interjection of pain when his thighs were roughly parted, one of them standing upright, resting on the blonde's shoulder. Harry reduced himself to a mess of sighs and moans as Draco masturbated and alternated between sucking and licking his balls and trailing to his entrance, where he deposited a generous lick.
Draco heard the Gryffindor rise and blushed as he felt his breath against his back. He decided to divert his attention to the contents in the backpack, while the brunette was unbuckling his collar.
Draco smiled and his front teeth were stained red. The brunette dry-swallowed and that made the blonde's smile widen, satisfied. Harry Potter did not move or breathe when the vampire placed a hand on his cheek, caressing it slowly and brought his face close to his ear, his breath licking his skin.
The man looked at him offended, with no intention of leaving, fleeing t9he entrance. In fact, almost playing hopscotch, running away from all the cracks and windows through which the sun's rays infiltrated, slowly warming the wooden floor.
"Okay. You said it looks like things are going too fast, didn't you?"
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!
"Good..." Draco sneezed. " ...Morning. Maybe I tore a pillow."
"Ok. Left foot. Blue."
"Stay."
"It's just to hide the marks from the bite."
Harry felt his face hot, knew he was flushed, and felt the blood swirl through his eyes. He knew the blonde must be watching him mockingly and quickly turned to face him in the challenge. But, the blonde wasn't looking at him. In fact, for the remainder of the game, the vampire seemed to move away from him intentionally, to a point where he was practically under Luna's breasts - who had proved to be a terrible player, just like Ronald - and they both laughed together. The brunette didn't know if he should be irritated because he was being avoided or worried that the vampire had decided to invest in his friend as his victim.
"Sooooo... I found a movie I think you are going to l..."
“But I don’t...”
It was Saturday morning and Hermione had just arrived - Actually, she had arrived the day before, but she thought it was better to go home, bathe, unpack, see her boyfriend, update him with all the details about her month off and laugh at and scold the photos os him running naked down the street in the middle of the night- in the city.
>Creating a new vampire is a big responsibility, as the newly created vampire depends entirely on his creator to deal with the new reality at first, so, in general, vampires are created in 3 situations: a) The will to prolong the life of a human partner who would soon die in a normal situation b) create an army of the undead (which I suppose is what Voldemort would be doing if he were in this fic), but which end up being destroyed in a short time because they attract a lot of attention and break the basic rules of coexistence and security in vampire society c) A human being in a life-death situation awakens empathy in a vampire, who decides to save his life
"What is wrong with you?"
"Ah, come on!"
Teddy didn't know what was going on, but, he was more than ready.
I know we usually write Harry with stupid Gryffindor courage, but, as we know, he doesn't have much mental stability and, in a universe without magic (without Hogwarts, at least) where he has just had a reality check and has a vague idea that vampires are theoretically dangerous and don't know what to do about it yet, I think it's a valid reaction. I suppose the rule of having to be invited in does not count if you are brought against your will by a cat. This is it.
The brunette rolled his eyes. “I already told you. I'm not seeing anyone! I've never seen this man in my life and ...”
"See? It is much better than getting into the woods at dawn ... After  Aragog died, his children are even less likely to peaceful dialogue ... Actually, I think that acromantulas don't attack werewolves, right? Or attack?"
I am totally unable to put a person in the story and just kill them without feeling guilty. Sorry guys, I needed to give Dave a little spotlight before murdering him. I couldn't even kill him right. It’s up to you whether he survived or not
"I dont know. I don't even know why you are trying to 'help' ". He made quotes with his fingers. "We are not friends, after all."
Harry felt his face flush. And saw the vampire's eyes flicker in a quick change of color. As fast as it came, he walked away. He looked slightly distressed.
For Draco, the petals had appeared about two years ago. Insistently coughed at inopportune and irritating moments. The pain was more psychological than physical. A bitter and constant reminder. But now, whole flowers were deliberately forcing their way out. He knew it was only a matter of time before reaching the final stage. Right now, flowers were growing on his internal organs, spreading quickly. Maybe petals would begin to blossom in his ears or take root in his veins.
On his aimless walk, he entered a corridor. His heart ached as he watched the boy who lived absent-mindedly against the wall surrounded by his group of stupid gryffindor friends.He was looking in his direction as well. The brunette's smile made him lose his breath. Draco knew it wasn't  him, but because of some stupid joke that his redhead sidekick must have told him or something, but even so, he pretended to himself that he was motivating that smile.
Meanwhile, Harry sat in silence, not knowing where to put his face and not understanding how the vampire had gotten into that situation so easily and his friends found it completely normal. The brunette was sure that if the man turned into a bat right now and went flying across the room, everyone would clap.
The two vampires walked down the street and sat together on the hood of a parked car, under a streetlight.
Draco snorted.
"Harry. Breathe. You are talking too fast. You need to calm down. Breathe."
“So…” Gina nudged the brunette in the ribs. “How did the two of you meet?”
"I...?"
Harry rolled his eyes. His friends had no idea of personal space or privacy. He knew they would be there sooner or later, but didn't expect it to be so soon. He looked around, watching the messy house. The couch was full of socks for some reason. Probably Crookshanks had entered his drawer.
Like love, the symptoms of the disease grew over time. It could take months or even years for the first ones to appear, but as soon as the first petals came out, everything was lost.
In the middle of the sofa, without socks, legs thrown over the pillows, the brunette's head resting on the blonde's shoulder, for the first time returning to sit as close as they had sat at Harry's friends' short visit when the blonde was struggling much to purposely make him as uncomfortable as possible, just because he had been vampirophobic.
"Harry Potter!" He exclaimed, pulling him back, to lay his head back on the destroyed pillow.
The danger was folding napkins in the shape of little birds.
“Hmm…”. Harry moved slightly away from the hug, trying to smile in a friendly way, like a person who was not about to have a psychotic breakdown. “Those are Seamus and Dean” Both, hugging each other at the kitchen door, smiled, Seamus made a sloppy salute “Ginny.” Ginny made a hang loose sign “Luna you already met, Neville…”
>The need for food varies according to quantity and quality. Vampires who consume a smaller amount need to eat more regularly, whereas by draining a person (totally) of similar height, the vampire can go weeks without eating
Draco rolled his eyes. "Which is?"
“Draco!”
Another female hand tapped his arm hard in greeting, her bag slung over her shoulder and her wet hair indicated that she had just left training.
In addition, he seemed to have an opinion contrary to his own about anything they watched. He hated all the characters Harry liked and vice versa and he tended to think that all the villains were correct and to find justifications for their attitudes - many of them very reasonable, but Harry Potter's pride did not allow him to give in, besides think that some attitudes had no justification. He had also had a bad childhood and did not go around killing people - and defending them in long and heated arguments.
Sorry for the delay guys. I just broke up a five-year-long relationship and I'm feeling shitty.
“Great. Bring me coffee. I like my coffee black, like my soul.” and laughed, leaving the brunette bewildered, fleeing behind the counter.
“Is this the guy?”
"You have no sense of self-preservation Potter."
"Now make him get up." Harry smiled, putting his hands together in a single clap, looking very excited.
He cleaned the floor, threw the box away, and went to get the broom that had been left lying on the stairs, at the same point where he had fallen when he realized that the invader had simply disappeared into the air. Deciding that a bath would be a good way to clear his thoughts, he went upstairs. The cold water was a pleasant shock against his hot body, serving to distract him from his thoughts. In the meantime, his belly rumbled, reminding him that he hadn't consumed anything all day. With the towel wrapped around his waist and his hair dripping, he headed downstairs again and retrieved his cellphone.
> Life debt to a human being is less common and encouraged by few groups, while many vampires acquire a sense of post-transformation superiority and come to view humanity with contempt
"Do we?" Asked Ron, confused.
The black man had a soft, welcoming voice, but it was easy to ignore at the sight of red eyes and a mouthful of pointed fangs. And Dave passed out.
Harry snorted when the other's mouth released him. He looked up to observe the Slytherin's actions. Through his parted lips, he could see his teeth strangely sharp. The brunette threw his head back again. It was understandable that the blonde was having a hard time doing that without hurting him. Harry wondered why he hadn't at least slightly worried about it in the first place. However, that line of thought was quickly swept from his mind when the boyfriend's hand closed on his cock, masturbating him while licking his balls.
He did not want to attend the party for several reasons. First, because he didn't like dances. Second, because he knew that his presence would draw too much attention and this celebration was not about him, besides feeling too depressed when looking at the place and feeling the stark absence of many who should be there and could not. Finally, he could say that he preferred to stay and keep Draco company, who had prevented him from trying to change the date of the party, which took place during a full moon. But, it would all be a lie. The truth was that graduating meant saying goodbye. To Hogwarts, to the only place he had ever called home. And he was not ready to move on. Not yet.
Harry had no idea that, at that speed, the car would be strong enough to hurt someone. He should take her to Hermione, or to a hospital, on second thought, the hospital made more sense. But, he didn't feel able to drive now, his legs were shaking a lot.
Harry smiled, bending down to pick up something on the floor. The dog's suspicious eyes strayed from the redhead, turning his attention to the brunette, wagging his furry tail. Harry seemed pleased with the choice of a stick and the animal stood up on its hind legs and barked.
"Ownt." Harry laughed, putting his hands on his knees and bending down. "He likes you!"
Vampire Facts!
"Mate, are you having any insomnia problems or something?" Said the redhead, following his friend through the gardens. The brightness of the full moon made the night so bright that no kind of lighting spell was necessary. "Maybe you should go to the infirmary. I'm sure Madame Pomfrey would give you a calming potion."
"But this is dangerous" you must be thinking. Do not worry. He had a pepper spray and had taken a two-month self-defense course once. Besides, three in the morning was the best time to run. The streets were empty, that is, there was no one to judge him. The night was cool and the stars dotted the sky 18% of the time when it was not raining.
Uncle Harry, who was actually his godfather, but it was easier to call everyone uncle, was a very brave man. Everyone respected him a lot because he had survived an evil spell when he was just a baby and therefore had a lightning scar on his forehead. There was also the possibility that he hit his head somewhere and invented that part of the story to impress him, but there was no problem. He had also defeated the snake-faced man alone and won the wizarding war.
"I was drunk, okay? And I think that even if you have a bad taste in movies, I’ve gotten used to having you here. It's weird when you don't talk to me."
"I know what you think ..." He interrupted, bitterly, pulling the sleeve of his shirt.  "But, it's not the black mark. Never was."
A few minutes later, they were all on the street. Draco, Ginny, and Harry had put their clothes back on. Luna and Ronald had lost together and had been challenged to walk around the square three blocks away, naked. Luna hopped shamelessly, giggling with Ginny at her side, Ronald ran foolishly, his hands covering his parts, being followed by the boys trying to capture the best moments to send to Hermione.
No one noticed the shiver run through his body as Luna announced the rules.
"I don't know love, he just left."
“Strip Twister!”
Nothing happened.
On the other hand, Draco wasn’t sure if it appeared in photos or not and Harry couldn’t test it at the time - the cat was sleeping on his lap and everyone knows that you cannot remove a cat when he allows you to serve as a pillow- he just hoped that the legends wouldn't apply to modern cell phones, otherwise Simas and Dean would have some very strange pictures to explain.
"Okay."
Now that he had such close contact, he knew that lilies were a stupidly large flower.
Draco rolled his eyes. " About Lupin. Are you using me as a way to deal with his death? Am I like the new project of the great hero of the wizarding world?"
Fuck.
“Where did you get this?!”
“For one who was all embarrassed yesterday, I didn't expect to meet him again so soon ... In your room ...” And Neville smiled, the stupidest smile of all, following Luna down the hall and leaving the brunette perplexed, who practically had to run to catch up with them.
His room, THEIR room - which Harry still couldn't say without a laugh, because Gryffindors can not mature - in turn, he was decorating little by little and it said a lot about both. The pictures on the walls, the Quidditch references, the particular Slytherin bookcase, and ... a corkboard that was filling up with ribbons and Draco had no idea where they came from.
“Vampires. Werewolves. Other humans. From the furry demon, you create as a pet and sooner or later will kill you in your sleep… Most likely other humans, humans are treacherous…”
“Good afternoon...” His eyes widened when the blonde went over his chest with his fingertips, hitting the little sign that read his name “Harry Potter. Do you have ‘O’ negative?” The blonde smiled, the tips of his white canines being momentarily visible.
Sorry for the delay guys. I lost this chapter two times because of computer errors and was so fucking pissed I gave up trying to write it for a week each time it happened. So, here it is.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are not being very polite. I just want to talk".
"Draco ... Do you have anything to do now? Like, are you busy?"
"What if he doesn't come back?"
“You won’t” His tone was low and dangerous. He brought his face closer to the table, so close that his lips could touch if Harry moved to the side.  “What would stop me from killing you now? Worrying about it is useless.” As sudden, as it came, his face turned away, with a half-smile “And your comment was very vampirephobic.”
Draco snarled. Something about him knew that that was not the tone of voice that the brunette used to give him orders during the nights of the full moon and that he was just trying to provoke him. Still, Harry Potter possessed such a skill of Gryffindor irritation that it was difficult to ignore.
"What kind of things?" Hermione raised an eyebrow and then smiled. "Like putting you to bed?"
“Forcing you to stop ignoring me.”
"..."
"Potter." He said, lifting an open can out of the bag. "I really don't want to know, but, I'll ask anyway ... Have you been giving me dog biscuits?"
"He kissed you?"
"Crookshanks!"
For the first time, he did not check the windows and locks suspiciously, nor did he pay attention to the faint flapping of bat wings and unknown shadows licking the floor. He knew he would be there.
Embarrassed under the brunette's eyes, Draco covered the mark again. "Again, thank you for not telling anyone."
"Yeah."
Wanted so much.
“Hey.” The brunette almost fell backward, when the blonde's face suddenly appeared, as always, upside down, in the window. “I can hear you. You don’t need to do that”.
"Uncle Harry? What are you doing?!"
Draco laughed, but before he could respond, her hand cupped his chin.
Hanahaki:The unrequited love disease.
Neville smiled, his face red. “Me”.
"Now that we finished school."
Draco laughed, approaching the brunette, one hand holding his face. Harry froze in place. It was the first time that the blonde had physically approached him in the last few days. "Jealous?"
"Go back to your seat and stop arguing."
"Wow."
The brunette had to control the urge to throw the remote control against the glass. With all the stability he could muster, he walked stiffly to the window.
“Because you are a fucking vampire!”
For that and other reasons, and with three and a half months of obsessive observation, Harry finally came to his final conclusion, which perhaps Hermione would have gotten in about five minutes.
“Protect from what?” He said back, wondering if "protecting" involved continuing to walk on the roof of his house during the night.
Harry laughed, bending his knees to be closer to the blond's line of sight.
In addition, Harry had acquired strange habits and apparently got some kind of giant dog, which he was determined to teach several tricks and, for some reason, only took for a walk at totally crazy times, be it ten at night or four in the morning.
“You can compensate me by getting the fuck out of my life, for example.”
"Did Granger do it? " Draco asked, scraping his tongue with his teeth to try to get the taste out of his mouth.
“Are there other vampires? And werewolves? And ... Don't throw coffee on the plant!”
If anyone is wondering, Draco's family has a blood bank. He didn't leave in five minutes, killed an elderly man, filled his cup with fresh blood, and came back. He just carries it around, because hydrating is important.
"Oh! It was great! I have so many things to tell you and ..."
Draco's eyes widened, suddenly concerned.
And then he stopped, blinking as if he noticed something. He released him, rising, resting a hand on either side of the brunette's head, his hair unforgivably messy. Harry also blinked at him, confused.
The blond man's eyebrows came together and his mouth opened in an offended circle. For a few seconds, they stared at each other in indignant silence, listening to the muffled phone ring, until someone on the other end answered.
“Draco will make one for you, I got groceries this week.” He said, without turning around.
"We're going to the park!" He exclaimed.
“Was that the best joke you could think of?”
The brunette's hand rested on his head, caressing him with light, short movements. Draco closed his eyes. It was as if, for the first time in a long time, everything, including himself, was fine. At that moment, he felt truly happy.
His head found the cold tile of the bathroom floor.
"Hm?"
Harry saw the black man roll his eyes and walk out the door, dragging the woman after him, as well as the blonde transforming into a bat before him and flying fast behind them.
"What thing?"  Snd felt Hermione's nails pierce his arm  "Aaaaah, that thing. It is true. Sorry, Harry."
>In Narcissa's case, she was saved AND fell in love with a human being, so she has a weakness for them (although she also sees them as pathetic, silly and fragile creatures that need to be taken care of often or they will die, like hamsters) and she was the one who found Harry's attitude honorable and asked Draco to look after him.
"It does not matter. That's not what I'm talking about. It was kind of weird.
A meow alerted him in the other room. Harry ran back in, brandishing his broom like a sword, but found it empty. On the stairs, a man and a cat were surprised.
“Then he asked me out and now here we are.”
"So,  you meet him at the cafe and invite him to come here and ...?"
Harry seemed to remember how to breathe again, taking his body off the wall and looking toward the door where a cheerful Luna Lovegood with the cat on her arms and a confused Neville Longbotton stared at him.
Neville shut him up with a hand signal and shooed him away with another.
Draco's eyes blinked twice more and returned to normal color and he got up quickly.
Hermione narrowed her eyes again and nodded in agreement. Harry admired his friend's patience and ability to try to understand him amid his diffuse and superficial responses. "Right. And you are afraid that this..." Hermione used the most abstract term possible, which fit the conversation very well because neither of them really knew what "this" was all about. "Is it just because he thinks he needs to repay you in some way?"
In a burst of epiphany, Neville recognized the blond man, his mouth open in surprise, and his hands quickly rising to cover it. He looks from Draco to Harry and from Harry to Draco repeatedly, while the blonde is still standing at the same place, smiling.
And Harry laughed nervously.
"Fine. Tell them this, then."
To his indignation, the man did not go out of the open door.
"What do you got there?"
"I would not." Blaise, the tallest man, said.
"I have some business with a friend... I came to warn you to lock the doors and not help strangers anymore."
The brunette snorted. "And I'm a mermaid. Seriously Dray. Do you want to talk about it? We can come back tomorrow."
"Hey!" Harry snapped his fingers, still laughing. "Snowball! Stay!"
"How the fuck would I guess what to do?"
Harry shook hands apprehensively, looking out the window. Until the blond man appeared through the glass, looking outraged. Without stopping to think, Harry opened the window, allowing the man to roll into his room, his hands full of fur, scratches, and a furious Crookshanks. He took the cat from the vampire's hands and looked at him fearfully. But, fortunately, the blonde did
Without an answer, he prepared to hit the ceiling with the broom handle.
Harry's eyes widened as if he'd been caught red-handed, but Draco only raised an eyebrow.
“Pff ... Cowards.” Ronald said. He was very competitive. Personally, he would prefer it to be chess or snooker, but we have to take advantage of the opportunities that life gives us. “And you Dracula, will you chicken out too?”
"I think I would feel a little bad killing him like that." Said Draco, being the first to break the silence.
“You don't have that option. I would just be forced to protect you for the rest of your mortal life.”
The box still in the middle of the kitchen and the small pieces of fruit scattered on the floor of the room that he collected while Crookshanks surrounded his legs proved that yes, everything had been very real. At least the bat part at least. Which made it very strange. Tripping over the cat got him out of his stupidity
"Hey, kid! Didn't you realize what time it is? Don't you know that it is dangerous to be alone in a dark street at such an hour?"
Draco's eyes narrowed. "What did she say to you?"
"Oh, from the way Ron told me, he implied that they almost found you fucking on the kitchen table. When was that?"
Luna chuckled, walking to the center of the room and sitting on the arm of the sofa, her legs draped over her girlfriend's lap. “Now we!”
“Hello, Draco!” Ginny and Neville chanted it together, like children welcoming the new student into the kindergarten class.
For this reason, in a few weeks, the small group was gathered in the Room of Requirements, converted into a small room with sofas, ottomans and tables spread out while studying for the NIEMS, the exams of completion of the course. Hermione had selected such an extraordinarily large pile of books that could make one asleep with just a look and which Madame Pince would certainly not have given to another student at once.
Hermione took a long sip of her coffee, slowly. "Explain better."
"Crookshanks, no!"
Harry pulled away to force the blonde to get up and fight him. He was experienced enough to know how much of a provocation Draco Malfoy could take without fighting back. In the next instant, his back was against the wall, and the blonde's hand was splayed beside his head. Draco had the same irritated look as Hermione. Harry had been dealing with that kind of look for eight years and it still wasn't less terrifying.
"Can I ask you two questions?"
They both stared at each other in silence, before laughing.
"In the beginning, Professor Lupin was also very afraid. He was afraid of being judged, of being abandoned by the friends he had made at Hogwarts, of being persecuted ... And you know what happened? Two third-year students, actually three, but one doesn't count ... My godfather and my father, studied alone and became illegal animagi. Even though they knew they could have been expelled. Just to make the life of their best friend more bearable, keeping company. Because werewolves won't attack animals, at least, not for no reason ..."
What would his father think if he saw him there, lying on the floor of the abandoned bathroom?
Harry Potter was cornered against the wall of an empty room by a rather enraged blonde.
"No. Nothing. Draco! I didn't say anything, ok? And even if I did, no one would care. You know it."
Stupid lilies.
Harry stood in silence. He hadn't heard the man going around the side of the house and lean against the window, until he heard his voice and without an answer, it was impossible, without opening the curtains, to know if he was still standing there listening to his movements, trying to know what he was going to do.
"So, you didn't think it was bad ...? Didn't I scare you?"
"What are we supposed to be seeing?" Hermione narrowed her eyes.
The doorbell rang.
"No ... Why would you scare me?"
Lilies had thick, disgusting pollen that made his mouth bitter and dried his throat.
“You said to me I should not kill your friends and I'm not killing them. What difference does it make?”
Uncle Draco had a large open book and a cauldron where he stirred a stinking purple potion. "Hi, love." Replied the uncle, adding some dry leaves to the mixture, forming small explosions on the surface of the liquid and making the smoke change colours.
"He's not dumb. He just wants to help everyone all the time and is super worried that his friends are fine and even takes care of that demonic cat just to be nice, even though I'm sure the cat is just waiting for the right moment to eat his eyelids while he sleeps and..."
The redhead nodded, not looking the least bit at ease in knowing that the candies had not been found on the floor or anything.
Harry crossed his arms, not sure what to say. Both stood in the middle of the room, avoiding to look at each other, in silence for a while, until the brunette sighed.
The brunette opened the fridge, being disappointed to discover the lack of milk. He really wanted hot cocoa. He decided to go to the market. That way, he could even buy some marshmallows and make a cup just like the one he made for his customers at work. That was it.
"Good. So I think we can be friends Harry Potter..." When he held out his hand, his nails were slightly longer.
"I thought of writing 'snowball' " He laughed, deflecting a hex. "Because your fur is white as the sn ..."
"Draco? Are you awake?"
Draco dodged a low branch, skirting a broad trunk, penetrating the forest. Even with the last rays of sunlight disappearing on the horizon, he had no difficulty seeing inside the forbidden forest. In the intervals of the canopy of trees, it was possible to observe thousands of stars dotting the black sky as the night progressed and with it, the moon.
"Hey." Draco stopped, leaning against the doorway.
Draco followed him up the stairs. He looked at the walls as if they were old friends and told him funny stories. Draco didn't complain when he made him sit beside him on the dusty floor.
"Get the fuck out of my house!" He ordered, his voice trembling, closing the curtains.
Vampires were great liars and seducers and tried to gain the sympathy and trust of their victims before approaching. Probably. Harry wouldn't let that last part prove itself. He walked to the windows and grabbed the curtains.
"So you took a sample to evaluate the composition of his pumpkin juice?" Neville suggested, also preventing Ron from stealing his potatoes.
When he put his head on the pillow, he didn't know what he should feel.
“And the Mr. Grinch there is Ronald”. Luna completed.
But, of course, that would never happen.
In the first few days that the vampire-man started showing up at his windows, he confesses to being very scared, but by the third day, it was just annoying. It wasn’t as if the man was even making an effort to try to get in. He was also not giving in either. Without knowing the extent to which part of "seduce victims" was true, he would rather not test his luck. Deciding to simply ignore the blonde.
>Vampires are extremely territorial creatures and small clans and / or family groups defend the regions in which they live and hunt, and solitary vampires generally end up at a disadvantage by staying with more dangerous regions and competing with each other, tending to enter larger groups or create their own, for survival reasons.
"Mister Potter."
"Barking dogs never bite, Malfoy."  He pointed, deflecting a stinging hex as quickly as possible. " That was not the kind of thanks I expected ..."
"No. Yes. I don't know. I mean, it's not like I helped him by wanting something in return. To tell you the truth I hoped he would just get out of my life. But, now I don't know."
Harry Potter had and always would have a hero complex. Draco knew that if he didn't agree, Potter would insist and insist until he did. He still couldn't figure out what his goal was, but at the moment, with the moonlight rising darkly behind the dirty window and his gums itching, Draco just wanted him to stop talking.
“That part is a lie. I could get in the whole time. I'm just polite. Good night.”
Maybe it would help the pain go away.
"You stayed here all night?" The blonde asked, his voice hoarse.
"He kissed me. I kissed him. It doesn't matter. We kissed and it was so weird!"
"Who told you that?"
"Crabbe even died!" Ron pointed.
"See? Even Crookshanks agrees."
"Aren't you angry? For real?"
"OK. It's not a potion that difficult. Maximum that can happen is it doesn't work."
"Get in. Draco, this is Hermione, the cat's owner."
Draco frowned. "I think not. Why?"
“A little annoying, but, yes, he is nice”.
Sometime before, still lying on the living room floor, Harry Potter would look at the offensive boner in his pants. "Shit."
"Are you sure it's a good idea?" Uncle Draco asked.
I think the idea that vampires would have anesthetic saliva like some of the blood-sucking animals is cool. Sorry, not sorry.
Draco opened his mouth to complain, but no sound came out. The brunette's eyes had strayed from his. He followed the look. Harry was staring at his lower body. Then he looked up with a mischievous smile.
Well, that was basically what he was doing at the time.
"Mr. Potter ?! Who is this man?! Where's your dog ?!"
“The guy you are dating with?”
The black mark on his arm burned, but his throat had stopped scratching.
"Nothing! Guys!?"
“Yeah Harry, aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?”
He knew that Mrs. Weasley would have a nervous breakdown if she knew he was planning his first meal of the day at five o'clock in the afternoon and that it would be pizza again, but honestly, he wasn't in a position to think much now and stay in the comfort zone just once wouldn’t kill him.
Harry sighed, turning his chair around and sitting back with it facing the opposit side, his face resting on it's back "I know this is not the best moment of your life, of all of us actually. But I also know that it is not easy to be a werewolf, let alone go through it alone. Maybe I'm not the person you want to see in front of you right now, but, maybe I'm the person you need. So what do you tell me? Can you at least give it a try?"
Draco looked at himself startled, afraid to see the hideous lilies growing directly from his wrists. Seeing nothing did not make him more relieved. He covered his face with his hands. It was just a matter of time to reach the last stage ... The flowers would finally be enough to clog his lungs and windpipe, choking him like the words of love never spoken aloud, stuck deep in his throat.
“This plant belongs to Neville and if she dies he will kill m…” Harry interrupted himself, smiling at his friend who had just passed by, carrying a tray with some slices of cake. On the way back, Neville gave a thumbs up again. “I do not believe you.”
He wanted to say something. To offend the female Weasley. He would have given anything to snarl some provocation. But he felt himself choking, his throat filling with flowers, the air missing in his lungs. He walked past them at a quick pace, hitting his shoulder with Gina Weasley's as hard as he could in the process, running away without looking back.
He glanced at his face in the mirror and looked more dead than alive. In the corner of the mirror, a heart enveloped an “H + D” made of purple lipstick, the color that Luna used, making the brunette roll his eyes, but find it funny. He washed his face with cold water, patting his cheeks to wake up. Funny. Harry was quite sure that there should be a cut there, where he had hit the asphalt when…
Harry stared at him for a moment, curling his tongue, not knowing what to say.
Time stopped for a second, which seemed to take several years. Students who could hear the conversation froze in the act. Seamus' fork, with a piece of blueberry pie hanging, hung in midair, dropping some of the fillings on his pants. As much as Ginny knew the good terms on which their relationship had ended, her face did not fail to warm up in defiance. At that moment, the entire Gryffindor table knew that Romilda Vane was going to die.
Draco understood and laughed.
It was getting really worse.
"About the life debt bid. You don't necessarily have to SAVE my life, do you? You had told me that it had to be something of equal value, right?"
"Sir?"
Before he could have any other muddy thoughts, he was thrown against the asphalt.
"Thursday night."
Having the talk with Hermione had been a relief and spending time with friends was a great way to distract him from his anguish the day before. I mean, it's not like he can take Hermione's advice and go after the blonde, is it? He didn't even know where he lived or if vampires even lived anywhere. Maybe there was some kind of Batcave in some London suburb or whatever.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pushed harder, causing him to turn, on his stomach, loosening the collar strap from his wrist. "Ouch! Snowball!"
Thus, Harry dragged the Slytherin into his cycle of lions (and a Ravenclaw). To his surprise, Draco would eventually develop a strange affinity for Luna Lovegood, Neville seemed to have overcome his fear of him since the first year and, amazingly, Ginny had acquired an extremely close friendship with Pansy Parkinson, who at some point had decided she was supposed to investigate who his baby was walking with (dragging a sheepish Blaise Zabini along).
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shhh! Shhhhh! Hey! It's okay… What's your name?"
Harry got startled, interrupting his way to the place next to his friend to observe the black-haired Gryffindor whose name he had apparently forgotten. In fact, he wasn't too concerned with looking at her, since a certain person was making his way through the Great Hall to the Slytherin table, about to pass a few feet from him with Pansy Parkinson by his side.
Harry adjusted his seat belt, which was hurting his neck. He let out a loud breath when big white paws stepped on his thigh. Harry opened the glass of the taxi, allowing the dog to stick his head out the window, sitting half on his lap, as he was too big to do so, but he insisted on trying anyway. The taxi driver continued to start a conversation, telling about his life. Maybe because of time, he needed to do it to stay awake. Perhaps due to a lack of attention. Harry didn't care in any way.
"Why? " Draco smirked. "Does this turn you on?"
"Ro, I already told you that..."
"I'm going to kill you!"
Draco bent down to stay level with the boy, whose hair shone golden yellow, the colour it took on when Teddy was anxious. Cupped hands, he whispered back. "But it is a very secretive secret. What if Monster is listening behind the door?"
"No."
"And...?"
"So what was it? "
Harry Potter looked confused for a moment.
He stood up quickly, adjusting his round glasses. "Erm…?" With a new surprise, he realized that he was still sitting on the blonde's lap, and instead of standing up, among the millions of thoughts that crossed his head at that moment, he chose the most stupid. "That's weird. Your mouth is very cold."
Draco turned the contents over at one shot. Harry laughed with the face that the blonde did. He knew that the taste was unpalatable and could not be improved in any way as it would detract from the potion's effectiveness. Good. If it tasted so bad, it must be all right.
"Why, wasn't she your friend? Telling your friends not to kill me is not really my vision of having my life saved."
It was starting to drizzle. He went out spinning the car keys and tripping over a bottle of beer that had been forgotten. There was no one on the street. He didn't even bother to look in the mirror when he left until he heard a thud and a groan.
As much as it was killing him.
"I did nothing wrong!" Harry raised the tone of his voice.
"Good night".
“Combine business with pleasure and bring more lemon!” Shouted Seamus, and it was the last thing Harry heard before closing the kitchen door.
The redhead rolled his eyes, making the group of friends laugh. Harry's eyes widened again. The blonde slid fluidly behind him, resting a hand on the curve of his back.
Harry Potter positioned the steaming coffee cup in front of the man, standing like an idiot. On the other side of the counter, Neville made a discreet gesture as he indicated that he should be seated. The brunette groaned, obeying.
Luckily, he had covered the box and the little animal in it, that is, if it were still alive, it was safe. He opened the box. The water was spilled all over the surface and the bat was huddled in a dry corner, away from where Harry had placed it in the morning.
The cat passed between his legs, fast as the wind, unbalancing him. Harry barely had time to think about anything before falling forward, taking the blonde with him to the rug. When he opened his eyes, he found the other storm-colored pair staring at him and realized with horror that their lips were pressed together.
not have any apparent intention of attacking him.
He had left the Transfiguration class in a hurry. For a moment, he thought the hoarse, spaced cough would not get in the way. How naive of him. Soon, the crisis turned into an endless series. The professor's serious gaze stared at him, but he didn't have time to see it, leaving the room, spitting gasping excuses, running towards the first place that crossed his mind: The second floor girls' lavatory
"You already did."
“Harry Saint Potter is seeing someone!” Said the redhead, raising the soda can in an imaginary toast to himself. “Do I know them?”
"You are in charge… " Luna smiled. "Ok, and no eliminations! Every time someone stops in the red, the person takes one piece of clothing and, obviously, we can only take one part of the body from the floor at a time to take it off, if someone falls, take another piece of clothing, but, remains in the game! And whoever has more clothes at the end wins."
Harry rolled his eyes, mockingly, making Draco even more annoyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry left his side, crawling to the foot of the bed and getting up. Draco rolled his eyes, rolling to the side without throwing in the towel. But in the next second, a tightening of his neck made him lift his head. He forgot that he was still wearing a collar.
They both turned in the direction Harry was facing, where a melancholic Draco Malfoy was playing with his dinner, across the room, at the Slytherin table.
Once there, he remembered that his cellphone was in the car, but he could hear the door opening and someone calling his name - or some very similar sound - followed by an exclamation sound and a thump of something falling on the floor. Harry ran down the stairs. Upon arriving in the room, he found a strange scene. The door was open, the unknown girl was lying in the middle of the room, Draco dragged her by the legs, defending himself from kicks - strangely, from the same foot that she claimed to have broken - while Crookshank pulled her hair. All three, cat included, stopped to look at him for a second, before continuing what they were doing.
"Hey."
The man huffed.
Neville had a chubby red face and his hands covered his mouth, hiding giggles.
“No, no! That's exactly what I don’t want you to do!”
"Can I ask you a question?"
He was going to die without the humiliation of being rejected by Harry Potter, who would never know about his feelings and perhaps hate him even more.
However, today was a different day. Today, he, Uncle Draco and Uncle Harry were going out. The three together all day looooong. Uncle Draco said it was very important and that he had a secretive secret to tell him. Teddy was a big boy and was ready to keep his uncle's secretive secret. He was very anxious to leave soon, but Uncle Harry had gone out to help capture the runaway manticore...
"Help!" He shouted "Help ... hmpf!"
“You saved my life”
Harry rolled his eyes. Damn Hermione. He was sure that the friend had purposely left the cat as an excuse to return the next day if he came with any excuse for not going to lunch with the Weasley family.
For the fifteenth time, he put his cell phone back on the counter, from where he had left numerous times in his dilemma of calling Hermione or not, concluding that “Hi Hermione, your cat brought another dead animal, but it was alive and turned into a handsome guy and then went flying ”was not a good topic for conversation between mentally stable people.
Ginny lowered the beer, placing it on the arm of the sofa. “So Harry, aren't you going to introduce us to your ...? “
"Did you buy me candy?"
He rubbed his hands together and picked up the small pile of paper on his desk, gathering the leaves and tapping them on the wood so that they were aligned and gazed, in awe, at the first assignment in his life that he had not done at the last minute. This time, he really needed the extra credit and, unfortunately, Professor Snape, also known as the strictest professor at his college, did not like him at all and would not accept a half-ass job. Not even Hermione, who had had a subject with him the previous year, had been able to finish with perfect grades, so the brunette knew he needed to write the best report of his life if he wanted to stay at least average.
The approach came like a tsunami. First, all of Hogwarts watched, confused, as the sea parted, with the quarreling lessening and the sudden friendship. Then, the first wave took everyone by surprise. At first, it was hard to believe the gossip that the hero of the wizarding world and the ex-death eater would be together. Mainly because the Slytherin himself seemed to be afraid of the change in the attitude of the brunette towards him. Meanwhile, the blonde was looked at with suspicion, because, it was not possible! There must be something strange, probably dark arts, that explained Harry Potter's new flirtatious behavior.
“You already said that. I mean after me”.
Sometime later, at the city limits, the black man would say. "Protecting, yeah? Right."
The animal looked very limp and unresponsive in its hands. He didn't know what to do. In a cardboard box, he placed a towel and the inert bat. There would be no vets to see him now. And if there were, probably not to meet a bat. Maybe he'll get better on his own.
Harry squinted with effort, trying to understand the smudge of ink and scribbles that was his friend Ronald Weasley's handwriting. He knew he should have waited for Hermione to complete her notes and borrow hers to study for the NIEMS, but there were 3 lines left to finish his spell report for the next class in two days and that abstract work was his best option at the moment.
Where he was? Where were they all? Had he been put on the couch and fallen asleep? Had his friends seen him try to jump in front of a moving car? Did they think it was an accident? Had they been worried? Had Ronald drawn dicks on his face with a permanent pen while he was unconscious?
"And you are telling me this emotional story because ...?"
The brunette inked the last period, sighing contentedly. Perhaps the letters were larger than in the rest of the paper and the words on the last three lines were more widely spaced than those in the rest of the text, but Professor Flitwick wouldn't mind. He rolled up the parchment, putting it inside his backpack as he threw his other hand over his shoulder, looking for his white furball. His fingers found bare skin, which moved under the touch, making the bed creak.
As much as it hurt.
"Shit Crookshanks!" Harry exclaimed, startled, pushing the cat away with his hand.
At first, the Slytherin himself seemed a little confused, especially when he was sitting alone at the green and silver table discreetly sipping a cup of black coffee, and a loud Gryffindor took place beside him.
Harry had gone back to work, of course, and Draco had not risked going out in broad daylight -Harry hadn't asked, but due to the only nightly appearances and the number of clothes he wore when he showed up at the coffee shop the week before, he was assuming that the sun really did some kind of damage, lethal or not, for vampires - having no urgent business to deal with.
Draco looked away.
"Hm?"
Draco felt like an idiot just thinking about it.
Tiptoeing up the stairs. Crookshanks ran between his legs, causing a shiver. His finger floated over the dial button as if it were a trigger. He didn't know what Hermione could do. It wasn't like she was going to teleport to the house, lecture the man and make him run. Even so, the shadow of her existence made him feel a little more secure.
“Juice.”
"About?"
"Yeah."
Before his eyes, the blond man in front of him turned into a bat and took off in a flight and swift through the door. The cat meowed victoriously, kicking the imaginary dust behind and got back into the house.
The blonde shrugged, following him into the living room.
"It's nothing Malfoy. I was kind of bored at some point watching you chase the biting fairies and transfigured a pillow for you. I even wrote your name. Did you like it?"
It took a while for Hermione and Ron to get used to the new blonde presence in their lives. The presence itself did not like the idea of being present in Harry's group of friends. But, the brunette seemed genuinely happier with him around and Draco Malfoy seemed to have become a kinder person after the war. Hermione thought everyone deserved a second chance, and if the second chance would make her best friend happy, even better.
It was strange at first. Without the need to play a role for the brunette's friends and flirt and tease him so often, whereas Harry didn't have to worry about the safety of his friends or discovering the blond's true identity, both did not know very well how to behave.
When Hermione arrived, she wasn't exactly surprised. With the tired look of someone who had tried to do her homework without disturbance in the Gryffindor Common Room and failed miserably, Hermione entered the precise room unmoved. Her presence was not noticed except for a Draco who scornfully watched his new boyfriend, Seamus, and Dean - who, apparently, had forgotten they were magicians - trying to smother the fire that had spread to the sofa with the covers. On the other sofa, Neville and Blaise faced each other in uncomfortable silence, which, on the other hand, was much better than participating in the discussion between Ronald, Ginny, and Pansy. With all the patience in the world, Hermione extinguished the small fire with a non-verbal spell and approached the group that was arguing, placing her hand on Ginevra's shoulder, which was her best bet to be the sensible mind at the moment.
“Wingman Neville, to the rescue!” Ginny predicted, making Neville laugh.
“That's why it is a surprise!” The blonde smiled.
"Uhum. The moon ..." Harry smiled, scratching Draco's neck. "The moon can be interesting."
"Potter! By Merlin's beard, I don't know how I came to agree with such a stupid idea ... Potter! Get out of there! You will die!"
Harry chuckled. "It's a dog, not a broomstick, Ronald."
The other's eyes narrowed, dyeing in red. For the first time, it was not just a flash of blood. His pupils dilated, vertical, like a cat's. Harry stared at him, almost mesmerized when he took a step forward, the brunette took one back and another, and another, until his back was glued to the wall, as well as both hands of the blonde, framed on which side of his face. When he spoke, Harry saw the glow of white fangs between his lips and swallowed dryly.
Draco paid no attention. The end of the path gave way to a house falling apart. There were claw marks on the walls and, under the furniture, the squeak of hidden biting fairies came out, as a warning not to be provoked. From the floor of the second room, a strong odor of decomposition rose, indicating that a colony of bundimun had been installed under the floor. Through the windows blackened by time, between the glass, broken by the stones of generations of students who tried to be brave to their friends and approach the abandoned house, it was possible to see the lawn that hadn't been taken care of in decades. Still, for some reason, Harry Potter had a big, stupid smile on his face.
But if there was one thing Harry Potter was an expert at, it was being completely obsessed with Draco Malfoy.
"Got it. He's dumb." Blaise shook his head.
Harry stopped laughing when a large body knocks him down on the floor.
Harry was silent for a while, before answering "I think so."
"It's like a house has appeared out of nowhere." He laughed to himself.
"Hum?" He remembered the girl.
"What?"
"Harry?" Hermione called.
"Holy shit!" He cursed. "Are you okay?!"
"That thing with Hermione..."
Draco blinked, coming out of his stupor. He looked over his shoulder. Harry Potter was sitting on the bed, completely naked - except for the round glasses he never took off - showing a half-smile. Faster than the brunette expected, the Slytherin practically threw himself on him, pushing his body over the bed.
"You are a difficult one, you know it, Harry? Bloody Hell." Said Ronald, taking off his beanie and throwing it at his friend.
"Good boy."
Harry Potter watched the party from above, sitting on a flat part of the roof, over the Gryffindor tower, listening to the rustle of the flag stuck at the top, which made it a few inches taller than the Ravenclaw tower. The sounds of the party were muffled in his ears, but they seemed happy and it made him smile.
Youngest seeker of the century in the first (and rumors that he would have killed Professor Quirrel with his bare hands, but that part was probably just rumoring);
"You are not yourself." Harry couldn't protest when he was thrown over the blonde's shoulder as if he weighed nothing.  "I'll take you home."
Draco rolled his eyes. "That's not funny, Potter. Am I a joke to you? I'm not your pet and I don't want you to treat me like that!"
Ron shook his head. "Didn't you have a less stupid name to give this thing?"
Ron wiped the saliva on the hem of his pants, taking advantage of his several inches more to use his friend as a support for his elbow, however, over the jealous, almost human, look of Harry's new pet, he quickly walked away.
"Of course not! Are you stupid? I think it's broken!" She whined.
"Don't know. With Longbottom maybe. He looks like he dances as badly as you do. You would get along."
At that moment, the black-haired girl came through the door.
"Did you see that?"
Harry filled his lungs to dump the fourth excuse and was interrupted in the process.
All eyes followed his steps as he descended the stairs and walked to the living room, feeling the blood press his eyes and the pulse of his heart in his throat.
His eyes watered when he leaned over to throw up. Again.
"I don't know Harry. You are not being very specific. It's not like I have a legal or supernatural obligation to you, it's more personal. So it depends on the situation. What are you talking about?  Because the intention of a life debt would literally be to protect your life, so I won't be wondering what would happen if you died because that is literally what I have to prevent ...?
