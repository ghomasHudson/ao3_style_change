“You’re very welcome. Don’t eat them all at once, love,” Soto says with a wink. She turns to leave, and Draco suddenly remembers to give her the letter.
Rue is always sitting into the cushions as though she is trying to sink into the leather. Except for at night, when Healer Parson coaxes her back to bed around nine o’clock. He’s watched them walk back to Rue’s cubicle before, seen how she struggles to walk, how Parson practically carries her and wonders what could’ve happened to her.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he snaps, and Draco opens his mouth to make a scathing reply, before Potter cuts him off. “Right, well, I have a job to do. Seeing as I’m your new healer, I need to ask you some questions and perform a few diagnostic charms.”
Oddly, the twins take to Draco very quickly, the three of them talking in low voices all throughout lunch. Harry watches them fondly.
He follows Potter into Madam Malkin’s, Bryn right behind him. His breath catches at the sight of a child who is unmistakably himself, standing with his arms outstretched as sewing tape measures zip around his torso.
—and focuses on what he’s doing. He’s bent slightly over his desk as he writes something, the quill scratching on the parchment.
Voldemort’s high-pitched, airy voice echoes in the courtyard, sending Draco’s skin crawling: “Harry Potter is dead, and though you have fought valiantly, it was in vain. Join us now, and no blood will be spilled. I do not wish to fight.”
The Burrow’s garden is one of Harry’s favourite places to be. It’s full of life and the touches of family. Even in winter, buried in the snow, the plants are tall and green and beautiful. It’s as messy and random as ever, and Harry loves it. Near the thicker bushes are dozens of sets of footprints — evidently, the garden gnomes still love the garden, too.
Harry had said when he returned them to a bright red, scowling Draco, who’d promptly told Harry to fuck off. They weren’t exactly on great terms then, but the memory amuses him.
“Well, in that case…” he says, trailing off, and Soto chuckles easily. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a handful of colorfully wrapped candies, depositing them onto the lunch tray. They clack pleasantly against the thin metal.
his memories back, but it’s an alluring thought. It would solve all of his problems, and he’d no longer wonder what sort of person he is or what secrets he kept.
It’s a waiting room in St. Mungo’s, and something terrible has happened. From every direction comes yelling and wails of pain, shouts of the healers for Dittany, murtlap, and sedatives. Aurors in various states of dress are appearing with loud
. He wants to reach out and open the doors, step inside and sink back in bed, but not really. Because no, no, this is all wrong, what’s he doing?
“Just you two today, or is the blondie joining ya?” Rosmerta asks as she sets the mug down heavily in front of Harry, eyes glinting mischievously. It took some time after the war for Draco to even
He has a distinct feeling that he won’t like the answers, but he doesn’t want to discard this opportunity.
Potter sighs heavily. “We got into a fight in sixth year. I didn’t know what the spell did, but it had been labelled ‘for enemies.’ So I used it on you, and I’m sorry I did. I wish I hadn’t.”
“N-no! Stop plotting things! No mistletoe!” he cuts in at last, glaring between Rosmerta and Neville. “And certainly not enchanted
“Rose,” he says, voice heavy with worry, brow furrowed. His wand is in hand immediately, casting a myriad of diagnostic and healing charms on her—presumably someone he knows.
He makes his way up the spiraling stairs, trying not to knock into anyone as he does, and he’s breathless when he finally reaches the roof. He’s surprised to see that it’s only a balcony overlooking Diagon Alley, the railing wrapping around the small tower of the shop.
“How did you get in there?” Potter asks, eyes narrowed, and the tone of his voice makes Draco stiffen.
“Besides, Gilderoy can make actual improvements with the new mind healer Potter is setting him up with—and if Potter was biased, he wouldn’t even
“Oh, yes. My name is Draco Malfoy. Do you know how to get to the Janus Thickey ward? I can’t find it,” he says, aloof. It’s difficult to speak so lightly and openly past the pounding of his heart, but he holds fast to the image of Gilderoy.
Agnes’s stare is hard when she roughly pushes her notepad back towards him a minute later, gripping her quill tightly.
Draco furrows his eyebrows, remembering the note he sent off into the storm. That must’ve been for Narcissa. Caught between wanting to know what he wrote and why she suddenly brings it up, he decides on a neutral response. “I don’t know what was in it, but I remember sending it.”
Draco does so, shifting on the narrow bed to get comfortable. He doesn’t exactly know what they mean by a “show,” and he watches curiously. Bryn clears their throat and gives him a reassuring smile before they roll up their sleeves, raising their wand.
, but it only worsens. He cries out as the pain reaches unbearable levels—more and more and more and Draco can’t
There are still healers walking about the cafeteria, but none of them are even looking in Draco’s direction. He slips past the door, turning as he slowly pulls it closed.
Anaise hoots from her perch when he approaches her. She wearily eyes the storm outside. Draco isn’t keen on sending her out in this weather, either, but she’ll fare. She’s a strong flier—more so than any owl Draco’s known.
With a sigh, he removes his breakfast tray from his bed and places it in the armchair, slipping under the blankets and just listening to the rain. Rhythmic, soft pattering.
Draco steps into Soto’s office and shuts the door gently behind him. It clicks softly as it falls into place. To his right is a large filing cabinet, which he decides to look through first. Soto’s desk is against the left wall, an armchair between it and the door. He quickly sets the mugs down on the desk before turning to the filing cabinet, hoping it’s not locked or warded.
Harry sits up in bed and rubs his eyes, his cream-coloured blanket pooling around his waist, and he’s pleasantly surprised to see the fire still going from last night — however blurry his vision may be. The House Elves must have remembered his room this morning, for the first time in forever.
Harry hums in understanding and finishes off his breakfast. He thinks he knows what Neville is up to — what he’s
Draco stares at the staircase for a long time after Potter disappears, waiting for his eyes to stop burning before he slips back into the ward.
Harry shuts off the lights in his quarters with a flick of his wand, then makes his way down to the Great Hall as usual. He tries not to look too long at Draco when he sits beside Neville — who gives him a suspicious look, like all of Harry’s thoughts are written on his face. Harry only hopes that his thoughts aren’t obvious to
A breeze rustles Harry’s hair. Shouts and laughter float up from below. He walks around the balcony, leaning close to the building and wondering if Draco isn’t up here after all, but then he sees him, and Harry’s thoughts are carried off with the wind.
And something unexpected happens. 👀 Sorry to keep you waiting on the mystery of the potion. But don't worry, you'll learn all about it next chapter - along with some
that his name appears in (MALFOY OUT OF AZKABAN, REDEEMED OR RUINED?) It’s from 2002. It’s not a headline piece, and the small photo of him included beneath the article is very unflattering, but it’s information nonetheless.
For a moment, Draco almost doesn’t want to remember that, thoughts darkening when he considers what must’ve happened to him.
Draco edges towards his curtains, pulling them aside slightly so he can peer out into the ward. He notes, with a small shake of his head, that Agnes and Gilderoy are doing the same, both from her cubicle. He’s startled to see an unfamiliar face with them, a wizard with a gaunt face and dark hair, before he realizes it must be the new patient.
“What do you mean?” Draco asks wearily. Agnes tenses, and he can practically feel her irritation grow, rolling off of her as she writes. He doesn’t understand what he’s doing so wrong.
“Put her down here,” Potter finally says, gesturing to an empty chair beside him. Memory-Draco complies, placing her down gently as if afraid she'll break. “Thank you for helping her. For bringing her to me. Are—are Ron and George okay?”
Memory-Draco asks for Potter’s surname, and Potter doesn’t get to reply before the world dissolves around them, fading into grey haze.
He shoves himself away, world lurching as he does, and inhales deeply through his nose. He doesn’t trust his stomach enough to open his mouth.
And as he watches, the mark starts to burn slightly, the pain steadily growing with each passing second, and Draco gasps. It darkens until it’s pitch black against his skin, the snake slithering through the skull with a soundless hiss.
But somehow, through the chaos, Draco is drawn to Potter, not much younger than he is now. His green eyes are sharp and blazing, managing to bark instructions to the other healers as they all turn to him for direction.
,” Draco once commented, and it’s stuck with Harry since. It was years ago — back when Draco’s hair was still short and slicked back, sleeves always pulled down over his forearms, and Harry whole-heartedly believed he would end up with Ginny.
And worse, when he pushes back the curtains of his cubicle, Potter is sitting in the armchair and reading an old issue of the
“How kind of you,” Draco mutters sarcastically. Potter stares at him for a moment, probably asking himself why he even attempts to be nice, before he rolls his eyes.
Potter stands from the armchair, and Draco’s throat tightens slightly when he pulls out his wand. It never bothers him when Soto has her wand around him. But something about Potter having a wand pointed at him leaves him… nervous.
Harry almost forgot about the fact that Draco has his glasses. The blond pulls them from his pocket and holds them out to Harry. He takes them with a muttered “
capable of doing, too—he’s been adamant to bring a memory specialist to see both Draco and Gilderoy, and Draco has a meeting with the healer later in the afternoon.
A wave of heat rushes over Harry when he enters The Three Broomsticks, and he sighs gratefully, releasing the warming charms on his coat.
Draco stares at her. Confusion and hurt and anger swirl in his stomach, pulling him a hundred different directions.
A heavy weight settles in Draco’s chest, a grim resolve settling over him. He received a similar note the day he transferred to the Janus-Thickey Ward, wishing him well and telling him to await another message. He sits, letting out a shaky breath. He supposes that
“Harry! Ferret-face!” Fred greets, throwing his arms wide. George rolls his eyes, and Draco scowls when Harry laughs at the name.
Soto’s office door is closed, so Draco turns to take a seat on the sofa across the room, and—even though he knows she’s there—startles at the sight of Rue. She’s pressed into the corner of the sofa, knees drawn up to her chest, looking incredibly small as she stares at Draco. Her eyes are glassy and far away, and Draco tenses as he sits with as much distance between them as possible.
The curtains are pushed open abruptly, Potter not even bothering to knock. Draco rolls his eyes. Of course he wouldn’t.
Gilderoy shuffles past Agnes’s curtains, Basil tagging along behind him with their hands still entwined. Basil pauses momentarily just outside the curtains to fix Draco with one last suspicious glance, before Gilderoy tugs him along.
“Possibly, depending on the spell and kind of trauma to your core,” she says gently. Draco understands what she’s not saying: the chances of regaining his memories are slim.
“I’m perfectly serious. But I can’t give it to you until I know what you’re doing to do with it,” she says. Draco licks his lips.
At last, Potter bids him goodbye, and Draco tears open Narcissa’s letter as he tries to push that interaction out of his mind. He's not sure why he's so flustered, or even stranger, why he's in a
is the one he asked for help. He doesn’t know who Pansy, Vincent, or Blaise are, or if they were friends after Hogwarts, or where they are now.
“Thank you,” he says quietly. “I just don’t know if I want to remember a lot of the things I did and the things that happened to me.”
Draco hums and moves like he’s going to pull away, and Potter’s grip tightens slightly. Draco laughs knowingly. “You’d have to let go of my hand in order to not be doing this, you know.”
“Finally found something for Draco?” Neville asks curiously as Harry sits down with a sigh and sets his bag from Scrivenshaft on the floor. Neville peers into the bag, frowning at its contents. “
Once, he would have lied to himself about what his feelings mean. But after so much time spent watching and hoping and
He changes into something a little less comfortable, something Hermione picked out for him years ago and doesn’t quite fit anymore, and goes to meet Neville and Draco by the Great Hall as they do every year.
Harry accompanies Neville to Greenhouse Two after breakfast to put small scarves on the mandrakes. He’s not particularly looking forward to it, but Neville always makes pleasant company.
He doesn’t usually attend the twins’ New Year’s parties just because of how many people usually go, but Blaise and Neville managed to drag him along this year. It helps that Draco also agreed, though if he’s honest, Draco is the
He’s starving. He’s surprised that he didn’t wake up when Soto took the tray from the armchair—and he would’ve welcomed being woken up. He glances at the clock and sighs when he sees that it’s eleven in the morning. Did he really sleep that long?
He shrinks it and puts it into his pocket, continuing down the cobblestone street to Scrivenshaft’s to buy Percy’s present.
Draco stumbles, his legs suddenly too weak to be able to support himself completely, and Potter cries out in alarm. He slides his arms beneath Draco’s to prevent him from sinking to the floor—and for a single moment, they’re chest-to-chest, Draco’s leg between Potter’s, breathing into each other’s necks.
Draco gives a nod—feeling like he’s been doing a lot of nodding today—and Bryn clears their throat as they shift a bit on the stool to get more comfortable.
Agnes doesn’t usually bark when the trainees are in the ward. He takes advantage of whatever’s causing her to now to dart out of Soto’s office and into the bathroom across the hall. It’s small but clean, with a shower, bathtub, toilet, and sink. The walls are pale blue and, like everywhere else, it smells sterile.
In the faculty room, the large table and chairs have been turned into sofas and coffee tables, pushed to the sides of the room. A large fire is going, snow falls from the ceiling, a Christmas tree in the corner to put the presents under. Enchanted, wooden mice chase each other through the air.
Because Potter will remain in the ward overnight, for whatever reason, Draco opts to keep the letter to himself until after he's met with the memory specialist. He has time, and doesn't really want to seek Potter out so soon after the awkward way he left earlier.
Spells and hexes are cast left and right, and Draco flinches as a few pass through him, but he can’t tear his eyes from the sight of Memory-Draco. His face is tear-streaked and terrified, and despite it, is fighting his own people with Potter at his side.
He’s greeted by ivory and pale blue walls. The sterile scent hits him like a wall, mingling with something like sausage and eggs. This is St. Mungo’s, he knows. He’s very familiar with it. He pauses, unease settling into his chest—he shouldn’t
Bryn sits on the stool by the counter, gesturing for him to sit on the uncomfortable-looking examination bed. He complies, discovering that the bed isn’t as bad as he thought it would be, and smooths over his robes as he anticipates what they’re about to say.
For now, he supposes that if he gets good enough at the alphabet, then he could at least spell out a hello to Agnes.
“Sign language?” she asks, and Agnes nods enthusiastically. Draco makes a mental note to ask Narcissa about that later.
The scene dissolves into grey before he’s ready, the sight of himself standing alongside Potter turning to nothingness, and reforms quickly in the familiar colors of cream and light blue. He’s still reeling, heart pounding—he fought with
. His privileges certainly will be stripped—he’ll probably have monitoring charms on him now, too. A long, grating lecture from Soto, for sure. He can hear her voice now, explaining all the reasons he’s stupid with an edge of concern to her words.
As they near the kitchen, the yelling and playful shouts get quieter, replaced by soft, calm voices and the smell of a Christmas lunch.
The walk to the loo isn’t long enough. He’s avoided entering it since he sicked in the toilet, nervous that the memory will make him nauseous again, but nothing is different when he walks in. Still the same sterile scent, every surface gleaming, and Draco feels... fine. Absolutely fine.
articles. He thinks about the peacocks at the World Cup, Diggory and Moaning Myrtle, the sour relationship with his father, the obvious feelings he had for Potter, ferrets and mermaids and dragons—everything.
They round the corner, and Harry softens when he sees Hermione reading in the armchair by the fire, Ron and Bill cooking — and to his surprise, Molly, talking with Narcissa Malfoy by the window. He didn’t know she was already here.
He chats with her for a little while, falling easily into a mix of playful banter, conversation about the ward, and gossiping about other patients (especially Saul Croaker, who spends his days yelling at Agnes to shut it. He used to be an Unspeakable, but now his legs sometimes spontaneously disappear and make working impossible—though they always come back.)
“Nothing too much. Just going to visit my mother. What about you?” he responds. His voice is tight, and Harry wonders if his mother is alright, but he doesn’t push Draco on it.
The Three Broomsticks hasn’t changed much since Harry was a student. It’s still smoky, frequented by the same patrons — Harry, Neville, and Draco now part of that group, he thinks with a smile — and Madam Rosmerta is still running the place. She smiles at him from behind the counter, and they nod to each other by way of greeting.
...A calming spell. Merlin. Draco could gape at Potter if he wasn’t aware of how stupid he’d look doing it.
The first drawer is full of patient files. They can’t all possibly be of the current patients in the ward, considering there’s only five, but the majority of the files are thin. Draco assumes that the thicker ones are of Soto’s patients—himself and Agnes—and she likely doesn’t have access to anyone else’s complete files.
“Explain why you’re smoking?” Draco says, an accusing note in his voice, and Harry relaxes marginally — so Draco
“Right, well to start, how have you been feeling since your admittance? Physically, mentally, emotionally... Whatever you are willing to share is whatever I am willing to hear,” Bryn says, and Draco feels himself relax. Bryn is nothing but professional, but not in a cold way that Draco would expect from them.
He puts on his slippers, noting that they’re dirty and he’ll have to ask Soto for a cleaning charm later, but his plans are rudely interrupted by a loud argument starting at the end of the ward. A door slams, and Draco immediately freezes his movement towards the curtain as he listens to two voices steadily rise.
“Trying to convey to you how I feel about this. Is it working?” Draco asks. Potter breathes a laugh.
He glances at the clock hanging above the door, and his throat tightens when he realizes he’s been in here for
Unable to resist, Harry hesitantly tucks a loose strand of hair behind Draco’s ear, hand lingering. In his sleep, he turns his cheek into Harry’s palm.
joke,” he replies, but the small chuckle that slips past him takes away the bite in his words. “I’ll have you know that I’m perfectly capable of remembering things.”
Harry’s mouth goes dry. Draco doesn’t usually dress this nicely for the faculty party. In fact, it’s been a very long time since Draco has worn anything that’s not black.
He runs over the words he wrote, processing them, trying to line up the events in the journal with the little information he’s learned from old
“What’re you doing?” he snaps. Potter looks up from the newspaper to meet Draco’s gaze, raising his eyebrows.
They walk slowly back to Harry’s quarters, talking about nothing at all, voices soft and echoey in the empty halls. Soft sunlight streams through the windows, glinting in Draco’s hair and making it look white. Harry loses his train of thought mid-speech when he notices how bright Draco’s eyes look in this lighting.
“Thank you,” he says and means it. “I tried to read the one about my Azkaban sentence, but Agnes’s ear-splitting barking distracted me.”
“The next batch of Weasley children are at Hogwarts, of course we went through the Skele-Gro,” Neville says with a snort, making Harry and Draco laugh.
“You’re joking,” he whispers, eyes flicking over to the partially-open curtains nervously before he shuts them, even though he knows it won’t do much.
“You know Cassandra?” he asks, not inclined to say anything about the potion, before he realizes Potter said Cassandra’s job
“You go shower, and I’ll find you something to wear. You’ll pick something atrocious otherwise,” Draco says, and Harry almost wants to argue, but he knows Draco is right. Hermione makes a comment every year about how Harry still can’t be trusted to dress himself.
Potter waves his wand in a swooping pattern, muttering under his breath. Draco expects the sensation of the diagnostic charm to be uncomfortable, because it’s
“N—Mother, this Agnes. Agnes, this is my mother,” he says. Narcissa smiles gently at Agnes, and it occurs to Draco that they’re likely near the same age.
“Sorry, I didn’t think. If it bothers you, I’ll stop using my wand so much,” he says, stumbling over the words. And despite how awkwardly it was delivered, Draco’s heart flips at the (albeit poor) apology, and the thought that Potter would be willing to stop just because it might bother him.
Just then, Rosmerta — with her always-excellent timing — slides up to the table. She’s carrying Harry’s usual brew, wearing a smirk, and Harry eyes her nervously.
“In where?” Draco asks, adopting his best ‘I have memory loss’ expression. He grasps at memories of Gilderoy and his open, trusting demeanor. He tries to relax the grip he has on his robe's sleeve, and judging by the way Potter’s eyes flick to his hand, it was obvious.
tomorrow — Draco might even, too, because they showed up together. How likely is it that someone got a picture of him holding onto Harry’s elbow?
Floo travel goes as it always does for him — poorly — and he steps out of the grate to a very hectic scene.
He puts his chin in his right hand, tapping the fingers of his left on the armchair as he thinks. Agnes shrugs.
Before they can even reach the stairs, people begin to take notice of Harry, falling silent around him — though the whispers grow with every second. And then the jostling and
“What’ve you got for me today?” he mutters. Isabelle purs and rubs against his legs in answer. She must be especially proud of what she’s brought him today. She started doing it years ago, once she finally warmed up to Harry, and since then, there’s hardly been a day that she hasn’t stolen one of Draco’s possessions to give to him.
The curtains are pushed aside and—lo and behold—Potter steps through, his expression like something sour is in his mouth. The circles under his eyes are less prominent, and his hair is a little more under control, but otherwise, he looks exactly as he did yesterday morning.
He passes Rue on his way back to his cubicle, as he usually does. And she gives him the faintest of smiles, as
He puts his notes beneath his pillow—it’s too dangerous to have them out in the open, now—and peeks into the ward again. He’s just in time to see Wagner disappear into his office, the door shutting with a click behind him.
want to cooperate with me, so I just decided to let it do whatever it wanted (and I ended up stepping away from it for a bit for my sanity.) It starts off angsty, but I promise I won't leave y'all on a sad note. <3
It’s the first time he’s admitted it to himself so plainly, and he wonders if he should feel something dramatic after doing so — shocked, maybe, or nervous. But apart from the warmth blossoming in his chest and the continued ever-present longing for Draco, he doesn’t feel any differently.
He slides between the bed sheets, which are still as stiff as ever. Despite that, his eyes immediately fall closed of their own accord, and he drifts into sleep.
He lurches, as if to sit up in bed, but when he opens his eyes, he finds himself exactly as he was in the dream: standing in the hall outside the Janus Thickey Ward. A handful of vials drop from his loose fist and shatter on the floor.
“Are you okay?” Potter asks, hands still outstretched slightly, as though afraid Draco might stumble again.
Seeing the little tea shop inspires a few less-than-fond memories of his fifth year, but it was ages ago, and he’s since made better memories of the place with Draco.
And, on top of it, it’s difficult to reconcile the Potter he knows—the healer, and the war hero—with this younger self.
The sound of Draco’s laughter makes his heart flip. He doesn’t know what makes him say it, but the words tumble from his mouth before he can stop them.
Draco is seated on the other side of Neville. Harry’s eyes wander to him the entire time they eat, and to Isabelle, sleeping in his lap. Draco’s long, pale fingers curl under her chin.
Back in his office, alone with the snow on the windowsill and papers to grade, Harry twirls his wand idly, leaning back in his chair. He levitates the snow globe on his desk — turns it upside down, right side up, over and over — and thinks.
Somehow, though, it’s almost strange how easy it is to do this. To hold each other, and so readily admit their feelings. It must be because they were both waiting for so long, but it’s almost as if they were always meant to be this way — in love and warm and content.
Why would he send Narcissa a list of potion ingredients? He wanted her to give the list back to him eventually—but why? There’s something he should know about those ingredients, and for whatever reason, he didn’t find it necessary to include in the letter.
He stands on shaky legs, stumbling over to the sink. He swishes a bit of water around his mouth before spitting it out and washing his face. Feeling a little more steady, he walks back to his bed, trying not to move his head around too much.
Lips quirked in reluctant amusement, he thinks that maybe he should’ve accepted Rosmerta’s mistletoe — and that Draco might have, if given the chance.
a choice. If he regained his memories, he would no longer be able to catch the potion stealer from inside St. Mungo’s, or worse: his attacker would likely come back to finish the job if he found out.
Draco listens as Lockhart talks to Agnes beyond his curtains, the words lost on him, but he lets out a grateful sigh when she finally stops barking. Gilderoy isn’t all that bad, at least.
But in the quiet, with nothing between them except the air, Harry loves Draco for the sound of his breathing. Steady, soft. For the way his fingers inch towards Harry’s, but never touch. For the way he might be listening to Harry breathe, too.
“I got lost on the way here,” he jokes. Agnes breathes a laugh, but something about it doesn’t quite feel the same as usual, and the smile drops from his face.
Sweat beads on Draco’s forehead and above his lip, his face flushed rather unpleasantly, and Harry swallows past the lump in his throat, willing himself to focus on the task at hand.
consider a quill a few days ago. He immediately discarded the idea, of course, but it crossed his mind.
He distracts himself by opening his present. It is indeed a quill — the feather reminding him of Hedwig, and he smiles a bit — and based on Neville’s embarrassed grin, it’s obvious that Neville was his gifter the entire time.
“I’m trying.” Draco says. He hears Potter’s sigh, and it sets him off laughing again, trying to stifle the sound with his free hand—until Potter is laughing too, and between the two of them, they could wake the entire ward.
Unsure of what to do, but feeling as if he has to acknowledge her somehow, he gives her a small wave. Unexpectedly, her lips twitch into a slight smile, and she briefly taps her index finger against her lips.
That’s the biggest thing that irks Draco—how casually Potter uses wandless magic around him, knowing that he can’t perform any spells himself. Frustration curls in his stomach.
“Malfoy. What is that?” Potter’s tone is a warning, the hostility from earlier in his voice, but Draco downs the potion anyway. It’s intensely peppery, burning his throat and tongue as it goes down and he coughs, but the nausea disappears immediately. He sags a bit in relief.
Harry stumbles out of bed, almost tripping in his eagerness to peer from his bedroom to see if Draco is still there. He doesn’t expect him to be, really, but he’s hopeful. It’s not even sunrise yet — so the entire place is dark — but when Harry pokes his head through his door, he can see Draco’s dark form curled on the sofa.
Draco leans against the doorframe, eyes trained on Harry as he marks papers. For a few minutes, Harry doesn’t acknowledge him, and Draco remains silent. Harry’s skin burns under the weight of his heavy stare. He sets aside his quill and looks up.
Potter sets a quick pace, and Draco follows closely, a bit startled when they walk past Potter’s office and into the hall.
. Without opening his eyes, he runs his fingers over the raised scars that cross over the crook of his neck, down to just below his navel. He doesn’t know how he got them, or how old they are, and can only assume it’s from the Aurors or the war. The first time he saw them, he couldn’t tear his eyes away—and much the same with his Dark Mark, which still mars his skin even though it’s faded.
“I’ll be there the entire time. And remember, we can’t be hurt, seen, or heard. We’re only spectating. However, if you need to for any reason, we can leave the pensieve,” Bryn continues.
They make small talk as they go. Neville talks animatedly about Blaise and the new flavours of gin he’s been whipping up for the New Year’s party. Draco makes a comment here or there about it, and for now, Harry is content to just listen and watch his friends’ mouths quirk into smiles.
Around noon, Draco realizes he’s somehow spoken to Agnes for three hours and that Gilderoy will likely be waking up for lunch soon, so he should probably retreat to his own bed. He stands, promising he’ll talk to Agnes later and that yes, he really
, a Draco who knew what a veela is and what a mermaid looks like, with a million experiences that made him who he was and a thousand hours to process them.
Movement in the corner of his eye catches his attention, and he turns his gaze over to Agnes’s bed, where she’s peeking out of her own curtains and gesturing for him to go back inside.
The second thing he notices is that Potter’s eyes gleam when he sees them, and something about it makes his heart contract, but the specialist gives him a kind smile and Draco tries to shove his envy away.
“Each of those lines represent different parts of your memory. The blue is what we want to focus on—it shows the growth in memories you’ve retained. Where it dropped back down is where your memories were taken. Make sense?” Bryn explains. Draco nods, the knot in his chest tightening further with their words, and they continue:
Isaballe wanders off shortly after, leaving Harry to shower and dress slowly, thinking about how nice it would be to just stay under the hot spray of the shower forever. But he’s going to Hogsmeade today, and Harry promises himself that he’s
His steps falter, and the hand reaching for the door knob falls to his side. His throat tightens, and his eyes burn.
Draco turns to Soto’s desk, feeling guilty, knowing how many personal boundaries he’s crossing with her to be doing this. He tells himself that if Soto knew what was happening, she’d probably
He flips to a new page on his notepad, reaches for his quill, and starts writing a letter to Narcissa. He tries not to focus on how formal or informal he sounds, and very nearly writes “Narcissa” instead of “mother” at the beginning of the letter, but it’s not a disaster.
It’s early morning, the sun not even up, when a new patient is admitted to the Janus-Thickey Ward. The only reason Draco knows there’s a new patient is because they're screaming bloody murder—which is concerning, but not surprising. On a normal day, Draco would be annoyed if he isn’t so curious about it.
“Do you have no sense of privacy?” he snaps, shaking his head in irritation as he bends over and picks the papers up.
Draco’s throat tightens, suddenly confronted by the thought that he could be here forever, like Agnes, until he wouldn’t be able to remember how long he’s looked at these walls. He wants to say he’s sorry or ask how she’s stayed sane all this time, but he won’t.
He sets his robes on the sink, carefully avoiding his reflection in the mirror, and turns the shower tap on. Most of the other patients don’t use the shower—they don’t have to, when the healers can perform cleaning charms which get the job done a lot quicker than bathing.
to say romantic things — this wouldn’t be a problem. He would just march right up to Draco and say everything on his mind, possibly be even bolder and pull Draco in for a kiss.
Sighing, he opens the bedside table drawer and slides the journal in. Out of sight, out of mind, after all. His hand lingers beside the table, pausing for a second before he grabs the sign language books. Now is as good a time as any to learn how to communicate with Agnes this way—even if it’s just saying something small.
Draco raises his eyebrows—Agnes can leave the ward if she wants to. He wonders if she knows that. It seemed, at least to him, that no one could leave the ward.
Draco moves on instinct while he does this, aware of everything he does now because of something that Healer Soto observed the day before:
He eventually tries summoning his glasses, but gets no results from that either, and he slumps with disappointment as he tries to think of where he could possibly have left them.
“Look—I’m sure you overheard, but Soto isn’t the head healer here anymore, which means she’s no longer
“Can I talk to you?” he asks. Draco can imagine him rubbing the back of his neck with that painfully awkward expression on his face, and he’s not sure whether he’s glad that he can’t see anything beyond Potter’s silhouette.
Agnes canonically doesn't have a last name. She was hospitalized sometime before Christmas of 1995, and it's presumed that she either failed an attempt to turn into a dog animagus, or mistakenly drank a polyjuice potion with dog fur in it. More likely, the former. Her son is mentioned to be visiting her when Harry passes through the Janus Thickey Ward in 1995 - so I looked around and found Arnold Peasegood, born sometime around 1976, who worked as an Obliviator until 1999. His first and only appearance was in 1994 during the Quidditch World Cup. His connection to memories, as well as his age and nickname (Arnie, similar to Aggie), is why I decided to give Agnes the surname Peasegood.
The complicated mix of feelings he’s had about his name dissipate upon hearing it spoken by Potter—like he never needed to worry about whether he’s Draco
Agnes looks concerned for all of a second before she scribbles a response, hand shaking now. From anger or worry, he doesn’t know.
There’s no response—which, of course, there isn’t. Draco strains to pick up the sound of the healer’s footsteps, getting louder as she nears Soto’s office, and his mouth goes dry before the steps soften again. He’ll have to leave eventually, but how can he do it without the trainee seeing him and before Parson arrives?
“Well, all right,” she says hesitantly, and though doubt is evident in her voice, she doesn’t press him any more than that.
It’s dangerous, surrounded by potential enemies, not knowing who's an ally, and not even having a wand. Draco doesn’t know why or how he’s going to do it, but he will.
“Yes. I think you should start calling me Draco,” he says softly, not quite sure where the words are coming from, picking at invisible lint on his clothes. There’s no use, really, when Potter can’t see him, but it’s for his own sake.
He rereads both parts of the letter, his confusion deepening. Realizing that it never mentions the case, or even St. Mungo’s, how did Narcissa know about it? It occurs to him that he could’ve told her a separate time, and it’s the only other explanation he has, so he accepts it.
“You’re very welcome.” Bryn returns his smile easily. The self-writing quill continues to write. “Is there anything else you want to share?”
He quickly goes through the files of other patients in the ward, checking the dates to see if any are recent. The only one transferred into the ward lately is Draco, though he doesn’t know about Rue. He makes a mental note to ask Agnes to see if she remembers when Rue was admitted.
“Good girl,” he murmurs, tying the letter to her foot, and resumes stroking her feathers. “Take this to mother for me, and stay there. Ask for treats. I don’t want you flying back in this.”
When the sun has gone down completely, he sits in bed and stares at his curtains, lost in thought. Tonight, oddly, none of the lights are turned on, so Draco sits in the darkness for a while and mourns—not for the first time—the loss of his memories.
But in all honesty, the comments only bother him because apparently, Gilderoy used to teach Draco. To think that he knew this man, spoke to him, learned from him, but not be able to remember any of it? It leaves a sick feeling in his stomach.
her bar, and a lot more time for Rosmerta to forgive him, but Harry knows that there’s a place in Rosmerta’s heart reserved just for Draco now. Five years of friendship will do that to anyone, and especially a friendship with
Draco’s reply is lost on Harry, because he’s too busy realising that Draco is wearing a grey Weasley sweater, the
“Thank you,” he says. Soto’s eyes are soft when she pats his shoulder, lingering momentarily, before she leaves him to his lunch and sign language books.
Panic tightens around his lungs in a vice-like grip, but he somehow maintains his composure. He relaxes his grasp on the glass enough for his whitened knuckles to return to their original color.
He steps into the storeroom, pulling the door shut with a click behind him. About twice the size of his cubicle, it’s larger than he expected it to be. There are multiple floor-to-ceiling shelves, the space between them very narrow, racks on the shelves holding hundreds of potions—maybe even a thousand.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I can imagine how that must have felt. To know so little of the person you once were, and to only get to see something from a time in your life when you were likely just as confused as you are now,” Bryn says softly, and Draco finally meets their eye, folding his hands in his lap. He doesn’t reply.
?” he jokes, nudging his friend’s arm, and Neville laughs bashfully. Harry adds softly, “Thank you, Nev.”
about what’s going on in other people’s lives, Potter. At least I don’t use random spells on people and lie about it.”
Draco’s scowl deepens. “I’d like to see you try. See what happens to your precious photographs then,
A few moments later, corners of his lips tightening, Potter slips the vial into his pocket. Draco’s fingers twitch. He automatically wants to take it back, barely refraining from opening his mouth to demand it.
“Healer Soto told me to give you this potion. It’s for your nausea,” she says quietly, holding out the vial for him to take. The potion is thick and deep green in color, and Draco takes it from her. Exhaustion makes his movements slow. He really just wants to go back to sleep.
“You’re my healer, aren’t you? You volunteered your memories. You didn’t have to,” he points out. He thinks to himself that he’s only arguing because it’s Potter, but he knows he’s lying to himself.
Draco goes straight for the small sink and kettle in the corner, and it’s a few moments before Harry remembers to close the door. He sits in the armchair by the fire, back to Draco, listening to him rummage around the cupboards, and the kettle whistle, and metal clink against glass.
“Merlin, you’re old,” he says instead. Agnes huffs a laugh in that way that’s quickly becoming endearing, and Draco’s unease lifts.
He thinks of Draco, and the mahogany cabinet in his office, filled with tins and jars of tea leaves. How the four shelves are completely full, organised alphabetically, the labels written in Draco’s neat script. Harry will never understand what Draco intends to do with so much tea, but Draco delights in having it — as does Neville, who goes to Draco’s office almost as much as Harry does — so Harry will always just accept a cup of whatever they’re drinking.
Draco doesn’t even understand the kinds of magic described in the journal—magic that a 14-year-old is supposed to be able to know.
Harry feels a pair of eyes on him, and looks up to meet Draco’s eyes, holding the tin of tea leaves. His stare, intense and weighted, leaves Harry breathless, and the grin falls off his face. He swallows past the lump in his throat.
In a moment of courage, foreign but not unwelcome, Draco reaches forward and seeks Potter’s hand out in the darkness. He finds it, and his heart pounds, and he turns it over so he can put his fingers between Potter’s.
There’s a rustling of blankets and the pad of her footsteps as she walks to her curtains and pulls them aside for him. Her fur sticks up wildly, whiskers drooping a bit, but her eyes are bright. Draco probably doesn’t look any more presentable—loathe as he would be to admit that out loud, though.
That evening, long after Draco has left him alone, Harry retreats to the Astronomy Tower. He leans against the railing and shivers, watching the sun dip lower in the sky until it’s fallen past the trees. The world is quiet up here. Gentle.
Harry finally remembers he’s a wizard, reaching into his pocket and silently casting an airway clearing spell on himself, as Neville matches Rosmerta’s grin.
“Well, it was to you,” Potter shrugs, and Draco can’t really argue with Potter when he’s right, so he doesn’t say anything at all. “Let’s go, huh? They’re waiting.”
Draco waits until he no longer hears the clicking of her boots to close the curtain and grab the letter. He stares uncertainly at it for a moment, at Narcissa’s name in green ink, hardly recognizing the handwriting. His handwriting isn’t as loose or flowy like it used to be, and if he didn’t already know he’d written it, it would take some convincing to make him believe it.
But just then, the twins’ voices sounds over the speakers, the music on pause: “A brand-new, unreleased flavour of Weasley-Zabini gin has been added to the floor —”
After showering and dressing, he steps out of the bathroom to complete silence. He realises that Isabelle evidently won’t visit him with any of Draco’s belongings this morning. No clinking sounds, no soft pattering of her paws on the floor, and no purring.
“In this instance, the black dot is an indicator of what kind of spell was used on you. This memory charm is known as the ‘Repealed Obliviate,’ and it’s usually completely reversible.”
The underlying sterile scent of the hospital sharpens until it’s all he can smell. It burrows into his head, his pulse throbbing in his temple, and his legs start to shake with the effort of standing.
The snake continues to hiss and writhe. The burning intensifies until Draco’s vision starts to blur from his tears. He clutches his wrist, willing it to stop,
The rest of the students’ eyes are red-rimmed, expressions grim and tear-streaked and hopeless. Draco doesn’t see himself among them.
It’s been a while since Harry’s been to the store. It seems to grow every time he sees it, and he’s proud of the twins for getting so far.
Harry opens his mouth to reply, not sure what he’s going to say, but Neville interrupts. “Rosmerta was entertaining the idea of putting mistletoe above the booth. Harry was against the idea of kissing you.”
She mutters spells under her breath that mean nothing to him, and he wills himself to relax against his pillows and the eternally stiff blankets. He feels waves of warm, heavy magic pass over him as Soto completes her diagnostic charms, listening intently to her soft murmurs and the scratching of her self-writing quill.
Draco pauses. Emotionally—well, there’s a lot to unpack there, and the past few days of isolating himself have only worsened it. He’s not really keen on talking about it, but if he doesn’t say anything now, will he ever? He can’t imagine saying any of it to Agnes, Narcissa, or—Merlin forbid—Potter.
healer, either. I’m taking over both of those positions,” he says. Draco’s eyebrows shoot up, and Potter winces.
“Happy Christmas. Merlin. It feels like it’s been years, mate,” Ron says, chin grazing the top of Harry’s head as he speaks, and Harry steps away to avoid the sensation.
At some point, it becomes them watching each other, pretending to watch the fire and allowing each other to stare without saying anything — and they are content in it. Harry isn’t sure how much time he spends glancing between Draco’s crossed feet and his face, but he eventually looks up to find the fire dying and his cup drained.
His heart thrums with anticipation as he grips the doorknob—with no reaction from the magic. He turns it slowly—still nothing—and the door swings open. It creaks slightly, but other than that, there’s no sound, lights, or any sort of barrier deterring him from entering.
“Did you know that you can just walk out of the ward?” he finally says. It’s difficult to tell, but Draco gets the impression that Agnes is raising her eyebrows.
“That I’d never hurt you,” Draco mutters. Harry swallows past the lump in his throat. His heart races.
“In his shed. ‘Last-minute Christmas presents’, he said,” Ron says, nodding his head in Narcissa and Draco’s direction. Harry hums in understanding.
Blaise winces and drops the cigarette reluctantly, stomping it out in the snow. “I hate you sometimes, you know that?”
Snow begins to fall, the snowflakes, gentle things that melt when they meet Harry’s skin. Harry smiles — Neville grumbles.
He hums in thought, absently fiddling with a loose thread on his robes, and wonders whether Draco’s collection could use some more Earl Grey.
“It’s standard procedure,” Potter says unnecessarily, like Draco is putting up a fight, and he resists the urge to roll his eyes.
Bryn grins. “Glad to hear it. It’s quite a show to see it in use, and I think you’ll like it. If you will, lay back on the table, and we can begin.”
Draco tries to scoop everything back into the bin as quickly as possible, the contents mostly candy wrappers and broken quills, but a crumpled up piece of parchment grabs his attention.
Something dawns on him, slowly, a realisation that's been coming on for years, and — maybe, he’s never understood what all those looks have meant, until now. He may not be the best at romance or feelings, but neither is Draco, and something tells him that maybe he’s not the only one who’s been yearning all this time.
They point to a graph near the bottom of the page with their wand. The graph is labelled with strange symbols, numbers, and filled by multi-colored lines—red, blue, and yellow, like the lights from the spell. Bryn taps their wand to the page, and the lines start to move.
Shortly after breakfast that morning, he double and triple checks that he’s signing “hello” correctly before he’ll visit Agnes. It would be embarrassing to do it wrong—even if Agnes would probably appreciate the effort—and he’d rather avoid his horrible blush that always shows just how embarrassed he gets.
Draco furrows his eyebrows. How could this help the case? He doesn’t know what any of these items do, or why they are important. He almost thinks that it could’ve been something Narcissa accidentally brought with her—it seems almost like a shopping list—but he doesn’t think she would make a mistake like that, and this is the only actual information in the letter.
But questions burn within him—threaten to consume him—and this journal could answer them better than anything else. He has no idea what he was like, or who he was, or how much he’s changed by losing his memories.
Potter takes a step forward, eyebrows furrowed as he reaches for Draco, but falters. His hand falls back to his side, and he opens his mouth to say something, but Draco can’t quite make out the words through the ringing.
all around them, startling Draco and sending his heart thundering. Some of them are carrying or supporting the injured, soot-covered people from whatever disaster has occurred.
He wants his memories back—but at the same time, he doesn’t. He doesn’t want to remember everything, just to be relieved when he realizes how much he really needed his memories all along. He doesn’t want to know about Azkaban or living with Voldemort or horror stories from the Aurors. He doesn’t know if he can be a person without those experiences, but he’s terrified of reliving them. What if he can’t even get his memories back?
,” he says, feeling petulant. “Soto sometimes makes it seem like I can’t even walk on my own, much less
“The results of the test are going to take a few minutes to present on the page. I have a pretty good idea of what’s going on with your memories, but I’d like to have it confirmed first. Until then, I have a few questions to ask you, if you feel you can answer them.”
“Different?” he asks. Something about the way she phrased it doesn’t sit well with him, and his chest tightens with concern.
“Healer Potter. He was kind enough to extract a few memories for our viewing today.” Draco’s excitement dims, and he tenses at the thought of viewing a memory of
His reflection holds him in place for a moment—shockingly white-blond hair, flushed skin, wide grey eyes—and he tears his gaze away, clutching his robes to his chest. Heat rises on his neck, in his eyes.
usually does. Things are seeming to fall back into routine, and with no nausea, run-ins with Potter, or things to do about the potions thief for now, he settles into his armchair with the sign language book.
“Merlin’s balls, Harry, he’s dressing you now? And you haven’t even kissed?” Ron says, wiping tears from his eyes with the back of his hand, and Harry punches his arm.
And despite the way his chest tightens at the thought of potentially uncovering more about his past, he supposes he’ll have to start asking questions eventually.
Moments later, a storefront emerges from the fog, a cobblestone road forming their feet, the world bursting with color. Draco gapes. Again, all he can think is
He leaves his empty tray on his bedside table once he's finished eating, sliding his feet into his slippers and making his way to her cubicle. He mentally goes over how to sign hello, and though he's done it so much that he can do it perfectly, there's a nagging thought that he
There’s one week until Christmas. Christmas, the faculty party, and the dreaded gift exchange. Harry has yet to get his giftee anything. He simply has no idea where to start.
The weight and feeling of the package gives him the impression that it carries books. Maybe—he thinks—sign language books. So it’s no surprise that when he unties the ribbon and takes the note, it’s addressed to him and signed by Narcissa.
He drops the vial into Potter’s hand, hoping that none of his thoughts show on his face, but Potter isn’t even looking at him. His focus is on the vial, sniffing it and swirling it around, watching how the remaining potion clings to the sides of the glass.
Once he steps out of the shower, he dries himself off, ruffles his hair with a towel. He carefully hangs the towel on one of the hooks on the wall, turns to grab his robes from the sink, and his eyes are pulled to the movement in the mirror.
In his quarters, he takes a long, cold shower and busies himself with cleaning to get his mind off of Draco.
“You find him before midnight, though, and I’m sure you won’t be anymore,” she adds. Harry’s skin heats.
Just then, the wards go off. A high, pleasant chiming. There’s someone at the front door, asking for permission to enter, and relief washes over Draco.
Thankfully, Potter largely avoids Draco, save for daily check-ins and lunch-bringing, and Draco is torn between relief and annoyance. On one hand, they aren’t exactly on good terms with each other, and he doesn’t particularly
If you would like to avoid the (somewhat) graphic vomiting scene in this chapter, skip about six to eight paragraphs once Draco enters the bathroom. It's essential to know that it happens, but this doesn't spoil anything. :)
But he shakes the urge off, instead following the hall the rest of the way down. It forks at the end; the right leads to a lone door, and the left continues down a bit to a set of open double doors.
“Go talk to Agnes. She’s very sweet if you look past the fur,” Soto advises, not unkindly, making her leave once Draco concedes to go talk to Agnes.
“Add three sugars,” Narcissa says immediately. Agnes laughs again, and he’s sure that she’s thinking something sarcastic.
Bryn laughs easily and takes a small velvet pouch out of their pocket. From it, they pull a vial full of a swirling, luminescent silver substance.
He thinks about Potter's expressions, the tension in his posture, the way his eyes seem to burn any time Draco opens his mouth… No, definitely not cordial, he thinks, but maybe they
Neville clears his throat, and Harry realises he’s been staring. He tears his eyes away and thanks Merlin that no one can tell when he’s blushing, because he can feel Draco’s eyes on him.
His muscles tense up, wanting to reach for his bedside table on instinct, but he sucks in a slow breath instead, as he feels warm, friendly magic pass over him.
For whatever reason, he woke up two weeks ago unable to recall his own name. Still, he was able to remember that someone in St. Mungo’s has been stealing and selling potions meant for patients—and can be fatal when administered incorrectly. He has a feeling that no one is going to stop them if it isn’t Draco.
Draco resists the urge to scowl. For whatever reason, it seems Basil has taken a dislike to Draco. It’s no problem for Draco, but it is a tad irritating.
It’s all very strange, but Draco tries to push aside any awkwardness that he might find because of it. She looks up when Draco nears her bed, brown eyes brightening and whiskers twitching in recognition, her mouth curving into an almost-smile. It’s difficult to tell for sure, but Draco gives her a small smile in response.
So it’s permanent brain damage, then. Caused by some unknown exposure to negative magic, that could’ve happened at any point in his life, and he has no idea when. Whether it’s from the war, or Azkaban, or the Aurors—he’ll never know.
The corridor stretches far on either side of the entrance. The walls are ivory-colored above waist-height, pale blue below, and there are a few doors lining the opposite wall. It’s much different than inside the ward, and the unfamiliarity makes Draco uneasy.
In other news, my laptop bit the dust, so hurray for that (about a quarter of this was written on my phone, so I apologize if any weird errors came from that). I think it's safe to say that updates from now on will come every
It’s then that Draco finds Potter—in the arms of an impossibly large, hairy man—arms hanging limp. Draco lips tighten, and he can't look at Potter, either.
Agnes is barking about something again from her bed across the ward, making it difficult for Draco to focus on the Prophet with the headache creeping up on him. It’s an old issue from 1999, his own face plastered across the front page, the headline reading: “DRACO MALFOY SENTENCED TO TIME IN AZKABAN!” He pulls the paper closer, observing the haggard look of his younger self as he’s roughly pushed through a crowd of screaming people.
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” Hermione says, not moving from the armchair or looking up from her book, but there’s a smile on her face.
Maybe he should have asked for any book on potions. Narcissa surely could have provided one if he'd only asked differently.
“Yeah. The twins pulled him away,” Harry says with a slight frown, taking a sip of his — whisky? Scotch? He doesn’t drink enough to know the difference, and neither are really his cup of tea, anyway.
Despite the slight disappointment he feels at losing so much daylight, the bright side is that he doesn’t have to wait that long until he can eat lunch.
“That wasn’t an anti-nausea potion,” Potter says. Draco simply stares at him for a few seconds, at a loss. Potter is
Harry rolls out of bed, Isabelle drags a string into his room, and he dresses in his usual black robes — the morning so far is predictable.
There’s a slight draft beneath the door, and Harry builds a fire — both he and Draco get cold easily — and he eases into the armchair with his tea. Draco, surprisingly, sits on the sofa, putting them closer together.
His thoughts wander between Potter, herbaria, drawings, and scars—and once lights go out at ten that night, his heavy eyelids and the comfortable silence are the only reason he’s able to escape the thoughts. His exhaustion is a welcome relief.
It reminds him distinctly of Molly’s cooking, and he wonders if she could have helped make it — or maybe Ron, who’s taken baking up recently. He’ll have to ask him tomorrow. There’s no doubt that he’s with his kids tonight.
“Right,” the boy says, and Draco’s stomach flips when his lip curls and he spits, “And I’ll join you when Hell freezes over.”
As he passes by Gilderoy’s partially-closed curtains, he can’t help but peek in and roll his eyes when he sees that the man has gone back to sleep. His breakfast tray is empty, precariously placed atop a stack of books written by or about Gilderoy.
It would be easy to keep reading through newspaper after newspaper, trying to trigger memories and regain his old life.
Draco is about to answer, before the tip of Bryn's wand lights and blinks, and their attention is turned to the clipboard.
The rest of the day passes predictably. Agnes keeps quiet, Gilderoy audibly chatting away to her. An unfamiliar deep voice chimes in every once in a while, and Draco assumes it’s the new patient. It’s probably rude of him not to introduce himself, but he feels less and less like socializing as the day goes on.
“What kind of tea is it?” Draco asks curiously, sniffing it and frowning as he tries to discern whether he’ll like the taste based on how it smells. Agnes pulls out her self-inking quill, but Narcissa answers first.
Bryn is sweating slightly, breath coming heavy, and the room is silent for a few minutes except for the sound of their breathing. Finally, they push their hair out of their face with a sigh, turning a small smile upon him. Draco can only imagine the kind of exertion it would take to use that spell, and he wonders how often they perform it.
Shortly after, Neville goes to find Fred and George before the party gets even louder and more full, leaving Harry with Blaise.
He rubs his eyes and sits up, squinting against the sunlight pouring in through the window and eyeing the trainee healer standing above him. Cassandra, he thinks her name is. She’s holding a potion, anxiously fiddling with it and looking at him worriedly.
Potter smells very much like the hospital—the lingering scent of illness over him—but beneath it is something musky and
Everyone’s curtains are closed, and Gileroy’s snoring is just audible over the rain. The rest of the ward is silent, even the newcomer, and Draco wonders if everyone else feels a heaviness in their chests too.
Draco clears his throat and sits on the other side of Neville, loading his plate with the food nearest to him — things that Harry has
Groggily, Draco swings his legs over his bed and edges forward to reach for the curtains, pulling them back and peeking through. It’s difficult to see around Rue’s cubicle, but one of the healers—maybe Healer Wagner—steps back into view long enough for Draco to see him pull out his wand and cast a spell that puts the patient to sleep.
Best-case scenario, she’s fully supportive and is willing to help him—but he’s not sure if the worst-case scenario would be losing her companionship, or if she were to rat him out. Both thoughts leave him wary, but the latter more so.
“He beat you!” someone shouts, voice breaking, and the strange muffled quality over the courtyard shatters. The sound of the girl’s choked sobs reach Draco, then, and the sound makes his throat tighten.
Sinistra and Hooch, who got married last year shortly after Blaise and Neville, and have a lot to say about Ginny joining the Holyhead Harpies. He never suspected that Sinistra is a huge Quidditch fan, but he meets her enthusiastically when she starts talking about how Ginny’s form only gets better every year.
They’re... pleasant, he supposes—excepting the peppermint one—but he quickly tires of the flavors and doesn’t finish any of them. He can’t help but marvel over how Soto just carries that many around.
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes is bursting with life, even more so than usual. All three floors of the shop have been rearranged to allow the maximum amount of people and games in. The shelves and products are no longer in sight — Merlin knows where they went — and all that remains are a few tables here and there filled with alcohol and food.
He collects the mugs before he makes his way towards the front of the ward. The sun is warm on his back as he walks past the other beds, the bathroom, and then Healer Wagner’s office near the entrance of the ward. He avoids the old, circular rug on the floor with his nose wrinkled in distaste—it smells of dust and sickness.
A parcel arrives for Draco later that morning, given to him by Soto along with a tray of food. The package is wrapped in heavy, matte green paper, tied with a black ribbon, a note tucked neatly beneath the bow. Draco runs his hands over the paper, the slightly rough texture almost nostalgic, in a way.
They enter Draco’s potions lab a few moments later. Harry purses his lips at the smell. Skele-Gro is
Harry shares a relieved look with Draco as the people disperse, either to rush to the alcohol or taking the hint. Harry silently thanks the twins. He really thought people would be over him by now.
However, Agnes is still eating her breakfast, taking special care to cut her food in small pieces that must be easier for her to chew. Draco didn’t think he would be startled to see her, already knowing what she looks like, but his steps momentarily falter when he takes in her appearance. Her face and arms are covered in black fur, and though she otherwise looks like a normal human, she can’t speak in anything other than barks.
“Thank you,” he says, leaning closer to the bed to get a better look at the tray. To his disappointment, it’s only a simple sandwich and chips. They’re probably not even salted, because they never are—and they didn’t provide any on the side this time, either. Draco deflates, shoulders slumping.
He glances at the clock again. Parson will be here any minute now. He wipes sweaty palms on his robes, trying not to think about what would happen if Parson discovered him in Soto’s office. It doesn’t take twenty minutes to put mugs on a desk.
He draws his legs beneath him, cradling his steaming mug and sinking into the cushions, and Harry worries at his lower lip at the action. He looks so small, curled up that way, and Harry’s chest tightens with affection.
Draco furrows his brow, lips pursed. Well, the lack of an answer about herbaria is disappointing. He'll have to figure it out some other way.
“I don’t quite know what I want. But I’ll give it some thought and discuss it with Narcissa today,” he concedes, offering Soto a smile for her honest yet kind words.
“Are you in the greenhouse today, Nev? I could join you if you need a hand,” Harry asks a few minutes later as the students begin to clear the table.
“If you’d like and are comfortable to, we can continue the meeting as planned. It may not spark any memories like we thought, but it can still be useful,” they say, an encouraging note in their voice.
The screams go hoarse, no longer even words, before they’re gone completely. The potions from the broken vials mix and spread across the floor, until he’s standing in a small puddle, the acrid smell of it reaching his nose.
He waves a dismissive hand. “I’ll tell you later, but not right now. The point is, you’re a medium-risk patient. You can leave the ward, but your monitoring charms are still up. But with how long you’ve been here, have you ever
“I have… no idea,” Harry replies slowly. Neville shakes his head and turns to his own breakfast, his lips quirked.
Draco struggles to keep his irritation at bay. He liked Potter more in the papers: awkward in a strangely charming way, with his heart on his sleeve and endearingly blunt—which Draco realizes must be because everything he says in the papers is
“Answer me honestly, Draco. Is your mission, or the possibility of regaining your memories more important to you?” she asks, a grim set to her shoulders.
There’s a tense moment of silence between them. Potter’s eyes are hard when he looks back at Draco, seeming to say a lot of things that Draco doesn’t understand.
“You’re quiet,” he says. Draco raises an eyebrow, and Harry recognises the look as Draco trying to figure out how to say something. He waits, and takes a small drink of his tea as he does.
It seems to work, because Potter stares at him, wide-eyed, as though he doesn’t believe Draco is actually here.
Draco flushes a little, hoping it’s not noticeable, but based on the small, more genuine smile that Narcissa gives, it probably is.
In the warmth of his blankets, the soft pattering of rain, and the dull light of early morning, he’s easily lulled to sleep.
“Do you happen to have any books on sign language?” he asks, knowing that’s not what Narcissa was thinking of when she offered her help, but curious enough to ask anyways. She just an eyebrow, looking amused.
His curtains rustle, drawing him from his thoughts as Healer Soto steps in with a tray of food. She eyes the stacks of newspapers on his bedside table with pursed lips, but doesn’t mention anything about the mess as she places the tray on Draco’s bed.
Draco tilts his head in confusion. He figures that Ron and George must be related to Rose in some way, maybe caught in the fire.
Realizing they’ve been staring at each other for entirely too long, he says the first thing that comes to mind: “Hi, Narcissa.”
Before he can say anything, the curtains are being pushed aside—making Draco jump—but it’s just Agnes shuffling into the cubicle. She’s carrying a tray with two mismatched mugs, strings of tea bags hanging over the sides, eyes alight with excitement. She glances between Draco and Narcissa, something like a grin spreading across her face, and sets the tray down on Draco’s bedside table.
Whatever the case, it won’t hurt to ask Narcissa if she knows the significance of the potion ingredients. Maybe he could ask to borrow a potions book, as well, and pass it off with Soto as trying to spark a few memories.
When they arrive at his quarters, Draco sets about making tea with such familiarity that it’s like he lives there. Harry doesn’t keep tea leaves like Draco — and certainly not as much of a variety — but Draco begins to make two cups of black tea without commenting on it.
This place isn’t meant to be lived in alone. Every corner of it invites company — for a shared bottle of whisky by the fire, or reading an excerpt from the morning paper out loud at the table, or filling the shelves above the desk with framed photos and potions supplies and books and Sneakoscopes.
He rereads it multiple times, trying to decide whether or not it’s good enough to send, or if things are vague enough for only Narcissa to understand in case someone else reads it, and eventually decides that it’ll do.
And then, there’s the casual mention of whoever Gawain is. It seems like they used to be friends or at least friendly with each other, and Narcissa has to know who he is too.
His loneliness ebbs and flows in his chest, needing something to do with his hands to distract himself from it. Not wanting to go to breakfast like this, he begins to clean his quarters by hand — the way Draco sometimes does when he has something on his mind.
Potter lets out a drawn-out sigh, glancing around the cubicle for a brief moment before he sits in the armchair, elbows on knees. He produces two vials from his pocket.
Rue is still staring at him by the time Soto’s door opens, and Draco stands quickly, almost splashing the rest of Narcissa’s tea all over the floor. She doesn’t even look at him as she starts towards the ward’s entrance, and anxiety tightens Draco’s chest before he shakes it off.
“It’s a good idea to discuss evaluation and assessment options with her. We have a lot of avenues you can explore at St. Mungo’s so you can understand the extent of the damage done to you, and possibly even figure out the spell used,” Soto says, affecting a focused air now that the clipboard is gone.
An unfamiliar mix of feelings swirls in Draco’s chest, and for once while thinking about Potter, he smiles.
, Potter could at least tell him what happened when they were at Hogwarts together. He’ll want to help, and all Draco has to do is ask... Right?
“Well, let me clear up what it won’t do first. No spell can tell me who took your memories—it’s nearly impossible to decipher that. However, it
So not only are they working with someone else, but with someone who previously didn’t have access to the storerooms. Only one of them is in a position to be trusted with the potions, which narrows down the suspects, but the other one could be
“Oh, don’t look so down,” Soto laughs. “Luckily for you, I happen to have some sweets on me that I might be inclined to share.”
He winces when Narcissa blanches, eyeing him with barely-concealed hurt. Draco’s stomach clenches painfully, but of
He scowls as he walks back to his bed, thinking over what Agnes said. He has no idea what he did to make her say something like that, and trying to remember what he said right before she got upset gets him nowhere.
Voldemort’s expression turns venomous, and suddenly the hat upon the boy’s head is on fire. He drops to the ground with a shout, the other students screaming his name, before he pulls a
“Well, unfortunately for the both of us, I couldn’t let the potion go without investigating it,” he finally says. “So now you’re stuck with me, and I’m stuck with you.”
He hopes that the slight twist in his heart can’t be heard in his voice, and thankfully, Potter doesn’t seem to notice. Instead, he licks his lips and turns his head away, seeming like he’s thinking about how to answer the question.
“You have a letter,” Potter says, producing a folded piece of parchment from his pocket, holding it out to Draco so the wax seal is visible. A perfect circle, unbroken, and obviously from Narcissa.
Downing the rest of his water, he reaches for the letter Narcissa gave him and for his notepad, the latter carefully hidden beneath the stack of newspapers.
Potter, who saved the entire wizarding world, and is now saving more lives as a Healer. Potter, who knew him when they were kids and saved his life. Surely, that has to mean
With a sigh, he folds the letter up and tucks it under the stack of newspapers. On the top of the stack is the next issue of the
Neville laughs, but he goes a little pale and takes an eager sip of his drink. The Ravenclaw head of house takes Secret Santa very seriously. They learned that the hard way, their first year as professors, and Harry doesn’t think his left ear has been the same since.
“It also has information about your mission,” she says, voice dropping in volume. He sucks in a sharp breath, eyes widening.
, and he lets out a small sigh. So he went the right way, then. But now that he’s here, he has no idea how he’s going to get inside if the wards only accept the head healers.
“I think that’s a great idea,” he says, nodding enthusiastically. Harry glares between coughs. “You have a brilliant mind, Rosmerta. Mind if I take a couple sprigs back to the castle? For completely academic purposes.”
, it says. Draco feels a twinge of guilt, but knows that Agnes is more than likely saying it playfully, rather than actually meaning it.
His robe pockets are nice and full, he notes. He wonders what he’s carrying. Maybe his other pair of shoes. But he doesn’t really feel like looking to see.
He thinks of Draco, and his potions lab. He remembers all the times Draco has brewed Pepperup potions while Harry has watched. It’s a thing for them now, an agreement, when the students start making their annual trips to the Hospital Wing.
“I’m afraid that there’s little-to-no hope of regaining anything. The problem lies with the condition your brain is in. It’s very likely that you’ve undergone prolonged exposure to ill-intending magic. It’s caused permanent damage that will make it nearly impossible to reverse the charm. I’m truly sorry, Draco,” Bryn says, voice solemn.
Not only that, but Draco has no way of knowing if the new restrictions on the wards will affect them at all. Not unless he can somehow monitor the potions stock records.
much cheese — and Harry thinks of Firenze as he eats. He’d appreciate the selection the twins have provided.
Harry laughs. He really does admire how she lives life the way she wants to. She seems to take it to the fullest.
“Good morning to you too. And yes, I think she did too. Now I know how it feels,” Harry jokes, and Draco scoffs. Harry smirks — he knows the story Draco is going to bring up. He could never forget it.
big today — and takes a bite, while Neville takes five points from a Gryffindor student for less than appropriate handlings of their sausage.
He’s re-cleaned and re-organized his entire cubicle before Soto pokes through Draco’s curtains to see what’s going on.
“A separate examination room. It’s more private,” he explains, and Draco hums. He’s grateful for any semblance of privacy, even if it’s with a stranger.
“How are you feeling?” she asks, her voice gentle as she tucks her wand inside her sleeve, and the clipboard disappears into thin air.
Draco stops beside Harry, looking questioningly at Blaise, nose pink. He crosses his arms and frowns. Harry swallows nervously.
Bryn glances at the clock on the wall and purses their lips, but doesn’t comment on the time. Draco figures that they must be running behind.
point out that Potter is the head of the department now, and he could easily make someone else Draco’s healer, but… he doesn’t want to. Something about Potter’s expression warns against it, and Draco’s own curiosity about Potter makes him bite his tongue.
Narcissa’s eyes shine with something that’s probably pride, and Draco feels like he’s done something right with her.
Harry’s stomach does strange things at Draco winking at him, and he pinches the bridge of his nose just to have an excuse to close his eyes.
“I don’t know what you were doing out here, and frankly, I don’t even want to deal with it,” Potter starts, sounding exhausted and completely, utterly sincere. “I’ve had enough of you to last a lifetime. Good luck with your memories, Malfoy.”
“What? We were supposed to be at the Burrow an hour ago!” Harry says, turning on his heels and throwing open his closet to find something decent to wear. He starts rummaging around, before Draco’s hand on his wrist stops him, and he swallows thickly.
He puts the clipboard back on the hook, cracking the door open slightly and peering out into the hall to make sure no one is nearby.
“It’s important that you know what I can and can’t do for you,” they start. Their tone is even and professional, and Draco finds it reassuring. “The spell I’m going to use is called the Memory History charm
minutes. The knot in his chest constricts tightly, making him feel like he’s unable to breathe. He takes a deep breath, then another, and puts the notice back in the trash bin. He walks over to the door, pressing his ear against it and hoping that he won’t hear anything coming from the ward. He’s not so lucky.
“Looking for the pointy blond one?” someone asks in his ear, and Harry jumps, turning to see George leaning against the railing and smirking.
The short witch working with memory-Draco gives Potter a smile and tells him she’ll be with him in a minute.
has three weeks spent inside four off-white walls, an introduction to his own mother, an unsolved case, and exactly one conversation with Potter.
Harry mutters his praises, half-wondering if he’s dreaming, and Draco silences him with a searing kiss.
hasn’t forgotten his name. He has half a mind to duck back out of the store and sleep through the New Year, but that would leave Draco alone, and
His heart skips a beat. He finally sees himself. Memory-Draco breaks from the Death Eaters, the first to notice Potter. He runs to Potter’s side and throws him a wand, shouts his name, and then the world descends to chaos.
“Ginevra,” Draco says, sitting on the step beside Harry, their shoulders touching. “She was intent on informing me of what would happen if I ever hurt you.”
could ever be awkward,” he jokes, lifting his nose haughtily, and Agnes breathes a laugh. He almost thinks he hears Narcissa laughing too, and feels the tension fade from his muscles.
Regardless, he wills himself to relax. He doubts Potter would hurt him—here, at least, and as his healer. Even Potter couldn’t get away with that.
this and not get caught. He has around ten minutes until the trainee healers will enter the ward and poke through everyone’s curtains to make sure no one is dying—and then Healer Parson will arrive and make her rounds around the ward.
“Of course! That’s lovely, Draco. I’m happy to see you keeping up a correspondence with her,” she says kindly, seeming genuine, and Draco warms.
“Why did you keep that to yourself this entire time, then?” he asks indignantly. “You made it seem like some gigantic secret.”
He turns his attention to his breakfast when Neville starts commenting about how big the sausages are today, which he would almost think was supposed to be a joke, if it hadn’t come from
He slips out of his cubicle to the side of Rue’s, peering around her curtains to watch Potter and Soto at the front of the ward. Soto has her back to him, hands on her hips, and Potter is directly across from her. He’s nearly a head taller than she is, and Draco ducks back around the curtains when it occurs to him that Potter could probably see him.
warm. It spreads from the center of his chest, to his fingertips, to his toes. It makes him feel safe, in a way.
“How do you find the ward?” he asks, knowing that nothing is interesting about four walls and a single window, but trying to come up with something to say that’s not “
Well into the evening, after taking dinner in his room and changing into his pajamas, Draco knocks on his door. Because of course he does. Harry stares at him when he answers the door, afraid that he might actually be gaping. Draco is still wearing his robes, lips pink.
When did Molly knit that for him? Why did she? Does Narcissa have one too? The questions fly around Harry’s head, but they go completely out the window when Draco turns to him and smiles.
Draco has a bout of graphically described nausea in this chapter. For spoiler's sake, I can't give exactly where, but it comes up pretty obviously and doesn't last too long!
she writes with a wink. Draco lets out a short, startled laugh, almost slapping a hand over his mouth when he realizes he’s laughing about his own lack of memories. How morbid.
Harry waits just inside the store for Draco, Neville, and Blaise to show up, wanting to avoid the snow beginning to fall outside. Neville and Blaise appear first, holding hands, and Harry tries not to feel jealous of how openly affectionate they are.
He dresses with unhurried movements. Isabelle, a ragdoll cat that isn’t his, watches him with narrowed, keen eyes.
As Draco watches, the blue and red begin to grow exponentially from the start, the yellow hovering near the bottom, until suddenly, the blue drops down to zero and the yellow shoots up. The red drops drastically, but not entirely. Draco’s chest tightens as a black, spiky dot appears where the blue line peaked.
But Potter doesn’t reply, and the question hangs between them, heavy and painful. He looks Draco up and down—at Draco’s hair, which probably doesn’t look combed, to his dirtied slippers, to the wrinkles he didn’t manage to smooth out on his robes.
“You kids are always so rude, but no worries, I don’t hold it against you. You’ll learn better when you’re older,” he says with a sure nod and patronizing smile. Draco’s hand twitches in irritation, but the lingering guilt stops him from saying that
His feet start to move without him asking them to. That’s funny. He looks down at them, noting that his slippers are dirty. Was he wearing slippers?
“What’re you doing?” Potter asks, voice shaking ever-so-slightly. He doesn’t pull his hand away. Draco absentmindedly rubs his thumb over Potter’s, wondering how they got so calloused.
“Can I sit here?” he asks, placing a hesitant hand on the back of the bedside chair. She nods enthusiastically, gesturing for him to sit. As he does, she offers up the crust of her toast at the end of a fork.
So, as he always does, he watches Draco. It would be simple to say that he fell for Draco because of his looks — the curve of his neck as he turns his gaze towards the sky, the snowflakes on his eyelashes, or his too-pointy chin and nose.
Harry smiles, even as he suspects that he’s going to end the night with a terrible headache. There’s no place like the Burrow.
Surprisingly, there aren’t many people today. They must be staying indoors, considering that it’s colder than a witch’s tit right now, and he finds that he prefers the usual loud and boisterous bar over this. But at least he can spot Neville more easily than usual, sitting in a booth in the corner and cradling a steaming beverage, a few bags by his feet.
There’s a reply too soft to make out. The voice, deep and strangely familiar, makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up. It can’t possibly be who he thinks it is...
He steps away from the desk with a heavy sigh, accidentally kicking the trash bin as he does, wincing at the loud clang it makes when it tips over. He hopes no one heard that.
“Malfoy,” someone says behind him, and he spins around. Standing behind him is a man in lime green robes, round glasses and deep shadows under green eyes, wearing a sneer. “You’re Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
Draco swallows roughly. He knew, of course, that he couldn’t have walked away unscathed, but to hear it said as
Draco spins around, heart in his throat. There, standing right behind him, is Harry Potter—all lime green robes, dark undereye circles and a scowl—and despite his expression, Draco’s heart thumps.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Draco asks, blushing, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. He rubs the back of his neck bashfully.
“Good morning,” she says, once she realizes he’s awake, seeming distracted by whatever the self-writing quill is scratching on the clipboard. Her eyes are tired and a little far away, but her smile-lines are deep, and he feels like he can trust her. She reminds him of… someone he can’t place, but he relaxes at the sight of her.
“I don’t think I’ve properly introduced myself. I’m Draco. I transferred here a week ago. You’re Agnes, right?” he asks, not expecting much more than a nod in response. Instead, Agnes pulls a notepad and quill towards her from her table. She scribbles something down quickly before flipping it around for him to see.
He's still frowning slightly by the time he's done writing his reply. It's quite short, simply thanking her and expressing that it would be lovely to see her tomorrow, adding that he would like to see some of his old artwork if possible.
“How long have you been here?” Draco asks curiously. She shoots him an amused glance before she picks up the quill.
Draco watches in fascination as thin threads of pulsing light emerge from the tip of the wand, red and yellow and blue. They dance around the examination room, darting around each other like animals might play, steadily tangling themselves with each other until they’re a single, knotted line. He understands fully now why they’re in a room separate from the ward.
“I know, I know,” he mumbles, laying down before she has to ask. He knows the drill by now. Soto offers a small smile, rolling up the sleeves of her robes, and lifts her wand.
Potter falls silent, and it stretches between them. Draco continues to rub absent circles on the back of Potter’s hand.
Potter stops just outside of the ward, turning to stare thoughtfully at him, eyes intense and piercing. Draco’s heart thumps under the gaze, and he has to look away.
He feels the weight of Draco’s heavy stare back on him, and with his heart pounding, meets Draco’s eyes. Watches Draco’s gaze flit down to his lips.
He goes to pour himself more whisky, and spots a familiar blonde vigorously mixing herself a drink. He raises his eyebrows.
“I’m not entirely sure,” he finally settles on. She lets out a little huff that could mean anything, writing on the notepad again.
“Brilliant. Er, I’ll see you tomorrow, then,” Potter says, and he turns to leave, his robes swishing a bit. Draco hesitates before he clears his throat, wanting to voice something that he still doesn’t understand.
. He swallows against the lump in his throat, lips pulled into a frown. He’s still not sure he wants his memories, even if there’s a chance he can have them, but how could he say no to that?
Draco shuts the journal with a snap, dropping it onto his bedside table and pushing away his disgust of the last few sentences he read. It’s no wonder that Potter didn’t want to see him again. He tries to put the sketches out of his mind, along with what they meant. They’re not
...and then the embarrassment hits him, harder and faster than the nausea, and wins out over the strange comfort he feels in Potter’s arms.
And Potter, unsurprisingly, is far more than lacking in the warmth that Soto brought. Instead, he brings clipped words, weighted statements, and confusing signals that Draco has trouble deciphering. On the surface, there’s the obvious irritation and distrust, and Draco doesn't want to consider what lies beneath that.
“Oh yes, just put them on my desk, love,” she says quickly, waving her wand towards her office. Her hand is shaking violently, making the door swing open faster than necessary, and Draco frowns. He doesn’t ask about it, though, just letting out a relieved breath that Soto didn’t hesitate to allow him inside her office.
knitted in green. And, oh Merlin, does Draco look good in it, with his hair in a braided bun and the same pink lipstick on from Christmas Eve.
Harry’s hands wind in Draco’s hair as he tastes him — bitter like amaro and bergamot. Harry hums into the kiss, a moment passing before the corners of Draco’s lips twitch. He starts laughing — and Harry can’t help but join him.
Harry likes Blaise. He’s funny, he cares about Neville, and he’s generally nice when he’s not conspiring. But being left alone with him makes Harry nervous, because he’s
“I can’t say I would feel any differently in your shoes. And, because this is something a lot of my patients have struggled with, it doesn’t make you any less
Despite the pleasant warmth of the fire, the blurriness of the room and lack of a certain affectionate cat make him feel lonely all over again.
Draco glances at Bryn nervously, anxiety tightening his chest with the disappearance of the ground, and Bryn gives him another comforting smile.
Agnes shoots him a concerned look, and he smiles weakly at her in response, but doesn’t stop or say anything. He only wants to lay down and take a nap.
He focuses on the memory. In the shop window are a variety of robes, ranging from elaborate, elegantly-designed formal robes to casual everyday wear. The wooden sign hung above the door reads “Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions.” People bustle about; the noise and colors and voices overwhelming.
He stands and collects their cups as quietly as possible — Draco’s has pink lipstick rings on it, and Harry inexplicably wants to keep them — and builds the fire again. He throws a blanket over Draco’s shoulders, one Molly knitted, knowing Draco would hate it.
Memory-Draco’s expression doesn’t soften, and neither does his voice, but Potter almost seems to take comfort in it.
“Draco, darling, pleasantries have never looked good on you,” Narcissa laughs, clear and genuine, and Draco feels an involuntary twitch of his lips when he hears it. His heart is doing flips, replaying her words. He’s
In the Great Hall, enchanted snow falls from the ceiling and disappears before it settles on the ground. A few students and professors are seated at the only remaining table — most of the professors take their meals in their quarters this time of year, apart from Minerva, Neville, and Draco.
“There are more people here than I was expecting from you two,” Draco says shortly. Fred and George share a look.
he should be grateful that he didn’t lose everything. But it doesn’t change that he hates feeling like he has to be happy for not losing
Harry finds a chair after that, and takes to people watching. Rosmerta appears every once in a while, giving him pointed glances. A few couples get a little too handsy — George usually handles them. Surprisingly, only a few people take any great, drunken risks. He wonders if it’s a bad thing that he’s disappointed.
The rain has picked up into a full-blown thunderstorm. It falls in sheets over the roof, the sound like waves. Occasionally, the thunder rolls in the distance, followed by forked bolts of lightning, and Draco absent-mindedly starts to count.
— Draco’s arms wind around Harry’s neck and he presses his lips fully against Harry’s, pulling him in so closely their bodies are pressed together. It’s warm and full and
He drinks a small glass of water, attempts to flatten his hair again, and slides his feet into his slippers before he leaves.
. What happened to you?” he mutters, probably more to himself than to Draco, so Draco doesn’t reply.
He eyes his journal with a frown, unfortunately still curious about the rest of it, but opts not to open it again. He’s seen enough. Too much, really.
“Draco, I hate to break it to you, but your hands are so sweaty that it would be impossible for me not to feel them.”
As Bryn had said might happen, a pleasant warmth starts in the base of his neck and up through his hair as the threads collide, making the rest of him feel cold. The strangest sensation of heat spreads behind his eyes, like he’s going to cry, but he doesn’t.
“What’s with the robes? You never wear anything like this,” Hermione says, peering over her book and eyeing him appreciatively. Harry clears his throat.
It’s rose gold in colour, which is fitting of the shop, and Harry thinks of Draco’s words as he looks at it. He traces the plaque that reads
“Draco, are you working in your lab today?” Neville asks, voice light. Harry leans in curiously for Draco’s response, momentarily taken from his offence at Neville’s scolding.
Harry winces — of course she heard — and goes to stand beside her, staring at the self-filling, hopefully unbreakable glass tumblers, at a loss. Where are the labels?
“No hello?” Draco asks as they start walking to the faculty room. Harry raises his eyebrows and finally looks at Draco, heart stuttering as he does.
He hums, turning away from Potter in a sort-of dismissal, reaching for his sign language books. “So we are.”
Not that Draco’s complaining, because this benefits him nicely, but part of him can’t help but note incompetencies.
Gritting his teeth, Draco turns to see Gilderoy Lockhart sitting up in bed and signing pictures of himself with a broad smile. The man is insufferable, constantly prattling about his own supposed accomplishments and giving Draco an autographed photo every day.
The curtains are pulled aside, Agnes' fluffy face and brown eyes coming into view, and she lets out a loud, happy bark upon seeing him.
It sounds achingly familiar and, hoping the information will come back to him soon, he sits up as the witch hands him a glass of water. The coolness of it soothes his dry throat as he gulps eagerly, his mind clearing a little, but the confusion remains. The witch chuckles easily when he grips the empty glass to his chest like a lifeline.
Gilderoy’s smile falters, a confused hurt twisting his features, making him look incredibly vulnerable for a moment. Draco feels a twinge of guilt, but Gilderoy’s smile is renewed soon enough as he gives a deep chuckle.
While the real Potter certainly is all of those things (with an added disregard for personal space and a penchant to assume he’s right), it’s not at all flattering. Really, the only pleasant thing Draco can think about him is that he’s attractive—and yeah, he smells nice and seems concerned about Draco’s wellbeing—but that’s irrelevant.
“You’re Harry Potter. I read about you in the papers. But no, I don’t remember meeting you at all,” he replies. He crosses his arms and flushes, but doesn’t look away. He feels vulnerable and open, but he refuses to
He’s interrupted by a sharp knock on his curtains. Draco sets the book aside and glances at the clock—lunch time—and knows it’s undoubtedly Potter on the other side of his curtains.
“Quite the show, innit?” they say with a lopsided grin. There’s a gleam in their eye, bright and joyous, and Draco understands how they’ve come to be the best in their field. Surely, their passion must have contributed to that.
And if Draco is honest, he feels more like himself than ever when he’s around Potter. The realization leaves his cheeks hot, and he’s thankful that it’s nearly impossible to see given how dark it is.
Quick, light footsteps approach his cubicle, drawing Draco out of his thoughts and making his heart jump. He knows those footsteps.
Draco opens his mouth. Closes it when he realizes he doesn’t know what to say. Instead, he nods, and Potter nods along with him, and it’s all so painfully awkward.
“Tch, now you’re resorting to name calling? What are we, twelve?” Draco asks, lip twitching. Potter scratches his nose, and stares off to the side, lips twitching.
Like he thought, the chips are cold and bland and disappointing, and the candies Soto left are… strange, to say the least. They’re a little oddly shaped, like Soto made them herself, which is kind of sweet if she actually did and was willing to share. But the weird thing is the flavors—one tastes extremely minty (and he promptly spits it out after his eyes start to water), another is something citrus-y that he can’t pinpoint, and one is like lavender and camomile.
The walk to the Great Hall feels different without glasses. It reminds Harry of when he was a student and his prescription was too weak. It’s a strange, unwelcome sense of deja vu, but he’s shaken from it when he sees a familiar — albeit fuzzy — blond by the open doors of the Great Hall.
As they weave through the steadily growing crowd of people, Draco grabs hold of Harry’s elbow to stay with him, and Harry’s skin heats at the contact. Draco’s fingers are warm, his grip light, but Harry is aware of it the entire time he’s holding onto his elbow.
Frustrated, he snaps the fitted bed sheet over his mattress with sharp movements, tucking pillows into pillowcases with unnecessary aggression.
Beyond the doors is what seems to be a cafeteria—the scent of sausage and bacon reaches him even from down the corridor—and Draco wonders if this is where the food for the ward comes from. There are dozens of people already milling about, trays of food in hand. Most of them are wearing lime green robes, slumping a bit in exhaustion, and Draco assumes they just got off their shifts, or are about to start them.
He doesn’t want to admit he’s sulking, but he most definitely is. With Draco dragged off by the twins to do who-knows-what, he’s left to his own devices. (Which really just means he’s taken shelter by the food, and trying to hide his face as more people get word that he’s there.)
There was never any hope of returning to that Draco, and though he doesn’t want to at all anymore, the loss still weighs on him.
was the one who chose to “take over” for Soto, after all, knowing full well the position it would put him in.
Blaise hums, glancing to see if Neville is gone before he pulls a cigarette from his coat and ducks outside, Harry following. “I’m doing great, thanks. How about you? I take it Draco still hasn’t shagged you, then?”
He supposes, though, that if Draco wasn’t Draco, then Harry wouldn’t be in the situation to begin with. He smiles at the thought, and leaves his half-cleaned-up quarters in favour of eating breakfast.
A slight breeze ruffles Harry’s hair, bitterly cold. He pulls his robes tighter, watching the trees sway below him.
Draco voices his agreement, and then Bryn walks with him back to the ward. They say goodbye and wish each other well—Draco going to his cubicle and Bryn to Potter’s office—and Draco finds himself watching the red glow of the sunset from the ward’s only window.
He rinses the shampoo from his hair and forces himself to think of nothing else for the rest of the shower, even when his fingertips accidentally catch over the jagged scars on his chest, and he scrubs his left forearm so hard it’s painful.
) is a clipboard. Draco’s pulse quickens as he skims over it. There’s a list full of names signing off on potions, and he assumes that the head healers have to record whatever they take from the room. He spots Healer Soto’s name near the top.
Feeling restless and unable to go back to sleep, he reads over the note from the day before. He raises his eyebrows, amused at how messy his handwriting was due to the angle he wrote at, but he’s more relieved than anything. He actually remembers writing that note down—he was oddly afraid that he wouldn’t by the time he woke up—but more importantly, he can remember the notice and everything he discussed with Narcissa yesterday morning.
“You won’t regret it,” George adds, throwing his arm over his twin’s. Draco grumbles more, and Harry sighs again, ignoring the flare of jealousy in his chest.
They walk briskly back to the castle. Isabelle greets them in the entryway, rubbing against their legs.
“Draco’s joining us. He should be here shortly,” Neville says, snapping Harry out of his reverie, and Rosmerta’s smirk grows. Harry shifts at the look and takes a long draw of his beer, staring at the table like he’s trying to memorise the pattern of the grain.
