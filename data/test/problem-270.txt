“What?” He asked. Draco smiled with the corner of his lips and shook his head. “Nothing. Shall we?” He made a small bow, pointing with his hands towards the wall of green. Harry rolled his eyes. “Aurors first?”
“Draco,” he said, feeling the anger rising almost every time he talked with the other man. “First of all shut up. Second of all: I saw what you saw in that bloody bowl and I’m not offended! I’m here because I want to ask you out for dinner, a date to be more specific, because I’m bi for Christ sake!”
Harry laughed at that, shaking his head, thinking about all the time Hermione just stared at him, her face slack and eyes judging each time he tried to lie to her, and something grabbed his heart and squeezed because what if he was never going to see her? And Ron? And Rose?
“Oh, for… Shut the hell up, Malfoy,” said Harry, painfully massaging his face thinking how much would it hurt if he gouged his own eyes out and if it was worth it. The alternative was to look at Draco Malfoy’s smug smile that made his blood boil and not in an angry way,
“We don’t have to make such elaborate plans, Draco, not with you on the board of the project!” Lockhart gives him a benevolent smile that makes Draco feel acidity at the back of his throat. “The meeting with people from other teams and the project Team Leader will be next week and I assure you that everything will clarify then,” Lockhart says, standing up and buttoning his jacket. “Meanwhile let’s get back to work, I didn’t want to keep you for so long, my apologies!”
Harry nodded, dumbfounded, staring at the empty clearing; the grass was green and lush, but in contrast to the one they were walking though, this one wasn’t so high as it barely went above his ankles and it looked soft more like a fur than a grass. The stream that cut through the middle of the clearing was a small one, the water flowing without obstruction. The pebbles were polished and flat inside of the stream, the water was clear and there were no signs of any other animals. Still, he stood, like the greek sculptures on his bookshelves that held the few tomes he had — most for Aurors training, but he enjoyed a pulp romance or fantasy book written by a witch or a wizard from time to time — and let Dracon lean in even closer, the grip of his hand tightening (the material of his shirt clung to his sweaty body and no, Harry did not want to think further, he wanted to be brain dead at this point), his other hand with a wand extended above Harry’s arm. He muttered a few spells, some of which Harry knew, most not, and after a brief silence Draco said, “All clear, we can go.”
A cold breeze flew through them and Harry’s mind wandered to the one time when Dudley, on purpose, closed all the doors and didn’t let him it; it was a December night, much colder than this and the Dursley were out having a dinner or trying to impress Vernon’s boss, he didn’t remember. But the coldness, how it seeped through his skin to his bones, how his little body of a eight year old trembled while trying, desperately, to open the door.
It wasn’t he who gasped, but it might. Harry peared at his right, just as the surface of Draco’s bowl shivered and transformed into an image… of a house.
“Yes; the problem is not the ghost in the house, which is weird in itself, how come the ghost doesn’t bother Perrywinkle,” Potter shook his head not understanding the old lady at all. “But she said that the main problems are the noises from here and that the thing scares not only her but her neighbours as well.”
The email is just an invitation for a meeting on Monday morning, but already it has all the points they will go through, the documentation that the previous transitions needed to fill and how it looked previously. Out of curiosity Draco looks at the other invited people and one name stands out from the rest, one name he only knows superficially, the only person he hasn’t met face to face yet: Harry Potter, IT consultant. Draco frowns, looking at the empty and gray icon, and thinks,
But Padma is leaving soon, even though she’s making a brave face she is making a tiny human in her body and that takes some energy, patience, concentration and carefulness away from daily things such as work. Even if she grumbles, Draco will try to persuade her to leave early: he is not a monster. And Padma deserves it. She deserves the peace, her family deserves to have this special time with her and the baby. There’s also Penelope, who so easily introduced the idea of looking for a new job that Draco has to admit, for a second there he was baffled. Maybe that’s the generational gap between millennials who don’t change jobs this often (or maybe, a small voice says inside his head, it's your parents talking about people who change their jobs constantly and who can’t find a place for themselves. These flimsy people with no appreciation for work, they all end up either on the streets or at the bottom of the ladder, begging for scraps) and gen z, who don’t treat companies as their families, but as a job, one they can quit anytime they want.
, but instead he focused on his Auror training and thus he didn’t see the crack that has become a ravine he couldn’t possibly jump over.
He knew that after the war the Malfoy’s had to shrink their assets substantially (as did many of the pureblood families that were helping Voldemort) but changing Malfoy Manor to
“So,” he said after the first bite, with caramel and chocolate still clinging to his teeth and bits of nuts trying, unsuccessfully, to choke him. “Do you think we will be able to start some fire with these?” He gestured with his chin to the nearby trees and ferns, all towering over them like muggle buildings in London, but the trees were natural and no man made and didn’t try to show their superiority over everything else: they just were it.
And this time Harry Potter was right. Maybe, truly, for the first time Hary did exactly was he said he would do; he gathered up a ton of dry leaves, also carefully pulled out some of the lower branches, muttering apologies to the trees, just in case, and in half an hour they had a small but very bright fire just as the sun was setting down.
With anxiety in check and his breathing back Harry hummed under his breath. “I can give you any distraction you need.”
It takes Draco’s brain a minute to catch on what he did, and when he send a text to his friends it simply reads:
The three of them, the whole Treasury Team, stand up at the same time and almost sit in the meeting room at the same time. It’s colder than in the open space and once again he wishes that he had taken his blazer.
Harry looked down at the pieces of red twine weaved with tree branches that had their bark peeled, the sap soaking in the twine making it more black than red. Every finger’s length, a run carved out of a white stone, no bigger than half of his hand, would be braided into the thing that was almost as long as Harry.
Then the creature turned towards Draco, a motion so swift Harry thought it was a dance move, paying attention with his whole body. They nodded, once, slowly, eyes focused on Draco, veiny and thin lips slightly parted. Their skin was the colour of rotten wood, ashen with spots of grey in different shades all over their body.
As he steps into the elevator he can see in the mirror a movement; a shaggy, bowed head coming closer, focused on the screen in the person's hand. It’s the colour of the jacket that catches Draco’s eyes — bright orange, the colour a slushie would have — and the reflection of the phone’s screen in the round glasses. Without thinking Draco’s hand hovers over the button that won’t let the door close and the moment the man passes the threshold he picks his floor and backs to the opposite wall to make space. The man is shorter than him but then it’s easy to be shorter than Draco’s six feet two. He lifts his head and smiles at Draco, saying a quiet, “Thank you,” as he pushes the fifth floor. So the green eyes and shaggy, curly hair work at the same company but one floor down, huh? Thinks Draco as the elevator starts its climb up, wheezing a little. The building where the Stantons has its accounting department was built a few years ago but until you walked into the elevator you couldn’t say that; it’s all the wheezing and cracking the elevator does that gives the building’s age away.
“Well,” Padma says, straightening and looking at the two of them. Draco balls his hands into fists, his fingernails biting into his skin while he tries his hardest to have a blank face. Years of training kick in and Draco can feel every muscle in his face locking in a neutral position, as if listening. “I just wanted you to know that I’m pregnant.” Padma adds, smiling even more than before. “I will be working as long as I can, I promise!” She adds after the initial congratulations from both of them.
“Wow, that’s…” Harry paused, not really knowing what to say. He knew that Draco was educated and that he traveled, but who in their right mind would go to Poland to study? “That’s amazing!”
He inhaled, sharply, his stomach growling, but the only thing he reached for was the golden goblet full of fresh water. As he drank he felt the water eased his anxieties; the knot in his stomach loosened and so did his hold of Draco’s hand for a second, but the other man grasped it tightly, as if he wanted Harry to remember that he too was still there. And how could he forget? He thought, licking his lips and watching Draco Malfoy from the rim of his cup, taking another few sips. In Hogwarts he was nearly obsessed with him and even though
Robart narrowed his brown eyes. After a heart beat, another, then the third, he faintly shook his head.
“So protection runes, against seen and unseen and…” Harry paused, looking over a more complicated rune and he stifled a whistle because his teachers at the Auror’s training would positively piss themselves if they ever saw a masterpiece like that. “Is that combination of runes for uncovering secrets, making invisible visible again and summoning all in one?” He straightened and backed away a step to be sure that he didn’t disturb anything; it looked as if Malfoy spent at least a couple of hours, if not days, drawing them, and the last thing Harry wanted to do was to smudge anything.
“But a whole bar or just a piece of it?” Asks Penelope as she puts her empty, plastic container in her bag and also sits.
It was cold on his tongue and mouth and there was something heavenly pleasant about it; it reminded him about those times at Privet Drive when he would wrap himself in a blanket and do his homework all night and when he emerged the air was cool yet, without the heat of the sun which was slowly coming up. He drank some more and risend his face with it, then hair, smiling at the cooling sensation.
“Rather good,” said Malfoy approaching him, careful as not to step on the flat stone he laid on the ground earlier, to create a path from one object to the other. The rune was dug the closest to the entrance of the mausoleum — it’s door opened wide, the black maw of nothing creeping the hell out of Harry — and the path Malfoy created would lead the being to the circle and trap it in it.
And if he didn’t see the world like that, if he didn’t understand the feeling of wanting somebody simply for how they looked, was everything alright with him?
Only when the door disappears after them do the stop and look around and wonder: what the hell did we just do???
do you want to go for a romantic dinner with him where after four hours of interesting and stimulating conversation you continue the stimulation in bed, naked?
It’s easy to throw everything away and pack, leaving the country for Spain or Portugal; Draco is familiar with the concepts of running from responsibilities thanks to his father. And thanks to that valuable lesson, or because of it, this year will be his fourth anniversary at Stanson.
Who grabbed whose hand first was a debated they wouldn’t clear, but Harry felt his fingers closing around Draco’s hand, warm and
The email is still there when he blinks. The two previous emails are also questions regarding the issues he previously had. Draco looks at them for a moment wondering if they’re a plea for help or if something is wrong with their IT department.
“Since you will be doing your Auror work,” he said the last words with the sort of disdain one pureblood would use to an house elf. “I will carefully look around and see if we aren’t in more trouble than we think,” he added, taking the wand out and making a few steps to the jungle behind them.
“Hello, guest,” they said to Draco, the voice deep and yet wistful at the same time. “Welcome to the land. What brings our esteemed guests here?”
When Malfoy took the Kit Kat and slowly opened it, Harry let out a long and silent breath and took the Snickers, tearing the plastic with his teeth.
With a single minded intent Harry stormed through the clearing, throwing his coat near the bank. He kneeled then, the soft ground seeping through the material on his knees. He leaned in, trying out the water with his fingers: it was pleasantly cool and without thinking he dipped his hands and made a bowl-like shape out of them to drink it.
“‘This stuff’, Potter, please.” Malfoy shook his head. “Apart from course work I also studied the fay. Don’t laugh,” he added quickly, mouth in a tight line, looking up expecting a rather different reaction from Harry because what he got was:
A sense of peace washed over him and he took a deep breath, exhaling through his mouth. He closed his eyes, listening to the gentle whispering of the trees and when he opened them he was lying on his back and staring into molten stars of two eyes glittering in the dying fire.
“Aurors,” Draco muttered under his breath, shaking his head in disapproval. “The doors are new. These are the fourth ones in a matter of weeks. Miss Perrywinkle had to replace each one of them because they were always destroyed from the inside.”
Draco grits his teeth and puts his phone screen up on the desk counting to ten backwards. Is it a good idea? Probably not. He loves his friends, he really doesn, but sometimes they are just a tad bit too much.
. Judging by the emails he received from Potter he’s either going to be working with somebody who is super competent or who’s chaos incarnate.
There was only one person whom he told the truth about himself. He was a nice bloke, tall and quite handsome and took good to the “I’m a wizard” thing. They just sort of fizzled out and he had to modify his memory in the end. He cried after that for three days straight.
Something squeezed Harry’s chest, a feeling that was dormant before inside his body and it took every ounce of restraint not to walk to Draco and outline his throat with his tongue.
When Harry thought about his next case he didn’t think that he would get a haunted house with a haunted garden and haunted cemetery, but.
“Oh, that I am. Also, I might be unemployed, out of my own violation, but I’ll tell you everything on Friday, yeah?”
Lamps are already lit by the time he makes the first steps onto the pavement and Draco sighs into his scarf, wondering when was the last time he saw the sun outside of work. Or when will be the next time he will see it. Sometimes he thinks about the long autumn and winter months as one period of time, where he feels and behaves like a zombie, living without a thought in his mind. He has nothing against a routine, in fact he likes it very much. But in those months from mid September to even late March everything seems to be a bit of a blur. He wakes up, takes a shower, makes himself breakfast and green tea, listens to a podcast or watches something on YouTube and then he’s off to work at seven-forty. After arriving at eight he will spend the next eight — but more like nine and a half — hours in the office, go back home, drink some tea and stare at the ceiling, his mind completely wiped out. It’s easy for the days to become one and the same, but he always knows the date: the job demands it. So he knows, with each passing hour, with each morning and late afternoon how much time has passed, how close Christmas and New Year is (one of the busiest times of the year for his team) and how much overtime he has. The monotony of such life would kill many people but Draco… if Draco is absolutely honest he knows the rhythm of it like the back of his hand, the face in the mirror that stares at him day after day. The familiarity of it doesn’t make him bored or unsatisfied with his life, it’s just the fact how quickly it passess and how much he puts into things that technically make him proud but ultimately lead to even more time he doesn’t spend on himself.
“No, no objections, I think. I would have, if the fairies themselves were giving us the water but if it’s local I think we can try.”
“It’s cold, it will help,” said Harry with a huge grin, as he took another sip of the water, watching the other man in the corner of his eyes.
“Alright,” said Harry, ignoring the feeling of heat creeping up to his neck, the way his pulse get faster as something uncoiled in his veins, eager.
“Ah,” said the creature and Harry slowly looked up and would shiver when it showed its teeth but his mind was still too absorbed in what he saw on the water’s surface and that in the corner of his eyes he caught Draco’s hands tightly wrapped around armrests, knuckles white and protruding so hard they might break the skin. “Such a simple thing, to want. Easily granted. Just
They run through the last steps and rushed through the entrance to the catacombs to find the light disappearing in a doorway poised behind the sarcophagus that Draco painted around with runes. Its surface shivered as if it was an ocean on an extremely hot day, and it sparkled with the same electricity like the eyes of the feary.
What do you want to know? Is it legal? Yes. Is it against a code of conduct at your workplace? If he doesn’t work in your department and isn’t your supervisor it’s probably ok.
“Oh, I left it…” he made a vague gesture with his hands, not really knowing if “feary world” would sound normal.
They sat on the creature’s — their Host, as they introduced themselves, to which Draco nodded and Harry mimicked the gesture — left, next to each other, hands still clasped. The moment they were seated the plates in front of them filled instantly with food; he could taste on the tip of his tongue that the slice of bread was fresh and with the salted butter it would taste
if you tell him beforehand that you want to keep things professional at work and he doesn’t do that then its on him and not you
Draco sent him a look that could be interpreted as “You say one word and I will kill you,” or, “Don’t you dare to laugh,” at the same time, with nothing in between. When he was done he gently placed another rune, this one big as his own hand, wrapped in a red cloth and covered it with a thin layer of dirt before he sent Harry on the other side of the garden to place the braid in as a perfect circle as he could muster.
“Draco,” he said, taking him under his arm and hoisting him up, leaning him against the sarcophagus. “Draco, don’t die on me, please.”
Dracon has to clasp his trembling hands into fists under the table. “What if we don’t hit the deadline?”
“Well, next time please just don’t…” He gestured widely at Draco, unable to say the words “surprise me from behind,” without knowing that his cheeks would likely go much redder and he didn’t want Draco to get any ideas. “Do that.”
Malfoy laid back, head on his coat, hair spilling like silver threads on the dark wool; Harry swallowed and took his eyes off the man, not wanting to test his control.
“How do you know all this stuff?” Asked Harry when Draco stopped in front of him, looking over the circle with a critical eye.
As he crossed the threshold a shiver ran through his back and Harry gritted his teeth holding the wand tighter. The steps were steep and slippery, his footsteps were echoing in the corridor making it seem as if there were more people walking down into the earth. Miss Perrywinkle told him that the curse breaker was already there, working diligently for about two weeks. “You see,” she said, picking up one of the four cats and putting it on her laps without missing a beat. “I think that all the noise and the fuss is because of the ghost in the cemetery. Five generations of Perrywinkles were buried there, in a bloody mausoleum, and I am sure that it’s one of their ghosts that is making everything go bonkers around here. I already hired the best curse worker there was, but the situation has gotten dire. Please, Mister Putter, please help,” and for the love of God, how could he say no?
; the hands of the clock were gold and he saw that its face was glittering with stars. “Eleven hours. And I still need to change into something more formal.”
He writes, hitting ‘send’ immediately after typing. The moment the message goes out he can see that it’s been viewed, as if Harry had the chat already opened, waiting, hoping…
Draco sits for a moment in complete silence, staring at his email box dubiously. There’s no one else in the open space and the lights are shining just in the row he’s sitting in. In front of him is the Accounts Receivable, who disappear as quickly as they can before the month end closing jumps at them like a murderer in a slasher movie; they know it’s coming, each and every month. It’s the few days in a month when the work is never ending and Draco isn’t the only one at work at — he looks at his watch and sighs — six in the afternoon. The additional load of work that the Accounts Receivable have to do is so the General Ledger has clean books and Accounts Payable can put in the system as many invoices as they can. Draco doesn’t think that there’s another department as interconnected as the Finance one, because if one thing goes down, the other team struggles visibly.
The moment his eyes meet Harry’s he wants to stand up and leave the room to have at least five minutes for himself. To cry or to scream, he doesn’t really know. But what he understands is this: the man that hit on him in a bar and… whose interest he somewhat reciprocated, on some level at least, is now sitting on the opposite side of the room listening intently.
Draco’s face twisted in disgust as he took another sip. “Utterly horrifying, Potter. No wonder you look like that when you drink things like
“Finish the one you have. I can’t promise anything, Potter. Just give us your best. And get out of my office. Dismissed!” He said, impatiently waving a hand and returned to writing as if Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, didn’t storm his office mere minutes ago.
These days he was okay with who he was. Not out, at least not to the wide world beyond the mausoleum, but to those who were closest to him. He tried to date muggles, but it became complicated sooner rather than later. He enjoyed having someone who was a muggle as his partner, at least for the first couple of months, as at that point he still could explain
He remembers the ticket he escalated two days ago, wondering if their IT department was even alive at this point. It shouldn’t take two weeks to fix one issue he had with  SharePoint, but here he was, unable to access crucial files even though he technically had access to the folder. And the longer it took to fix the problem the madder was his Team Leader and Draco didn’t want to explain, again, that IT was taking care of it.
Four years. Four bloody years, he thinks to himself walking past Halloween decorations that look like him after a long week at work, all dried out and spat out, left to his own devices to haunt the open space and his flat (and the bar he, Blaise and Pansy sometimes go to, when he’s invited). His friends have been telling him for months to quit this job and find something with more life and work balance but it’s easier said than done, especially for them since they still got the fortunes assigned to them at birth in case something happens. They don’t have fathers with gambling problems, mothers who still pretend the Malfoys are at the height of their social status like they were when she got married to Lucius.
“Like this!” Draco made a vague gesture with his free hands toward Harry as if as supposed to explain everything. “Shut up, you know what I mean!”
. Like teenagers in love for the first time, a couple that just got married still in their honeymoon faze. And the hammer that nailed Harry’s coffin was the fact that he didn’t remember the last that he was so damn
“Since I stepped on this bloody soil it feels like it.” Malfoy said unders his breath, but shrugged when he was done. “Sorry. I don’t like to be in England. It… brings unwanted attention.”
Draco clicks on his Team icon and writes ‘Harry Potter’ in the upper bar. There is a photoless profile of an IT Consultant, who is currently available for chat. He even clicks on the message bar, fingers hovering above the keyboard, but after a few seconds he click on somebody else with whom he chatted recently -- Padma, with the last message from her being two otters sleeping in each others furry paws -- and tries to forget about the lushy, curly hair or the green eyes.
He felt watched, sometimes. Not in a predatory way, not in a way that made his blood run cold as some people did — those who wanted to use his fame to push their goals and ideas — and not in a way that some women looked him over, from his feet to his unruly hair. No, it was — at least Harry perceived it this way — a sort of curiosity from Malfoy. He was watching him like a scientist watched a very rare species of animal; with care, from far away, not wanting to scare the animal away.
The eyes, huge, comets flying inside them over and over again, start born and dying, seemed to envelop him in their gaze and Harry had to grip his tight hard, blunt fingers digging through the material. He didn’t see Draco waking up but felt the shift next to him, the air moving around the other man, or moving with him, Harry wasn’t sure, because the person in front of him was having his undivided attention.
. He wants to know Potter -- no, in this case it’s Harry -- better, maybe just a little bit. How he wants to know why Harry started talking to him in the first place, what made those dimples appear on his face, how the hell it seemed he still has a soul working in one of the most soulless departments on the corporation ladder. He wants to know
“I am not asking for another Lord Voldemort,” he said to Robart just two weeks prior, after throwing a very thin folder with a case that had a lot of publicity and politics involved but not much Auror work. “Just… Give me something worthwhile! I am a good Auror, am I not?”
But then the creature bore its many, many teeth, literal rows of them, that looked as if somebody stuck in fish-bones haphazardly, not looking if they were sticking out straight or not. He almost flinched, but then the creature hissed and the ground started trembling underneath their feet. It moaned as if something forcefully splintered it and Harry first saw a crack around the circle which was coming closer by the second. Draco swore under his breath and nearly collided with Harry as the ground moved dangerously.
“Team, could you come here for a minute? I have something to tell you,” he says, with that fake smile and the whitest teeth Draco has ever seen and he knows,
Lockhart sits on the opposite side of their three and it looks a little bit comical; almost as if he wanted to sell them something. He has quite a ridiculous style, all bright colours that Draco would never wear, but because of them and his wide smile there is not one person who would forget him.
”. He blinked a couple of times, startled, his heart beating fast and not only because of the stress. He went forward and followed the voice to the end of the corridor, where he turned left to stop a few meters before a man kneeling in front of a stone sarcophagus.
He would have preferred Kit Kat but he let Draco choose first, so it was his fault that he wasn’t eating it now.
“I can practically feel you panicking, Potter,” Dracon next to him shifted a little bit closer and Harry could not smile at the bitting, but still friendly, tone of his voice.
“Two…” With free hands Harry touched his wand and the end of the magical line that was still tied to his jeans. He closed his eyes for a second and took a quick and deep breath…
“We’re going to be alright Harry,” he said placing a hand on Harry’s arm; it was warm and reassuring and Harry didn’t want him to take it back. Draco squeezed it, once and took it back. Almost immediately Harry wanted to chase the touch; he had to bite the inside of his mouth not to lean in and curl into Draco’s warmth.
He put his hands on his hips and looked up at the uneven, round shape ceiling, thinking of how much he did not want to punch Draco Malfoy right now. How the hell did he know, after meeting him the first time in what, seven years? how to push his buttons was beyond Harry. But Draco did it so effortlessly, like he was born to do it; to piss him off, to make Harry want to rip his head off, to push him against the wall and…
“Mate,” he said, watching suspiciously the sweaters and trousers and shirts that were laid by the few pairs of jeans that Harry had. “I think you’re too poor to date Draco Malfoy. No, seriously!” He turned after he heard his wife scoffing dismissively, roaming through Harry’s clothes. “Like, Malfoy had probably the most expensive shirt I ever touched when we brought him to Mungus!”
Harry didn’t miss that their ‘host’ didn’t confirm if the land was truly theirs and could only hope that Draco caught it, too. No, he didn’t just hope; he knew the other man caught it, he worked with him for the past weeks and knew how bloody intelligent he was. He was just afraid that all the other things would get in the way. So, he squeezed Draco’s hand hoping it would convey the massage he wanted to say: don’t be afraid, you’re not alone, I am here for you and with you.
“Ready your wand,” he whispered, so low that Harry had to strain his ears to hear anything. He got the jist when Draco as quietly as he could stood up from the chair, the wand in his right hand and positioned himself to jump. At that moment he looked truly lethal and Harry thought that if they were to duel right now he wouldn’t know if he wouldn’t just bail on the whole thing and run, screaming like a scared teenager. Everything in Draco’s movements was precise, no muscle moved involuntarily, his gaze was intense on the still moving light which was closer to the circle by the second.
; his heart started to beat harder, blood running through his veins so fast he could feel his cheeks flush and the tips of his fingers were tingling. But the darkness didn’t stop; it didn’t turn into a picture of a perfect house with a white fence, there was nothing, nothing, nothing and Harry felt acidic taste in the back of his throat. His mouth suddenly got dry and he felt drops of sweat on his face.
Sometimes, when silence fell between them, a comfortable one which puzzled Harry the first time it had happened, he
“Mate, you were gone for almost four weeks. We got an owl from Miss Perrywinkle that you and Draco just disappeared from the case so we started looking. You will tell me everything after the healers look over you, alright mate?” He added, tightening his grip on Harry’s shoulders and without a warning they materialised on the hospital’s front law and then it was healers asking him questions, looking through his cuts and bruises, giving him elixir after elixir to drink and when they finally let him sleep Harry woke up unknown amount of time later still tired but groggy, quiet lethargic and with a hallowing and aching need to see Draco Malfoy’s face.
The house was lovely. Very lovely. Probably lovely and Harry would think so if nervousness wasn’t burrowing a hole in his stomach as he ran up, his steps swallowed by a fluffy carpet on the stairs and in the hallway above.
“Oh please, you don’t have to keep the Prophet photographer waiting on my behalf, you can take the pictures by yourself.”
Sometimes, when he was reading something – usually a book written by a man – or watching something, he thought: was that what he was supposed to feel?
“Sir,” said Harry, really trying not to sound like a spoiled child. “I just think that after three years of being an Auror you would stop treating me like a teenager. You do not need me in the papers,
There were, of course, people with whom silence was nice. Desirable, even. Hermione was one of those people and Harry liked to visit her and Ron’s house and sit by the dining table while she worked and read and scribbled; it was relaxing to have her there, at hand’s reach, and yet not.
“The noises, for one thing,” Draco straightened his index fingers, counting. “There are also things missing, not much or many but still it’s a noticeable loss. Then,” third finger went up. “There are the doors.”
True to her words, immediately after the meeting Susan sends out a summary, point by point with the timeline. Draco clicks at the attachment where the whole timeline of the project is presented in such a clear and simple way Draco wants to weep. Not everyday you get somebody who understands that communication, especially in a company setting, must be efficient and as short as possible. How many meetings could have been emails? How many emails could not exist if the sender gave themselves a couple of minutes to look for the answer to his question instead of asking it? So many Draco cannot count, and many of them are waiting for his unwavering attention.
Then there was the house. Located on the outskirts of London, placed under similar spells as Grimmauld Place, it was a two storey building with an attic, a single tower to which Miss Perrywinkle lost the key to, a basement and apparently a ghost problem.
“Run!” Draco screamed and pulled Harry, who trailed after him. He felt a hiss of hot air behind him, heard the roar of voices as he and Draco started running through the jungle, the rope their only indicator, their only guide, of where they were going. Because the road has changed, and Harry felt that rather than seen, as they were jumping above the suddenly emerging from earth roots while shoving leaves away, they seemed to elongate and grow even more near each other; the leaves seemed to be sharper and Harry hissed a few time when a branch struck him particularly viciously drawing blood.
“Have a nice day,” he says, his green eyes crinkling at the corners. Surprisingly, his voice is deep and normally Draco would make a double take, but he is already looking at the man. He could be younger than Draco but by the look of the curly hair that is too long for Draco’s taste he could be in his early thirties. The puffy jacket makes the man’s brown skin a little bit glowier but it is a nice touch to the slouchy dark jeans and white converse. Draco nods in response as the doors hiss and open to show the same corridor that leads to his office, but instead of a giant, metal 5 there’s a 4 in his line of sight.
The wall from which they had undoubtedly come out was as solid as he was; two metres high, built from  red bricks that were crumpled around the edges. It seemed not to belong to anything: a wall built in the middle of nowhere was an unusual sight. A wall built in the middle of nowhere in a fairy world was highly disturbing. But still: it was a wall. Going around it didn’t make Harry see anything else apart from even more plants and how the red bricks looked on the other side, but there was nothing extraordinary about it.
Draco shook his head, lowering hands again to take a few thirsty sips. “Thought so. You really had a death wish,” he added, his voice low as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Enter the stage a man shorter by at least a few inches, with cute dimples and a nice smile, who’s currently looking straight at him with his green eyes and round, gold-frame glasses and
Harry stepped closer, and made another step and another, until he was close enough to feel Draco’s breath on his cheeks, until he could count each and every lash, see the different shades of grey in Draco’s eyes and tha barely visible freckles on his pale face that he hadn’t realised Malfoy had.
“As you said I am The Boy Who Lived and frankly I don’t give a fuck. No fucks given, Draco. So, Friday?”
Harry looked at Draco who nodded in return and they were sprinting, ground still shaking underneath their feet, towards the mausoleum when the light started to disappear as it went down, further into the ground. Harry muttered
Draco smiles, not looking at Padma. The course language is yes, highly unprofessional, but also very needed, especially recently. After Cho Chang left for her maternity leave, Padma got all her work just a month shy of being hired so of the people in the team Draco thinks she got it the worst. Christening through pain and fire, paperwork and long hours over Chang’s notes that even she didn’t understand.
Draco sights. “Unfortunately. Let’s just hope that Lockhart will actually talk with management about this, but don’t get your hopes up. In every team meeting we had, even before you, we had asked them about possibilities of hiring another person, and each time we heard that he is preparing a business proposal for the upper management.”
Allright. If you want to see how things go between you and him, just tell him. Don’t raise his hopes up: state the facts. The more communication you get at an early stage the more clear things will become between you two. Maybe he is also all for option three, with moving to option two, in due time and with your consent.
“But of course! We would not like to keep our esteemed guests longer than anticipated,” said the creature, bowed and started backing up. Then Harry saw what was behind it, and to say it was a ‘feast’ was like to say that Hogwarts was magnificent; on a previously empty meadow a table appeared draped in a cloth so white aunt Petunia would just die from jealousy. And on it, food was almost spilling on the ground; shining green grapes and apples red like blood in golden bowls; yellow mangoes sliced and each of the slices with small, golden forks in it. Bananas laid next to shiny pineapples and fruits Harry couldn’t name were carefully placed on the table so that the whole thing looked like a renaissance painting ready to be plucked out of the frame out of the frame and eaten with delight.
“No, they only taught us to get back to civilization as soon as possible,” answered Harry, without heat or anger in his voice, expecting the jab from Draco anyway. He took another sip of the water and stood up in fluid motion. “I’m going to gather as much as I can and we will have a fire in no time.”
Around one, when most people on his part of the open-office stand up to stand in line for the microwaves in the kitchen, Draco takes his phone out of the cupboard of his mini-cabinet and opens a chat he has with Blaise and Pansy.
“Yeah,” Harry dug the heels of his hands into his eyes to wipe the excess of the sandiness that he still felt and had to blink rapidly for the world to come into full view. “You don’t happen to know where he went?”
After a pause Draco shrugged and it would have been nonchalant if the rigidness of his body didn’t betray him. “After you lived through hell you cannot expect anything worse to happen.”
“What do you think we should do?” Asked Draco as, at the same time, Harry said, “Are we going in or not?”
Harry knew that he smiled weekly at that, knew that they had a company and he was caught hugging Draco bloody Malfoy, but really he didn’t fucking care. He leaned forward, his forehead resting on the other man’s collarbone and started to laugh, filling the silence of the catacombs.
, just dandy, nothing to see here folks, just a normal man trying to live his normal life not knowing what normality was and faking things all this time, a lie after a lie.
Draco does not have a lot of friends, but then, who at thirty years old has? There are friends that you see once a year or even less frequently; there are those  you stay in contact with but you meet in real life once all the planets are in the right phase and the moon is full and bright in the sky which also doesn’t guarantee you will meet them at all.
“Come on, Potter!” Draco screamed at the top of his lungs it seemed like, his feet striking the earth as if he was flying and barely touching it. “No lagging behind!”
Here he was, trodding through the mud, his trainers a lost cause, to the mausoleum of Perrywinkles, to meet the cursebreaker that the woman hired a few days ago to solve this case before it became something bigger and more dangerous.
Draco sighed as if he was in pain. “No, what I mean is that you will wake me up when you feel like you can’t keep your eyes open and we’ll switch.”
,” the creature said in low and enticing bones. Harry took a sharp breath and held it, waiting for Draco’s reaction; the other man had his eyes tightly shut and was biting on his lower lip almost drawing blood.
He wondered how the place looked like now, with Lucius dying in Azkaban and Narcissia taking over everything. Did they sell it? He heard about some of the pureblood families going bankrupt but he never heard that rumor about Malfoy’s. As soon as the judgment was done, with Harry talking for Narcissia and Draco’s lighter sentencing, the young Malfoy was out of the country, continuing his studies on the continent.
He had to hide his surprise when Draco squeezed back; his long fingers wrapping around Harry’s hand, hand slightly trembling and Harry wanted nothing more in the world to just hug the other man and protect him best he could.
to Harry. Things he didn’t want to think about, like the heat of Mafloy’s body, how he breathed hard and fast, warming his ear, and how firm his hand on his arm was. “Stop, Potter, for the love of god, for one second, alright?”
Lockhart puts his hands with clasped fingers on the table and smiles at them. It’s borderline creepy.
Harry scoffed against better judgment but shut his face seeing the look on Draco’s face; the one raised eyebrow and a challenge in his grey eye to say something. After a beat of silence the silver-haired man turned, his back to the doors — or where the doors previously were — and took a long, anguished breath.
“Hey,” said the voice and strong and warm hands took his face and turned it right. Draco’s eyes were grey like a sky just after the storm and you could see the first rays of sunshine trying to get through. “Hey, breath with me.”
“He said to thank you,” the woman leaned comfortably on the chair, crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. “Now, tell me what happened. In detail.”
don’t need to see my face in the Daily Prophet any more than the wizards and the witches of this community. I am just asking you to reconsider,” he gently placed a hand on the folder he just threw. “The cases that you’re assigning me.”
“We were charged by a Lady From Above to find who were their mysterious visitors who trashed her garden. We tried to talk to them, however, they didn’t, ah, agree to the terms of the talk and escaped the circle.” Draco explained, voice steady and unbreaking and Harry felt warmth blossoming in his chest because clearly the man knew what he was doing and he was doing it carefully which filled Harry with a sort of pride that should be examined if he had time.
Three stones were left and Harry more felt than saw a shift by his side which told me that Draco was getting ready. As if in response adrenaline started pumping blood in his system, the heartbeat so loud he could heat it in his ears, the
He swallowed nervously. “Um…” he was about to say something, anything really, but thankfully it seemed that Draco woke up and was alert enough to grab Harry’s left hand, squeezed it — for courage? Or reminder that he wasn’t alone? — and started talking.
“Only a little, babe, but you’re so smart I love it,” Ron stepped closer to his wife and gave her an obscenely loud kiss on the cheek. “Now take our loverboy to his destination and you,” he turned towards Harry, pointing a finger at him. “Don’t come back without talking to Malfoy, I beg you.”
After saving the confirmation of payment, which he downloads to two separate folders hidden within different folders, he is finally done for the day. There’re more than forty emails waiting for his response, projects that he should be diligently working on but doesn’t because there’s no time and… the rest can wait, he says to himself. The rest can wait.
It's pitiful, really. No, he needs to be honest with himself: he is bloody pitiful. He knows that he should be happy for Padma and he is, but a part of him, one that is still a Malfoy that was ingrained in him by his father and mother and their aristocratic family, wants to squash Padma’s happiness because it means he won’t be happy in foreseeable future, not at all.
dangerous that threatened to overwhelm him, he carefully lifted the covers and sneaked out of the warmth of the bed, tiptoed through the cold floor to the bathroom, looked at his reflection — red eyes and cheeks sploshed with red spots, which he always got when he cried, gift from his mother — whimpered in his arm and made a resolution.
He thinks and thinks until he hears giggles and whispers and a wave of people who just finished their lunch slowly come back to their desks, filling the open space with restless energy.
He expected the night to grow cold, weird sounds around them making his skin crawl and his hand tighten around a wand. But it couldn’t be further from that: it was quiet, apart from the peaceful and comforting crackle of fire, the soft hum of moving branches that reminded Harry of the holidays commercials that sometimes popped out on his computer’s screen the few times he used it (he didn’t abandon the muggle world, he sort of… slipped out of it, like a side character that was no longer needed). He sat cross-legged on the smooth grass, and thought,
“Yeah?” Harry turns his head slightly right as if trying to figure out something. Draco feels the wave of heat on his skin and bites the inside of lip. He only nods in response, clutching his laptop to his chest as if it was his baby while Harry has his dangling by his right leg. “See you on Teams?” Harry adds to which Draco nods, but with a shy smile.
Harry always thought that Malfoy would be the Master of Potions; he was good at it, he basically worshiped the ground Severus Snape was walking on and the course work… It wasn’t that it didn’t suit him either (Harry allowed himself a glance at Draco’s lean body, how his brows furrowed as he was looking at the runes, his mind clearly elsewhere).
The creature blinked and cooked their head left, the branch-like veins outlined under the skin moved in a way that Harry felt an acidic taste at the back of his throat. The veins pulsed, bulged for a second, and then went back to their normal visage and Harry had a very nasty flashback to when Mister Dursley would go very angry and everything in him, veins including, would just grow and pulsed dangerously with his heartbeat.
“The best I’ve had,” Harry lied smoothly, clicking the thermos and pouring some of the liquid to the cap and handed it to Draco. Their fingers brushed and an electricity current ran through Harry’s fingers to his hand and further; he averted his eyes from Draco’s mouth to his dark green scarf, not really trusting himself.
“Didn’t you hear,” started Draco Malfoy and turned towards Harry, stopping in the very moment he laid eyes on him. Harry almost flinched; it wasn’t like the years weren’t good but they were not exactly bad on him, too. He grew into himself; his arms were wider now and he was less bony, but his dark brown skin didn’t have the same shine as it did before, thanks to the odd hours, lack of direct sunshine and the general problems with sleep that Harry had. His hair was still a total mess: even though he cut it regularly it still had a life of his own.
The moment the light touched the circle they moved as one, sprinting from the bush, the first spell realised from Draco’s wand like a lightning, followed by the low rumble of earth when it hit the fairy who fell on the ground like a ton of brick, hard and at once, to Harry’s surprise. The spell he was holding buzzed under his fingertips but he would rather wait for Draco to tell him what to do, as he was the specialist in this situation. They stopped, boh breathing hard, a few steps away from the still alight shape, which Harry started to see under the moonlight.
“It has a name, you know. Some called it Feywild, many people think that Dungeons & Dragons creators just stole the name.”
Draco ignores the email. Honestly, there’s nothing more he can do right now; the invoices are piling up, the website of the Mexican bank just doesn’t want to cooperate and Draco really doesn’t want to spend another long afternoon in the office. He just can’t sit in the office until seven — again — just because of a bank; not him, not his superior, not his manager, not a colleague from Accounts Receivable, but a bank’s website isn’t allowing him to make a transfer of one bloody hundred dollars. This madness needs to end, and soon, otherwise he will be out of his wits.
“You’re what?” That statement made Draco turn and Harry swallowed nervously because the man looked as if something chewed him out; there were dark circles under his eyes, his shining hair was less shiny and more floppy and all Harry wanted to do was hug him and say that everything’s is going to be alight.
Draco was leaning against one of the palm trees, his head bowed, his body curled down. For a moment Harry thought that there was something interesting on the ground but then, very slowly, like a snake uncoiling, ready to attack, Draco straightened, his cheeks red, holding his coat in front of himself like a shield.
“Yes,” he said instinctively and then, as if by luck, he remembered that he didn’t eat anything yet. “It’s just that we have some fulfilling snacks already, ummm, before and…” Harry looked at Draco with a pleading look and the man squeezed his hand as if saying, “I got it.”
Harry was about to say something when a warm hand clasped around his mouth, as Draco leaned in dangerously closer, smelling like freshly made washing and citrus cut moments ago. He gave Harry a look, pressing his index finger to his lips — would he taste like the tea? Harry asked himself and swallowed hard, barely trying to contain the sound that was about to be freed if it wasn’t for Draco’s soft fingers — and then pointed at something on Harry’s left
“I have no idea, Draco,” with a smirk Harry drank from the thermos and pulled a face when the bitterness of the tea hit his tongue. “God, you’re right it’s truly awful.”
“Oh,” said Harry, feeling a cold shiver go down his spine. As if Draco felt it too, he looked at the other man and nodded.
After a brief pause during which the whole world seemed to stop, Draco said, “Why would you think that I would want that,” and Harry would gladly beat that stupid mug of his.
“So, if the water is enough, maybe I can offer something more?” The creature said and the leaves rustled gently in a sudden breeze Harry looked around gingerly and didn’t notice that the plate suddenly disappeared and instead two golden bowls with a crystal clear water stood before them. He tentatively peered in, drawn to the surface like a moth to light and he heard Draco’s voice quietly saying his name so full of tension in one, single word that normally Harry would pause and think, but the desire to see the bottom of the bowl was stronger.
, however, it was at least three times as big. It wasn’t the house that the feary showed the, but there were similarities; there was a dark green fence around the house, most of it overgrown by roses and the house itself was hiding in ivy that winded up to the second floor of the charming cottage. The moment they stepped through the squeaky gate the front door opened and Narcisia Mafloy, wearing what looked to be a sort of sleeping gown ending just below her knees that was more expensive than anything that Harry own with a robe that one cleary wore when they got the sad news about their husbands dying suddenly in a tragic accident the colours of rough sea.
Harry laughed at that, his chest a little bit lighter than when he walked in. “Yes, fine, we can do that if you really want, but after the job.”
And Harry Potter — him, but not him, at the same time — stepped out, in a cozy thick jumper with two steaming cups in hands. Before he handed on to Malofy he leaned in and kissed him on the cheek, a wide smile on his face and Draco kissed his neck and they both walked in, arm in arm.
It seemed a simple decision to Harry but Draco pondered over it for long, angushingly long minutes. At some point he just stared at the Kit Kat for a full sixty seconds before his eyes darted to the packet of salted nuts.
“Great,” Harry smiled a brilliant smile and the only thing he heard before Draco leaned in, his warm lips touching his and closing his eyes was, “You’re bonkers, Harry, you know that?”
Grinding his teeth he made his feet move — they were alarmingly heavier than seconds before — and he pressed his lips together, hard, because there was a moan that wanted to escape then and he wouldn’t let it, because…
He never met Dursley’s again after the war. Didn’t want to, didn’t need to. He had already a lot on his plate and having a panic attack in front of the only blood related family he had, just because he faced them and they brought back some very ugly memories to him, was not something he really wanted to experience. It was enough that sometimes he would lay in bed, his small bedroom dark, and watched the changing colours of the night on his ceiling having an existential crisis after an existential crisis.
“What my fellow traveler is trying to say is that the water will be enough for now.” Draco bowed his head and the creature did the same, its eyes still on Harry.
“Sane?” Harry shrugged. “Haven’t been in a long time. Serious? Deadly. So, does Friday, 8pm work for you?”
Draco looked at him for a heartbeat and for a splint of a second Harry thought that he was going to say something but changed his mind at the last moment. He turned to the sarcophagus, scowling.
Harry would have laughed at that if the presence of the fae wasn’t so prevalent; their wings were creaking softly like very old branches with every smallest movement, even if it seemed that the creature wasn’t moving at all, and he felt their eyes on them.
. But then his job — the odd hours, him disappearing in the middle of then night and so on — put a shadow on the relationship.
Harry shook his head and started to dress, while Ron talked about his latest case and Hermionie hummed in agreement, still looking through his clothes as if she hoped to find something better. It was hard to indulge in things after the Dursley for years programmed him to count every bit of money he had, although he enjoyed buying a hand knitted sweaters from old ladies whose grandkids helped with their Etsy shop. The burgundy one was soft and warm, one of his favourites; it had long sleeves that he gladly rolled up and the collar of his shirt peaked from beneath it, making it quite official and stylish, at least in his mind.
The ghost wasn’t the main issue that Miss Perrywinkle had with the house. It made some noises in the night, shook the house a couple of times, but overall it wasn’t why the called for the Aurors.
and his wand immediately lit up, but they didn’t have time; the fairy was fast and it was flying while they were jumping from step to step, trying not to stand on those that were cracked or which had crumbled under the sheer force of the quake. It didn’t help that the steps were still slippery and that there was no railing to lean on, except the cold walls which could collapse at them every moment.
What strikes him is the disappointment he feels as he stares at the message. The emotion hooks itself inside Draco and doesn’t want to let go, no matter how much he tries to not think about its bitterness that’s nearly a tangible taste in the back of his throat. He tries not to think about it; not about the message and how  blatant of an invitation it is even to his eyes; how there’s a part of him that wishes he didn’t escape from the meeting room that fast; how, for the first time in his life, probably, Draco
Malfoy snorted, throwing something that looked like one flip flop. “Yes, Potter, back to our surnames, I don’t know what did you expect.”
Harry fired another fireworks from his wand and the world around them erupted in reds and blues and green, giant dragons puffing sparkling fireworks fire out of their mouths sweeping above the tables and then soaring up to the sky.
Before he can think it over, before his inner screaming Blaise is silenced by Draco, he types the message.
“Why, Potter,” said Draco Malfoy, standing next to him, looking at the doors that closed behind him just seconds ago and sealed shut as if they were never there. “I thought that I wasn’t your
“Well, not in England you can not, but there are some people who specialise in them and were eager to share the knowledge.”
The man had longer hair — it would reach his jaw if it wasn’t gathered up in a messy bun — but they were still almost silver and even in this light they looked almost like silk. Harry thought that maybe, if he had enough courage to touch them, they would feel like the most luxurious thing in the world. The man’s face was sharper and a little bit tanned, his eyes focused in front of him. He sighed, deeply; Harry watched the rise and fall of his chest under an black, woolen coat, how impatiently the wand flickered in his hand, fingers long and slender.
“Have you tried to write to them on Teams?” Was what Lockhart wrote in between the many meetings he had and Draco balled his hand into a fist; otherwise he would probably try to punch the screen. How this man got the job of being a Team Leader to both Treasury Management and the Accounts Receivable is something Draco will never understand. He knows Lockhart too well and as the member of Treasury Management Team with the highest seniority he can predict, with the precision of an olympic archer, in how deep shit he is with his superior based on the way he puts  punctuation in his messages. He’s still good, but if there was space between the last letter and the question mark, well, Draco could book a room for a thorough conversation.
Harry gritted his teeth when a branch struck him on his right side, just between his ribs and he would have stumbled and lost the grip on Draco’s hand if it wasn’t his sheer stubbornness that kept him upright.
And the man smiles and there are cute dimples in his cheeks and with those words out, floating in a cold and empty elevator, he walks out with a white card in his hand to swipe it by the door.
“...so you see, Draco, the deadline for the project is the end of the year. Yes, I know we don't have much time but the management is pushing and I know that you’re doing such good work, so it’s entirely possible we will make it!” He adds, giving Draco that toothy perfect white smile. Draco has to restrain himself, otherwise those pretty teeth would be on the not so pretty carpet and he doesn’t really want to think about all the blood on the table and chairs.
The moment he sends the email the website loads up and Draco smiles, seeing the confirmation of the transfer. Their factory in Mexico will have electricity for the upcoming week, rejoyce!
“Oh, I’ve got that,” Harry took out his wand and from its tip a string of golden rope emerged; Harry took it and pulled, the rope coming out from the wand until he was sure that he had enough to wrap it around the wall and himself. “It’s neverending rope, it should disappear in eight to ten hours and I can make it invisible if I want to,” he said as he walked back to the wall, the rope warm in his hand like a lukewarm coffee on a cold, snowy day. He took its end, walked around the wall and wrapped it into a simple knot, making a circle around the bricks. “That should hold,” he said, taking the other end and tying around one of the hoops of his belt. He tugged at it, once, and looked up with a proud smile on his face to see Draco watching him — his fingers to be more precise — very carefully.
The sky is dark and the lobby is almost empty. The guard behind the long, stone desk nods back as Draco walks past and then stops just before the automatic door to tie the scarf tighter. The middle of October isn’t merciful this year; the sun sparsely comes out from behind the clouds, the rain seems to never end and Draco doesn’t remember the last time he left work while there was still some light outside. Maybe in July? Or August? He thinks, going through the automatic doors. A cold wind immediately hits him like a wall, making his eyes water as he huddles into his black coat.
. Truly, faithfully and for himself — so that the only person he could disappoint was himself and himself only — until he was finally sure that everything around him was as he wanted it to be.
And this was how the aurors found them, running down the slippery steps, Ron Weasly at the front of them, wands raised.
“The stuff on the ground would lit, probably,” he eyed all the fallen leaves, curled and dry, that looked like hay from far away. “Didn’t they teach you that stuff in Auror’s school?”
Draco knelt — not too close but not out of reach — and folded his coat, placing it gingerly on the ground, not looking at Harry, his eyes solely focused on the stream before him. He cupped his hands and lowered them to the stream to take first sips of water with his eyes closed.
“Hello, o Bright One. Thank you for your welcome, we’re sorry if we intruded on anything, we were unaware that the land was protected.” Harry promptly shut his mouth, tight, hearing Draco’s posh accent going up a notch if it was even possible. His voice was honey smooth and Harry wished he could just close his eyes and listen to it pronouncing words, over and over again, preferably his name but he wasn’t picky.
“First, we will start with the Accounts Payable, then move onto the Treasury Team, then Accounts Receivable, and General Ledger. You know the drill,” she looks at Draco, Bertha and Emma. “The rest of you is new here, especially you Harry,” she sends the man an apologetic smile. Draco furrows his brows for a second but he makes his face go impassive with the new information he just got. “If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Due to the tight deadline we will have calls every two days to check on the progress and if needed we can have them every day. I know you think this is impossible,” Susan turns off the projector and stands in the middle of the room. “Because of the deadline, but I can assure you, I oversaw worse migrations. Thank you for today and see you in two days,” she finishes, looking at each one of them. Draco wonders if Pansy does the same thing, but then her work environment is different. She has, after all, entitled white cis IT guys who think the world is their oyster and she is one of the few women of colour in the company.
So, he laid in his bed and thought and regretted, until there were tears spilling down his cheeks. And when the roots become too much, the pit growing into
“I would not stand there if I were you,” said the man, not even bothering to turn Harry’s way. “You’re standing on somebody’s grave, that is,” he added as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, said a spell quietly under his breath and made a complicated gesture with his wand, and then swore not so quietly.
“Malfoy,” Harry also nodded because that was the customary greeting between old childhood nemesis, was it not?
place. It was a familiar wetness which he felt in his bones and could know anywhere — he didn’t remember asking Ron what he and the aurors were doing there, but he remembered getting an answer, as Ron led him to a safe place when they could teleport to St Mungus.
They clearly have changed. He, well, for better or worse, has grown up and for the better part of his early twenties, tried to catch up to everybody around him without having the same experiences as them. While others thought about their exams and crushes he was trying to save the world. It became evident, especially after the world was saved, that there wasn’t much to do for The Boy Who Lived except, well, live. It turned out that if you haven’t done the “living” part in a long, long time, it can become a little confusing and depressing.
“Well, maybe some of it will rub off on me,” Draco looked at him and Harry had to nervously swallow.
“Hey,” he said to no one in particular, but when the curly, dark hair of his friend Hermione loomed over him he squinted until he felt a familiar cold frames touching his face.
It wouldn’t be professional; they were working together and they were associates, plane and simple. He didn’t ring Draco after work to go out for a beer, or two, or three and a quick and heavy make out session in a dark alley.
“I look like what?” Harry raised an eyebrow, leaning towards Draco, making the other man flinch and blink rapidly.
“Come to gloat, mother?” Said Draco not turning back but he almost cracked his neck as he spun around when Harry, very politely, cleared his throat and said, “Um, hi, not your mother, sorry.”
When Petunia opened the back door and found him sitting on the steps she gasped and forcefully grabbed his arm to bring him inside. There was no warm tea, no blankets, just accusations that he “did it on purpose, to bring even more attention to himself,” while Dudley smirked at him from the other end of the room.
Harry needed this job because he didn’t want to be on the cover of the Daily Prophet each time something happened, however, he wasn’t sure that trading the flash of the camera for grey eyes of one Draco Malfoy was better.
He does just that the next morning, dreaming about life filled only with things as sweet as the pastry he carefully cuts into halves, which tastes havenly. He still has the nutella donut in the fridge but this one, this one will be eaten after he comes back from today’s meeting at the pub with his friends. He will be drunk enough to not feel the slight staleness of the dough and sober enough to remember to eat it.
He knew even before they started to run, before their fingers touched, before they followed a fairy down the catacombs, that they were in some deep shit. Harry looked around, from time to time moving aside a gigantic green leaves of ferns that were as long and big as his body, the green buds much softer to the touch than he thought. The greenery seemed to be overwhelming them, smallowing the two men whole, every leaf bigger and greater than up above, in their world; the air was thick and moist and Harry was glad for permanent cleaning charms because otherwise he would have to be wiping off the droplets that had gathered on his glasses every few minute.
, told Ginny that they should split up, that even though it sounded so cliche it was really not her but him, he never felt so afraid as he did then. Fighting Voldemort was easy because fighting Voldemort was something he could prepare for. But breaking a loved one’s heart? That’s not something you can train for under the cover of the night.
“Well, if the food is enough,” they said and Harry felt goosebumps rising on his arms; it was the same kind of feeling he got before he was to word-wrestle with his superior or the journalists. It was the same kind of nauseating feeling he had before he watched Ron go to action, when he waited for any news of Hermione’s childbirth pacing the halls of St Mungus nervously while Ron was with his wife.
“He woke up three hours ago and signed himself off. Believe it or not he was in better shape than you were.”
He turned without Draco’s hand leaving his mouth, which was good, because it stifled a surprised gasp he was about to make when he saw the light that slowly emerged from the mausoleum.
“You defeated Lord Voldemort,” Malfoy smirked as Harry rolled his eyes. “Let’s see if you can do a more basic thing.”
“I was not!” Draco turned fully towards him, eyes wide in horror, mouth agape. “I was definitely not, Potter, take that back!”
Harry smiled at that and turned towards the garden, beyond the bush. The sky above was clouded but the moon, big and bright, peaked out from beyond the clouds like a surprise that nobody expected. He could almost count the craters on its surface.
“And there are the lights They usually come at night, near full moon or right after it. They don’t look like ghosts, either.”
“That’s all I ask,” said Harry and his heart beat a little bit faster. He only needed that; work, something to do, to pass the time that was otherwise empty. After running for so long he found out that normal life was a tad too tedious for his taste. Or maybe he just wasn’t doing it right? He didn’t know.
“Honestly Penelope, I do not know,” Draco says as he stares at his unlocked screen, at the questions that are piling up. He still has the chat with Potter open and…
Malfoy, still looking at Harry with wide eyes, opened, closed and opened his mouth again, to make no sound whatsoever, and close it with a snap.
Draco feels like he lost his mind; as if every part of him logged off and went off to have a vacation in some tropical jungle leaving his body by itself in a semi-warm meeting room where he couldn’t focus on the simplest things, like taking notes or asking questions. He feels, at the same time, the anxiety of being in the same room as Harry Potter and also a type of anger that’s like a smoldering piece of coal that doesn’t want to die down.
He was lying in his bed, feeling the outline of Ginny’s body at his side, her steady breath the only thing he could hear in their bedroom apart from his hammering heart.
“Yes, maybe. So, what’s your take on the case?” Harry preyd his eyes away from the handsome man’s face, hoping that the blush didn’t claw it’s way deeper inside his cheeks, making his freckles more pronounced. He inherited his dark skin and wild hair from his father, but the freckles and eyes were from his mom.
The nothingness seems to have consumed him. Everything should fit, like pieces of puzzles, into one image; however, after the war nothing went as it was supposed to be. Harry felt as if the race — the race of life — had begun long ago and nobody told him to start. Now, others were way ahead of him while he had only just begun to start to jog.
“None of those things,” Harry interrupted, before the other man could finish. “I just wanted to ask how I can help, seeing that you have the situation under control.”
“Finally!” Says Penelope, who send a message asking about the constant changing of languages and a couple of more things that just weren’t working with the Icelandic site
Or, as a matter of fact, Draco Malfoy would, as on the surface of the water he opened a small gate, wearing a soft looking puffy jacket with a white collar and tight, black jeans. He looked weary, as if he just came back from a long day at work, when the doors to the cottage opened…
“Do you hear that?” He asked, voice more rugged than he thought. He felt rather than heard Draco stopping behind him, feeling the waves of heat that his body emanated. He silently gritted his teeth and made himself stay where he was, because one step back and they would probably collide, which was bad, and if he shuffled awkwardly to the front, just a few steps aways from Draco, that would be plainly suspicious. The man was a curse breaker and was definitely not stupid.
What he saw was his own reflection; his unruly, brown hair plastered to his forehead, the clearly visible bags under his eyes, the wearines in them. His brown skin also looked a tad bit paler than usual.
“I think I know how to get us out,” Draco whispered to his cheek so soft Harry thought he imagined it.
Thank you so much for reading! Remember: kudos and comments are a godsent, be safe, stay healthy and take care of yourselves!
“It seems to me like the two of you have a lot of things to talk through.” She said at last after a long and tense moment of silence.
“I know that, Potter, you don’t need to remind me. If you’re looking for validation, though, you’re definitely looking in the wrong place.”
Mafloy’s eyes on him and something in his belly stirred with anticipation for the other man’s first move. Would he make one? Because Harry Potter very much would like so.
Then, as suddenly as it started, the water stopped. Harry blinked and blinked again when the blackness started to spread from the middle, like a drop of ink colouring the whole bowl black. The roots that were holding him seemed to tighten around his chest, squeezing his ribs
The last time somebody wished him a nice day was probably at his first job, years ago, when his dreams were still real and attainable, his family had some renome left and his father was proud of him.
And yes, his dreams about that involved kissing. And more. Sometimes. He wasn’t proud of them! He thought, before, that he dreamed about… combinations with Malfoy because he  put a nasty spell on Harry, when he wasn’t looking.But, apparently, when you don’t think about your sexuality when you’re a teenager because you have other things to do, like saving the world and so on, it comes back at you and bites you in the ass when you’re twenty and confused why you’re attracted to both men and women.
Harry cleared his throat. “There are no photographers waiting outside and there won’t be if you don’t tell anybody. I don’t want any press here. Do you?”
When he finally stopped at the bottom, the stone plate beneath his feet smooth and solid under his feet, he breathed a little bit better.
Lockhart blinks at him. “Well, we won’t discard them just because of another project, won't we? That would be very unprofessional!”
, objectify them to the point of them changing into a walking and talking mass of meat made specifically for his attraction? Was
Fortunately, Penelope looks at Lockhart as if she, too, knows how to deal with him. “I completely agree with Draco. At this point I cannot do much, yet, but I see Padma and Draco staying after hours every day. I do what I can but it’s too little and both of them have to take away some time off work to show me how to pay even the simplest things. I want them to help me more but it’s humanly impossible for them to sit all day with me to see if I’m doing the processes correctly and I’m currently working as hard as I can to remember the processes.” She finishes with a small and pitiful shrug. Draco wants to say that she’s doing great, especially for someone for whom this is a first time working in this kind of environment, but he doesn’t want the subject of the conversation to distract Lockhart.
to think about it; he buried thinking deep within him, under lock and key he threw away the moment the whole world was informed about Voldemort’s death.
He saw some of that boy in the man standing before him, in the way he held his head up high, how he looked at him and didn’t see The Boy Who Lived but just a menace from school that seemed to follow him even to his job.
The ancient, heavy metal doors were open and Harry peeked inside the long hall, that stretched down, down, into the darkness. He took out his hand which after a quick
“We are barely managing as we speak,” says Draco, as calmly as he can, even though his insides are boiling from anger. He is used to hiding his emotions and feelings; after all, what kind of a Malfoy would he be if he showed the whole world how pissed he is? It would not serve any purpose and would only make Lockart more hostile than he already is. “And we’re mainly managing because of overtime. Even if Penelope was at the same level as we and Padma are, I’m sure we would still be behind. We need a fourth person, Lockhart, even if Padma is on her maternity leave. This would make our schedule more flexible and if you hire somebody as soon as possible then we would have tangible help while Padma is away and hopefully she would be able to pass on some of her vast knowledge of the processes.” Draco says with utmost care of the words that leave his mouth; not one of them can be hostile or Lockhart will close himself up on his higher position and not even look down on them, who actually do the work day to day.
“Don’t drink anything but water,” he said, low, only for Harry’s ears. “And let me do the talking,” to which Harry smiled like Draco didn’t already assume that role. The other man must have read it from the smile or Harry’s eyes, because he shook his head lightly in amusement and went towards the table, their hands still clasped, no, their fingers entwined, which made Harry blush and try to hide it by bowing his head.
So, Harry left. Finished the case that required him to navigate more reporters than meeting the witnesses, closed it in record time even. And waited.
“Well,” said Harry, hoping that his voice sounded more sure that he did, because this thing? Even uttering the words that he was about to utter to Draco Malfoy’s back? Utterly terrifying. “I thought, that well, after everything was done we could have had dinner. Together. For a start.”
To call it a “suburbian cottage” was like saying that a villa with a pool in a center of London was ‘just a house one lived in’. Malfoy’s home reminded Harry of Kate Winslet’s house in
The trouble he didn’t want was already there, brewing under his skin, but at least he had something to do. For now.
The first two were… manageable. Miss Perrywinkle was a lovely woman with an agreeable amount of cats — four — which, to Harry’s surprise, did not want to eat him on sight (some used to more than others, he always liked dogs better). The first time they spoke she gave him more tea and biscuit — he couldn’t just say no to an older woman! — then Ron’s mum, mixed his name three times, but otherwise was lovely. Chatty, in a sort of grandmotherly way, always talking, changing topics, adding one thing to another until you and her didn’t know where she started from.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Yes, well, I have something that you’re lacking,” Draco tilted his chin up. “And it’s called manners,” he said with an utterly serious face but his eyes, the way they sparkled with mischief and held back laughter, betrayed him.
Draco is not usually very impulsive; he is the sort of person that needs to have everything thought through, be it a simple email or buying a flat. He likes to look at things, break down problems into smaller pieces and to look at them closely, to figure out the whole.
“I would ask what you’re doing here but I think I already have the answer,” Harry gestured with his wand at the books Malfoy casually spread out on the floors; the symbols and runes written in white chalk around the square, simple sarcophagus that seemed to be done from one piece of stone.
“Did you?” Draco arches his eyebrow. And then, adds, after a heartbeat. “Well. That’s good you did.”
Harry grit his teeth for a moment, wondering why the universe hated him so much. “Unorthodox because you’re the first person I have ever met who studies… them. Not everything revolves around your family or your past.”
It started, as all stories do, innocently. More so, not only because of who called the case in but by who took it over. Because Harry Potter didn’t like to think that he was an Auror figurehead, nice for pictures but not so welcomed on the ground, but for the last couple of weeks, months even, he found himself assigned to cases that were high profile, not very challenging and boring as hell. And to make matters worse he couldn’t do anything to change it; by now even the Aurors around Robart’s office knew it because Harry has been more and more vocal about his dissatisfaction with the arrangement of cases that were assigned to him.
He closed his eyes, feeling them burn with the oncoming tears. It wasn’t supposed to be like that; he was to defeat the Dark Lord and live happily ever after with the love of his life, but in the meantime it seemed that both him and the woman he loved grew up and apart in the process. And he
. There were strawberries coated in honey, blueberries big as sickle, various other fruits with chocolate still spilling from them to the bottom of the cups and Harry had an image of him, taking some of it on the tip of his finger and licking it.
“We’re sorry to hear that, our guests. We were not aware that our subject breached the gate to your world. We will fix it, and soon. In the meantime, would you like to join us for a feast? We would not like you to leave without a proper welcome. Our guests are very important to us,” said the creature and with the last sentence parted its lips in what would be an encouraging smile if it wasn’t for rows and rows of sharp, needle like teeth that the lips hid. Harry stared at it, probably a very improper thing to do, but he couldn't turn his eyes away.
“As much as I would like it, no. We would have to send an official email to the Treasury Manager in Sweden, then he would have to look into this thing, make a business plan if we can even afford the change and to which bank we could switch. There’s also a link between the current bank and the programme,” he points with his hand at the second screen where their accounting program is open. “So the IT would have to check that…”
The surface of his golden bowl in front of him showed him his own face and when it rippled and started to sway, creating a miniature tornado inside the water, Harry was transfixed, hypnotised by they sway of waves; he wanted to move with them but he felt rooted to the chair like and old tree is rooted to the ground through hundred of years.
Harry blinked and he was back to the damp interior of the vault, Draco’s echo laugh slowly fading away.
They stared at each other for what felt like an eternity, Harry’s skin prickling with an electricity, buzzing just under the surface.
Before he completely surrenders to misery he thinks that he deserves a treat. After all, he worked hard: everything was paid on time and the most important cases were taken care of. So why the hell not? He thinks and instead of going forward, turns right into a small and unassuming alley, where the best bakery has magically appeared almost a year ago, with the most delicious baked goods Draco has ever tasted. It’s a small treat, four donuts and a coffee to go, but he knows he will cherish those four donuts today and tomorrow. Especially tomorrow, god they will taste so good with his morning tea. Morning routine is always sweeter when instead of a bowl of granola with plain yogurt you eat a donut filled with mango and passion fruit.
What struck Harry the most — and he thought about it, much much later — was the fact that the both of them looked
He didn’t expect Robart to give him anything spectacular, but something that would require to use his brain and not only his mouth to smile for the photos.
As Harry and Draco work together it turns out they aren't half as bad as they thought... And the ghost in the garden makes an appearance.
“What Potter, you don’t want to sit on a cold floor, do each other's hair and laugh at the memories of how we tormented one another at school?”
He didn’t know what was worse; how his mother clearly loved Draco but who couldn't choose the wellbeing of her only child over anything else.
“Potter, it’s only me,” he said, though his gritted teeth as Harry lowever his wand, the spell he prepared fizzling away into nothingness.
“Get ready,” said Draco, voice so very low that a shiver went through Harry’s whole body; in anticipation of what was going to happen or arousal? Probably both, he thought, as he mimicked the other man’s movements.
“Ah, Hermione dear,” said the woman, flicking back her long, blond hair. She looked almost as Harry remembered her, with a few more lines on her face but definitely more content and happy than she was before. “Come in, come in. My son is just packing his suitcase upstairs…” She said, staring straight into Harry’s eye. “His room is at the end of the upper hall, on the far left.” Narcisia opened the doors wider to let them in. “Mathilda,” she said to a house elf that materialized just by her leg, in a bright pink dress with strawberries on them. “Please bring tea to my reading room.”
Their Team Leader nods, his hands still before him, fingers entangled. As if he still has this whole thing under control he says, “Thank you for your input, I will definitely talk with the managers about this. With that, thank you for the meeting, Padma, could you stay for a minute?” He nods towards the woman who nods.
Against himself and better judgment, Harry smiled. Because no one gave him shit like Draco Malfoy did. And in the light of the few torches Draco had on and which gave the inside of the mausoleum a soft glow the man looked… good? Better than the last time Harry saw him, which was at the trail. Even though, at that time, the Malfoy’s were put under much scrutiny by the judges and the community he still walked to that jury room as if
Get a job in finances, they say, it’s stable and the working hours are manageable, they say. But they don’t add that you will be working for nine, ten hours because there’s staff shortage, because according to your supervisor there’s nobody as competent as Draco for the additional position, because the person they hired two weeks ago is still learning and can’t stay after hours because they can’t do much yet.
Harry just sighed, deeply, from within his bones, “You just sort of looked as if you didn’t believe what I was saying, that’s all.”
Harry blinked at that, nodding. Then he realised that Draco couldn’t see him so he just said “Ok,” to which Draco opened his one eye, then second, and sat up.
Their hiding spot was a magically enhanced bushes, that Draco made grow and Harry obscured so that anybody who would walk to the garden could see just that; a bunch of plain bushes, thin branches that grew outwards in a manner that screamed for some cutting. But from the other side he and Malfoy, comfortably sitting on folding chairs (Malfoy just scowled at them when Harry took them out of his bigger on the inside pocket, but ultimately sat on them, hands crossed, as if their existence offended him. Harry smiled to himself, covering his mouth with his scarf, so that Malfoy wouldn’t just scoff at him, or worse, talk to him.) seeing everything that was happening in the garden with full clarity.
Draco thought deeply, looking around them, while eating a piece of the bar; he licked the chocolate of his fingers, his tongue pink and Harry nearly got a heart attack.
What, if that first year, he was kinder to him and showed more understanding? What if he tried harder, fought to understand him, gave him an option to keep him and his family safe? They were both
What he got was: an old woman that half the time didn’t remember who he was or what was her name, an old house that was probably haunted, and Draco Malfoy.
Before he leaves he puts the kettle on the table top, looks around the kitchen to see if anything is out of place and closes the door to his flat at precisely seven-forty am. The wind isn’t as biting but there’s still the smell of rain in the air, like a promise on the tip of the tongue, ready to be spilled and said. Draco takes a long breath, his lungs filling with air smelling of falling leaves, a touch of petrol and petrichor. With lunch in his bag — a simple pesto with pasta, he doesn’t have time to make something more elaborate and the recipe is a one he could make over and over again without tiring of it — Draco embarks on the short journey to work. The twenty minutes he spends walking is the only cardio he will do today, apart from stumbling the three floors to his flat after drinking with Blaise and Pansy, so he takes the longer route that gives him at least a touch of trees, nice front lawns and bushes that would love to take over every part of the city if they were only given a chance. It’s a nice walk, really peaceful, with not so many people, because most of them either use cars or the main roads. It’s almost like walking in the suburbs, but instead of identical houses he passes tenement houses which Draco secretly would love to own.
Draco’s door was wide open; Harry swallowed nervously as the blond man was standing before his bed, his suitcase open and half filled with what looked to be some smart clothes and some fancy wizard gowns. He was wearing a black shirt with rolled up sleeves, his Dark Mark stark pale against his skin and Harry wished Draco was as comfortable in his presence as he was in his own house.
, he adds, wishing he took the sweater from his desk as the meeting room is definitely too cold and Draco hasn’t even had his coffee yet. So he stares at Gildery dumbly, trying to comprehend what he’s saying, the meaning behind all the words that just spill out of his mouth, one by one.
Minutes pass but Draco doesn’t know how many: he simply doesn’t care. He is beyond caring. He trusts Susan enough to not ask any questions because he isn’t really sure if he can survive Potter staring at him as he speaks. And he’s not sure if he has enough confidence in his voice.
Draco closed his eyes and Harry could swear that he turned his face just a millimeter closer to his; that his hair brushed his nose and cheek and when he opened his eyes there was steel in them and the sort of fearlessness that one didn’t acquire or grew into but was born with. It made Harry straighten his back and shoulder, which made Draco’s lips twitch a little; a beginning of a smile.
We work on the same project together. What if we don’t hit off, what if I screw up and he will be bitter afterwards?
There was a time when he loathed how much he wanted this, needed this to function like a normal human being. People who thought that after saving the world everything returned to normal were deadly wrong and Harry would gladly punch them in their faces, because the reality was quite different. He missed those time; when he felt young and so afraid that the anxiousness of the whole situation became his everyday and he wasn’t frightened but felt alive. It was like a drug and partially that’s why he joined the Aurors, and partially because he simply wanted to help. His body thrived on those dangerous moments and Harry didn’t know when his work and his actions would be deemed ‘too dangerous’ for his supervisors, but he dreaded it and wanted it to be
“Yeah, well, what about you? You were always with Granger and Weasley like triplets that couldn’t be separated at birth!”
But there was none. Nothing moved, except the leaves they cleared out from their path, nothing made a sound, except their long breaths, rustle of leaves and their feet stomping on a branch.
“Just those that have crucial information, the rest is fine,” wrote Potter and Draco shook his head. Everything he had open was ‘crucial information’, that was your whole job when you were Senior Treasury Management Specialist. You knew bank accounts and passwords, you logged into those banks using tokens that were shorter and thicker than his thumb, you made transfers for amounts you would never see on your private account. Draco had to close every website and Excel he had opened and only then he accepted the request from Harry Potter to get this bloody thing with SharePoint fixed once and for all.
The lobby is almost silent, apart from the echoing sounds of people’s feet walking to the six elevators, three on the opposite sides of each other. He turns right, pushes the button and has to wait only a few seconds before the doors open soundlessly to a mirrored interior. Draco can see his tired face; the sunkness under his eyes, the combed back blond hair, the black coat that makes him look as if he is going to a funeral. But he likes the coat — it’s warm and was expensive when he bought it all those years ago and Draco doesn’t like to go shopping — and with the upcoming weekend he thinks that come Monday he will look better. There is finally sleep in his schedule, a turned off alarm clock and long hours in his bathtub.
Draco’s, “See you,” is as quick as his exit from the meeting room. Safely in the elevator -- alone -- he can swear he still smells Harry’s --
Draco frowned slightly, but nodded. “Alright, sorry, won’t do that,” he answers, a hint of something in his voice that Harry couldn’t name; a sort of understanding, maybe, mixed with caution. When Harry put his wand behind his belt he saw in the corner of his eyes that Draco was still tightly holding his, the knuckles white.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “When I say I didn’t see ghosts then I mean it. And yes, I saw ghosts,” he said, seeing Harry opening his lips and wanting to ask precisely the same question. “You forgot where I grew up.”
Draco side eyed him. “I’m not going to comment how you just ran here and drank before even checking if the water wasn’t poisoned.”
As Susan disappears behind the corner Potter looks up and there’s a sparkle of mischief of sorts in his eyes.
“But I don’t think we like that answer,” she adds, brows furrowed and Draco moves closer with his chair. Padma is right; the message asks more questions as if their email, with screenshots, wasn’t enough. It should be, but what does Draco know about the inner workings of an IT department.
The eyes opened for a brief second, closed and opened again. “I’m not as dramatic as you, Harry,” and then Draco was wrapped in a strong hug from Harry Potter.
“Carefull, Potter,” Malfoy shouted from the other side of the garden, wind making the strands of his silver hair move like branches of a willow tree on a gloomy Saturday morning. “You don’t want to know how much these cost!”
He isn’t ready to quit, not yet. If he wouldn’t like to inherit projects and cases from somebody that left the company he won’t do the same to anybody else. This way of thinking may doom him, but Draco Malfoy is a man of his word, one of the few things he is proud to have acquired from his family.
With the hot water making his shoulders relax and washing off the remains of the shampoo in his hair, Harry Potter stood, staring at the white tiles of his bathroom and having second thoughts. No, ‘second thoughts’ wasn’t a good explanation of… everything he was thinking about. He was mostly thinking about Draco; whether he wanted to talk with Harry or not, whether this whole plan was actually a good idea, if they were going to really do this… if Draco was going to say ‘yes’ in the first place…
“I can practically hear you scowling, Potter! Just put the braid on the ground exactly as I told you!” Added Draco, kneeling in the dirt he himself disturbed a few minutes ago.
As the fifth floor comes closer, the elevator slows down. The man puts his phone in his pocket and lifts his head to look straight at Draco.
Harry turned towards the other man, brows furrowed, a question forming in his lips, but it died when he saw the far away stare that Draco had, as he focused his gaze on the fire. Suddenly he looked older than his twenty-seven years; like a man who had been through hell and saw things that could not be unseen, but then weren’t they all like that?
“In other words,” interrupts Padma, “it’s too much of a hassle. The upper ups don’t care how things work, what matters to them is the fact that the payments are made, simple as that.”
He could feel his cheeks blushing and not for the first time in his life he was glad that his darker complexion hid the first signs of embarrassment very well.
But they didn’t move. For what stretched of a century they stood there, Harry’s back pressed to Draco’s chest, his breath softer and softer, his hand still on Harry’s arm.
Or don’t rejoice at all, he thinks sourly, just pile up all the emails there are and drown him in them. Let him die a swift death under all the paper, at least it will soak up the juices of his decomposing body. Once again ecology wins!!
“So, what’s your theory then?” Asked Harry, bringing the conversation, and his thoughts, back to the topics at hand.
“Does that fact stating head of yours brought something to eat, perhaps? I think we ought to stay here for the night,” Draco wiped his hands on his dark trousers and started to look around. “The sun is going down and I don’t want to be in the jungle when the light fades.”
He made himself take long breaths through his nose, his wand clasped on his hand, a charm already almost forming on his mouth; he felt the magic gathering in his wand, warm and sweet like hot tea with honey on a rainy and drafty day.
“I’m sorry that it’s that bad for you,” said Harry, truthfully. He was sorry that Draco felt as if he had to run from his home country to finally live as he wanted to, and not turn around to see if any reporters were following him. “But I thought that you would, you know, feel the best with people following you. You’ve always had someone with you at Hogwarts and you were a slight peacock.”
The meeting lasts an hour, even with the questions from the other teams. Draco is impressed how professional everything is, how Susan predicted the questions and answered them all.
“Ghasted thing that ghost is,” said Miss Perrywinkle over a second cup of lovely jasmine tea.  “Really horrendous, making all sorts of noises that nobody wants to listen to, waking me in the middle of the night. One of my sisters, Beatrice, used to do the same thing you see, waking me up in the middle of the night. I think she got it from our mother, Esther, who lived through the worst time during the World War. Did you know that in France....” and off she went, which Harry welcomed with a smile, a polite node and a bite of the exquisite biscuits. They were lovely; not too hard and not too moist. He wondered if the woman would give him the recipe.
“Well, out of the two of us you’re the Auror, so please, do your job that you’re paid for and please do it quickly. I have a fundraiser I need to attend in…” Malfoy took a pocket watch, silver and shiny, out of the inside of his thick black coat and opened it with a very soft
Draco seemed to take him all in, from head to toe and Harry could swear that something of an almost smile, the corner of his lips, turned up. “Well,” he said, his grey eyes as steely as his voice. “Did not expect you here. Potter,” he nodded and stood up in one fluid motion from the floor he was kneeling on, wand still in hand.
“Just…” For a moment Harry was looking for appropriate words, combing hair with his fingers and he shook his head slightly. “Just... forget it. Yes, hi, it’s me, I am the Auror. You’re the Curse Breaker. Let’s just…” He sighed, deeply, turning off the
“Yes, Padma will be with us as long as the little one will allow her,” says Lockhart, still smiling.
“I’m looking and not seeing anything remotely interesting,” Draco muttered and Harry laughed, titling his head back.
“That’s the real question, isn’t it? Muses Padma, scrolling through the emails. “Draco, I think we got the response from the Icelandic IT…”
He stopped thinking about his sexuality some time ago. It doesn’t matter, at least not to Draco. And after all, what is supposed to happen will happen, so. Or not, as is his case.
, thought Harry, trying to sooth his face into a relaxed mask of indifference while trying not to flinch and show how deeply his boss’ words cut to the bone,
“I never thought about it that way,” he said and wasn’t offended when Draco snorted and said unders his nose, “No, you wouldn’t,” as he carefully took his coat, folded it and used it as a pillow as he laid down, eye closed.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but it seemed that he had changed his mind; he strode forward, trying to add some sort of assurance into his step.
Draco straightened and shook his head as if he couldn’t believe anything that was happening right now. “You’re crazy. What would people think?”
The pace he started with wasn’t the fastest but also not the slowest; it should be manageable, especially in these conditions. Humidity was very high, he could hear Draco’s long breaths behind him, accompanying him with the rustle of leaves he tried to clear, or at least hold, for the other man. The birds, if there were any, were silent and Harry gripped his wand the whole time, knuckles white, eyes sharp and alert for any movement.
“Shut up Ron. You,” Hermione pointed at Harry without turning around, who was using a second towel to dry his hair, while the first one hung from his shoulder. “Wear the white shirt, the burgundy sweater and the black jeans.”
Harry stopped, a few steps after he came down, and listened, wondering if he didn’t go crazy. He had to be, because what he was hearing was a voice that he thought he forgot, mumbling some words weaving here and there a “
“Of course Aurors first,” Draco smiled fully at him now; Harry had to look at the palms and the ferns that swayed gently under a breeze that for a moment made the air more breathable. He didn’ want to do anything stupid.
“Should we start a fire or something?” Harry asked, rummaging through the pockets of his coat, hand disappearing up to his elbow, frantically looking for something he was sure to have. After a minute and with a flourish he took out a few protein bars, a packet of salted and unsalted nuts and an unopened bar of chocolate. “What, they’re in perfect condition and none of it is expired!” He said as Draco looked rather unimpressed at the things Harry seemingly salvaged from the depths of his very deep pocket. He laid the packets down, carefully as if they were made out of gold or a precious metal, on the grass and waved a hand around them. “Pick whatever you want.”
He keeps his friends very close and tries to walk to the other side of the road when he meets his enemies. And there aren’t lots of them, Draco Malfoy doesn’t tell people that he doesn’t like them all that much. There are a few people that could be found under this category, but they are mostly family and he hasn’t seen them in years. As an adult it is important to keep your priorities straight and meeting people, regularly at that, who make him feel
ignored his warning, but stopped himself. What his line of work taught him was that he should first think and only then act — something he was really working on — and knowing that this argument would mean nothing and would only make them hate each other more (if it was even possible) he decided to shut up.
Harry laughed, “But you were! Always showing off what you got from your parents, always with a full escort!”
“Of course,” Draco says but his voice is icier and more vicious than he anticipated. Lockhart looks sharply at him and for a second something cracks in the mask the blonde man wears.
Malofy scoffed at that and Harry looked up from the runs at the man. “We both were shitty teenagers, let’s agree on that.” Malfoy wiped his hands still covered in chalk in an expensive looking handkerchief, which was probably monogrammed as all pureblood things did, Harry though. “Let’s hope we grew out of our childish behaviour and are better adults now.”
Just before he closes everything a new email arrives in his mailbox about an IT ticket that was successfully closed.
He was sure that if he turned his head just an inch left his lips would find Draco’s and then he could finally test if Malfoy’s hair was as smooth to touch as it looked and…
At the same time the creature stood up and made a very loud sound that Harry could only describe as a pitiful moan mixed with a low growl of a threatened animal; it lifted it’s head, the moonlight glistening from its teeth, made the sound and took off, fast, its wings beating at an unusual speed, but sporadically as if flight took a toll on them. But the thing was fast and the desperation made it faster yet.
After five minutes Harry was unbuttoning the top of his shirt, his coat lying on the grass with his yellow scarf made by Ron’s mum — a gift from few Christmas ago — thrown on top of it, and he was rolling the sleeves of his shirt up to his his elbow when he head the leaves rustled behind him and he turned in one swift movement, wand already raised. He then stopped abruptly when Draco Malfoy, with his coat slung over one shoulder and slightly damp hair, emerged from the ferns and nearly screamed.
"Of course," Draco brushed the back of his fingers over his cheek, watching as Harry's face relaxed into sleep. "Oh, sweet.
Giving an innocent werewolf Wolfsbane to sedate him? Do you have any idea of the long-term effects that could have?
spell was used, it's hard to tell. It's not a standard Obliviate, I know that much, it's something more complex than that. Where's Draco? I thought he'd be with you, and I was hoping to get his advice about this—"
“Merlin,” Harry groans, dropping the quill into the little pot and rubbing at one eye with the heel of his hand, shoving his glasses up onto his head. “Thanks, Draco. I can’t believe I fell asleep again.”
Harry's answering smile is so soft and bright it's nearly blinding. He leans down to kiss Draco again. "So... Quidditch practice tomorrow? A Seeker's match?"
Malfoy looked around at the mutinous faces of his men, who all had their wands drawn and ready. "I don't think they want me to do that, Harry," he slipped, but no one seemed to notice. He drew his own wand. "So, what now?"
Harry slides his free hand between the sofa and Draco’s back and then down to grip his arse, pulling him tightly against him as he continues to ravage Draco’s mouth, and everything is perfect and Draco never wants the moment to end—
“Teddy. I mean, we talked about it once, but it was a long time ago. We just...we can’t risk it, upending his whole life. He's the most important thing."
“It was no problem,” Harry smiles. “You did a great job with the party—everyone had a fantastic time. Especially Teddy.”
"Well, I volunteered, really. Because I also wanted to thank you. For allowing us to stay, even knowing what a hideous monster Fenrir was, and after what he did to you."
"I know I'll have to fight him, but I don't know how or when. Or if I'll need to..." Harry faltered for a moment, "to kill him, or if I just need to best him in a fight. I'll ask Kasper more about it this afternoon."
"Understandable. Well, if my Alpha emotion-reading is correct, I think he may be almost done. He's feeling excited, relieved, hungry, and exhausted. You should take him something to eat. And you may want to find time for a nap before your plans tonight. And...he misses you, too."
"I should have talked to Ron about all of this sooner. I put it off because I knew he wouldn't take it well, but that was a mistake. I'll talk to him and sort it out between us. I'm really sorry, Drake, he shouldn't have said those things to you."
Harry inclined his head and folded his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling awkward. "I could never have asked you and Thomas to leave, Nadine. You're not Greyback. You're not responsible for the choices he made, especially after he left the pack."
you did that, Draco. I'm trying not to be angry, because it's over and done with and you're obviously fine, but it was incredibly stupid."
Harry asked polite questions and listened to the responses. Draco remained silent at his side, listening and observing, picking up on as many non-verbal cues as he could. He learned a considerable amount of information this way.
He indicated the pile of letters beside him, then tossed the book to Draco, who caught it and turned it over in his hands to read the title. Harry watched as his face turned crimson and contorted into a scowl.
The first brush of their lips was hesitant. Harry brought a hand up to Draco's cheek. Draco made a soft sound and pressed closer. Harry grabbed Draco around the waist and tugged him on top of him on the bed.
He doesn’t answer, and his eyes go distant for a moment. I let myself stare again. There’s no ring on his left hand, I notice, but that doesn’t mean anything. Some people don’t like to wear a ring, that doesn’t mean...but...why in the hell is he even
A few days later, Harry, Draco, and Teddy privately celebrate Harry’s full recovery by attending a Quidditch match: The Chudley Cannons vs. Aunt Ginny and the Holyhead Harpies.
Draco slid his hands lower, easing his fingers under the waistband of Harry's jeans, then under his boxers and onto his bare arse
He probably would, unfortunately. After running his fingers over the owl's feathers on the top of his head, the bird let out a satisfied coo and flew out the open window.
Harry smiles at him, and Draco is almost too enamored to notice that it doesn’t quite reach his eyes. Almost. He pretends he doesn’t notice.
“You don’t get to be...jealous...like this…” Draco gasps as Harry trails biting kisses over his jaw, then down the side of his neck, “when I had to
"Good morning, Harry! Breakfast is ready if you and Draco want to come down to the kitchen. Mathias and Laith made their famous apple-cinnamon pancakes!"
“That doesn’t seem like the kind of relationship that would make you…” Draco finishes the sentence nervously as Harry spins around and stands up, his eyes flashing dangerously. “...happy.”
murdered someone in cold blood like people were saying, but forcing him to ingest Wolfsbane with every meal was cruel. It might even be slowly killing him, as Malfoy had implied. Curly knew he couldn't live with himself if that was true.
Draco has no idea how to react to how well Harry and his mother get on. He’d expected awkward civility at the very best. And he
The entire room began to vibrate precariously, and the two men gave up any pretense of bravery and bolted down the stairs.
"What, that I still have feelings for you?" Harry says furiously, spinning around. "What gave you the idea that I
Draco Apparated to Wolf's Hollow the morning after he visited Harry, and immediately wished he'd come sooner.
Draco leans over to check the color, and it’s the perfect shade of lavender, as he expected for the Dreamless Sleep Potion. “Perfect, Harry!”
"Please," Nadine said politely, indicating a large sofa across from the chairs she and Harry moved to occupy. "Sit, and tell us why you've come to visit."
"Well, that explains why I was given the day off," Ron spoke from the doorway, where he was holding Rose. "They brought the entire Auror force, except one."
, you’re being gross,” he complains from the doorway, and they stop kissing to turn and smile at him.
He gave Thomas a warm smile, and the boy leapt from his mother's arms and ran over to the side of the bed. Thomas smiled shyly up at him, and Harry smiled warmly and held out a hand for the little boy to shake, which he did. "Nice to meet you, Thomas."
Draco. I was...I was trying to distract myself, and he was there, and he was willing, and I knew I wasn’t happy, but in the moment I didn’t care, because I didn’t think you would ever…”
"I'll owl Hermione and cancel our lunch today," Draco murmured as he perched on the edge of the bed, brushing Harry's dark hair away from his face with his fingers.
"I hated him, Andy. Voldemort, I mean. I wanted him dead. But I wasn't brave, I just wanted to get to Draco. I just wanted my baby, and you lost yours that day, your Nymphadora. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Harry laughs and obliges him, taking off his glasses and laying on Draco’s chest, sighing contentedly when Draco slides a hand through his hair. The conversation starts back up, and Draco marvels at how comfortable it all feels.
"You're mine until wedding time tomorrow!" Pansy grabbed him by the arm. "Say goodbye to your handsome future husband until then!"
“I’m sorry Draco, I’ll stop,” Narcissa says apologetically. “I’m just happy for you, that’s all. Things are going well?”
He nods, looking at me with so much hope and longing I feel like I might drown in it. I feel another rush of guilt. If I’d just given him a chance to explain, if I’d read his letters instead of letting my anger and pride get the best of me....
One quick Apparation later, and they were outside their favorite pub. A few short minutes after that they were seated at a table, drinks in hand.
"Yeah?" Harry was breathless, his eyes  incredibly soft as he looked down at him; the warmth in them helping warm Draco from the inside out.
!" Harry shouted, and the other Aurors followed his lead and attacked. Malfoy blocked the spell with ease, and Harry advanced on him, calling out, "Malfoy is mine!"
The last time Draco had seen Harry, the fireplace had been crackling pleasantly, warming the room against the chill from outside. Harry had pulled the curtains back, and the bright afternoon light was streaming through the windows.
"So this is the only classroom currently in use," Harry pointed into the classroom and Hermione and Ron peeked inside. "But we have two more prepared if we need them. At the moment Lewis is teaching the older students in the morning and younger students in the afternoon, and an adult magic class in the evenings one night a week. I'd like to get a second teacher by the end of the year, but for now Lewis claims he doesn't mind."
Draco had owled, tried to floo-call, had even apparated to Grimmauld Place and knocked, but he got no response.
"Ten. I thought I'd have him meet us in the Parlor in the East Wing? That way they can just Floo over directly."
The grey wolf lunged at the black wolf's throat, but was thrown off course when the red wolf launched herself at him, knocking him to the side.
"I'm fine," Draco answered, running a soothing hand over the back of Harry's neck. He laughed softly when he glanced over his shoulder at the horrified Aurors still pointing their wands at him. "Potter, you're making a scene."
Draco stares at him for a moment before shaking his head incredulously and moving to the next scar, another gash over his abdomen.
“Okay.” Draco glances at the clock. “We have two hours until Hermione sends Teddy home. I’m guessing you told her to send him here?”
Oliver Wood stares at Marc, clearly expecting a different response to this introduction, and Draco has to bite back a laugh when he realizes Oliver had expected to be recognized, too. Oh, being Harry Potter’s boyfriend must be absolutely
"Mmm. No, you don't. You need to stay here. In bed. With me. All day." Draco punctuated each break with a kiss, and Harry was tempted, but...
He helped prepare lunch and supper when it was time to eat, much to everyone else's surprise. He cooked and chatted with Grace, joked around with Laith and Mia-Rose, went for a walk with Nadine and Thomas, and talked quidditch with Mathias. Sofia was still nervous around him, but he smiled and talked with her when she was nearby, too.
"Have it your way, Potter. So long as you arrive at my house at eight o'clock sharp on the seventh."
Draco blinks at him. “That’s...a brilliant idea. You don’t mind? We usually spend Saturdays together when Teddy is with Harry.”
They both turned to look at the newcomer at the end of the aisle, a stranger with a camera hanging around his neck. Paparazzi following Potter, undoubtedly.
"It's because Harry's injured, and things with the pack are in upheaval. Normally they can be separated for extended periods of time, but not right now. Not until Harry's back on his feet. Help me get him back to the hospital, will you?"
Kingsley nodded solemnly before turning to Harry's best friend. "What about you, Weasley? Want to help me get this department back in order?"
Harry resisted that urge, knowing that Draco needed a minute to just breathe and adjust to being home, and then he was going to need a long rest. So, Harry forced himself to wait, tapping a foot impatiently under the covers.
"Look at you, making jokes," She teased, "Draco's already been a good influence. You're awake. You're talking to me about your feelings like a normal person... Let him help you, Harry. He
Draco followed him up the stairs, his brow creased. Harry seemed significantly better than he'd been the day before, despite the horrific morning he'd had. Surely, taking away his Dreamless hadn't caused this much of a change in him?
"What about Remus and Sirius? Or Remus and Tonks? They never saw things that way, and neither did you when it was them. Why is this different?" The soft response from his friend made him want to break down.
, Draco. And aren't you glad I was late? Gave you the chance to shag your lifelong crush, didn't I?"
," the elf said sympathetically, seemingly completely unfazed by Harry's appearance, "you is needing help into bed?"
“I came back to make sure you’re okay,” Teddy walks over and wraps his arms around Harry's waist, hugging him tightly and burying his face against his shoulder. He’s already at Harry’s height, and likely to surpass him within the next year. “I know you’ve tried to keep everything you went through from me, especially your childhood, but I know more than you think. I love you, Dad.”
"There was no way to know for sure. If your Glamour hadn't come off, getting out might have been a really good thing. I was just nervous something would go wrong, and I didn't want you to get hurt." Draco moved one hand into Harry's unruly curls, gently massaging his head and inwardly cheering as Harry relaxed in his arms. "What happened with your Glamour?"
Harry takes the lift down and walks to Draco's office with the slow steps of a man walking to his own execution. He raps sharply on the door and waits.
Draco cuddled up against him, nuzzling his face against Harry's chest. "Mm. So warm. 'S nice. Thanks, love."
Draco had dug around in his bag and found a Pain-Relief Potion and offered it to him, offering to hold him too, if Harry needed that. Harry did.
They would eat meals together, play chess or exploding snap, read, nap when Harry got tired, and, most of all, talk. More than they ever had before, and about things they'd never been bold enough to bring up in the past. Now, they talked about anything and everything: Voldemort and the war, Hogwarts and how they'd perceived each other as young teenagers, their vastly different childhoods (a subject that filled Draco with outrage and fury every single time), and, while they scoured for more information each day, about Harry's discovery about Greyback's former wolf pack.
Draco nodded shakily, still clinging to him. Harry ran one hand over his back and the other through his hair. "I'm sorry," he whispered, "I'm sorry they don't see you the way that I do."
"I don't know, but we're all out. You used it all after taking that Bludger in the last Quidditch game."
Draco rolls his eyes at him. “No, they’re not. I’m not nearly drunk enough to process this. And no, I’m not going to hex anyone.”
"I know, I'm really sorry Ron. That was completely my fault, though. Don't blame Draco because I messed up."
He followed Harry through their bedroom, where Harry carefully set aside his suitcases, and into the bathroom, where Harry turned on the water to get it nice and hot.
"I know. It...it just got out of hand." They stare at each other, and Draco's lower lip trembles. "Harry?"
Draco pouts again, and then he shivers. His body shifts from scorching hot to freezing cold in a flash, and he panics. "Harry!"
“Already took care of that while you were getting the bottle. Hermione is coming by in—“ Harry squints at the clock on the mantle, “—about five minutes. To pick Teddy up for a ‘surprise sleepover.’”
And, at the center of it all, Harry's school rival, Draco Malfoy. Malfoy. It had always been Malfoy, hadn't it? This was
“One of the other children was bullying one of Edward’s friends. Edward used his metamorphagus abilities to create a rather upsetting caricature of the other child’s features, emphasizing her, erm, rather large ears. And giving himself an elephant trunk.”
They land in the square of a small village, and Draco sucks in a breath. He knows where they are. It's where he always suspected Harry would go, and he recognizes it because his parents had brought him here once, as a child.
The house elf nodded vigorously. Hermione was barely keeping it together, but she gave the boy a smile.
Draco thinks vindictively that it’ll be much harder for Harry and Derek to shag every night for the next month while Harry has Teddy, and then chides himself for the childish thought. So Harry has decided to be a stubborn, selfish prick; that doesn’t mean Draco has to stoop to his level.
Draco smiled back. "I'm glad. Although I could have done without the 'humiliate Draco' portion of the evening.
Harry stood up slowly and shook out his body like a dog, yelping in pain when he tried to take a step on his front left paw. He limped over to the side of the bed.
"Not exactly," Harry said slowly, "something like that, but also a hospital, and a school. All in one. A sort of...sanctuary. The children could be taught magic in a safe environment. Healers could be trained in werewolf magic and healing. I want to fight for rights within the magical community as well, fight for acceptance and peace, but what if we started by showing that werewolves just want safety and security? Hermione is already working on the rest."
Draco brushed his fingers over his cheek. "I wanted to pretend too, love. That everything was okay, that we would really be getting married next year, that I would get a lifetime with you instead of just a few weeks. It's not enough. We need more time. I...I can't lose you like this."
"I painted it a light grey. It feels much brighter now without that dark wallpaper. Now I just need to fill it—furniture, decorations, horridly orange Chudley Cannons posters," Harry rolled his eyes at Ron when he mentioned the Quidditch team.
Draco thinks. They crinkle at the corners as Harry smiles at him again, and Draco’s stomach flutters nervously.
"Very safe," Harry smiled. "Werewolves are only dangerous on the night of the full moon, and we intend to have the place locked down and heavily Warded on those nights, as well as providing Wolfsbane Potion for all the wolves, so that none of them will be dangerous. Even with those precautions, George won't need to be on the premises after sundown, especially on full moon nights. But most of the time we just look like me, perfectly normal, I promise."
"Fuck," Harry breathed, head tipping back and eyes fluttering closed as Draco pressed open-mouthed kisses down the side of his neck.
He cringes at the unmistakable sounds of kissing when they reach him: lips smacking, a low, muffled groan, a gasp, a sucking noise, a breathy, feminine giggle that sounds like Harry’s name. More kissing.
Something about the way he says it feels...off. I stare at him for a second before asking, “D’you…is it okay? I know I look different from before—“
"Erm, okay. I was working as an Auror when Greyback escaped custody. I worked the case and searched for him, but months went by without a trace of him, and then he purposely revealed himself. He was setting a trap for me. To kill me. I killed him instead, but he managed to bite my shoulder first."
We tried to stop them, we tried to run, but there were too many, they brought the whole force, and McDougal, he's—he's been looking for an excuse to lock him up. They're saying he murdered Lorcan, that werewolf laws don't matter, even though Harry wasn't even the one to kill him, but he'll never tell them that, and they're going to put him on trial—I don't know, it's bad, Hermione, I can't, I can't—"
“Oh! I’m sorry, I forgot introductions. I’m Charlotte, well Lottie really, no one calls me Charlotte. Dudley and I got married about five years ago. And of course you met our little Violet, she’s three.”
“Good, because I could use a drink,” Harry pours each of them a generous portion of Firewhisky and passes one over. “Can you believe we’ve been doing this for almost a year?”
Draco's apology through the Floo after breakfast as met with a tight smile and a forced, "thank you," but he didn't know what else he could do.
Kasper? We either settled the terms for the Challenge today, or we initiated a full-on civil war within the pack within a month. Which is worse?"
He closes the door behind himself, presumably to let Draco change, and also hyperventilate, in peace.
, Mr. Potter. Then up to bed with you," Madam Pomfrey says sternly before disappearing into her office.
Harry felt his stomach clench painfully, even as desire flooded through him. He stilled, then pulled away, and Draco groaned in frustration. "Not again! What the hell is wrong
"Your arse is a thing of beauty, did you know?" Harry ran a hand over Draco's backside, then pulled a quilt off the back of the sofa and draped it over them both, casting a wandless Cleaning Charm that tingled when it ran over Draco's bare skin. He settled on top of him and Harry set a hand on his back, absently tracing his fingers over it.
"Only about an hour. I used a Lightening Charm, but it wore off just before we got here. Where is here, anyway?"
Draco took them from her and tucked in gratefully, the discomfort in his stomach easing with each bite.
“Draco, I’m an adult.” Paul places a hand on his shoulder. “I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to do. But it was clear within about ten seconds of being around the two of you that you’re in love with Harry Potter. This isn’t the shock you think it is. I suspected before, actually, just from the way you talked about him, but seeing you together confirmed it.”
"Are you sure, Harry?" Hermione couldn't help asking. "You're a natural leader. You would be a good Alpha."
Draco kisses my shoulder, running a hand down my left arm, where an elaborate sleeve depicts the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. A full moon is visible between the trees on my bicep, and a stag, a dog, and a wolf can be seen frolicking together on my forearm. “I can keep a secret. Explain this one.”
Lorcan turned and walked over to the solid wood table, sitting down heavily and glaring pointedly at Harry. "I've been leading this pack for a long time, Potter. What makes you think you're ready, that you're even
His own heart was racing as he followed suit. "Harry, everything will be alright. They can't arrest you, it's like you said, Kingsley wouldn't—"
"Don't think about that," Draco chided softly. "It won't do any good. Come on, come back to bed, darling. You're exhausted."
Harry smiles and touches his face again. "Rest and drink fluids, so that you can be better before then," he says firmly.
“Hello,” Draco looks up from where he’s working, chopping ingredients for his next potion but not actively brewing.
been feeling better. The lethargy has been easing up, just like your book said it would, so that's a relief. Thanks."
Teddy begs him to stay, eyes welling up with huge tears, and Draco can feel his face get hot, whether from embarrassment or anger he isn’t sure. Probably both.
"They'll be taken care of too," Harry smiled gently. "I'm pretty well off, actually. I inherited the Black family fortune. And the Potters were wealthy, too. My grandfather invented that popular hair potion 'Sleekeasy's.'"
Ron nodded and stepped forward, attempting to hug a stiff, unresponsive Harry. Ron drew back and awkwardly patted him on the shoulder, shifting awkwardly in place. "Sorry, Harry. I s'pose this wasn't such a great idea."
Draco stares at him, eyeing the outstretched hand warily for a moment before accepting the handshake with a
They both freeze at the sound of a loud knock on the front door downstairs, then turn to look at each other with matching bewildered expressions.
Draco levitated Grace into one of the cells and closed and locked the door with the key, then reinforced the locks with magic, just to be safe. Situation defused, he turned toward the other wolves. Laith was kneeling beside Sofia in the stairwell, while Nadine and Thomas clutched each other tightly in the center of the room.
"I couldn't possibly care less what Weasley thinks of my relationship with Harry, Hermione." Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry sat up and licked his face affectionately, nuzzling his nose against Draco's cheek before settling back down in his lap.
After Harry closes the door behind himself, Draco sags back in his seat. He covers his face with his hands, letting the cold façade fall away.
Hermione's hands were over her mouth. She slowly lowered them to her lap. "I—I don't even know what to think, Harry. I can't believe he would put himself at risk like that...he's crazy. Or maybe just crazy about
. This will never work. What does he want from me? A sordid affair? He’s bored of his little Pureblood wife already? I can’t do that, I can’t
Rita Skeeter wrinkled her nose in distaste as she stepped through the Floo a few days later, followed by a photographer, who looked around curiously, his eyes wide. Even Rita's carefully masked expression let some of her admiration for the place slip through.
Harry shakes his head to clear it and takes his bag from Draco with a smile and another kiss. "Thanks. Good luck on your Arithmancy exam this afternoon."
A hummingbird Patronus burst through the door. "Healer Gordon! You're needed on the third floor! It's an emergency!"
“I’m not secretly dating your mum!” He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, still chuckling softly. “Merlin, Draco. Teddy’s
"I, um, I'll talk to him," Hermione cleaned up the mess from the soup with a swish of her wand. "Sorry, Harry."
The abrupt disconnection hurt more than he cared to admit. Draco couldn't deny that he'd developed feelings for Harry. Maybe he'd scared him off. But... he'd felt like Harry had felt something for him, too. That was what stung the most: The hope Draco had begun to feel that this thing between them was developing into something more, something real, was dashed without any sort of explanation or closure.
“Just like every summer,” Draco winks, and Harry gives him a warm smile as he wandlessly Summons his own wand to his hand. “Only takes a few awkward moments like this to get back in the habit.”
Harry's face lights up at the sight of him, and that softens him a bit, but he still glares at the two young men in front of him.
With one last vicious glare around at the bar owner and all of the patrons inside, Ron scrambled after him, catching him by the arm when he caught up to him in the street.
"I've had a talk with him. He knew you and Harry were shagging, but he didn't think it was anything beyond that. Overhearing us talking about... you know,
When the Healer returned, Harry was sitting up, having taken his potion, with Draco's head in his lap.
"Oh good, Harry found Malfoy," Auror Weasley said sarcastically, pulling a face at the sight of them.
She walked closer and summoned one of the chairs by the fireplace to sit in beside the bed. "I'm really sorry about Ron yesterday," she murmured.
Draco walks over to join them, slipping a hand into Harry’s. Harry gives his hand a squeeze in welcome and glances at his watch on his other wrist.
"Fucking hell Harry, do you have any idea how hot that was?" Draco grabbed his fiancé around the neck and pulled him into a fierce kiss.
“Lovely.” Narcissa gently wakes up the sleeping boy and helps him up, guiding him toward the door. “I’ll just take him up to bed, then. Happy Christmas, Harry. It was wonderful to see you.”
The next glint that catches his eye is his boyfriend's bright hair as they pass each other going opposite directions.
He could be civil, however, for Harry and Hermione's sake, and so he drew from his patrician upbringing and spoke in a deceptively pleasant voice. "You said it didn't feel like a normal dream, Harry. You were
"Fucking hell!" He swore loudly, and briefly considered attempting to Apparate without his wand. Deciding it wasn't worth splinching himself, he reluctantly pushed the door open.
When he finally finished, she was stunned. "That is a lot to take in, darling. What are you going to do now?"
Harry appears in front of the Floo a few seconds later. He’s dressed in a nice button-down shirt and trousers, hair sticking up and lips slightly swollen. He fixes his crooked glasses as he kneels down. “Hey, what’s going on?”
Harry’s voice startles him out of his thoughts. “Er, yes, I’m fine. It’ll just be me. But yeah, I’ll be there.”
Draco nodded and sighed. "I'll try, love. I'm still a bit angry, but  in the spirit of that promise, I'll apologize to him for my outburst last night. For you."
He set his hands on his boyfriend's hips and tugged him close, hugging him from behind and effectively cutting him off. "I told you. I don't sleep well without you in my bed," he murmured in Harry's ear, sending a shiver down his spine.
"Did you want something from me, Malfoy?" Harry teased, rolling his hips up to grind against Draco's.
Draco read the letter again, briefly closing his eyes against the tide of emotions that threatened to overwhelm him.
Harry comes back in a t-shirt and jeans and follows Draco's instructions until dinner is on the table.
Draco pulls them down, then wraps a hand around Harry's cock, feeling a surge of pride at the truly rapturous expression this act elicits.
"Parkinson will be here any minute," Harry panted, dropping his forehead to Draco's shoulder. "We need to stop."
In the hallway, he starts panicking slightly, desperately hoping Harry had been asleep. He’d seemed like he was, his breathing was slow and steady, but if he wasn’t, would he think that Draco kissing his forehead was weird? Would he—
Ron downed the rest of his in one go. "Right. Next round's on me." He rapped a hand awkwardly on the table and stood.
Harry didn't answer, as his mouth had run dry at the sight of Draco stretching unabashedly on the bed, all long limbs and smooth pale skin. He swallowed hard. Draco smiled even wider when he caught him looking. He quickly adopted an innocent expression, but there was no masking the mischievous glint in his eyes.
He'd taught himself to play guitar two years ago, and had a surprisingly nice voice. Occasionally, if Draco was lucky, he could convince him to play something for him.
Teddy makes a brief appearance for introductions before disappearing back into his bedroom, apparently woken by the loud knocking and unfamiliar voices downstairs, and then they get Lottie and Violet settled into the guest suite to get ready for bed.
But typically, Harry comes home sober and unusually quiet. He eats the food that Draco makes and thanks him in a voice that's barely recognizable as his own.
She barely has time to nod before Ron grabs Draco's arm and Apparates them directly to the hospital Waiting Room.
"I don't know why," Harry said. "But I pretended to be weak until I knew I was strong enough to break through the wall and Apparate to the Ministry, and then I just...did."
"Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise —"
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Harry teases, his eyes widening innocently, “did you want me to contradict you? Rewrite history for you a little bit?”
"Of course, Harry. I was happy to help when I got Draco's Patronus. That stag is lovely, by the way."
"Wolves. They're really scared about something. I don't know what, but I could feel their fear. Just like..." He trailed off with a pained expression, a wave of nausea hitting him hard and making his stomach turn.
A wave of guilt crashed over him, and he dropped his head into his hands. "Oh. Oh, Merlin. I'm so sorry, I should've realized—"
“YES!” Teddy pumps a fist in the air and takes off running, his best friends cheering and following behind.
“Yeah, it was just a first date. A setup, you know. I was grateful for the excuse to get out of it.”
Harry smiled and ran a hand through Draco's hair. "Yeah, this Alpha thing is strange. I still feel like myself, but at the same time, I can tell I'm different. I know things about the wolves without them telling me, and I know instinctively what they need from me. What to say, how to act...and I can feel their strong emotions, too. For example, I can feel Lorcan's fury and hatred from here."
Draco slides in too, cuddling up against him. Harry gives him a soft goodnight kiss, but keeps to his word and doesn’t try to turn it into anything more.
On the plus side, it keeps anyone who might have approached him or spat the words ‘Death Eater’ at him under their breath away, so part of Draco is grateful.
"Well, I found him, newly hatched and lost and all alone out on the property right after I bought the house, and I brought him in and raised him myself, so I'm practically his mum." Potter grinned and turned to give the sauce a slow stir.
All of Draco's emotions came bubbling to the surface, his love for Harry, his jealousy, his frustration, his desire— it was all suddenly too much to contain.
And then he’s gone, Victoire trailing after him after kissing her parents goodbye. Draco catches the look she gives Teddy when he’s not looking at her, and he grins. He has a feeling she and Teddy are going to be just fine.
"Mhm." Draco couldn't resist pulling him closer and deepening the kiss. He was still feeling a bit jealous, and he wanted to claim what was his. Harry made an appreciative noise and pulled him up into his lap.
"I'm a Death Eater." Draco drags his left sleeve up to brandish his Dark Mark. "I may be a bit more pleasant to be around now, but I still have
She sobers immediately, standing up and setting a gentle hand on his arm. “I’m sorry. I just don’t understand, darling. After all this time,
Draco and Teddy arrive at the Burrow a few days later just in time to watch Harry storm out of the house, his best friend on his heels.
Harry grinned and took the parchment from Thomas to examine his writing practice. "Nice work, Tommy! I'd love to come for a walk." He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Can Draco come with us?"
"We knew nothing of the Sanctuary until we arrived here, we just knew that if anyone could protect us, it would be you."
Harry's heart clenched painfully in his chest. "I...I'm really sorry, Teddy. I wasn't feeling well for a long time. I just needed some time to feel better."
"I love you, too," Draco sighed. He kissed Harry softly and settled against his warm chest. "Happy to be back."
Harry took the tray and their plates, politely offering to wash them. Draco watched him go, eyes locked on that firm arse, still only covered by a thin layer of fabric. Yes, green was
"I know," Harry whispers, squeezing him tight. "I know I said I needed time alone tonight, but I changed my mind. Would you...would you come with me?"
, it's completely fine. You know what? While we're at it, let's just let every single werewolf in Europe throw themselves at you. No problem. It's
Tentatively, the wolf stepped forward, putting all of his weight on his left paw. He lifted it and set it back down again, before taking another step.
Finally dressed, he went through the Floo right on time and found himself, as expected, back in Harry's sitting room.
Maybe there was hope of being on friendly terms with Weasley after all, as strange an idea as that was.
Potter is standing next to a pretty young woman, clearly at the end of a date and on their way out. He smiles and introduces her to them as a ‘friend.’
Ron, at least, not anymore. They had been in an uneasy truce since he became friends with Hermione while she and Ron were dating. Draco just didn't think they would ever be friends. They were too different, and there was just too much history and mutual dislike there.
"I heard you'd fired Davis," Draco traces a hand down the center of Harry's chest. "You didn't have to do that."
"Of course not," Harry grins. "Come on. There we go." He hauls Draco to his feet, letting him lean heavily against him.
She opened it and Draco caught sight of a familiar, untidy scrawl. Just one sentence. He was too far away to read it, but he knew the handwriting.
Draco gave him a faint smile. "No one will recognize you looking like that, just make sure it stays on."
“Teddy likes most people,” Harry smiles and leans over to nudge Draco’s shoulder with his own. “If you like him, Teddy probably will, too.”
Draco filled another plate of food for himself, avoiding the burnt toast entirely, and made his way back to their bed, where they ate in companionable silence.
He settled Draco under it on the sofa, then busied himself in the kitchen making an enormous cup of hot cocoa. Mug in hand, he made his way back to the sitting room. Draco accepted it gratefully, immediately putting the cup to his lips and taking a sip.
Draco took a deep breath and released it slowly. "It's alright. I'm just—I'm on edge. I'm going to go out for a bit."
Hermione and Ron went back down the stairs and through the Floo to their own house, where she immediately held her hand out and demanded her galleon.
A pleasant shiver still runs down Draco’s spine at the tacit promise in the words. “I’ll send her flowers, then. Or chocolates.”
"I feel stronger, but I haven't experimented with that at all. And it's harder to sit still for long periods of time. I went to Diagon Alley today because I thought I'd go mad if I spent one more minute alone in my flat trying to sit still, even though I wasn't ready for anyone to see me yet."
"It was not sanctioned by the French Minister for Magic, and it was quickly repealed by the country's Ministry, but the damage had been done. The careful peace we had sought for over a hundred years was broken, and we were hunted. This is the last of our pack. Last year we were over a hundred strong, now cut down to less than twenty."
“I know, Ted,” Draco puts an arm around him and gives him a squeeze, pulling away before Teddy has time to object to the physical affection. “I know. And you don’t have to give up just yet, just don’t let this ruin your friendship with Victoire, alright? You’ll regret that more than anything else.”
"I will, alright? Just don't rush me." Draco puts his hands up defensively. "This is still nerve-wracking! He still might not—"
"Honestly, Ronald. You scared the baby." Hermione took the wailing child from him and started gently rocking and shushing her to calm her down.
"Other than checking on my son's injured fiancé?" She smiled. "I thought we should start talking about your wedding."
She threw her arms around him. "I'm so happy for you, Draco! Did you—has anything happened while you and Harry have been...?"
he tastes and feels just as good as I remember. His hands drop to my waist, and my hands slide up to cup his face and trace his sharp cheekbones and I want to kiss him forever.
He brought a hand up to rest on Harry's chest, and Harry covered it with his own, interlacing their fingers.
shown up for quidditch three days later, but Draco hadn't been too worried at the time, he'd figured Harry was still working his Auror case and wasn't able to contact him.
"I was overjoyed when we found each other after we both turned, thrilled to have a friend with me through the painful journey. We found and joined Fenrir's pack together. But I still couldn't love Lorcan, and I fell for Fenrir almost immediately, much to Lorcan's fury. Now he wants to punish me for it. Punish my son for it. My little boy. I don't know what to do, Harry. I'm afraid...I'll have to bond with him just to keep Thomas safe."
"I'm serious! You let me pet you, and scratch behind your ears, and after I healed your broken leg you slobbered all over my face. Come to think of it, I might like you better as a wolf."
Looking around, Harry realized he knew all their names instinctively, somehow, faces matching the voices he'd been hearing for over a month now. He greeted each of them in turn.
Harry laughed again, then leaned forward to kiss him. "If being a dick was a punishable offense, I'd lock him up this very second. Unfortunately, it's not."
“I haven’t yet,” Harry takes a sip of mulled mead and glances over at Draco. “I’d like to, though. Draco blushes every time anyone asks about him. Look.”
Draco reached out, fingers hovering over the discolored and damaged skin. He hesitated, looking up into Harry's face. "May I touch you?"
Draco jumps when the door to the back of the shop opens, a belated knock letting him know Harry has arrived.
A few weeks later, all communication with Draco had been cut off, and Harry had been a different person from that point forward, his fear and anger at the situation eating at him from the inside out.
He leaned down for a salty kiss, running his hands over Harry's chest, then down to his flies. Draco knew how close to the edge he was, and how he wanted this first round to go if Harry wouldn't specify. He tugged Harry's trousers open and yanked his pants down just enough to free his cock. Harry clenched his hands in the sheets and arched off the bed when Draco took him into his skilled mouth. It wasn't long before he was coming down his throat with a cry that was half relief, half pleasure.
Draco Apparates from the front porch. He showers and changes into pyjamas before gratefully crawling into his bed and burying his face in his pillow.
But Harry hasn’t said anything about not being able to come this evening yet, and Draco is starting to hope he might actually show up. If he doesn’t, there’s only one more week before it’ll be his turn with Teddy, and Harry will
"—just saying. He tries to hide it, but he hasn't been himself lately. I feel bad for him. That's all."
The voice came from his left, and Harry looked up, surprised. His glamour must have slipped when he'd lost focus. "Yes?"
As much as Draco had suspected them of doing this, he’s still slightly shocked that he's actually caught them out.
“Romania?” The one word, spoken in a barely-audible, strained voice, snaps me back. He looks like he might cry again, and it takes me a second to realize why. Charlie.
Harry faced Laith and Mia-Rose next, reaching out to touch Laith's shoulder. "Laith," he said softly. "I'm so sorry about Mathias."
Draco shows him out, leaning against the door and taking a deep, steadying breath before going in search of Teddy, still playing happily in his room upstairs.
"I'm telling your Healer about this," Draco muttered mutinously a few minutes later, suppressing another low moan as Harry kissed him and rolled his hips against him.
"So did you," Harry gasped, tearing at Draco's belt and his fly until his trousers dropped, "if you knew what those bloody trousers do to me, the way they hug your perfect arse...it's indecent, honestly."
"I appreciate the sentiment, but I couldn't live with myself if I hurt you. I don't want you anywhere near this house tonight. Apparate home this afternoon. You can come back in the morning when it's safe. Please, Draco. Promise me."
"Stay with me. I...I can't risk hurting you, even if it was by accident. I couldn't live with myself if I...please. Promise me. Next time you'll just go home. Please. I'll be okay."
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” Draco continues quickly before Harry can say anything. “It’s not my place to judge who you date, and I didn’t mean to make you feel like—”
“Not if you don’t want it to be,” Harry smiles against his skin, pulling back to look at him. “I’ve just missed you, and you smell
Glancing up and down the aisle of books to make sure they were alone, Draco drew back his hood and watched Potter's reaction with interest. His eyes widened and he gasped softly, but it was a surprisingly mild reaction, considering.
“We were just about to get lunch before we finish the rest of Teddy’s Hogwarts shopping,” Harry says awkwardly, shooting a bewildered look at Teddy. “Why don’t you join us?”
that he is (Ron’s words, although Draco wholeheartedly agrees with the sentiment), instinctively jumped in front of the idiot and took the Curse himself. It sliced him open, right through his side. At this point, Draco notices the amount of blood on Ron’s crimson robes and visibly cringes.
Wondering who could possibly be knocking at this hour, he makes his way downstairs and opens the door to stare blankly at Harry, who hasn’t actually knocked on his front door in years.
Draco shoved Harry against the wall and attacked his mouth, writhing against him as if he could barely contain himself.
"How are your Healing Spells?" Ron asked as he knelt beside him. "They teach us the basics in Auror training, but this looks bad."
," I drawl. Another perfect moment from my memories. Not unlike tonight...Is it still night? Or early morning? I'm not sure.
“I can understand that,” she says softly, and Draco knows that she does. Ginny lays her head on his shoulder, wrapping an arm around him.
Draco clambers through the portrait hole, leaving a blustering Sir Cadogan to shout after him as the portrait swings closed, and looks around. "Harry?"
“Thank you for the kind offer, but we can’t stay,” Draco says politely, and Harry shoots him a grateful look.
“Accidental magic-resistant antlers,” Draco laughs and shakes his head. “Merlin, having more than one magical child must be an absolute
and go talk to that hot guy who has been staring at you all night, or I’ll hit you with a Bat-Bogey Hex.”
The next morning, Healer Gordon watched with her arms folded as Harry swung his legs over the side of the bed and attempted to stand. He was successful for a few seconds, but his injured leg gave out and he caught himself on the edge of the bed, carefully putting all his weight on his other leg. He cursed and flushed crimson.
"Watch me," Draco hissed, "you're clearly not competent enough to help him, so I'm going to find someone who can."
She finally glanced up from her book. "Oh, yes. I was planning on staying for a few hours this morning anyway. I don't need to be at work until one."
“So Harry,” Narcissa draws Draco’s attention back to the conversation. Teddy has fallen asleep on the sofa with his head in her lap, stuffed full of good food and a full day of Christmas cheer. “Have

of me. For being with you! As if that's a bad thing. As if me agreeing to marry the Greengrass girl right after the War would have somehow made me
Draco loved Harry's bedroom. He didn't know what it had looked like before, but Harry had transformed the Master Bedroom of the old house into a place that was simultaneously cozy and bright. The walls were a soft, cream color. The floors throughout the house were all the original hardwood, but restored and stained a deep, chocolate brown.
"I didn't know what you liked," Harry said, looking embarrassed at the sheer volume of food, "so I got...options."
"Hello!" Ron's freckled face came into view. He kissed a bewildered looking Hermione. "Where have you two been, then?"
Harry spent the rest of the day at Wolf's Hollow. He could feel the eyes of Kasper and Lorcan on him most of the time, but he purposely ignored them.
...leaders than you, I'm afraid. The full moon tends to make it worse. Also, your magical abilities with and without a wand are widely known. And feared by many...anyone with half a brain, I imagine," she added with a little smile.
Draco knelt and took the young boy's hands, trying to explain. "Ron and I will be back soon. Hermione and Jenkins will take care of you, okay?"
“Not nearly,” she laughs, smiling over at Draco. “But they must have answered a million questions. It’s overwhelming, but everything Draco and Teddy told us is so exciting. And going to that Alley place they mentioned—”
Draco shrugs, still not looking at him, and Harry snaps. He takes him by the shoulders and forces him to meet his blazing expression. "I
He looks to Ron for support, but he should have known he would find none there. Ron folds his arms and glares from beside the door, shaking his head.
She disappears upstairs, and Draco suddenly feels strangely discomfited being alone with Harry, even though they’re alone together all the time. Not usually with a strangely-charged atmosphere like this, though.
notice. Ginny drags Draco outside. “What happened? Why is Harry being so weird? Did you talk to him?”
"I believe our first order of business is to hold a funeral to honor Mathias," he said, and Nadine nodded her approval. "After that, we'll deal with the rest."
