“There is a bit of it in here, helps with the soothing,” Draco murmured quietly.
He'd got a bit distracted. However fucking Draco was something Harry knew how to do. It was starting to become a habit, actually.
Had he any sense left, Harry might’ve marvelled at the sheer amount of it all that stained their trousers and covered what little skin he had managed to expose—a few arches of hips, stomachs, and overstimulated erections. It was a bit stifling in the heat between them not to be completely naked, the scent of sex and sweat was heavy in the air, but neither of them had the patience to untangle long enough to bother.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry caught him lightly by the shoulders. “Steady there.”
The rest of their lunch went relatively without incident. Draco corrected a few minor etiquette violations but didn’t pick apart every move he made as Harry’d feared he might.
“You—what?” Harry was a bit flabbergasted.
“Well Potter, how else would you care to celebrate tonight?”
When they peeked into the tent to check on his success or failure, it became clear that perhaps the charm was not as tricky for him to pick up as they had originally thought.
“Alright there Harry?” Savage inquired from the cubicle just behind his own.
“I’m proposing we have breakfast first…and maybe we could also fit in a really quick fuck,” he negotiated.
Harry’s cock twitched dangerously close, he caught a tight groan in the back of his throat, but he fucked as hard as he could, for as long as he could, even after Draco went face down and arse up on the bed, shuddering into another profound climax. He kept on until Draco begged him to come, and it was too hot to hold it off any longer—thrusting unsteadily, until the scorching impact of his own orgasm gradually subsided.
“I know you’ve always enjoyed breaking the rules, but have I mentioned that deliberately violating the Secrecy Statutes, whilst also being in the middle of your Auror training takes spunk?”
Harry hadn’t thought that through at all.
He spent Friday afternoon in Muggle London clearing Dementors, and that night suffered through a wickedly bad dream reliving the Battle of Hogwarts. The shock of it woke him far too early Saturday morning, and only made him more certain than ever that the wraiths were responsible for the ferocity of his nightmares.
The glow of antlers made it momentarily difficult to see before his stag coalesced enough to charge at the threatening swarm, bursting a bright glow through the alley, outshining the otherwise dull afternoon light.
But his world was narrowing in on him, Harry could feel the impending heat tensing, deeper than he could control. “Fu-
Draco’s shirt was left draped over the iron railing of the spiral staircase leading up toward his bedroom, where Harry had arched him back on the railing while he worked Draco’s buttons open by hand, biting gently down his chest with each unfastening.
“I’ve created the recipe for this myself,” Malfoy was saying casually. “It’s quite an interesting mix.”
Malfoy took his time selecting another drink from the depleting tray on the table before them, while Harry waited rather impatiently for an answer.
Draco barely glanced up from his book, though he was smirking rather wickedly.
He was having an annoyingly hard time with it all—and would be lying to say that he didn’t miss the sound of Draco moaning or the spicy coconut smell that always lingered in his hair, no matter how sweaty it got.
—can you—turn around?”
“Oh, I know you, of course. I’ve read all about you—” She cut herself off, large blue eyes shifting uncertainly between them. “Wait a minute, aren’t you two meant to have this massive rivalry of epic proportions? What happened?”
Harry snorted. “What a surprise, a bunch of spoiled Purebloods have no taste.”
Draco’s eyebrow arched into a wry look. “Probably…so long as no one else disrupts my work with their ridiculous bouts of jealousy.”
“Those will be over by the desk. You can touch them.”
“I know you know the best spot by now. Find it,” Draco challenged.
As a throng of wedding guests milled about in their gowns and dress robes, droning with the sound of so many quiet conversations happening at once, a quartet of stringed instruments tucked into the far corner of the room bowed themselves. Wandering closer, Harry thought it was a clever bit of magic, but the sleepy melodies the spells produced were doing naught to liven the mood of the room. He watched them play for a while, until a crowd of people began to gather and whisper not too far away. Harry was certain he’d heard his own name, and decided it was time to move on.
“Malfoy isn’t out there in the streets with you, is he? Working with Muggles and all?”
He was a bit fear-shocked, and a little bewildered, but Harry had to shelve his questions to assure they were both alright.
Yet when he gave in to the impulse to consider things honestly, Harry inevitably reached a point where the urge to break things was a little overwhelming. He felt a bit trapped.
Frowning, Draco turned the notebook completely upside down before righting it again.
Harry had a lot to get done before Wednesday, but a bit of flying wouldn’t take all night, and he hadn’t seen the familiar freckled face since his birthday gathering—a night so chaotic and full of firewhisky he only barely recalled speaking with him. He couldn’t bring himself to beg off this time, so he accepted.
Harry was starting to think he might’ve got turned around, or perhaps that he only imagined seeing Malfoy in the first place. He was seeing him so often in his dreams now, perhaps it stood to reason he might start seeing him whilst he was awake too.
Although Harry supposed she would be Renna Lester now, having just married a former Slytherin several years her senior called Lester whom Harry didn’t know at all. He had barely spoken to Renna before that day, though he recognised a fair number of their guests.
“Malfoy.” Harry wasn’t in the mood for unnecessary insults just then, especially not at the expense of the dead. “Anyway, not exactly. Sirius told me about the whole thing long before Teddy—er, came about.”
She and Ginny exchanged another look, leaving Harry once again very suspicious of what was being said.
—don’t stop.”
hurt, but it hadn’t yet, and undeniably he wanted Draco badly enough he was willing to take the risk.
Just as he remembered, the floor was so reflective it looked as though you could fall right through to the other side. Harry was able to
“Who isn’t?”
Harry’s timing probably could have been better, but—what with Draco slouched back like he was on the settee, his shirt pulled tighter over his abs and his legs leisurely parted… he was very distracting even when he wasn’t trying to be.
Draco’s brow took on a slight furrow, as if the matter genuinely troubled him. “Not for now. Tomorrow night, if we’ve finished absolutely everything else and we’ve still time to spare, then we might double back to them. For now, we’ll keep on as we’ve been—”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Dunno. Fish?”
Someone was shaking him awake, and despite being soundly asleep it didn’t take Harry long to sort out who.
“You’re serious?”
Malfoy held the concoction up to the floating lights suspended above them before taking a sip himself.
Harry swallowed down the burning guilt that churned inside of him and took a steadying breath.
He nearly mentioned that Ginny would be back next week, that Bill and Fleur would be visiting as well, and apparently had big news to share with everyone.
“I suppose that one will do. In the morning we’ll need to pack everything up and shrink it all down as carefully as possible, I doubt we’ll have the energy for it tonight.”
“Through the gate there, just up the street. If we’re fast we might avoid getting completely sodden.”
Harry chewed his lip uncertainly. He hadn’t been sure if he should tell Draco or not—but it was out now. He didn’t get to see Draco’s reaction though, because the blond man rose from the settee, and appeared to have a sudden pressing need to examine the shelves behind his desk like he’d never seen them before.
“I should go. I’ve got work tomorrow.”
“Thanks,” he said softly.
“That is what enchantments are for, Potter.”
“Harry…we were speaking with Ginny earlier and—Ron and I would like to speak to you soon. Not tonight obviously, he’s completely cabbaged. But soon.”
Draco went suddenly very frowning and tense. “I see.”
“I don’t think I’m ready to let you leave yet.”
Draco dropped his trousers, and left them just outside the bathroom door. He shrugged off his shirt next, before he looked back to check.
"Not to mention we’ve already saved them once, or did you forget the Dark Lord wanted to use them all for a slave army?"
“I might be a little out of practice,” Harry confessed. “I haven’t been up here since Ginny was preparing for the League Cup, and that was in April.”
Anymore, Harry knew the longer he waited to admit what he was doing, the more tangled his absurd web would become. Yet he could not bring himself to be honest with her, or anyone else. It was so much easier to pretend like everything was normal…except for the bit where he was constantly thinking about Draco Malfoy.
“Draco…” Harry’s breath caught with feverish anticipation as the pointed tip of Draco’s nose traced the soft line of hair beneath his navel, trailing down into Harry’s dark curls.
Better late than never! Thank you all very much for reading and for the feedback. Hopefully it's worth the wait. Enjoy!
Malfoy scoffed softly. “My invitation here was a formality. In fact, I’m not sure they really expected me to come, or noticed that I have.”
Some of Harry’s recent research on the formation of the Statute of Secrecy had illuminated that at one point in their history, the Malfoys were quite deeply entwined with the Muggle aristocracy in England and France. In light of their more recent defections, and their fondness for enchanted Muggle artifacts, Harry couldn’t help wondering what all Draco knew about the Muggle world that he never let on.
He guided Draco down a long hall toward one of several small rooms with chairs and tables that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had at their disposal. They were used mostly for questioning, witnesses and suspects alike. It only occurred to Harry as they walked in that Draco might well have been in one of them before—at least once.
“I’m going to fuck you until you come so many times the bed will never be clean,” he murmured. It was very ambitious, but Harry would surely try.
“It’s a mild hallucinogen, with a large punch of bliss inducers, some inhibition inhibitor… and a hint of cinnamon.” He looked very proud.
“Interesting,” Draco drawled deviously. “Is that an invitation?”
“Where?” he asked between nips to Harry’s lips.
His cock sprung up all too quickly when pale thighs spanned over it, the eager tip of Draco’s nudging at firming stiffness. They teased each other that way, brushing and bumping lips and cocks, a challenge in the sultry anticipation as neither of them committed to any real pressure.
“Exchange of what?”
They were heading back out of the kitchen now, and Draco veered close enough to bump their shoulders.
Draco whined pleasure at each, arching through pain and desire the more persistently he smacked. Harry couldn’t help being entirely enthralled by exactly how well he reacted, every heated sound following the firm bounce under his palm. With each strike Draco squirmed, and Harry's cock throbbed, prodding demandingly up against Draco's front—surely why Harry kept on so long.
Harry laughed. “But it’s fun.”
“It’s been splendid chatting and all, but we’ve quite a lot of work left to do. I’m sure you understand.”
Harry thought it was a little ridiculous they had to stagger their showers in order to manage getting properly washed up—but then again, he knew the reason he wanted Draco in the shower with him had absolutely nothing to do with anything clean.
“It’s too fiddly mate, and it takes too bloody long.”
And before they finally got around to the washing bit of their shower. Which they got over with pretty quickly, as the water had started to go cold—one more annoying little quirk of Harry’s house.
Settling over him he could feel every gasp and shudder, pushing his cock steadily deeper, until his hips were flush to Draco’s arse.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“With my wand or my cock?” Harry teased.
“I hadn’t noticed,” he said a little unevenly.
“Wha-what business?”
, Potter? You might’ve let me explain before you started hurling about fucking insults.”
“Perhaps I need a closer look,” Harry suggested. “I haven’t had my mouth all over yours yet.”
Draco let out a lovely noise of protest, complaining breathlessly. “What the fuck?”
you, Potter?”
Harry frowned at the tumbler. “Taste’s interesting enough—but for all that, it would need to be fucking bottomless. Even then it’s too much. That’s completely daft.”
“Preferable to his telling Pansy, which is what he wanted to do.”
“Then we mustn’t get caught. I know you know how to sneak around; you were always better at it than I was.”
“I’ll be sure to make note of that in the report I’m not writing,” Harry added absently.
Enjoy!
“… It sounds awfully complicated, and a lot more work for you.”
He’d forgotten all about the painting.
“Imagine killing one of the most powerful wizards in living memory, and what do you receive for your troubles? A cubicle.”
“Oh, Merlin’s fucking cock, if you don’t put something inside me soon—”
“You want it?” he asked breathlessly, lust-shadowed green landing intently on silver in their reflection once more.
“You weren’t lying.”
“We’ve done nothing but drink and talk about depressing nonsense for an hour or more. What sort of party has long, mandatory stretches of boredom? Come on. Show me around all the places Father never let me explore.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Well, that’s unfortunate,” Malfoy drawled, sounding more pleased than disappointed that he hadn’t got it on the first try. “My turn.”
“Lie down, appreciate the ride—it should wear off in a few hours.”
Draco hummed dispassionately at Harry’s thanks and took a sip of tea before he went on. “I should be getting back to the Manor soon.”
“Let’s consider it this way. What are you thinking of when you cast the spell?”
. I can’t—I—need—” Malfoy broke into yet another frustrated noise.
Completely unaware of the context, Draco moaned and rocked his hips up into Harry’s stroking.
Draco considered him a moment before he seemed to let his guard down, critical silver surveying the mess of Harry’s sitting room with a silently judging eyebrow arch.
“I must be getting tired,” Ron excused. “Maybe it’s time we pack it in.”
But there were more pressing matters now.
Ginny finally even talked him into a dance, in spite of his being still completely hopeless at it. He thought she had looked particularly beautiful then, flushed and breathless from laughter and dancing, and seeming not to mind too terribly that Harry found it difficult to avoid trodding on her feet.
Clearing his throat and sipping his tea, Draco recovered with predictable grace, but Harry could see his ears clear as day in the afternoon sun.
“Not just now, I don’t think.”
What was he going to do when Ginny got back from her training in a couple weeks?
“We might consider a Taboo enchantment. I know, Potter—hear me out first—of a very different sort than the one keeping everyone ‘You-Know-Who’ing for years. We could, theoretically, adapt it to be more limited. It might save us the pressing problem of secrecy on the Muggle end of things.”
“Oh.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry snorted. He wished often for the time to faff, but it escaped him lately.
…I need—”
“By the way, how did you end up getting the Taboo to do what we needed?” he queried, as Draco was just finishing with that layer of the spells.
“If you say so.”
Harry was a bit shocked at the idea, but his cock was quite interested—or tried to be. “No, I—yeah. It’s the last door there.”
“Harder,” Draco pleaded tightly, a loud moan stuttering in Harry’s rhythm when he enthusiastically complied.
“And we will…after I’ve suitably demonstrated my gratitude for lunch.”
“I’m counting on it.”
It was strange, knowing he ought to have misgivings, and knowing no part of this plan would be easy, Harry could not help feeling absurdly excited at even the potential to be doing something meaningful again. He should’ve been at least a little concerned of the consequences, but he simply wasn’t.
With his doubts still warring his desires over Draco, their hard work finally gaining ground, and Quidditch Season just on the horizon, how long can Harry's better judgement hold out?
“Ran into Malfoy,” he muttered in reply, focused now on getting his feet to go one after the other, as they were meant to.
Following his gaze, Malfoy tensed noticeably before seeming to regain his composure. He even twisted his forearm into the glowing blue light of the prophecy shelves.
“Sorry,” Harry chimed, though he did not sound it.
but—sorry, I mean to say—” Cassie took a deep breath. “How can I help? What sort of information are you after here?”
Cassie looked a bit caught off guard.
“Would we have to enchant them all ourselves—couldn’t we buy a few?”
“Yes, well—it’s quite sexy, you know…all that hissing.” Draco had gone a bit defensive. Harry could see his ears going lightly pink.
“Alright?” Harry breathed, nipping at the shell of his ear.
“I think you’re overloading them, Potter. Perhaps we ought to try you on something with a bit more stretch to it first—something more substantial, less prone to breaking. Also, you’ll need to use your instincts; you’ve got to stretch the inside, not explode it.”
“You’re strange, Malfoy.”
“Fine…” He seemed to be struggling to keep his voice low and even. “Never better.”
“That’ll do well then.”
“I can’t tell, Malfoy…are you sure you’re getting the syllables right?”
“That’s my bedroom, Potter.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It took him a few bleary seconds to comprehend the words coming at him. “Erm. Floo? I can Floo.”
“Then I’ll have to find someone who understands it better,” he decided. “S’pose I could start asking around at some of the shelters we keep clearing.”
your parents? I’m not going to turn a corner and be hexed for surprising your father at tea or something?”
He’d seen Draco unconscious before, by Harry’s own doing even, but never sleeping like this—his face entirely relaxed and unguarded, his lips ever so slightly parted, and a furrow occasionally passing over his brow as he slept. The sight of him completely at rest was mesmerising, and it took Harry a moment to shake himself into reality and acknowledge that he should perhaps not be standing there transfixed should Draco happen to wake up—it was a bit creepy.
It turned out to be all too easy for Harry to do as he said—so
He only barely resisted leaving without him. When Draco eventually seemed satisfied that he’d made him wait long enough, they Apparated to London.
“Coming, Potter?”
“Have you just…?”
He thought he saw a flash of disappointment on normally cool features.
Which didn’t mean Harry wasn’t compelled to check
Harry moaned tightly. His hips stuttered unsteadily. “Mm’so
“Wha’s that?”
Expelling a shaking breath behind him, Draco started stroking himself at an increasingly feverish pace. Harry felt the twitch of him in quickening prods over his arse, and with a deep moan his eyes fell closed against the bolts of pleasure sparking straight to his cock with every touch.
“I may be going mad,” Harry said conversationally circling around when the cluster started pecking too close to his shoes again.
He wasn’t too concerned about it, given the nature of being Harry Potter his house was pretty well warded—however it was a reminder why they had gone out there in the first place. Before he started the tea Harry popped quickly out to the garden to gather some mint and finally closed the door behind him. He located his wand where he’d left it by his chair in the sitting room, and began charming together a small tray with a kettle of tea, two cups and, as an afterthought, he summoned a jar of honey out of the cupboard.
“What are you—?”
you love getting fucked, don’t you?”
People were staring, and Harry beat a hasty retreat before anyone else stopped him for a chat.
Also, in case anyone is interested, here's my
“You are properly sloshed.”
Frustrated, Harry kicked at his old trunk, too hard, and his foot immediately radiated pain.
“I’m sorry my hair is so offensive Malfoy,” Harry shot back wryly.
If Harry didn’t know any better, he could almost imagine that Draco had actually cared.
Ginny had been seated just behind them, but when the ceremonies broke for lunch, Harry met her at the edge of the lake.
Bewildered grey stared at him for a beat. “Oh. Right.”
“Harry
Then Harry took the Floo home, and spent the rest of his Sunday looking through the book on patterns Draco insisted he familiarise himself with.
Draco sat up a bit to catch at Harry’s cock with slippery fingers and tug, covering it and using it to pull him closer at the same time.
“Thanks.”
“Malfoy.”
“It’s…coming—along.”
.” He’d managed to completely forget about their meeting.
“Not just now…but I could do with a shower. What do you think?”
Harry hadn’t fully understood the reasoning behind the tactic, and Ron looked similarly confused, although that might have also been Harry’s piss poor excuse for an explanation.
“Do it again,” he whispered, hips stuttering a bit in their rock.
Harry hesitated before his next offer.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry looked incredulous. “Your peacocks get lonely?”
Harry knew that the evening part was meant to be something of a release from the pain of remembering, but he found himself dreading it as well—all the stories, questions, the stares—just the trauma of it all. He didn’t want to go through it again, last year had been hard enough.
“Not if we want any control over the security enchantments or the secrecy. Essentially, we’ll need to consider a less...portable approach.”
“We can’t make them all silk, it would take ages.”
cult leader.”
He flipped over onto his back, and Draco stretched out close beside him, a slight warmth touching only barely, the hush of his voice very close to Harry’s ear.
And how many saucy (likely false) rumours had this woman heard about him?
It took Harry several beats leaning against the lift’s wall as it hurtled unpredictably before everything stopped spinning, and only then did it fully occur to him where Malfoy had just taken them.
“Are you alright? Where have you been?” Ginny peppered.
“None of these enchantments restrict access outright—coming or going—the biggest hurdle here is finding the right figures for the magic to assess who’s really in need, versus who might have intent to cause harm—well, I’ll circle back to that, but it’s not an easy thing to sort—even Hogwarts hasn’t got perfect security.”
“Harry! Sorry mate, people’ve been asking me that since we got here. She’s back at the flat—and well into a stack of books nearly hitting the rafters last I checked.” Ron shook his head hopelessly.
It certainly swelled Harry’s ego a bit, and that wasn’t the only thing it swelled either.
“I said you had a fuckable arse.”
“All finished then? We’re losing time, Potter.”
“Think you might like to stick around a bit longer?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Ginny was leaving the next day—the start of a four-week stretch of pre-season training with the Harpies.
. Potter, I didn’t mean—”
“Potter.” Draco was trying to warn him off, but it wasn’t going to work.
“Being a prat.”
“Er. Yeah, might be. Thanks.”
He knew all of these questions were coming, and even so, Harry had to swallow around a lump in his throat before he could speak.
“Sounds challenging.”
“I haven’t found a single spell that might deter magic users, let alone one with specific clauses on who to deter. It would take only one to report us, and the Ministry, the ICW, they could come down on the whole thing and bollocks the entire plan.”
They kissed again, and Harry groaned low as Draco’s tongue teased and flicked repeatedly into his mouth to play against his own.
“Fine. Fuck you then.”
Harry groaned. He wasn’t sure his stamina would hold out but he would certainly give it his best effort. This had been all he could think about for an hour or more—maybe even all month, if he was being entirely honest with himself—and he was actually going to get what he wanted for his birthday. His cock was certainly excited by the prospect.
Draco came sudden and hard, suppressing a cry against Harry’s lips. Harry felt the heat of his release soaking through to wet a bit of his own swollen cock with a faint slickness.
The conversation had taken such a deep turn so quickly that he was happy for a change of subject, even at his own expense.
Harry shot him a rather wicked grin. “We’re paying a visit to your library anyway, aren’t we?”
Harry guided him deeper into the narrow room, ignoring more strange tugs of memories and dreams to focus on getting them to the other side without incident. Everything around them ticked loudly, at off times, and Harry didn’t know how anyone could stand to work in the room for any prolonged period of time without going completely mad. On the other hand, it was good cover on the off-chance anyone was around to notice them passing through.
When Harry felt like he could move again without bursting, he pinned Draco flush to the ladder, and Draco’s cock twitched between them as Harry thrust into him deep again, seeking out a pleasure centre to overwhelm.
“Guess not.” Harry hid a smile with a properly long swallow. Licking at his lips to chase the ensuing smoothness, he caught the downward flick of Draco’s eyes to watch—which was all the excuse he really needed. “Fancy a snog?”
“Gin’s in Holyhead… it’s just me here today.”
“So yeah, we’ve planned to do most of the setting up tomorrow—er, if the weather cooperates,” Harry concluded. “But it’d be really helpful to have your input moving forward.”
“Love you, too.”
. The ICW—”
He wiggled his hips pointedly. Harry bit back a moan.
“Your lips look a bit...” Harry mused when some part of his brain wandered back to reality.
As impatient as they both were to get him inside, once he had him there Draco rode him superbly slowly.
When he attached his mouth to Harry’s nipple, tonguing over it repeatedly, Harry arched under him with a breathless gasp—surging with a heat which only grew more pointed when Draco caught the tiny peak between his teeth.
“Malfoy, if I come out of here with my hair lying flat, they’ll really suspect something’s off.”
He wasn’t around for Harry to thank him, but even if he were Draco wouldn’t’ve accepted his thanks anyway—not verbally, at any rate.
Unfortunately, that strategy really only worked so long as he was awake. Malfoy managed to haunt him in his dreams as well, and Harry found himself more than once waking in the middle of the night in a new kind of sweat—not from fear as he was so accustomed, but rather painfully hard and a little desperate. Those sorts of dreams were beginning to very seriously disrupt his sleep, thrown in as they were with his ever-present nightmares. They were particularly awkward on nights when Ginny was home, asleep in oblivious peace beside him.
“No, I—I mean—yes. Right. We should. Not tell anyone, I mean.”
As on the night of Harry’s birthday, he sounded peevish and sleepy, and it was oddly attractive. Draco considered him a moment longer before he huffed a small sigh.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Harry’s breaking the Secrecy Statutes…” Hermione trailed off to frown at him again. “—with Malfoy? Good heavens, are you sure you can trust someone like
Watching the break of desire on Draco’s face, Harry thought this could easily become his new favourite thing to do together, and all thanks to the Malfoys' ostentatious ballroom.
“How’s that whole business with Malfoy coming along?”
Thankfully, once again, all the ticking and the sparkling in the room made good cover, and Harry was fairly certain they had not been spotted by anyone. Surely they would’ve been stopped if they had.
“I’m sure he’ll get over it.”
Eventually he healed his lips, and had to do his cock too, but then he was eager to go all over again. He’d offered to heal Draco’s arse, even just a little, but Draco waved him off once more.
“It’s very old, it’s got a mind of its own sometimes.” He tugged at Harry’s sleeve. “Come on. Library’s this way.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Being this close, all sorts of things might’ve set off their hormones, but instead they only stood together for several silently serene seconds.
“I never hated you, I didn’t trust you. You were an annoying hateful little twat, and you didn’t make it easy to—”
Writhing under him, Draco murmured his next in deliciously lust-low tones, with no small amount of smugness. “You know exactly how to fuck me now, don’t you?”
“How fast do you think I could make you come?” Harry murmured, pressing his cock’s obvious interest to Draco’s through thin layers of cotton and silk.
Harry pulled Draco into a narrow alley for them to Disapparate.
A quick time spell revealed he had missed lunch, the afternoon ceremonies, tea, and nearly two hours of the ensuing merriment. He needed to find his friends, before someone sent out a search party.
“You’re lucky I don’t have the energy to kiss you right now.”
“I should stay with them all a while longer—they’re molting, now summer’s ending. I take it you can find your way back to the library alone?”
“…Concerned?”
“You’ve no room to talk, Potter.”
,” he spat irritably.
“Fuck it,” Draco panted. “Go on.”
“Follow me.”
“Am I that bad at kissing?” Draco scoffed at him.
They were both moaning—tense with an all-consuming desire, and Draco kissed him back, nudging open Harry’s lips with his tongue and teasing into his mouth—a perfect distraction as Harry started fucking him very carefully—so as to stop himself from coming before they had even really started.
He was trusting Draco enough to let him do this—and the firewhisky helped, but that didn’t make him any less nervous. He let out a series of quietly shocked gasps when Draco’s touch slid soft over his arse with a painstaking sort of admiration, parting him to press a kiss over the tight entrance hidden there.
Disoriented, he only noticed Draco’s legs sliding off his arms when they coiled over his arse instead. Draco caught him at the nape of the neck and pulled him down to kiss almost gently.
“Does it really matter?” he drawled lazily.
Harry shot him a warning look and Draco responded with a defiant arch to his eyebrow this time.
Where Harry made tea, every morning. He could never unsee this.
“We’ll meet you down there, Ginny,” Hermione said as she and Ron made their escape.
“We’ll almost need her if this is going to go anywhere practical,” Harry continued.
He owled Draco that night when he returned home.
“None of that now. We'll need to stay focused.”
“Thanks.” Harry was sure he would forget it all shortly.
Draco had prepared tea, biscuits and sandwiches included, on one of the library’s narrow tables. Harry was already making himself a cup, and selecting a sandwich.
Harry was about as enthusiastic about this year’s ball as last, nevertheless December 22
Really, the last thing he wanted to talk to her about was Draco, who was at the heart of all Harry’s worst secrets from her. Knowing he needed to have the conversation didn’t make him any more inclined to start it.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
and was expected by most of the Wizarding World, and his closest friends, to marry her at some point in the next year or two.
Probably, he had asked for that.
Harry was not impressed.
“Then stop talking and eat.”
“My parents have retired to France on a semi-permanent basis. Generally, they only return for special occasions. The Manor officially answers to me now.”
He pressed closer, trapping Draco between himself and the edge of the desk, and Draco thrust against him with another quiet moan. Harry indulged himself biting rosy marks into the curve of Draco’s shoulder, working the very last bit of fabric off of him.
Hermione looked rather proud of him for his use of ‘propagating’, Ron still appeared very confused, though that might’ve been his attempts to sort out how Malfoy could possibly be involved. Hermione was the one who gave voice to that brewing question.
Harry huffed. “Not all of us grew up taking calligraphy lessons, Malfoy.”
“Thanks… for last night.”
“I think you like that I can’t stop looking at you. You pretend you don’t notice sometimes, but you always do.”
“From the stars?” Harry slurred a bit, and when he tried to tip back to look, the world went slightly sideways, and only the very real danger of falling into Malfoy’s lap kept him upright.
It took effort for them to separate long enough.
As Harry watched, Ginny chose one of the not-empty ones, and downed it.
Draco didn’t laugh audibly, but Harry felt it anyway.
Harry moaned softly, his cock futilely attempting to express interest in this plan.
Harry let out a hoarse sort of hum, not bothering with spells or patience in hurrying Draco’s shirt over his head, and his own shortly after. Draco pressed to him straight away, wrapping his arms around summer-freckled shoulders, narrow hips rocking forward against Harry’s.
,” Harry cursed aloud.
After a long stretch where he thought he might never stop gasping, Harry managed to produce actual words.
“Now what?” Harry was afraid to move, and afraid to trust himself.
As it turned out, Ron had come by to see if he might want to do some flying off behind the Burrow.
“We’ll need to switch it up, I imagine. Different families, individuals, different needs. We’ll need to create a variety in that regard. If we can squeeze it in, a few of them should have three bedrooms at least.”
Draco’s replying smirk was terribly wicked. “Practice makes perfect, Potter.”
Draco drew in a slow, steadying breath. “You said more that time.”
“I’ve got some time now. What exactly do you need to know?”
Following him through into the ballroom, Harry laughed darkly, echoing a bit off the mirror-ceiling. “Sounds dangerous.”
Harry summoned his broom from the hall cupboard and the two former Gryffindors walked the short road from town back to the Burrow, through the garden and on up the hill to the orchard.
When he curled his fingers a bit, Draco threw his head back against the mahogany desktop with enough force to
Not that Draco was actually giving him much choice in the matter.
“Why not.”
“…thank you,” he drawled begrudgingly.
Harry coughed a quiet laugh. Draco could be incredibly dedicated to whatever he was working on, assuming you could get him invested in the first place. It was curiously endearing.
“Would you like to fuck me instead?”
“Anyway, all the more reason. Isn’t that enough? We’re hardly responsible for saving them from their own problems as well, surely.”
Immediately Harry shoved his tongue in as far as he could go.
“Not for stability, no. However, we’ll still need to go through and give them all curtains. Here—I’ve written out some notes for you.”
Harry woke with a start, and found himself staring up at the worn wooden beams crossing his bedroom ceiling.
“Think m’fine, Gin. Thanks.”
It was getting overwhelming rather quickly.
He hadn’t even bothered to use Parseltongue, but Draco shuddered anyway, shoving his arse back into the quickening push of Harry’s hips, and moaning ever louder.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He was glad to find her in her office, and checked with her to see if she had the time available to speak with him and Draco. Cassie’s only available day that week was Wednesday morning quite early, and Harry had given her a tentative yes.
Harry was more the jump around and spin type, than the careful steps required for parlour music of the sort they were being treated to, and he usually preferred there be no audience of strangers to watch him when he inevitably mucked it up.
“Here then.”
“Next week then?” he teased lightly, far less artfully fastening Draco’s trousers as he’d done for him.
and properly met her worried gaze
“That can’t be right. You must’ve had it at Hogwarts.”
Harry found himself studying the line of them, until he realised he was missing the answer to his question.
“Yes Potter, the curtains are fucking essential. Stop pulling faces, it shouldn’t be overly demanding in terms of power. If we review a few standard transfigurations ahead of time, accounting for some variation in style, then we only need alter the colours—and that’s easy enough.”
Almost as an afterthought, he snatched Harry’s wand from the desk and cast a swift cleaning charm over them both. It was never a perfect kind of clean, but it would work until either of them could find the time to shower.
Malfoy
“Well, this is…extravagant.”
“If I pretended to agree would you cease endlessly badgering me with your ridiculous attacks of conscience?”
“We’ll rest a few minutes, and get right back to it,” Harry reasoned, feeling the soft nudge of Draco’s nose, the steady puffs of breath on his neck.
“Obviously,” Draco drawled. “It’s our only option.”
“I might’ve killed you,” Draco pointed out tightly.
Before they got into the practical end of things, Draco went over a lot more theory with him.
“Er, yes?”
Even though he’d promised not to bother him, Harry fought off a sudden heedless desire to Floo over and surprise Draco for a quick shag—but he was quite tired what with all they’d been up to over weekend, and the flying as well.
In the short time Harry had been at the Ministry, he'd learned very quickly that the Improper Use of Magic Department had a reputation for being all ego and power-trips. He wasn’t really a fan. But, if they could do this correctly, hopefully they wouldn't have to deal with them at all.
“I’m getting there—but not yet. I’ll need a little more time to work out the kinks.”
“You wouldn’t’ve fucking listened! You went Gryffindor-mad and you fucking stormed out—only
“Shh,” Malfoy hushed against his lips. “I haven’t set any silencing charms.”
“I suppose that’s one way to solve a problem,” Draco drawled derisively. “What’ve they got you working on in Poisons and Antidotes?”
,” he panted shakily. “Fucking—exactly like that.”
“You can work with whomever you need to Harry, but breaking the Statutes could mean a lot of trouble if you’re caught. Please
,” Harry hissed. “Draco—stop. I’ll come.”
That evening Harry ate alone in his kitchen, scrawling out a short note to the heads of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, requesting several days off, and making a point not to examine too closely how he was explicitly endeavoring to do the opposite of enforce the law. If he kept his mind on the part where they were doing the right thing, then he could mostly avoid panicking at the thought of what the consequences might be if they were caught.
But it was as if he could flip a switch these days. When his denial was feeling robust enough, he could almost pretend he wasn’t being a dishonest snake, for a little while.
“Parkinson the gossip queen?”
Draco’s chuckle was wonderfully wicked. “Not yet. Put it inside first.”
“No.”
Friday morning found him frowning into his tea in the kitchen, his mind warring with itself over whether or not it was reasonable for him to even
One thing Harry had to make time for was stopping by to see Cassie, checking if she had come up with any suggestions for locations—and she had a few. She’d lined out a small area on a paper map for him, small pushpins stuck into the places they might consider.
Obeying, Draco came then, far over-shooting Harry’s hand.
Harry gave him more, quite deep in the intensity of Draco’s tightness. “Holy
“Er, yes? Or, I mean—no?” Harry wasn’t sure what the correct answer was, but then it didn’t actually seem to matter.
possibly be helpful with? You’re not getting into any Dark Magic bollocks, are you?”
He’d given his Patronus a good workout for certain, though its dimness continued to concern him.
“Can you last?”
“You want to know the point?”
“Harry?” Hermione prompted.
,” Draco demanded in a quiet moan. “Fuck—
three-hundred-year-old books from his family’s personal library?”
"I didn't forget,” Harry said hollowly.
“Malfoy,” Harry warned tiredly, unfurling the scroll.
Before attempting to sleep, he pulled out the Protean light, tapped it on and wrote out ‘MEET FRI?’ over its dome in blue marker. Then he tucked it away again to glow in the dark of his drawer. With any luck, Cassie would see it when she went to work the next morning.
Harry knew perfectly well, as an Auror if nothing else, he should’ve put a stop to this immediately.
“Your birthday’s coming up.” Draco changed the subject rather expertly.
They moaned together when Harry collapsed exhausted atop him.
“Oh, that’s very nice. Good idea, Harry.”
And of course…what happened when Draco inevitably moved on with his life?
Moaning and dazed, Draco panted into Harry’s neck as they both descended from pleasurable heights—but he did not give Harry or himself very long to recover.
It was the smell of chocolate and cinnamon that woke Harry about twenty minutes later, and Draco had been kind enough to make two this time. A mug was sitting on the bedside table beside his glasses and his wand when he pushed himself up to sitting.
Reigning in his control, Harry thrust through the bliss, slowing the push of his cock, but not straying from steadily sliding over Draco’s prostate. He watched raptly in the mirror as Draco’s eyes fell shut with a rhapsodic gasp, rocking back to meet his thrusts in a tranquil rhythm.
Harry came rather forcefully. He was very lucky Draco caught at his hair then and pulled him in for a biting kiss, or he might have fallen right over.
Finding a comfortable chaise on which to rest in one of Draco’s tents, he convalesced another hour before Draco was finished with the inspections, and they went back to casting Extension Charms.
“Ah—how should—that is—oh, I suppose I’ll just say it. My sister’s a writer for Witch Weekly
He couldn’t keep it all secret forever, he couldn’t go on doing it forever…but how long could he continue to tempt fate? Because he wasn’t yet ready for any of it to be over.
“I’m not exactly sure what you did at the end there, but it felt a bit like—erm, like that one time in the library. You know?”
“Shit,” he breathed.
“We’ve got four more days, Draco.”
It was one more conundrum to add to the pile of them he seemed to be accumulating lately. If he stopped for a moment to take stock of them all at once, he might just transfigure himself into a rock, and spend the rest of his long rock life sitting quietly in a corner somewhere.
“You’re really into silk, aren’t you?” Harry teased quietly, clumsy fingers pushing at the hem of them, rolling them down Draco’s hips.
Harry quickly realised he needed to hold on to something that wasn’t likely to break or drive him mad, and ignored the warning look Malfoy shot him when he laced his fingers through pale strands of hair, as soft as they had always looked to be.
“See you there.”
“I hate to break it to you Malfoy, but there’s not much else to do in here.”
“There was a lot of smashing,” was the only way Harry could think to describe it.
But Cassie was smirking.
are the absolute last person allowed to question my taste.”
“Erm.”
trust you, Harry,” Hermione tried diplomatically. “We’re just concerned. Ginny is concerned for you. We had to be sure you were alright—that you’re not in over your head on anything again. We can keep your secrets; you know we can, but you’d tell us if you were in any real trouble, wouldn’t you?”
Either way, obviously Harry needed to know more.
As the lust-daze faded and his breathing steadied out, rather than drifting right to sleep, Harry found himself lazily recounting some of the day’s events in his head, and one in particular.
“You can’t be good at everything, Potter.”
“You want to snog a bit?” Harry finished for him, taking the chance he’d read his intentions properly to press closer.
Harry yawned abruptly. “Sorry, I’m properly worn out from this morning…I don’t suppose we have time for a quick afternoon nap before you go off for your research?”
, this is astoundingly unfair…” But he shoved Harry back down into his chair, and seated himself firmly on the hardened outline of his cock. “Don’t fucking stop.”
However, as they passed through the shelter’s main doors, its front room remained humming with activity, packed full with tables of people all eating and chatting over the continuous clink of silverware and the squawk of metal chair legs on a hard parquet floor. Though far from it, nevertheless Harry was immediately reminded of the Great Hall—which was all well and good, until he shortly thereafter started recalling what many hells had transpired under its vaulted ceiling in the end.
Caught in the torridly tightening tug inside him, Harry was breathless too. He gasped unsteady on the edge, his hips rushing in time with the wave of heat coursing through him, just before he broke.
Draco chuckled smugly rolling out of the bed. “If you insist.”
“Not the Muggle way, I’m not stupid. That doesn’t mean I can’t be of any help.”
“I’ll send you an owl, as usual.”
buttons, Malfoy. Just use a spell.”
“What, you mean—I’ll have one and you’ll have one?”
“Whatever this sauce is, it’s brilliant.”
If Malfoy was trying to reassure him that this wasn’t a terrible mistake, he was doing a dreadful job of it. It was also possible Harry was sobering up a bit, so close to the scene of what he still considered one of the worst decisions he had ever made.
who I was when you started this. It’s not some great fucking surprise, it’s who I’ve always been.”
Riding back up to the atrium, they could already hear the loud chattering of drunken Ministry employees enjoying their holiday party.
“Sounds like fun,” Harry shot back wryly.
“Hello, Potter.”
“I still think you’ve gone completely barmy.”
“What’s this?”
Harry pushed himself properly upright again when he’d found his senses, groping around for his glasses somewhere on the desk.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Yes, your cock is making that exceptionally clear,” Draco taunted low, nipping back at Harry’s in turn. “Only remember you’ve promised to make this quick.”
A hesitation of Draco’s mouth on his cock, faltering as he considered—though even as he did, his tongue swirled wickedly on Harry’s tip, teasing out a few salty drops of Harry’s desperation before he very slowly pulled Harry’s cock from his mouth.
“I have no idea what you’re on about,” Harry teased a bit.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Well, I—before I knew who I was really, at my aunt’s—for the longest time my entire world was a dusty little cupboard.” It hardly compared to some of the hardships Cassie talked about, but that didn’t make it any easier for him to admit this, especially to Malfoy.
“Mm,” Draco hummed, clearly unconvinced.
Draco leant back a bit, bracing on the front edge of the basin to arch toward the head of Harry’s cock as Harry palmed the soft curve of his arse, whispering a few quiet spells. He caught hold at Draco’s thighs, pulling them higher up his waist, aiming in the direction of spell-slicked heat, lust lit with anticipation.
Harry pulled the door shut and plopped into a wobbly chair. Extracting two of the push lights, and a pack of markers from his pocket, he laid them out on her desk to unshrink them.
“I…suppose if you
Harry snorted. “You must think you’re as attractive as I do.”
A replying tight cry from Draco was all the warning either of them had before he was shooting wickedly hot jets over Harry’s arse, nudging his spilling tip ever so gently harder to the tight twist, lost in a pleasure haze.
Cassie hurried out of her office, leaving them to themselves. When Harry chanced a glance at Draco, he noticed a distinct thoughtful frown.
That woke him up somewhat. He had, in fact, left the house at almost one in the morning, while Ginny slept upstairs, having no idea he’d even left.
The way Draco kissed him then was the softest Harry thought they ever had. There was one, two, and a third, each leaving behind their own explosive sort of promise—before their lips finally parted for their tongues to roll together, hot and wet and pliant. Harry felt a little dizzy.
“No, so you should just say yes.”
“My father got up to all sorts of naughtiness in school before he married my mother, in order to carry on the family name.”
“Luna heard it from Mandy Brocklehurst, I think. See, I gossiped—before the war turned everything death and doom all the time.”
Draco whispered a time spell, and a smoky glowing clock face materialised in the dark room above their heads. It was almost four-thirty.
“Quite. Try not to spill.” After a careful swirl he took a short sip before passing off to Harry, a thoughtful purse to paler lips. “I suppose it’s decent—smooth enough. I’m not certain it’s really that many galleons worth of smooth.”
As they had the night before, they shared a tumbler of warming whisky together, this time with significantly less snogging, and more sleepily resting shoulder-to-shoulder on the sofa in the sitting room.
Harry recalled quite vividly the feel of Cruciatus on the tip of his wand, and the tip of his tongue. When it worked, the power of controlling that sort of all-encompassing pain had been—as Dark Magic tended to be—dangerously addictive, even if Harry had struggled to find the strength of hateful intent required to harness it properly. He couldn’t imagine being forced to use it regularly, as Draco had been.
He was sprawled out on his back, and Draco watched him a moment hesitantly before carefully stretching out atop him. Both of them were wisely careful to keep their hips apart from each other, and it was actually quite cosily comfortable—perhaps even dangerously so.
Malfoy reached between them and caught Harry’s wrist in a tight grip. “How about now?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Malfoy stepped closer just behind him, close enough now that when Harry naturally tried to glance back, pale thin fingers grasped his jaw, facing him forwards again.
“Satisfied?” Harry checked, fastening his own.
Smoothing his palm down Draco’s back, Harry turned him around and bent him over the foot of the bed, sliding two wandlessly slicked fingers gently into the rather raw clench of his blushing arse, without any stretching spells.
“Right, only you weren’t asking me to come in English this time.”
A passing gran looked about in a scandalised sort of way as they neared the main road, but they hadn’t dispelled the Disillusionment Charm yet, and Harry was hopeful she hadn’t seen them.
For one thing, Harry had wanted to do most of the painting by hand—only now Draco had his hands all tied and bound above his head. He’d wrapped Harry’s wrists up in gold and scarlet stripes, pulled from Harry’s trunk, with a terribly wicked smirk.
“Erm, right. Good. That’s—thanks.” Harry took a drink, wincing around the pleasantly distracting burn that followed. “Good to know.”
Draco was quiet a few moments, staring out across the bedroom. Harry assumed he was thinking over what all they would need to do to prepare. When he finally broke his silence that wasn’t what he was thinking at all.
“Now, about that offer of yours—”
“I wasn’t. I was going to say I should be free the weekend after next—but I can owl you with a time later.”
. How are you still so fucking tight?” Harry cursed, even if he knew the answer was surely magic.
Draco finally glanced back at him, just before Harry tossed the powder in. As their eyes met, Harry was glad he’d stopped to look back one last time.
All in all, it took them much longer than strictly necessary to get to the atrium, fully dressed and not touching. Partly because Harry’d had to summon some of his clothes, which he’d seen fit to leave a trail of between the library and Draco’s bedroom
Harry flushed pink, and Draco smirked, his mission accomplished.
Harry nevertheless went on gazing at it wistfully a moment, until Draco caught him by the shoulders and propelled him out of the bedroom.
“You said to take my time,” Harry pointed out, quietly amused.
“That’s awfully generous of you.”
“Buggering hell, you’re really pushing the edge of the law, aren’t you? Handing out enchanted items to Muggles…”
He wasn’t sure how long they sat there on the floor of the Hall of Prophecy. Malfoy was still leant back against him, and he found he didn’t particularly mind the feeling at all. He also felt no real urgency to move, despite their less than conventional surroundings. In fact his anxiety of earlier had all but vanished.
“Very funny. But really, d’you want to?”
“What about the windows?”
“Can I make you come like this?” Persuasively, Harry teased his lips at Draco’s ear and crushed his hips forward to hit harder, forcing Draco’s cock more firmly to the mirror.
“Come for me, Harry,” he breathed, raw and wanting.
“Goodnight, Harry. Leave the books, won’t you? Until you’ve had them checked—”
“Yes. Do that,” Draco drawled hoarsely.
“Suppose it stands to reason he’s a bit dotty as well.”
“I want it,” Draco persisted, low and demanding. “Give it to me.”
“You’ll need to scale it back a bit, Potter.”
“And if I don’t try, who will? The Muggles aren’t doing it. Not you, apparently; than who?”
Draco’s mouth found his ear, moaning in a raw voice, thick with desire when the tip of Harry’s cock started rubbing into his sweet spot every time.
“How close?” Harry breathed in distracted hesitation.
On the way, he spotted the woman who’d first directed him to Cassie’s office months ago, a plastic badge on her shirt brightly proclaiming her name to be Sally.
In the aftermath of the solstice Harry is a bit on edge.
He and Ginny spent the majority of the time between Christmas and New Years at the Burrow, and his only saving grace was the sheer chaos of a house full of Weasleys. A guilty conscience just served to make the holidays even more stressful than usual. Anxiety over his questionable choices and the added burden of more frequent field sessions with Savage had combined to make the next few weeks fly by in a blur of exhaustion and stress.
“What—?"
Once more, for several minutes they could only focus on regaining the ability to breathe evenly. When Draco finally sat up to charm them properly clean—for good this time—the stars were glittering silently through the forest’s thick branches, and it only reoccurred to Harry then what day it was, that they were still in the Forbidden Forest, and also that most of the day’s events were likely hours past over.
Harry suppressed an eyeroll and started looking over the menu, though he wasn’t really reading it past registering it wasn’t written in English. Yet another question was bubbling up that he couldn’t keep from voicing.
“You want to—
want me to distract from the bit where you care about Muggles to discuss getting off instead?”
This was likely going to be a long meal.
After a time Harry's eyes were drawn down to Malfoy’s rolled sleeves, and the pale stretch of one exposed forearm in particular. The otherwise unmarked skin was cut through the center with a scar that jagged at the middle as Harry’s did, though was much longer, its ends pointing one down to his wrist and the other up toward the crook of his elbow.
“Draco
“Good. Tea?” she offered.
Although, now he was thinking of it—he broke the silence with a short clearing of his throat.
“Well it’s obviously not enough,” Harry pointed out with a frown. “Where are they coming from? How—”
As he prepares to spend the last few days of August at Malfoy Manor, Harry receives an unexpected visitor, and Draco somehow manages to keep their minds off shagging long enough to get some actual work done.
Harry laughed awkwardly. “I really am sorry for worrying you.”
“I told him it was over, and with any luck he’ll be smart enough to keep the secret to blackmail me with later. Also, I have my doubts anyone would believe him.”
“That is what I’m offering. Only say so now, or—”
“Drac
He thrust forward in a hard snap, and Draco whimpered at the impact with the stinging skin of his arse.
“I could always be fashionably late,” Draco suggested hoarsely, long fingers threading through Harry’s hair and holding his mouth exactly where it was on his throat. “
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “If we start anything else now, I’m not sure we’ll get back to the spells.”
“Dementors tend to roam the city more at night, but it’s much easier to locate them in daylight, and they seem a little less inclined to put up a fight as well—but we’ll need to be as subtle as possible no matter what. If we
That threw Harry off. Why would they need to speak to Arthur and Molly? Not that they hadn’t been incredibly heroic during the war, and sacrificed far more than anyone should’ve ever had to—but no, it dawned on Harry then the man had been referring to Ron and Hermione.
“The night I proposed. More than a year,” he breathed out.
“Soon-ish.”
Harry stared at him overwhelmed for several quiet beats. “You know I really couldn’t do any of this without you.”
“That can’t be healthy,” Draco drawled at him with an arched eyebrow, which took Harry a moment to recognise as concern.
“Pull it together, Malfoy. You wanted to come in here.”
Ginny would be leaving for Dorset to play the Wasps on Tuesday, and be gone until the following Sunday.
thinking about exactly how good Draco Malfoy looked in a Muggle suit.
“As I said, you’ll see soon enough. Today the assignment is to remove as many Dementors as possible from the surrounding areas of Westminster. For now, the Ministry considers this a Muggle problem with magical pests, and we’ve been asked to help out the Pest Control Board. In you get then!”
“Er. Sorry. I’ll go out and get new ones soon, I promise.”
Harry thought he might wait in the sitting room, but Draco gathered up Harry’s notebook with his own and followed him out into the kitchen.
Panting lightly, Draco tipped his head back, narrowing silver eyes at him. “Come closer.”
The next evening, Harry received an infuriatingly brief reply.
He was rubbing at Draco’s sensitive entrance with the pad of his middle finger for much longer than strictly necessary before forcing it inside—it was a far more unyielding space than he recalled—but as Draco adjusted, Harry thought he could start gently working in a second.
doing here?”
Despite Draco’s playful tone, Harry flustered, but he also gave voice to another thought which had been turning about in his head for a while.
“Precisely. Now stop faffing about in your head and pay attention. I wanted to get to casting tonight, while we’ve got the time to do it properly.”
I might come,” he warned, groaning frustratedly when Draco immediately pulled back.
It was a few beats later before Draco’s curiosity got the better of him and he followed just behind. Harry was surprised to find that most of the furnishings in the sitting room were simple, modern and sleek. The kitchen too looked surprisingly like a modern Muggle kitchen—excepting its lack of electrical appliances—and Harry had to wonder exactly how much research Draco had been doing into Muggle houses to pull it off so accurately.
For the space of a heartbeat, Draco met Harry’s eye, and gave up on what had started out a warning tone, huffing a short sigh of surrender instead.
“What’s a bliss inducer?” he asked instead.
“C’mon, Malfoy. I’ve helped plenty of other people learn it, and you’ve helped me a fucking lot recently. Let me return the favour for once.”
In the red-hot tension that followed, he snapped his hips forward hard. Draco had to press his arm to the mirror to keep from colliding with it, but he moaned louder just the same—murmuring low words in that raw tone Harry couldn’t resist.
It was a several minute walk to the kitchen, and they bantered the rest of the way, but when they arrived Draco charmed together some tea and a proper lunch for them. He insisted they eat quickly again, but Harry would’ve done anyway, having worked up quite an appetite that morning.
As he tugged them up, a shift on the bed drew his attention, but Draco was only rolling over onto his front, and seemingly still asleep. Harry spent longer than necessary watching the slow rise and fall of his back—deciding then he looked as extraordinary stretched out in Harry’s bed as he did in his own extravagant one.
Shuddering bodily against him, Draco sounded so much hoarser than he had a moment ago. “That’s playing
Finding anyone willing to chat with him for any length of time was much more difficult than he had anticipated. He was, embarrassingly, used to people being especially easy to charm information out of, given who he was—a trick that would obviously not work as well in a world where he was just one more bespeckled git asking unnecessary questions.
The new tolerance, peace, civility, whatever it was, it felt like a good thing, a bright spot in the darkness. However, it obviously was not enough of a bright spot to make Harry feel any more inclined to be at this excessively extravagant party.
planning to elaborate on. Ron was obviously still distressed.
“For comfort—well obviously I originally thought heating spells would be prudent, but that was in January. What with us heading into summer now, probably a Temperate charm makes more sense. Works for all seasons.”
It was starting to get much more difficult to leave, his desire to go back was nearly overpowering.
It wasn’t until Draco waved him to the center of the carpet, and began walking him through the more complex wand-movements that the first spell would require, that all Harry’s nerves and uncertainty transmuted into something much more simmering.
He couldn’t stop yawning, and probably should’ve gone for a nap, but he really wanted to drop off his newly created method of communication. She was only a few blocks away, it seemed silly not to seize the opportunity.
“Have you just put that in your mouth?” His normally-perfect hair was only a little sweatily dishevelled.
“Only the one glass?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Good?” Harry panted huskily.
Caught up in kissing, it took a fumbling moment to find and properly push into the maddening pull of Draco’s clenched heat with one, and shortly thereafter two fingers. He was fully tight to start with, so it was taking longer than usual, but whatever awkwardness lingered between them quickly vanished when Draco started moaning over his lips, teasing with his tongue into deeper kisses
“Fucking hell. Alright shut up then, this is the fiddliest bit.”
He helped himself to a dry but mostly edible biscuit in the meantime, and the quiet between the snores was comforting.
There was a wicked slant to his smirk then that made Harry very nervous, but as Malfoy paced an idle circle around him, something about the shine of silver-blue light in his eyes was
Deciding he had better get on with joining the D.A. for lunch, Harry steeled himself to go back into the fray. He wrote a short note to Hagrid before he left, passing along everyone’s greetings—and promising to visit on a less sad day, soon—then quietly crept his way out of the hut.
“What I know from those willing to talk is they’re coming from all over the county and the outer boroughs. Then you’ve got your immigrants, refugees, kids whose parents have kicked them out—"
It wasn’t his invisibility cloak, though he doubted most Muggles would think to look twice at an apparently empty backstreet in broad daylight. Rather than bother answering him, Draco made his intentions quite clear going to his knees on rough pavement to mouth Harry’s cock through his trousers, smoothly sliding open his belt.
“I only think it's a foolish, bleeding-heart notion that even Granger would tell you is too ambitious. You know the Ministry can barely deal with its own, let alone… how many hundreds more? That’s ridiculous."
Draco only quickened his hand, almost challenging Harry to keep it together, and Harry shuddered dangerously.
then I need you to be up here on my cock,” he insisted, shifting restlessly.
Draco made it halfway over the bridge crossing the atrium before he spotted Harry standing down there, a demanding question burning in the green of his eyes. A flash of shock crossed his pointed features as their gazes locked, a flicker of emotion shuttering quickly away behind absolutely nothing at all.
Ron swung by a little closer tossing the Quaffle idly in the air. “You know he probably would if you asked—and he knows some pretty great Seeker feints as well.”
“You’re asking
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Er, alright. Hang on.”
Harry sighed. “It’s been a very long week—work’s been a pain in the arse, I’m having a completely shit time with Poisons and Antidotes, and the Dementors are getting worse again—but I’ll be alright.”
But Draco wouldn’t want to hear any of that, and Harry at least knew when to bite his tongue this time.

That night, Harry dreamed of a high vaulted ceiling, reflecting a sea of pearly stars in milky white—but when he woke Tuesday morning and began the drowsy process of getting ready for work, all the exquisite detail of the dream faded quickly away to ethereal nothing.
He opened his mouth to argue but Draco arched an eyebrow and Harry took a slightly annoyed bite of his sandwich instead.
Harry kissed him back, teasing deeper into his mouth to flick against his tongue in turn—but then Draco was pulling back, and shifting down between his legs again.
“Let’s hope so. I’d rather not—”
.” He whispered the Parseltongue name into his ear, and let slip a quieter groan when Draco tensed around his softening cock.
Harry started biting at his throat, catching pale skin between his teeth and biting to bruise when he felt the growing tremors inside Draco intensifying.
“Tuck your bits back into your pants, Potter. We have work to do.”
“And did you discover anything interesting?”
Harry nipped along the tempting line of his shoulder, and Draco hummed warmly at him.
“What will you tell them?” Draco reached for his robes.
As time ticked on as well, Harry could sense the growing undercurrent of her impatience with him. He found himself avoiding that particular conversation at all costs. He didn’t want to make things worse, yet often anything he did say was always the
Even Charlie had turned up for the news (and to celebrate with his brother) toward the end of the week. He had popped by to Harry and Ginny’s as well, to see the house. Harry was glad to have the chance to have a drink with him, it had been far too long, and there was a certain ease when he talked to Charlie that Harry had missed.
Even as his climax spun forcefully through him, Harry was trying to find the sense not to press back on Draco’s cock any more than he already had. Draco shifted them both away from that temptation to slowly thrust the full length of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, spreading cooling seed all between them. There was quite a lot of it.
“If he thinks I’d even consider chasing after him over this, he is very fucking mistaken.”
Harry was staring, and when he finally noticed him, Zabini stared back.
Shifting closer yet, Draco bit him a little harder, just at the nape of his neck. “Correct.”
Now that he was thinking about it—
your job.”
Harry knew better than to trust the wizarding community at large to support him doing anything terribly unpopular. He recalled how easy it was for the whole of the community to turn on him in the face of a few bad articles.
He moaned swallowing it, as Harry started sucking impatiently over his Adam’s apple, and lower to bite at the base of his throat. Harry liked knowing he was causing that unsteady hitch in Draco’s breathing, groaning himself at the familiar feel of demanding fingers tangling in his hair. He liked knowing Draco wanted him to bite harder, and very much liked the noises he made when Harry did.
The whole idea was overwhelming on a number of levels, including that he wasn’t sure what might happen spending so many days in a row together—but it was also what they had been working toward for months, and Harry very much wanted it to be successful.
As he worked his ring finger in to join the other two, Harry nudged the sticky tip of his cock over the flush of one arsecheek with pointed promise. Draco writhed for him, gasping when Harry started rubbing with all three fingers over the oversensitive centre of nerves inside him.
They were stood in front of a classy-looking restaurant called
Clambering onto the cushioned lounge with a distinct lack of his already lacking grace, Harry waved his partial tumbler of firewhisky in Malfoy’s direction, and promptly drained it all in one swallow.
“Cheeky.”
Draco did not stay over that night, though Harry hadn’t offered either. It was a step too far for his guilt to handle.
Harry woke on the first morning of September to the weight of someone sat on his legs, smacking his arse. It was really the smack which woke him, and with quite a start.
Hermione broke off abruptly and Harry saw her eyes widen slightly.
“I will find a way to make it lie flat.”
He bobbed for a bit, which took more coordination than Harry was expecting, and then got himself distracted teasing his tongue down the underside. He tried not to be overly nervous when he discovered Draco was watching him, his eyes a darkened grey with arousal.
Draco caught hold of his forearm to tug him a little closer, and Harry didn’t think, he just kissed him, quick and slightly urgent. Taunting lips quirked faint amusement at him, and he was fighting off the draw to do it again when, jarring as it ever was, he popped out of being under the push of Draco’s magic.
“Don’t come,” Harry murmured in challenge, palming pale cheeks before he went on repeatedly tracing the sensitive circle with the tip of his tongue.
She saved him the trouble. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Mr. Potter.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Taken aback at the seriousness of the question, Harry hesitated. “I don’t…er, I think so? Don’t you think I should?”
It was also the case that when Ginny left for this next series, it would be her last for the summer. The week Harry had taken off would be the last week he had the house, and time, to himself for several months.
“How much risk
“Correct. Are you finished? We don’t have time for faffing about.”
Listening to his quick steps echoing off the stone corridors, some of Draco’s careful control slipped. “Fucking Gryffindor
Draco smirked at him. “Or extremely difficult—if you prefer.”
So far, so good.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a long wordless look across the table, and Harry wondered if they realised he could read them like a book after all these years. This would almost certainly be about Draco, then.
He wrapped slick fingers around Draco’s cock then, pumping him slowly.
Neville joined them then, Dean and Seamus only a moment later, all combining to divert the conversation away to tales of their many school mishaps.
“Yes, thank you Blaise. Don’t you have something you’re meant to be doing?”
“You’ve been pounding into me on and off for a good twelve hours, my arse hasn’t had the chance to recover, has it?”
Harry showered, shaved and brushed his teeth, then took a few minutes to heal the most visible scratches and bites marking his throat. Perhaps he ought to have been reflecting on how awful he was being, but he was sort of in a hurry, and preoccupied thinking about what all they would need to accomplish in the next few days.
“Draco
That was new. Moaning, Harry parted his lips almost obediently to make way for a demanding tongue, whilst neither of them seemed capable of halting the steady rock of their hips together.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I’m guessing you don’t want all eleven inches?” Harry quirked an impish smirk.
Harry unthinkingly ran his fingers over a few more-tender spots. “Whose fault is that?”
“You’ll see when we get there, ‘bit of a mess if you ask me, Potter; but I hear you’ve got a wicked Patronus in your arsenal. ‘Ought to prepare your happy thoughts now, you’ll be needing them today.”
What with Ginny home for the week and Bill and Fleur visiting with their big announcement, Harry spent the majority of his next week caught up in the chaos of the Burrow, with a lot of back-and-forth between there and work and home.
He rolled his eyes. “Alright, lay off. Help me set this up would you?”
Gripping under Draco’s knee, Harry spread him wider, whispering a short lubrication spell and thrusting right back in. They fell into a speeding rhythm of cries, raw noises, and shamelessly urging each other on to another pair of euphoric orgasms. Harry fucked into his sweet spot relentlessly, watching Draco come in hard throbs up his chest before he gave over to spilling inside him one more time.
“You make the hottest fucking sounds,” Harry murmured rubbing over the spot harder.
When several long seconds of staring expectantly yielded no response, Blaise snapped his fingers. “The soap?”
Following his departure, the silence in the little house was frustratingly full of conflict, and too many thoughts Harry didn’t want to think, so he didn’t stay.
—but Harry had promised something, and was perhaps now a bit over-eager to deliver.
Harry had given up taking notes, as Draco had been droning on for a bit too long at that point about the intricacies of magically measuring intent. As he paced in front of the desk, Harry slouched back on one of the longer settees—and though he didn’t intend to, broke into a large yawn.
He knew it was wiser to tell her only as much as she needed to know, but that would get more difficult when they inevitably invited her to be more involved.
Draco looked so thoroughly deliciously well-fucked, his cheeks still flushed high pink and his stomach covered with his own come—as Harry pushed his legs open wider and fucked him harder, racing the dark shot of peaking arousal he got when Draco gasped out his next.
Harry had no objections whatsoever, only quiet groans.
In the weeks following the solstice Harry was, on and off, a nervous wreck.
“Is this any better?” He felt awkward as all hell, but Harry was trying not to make a mess, or Merlin forbid slurp.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. Rising up to kiss Draco insatiably, he worked himself between pale thighs as Draco arched for him, helping Harry to inch his cock inside.
He’d arrived with Ginny no more than half an hour ago, and a bit late. She’d been derailed almost immediately by a number of other Weasleys coming to catch up; her parents and Percy, primarily.
Harry moaned quite loud.
He cast a short charm to clean them up properly, and kissed Harry one more time.
However if he had known they were going to go traipsing about where they were not meant to be, he might not’ve had quite so many drinks.
"—However, I am the absolute
A bit shocked he was open to discussing the matter at all, Harry furrowed his brow as he considered his own experience. “I’ve visited with her and Teddy, but it was a bit awkward. She’s…honestly, it’s fucking creepy how much she looks like Bellatrix sometimes.”
“Somewhat, yes.”
. Please?”
However, rather than go up the stairs and knock on his door, Harry decided to stand on the lower level and call out, his voice echoing off the great domed ceiling, loud enough to be heard over the continuous splash of the fountain further in.
,” Draco moaned hoarsely. Harry’s prick ached at the sound of him.
It was awkward to navigate. Harry regretfully found himself spending more time at the office than he strictly needed to most nights, to avoid sitting at the kitchen table, talking of empty things and avoiding any real conversations.
you fucking prick that’s good,” he sighed in sensuous surrender.
” Draco was arching again, pushing his cock deeper, cursing and gasping as he came into the sucking pull of Harry’s mouth—sudden enough that Harry just let it happen before he remembered to swallow, and by then he had a bit of a mouthful.
“I am capable of them, but I doubt I could do them all myself—nor would I want to. I think it would be wise for you to start small, and even then—"
It was then Harry noticed the pinkish flush collecting high on Malfoy’s cheeks.
“What were you doing out here?”
Savage led, and Harry followed.
It was very short notice, however Harry thought he might be able to swing it.
Harry wanted it to be true. He wished neither of them had been forced to live through what they did—but he was there with him now. They had made it out alive, and he knew on some level that if he really wanted, he could probably have him all the time. If he was brave enough.
Harry was ready to move on, but he was momentarily distracted watching Draco idly stirring his teacup. It took him a beat to snap out of it.
When the tent had finished setting itself, Malfoy charmed one of the flaps open for him, and Harry tried to keep in mind what he had said about stretching and not exploding, whilst also staying focused on the task at hand.
When they were settled on opposite sides, their drinks and the stack of books between them, Malfoy picked back up where he had left off at the bar.
Harry couldn’t tell for certain if he was being sarcastic or not, but either way the weather didn’t seem likely to dissipate anytime soon. The clouds moving in their direction only looked darker yet.
Draco surveyed him idly before he pushed off the desk. He caught Harry’s chin in his grip, turning his head for Draco to get a better look at his cheek one more time. He didn’t say anything, but he
When he’d finished eating, he sat with his wand hesitating just over the surface of the board, deliberating whether or not he should ask Draco to move the time up.
It was vaguely reminiscent of alcohol, but with obviously faster-acting effects and a bit…hotter. Malfoy was watching him quite closely again, and it was coiling a flush of warmth all through Harry, tight as a spring.
“Your hand is on my cock, can’t you tell?”
When they were all the proper size again, Cassie looked mildly disappointed.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
The rest of Harry’s week he felt on the edge of anticipation for a number of reasons.
poison, you would be alright with my drinking it?”
“You’re completely hopeless. Didn't anyone ever teach you proper etiquette?”
It was a bit of a problem.
Malfoy kept his hand over Harry’s a moment and their eyes locked for the time it took him to whisper a quiet lubrication charm. Now Harry could squeeze a bit tighter. When he did, gripping hard and tugging faster, it was completely enthralling to watch the shifting twitch of Malfoy’s hips, and the steady building flush under normally so pale cheeks.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Calm down, I haven’t adjusted them yet.”
A pair of iron staircases, spiral of course, mirrored each other on either side of the room, leading up to their respective second levels. On those second levels were also two doors, one on each side, and both closed.
“Yes, actually. I’d rather not lose my job if it’s all the same to you”
Since Ginny had signed on with the Harpies, Harry spent a good amount of time helping her to practice before important matches. She pushed herself quite hard, inevitably pushing Harry to keep up with her. There had been times in the last year or so where he’d thought if any of the leagues had asked him to play, he would’ve been well prepared to step in, if he’d wanted, but he didn’t really. He was content with the lower stakes of helping with Ginny’s practice, or flying with Ron to occasionally blow off some steam, even if it meant he was relegated to the roles of Chaser or Keeper, dependent upon whom he was playing.
“You could come back to the Manor for tea—if you’d like,” Malfoy offered, with a careful sort of indifference, which Harry found a bit suspect.
“Don’t stop,” Draco whispered into the flushed curve of Harry’s shoulder.
Ginny pulled him to his feet, the leaf was lost,  and she helped to keep him steady while he tested out his legs.
Monday evening after work, he was just finishing up a bowl of magically reheated soup when Ron popped in unexpectedly, flaring out of the Floo at about quarter-past-six.
It took several bleary seconds for him to note a number of truths—he was obviously not at home in his slightly lumpy bed, he also somehow managed to sleep through the night completely, and if he’d had any dreams or nightmares he couldn’t remember them.
“Curse,” Harry replied succinctly, pulling out with a soft grunt before he was doing as Draco instructed and tucking himself all back into place.
But Harry knew why.
Draco did not immediately answer him, but when he did, he sounded very amused.
After nearly five hours, whatever energy the banana and scone had provided for him was fully gone, and Harry’s stomach was growling—audibly enough Draco could hear it from several feet away, snickering as he finished out his most recent charm.
As noon drew nearer, Harry circled around into a side alley, and tried to stand out of sight while the Portkey worked its magic.
“You’re still hard,” Harry gasped, pressing his hips up to meet with as much force as he could when Malfoy had him pinned as he did.
Harry was a little ashamed how much of a relief it was when Draco owled to say they should convene. He wanted to go over his newest spell additions, which he’d been working on since the end of May, and to start walking Harry through how to properly string them all together into the base Extension Charm.
There was a superior sort of quirk to his pinker-than-usual lips that Harry found particularly daunting. But as sitting was all he felt capable of, he was careful lowering himself down to join Malfoy on the floor; he hadn’t the brain power for anything more.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry laughed sympathetically and Draco merely arched an eyebrow.
“Bloody Muggle clothes,” Draco muttered.
Harry considered. “Erm. Not really, no.”
Draco clearly wasn’t shit at folding charms. As Harry wrote out his letter, he couldn’t help sneaking glances to watch him properly spell everything clean in two quick laundering charms, and enchant it all into two small, neatly folded piles on the sitting room table. He even charmed Harry’s into his bag, to join the jumble of wrinkled shirts, denims and pants Harry had packed for his stay.
“I’ve got a lot more relevant books back at the library but it’s not exactly practical to cart them all off to you. I need them as well. Perhaps one of these days you might pop in to look through them.”
With a groan of annoyance rather than pleasure, Draco pulled back to narrow the stormy darkness of his eyes on Harry accusingly.
It was just so
Leaning forward on the black iron railing, Draco scowled down into the atrium with a short, clearly bothered huff.
“I just wanted to go out to lunch,” Harry winged. “If I’d known we’d have to get all…tarted up—”
with something like this? What if—”
“Well, I had thought we ought to leave those for tomorrow, then perhaps tonight we might consider celebrating the small victory of being through all these fucking extensions.”
“I’ve only been waiting all morning,” Draco snarked.
“I don’t have any plans really,” Harry finished quietly.
Harry held firm, letting him fuck himself on his fingers—he looked incredible doing it. He may have wanted to press his cock inside with a red-hot sort of intensity, but he wasn’t going to rush this.
He forgot completely about closing the back door when Draco used the table as leverage to wrap his thighs around Harry’s hips. Harry caught him by the arse and all but carried him up the stairs.
As Harry hurried to strip himself, Draco’s reflection only needed to smirk at him for his cock to give another eager twitch.
Harry thanked the woman, following her instructions and passing through the large front room into the back half of the building, down a tile-covered corridor with fluorescent lighting that reflected off the shine of the floors. Many of the rooms he passed looked quite small, though he did pass a set of open double doors, behind which he could see a much larger room, lined with windows. It reminded him some of a common room, what with all the tables, chairs and sofas dotted about.
He needed to find a wand, but was having no luck finding his own. He found Draco’s in his trousers on the floor, and it worked fine for a quick and mostly-effective spell, which he cast over Draco’s sleeping form as well. Draco was typically pretty quick with the cleansing charms, but what with being fucked into forgetting his own name it was no surprise he forgot the charms too.
“Perhaps eventually.”
“So. How is the glamorous Auror lifestyle treating you?”
He didn’t know what Malfoy needed—but Harry finally gave in to his own persistent desire to suck a very slow, biting kiss into the flushing skin on Malfoy’s throat where he had just been teasing. When he bit down harder, and his tongue traced a slow circle, Malfoy went suddenly taut, tightening in tension against him—a warm heat growing where the tip of his cock pressed between them.
Draco arched an eyebrow with impatient expectation.
, its façade all grey stone and high arched windows. There was a short queue following a purple carpet runner out the front door, and a few small clusters of people waited beneath the awning as well.
When he glanced back at the corner table where he had spoken to Ron and George earlier, they were sat back there laughing, with Ginny beside them catching snowflakes on her tongue. It was such a warming sight to see them all laughing together, that he nearly forgot the depths of his betrayal, for a moment. He was almost to the table before he recalled, and felt an immediate rush of shame and slight panic that halted him in his steps.
What he found particularly nice was the way he could go right back to sleep then, without even bothering to pull out, and Draco let him. In fact, Draco rested his eyes for a few minutes too—but eventually the position was a little too contorted for him and he groaned complainingly and nudged Harry awake enough to move off.
It was clearly meant for Harry, but obviously Malfoy had overheard.
“Erm. Yeah.”
“Spread your legs for me,” Harry encouraged, flashing a wickedly keen half-grin in the dim firelight.
“—but you’ve pressing matters elsewhere,” Malfoy finished for him, seemingly more resigned than disappointed.
He picked out a book he’d been intending to read through instead, and settled into the armchair beside Draco’s settee to read. Every once and awhile he would look up when Draco shifted, but he stayed asleep for over an hour.
Harry held tight to trembling thighs until Draco found the sense and strength to grip tighter to the ceramic edge with come-slippery fingers. The look of him was pure debauchery, breathless and ceaselessly riding himself on Harry’s achingly hard cock.
The rest of Harry’s summer developed quite a bit differently than his spring had. Ginny was home all the time now, and would be until August when her pre-season training started again.
“I’m just going mad is all,” Harry muttered to himself, stepping out into a patch of the wood where the grass had grown over the forest floor, lush and green thanks to a break in the treetops above.
“That doesn’t sound like Malfoy.”
“You’re so fucking tight without spells,” Harry uttered low, overwhelmed by the intensity.
Tuesday was uneventful, in so much as he spent most of his time sorting the paperwork he didn’t want to bother with when he got back. He wasn’t sure he’d get through it all before the end of the day, especially as his mind kept wandering over what all he needed to do that night to be ready to leave for Malfoy Manor the next morning—it was quite a lot to keep in his head.
“Er, by the way,” Harry cut him off before he could get any further ahead of them. “After the meeting tomorrow, would you maybe want to get something to eat in London?”
“No. There are no bathrooms in Malfoy Manor.”
“Later I’ll need you to explain how it is we have time for sucking off, but no time for snogging.”
Harry snorted. “And you’ve no idea what that’s like.”
He wanted Draco, but he shouldn’t want Draco. He wanted to kiss Draco, but he shouldn’t want to kiss him. He wanted to fuck Draco until dawn, and he shouldn’t’ve wanted that either.
Draco groaned impatiently. “Get your prick out, Potter. I’ve been waiting all day for this.”
“There’s an owl here for you. It’s a bit…disgruntled.”
It was very neat and thorough, and Harry had thanked her repeatedly.
Harry took the initiative to peek his head into the tent first, and step inside.
“No, I think it’s a yes.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He was so lost in his thoughts about wands and irony, he very nearly missed the casting. However on first cast the spell did not appear to have done much of anything to the inside of the music box.
—though he was going about it quite a bit rougher and sharper than before.
“You’re not inspecting anything, we’re sitting down. My head’s about to go completely sideways, and you’ve just almost fallen over.”
Harry stared at him blankly. “What?”
Ginny responded with the sort of amused smile which gave away she didn’t entirely mind, though there were times he knew his blunders disappointed her.
Then his fingers were threading through the soft damp strands of Draco’s hair and they were kissing. Draco’s lips tasted of coffee and rain, and Harry spent a moment exploring them quite thoroughly. When he caught hold of Draco’s arse and pulled them flush together, Draco moaned.
,” Harry whispered.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco sipped from his mug almost innocently, except for the hint of mischief in his smirk.
He hurried to get his mouth over Draco’s cock before he made any more of a mess, but mostly so he could taste him properly—as Draco tasted him that night in the Hall of Prophecy. Harry had dreamt about it of course, but the salt and bitter on his tongue hadn’t been a part of the dream at all.
“Are…You’re sure?”
“You can’t tell me this isn’t better than doing it the hard way.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Cassie was still talking.
He was still angry. Draco was obviously still angry too, kissing him biting and hard and frantic, none of his slow taunting, and it hurt—even more as Draco’s grip tightened in his hair, both of them groaning and gasping in sudden heat.
They awaited the arrival of their breakfast out in the tent’s cosy kitchen. When it had all arrived, Draco charmed their bottles frosty with two sharp taps of his wand, and they sat down at the round wooden table to eat. It didn’t take them very long, after several years at Hogwarts they were both more than capable of eating quickly when they needed to.
He chose one of the markers at random, the green one as it turned out, but before he did anything else Harry pushed down on the plastic bubbled button and both lights lit simultaneously.
“Right,” Harry agreed quickly, tucking it into his pocket and already trying to slip past the jittery wizard, and continue on his way to Hagrid’s. “I’ll be in touch.”
Harry found himself being propelled out of the main atrium toward the great golden gates of the Ministry’s lifts. He knew he ought to be objecting to this endeavor, but something kept his feet moving regardless.
Several long wordless seconds met his question. Then, huffing hushed exasperation, Draco set his teacup aside and crawled the small distance on the bed to take Harry’s away too, sending it floating wandlessly back to the tray. Harry didn’t have to guess too hard what he might be up to—there was a distinctly predatory look in the sunlit grey of his eyes—and it felt pretty good when Draco crawled nakedly into his lap.
“Oh, that idea.”
The little house Ginny and Harry now shared was honestly not much of a house at all. Magic had been used to patch-over the worst of its problems, but there were clearly some things even magic couldn’t fix.
“How would you—oh, nevermind. Lupin’s spawn, isn’t it?”
“Shut up. How could you go years not noticing you remember how to speak another language?”
“Did I do it too much? You’re still so…red.”
“Whatever,” Draco snapped with faint irritation, offhandedly charming his trousers clear of debris. “I told you I wanted to. Leave it.”
“Mmhm.”
“Come on, Potter. You can show me all around your bedroom next…”
Draco arched a questioning eyebrow at him, the fine strands of his hair frazzled from sleep. He was completely shirtless, wearing only a pair of silvery silk pyjama bottoms which left absolutely nothing to the imagination.
It stiffened under the attention—hard as Harry’s cock, which Draco now nipped a purposeful path toward.
It was rushed and a little frantic—once again, neither of them really had the patience to bother fully undressing. Harry had bent him over the kitchen table, and Draco had pushed himself back on Harry’s cock with an eager sort of shamelessness that Harry found completely irresistible.
“You could have some of mine?” he offered.
have the time to do them after we’ve got back. Once we’re done with them, of course then we’ll need to practise the wards and—”
Harry groaned softly as Draco shifted around to straddle him the other way.
“I’m still failing to see how any of this is remotely my problem.”
“Potter. It was nothing important.”
Trying to imagine what Draco being this tight might feel like on his cock was too much for him to take, so Harry focused on watching him for now, a light sheen of sweat forming as Draco began flushing faintly pink all over, rocking into Harry’s probing touch.
They kissed for a while longer before they parted, both breathing heavier than before.
“I’ve got some mint in the garden that might be alright.”
Many thanks for reading, and sticking with me if you're still entertained, and enjoy!
By then he had lost track of how far he’d gone entirely, before turning a corner to find a lone stretch of corridor blissfully clear of any other guests. At least, so far as he could tell.
Harry was a touch unsteady on his feet, and he was still taking most of Draco’s weight, but when Draco tipped his head back Harry nipped his way into kissing Draco’s soft and still-moaning lips as he pulled out.
“Fuck it, nevermind. Shall I?” he nodded toward Harry’s half-hardness.
Of course, not everything they were doing together was the right thing to do. The irony was not lost on him that their unlawful pursuits also happened to be the more morally honorable ones, but either way Harry was standing behind his decision to move forward. He knew it wasn’t yet too late for him to reconsider if he’d had any second thoughts—but he had none.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Between them there settled a silent acceptance of this, and Malfoy also seemed to take it as some sort of compliment, if the way he was smirking was any indication. But Harry’s mind was still spiralling with thoughts that he was now intent on sharing, whether or not Malfoy actually wanted to hear them.
“Where are we going then?”
Draco seemed to realise he might’ve said more than he intended—though it did not take him long to recover, and he was excellent at distracting Harry. Sliding up to him so smoothly it was frustratingly seductive, he left a step or so of space between them, but reached out to trail his fingers barely touching down Harry’s chest to rest at the button of his jeans.
“But?” Harry turned to look—now that no one was stopping him. He caught Malfoy dropping his robes and undoing the buttons at his wrists.
He saw Ginny edging over from the bar with his drink and one of her own, and he waited for her to join them before he launched into anything.
,” Harry moaned, Draco clenching tight all around him driving Harry to coming in hard, throbbing pulses.
“Fu-fucking god,” he gasped.
It was getting quite late, already quarter-past eleven, and Harry realised it would be a lot of work getting all the lamps and draperies installed where they were meant to be. When he pointed this out, Draco admitted he’d already been considering it, and decided they would shrink it all down with the tents in the morning, and do the installations onsite tomorrow, as they would need to do final inspections on all the illusions anyway.
Draco’s touch drifted lower. “What’s the matter? Scared the neighbours might see us?
But, as Hermione pointed out whenever he brought it up to complain about, nothing was more important than a solid foundation.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“But Pansy—”
It was a bit of a shock. Harry had forgotten all about his dreams, but at the mention some of it filtered back in bits and pieces. Had Malfoy been there in the dream? Or was his mind confusing now with what had happened inside his head?
As the two walked an unhurried path back to the Burrow, the dusk long since faded into proper night, Ron caught him with a question which stirred an immediate anxious tightening in Harry’s chest.
Harry fought off a strong urge to kiss him then—but a quick glance at the tall clock behind the desk indicated he had already been there for significantly longer than he had intended to stay.
Ron was fishing, and it sounded as if they’d been speculating what he might be up to. Harry’d really only been able to tell Hermione in his letters that they were working to improve conditions in the city for disadvantaged Muggles, he’d left a lot of the ‘how’ unsaid.
Harry was pretty sure that last bit wasn’t a proper word. Groaning through the tight clench of his jaw, he started slamming in as requested, filling the room with the loud smack of impacting skin, adding to a cacophony of broken voices and heavy panting.
Their mystified expressions were admittedly quite comical.
“Oh! Right of course, go on.”
Harry gave the issue a bit of thought, and decided what he probably needed was a change of scenery.
Harry braced to run. “Ready?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry spent his Monday at the Ministry as he always did, catching up on his paperwork, but as usual he was finding it difficult to keep his mind on the task. It kept wandering off, replaying conversations and moments he didn’t want to remember.
“I ought to,” Harry admitted. “You’ll let me know when you’re ready to work on the next bit?”
“That should be the right one.”
Once they’d spilled out onto the pavement, Savage was straight to business.
“How bad is it that Zabini knows we’ve been fucking?”
Snorting a quiet laugh, Harry spent a moment in thoughtful hesitation before posing the question he’d been wanting to ask since they’d walked in.
“It looks fucking incredible,” Harry admitted, pressing unconsciously closer as he worked his fingers gently in between as well—Draco’s grip tightened on his shoulders, but Harry didn’t tease him, he was as careful as he could be.
The tip of Harry’s cock was leaking slickly, even before Draco started tonguing at his taint again.
Some part of him, he knew, was looking for any way to avoid thinking about all of the people and all of the pain he had left behind him.
Not that he had to do much pulling, Draco kept up just fine. He had always been pretty good at running away. Having slightly longer legs, he nearly outpaced Harry, but after nearly a year of field training Harry knew these backstreets, so well he didn’t have to second guess where he was taking them, stumbling to a stop in a deserted intersection of narrow lanes.
“I’ll owl you with the latest once we’ve had a few days to get oriented—once I’ve got a feel for our new Chaser, and this year’s strategy of course…well, wish me luck.”
The part of the day taken up by ceremonies was mostly held on Hogwarts’ grounds, along the lake, which was the only place with room to put enough chairs for as many people as would likely attend. The wake would come later that evening, entirely unofficial, and taking place mostly in the various pubs of Hogsmeade, and the houses of anyone living in the village inclined to throw a party that night—of which there were several.
Huffing indignation, Harry gave up.
They practised spells in the library for nearly three hours, and without all that distracting tension humming between them, Harry found it a lot easier to retain the elaborate wand patterns he would need to learn for their spells to work. It was still very hard, and Harry huffed crossly more than once when he fucked it up—but when he did get it right, it was also incredibly satisfying.
Harry already felt lost, and then Draco made several more turns after that before they came upon a large iron archway, which opened up into a ridiculously tall atrium, its walls and ceilings all glass and iron as well.
“You’re pressing your luck, Malfoy.”
Draco laughed with a throaty sort of arrogance. “Yes well, that would be because I am.”
“Nothing. I was only wondering.”
your tongue,” he moaned dreamily.
Draco followed his gaze.
“Honestly. I’m on the verge of real progress here, the warding spells are nearly done.”
Harry hadn’t thought of that either. He chewed his lip a moment.
all the Malfoys are.”
A few more hours of casting later, and they were both so drained they were barely standing.
Draco’s lips curved a bit wickedly, and he did not hide the path of his eyes up Harry’s stretching form. “Very good work today.”
“I understand,” Ginny said softly. “I’m sorry.”
For a few ticks it looked as if Malfoy might protest, but he didn’t. Instead he wandered through the high grass a moment before locating a hidden stump, and proceeding to Transfigure it into a table which came to about waist-height.
As close as he was, Harry couldn’t miss the small twitch of amusement to Draco’s lips, before he gave up on Harry’s hair and stepped back.
He was still achingly hard, but too busy watching Draco panting through the afterburn of a powerful orgasm to do anything about it—
Gordon only went on cooing cheerily, awaiting Harry’s reply.
“I can try. And I’ve been meaning to speak with Cassie again too—I had thought, now that we’re looking for an actual location, she might have some insight where might be good. She was willing to help the last time.”
“I’ll run them through the usual checks if it would make you feel better about having them in the house.”
The buzz of the city’s bustle was familiar now, a strong breeze dancing between the buildings and persistently pushing at their backs. Not much sunlight was breaking through the low cloud-cover, but after a few days in a cavernous room full of nothing but mirrors and tents, it was nice just to be out and about again.
Harry answered by shifting down, biting tenaciously hard beneath his navel, and marking with his teeth until Draco’s arrogance was lost in lower moans.
“Let’s swap places,” Draco said, giving the head of Harry’s cock one last flick with his tongue before he was rising and working off his own trousers.
In the time it took Harry to take off his glasses, Draco had replied.
Harry had walked right into that trap, and completely unwilling to make that argument, he muttered a quiet ‘arsehole’ and shuffled off to the bathroom, Draco’s self-satisfied laugh following him down the tiny corridor.
Moaning something vaguely affirmative, Harry leaned into the lithely forward-push of him, until the heavy length of Draco’s cock rubbed at his stomach. Draco was quite bendy, and Harry was close enough now to tease over parted pink lips with his own, so completely surrounded in Draco’s heat it was provoking his already raging arousal to a furious intensity.
They stripped in the sitting room, then made for the shower, where Harry fucked him roughly against the shower wall until they both peaked into perfectly intense pleasure.
When he arrived in the Manor’s library, the room was all dark save for the low glow of the fire, and Harry had to light his wand to find the door.
Harry flushed softly. “Well, tell me if I fuck it up.”
He nearly dropped his wand, but Draco took it from his hand and tossed it onto the desk beside them.
“I forgot the bloody etiquette lessons,” he muttered, attempting to straighten his posture just the same. “Fine. Go on then, explain the unnecessary number of forks.”
Harry could feel how hard he came in the agonising clench all around his cock. He wished he could see Draco’s face caught up in it, but excruciating tightness and the indecent sound of Draco’s quivering moans were too much together, and Harry’s cock spurted inside him hot, hard, and profusely. For what felt like a dangerously long time his cock twitched with raw pleasure in Draco’s arse and Draco rode him, stuttered and lingering as they both gasped for breath, drawing out an immeasurable pleasure high.
“This is too close,” Draco protested. “I can’t see a thing.”
Neither of them got it perfectly, but as day became evening, they both decided they 'd better give it up for now. They'd been out there casting for several hours.
“I promised Ginny I’d make pasties tonight—I hadn’t realised how late it’s got to be.”
“I’ll try not to bother you before Wednesday,” he promised sheepishly.
After dinner, they set into the Extension Charms once again.
However, when they were nearly done, Draco broke their otherwise thoughtful silence a little urgently.
be using magic, the Secrecy—”
Harry nodded that way, and watched Draco Malfoy leisurely walk down his narrow hall into his tiny bathroom with the leaky taps to take a shower.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
A bit flustered, Cassie started pulling open drawers on her squat metal desk, looking for one with any spare space. “Sorry, my desk is rather messy.”
“That’s transparently false, Potter. Unless we miraculously obtain a Time Turner in the next few hours.”
Inhaling sharply, he experienced a flash of panic at the thought of exactly how
“Right, sorry,” he said sheepishly as he gently eased his cock out of the man beneath him. He whispered a cleaning spell for them and heard Draco’s quiet sigh as he sat back to pull his jeans up. “Thanks, for making the time.”
They hit the bedroom door and Harry pressed him up against it, groping for the doorknob but unwilling to stop sucking at the stretch of Draco’s neck his mouth landed on long enough to look what he was doing.
“Suggest them anyway.”
But rather than fuck off, Harry snickered tipsily, which only seemed to cause him to sulk more.
Groaning, Harry kicked fully out of his trousers and disentangled their lips, immediately throbbing with need at the soft sound of Draco's moaned protest.
When the sound of her steps on the floor above had quieted, Harry finally wandered his way out to the kitchen to start his (decaffeinated) tea.
Of course, Harry hadn’t been listening at all, too caught up in his own thoughts on how he shouldn’t want to be kissing Draco—now Draco’s lips were so soft, every breath on his neck so chill-inducing, it was even more impossible to focus—and surely Draco knew that.
Harry dropped the letter in shock, his heartbeat pounding abruptly in his ears. Scrambling to retrieve the parchment from the kitchen’s dusty floor, he crumpled it and shoved it into the nearest tea tin.
“All the better,” Malfoy drawled.
“C’mon, Malfoy. It can’t be all bad. You’ve got your…green stuff, there. Cheer up a bit.”
He said it so dismissively—nevertheless Harry felt a stir of interest in his trousers that he couldn’t control. He wasn’t sure he believed Draco was being completely honest, but Harry wasn’t about to argue with a compliment like that either. In fact—
Somewhat reluctantly, Harry took the proffered scrolls to scan them. “Are curtains really that essential?”
Draco took a step closer to him, his thumb running along the cut in question with an assessing narrow of silver eyes.
And Harry couldn’t take it anymore—he closed his lips around the head of Draco’s cock, rubbing the tip of his wand as rapidly as he could in Draco’s tight hold, over just the right spot.
It was a bit of a challenge, which of them might break first—and on this rare occasion Harry won and Draco flushed a touch pink in the cheeks.
“Bastard,” Harry muttered, and went to take a long shower.
“I’ll be more thankful to get out flying properly, not sorting whatever latest explosion’s embedded itself in the ceiling.”
“Tried to sneak him a hat once,” Draco said with a wry smile. “Didn’t work, though. It had to be Father then.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
For the first time since May, Harry would be completely on his own.
“When are we looking at lots then?”
“You can say no.”
“Don’t mention it, Potter. I’ve had the time to spare,” he cut him off abruptly, sounding a bit bristled before immediately changing the subject. “What’ve you brought to practice on?”
“As much as I would like to take advantage of you right now, in numerous ways, I haven’t the energy to lift my head—so it will all have to wait.”
Once they made it to the ballroom they popped into the tent nearest the doors, incidentally one of Harry’s again, and Harry immediately collapsed on a pumpkin-coloured, over-cushioned settee, ideal for a nice lie-down.
“Potter, how do you even know that?”
Humming a low acknowledgement, Harry edged with his teeth a touch harder, and Draco thrust past the sharpness. The luridly drawn-out depth of his moan stood Harry’s cock to hard attention, tenting the worn cotton of his bottoms.
“Interesting,” Harry teased with the sort of naturally charming half-grin that seemed to get Draco all hot and bothered.
orbs, it had completely slipped his mind that magic light balls would obviously not be an option for any future residents.
Draco had taken on an almost deadened level of emotion that Harry found somewhat distressing, though apparently not distressing enough to change the subject.
It helped that some of the Field Training Harry was allowed to participate in was growing more complex—and riskier.
His voice was so hushed and even, Harry found it impossible to read him—and apparently, he wasn’t allowed to look either. He also couldn’t really deny to himself what Malfoy being so close was doing to him.
“Not much,” Harry admitted. “And I haven’t got it quite right yet either.”
He’d also spent a ridiculous amount of galleons—the exchange rates hadn’t been the greatest after the war—buying out the tent sections of several shops in the city. It might’ve been a bit excessive, but then he hadn’t really been using the gold anyway. It had been sitting in his vault doing nothing productive, and Harry was very happy to put it toward something useful.
