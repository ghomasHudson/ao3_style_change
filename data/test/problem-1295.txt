He glances away, scratching at the back of his neck. ‘Ron. Ginny says…anyway, it was my fault. It’s not about you.’
‘Ah ha,’ she says, and grins, pulling out several spare quill nibs she keeps ready. ‘There,’ she says, once the chairs are transfigured. ‘What do you think?’
Instant regret swarms through him. His shoulders tighten and he sits back on his knees. He can’t even
Draco glances up, weighing the box between his hands again, and says (in a brighter voice than he’s had in days), ‘books.’
‘Oh yes,’ nods Earnie. ‘Professor McGonagall was very astute to pair them together. After all, Harry’s goodwill can only do Malfoy some good.’
‘I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,’ she falters, as her eyes meet Harry’s and she turns scarlet.
The pile of tangled blankets and limbs twitches, and Poppy coughs expectantly, drawing the attention of one of the two sleeping boys.
He steps up to the boundary around the ice-rink, leaning over to peer at the smooth ice stretched out before them. He wrinkles his nose.
She flattens herself on her broom. On the other side of the pitch, two beaters—one from Slytherin and one from Gryffindor—push their brooms to the limit. But none of them are going to get there in time. Ginny throws her weight into her broom and wishes Fred and George were still here. She tries to judge where they’re going to fall, but she’s never been very good at predicting trajectory of a falling body.
The keeper shakes his head. ‘I must admit, though I’ve often wished for the power to converse with my charges, I don’t envy the prejudice that comes with it. It’s not right the way they’re treated.’
Whatever Harry was going to say is lost to the perplexing expression that replaces his uncertainty. He and Neville take the scrolls addressed to each of them and the girl stumbles back out of the compartment.
Again, his gaze flicks to Draco and away again. He clears his throat and says awkwardly, ‘I suppose I should go…’
Hermione coughs pointedly and tries not to roll her eyes. Honestly. Ron could be so hopeless sometimes.
Silence that echoes with the muted tone of disbelief descends on the room; until Severus, never one to keep his temper, erupts with, ‘you used an
Draco ignores him, unfolding the letter. It’s unsigned, but Draco would recognise that messy scrawl anywhere.
have been enough time to figure out some little Muggle item, but seeing as Hannah is still not one hundred percent sure what the function of the strange L-shaped black object actually was, she’s obviously underestimated how easy this would be.
‘Morning tea then,’ says Potter, waving a hand at him. ‘C’mon, you can’t tell me you aren’t dying for a coffee. Besides, Hagrid doesn’t mind, do you?’
He glances at Harry, who looks a little shell-shocked, as if he can’t believe his own daring. He’s flushed and wide eyed and he bites his lip and fucking hell Draco is ready to go all over again.
Without a word, without so much as a single look at anyone else, Malfoy slips the photo into the pocket of his robes. He casually flicks through the last of the photos, and, with one last arching of his eyebrow, he hands the pile back to Colin.
Potter steps after Malfoy, reaching out as if to touch the boy’s shoulder only to stop and let his hand fall.
Harry sighs but doesn’t answer. Draco takes it as a sign that he’s forgiven and shoots Weasley a smug look, just for good measure.
Only that was the problem, wasn’t it? There was no fix. Poppy rubs her head and considers, yet again, telling Albus. Maybe there was something he knew that could help?
Of course, Draco misses his father, yet Narcissa senses some sort of conflict within him. With this in mind, her second guess is his mission.
He trudges over to the window and pushes it open, leaning his elbows on the pane and gazing out into the fading afternoon light.
Hannah tries not to watch them, but it’s hard not to. She sighs, and swings her bag up onto her shoulder. As she’s leaving, though, she hears Harry behind her say,
‘I—’ Harry’s gaze flicks to Draco and away again quickly. He crosses his arms. ‘So? What’s that got to do with what Nott did?’
‘Of course we are,’ says Ginny, her eyes flashing. ‘I certainly won’t be with someone who thinks I’m capable of
The voice comes from somewhere ‘round his elbow, and Hagrid has to shuffle back a pace to see the wee little thing standing at his side. He beams when he sees those familiar blue eyes gazing up at him.
her hex up close too. Except he has a point. It wasn’t as if Harry was the only one there when Diagon Alley was attacked. He certainly wasn’t the only student.
This, at least, garners a reaction. Draco’s gaze flicks up at Blaise, narrowed and irritated. ‘I would, if you all didn’t keep irritating me while I’m trying to concentrate.’
Surprise flashes across Blaise’s face, right before he bursts into a loud guffaw. ‘He’s got you pegged,’ he says to Draco, sniggering.
A smile brighter than any he’d ever seen from Draco lit his face. He squeezed Harry’s hand and said, ‘again.’
‘Hm,’ she says. She nods, and turns around, walking away from him. ‘He’s in the Owlery,’ she says, waving her hand over her shoulder at him. ‘He’s a little dense at the moment so make sure you talk slow.’
‘It was working yesterday,’ grumbles Malfoy, stabbing his wand at the little rectangular box he’s holding.
Weasley shakes his head. He shakes it again. Finally, with what seems like a monumental effort of what limited braincells he has, Weasley gets the hint. He turns sharply and takes off.
The confusion vanishes from Hermione’s face, replaced by sudden understanding and a small chuckle of amusement. The rest of them frown.
He leans up on his elbows, shifting so he’s not quite on top of Harry anymore and the minute he does Harry shuffles backwards, pushing himself up into a sitting position and away from Draco. Confused, and a little hurt, Draco follows suit.
Harry is still leaning back on one arm, half sprawled across the floor, his hair a mess and his lips swollen and pink. He blinks twice, his eyes dilated and his chest rising and falling rapidly beneath the thin, half unbuttoned shirt. Draco stares at him, trying to keep his eyes from straying to the rather obvious bulge in Harry’s pants, but unable to quite tear his gaze away the boy.
Luna hides a smile and turns to the bookshelf closest to her. The boys do the same, though only Malfoy is looking seriously, peering at the titles with a soft little frown.
, you’re about to head home where you’ll no doubt have to give a progress update, and instead of trying to
The Boy nods, though he doesn’t look happy. He is tense. If he was a snake, he would be coiled into a tight ball, his tail shuddering—warning off any who approach.
He’s just starting to contemplate dragging himself up to bed when an owl sweeps into the room, dropping a letter into the open pages of his books.
Wrackspurts are in the air. It is obvious, if one knows the signs to look for. Of course, few people do, but Luna is one of those special few blessed with the ability to believe in anything one put their mind to—wrackspurts being one such thing. Therefore, seeing as she is so adept at believing the unbelievable, she often perceives a great many things before others.
‘You might not feel tired now, but you will. Mr Potter will be fine without you to…pat his hair,’ says the woman dryly, eyeing Ginny’s hand.
Harry chuckles again, jostling Draco’s head with the movement of it, and runs a hand through Draco’s hair. ‘You’d never let me forget,’ he says, his voice light and amused.
Harry’s eyes go wide behind his glasses, making the green more prominent than usual. He gapes at Zach, but doesn’t manage to say anything. Beside him, Malfoy has gone very, very still.
Colin shrugs. ‘Well, yeah. I mean, you were both getting along really well and I know that can be hard for the two of you and, I didn’t want him to think I was spying, or to think you were setting him up or something like that. I just…I didn’t want to ruin anything. Especially if you two are…getting along now.’
Harry's throat was closing. He could not speak anymore. His best friends could have untied themselves, it was not a difficult task for them but he saw understanding in their eyes. He untied them because he did not have the energy to even hold his wand anymore.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to breathe. His mental stupor was interrupted by an impatient tapping.
"Who were they?" The words were growled and they were spoken by Ronald. Draco was surprised to hear so much anger in his voice .
Malfoy opens her mouth and mutters, "He-" just when dad says in a clear and loud voice, "You will be my lead actress, Ms. Malfoy." and Malfoy shuts her mouth, her gazing desperately eyes at him.
"I will get the stupid owl. Wait over here." Draco mumbled and crawled out of the bed. Harry let him go after a soft kiss on his lips and a soft "Good morning."
The laugh belonged to Fred, as was evident from the gold earring that he wore in his right ear. Potter was sitting between the twins today. Actually, she was
"You know what's odd?" Hermione asks absently, her eyes distant the way they got when she was trying to figure a puzzle out.
"As I was saying, after my sentence, when I returned and stayed with Severus for a few days, Sirius visited a few times and he tried to... become intimate with me."
"No. Harry. Stop." Draco protested in a week voice and Harry wished he could but his lips wouldn't stop their journey.
Morning dawned and Draco opened his eyes. He blinked twice. His eyes burned a bit. With a jolt everything that happened the last night hit him and he fumed internally at his display of weakness.
Severus glares at her, "Get out you insolent child and return with your godmother. I have things to do."
"You will get an infection. It is possible that you already have an infection. How can you so irresponsible and unhygienic? " Draco stopped and looked at him questioningly.
"Mr. Potter, please save my daughter. Please." These words belong to Narcissa. She is crying frantically. Lucius is still quiet, perhaps because he knows that Harry will rescue Draco.
"Me too. " Narcissa whispered and buried her face in his chest. Merlin knew that he shouldn't allow her to break down like this but he couldn't stop her.
A knock on the door brought her back from her musings and for the first time, she realised that she wasn't in her bedroom. She looked around. There was a wardrobe but it was black instead of brown and slightly larger too. There was a mirror and it did not have the crack that her mirror had. Even the windows were larger than her windows.
Without even waiting for Harry's reply, Draco walked towards his bar table and looked at the open bottle of his vodka. Harry's mouth burst open in shock when Draco picked up the bottle and dropped in on the floor. He just dropped it and the glass scattered everywhere.
"You can scold me if you want." Harry whispered and Draco finally shouted angrily at him "You have turned our house into a large dustbin. You are messier than a child and you never think of the repercussions at all."
"It's most certainly not my fault." Draco replied furiously and accioed his own wand, just to be prepared.
"Oh no. Let me rephrase it. It was a crush, not an obsession." Ron mutters, her eyes knowing and Harry shoots up, his cheeks warm.
Albus is doing his internship under Draco. Maybe he should try legilimency on Draco as well. He did it with dad and dad didn't even notice. Granted dad was asleep when Albus sneaked inside dad's mind and he is not an expert in occlumency. It's worth a try.
Draco took her to Florean Fortesque instead of the candy shop because he knew that children prefer ice creams. He wanted her to loosen up a bit so that she would tell him everything. He entered the ice cream parlour, her small hands in his as he searched for a table which was not surrounded by many people. They ordered their ice creams and sat down. She seemed happy with her choice and told him that he ice cream was absolutely delicious. Her excitement delighted him.
Harry doesn't know what to do. He can't leave her alone and he can't call anyone over. She won't even meet her godfather or Sirius. Narcissa is out of question.
"See if I touch you again Draco." The words escaped Harry's mouth as he stared at the ceiling, laid down on the bed. Draco was on the entryway of the bathroom when he spoke and the blonde froze before replying, "I apologise. You have to understand Harry that I have-"
Draco takes off the cloak and walks towards Potter, her eyes carefully away from father or Severus. She looks at the dark lord who stares back at her. Potter is standing with a sword in one hand and his wand in other. A strangled moan escapes Draco's mouth as she relives what he did to her, how he ruined her completely.
They glared at each other for a minute, after which Harry snapped at him "I will not sign the papers."
"You are not god and you can commit mistakes. You realized yours and I forgive you because I love you."
"I am also sorry for what dad did and what grandfather-. Although grandfather is still bad, my daddy has changed a lot. He hates violence and he is sorry." Harry's eyes turned towards little Tessa. She was looking at him warmly and perhaps her innocent eyes did the trick. He hugged the girl and murmured "I forgive your daddy and I will never punish you for what he did."
It doesn't remove the disgust she feels towards herself for letting this monster touch her. She wants this to end.
"Are you going to say anything or am I just wasting my time here?" Severus muttered sharply and Harry stared at the fireplace quietly, his eyes angry.
"Draco, you know my relatives did not trust me with anything. I wanted them to love me and trust me. But they did not love me. They turned my life into a hell. Ever since I have understood love, I have been in love with you. Your trust Draco. that's all I want. You can take as much time as you want but you have to stop hurting yourself." Harry stopped and breathed deeply "You don't trust me with your protection and I think that perhaps Vernon was right. I am useless and worthless. I must be if my husband does not trust me."
With tears in his eyes and resolution in his mind, he stood up to wash his face and clear all the evidence of his break down.
"So, where are you staying?" Harry asked Sirius as they settled down. Sirius's hair were dishevelled and his eyes as blue as ever. He was looking fit and his eyes were on the bulge of Draco's trousers. He was sitting in front of Draco and him.
"One more word and you will have no mouth to speak at all, Lucius. He did everything in his hands to search Draco. There was no way to search him. You were busy paying for your sins in bloody Azkaban when you should have been here, helping your son. It's your fault in the first place for keeping him ignorant about muggles."
He did not want anything to do with Harry. Not that that ever stopped Severus, Hermione or Ron from pushing him towards the man. He didn't want to spoil the day anymore than it already had been spoiled so he started jogging again. Of course, fate was watching him from somewhere and laughing at him because right then he heard a familiar voice.
"SHUT UP," Petunia screamed and stood up so suddenly that her chair fell back. She turned her face to look at Dudley but the boy wasn't here and then she suddenly realized that the smell had become stronger. It was unbearable now. She couldn't breathe and so she took deep breathes and covered her nose with her palm.
"They had a son, didn't they?" Asks Vernon. Petunia looks away. Lily's son has her eyes and she doesn't want to look at him. She doesn't want to meet him, not because she would miss her freak of a sister even more but because that Lily's son is a freak too. She hates freaks.
Very slowly Lucius turned around lifted his right hand and placed it in display of everyone. Surprisingly, Harry noticed that he was not wearing any rings at all, not even the Malfoy signet.
He looks exactly like his father. Yet the difference between the father and son leaves Harry astounded. Scorpius settles down across from him and places his hand on Harry's. It's warm and comforting.
"I'm busy right now," He says, trying to keep his voice steady, trying not to let his anger overpower him.
"Yes. Let's go." Draco murmured determinedly and locked the wards the house before they apparated to 'Number 4 Privet Drive- Dursley Residence.
"MALFOY." She shouted and his eyes cleared a bit. She continued "He is alive. He will live. He has injuries and won't be able to walk for a while. He won't take help from Ron or me. He needs you here, Malfoy. Are you coming or not?"
His friends murmured "We will prepare tea in the kitchen. " but he paid no attention to them speaking to Draco instead "I am so sorry Draco. So sorry."
"Draco - Draco Malfoy," Draco said honestly and the man's eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Draco took the advantage of his speechlessness and turned around and fled the room. He couldn't apparate from the ministry so he ran as fast as he could, ignoring the polite, "Good morning, Lucius," or "slow down, Malfoy."
"Potter and me. It's ridiculous." Draco drawled, "I am a freelance detective. I don't take orders. In fact, I need someone who can follow my orders. Potter and Weasley won't do. They can't take orders."
He nodded, grinning "Yes. I think you must move from here. I think she does not like living here." and Dudley agreed "Yes. I am sure."
"He looks so terrified and I am so worried for him Professor." Harry spoke and Severus shook his head, placing his hands on the table "He is not scared of anyone. Call me Severus by the way. On another note let me tell you that Draco is not scared. Draco has become very short tempered with years. You have not seen it because he had been at home for the past few weeks. Soon enough he will get an invitation from a business house or French ministry or perhaps some rich entrepreneur wanting to sell his potions and then you will know."
He had just finished the sentence when someone knocked on the door. Draco's eyes widened. Black's face lost its colour and he stared at the door with eyes that could barely conceal his horror.
"Dad wants breakfast," Dudley said. His voice was deep and his tone was bland. It was impossible to judge what he was thinking. Slowly, other things started registering her mind. There was a smell in the room - not very strong but there. She looked around and searched for the calendar and then gasped when she saw that it was 24th August 2029. It had been 23rd August 2019 when she had slept. What was happening?
All of a sudden the magic that had enveloped them was gone and he was back on his feet. Harry was sweating and his body ached with need and he felt so bereft that he simply stared at his husband desperately.
Draco walked towards the man and they looked at each other. Draco's eyes were calm and Harry's were burning and suddenly Harry pulled him by his hips. Draco gasped, startled by the sudden movement. He relaxed when he found himself in Harry's close embrace. Harry's hands were trailing all over his body, though they had not yet crawled inside his shirt or trousers.
"Hey Harry. You awake?" Says Ron. Harry doesn't reply. He turns to look at his best friend though. Ron is tying his laces.
That’s all it takes. Draco’s mental energy is frantic, but he’s too focused on Potter now to stop the memories. Everything he doesn’t want Severus to see comes rushing to the forefront of his mind.
He waves his hand, and a moment later, a small blanket spreads out across the frosty grass. He drops down and looks up at Harry expectantly. Bemused, but curious, Harry drops down onto the blanket beside him.
from thoughts of Potter, not get stuck starkers in a shower stall while the blithering idiot talked to himself.
This time Theo looks back, and there’s a smidge of amusement lurking in the depths of his usually bland expression. He glances at the ruined potion, bubbling a furious indigo instead of the soft simmering orange it’s supposed to be, and gestures to his own potion.
Harry glances up and shrugs. ‘Actually, it wasn’t that bad,’ he says. ‘I mean, I was feeling kinda bad anyway, about skipping out on Hagrid’s class.’
sure as hell wouldn’t want anyone knowing that I liked blokes. You know, if I was. Not that I do, mind you.’
‘What? If that little twat didn’t want to get hexed she shouldn’t have tried to change who you are.’
Her footsteps trail off, however, (Minerva’s faltering just a step behind her) when she sees the two boys.
‘I…almost,’ says Harry, and disappointment makes his body go tense. ‘It’s just…every time I get near to, you know, I hear
For a moment, Draco can’t move. He doesn’t know what to do. He simultaneously wants to hug Harry, and hunt down his aunt and murder her in her sleep.
Ginny can only gape. Harry is still watching Malfoy saunter away. There’s a smile hiding in the corners of his lips, not quite showing, but she sees it. Knows what it means. She dumps the two drinks on a nearby table and stalks over to him.
‘Yeah, you are,’ says Theo, throwing down his quill and glaring at the lot of them. ‘And that’s exactly the way he likes it. Friendship isn’t something that Draco
‘Yes, he kept it from us,’ says Hermione, cutting him off with that calm-but-exasperated tone of voice she did so well. ‘But did you stop to think that maybe there was a
, back there? That was flirting! And don’t tell me you weren’t checking him out as he was walking away.’
Without hesitation Draco surges forward and wraps Harry in a tight hug, squeezing until the tension goes out of Harry’s shoulders.
They spend twenty minutes trailing through the winged horse section. Hagrid and Malfoy actually manage to hold a conversation over by the Abraxan heard, while Potter looks on in amusement, idly sipping his coffee and absently petting one of the foals that has come up to him. Neither of the other two notice.
Harry Potter, too busy grinning at something Draco has said, takes a step back into the walkway, not watching where he’s going, and bumps
Hands wrap around Romilda’s shoulders, yanking her forward into that overpowering smell of grass, coffee and treacle. Lips press firm against her’s, hot and almost rough with insistence.
She steps out into the hallway beyond the common room and almost instantly feels worse. She shudders, rubbing her arms in the tepid air. She starts walking with every intention of heading for the grounds, desperate to get out in the fresh air, to kick her shoes off and bury her toes in the squishy, lush grass of the grounds, to spread her arms, throw her head back and soak in the warmth of the afternoon sun.
Ginny lifts her head out of her hand. ‘Not yet?’ she says in a soft voice. ‘You want to find a cure to an incurable disease?’
With a reluctant sigh, he scrunches up his nose, opens his mouth and places the small leaf under his tongue.
‘Yes, detention,’ she says, studying her nails. ‘I half wonder if you didn’t do that on purpose. You certainly seem to be inventing any excuse you can to see him.’
Unable to think of a way to bring the conversation back to Dumbledore in a way that would tell her what she wants to know, Tonks lets the conversation fall flat.
He turns so his back is against the wall again, his shoulder almost against Malfoy’s. Without looking at him, Malfoy reaches over and takes Potter’s hand.
In truth, she’s so tired she’s not sure how much longer she can keep treading water. She’s not had a lot of experience with swimming, and the task is harder than she’d thought.
Annoyed that he’s once again lying to her, Hermione debates telling him to figure it out himself. Then she sees the nervous way he’s still picking at the armchair, and the confusion warring with the embarrassment on his face and takes pity on him.
Malfoy shakes his head, chuckling darkly. ‘Don’t pretend like you’re not jumping for joy. He wouldn’t be doing this if—’ Malfoy cuts off, looking away sharply.
There was meant to be a little bit more to this chapter, but I decided to cut it since this was getting long and I was starting to struggle with Tonks' POV. Next chapter we'll find out about the last stop at the Zoo and what their task is for the rest of CoMC.
Pod blinks once, and then, with deliberate slowness, dips his head low, crouching on his front legs to lower himself to Potter’s height. He looks Potter square in the eyes and lets out a soft, humming breath straight into Potter’s face, blowing his hair back.
‘Stupid Filch,’ Harry mumbles, and drops his head onto the other boy’s shoulder. ‘Hm. You smell good.’
‘We are, however,’ comes Minerva’s voice, somewhat more temperate than Poppy’s, ‘working on alternative.’
It bangs into the back of the next row of cabinets, and Ron sighs, leaning his arm along the top of the cabinet and using one hand to pull out a small book at random.
In a moment, the boxes are transfigured into a stout, square, wooden table. She frowns, eyeing the table and glancing around the room again. She sighs, finding nothing else to transfigure, and digs around in her bag.
‘Do you need a hand, Lav?’ asks the Patil sister from where she’s finished packing up her own things.
Neville almost doesn’t hear the last half of her speech. ‘Four?’ he says. ‘But that’s…that’s the rare species house.’
Zabini shrugs and stuffs his hands into his pockets, leaning against the wall with a contemplative smile. ‘Hell, I think they’re friends and they’re hiding it. Or at the very least they’re getting along but pretending not to be.’
She reaches the edge of the one empty bed, and the one full one. She resists the urge to roll her eyes, annoyed at herself for forgetting about Potter’s crush, annoyed for not considering that it might be reciprocated. She makes a mental note to ensure wards are placed around their beds from now on.
He huffs and reaches for his wand, intending on drying off, only to remember that Professor McGonagall took it to ensure he didn’t cheat his detention.
Tonks tilts her head. She follows behind them by a few metres, watching as the Slytherin boy trails after Potter toward the ice-cream cart, his posture still that of a young, pureblood born to money and comfort—used to getting everything he wanted. Still, there’s not that usual arrogance she’s come to associate with pureblooded families.
Though the room has obviously been enlarged, it’s not enough to hold more than twenty odd people, and even then it’s cramped. Obviously they don’t get a lot of viewers to the snake exhibit and Tonks can see why.
Tonks moves, putting herself between the now split group, leaning against the side of a map of the park and pretending to check the time. As if waiting to meet someone.
She moves out of the way and, glancing back to make sure he’s ready, she releases the boggart from the cupboard.
‘You might want to take into consideration that Potter’s actions saved your life,’ says Minerva tartly.
Potter shrugs again. ‘Accused me of being Dumbledore’s man,’ he says, and a faint frown furrows his brow.
Lisa leans up slightly in her chair, trying to catch a glimpse of the title of the book. ‘Me too,’ she says distractedly, tilting her head to read the words, wondering desperately who “Matilda” was and why she needed a whole book?
The hunger is still there in Potter’s eyes, but there’s something else, something that makes Potter tense as a coiled spring. Something that makes Draco wary.
what you focus on. The touching. Nails dragging along your back. Lips whispering in your ear. Delicious things. Like keeping going. Don’t stop. I want you.’
There’s some shuffling, the distinct rustle of clothes dropping to the floor, and light footsteps as Potter heads to one of the stalls at the other end of the bathroom. Draco snorts.
‘Are we going to have an issue here?’ Poppy calls, before Weasley can start the fight he’s building up to.
‘I want you to put this in your mouth,’ she says evenly. ‘Don’t swallow it, just keep it there, under your tongue.’
There’s no more helplessness. No more misery. No more furious need for revenge. All that remains is cold emptiness.
‘That’s better,’ Poppy says, her tone calm but reprimanding. ‘Honestly, you’re acting like children. Are you sixth years or not?’
‘Dunno. Stupid git’s just making more work for the rest of us of course. Not like him, though, is it? Why isn’t he out there bullying first-years?’
punishment—something I don’t deserve, mind you.’ He accents this statement by throwing Potter a particularly scathing look.
Romilda glowers at her. Thoroughly annoyed by whatever joke the two siblings are trying to play on her she turns to storm away, only to come almost nose to nose with Harry.
Harry sinks to the shifting floor, slipping out of Malfoy’s grasp, his breath hitching. ‘I…I can’t—’
Ron feels dizzy. He sits down hard in his chair, staring up at Harry as everything comes crashing down around him.
These boys were fourth, maybe fifth years. Harry and Malfoy were both older, stronger, and more experienced. Particularly when it came to magic fights.
Hermione shakes her head. ‘You told us last time that when Dumbledore went to see him, he was already cruel and he liked to hurt people. That he kept trophies. Harry, does that sound like you? You kind and caring and
‘Look I…I feel like we didn’t really get to talk yesterday. I know I’ve been a git and your still angry, and I get that, but, can’t we stop fighting? I’m trying. Really. I can’t promise Malfoy and I will ever be friends but—Harry?’
She takes a deep steadying breath, prepares a smile, and turns to him. ‘I love it,’ she says, managing to keep the tears from her voice. ‘It’s beautiful.’
His mind jumps back to the fight in the hallway, where he’d snogged Potter against the hallway wall much like this. Sure they’d kissed since then, but not with the same fervour, and Merlin, Draco hadn’t realised how badly he’d wanted to do it again until this moment.
Harry groans and covers his face again, leaning on his elbows. Ginny laughs and shoves at his shoulder.
Potter wasn’t switching sides—regardless of whoever he had a crush on—he just didn’t want hurt anyone; and there was certainly no crime in that.
Vince chuckles. He’s sitting against the headboard of his bed, flicking through a limited edition of
Blaise rolls his eyes and abandons crushing the ingredients. It’s doomed now anyway, and besides, Draco’s scurrying to the ingredients cupboard has caught Potter’s attention. Green eyes track Draco’s movements, and Potter’s gaze isn’t as hostile as it once used to be. It’s soft, and confused, and almost…Blaise wants to say worried. But why on earth would
to stay and watch you feed yourself to a plant, this situation seems to be causing Potter here some distress. So, how about you try not to become plant food, and we figure out what it’s gonna cost for you to stay quiet about all of this.’
She shrugs, looking toward the house, her mind flashing back to the various run-in’s she’s had with school mates. ‘Occasionally.’
Mad-Eye’s magical eye swivels in it’s socket, racing around the room and seeing god knows what, until it latches on Remus himself. Mad-Eye scowls, gesturing with his head for Remus to hurry up.
Potter, turning sharply, sees what’s happened and goes pale. ‘Shit, sorry! I’m sorry—Hang on,’ he yanks out his wand and with a flick of his wand (and a flinch from Malfoy) the hot liquid is gone.
The push is all she needs. She reaches up and latches onto the broom. Dean holds it steady, making sure she doesn’t drag it back down into the water with her. She tries not to groan, but she gets her other arm over the broom and somehow, somehow, manages to clamber back on the broom.
that he’s somehow managed to slip passed Snape. Greg suspects the only reason the conversation has managed to grab Vince’s attention away from the racey magazine is the topic.
Potter flushes bright pink and, just for a moment, Theo can almost understand why Draco is so infatuated with the idiot. Then he remembers what would happen if any of their parents found out about this little meeting and cold sweeps through him.
Poppy frowns. There’s no hint of foul play. No hexes, curses or jinxes. Not residue potion. Not tell-tale signs of a fight. He’s perfectly healthy.
‘It does,’ says Draco, leaning back on one hand. ‘I mean, Theo said it, right? Girls are supposed to be classy.’
‘I have to say,’ she says, eyeing Ron with a smile, ‘I am impressed with how well you’re taking this.’
Harry has at least moved out of his bed. He sits by one of the windows, his back to the door as he stares out at the grounds. Ron thinks he can see the Quidditch pitch and wonders if Harry wishes he was there as much as Ron does.
A commotion by the door catches their attention, and the students crowding by the door hurriedly back away as dust and leaves explode outward.
Harry sits up straight and it’s the liveliest Hermione has seen him in days. Except there’s a tightness around his mouth and eyes. He clenches his jaw, a reaction she recognises as him trying to hide pain.
‘Well for starters it just doesn’t make any logical sense,’ says Draco, and he sits up in a sudden surge of movement, straightening to face Blaise. ‘Matilda was the book whose magic was the same as ours. Granted, she didn’t have a wand, but then, neither did Howl. But
Potter casts Malfoy one last doubtful look, shakes his head and follows Hagrid through the small gate and the thin, imperceptible layer of magic shielding the Zoo from the prying eyes of Muggles.
‘Believe it,’ says Ron, chuckling as he taps the photos spread across the table they’re gathered at. ‘And pay up.’
‘Now, first,’ she says when they’ve both finished. ‘You’re going to tell me exactly what happened earlier today. Then, you’re going to explain everything else.’
Greg snorts. Draco shoots him a glare and Greg promptly refocuses on the bag of marshmallows he’s steadily working through.
Albus looks trapped and Minerva’s smile widens, like she’s just eaten a full packet of Canary Creams. He tries not to sigh, but Minerva sees his shoulders sag just a little.
Harry’s heart hammered wildly, but something hot and desperate coiled through him, filling him with adrenaline and making him brave. Bold.
Potter’s enjoyment in this situation is palpable. He settles back in his chair, smirking, and gestures at the book in Malfoy’s hands.
‘And normally when something like this class situation happens, Draco gets all fired up and outraged and just generally causes everyone endless amounts of headaches for
He sits at the end of the couch, staring about with that utterly lost look, like a house elf that has lost it’s master. Pansy rolls her eyes. Honestly, he could at least
Harry, as Albus predicted, is right there hovering at the edge of the bed. Behind him, interestingly, are the rest of the sixth year Slytherin boys (excepting Mr Vincent Crabbe, who had missed the mornings excitements due to a previously arranged rendezvous with Miss Millicent Bulstrode), each in varying stages of shock judging from the looks on their faces. Without breaking stride, Poppy waves her free hand and four blocks of chocolate whiz across the room toward the four students, her wandwork not faltering in the least at this feat of double spellwork.
‘Well,’ says Potter, and scrubs a hand through his hair. ‘That explains that. I just…I never thought I could be both. Hell I never thought I was gay until…until…’
‘Gods yes,’ Draco says, eyes flying open for just a moment. ‘Just, hang on, adjust your hand a bit—yeah, like that and, uh,
Vince shrugs again. ‘A while,’ he says. ‘I mean, it wasn’t often at first. She was a bit nervous, so she didn’t really like it. Well, I mean, she did, but she didn’t.’
Neville jumps, stepping hurriedly out of the way as a very irritated Draco Malfoy stalks into the room, an impressive scowl plastered on his pointy, pale face.
love it. But a pang of regret wedges in her throat. Oh, Andromeda would know how to talk to Draco about whatever was bothering him. How she wishes she could floo her sister to ask for advice. But the mere thought of that is folly. Especially with Bella sitting across from her.
Draco doesn’t react. He simply takes a deep breath and lets go of Luna’s hand. He steps down onto the stairs, bypassing Ron without a word, without a single look, and heads back down into the castle. He pauses on the last stair, turning back to frown up at them.
Severus raises his eyebrow again, and feels like it’s going to get permanently stuck in that position. ‘Because she wanted to make sure you’d be
of the danger, but that’s what makes her so awesome. She’s strong and independent and that’s great, really, except…except she’s his
Harry’s fists clench but Nott continues, stepping closer despite (or perhaps because of) Albus’ shield. Albus wavers on the edge of intervening. Poppy too, he can see, wants to step in, but he shoots her a look to stop her and she holds herself back, pursing her lips. The shield is still strong between them, and Albus is curious to see how it will play out. Curious to see how much they will reveal.
‘For whatever reason?’ asks Zabini doubtfully. He snorts and shakes his head. ‘Potter’s about as subtle as an ox.’
The conversation goes quiet, and by the time Hermione comes around the corner of the bookshelves they’re both gone.
Draco merely raises an eyebrow and shifts his attention to Blaise. Blaise straightens, crossing his arms and leaning against the end of his bedpost.
Harry frowns at her, and she thinks—for one heart stopping moment—that she’s gone too far by speaking up. That she’s alienated him from
‘Why doesn’t it bother you?’ he asks, sitting back on the floor. ‘Weasley’s treating you like shit and you’re just…taking it. Like he’s not doing anything wrong.’
He’s right. The fire moves as if it’s alive. Sweeping over a pile of junk, crackling and sizzling and popping as various odds and ends burn within the heat.
He shakes his head, tries to put Malfoy’s bizarre turn of character out of his mind, and focuses on the one important thing Malfoy said.
Draco’s gaze flicks to her, then across at Potter. His he frowns, grey eyes narrowed, but he doesn’t say anything. There’s no disparaging commentary, no snide remark. Not even a scowl or sneer of disgust. He merely says, ‘Unfortunately,’ in a lazy tone and looks away again.
Draco stares, storm grey eyes roiling with emotion, his face pale and desperate and furious. Theo thinks for a minute that Draco might challenge him. Might call his bluff and tell him to shove off. He doesn’t though. He can’t. Theo realises this just as Draco’s shoulders slump. He can’t risk it. Because Theo is right.
. Last night he apparated himself inside the fridge and I only found him because he was laughing so bloody much. He was
Inevitably, his path leads him to there and he shuffles toward Potter in inches, as if he doesn’t want to intrude on the conversation Potter is clearly enjoying but can’t help being curious about it.
Colin, flushed and just pleased to be included, tries to stammer out an excuse. ‘It did feel a little bit like spying, but Ginny made a compelling argument.’
Green eyes flicker toward them from behind broken glasses and, if possible, his shoulders slump even more.
. He always does, doesn’t he? From refusing Draco’s hand of friendship (not that Draco dwelt on that fact or anything), to quidditch, to hippogriff attacks, and secret armies and hidden clubs that no Slytherin had been privileged enough to be included in. Potter has, as far as Draco was aware, been hell bent on proving Draco to be some evil doer of some kind.
Ginny snickers. ‘He is too easy to rile up,’ she turns back to Lavender. ‘You know what, I think I’ll order them for him.’
Ron’s gaze flickers to her, annoyance flashing through his still furious expression. ‘Nothing,’ he snaps, yanking his arm free. ‘I’m going upstairs. I swear to Merlin, if any of you follow me, you’ll regret it.’
He looks up at her, meeting her gaze properly for the first time since they’d run into each other. ‘How do you do it?’
He shoots a quick glance over at Draco. Draco, whose expression is tightly controlled, giving nothing away. Unlike Potter, whose every thought flashes across his face. Theo swallows tightly, glancing across at Granger and Blaise, who have yet to leave the room.
I'd like to thank everyone for the support regarding my health and your patience with my slow updates, I really, really appreciate it. I am still here, and I am still working on this story, albeit much slower than I'd like, but I hope you're enjoying the story enough to stick with me. I'm really enjoying writing it and I love being able to share it with you guys.
She sighs, turning her gaze away from him, staring off across the crowd and cutting him off as effectively as yelling at him.
Harry offers him a tense smile. He frowns, unsure why he’s so uncomfortable, only that he’s suddenly wishing he had asked someone to come with him.
‘You have a usual table?’ Harry asks, glancing up from the books he’s clearly not paying attention to (seeing as he’s somehow drifted into the Herbology section).
Potter blinks at him. ‘There’s not really much I can do about it. Besides, it’s not so bad. Tonks is alright. She’s your cousin.’
‘Finally,’ he says, brushing his fingers through his fringe. ‘There’s the Potter we all know and adore.’
Potter nods. He glances down at the parcel, his frown deepening as he reads the tag that Theo had painstakingly wrote in Brown’s handwriting.
Well, Theo isn’t going to suffer just because Draco can’t work out where the fuck his loyalties lie.
‘Actually, I don’t think he cared. He even asked me what we were talking about. Of course, then Hagrid got all excited and wanted me to ask a bunch of weird questions.’ Harry cracks a smile, a fond expression lighting up his eyes.
He explains how to cast a Patronus charm, the wand movement and of course the importance of thinking of a happy memory. He demonstrates this by casting his own. His father’s animagus form erupts from Harry’s wand, prancing twice around them and then coming to a stop in front of Harry, throwing his head twice, as if in greeting. Harry grins.
Seamus still looks doubtful, and the uncertainty bubbling in Dean’s gut increases with step toward the dorms. He hesitates just outside the door, shuffling his weight from foot to foot.
Harry rolls his eyes right back at Malfoy, sighing, but doesn’t retort. Luna tries not to let her mind get away from her again, alas, she cannot help it.
Harry’s expression softens. The intensity, the reckless anger driving him, is gone and there’s a calmness to his eyes now. He offers Draco a small smile.
Hermione purses her lips. ‘Harry…’ she sighs. ‘What about the Zoo tomorrow? You know that was conditional on you and Malfoy getting along.’
Potter blinks and scratches the back of his neck. ‘I’d never really thought about it before, to be honest.’
Harry brushes the back of his fist across his face and looks up at Weasley, who’s gaping down at him. ‘I…’ says Weasley, his voice high and shocked. ‘Shit, I didn’t…I don’t…’
She pauses, her gaze shifting, growing distant. ‘No,’ she says. ‘I don’t think so. At least not yet.’
She pauses, giving him a significant look, like she can see right through all his denials and protests and read him right down to his soul. He swallows, lowering his gaze.
Malfoy (who has yet to drink his potion) glances up, something like relief in his eyes. ‘Potter,’ he says briskly.
Beside her, Ron shifts his weight from foot to foot, chewing the inside of his mouth, his hands jammed into his pockets. Hermione shoots him a glare that he (of course) doesn’t notice. Then she jams her elbow into his ribs.
‘Draco,’ says Harry, a warning in his voice, and for one sweet moment of relief Colin thinks he won’t have to hand the photos over.
Parvati squeezes Lavender’s hand. ‘Seriously, Lav, I don’t understand why you bother with him? He never pays you any attention.’
‘That wouldn’t be very friendly,’ says Luna. ‘I think you should wait until Christmas time. I always find that people often realise what they really want at Christmas.’
He groans. ‘Stupid saviour,’ he grumbles into Potter’s arm. ‘Stupid Gryffindor’s and their stupid lack of self preservation. Should just let you freeze.’
She yanks open the door she knows he hasn’t realised they’re standing outside of and strides through. Potter follows, though he doesn’t go to his seat like she’d told him to. She sighs, and tries to resist the temptation to rub her temples.
What she does not expect is the heavy sorrowful air to slam straight back into her like a bludger, thicker than it ever had been in the castle. She almost staggers, reaching out a hand to grasp the doorway, and doesn’t notice the other occupant of the room straight away.
Draco, though, is perfectly aware. He stares at the necklace in mute horror, his hand still clutched around Potter’s robes, holding him in place, stopping him from trying to pick it up again.
‘It’s for you,’ he grumbles, throwing an arm over his face. ‘Send him away so I can go back to sleep.’
, Ron? In Diagon Alley? I’ve asked him about it and he can’t even describe where he was. Not to mention that limp—’
‘Nah, it’s totally true. I told you, it was only a matter of time before one of them went crazy. Potter was all—’
She waves her arm in an intricate motion. Light flows out from her wand and she watches various points on his body glow in varying shades of purple. Bruises. There are four yellow spots indicating fractures (all on his ribs), two orange points for breaks (one on his hand, the other further up his arm) and three red indicators for gashes, all small, two on his temple and one on his arm near one of the breaks.
fits him. But sure, once you get passed his ridiculous dressing habits…yes, yes I can see why you like him.’
‘Well,’ he says, and tugs on Harry’s arm. ‘All the more reason for you to get over here. Come on, I’ll help you.’
look more pathetic than usual, and personally I’d rather finish the job myself than risk catching whatever disease Potter is trying to spread around the school.’
His mouth snaps shut and unexpected fury surges through him at the implication. She raises her chin, her expression taut and defiant.
She stares at him, and then out to the Quidditch Pitch in the distance where she can see the tiny figures in the air and all at once she is absolutely certain that it’s Slytherin quidditch team.
From the expression on her face, Severus knows that she thinks she’s won. That he’ll do her bidding and protect Draco not only from his task, but from the Dark Lord’s sights. That he’ll turn Draco over to Dumbledore and the Order. She thinks she’s reminded him of his own past, what with that earlier dig about school crushes. She’d set him up for this, primed him so that, with this last revelation, he would be ready to agree.
‘Congratulations are in order, Mr Longbottom,’ Professor McGonagall says, peering over her glasses at him. ‘You may start your extra work in Greenhouse Four in your free periods and in the evenings, but be sure to be back in Gryffindor tower before curfew and stay on top of your homework and assignments.’
Myrtle is riveted to the spot. She can’t move. If she could blush, her face would be redder than ripened radish. Despite embarrassment, she can’t but imagine it’s
Greg raises his eyebrows. He didn’t think it was possible to embarrass Blaise. As far as Greg has seen, Blaise does not ruffle easily (and not for lack of trying on their housemates part).
‘I was. I mean I did,’ Potter frowns and rubs at his head with a sigh. ‘Everything is…cloudy. My head hurts.’
Draco surges forward and plants a solid kiss on Harry’s lips. He slides a hand into Harry’s hair, holding him there. He flicks his tongue out, asking a question that Harry readily answers.
Draco goes still, his gaze—fixed on Harry’s—is completely unreadable. His breath washes over Harry’s face and Harry’s throat tightens as he realises how close they are. His breath catches and he tries desperately to think of anything except his dreams.
‘No, seriously! I was talking to a second year who was there and they said it looked like someone had died in there.’
To his surprise, Malfoy smiles back. It's small and uncertain and...kind of endearing. His eyes crinkle at the edges, the steel grey softening into something warmer and he's almost attractive, like this.
Ron laughs. ‘You could say that,’ says Ron. ‘Harry started mumbling Malfoy’s name in his sleep about…oh, six months ago? Didn’t take me long to figure out why.’
Hope you enjoyed finally getting an insight into our Slytherin Prince - though, I'm not totally satisfied with the way it came out, hope you guys enjoyed it anyways.
There’s another pause, and Draco has to strain his ears to hear the answer and when he does he’s not quite sure what to do with the it.
Still, Draco isn’t willing to take that chance. Even now, rejected and alone, he’s still protecting Potter. More proof that this
The swish of the cape, the arch of his wand, and suddenly, Harry is back in Diagon Alley. He falters. Looses his grip on his magic. Doesn’t have time to get it back, to make the wand movements and raise a shield.
The bell goes off, and Hannah steps back out of the way as her classmates hurry to gather their things and head out to break. Harry lingers by the model of the park and Malfoy watches him from their desk, packing up his things distractedly as he frowns at the Gryffindor.
So it is late, I am functioning on incredibly minimal sleep (sick kids, yaayy.....), I have not edited this one bit, or even glanced at it since I wrote it but...here you go anyway.
He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, mussing it up into disarray. ‘Why does it have to be so fucking complicated?’
His fists clench and he closes his eyes, trying for the umpteenth time since yesterday afternoon to steady his temper. If he manages to get through the day without blowing something up it’ll be a god damn miracle. And no, he’s not
‘Yes, you did. Anyway, you know how he is. Normally he’d bite back and say something perfectly horrid, but instead he just…ignored us.’
Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair. ‘You want to know why your kid isn’t crying? Because he likes you. You’re a good Dad. He’s
Potter is still watching them, worry etched into his features. Malfoy is pretending to glare at a cupboard, but his gaze keeps flicking toward them.
He runs his towel over his hair, trying to scrub away the thoughts. Apparently Potter has the same idea, because Draco can’t see any other logical reason to explain why the bloody hell he’d bring up the very subject they’d been so successfully ignoring.
She wants to squeal. The realisation is bursting in her chest, aching to get out, and yet she’s acutely aware of the
Still leaning out over the rail, Harry turned his head to see Malfoy walking up the stairs. ‘Enjoying the view, actually. But if you’d like me to move out of your way,’ said Harry, stepping back and gesturing at the rail.
He glances up at Ron and Dean, and Ginny goes quiet, flicking them a quick look before nodding back at Harry. Ron frowns, and heat flushes up his neck.
As usual, all his thoughts scramble in a panic, and when the message does finally get through, his legs jump start ahead of the rest of him. He turns sharply, unprepared for the sudden motion, and walks straight into a table lined with delicate soil testing tubes. He cringes as they go scattering across the table.
) as Harry pulled him forward and pressed their lips together for the first time. For the first of thousands, he hoped.
Silence stretches out for an uncomfortably long moment, sending an itching sensation under Theo’s skin. He chances a look at the other boys and finds Potter frowning back at him. Theo looks away quickly.
‘Shut up, Zabini,’ says Draco, his quiet and cold. ‘Let me make this crystal clear. If anyone, ever, goes through my things again, a broken bed will be the least of your problems. And Nott? You have no fucking idea
Ignoring the raised eyebrows from both the Gryffindors and no doubt his own housemates he slides into the seat opposite Potter with a genial smile.
a clever plan, if that actually was Draco’s intentions—but somehow, Theo doubts it. Draco doesn’t have the patience to pull it off. The only reason he would willingly spend as much time with Potter as he has been, is if he actually
Hagrid watches Malfoy and Luna a moment longer before turning his attention to Harry. Somethings eaten away at him, Hagrid knows.
going to the apothecary, and, in fact, he does. Yet, that doesn’t stop him from seeing the truth. There’s only one reason he wanted Severus to do the task, and that is the fact that he doesn’t trust Slughorn. Not that Severus blames him. He doesn’t trust Slughorn either. After all, if it weren’t for
‘You looked like you could use a cuppa,’ she says by way of explanation, glancing back at him with a soft smile.
She grins again. ‘Yeah, I know,’ she says. ‘Look, You can’t help the way you feel, Harry. And if you like him and he’s not being a total prat than fine. I say go for it.’
me? You can’t just bite me because I’m doing something you don’t like, you know! God, I can’t believe you just—you know what, I can’t. I just…here, back in your tank.’
‘Oh,’ says Longbottom, piping up from two seats down of Blaise, looking at Potter with those earnest, puppy dog eyes. ‘he was looking for you, by the way.’
She looks around. It’s quite a bit bigger than her current tank. The glass walls are thick, and warmth pulses out from them. Delighted, she stretches, rubbing her scales along one wall.
One bump. That’s all it takes. One misstep from one stupid, stumbling student and all of Theo’s carefully laid plans come crashing down around his ears.
‘We should find our rooms and get settled,’ said Hermione, gesturing upwards. Harry sighed and resigned himself to unpacking, looking back longingly at the chairs.
‘Fuck off! She’s mine and you know it! You only want to ask her out because I do. You…you’re trying to steal her from me! You’re just jealous!’
can find someone with more substance to talk to, Potter,’ says Malfoy, turning slightly so he’s in Romilda’s personal spacing—forcing her to take a step backwards.
Zabini’s gaze flicks over to him. He tilts his head just slightly, before fixating back on Malfoy. ‘Draco…you know more about this than you’re saying.’
She blinks, inhaling the high altitude air with relish, taking in her surroundings and unable to help a small smile as she looks up the small open-air staircase in front her to see the domed perch of the Owlery.
Weasley turns like a dragon on a rampage and swings blind, punching Harry straight in the face. Harry staggers back, surprise and pain flashing across his face as he falls. Pansy shrieks, stepping back out of the way. Longbottom darts forward, but stops short of doing anything useful.
‘Harry,’ he takes a deep breath and sighs. ‘Look, even I can see that Malfoy cares about you. When you were stuck in that fire—’
‘You’re a lot prettier than the other Dragon’s I’ve seen,’ he says, still in that low voice. ‘Doesn’t matter that you’re small, you know. I bet that doesn’t give you any trouble does it? Being small never stopped me. Just means you gotta fight a little harder.’
‘What’re we going to talk about now?’ asks Pansy, glancing around at the unconventional group of Slytherins, Gryffindors, and Luna.
Poppy’s jaw clenches. With a sigh sigh, she turns to face Albus, her tone arch as she explains, ‘once the magic has built up, it needs an outlet. Either we control how he releases it,’ she gestures at the wall, ‘or it controls him. Usually resulting in the destruction of school property and the endangerment of himself and others. Currently, this is the safest solution of everyone involved. But by all means, if
‘It was the best,’ says Harry, leaning his head back and blinking up at the ceiling. ‘I stole one of his shirts once, just too—’ he interrupts himself with a yawn. ‘—just so I could feel close to him when I go to sleep. Like he was there with me. Protecting me…’ his voice trails off and after a moment, his eyes drift shut. He takes a deep breath and sighs. ‘I miss him.’
in the day; and no matter how many times I tried to explain that digital Muggle clocks tell the time with numbers, he just couldn’t get it through that thick skull of his because oh, he’s taken a few Muggle Studies classes so now he’s an “expert”. God! He’s such a ridiculous prat!’
‘It’s not something that can be caught,’ says Hermione with a frown. She drops her gaze back down to the book. ‘It’s something that was triggered when he tried to perform magic beyond his ability.’
Brown has the parcel in hand, her bag slung casually over one shoulder, a small smile on her face as she heads toward the door.
McGonagall ignores him. She casts several spells in quick succession. Harry seems to relax, falling quiet as the spells take effect, though his face is still creased with pain. She pulls a quill out from within her robes, casts a long and complicated spell, and then places it on Harry’s chest.
Somehow the boy has managed to scramble into his clothing in the brief moment Draco had the towel over his face, and he stands facing Draco, clutching his clothes to his chest as he stares at Draco with those infuriatingly expressive eyes that are currently stuck somewhere between stubbornness and mortification.
Vince throws his magazine at Blaise. ‘Not that you twat,’ Vince growls. ‘I mean the end idiot. Finishing. She doesn’t like that part.’
He, Harry Potter, Gryffindor extraordinaire, has just laid one on Draco Too-Good-For-Everyone Sodding Malfoy. Which begs the question of
‘Yeah but…’ Ginny drops her gaze to her hands, twisting them together on the tabletop. ‘That’s just a fairy tale…right?’ she looks at her brother. ‘Right, Ron?’
‘You could’ve helped? Really? When, exactly, could you have helped? After all you’ve been far to busy to bother coming down here lately.’
So she had dredged up every bit of medical knowledge she could find on the affliction. What it was. What it did. How to fix it.
She purses her lips, but before she can say anything, the door opens again and Granger and Weasley push into the room, scanning the room anxiously for Potter.
Colin pokes his tongue out at Ginny. ‘Oh leave off. There was grass in the lens, what was I supposed to do?’
Harry squared his shoulders. He dug for that determination and defiance that Malfoy so often made him feel, dug for the indignation and the will to rise to the challenge and, with as much ferocity as he could manage he said, ‘You wish,’ and stepped into the room.
Luna looks up from the page, staring straight into the blue eyes of the white wolf she cannot unsee.
A grunt of pain breaks through the momentary panic, and Harry focus’s just in time to see Malfoy get punched in the face.
She’s right there. Even Greg knows about it. Though, that’s because Blaise left his betting book lying around again and Greg happened to see it when he was tidying up the dorm room (as usual he was the only one who cared about their weekly inspections).
She watches him go. Somewhere in the distance the thunder roils, and Luna decides that if Harry can be off enjoying the rain, then so can she.
More magic than he knows what to do with shoots out of his wand. His inkwell explodes, but this rather seems to encourage the rest of his things to do as they’re told, and aside from his ruined ink everything else stacks itself obediently in his bag.
Oh, sure, Harry has always been a brooder. But this is different. This is deeper. Darker. A despondency that encompasses him and it gnaws at her, filling her with worry each time she sees him. It’s like he’s gone right back to how he was at the start of the year, with his secrets and his hidden pain, and she longs to know what it is that’s changed?
‘When I woke up,’ Malfoy continues. ‘I was confused. For a split second I thought it was real. I thought...I thought you were really dead.’ He shudders. ‘You’ve no idea how…anyway. The point is it won’t be me who wrecks things, Harry.’
Harry whimpers. ‘Ron,’ he says, and burrows further into his bedsheets, squeezing his eyes shut against the offending noise. ‘
‘Well done, Smith,’ Malfoy drawls. ‘You figured it out. Potter has been secretly flirting with me through veiled Muggle means...’ He trails off, his tone making it obvious how ridiculous the whole thing sounds.
Malfoy drops his glare to the floor. Potter clenches his teeth and frowns at the ceiling. Neither one says a word.
Their voices trail away and Tonks waits until the Keeper’s attention is back on his previous snakes, before cancelling her charm and slipping out of the exhibit.
There had been several nights when he had not been able to sleep in the fear that the moment he closed his eyes, someone would barge inside or that someone might knock him unconscious just because they knew that he was a whore and they were his clients.
He hiccupped and wiped his eyes. He did not want to meet them. It was possible that one of them knew and they would take him back. He did not want to go back.
"I'll wait for you to come back. Also, I'll -" He mutters and continues in a low, embarrassed voice, "I'll miss you."
Harry looked into his eyes and it was as if his eyes softened "Yes. We must but Pansy was your friend. She might be- and you do not want to find them."
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, opened his eyes. He thought she had gone mad. Even she, herself thought that she was mad. Of course, he would think so.
Vernon's friends came over on Friday nights and so Petunia had cooked several things and she had entrusted one small task to that boy. He had to make chocolate pudding. But, he couldn't do it and he didn't tell her until much later that he hadn't done it. The five-year-old freak was a waste of space and she had - she had just been so angry that she had lost her calm and commanded him to go and sit inside his cupboard and stay there for the rest of his days and die, if possible. She had been so angry that she had slammed the door shut and then they had ordered the dessert.
It was ridiculous in a way. Who had thought that he would miss Draco so much? Each and every gesture and word haunted Harry. Every time, when Harry had just ignored Draco or his efforts to please Harry haunted him endlessly.
"So you came." He jumped when Harry's small and pained voice reached him. The first emotion that assaulted him was anger which transformed into grief a few seconds later.
"Mom asked me to visit her." He answers before continuing in a soft voice, "Pweeeaaase. I'll eat all the vegetabws and I'll drink milk also. I'll be a good boy."
"I would go mad and probably end up in St. Mungos." Harry replied and Draco kissed his nose, murmuring "Well, then it's good because I am never going to leave you."
A few seconds later, he feels someone's presence on the door and looks up to see a sobbing Hermione in Ron's arms. The boy is looking at them, his eyes pained. They are standing at the entryway. Draco's eyes are closed. Her body is shaking with sobs.
Ten minutes later, Harry found himself sitting cross legged on a couch with Draco's head on his lap. Lucius was sitting with Narcissa across them. Narcissa was lost in her thoughts and Lucius was staring at the fire, pointedly looking away from them. Remus, Severus, Hermione and Ron were also sitting on different couches in the room.
But she is not an object and if she is not enjoying it, then what's the point. He is not Riddle. He is not an animal. He won't use her. He is a better man and he has waited for such a long time. He can wait some more. A involuntary whimper escapes his lips as he forces himself to back off from her warm embrace. He lays down on his back and tries to calm himself down.
She looks at him for good two minutes before answering him, "Yes. It was me. I tricked Riddle into telling the recipe to me but I will get there later on. To answer your first question, I have spent past three years in his presence. I know him inside out."
"Okay." Says Scorpius and stands on the entryway while James tells his mother that they're leaving. Albus keeps on looking into Scorpius's eyes. Scorpius doesn't look away and he doesn't smile. Their relationship was sham although Albus didn't know that Scorpius was never in love with him. He will realize eventually. Not that it would matter. Albus himself was only ever interested in father.
Harry groans in pain when he pulls his hair again and the man starts laughing manically before slapping Harry tightly. Harry stumbles on the floor. Bellatrix joins the man and starts laughing too and they start kicking him. Harry knows that his ribs have broken and his left arm feels numb and his knees are bleeding.
He had just spoken a word when Draco walked over to him, his eyes boring into him and his hands inside his pockets. But Harry could see that he was fidgeting.
Draco cried and cried and he heard Hernione sob too. It had to be difficult for the woman considering that she was a healer and did not even realize that Draco was in trauma.
"What did you think I would do after looking at these photos and reading the letter, Draco? Leave you alone, shout at you or god forbid, perhaps you thought that I would beat you up. What compelled you to commit suicide? You took such a big step. You decided for me as well. There must having been some reason. Tell me." Harry continued, his voice unreadable and Draco spoke in a small voice "I thought that you would despise me."
Something had shaken Draco up and the man was trying to hide it. No matter what Harry said, Draco won't agree. He would just postpone whatever he planned so Harry decided to tread very carefully. Draco wanted him out of the house for whatever he had planned and so Harry nodded "Okay. Perhaps I will do some shopping. Do you want me to bring something from the grocery."
However, Mr. Zabini starts pushing Albus towards the door while muttering, "Ask him then. Don't ask me. I refuse to do this again and I'll have a word with Pansy as well. Don't visit her. She is not as forgiving as I am."
"Malfoy, did you hit your head somewhere?" The man asked, his eyes narrowed and teeth gritted, bringing Draco's attention to him. His tone was just so similar to Harriet Potter's that Draco stared and stared and then turned around to stare at the door. It was closed. Draco wondered how he would return to Hogwarts.
"Hermione Ron. Please bring them to the sitting room." He whispered and his best friends nodded. Hermione looked at him thoughtfully as if asking him to ensure that Draco is ready.
"I don't see any other way out." He says, "Snape will obliviate me and that will be the end of it. I'll be able to move on with Ginny."
He can literally feel the pain that she is feeling. It's written all over her face. It's evident in her trembling fingers. It's evident in the bruises that are still there on her neck. It's obvious from the fact that she doesn't want to eat anything, that she doesn't want to talk to her own mother. The corner of her lip is still scarred and her cheeks have bruises too.
. You want to dig their past, eh? You want to date -" the man chuckles again, "-date Draco as in long term dating, eh? You are welcome to try but I'll have no part in it. I tried my best and I don't have the strength or desire to do this
"Save it, Lupin. I am not interested. It was a school-boy crush." Lucius snapped at him and Severus spoke, "Lucius-"
His eyebrows rose when he saw Harry sitting on his bed, his legs crossed, still in his night clothes, looking at his hand, looking vulnerable and small.
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it. His nostrils flared a little and Albus chuckled, "At least I can finally see for myself how much of a
What if he hit a tree instead. That won't do. Voldemort lay back down on the bed and closed his eyes, willing sleep to take him.
"We have a lot of time. You-" Harry had tried to be brave for Draco but his voice broke in between because he wanted children. Draco spoke softly "I am sorry. I know that you want kids Harry and I am so sorry for not being ready."
"After bathing you, I will return to my lab. They will need some samples to take back so that they can test the potion. I will levitate you to the ground floor and I have got all the rooms cleaned so you can just sleep in one of them if you want." Draco murmured and Harry nodded "Thank you." Before returning to his breakfast.
Lucius stares at Black. They are supposed to be rivals. They are not supposed to have a secret child. They have despised each other for as long as Lucius has known.
Before she can get another word out, Ron starts, "This is one of your worst plans, Harry and Snape won't agree."
Harry pulled back and Draco looked in his eyes, his hands on Harry's shoulders now as Harry looked at him with red rimmed eyes and his hands on Draco's cheeks.
"Should I bring breakfast here?" Draco asked, changing the topic completely and Harry spoke "I have to bathe."
"No. It will a waste of time, life and weapons." She said, "We can't ask our warriors to do what we can't do ourself."
"I had promised that I would take care of you. I failed. I don't deserve you. I failed, Draco. I couldn't take care of you. I made you cry. I increased your depression. I compelled you to leave." Harry spoke, his eyes sad and still fixed on Draco.
He became worried when their was no answer so he shouted  "Draco."  and climbed stairs quickly to check Harry's room. He should not have taken the liberty to enter it without knocking but he did. He shouldn't have just opened the bath but he did.
What he had expected was to see a crying sobbing Draco Malfoy and he was surprised to see Draco glaring at him furiously. Draco's punch on his chest increased his surprise and he glared back at the man attempting to stop the punching hands.
Something burned inside Draco. He didn't understand why she didn't shove him off and leave. The Weasleys had the minister's support and Draco would be kicked out if the Weasleys complained to Shacklebolt which was why Pansy wrapped her fingers firmly around his wrist just as George wrapped his right arm around Potter's waist. His arm curled around her waist and rested on her stomach. Potter pinched her lips and her nostrils flared but she didn't back off, not even when George wrapped his other arm around her front, just above Fred's arms.
After a few minutes, Draco pushes back and looks at Harry with thoughtful eyes and replies, "I trust you. I know that you love me."
"Go and get your ingredients." Draco says and Albus swallows silently before heading towards the closet. All the while he feels Draco eyes burn on his skull.
Around twenty minutes later, Seamus sneaks inside. His eyes widen from horror and his face turns white when their eyes meet.
"I've waited long enough. Either you move on or you reconcile with Harry. He won't stop drinking and I cannot see him dying." She spoke softly and Draco just stared at the nosy woman.
"I -" He started and Lucius blinked before cutting him off, "But that's not the part you should worry about. Your godfather Sirius Black wanted me and I am not aware whether it was love or lust. I did not care to find out. Somehow he knew about our clandestine meetings and blackmailed me. He said that he would expose me if I don't agree to have a relationship with him. I, of course, refused. My housemates knew that I was a bi. I had thought that he would forget about it but I don't think he has. Then I joined the ranks of death eaters and forgot all about it. But, now, now I think that he is somehow connected to Draco's sentence and what happened after that."
He almost jumped in surprise when he noticed that Harry was staring at him with his piercing Green eyes.
Harry restores all the memories back inside his mind before sitting down on the chair. He places his elbows on the table and covers his face with his hands. It's finally happening. He had known that it eventually would and there's no way to stop it now. He curses his past, clumsy self for falling in love with Malfoy and risking everything. He curses Malfoy for being a coward. He was an utter fool for believing that Malfoy would love someone like his past self.
He remembered the day when he had accused Draco of doing nothing except sitting on his ass all day at home. He had been utterly foolish and had not noticed Draco's depression at all.
"I do not know who manipulated me Harry but I want them destroyed. This is the last time I am crying because of those bastards. I am done with brooding Harry. I don't want to die now. When I was in the shower, I realized that I would die and won't be able to live with you and it had been a horrible thought. I want to live with you. I want to live and love and have a beautiful house and a kid who has your eyes and my hair. I- I do not wish to die."
But she is married and it's wrong to think of her like that. He opens his eyes, look around and follows her example by apparating in front of his house. He has some baking to do.
Harry stroked it and Draco said " He wanted to wax my hair and used boiling wax to do it." Harry noticed the way Draco's voice broke off pressed his cheek on the scar.
On this note, Draco pulled Harry in his arms and Harry's breath hitched as he wrapped his hand around Draco's neck and his legs around his hips.
"Mate. what's the matter?" Ron's brown eyes study him silently. It's been a while since they met. Harry takes a minute to think about what he is doing. Ron and Hermione bring memories with them, memories that he would rather not relive.
"Spare me from your clumsiness Potter. I am already late." Draco drawls coldly before turning around and walking away with hurried steps. Only a few moments elapse before Potter shoots up and starts following him.
Harry leant forward and Draco wrapped his hands around Harry's neck. His lips took Draco's inside his and Draco closed his eyes. His head was twisted so that Harry could gain proper access into his mouth and Draco felt all tension leave him. He pressed his groin into Harry's and Harry groaned inside his mouth.
"If today's quota of glaring at us has finished, can we go? I would like to know how, exactly, we have landed in some other dimension. Unlike you, some people actually have work," she drawled. Zabini snorted in response and Malfoy breathed deeply, trying to hide his grin and failed. This was Parkinson's way of telling Harriet that she actually didn't terrify any of them at all.
He bends down and presses another soft kiss on her mouth. She is delicious. He wants her in a way she doesn't understand. She can't understand. Maybe she never will.
"Potter." Draco mutters impatiently but Potter refuses to answer so Draco does as he's told. He starts limping out of the room, feigning a moan as he walks. Potter doesn't care. Draco's annoyed eyes linger on Potter's broad shoulders and strong frame and he huffs petulantly before leaving Potter be. It's not like Potter to not care. Maybe Draco is just imagining all this.
He had realized many things since he had arrived here. Draco had become a successful potions master but Draco had not healed. He also realized that Draco loved Potter unconditionally.
She nods a bit, trying to get her bearings back and he asks her, "Do you want water?" She nods because she is realizing only now that she is thirsty and hungry.
Rose is training under Draco and so is Teddy. There are a couple of others too. Albus is not on talking terms with them though. He spends half of his time staring at Draco anyways. The other half he spends brewing or taking notes from Rose.
"Please, turn it back so that we can bury him properly," he said and Petunia didn't really understand why Vernon was so calm about this when he was obviously horrified and unhappy and pained.
"Father knew." She mumbles so softly that he almost doesn't hear. When her words finally register in his mind, everything starts becoming clear to him.
"Your mother is coming over tomorrow morning." He whispers gently and she doesn't reply. She only goes through the motions and stares at him.
As odd as it seemed, Harriet was starting to believe Luna. What she didn't understand though was that why Hogwarts was angry.
Dad cuts mom off with a coldly murmured, "Is it too much to expect him to stay out of my mind, then?"
Harriet followed Malfoy as Parkinson sat with Hermione and Zabini sat between the twins so the only chair remaining was beside Malfoy. It was satisfying to watch Zabini give the twins the taste of their own medicine. The twins were straight. At least, as far as Harriet knew, they were. Of course, they had very little space for her between them and had left no scope for themselves to shift and make more space. Zabini wrapped both his arms around their waists. It was quite hilarious to watch their red faces.
Every second that elapsed was an hour for him. He knew that Granger would do everything in her power to save Harry.
"Like what?" Draco asked and Harry replied "I wish you would visit your parents and godfather, Sirius and Remus. They took care of you."
Harriet's eyes narrows in rage and she follows quietly, wondering why no one is saying anything. How can they be so heartless. Even Remus is quiet. His eyes are following Harriet as if he knows she is there. Dumbledore is watching the entire scene gravely.
"Harriet, we need to go." Severus mutters sharply as Lucius looks at Narcissa. She gets the hint and bends towards the child who wraps her arms tightly around his legs and shakes her head.
Draco heard the last bit and shook his head "I don't understand why they did so. They barely knew me at all. Why did they lead me there? I was so hungry and tired. No one would give me a job. I would have lived on scraps or perhaps died, which would have been better then what I did. I just want to forget it. Why, oh! Why? I had never hurt them at all. I hate them so very much for-for-"
Ron grimaces and mutters, "Could you please not call her by her first name? To answer your question, no, she is not."
"Have you started donating blood too, Draco? Is that why she is bent as if trying to bite your wrist." He sneered and Draco glared at him angrily "Get out Potter before I make you. I am having a meeting and it's much more important than your useless tantrums."
She doesn't smile. Most of the times, her face is blank. She doesn't speak. Harry doesn't know when was the last time he spoke. She requested him to keep Ron and Hermione away from the house. So he did. Elves stay out of the way. Just three days ago, he had gone to visit Ron and had returned to frantic elves who told him that Draco didn't eat anything. In fact, she didn't get out of the blanket at all. He realized that he is only she wakes up for though it's a surprise because they don't converse at all.
Perhaps it was the faint tremble in Draco's words or perhaps it was just that Something was stopping Harry from leaving Draco alone, that compelled Harry to ask "What time did you say I should be back?"
Harry had sent copy of his order to Draco as well to infuriate the bloody git. Perhaps his anger was the key to bring him back.
He had two options now. Either he could accept Mark's offer and return but that would be a death for him or he could ignore the words and carry on. That would equate death too because Harry would gradually receive the photos and would leave him alone. Harry would break and would never be able to accept him back and Draco couldn't live without Harry. He loved him so much. He couldn't breathe without Harry. He couldn't exist. He couldn't let anyone else touch him except Harry.
She laughed bitterly at his stammered words "We had been stupid enough to acquiesce to your wishes a year back. It won't happen again. Insult us all you want, Harry. I'll be back."
"They just got ready. I just brought them over," Vernon said, finally looking at her. His eyes were bloodshot. She stared speechlessly at him. Vernon did not know how to cook.
Severus has not slept a wink for three days now. Dumbledore had asked him to let her stay with her relatives for three days at least.
Harry's anger gets the best of him and wraps his hand around Draco's wrist before twisting it. He stares, satisfied when Draco bites his lower lip to keep himself from moaning in pain before letting his hand off.
Harry nodded and walked towards Draco's lab blindly. He entered it and the letter and photos were lying on the table. As he went through them, his blood boiled. Draco had been blackmailed. The photos made him want to seek the bastard and kill him in cold blood but Draco needed him right now. There would be time for revenge later on.
Something shifted between Potter and herself yesterday night. Before yesterday she hadn't wanted to tell anything to him. But then - after what he said - the words just tumbled out of her mouth. She would have told everything to him, except she knows that others deserve to know everything too, considering the fact that they are going to have to tolerate her mood swings and irrational rage or extreme sadness for the next few months, until she recovers.
He nodded and Blaise dragged him out of the club and apparated him to his house- empty house with empty rooms but a very nice bar where he could drink to his heart's content.
"It will take you to Godric's hollow, at my parents's place. It has wards and protection charms and Hermione is there with a few elves. Let her heal you. She is a nice person. She will only want to help and she will not insult or mock you." He stops and looks at her. She only stares at him because - because this is exactly like a fairy tale. He has come as a knight in a shining armour and he is giving her a way out and he doesn't stare at her breasts even once.
"What will you do if I do? I will say it a thousand times, not that you care. I have ordered again and I will order as many times I want to." Harry mocked him.
The POP of apparition prevented Harry from saying anything and he nudged Harry so that they could get settled on the couch. Harry sat on the couch and Draco sat down between Harry's legs. Harry stroked his hair and it was utter bliss. This was what he had always wanted, an evening with Harry. The equation was missing someone and he wanted to talk to Harry about that.
If it weren't for Draco, he would be lost in this large castle full of strange faces and unending noise. He doesn't want to stay here. He is staying because he wants to create a world in which Draco is free and Harry can perhaps live happily with the only person he has ever loved.
After silent staring of three minutes, Harry spoke "You are not ready yet. It has been years since we made love Draco."
He was so lost in his thoughts that he did not even notice Lucius walking towards the door with her wife. Only when he reached the door did Harry see him and he whispered, "Do you still love my dad?"
Cool breeze swept in through the gigantic windows and Harriet stirred. She blinked a couple of times before opening her eyes and yawning. It was still dark outside. She still had some time before her classes. She closed her eyes again and turned to the other side.
"What is the point of this question father?" Draco asked and Lucius replied, his body frozen, "Answer me."
In his shock and terror, he completely forgot the letters and photos that lay on his floor and ran out of the room towards his lab. That was a place which won't be intruded by anyone. Once inside, he cast the strongest silencing charm and broke down. He fell on his knees and covered his face.
He would have to try to get Draco to talk about his past. He couldn't let him live with so much pain and torture inside him.
She will never forgive her father for this. She doesn't think that she can get over this. She is not feeling anything, neither sadness, nor anger. She is numb and it just hurts so much.
Harry was shocked and wanted to slam his head into the wall at Ron's stupidity. Draco was another story. He was angry. He was so angry that Harry wondered if his hands were the only things that were stopping Draco at all.
"we love you." His parents spoke together. Draco knew why. Father did not like display of emotions or affection like this. Harry dragged him and Draco went willingly, gobsmacked at the drastic change father had undergone.
Severus leans back against the chair and stares at the ceiling wondering if he has made a very big mistake.
"When did you leave her in his premises?" Somehow Harry manages to ask and Lucius murmurs, "Three hours back."
"Yes sir." The worker answered and he nodded "Tomorrow, we will do the library. It will take longer than today. "
It seemed that Emily had been standing just outside their room because her voice reached them in a heartbeat "Yes, Mr. Malfoy-Potter."
"Yessss." He hissed and Draco's eyes widened with lust "That's what I wanted to see. Now, we will find them and then we will ruin them. Just wait Draco. I will bring them and throw them at your feet." Draco's eyes darkened with desire and his kissed Harry passionately before continuing "Yes. I will call everyone home tomorrow and tell them. It's time they returned to their homeland as well. I have kept them away long enough."
"Do you plan on staring at me all night Potter?" Even his way of speaking has changed over years. He still drawls of course but his voice softer now and devoid of his trademark arrogance.
"I'll not hurt your brat," Voldemort drawled curtly, leaning back and spreading his legs. He was wearing a shirt and trousers today. It was hot. He hadn't wanted to wear robes, seeing that he had gone to kill the kid and it usually didn't require dressing up.
There is a lump in Harry's throat. He can't bear to imagine the vile things that that monster might be doing to Draco. How is Harry supposed to react to this? His heart beats have sped up and his eyes are prickling. How can this man be such a bastard? Harry wants to cry because merlin knows why but he loves Draco Malfoy. She is annoying and she keeps on snapping at him. She is never civil but he loves her.
He mustered all the strength he could to shout "EXPECTO PATRONUM" and the his lion patronus growled at him before running away to intimate Granger about it.
"I have taken your case, Mr. Potter." She said and walked towards him. Her face was very blank and Harry cleared his throat before saying softly, "I'm sorry."
She glared at him for a few moments and walked away without giving another reply to him. He stared at her hips as they swayed. They were round and her legs were long and -
It broke Harry's heart to see Draco crying like this. He knew that Draco abhorred looking vulnerable in front of others so he attempted to hide Draco from everyone's eyes and it worked because Draco did not apparate or run away. He listened to everything his parents said which had been the intention.
Harry's soft eyes pierced into his soul, as if he knew everything, as if he heard all those unspoken words and feelings of his. He averted his eyes from those mesmerising eyes and turned towards the closed door.
But the child simply looks at the man and shakes his head, "Mom told me that she would say something like this. It's okay, uncle Severus. She's hurting."
Different types of sounds that escaped Draco's mouth distracted Harry and he stared at him. Sometimes, he frowned and sometimes he smiled and other times, he burrowed in Harry's stomach. He wondered what Draco was dreaming about.
He had tried to convince him to hire some help to keep his records and maintain the lab but Draco had refused making an excuse of being capable of doing everything alone. The real reason was that Draco did not want any company. He was ashamed of himself. He could not look into anyone's eyes except Harry.
He ignored it and started speaking "Harry. I want to tell you everything. I want to tell you the reason due to which I entered in prostitution at the first place. I am tired of keeping secrets from you Harry."
"I never wanted them to touch me ever. But I sold myself willingly and it is a sin. I can not forgive myself for it. It is all my fault. Had I not been ignorant of the muggle world, I would never have resorted to such measures. I do not even remember their faces clearly. But I remember their words and their hands and their roaming dirty eyes make me feel so dirty. Sometimes I can feel them dropping some money on my chest and my chest burns. It's so degrading." Draco paused for a few seconds and then continued "Sometimes I can not breathe. When I lie down, I can feel them on me and - and in- inside me, pinning m-me-" Draco stopped after this and Harry tried to calm his racing heartbeats.
"You said something else the other day when you came back from the zoo." Sirius murmurs. Harry and Severus had fallen upon Malfoy and his son and Harry taken an instant dislike to the small boy. Again, he hadn't yelled and thrown a fit like a normal child. No. He had only told Sirius that he hated Draco and he would never talk to him again and that he would never be his friend because Draco wouldn't show his broom to him and because Draco made fun of his hair.
She knows that even being the girl-who-vanquished-Voldemort won't help her survive. As they side-along Tracey, Harriet falls on her knees. She is shocked by their sheer hypocrisy. They want their freedom but are not ready to grant others even their basic rights. She breathes hard and closes her eyes. What was the point of the battle if even ten years later, there is a whole race that can't exist. This was exactly what Voldemort wanted - except that he wanted everyone except the purebloods to exist though how he thought that was possible was beyond Harriet.
"Ron. Just leave my premises immediately. I want you out. Leave us alone." Harry almost snarled and Draco sighed, relief coursing throughout his body because this meant that Harry loved Draco the most and that was all he needed. He needed Harry's love like air. He couldn't survive without it. He held Harry desperately, trying to get rid of the images Weasley's arrival always brought. He had tried so hard to stay away from his past.
"Come on, you git. Your father is waiting for us, glaring at ceiling and muttering to himself." Ron smirked and Draco glared at him, "Don't talk like that about my father."
Blood trickled down Harry's hands and gathered around his body. Draco shifted a bit and placed Harry's head on his lap very gently. It was his fault.
"Draco. I had thought that you were healing." He whispered softly. He did not want Draco to be angry or too scared. Draco did not reply. He bowed his head and looked at the floor, his hands crawling to his wrists and Harry cleared his throat before speaking "Please speak to me."
He kneels down and activates the fireplace before tossing in some floo powder. Fire starts burning in the hearth and Harry takes a couple of moments to adjust his eyes.
Hermione hugged Draco lightly and Ron touched his shoulder. The others just nodded at Draco and hugged Harry lightly before leaving. Fred, George and Longbottom murmured "Keep in touch mate" to which he nodded.
After breathing deeply with his head stuck out of the window, Draco turned towards him. Harry had not even realized that his fingers were on his cheek. Draco's eyes widened and he walked towards Harry, his eyes guarded.
Draco stopped and started punching his chest. Harry just stood there silently, his eyes wide in shock. Something was going on, something that he did not know because surely Ron was not one of them, surely Ron could not betray him like this, surely Ron would have told him about Draco's location had he known.
Draco frowned again but nodded and left the office. The last time Draco had seen Potter was after the trials. He had thanked him for speaking for his family in the court and had left the country. Except for the fact that Potter had three kids, one among whom was Albus Potter, Draco knew nothing about Potter. He knew a lot about Albus and James, though and the credit went to his son who had come out to him just a few months ago and had a huge crush on Albus and Teddy who liked Potter's eldest son quite a lot.
"How is she?" He asks as he settles down on the couch. She sits opposite him, her eyes fixed at the fireplace.
Sirius considers denying. Malfoy won't take kindly to the intrusion. But Harry's eyes become really huge and his lower lip trembles and Sirius realizes that he simply can't deny his godson. Severus would glare at him if he were but he isn't because he can't resist giving in to Harry's request.
He stares at her naughty green eyes. They are gleaming with mischief. Bloody hell. She is a perfect mix of Lily and James. His hair are still dripping wet and he glares at her. She stand upright and tries to school her features into innocent and guilty ones.
"No, I'm not hungry," Potter was saying, pushing his hand away, smiling tightly. Her green eyes were blank and dead which was infuriating because Draco wanted to read them like he did when they were studying in the castle.
In the years they had been together, this technique had worked and Harry had always backed off, hurt and furious and Draco expected the same from Harry. What happened was completely unexpected.
He felt fingers on his forearm and warned, "Don't." before shrugging them off because Draco's fingers were creating tingles in his entire body. He wanted to hold those fingers and suck them into his mouth and he wanted those fingers everywhere on his body. His cock twitched again which was a bad thing because he would just have his right hand to satisfy himself for the rest of his life.
"Severus calm down." Black mutters but he ignores her. He glares at Lucius who is just looking shocked. Harriet is in his arms. He looks so strange with a child in his arms. Narcissa is blinking her eyes quite rapidly as if trying to wrap her mind around everything that's happening.
He screams in pain and then something very surprising happens. A car - uncle Vernon's car comes speeding towards him which causes the trio to back off. Harry wonders if Uncle Vernon is just going to do him a favor and kill him off but that doesn't happen.
"I did- I didn't even touch her. I didn't enter her room except to give her food. Take her away from my home. She keeps on wreaking havoc all over. Take the menace away. That's all I want." She whimpers pathetically and Severus storms inside, heading straight towards Harriet's room. He will have to get accustomed to call her by her first name if he must raise her.
Anger spiked in Draco's mind and he tried to control himself from shouting at the stupid redhead. With narrowed eyes, he looked at Weasley and spoke "I am still alive and i can take care of him. I- we do not need any favour from Granger or you. I will stay with him and will conduct my business from our place."
He cursed Granger mentally because Harry was bleeding at an alarming rate and the woman had still not arrived.
Everyone froze and he glared at Granger spitefully "You want to talk to me about Potter. Let us talk in the 'boy who lived to be the bane of my existence's' presence, eh? Perhaps that would force you to stop interfering in my life."
"What is it?" Harry asked and was astonished when she sat down beside Draco and took the burn soothing ointment from his bed side. It was time for applying it and Harry had decided to do it after Lucius and Narcissa would leave. She removed the blanket from Draco's chest and closed her eyes, murmuring "Sweet Merlin, Draco. You must be in so much pain."
"Indeed." Dudley spoke and walked towards the entry way with his daughter beside him. She was beautiful and had wide blue eyes. Her hair was long and curly and she extended her hand towards him solemnly "Hello. Uncle Harry." In spite of being just ten, her eyes looked matured and Harry knelt down in front of her, kissing her left cheek. She was after all his family.
"I don't have any wrong intentions. Will that suffice for now? I will tell you the truth when I think that you will believe me." He continues in a soft voice.
Harry stands quietly and looks at Draco, his arms crossed and his eyes sad. A few minutes later when Draco has finally gotten over the shock, he gets up from the bed too and stands in front of Harry.
Draco might want to bury his anger behind a veil of terror and insecurity but Severus knew. Severus knew that it was just a matter of time. His fury will show itself again.
Harriet stared at the window. This was the old potions classroom in which Snape had taught them. Harriet remembered how she glared at him and he glared right back and how he still helped her. She had not understood that he was not a villain. Ariana was much more perceptive than Harriet was at her age. Harriet did everything to keep the kids at a distance. She didn't know how Ariana was so sure that Harriet loved them.
While he prepared eggs for Harry and himself, he pondered over Harry's aggressive behaviour and wondered why he had never noticed before.
Harry stared at him and when he turned to look at Dudley, he found the man looking somewhere outside the window, tears streaming down his cheeks, his eyes practically burning with shame.
Tessa had hugged both of them in turns and had thanked them, her eyes bright and hopeful for the first time they had met her and Harry had been proud of himself.
Harry places a finger on his lips when Narcissa is about to say something and replies, "Sure. We'll leave after breakfast. There is a very beautiful garden at a bit of distance from here. It has a big pond and ducks and swans. You will love it."
‘Well, we don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea,’ she says evenly. ‘Experimentation is fine, so long as no one’s feelings get hurt. Better not to let anyone think things have gotten too serious.’
Potter leans forward, and they’re almost nose to nose. ‘There’s got to be a way to make this work,’ says Potter, his voice low and imploring. ‘I know I’ve been a git lately but I was just confused. Your letters took me by surprise and I was angry. And then Luna gave me your letter book and…I just…I know you want this.’
Hagrid frowns and scratches at his beard. He follows Malfoy’s gaze, which is still fixated on Potter, and his expression clears.
Harry grins, and leans up to kiss him again. ‘If you’re not careful I’m going to get another concussion.’
There’s a loud clatter, and the entire class shifts it’s attention to the cupboard as smoke and dust billows out of the door, Potter and Draco bursting out in a fit of coughing.
Draco snorts. ‘And why in Merlin’s name would I need you to hex that idiot Hufflepuff? I’m perfectly capable of handling the likes of Zacharias Smith.’
It doesn’t take long. An hour later Draco Malfoy slinks into the office. Though Phineas doubts the boy had a chance to get back to the dorms before receiving the note, he’s back to his pristine and arrogant self. Though Phineas thinks he detects a hint of nervousness.
Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t look surprised. His shoulders sag, and he runs a hand through his hair, shooting Draco a quick look that Myrtle can’t interpret.
‘Oh, fine,’ says Neville, shrugging and unable to look Harry in the face. ‘It’s not the first time I’ve been bitten by a plant.’
She sighs and starts to answer, except Potter begins to stir. She fishes a potion out of her pocket and hands it to Malfoy.
‘No,’ says Harry, his voice muffled by his hands. ‘Not really. I’ve tried a few times but I’ve never…finished.’
She turns her head, but doesn’t look away from the cabinets. ‘Where would you put confidential files?’
Hermione sees it. Before all the mess that comes later, before the fight with Malfoy and the conversation with Ron, and everything that follows. She sees the quiet that settles over him. The distance in his eyes when he speaks to them. The way he loses focus on a conversation to stare off into no-where, lost in whatever dark thought is plaguing him.
In which Draco tries to write a letter but can't quite manage to express himself; and Harry swears. A lot.
Theo can see the irritation surging through him at the accusation. Blaise thinks this is just another one of Draco’s tantrums. Draco glares at him, his focus pin-pointing on the other boy.
‘But they’re here,’ he says, his breath coming quicker. ‘They’re here so they weren’t…they weren’t okay…’
disappearing (Blaise half suspects that Draco only does it to rouse his housemates curiosity), but following the blushing incident the night before, Blaise’s interest is more than roused.
Theo stops, turning to face Blaise fully as he extends his hand, a small smirk twitching into place. Before he can reach out to accept it a voice speaks up from behind them.
‘I…well I didn’t want to. I told you didn’t I? I’ve been telling everyone all week that it isn’t true! But now…’
‘I tried to make them matching,’ says Luna in agreement, ‘after all, you two were getting no where.’
If Ginny was a girl like Lavender Brown she might squeal in delight. Hell, she might anyway, but Hermione is watching with that keen, narrowed gaze, so Ginny schools her expression and nods.
She watches Harry sit hunched over and miserable, not daring to look back at his friend, and wishes that whatever it was he’d done to upset Ron he could’ve just
Molly chuckles. ‘Oh my dear,’ she says, ‘You teenagers are always so dramatic. If there’s anything I’ve learned it’s that love is not so easily ruined.’
Oh Potter had his talents, and the Headmaster certainly put a lot of faith in him, but exceptional? He wasn’t Merlin. He wasn’t even Morgana Le Fay.
Potter shifts. He rearranges the scarf around his neck again, staring at the ends of the knitted fabric.
Poppy purses her lips. She’s about to go in there and berate him about overexerting himself but without waiting for a response he turns and crawls back into his bed.
She smiles at him. ‘Not this house,’ she says. ‘Since you’re almost seventeen now, I thought that you might like to have a place of your own. This is the Ward Key to Black Lane. It’s yours.’
Malfoy, on the other hand, just looks at him, all quiet and calm. He glances at his so called friends, at Ginny, and then at Ron. He sighs and rolls his eyes.
Hagrid laughs a little, but it’s a nervous laugh. Tonks braces herself, ready to intervene if she has to (though, she really doesn’t want to go sending confundus charms at Dragon Keeper’s).
The second is that writing this story from external characters can make it a bit difficult to convey things. For instance, I have to write Harry and Draco's reactions to events without the narrators knowing what they're reacting to, which, of course, can lead to misinterpretations. Thus, Hermione asked Harry if he was acting so strangely because of his meetings with Dumbledore; when in reality the true reason for his embarrassment was working together with Draco post kiss and being unsure of where they stand. Hermione realises that the meetings are not what caused him to be so clumsy, and thus, is frustrated that he's still not being honest with her (like he's not being honest with her about Diagon Alley).
She turns and heads off with new resolve, leaving Harry to wander about the Castle, lost in the glow of the stormy night air.
Potter frowns, staring at the shirt. ‘I didn’t know our uniforms were made of silk. Seems kind of silly, really.’
He pulls ahead of her and Ron takes off after him, his face both pale and expression grim. Well, at least they’ve stopped fighting.
‘Oh alright,’ Potter says sharply, grabbing Weasley’s arm and shooting Malfoy a pointed glare. ‘I think we’re in enough trouble for one day, don’t you?’
He stands up, turning to face Harry, his expression returning to familiar cockiness and self-importance. Ron scowls and wishes his bat boogey hex was as good as Ginny’s.
It curves upwards and out. Straight toward Harry and Malfoy, looping back around in their chase of the Snitch. It’s too close and too far. It’s too close to the boys for any of them to do anything. Too far for Ginny’s shout of warning to make any difference.
Harry shrugged and, feeling awkward, turned away from Malfoy. It was hard to know where they stood, what with the events in the Room of Requirement, and Harry speaking at his trial and all.
‘No idea. Look, all I know is that afterwards, that dorm looked like a pig had been slaughtered there.’
Harry, his timetable in his hand, stepped into the eighth year dorm behind Ron and Hermione, and looked around curiously.
‘Really?’ asked Harry, glancing dubiously up at the head table. ‘You don’t think McGonagall will put me and Malfoy together as some sort of example?’
Lavender raises one eyebrow. ‘Yes, he said that. But that doesn’t mean he can talk to me like that.’
‘You didn’t get back until after curfew?’ Granger asks, her voice sharp but her gaze steady and unblinking.
‘Look, it’s done now, can’t you just leave it? Hermione’s already given me an earful. Who told you anyway?’
‘I should think not,’ says Poppy, unable to help herself from interjecting. ‘Mr Malfoy is right, I don’t think you realise how lucky you are, Potter. That level of magic casting can kill a grown wizard. Let alone a teenager.’
The plot is going to start progressing a little faster from here on out, and it'll be a bit more serious than it has been over the next couple of chapters.
Somewhere outside thunder rumbles and Draco scowls out the next window into the pouring rain. He can just make out the blurry outline of the pitch in the distance and wishes that the rain would let up. At least then he could clear his head with a quick spin.
‘You’d think he’d give up by now, the great git,’ he says, and nudges Harry, not even noticing that he’s barely in control. ‘But you show’d him, eh?’
‘They’re already getting worse,’ Ron mutters, and rubs at a lingering bruise on his arm. ‘So what’re you worried about?’
‘Stop panicking,’ he gasps, squeezing his eyes shut and trying to think of what Draco would say. ‘Just breathe. Just…breathe. You’re in control. You can control this. You can…control…’
Ginny glances at her. ‘Of course,’ she says. ‘Why wouldn’t they love you? You’re amazing. Not that they’re good enough for you. I mean, any idiots who roll around on the floor
The humming breaks off and Draco’s stomach flip flops when the interloper starts muttering to himself and he realises just who it is who has stumbled upon him.
Molly sets aside the base mixture and, heedless of Harry’s usual insecurities, pulls him into a hug—batter fingers and all.
Tonks lets her features melt back into their natural position. One that might make her look more recognisable to Malfoy. He blinks, and cocks his head to one side, his brown eyes widening imperceptibly.
So I kinda dropped off the face of the Earth and I'm sorry. However, I'm happy to say that my health problems have all but resolved themselves. I still need to take things slow for the moment as I'm still catching up on a lot of sleep loss, but things are getting better.
He sighs, his entire frame drooping into the doorframe. He glances up, dragging his gaze from the floor to meet her eyes.
She glances over at the Gryffindor, wondering if she can at least ask him if she’s close, but he and Malfoy are too busy scowling at each other to notice her trying to catch Harry’s attention.
‘Stupid fucking Weasley,’ he mutters, imagining the red headed idiot’s face on the outside of the cauldron he’s working on.
‘You really think…’ he trails off and frowns at his hands, at the faint scars there. ‘You really think Harry would put aside all their differences? All of Malfoy’s flaws? You’ve met him, right? He’s not exactly easy to get along with.’
Already at the end of his patience, he yanks open the door to glare into the face of Narcissa Malfoy.
‘Yeah that’s right, that one,’ Eric says, not seeming to notice the warning in Harry’s voice. ‘She’s a bit weird, hey?’
She frowns, contemplative, as they reach the stables. The horses are already prepared, Thistle having whisked out ahead of them to ensure the two mare’s were properly sadeled and waiting by the time they make their way out.
‘Er, I wouldn’t call her that if I were you,’ says Potter in a stage whisper, leaning over to Malfoy. ‘Apparently calling her by her first name is what lost Mad-Eye his leg.’
Draco’s body flops back onto the bed against his will, the blankets flying out of the way before encasing him again the moment his back hits the mattress, tucking themselves in at the edges so that he feels pinned down. He starts to protest, but Pomfrey points her wand at him, remnants of her anger surging through her gaze.
‘Look out!’ Ginny pulls Romilda back out of the way of the two wrestling boys. ‘Merlin, can’t you two get a grip! You almost hurt Romilda! What the hell is wrong with you? And you claim to love her?’
‘Fuck Theo,’ Draco shakes his head. ‘Did you ever think that maybe I was waiting for the right moment? This isn’t a fucking game! This is serious. It has real consequences.’
Surprise lifts his head from its drooped position, and he nods. ‘Uh, sure,’ he says and pushes himself out of his chair.
Ginny is ready to argue with him, to demand what exactly happened, when he casts her a sideways look and adds, ‘I expect you’ll be wanting to get back to Dean?’
Harry rolls his eyes and shakes his head. He mutters something under his breath and reaches for the coffee. Colin tilts his head. Harry’s been drinking Coffee a lot lately. In fact, he’s been doing a lot of things differently lately.
She crosses her arms, shrugging defensively. ‘Not talking seems to be a thing with you boys,’ says Lavender.
Phineas raises an eyebrow. He’s wondering if he’s going to have to spell it out for the man, when he summons an owl and sends it off with a brief note.
'Wasn’t much of an altercation,’ says Harry as some of the ire returns to his expression. ‘More like a murder attempt.’
He shakes Potter’s hand exuberantly, and Potter laughs awkwardly, obviously embarrassed about the attention.
She contemplates explaining. Telling him how the fire had seemed strange and alive and almost ominous, but she stops herself, feeling silly.
Blaise smirks. ‘Well you never know, there could be something going on. You know, that we don’t know about.’
The common room is full of the usual end-of-the-week noise and bustle. There are loud games of gobstones and exploding snap, various groups of conversationalists, and, of course, the usual Dean and Seamus’ group of gamblers plotting over in the corner.
He’s completely disheveled. His shirt is loose, the top two buttons torn away, and a smear of blood on the collar above his askew tie; which is nothing to the fresh black eye and swelling bruise on his jaw.
in her year has been affected by the feud between the two rivals. However, she certainly didn’t expect them to cause her any problems in
Poppy sighs. She runs her fingers through the ends of her hair, winding the long strands around and around itself. Her fingers work out of habit, and a moment later her hair has been swept back up into a bun. Albiet a messier bun than usual.
to his mission in Severus’ presence has made it extremely difficult to gather any intel on what the boy is planning.
‘Gosh, he must be desperate,’ says Tonks. ‘If he’s knocking on the doors of sixteen-year-old school boys to ask for support.’
Tonks finds herself silently thanking her mother for driving her out of the house. She slows her steps, no longer eager to get inside out of the snow—hoping instead to prolong their conversation.
‘Not,’ he says. ‘You know at least four different people I’ve never met before have come spoken to me tonight?’
Ginny looks like she wants to say something, but her eyes flicker over to Katie and she chews on her lip. Katie realises that they think she doesn’t know what they’re talking about. She was still walking over to them when Harry mentioned being rejected. They don’t realise she heard the conversation.
Lavender purses her lips. Almost instinctively her eyes are drawn to the banners and posters and streamers that she and Parvati have been working on for days. Valentines Day was three days away, and oh, Lavender had such plans. It was the first time she’d have someone to celebrate the day with, and—though Lavender knows that perfection is seldom achieved—she wants the day to be special.
Harry runs a hand through his hair and sighs, long and low, as if he’s trying to keep himself calm. ‘No. He didn’t do anything. He was perfect.’
’I’m uh, just waiting for Ginny,’ she says, though he hasn’t asked. ‘We’re going to get in some practice. Since I haven’t been able to attend a lot this week.’
As she suspects, she finds him in the Owlery, leaning out the window with a decidedly pathetic expression clouding those aristocratic features.
Goyle and Zabini stagger out of the room, coughing and spluttering, covered from head to toe in soot and ash.
Silence fills the hall. Ginny glowers at Ron, her face going back to that furious red, her brown eyes narrowed and glaring.
Malfoy’s voice joins in, and then Zabini. There’s a nearby crack and something large and heavy topples from one of the piles. Ginny jumps to the side as sparks and embers burst out of the burnt out carcass of an expandable trunk—the lid burned away, and the cavernous depths within billowing with smoke.
Bella stands back and rolls her eyes, shaking her head at Narcissa’s determination to leave no surface undecorated.
A shiver of something unpleasant trickles down Ginny’s spine at the thought of her first year at Hogwarts. She squashes it though. Reminds herself of why she was invited to this stupid club in the first place. She was strong. She had a near-perfect Bat-Bogey hex. She could cast a Patronus. She would never let anyone fool her the way Tom Riddle had.
Somehow, Hermione resists the urge to groan. She gives Harry an exasperated look, hoping he realises that Ron is just being...well,
‘Isn’t being a spy a good thing?’ he asks. ‘I mean, Malfoy’s a git, sure, but it could be good, you know? Having someone like him on our side.’
Theo steps up next to Blaise, watching Draco go. ‘You’re right,’ he says. ‘This is starting to get unhealthy.’
Draco clenches his jaw and thinks of his mission. He thinks of Theo and what almost happened with the necklace. ‘Hogwarts isn’t always as safe as you think it is.’
‘Because,’ says Draco, grabbing the front of Harry’s robes and pulling him closer. ‘I want to kiss you, but I don’t really fancy being bitten. At least not by her.’
‘Just more about Tom’s past. About his parents. His mother kept his father under a love potion,’ he says.
‘And yet here we are,’ says Harry, and does a little jig on the spot. ‘Alright, let’s go do whatever it is that couldn’t wait until a reasonable hour of the morning.’
‘Not really,’ says Harry. ‘Actually, Hagrid’s class was pretty good. I think Malfoy was actually interested for once. Not that he’d admit it, the git.’
Phineas raises his eyebrows. While he is aware of the seating arrangement rigged between the boys, he was under the impression that they hated each other. Malfoy’s words, on the other hand…
Malfoy’s posse all look nervous. Zabini is looking sideways at Malfoy, while Goyle fidgets with his robes, shuffling his weight from foot to foot.
‘It’s fucking freezing out here, Potter, and you’re quibbling with me over the time. Just get out here already. Honestly.’
He drops his hand, grey eyes flicking back up to Harry’s face. He’s close again, closer than Harry had been before, and Harry has to concentrate on breathing.
Zabini sputters beneath her, and she shoots him a tired grin, offering him a hand as he brushes water out of his face.
Hermione finds herself blushing again. Her gaze strays over to Ron, still snuggled into his pillow, and warmth floods through her. ‘Do you,’ she hesitates, glancing over at Madam Pomfrey. ‘Do you mind if I sit with them for a while?’
The afternoon sun filters through the trees, warming Draco’s skin. Harry continues to play with Draco’s hair and Draco all but purrs, enjoying the attention. He takes the hand that isn’t preoccupied with his hair and examines it. He frowns.
’S’alright,’ says Hagrid, following diligently behind the two boys. ‘This ‘ere is Pod, he’s harmless. Jus’ a wee baby Antipodean Opaleye. They’re from New Zealand. Not very big fer a dragon, and fairly mild tempered, they are. Pod’s a good boy. Keeper might even let you pat ‘im if you ask.’
Harry frowns at the floor and shrugs half heartedly. ‘A mistake?’ he offers. ‘I dunno. I dunno what to say. I’m just…things are…different.’
Maybe he is. Yet, Blaise suspects that Draco’s continued odd behaviour is going to be in his favour this time.
Air buffeted past them, the screams of riders already distant as the cart sped away, spinning through the loop-de-loop, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
The spell hits Albus’ shield with enough force to crack it. Mr Nott takes a startled step backwards and what little blood remaining in his face drains away.
He doesn’t open his eyes, and Harry doesn’t stop even as Draco’s breath catches and his climax hits, surging through him in bursts, more intense than any sex dream, than any wank he’s ever had. The tension flees his body, and finally Draco opens his eyes, panting somewhat as he stares up at the sky.
‘He doesn’t understand how I can just let go of all that,’ says Harry. ‘Kinda like how you don’t understand why I won’t fight back. He’s going to come round…eventually.’
Further up the table, Colin can see Ron and Hermione watching them. Ron’s face is mottled red in fury. Colin imagines photographing him, asking him to yell. It’d make a very dramatic piece.
Poppy sighs. ‘For now I just need information. I need to know exactly what it is we’re dealing with. Then I can figure out a way to stop it.’
There are a few more curious looks from around the room, but Minerva ignores them in favour of staring hard at Albus. She’s watching his face, waiting to catch the slightest move in his expression.
Still, he had developed the photo. He couldn’t resist. It wasn’t just a good photo, it was a great photo. The minute Colin had seen it, he’d known that.
A spasm runs through Draco’s wand hand, releasing the pressure from his palm for a moment as he contemplates reaching for his wand.
Tonks doesn’t hear him, but Remus’ superior wolf hearing does, and he suspects, by the way Kingsley’s gaze flicks over to him, that Kingsley knows this.
‘Yep, sure,’ says Ron, and rolls over, waving a hand in the air as if he can’t be bothered to deal with Harry’s denials. ‘Just be sure to land on your feet. A broken leg is a lot easier to heal than a broken neck.’
A heavy sigh sounds behind him, and Harry glances back to see Ron flop onto his back. ‘Merlin, would you two shut up? Some of us want to sleep you know.’
Malfoy, on the other hand, ignores Ron and Hermione completely. He walks around the other side of the bed and looks down at Harry, eyebrows arched in an expression of dry disapproval that Hermione can now see is a mask for his worry.
‘Besides,’ says Malfoy. ‘You’re the one going on about having a “proper” zoo experience. So obviously getting ice-cream is on the list.’
‘Actually, that was the first book on potions I ever read,’ says Malfoy. ‘Granted I was eight, but then, we can’t all be gifted. I suppose even the “chosen one” isn’t perfect.’
‘Well I wasn’t,’ Draco snaps. ‘In fact, I was having a rather good dream, which you so rudely interrupted.’
my classroom ended up in the state it was in, then you will both serve detention every night for the next month repairing every single damaged item until it is
for fucks sake, and he doesn’t hide from idiot Gryffindor’s (who should know better than to go skulking around the castle in the middle of the damn night) Draco pokes his head out of the shower to see that, yes, it
A small smirk lifts Malfoy’s lips. Harry’s expecting some half-smart retort about how Malfoy makes everyone better…but it doesn’t come. Instead, his eyes drop to Harry’s jaw and he frowns.
‘Why didn’t you tell me about any of this?’ asks Remus, a little hurt that she hadn’t confided in him.
I got a little excited about this chapter, and seeing as I made you wait so long for the last one I thought I’d post it early.
If he was anymore startled, Draco would have fallen from his horse. As it is, he turns sharply, gaping at her in embarrassed surprise.
‘Alright Miss Weasley,’ says Madam Pomfrey stalking back out from her offices, ‘into your own bed now.’
Ron, ahead of her, leans around the corner of one row of cabinets and pulls open a draw. The grating sound of metal dragging against metal screeches against Luna’s ears. She winces, and sticks one finger in her ear.
‘I thought you approved of my plan?’ Minerva counters, heading over toward the fireplace to avoid the awful combination of scents coming from the cauldron.
Except it’s not enough. Draco knows it’s not. He knows that Potter wants more than this. Has been quietly hoping for days, weeks even, that Draco will change his mind. That he’ll give in to these secret little moments and agree to “take a chance.”
Malfoy sighs heavily. ‘Yeah, yeah. I know. I’m being as nice as I can be under the circumstances. It’s not easy, you know.’
Horror flashes across Draco’s face as his gaze snaps to his son and Harry, unable to help himself, bursts out laughing.
I want to thank everyone for being so patient with me and for checking in on me. I appreciate it so much.
‘I know,’ he says, and shrugs, ducking his head. ‘But you’re right. I have to go back. At least for Ron’s birthday. I’d be a pretty shit friend to miss that. Especially after, after every thing he’s done for me.’
All of them except Draco, who is sitting on the end of his bed staring blankly at his closed trunk. He looks up when Theo enters.
‘I um, I went down to the pitch most afternoons,’ he says, needing to explain before Malfoy sees, before Malfoy thinks that Colin is up to something. ‘Just to look at angles and lighting. The teams all practice at different times of day so…so I was there, preparing and—’
told you it’s not up to me,’ she sighs, now fully exasperated with his refusal to give up the point.
Harry laughed, excitement and terror coursing through him, making his blood rush and his ears ring with the thrill of what awaited him.
He sounds so bitter, so confused and upset that Ginny just wants to hug him, but she knows he’d just pull away if she tried and she doesn’t want to upset him any further.
This year is no different. In fact, this year Narcissa has taken extra pains to ensure that everything is perfect, due to the fact—no,
Harry laughs and some of the tension lifts away from his shoulders. ‘That’s pretty much his whole thing, isn’t it?’ he says, grinning down at his sandwich as he peels away the crusts. ‘He likes to pretend that he’s…mean, I guess? But underneath…’ he flushes and glances up at her. ‘This is a bit weird.’
As part of the clean up efforts after the war, the Eighth years had been tasked with helping rebuild sections of the castle as part of their practical spellwork. This was a task of great privilege; a way of saying “we are trusting you with this responsibility” instead of making them do homework.
‘Yeah. Word is that he was pretty messed up. I heard there was this big fight but I mean, have you seen all the accidental magic he’s been pulling lately? I half wonder if he didn’t do it to himself.’
He scowls, some of that familiar ire returning to his features. He drops his gaze, his fists clenching over the hem of his long sleeves.
Narcissa raises an eyebrow at him, feigning surprise. ‘I wasn’t aware his dating life was something he discussed with you.’
He’s not sure who he’s trying to comfort more, Harry or himself. All he knows is that he has to believe that there’s a way out of this. He has to believe that there’s a way for Harry to get better. Because the alternative…the alternative is…
Harry drops his gaze and kicks at the floor with the toe of his shoe. ‘I have feelings for him,’ he mumbles in a soft voice.
Hermione raises her eyebrows. ‘You can’t just get “let off”, Ron. Harry’s in detention for a reason.’
The problem begins, as it most usually does, with Just Harry. Luna detects a hint of Wrackspurts lurking around him at the start of the year. However, by the third week, that hint has become a full blown infestation.
against his chest, quickens. He inhales slowly through his nose, trying to ease the feelings he’s just described from rising in himself. Unable to quite keep to himself, he moves his hand, just slightly, stretching out his pinky finger until it brushes against Harry’s hand.
‘Nothing,’ says Zabini, an infuriating smirk working onto his face. ‘But that’s exactly the point. There’s been nothing. After everything that happened last year…nothing. I mean, Draco’s just as obsessed as he’s ever been-ow.’
Ginny’s adrenaline spikes up another notch as she watches Harry sink into the water. Without thinking, she slips sideways off her broom.
They befall Ron Weasley—who starts a relationship with Lavender Brown though anyone with any sense can see that partnership is doomed for failure.
He creeps through the various frames hanging along Hogwarts’ walls, bored out of his mind as he follows the boy. Until the boy is yanked from the corridor and into a room by the scruff of his collar. Phineas scowls. He shifts out of his current frame, falling into the black void between paintings, and searches for one in the direction of the classroom Potter has disappeared into.
Potter blinks. ‘Transforming what?’ he stares at her, frowning, no doubt trying to recall the incident that put him in the Hospital. ‘Oh. Oh…well…I guess that explains why I feel like I just got run over by a train.’
Malfoy scoffs. ‘Right. And he almost killed himself in the process. There were a thousand other things he could’ve done, that anyone could’ve done, without that ridiculous power display.’
Red swarms up Potter’s neck, flooding his face to the tips of his ears. ‘Erm,’ he says, and swallows. ‘So…so does that…’
At first, Greg is distracted by the question. But then he spies the small book she slips from her pocket to hand to Blaise.
‘What happened to him?’ Draco asks again, more forcefully, his fists clenching at his sides. ‘He didn’t get hit. He can’t have got hit. Besides that wouldn’t have…he wouldn’t be…How…?’
Mr Malfoy, too, looks desperate to have Harry nearer and Albus rather thinks it's a miracle that their relationship is not less secret than it currently is. He withholds a sigh of fond exasperation at the intense loves of teenagers and decides that some help may be needed in keeping the current situation underwraps. In particular, if Mr Malfoy is to succeed at his proposed task at protecting Harry, some experienced coaching will be required to help him.
‘Just how Newt woulda wanted it,’ says Hagrid, smiling over at Pod with an appreciative gleam in his eye.
Harry snorts again. ‘Yeah, I bet,’ he says, his brows furrowing, and he sighs heavily. ‘Count yourself lucky. Talking with him is pretty much the same as fighting with him. Even when he’s complimenting you he has to make it sound like an insult. He’s just so…ugh,
‘So,’ says Draco, his tone shifting toward condescending. ‘This sort of thing probably makes them feel dirty. Like they’re doing something they shouldn’t be doing.’
Harry completely dissolves into laughter. He drops his head onto the table, burying his face in the crook of his arm in an attempt to muffle the almost hysterical giggles. Next to him, Malfoy mutters something no one else can hear, and Harry shakes his head, still laughing.
,’ says Ron, casting Hermione a desperate look for help. ‘I just...I’m not going to beat you up like a muggle or anything, okay? I mean, it’s not an issue, right? Shit, I’m not doing this right. Look, can’t I just say I’m sorry and we forget the whole thing?’
Malfoy snorts, and shakes his head. ‘Hopeless,’ he says, then he flicks his gaze appeasingly over Harry’s clothes. ‘Nice shirt, by the way. Very…Slytherin.’
Mr Zabini, relatively quiet until now, snorts in derision. Severus’ gaze snaps instantly to him and the boy flushes and glances sideways at his friend. Mr Goyle does not, however, meet his gaze and only stares in dumbfounded shock at the ground, his eyes far away and his mind, no doubt, fixed on the very subject they were now discussing.
He sighs and runs a hand over his face. Before either of them can become splattered in whatever half brewed potion Draco has been working on, Severus vanishes the contents.
Confusion and—yes, there it is, curiosity. Draco has never been very good at not knowing things. ’Movie?’ he asks. ‘What the hell is a movie?’
The cart pulled away. Unable to stay still, Harry leaned forward and tracked the ride with his eyes.
Irritation swarms up Lavender’s spine. She glances back over her shoulder, preparing herself to tell Harry to bugger off. That is, until she sees the look of complete and utter panic on his face.
‘It is indeed,’ he says, then, deciding that it can’t hurt to ask, he says, ‘But why in particular?’
Blaise, however, rather enjoyed a good bet. Besides, a quick glance at Potter and Draco has him sure that he isn’t going to end up out of pocket for Draco’s mistake after all.
‘Fantastic or not,’ says Malfoy, his tone light. ‘Potter requires a…delicate hand. It’s taken me weeks to get him to a satisfactory standard and I don’t want him learning any bad habits.’
Not only has he failed in his task, but he’ll now have to spend the entire week with his father. No buffer, no friends, no escape. He swallows hard, his mouth going completely dry. The relief he had felt earlier—the certainty that he could keep this under control—is a distant memory.
‘What on Earth would I have to be worried about, Potter? I hope you’re not implying that I actually care about what happens to you?’
The Pale Boy scoffs, looking away and staring at the ground as if there is Prey there that he would like to Hunt.
She smiles indulgently and squeezes his shoulders once more. ‘I think he knows,’ she says. ‘And I think, if he knows anything at all, that he will be just fine waiting to hear you say it.’
Ron’s footsteps falter. ‘You’re not serious?’ he says and shudders. ‘What does that even mean? No, you know what, I don’t want to know.’
to be angry with whoever I choose to be angry about it, and if I choose to forgive Malfoy for whatever part he played—’
‘Hm. Maybe,’ says Ron, though doesn’t sound at all interested. ‘Harry and I usually check out Honeydukes though...’
‘Potter!’ Poppy’s voice cracks like a whip, striking through the tension in the room with enough force to make most of the occupants (excepting Albus) flinch.
He feels the bulk from the stack of photos he’s already developed. A week’s worth of sitting out in the cool afternoon breeze, trying to time his photos just so—to capture the action of the various quidditch players as they dart through the air.
Kingsley smiles. ‘Of course,’ he stands up, nodding to Tonks and then Remus before disappearing into the crowd after Mad-Eye.
He nods and heads out in front of her, bypassing the potions pooling on the ground. At the door to the room she hesitates.
Harry frowns. He swallows and shuffles his weight from foot to foot. ‘But I…I didn’t say it back. He said…he said…’
Harry shrugs. He glances over at Ron, his eyes bright and watery. He still looks too pale. Too tired. Like all the strength has just been sapped out of him.
Malfoy raises his eyes to the ceiling and mutters something under his breath. Next to him, Zabini sniggers.
‘Because you know why he’s doing this,’ says Blaise, and Theo narrows his gaze. ‘You understand what’s going on.’
‘Like, the way you fly,’ Draco explains. ‘Or duel. Or the way you looked just now, all sprawled out on the floor and fit looking.
Minerva purses her lips. ‘Yes, I can,’ she says, and shakes her head. ‘I know he cares about the boy but sometimes I wonder if he really sees him.’ She straightens and gives herself a cat like shake. ‘Alright, I’ll see what I can dig up.’
He groans, rolling his head this way and that, no doubt stretching the discomfort out of his neck after sleeping hunched over all night.
Harry sits inside next to Neville and across from Luna. There are shadows under his eyes, like there have been the last two weeks, and Hermione wonders just how much sleep he’s getting between the nightmares that aren’t as secret as he and Ron think they are.
Harry laughs. It’s an abrupt laugh. Dry and humourless, and—Hermione’s chest tightens—full of bitterness.
She raises an eyebrow. Across from Potter, Malfoy stops grumbling. His eyes fix on Poppy and she has the unsettling feeling that he knows
They break apart, and Harry is momentarily stunned by his own actions. He stares at Draco with big eyes, his mouth parted, his breathing slightly ragged.
Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts. Puzzling over the conundrum that is Draco Malfoy has never gotten Harry anywhere (except maybe flustered and wishing to be alone).
Lavender, annoyed that this argument is ruining her chances at a wonderful Valentines, drums her fingers across her table and watches them.
he shakes his head, spattering water everywhere, and leans back against the cool stone wall. ‘There has to be a logical reason, right? I mean, I don’t just go around kissing random blokes, so maybe it was a hex or something. Or…or…’
Lisa could understand, to a point, why the Muggle enthusiast had been so pleased at the prospect of enlightening a Slytherin to the prejudices and misconceptions regarding Muggles, but she—like the rest of their class—had sensed that Malfoy was not going to be the shinning pillar of change that the Professor thought he would be; and with every lesson that he sat at his designated seat next to Potter, scowl firmly in place as he focused his attention on anything
Blaise grins, sticks his elbow on the table and rests his chin in his palm. ‘The potion or this obsession with Potter?’
‘It was odd,’ says Hermione, and pretends not to notice the intensity in Harry’s gaze as it snaps back to her.
‘Er, yes,’ says Blaise. ‘In fact, I’d actaully though you’d already gotten back. Didn’t detention finish over an hour ago?’
He grits his teeth. ‘I could just take it,’ he says, but his words don’t have the sting that they used to and he realises, he really doesn’t want to fight.
‘Shit, sorry Lavender,’ says Potter, turning at last to see what’s happened and Theo wants to scream at him to watch where he’s going—to
Draco raises one eyebrow in perfected scepticism. He leans forward and presses the back of his hand to Harry’s forehead. He scowls.
‘But,’ she says, ‘I’ve also noticed that he listens to you. When he’s being…how did you put? Obnoxious and self-important and superior?’
Archie frowns and looks Potter and Malfoy up and down. ‘All the Weasley’s are in that red house aren’t they? The one with the lion.’
A messy scrawl stretches across the page, filling it’s length with copious notes. A dark, bold underline catches her attention, and Luna zeroes in on it, trying to bring her mind back into focus.
To Blaise’s surprise, though, it’s Potter who pushes through. He breaks away from his friends and trudges through the door to the classroom. He glances sideways at Draco, who’s leaning on the wall next to the door, and lifts a shoulder in a half-hearted shrug.
His eyes go wide, and guilt washes over him. ‘I…shit I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to—God, look at me, prattling on about broken clocks. Malfoy’s right, I
Minerva smirks. ‘Never underestimate a teenager’s ability to believe that the adults around them are too busy to notice what’s going on.’
She smiles, and reaching out a hand to grasp the smooth stone rail, she steps lightly up the stairs.
‘That was my favourite book as a kid,’ he says. ‘If I had to pick one, I’d put my money on that being the one by the wizard.’
Draco sighs heavily. ‘Copies of all the teachers notes and files, all the students work, is kept in a protected room on the third floor.’
Before Malfoy can retort, he turns to Neville and offers him a small smile. ‘Sorry again, about all this,’ he says, gesturing vaguely around. ‘We’ll let you look around. Congrats, by the way. On the greenhouse. You must be really proud.’
‘Mmm, two glasses? Maybe three?’ Harry tilts his head to look up at the boy, but doesn’t stop leaning on him.
Malfoy looks away, grimacing. ‘Sorry,’ he says, tossing Harry his shirt. ‘Did you end up talking to Pomfrey?’
much Weasley—the fucking prig), to the resulting detention when Draco enacted his revenge, to yet another arduous lecture from McGonagall about “getting along”, to housemates that won’t fuck off and mind their own business, Draco feels like he’s on the wrong end of a blast-ended skrewart that is about to explode.
‘I don’t believe it,’ says Blaise, denial plastered all over his face even as he stares down at the photographic evidence.
Draco swallows against the sudden lump in his throat, trying to shake off the unsettled feeling that’s crept over him. ‘Who bloody knows,’ he mutters and tries to resist the urge to stuff his hands under his armpits. ‘Are we having practice or not?’
—sighs and rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder. ‘Stay a bit longer,’ he murmurs, and kisses Draco’s neck. ‘Please.’
Blue is distracted by the vibrant red of her hair, and so doesn’t see Him at first. Then the girl shifts, glancing over her shoulder at Him, and Blue raises her head, alert.
‘Indeed,’ says Albus, developing a far off look. ‘I don’t blame him. It must be a difficult place to be in.’
Minerva sighs. ‘Yes, I know. I’ve spoken to Albus but he seems to think there’s nothing else that can be done.’
Right. That does it. Molly spells her knives and spices down to the bench and sets the stew pot to a simmer. She brushes her hands off against her apron and fetches two mugs from the cupboard. Almost without thinking, she flicks her wand toward the small jar of coffee beans she’s kept on hand ever since she discovered Harry’s preference for the drink.
Red stains Harry’s ears and he all but buries himself in his hands. ‘God I can’t believe we’re talking about this.’
The fourth boy grabs him from behind, pinning his arms, and the lead boy is back on his feet and hits Malfoy hard in the gut, but before he can take a second swing Harry is there, catching his arm and twisting it back.
Short of apparating, the only other options are Floo or portkey. Seeing that Severus has the portkey that brought them here (and the fact that Draco didn’t come to find him immediately) Severus can only assume that Draco was caught in the crowd and has decided on the former option.
He props his broom against the inside of the door, stuffs his numb fingers into the shallow pockets of his quidditch trousers and goes in search of the idiotic Gryffindor.
Draco pouts at her but relents. ‘Oh alright,’ he says with a roll of his eyes. ‘Honestly Weasley, Potter wouldn’t even snog in front of another person, let alone do anything remotely risque. Don’t you know him at all?’
The shock of power cracks against the stone with concussive force, somehow being absorbed into the wall with a ripple, as if Harry has hit water instead of solid stone. Harry hits the wall again. And again. Each time the force of magic released lessens, the noise and the resulting ripple diminishing as the blows begin to ease.
Potter himself is tense as a wire, and yet more than a little flustered. An interesting red tinge creeps up his neck. For someone so often in the limelight, Potter isn’t exactly comfortable under scrutiny.
Poppy sighs again. ‘I suppose we don’t have a choice. Who knows, perhaps Miss Granger and her cohort will find something we’ve missed?’
She takes her time, wandering along the corridors with nothing but the clack of her polished heels on the marble to keep her company. Her dawdling will give Draco some time to cool off. He may have been gone an hour, but if Pansy knows Draco—and she
Muggle Studies was compulsory for all returning Eighth years. Forty students crammed into a classroom built for less than half that number, and it didn’t take long for things to get out of hand.
‘I think,’ she says, choosing her words carefully. ’That no one is inherently good or bad. Some people just make worse choices than others. Well, except old Snake-Face. He’s as evil as they come.’
would be there) at her feet, and spots Draco’s present sitting to one side. It’s a large, rectangular box, and she picks it up, casting him a curious look.
‘Can I ask you a question,’ Draco asks, winding his fingers through Harry’s. ‘Without you getting angry?’
Unlike Pansy, Daphne and Theo follow Blaise up from the table. Greg and Vince are too wrapped up in their breakfasts to have even noticed what’s going on, and Blaise feels a twang of sympathy for them.
the same, but there’s something else. Something about him that keeps drawing Harry’s eye back to him over and over despite the veil of awkward tension that has hung between them since Draco’s trial.
Before Harry’s brain can catch up to what’s happening, Draco shrugs out of his thick woollen coat, sweeps it around, and places it over Harry’s rapidly cooling arms. He has to step close, bringing with him the scent of cinnamon and eggnog, and (as the coat settles around him like a warm hug) Harry is left feeling squishy and lightheaded.
Potter—who had been gazing up into Pod’s opal eyed gaze—leans around Malfoy to look between Hagrid and the Keeper. ‘Do you two know each other?’ he asks.
Harry shrugs. ‘I like the rain. There’s something kind of amazing about storms. Besides, I wanted to check on Blue.’
He clenches his jaw, irritated at himself almost as soon as the words are out. Still, Potter’s face barely twitches at his tone and Draco can’t stop the unbidden memory of him laying in the Hospital bed from flashing across his mind. He clenches his fist, seized by the sudden desire to grab Potter by the shoulders and shake him.
Dean sighs and slouches back in his chair. Laughter from across the room catches his attention. Lavender is all but sitting in Ron’s lap. They were snogging a few moments ago, but they seem to have taken a momentary break for air. Lavender is laughing at something Ron has said. Across from them, Hermione looks on in disgust.
She pushes down the emptying corridor, blinking away dark memories and trying to the think of things that made her laugh—like Fred and George had taught her to do. At least the lunch rush is over, making it easier to manoeuvre the corridor outside.
‘You asked to see me,’ Malfoy says after a few moments of standing awkwardly by the door. ‘Sir,’ he adds belatedly.
Draco rolls his eyes. ‘Why not? Look, you’re so easy to rile up it almost isn’t any fun. But that’s all it was, okay? And if it wasn’t all it was, what exactly do you expect to happen? We fool around and maybe we have some fun, sure, but what happens when things have to end? What then? Then I get crucified and you go back to hating my guts. Thanks, but I think I’ll pass.’
‘I couldn’t care less what Potter and Malfoy have done now, frankly I’m more concerned about my Defence assignment. Snape assigned us
‘Oh sure,’ says Draco, irritation making his voice harsher than he intended. ‘And tell me, what was your grand plan in
She tucks the book away into her bag, giving it a soft tap after she’s closed the flap. She takes a deep breathe, and the citrus smell vanishes to be replaced with the soft, musky smell of cold air and feathers and seeds. All at once she wants nothing more to be up somewhere high, to feel the cool air kissing her nose and to stare out at the pale blue sky from a cosy hideaway.
Victory lights Blaise’s face, and he reaches over to tug playfully at the braid in Ginny’s hair. ‘Somehow, that does not surprise me,’ he says.
Ginny yanks open the door, glances about the corridor beyond and spies a nearby cupboard. She drags Harry over, shoves him through, and slams it shut behind her—locking it for good measure.
Poppy shakes her head, uncrossing her arms to wave distractedly in the air. ‘Not that,’ she says dismissively. ‘Having him restart class work.’
She turns back to look at him. He’s still dressed the same, fastidiously neat. His hair, no longer slicked back, falls just short of his chin, perfectly cut and straight. His expression is still cool and superior, comanding the respect of his family and position.
‘One o’ the best Keeper’s around,’ says Hagrid, turning to look seriously at Potter and Malfoy. ‘Good head on ‘im. Good Voice. You should pay attention to Keeper’s like ‘im. Lot you could learn.’
A knock at the door startles her, and she turns, eyes wide having almost forgotten that there were others coming.
‘As well as silence,’ she barks at them, glowering. ‘As such you’ll be practicing the wandless versions of spells you learnt last year. I believe you’ve already started this in some of your other classes.’
All traces of sleep vanish from Draco’s expression in an instant, his gaze narrowing into pinpoint distrust as he glares at Theo.
He looks back down at the gift, holding it between both hands as if it might break if he moves. He licks his lips. ‘Uh, yeah,’ he says.
‘The snitch had gotten loose, and you were both chasing after it,’ says Colin, and offers Harry a small smile. ‘You were both laughing and…’
Draco stares back up at him, unable to see his face but imagining the expression there. The tight expression of anger and frustration fuelling Potter’s mad-dash across the sky. It’s the only explanation for the complete lack of regard to his own safety.
The door slams open and Draco stomps in with his usual scowl, looking a bit less pristine than usual. In fact, he looks exhausted, and Blaise wonders how much sleep he’s been getting. He’s been late into the dorm every night since they got back from Christmas break, and according to Greg he’s gone in the morning before six.
He stares at her, as if he is still the wolf and she is the moon, glowing down on him with all the answers. Her chest feels tight and she takes a deep breath, trying to think of words of comfort, anything that might soothe the pain striking at his heart.
The smell of cleaning solution is sharp and pungent, an almost perfect representation of the shit-heap of a day Draco has had thus far.
‘Well I can’t just…you’re not…they can’t…ugh!’ Malfoy scrubs a hand over his face. ‘Why is it when I’m with you I become a complete blithering idiot. Is incoherency contagious or something?’
‘You know,’ Blaise calls. ‘Greg’s got a point. And if Draco doesn’t have friends how come he’s been so friendly with Potter lately?’
Harry scrubs his hands over his face, pushing his glasses up onto the top of his head. ‘I hate potions.’
He looks up, his expression far away. ‘Hm? Oh,’ he pauses a moment, eyes flickering back out to the window with weary trepidation. ‘Do you...I know we always go after lunch but, do you think we could maybe go later?’
A hand encircles his arm, giving him a slight squeeze. ‘Don’t,’ says Blaise in a voice only for Draco. ‘You’ll just make it worse.’
Before Neville can even think to speak up, Harry pulls Malfoy close and presses their lips together. The force of the tug surprises Malfoy, and his foot catches on a stray tree root, sending Malfoy staggering into Harry. They’re thrown off balance and the two of them go crashing into the ground.
Ron tries not to wince. Almost as soon as the words are out of his mouth he regrets them, but it’s too late to take them back.
God. Ron is just so...Hermione shakes her head. Tears smart her eyes, which only adds to the anger in her belly. Why was she
Draco’s expression morphs into sudden realisation, his grey eyes widening as he stares down at the-Boy-Who-Is-Not-Draco’s-Boyfriend.
‘Yes, because that’s what truce means,’ drawls Malfoy, rolling his eyes. ‘No idiot. Frankly I’d be surprised if we managed to hold a civil conversation. All I want is a ceasefire on the fighting.’
Malfoy looks at him like Harry’s lost his marbles, and Harry thinks he rather might have. He doesn’t feel like himself. In fact, he feels a bit like he’s dreaming, and that at any moment he’s going to wake up, sweaty and breathless, as he has most nights since the summer. It doesn’t help that Malfoy’s been a see saw of contradictory actions ever since that day in Diagon Alley.
Molly chuckles. ‘Love often is,’ she says, offering him a conspiratorial smile. ‘That’s how you know it’s worth it.’
She sighs. ‘Honestly?’ she says. ‘I’m not sure. There’s not really time to talk to him tonight, and tomorrow you’re going to the Zoo.’
The frown doesn’t budge. ‘I don’t want to go back yet,’ he whispers. ‘I’m not ready. I can’t…I can’t face them.’
His voice is thick and hurt and it hits Ron like a physical blow. Harder than when Harry brushes passed him, pushing out of the room.
Surprise flashes across his face and he laughs. ‘Well, uh, I guess I better make sure I save you some cake then.’
readable face. Draco, likewise, looks baffled. That is, if one knows what to look for. There’s the way his scowl doesn’t quite measure up to par, and the slight tilt to his head as he blinks away dust and scattered ingredients to frown at Potter.
The doors burst open as she’s halfway through a restorative spell on the floors. She half turns, glancing back, only to turn fully when she sees not a first year but none other than Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy—both sporting bloody faces and a multitude of bruises—being ushered into the room by a scowling Severus Snape.
For now, though, the long awaited Zoo trip! Or, at least half of it (It ended up being way bigger than I'd planned, and this section alone is almost 5,000 words with at least another couple thousand to come in part two).
Then she frowns, and waves her hands in Narcissa’s direction. ‘Sit, sit, I’s get the presents ready.’
Brown looks down at the crumpled paper that Draco has shoved back into her hands, confusion lining her face. ‘Um…I didn’t…did class finish?’
‘Yes, I imagine it does,’ she says, and gently presses onto his shoulder in a motion designed to make him roll onto his back.
The girl gives him a look that Blue doesn’t understand—human expressions are harder than human words—and the Pale Boy crosses his arms.
His vision swims. The hallway feels narrower than usual, and he swallows against the sudden feeling of claustrophobia. He shakes his head. He’s
Greg raises an eyebrow and Blaise waves him off. Keeping track of Draco’s BFF’s has never been high on Blaise’s to do list.
He looks so utterly miserable that a little of the anger bleeds out of Lavenders muscles. ‘Don’t worry about it,’ she says softly, taking pity on him. ‘I’m not going to let some stupid boy ruin my day. No offence,’ she adds, glancing at Ginny.
‘What were you thinking?’ he asks again, his tone far more tired than he intended it to sound. ‘Do you realise the situation you’ve put yourself in? How dangerous it is? Playing both sides is no easy feat, Draco.’
, Pomfrey’s already given me her approval. I’ll have an extra potion in the morning and I’ll be right for the day. It’s all sorted.’
Harry sighs and fidgets with his shirt for the thousandth time. It’s a nice shirt, green like his eyes. Ginny remembers her mother making him try it, and a slew of others, on when he finally outgrew his second hand clothes from his cousin.
Mad-Eye shakes his head. ‘Albus won’t say,’ he says with a scowl. ‘Apparently our mission is less important than the identity of this would be traitor—’
Ginny and the Beaters are still too far away. Harry is pelting toward the ground, pushing his firebolt as fast as it will go, but it’s not fast enough. Flailing through the air trying to catch his broom had slowed his fall. Unlike Malfoy. Malfoy, who was just dead weight in the air.
‘Potter,’ she snaps, turning to face him in a swift movement. ‘The headmaster has already given you his answer. As have I.’
