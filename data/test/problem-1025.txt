Harry rarely visited the city, but when he did it always struck him like a dash of cold water in the face. London was different to Potting Point. Very different. It moved at about double the pace and people were
that. He didn't want just that. He didn't want Harry to simply give himself to him because he asked, just as he didn't want to take what Ipetsky had stolen before him. What potentially more had stolen, too.
– passed briefly through his mind, but he shoved it aside. If anyone had a problem with it, they could get fucked. Besides, he had a magical boyfriend. What could anyone possibly even do?
he couldn't justify; he'd simply wanted to get out. To abandon the necessity for ducking under cover. To deny that he had to avoid and evade the sea of adoring fans who bathed in the latest news of Harry Potter as though he was a real hero and had saved the day only just yesterday.
Harry spared it a glance. It was a picture of himself, a strange one that looked almost cast in black and white, and clearly from the first photoshoot he'd had with Draco. He recognised the outfit. There wasn't anything particularly remarkable about it in Harry's opinion, good or bad, but then again, he worked on the opposite side of the camera lens. He supposed Draco had a keener eye for that kind of thing.
"And miss a trip to London?" Jackie had flung herself into the passenger seat with an enthusiasm that bellied her complaints. "I said the
People seemed to know. They seemed to sense the outcasts, even without being the ones to initially ostracise them. Harry was used to being a last resort. But Abel…
is going to show he can change and at least pretend to be a better person, then I think I can be good enough to accept his attempts."
Nonetheless, that slightly stunned realisation didn't dampen Draco's instinctive urge to compare himself to those with magic behind their lenses more fervently than others. Draco knew the name and face of every witch and wizard photographer of note in London.
Draco's groan as he came rivalled Harry's own. Arms shaking as they propped him up from Draco's chest, Harry blinked through his dazedness, through the disconcerting feeling of Draco's release within him. His thighs trembled too, holding himself steady just enough for Draco to ride out the waves of his pleasure with spasming jerks. Only when Draco's hips stilled did Harry all but collapse back onto his haunches, dizzy and slightly disoriented yet filled with an airy detachedness and disbelief that he'd never felt before.
Harry nodded. He had. Several times in fact, because it still seemed so alien to him that Draco's world, his Wizarding world of magic and wonder, would be accepting of people like himself. That they would deem him no different from anyone else simply because he fancied boys rather than girls. Despite the terror of hippogriffs and a Wizarding War that Draco had mentioned had apparently eased into nothingness not even two decades before, Harry couldn't suppress the growing upwelling of longing. It was almost like that world was made for him.
Except that the ex-Hufflepuffs apparently considered any passer-by victim to be abducted into their midst.
"I think a classic would suggest it's been around for at least a couple of years," Jill called from the back seat.
It was a little sad, when Harry thought about it. Draco was changing, and Blaise was changing. Everyone in the rest of their year group was growing and climbing the impossible mountain towards some thin promise of recovery. Even Harry, though he wasn't quite sure what 'recovery' looked like. He didn't think he needed to know, or at least not yet; he could dawdle, and in dawdling he could revel in sharing Draco's company and absorbing the comfort of that company that had grown to mean so much to him in the past year.
At Harry's arrival, Draco didn't look up from his notes. He didn't openly acknowledge Harry at all but to sit back a little in his seat, quill lowering, and focusing solely upon his textbook rather than notations. Harry dropped his bag onto the table, rifling within for a moment to extract his own textbooks that instantly resumed their usual weight when relieved of the confines of his bag and its Lightening Charm. He stacked them on the table, pulled out a handful of parchment pages, a quill and inkwell, and a paper bag.
In short order, Harry found himself in one of the two seats across from Dot's desk, Draco at his side and sitting as casually yet notably attentive as only he could quite pull off, and outlining his intentions. Dot listened with close-lipped consideration, nodding slightly at times, frowning at others, but otherwise holding her tongue until he finished his explanation.
"He's a git," Ron said, overriding her. He turned around firmly in his seat, elbows dropping onto the table with a heavy thud. "He always will be."
Draco cursed the bustling, but only in his mind. He'd taught himself better than to utter his disgruntlement aloud. Not only did Muggles show little respect for wizards – if they knew of them at all – but even residents of the Wizarding world would have gone so far as to deliberately shoulder into him should they pass one another on the street. Especially them, even. Draco knew. He'd experienced just such brief confrontations more often than he could recall.
Like a wind-up toy, Draco's switch flipped. He all but flung himself back in his seat, his quill flung from his grasp as his hands rose to his face. He scrubbed at his eyes, rubbed his cheeks, and exhaled harshly through his fingers. The motion was so abrupt, so contrasting to seconds before, that Harry was momentarily thrown. It wasn't a reassuring gesture, and definitely not when coupled with the sharpness of his words, but at least it was more than what he'd given Harry before. Blessedly more.
"Do you keep in touch with Penelope Clearwater?" Harry interrupted, swallowing his smile. "I wasn't sure if you would, seeing as how she and Percy ended it, but given your work…"

It was dark, yet contrastingly bright with its coloured lights. The bar was illuminated with a pair of tenders darting back and forth, bottles pouring and hands palming drinks off to waiting clients. It was cluttered with bodies, and though not as many as would inhabit on a weekend, it was enough for Draco. Too much.
Harry couldn't look at him anymore. Not at his face that didn't sneer at him like it used to. Not at the faint twitch of his eyebrow that could have risen, his lips quirking into a smirk of judgement and condescension just as he'd always worn but didn't. For whatever reason, whichever one had changed him, Malfoy didn't quite do that anymore. Not really.
What Harry couldn't stand, however, was having some nameless boarding school snobs regarding Jackie like she was shit on the bottom of their shoes. That, he wouldn't stand for. He was at her side in an instant as the girl replied.
"Since my house-arrest, you mean?" Harry asked blankly, dropping his magazine onto his chest once more.
Glancing down at himself, at their proximity that remained despite Pansy's intrusion, Harry felt the sudden urge to get away from it. If there was something wrong, something about what Pansy said that involved him, then they should talk about it. Not, however, in the blissful comfort that Harry always sought. It wasn't even there anymore – not at that moment.
"You were meant to be," Draco murmured, face fallen once more into blankness. Funnily enough, Harry thought that such blankness might actually be Draco at his most expressive.
While Draco eyed him warily, Dimitri spared him a considering glance. His gaze gave Draco a calculating sweep before he met his eyes stare for stare. There was judgment there, but nothing derisive. "You're Draco Malfoy, I take it?" He extended a hand. "Dimitri Nilsson."
"I do so hope that he's not so rude to all of your clients," Pansy said with a sidelong glance towards Dimitri. "He must be dwindling your business significantly."
"For shame. For utter shame, that you'd be such a discriminative asshole when two of your best friends are girls and or gay."
Harry shrugged. Draco wasn't wrong in his assessment of Harry's intentions. After all, Harry might want to live for himself a little more, a fact that the joys of travel had certainly nourished within him, but he couldn't change who he was. Not really. He would just do it his own way this time, how and where he wanted.
Harry drew his eyes skyward. He hadn't even started mucking around with magic tricks again yet and it was already causing him problems. "Engrossing as it always is to talk to you, Draco, I've got better things to do than reveal to you how I do magic tricks. Especially to someone who's so prejudiced against it." Starting around Draco, he shot him a sidelong glance. "So, if you don't mind –"
Her slap caught him across his face in a fierce blow. It was strong, her arm so strong, that even seated Harry was thrown to the floor at his side. Bellatrix shrieked her frustration, feet stomping, and Harry could only scramble to sit up once more, to press himself into his corner and make himself as small as he could.
Only to pause with his hand on the doorknob, the other clenching his phone in a death grip. He stared at the door, lowered his gaze to his phone, and couldn't help himself.
Harry closed his eyes, pressing his leg a little more firmly against Draco's. They'd discussed it before – Harry's magic, his reluctance, and that it mirrored but wasn't identical to Draco's own feelings on the matter. They weren't the same, not quite, because for all that Draco might commiserate with the feelings casting a spell could incite, he wouldn't stop using magic. Not even a little. It was and always had been a part of his life so completely that to stop would be akin to starving himself of water. Impossible, and inevitably fatal.
The man regarded him. He didn't move. His cowled head was cocked, as though contemplating the fragility of the child before him. And then his hand twitched and the wand rose just a little higher.
"Maybe you should start at the beginning," the tall woman said, nodding the rest of them on either side of her did. "How about that, hon?"
"We've got to head into hair and makeup, if that's okay," he said, deliberately diverting the conversation. "It'll only take about an hour, and Von will likely already have your outfits ready, so…"
"Yes, and I thank every day that I have you to be that one." Turning towards Harry and entirely ignoring where James had descended into a tussle with Sirius reminiscent of the schoolboys that Harry had never been, Lily slipped back into solemnity. "It's not so much your schooling that concerns me, Harry. I have faith that you'll keep up to speed."
He'd smiled. Just slightly, barely perceptibly, but it was the most natural smile Draco had seen from him. Ever. A little quiet, a little sad, maybe a little thankful, and utterly real. Draco had never wanted to capture a moment with his camera more than then.
Harry had been right when he'd spoken days before: appreciation for superficial beauty was all well and good, but it certainly wasn't all there was to it.
"You don't need to explain, Harry," Jill murmured into his back. "Despite what Jackie says, she doesn't need another explanation either."
"Regardless," he said, setting the thought aside for later consideration and infuriation. "Even outside of that, you've changed. It's… unexpected, to say the least." Which is was. What had happened to the glaring they'd shared that had been all but a competition? What of the scathing verbal strikes, the physical blows, the challenges to duels? And beyond that, even; Harry had been a spitting ball of agitated anger for most of the latter years of their acquaintance, and Draco didn't think it was only because they'd been rivals. The Dark Lord had surely had a hand in it, but for whatever reason, he was loud, he was obnoxious, and he was a violation of every kind of upstanding protocol that Draco had always lived by.
Through the darkness, he could only barely make out Draco's features. The pale oval of his face, the equally pale shade of his hair, his dark clothes that seemed to blur into the surroundings. And yet, even with his near invisibility, Harry could feel the heat of his anger. He'd seen it just briefly, too. After his intrusion, after the blank shock that he'd seen on Draco's face when he'd first glanced towards him – after all of that, Draco had been furious.
Not a single spot remained, and some places even held two people. Hermione was practically on Ron's lap, Lavender entirely on Parvati's, and Seamus wasn't in a seat at all but instead had slung himself over Dean's back to both chat to him and lean over his shoulder to pick at a bowl of grapes. The small cluster of ex-Slytherins were a little more spaced out, the flinch response that entailed not even the consciously aware students could help giving them minute extra distance, but it wasn't much.
It wasn't even that, when they were alone together, Harry always sat in Draco's lap. Not that the questions he asked to himself more than Draco were always answered. Not that, when frustration brewed, when his headache became too much, or when the begging internal whimpers for a break became too much to ignore, he could turn to Draco for a kiss, or a touch, or to simply lean against him and soak up the warmth of his closeness. That closeness had taken on a new meaning since Christmas, an extra layer, but it didn't detract from the benefits it had once provided. Quite the opposite, rather.
"Um…" Harry paused, his hand on the doorknob, and glanced over his shoulder. He found four pairs of eyes – five including PJ's – turned towards him and just as many smiles. Surely they couldn't have guessed that he was meeting someone. Surely. "Yes? I think so? I guess it depends on how distracted I get."
"Quiet, nerd," Jackie back shot at him. "Sixth form is as much about celebrating our youth as it is studying."
Harry didn't linger to watch Jackie turn slowly towards Pansy, though he knew she did. He didn't wait to see her lower her book, though she likely did as well, nor strike up a conversation with her which was as likely to be as riddled with exchanged insults as facts. Passing Draco, he started instead towards where Mrs. Joyce stood surrounded by a drabble of his classmates waiting to submit their choices.
Slowing in step, Draco cast a glance towards the last of the departing group ahead of them. He met the eyes of one as they tossed him a moment of their attention over their shoulder, but only nodded in reply to the unspoken question before disregarding them and watching them disregard him in turn. Instead, Draco turned towards Harry and properly paused in step.
The clicked, beeping with a dial tone as she dropped the line. Lowering it from his ear, Harry eyed the green-washed screen as he gnawed his lip. She'd asked countless times in the past week and would likely continue to, and Harry… It wasn't so much that he wanted to keep his relationship with Draco a secret, and definitely not from them, but…
Hermione's smiled warmly. Why such a statement seemed to satisfy her so much, Harry didn't know, except that it came from Ron and she seemed to be nothing short of smitten whenever he demonstrated any glimpse of his own commitment to schooling. Ron, Harry thought, had realised as well; he was certainly dropping such comments more frequently of late.
"Both of you, mouthy cameraman and Pretty Face, can leave the room if you would be quiet," Pansy said pleasantly. She smiled at Harry. "What do you think?"
Adopting his own degree of casualness, Harry mirrored her crossed legs. "You've done your research, then?"
Silence met his words once more. Jackie still clutched his wrist. Jill still stared. The orb of light pulsed gently above Harry's hand. Then, finally, Jackie released him, her hands falling into her lap with a soft flop.
She stalked into the room in a sweep of ragged skirts. Harry shrunk away from her, but it wasn't like he could go far. There was nowhere to retreat to. Terror like a wave crashed over him.
For a moment, Harry simply sat. He was tired; that much Von had correctly assumed. He felt deflated after the previous night, and not only because of Sammy's company and subsequent sudden disappearance. Staying at Draco's had been… strange. And strangely tiring in itself, despite that Harry had slept for nearly a whole six hours.
wasn't the rowdiest of places Harry had found himself. If anything, though the bar was packed and the dancefloor just as much, it was almost tame in comparison to those Harry had been in before. They had a very firm No Drugs policy which was part of the reason it frequented as Harry's primary suggestion. There was likely still a hand or two that slipped under a table or over a drink without notice, but Harry personally hadn't had any bad experiences, and that was enough for him.
"Imagine what the Wizarding world would think of their Saviour if they knew." Harry snorted, but it didn't come out quite right. He plucked at a loose thread in the denim of his jeans, tugging it free. Von would hate him for doing so, he noted detachedly, but he couldn't bring himself to care. "It doesn't exactly fit with the image that I'm supposed to have. Though I suspect people have speculated. Really, how could you not? And Sammy's pictures, the ones he'd taken of me – they don't leave much to the imagination, you know? I'm surprised there hasn't been a story about it already –"
This time, Draco seemed to be shaken back from his reminiscing. When Harry lifted his gaze again, the glassiness had retreated from his eyes to he replaced by the smallest of frowns that didn't even touch his eyebrows. "You're not?"
Remus hung his head. James shared a glance with Lily and Sirius took a step towards the side of Remus' chair, lowering himself onto the arm.
They dove into the jokeshop, and Harry was assaulted in the best possible way by flying gadgets, bright packages, and confusing apparatus that popped and whirred, spinning and spluttering with surprises. A cluster of cackling children demonstrated the remarkable effects of costuming that magically fit the face so that an eight-year-old sported a full beard and moustache and a girl a little older a hooked nose sprouting long whiskers. Crawling, animated spiders that looked more realistic than the real thing, trick boxes, elaborate board games, and bundles of sweets cast in neon packaging. It was so crammed within that Harry felt a little like a sardine in a can, but it was worth it. Worth it for just a glimpse.
Draco offered Harry a glance of his own over his shoulder, raising an eyebrow. Harry only shrugged. He was smiling, though, and that smile was comfortable, and easy, and so different to those he wore before the camera that Draco couldn't help by respond in kind.
Unwrapping his arms from Jackie and unfastening Jill's from his waist, Harry pushed himself upright. Scooting down the bed slightly, he folded his legs and turned towards them. Jill propped herself up on her elbows, but Jackie only stole his pillow and glared at him, huddling against the headboard.
It didn't take long. The Hogwarts students arrived with the promptness that Draco had told Harry was characteristic of their deputy headmistress. Still, as the minutes ticked towards the hour, the cold setting in and Harry's legs swinging in irrepressible energy, he found himself cursing that Professor McGonagall wasn't just a little more prompt in her earliness.
The thought that the Scottish Highlands, that Hogwarts itself, could be considered exotic was a little horrifying to Draco. He grappled with the thought, with his contrasting disbelief and pity of
Draco leant back into him, pressing a kiss upon his forehead as he did so. Harry didn't think he would ever grow used to such touches; his skin seemed to tingle with delight at the brush of Draco's lips.
Draco realised, rather abruptly, that he hated the interviews. Even with only the first published in
"You don't have to explain your," Gertrude said. She straightened, lowering her own hands to her lap, but only leant forwards in her seat rather than sinking further away. "I can see it. Would it surprise you to know that I was once lost and drifting myself? It's probably of a different lost, as every instance is, but I like to think it's a little the same."
"He always Apparates away in the middle of it when this happens. Sad to say it's not the first time we've been walked in on."
dating Draco, and spending every other afternoon with him when Draco Apparated to Potting Point, or practicing magic with him because with each new charm, each spell and each explanation of something Harry knew shouldn't be possible but experienced nonetheless, it became that much harder to turn back. That much harder to think of any other possible reality.
"So?" Jackie asked. "Weren't you two the ones who said we should poke around a bit and try and get a feel for the place or whatever? For the project and shit?"
Harry shifted slightly again, brushing against Malfoy once more and just as resolutely ignoring the little flicker of warmth that settled in his belly this time. "You're actually asking me that?"
When Harry lowered the camera, he met Draco's watchful gaze. The expression he wore, so calmly content, so quietly happy, wasn't that of the Harry Draco had known from in childhood. He wasn't even the Harry who'd fought in the war, or the worn, world-wearing Harry he'd encountered years later in the glamourous throes of a modelling career.
"With the –" Harry tripped over his words and, grumbling under his breath. He raised a hand to sweep through his hair, scuffing the back of his head. "How I, you know. Sat with you."
"Call it incentive," James called after him as Harry ducked into the hallway. "See you later, Bambi. Call if you end up missing the bus."
Maybe it was boarding school mindset. Or maybe it had something to do with the isolation of that boarding school and what Hermione had indicated - that it was apparently the first time they'd done anything like this. Did the kids at their school really not get out that much?
Startling, Draco swung his gaze towards Harry. Harry, who was smiling brightly in clear welcome and crossing the room towards Ipetsky in long strides. Ipetsky's smile widened into a grin, and he had no hesitation in looping an arm around Harry's neck as soon as he was within reach. He even went so far as to plant a quick kiss – a casual greeting if nothing more – upon his cheek.
"… could – could really go for 'nother drink," the man said, words slurring and grin widening. He had a gap in the middle of his front teeth that made him seem remarkably young. "Whadaya reckon?"
The change from barely minutes before was drastic, but Harry understood. He understood it almost too well, and not because Draco mimicked other potential suitors who were more dazed by the Hero Aura than anything that was particularly innate to Harry himself. He understood it because much of the time, when a situation was turned on its head and he found himself out of sorts, it was so much simpler, so much more comfortable, to let things resort to casual conversation, easy banter, and what could only be termed deliberate derision for any awkwardness or discomfort he might feel. It helped to clamber through it and stagger out the other side.
It was strange, in a way, to see him without the familiar film of loathing. It had been a long time since he'd hated him, Harry knew, but the first time he'd properly looked. Malfoy sat with back straight and his head slightly bowed, utterly focused. Faint spots of pink were the only colour in his cheeks, and Harry could make out the edge of a frown tugging his eyebrows downward, his lips along with them, though he didn't seem angry. Not even annoyed. Rather, even as Harry watched, he drew away from the microscope with a soft harrumph Harry wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been standing an arm's length away.
Harry's lip stung as he sunk his teeth into it once more. Draco really did know something. Something big, and something that would – could – explain things. "What do you know about my family, Draco?"
Eyes closing, Harry sunk against Draco, opening his mouth to his warm kisses. His hand settled more firmly on Draco's shoulder, his other curling around Draco's neck, and with less hesitancy, Draco returned the touches.
Harry barely considered Draco as he made his way through the food he'd brought him. The slight movement of his chest against Harry's shoulder, the incremental adjustments of his arms as he in turn adjusted the sandwich, the sound of him chewing that was so quiet and almost dainty that Harry hadn't actually realised for a time that he was properly eating – it had all become familiar in such a short time. Familiar, and…
It was truly foolish, but he took another round of the club, peering through the staggering midst of dancers and drinkers and drinking dancers.
Ginny stared for a beat before bursting into laughter. "Yeah. Deal." Shaking her head, she made a snatching reach for Harry's hand and he found himself being tugged from the dressing room. "Come on then, troupe. I'm starving."
Gertrude laughed, a low, musical sound that seemed about as sincere yet masterfully concealed as her eyebrows. Skirting Harry's chair, she paused at his side and spared a glance to the frenzy raging throughout the better half of the room. "It's always a bit of a production, isn't it?" she said conversationally.
Like how many of the witch hunts hadn't been of real witches, and that those who had been involved saw it as a special brand of entertainment and daring to tempt fate and avoid the flame or the noose. Or how the controversy over Jasper Maskelyne's contribution to World War Two had more to do with the Wizarding world's struggle to cover up his unlawful meddling than any issue of truth.
Ron stared at Harry blankly. It could have been a trick of the fluorescence, but Harry thought he looked a little uneasy as he shifted slightly between his feet. Hermione, on the other hand, nodding eagerly.
"My bike is only parked around the corner," Harry had assured her without any real hope of convincing.
Harry absently placed his folder down before him, settling his long-emptied mug atop it, and couldn't help but smile a little as he watched Von scrubbing his eyes. No one who saw him in the full throes of his work would think Von could ever appear slovenly, and yet…
The heavy wooden table sat in the centre of the room. Overhead, chains hung low around a metal contraption that looked far too similar to the pictures Harry had seen in some of Jackie's medieval torture books. Chairs were flung about the room – looked to have been literally flung for the way most of them lay on their sides – and spaced throughout –
Draco nodded knowingly. That truth was one he understood only too well. Never perfect, even if he thought he might have come damn close in recent months. "True," he said. "To be honest, I don't think I'd make such a demand even if I thought I could get better."
Harry had rarely thought of anyone as beautiful before – or at least no one that wasn't viewed only through a television screen, or on the cover of a magazine glaringly airbrushed. But to his eyes, Draco seemed to grow only more attractive the more he looked at him. He found himself simply staring sometimes and realising that he loved the darkness of his eyes, the curve of his lips, the exact hue of his white-blond hair and how it was always styled just so. That, and he had a killer jawline. And his shoulders were perfectly wide but not too wide. And maybe he'd stared too long at his arse to be considered appropriate at school but...
Ginny grinned down at him, sparing him the courtesy of a brief glance. "It is," she said, flashing the phone towards him. "It's got a camera, you know."
He didn't really need to find Ron. He wasn't hungry, either. And yet, after a moment of slow-minded contemplation, Harry was hauling himself to his feet in search of his friend. Only to pause momentarily as the room seemed to flip upside down.
They spoke for a time. Jill of her own presentation, which she apparently wasn't allowed to partake in after Mrs. Joyce finally seemed to realise that she wasn't actually a C&C student. Abel had been in a near-panic as a result.
Harry blinked. Then he almost snorted at himself and his train of thought. Ginny and her suggestions were putting ideas into his head. As if he hadn't been contemplating Draco and the strangeness of their relationship, of Draco's shoot, and of the words that continued to echo in his mind enough already. He truly hadn't considered the prospect as more than a passing thought, a recognition of attractiveness, until Ginny had elaborated on it. But when he thought about it…
"Seven days is hardly quickly to chase down a kidnapping," the woman said. She was tall, thin, her hair pulled back in a severe tail, and she carried an air of competence about her that would have convinced Harry of her status even if she hadn't claimed she was 'an authority'. "You're a difficult family to find."
"It doesn't matter," Dot interrupted him as though he hadn't been speaking at all. She didn't spare him a glance as she fixed her gaze upon Harry. "I'm only telling you so you don't find out from someone else and act irrationally."
Pansy flinched and Draco did right alongside her. He didn't even need to share a glance with her to know they were wavering upon the same wavelength.
Harry blinked. He frowned. Straightening slightly in his seat, he tipped his head curiously. "Why do you do that?" he asked, and maybe it was that he was no longer working with Draco, but it somehow felt more relevant to ask that confusing question now than it had been weeks before. "For that matter, why do you carry that camera around with you? Is it just a personal one or…?"
to sound. None came, not for a long moment, but Lily sighed again nonetheless and pushed herself upright.
Harry, dragging his own attention from them – was it really so interesting? – blinked towards Jill. "Um… Yeah, no, it was alright." Then he paused. "Wait, scratch that, it was complete bollocks. No one but me did any work."
Draco nodded as though he truly understood. "A valid assumption. What I was referring to, however, is the abuse that is often involved in Muggle-Wizard interactions. Magic is…"
But the teacher didn't appear to realise that. Or maybe she didn't care. Most likely she was as oblivious as Harry was, which wasn't how school excursions and curriculum activities were supposed to be conducted, but what did he know of school operations? He'd only attended them for the past twelve years of his life.
"PJ, mate, just hold on for a second," Harry said, hauling the giant of a dog to a stop with a winding grasp on his leash. He endured PJ's sloppy kisses as he bent to unclasp him from his collar. "Gross."
"Love, you're the only one of us who isn't." Ignoring Ron herself as he continued to splutter, Ginny pointed a dismissive finger at his half-finished glass. "It's 'cause you drink like a bird, Harry. Put it away a little faster and you'd be up to your fourth round like the rest of us."
For a long pause, Dot didn't speak. Her expression was flat, her stare unwavering, and her lips slightly downturned. When she eventually met Harry's gaze once more, nothing but the slightest twitch of her eyebrow shifted in her flat expression.
"Hey, I'm your mother in this relationship," Hermione said, already drawing her wand to clean up the splatter.
"Yeah, whatever," Draco said, draping an arm around Harry with real casualness that Harry doubted he could ever manage to emulate. "Just maybe not when people are watching."
And then – gone. In a whirl of motion, her ragged skirts sweeping around her, Bellatrix turned and strode from the room. The door banged shut behind her and seemed to shake the whole room.
Draco didn't know what a 'Thunderbird' was in the Muggle world, thought it probably didn't have much to do with a real Thunderbird, but that hardly mattered. He flipped through the glossy pages and absorbed the fine print, half of which he didn't understand for the Muggle references.
Harry stared at him silently. The shame was still there, the regret as thick as ever, and the urge to apologise once more welled in the back of Harry's throat like a choking weight. But he didn't speak, and when Draco finally turned back towards him, it was a struggle to hold his gaze.
Harry didn't particularly like it. He didn't like it, but he allowed it. Because why not? Simon wanted it, and Harry didn't
Draco's stream of mental curses screeched to a halt. It was all he could do to keep his blank mask firmly affixed to his face. To look at Pansy would have shattered it, so he stared at Picard instead. Stared without seeing, because –
Blaise made quotations in the air to accompany his words before folding his arms across his chest. He smirked as he watched Harry consider his words.
"Now, look here, you pair of stuck-up, pampered little fucks," Jackie said, not quite loudly enough to draw Joyce's attention but enough that Draco's eyebrows snapped up and Pansy reared in her seat. Jackie didn't seem to notice – or, more likely, she simply didn't care. "You sit up there, in your rich little boarding school, and look down at all of us commoners. You think you're so much better than us, don't you?"
Draco paused. He closed his eyes briefly, prayed for the strength to withhold from firing a hex, and turned slowly towards the window. It was a struggle not to glare at the oblivious owl perched on the window sill.
Harry didn't really know what to say to that. He didn't know whether he was supposed to agree or dissent to the offer she didn't quite hand him. But he shook her hand. Then Gertrude left. Then room fell silent. And, all of a sudden, Harry found himself in the unyielding hands of Dorothea Picard.
With his words, a silent switch was flipped amongst the Hogwarts students. Blaise's casual swagger vanished and the lazing in his seat seemed more akin to the threatening laze of a tiger. Pansy's hooded regard sharpened, Theo tightened like a coiled spring, and in movements so slow that it was almost imperceptible until they were fully standing, Vince and Greg rose to their feet. Harry decided in that moment that maybe the title of bodyguards was quite accurate indeed.
It was cold, but Harry's enthusiasm staved off the chill. The breeze was icy and crisp, but it seemed to coax him on rather than hold him back. It had been less than a week since he'd travelled to London to see the museum and a little over a day since he'd last seen Draco, but the hours seemed so much longer than they should have. It wasn't Draco's fault that he couldn't visit the previous evening as he so often did, and not because their pretence of studying had been discovered. Harry didn't bother to feign studiousness as he ducked out the door every night.
"Mr Evans will take you to the Headmaster's office," Ms McGonagall said. "Accompany him and explain the necessities of the situation, if you would."
He clicked his tongue, jerked his head sideways and cursed under his breath. It wasn't so much that speaking such words were humiliating. It was more that he couldn't. He didn't know how. Draco had never declared his feelings to anyone before, romantically or otherwise. He'd assumed that how he felt on the matter, what his actions spoke for him, had conveyed themselves adeptly enough. Apparently not.
Madame Clementine's establishment – her studios, her reception, her back rooms cluttered with every clothes rack and vanity that a model could need – was more like a hotel than an office building. Removed from Lucerne as it was, the opportunity to immerse itself in magic was far more possible than it was working in the city and for the companies that Harry had been a part of. That
Draco packed up slowly that evening. So slowly that he was one of the last to leave the conjoined rooms that sat adjacent to the studio he'd spent most of the day in. The clock on the wall ticked steadily closer to six o'clock, but Draco hardly noticed. Just as he barely noticed his hands moving as he packed away the last of his equipment.
The blond, glancing towards the girl, pressed his lips together thinly. Then he clicked his tongue. "Fine. Whatever." He turned back towards Harry and Jackie. "You two will –"
"Which you won't," Harry said, propping an elbow onto the arm of his hair and resting his cheek in his hand his hand. He smiled. "I've heard you're pretty good."
It was tight. A brief moment of painful. Foreign and not at all like his own fingers. A muted sound uttered from Draco, but Harry barely heard him. His ears were deafened with his own rapid heartbeat, with his deliberately slow breaths that repeated
Draco nodded sharply once more and Harry sighed, shaking his head. "You're both being a little excessive, aren't you?"
That moment had stung and was at least half of the reason Jackie made a point of hating the Physical Education department at the school. Harry had confidence in his skills as a footballer; he just didn't think he could manage if even the coach didn't want him on the team.
Von muttered something else beneath his breath, but he sounded more amused that derisive when he continued. "You know, most people choose one of the other."
It was just in time to see Draco's eyes rolled to the ceiling, his lips murmuring inaudibly as though in a plea to the heavens, before he dropped his attention back to the camera before him. Behind him, the two crewmen were muttering between themselves, shaking their heads slightly, but Harry barely noticed them. Not when Draco flickered his gaze up to meet his own and just slightly raised an eyebrow.
He'd done it. How? Why did it work now? How had he made a fire without a wand, made water before that? That wasn't how magic was supposed to work… was it?
make a habit of taking your picture out of the studio?" Hermione asked from his side, correcting herself as she'd taken to doing of late. She was frowning slightly. "Why does he do that?"
Like the two-way mirror he'd gifted Harry as a Christmas present that was apparently a traditional sixteenth birthday gift to every child in his extended family.
"I thought you just said it was gross," Harry said, nearly cross-eyed as her eyed the picture before him.
Harry felt his cheeks warm. Draco never pushed, never tried to force Harry into moving faster than he chose to, but the suggestive comments were certainly coming more frequently these days. Leaning towards him, Harry pecked him briefly upon the lips. "Shut up, you prat."
Draco snapped his chin up so fast he nearly hurt himself. His mouth flopped open, jaw protesting the motion, but he barely noticed. Harry had… he'd just… "What?"
Draco's stared right back at him. He smiled, slow and wide, and Harry's own blossomed once more. Even in the face of the beauty of Lucerne's sunset, it was the most breath-taking thing he'd ever seen.
Jackie smirked. Just like that, her frustration cleared, and she was back to being the loud, slightly abrasive, but entirely affectionate friend he'd had for years. It hadn't even taken a proper explanation, because Harry knew she didn't need it. She would likely understand better than anyone what he meant by 'scared'. Jackie wore a hard armour in the form of a sharp tongue and blatant confidence, but it was as much to protect the soft pieces underneath as it was a natural part of her personality. She'd been burned by harsh words, too.
"You shouldn't," Draco said, maybe a little more vehemently than was necessary. But he couldn't help himself. He didn't really want to hold it back. "You shouldn't worry about such things. It's not a passing fancy, I swear. Not for me. And it's not just lust, because it's –"
"Don't worry, Mr. Neat-Freak," Ginny said, patting his head affectionately again. She didn't miss the swat of his magazine this time. "We'll keep your place spick and span. That's what magic's for."
The minimal breakfast the next morning – Draco hadn't asked as Harry had half expected him to but simply accepted the scarcity – and the idle conversation that hadn't really been conversation was kind of nice nonetheless. When they'd left, Harry to head for a quick run to the gym and Draco to get to the studio early, Draco had paused in step and stared at him for a long moment, his gaze unfathomable but somehow saying so much.
"What the fuck am I doing?" he asked himself in barely a whisper, just as he had countless times before. Really, what was he doing? Pining like some lovestruck teenager for someone who thought he only wanted him for a quick fuck? Why hadn't Draco told him it wasn't that? That it was more than that? He should have… he could have…
Tonks, Lavender Brown, and Colin Creevy. Dumbledore, Snape, and Moody. Flashes of others, tripping over one another, mingling across the blank slate of the shapeless body in a sickening skew of features. It evolved into Death Eaters he recognised who had stood at the end of his wand. Snatchers. Classmates who had turned. Hated faces, as hated as Voldemort - Bellatrix, Greyback - and even those who weren't so hated but were still enemies. Those who'd been opposed to him only for being on the other side of the war.
"I don't believe that Mary Matron would have been quite so popular had I not published that article of her supposed celibacy," she said, raising a hand to tap her chin thoughtfully.
For whatever reason, it felt more comfortable than the bed, even if it was something of a tight fit for the both of them. Extended across all three of the cushions, Draco lay half on top and to the side of Harry, slightly wedged against the back. His legs tangled with Harry's own, his arms firmly and instinctively wrapped, and even if his head was at a bit of an awkward angle between the cushion and Harry's shoulder, he looked comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than he'd been before the NEWTs.
"Yes, I can see that." Dot eyed Draco with the same blunt assessment she'd trained upon Harry. Draco, to his credit, didn't even twitch. "I'd thought so, from your calls. I take it I don't need to tell you both the mess that will inevitably erupt from whatever is going on between the two of you?
"Okay, now I'm a little bit worried." Despite his words and their abrupt clearness, Ron sounded more engrossed than concerned. "You don't get excited about anything these days. This is weird."
Ron was silent for a moment, and Harry listened mutely to the clicking and scratching sounds of his work as he trotted across the street. He wasn't usually allowed to walk far by himself coming out of his agency's building, because everybody and their uncle seemed to know that the nondescript façade hosted Dorothea Picard and, thus, Harry. They'd had many a questionable swarm of guests, photographers, and fans clogging the street in the early days of Harry's career, enough that Dot had invested an exorbitant amount in Repulsion Charms that extended beyond the simple Muggle-Resistant wards. They worked well enough, but one particularly persistent fan or reporter still managed to slip through on the odd occasion.
"I wouldn't bother. She'd just tell me it was my own stupid fault before giving me a disgusting potion." Head tipping to rest his cheek atop his knees, Harry returned his gaze out the window, to the frost and darkness that spread like a film across the mass of shadows beyond,. "She's seen a whole lot worse."
in Montreux is one of the oldest Wizarding castles in the country, you know. Witches and wizards are given ready access to it as a form of visitation right. If you could go…"
Draco trailed off before snapping his head sharply to the side. The muscles in his cheek bunched again, visibly distending the angular line of his jaw. He seemed to struggle with himself for a moment before speaking in a low, fast voice.
Harry peered at the upside-down image that Jackie had become engrossed in. It looked like a mutilation. A violent mutilation, and Harry didn't quite know what an actual disembodiment had to do with the magic trick of 'Sawing a Woman in Half'. He was fairly sure it wasn't supposed to happen like that.
It was kind of weird, but the touch of satisfaction and, daresay, happiness evident in Draco made it worth it to Harry. Definitely.
The moment time he dropped them off at Mr. Hastings' door, the bell sounded in a tinny wail through the corridors. Harry glanced over his shoulder, hand raised to knock on the glass, and paused. "Oh, crap. That must have taken longer than I thought."
It was Harry's turn to pull a face, though Hermione had leapt upon Ron's words, diving headfirst into explaining just why theoretical and practical were very, very different types of learning, and he doubted either of them noticed. Turning away from them, he picked up his pace a little to step around the pair of junior girls headed down the aisle towards them, offering them both a smile that they returned in kind as they passed. He caught a word or two as he did so, a brief "try out for the team" that was nothing if not utterly normal conversation, and unexpectedly halted into a flux of consideration. Rather than listen to Ron defending the merits of experience over book knowledge, and Hermione arguing the exact opposite, Harry turned towards the Head Table.
"She's got a really interesting presence," Harry murmured as Draco flicked to another picture. "The way she holds her shoulders, I think."
At that moment, however, the refinement of the room barely registered to him. It was a little difficult to maintain such awe when, for the past months, Harry had felt as though he were simply rolling from one such room to the next. Even the position of the glass cup on the heavy wooden table before him, the surface polished to a shine, was almost identical to the last. He settled back in the comfortable couch – the fabric was red this time, and distinctly reminiscent of Gryffindor colours as so much of the upholstery in those rooms seemed to be – and with blank detachedness watched the chaos that swirled around the room.
It was less of a request and more of a demand. Harry felt his hackles rise in Jackie's absence. He was usually happy to take the back seat when she held the reins but without her? "Excuse me?"
Bellatrix paced like a caged tiger, as though she were the one locked in the room and not Harry. She glared at him so fiercely it was as though she were trying to burn holes into him. She likely could. Harry feared she could. That she would.
It was something very close, however, when he positioned himself as requested in a loose cluster with his friends on the floor, 'chatting' in an 'action' shot in which Hermione's lips were too pursed and Ron looked slightly constipated. It was close when he accepted Ron's elbow propped atop his shoulder for their paired shot, and Hermione's comfortably linked arm, and Ginny's slouching lean.
He tipped his head and waited for Harry to fall into step beside him before following in Madame Clementine's wake. This job was an opportunity for him, and the lack of animosity he'd encountered until that moment was above and beyond what he'd been offered in almost every job he'd encountered in the past. But, with the comfortable weight of Harry at his side, the weight of what his company meant, Draco thought that the phone call he'd made in in England, his last desperate, spur-of-the-moment plea, was the best choice he'd made in a long time.
Jackie glared. And grumbled. And slouched in her seat alongside Pansy where she'd deliberately placed herself as far from Harry as possible. Pansy's proximity seemed to distract her briefly, especially when Pansy began to whispering intermittently into her ear for the second half of the movie. Dinner, however, had her returning right back to her glaring.
It left Harry in the unfamiliar role akin to a concerned but helpless brother. He wasn't even sure if he should be concerned as he watched Blaise follow Jill into their room, saw him playfully nudge her with an elbow with a whisper in her ear that elicited an outburst of laughter from her in return. He was so distracted watching the two of them that he startled slightly when Draco leant into him to murmur in his own ear.
For a moment, Harry could only sit on the floor beside his bed and breath. For some reason it seemed to take a whole lot of concentration. Only when Draco's words, his assurances, echoed once more in his head could he kick himself into motion. If Draco was coming to meet him, to get him and take him away from Harry's family who were being nothing if not cruel with their silence, then he'd be ready for him.
Pansy only smiled languidly. She even went to far as to almost recline in her chair, legs extending before her. "Is that delight I can hear in your voice, Draco, dear?"
He trailed off, but it didn't take much guesswork for Harry to join the dots. Oh. So Pansy had someone too. That was… unexpected. Or maybe it wasn't. Harry didn't know but didn't comment or ask further.
Draco might not know it was a date, but Harry didn't care. He was spending the day and grabbing a bite to eat with a bloke he decided he definitely fancied, even if he was still a bit of a prat. That was enough for Harry.
"Not that I don't commend you both for studying more," Hermione said, "but maybe you do need to slow down a bit, Harry. Take a break every now and again."
Draco shook his head but it wasn't quite in denial. With a shrug and a surprisingly casual, un-Draco-like gesture, he released Harry's hand to instead drape his arm around his shoulders. It was entirely unexpected, and Harry might have been stopped short if he hadn't already paused in step.
Instead of answering Harry's question once more, he posed his own. "Why won't you let everyone know?"
It was a rush of colour, sound, and excitement. Of mayhem and too many people that somehow didn't seem to be annoyed at one another for their close proximity but rather wove together with practiced steps and easy camaraderie. It was, Harry thought, unlike any mall he'd ever seen – which made it positively fantastic.
"What's more important," Harry overrode him. He didn't want to have that particular discussion just yet; not when he was growing increasingly aware of his mounting crush. "Is what
"As far as I'm aware, no," Harry replied, sparing Ron and Hermione a briefly apologetic glance. Jackie's wore bluntness and tactlessness like a comfortably gaudy coat; she didn't ever seem to know when etiquette suggested she dress in something less of an eyesore.
"Yeah. Maybe." A beat of silence met his words as Harry returned to chewing his lip, but Ron could never hold his tongue for long. "Do you want to tell me who it is, or -?"
They were sickening. Draco hated it, could hardly look at the articles, and not only because they were all exactly the same. They were deluded, because Harry didn't 'reveal all'. Draco knew he hadn't. They were entitled, because what right did they have to ask further questions? Their compassion was a farce, the sympathy indulgent, and the adoration was only a reboot of what the Wizarding world had clung to for years, the Muggle world the same but simply in different words.
"Like hurting people. Stories seem to have gotten a little bit muddled along the way. Just because the cult they were dragged into was responsible for such acts of violence doesn't mean that everyone caught up in it participated. It doesn't mean that they all approved, either."
She was too enthusiastic, but Harry supposed that was only to be expected. The reporters and interviewers were all the same; they tried to make nice, to be friendly, and all in the name of slipping under Harry's skin when the time was ripe in an attempt to drag forth the tantalising little bits of information that he hadn't revealed yet "surely kept personal and out of the public eye", if the papers and wealth of magazine articles were to be believed. He was used to it. He'd fallen prey to them too many times, had slipped up unwittingly, to not keep a close watch on his tongue. He was –
The intensity of Draco's regard spiked further at that. Before Harry's eyes, something seemed to change. It shifted, morphing slightly, and though he wasn't sure what it was, it was as though a switch had been flicked behind Draco's eyes.
But he had other plans for that night. Plans that provided the welcome relief from the persisting hubbub that surrounded him.
"You been out gallivanting around, kiddo?" Sirius interrupted her. "Got yourself a bit of a night life?"
It was a shame that Harry couldn't kiss Draco. When he drew before him, the urge to do so was like a physical itch that demanded to be scratched. Somehow, he refrained. They'd talked about it, he and Draco, and Harry had admitted that he hadn't told his friends just yet.
A respite. A break. Even after year it still felt like such a novelty. Why had no one prepared her for how exhausting wrestling with a child was everyday? They'd
"Jackie's actually allergic to reading anything but gore," he said lightly. "I worked that out years ago."
He knew he'd had autonomy, at least to a degree. Draco knew that he should have known better, and a part of him had. Yet even in the face of the violence, the fear, and what had progressed to death and destruction so quickly and uncontrollably, Draco couldn't turn away. There was a part of him, even as he saw his classmates being shot down by Death Eaters, that whispered it was right. That it was how it was supposed to happen. That the Dark Lord had to win.
"A favourite? God, I don't think so. There were so many places, and all of them incredible for different reasons."
Draco's arms tightened around Harry and Harry couldn't help but grin. He couldn't seem to shake it for long, it seemed; with his nervousness swept aside, only delight seemed to lie in its wake. "I'd rather you didn't."
Harry shrugged. "No problem. You guys right to talk to Mr. Hastings and make your own way back down to your class? It's literally just down the stairs, three corridors, and out the double doors."
Harry couldn't find the words to reply. He couldn't tell her that it didn't matter, that he didn't care, and that he was sorry too. With a feeble, wavering hand, he could only cling to his mother's shirt and rest his head back against hers.
"You should have heard them in the car on the way over," Hermione said, rolling her eyes. She tucked a leg up onto the couch, somehow managing to wriggle her toes beneath Harry's own leg so they made an odd yet comfortable tangle together. "I could hardly hear the radio."
Harry felt Draco's arm tense around his own tight shoulders. His hand, hanging against Harry's collar, curled slowly curl into a fist. Abruptly, Harry decided he was pretty goddamn pissed off, too.
How he hated it. Draco hated that he could even think to disregard it. It wasn't right, because… because…
"Muggles can't know about magic, Harry," Draco said, leaning towards him in a way that was different to the intimacy they'd shared earlier that afternoon. "That's how disasters happen."
"Eh, we'll find someone," Harry said with a shrug. It was only half true, because Harry had been on the side of singularity in group work situation more times than he could count. He didn't mind it so much anymore, and hardly considered it would be the worst thing in the world should he and Jackie have to work as only a pair.
"Understandable," Draco said. He reached a hand for Harry's as his fingers tangled between themselves. "It hasn't been so long as for anyone to be okay with it just yet."
– and for a brief moment Harry's terror was thin enough that he could think, that he could recognise that Bellatrix's wandlessness was a good thing. Until her hand dove into her pocket and extracted a knife.
They were all staring at him. There was such a wealth of expression in each of them, consideration as Harry had never seen before, that he didn't quite know what to say. Instead of explaining – he wasn't quite sure why, but explaining felt like the right thing to do – he tipped his head down the hallway. "That's Von. I've mentioned Von, right?"
"Far from it, Pansy. If you claim there's riot and intrigue then I'm sure it exists – only that it's far less interesting than you make it out to be."
The comfortable exchange, a backdrop to Draco's setting up and Dawley and Yu's murmured conversation, was nothing if not familiar. It had become so over the past weeks. Regardless of the fact that it had only occurred twice before, it felt somehow natural. When Von arrived, which he would at any moment, it would be just the five of them. Just the five in their small space, an isolated bubble in the midst of
It was downright uncomfortable and half of the reason that Harry had returned to school at all. Maybe more than half, even. At least most people at Hogwarts had been through the Battle too. They still saw him as the person he'd been before Voldemort's defeat – or mostly did. People like Slughorn, like the wide-eyed first years, and a speckling of other students didn't seem quite capable of that.
"No thank you," Harry tried to say as Susan jiggled his arms, all but tossing his to and fro with each motion. It was the most he could manage, and even that was garbled.
Not that Harry could be distracted for long, however. In the corner the furthest to the back of the library, he thought he'd discovered the main reason Draco had asked him to study on the weekend. Sadly, it wasn't for a date, though Harry thought this might have been the next best thing.
"About as bad as you did," Jackie said, and the unspoken elephant in the room remained unacknowledged. Harry doubted he would have performed well either if their roles had been reversed.
Hermione nodded. Ginny was determinedly open about her exploits; she made a point of keeping Harry updated of when she was having a photoshoot, explaining that she deemed it 'relevant' to him because of his own job. "Yeah," Hermione said. "She burst into my house yesterday afternoon and it was all, 'Hermione, listen to what happened' for nearly an hour before I could actually get the whole story out of her. Unfortunately, Ron was over at the time, so…"
Jackie grumbled under her breath as she headed for the bathroom. As soon as the door swung shut, he slipped down the corridor on silent feet towards the Hogwarts students.
It was incredible. Impossible - but Harrys saw him do it. He saw, and he felt the heat of the fire, the smooth slickness of the glass flower, the softness of the feathers. He heard the pop that signalled Draco's arrival when he hastened to the side street near his house every morning, barely slowing in leaping from bed in the morning farewell Lily and James before tearing out the door.
Malfoy didn't reply to that, so Harry took it as a win. He didn't speak after that either, simply waiting as Harry leaned back over the microscope lens. He didn't dump Harry onto the floor, however; if anything, his shuffling shift on the stool made Harry's seat a little more comfortable.
"Distraction," Sirius said, tilting his head in such eerie similarity to PJ's own head-tip that it was a little creepy.
Harry couldn't do anything about those problems. He couldn't really do anything at all. What he could do, however, was glare at the chipped, empty mug and curse it to hell until it filled with water.
Harry blinked again. He opened his mouth before closing it again almost immediately. That was… unexpected. Also unexpected, like everything else about what was rapidly coming to feel like the Draco Situation. Harry flipped hesitantly to page fifty-nine and eyed the isolated paragraph quoted by Cragstone himself at the very centre. It was just as flowery as the rest of the chapter, but if Draco had meant what he said…
Draco's arms tightened briefly, just slightly but enough that Harry paused. When he glanced down at Draco, it was to find his face blankly composed but staring up at Harry within unblinking focus. All residue of sleep had been erased, just like the slight mess of his hair.
Lily nodded, and Harry sighed. He knew she wouldn't back down from such a restriction. Hogwarts might be just about the safest place in the world for anyone facing a magical threat but it apparently wasn't safe enough for Lily. Harry didn't think being clad in bubble-wrap and locked in a bulletproof safe would be safe enough for her, even when Bellatrix found.
Not an easy task but simple enough in theory. What made it hard was the vibrancy of the light. The sound of the crash of contact. The splinter of wood as the dummy shattered, and the scatter of those splinters in a spraying array at the mannequin feet. Harry hadn't flinched, but he'd noticed those that did. He hadn't whimpered, but he heard more than a few voices that couldn't stop themselves. He hadn't even blinked, couldn't look away from the point of destruction, and barely noticed when his arm dropped limply to his side.
He didn't need to confirm her supposition, however, because Jackie continued with barely a pause. "Then you should go." Her lips still trembled in the light of the
Harry nodded. They'd said as much before, but it felt different this time. "Yeah. Because you're warm, and kind of soft."
Bellatrix leapt towards him, but Harry didn't wait to be caught. Not this time. He didn't think to flee, but his body did it for him. Shaking and exhausted as he was, his legs moved and he was throwing himself across the room in escape.
would be boring. The show with the magician guy will be awesome. Even better if you challenge him to a trick-off."
"But then how -? How are you going to get -?" Harry cut himself off with a shake of his head. Why did he care? It shouldn't concern him with what Draco was doing here. It shouldn't be his problem if he'd missed his bus and may not have any way of returning to his school. Harry didn't know exactly where Hogwarts was, except that it was over the Scottish border. That was at least a decent length drive away, wasn't it?
It was strange, but somehow, in a short time, Harry had become the bridge between his friends' floundering. He wasn't sure if he particularly enjoyed his newfound duty. It was far easier to let them flail and either sink or swim. Besides, he had other places he could be. Other places he wanted to be.
Harry shook his head as she rambled. Typical. Utterly typical. He should have guessed from the week before when Mrs. Joyce had announced their joint project that Jackie would propose something of a similar flavour. Though they'd both dropped the subject years ago, Jackie had always had a thing for Harry's magic.
Zipping his lips, Harry crouched briefly to tie his laces before straightening once more. Brushing himself down to make sure he hadn't really killed himself, he trotted down the hallway into the kitchen.
Draco leaving with a parting display of magic was one such habit. Releasing Harry's hand, he edged a step backwards, glancing both ways along the length of the empty road as he always did, Draco raised the wand between them.
"Morning, bub," Von said, smiling with a flash of white teeth and blatant delighted. He barely turned that smile upon Harry's friends but to nod in greeting before grinning back at Harry. "So, guess where I've just heard down in the Stylist's Den? You'll never guess, so I'll tell you."
Draco loved it. He never would have thought it possible to become partial to something so completely Muggle in nature but he loved it. Chemicals and chemistry wasn't potions, but it was close enough and unexpectedly nostalgic. Never was Draco more content than when he worked in the dark room that felt more and more like his, despite being in a building hosting experts in the field.
"Nothing. It's – no, it's nothing." Shifting slightly, leaning just a little more comfortably against Draco's chest, Harry resumed his reading. Draco took a little longer to return to his own, but when he did, it barely jostled Harry at all. Before Draco had opened his book, Harry was flicking to the next chapter. Skimming, if vaguely, but largely discarding the contents that Draco had brushed aside.
Studying together and yet alone, that was, because to consider additional company was off the table. Despite that he knew Ron still grappled with old grudges, and that Hermione pointedly allocated a number of hours each afternoon to their schoolwork, Harry found himself in Draco's company and pouring over textbooks more and more often.
Jacob glanced between them, smirk reverting to a sneer. "It's a good thing that I didn't ask for your permission, then," he said. He flicked a finger around their table, encompassing the Hogwarts students. "But you lot? You're not from around here, which makes you intruders in our territory."
"Yeah, James, you're encouraging," Harry said, dropping down onto his haunches at the bottom of the stairs to tie his shoelaces. "You're a bad influence."
"I can't believe it," Harry whispered, closing his eyes again once more. "I don't even know what to think."
Sighing, resigning himself to the inevitable – for Sammy had a history of persistence when ignored – he opened his eyes and picked up his phone. Only to freeze when he caught sight of the name and number on the screen.
"Yeah, I saw that too." The kid tipped his head as he beeped a block of cheese past the scanner. "Are you as much of an asshole as everyone says you are? 'Cause, you know, I've read some pretty serious shit, and if you're really that much of an asshole then –"
In many ways Dot appreciated their aversion. It was far easier to go about her day when those around her didn't interrupt her for inane conversation, or to share a joke. Dot knew that many within the agency doubted she even still had the facial muscles remaining to enable her to laugh.
Winding his way to the bar, he hailed the barman with a gesture that took a solid five minutes to be noticed. When the barman sidled towards him, a pair of drinks in hand that he palmed off to the woman alongside Harry, he flashed him a brief nod.
They weren't touching shoulders anymore. Or not just shoulders. Pushing himself more decidedly upright, Harry cast a bemused glance around himself, at Draco who still slept, before scrubbing a hand across his face. He was sitting on Draco again, which wasn't a surprise anymore, really. Except that this time it was more than just 'on top of him'. Facing chest to chest, his legs framing Draco's where they extended before him, Harry realised that it must have been more of an embrace than anything as simple as sitting on Draco's lap. Draco's arms even rested in a loose clasp around his waist as though to embrace him in return.
Harry felt as Draco flipped the duvet back from Harry's bed. He felt when he slipped beneath the sheets, the springs of the mattress protesting slightly and the weight of him impressed at Harry's side. He flinched just a little as one of Draco's legs brushed against his own. Flinched, then shivered as a tremor tingled across every surface of his skin.
It was wonderful to consider, but daunting in a whole new way. What would this mean? What if his parents found out? Christ, what would Lily and James say if they found out he could do such a thing, that magic was real and that he could use it?
The lab didn't reply, but Harry didn't really expect him to. Potting Point was quiet to the point that it threatened a drift towards idleness-induced insanity, but he wasn't so far gone as to start sincerely talking to dogs. A final pat on the head, and Harry was starting down the footpath once more.
It was dark in the room. Dark and quiet, and cosily warm despite the veritable blizzard that a shrill wind beyond the window promised waged war outside.
It was largely empty. Chairs were spaced throughout, a few tables pushed to the walls, and the whiteboard that Jackie had abducted at one point weeks before – not to brainstorm ideas but to teach Pansy a warped version of Hangman – stood before the low stage. In the far corner, the Slytherins was sprawled with the kind of elegance that shouldn't be possible for teenagers, but Harry was coming to learn was typical of his friends and boyfriend. Somehow, even the way that Greg sat reversed on his chair with arms slung over the back, looked less lazy and more like postured positioning.
The models were suitably compliant. The hours were long, but they weren't backbreaking. The facilities were respectful and fruitful, and Draco was all but given his head to direct the crew to their most useful purposes. It was all that he could ask for in a job, and even if it was offered to him out of pity, he would embrace the opportunity with both hands. Once, Draco would have been far too proud to accept such off-cuts, but not anymore. Definitely not anymore.
with his wand raised. So different to the flushed, intoxicated face, the panting breath and feverish grasping of hands that flooded Draco's mind whenever he thought of Ipetsky.
Draco stared at Harry with his confusing spectrum of emotions, and he made Harry think. He made him consider the hypocrisy of his own thoughts, and for once Harry felt almost ashamed for letting everything, all of that hate and anger and resentment, just go. Even if it was necessary. Even if he had to in order to properly move on.
He rose after that. He made his way through the nearly silent hallways, satchel slung over his shoulder and head down as he'd learnt was the easiest way to pass unnoticed. When he stepped into the elevator, it wasn't until the doors slid closed that he realised Billy and his companion stood at the back as the sole other occupants.
Instead, Harry focused on the pages of minute writing, the bleached parchment covered in spidery print that once would have turned Harry's ducking in the other direction but had now become a gruelling necessity that he committed himself to. Gruelling, but slightly less than it had been. Maybe Hermione had been right for all those years; the more he studied, the easier – slightly easier – it became.
The snort that Draco uttered wasn't entirely derisive. He shook his head, a solemn cast shadowing his face. "More the other way around. No good has come from non-magical people becoming too involved. More often than not it happens as a result of a Dark witch or wizard uprising, so…"
For some reason, some foolish reason, Harry's eyes blurred. Blinking fiercely, he swallowed the rush of emotion that threatened to sweep through him, catching him in its tumultuous tide. Straightening, lifting his head and glancing to the side just long enough to be sure he wouldn't really start crying, Harry nodded. "Thanks."
Harry couldn't afford another incident. Not like those that had come before it. The explosion that had erupted after he'd accidentally let slip that he wouldn't be returning to Hogwarts was one such instance that still resurfaced almost every interview, despite the school year already beginning once more. "What will this mean for the Wizarding world, for the education system, for his comrades-of-war that will be attending without him?" The headlines had been in bold and screaming for attention - though his or the rest of the world's, Harry wasn't quite sure. Maybe both.
For a second, Harry thought it was PJ, but no. Too big. Black. Fur too messy. Harry leant into that fur nonetheless, sinking against the warmth that buffeted against his numb skin. His eyes threatened to slide closed again, but then –
"Ipetsky is known to be an affable enough photographer, and he's good at what he does. Very good. Good enough to get away with certain indiscretions." The scraping of ceramic on wood was a hollow discordance to Draco's words, consistent and hollow. "No one would question him if he chose to act in less that reputable ways. No one would pull him up on it, either. That happens all too often with independent photographers; they have no leash. I would expect that most – most models, or subordinates, or – or apprentices would feel as though they had to…"
Malfoy didn't turn his head, but Harry could feel him glance at him sidelong. "You were going to mooch off me?"
He trailed off, and the silence that followed reverberated in Harry's ear. He almost couldn't breathe, his breath coming in stutters. His other hand rose to cusp the phone against his ear, and in the midst of a ballooning, incredibly warm swell in his chest, Harry realised he was nodding almost desperately.
Harry only vaguely heard James' reply, but not because of his weariness. Glancing up at Emmeline, he watched as she spoke, as she inclined her head towards Harry one last time, before leading Shacklebolt from the room.
Harry had learnt from experience. He'd learnt that it was necessary to dance and dodge his way through every interview, every attack from the paparazzi with their vehement questions flung his way. He'd learnt to keep an eye on any public room he attended, to be wary of eavesdroppers, because more than one story had been snatched unwittingly from him for such carelessness.
"You mean," he whispered back, turning his face until his lips all but brushed Draco's ear, "that you could show me?"
and its employees would think, about what Dot would say, about how the world would view him and his relationship with Draco. But the larger part found that, when he really considered it, he didn't care. He didn't care that the Wizarding world would be horrified that Harry had taken up with Draco Malfoy of all people, especially after the outrage arising from his position as Harry's photographer the previous year. He didn't care either that the rampant homophobia in the Muggle world would instantly reflect badly upon him, crippling his job opportunities and the positivity that lingered from before he'd 'disappeared'.
Her eyes narrowed. Her lip curled. A serpentine hiss sprayed flecks of spittle from her mouth. "Boy," she growled.
"Wait, wait, wait." Harry held up a hand. He closed his eyes briefly, struggling for a moment, before opening them. "Are you serious?"
Harry froze once more. He almost didn't dare to lift his gaze towards Malfoy and could only manage as much as flicking his eyes up towards him. Any thought of understanding and comprehending his mixed feelings dissolved beneath the weight of a greater concern. "What… are you doing?"
"More concerning in that we're not sure where you're headed every night," Lily said. Her face was tight even if she managed to keep her tone carefully neutral, and Harry winced at the distress he'd unwittingly caused her. She'd always been one to worry, albeit silently. "We trust you, Harry, and we know you're sensible enough to do the right thing and take care of yourself –"
Harry shrugged as casually as he could manage. He might disregard it as being 'too much of a trek', but magic and tricks had been a part of his life for so long that he couldn't help but love anything even vaguely related. Even if he had dropped his practise years ago, that interest had been rekindled into something new. Perhaps he could even pick up a thing or two. Harry usually only had to see something once or twice for him to be able to unravel the mechanics of it. Somehow, his fingers seemed to just make it work, as though they had a mind of their own.
The thought drew more forth, and some that had nothing at all to do with C&C. As he opened another library book, Harry found himself wondering what Draco would say when he found out that Harry was gay. He'd surely picked up on Jackie's sexuality given that she was about as far from hiding it as possible, but Harry's? Regardless of his noncommittal response to Jackie's openness, it was different when it was a guy. Different for a guy he fancied.
Just as he knew he shouldn't want to see Harry. That he shouldn't want him. That he shouldn't wonder what Harry was thinking of the interviews and photographs, shouldn't consider what his response would be to the articles that followed, shouldn't wonder what he was doing every second of the day.
Harry laughed and Von smiled over the edge of his mug. Only for that smile to slowly fade as his regard became intent. "How're you feeling?" he asked, almost gently. "About today?"
"And let me know when you'll be returning. Ideally, after a while, when the interviews have all been published and the Wizarding world in particular has time to calm down, you will be able to return without having to look over your shoulder for potential harassment. We'll see about doing a follow-up series when the time comes."
Harry cocked his head again. Any hint of a smile faded, and though Draco found himself regretting its loss, he didn't regret asking. The sudden need to know was abruptly fervent. "Why?"
It wasn't what Harry had expected to hear from her. Not the direction he'd anticipated she take. But he couldn't deny it, nor that he'd used the same excuse bed-bound in a hospital weeks before.
Von arrived. Pansy sat. Harry dutifully attended to her as he should. And, as Draco settled himself behind his camera and began filming, he found himself glaring fiercely. It wasn't at the camera that he scowled but at Samuel Ipesky's afterimage that still hung in the forefront of his mind.
"This afternoon?" Draco cocked his head. "I was already under the impression we were meeting at the library."
and that there really was no doubt that he was good-looking. Harry couldn't withhold his answering grin.
"Harry, then." Clementine nodded, half turning away from him but not quite shifting her attention. "I take it you've taken the chance to visit in the company of Mr. Malfoy?"
"Surprised he would dare," Keith said, still behind him. He wore a sharp smile seeming all the sharper for his pointed chin. Keith was as thin as a knife and just as cruel. "Not without his girlfriend to back him up."
Harry was used to being looked at. In some way or another, he found he always was these days. The excited fans on the street that recognised his face when he didn't hide himself well enough. The calculating, assessing stares of the casting directors and photographers alike as they clinically assessed his suitability for the role in form, in poise. The challenging or threatening or discomforted sidelong stares of his fellow models, the models that he'd never quite meshed with because
The shop attendant barely seemed to hear him. His finger switched back to Harry, his eyes drawn alongside it. "You – you up and disappeared," he said. "You just vanished, just like that, and no one knew –"
Harry stuttered to a halt at Draco's blunt interruption. Lowering his own fork, Harry dropped his gaze down towards the bowl before him. Why? Why did he do what he did? Why had be become a model when he would readily agree that it was about as far removed from any kind of route he'd felt he should have taken, from anything he'd felt competent enough to pursue?
For Harry, it meant sleep. A lot of sleep. He hadn't really thought he could manage it, but the opportunity was there and he managed it. There wasn't any excuse anymore, nothing to tie his hands and keep him up until past midnight with lies of study and productivity. The focus had shifted from narrowed commitment to wide, vague relaxation.
Harry glanced to the side for a moment, a twinge of thoughtfulness casting his expression vaguely distant. Then his face cleared and he corrected himself. "'The Plucked Cockatrice' I think is the Wizarding equivalent."
It wasn't because Harry had the seemingly naïve ability to draw the eye of everyone in the room either, though he did that, too. Whether for how he stood, or smiled, or simply because of who he was to so many of the Wizarding world, he captured attention like a spotlight was trained upon him.
Harry's laugh sounded almost like a sob. He ducked his head for a moment, closed his eyes to push back the pressure building behind them, and blinked up at Draco again. "Not really," he managed.
"We're your friends, sugar," called the voice from the wall directly behind him. A glance over his shoulder saw a round face and plump cheeks, a beaming smile flashing white upon the woman's dark lips. "A consolatory support group."
Draco had said, and the light of his want swum into his gaze. For a moment, Harry had been rendered mute, crushed beneath a wave of disappointment and helplessness. Even Draco. Even from Draco, it was all that was ever asked for. All that was ever wanted.
"Thanks," Harry said dryly. "In return, I won't call you an arrogant, stuck-up, aristocratic, pig-faced prat, even if that's what
"I thought you'd drowned in there," Draco drawled, lowering his teacup. "I was tempted to come in to fetch you with a fishing net."
"Ideally," Clementine said. "Not only an apt photographer but a dedicated worker, Mr. Malfoy? You do yourself proud."
After an initial bout of awkwardness in which Ginny talked too much, Hermione simply gazed thoughtfully, and Ron shifted so uncomfortably in his chair that there must have been a splinter protruding from the wood or something, it eased. It happened with the arrival of lunch.
closed, disregarding the Muggle news not as unworthy but as irrelevant for pursue further, Draco reached instinctively for the magazine alongside it.
Music buzzed in his ears – or maybe that was the voices of those around him. It took three tries to get his voice working loud enough to be heard. "Where's Ron gone?" he asked, though his tongue felt a little too thick and dry to properly enunciate.
Harry's stilted laugh was little more than another sigh, edged with hysteria and not really amused. It didn't really matter. Nothing did but Draco's hold around him, that he maintained that hold and somehow manoeuvred them to the nearest chair. The easy familiarity of following Draco's unspoken suggestion, climbing into his lap and hooking his legs on either side of Draco's, was so soothing, such a constant, that the stuttering hitch of Harry's heartbeat, the short sharpness of his breaths, abruptly eased.
"This room always brings out the best in people, hon," Calliope said, gentle and soft, like a soothing balm to the abrupt ache that had taken up residence in Harry's chest. "The best and the worst. The good and the bad."
"You'll give me your number this time?" Simon said just as quietly. Yet even in its quietness, Harry could hear the edge of a demand. A want. A need? Maybe not quite, but that forcefulness was definitely there.
Hands fumbling, pushing himself up on his knees and elbows, he grasped onto the warm firmness of Malfoy's legs, his shoulders, something hard and bony that was probably an arm, as much as the arm of the chair. "Sorry, sorry, sorry," he muttered absently with each fumbled attempt.
Abruptly, Pansy's composure became tinged by an edge of solemnity once more. Reaching towards him, she tapped a long nail upon the back of where Draco's hand had lowered to res on the tablet. "What are you going to do with yourself now, Draco?"
Hermione shrugged. "More that it hasn't changed. They still won't abide by supposed 'choice', you know?" She sighed. "You know, Harry, I don't envy your situation or anything, but it would almost be nice not to have to…"
He might be good-looking. He might be a guest of the school. He might not have anything much to do with Harry at all outside of C&C. But it did feel good to leave him floored.
Harry felt a shadow of warmth trickle into his chest, almost immediately chewing away at the wash of coldness he hadn't properly realised suffused him from the moment he'd stepped back into Hogwarts' castle. Hermione was far from a vibrant, eccentric person, and of everyone in the room likely favoured the colour palette the most, but she was trying. She'd already turned to the fireplace and cast a spell, an unexpectedly vivid splash of red, purple, and green erupting and immediately setting to burning the logs within.
Too comfortable. Warm, and close, and comfortable. Yes, Harry thought there was something definitely strange about him. Blessedly enough, Malfoy didn't seem to hate him enough anymore to do anything about it.
Harry winced again. Family politics weren't something he had much experience with; James' side of the family was practically non-existent, with his grandparents retreating back to his grandfather's motherland when he was only a kid and rarely visiting since, though when they did it was always affable. Lily's family was a little less appealing, and Harry hadn't seen the Dursleys in years. They'd never gotten along, and when his Uncle Vernon had almost popped a vein at learning of Harry's coming out, it had been the final straw for Lily. Vernon had always been a bigoted ass, and Lily admitted that her sister wasn't much better these days, to say nothing of their son Dudley.
Except that, in spite of that, Draco's hand felt nice. Especially nice when Harry still felt wobbly on his feet. Warm, comfortable, and natural in the best possible way. It was reassuring rather than disconcerting given Harry now found himself in such an suddenly different location to the side street he'd been standing on but moments before.
Harry's shoulders hunched towards his ears. He didn't know what it was about the room, about the 'romantic' setting as it was – which it still definitely was – and the portraits that asked too many questions and encouraged too enthusiastically. For whatever reason, the words had spilled from Harry's lips in a relentless torrent that he hadn't a hope of withholding. He'd spoken more in the past hour – hours? - than he thought he'd done the whole year before that, and that was even counting the tedium of equally relentless interviews he'd been forced into. The
Dimitri gave her a crisp smile. He was a short man, slightly plump, and he somehow filled the doorway despite his diminutive stature. His spiked hair, gelled precisely to quilled points, matching the cropped goatee upon his chin, spoke of one who took pride in his appearance. That much was even more apparent from the sleek lines of his trousers, his fitted vest and the folds of his overlong collar. Draco could respect that in a person. He'd never quite understood how anyone could step outside of their house without showing their best to the world. It would leave them far too open to attack.
It was stationed just to the side of his room, which was probably why Harry had missed it. A stand – no, a cot. A cot with a cradle nestled between its ornate ends. For a moment, the juxtaposing shadows swathing the room hid the contents, giving it the impression of little more than a formless bundle of blankets tucked beneath the half-raised hood of the basket.
