Harry waved his still empty hand expectantly.
The interior was just as interesting as the outside. A few chairs were floating while a cat underneath tried to bat at them. There was artwork on the walls, similar to paintings but not quite, the subjects moved among them as they shouted jokes and compliments as he walked by. What he liked the most was the kitchen where knives and forks chased each other around the cupboards before zooming out of the room.
“Okay
It wouldn’t be easy, but as Draco stood in Andromeda’s kitchen and stared at Harry, he felt happy and at peace for the first time in a long time. Harry wasn’t the cause or the catalyst but Harry
The grip on his wrist went lax and he knew that was Potter’s way of dismissing him, but Draco couldn’t step back, didn’t want to—instead, moved forward. When green eyes widened, Draco couldn’t withhold a smug smirk. It wasn’t often he surprised Potter these days.
“I can’t say for certain what will happen, but I know that things
“If we do, are you going to let me play with you? However I want?”
There was something about Potter that made Draco keep coming back. Most of it was the power, the energy and the way it felt just to be
Because his decision had already been made. The one to walk away. He just hoped Harry would understand.
“Yes, the Slytherin common room is in the dungeons.”
“You are so pretty.”
“You didn’t though, did you?”
The silence that followed was comfortable and for once, he didn’t feel like changing it, didn’t feel like he had to speak up or go out of his way to make the air lighter. It was nice, not having to try so hard.
“I just do all the work,” he pointed out dryly.
I am being told that my wellbeing matters. For 2 years I was eating scraps from the trash, rats, other animals and very limited food that I could scrounge, and none of the Order gave a fuck. But now that Grimmauld is needed, all of a sudden I matter again?”
“Have you ever considered that as a negative?”
“Oi!”
“Draco, are you ready to go?”
Minerva frowned as she looked between them and Draco was glad that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand.
“Do you?” Draco sneered as he gave into the urge and kicked the painting across the floor. “Because not once did you ever tell me that while you were alive.”
“Fuck,” Harry swore. “You look so good.” A red flush appeared on Malfoy’s cheeks and he wondered if Malfoy liked praise too.
“I’ve only had mild hail in my own class,” Draco mused with a shrug.
A scoff could barely be heard as Severus looked over his shoulder. “He used those and even my own spells against me until I learned to do them silently.”
“Did you find out why they are so hated?”
“I know you don’t understand it,” Harry tried for soft, not really sure he managed it. “But I’m not looking for a new place, nor am I looking to change anything.”
“Malfoy.”
Harry stilled when he thought back to the Magic he had felt last time they were there. The familiarity of it.
“My name’s Harry,” he said after some internal debate. He didn’t want to pretend to be someone else, the illusions and dyed hair were enough as it was.
“Do I think he would tell me? No. But he would tell my wife. They are much closer.”
his boyfriend.” A small pause. “And I thought you still held the hopes of being with him anyway.”
As soon as the hand was gone, Draco said, “Take off your trousers.”
“No, because I don’t pay attention to what other people do. I mind my own business.”
Physical pain was something Killian was familiar with—that Draco knew—but emotional pain? That had to be a new concept.
“You think I didn’t know when I got this what a colossal mistake it was? You think I didn’t know I had chosen the wrong side? You think I didn’t know that it would follow me for the rest of my life? Of course I did! But I had to survive, Thomas. I had to make it out of there and joining was the only option I had.”
Draco’s eyes closed at both images. “As nice as that is, and I do want that—” Merlin did he want that. “—I’m not prepped for that and I haven’t been magically tested in over a year.”
“Draco?”
Malfoy mouthed ‘broom closet’ before grimacing. “I’m going to take you to my department.”
Draco’s fingers tapped against his leg restlessly as he tried to tune Potter out. If he didn’t listen, then it wouldn’t affect him.
“I never claimed to be innocent.”
The concern was nice, but he couldn’t focus on that, it was just background noise. All his mind registered was Malfoy’s scent. It was unlike anything he had come across. Not only was it alluring but it was
That was when he realized they were at his flat and not Malfoy’s. The words were reverberating inside his head. Let him in. It was more than just inviting him inside, it meant more, it had to of. Right? Did he want to let Malfoy in?
“No, really. My actions aren’t determined by the prophecy. Whether I kill Lucius or not shouldn’t change the validity of a prophecy. It’s either real or it’s not.”
think. I don’t want to be what led me to seek you out. I don’t want to be that person, it’s not who I am.”
“If anyone can do it, it’ll be you,” Harry whispered.
end with the weather, could it?
“Fuck the winner,” Harry snarled. “I’m not staying here any longer.”
“Do you say that to all the boys?” Harry asked, a small curl of his lips lifting as a rush of flustered emotions flittered across Draco’s aura.
Painting-Malfoy froze, and Harry watched understanding flash across his face despite being confused.
While entirely accurate, it stung a little.
“I’d rather off myself.”
“Malfoy?”
“I didn’t deserve that. And you don’t know those stories or what I felt when they fell flat.”
“And what did he say?”
are we in your pantry?”
When the man continued to yell, Harry looked over and his eyes widened at the burned hand. Blisters had already formed, and the skin was peeling in some areas.
Harry’s eyes closed briefly. “I’m sorry. You don’t always say it back and that hurts. I thought you didn’t want me to say it. I thought—”
“Yeah, but still.”
“Sounds like a lot of work,” Bill said quietly, an arm around Fleur’s shoulder. “Thank you for this. If Ron didn’t pay you enough, let me know.”
There was a small smile from Leandra, and he wished he could return it.
“Ow! What the fuck?”
have appealed to him too.
I've said this before but I adore this Harry. He's a little ball of contradictions which I find so amusing. Finds emotions fascinating as long as they aren't his own. Loves taking from people but panics at the thought of Draco knowing more. He's my hypocrite boy, but that's okay shshks.
“I wanted your hands on me, Harry.” It was whispered unnecessarily sensual and ended with a lip bite and lingering eyes.
As much as Harry didn’t like his aunt, he couldn’t keep his eyes from wandering to the flowers she spent hours on every day. He wondered what they smelled like. Would they be as pretty as they looked? How soft were they? He ached to be in that world, one where other people were.
Luna whispered. “No Nargles but Burrowing Amares instead.”
The longer they tried, the more frustrated Harry became. He looked around the clearing, not seeing the other dragons. He could
“When Ron said it was bad, I didn’t think you’d be on the floor.”
Two more jars, two more people. Both weren’t moving, and if there really was a creator out there, then he prayed that they would be alive.
Draco tilted his head back and peered up at Harry. “I really am sorry.”
“Mhm.” Harry stretched until his neck was on display.
When the wetness spread, Harry closed the distance between them and pulled Draco into his arms.
It was all new.
“Soul Magic?” Lucius looked around; eyes narrowed in the
“Looking at you like this,” Malfoy murmured, wet fingers trailing down Harry’s cheek. “Makes me want to take you, here, right now.”
distracting manner.
Draco sighed heavily as he picked up his fork and debated about shoving the animal off his lap. He didn’t even bother looking at the monstrosity sitting on him, he knew there would be a smugness to those stupidly pretty eyes and that was just
No, no it wasn’t. “That’s disgusting.”
“Sure,” Harry lied easily. Not a chance in hell was that happening.
“No, I’m just too good for you.”
“No,” Harry shook his head, watching the way the Magic struggled against his own. “You can’t cheat death; you can only prolong it. Voldemort destroyed his soul for nothing other than a few extra decades of life.”
“I don’t think you came here to argue about pumpkin juice,” Luna said over a mug that was steaming, and his stomach lurched at the sight.
Harry could honestly say that he had
It was a good thing he didn’t have a heart anymore.
“Glitter gave me a private dance last week.”
anyone what he worked on outside of Blaise. “But I got most of my information from other sources and you didn’t know him that well.”
much Magic. Hundreds of years old, a lot of it sentient. “I’ve never seen so much Magic in one place.”
The wicked quality to Draco’s voice had him sighing heavily and he blamed Hermione for it. “Do tell more, Granger.”
Potter’s lips twitched, and Draco would’ve loved to know what was funny about being insulted.
“Killian said if you ever contacted him again, he’d file a restraining order with the Ministry.”
“What—”
“Merlin you are beautiful.” The admission caused Potter to flush, and Draco wished he had taken his own advice and not said anything at all.
Draco sat up straighter with arched brows. “You got between a Werewolf and a Vampire?
He just had to find him.
“God, I hate you.”
Lucius had said that someone had left Malfoy’s house by floo, but the only room with a fireplace was an office. An office that was clean,
“The normal vaults,” Potter said slowly. “Right underneath the front lobby like the other popular ones.”
Potter glanced at him briefly as Blaise and Ron started whispering to each other. “I think it’s sweet.”
“That’s different.”
“Absolutely.”
“Oh,” Luna whispered before she began to sing a low tune he didn’t recognize. “Jealousy.”
“What is the meaning of this?” A man with a green hat said, looking around the room alarmed. “Dumbledore what is going on?”
Amos leaned forward, and Draco knew he was intrigued. “Nadia was just made Department Head after Perry retired.”
Draco jerked out of Harry’s hold on him, only to stand up and glare. “This means war.”
Draco wanted Lorian to be found. He wanted there to be an investigation, he wanted the Vampire council to worry what that meant for them.
answers.
Always on Potter.
One of Nymphadora’s memories wouldn’t leave his mind. He wanted answers and he wanted them now. Nymphadora might not have known what was in that prophecy but Lucius Malfoy sure as hell did.
“Good job, Potter,” Malfoy whispered a breath away, noses touching.
“Tell me, does free will come with stipulations?”
“I have mine,” Lucius said, tone haughty as he placed a wand on the counter that even Harry could tell had never been used by Lucius a single time. Not an ounce of a Magical residue on it.
“What did I miss?” Neville asked when no one responded. His forehead was wrinkled, and he frowned at the wet table. “Ron, stop being messy, clean this up.”
“Can someone tell me what the water represents in regard to life?”
Draco grinned. “What if I want make a prophecy?”
“You love me,” Draco said to Narcissa, hand squeezing Harry’s, ignoring Lucius altogether. “But not enough to stay.”
“Necromancy?” There was a flushed look to Potter’s face, and he looked a few seconds away from vomiting.
Draco’s eyes closed tightly. “I love you too, you stupid, reckless, idiot of—”
“You’re breaking several treaties.”
Another look around the area had him sighing. He ignored the curious gaze from the portrait of the Fat Lady. This was the best spot to wait for the Harry.
That was a bit much too quick. Did Draco think they were partners? Was he ready for something like that? Did that even make sense in their current atmosphere? Being partners would get tough down the line. Did—
“Right.” Malfoy’s hands were wrapped around his wrist and it was distracting. What was he doing?
Mina leaned forward and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “I wish the founders had someone like you and your mate when the laws were created. Our world would be better off because of it.”
Draco smirked widely when Harry covered his face with his hands. “I am so bloody thankful that he is talking about you and not me,” He honestly admitted gleefully. “If only my own father was around to hear about it.”
A small laugh—one that had Harry’s head tilting, wanting to hear it again—was better than the hits he kept having to dodge.
“Hey! That one was legit,” Harry said as he squinted further in an attempt to see how annoyed Ron was, but the more he stared he was pretty sure it
was threatening.
Harry felt himself being lifted once more but the creature wasn’t doing it. The energy inside him grew and grew, his fingers buzzing with it. He looked down in time to see them sparking, light emitting from them. The only word that came to mind was power.
“Part of me always will.”
“Sure,” Potter agreed easily. “But the books themselves were incomplete and missing so much. History is always written by the victors and it shouldn’t be that way. So much is left out, so much so that I could fill a dozen books and still have things left over.”
Draco entered the kitchen in time to see Harry tacking up the next cover of the Daily Prophet. He wrapped his arms around a strong waist.
“Now,” Lucius cleared his throat. “Why is it you can’t go back to school?”
Draco shook his head, wanting to tell Harry that he could never forget. How could he? But he didn’t want to interrupt.
Lucius took a look around the destroyed room with pinched brows. The table had been knocked off its legs, the bookshelves were a mess of torn spines and pages, all the windows had been busted. The only things that were intact, were well, them.
The grip on his wrist became tighter.
“Wish me luck.”
Every time I write a journal entry for Draco, I like him more. Shsk does that sound odd? He's very complex but I like that about him. His dichotomy is definitely something that pulls me in.
“Merlin no,” Seamus blinked rapidly before he scooted closer to Harry. “What good what it have done? He would have rejected me—kindly—but still let me down. He would  have emphasized that he’s straight, emphasized our friendship and then things could have gotten weird.”
“You think the protection spells were the same? Lure people in?”
“That, and I’m also clean.”
. I didn’t know what to believe!”
Draco could see his aura.
Impatience manifested in an exasperated gesture, urging Goyle to continue.
would face. Three purebloods and two half-bloods. You’ll be fine. It’s people just like
When mischievousness entered Potter’s eyes and a slow smirk formed, Draco groaned. “You came in here to purposefully annoy me?”
Sirius’ shoulders slumped, and Draco felt sorry for him, sorry for everything that had happened. It wasn’t fair, none of it.
Draco blinked rapidly, not liking the sound of this at all. “Pardon me?” It seemed nice enough, but his tone was demanding an explanation.
Harry looked down in time to see his body shrink. Oh,
“I think that elemental magic
would have been proud. That’s just who he was.”
Panic. That was the first thing that Draco was able to make out on Sykes’ face. The man probably assumed his tracks had been covered. But it was Draco’s job to unearth the truth. “As I said earlier, my well wishes are with you. Not many people can do what I can, Mister Sykes. I wouldn’t make me wait much longer if I were you.”
“Um,” Neville lifted a finger. “That doesn’t make me feel any better.”
“Not a very good follower, were you?”
“I was hoping you forgot,” Draco turned his head enough that Harry could see he had stuck his tongue out at him, and he was tempted to buck Draco off.
Compatible. Draco’s hands gripped Potter’s waist as he sat up straighter.
“Do you ever abandon the dens?”
, then you have my well wishes.”
“I’m open to floor sex,” Draco panted against Potter’s lips. “But perhaps not when my foot is like this.”
“Sometimes.”
“How is that supposed to make me feel better?” He wasn’t nervous, no matter what Harry thought, but he would indulge his boyfriend if it made him feel better.
There was a fairy floating in front of him! Not a monster!
“I can tell,” Filius said as he sat down on a log next to Draco. “Why are you out here in the middle of a thunderstorm?”
“I really do like you,” Harry murmured as Ron slammed a door and Draco snickered.
Harry grimaced at the combination. Exploding ale was
“Sirius Black.”
Only when Malfoy’s impatience grew stronger and he pulled on his hair again did Harry wrap his lips around the tip of Malfoy’s cock and suck hard. While he might like sucking dick, he didn’t like the taste. The reactions were what made it exciting.
Lucius snorted. “And you think Muggles can hold a candle to us?”
“So I went to I.A,” Ron took a deep breath. “I told them
odd, but that doesn’t mean he ran away.”
“You think I don’t
“You thought it was a fight? Then what?”
“I’ve seen plenty of angry people in my life, both while alive and as a painting. Potter wasn’t just angry, he was explosive.”
“What—” His breath caught at a particularly hard thrust. “What about?”
he was missing something.
“Adventures are dangerous.”
“Astoria?” Nott asked, and for the first time since they arrived, the anger in his voice was replaced with an uncertainty that was uncommon.
Draco’s eyes closed, a small, beautiful smile, one he’d never seen before stretch his lips. “I never needed to hear it. I know, Harry. I know you love me. I can see it.”
“This is our one shot,” Harry looked at Draco. “If we don’t get the votes, her request for an appeal is denied and all of this stops there.”
“Draco!”
They had almost made it to an odd-looking lift that was definitely modeled after an elevator before Harry saw it.
It wasn’t until he was standing under the water, steam blowing out that he noticed streaks of colour washing down his body.
“That’s not his fault,” Harry whispered as he wiped his eyes. “Malfoy has done a lot of things that he’s not proud of, but he’s aware of them and is trying to make amends. You can’t pin her death on him, that’s not fair.”
“But,” Potter prompted when Draco said nothing further.
Draco glanced up, not feeling in the mood to remind Blaise that he didn’t
Harry held out both his hands, the action drawing everyone else’s attention. They wouldn’t be able to see what he could, but he imagined that they could see the sparks that emitted, see the whisper way they moved along the room as all lights dimmed and surrounded them in darkness.
Draco could tell that Potter didn’t like it, but it was the only plan they had. If it could be called a plan at all.
“Draco.”
my fault last time,” Seamus argued. “How was I supposed to know the guy was an undercover Auror?”
Let me know your thoughts, I hope you liked this week's chapter, and as always, I'll see you next time!
Their kiss had turned a little risqué for something the Prophet usually posts, but with their public status being so highly regarded, it wasn’t a surprise that the photos were printed anyways.
“It did in the beginning. I tore a lot of muscles trying to get them to go away.”
“Did it work?”
“Oh.” Malfoy rested his head against Harry’s shoulder as he wiggled his body as if uncomfortable.
“Attempts at what exactly?”
“Forever?”
“My runes are special,” he said instead. “Necromancy is more than the popular form its reputation receives. The runes I etch aren’t intended for the dead but instead the death inside yourself.”
“I didn’t get to,” Harry said. “And the ironic part of it was that he said
“I don’t know,” Potter whispered, eyes lowering to Draco’s chin. “Sometimes I think I don’t feel attraction at all. And then other times I think I fall for someone’s personality, their aura, their magic, who they are as a person.”
, something of importance.
“Mum—”
“Thank you for stopping by. My wife wanted to Floo for an update, but I’ve never trusted Floo.”
“Do you know what happened?”
He wanted that, wanted what Malfoy would give him. So he moved his fingers at an achingly slow pace.
“Leave it be?”
to use it.
“I’m so stupid,” Harry whispered. The signs had been there, of course they had been. His own pain had blinded him to what he wanted.
There was another grin pressed into Harry’s neck, and Harry couldn’t help but return Ron’s sentiment in his head.
“Merlin, yes,” Draco said, breath coming out in a petulant huff. “And don’t even say you told me so. I’m sick of your holier-than-thou personality.”
“Why didn’t you stay with Luna? Why bother me?”
“Is that a bad thing?” Draco asked, eyes on Harry’s hand. “We aren’t doing anything wrong.”
“You stopped me from doing something foolish,” George whispered. “Let me thank you.”
“I hoped otherwise,” Nymphadora gritted her teeth as she tried to grab hold of his hand that was still wrapped around her throat.
“Regulus?” Sirius rounded on Kreacher. “What does my brother have to do with any of this? Explain.”
you.”
“You’re entertainment has arrived!” Seamus yelled as dust from the door breaking apart kicked into the air around him and Neville hesitantly went after him.
“I hope you’re not expecting much, I’m tired as fuck.”
“Everyone has that,” he pointed out, not wanting to be told a simplified version. If he was to capture Sirius, then he wanted to
It's two AM and I'm surprised I've written this much of a note. I'm going to try and fall asleep, I really hope you liked this week's chapter. I'm partial to this one, had a lot of fun with it.
Harry was good at tracking, definitely better than the majority of the Aurors. Being a P.I. with zero law enforcement help, meant he had to hone his skills and get good at some kind of tracking.
“Fuck.”
“I think it would be good for you.”
Harry nodded before the question really sank in. “And what they would feel like elsewhere.”
. It’ll give me more information should I need it.”
Was it a skill of Potter’s that made Draco want to instinctively believe him? Was it personal magic? Or was it just charm?
“I don’t even know you, and that somehow doesn’t surprise me.”
“Azkaban is missing an inmate.”
“Despite your stupid ideals, I tolerate you,” Harry said as he stood up and turned to the two Dementors who came to collect him. “I didn’t hate this meeting.”
“No, that’s just a bonus.”
“I don’t know what I want.” It came out far more frustrated than he meant, wishing that Draco’s concern hadn’t spiked, aura now flashing with dark coral.
Sirius relaxed, and his shoulders slumped in what was clearly relief. “They are great. James, Remus and Peter.”
“Hi,” Malfoy breathed, voice as quiet as the silence around them. If it weren’t for a harsh grip to the collar of Harry’s robes, he’d have thought Malfoy was going soft on him.
“Whoever owned this vault wasn’t British,” Potter said as he stopped to look at a plaque of artwork that had faded to the point that it was hard to see anything.
“I don’t—” Potter cut off when Draco glared. “Normal, I think. I’m not sure how to really measure that.”
“It’s not—” Potter ground down and Draco arched again. “It’s not very polite.”
“Have kids, they said. It’ll be fun, they said,” Lucius mumbled under his breath, ignoring Draco’s dark look.
Draco shook his head, but he didn’t step away when Harry got closer.
Draco wanted to ignore Zabini, wanted to pretend that dozens of eyes weren’t on him but as his eyes locked onto Potter’s once more, it tumbled out.
When Hold moved closer to the fireplace Harry took a step forward before she raised her wand again. “I said don’t move!”
“I’m not comfortable with what he did,” Harry said, eyes on his hands. “That wasn’t what I expected.”
Draco was going to make sure of it.
“And not only that, but can you fathom what kind of position you put Lupin in. If he had harmed Snape while as a werewolf you would have caused him to be removed by the Ministry and potentially locked away. You took his condition and used it for your own selfish reasons. The guilt would have torn him apart, and I think we both know that.”
Harry shifted uneasily. He didn’t know what it was that Draco saw. It wasn’t as if he could see himself.
Draco held his breath, praying that the blackmail had been enough. Hoping that none of them would test it.
“I’m sure yours is better.”
“I can’t,” Harry said, eyes on Draco’s lips, wanting to kiss him again. So he did. “Last time you said that, I missed half of my work day.”
The woman.
It was only when there was a flash of triumph did Draco continue.
“Dumbledore believed in second chances, no matter how heavy the price.”
Harry wasn’t stupid. He knew he was a wizard, how could he not? But he didn’t feel like one. The Dursley’s didn’t raise him as one. The wizards had never contacted him. He was more Dementor than he was a wizard.
The mood globe mocked him the longer he stared at it. He wished it would do something. The disappointment wasn’t as strong as his desire to try and track Malfoy’s magic. Since Malfoy didn’t do magic often, the globe was his only shot.
Goyle didn’t say anything for a while, and the silence was a bit unnerving. “Thank you.”
“Did you know that you’re kind of scary?”
The confusion on Sirius’ face matched Draco’s emotions completely and they ended up staring at each other.
“No.”
“What are you going to do?” Hold asked as she moved the hand holding her wand in a wide gesture. His eyes narrowed in on the movement—that was his shot. “You going to—”
The buzzing grew louder and louder and Draco wasn’t the only one to smile.
“I’d like that.”
Potter hadn’t said much but he was ready to believe it so readily.
Pale pink cheeks mirrored Harry’s flushed ones.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, fingers tracing the invisible mark. When he looked up, there were a lot of emotions in his eyes, and Harry knew each and every one of them—welcomed them. “Run away with me.”
The blunt question wasn’t said with their usual rancor, no biting tone, no cruelty, no anger.
he added when Blaise smirked.
The praise made him want to prove himself that much more, he wanted to replace Malfoy’s fingers with his own.
“I imagine a lot of people,” Luna said, tone pointed in a way that wasn’t usual for her. “Voldemort lived with the Malfoy’s for a time, didn’t he?”
His heart skipped a beat as his mind blanked momentarily.
“Malfoy.”
“Are you saying his magic is still inside me?” Potter looked stricken and a few seconds away from being sick.
“How long was I out?” There was a slight rasp to his tone and Draco tried to find it revolting, but unfortunately, it was horribly endearing.
He squinted when her voice rang out and let out a gasp at the realisation that they were on a group firecall.
Baxter arched a brow, inching forward. “Rogers doesn’t care about the poor. She takes office in a few days. Since Robinson was fired, the Wizengamot is of the belief that there are no more corrupt members left in their numbers. You get that petition drafted, Rogers will see to it that it gets passed.”
“Gluttony befalls more people than greed.”
“I didn’t ask you.”
“You’re going to have to be a lot more specific,” Harry said, finger slowly trailing along Barty’s skin where the Dark Mark used to be.
“One more.”
“There’s no getting someone out once activated,” Harry said as he reached for one of Hold’s hands that were now struggling. “Unless, you switch who’s in it.”
“They’re a good artist. The strokes are hard to find, the portrait is so wizard-like.”
on the Veela council.”
“What the fuck? How massive is Gringotts?’
What? Draco’s mouth parted to ask if Potter was serious, but the thin line of his lips was proof enough. Potter meant business.
A whoosh preceded a stifling silence, one Harry regretted causing. With the office being an enclosed space, it amplified the smell of burning wood. He couldn’t tell if it was because of the fireplace or if that was what Ashwood always smelt like. It wasn’t the worst smell he’d come across, but it wasn’t exactly pleasant either.
“Would you happen to know where Parkinson and Zabini are?”
Harry blinked rapidly at the censure in his voice. It would seem today was filled with a lot of firsts.
“This person didn’t.”
“Mina the Vampire? The one who stares at people like she can see their souls?”
“The similarities are there.” He didn’t like the way Potter’s lips turned downward. “But the Dark Lord aimed to taint, he aimed to make us serve him. It held ill intent. My magic inside you is peaceful, it doesn’t want to harm you.”
a good idea, but his brain was only half active with Malfoy’s arse so close to his face. He’d probably sign over his will if Malfoy asked for it mid-fuck.  Harry removed his hands and slumped back on his pillow.
have been intimidating if it weren’t for the fact that it came from such a small animal, had Draco’s lips quirking upward.
All of them.
time to get to know you…”
“Well, you didn’t try very hard.”
“That’s my son you’re talking about.”
Painting-Malfoy didn’t seem to believe him, and that wasn’t a surprise, not with the journal entries showing conflicted thoughts already.
“Excuse you.” Draco’s cold tone had them all straightening. “Harry gave me that as a present.”
When his dick twitched, Harry tried to will it away, tried to think of
Harry bit his lip, indecision warring within. If he let out some of his Magic with so many people around it could end in disaster and lead to questions he wouldn’t answer. When a warm buzzing reverberated around his mind, he smiled slightly.
“Unreal. How is this my life?” Lucius shook his head. “Still, I don’t—”
At least half a dozen people appeared before him, faces aggressive and wands pointed threateningly.
The pace of the dildo inside of Harry doubled in speed and he moaned, knee jerking in surprise. He glared up into Malfoy’s bright eyes and too smug smirk. When an eyebrow arched, the message was clear.
“I’ve thought about this.”
Going off a hunch, Harry looked to the person next to him and asked, “Sir, what’s that?”
he liked his hair slicked in the first place. “He’s more disappointed.”
“Rain check?” Malfoy offered. “Maybe in the morning?”
Malfoy shot a stinging hex at Ron who yelped and rubbed his buttocks.
“This doesn’t mean I want to see your cock.”
“What?” Malfoy’s brows arched.
“And what he’s done isn’t?” Malfoy crossed his arms. “Don’t talk about things you don’t understand.”
“I want to feel it the other way. I want you to put your magic in me.”
“Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.”
He shoved Blaise’s feet off his desk before he plopped down with little grace and placed his head on a stack of papers. The pull of sleep was strong, but he knew if he didn’t get started on
“Malfoy—”
. “Then why lie? He could have just said he didn’t want to do Exploding Snap night. He was the one to ask if it could be done here.”
snot came out and was grateful he hadn’t been there to witness it.
Before Harry could argue, Draco placed a finger to his lips as his other hand went to Harry’s trousers, unbuttoning them. The sound of the zipper loud in the room compared to their heavy breathing.
Wrong.
“It’s nearly midnight.”
Harry closed his eyes as he tried to block it all out, but his mind repeated the day he confessed to Draco over and over. He couldn’t escape the pain of it all, couldn’t shake the sorrow in Draco’s eyes when he was rejected.
Harry clutched his chest when he turned around to be faced with Malfoy, whose arms were folded and eyes narrowed.
“Some could say the same about us,” Harry said before he pressed his lips against Draco’s. His back was starting to hurt and one of his feet began to slip, but he wasn’t going to stop, not when he
“Don’t do that,” Harry argued. “Let me lose on my own, but don’t give up, never give up.”
When he walked back into the Department of Records, he rang the bell way too many times, knowing it would lead to another Stinging Hex.
Long, gangly and dirty fingers tapped underneath Gagnuk’s chin as cold eyes regarded him steadily before a startlingly creepy smile appeared on his face, jagged teeth prominent.
As Mrs Weasley talked to Tonks, whose disguise looked like an elderly woman, Draco’s eyes were on Sirius as a loud bark drew his attention.
“If you ever do something like that around me again, I’ll take you to the Aurors myself.”
“But they’re going to.”
When Potter grinned widely, nuzzling the hands holding his face, Draco knew that love wasn’t going to be a disaster this time.
“You didn’t tell them?”
“They are going to call back you know.”
It had been a surprise to see his own name inked on the page, but he wished it had been in different circumstances. Despite what everyone assumed, he didn’t know the first thing about love. Oh he could feel it, give it even, but it never ended well.
“No,” Draco said, tone hard and unforgiving. “It’s not.”
When the Painting-Malfoy’s mouth parted, finger raised, Harry couldn’t help but snort.
you enjoy it.”
And there it was.
“I can repeat it if you need,” he hedged, shifting from one foot to the other nervously. His father had never been a fan of Goblins, but Draco had always chalked that up to bigotry.
“You want me to remain in Grimmauld for
Eventually, Draco would get to the end, whether it was the end of the alphabet or the end of his own self-sabotage, he wasn’t sure.
“Will you touch me too?”
The pause was borderline dramatic, and impatience caused his hand to gesture for more.
Painting-Malfoy regarded him intently, eyes searching for something before he huffed and gestured his hand forward as if giving approval.
It grew hazy again as the creature came closer. His mind became fuzzy, and he knew the creature was the cause.
“I know,” Draco said, hands coming up to move the tournament cup to the ground before pulling Potter into a firmer hug. He didn’t need to know the finer details, didn’t need a play by play. It was obvious what happened.
to have known what kind of danger he put me in. No apology could make up for that, and I told him so. I told him if he ever did something similar to me again, I’d use Dark Magic on him.”
“You brought them to
“Time-honoured, huh?” The sarcasm in Pansy’s voice was soothing in a way, and he missed her terribly. “Such a shame I’m in Morocco enjoying the sun, waves and pool boys.”
the spell came from, where the magic came from, I don’t think you’d know.”
about it, something he didn’t like. It bothered him that he couldn’t figure it out.
“Does the glitter always burn?” Harry couldn’t help himself. He was too curious. “Would it have burned me too?”
“No.”
“Hm?”
“Less subtle and more obvious.”
“He mentioned my name,” Harry said, amusement rising at how uncomfortable the portrait looked. “I’m not an expert in the emotion. Dumbledore would say I got rid of Voldemort with love, but I honestly have always thought I got lucky. I have a lot of love in me, but I don’t think it was something I ever wielded, not in the way people think.”
They broke away when a Magically enhanced voice declared it was dinnertime. Harry hadn’t realized food was served at dances. Tables appeared from the ground in another show of Magic that
“No.” That sounded archaic. Why were wizards so behind in some aspects?
Draco bit his lip as he looked at the plain ceiling. The ceiling of the Great Hall hadn’t worked well since the weather issues began and that was a shame.
“Hey, it’s okay.”
When he opened his eyes, Ron was gone—
When Malfoy didn’t answer, Harry tilted his head back the best he could. His view was upside down, but he could tell that Malfoy was still looking over the paperwork.
“You don’t have a mark. Therefore I’ll be calling him in.”
“Uh oh.”
“It is,” Harry lied. Okay, so
When Harry threw his head back and laughed, Draco stilled. The light that shone across Harry’s skin made him look ethereal.
The laugh that echoed around the room also shook the bed, and Draco thought
“Yeah? I think I’d have liked him too.”
Harry narrowed his eyes as he used every last bit of concentration he had and observed.
Conversation flowed easily and that alone had Draco flustered. If things were easy now, did that just mean it would get complicated that much quicker? It took him a moment to realize that he was already figuring in future outings with Potter. This was why heartache struck him, because he allowed himself the opportunities—allowed his heart to rule his mind.
Wheww that was a wild trip. I do want to emphasize that there is an epilogue after this that will be posted. So it's not quite the end just yet.
“What do you mean? I told you I loved you!”
“Month?” Weasley asked, tone suspicious but he ignored that, ignored him altogether.
“Is that why you are so determined?” Filius asked as he put away the chess pieces. “Because you want to prove Harry wrong?”
A scream echoed around the room, and he was distantly aware that it was his own. Pain unlike anything he had ever felt surged throughout his body. His magic was already warm, but it increased in temperature, and it felt like he was burning alive from the inside out.
“It’s how they eat. They need souls to keep going. Which is why the Ministry is stupid. Confining their food to only little bits from prisoners will only end bad. They’re hungry, Potter. Eventually the hunger is going to get too much for them, and they’ll revolt.
“I want to ease that if I can.” The cards were passed out to each student, but Harry couldn’t see what they said.
“How’s the cough?” Harry taunted, grinning when the guy’s hands clenched. It had been so
Filius opened his mouth to speak, but Potter beat him to it.
“I don’t know,” Harry mumbled, eyes on Malfoy’s leather trousers outlining thick thighs—fuck he wanted those around him. “It’s whatever you use to clean yourself and then your natural scent. The combination works.”
“Nah, I like yours more.”
The hissed words stilled him as he was half-way out of his seat. It shouldn’t have surprised him that someone so old would know Parseltongue, but it did.
“He needs your help with the Werewolf council.”
“I need your help.”
The weather? Draco was honestly embarrassed for Potter. If that was all he could come up with, then Potter had really lost his marbles.
Once again, Potter stilled only this time it was accompanied with a wrinkled forehead. “Pardon?”
There was a sadness on Draco’s face that Harry didn’t like. Was it something he said?
“I, too, think there’s too many people,” Lucius said, tone clipped as he eyed a few of them in disgust. “They just let anyone in here.”
your side of it.”
“Even if it’s a silent painting?”
“That makes absolutely no sense.”
There was a long pause as Scorpius refused to look up to his parents. “… No.”
Draco.
“What kind of plants?” Neville’s thumb rubbed his chin. “I mainly grow plants used in potions and sell them to Apothecaries. I have my own personal greenhouses but not a whole lot for a party.”
“Nothing, it just looks as it normally does.”
Draco glared at her over the top of the paperwork. “Finish signing up Gnat for a house special, will you?”
An uncomfortable look flittered across Sirius’ face as he raised his head and Draco wondered if it was for himself or for Severus.
about what they could do. It was a group of people who felt the need to be special, who thought they were doing something in the name of the greater good. But what did they accomplish?
“I thought the rumours of them relocating in London were just that, rumours.”
“Not even me?”
They weren’t angry, but he was. They weren’t upset, but he was. They didn’t have a thirst for justice, but he did.
The whisper carried and it brought a smile to his face. Past him never would have understood his current life. Who he had once been was in for a whirlwind as the discovery of self-love blended into loving others.
Identical doubting snorts could be heard from his family and it had Draco wondering why he bothered showing up at all.
When he turned to ask, he caught sight of Sirius’ parted lips and sparkling eyes.
“You,” Malfoy growled. “You almost blew it.”
“I want my heart back,” Malfoy whispered, eyes narrowed and a nasty sneer in place. “The one that you helped shatter.”
“If there are so many empty rooms, why didn’t he switch to one of them?”
Fuck, Malfoy was hot, way too fit for his own good and too charming. Harry had known that for a while, his mind had taken longer to admit but his body didn’t. If there had been any inkling that Malfoy saw him the same, he’d have taken him to bed instantly. Their tentative acquaintanceship would not have lasted through an unwanted advance, that much he knew.
“We’re going to give it a new target.” He braced himself for the impending fight. “Me.”
“Mmm,” Draco hummed. “I think my father liked the Dark Lord’s ideals more than the man himself if that makes sense.”
“You didn’t like me in the beginning and look how we turned out.”
“You see,” Lucius whispered, tone a touch too excited. “There’s something
“With all due respect,” Leandra interrupted and a few people in the crowd oohed. “If given the chance to mate with who we want regardless of delegation, it would still give the body what it wants.”
The hand on Draco’s chest pushed through magic, directly on his scars, and the sensitive area amplified the feeling. He made sure to raise his palm to Potter, making sure the energy would come full circle.
wanted to laugh.
“It’s nice to see you, especially outside of work. I think it’s really interesting to see you in such a setting. Normally, I have to wait by your car to even talk to you.”
“Oh, George.”
“Potter, what are you doing here? I thought Blaise said you would be at Exploding Snap night?”
“You look like you’re going to pass out, kid.”
alone?” Draco yelled. “We are the ones that were summoned to help
Harry usually closed his eyes when he used Dementor Magic, but he wanted to watch Draco’s reaction. Would he whimper like others? Would he cry? Beg?

to love you vocally too. I want to love you the way you love me.”
And he’d do anything—destroy anything, create anything—to make it happen.
“My point exactly!” Malfoy accused with an accusing finger pointed dramatically at him.
He didn’t like being wrong.
“Twelve,” Hermione repeated, eyes narrowed but moving quickly between them. “Is that why you left me alone?”
When Potter’s hands went back to picking up bones, he was able to relax.
Lupin put the camera down and frowned. “Yeah, but it’s the first time we’ve had to say goodbye to each other.”
“Are you the one who painted me? If so, you need to redecorate. The walls are full of half-finished portraits, and I got to tell you, that does nothing for my confidence in you.”
anything, just
“Not obvious enough,” argued Harry. “It didn’t seem that way to me.”
Before Draco could respond, a new voice spoke up.
Draco grinned at the cover of the
When Harry held out a hand, the park grew dark; light dimming into nothing, and the air grew cold, chilly and all that was visible was their breath.
Potter didn’t respond, not at first, at least not with words. Feather light touches to his hand had Draco looking down in time to see Potter slowly circling his wrist, thumb moving in a way that settled his magic.
“Draco, I didn’t say that to you.”
brought up Lupin.”
“I don’t know,” Potter said slowly. “You tell me.”
The treatment of House Elves would always make him the angriest and the saddest. What hurt the most was knowing that House Elves didn’t see it that way, the majority were
“Ah!” Draco jumped as the light illuminated the walls of the passage. There were mirrors along every inch of the path. He could see both himself and Potter in so many different angles. It was startling and disturbing.
“You’re not forsaken, what are you on about?”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Draco said as he held up a hand and his quill fell to the floor. “Shacklebolt as in
Harry bit his lip, unsure what to say. He honestly hadn’t expected to get a foot inside, let alone a full conversation.
“As much as you can be with your colleagues,” he answered honestly with a one shouldered shrug.
Kreacher’s eyes widened as he began muttering in Gyrarr too quietly for Harry to understand.
But it wasn’t enough, and no matter how many times he wished it was true, it wouldn’t do any good to pretend. Draco tuned him out as he began to inspect trinkets closely. What was the point of keeping a rock, Sneakoscope, a blank photo and a broken fang?
“You got to know me by my journal—a year worth of writing. I put so much of myself in there. Not just my plans for who I want to be, but my worries, my worst moments, my struggles. You know me more than I’ve ever let anyone.”
When Draco and Harry walked into the Great Hall holding hands and smiling happily, Emily stuck her tongue out maturely and smugly in the face of everyone who ever doubted her.
“Hey!” The whisper yell almost had him tripping over his feet. “You can hide here.”
“I don’t know how, but I’ll let you teach me.”
“Next time,” Harry moaned as the dildo brushed against his prostate. “Next time tie me up.”
“Sure. Let’s go with that.”
Draco dug through his robes, trying to find it.
When Harry, Charlotte and Ambarella stood up, Draco let out a shaky laugh.
“Friendly my arse. The last time you had a ‘chat’ you sent him to St. Mungo’s where he was unconscious for
Despite the signature being subtle, Harry was confident it could be tracked. He stood up, leaving the globe where it was before walking out of the room. There were traces of Malfoy’s magic in the flat, which was typical, but it was weak, very weak.
“How do you know that?” The suspicion was back, but Draco didn’t mind.
“I was raised in a bad house,” Harry paused at the brief concern that flickered in Painting-Malfoy’s eyes. That was kind of nice. “I don’t want to get into specifics, maybe I can to the real Malfoy one day. But just know that they never loved me,
“What’s your asking price?” Ron asked as he sat on top of his desk and looked through a few memos floating around the room.
The disappointed sigh Draco released had Harry holding back a smirk. “I can’t even fool you anymore.”
“Character building.”
At such a young age it was easy to get distracted by petty fights and silly drama fueled by jealousy. The reality of what stood before him was lost on eleven-year-old Draco. Back then, all he saw was competition, someone whose magical signature could rival his own.
“I get that.” Potter’s eyes didn’t hold sympathy but instead understanding, and strangely enough, Draco believed him.
. And Lorian wasn’t alive to feel the leftover hurt that had festered over the years.
He never did have a flair for that, much to his father’s disappointment.
“Draco.”
“I suppose he could’ve had the portrait made and something went wrong.”
Draco couldn’t quite pull off a smirk with how fond he felt, it was more of a smile. “I quit long before we met again. That’s why they won’t give me a council position. I said no to them and they didn’t like that.”
Harry croaked, eyes watering before closing when Draco
When Potter made a muffled noise, Draco gripped harder, wanting to hear it again. As their lips moved and his thought process went out the window, Draco ran his free hand along Potter’s back and wished clothes weren’t in the way.
“Tell me,” Draco said as he trailed the dagger up Lorian’s cheek, not enough pressure to cut but enough to leave fear in its wake.
“I figure the scarf can be something you use after we have sex. It can be the focus your Healer wanted. Someone stinks, place it over your nose and smell me.”
“Another time, perhaps,” said Malfoy as he turned around, a generous amount of lube in his hand.
“Oh, so you’ll listen to Ron but not me?”
“Another disaster date, then?” Harry asked, not really needing an answer. Draco hadn’t had a decent date in years.
“Hey!” Harry argued. “It was your idea to steal it, not mine.”
Blaise scoffed, hand coming up to cover his chest.
“Harry,
It was an invitation.
“In the sense that I know what they are saying, yes. But I don’t know if it’s because I can also hear what they are thinking too.”
“You two?” Draco gestured between them; nose wrinkled. “When? Why?”
“Piss off.”
The sound of the floo could be heard but they didn’t move.
“My boyfriend
“It didn’t have to be like this,” Ron argued as another sob left Nott. “This is
“You’re avoiding Malfoy.”
“Like what?” It was charming how curious Potter was about his work and Draco liked the attention, it was nice.
“A lot of people look drastically different from when they were younger, but you looked like I remembered. Sure, you’ve aged, and I can see the differences, but it’s still so familiar.”
“I’m sorry.”
The Manor looked as it did before, at least Harry thought so. His face had been so swollen that it was hard to see anything. As he followed Tazzy he couldn’t help but notice the decor; it was… well expensive—that was about it.
“Wizards condemn what they don’t understand,” Harry shrugged. “I doubt there’s a single accurate depiction of us in your books.”
“Then tell him that.” Her eyes were firm, and he wanted that to be the push he needed but it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough to convince him.
George rolled his eyes as he fought the urge to throttle his brother.
“No way,” A third voice boomed, and Harry turned curiously. “You got cursed by Glitter Dragon?”
Humans liked to surround themselves with others like them, shared experiences and all. Perhaps he was just being human…
certainly was a thought. Little sparks of ideas met with the forethought to become something more. He’d have to come back to that another day.
Draco looked down when they reached the Apparition point. He wasn’t sure what to say. He didn’t want to talk about his reasons behind his choice of career. Especially to Potter.
“None of that is me.”
“I always am.”
“I can,” Draco said, arms behind his head as he watched Harry stumble toward the bedroom door. “My eyesight is just fine.”
“Even when things got bad and we all joined the Order, he still approached things with an attitude that was hard to muster due to the times. Raids, deaths and a despair surrounded the atmosphere, and yet Sirius was the morale in many ways. People gravitated towards him, whether it was just to talk or to look for comfort.”
Harry scoffed. Talking to Malfoy was always a headache.
“But I do,” Lupin pressed, hands coming up to grip Sirius’ shoulders. “I knocked out one of your teeth, a whole fang.”
“They would be charmed by my bare arse.”
When Potter threw the last one, a loud, ear-shattering cry came from the stone, drowning out the sound of the jar breaking. A quick glance showed it was Ulnok, who was breathing but asleep.
“You always were dramatic,” Harry’s lips twitched. “It would cause quarrel with the other councils, including my own, but it’s a discussion worth having.”
Draco shook his head as he pushed his food away and stood up.
The part that hit me in the feels the most was Draco's 'Maybe I don't believe me' wheww, my heart
“Touched a nerve,” Harry coughed as he sat up on the floor, eyes watching every step Draco took toward him.
Brown sucked in a sharp breath as she and Declan turned toward each other.
“Shut up!” And Potter really did hit him. “I meant your foot; can I touch your foot?”
“I know,” Harry shushed him, a thumb placed over his bottom lip. “I say it because I don’t want you to forget that I love you.”
Malfoy stared into his eyes as he leaned down, mouth so close to his that Harry wanted to close the gap and—
Harry couldn’t see Lucius’ face behind the mask, but by the overwhelming dark green in his aura, Lucius was
“5 points to Gryffindor.” Potter gestured to where the water had not fully stilled, and little ripples of water remained moving.
“Before Mister Malfoy disappeared, he had been increasingly unhappy. Mentioned that he wouldn’t mind taking a vacation.”
Draco was no stranger to dichotomy. That was the first thing a magical painter had to be aware of. One cannot see the surface and assume there is nothing underneath. Just because Sirius was nice to his friends, didn’t mean he was
“Don’t tempt me, Potter.”
“It’ll be alright.”
“Your guess is as good as mine.”
“No,” Draco shook his head, unable to banter when the truth of the statement touched a bit too close to home. “If I was, I wouldn’t love you like this. Not with the same ferocity, not with the same passion. Not when it hurts me like this.”
that were coming out of the mouth.
“Hm? Pardon?” Sirius was polite, and that was odd for Draco. He had expected a wariness, expected distrust, not the opposite.”
“Draco, I’m a few years shy of forty. You don’t look a day over 18.”
Delicate. Some would consider it an insult and perhaps in this context it was, but he’d never been allowed to be delicate before. In another setting, perhaps he’d explore that.
The low buzzing that had resumed after Draco’s release picked up in tempo.
too long.
“Siphoned? I—”
“But,” Malfoy continued, ignoring Ron completely. “If everyone there is stolen from, there is no obvious target. No one will know that Astoria was our main mission.”
“What prison did you work at prior?” Harry asked as he examined the parchments. Disappointment filled him at the
“Pardon?”
“What a fucking arse,” Draco snarled, storming into the kitchen with a presence that Harry wished he hadn’t missed.
. Draco couldn’t let it go, not after all the work he put into the painting, not after all of the hours he had put into the research, not after everything he had to do to get as far as he had.
“You can kill the soul.”
“Revenge changes people,” Malfoy said, eyes cold and it was familiar in the way that it tore at his heart. “You can’t want revenge and still be moral, Potter. You’re my accomplice whether you like it or not.”
Potter. Potter.
“She taught me a lot,” Malfoy whispered as he watched Rosmerta fill several orders back to back easily. “I saw how much she puts into this place, the care, the love and seeing people give it back made me want that too.”
for Flamel’s stone; people
He wanted Harry.
Harry tugged Draco closer, wanting to feel more of him. “I don’t like people talking about you negatively.”
She relaxed, and the hug tightened. He wasn’t sure what exactly Andromeda thought, but Lupin loved Tonks, very much.
Oh. It was Harry’s turn to flush.
“That night, when I brought you here after the club, you told me to let you in. I realized that I had already let you into my heart. My magic recognized that, it included you in my wards ever since, not really sure how to undo it either.”
Before Harry could truly process everything, Malfoy lunged forward and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and held on tightly.
“The buzzing is the only audible language they have. But they speak in other ways, all of it in their minds, in my mind.”
“I love that you are ignoring that
Harry rolled his eyes before going back under the duvet. “The answer is no. You can’t have it.”
. Such a simple and kind gesture. No one else had ever done that for him. Usually, he was the one being chivalrous.
Rosmerta looked between them and for the first time in a while, she smiled.
The proportions were right and the colours accurate. He had let the canvas cure for a full week and even started to grisaille, but still, something was off.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry as they watched their past charge dance at his wedding. “It would seem that your advice worked.”
A twitch of Potter’s lips was also distracting.
Just when he thought he had a hold on it, his stamina was shot to hell when Malfoy’s hands reached out to cup his balls. Harry had to lift Malfoy’s head off of him and take several deep breaths.
to be there.” Luna finished, staring up at the sky with a slight smile.
Draco was captivated. He had never known someone like that, never seen anyone with such a personality. He frowned at his notebook and he wished for the millionth time that he could have known his cousin, even briefly.
“Mhm.” Harry tilted his head to the side, wondering where Draco was going with this.
“What I’m trying to get at, is that I don’t have the answers to a lot of the things asked in the journal. I think your counterpart has this misconception that being good will come with revelations, and that’s just not what happens. I’m just as lost as him in so many ways.”
Was it special abilities? He didn’t know. Intuition, perhaps? Maybe.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry admitted sheepishly. “I was trying to figure out why the stairs were moving but not sentient and I pushed a little too hard.”
“I notice you didn’t specify
“Would you have admitted it otherwise?”
“What do you want?”
“That’s not helpful.”
“Then no.”
“I think the Dark Lord is zero for two.”
“You’re preaching to the Wizengamot, Potter. Nothing ever is fair, is it? Glad to know that being the Boy-Who-Lived can’t even fix love. Evens the playing ground for the rest of us.”
“I’m here for a lot of things,” Harry whispered, eyes moving from Barty to Fudge before settling on Dumbledore. “I want information from Barty about his Master. You see, I’ve got a bone to pick with Voldemort and I’d just
Potter’s lips pursed and one eye closed in what Draco assumed was his deep thinking face.
“We both know no one will sign up for it.”
“Alright.” Hermione clapped her hands together. “I’ll help you figure out who is the Silent Ghost.” She waited until they shared massive grins before continuing. “
“Sorry I’m late,” Draco called when he couldn’t see anyone. “I came over as soon as I could.”
A low whistle escaped Draco and he sat up straighter.
In the silence of the room, his thoughts raced. What now? He knew they both enjoyed themselves, that much was obvious. There were no regrets on his end, but he did wonder what Malfoy was thinking. As far as sex went, it had been something on another level. Sex and intimacy don’t always go hand in hand, and they hadn’t really had much intimacy before that. But during, Harry couldn’t help but feel like there had been a touch of intimacy, and intimacy he didn’t know if they should explore.
“Don’t worry about it.”
“If you don’t give me the details, I’ll send Pansy after you.”
Disgust was all Harry could feel. Some people shouldn’t have kids.
Tears, both in the present and in Lupin’s memories. Lupin had cried when he found out about Harry’s parents, cried when he found out about Sirius, but that’s all he did, cry.
“Tomorrow, Lucius wants an update and I’m going to have to tell him that I have nothing. Not a single thing to offer.”
“What kind of research?”
“Why do I feel like you’re no longer talking about fingers?” Draco asked, reluctantly amused.
Before Draco could fully enter the dark flat, he was pulled into a strong embrace and snogged so thoroughly he got dizzy.
It wasn’t until a finger touched his cheek that he looked back. There was still a sense of curiosity from the creature but that was all Harry got. He didn’t feel like his life was in danger, not anymore. The screaming had stopped when the creature had. The cold feeling evaporated and his mind was just as whole as it had always been.
“What do you want from me? To apologize on Draco’s behalf. We both know he doesn’t regret a damn thing. If you’re waiting on an apology from him, do hold your breath, it’ll make my day.”
Longbottom looked like he wanted to be anywhere else, but Draco wasn’t feeling particularly merciful.
“Why? What are you—”
“Dumbledore has sent the Order after us for far less.”
echoed around the room, startling him so bad that he stabbed a hole in the letter. The sound of Dudley screaming meant the rest of the house heard it too. It was a testament to how afraid of him they were that Uncle Vernon didn’t storm up the stairs, instead he heard the front door slam shut and the squeal of tires against the driveway.
“What would you have done if I had told you what I had planned?” Malfoy asked, there was a dull quality to his drawl and Harry hated it. Hated that he wanted the smirks, the little smiles, the sparkling eyes.
The man was a prick, that much was clear.
was the answer to being a great partner.
The shaking of a head had Harry rolling his eyes. “I know you don’t want me here, but tough luck. Not only am I being paid for it, but I’m curious and I
“Why?”
“Then we have to make it count.” Malfoy’s brow quirked briefly before he stood up, hand extended and boxers vanishing along with his heel with a snap. Harry’s eyes focussed on Malfoy’s cock, half hard, prominent veins and it made his mind wander—perhaps he had some fantasies after all.
Harry thought about reiterating the fact that it wasn’t Malfoy’s fault, that he wasn’t the one who killed her sister. But there was no point. Hold clearly didn’t care, just wanted revenge and it didn’t matter who she got as long as they had been a Death Eater.
“I don’t!” Potter’s face was red with frustration and his wand had been pulled out. “I don’t know the first thing about wielding it. I
The smirk he got in return was
“It’s
When he looked up, painting-Malfoy was watching him with an arched brow.
insulting?”
Voldemort.
When Malfoy’s lips
One final kiss to his stomach and then Draco was crawling up the bed and pulling Harry into his arms.
Harry sat up in a hurry to see Draco’s face in the open window.
“You don’t look like a clown.”
Pansy arched her brow as she hung upside down on the couch, shaking her head at both Draco and the blood rushing to her head.
Ron continued to read from the folder, occasionally making non-committal noises as he leafed through the papers.
“It’s my fault,” Ron whispered, horror in his voice. “I shouldn’t have come.”
Greyson folded his arms across his chest as his lips tilted downward.
“I can’t see!”
Part of him wasn’t sure what that was, wasn’t sure what it was about Draco that drew him in and made him want to stay. But he was going to find out, he was going to give them both a love that they deserved and when Draco squeezed his fingers lightly, attention still on Hermione, Harry knew that Draco would do the same.
“Hello?”
The longer Draco glared at Longbottom he wondered if he’d be able to manifest his magic into a stinging hex with just his eyes.
“I wanted to give you the world,” Harry whispered. “I wanted to court you with more beautiful things. I wanted to—”
What I do want to know is your thoughts on painting-Malfoy shksks. Gosh he's a lot of fun to write and I think even silent, he could give his counterpart a run for his money. Trying to picture them both in the same room makes me laugh. As for the friendship between Ron and Harry. They will always be friends, but there are some things that can't be overlooked. This is something Harry feels that strongly about and it's something that'll take time for them to talk through and understand. There's no bashing, there's nothing like that going on. It's just friends who aren't seeing eye to eye and need a break
Blaise arched a brow as he squinted at Draco’s hickey, which Draco ignored.
“Without enough information, I’m left blind to an entire part of what made Sirius who he was. Without that, the painting won’t be accurate, things can go wrong. He could end up not remembering parts of his life, he might start to fade, or the magic could unwind. The things he can remember might be inaccurate or wildly exaggerated. So much can go wrong. You might think you are helping him by not telling me everything, but in reality, you aren’t. It can actually hinder the process.”
Draco walked with Minerva for several minutes before a figure pacing near a bench caught his attention. It wasn’t until he got closer that he realised it was Sirius. A
When Harry turned around, Lucius was standing in his cell, one hand gripping the bars tightly and the other one holding out a folded parchment.
It had been a long time since Harry had to think about the theory of spells, that had never been his strongest point. He thought back to his lessons with Hermione on summoning charms.
“Among other things.”
When he opened his eyes Harry almost closed them again at the sight of Malfoy’s robes vanishing, leaving him naked. The urge to touch was too strong to ignore.
The narrowed eyes turned into a glare. “Your name was suggested by three members.”
“You better not tell him that though. That’s embarrassing.” He waved a finger at the camera in what he hoped was a threatening manner.
“The one Dumbledore hid in our first year, I touched that one.”
“Harry.” He tried to pass it off as a polite greeting, but it failed with how emotional it sounded.
“Sirius could convince anyone.”
For the most part, the case read like a typical illegal Portkey ring, but Harry had pulled the finance records of all involved and had circled a few transactions that he deemed questionable. At first glance, Draco could see why it caught Harry’s attention, they were massive amounts of money being sent to businesses with no record of any services given in return.
Harry’s eyes snapped to his, they were wide but awed. As if he hadn’t thought that Draco could love him. Foolish Gryffindor.
“Okay,” Ron reassured. “While I was there, I asked her some questions since she had talked to us once before. I mentioned the painting—”
“I can, somewhere else, where I can take notes. The process can be lengthy.”
“Mid-Alchemy?” What the fuck was that?
brave and that’s not something that is a by-product of being an Auror.”
Draco leaned forward, and he wished he had brought his notebook with him.
His shoulders slumped, and he gestured for Potter to keep going.
“Just go.” He didn’t want to admit that it was his third take, his third failed painting. “Tell Ron I’m sorry.”
I’m not supposed to let my emotions get to me on a case. But you don’t understand. Malfoy—he’s—I just—” His hands clenched, and the folder crinkled.
“You mean a date?” Malfoy said slowly, so slowly that Neville glared. “Unless you are implying something, Longbottom, and if that’s the case, please continue. I’m all ears.”
It wasn’t until the air shifted slightly that Harry was able to make out
“It’s all there in those pretty eyes of yours.”
Draco looked down at the ground as his brows furrowed and a frown formed. Potter was convincing, that much was clear, but he still felt as if something was missing, a key explanation. Why was Divination so complicated? The lack of factual evidence still got to him, it still left him uncomfortable.
“Again.”
“How long will I be able to feel you?” Another flush to Potter’s cheeks had him wondering what it would feel like. Would the warmth of the flush match the intensity of his own magic?
“I’m vain enough to know that I am beautiful on the outside but honest enough to know that I’m not beautiful on the inside. I am far from nice. Where Harry cares about others, I would rather see them fail. Where he smiles and waves, I sneer and can’t see why he even bothers. I judge everyone and I know I shouldn’t.”
The depths to his magic were vast. Usually, it only took a few moments for Draco to decipher people, but it would take hours, days and months to understand half of the Dark Lord. The little he could glean, wasn’t good. The Dark Lord did many things to achieve his power. Some of it borrowed, some of it warped, some of it unthinkable.
You are going to let
“Why not? Love is cute.”
capture him.
“Oi!” Malfoy straightened his robes, sneer in place and eyes narrowed.
“Are you telling me the Dark Lord had Horcruxes?” Despite him being dead, panic welled up, and Draco felt his fight or flight reflexes kicking in. The latter predominantly stronger.
“Dean—”
Ron narrowed his eyes but didn’t argue.
“What?” His mind was cycling through last night, and with each new recollection, he felt warmer. Mmm, that was good. He felt off, but that wasn’t uncommon after getting up.
“Your faith is put wisely,” Mina said before placing a hand on top of his. “And so is mine. I have faith in you. Do not doubt that.”
Contempt changed to hatred and with it took any chance at making his fantasies a reality.
Lupin bit his lip before his hands fell limply by his side. “But still. You have to know that I would
“It’s a spell,” Harry said, eyes wide as the Magic became more and more visible now that he dug deep enough. “One I broke.”
“Is it?” Malfoy lifted one shoulder. “So is sexual harassment, but you didn’t care about that though, did you? Want to see who wins in court?”
talk about the plan at all.”
“These books tell the
“You really want to court me?” Harry asked, not entirely sure what it was about him that attracted Draco to him.
“Oh.” The disappointment to his tone almost made Harry feel bad. Almost.
that because I was your predecessor’s prime suspect.”
“Another customer?”
“A better question would be, ‘what
“How do you know?”
“I want to know why it’s there at all,” Harry said, jaw clenching. “I want to know how he did it.
Harry’s forehead wrinkled as he turned to face Draco in his naked glory. “Your father died in the war.”
“Know.”
The nod he got in return had him leaning closer as his brows arched. “I am very much bisexual. I would have thought you knew; the fucking Daily Prophet wouldn’t stop talking about it for a month.”
to fight a Troll, no thanks. It wasn’t the notoriety or the whispers or the attention he wanted either. Being infamous was a hell of a lot better than famous. The latter drew too many eyes.
“If you’re going to get snippy then I’ll—”
“The guards at White Shark patrol with Cockatrice. Which you know in confined spaces, Cockatrice become territorial and shoot poisoned spikes out of their tail.”
“I’m sorry,” Sirius began, tone hesitant and distant. “But do I know you?”
“I can see that.” It was hard not to be comforted by Potter’s presence. Every time they touched, he could feel their magic connecting, could feel the way Potter’s Light Magic inside him soothed his own restless Dark Magic.
“I tried to combine Futurology and Aeromancy and somehow my magic recognized yours in the rain storm I was in when in the staff room. It’s not like normal magic. It knows what it's doing.”
“Okay, maybe it’s my favourite part too,” Draco said, a grin spreading his lips.
“No, you don’t. It’s for professional reasons.”
“Moody.”
“Draco.”
A loud sigh had him rolling his eyes. It was the fifth sigh in the past 15 minutes, and he refused to acknowledge it.
His stomach moved from butterflies to a volcano of warmth that spread to his cheeks.
Shouldn’t be too hard, right?
He dodged a smack to the arm and wondered if this was what friends did. He didn’t think they were friends. Friends didn’t want to suck the soul out of each other.
Sirius shook his head as he took a step back.
“I think your art is beautiful.”
“When has Malfoy ever got off his lazy arse to hand-deliver anything? He was obviously there for you.”
Harry snapped his head up, feeling his face heat up. She was standing down by her office, arms folded. “He’s not—” He paused when she lifted an uncaring eyebrow and pointed to her office door.
Another amused noise, and Harry found that he quite liked it.
“Wizards?”
that bad. If it was all of my senses that had been hexed, I might not be that upset. Only it wasn’t. The fucker hexed my sense of smell. Ron, I can smell
Sirius rolled his eyes. “You don’t like humans, I get it. But that’s not why he killed them. He killed them for sport, because he could, because he viewed himself as better than them.”
my cousin, and I
Draco wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t sure how to respond to the emotion in Severus’ voice.
This was an anonymous prompt, it said, "Draco flipping his shit when Harry gets hurt somewhere and vowing to get back at the person who hurt him."
Malfoy shook his head and he knew that there would be no explanation. Vague as ever.
Mina arched her brows and looked at him funny. “Of course. Oceans that once were thriving are now rivers that barely move. Mountains have been reduced to hills. Things decay, stuff will grow, new life begins, and death is as present as always.”
Potter was going to regret that.
“Harry.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “I mean I didn’t say that out loud. I spoke to the Dementors through our connection.”
Fudge wasn’t in any shape to run, too busy groaning and panting as he clutched an injured ankle from the ground.
“Yeah, I
“I wanted to kiss you,” Malfoy rubbed their noses together and he could feel fluttering eyelashes against his own. They were close, so close but it still wasn’t enough. “I wanted to snog you right there in the club.”
“I’m never wrong.”
“I’m Luna.”
“Why not?” he asked petulantly.
“I’m too young to have a charge. My father thinks I’m out annoying Goblins.” It was whispered nervously as Draco looked around the cupboard as if someone was listening.
Centuries of Magic and nowhere to go but to remain inside. The more he looked around the more tendrils of Magic he could see. It was a lot, reminded him of Hogwarts, sort of. The way the Magic had once resembled a web, all connected and linked together. Only now it was just strings that branched out into different directions, all with similar intents—to explore.
“Everything does.”
to be insulted. Potter was an odd one.
Draco snorted before laughing fully. “Yes. Last time I saw him he was in his animagus form peeing on my father’s favourite chair in the study.”
“No, but you almost did.”
Harry could feel the heat of Malfoy’s cheeks and he hated that it was endearing.
There were ideas and half-baked theories that were too dangerous to test. “I
“Can you expand on that? Give me more?”
“What?” Draco narrowed his eyes as he looked between them. “What aren’t you telling me?”
“I don’t get it,” Draco whispered to himself, eyes tracking the movement of Moody’s magic from across the Great Hall. There was something hazy about it. Like his magic was being covered, blanketed even.
the one wanting compensation?”
When the paper was shoved in his face, his hands clenched on instinct seeing Theo’s face. Merlin, he hated him.
He wasn’t too far deep into the trial to not realize that someone else was in the room, but he couldn’t stop. There was no stopping once it was started.
When Ginny sighed a third time, it was accompanied with fingers in his hair, which was an improvement.
“Your magic craves mine,” Harry said before kissing Draco, forcing more of his magic into him. “Always has, from the moment we met.”
“No.”
“You made a friend, darling. That’s new.”
His scent grew stronger and he knew it was emotions causing it but he couldn’t stop, not with how
“I feel like I’m missing vital information here,” Sirius said hotly, hands on his hips.
“You don’t want me to touch it?”
“I have the itinerary, do shut up.”
“I don’t think you mean it.”
“I don’t know,” Sirius said slowly, eyes on the kitchen counter he was propped up against. “It’s to be determined.”
“Draco,” whispered Harry, heart both healing and breaking at the sight of him. Draco was still so tiny, but Harry could tell that he had aged some. What caught his attention was the Potter ring sitting on top of Draco’s head like a crown—too big to fit on his fingers.
“Touch me,” Malfoy demanded, eyes falling closed and hand forcing Harry’s head down, fingers threading through his hair before gripping harshly. “Show me how potent I am.”
“It’s not worth it, Harry,” Draco whispered, fingers grazing the back of his hand.
The anger had been replaced by a brief flash of hurt, but Draco couldn’t take it back, couldn’t fix what wasn’t a lie.
“I talked to his Mind Healer, she had nothing either.”
Painting-Malfoy scrunched his nose before sneering.
Harry didn’t think smiles and kisses belonged together, but he was proven wrong when their lips met, and he felt a small smile against his lips.
right.”
“All riddles have an answer, you know,” Draco said with a light pat to Harry’s cheek. “We’ve been a riddle since the moment we met. Only there was never an answer.”
“A guard. Said he was a Ministry exchange transfer. Which is odd, there hasn’t been one of those in years and you’d think it would be departments not Azkaban. I don’t—”
the mark was. It didn’t take long for black ink to slowly seep through until the ugly design was visible.
Ron slumped against the fireplace as his hands fell limply to his side.
“Sir.”
“Sirius!”
The scoff that followed an offended gasp caused Draco to chuckle.
Draco wanted to point out that his runes
“No.” The whisper was filled with so much emotion that Draco couldn’t help but believe it. “It was stupid and I just—I didn’t think, I just—”
Draco narrowed his eyes. What was Potter’s problem? There was no anger on his face, but he couldn’t figure him out.
“I take offence to that.”
When several memos flew into the lift bringing forward a gust of air, the all too recognisable smell was a sure sign that Karma didn’t just not like him, no, it detested him.
“Greyson.” Harry clenched his fists. “Malfoy’s ex. I don’t know why his team would go along with it, but they are. Like I said earlier, if they lose, then Lancashire is put above the Tornadoes.”
“That I do,” he said softly. “I petitioned the Ministry to allow this class to exist. I help Muggleborns acclimate into Wizard society but I’m not a part of Hogwarts. It’s just me.”
“For what?” Sparks asked as she picked up the paper.
“How do you want me?”
As he walked into Azkaban—two Dementors flanking him—he thought his emotions were fairly under control, until he looked up. Dozens of Dementors were floating near the ceiling. Others would assume it was by choice, but they couldn’t see what he could.
It was hard to verbalize a description; words didn’t seem enough. He wasn’t sure how to adequately explain the differences in Malfoy’s magic compared to his own. Malfoy’s magic was subtle, barely felt but impactful. His own magic was bold, very present and very hard to ignore. There was power in both, but the subtle touches of Malfoy’s magic were an advantage; easy to overlook, easy to miss, easy to let your guard down.
“I don’t believe you.”
“You were right.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry said as he shut the folder and put it in a filing cabinet. “I’ll look at it in the morning.”
It was interesting how their needs aligned most of the time. What Draco wanted, Harry was willing to provide and vice versa.
Harry tilted his head away from Malfoy’s wandering lips. He wasn’t going to respond, nope, not happening.
Panic gripped Harry until he forced himself to relax. There wasn’t much precedence to go off of, but he imagined that it would be a typical response when eating a soul for the first time.
“It’s rude to me how bad they smell.” Harry was the one who had to smell them all day long, it was fucking torture. They could live knowing they smelled bad.
When Draco was done, he took a step back and placed the brush on the table. The oils wouldn’t dry, but the little solvent he added into the paint would minimise the cure wait during oxidation. The longer he examined the painting, the more he wished traditional methods didn’t take so long, the impatient nature in him wanted to start on the next step right away, but he couldn’t.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco scoffed. “I deal in nothing but upstanding and legitimate transactions.”
Harry needed
“’Tis Master Regulus’,” Kreacher croaked from the entry way. “Erou ene.”
“Potter.”
Draco looked at Harry’s chest, eyes not meeting his.
Her shoulders shook harder and Harry knew she was crying.
“I should have killed him from the start.”
Merlin, he missed him.
“That’s the crux of it all, isn’t it?” Ron said as he leaned back in his chair and folded his hands behind his head. “Malfoy is a great player. It’s not a surprise that the ENB is looking to put him on the National team.”
“Oh yes,” she laughed. “Sirius had cunning when it came to that. He could convince his fellow students to do just about anything and then in the end they’d think it was their idea all along.”
“Don’t touch me,” Harry snarled as he tore his hands free.
“Do you ever act your age?” Draco asked, nose wrinkled before it scrunched as Harry pressed a kiss to it.
“You were right about one thing. I
“I’m not sure anyone is going to see this. Maybe that’s for the best. I just know I look like a cross between Doxy droppings and Weasley on a good day. I hope you all are having a better day than I am. I’m going to go as soon as I shut this off.”
Declan leaned forward after sharing a look with his mother. “But that’s not allowed.”
“I’ve wanted this for a long time.”
mine.”
know you. You—"
, sir.”
His eyes closed and his fingers fidgeted with the frayed edges of his sleeves.
“I can guess,” Potter gasped when Draco’s hands slid down his body and settled on his arse. “We’ll be late for Gringotts.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist and held it up to his nose. He couldn’t smell anything other than the soap Harry stole from him. His fangs nicked the skin and the first hint of blood had him groaning. The groan turned into a loud moan when Harry pressed inside him.
“You’ll never get it back?”
The plant didn’t disintegrate like the coin had. It was there in the midst of the light and then
“You think joining the very people who can’t stand me was appealing? The very people who hated what my family stood for? You think at any point I would have been safe under Dumbledore’s rule? It’s so easy for the righteous to judge what they’ve never been through. Fighting when you’ve been on the right side your whole life is easy. But fighting when all you’ve known is wrong, is hard and it wasn’t something I could do. Not when I had a hell of a lot more to lose by leaving.”
Dizzying. Being with Malfoy was always an experience but this? Harry’s eyes were on the way Malfoy moved, just as beautiful now as when dancing. The arch of his back, the parted lips, the glitter still on his body that shone so brightly.
