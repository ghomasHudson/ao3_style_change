Albus went on and told them about what the children had planned for him and for Hogwarts, about Orion, about the Dark Lord, about Narcissa. When he finished, the room was fully silent. The shock was an understatement from the faces of the adults in the room. He tried his best to never once mention about Draco's or Marius' involvement on the matter.
At the Gryffindor table, a certain green eyed werewolf was staring at the group skeptically, especially to one platinum-haired human who seemed oblivious to the constant staring of said werewolf.
Theo nodded. “There was only one family that leads the vampires and that was the Malfoy Family. They have headed our race since they are Slytherin's descendants. They inherited the blood and power of the First Vampire and the title of Elder has always been passed through their generations.”
“Apparently, the vampire Lucius brought wanted to become the Elder next in line. Without any of them knowing, he began to gather followers among our race. Now, these things happened way before we were born, but all I heard from my parents is that this vampire planned the slaughter all of the Malfoy Family, leaving no one behind. Women, children, the elderly—no one was left alive. Thus he became the Dark Lord.”
As soon as Luna was about to run past the right corridor, Ginny caught a glimpse of her and began to chase them. She casted a spell to prevent others from feeling her presence, but as soon as she followed Luna through the Hallways she realized where they were headed.
“Shh,” Theo placed his index finger at his mouth and signaled for Marius to walk toward the couches. There they saw the two tangled up in each other’s arms, sleeping in peace. Neville’s head was snuggled to Blaise’s neck while the latter’s chin was resting on Neville’s head, his hands clutching Neville’s waist protectively.
but he knew if he started a fight, the blond between them would wake up. That was not something he wished to do right now, especially since he knew just how exhausted Draco was.
Lily began to hug herself at what she heard. She couldn't believe that someone would be capable of performing that kind of magic, that kind of barbaric deed at this age. James instantly felt his mate's emotions as he stood up and hugged her. He tried his hardest to soothe her until she calmed down for a while.
“I was about to procure something there, and lo behold what I found. A village drenched in fire and blood and ash. I searched far and wide to seek the witch capable of such a thing, behold my surprise when I felt the same signature of magic now that I met you”
“How?” Hermione then butted in, her hands were now fisted on her sides. She was feeling a bit envious that Marius knew about the language but she could question him further about it later.
“I’m here,” Orion whispered continuously as he rocked them both, drawing circles on his back. The boy’s cries stopped as he seemed to have slept, the exhaustion seeping into him.
Theo’s form was hunched, one arm clutching his stomach and the other was held up to cover his mouth. Then a giggle escaped his mouth as a full on laugh erupted from him, Ginny’s eyes snapped to his her eyes wide and full of rage. But when their eyes met, Ginny’s eyes widened with shock.
he then shook his head for thinking the impossible, no male has ever been born with magic despite being born from a witch. Only females are born with magic, he then shook his head from his musings as he slowly went out of the door. He was closing it when a voice startled him and he looked back only to see Young Marius right behind him.
“You’ll see”, and Marius thought of the Potions classroom along with its cauldrons and the ingredients cabinet, the door appeared in front of him and he grinned. Neville’s eyes widened, no one but part pf the pack knew of this room—
“If you had entered here alone, I would’ve easily yielded you to your Mother’s Grimoire. Alas, the circumstances are different.” She did not continue and Draco stared at her with furrowed eyebrows.
"Yeah, there is. You're a human. Vampires treat your kind as food and Neville, well, he is a werewolf."
“Dumbledore was able to evacuate everyone before you went ballistic. He and Orion was the one who stopped you and brought you here when you were knocked out. Professor Snape pumped you with the antidote all night till you naturally morphed back.”
Hermione steeled herself once more. She had to win this duel no matter what. She couldn’t let Chang win.
“No pairing it will be unfair to Nev, you will brew this potion by yourselves”, he smirked when Blaise grunted.
“Noticed that too, she stared at the photo of Black as if she knew him, not well enough, but enough for her to look that way”, Harry nodded.
“And yet I was able to enter the Blood Ward of Narcissa,” Severus quipped back at him, his eyes sharp and showing no emotion.
Draco nodded like a broken doll telling a story that haunted him every single day of his life. “Power.” Then he suddenly looked up at Harry, his eyes full of fear and unshed tears as his lips wobbled. “I’m scared, Harry. I-I don’t want to—“
“Wait, what?” Marius asked, utterly confused. Beside him, Ginny was covering her mouth to prevent from laughing out loud. Marius turned to her for an explanation, but she just smiled widely at him and shrugged her shoulders. Great, he was absolutely lost.
The vampires were all groaned, thinking that it was something overly important. Blaise grinned though as he placed his arms around Neville’s shoulders, making the werewolf blush hard.
“Have you no honour left in you?”, Harry spat out and Barty’s mischievous eyes glinted at his direction, he grinned widely. Then his focus went elsewhere towards the people within the dome.
It was a good thing that even if Nymphadora was inside of her at the moment, she couldn't view her memories. Thus assuring that Marius would still remain to be safe. The best that she could do right now was to steer away from Marius to prevent Nymphadora's curiosity from knowing who he was. With that plan in mind, she headed off to Ravenclaw Tower, hoping to find more about Cedric and her connection to Nymphadora.
"Marius?" Harry could not help but voice out, wanting to know what just happened. He was confused but his instinct still screamed at him that the one standing in front of him belonged to him. His mate, his everything. He studied the boy he had known for a few months now and he could not help but see that he was as beautiful as the day he met him. But with the snow that was falling over them now, Harry could not help but think he looked like an ethereal creature that even he could not reach.
Neville flinched involuntarily and he looked up to see Blaise's eyes flashed a feeling of hurt. Neville's wolf howled in pain deep inside of him. Without realizing it, he slumped on the ground and was repeatedly apologizing.
Ginny struggled and looked up at the familiar face of her friend but right now at that moment she looked like a total stranger.
“Tsk!”, she irked and wiped her blood with the back of her hand, then uttered another spell that easily cured her.
The room fell silent. Fenrir Greyback was said to have been one of the chosen in line to be Alpha of their pack, but due to the unforgivable crimes that he has committed, he had been banished, alongside his comrades.
“Fine, Dad,” and he began walking away from a stunned Theo who afterwards regained his thoughts and followed him. They both left the two lovers in their own devices, seeing as they were inside their own bubble.
It took the entirety of a whole minute for Orion to finally overcome the shock he felt because of the words the human in front of him uttered before. “Draco.” He inhaled a lungful of air and exhaled slowly or else he would have choked. "
“Well okay. If you would just lie down and I can have a look what’s going on down there. If your friend here is going to faint, then I suggest he leaves.” She says and Hermione lies down. I frown and move around the bed to hold Hermione’s hand.
He looks quizzically at me. “Why would you think that?” And immediately understands. “You think she traumatised me?”

“I want to know about you. I think that's only fair.” He looks alight with curiosity. Shit. Where’s he going with this? He sits back and puts his finger on his mouth once more. That’s so distracting…. I swallow.
“Course she’s ready. So many wrackspurts wouldn't be around if she wasn’t. Infact there are an incredibly high number today. If I was to guess, I would say someone else is pregnant too.” Luna says in her sing song voice with her colourful glasses on. Me and Draco share a quick nervous glance but keep our heads down. Then Ginny rolls her eyes and pushes Luna towards the table.
“I’ll still own it and we’ll still live above it, but I’ll get someone else in to manage it. How’s Draco?”
I wince as I look in the mirror. I am going to have to process all this. Honestly, fancy falling for a man who’s beyond beautiful, richer than Croesus, more powerful than any wizard I’ve ever met, and has a Red Room of Pain waiting for me. I shudder. I’m bewildered and confused. My hair is its usual wayward self. Just-fucked hair doesn't suit me. I try to bring order to the chaos with my fingers but fail miserably and give up, casting a spell - I need a bobble really.
“It could have been worse than that Draco, there was a broom up there.” I told him while taking his hand and walking back into the house fast. I started putting the wards up as soon as we were both through the front door. “And there was a name badge. It said Nia.” I relaxed a bit, now I knew we were safe in here.
Not long after, she yawned and decided she was tired. So she lent forward to put her head on Draco’s belly and was almost instantly asleep. I looked at Draco and his eyes looked red rimmed as if he was about to cry.
After everyone has said their goodbyes and left, me and Draco sit on the pouch steps. He rests his head on my shoulder and kisses me.
“So, what do you like to do, Draco?” I look at him, unable to express myself.  Come on, Malfoy, try to be cool.
The moment is interrupted by a phone ringing. For a minute I think it’s mine but before I have even gone to reach for it Harry has his to his ear.
Katie does a few spells and takes some notes. Then she smiles at me and says another spell. Suddenly there is this 3D scan sort of thing floating above Draco’s stomach. My hands go slack in Draco’s and I stare in disbelief. Draco opens his eyes because I've let go, and gasps.
Sunday comes and word got out that the baby had arrived. Everyone left us alone like we asked but sent cards and gift baskets to say congratulations. Today we are going to Andy’s first and Narcissa is meeting us there. Then we are going to the burrow. We are even going to see Hagrid, but not till next week.
“Goodbye crookshanks, be good for Harry.” She kisses him on the head and he purrs, then she walks over and holds him out to me. I look at him and he seems to be daring me to touch him, the big ginger hairball of evil he is. I reach out and he pounces on me. He digs his claws into my arm and makes his way to my shoulder where he sits and makes no move to get down. He then licks the side of my face with his razor blade feeling tongue. Hermione awwws at it and scratches behind his ear to which he purrs, then she ruffles my hair.
“Yes, yes. I've not forgotten, we’ll be there. Bye!” I shouted back while smiling like a loon. Ron had said they had something to announce and that they wanted everyone there for it. I’ve been wondering what big news could prompt a get together. They were either engaged, pregnant, or moving. Or possibly all three but I doubt it. In fact I doubt its pregnancy either as it's being held in a pub. I bet they got engaged, which makes me a little jealous but me and Draco had spoken about it a few months ago and just weren’t ready for that yet. But maybe with the house it will be approaching. Anyway I'll be happy for Ron and Hermione whatever their news is, they seem extra snuggly lately whatever it is. If it makes them happy then I’m happy.

“I missed it…” he says quietly. Hermione smiles sadly at him and holds her hand out. He walks over and she shows him baby Rose.
“Okay.” I put him down and held his chin as if I was about to kiss him, then ran the brush right down the middle of his face. He screamed and got me again with his brush.
“Wow.” I say and go to sit next to Draco. “Do you reckon this one is going to be just as hard as this one?” I ask Draco, first pointing at his belly and then at Rose. He chuckles.
“This is Blaise Zabini, our photographer.” I tell Potter then, turning to Blaise and grinning at him. He smiles back affectionately and then his whole face shuts down when he looks at Potter.
“Of course, love.” I help him lean forward and climb behind him. He instantly leans back and sighs. I kiss his head and stroke his hair back. ‘Nearly there.” I whisper.
“Greg, I’m actually with a customer right now. You should actually meet him.” I drag him over to Mr Potter and they size each other up. The atmosphere is suddenly arctic.
People stare at us as we drive through the streets. For a moment, I think it’s at him….and then a very paranoid part thinks everyone is looking at me because they know what I’ve been doing during the last twelve hours, but finally I realise it’s the car. Harry seems oblivious, lost in thought.
“You  will  eat.” He says simply. Dominating Harry, it all becomes clear. “Would you like another glass of wine?”
My cheeks flush and I want to run but I can’t seem to move. We are both silent for a moment and then he sighs and closes his eyes in defeat.
“Yeah, we had a quick look around to see what we got stuck with haha.” She chuckled with me now but still looked a bit nervous.
“I picked out a nice dress for you to wear tonight. I hope you like it, it’s in the first wardrobe.” Draco tells Nia as he’s closing the door.
“Draco, where are you? Tell me now.” Merlin, he’s turning back into his control freak self. I laugh at him.
We sit there for another few minutes and then George comes around the corner clearly out of breath from looking for us. He sees that I’ve seen him and waits around the corner for us.
My legs are suddenly unsteady as I turn to get a glass. I’m so glad I wore my best jeans today. I turn back around to start pouring the beer and glance at him. Merlin, he’s so handsome. As it is slowly pouring into the glass I think. Why the hell is he here? In Scotland! Then a part of my brain says, he’s here to see you! And I almost drop the glass. No way! I dismiss this idea immediately. Why would a beautiful, powerful, smart man want to see me? It is ridiculous and I get rid of the thought.
“I kind of can’t wait to see the look on Ron’s face when I tell him we slept together,” Harry laughed.
Draco sighed, “Unfortunately, no.” He kept playing with Harry’s hair, causing him to feel relaxed and sleepy again.
“Everything looks so lovely,” Mrs. Weasley said to Narcissa, gaining a large grin. “You must have worked yourself ragged to have done all this.”
After breakfast, Narcissa had her personal elf see to warding the room. She also added a charm so that if someone else entered the space an alarm would sound. “Draco, might I have a word?” she asked when she had approved of the spell work her elf had used.
They all changed into pajamas before laying around in Pansy’s room to eat their snacks, giggling and joking with each other. It had been such a great evening, no one wanted it to end, but since they had to catch the train in the morning, it had to. Greg walked Hermione to her room while Harry and Draco went to Harry’s. Ron hung back, saying he wanted to tell Pansy goodnight properly.
“If you’re looking for coffee, I have a cup keeping warm for you on the table,” Malfoy said against the shell of his ear. He turned Harry around slowly and leaned in close. “Although, I do expect a proper thank you for being so thoughtful.”
They stayed like that for several long heartbeats, Draco clinging to Harry with his teeth still embedded in his neck. As their breathing slowed, Draco eased them to the ground. He was gentle as he moved Harry so they could lay on their sides. He licked the bite he had made on Harry to help it heal faster as he waited for his knot to go down.
“You only got yourself a date because Weasley is completely insane,” Blaise teased her. “How do you expect to get someone else a date? Especially someone that everyone’s afraid of?”
“If your slick starts, I shouldn’t have to stretch you,” he said as he pressed a bit harder until his finger slipped in. He grinned as liquid seeped out of Harry, dripping into his hand. “Perfect,” he murmured, withdrawing his finger and replacing it with his cock. He pushed slowly into Harry, groaning as his tight heat engulfed him. He moved slowly at first, giving Harry time to adjust to his size. When Harry started meeting his thrusts, he became a little rougher. Adjusting his angle and pressing deeper into him.
Potter was quiet, but seemed to be considering what he had said. “I just feel really lost at the moment,” his voice soft when he finally spoke. “I thought that I had finally figured out what I wanted in life. I never got to have a proper family.” He snuggled his face against Draco’s chest. “You’re very warm,” he muttered sleepily. “I just want to have a nice family and be around people that actually like me for me. Not because I’m Harry Potter.”
He continued down the path, finding another fork. He could hear fighting in one direction and it sounded close. Sticking to the treeline, he walked closer, crouching to hide in the bushes as he watched Ron and Theo Nott fight. ‘Theo should have chosen magic,’ Draco thought as he watched Ron easily overpower him. It was never a good decision to physically fight someone with five older brothers.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes, “So why continue this after the ball? Spending time together before makes sense, but why after?”
“You have been, but I don’t mind,” Malfoy shrugged. “How about you come lie down with me and I’ll read to you?”
Draco looked up at the moon. The darkened sky made it look so much brighter. He cracked his knuckles and jogged in place, trying to keep his muscles warm and ready. The excitement in the air was palpable, nervous laughter sounding out occasionally. Everyone was ready, jumping or jogging in place as he was. He couldn’t wait for them to sound the horn.
Draco grabbed his face and kissed him again. “It’s fine, my darling,” he said as he pulled away. “We don’t have to rush. Let’s go look Ron in the eye until he turns red. I bet it won’t take long.”
“I just wanted to make sure everyone made it out,” she said, blushing a bit. As Theo stumbled out of the exit, her eyes lit up before her face grew angry.
“I know,” Harry said softly. “I promise, I’ll think about it.” And he did think about it. After Ron extinguished his lumos, he lay there in the dark, thinking about not being close to Draco after being so close the last couple of days. Ron was right, things were moving very fast, but it didn’t feel wrong. Harry closed his curtains before rolling over and snuggling up to his pillow. He could still smell Draco’s cologne on it as he drifted off to sleep.
“Yes, barely,” Draco rolled his eyes and plucked two drinks from a passing waiter, offering one to the Weasel. “I hate these things, but if I don’t show my handsome face they’ll think I’ve reverted to my dastardly ways.”
He put a hand up trying to feel the magic and was surprised when his hand went through. “Very tricky, Harry,” he whispered as he stepped through the glamour. He found himself on another path and could hear fighting that he hadn’t heard before. Harry’s scent was much stronger, but there was someone else. He ran as fast as he could, hoping he got there in time. As he rounded a corner, he entered a clearing and found Harry trying to fight off Ron’s sister.
“He needs to be seen in a more positive light,” Hermione shrugged. “It would do him some good to have his name in the papers with Harry’s and he’s always been pretty concerned about his family name, so it might work.”
Harry ran as fast as he could through the empty corridors. If he could get to the Room of Requirement, he’d be safe. He had to hide until he could figure out how to get away from everyone altogether.
“I didn’t say anything,” Harry said, still grinning as he pulled a shirt over his head. Draco rolled his eyes and found his slippers, taking Harry’s hand as they left the room and headed to the drawing room to find his mother.
“Then why are you fighting to keep me close, Potter,” he leaned forward until their lips were almost touching and stopped. Harry’s breath caught in his throat and he held completely still, waiting to see what would happen. “I think you like having me this close.”
“You’re no help at all, do you know that?” Draco growled. Grabbing Harry around the waist, he flopped him onto his back in the middle of the bed and rolled on top of him. “I already have what I wanted for Christmas,” he said as he leaned in to kiss Harry. He was only able to get a brief peck on the lips before Harry pushed him up.
Draco couldn’t help but to laugh as well, “Please let me be there when you tell him.” They laughed for a bit longer before finally quieting and dozing off to sleep.
He stood, leaving Ron to it, and headed in the other direction. This close, he could only smell the omega they were fighting over. He wasn’t certain if it was Pansy or Blaise and he didn’t really care.
“You’ll owe me and them a favor,” Ron said, crossing his arms as he leaned back in the wingback chair.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes, “It wasn’t overly difficult. Do you mind if I empty the wardrobe?”
“Actually, we helped,” Harry spoke up and Hermione elbowed Ron in the ribs. “We worked really hard, but it was fun. I’ve never gotten to decorate a tree before.”
Draco just grinned, “I told you that you needed a lesson. Now get dressed. We need to have breakfast and I want to owl my mother before we go to the library.”
“I don’t know what you’re playing at,” Neville said, his usually quiet nature gone. “But I don’t like it. You’re following Harry around, clinging to him like some sort of parasite. He’s a good person and not just because of everything he did for the war. Harry’s kind and he’s been through so much shit. He’s better than you deserve.”
“Molly, I can’t,” Harry said, feeling flustered. “I’m already seeing someone,” he blurted out before she could argue.
Malfoy propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at Harry, “You’ll know when you’re ready. It will just feel right. My guess is that you’re tired and feeling unsettled so you’re just looking for something to make you feel better.”
He knew exactly what Blaise was up to. He wanted to see Draco strip and wasn’t able to include himself in the dare so he suggested the one person that Draco wouldn’t back down from. But Draco absolutely would not perform a striptease in front of Blaise and everyone else. “Come on, Potter,” he rolled his eyes as he stood slowly. “I’d prefer to do this in private.”
“I’ll ask my mother,” Draco said as he grabbed an armful of dusty clothing. “I’m sure she’ll know where to send it.”
Harry smoothed his own suit jacket. He thought he looked damn good, as well. He had let the salesman talk him into a forest green suit with black trim and a black vest. His crisp white shirt provided a nice contrast between the suit and his tan skin. It was tailored to fit him perfectly, every line flattering him and making him look fit. Ron’s suit was essentially the opposite, being black with green trim that flattered his complexion.
It did startle Harry, however, when McGonagall appeared at their table in the library on Thursday. “I was concerned that the two of you were up to something, and with your histories I felt that it was probably going to cause me a migraine. However, after speaking to your professors, I see that Mr. Malfoy seems to be having a positive influence on your studies, Mr. Potter. Are you still set on the path of becoming an auror?”
“Yea, he had Pansy with him and Neville came out with Blaise,” she said. “I think they’ve gone already.”
“I think we’re just enjoying the present,” Draco answered as Harry’s cheeks turned even pinker than they had been from the cold. “We’re mostly looking forward to the Yule Ball. I hear they have the Weird Sisters playing again.”
“They’ve been in there for hours,” Hermione practically shouted even though she was trying to whisper. “What if they’ve gotten into a fight and knocked each other out?” She dragged Ron up the hall mentally preparing herself for the sight of Harry and Malfoy beaten, battered, and knocked out. She was not prepared for what she saw when they opened the door. Harry was cuddled up against Malfoy’s chest and they were both sleeping peacefully.
“I accidentally channeled magic through my sword like a wand,” Potter beamed up at him. “I didn’t think that something like that could happen, but it did. I think if we practice, we could learn to do it on purpose.”
“I think I would like that,” she grinned and glanced at Draco knowingly. “But on one condition. You must call me Narcissa or Cissa, as well.”
“Are you insane?” Harry almost yelled as several people passing by had stopped to watch. “He’s my boyfriend and we’re just trying to do some Christmas shopping. If you had bothered to do your job, you’d know that I can’t be influenced by the Imperious Curse. And quite frankly…”
They rose early on Saturday, eating quickly and bundling up before heading to the quidditch mound. It was a clear day and though it was cold the conditions were right for a seeker’s game. They didn’t keep track of the score and only quit when their hands were so cold it became hard to hold their brooms. After lunch, Seamus suggested a snowball fight. Most of the eighth years and some seventh years headed outside, but Harry still felt cold from before and opted to stay in front of the fireplace falling asleep while Draco read.
“Yea,” Harry muttered. “I just want to be done with this. Hermione was right. I shouldn’t have done it. When the horn went off, everyone came straight for me. I knew there’d be several, but I didn’t expect that many.” He shook his head slowly. “I just want to leave, but I can’t get to any of the exits alone.”
Harry was quiet for several minutes as he considered what Malfoy had said. “First you’re bossy. Now you’re wise,” Harry mumbled, gaining a chuckle from Malfoy. “What happened to the git that wanted to argue all the time?”
“Yeah, she’s done so much for us lately and she’s still in the barn. We wanted to do something nice.” Draco smiles kindly and continues eating. Everyone seems to agree with this and carry’s on.
“Aww you guys are cute. Anyway, what can I get you?” We told her our orders and she walked off to go make them.
It’s dark outside by now so the first thing I see are the fairy lights hanging everywhere. The back garden is huge, it has a patio of about 15 metres out though and then grass. The patio is completely clean now, the outdoor furniture has been put up. Which includes an outdoor table and chairs, just outside the doors. A double swing chair closer to the grass and the shed in the corner. And 4 sunbeds with an umbrella in the middle of then, which are lined against the grass to the left. I look over to the two nearest trees and see a hammock attached too. Then immediately to my right I see a built in floor level fireplace with built in seats. I look at Nia with amazement and she points over to the grass. We go over and exactly in the middle close to the patio is a little apple tree with bricks surrounding it. And engraved in them is ‘Norte coeur’.
“Subject to the soft limits, yes. I’ll try.” My voice is so small. Harry closes his eyes and pulls me into an embrace.
“Stop! Harry- Harry stop!” He’s screaming while laughing at the same time because he just can’t help it.
“You really are beautiful when you play.” I tell him. He smiles shyly and just continues hitting the right keys. The melody is soft and beautiful and very Draco. I lean my head on his shoulder and close my eyes, just listening to the music.
He runs his hand through his unruly hair and I imagine doing it myself. That was a thought totally out of my control and my face flames. I bite my lip and look down at the table.
“So? Have you told him yet?” Hermione asks me from where she’s sitting on the bench. She had a day off and decided to come with me and Teddy to the park. Currently I was pushing Teddy on the baby swing. Teddy was 2 and a half already and looking more and more like his parents everyday. It still hurt a bit to look at him but everyday it got a bit better.
“Fine, leave me again. If you need me I’ll be at OUR house.” I retort back and stomp off to the bathroom. I thought maybe he would come after me or wait for me but when I came out of the bathroom 10 minutes later, ready for the day, he’s gone. I put it to the back of my mind and apparate to the new house. I’m only there for a couple of hours though as I can't really concentrate. It hasn’t distracted me like I thought it would. Maybe Teddy can distract me. I go over to the floo but don’t know whether it's usable. Oh well better try it, might have to add it to the things that need fixing.  I throw some powder in and say andromeda’s address and stick my head in with my eyes closed, hoping my head doesn’t go up in flames or get chopped off.
“I’m not surprised.” She leads me over to the sofa and we both sit. “How was coffee? I know you hate coffee.”
“Olivia, please fetch Mr Malfoy a glass of water.” Blonde number two says. He sounds stern and I’m guessing Olivia is new to the job. She scurries to the door on the other side of the foyer.
“Thanks Hermione.” I crashed down onto their red comfy sofa, which always reminded me of the Gryffindor common room. “I think me and Draco are going to break up soon.” I blurted out, not being about to hold it in any longer.
“But baby, I thought you liked that about me?” He does his flirty evil grin and rubs his foot with mine under the table. Then he carries on, “Anyway, did you see how nervous she got?”
The only way I ever have any chance to see what he’s thinking. Actually, who am I kidding? I never know what he’s thinking, but I like looking into his eyes. He has beautiful eyes - captivating, intelligent, deep, and dark, dark with dominant secrets. I recall his burning smoky gaze and try to ignore the twitch of my cock.
“Well we don’t want her there so she kind of is. Do you know what this reminds me of?” He asks me and then carries on without expecting an answer. “That time you had to look after that bloody cat of Hermione’s! Now that was a pest.” He’s laughing now and I think back to that 2 weeks I had crookshanks. I could have killed that bloody cat.
“I sent Weasley out to get you another pair and some other things. They are in that bag on the chair.”
“Oww shops?! Can I come?!” Nia says, coming down the stairs. Me and Hermione shush her and she tiptoes the rest of the way into the room.
“Oh Harry, dear I’m so sorry.” She been crying in here and is about to start again. “I just… it…”. She starts again, “With Teddy’s birthday coming, I’ve just been remembering how excited Dora was about being a mum. And then you tell me you're going to be parents and everything just came back. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to offend. I’m sorry if I hurt yours or Draco feelings. I should go apologise.-“ I cut her off with a hug.
“I’m babysitting my godson if you can’t see.”  I tell him and look down at Teddy. He’s almost asleep now, occasionally sucking on the bottle.
“You. Are. So. Sweet.” He says each word in between kisses and I try to grind against him to get some relief.
I never even got to speak to her. Is she okay? My thoughts start to crash though, too much alcohol and excitement for one day. I feel fuzzy, it’s too loud, and warm, and bright in here. I feel dizzy again. Oh shit…. I can see the floor getting closer to my face but can’t do anything to stop it. Then I feel strong arms around me and feel safe. The last thing I hear, other than the music, is his voice.
I don’t know how long I was sat there thinking and breathing, but next thing there is a hand on my shoulder. I jump and look up. It’s Andromeda with a worried look on her face.
I’m starving. I head back out to the bedroom. Sleeping beauty is still sleeping, so I leave him and head for the kitchen.
“What if they get into trouble while you are hiding here?” Luna says. By the sound of it, she has sat down against the door too. “I think they would be much safer with you there.”
I look up then and we are by Pansy and Harry's brother Theo. Pansy is totally making a move with Theo and is dancing her arse off. She doesn’t show off like this unless she really likes someone. There might be three of us for breakfast in the morning. Pansy!
“Why don’t we just stay at home.” He says and lifts an eyebrow. “I’ve got to stay in bed until the baby is born and I do not want to be staying in that minging bed at grimmauld.” He crosses his arms. Now I think about it, I think why not. I shrug and nod.
“Yes please. I worked on it last night over in Millie's room. I’ll go fetch it. And yes, I’d love some tea.” Pansy races out of the kitchen.
I nod as nonchalantly as I can manage under his intense, amused scrutiny. His face splits into a huge grin, and he shakes his head.
“Aww, remember when you were only 12 weeks pregnant?” I look at Leo and snort, then here a sniff coming from Draco. I look over and he has tears down his face. “Hey, what’s the matter?”
I remember that I’ve got to go pick up a box that I forgot and the last of the mail from grimmauld place. I decide not to leave Luna here though.
“I have varied interests, Mr Malfoy. Very varied.” He clarifies and has a touch of a smile playing on his lips. I heat up at his steady gaze. His eyes seem alight with wicked thoughts and I blush again.
I look at all the kids and then at Draco and they are all smiling and I’m filled with joy. Draco looks at me and smiles. Then he gets up after Ophelia has gone chasing after Elsa and he sits on my knee. This isn’t a strange sight for the kids. Draco has always liked to be close. And I love him for it. He grabs my face and kisses me slowly. When he pulls back he claps to get the kids attention.
“He has helped me cook and clean and babysat Teddy. He is great with him. He’s helped me with the funerals and he has been a shoulder to cry on when nobody else has been here!” She says angrily now. Andy hardly ever gets angry and never at me. “He has been very nice and a big help. He has changed since your school days, so you both just need to grow up.” She finishes and huffs.
I nod enthusiastically against his back. It looks otherworldly, unreal, and I would love to take a picture. I bet Blaise would love the view. The memory of Blaise's attempt at kissing me haunts me. I’m starting to feel mean for not calling him back, but he can wait until tomorrow.
“Harry look,” he shouts while walking back towards the room, I don’t hear him though. “I’m really sorry tha…..” he stops short when he sees me and his eyes go wide. “Shit! Harry!” He falls to my side and lifts my head with his hands on either side of my tear stained face. “Harry? Talk to me, are you okay?”
“I’ll call him.” I mutter evasively. If I tell Pansy about Blaise, she’ll have him for breakfast. I collect the letters from the dining table and open them.”
“Merlin, too much information!” Ron blurted and made a sick face. I quickly threw a pillow at him for it. He burst out laughing then.
I walk out of Ethan’s grasp, while Harry smiles icily at him, and I take my place at his side. Pansy grins at me. She knows exactly what she’s doing, the vixen!
“Now here’s your pictures and I can get a recording of the heartbeat put into a teddy for you?” We both nod and she goes to get a teddy. Draco gets up and we both get our coats on.
Pansy concludes her speech with a flourish, and spontaneously everyone stands, applauding and cheering, her first standing ovation. I beam at her and cheer, and she grins back at me.
“I think you have that cliché the wrong way around.” I grumble. I am the moth and he is the flame, and I’m going to get burned. I just know it.
Forty-five minutes later, we pause our packing for the house speciality, my lasagne. Pansy opens a bottle of wine, and we sit among the boxes eating, quaffing cheap red wine, and watching crap TV. This is normality. It’s so grounding and welcome after the last forty-eight hours of….madness. I eat my first unhurried, no-nagging, peaceful meal in that time. What is it about him and food? Pansy floats the dishes away and I finish packing up the living room. We are left with the sofa, the TV, and the dining table. What more could we need? Just the kitchen and our bedrooms left to pack up, and we have the rest of the week.
“Draco, what’s wrong love.” I say just as quietly and calmly. I’m really starting to worry now, Draco hardly ever cries and now it never stops.
“Merlin! Thank you so much, Draco. I owe you one, I know. How was it? What was he like?” Great, here comes the Pansy Parkinson inquisition. I drop down onto the sofa, limbs aching from all the flying, and try to think of how to answer that.
All in all it was a brilliant day. Molly was ecstatic to have Draco over finally. Everyone welcomed him in. The food was excellent as always. Quidditch was way better with Draco as a seeker. Ron loved his presents. Everyone had a laugh and the past wasn’t mentioned. And Draco Malfoy finally met my family.
Soft lips brush across my temple, leaving sweet tender kisses in their wake, and part of me wants to turn and respond, but mostly I want to stay asleep. I moan and burrow into my pillow.
“Do you know what you are doing?” I ask him. He turns to me again and smiles. It's a carefree, acting-his-age smile and it makes butterflies appear in my stomach.
“Mr Potter,” Sev murmurs, his expression indecipherable except perhaps for the slight widening of his big black eyes. They slide over to my face with a when-were-you-going-to-give-me-this-news look. I bite my lip.
“Hello Harry, this is a beautiful home.” Luna says in her dreamy soft voice. “Lots of wildlife outside, including magical.” She looks at Nia and smiles.
“Draco?! What’s wrong? Are you okay? Is the baby okay?” I ask him in quick succession. He just nods though and keeps crying. I get down on my knees in front of him and put my hand on his shoulder. “Dray?”
“I’ve got to head to the shops for nappies and things, do you guys want anything?” Ron asks them, still standing.
“I think you’ve seen too much.” He chuckles slyly. He sits astride me again, pulls my t-shirt up, and I think he’s going to take it off me, but he rolls it up to my neck and then pulls it up over my head so he can see my mouth and my nose, but it covers my eyes. And because it’s folded over, I cannot see a thing through it.
“Yeah, it’s really turning into a home now and not a house.” I say and finally get the draw in. “Finally!” I get up and move it into place.
“We are all ready to eat thank you.” The house elf bows low and with a click of her fingers the food is in front of us.
“Fuck.” He says through breaths. I open my eyes and look at him. He looks beautiful like this and a certain word comes to mind but i can’t say that yet. It would freak him out and possibly me too. I relax back into the after sex haze. I slip my arm under his head and bring it on my shoulder. I kiss the top of his head and pull a blanket over us after using a scourgify spell on us.
“You're quite welcome, Mr Potter. I hope everything goes okay.” She says and seems like she means it. I thank her again and close down the floo. I head back up to the bedroom with a glass of water in case Draco couldn’t handle the juice. But when i get there, he's fast asleep. I put the glass down and decide I have time to make a quick stop off at Andromeda, although I won't be taking Teddy To the park today. I scribble Draco a quick note and leave it by the water. He probably won't be up by the time I get back but just in case. I gently kiss his forehead and pull the covers over him more. I’m standing by the bed staring at him for a bit longer praying to Merlin that he’s okay. I don’t think I’ve seen him that scared in a long time.
“Congratulations, Mr Malfoy.” he says as he shakes my hand, squeezing gently. I feel the charge of his flesh on mine. “Do you have a problem with your laptop?”
We take our places. Mr Potter is at the head of the table, while I sit at his right hand, and Harry is seated beside me. Mr Potter reaches for the opened bottle of red wine and offers some to Pansy. Luna takes her seat beside Harry and, grabbing his hand, squeezes it tightly. Harry smiles warmly at her.
“Shall we get a dog?” I ask Draco after seeing the kids with her otter. “Kids love pets.” He just looks up at me and raises his eyebrow.
“Yes, I thought that was you. Not to mention I could hear all the whispers.” He chuckled. “Can I help you?”
“I’ll give you two a minute to talk shall I.” And leaves us alone. We are still holding each other’s hand and staring at Draco’s stomach. I look up then and am about to say something when Draco almost shouts.
When we head back up to the towels Hermione and Ron are waiting with cupcakes. One has a candle in it and they start singing happy birthday. Teddy immediately joins in at the top of his lungs and even Draco joins in. He then kisses me and I blow the candle out.
“That won’t happen Draco. We can’t think like that, we have to be positive.” I tell him while trying to convince myself as well.
“Wednesday.” he confirms, and he leans forward and kisses me softly. Something changes while he’s kissing me; his lips grow more urgent against mine, his hand moves up from my chin and he’s holding the side of my head, his other hand on the other side. His breathing accelerates. He deepens the kiss, leaning into me. I put my hands on his arms. I want to run them through his hair, but I resist, knowing that he won’t like it. He leans his forehead against mine, his eyes closed, his voice strained.
The rest goes quite quickly, but not too quickly, and we are both on our backs sweating and trying to catch our breath.
Phew, Pansy Parkinson sidetracked. I slice a bagel and pop it into the toaster. I flush, remembering my vivid dream. What on Earth was that about?
“The Pinot Grigio here is a decent wine. It will go well with the meal, whatever we get.” he says patiently.
“And whatever you do, don’t shag the twat.” Ron shouted just before green flames enveloped him. I laughed despite myself at that. Having them two over had definitely calmed me down and made time go faster, so i guess I was ready. I took one last look in the mirror and happy with how I looked, sat down on the chair to wait for Draco. It was 5 exactly now and he shouldn't be too long.
“I’ll pick you up at eight.” He steps out of the door and starts walking down the corridor. Theo is right behind him but turns and blows Pansy a kiss. I feel the unwanted pang of jealousy at that.
Teddy looks shocked for about half a second and then runs into the room and chases the firework horses and streamers around the room laughing. Everyone greets him and wishes him a happy birthday. Andy flicks on the wireless and the party starts.
I fall through the floo into Andromeda’s sitting room. I’m instantly assaulted by screaming cries. I lookup and see a messy, tired looking andromeda trying to shush a screaming Teddy.
“Sounds like a plan to me. Lets go.” He heaves himself up faster than I knew he could move and goes to pull me up.
The marquee is immense and crowded - students, parents, professors, and friends, all chattering happily. Severus hands me a glass of champagne. It’s not chilled, so Severus cast a spell on them so that they are now cold and the taste is sweet. My thoughts turn to Harry….
“He’s coming over early Saturday to help load up.” She hugs the hairbrush - boy, has she got it bad - and I feel a familiar saint stab of envy. Pansy has found herself a normal man, and she looks so happy.
“Yes please!” He giggles and carries on playing with his bubble horses. I'll let him have a bit more fun before it comes down to washing his hair.
“Mr Potter, if you could sit here please?” Pansy takes over as she’s not about to let Blaise make all the decisions. “We will do a few standing up in a minute too.”
It is just before eight when the Audi turns into the little village. Why Harry insists on driving everywhere, is beyond me. The floo is much quicker, and apparating is even better. We go past a few little cottages and then Harry turns to me.
“Wow, so the prince of Slytherin and only child to a pureblood family knows how to clean. I’m impressed.” I smirk at him. He shoves me playfully.
Suddenly the engine starts up and it is really loud. I’m glad for the helmet as it quietens it slightly.
We arrive at the house by apparation and it surprises me when Draco doesn’t throw up. We go into the house to find that Nia is finishing things up in the kitchen.
No activity that involves the direct contact of electrical current (whether alternating or direct), fire, or flames to the body.
“We’re doing well thank you. Teddy has started to use his metamorphmagus trick to change his face into animals. Isn’t that right Teddy?”
I put the banner down and go in search of the giggling. I follow the sound to the back garden and I take a quiet second to watch. Draco is holding Leo’s hands while he attempts to walk. And every time he falls on his bum, Draco lifts him up to the sky and shouts ‘whoshhh’. It makes Leo giggle every time.
“I know. So am i.” Whether I’m saying I’m physically tired or emotionally tired, well I don’t know that either.
I glance up at him and he is his usual polite, slightly distant self. How confusing can he get? We come to a stop in a deserted alleyway and he turns to me. For a moment I think he might kiss me again. He looks at me with those intense green eyes and the air around us changes. But instead he takes my hand in his and I feel the familiar pull of apparation.
Because I don't want to talk about Harry anymore, I ask her about Theo. Pansy’s whole demeanour changes at the mere mention of his name. She lights up from within, beaming at me.
“I’m doing okay. It was a lot to take in but it all made sense so I couldn’t not take it in.”  She looks sad again now, but we have to discuss it.
“No, I don’t want.” He crosses his arms and glares at me. I get down on my knees in front of him and uncross his arms so I can take his hands.
“Good, but we won't have any apples for a couple of springs yet.” I tell him and we start walking over to everyone else.
We chatted some more and ate our lunch that Nia brought over. I drank my coffee and Draco had freshly squeezed orange juice, only after informing me that he wasn’t allowed caffeine while pregnant. We finish and I go to the counter to pay our bill.
“I’m going to start on the music room.” He shouts from the hall. “Harry, tell Nia the good news.” She turns around and her face lights up then.
I apparate to Grimmauld because I don’t know what else to do. He must have gone back to the manor, and I haven’t been there yet, not since the war. We haven’t tried again since my panic attack in the kitchen. But I need to see Draco right now and tell him I love him too. Otherwise he’s going to be overthinking things and he’s going to get embarrassed and never want to see me again. Or he might not have even meant what he said and now he thinks that I think he loves me when….Okay maybe I was over thinking now. Still, I need to go get him. I need to go to Malfoy manor. Okay, I can do this. I’m Harry Potter, the boy who lived twice, the saviour of the wizarding world, blah blah blah. I’m still just a person, I can’t do this.
Oh! Turning to face him, I’m shocked to find he has his erection firmly in his grasp. My mouth drops open.
“Does Harry have to be here?” Draco asks then, looking away from me and crossing his arms. I stare at him in hurt with pleading eyes but he refuses to look at me. I guess I deserve this.
“Bye guys! Have a lovely time! And don’t worry, the cat will be fine.” I go to stroke him to prove he’s okay but he swipes his claws at my hand. I laugh nervously and wave Ron and Hermione off.
“Your welcome. I hope he did more than moan at you for not ignoring his birthday.” I say and we both laugh and make our way to the dining room.
“Ready Draco? Harry?” We nod and the second bang goes off. This time it’s a blue baby in the sky with blonde hair and green eyes. I burst out laughing and hug Draco closer. Then I realise I’m crying and so is Draco.
He stops and reaches for a washcloth as I pant against him, wanting…..needing. My hands rest on his firm, muscular thighs. Squirting more soap into the washcloth, he leans down and wash between my legs. I hold my breath. He starts with my balls, his skillful fingers stimulating them through the cloth. Then he moves to my cock and my hip involuntarily thrust up. It’s heavenly, and my hips start a rhythm, pushing against his hand. As the sensations take over, I tilt my head back, my eyes rolling to the back of my head, my mouth slack, and I groan. The pleasure is building slowly, inexorably inside me, I’m close.
“Who does, Dray? That broom needs vanishing. That’s old news. Why are you being so coy? Give it up, babes.”
“Oh no, she’s a hufflepuff from head to toe.” She chuckles and stares at the floor. I shake my head and chuckle.
As we are finishing filling the plates, someone screams and we both whip around. But it’s only Angelina and Fleur. But why are they screaming next to Draco.
“Right Harry, here I have his diet,” she hands me one piece of paper. “This is the things he’s allergic to,” she hands me another piece. “This is his exercise regimen, he needs at least 2 walks a day.” She hands me another piece of paper. “And finally, this is the things he likes to play with, and things he will try to play with but shouldn’t.” She hands me the last 2 pieces of paper and goes over to help Ron get crookshanks out of the carrier. I look at the pieces of paper in my hand and go speechless. Did she say I had to walk the bloody cat?! No way was that happening. I look over and she’s hugging the damn thing, he really only likes Hermione and he puts up with Ron because Hermione loves him.
“Not to me.” All humour is gone from his voice and his gaze intensifies. My belly clenches and I have to tear my eyes away from his and look down at my knotted fingers. What the fuck is going on? I really need to get out of here - now. I unknot my fingers and grab the recorder off the table.
“Your good health!” Mr Potter raises his glass. An appropriate toast from a healer’s husband, it makes me smile.
“Okay your turn Draco.” She tells him when he’s finished buttoning up Leo’s onesie. He hands the baby over to me and starts to undress.
“I’m okay, I was a bit bored, but now you're here so that’s better.” Me and Andy both laugh at that.
“Fine Pans, but you need to get back to bed first.” I point to her bedroom to make my point clear. “For my sake as well as yours.” I whisper while looking at the dirty tissues.
“Probably not what he was thinking. But all I could hear was fat, and ugly, and…. different. I don’t want to be the one that people stare at again. It just took me back to the war, and I don’t want to go back there.” He is crying now, so I wrap my arm around him and pull him close.
“Listen to me Draco. Harry is good under pressure. He was brilliant when I was in labour. He did everything right and didn’t panic. Both of you are going to be brilliant dads. It may be hard at times but you’ll all be there for each other, I just know it.” I smile at that and then make myself known.
“Harry. You use sex as a weapon. It really isn’t fair.” I whisper, staring down at my plate, and then looking directly at him. He raises his eyebrows, surprised, and I see he’s considering my words. He strokes his chin thoughtfully.
“I’d better go rescue Sev, or Harry. I don't know which. You haven't heard the last of this, Pansy Parkinson!” I glare at her.
“Except when you blush, of course. Which is often.” He clarifies. “I just wish I knew what you were blushing about.” He places a piece of muffin in his mouth and starts chewing very slowly, not taking his eyes off me. And right on time, I blush. Shit.
Shit…. I have to deal with Pansy’s persistence and tenacity, and I’m in possession of a signed legal document saying I can’t talk. It’s not a healthy mix.
They seem okay. Harry is enjoying some private joke, and Sev looks unbelievably relaxed given he’s in a social situation.
“Yes Harry, we really do. We should have talked days ago and I’m sorry for kicking you out of the room.”
“You smell divine.” He muzzles behind my ear. His hand rubs me up and down. Reflexively, my hips start to thrust in his hand, as excruciating pleasure spikes through my blood like adrenaline.
Pansy had said he was dangerous; she’d warned me, and she was right. How did she bloody know?! He’s dangerous to my health, because I know I’m going to say yes. And part of me doesn’t want to. Part of me wants to run screaming from this room and all it represents. I am so out of my depth here.
“You need to eat. That’s why you were so sick. Really? It is rule number one of drinking.” He lifts his eyebrow at me. He runs his hand through his hair.
“I don't think I’ve ever thought about it like that. Mrs Robinson was part of that lifestyle. I told you, she’s a good friend now. If you’d like, I can introduce you to one of my former subs. You could talk to them.”
At the foot of the bed, set apart a few feet, is a large oxblood chesterfield couch, just stuck in the middle of the room facing the couch. A strange placement...to have a sofa facing the bed. I smile at myself then because out of everything in this room that I could have found strange I pick up on the sofa, when really it’s the only mundane piece of furniture in the room.
“Well sort off, she has her own floor in the house so she doesn’t have to be around us all the time.” I say to him and we both chuckle.
“Would you like a drink?” I blink at him. After last night? Is he trying to be funny? For a moment I think about asking for a margarita but I lose my nerve.
Sweet Merlin. That was extraordinary. He gazes down at me, a satisfied smile on his face, while I’m sure there’s nothing but gratitude and awe on mine.
“Shhh, yes but it’s fine. Go back to bed. We may be here a while.”  She nods and heads back upstairs. I go back into the room with the sheets. Draco is sat on the end of bed leaning backwards with his hands flat on the bed.
“You’d be willing to do a photo shoot?” My voice goes high again and I blush. Pansy will love me forever if I can pull this off for her. And I’ll be able to see him again tomorrow.  I dismiss that thought, it’s ridiculous.
An hour later she was leaving. She had done most of the talking, like she said she would. She said she was going to come next week and I’d have to start talking then, which I agreed to. Maybe this would help, I did feel better already.
“Has she got a name? No sorry, that’s for you and Ron…” I go to pull away a bit but she grabs me again.
A couple of minutes later the office door opens and a tall, very attractive, and elegantly dressed African American man walks out while shouting behind him, “Golf this week, Potter?”. Golf! What wizard plays golf rather than quidditch?
Olivia jumps up and fetches my jacket. Before she can hand it to me though, Potter takes it from her and holds it up for me. I blush again and feel ridiculously self-conscious but shrug it on anyway. Potter momentarily places his hands on my shoulders and I gasp in surprise at the contact. He doesn’t seem to notice my reaction, or at least doesn’t give anything away. He walks with me to the elevator and with his long fingers presses the call button for me. I stand awkwardly with him next to me looking all coolly self-possessed. Once it arrives, I hurry in and press the button for the ground floor. I am desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here.
“Downstairs making breakfast.” She said and climbed back off the bed, clearly seeing what I was seeing. “Now get up and get dressed and get your butt downstairs so you can give us all the gossip.” She said on her way out of the bedroom.
“I’m sorry. It's just, well, all your symptoms point to pregnancy Mr Malfoy.” Okay what did she just say? My mouth is hanging open and I don’t know what to do.
“Oh, fuck the paperwork.” He growls, and lunges at me. He pushes me up against the elevator and pins my hands above my head with one hand, while pining my to the wall with his hips. Holy shit! His other hand grabs my hair and yanks it down. It's only just not painful. It brings my face up and then his lips are on mine. I moan and this gives his tongue an opening into my mouth. He takes full advantage and expertly explores every inch of my mouth. I have never been kissed like this before. I melt into him. My tongue joins his and they mouth together all touch and sensation. He brings his hand from my hair down to my neck and then back up to my chin where he grips it. I am helpless, with my hands pinned, my face held, and his hips restraining me. He grinds against me and that's when I feel it. His erection against my hip. I’m sure he can feel mine against his leg and I moan again. He wants me! Harry Potter, Greek god, powerful wizard, wants me! And I definitely want him, right now, in this elevator.
We had almost finished the first room now and only had a last coat of paint to do. We decided to do everything white until we have furniture and know what colours we are going with. I was on the ladder doing the ceiling and Draco was doing wherever he could reach. I could tell Draco was getting tired and bored, so I turned the wireless on that we had brought from home. A weird sisters song came on and I could tell that Draco was dying to sing along. So I started singing (off key of course) in hopes he would join in. He didn’t but he started swaying his hips a bit. I got down off the ladder with my paint brush and pulled him close.
I look between the stairs and the living room and just decide to give up. I grab my drink out the kitchen and follow Draco’s lead of making myself comfy on what’s left of the sofa.
“Good thank you mother, tired but good.” She kisses Draco and me on the cheeks and then looks at Leo. “Would you like to hold your grandson, mother?” Draco asks her. She looks at him and then me, practically pleading with her eyes. I smile and offer her the baby. She sits down with him and Draco sits next to her. I sit on the other sofa with Andy. As we are saying hello, Teddy pops his head around from the back of the armchair.
“Right that’s it! Come here.” I ran for him but he screamed and scattered. I cornered him and lifted him up over my shoulder. He was laughing and hitting my back playfully.
“I know. He’s so loyal and kind, but also brave and cunning.” He smirks at me. “Shall we put bets on now or…” I laugh at him and smirk back.
“I have to stay here and clean. There are still marks.” I start breathing heavily and scrubbing harder and harder. My knuckles are catching on the floor and starting to bleed but I can't feel it. I can’t feel anything and I can't breathe and I have to go to the Manor and that’s where he was and where Hermione got tortured and where Luna was held prisoner and I can't breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.
There's a quick break where Potter has a drink and Pansy looks through some of the photos. Potter doesn’t take his eyes off me the whole time. And then it’s back to shooting but standing up this time. Fine by me. Give me a better look.
“Breathe in and out Harry.” Hermione reminds me. I look back over at her and this time I really try. I start copying Hermione and breathing in deep breaths and releasing them slowly. I can feel myself calming already. Hermione can see that I’m calming down so goes over to Draco. “Hey are you okay? Harrys going to be fine, this happens sometimes but never for long.” I’m still crying softly and looking at Draco to see he’s okay. That’s when I see the tear tracks on his face and then I’m horrified when I hear what he says.
“It wasn’t my birthday before.” I shrug and chuckle. Teddy giggles next to me and then climbs onto my shoulders. Then he starts singing happy birthday loudly.
“If you struggle, I’ll tie your feet, too. If you make a noise, Draco, I will gag you. Keep quiet. Pansy is probably outside listening right now, and I haven’t put a silencing spell on the door."
“Why is anyone the way they are? That’s kind of hard to answer. Why do some people like cheese and other people hate it? Do you like cheese? Dobby, my house elf, has left this for supper.” He levitates some large white plates over to him from the cupboard, wandless and wordless magic again, and then places one in front of me.
The following day, I fire-call my mother after I get home from work. It’s been a relatively peaceful day at The Hogs Head, allowing me far too much time to think. I’m restless, nervous about my showdown with Mr Control Freak tomorrow, and at the back of my mind, I’m worried that perhaps I’ve been too negative in my response to the contract. Perhaps he’ll call the whole thing off.
If you recall, I was going through this list when I was distracted and bedded by a passing control freak.
Potter gives me a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth showing, glorious smile. Oh Merlin. I nearly drop right there and then. I turn away and head back to Pansy and Blaise.
“Yeah!” I practically shout at him. “Sorry, I mean yes. That sounds like a lovely idea.” We are both smiling at each other now and we share a long slow kiss before we apparate out.
I head into the bathroom and really want to brush my teeth but there is only Harry’s toothbrush there. I could just use a spell, or….I could have part of him be in my mouth. I grab the toothbrush and feel that the bristles are still wet. He must have used it lately. I spread the toothpaste on and brush my teeth. I feel naughty and very slytherin.
His words are like some kind of incendiary device; my blood flames. He leans down and kisses my lips gently, and he sucks at my lower lip.
“There you are. What do you think of this for Nia’s bedroom?” He only has a T-shirt and joggers on today and his T-shirt is riding up a bit to show his belly. I wonder if he knows Neville is here.
“You’re welcome dear. I put some chocolates in for Harry and some sweets in for you. I know you have a sweet tooth.” We all chuckle and move on to the next present.
I stand there, next to the massive table, as he starts pulling things out of the fridge. He takes them over to the surface top and starts to cut up a french baguette.
“Mr Potter.” I nod politely to him and walk closer to him. Weasley is stood to the side and I smile at him. “Hello, Weasley.” I say.
“Shall I fuck you this way, or this way, or this way? There’s an endless choice.” he breathes against my lips. He withdraws his hand and reaches over to the bedside table for a condom. He kneels up between my legs, and very slowly he pulls my boxers off, which are wet with pre-cum, and stares down at me, his eyes gleaming. He puts on the condom, and I watch fascinated, mesmerised.
The rest of the night is spent relaxing on the sofa just the two of us without a care in the world about what crookshanks was destroying.
“Harry, we need to go to mine first and get my bag. It’s already packed.” He tells me and I lead her to the floo.
Lily reappears with a couple of house elves and a pretty young woman with blond pigtails. They all have trays hovering in front of them. The young woman is dressed smartly in pale blue and her eyes immediately find Harry’s in the room. She blushes and gazes at him from under her long mascara-covered lashes.
Standing behind Potter is a man about the same age with the brightest ginger hair I’ve ever seen. It’s cut short and he has stubble. He is dressed in a suit and looks very sharp. His blue eyes are watching everyone as he stands quietly behind.
“Do I even deserve to be this happy with you Harry, after everything I did?” He asks with his head down against my neck. I lift him up then and speak to his face.
I quail at the thought. I haven't signed that contract yet. Perhaps I won’t. Perhaps I’ll stay in France where he can’t reach me.
“Have you packed everything in the nappy bag?” Draco asks irritably while trying to shush a crying Leo.
“Yep. All by myself.” He says and gives the biggest smile. I remember his face back in the park and I smile sadly. Draco looks over and seems to sense I’m feeling low because he grabs my hand and squeezes lightly. I smile at him and between us we have a silent conversation saying that we will talk later about it.
It was not my intention to end up here (and have Draco hate me more than he already does), when I went in search of somewhere for me and Draco to finally live together. You see, I definitely was not moving into the manor. Way too many bad memories there. Draco said grimmauld place was too dark and dank for him. That coming from someone who currently lives where Voldemort had once taken up residents. I guessed Draco still only lives there though for his mother but it’s time for him to start his own life. He hates spending time at grimmauld for some reason. I mean yeah it's still a bit unlivable in some rooms but for the most part it was okay. Me and Ron and Hermione had spent a long time doing it up before we all started jobs, or in Hermione's case went back to school. Even some of the other Weasleys had helped, including George and Charlie. Neville had helped with the garden and Luna had helped with… Well I don’t know what Luna had done really except make my house smell like burnt grass when she went round with her smudge stick, but she was good company for a couple of weeks. I'll miss that place when and if we actually move in here. I have some good memories there, some great end of the war parties were thrown there, and some amazing small get-togethers, I’ll even remember the times after the funerals where we sat hugging on sofas and reliving good memories of the dead. Grimmauld is were i finally broke it off with Ginny after realising i was gay. She understood but it took her a while to really move on and be a best mate again. It’s where me and Draco shared a lot of firsts too. Like our first kiss, after he walked me home a couple of dates into our relationship, and our first argument (inevitable) about which broom was better to fly. It was also home to our first time having sex, a little awkward and painful but perfect none the less. It really will be greatly missed but it's all for a good reason. I mean what better reason than to start our own family and have new memories.
“My sexual health. Well, all of my previous partners have had blood tests, the magical ones among them have been screened by a healer, and I myself have regular tests every six months for all the health risks you mention. All my recent tests are clear. I have never taken drugs. In fact, I’m vehemently anti-drug. I have a strict no-tolerance policy with regard to drugs for all my employees, and I insist on random drug testing.”
“Yep.” He says and pulls his top up. His belly is getting really big now, he doesn’t let me see it much nowadays.
“That was…” I couldn’t even finish that sentence and just rubbed the back of my neck in embarrassment.
“That too, but most of all hot. The shirt really suits you and your colouring. The way it clings.” She smirks.
And slowly he eases into me, slowly, slowly, until he is buried in me once more. Stretching, filling relentless. I groan loudly. It feels deeper this time, delectable. I groan again, and he deliberately circles his hips and pulls back, pausing a beat, and then eases his way back in. He repeats this motion again and again, circling my prostate each time. It’s driving me insane - his teasing, deliberately slow thrusts, and the intermittent feeling of fullness is overwhelming.
“Nice to finally meet you Mr and Mrs potter. I’m Draco.” I look at him but he’s looking at the grave in all seriousness. “It was very unfortunate that your grandson was born on the same day you died but things happen for a reason I guess. Would you like to meet him? His name is Leo James Potter, and you’d be the first to meet him.” Draco says and gets Leo out his wrap. He passes him to me and places a thick blanket next to the flowers. I lay Leo down on it and he opens his eyes wide.
“I want the chance to explore the possibility that you do,” he murmurs, staring down at me. He reaches up and caresses my face, his thumb tracing my lower lip. “I don't know any other way, Draco. This is who I am.”
The bath is a white stone, deeo, egg-shaped affair, very modern. Harry leans over and fills it from the faucet on the tiled wall. He pours some expensive-looking bath oil into the water. It foams as the bath fills and smells of sweet, sultry jasmine. He stands and gazes at me, his eyes dark, then peels his t-shirt off and casts it on the floor.
I bite my lip and his expression changes instantly. He looks sternly at me. I reach across and pick up my first-ever oyster. Okay…..here goes nothing. I squirt some lemon juice on it and tip it up. It slips down my throat, all sea water, salt, the sharp tang of citrus, and fleshiness…...ooh. I lick my lips, and he’s watching me intently, his eyes hooded.
I scowl at that and shake the unpleasant thought away. How will I introduce him to Sev? The hall is still at least half full, and Sev has not moved from his spot. He sees me, gets up, and makes his way down.
“Ron! Mate. Did you know? You are such a good friend! And I’m so shit! I’m awful and you should stop being friends with me immediately. But please don’t because I would miss you very much. Okay bye.” I tell him drunkenly and put the phone down on him. Then I ring Hermione.
Placing my hand in his, I slide out and stand up beside him. He releases me, and his hand reaches for my elbow. He leads me back through the bar and up the grand stairs to a mezzanine floor. A young man in full uniform approaches us.
At 8 o’clock there is a knock at the door. Draco has just had a contraction and is having a drink now while I dap his head with a washcloth.
“I don’t have a philosophy as such. I’m very singular, driven. I like control - of myself and those around me.
“So tell me the best thing to ever happen.” He said to me while giving me shit eating grin. He didn’t believe me and wouldn’t understand until I had finished. So I explained everything, how Hermione had come to the office and how I’d run through the ministry to get to the estate agency as quick as possible, how I’d looked at the pictures and just instantly saw our family there. Then I told him I’d signed the papers and handed the money over and that it was all done and dusted.
He is holding me tight against his body and practically moving my body for me. He is leading me all over the dance floor with grace. Then my mothers warning comes to mind: Never trust a man who can dance.
“It’s alright love, I know.” I say gently back. I get up then and look at him. “So, how about we go take some of that anger out on ripping our home apart?” I ask him and he smiles back.
“That’s not the point. Why should you buy these for me?” Oh right yeah, he vanished my other clothes. But still!
This house is gonna be it for us. It’s either going to make us or break us, and as we walk through the wonky front door to see what lies beyond, I think to myself, this may break us after all. The past couple of weeks have been quite tense. Draco’s been in a pissy mood and I’ve had to work overtime, which is probably why he’s in a pissy mood but I can't help it, it's my job. I told him when we got into this relationship, 3 years ago, that I took my job very seriously and it was very demanding being an auror. I thought he understood that and it has worked well up until last month. He started complaining that i was never home for tea and that he hardly saw me, with him leaving early to get to his potions store and me getting home late. He asked me how I expected to raise a family like this, which thus caused one of our biggest fights in a while. He doesn’t understand what it means to me to be an auror and catch the bad guys and keep people safe. I need it and he doesn’t understand that. He avoided me for 2 weeks, and because we don’t live together that made it possible for him to avoid me. That’s when I started thinking about a home and living together. If I’d known I’d end up buying this place then I would have hit myself across the head and told myself it was a bad idea.
“Be careful Teddy, no snatching.” She says and lets him see while she’s holding it. “Wow, look at it. How far along are you Draco?” She asks while Teddy is staring in amazement at the moving image of his baby cousin.
“At least you’ve met him. And he obviously wants to get to know you better. Now stop being a pussy and go call him.” She snaps at me and then hangs up. I chuckle at what she considers motivation. I put my phone back in my jeans pocket and head back inside to finish my shift.
I drag myself around the back of the building and lean against the wall. I put my hands on my knees, bend over and take deep breaths. Once my breathing is under control and I don’t feel sunburnt, I take my broom out of my pocket and unshrink it.
“I really wish you had worn a shirt, you're putting me off.” I huff and turn to go back inside. “No wait Harry please.”
“You look at that house and what we have been through. Then put yourself in Draco’s shoes and imagine you found out that the girl you bullied throughout school and who got torchered by your aunt, had done this to you, how would you feel, Hermione?!” Now she looked like she might cry. Dammit, I can’t feel guilty. I need to defend Draco.
“Well, you know a lot more about me now.” he snaps, his mouth presses into a hard line. “I knew you were inexperienced, but a fucking virgin!” He says it like it’s a dirty word. I feel like I’m about to breakdown but I won’t give him the satisfaction. “Hell, Draco, I just showed you….” he groans. “Merlin. Have you ever been kissed, apart from by me?”
Grabbing my jacket, I dash into the bathroom and stare at my too-bright eyes, my flushed face - and my hair! Holy fuck….just fucked man bun does not suit me. I hunt in the vanity unit for a brush and find a comb. It will have to do. I quickly brush it and then tie it back into a messy, neat bun, and despair at my clothes. Maybe I should take Harry up on his offer of clothes. Struggling into my jacket, pleased that it covers the telltale patterns from his tie, I take one last anxious glance at myself in the mirror. This will have to do. I make my way downstairs and into the main living room.
“She did. I don’t know what made her think we’d like it.” I said accusingly, I was not getting the blame for this.
We walk the rest of the way together anyway, and chat about what has been happening since I left school.
“Well, let's just say I’m glad it’s over and I never have to see the man again. He was so intimidating. He is very focused, intense really, and really, really young.”
I open it and find a half leather box with three seemingly identical old cloth-covered books. They are in mint condition and there is a card. The writing is neat and tidy and reads:
“Ugh, no he did not. Monsieur Floubert, was such a domineering tyrant, I'd call him an ogre but that would be offensive to ogres.”
“What? It’s catchy.” He says to me. “chéri is perfect Teddy, thank you. Do you wanna know a secret?” He whispers to him, to which Teddy jumps down from me and holds Draco’s hand.
“Hey, thanks Luna. Hey Gin.” I hug them both and Nia goes back outside to practice one spell or another.
“No mother, we haven’t even discussed names yet.” I look a bit sheepish at that, as if we are meant to have names picked out this early.
And then there’s the Red Room of Pain. I rub my wrists reflexively - thin strips of plastic will do that to a guy. She taught him all that, too, or ruined him, depending on one’s point of view. Or perhaps he would have found his way there in spite of Mrs R. I realise, in that moment, that I hate her. I hope that I never meet her because I will not be responsible for my actions if I do. I can’t remember ever feeling this passionately about anyone, especially someone I’ve never met. Gazing unseeing out the window, I nurse my irrational anger and jealousy.
Fuck my mouth! I moan, and I bite down on him, he gasps, and he pulls my hair tighter, painfully, so I release him.
“Relationship!” I squeal in a too high voice. I look around, slightly embarrassed but nobody is around. “Pansy! I barely know the guy.”
“Let me know about tomorrow.” He pulls his wallet from his back pocket and takes a card out. It has his name, number, and floo network on it. “Call me via phone or floo, but before ten in the morning.”
“I don’t deserve it okay?!” He all but shouts at me. “They are such kind people. Don’t you understand. Bill got disfigured because of me Harry! That was my fault! I let the death eater into Hogwarts and Greyback attacked Bill, because I let him in! And Fred died! He died! And everything’s my fault!” He was crying now but all I could do was stare and listen. “Good people died, and they didn’t deserve it! I should have died, but I didn’t. I got to live, while people lost their mothers, sons, brothers, cousins. Everyone lost somebody in that war, and I was on the wrong fucking side. And now… now you ask me to come to dinner with people who should hate me and wish me dead, and you wonder why I decline.” He takes a deep breath, tears still spilling from his eyes, and seems to be finished. I take his face in my hands and make him look at me.
“I really am sorry Harry.” He looks up with big eyes and how could I ever stay mad at him, except he’s not to blame. I start to protest when he kisses me. Then he chuckles and says “it must be the wrackspurts causing pregnancy brain.” We laugh together at that and share another kiss.
“Good. Until tomorrow, perhaps.” He turns to leave and then pauses. “Oh and Draco, I’m really glad Miss Parkinson couldn’t do the interview.” He smiles and then heads out, leaving me almost quivering and with a distinct bulge in my pants. I just stood there staring at the door for several minutes before someone shouts over for refills and I shake myself back into work mode.
“Why are you wearing your shirt?” I ask. He stills. After a beat, he shuffles out of his shirt, and he lies back down on me. I feel his warm skin against mine. Hmmm… it feels heavenly. He has a light dusting of hair across his chest, which tickles my back.
“Of course i do but…” he looks away and then carries on “I've never done this before, okay?” Oh. He looks so embarrassed but he shouldn’t be. So what? I’ve only done it a few times and I was pissed most of the time.
“I want to lavish money on you. Let me buy you some clothes. I may need you to accompany me to functions, and I want you dressed well. I’m sure your salary, when you do get a job, won’t cover the kind of clothes I’d like you to wear.”
“Can I take this cap off now? I feel ridiculous.” He just gives a small chuckle and I take it off, shrink it and put it in my robe pocket. I also undo my robe down the middle so that my grey shirt and neck are showing. It’s a bit more skin showing than I am used to, but even I have to admit I look hot in it.
“Yeah! We even got to hear little chéri heartbeat, wanna hear?” Before she could answer, Draco had gotten the dragon teddy out and pressed it’s belly. And there it was again, our baby’s heartbeat.
After a couple of hours, everything is fixed. The cleaning just needs to be finished and then we can start on the paint.
“Well, what do you want to do today?” I ask him, and I know what he's going to say because it’s what he always says.
“Why are you rubbing my stomach?” He asked groggily. I looked down and low and behold I actually was rubbing his stomach. I had no idea I was doing this let alone for how long. I stopped and moved my hand up to his face to cup his cheek.
The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions at times to be mutually agreed between the personal trainer and the Submissive. The personal trainer will report to the Dominant on the Submissive’s progress.
“Severus? He’s…..taciturn. Doesn’t speak much and is almost always grumpy, but deep down I know how he feels.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right. I’m feeling a bit depleted.” He said and wiped his brow. Then he signed and sat down on the newly placed floor.
Why is he even here? I begin to feel faint then, and he must notice my dizziness because he grabs me before I fall. He lifts me into his arms and holds me close to his chest like a child.
“Of course.” He smiles shyly at me and we go over to the oak tree, where I was just a minute ago. We can still hear the music over here but it’s softer and better to slow dance to. We lean into each other and begin swaying.
“If you would all like to look up, the fireworks will start any minute. Hermione, Draco, who wants to go first?” Draco just shakes his head and Hermione giggles and grabs Ron's hand.
Pansy blushed. Oh shit…..Pansy Parkinson goes all Draco Malfoy on me. She gives me a dewy-eyed look. I’ve never seen her react this way to a man before. My jaw drops to the floor. Where's Pansy; what have you done with her?
I blush. Oh fuck….  Why did he say he couldn't make love? I will do anything he wants. He strokes my hair so it is pushed behind my ear.
“I can do it.” Draco says in a small voice and takes Fred by the hand. He goes with him and they go and sit next to the flowers by the oak tree on the right.
I hadn’t even realised Hermione had got up and walked over to fix my tie until she had her hands on it. “You’re smiling Harry.” She said while smiling up at me. “You really like him don’t you?”
“You’re ready to push!” Katie says and my heart stops. This is it, a coupe more hours at most and I’ll be a dad. “How exciting!” She says. Draco glares at her and she loses the excitement. “Right sorry. Do you want to get in the pool now or when you're closer?” She asks him professionally.
He leans down, kisses and tugs at each of my nipples in turn with cold lips. I fight my body as it tries to thrust in response.
Oh shit. What is that all about? I pick up my fork and eat slowly, trying to chew. I must remember not to put so much on my plate if he’s going to be weird about food. His expression softens as I carefully make my way through my breakfast. I note that he cleans his plate.
When I glance up he is staring at me and leaning against the doorway with one hand on the wall next to the elevator. As smug as ever. Although he is very very good looking, and this is very very unnerving.
“Blaise? And Harry Potter? Draco! What was the stupid fool thinking?” She shakes her head in disgust and returns to packing.
“What do you want to know?” he asks, and raising his hand runs his fingers gently downy cheek to my chin, tilting my head back so he can look directly into my eyes. I squirm inwardly. I cannot lie to this man.
“Then where are you going? And what time? And with who?” I ask him because I know he won’t be able to answer. He may be good at lying but not to me.
It’s fine, I’m fine. I’ll get over it soon enough. Tomorrow is about Ron and I should have been the one taking him out all week, but as usual it’s all about me. Merlin, I’m a shit friend.
“Merlin, Harry! I was so worried.” Then she pulls me back to look at me. “You’ve lost so much weight. Are you alright?” I pull her in for another hug and nearly start crying. Then I tell her everything that happened and that I’m seeing a mind healer now. She’s crying by the end and hugs me again.
He hands me over the catalogue and shows me dark wooden wardrobes, chest of draws, and 2 side tables. They actually look really nice and will suit the dark blue paint.
“And that reminds me, why did you send me those books, Harry?” My voice is soft when I ask him and he soon puts down his cutlery and regards me intently. My mouth goes dry.
I try a forkful of omelette but can barely taste it. Basic training! I want to fuck your mouth. Does that form part of basic training?
“I was in the area,” he says as way of explanation. “I thought I’d get a drink and maybe something to eat. It’s great to see you again Mr Malfoy.” His voice is warm and slightly husky.
When we step into the elevator it is empty. We’re alone. Suddenly the atmosphere around us is charged. It may be the close proximity and the enclosed space but it feels exhilarating. My heart races and my breathing increases. He is fully gazing at me now and his pupils have grown dark. I stop breathing and bit my lip.
“Ermm...I’m going to have a shower.” I mutter. “Thanks?” I say uncertain. He did kind of vanish my other clothes, so he did owe me.
“Okay heads out Draco. On your next contraction give me one more big push, okay?” He nods to her and then he squeezes my hand tightly as another one comes on. He pushes and then all of a sudden it all stops. He sags against me and tries to catch his breath. I look over and Katie is holding a tiny baby in her arms. Then he starts to cry.
“No, you deserve a lot more for what you’ve been though. And me and Harry will gladly give it to you, as long as you continue to be our friend and help us when we need you. And of course we will do the same.” Draco says and strokes her hair out her face.
“I needed to discuss something with professor McGonagall and I thought I would drop in on you too. Hope that's okay?” I ask him and stroke fang. He’s gotten old and doesn’t jump up at me anymore.
“Mr Potter, it’s Longbottom here. I have the information you require.” I hear a voice say. I don’t mean to listen in but it's silent where we are and the voice on the other side is quite loud.
“Okay, but then I really need to study.” I can’t hide the irritation still in my voice, but go into the living room and wait for supper.
“Everything’s fine, Draco is in labour.” She screams then and I have to pull the phone away from my ear.
I look up at the sound of the door shutting. Draco must have just left. Oh well, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day’ and all that. Maybe one day we will talk nicely to each other, maybe even be friends. I laugh to myself thinking that maybe one day I will be ‘Harry’ to him and he’ll be ‘Draco’ to me. Yeah right, when dragons swim.
“Oh merlin, I’m sorry if I’m interrupting.” I say slightly embarrassed. “I should have called first.”
“No, you’re coming to bed and tomorrow we are going to talk about what’s been wrong lately. Please.” I add at the end because I really don’t want to argue about it. He just nods and gives a little half smile.
“Her name is Cassie, and like I said it’s important so I need to be there.” He looks kind of apologetic but I’m still pissed.
“Goddammit! That stupid fucking cat!” I slam my drink down on the counter and head to the living room. As soon as I open the door, crookshanks shoots past me. I try to grab him but he expertly avoids me and runs around Draco and up the stairs.
“Well I don’t know any gay guys around here and I only now one lesbian and she’s my ex. This town is not exactly in the 21st century yet but it's nice enough.” She's very friendly and chatty and I kind of like her.
“Oh.” I stare at him dumbfounded as I stop breathing and my insides clench. Ohh….that’s so nice. I suppress a groan.
Harry is sat at the dining table reading a newspaper. For a second it looks like it could be Pansy. Same black hair, same neat posture, sat reading at a table. Shit, Pansy!
“I've been acting so casual about this and pretending it's not happening but it's starting to scare me now Harry.” He continues sobbing.
I have to get away from him, to reassemble my thoughts. I pull my hand away and walk away from him. Suddenly I trip on a root and fall forward.
With that decided we head back downstairs to collect the cleaning things to start on Nia’s room. Draco still can’t use a lot of magic so he’s still on cleaning duty while I sort the holes in the walls and missing floors.
I walk nonchalantly back into the living room and over to Harry and his mother. Lily is in full flow.
“I feel fat and tired and achy and bored! How are you Ginevra?! Oh and by the way, Nia is clearly A hufflepuff.” He says angrily. I send him a look telling him to cool down. Ginny just laughs though and doesn’t take any crap.
He smiles, and his long fingers reach down to collect an olive. He pops it in his mouth, and my eyes linger on his mouth, that mouth, that’s been on me….all parts of me. I blush.
Pansy is at the table when I walk in, with her laptop open and music blaring. It’s how she concentrates. She looks up and her welcome smile falls.
“Thank fuck.” he whispers, and thrusts hard once more and groans as he reaches his climax, pressing himself into me. Then he stills, his body rigid.
“Thanks for showing us the house Harry, it really is lovely. We best be getting off so I can feed this little monster.” She kissed Rose’s head and collected her things. “Call us as soon as anything happens.” She goes over to Harry and gives him a half hug, with the side she isn’t holding the baby, and then kisses his head like she did Rosies.  Then she does the same to Draco and whispers ‘good luck’ to him. She smiles at her and we say our goodbyes.
After he has finished his bottle and burped and been changed, I put him back down. Then I go to check on Teddy. He’s fast asleep in his own bed. I go back to bed and climb in next to Draco. Once again he rolls over to get comfy on me.
“Because they were all established submissives. They knew what they wanted out of a relationship with me and generally what I expected. With them, it was just a question of fine-tuning the soft limits, details like that.”
“Come on draco, we just have to have a look around, take some notes and then we can go back to grimmauld and work out which room to sort first. Deal?” I eyed him until he gave in with a sigh.
“Ermm...well our cook has just left to take his break, but I could make you a sandwich?” I duck my head to hide my persistent blush.
Being busy is good. It allows a bit of time to think but not too deeply. Music blaring in my ears also helps to starve off deep thought. I came here to spend the night in Harry Potter’s bed and managed it, even though he doesn't let anyone sleep in his bed. I smile, mission accomplished. Big time, I grin. Big, big time, and I’m distracted by the memory of last night. His words, his body, his lovemaking…..I close my eyes as my body hums at the recollection, and my cocks starts to respond. Then I scowl and remember…..fucking - not lovemaking. I ignore it but deep down I know it’s right. I shake my head, my erection having wilted, and concentrate on the task at hand.
“That’s the tree from the barn.” Nia confirms my thinking and stands next to me facing the garden now. “I heard you and Draco talking about it. It hasn’t got any apple left right now but next spring it will have even more. I looked after that since day one of landing in that barn. It was dying so I helped it live. The apples are juicy and crunchy and just right.” I hug her to my side and then Draco to my other side, and look out over the beautiful garden which sparkles in the fairy lights.
Today is Draco’s birthday, but he hates celebrating it and wont let me tell anyone else when it is. He told me not to get him anything but of course I ignored him like every year and I’ve gotten him a silver dragon on a chain. On the back I’ve engraved ‘I love you my dragon’. We are going to have dinner with his mother later and then we are coming back and I’m making him a bath with rose petals and lavender bath salts.
“You’re going to kiss him, aren’t you Harry?” She squealed out, while coming to sit next to her boyfriend on my couch.
“.....and also an ex-student here and a major benefactor to Hogwarts university. Please welcome Mr Harry Potter.”
“Oh Merlin, Draco I’m so sorry.” She turns to face me and looks guilty. “I didn’t even think.” I huff at her and turn my face away.
“Well I don’t know about anyone else but…” he says and I’m completely hurt at what he's saying for about a second until he speaks again. “I knew it!” He burst out laughing and Angelina Smacks him, “what?! He’s huge and always throwing up or crying. He’s worse than Hermione.” He laughs some more and a few people join in. Then we are all laughing including Draco.
“Harry, what you fail to understand is that I wouldn't talk about us to anyone anyway. Even Pansy. So it’s immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not. If it means so much to you, or your lawyer….whom you obviously talk to, then fine. I’ll sign.”
“Of course, you don’t even have to ask Harry, don’t be silly.” She smiled at him while rubbing his shoulder as he walked past her into Ron and Hermione’s house that they’d bought 2 years ago.
“No. I told you, I don’t sleep with anyone, except you when you’re stupefied with drink.” His voice is reprimanding.
“OH.” It’s silent for a bit and then he shouts over, “WHAT DID SHE USED TO DO?” I look over to him and decide to land. He sees me land and turns around and comes after me. “Hey I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to intrude. You don’t have to tell me of course. I’m sorry Harry let’s just-“
When we land, I take a look around. I never even knew this place existed, I’ve been mainly flying at Mollys and Arthur’s place. To be fair, we have some good games there. Maybe Draco can come one day.
“Piss off you prat.” He looks around and then back at me. “Do you want some help with that, you seem to be taking your time.” Now it's his turn to smirk at me.
“This one is from Andromeda and Teddy.” I tell everyone and open it. Inside are some baby clothes of Teddy’s I think, plus some new ones. A couple of hats. Some little baby booties. And a brand new changing bag.
“Oh Harry! He’s got your eyes.” Narcissa says suddenly, he must have opened his eyes looking for the cause of the noise. I chuckle at her.
Am I submissive? Maybe I come across that way. Maybe I misled him in the interview. I’m shy, yes….but submissive? I let Pansy bully me - is that the same? And those soft limits, jeez. My mind boggles, but I’m reassured that they are up for discussion.
Then Ron and Hermione apparate in at the bottom of the drive and they look like they are arguing. I go to meet them halfway.
“Right back at you with wow. This place looks great, nice touch with the candles.” I take my coat off and hang it up. As I’m turning around Draco comes up behind me and puts his hands on my hips. He slides up my back and kisses my neck.
“Wingardium Leviosa!” She says perfectly while pointing my spare wand at a leaf. The leaf floats up softly just like the feathers in my first year.
“Draco is 8 days overdue, he is bound to be a bit...moody.” By the sounds of it, she couldn’t decide what to say either.
To the right is the hammock and to the left and back a bit is a huge oak. Nia walks over and leans on it.
“I did, but it only works some of the time healer Bell said. And she said apparation will definitely cause sickness in very bad cases, apparently like mine. I’m okay through, let's get our home started.” He takes my hand and pulls me into the house this time.
“But having Teddy and having our own is completely different. What if we are no good? It’s so much pressure.” Draco says clearly panicking a bit. I can’t say much though because I’ve had my little panic at grimmauld.
Then for pudding he had outdone himself and made me a homemade treacle tart. This man, who people still call a death eater and a killer years after the war, has done the nicest thing anyone has done for me in a long time. It has taken time and energy and lots of practise, but he did it and he did it for me.
“Wait, what’s his name?” Hermione asks before I can leave. I smirk at them and can’t decide whether to tell them yet or not. But I give in eventually.
All that was left was one bedroom, the stables, and the pond, which we had decided to put in alongside a willow tree, needed finishing. Then we just need to collect the rest of our stuff from the manor and grimmauld place, which was all boxed up, and we would have officially moved in. We haven’t started sleeping here yet because we want to have everything here first, but we spend most of our time here now.
“She said she’s concerned. What if something’s wrong?” He looks about to cry so I bend down and kiss his cheek.
“Well why are you upset then?” I get down on one knee and hold his hands. “Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?” He starts crying more then but happy tears. Then finally nods his head.
Ginny and Luna waved over from where they were now cuddled up on one of the sofas listening to Arthur explain about the tv for the 100th time.
“I will, don’t worry.” I lean down to kiss his again and can see his erection has deflated a bit. While I’m snogging his mouth I put my hand between us and try to get him excited once more. He gets back into it rather quickly then.
Just then, something Sirius said comes to me. ‘We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.’ And he was right. Malfoy clearly had good in him, he was feeding Teddy and helping Andy. Maybe he was changing.
“Yes hi! Harry talks about you a lot, he says you're very clever and brave.” Nia says with a huge smile on her face. Then she goes over and hugs Hermione. “I would love to listen to you sometime.” Hermione blushes and pats her back awkwardly.
“I’ll tell you but you can’t tell anyone else. I’m telling everyone on Sunday at Mollys. We just want this week to ourselves.” They both nod so I carry on. “His name is Leo James Potter.” Hermione starts crying again and Ron hugs her close.
“I do hope you're not calling me old Mr Potter?” She says and then carries on walking. Me and Ron burst out laughing and sit down with our backs against the tree.
“Ermm, Greg, this is Harry Potter. Mr Potter, this is Gregory Goyle. We went to school together a few years ago.” I tell him, as I feel a need to explain myself. “We don’t see each other often, he lives in America playing professional quidditch.” I’m babbling…. please stop.
“Draco, you had no choice in the things you did. The war was awful for everyone, but we were just scared children. Bad decisions were made by both bad and good people, but it worked out in the end. And now we are here and we are happy.” I held his face between my hands and smiled at him with happy tears in my eyes now. He nodded and kissed one of my palms. “Now let's get that face washed and get back out there.”
When we get back from lunch Nia offers to help with some decorating. We have picked out all the colours and wallpapers for the house but just have to get them up now. All the furniture has been ordered and is on it’s way. We just have to decorate and then build the furniture and we will basically be done. I’m bringing a few things from grimmauld but Draco doesn’t want anything from the manor. After that we just have to pack our things and move in. And done!
I sprint to the bedroom and throw on some relatively clean trousers and top. Then I apparate straight out and to the manor. He’s opened the wards to me again and I land in his bedroom. I start to head to the bathroom when an elf appears with a pop in front of me.
“I didn’t know what you liked, so I got a selection.” He glares at me with a sort of apologetic smile.
“Shhhh it’s okay, not long now really. Do you want to get in the pool now?” I ask him but he shakes his head after a minute and hugs my arm. “I can get in with you too.” I say quietly because I know that’s the reason he wants to stay here. But he wanted the pool in his birth plan.
The hours tick by and I don’t even realise the time, which was the whole point really. I’m cleaning the shower when I hear a pop of apparation. I look around and see Kreacher staring at me.
Her theme is “what next after Hogwarts?” Oh, what next indeed. Harry is watching Pansy, his eyebrows raised - in surprise, I think. Yes, it could have been Pansy who went to interview him. And it could have been Pansy who he was now making indecent proposals to. Beautiful Pansy and beautiful Harry together. I could be like the two girls beside me, admiring from afar. I know Pansy wouldn't have given him the time of day. What did she call him the other day? Creepy. The thought of a confrontation between Pansy and Harry makes me uncomfortable. I have to say I don't know which of them I would put my money on.
I can feel tears start to form in my eyes but splash water over my face and shake my head. Stop this, Malfoy! I reach for the body wash and rub it all over myself. It smells of him and I take a deep breath. Just as I’m washing it off, he knocks on the door.
“Don’t you have a gag reflex?” he asks, astonished. “Merlin, Draco…..that was….good, really good. Unexpected, though.” He frowns. “You know, you never cease to amaze me.”
I have no answer for that. On one level it’s up there with ‘I want to bite that lip’; on another, it’s so selfish. I frown and take a bite of cod, trying to assess mentally what concessions I’ve gained. The food, the sleep. He’s going to take it slow, and we haven't discussed soft limits. But I’m not sure I can face that over food.
“I don't think there’s anything wrong with your ego.” But even as I say it, I don't feel the conviction of my words - something elusive crosses my mind, a fleeting thought, but it’s lost before I can grasp it.
“Yeah well, he keeps surprising me with his brilliance. I must ask Hermione where she got him.” He said out loud but was clearly speaking to himself. He still had his drink in hand and wandered into the living room.
“Come, I have a private dining room booked. No public.” He smiles at me enigmatically and climbs out of the booth, holding his hand out to me.
After I finish torturing him and we’ve both caught our breath I roll back onto my side of the bed. This is immediately followed by Draco rolling over and draping himself over my chest.
“Come on cub, bedtime. Say goodnight.” He leans his head on my shoulder and wraps his legs around my hips.
“I know uncle Harry, and I love you and uncle Draco too. Goodnight.” He says with a yawn and turns over. I shut the door and head downstairs to collect Draco.
“I know, and I’m glad. This little cherry is a happy little accident.” He says in a quiet voice while smiling and rubbing his right hand over his stomach. I lean over and kiss his stomach and then I kiss his mouth.
“Nah, I’m going with Gryffindor, just like his dad.” He smiles at me. “He’s got nerve that kid, telling everyone our secret.” He chuckles.
“Right, ask Blaise about the shoot, we both know he’ll do anything for you, and call Potter to see if he will do Hogwarts.” I roll my eyes at her again for making a dig about Blaise….again.
“Yeah well, you’d hand her over to anyone too if she’d been up all night screaming.” He said half jokingly. Hermione whacked him for it anyway and we got on with the tour.
Ugh. he has to write these down! Of course - they all look very sensible and, frankly, necessary …. Any sane person wouldn’t want to be involved in this sort of thing, surely. Though I now feel a little queasy.
e strokes my cock with his other hand and spreads the precum. "See how much your body likes this, Draco. You’re so hard just for me.”  There is awe in his voice. He moves his fingers in and out in quick succession.
We start walking then and don’t get very far before his phone rings again. Holy shit! Is this his life - constant nagging phone calls and messages?
“Yeah he is, but he’s so happy. He’s just with Katie at the moment, I’ve got to take this little guy back in a minute.” I smile down at Leo and kiss his cheek.
About an hour later, I’m giving Teddy his bottle when I hear the door open. I figure it’s Andromeda so I don’t bother getting up. I’m sitting in the armchair feeding Teddy and it’s sort of relaxing. Next thing I hear stops the relaxing feeling and panic sets in.
“Okay.” I answer softly. If I go, that’s it. The thought is surprisingly painful, but I steel myself and keep my mask up.
“Thank you Harry. It wasn’t planned but I guess that’s just how our life is.” That made me chuckle and agree with her. Ron speaks up then.
“Because you aren’t a child, just put your things away!” He huffs and finishes putting Leo in his pram. “Did you get the wipes?” I sigh and head back upstairs for the wipes.
“Do you mind?” Ron goes over to Draco and offers him the baby. Draco looks shocked for about a second and holds his arms out without realising I think. As soon as the baby is in his arms though, he smiles and coos the baby.
“Hiya Andy. Yeah we do. It’s not about the house and it might come as a shock to you, as it did to us.” I look to Draco and he’s smiling at me, then he places his hand on his belly. I follow his lead and place my hand on top of his. “Draco’s going to have a baby!” I say all in on.
“No not really, I’ve had a couple of nosebleeds, dizziness, headaches, feeling hot, pains in my side, saw breasts, and leg cramps. Everything that you warned me about basically.” He chuckles dryly.
Then it hits me like a brick wall. Everything comes back! Draco, the argument, the drinking, calling Ron and Hermione drunk and telling them to not be my friend, them coming over, and eventually putting me to bed.
“Hi, Dray.” She leaps from her seat and jumps on me, giving me a hug. She then holds me at arms length and examines me. I roll my eyes at her. Then she turns to Harry.
“Babe it's okay. Neville wasn’t bothered about the way you look, so you shouldn’t have been either.” I hold his hand and kiss it gently.
“No Harry, stop. Stop apologising and stop saying you’re going to get rid of our home.” He squeezes me and pulls my head back to look at him.
“Here.” He hands me the glass of wine. Even the glasses are rich, probably crystal. I take a sip and it is light, crisp, and delicious. He leads me back into the living room where we were first.
Our three youngest come in from the kitchen then, to see their brothers and sister. There is Phoenix who is 10. We think he’s a gryffindor too. He has Draco’s hair and his grey eyes. Then there is Orion, who is 7 and obsessed with exploring. He’s definity a ravenclaw. Me and Draco have agreed on that since he was 2. He has my hair and Draco’s eyes. And then there is 3 year old Ophelia. Our little hufflepuff. She has my mother's ginger hair and Draco’s eyes. The twins look the spitting image of Leo with their blonde hair and green eyes. And Lily has my black hair but straight like Draco’s with my green eyes.
“I want to bite this lip.” he murmurs against my mouth, and carefully he tugs at it with his teeth. I moan, and he smiles.
I grab the bag from the chair and dash into the bathroom away from the unnerving proximity of naked Harry. He’s so fucking hot.
“Well, when you were nearly crushed by the whomping willow and I was on top of you and you were looking up at me, all ‘kiss me, kiss me, Harry’.” He shrugs. “I felt I owed you an apology, and a warning.” He adds as an afterthought. He runs his long fingers through his hair and I am struggling to breathe. “I’m not a hearts and flowers kind of guy, Draco. I don’t do romance. I have particular tastes and you should stay away from me.”
3 days later and tomorrow was Nia’s birthday. She was spending the day with me and Draco at the house, where we would surprise her with her room. Then Hermione and Ron and Neville were going to come over for a small meal. After that she was going out with her friends for drinks.
“Thanks.” I say and am unable to hide the sarcasm in that one word. “Goodbye Mr Potter.” With that I turn around and without giving him a second glance, I walk through the doors and disappear from view.
I blink at him momentarily, and then I turn over. He runs his hands from my shoulders, down my back, and onto my arse.
“I have one last present for everyone, but daddy has to open it.” He smirks at me and hands me an envelope.
“I also had cramping in my stomach.” Draco says quietly next to me. I look over to him and he clearly knows he should have told me that because he looks guilty.
“No need to ask them, I’m the one who made it.” He says and continues eating as if he hasn’t just dropped a bomb shell. I plop my spoon back into the soup and stare at him. He looks up and raises his eyebrow at me. “What? Do I have something on my face?”
“Her birthday is next month, we could surprise her?” I tell him. I’m so glad he’s on my side with this. We may not have known her for long but she feels like family.
“Draco please. I was just in shock.” He turns around again and is quietly hissing so nobody can overhear.
Harry’s softly spoken question haunts me. Shaking my head and endeavouring to quell my nerves, I decide on the plum-coloured shirt for this evening, with black jeans and a black tie to match. It’s demure and vaguely businesslike - after all, I am negotiating a contract.
“Yes, sir.” I say as I’m packing my things away. I look up and his eyes narrow. “Thank you for the interview Mr Potter.”
“No problem Andy, the more the merrier. Are you staying too? There’s plenty of food.” I ask her. She doesn’t get out much and should enjoy herself.
“Harry? Please tell me what’s wrong, is it Draco?” She asks quietly and I sob a bit louder at the use of his name out loud. She rubs my back soothingly and shushs me.
“He’s been tired constantly. Any magic is draining him. He’s eating weird things. And he’s still always throwing up.” I tell her for him but he just frowns at me.
Back in the bedroom, I put on my shirt, slip into my jeans, and climb into my shoes. I remove the braid from my hair and hastily cast a few spells to get it neat and tidy once more. Then I spot the drink he left me. It’s pale pink. What’s that? Cranberry and sparkling water. Hmm….it tastes delicious and quenches my thirst.
“Good! Hannah has officially applied for the patron job in Hogwarts! Poppy retired last year and we have been looking for someone to fill in. Hannah has just finished her healer training and has applied for the job.”
“Wednesday.” I agree. “I’ll see you out. If you give me a minute.” I sit up and grab my t-shirt, pushing him out of the way. Reluctantly, he gets up off the bed.
“No!” I say too quickly and my voice too high. He cocks his eyebrow at me. “.....not anymore.” I whisper and blush. I look down to avoid his intimidating eyes.
We worked together to get the floor fixed first. It was more difficult than we thought it would be and hence took longer than expecting. By the time we had finished it was almost lunch time, which meant it was nearly time to talk to Nia.
“It’s okay Harry, and I really am thrilled for you two. Congratulations.” We stay still for a minute just hugging while she cries on my shoulder. Then she pulls away and wipes her eyes and smiles at me. “Wow your going to be a father Harry!” She says and squeezes my cheeks. “You’ve been so good with our Teddy, I know you will do just as well with your own.” She pulls away and we go back into the sitting room.
“We were just in the back garden and all of a sudden he gripped me tight and then fainted.” I tell her and place Draco on the sofa. She starts casting diagnostic spells straight away. I go around to the side of the sofa and stroke his head, calming myself.
July 7th It’s been a month since we completed Nia’s loft, yet we still haven’t got far with the rest of the house. Since Nia’s room, we have only finished the master bedroom, the walk in cupboard, and one other bedroom. And we are yet to furnish anywhere else. By this rate, the baby will be here before we have a room for him. We need to finish the other 3 bedrooms, the laundry room, and the bathroom before we even think of furniture or wallpaper/paint. The outside looks a lot more presentable now. Neville is coming to finish the greenhouse with me today. Then it’s just the stables that need sorting but that can wait till last. As for all the fields and the old barn, where Nia lived, they will have to wait for when we are less hectic. I’ll get to them eventually but they aren’t my main concern as they are out of the way for now. That reminds me, the front of the house needs a new coat of paint and then weather and mould protection spells. As I’m coming downstairs, to get more cloths, I hear voices. “-have you got?” Draco asks but I only hear the end of whatever he asked. “There are probably about 100 overall. I’ve got this box and two more to go get, the rest are already in the greenhouse, then that's it. Just got to get them potted and placed.” Neville tells Draco. It surprises me that Draco isn’t hiding from him but this last month he has really taken to this pregnancy. I think last month really scared him with his low blood sugar, but we have seen Katie since and she said he is doing well keeping it under control. It’s still a risk but he’s doing well. “Wow, you’ll have to keep an eye on them. Make sure Harry doesn’t kill them off.” They both chuckle and I turn into the front room to see them. They are smiling and Draco has one hand on his baby bump and one hand on his back. They spot me then. “Speak of the devil.” Draco says and they both laugh again, which I join in with. “And I shall arrive.” I finish Draco’s saying and go and kiss him. “Hey Neville, do you want help with that?” I go over and take the box off him without waiting for a response. “Thanks Harry, I have 2 more boxes to get so I’ll be right back.” He says and goes back through the floo. “A hundred plants Harry? Really?” Draco raises his eyebrow at me but smirks. “Yep!” I say happily and walk towards the door. Draco follows me. “Why?” He asks. “Well some of them are pretty, some are things we will need, and some are for you. To carry on your potion inventions…..after you have given birth of course.” I tell him as he holds my shoulder for support coming down the porch steps. “Well… that was very nice of you.” He sniffs and points his chin up. “It’s why you love me.” I say winding him up a little, then kiss his cheek and put the box down outside the greenhouse. “Now you sit down in the greenhouse if you like, and I’m going to help Neville with the other boxes. I’ll be back in a tick.” He frowns a bit at that but I keep walking so he can’t start anything. Katie said his mood swings may come back and boy have they. The rest of the day is spent in the greenhouse with Neville and occasional Draco. We repot all the plants and place them in the best area. We have put a spell on the green house so that it is split into the 4 seasons of the year. One quarter is for winter plants, another is for autumn plants, another for summer, and the last for spring. Each plant has of course got it’s own temperature spell and self watering spell, but it’s best to keep the plants happy. Neville is just talking to me before he goes when Draco comes in to say goodbye. He looks a bit pale and clammy and I’m just about to tell him he should sit down. He starts to talk and then his eyes roll back and he falls to the ground. “Draco!” I shout and rush to him. He had fallen backwards onto the floor and I don’t know if he hit his head. “Merlin, is he okay Harry? Shall I call a mediwitch?” Neville asks, hovering over us. “Please Neville. Ask for healer Bell. Tell her to come now.” I tell him and try to wake Draco. A couple of minutes later, Katie arrives. By this time Draco’s head is resting on my lap and I’m stroking his hair. This is the only thing keeping me from panicking. “Harry what happened?” Katie asks and kneels down. I can’t talk and just keep shushing Draco while stroking his hair. “He just fainted. He came into the room, was about to talk, and his eyes just rolled back. Then he was on the floor. He may have hit his head.” Neville tells Katie, as they can both see I’m not going to talk anytime soon. “Okay. Harry, I’m going to do a couple of spells on Draco. I need to do one on his head, so I need you to put him down and move away.” Katie says slowly but I shake my head. “Harry, come on.” Neville says gently and pulls my arm up. I place Draco’s head on the floor softly and move away. As Katie is doing the spells I look away. I feel sick and I can feel my breath quickening. I place my hands on my knees and bend over. I try to slow my breathing but I won't be able to, not until I know he’s okay. There’s a buzzing in my ear now and can’t hear anything. “-okay. Harry? Can you hear me? I said Draco’s okay.” I stand up straight and turn to Draco and Katie. He’s sitting up and everyone is looking at me but I don’t give a damn. I rush over to him and fall to my knees next to him. I wrap myself around him and he does the same. “I’m okay, no need to get so worked up.” Draco says, half joking. I sniff into his neck and slap him lightly on the back. “The baby is fine too. I told you fainting could be a side effect. You obviously overdid it today and this was your body’s way of telling you to slow down and conserve your magic.” Katie tells Draco and gets up. “Now get some rest and I will see you both tomorrow.” “Thank you Katie.” I tell her and give her a smile. She nods and heads back through the floo.”I’ll leave you guys too. I’m sure I’ll see you soon” Neville says and gives a salute, then follows Katie through the floo. “Come on, let’s get you back to grimmauld.” Draco says to me and I frown at him confused. “I’m the one who should be putting you to bed, not the other way around.” I tell him and get up. “Yes but you just nearly had a panic attack and I’m clearly fine now.” He smirks and I help him up. “Whatever, let’s just get a chinese and go to bed.” He chuckles and we head for the floo. “How are you feeling after yesterday Draco?” Katie asks him as we walk into the examination room. “I’m totally fine thank you healer Bell, like I’ve told Harry 100 times over. It was like you said, I must have done too much yesterday.” Draco tells her, while sending me a glare and sitting on the bed. “How about you Harry? You okay?” She asks and looks at me. “Ermm..yeah I’m okay thanks Katie. I get panic attacks all the time.” I tell her with my head bent. “Yeah same. Who wouldn’t after what we’ve been through, right?” She smiles sadly at me and Draco and then starts writing things down. “So any other symptoms or side effects?” She asks Draco now, back to professionalism. “Other than fainting, I’ve felt nausea quite often but never actually been sick. I’ve definitely had clammy, pale and cold skin, sometimes all at the same time. My mood swings and craving are also back. Oh and I’ve been getting pains in the side of my stomach again, but you said they were normal so I’ve not worried.” He lists off. “Good, too much worrying is bad for chéri. Now at 24 weeks your baby is as big as a pomegranate. He’s still growing rapidly but is very comfortable for now.” She’s writing again and about to say something else when Draco interrupts. “Oh I’ve had nose bleeds as well.” He says thinking. Katie chuckles and nods. “Okay. Like I said, it’s all very common. Now, have you thought about a birth plan?” She looks from Draco to me then back again. We both have blank expressions though. “I’ll take that as a no. Things to decide are: where are you going to have the baby? At home or at st mungos? Do you want pain relief? If so, muggle or magical? Who do you want there? Also you need to keep in mind that we may have to operate if things start going wrong.” She stops writing then and looks at Draco. “With male pregnancies, we don’t like to do cesarean sections. Giving birth naturally really helps with the healing of your magic, and a cesarean can be quite dangerous. These are all things you need to think about Draco. Do you have any questions?” She looks at him and he shakes his head. She gets up suddenly then. “Good, let’s get on with the scan.” She smiles and Draco lies down. The rest of the scan proceeds as normal; we near the baby’s heartbeat, then we get to see him and get pictures to take home, then Katie does diagnostics. “Well everything seems fine. Remember to keep resting and I’ll see you in two weeks. If anything happens floo call me.” She says and opens the door for us. “Thank you healer Bell.” Draco says on his way out. “Thanks Katie.” I wink at her as I pass behind him. “Great, time to plan a baby shower with Hermione now.” Draco sulks at me on our way to the floo. “She’s probably already at Notre coeur by now.” “Well don’t ask for my opinion, I’ve got to get at least one of these 4 spare bedrooms finished today.” I shake my head. “You do realise one of those ‘spare bedrooms’ is going to be a nursery for our baby.” Draco says, using air quotations. “Yeah, I just don’t know which one yet.” Draco was right and Hermione was waiting for him when we got back. But what we didn’t expect was Nia. “Hey, you ready?” She asks me as soon as she sees us. “For…” I say, confused as hell. “For the meeting with mcgonagall…. you forgot didn’t you?” Shit yes. “No!” I tell her instead. “I’m ready when you are.” Draco snorts next to me and goes to join Hermione on the window seat. “Harry, you really need some furniture in here. These window seats are so uncomfortable.” Hermione says just as I’m heading back to the floo. “Yep, I’m on it Hermione.” I tell her, annoyed. The meeting with mcgonagall went great. Nia is learning quickly and improving everyday. She gave Nia more books and gave me a list of the next things that I need to teach her. We had a cup of tea with her and then off we went again. Hermione and Draco were on the front porch sitting on the steps. They each had a cup of tea which they must have got from Hermione’s house. I was just heading upstairs again to try get the bedroom sorted when Draco called me. “Harry? What do you think of this?” He shouted. I stopped and went back down the few stairs I had managed to climb. He’s telling me something but I can’t concentrate. This party stuff isn’t my thing. Then Hermione speaks. “Harry, you really should get at least a fridge for that kitchen. We couldn’t even make a cup of tea.” That's when I blow. “If you haven’t noticed Hermione, I’ve been sort of busy! What do you think I do all day? I’ve got a house to rebuild, decorate, and furnish, on my own! I've got a student who needs teaching magic from the beginning. I’ve got a 6 year old orphaned godson to keep up with. And if you haven’t noticed, I’ve got a very ill, very pregnant fiancé who fainted yesterday! So sorry if I haven’t had time to furnish to your liking yet!” I’m breathing fast and I stare at Hermione. She looks surprised and a bit upset. I cannot deal with another pregnant person crying today. I turn around and head upstairs. As I’m reaching the top I hear Nia. “I didn’t know you guys were engaged, congratulations.” Then I slam the door behind me. I was finishing my second bedroom of the day when Draco came to get me. I hadn’t even realised it had gone dark. “Hermione’s gone and Nia’s at work, are you ready to go?” He looks upset with me so I sigh and turn to him. “Draco, I’m really sorry for shouting. I-“ He cuts me off with a hand up and I think he’s about to start having a go but he surprises me. “Harry, it’s fine. I know how stressed you are, and it kills me everyday not being able to help you out more. Hermione has been nagging all day and it was about time someone told her off. She didn’t understand how much pressure you are under.” I get up and he hugs me. “I really do wish I could help, you know?” “I know love. But you just keep our baby safe and I’ll do the rest.” He smiles at me and we share a long sweet kiss. “Come on, it’s my bedtime.” Draco says and starts pulling me. The next morning Draco wakes me up with a blow job. I quickly return the favour and then lie down next to him again. “Happy anniversary.” Draco says, breathing hard. Shit! I forgot! Well I didn’t forget, and I got him a present, but I forgot what day it was today. “Happy anniversary!” I tell him and sit up. He pushes me back down and puts his arm over my chest to stop me getting back up. “Harry, relax. I don’t care if you forgot. Today you are having a break. We are not doing anything all day. We are going to stay in this house, watch tv, order pizza, and take a bath. Understood?” He tells me and strokes his belly at the same time, which makes the threat less demanding. “Okay then.” I breath out. So that’s all we do all day. We relax. First we had a bath together, so the day started off good. Then we had breakfast and watched tv with our feet up. Then we both did some reading for a bit. For lunch we warmed Mollys lasagne up and ate it in bed with the tv on in our room. After lunch we played a game of chess and then we both took a nap. By the time we woke up, it was tea time. We did as Draco said and ordered pizza. “What shall we do now?” I ask Draco about 20 minutes after finishing our pizzas’. “I want you to come to Notre coeur with me. Please? I have a surprise waiting for you.” He gets up and urges me to do the same. “Fine but this better not be a prank or I will have to destroy you.” I get up and give him a kiss. He snorts and leads me to the floo. When we get to the house, Draco takes my hand and leads me upstairs. “Dray, what are we doing here?” I whine to him. “Today was meant to be relaxing.” “Just trust me okay.” We get to the top of the stairs and he shoves me towards the master bedroom. “In there.” He points. I go to the door, open it and pause with one foot in. The whole bedroom is finished. It has been painted and wallpapered and furnished. I stand there gobsmacked. “What- how- what?!” I stutter out. My hand is still on the door knob and I’m completely frozen. “Happy anniversary babe.” He comes up behind me and puts his arms around my waist. Then he kisses my neck and places his chin on my shoulder. I can feel his belly on my back. “How?” I ask him. “Well after your outburst yesterday, Hermione gave me an idea. She said you need some help, so I spent the day talking to luna and Ginny and Fleur and George. I asked them for help and told them exactly what we wanted. They were more than happy to help.” I turn around and kiss him hard. “You are fucking amazing.” I tell him and turn back around to inspect. “I know.” He says. “We could live in here now if we wanted, but I’d rather wait till it’s finished if that’s okay.” I nod and go to see the bathroom. “Also, they said anytime you need help just ask.” He sits on the bed and watches me. “Draco, this is great and such a relief. Thank you so much.” I kiss him again and sit next to him. “What would I do without you eh?” I chuckle to him. “Die probably.” He laughs back. “Come on.” He gets up and grabs my hand. “I have one more surprise.” He takes me to the bedroom opposite the stairs, the closest to our room. He tilts his head in a way of telling me to go in. So I open the door and look in awe. This room which was nothing has now been transformed into a nursery for our baby boy. There’s a magical beasts’ theme and there are moving animals all over the walls. There is a white coat, a white changing table, a little white wardrobe and draws, and in the corner is an old looking white rocking chair which I recognise instantly, with the dragon heartbeat teddy on it. “Is that my mother's rocking chair? From Godric's hollow?” I ask him although I know the answer. I go over to it and run my fingers along the top. “Yeah, I asked Luna to go get it for us.” I have tears in my eyes now when I turn around to face him. “Draco… I… I don’t know what to say. This is so lovely and nice. Thank you so much.” I kiss him again and I put as much feeling into it as possible. “You’re welcome.” He says softly. He smiles back at me and is also crying now. “I didn’t forget about our anniversary by the way. I just forgot what day it was today. So, I have something for you to.” I go in my pocket and pull out the ring box. His eyes go wide and he gasps. “I wanna do it properly this time.” I get down on one knee and hold the box open to him. “Draco Malfoy, will you do me the honour of marrying me?” He’s crying more now and he nods enthusiastically. “Yes! Of course, yes!” I take the ring out and place it on his ring finger, then I get up and kiss him. He looks at the ring closer then and frowns a little. “Why is there a tiny diamond constellation?” He asks while still smiling and frowning. I won’t tell him the real reason right now, I'll save that one. “It’s my star sign. So I’m kinda always with you.” I smile goofily at him. He just laughs and kiss me. “I love it.” Then he gasps suddenly and his eyes shoot open. “What?!” I ask him panicked. He grabs my hand and places it on his stomach. I’m slightly confused and worried for a minute. Then I feel it, and I make the same reaction as Draco. “He’s kicking!” I say, amazed. “Yeah!” Draco say, also placing his hand on his stomach. “This is the best day ever.” I tell Draco and lean down to kiss his belly. “It really is.” He says stroking my hair. “Teddy is going to be so jealous he wasn’t here to feel it.” I say and we both laugh. “Merlin, I love you so much Draco. And you to chéri.” “I love you both too.” Draco says and pulls me up for another kiss. I really don’t know how I got so lucky.
“Damn, Ronald!” Blaise exclaimed as he entered the common room. “If I had known you’d clean up so well, I would have asked you instead of your sister. Your ass looks amazing.” His eyes swept over Ron, causing him to turn red.
“Absolutely,” Harry beamed at her when he saw that she was also wearing her jumper from Mrs. Weasley, pulling Draco to sit on the sofa nearest the tree.
Malfoy chuckled, but didn’t pull away. “And I think you want me to kiss you. You want me to do it so that you can pretend that you didn’t want it. But if you want me, you have to come to me.” He licked his lips, his tongue lightly touching Harry’s lip as he did. He started to pull away slowly, shrugging as he did, “Goodnight, Harry.”
“Yea,” he nodded between bites of food. “But Ron is going through auror academy and Hermione is attending the St. Mungos healers courses. They don’t have much time. Ginny comes over sometimes, but it’s weird and a bit awkward.”
Draco laughed and felt touched by the sentiment. “I’ll come see you first chance I have. I promise.” He hugged her just as tightly. “I don’t want to wake Greg since he works tonight, but will you tell him for me?”
After breakfast, Harry excused himself from Hermione. Not wanting to spend his entire Saturday in the library, he told her he was feeling a bit tired and was going back to his room. It was quiet when he entered the room and he didn’t see Malfoy, so he assumed he was alone. Stepping into the bedroom, he saw that his assumption had been wrong when he found Malfoy reading in bed.
Harry laughed in his face, “You’re quite mad, aren’t you.” He was cut off when Malfoy walked away from him. As his scent dissipated, Harry started to grow nauseous again. He started shaking his head again, fighting the urge to follow the alpha.
Draco’s cheeks heated a bit as he sat next to Harry. “It comes from my mother’s side of the family. Apparently, most of the Black’s either had curly or wavy hair. Mother’s hair is wavy when she doesn’t style it differently.” He looked at Harry and smiled softly, “And I’m sorry that your friend is cross with you, but I’m glad you’re here. Do you want some tea or anything before bed?”
They settled in and Draco put out the lights. They lay in the dark quietly for a few minutes, Draco waiting for his eyes to adjust to the moonlight filtering through the curtains. He was surprised to hear Harry chuckling again. “What’s giving you the giggles now?”
As he finally settled himself, Malfoy placed a tea tray on the table in front of the sofa and handed him a steaming mug of tea. “It’s nothing fancy,” he shrugged as Harry took the mug. “Just chamomile.”
“Didn’t play out quite how you thought, did it,” Malfoy smirked as Harry tried to steady himself. “Your face gives away all of your thoughts, darling. I knew what you were going to do before you did.” He slid his thumb under Harry’s bottom lip and grinned. “Feel free to keep attempting to surprise me.” He stepped back, giving Harry some much needed space. “So, do you want to make an appearance in the common room together now or wait to surprise everyone when they see us at breakfast together in the morning?”
“It’s not actually,” Harry retorted. “I thought I had made it clear that we were through. We just don’t work, Ginny.” He looked tired and had bruising around his eye and bottom lip. Draco wondered how many times he had already had to fight.
Narcissa smiled up at him, “It’s alright to be uncertain. There have been so many dark times and I just want to see you happy.”
Harry tried to wrestle his pillow away while trying to squirm out from under Draco. “Shove off, you pratt,” Harry groaned.
The second half of class was for Muggle sports and self defense. Dean Thomas was ridiculously excited to share his love of football with his classmates, but Draco loved the self defense portion of class. Two class periods a week, they were paired up and taught how to defend themselves from physical attacks. “The Muggle world is a dangerous place. Muggles don’t have magic, but they have weapons. You need to know how to defend yourselves without magic as well as with it,” Professor Williams had said.
Harry hadn’t thought this far ahead because he thought Malfoy would flat out say no. “Erm… What do you want?”
Draco shook his head and leaned close so that his head was brushing Harry’s, “It’s her younger sister. Daphne’s probably mad on her behalf. They’re lovely girls, but I’m not interested.”
“I guess I can clean you up again if you get too dusty,” Draco said as he went back to stripping the linens from the bed.
Harry just rolled his eyes, sighing dramatically as he entered the Potions classroom. Hermione gave him a questioning look as he sat next to Draco. Ron looked at their joined hands and laughed, gaining himself a glare from Harry. “At least I’ve gained a good potions partner,” Harry muttered, trying to be positive.
After a quick breakfast, Draco suggested they head to the kitchen before going to Hagrid’s. Harry agreed that it made more sense to bring Hagrid cakes the elves had made instead of having to turn down his own cooking. The elves happily obliged and packed a large basket full of tea cakes, biscuits, and other sweets.
“Alright,” Harry sighed. “What if we make it a bet? You ask someone and if they say no, I’ll play one match.”
“I knew it,” Ron said as he stared at the two of them. “You could have told me. I thought I was your best mate. How long has this been going on?” He pointed his finger, gesturing dramatically between the two of them.
“Because I’m your boyfriend and you are deeply in like with me,” Malfoy grinned, once again reminding Harry of a wolf.
Malfoy nodded, “I think that’s reasonable. I agree.” He leaned in quickly and pressed his lips to Harry’s, wrapping his hand around the back of Harry’s neck to hold him in place.
“I kind of wish someone had taught me,” Draco mumbled. “Or Pansy. She could definitely use a cooking lesson.”
On the rare occasion they could afford something else, it was because Greg had bought it. He had a job as a bouncer at a Muggle club and was paid well for it, or at least compared to Pansy and Draco. He took on the lion’s share of the rent also, never complaining when one of the others was short.
Draco groaned and captured his lips, claiming him in a possessive kiss. Harry moaned into his mouth as he nipped and sucked on his bottom lip, his hand trailing up Harry’s chest. He pulled away long enough to pull both of their shirts off, throwing them behind him, before trailing kisses across Harry’s chest.
Harry worried about keeping the food trays full, but Kreacher and Winky worked together to keep the food and drinks flowing. As he entered the kitchen to check on the elves, Molly finally caught him. “Harry, dear,” she started. “This is all lovely, but I do wish you had let me help.”
“I can try,” Draco surprised himself. He didn’t think to actually say it out loud, but now that he had, it seemed like a good idea.
“You have to go through the bedroom to get to the loo,” Malfoy said without looking up from the book in his lap. “It’s small, but the water pressure is good.”
“It’s relatively new and we didn’t want the focus to be on us today,” Harry shrugged. “I think it’s close to time for Hermione’s cake. I think the garden has the most space so everyone can see it.”
“I was happy to hold you and let you sleep,” Draco spoke softly as he started to play with Harry’s hair again.
They walked slowly, hand in hand, looking at the various items. Draco seemed less interested in these things than he had been in some of the other shops. He did poke at an old wind up kitten a couple of times, seemingly disappointed when it didn’t work. When they neared the back of the shop, Harry saw a jewelry case. Several of the items were obviously old, but most were in good condition. “I’m going to look here for a moment,” Harry said as Draco went to look at yet another potential tea set for his mother.
Draco had gotten and been fired from several jobs. Apparently he was unpleasant and hard to work with. Pansy found this to be absolutely hilarious. He was currently looking for another job and had even considered looking in Diagon alley. They didn’t have to stick to Muggle London, after all. It was just easier because they had all grown tired of the whispers and stares. He could have gone to France with Blaise, but when Blaise had made his intentions clear about their relationship Draco had declined. And unfortunately, the ministry still had all of his accounts frozen so he couldn’t afford to go alone.
“Yea,” Harry agreed as he bounded out of bed. “I wasn’t paying attention to the time. I think we missed lunch.”
“Then that’s what we’ll do.” Draco pulled Harry close, tucking him in against his side. “Honestly, I’m happy just spending time with you and I want to enjoy it as much as possible since we won’t have as much time when we’re back at school.”
“Sorry, Myrtle,” Harry muttered. “I can’t stay.” He said ‘open’ in Parseltongue and nearly collapsed in relief as the tap moved into the floor, revealing the tunnel to the Chamber of Secrets. He quickly slid into the tunnel, hoping it closed before anyone could follow him.
-----------------------Here is where you should stop reading if you don't want to read about Draco throwing Harry a bone---------------------
Harry squirmed and writhed, gripping onto his shoulders and crying out when Malfoy brushed against his prostate. His prick bobbed between them, trailing precum against his stomach. Malfoy gripped his hips and angled them up brushing his prostate again, grinning as Harry’s cum arched between them.
I must make a noise then because he cuts off all of a sudden and turns around to face me. His face is covered in tears and he looks shocked to find someone else here. I stand up straight immediately and look confused at him. He turns around to wipe his face discreetly.
“Good evening Harry, I’m very well thank you. And thank you for leaving my son with me today, it's been lovely.” She smirks at me.
“I...i don’t know what to say, Draco.” I feel shitty for not comforting him but I am honestly in shock. How did this happen if he didn’t take anything? We aren’t ready for this. We can’t handle a baby. We haven’t even started on the house.
“I think I should have just joined you in getting plastered and dancing in your underwear.” He shrieked with laughter and then added, “would have been much more entertaining.”
“Babe, it’s going to be fine. There’s a potion for you and you're just gonna have to take things easy love.” I tell him and stroke his hair.
“It’s my fault. I did too much and now our baby is in danger.” He says between crying and trying to breath.
The blonde guy at the desk gets up suddenly and approaches. He was on the phone when I arrived and so he looked me up and down and asks, “Mr Malfoy?”.
“Dray? Your aunt and Teddy are here, can we come in?” He doesn’t answer and I frown. He was wide awake 20 minutes ago. I open the door and peak through, but Draco isn’t in the bed. Then I hear it.
After another half an hour practising things and teaching, I declare a break. We go inside to find Draco and Teddy so we can go to lunch at Whipped. Nia has cut down her hours working at Whipped and is just working lates now so she can learn magic in the day. She says she doesn’t mind and it’s keeping her busy, but I hope it doesn’t get too much for her.
“I’m good actually, thanks for asking. Nah she’s a ravenclaw.” He throws a pillow at her and she laughs harder.
“I liked what happened in the elevator.” I murmur as he takes my hand again and we head up the stairs. I think I hear a small gasp but can't be sure and so head the rest of the way in silence.
“I can’t do this anymore.” He cries quietly to me. I can feel the tears and sweat run down my neck. “Harry do something.” He sobs.
“Draco, there's something about him.” She says in warning. “He’s gorgeous, I totally agree, but I think he’s dangerous. Especially for someone like you.”
“Oh…..please.” I beg, and I pull my head back, my mouth open as I groan, my legs stiffening. Holy fuck.
“I wanted to do something nice for you for once.” He says and lines his hips up with mine. He obviously wants to top tonight and I am fine with that. It isn’t often Draco prefers to top but when he does the sex is always great.
We get to the front door, that still needs fixing properly, and see that Nia has written on the back on the note I left her. It says ‘meet you here at 4.’ I’m glad she was okay and is willing to speak to us.
“Tell me about Theo the overuser.” I ask when I’ve stopped laughing. Oh, I can feel myself relaxing for the first time since I was in line at the bar….before the phone call that started all this - when I was admiring Mr Potter from afar. Happy, uncomplicated days.
I promised Andromeda I would babysit Teddy for a couple of hours while she got the house cleaned and did some shopping.
“Can’t mate, still got to unpack and my mum wants us over for tea. You and Draco are welcome to join too.” Ron says and grabs the bag of cat things.
He looked around the forest, which proved to be a bad idea because he started thinking of all the bad things that had happened to him in this very forest. The pressure of the past week and the memories that surfaced in the familiar surroundings were a bit too much for him and he soon regretted the fact that he was currently all alone. Tears formed in his eyes and he found himself struggling to get to his feet as his surroundings grew darker.
A strong hand stopped him before he could turn away. “I want to see you,” Malfoy said, his voice having gotten deeper and raspy. He laid him on his back and pressed between his legs. “Has your slick started leaking yet?” he asked as he pressed a finger against Harry’s asshole.
Harry pulled on his winter cloak and was grabbing his scarf when a gentle knock sounded on his door. “Come in, Hermione.”
“You figured it out, didn’t you?” he rolled his eyes. “We’re all here now. Nice, nice, nice. Friendly, blah, blah, blah.”
“Yes, I’m aware,” Malfoy smirked. “But you like it.” He leaned close to Harry’s ear and whispered, “Or at least you liked it when we were alone.” Harry blushed furiously, drawing an odd look from Ron and adding to the rumor mill that had already started.
“Yes,” he huffed in response. “I’ve noticed. In case you haven’t noticed, my trunk isn’t here which means that I have no clothing.”
Draco pulled Harry onto the dance floor, dipping him quickly and making him laugh. They soon lost track of time as they enjoyed the music, dancing together and with their friends. Harry danced mostly with Draco, but a few times with Hermione and Pansy, and several times just all of them in a big circle. It was the most fun he’d had in a very long time.
“Yes, unfortunately,” Hermione agreed, her eyes going wide and causing Malfoy to chuckle. She was about to say something else when several Slytherins walked over.
“Yea, I’d like that,” Harry agreed before leaning forward and kissing him again briefly. Draco tried to grab him again, but he jumped out of the bed before he could catch him, laughing. “Come on and get dressed. We don’t want to keep your mother waiting. It is Christmas Eve after all.”
Harry let Draco hold him, pressing his face into his chest and breathing in his scent. As he listened to the soothing words he realised that being Draco’s boyfriend forever might not be such a bad thing after all.
“Just because you’re a beta, doesn’t mean you’re not a good catch, Granger,” Draco scoffed. “Don’t kill him for going in, but don’t let him off too easily.”
Potter moved just enough to call his bluff. He pulled a second pillow out from under his head and flipped the blanket down on the empty side of his full bed. “You think you’re clever do you?” Draco muttered. He pulled his cloak off and placed it on Potter’s trunk before kicking his shoes off and climbing over Potter to lay next to him. Potter just stared at him for a moment, eyes wide with shock. “So why are you hiding out here? I mean, your bed is alright, but not the best. If you’re hiding from your chatty friends then I completely understand.”
Draco gripped his ass cheeks and spread them farther apart so that he could get deeper. Using his ass as leverage, he fucked him as hard as he could, groaning as he grew closer to cumming. He reached a hand around to grip Harry’s prick and started pumping, quickly pulling a second orgasm from him. “Can I cum in you or on your ass?”
Just after Halloween, the professor allowed the students with the highest scores in her class and good grades in their other courses to join a dueling club. It was better than Draco had expected. She taught them basic sword techniques and said they’d be learning how to spar with a partner. The goal was to be able to display basic sword techniques for the class before the Yule ball. Draco loved the lessons and soaked them up like a sponge. Potter was, of course, right beside him. They had always been evenly matched in quidditch and this was no different. They were both quickly surpassing their classmates and only seemed to be in competition with each other, as usual.
“I’m honestly not sure,” Harry answered. “He was helping me with my schoolwork and our friendship turned into something more.”
“I told you I want to be alone,” Potter mumbled from his bed, his voice muffled. His back was to the door and Draco assumed that he had a pillow against his head.
“You did have an alpha,” Malfoy said, his voice sounding a little dangerous. “I’ve known you were mine since I presented alpha. I know everyone thinks you’re oblivious, but even you had to notice that I’ve been keeping a closer proximity to you than usual.”
“You’re not wrong,” Draco agreed. “Alright, then. I accept your offer.” He stood and followed Harry to his room. He pretended to ignore Harry’s glances as he stripped to his boxers and climbed into bed. When Harry crawled in next to him, he acted on impulse and pulled him closer, cuddling up against his back. “Is this alright?”
“It’s ok,” Harry whispered. He was still for a moment before turning over to face Draco. “I think this is better though,” he gave him a little shove so that Draco was on his back. Resting his head on his shoulder, he laid his arm across his chest.
“I don’t particularly care what you want, Potter,” Draco stated as he moved to stand next to the bed.
Harry wanted to punch him in his smug face, but instead he rolled his eyes and headed to the room he shared with Ron. He held the door for Malfoy, shutting it and locking it behind him. He cast a quick Silencing spell before sitting on his trunk. Motioning to his desk, he said, “Have a seat if you’d like.”
“Draco,” his mother called from the other side of the door, effectively cooling his emotions. “Are you and your friend decent? We have things to discuss.”
Harry hated that he was right. He hated that he was in his bed. And he hated that he looked good in his bed. He turned away before he gave in to the weird impulse he was feeling to climb back into the bed with him. Why would he want to be in bed with Malfoy? Wait… “Did you make it a condition that I have to be attracted to you?”
“If you leave it to me, I’ll have you there tonight so we can start first thing in the morning,” Potter chuckled.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Staying here isn’t a good idea. If something went wrong, someone could get hurt. If we’re at the manor, your mother and the elves could help if a spell misfires. It’s a good idea. She won’t mind if I’m there for Christmas?”
Just as they were finishing up, Seamus and Dean stopped behind Harry. “So it’s true then,” Seamus spoke quickly. “You two are actually an item? It’s about damn time,” he laughed.
“I’m ready,” Harry said softly and started to remove his clothing. He blushed as Draco took in his naked body for a moment before taking off his own clothing. Kneeling under the tree, he presented himself to his alpha.
“You’d best worry about a date to the Yule Ball first,” Harry called back as he shut the door behind him.
When the grandfather clock in the hall chimed midnight, Draco suggested they get ready for bed. They had made more progress than expected and were both visibly tired. Draco was completely dreading the climb up the stairs and decided he liked the idea of single story houses. He let Harry use his bathroom first while a house elf moved his belongings to Draco’s room. Bixby discreetly expanded one of Draco’s dressers and put Harry's things away before popping out of the room.
Malfoy just smirked at him. “It’s more fun to watch you squirm. And besides, you didn’t seem to be complaining while we were kissing.” He grinned, reminding Harry of pictures he had seen of wolves snarling. “A happy couple should be reasonably affectionate, don’t you think, Harry?” He cupped Harry's face with his hand and ran his thumb along his jaw.
Later that evening, Draco’s arms felt like they might fall off. He flopped onto his bed, staring at the bed hangings.
Draco chuckled, half in relief and half in excitement, “She’ll be thrilled that she has a reason to put together a proper Christmas dinner. I’ll send her an owl to let her know.”
When Astoria grew ill, Harry frequently took Scorpius and brought over meals. He gave direction to the house elves so that things were looked after without disturbing the mistress. He never said a word, just did what needed to be done. Draco was eternally grateful.
After arriving at the manor, they had tea with Narcissa before getting settled in. She seemed to like Harry well enough and proved that Draco was right by talking about her plans for a large dinner. When she left them to see to dinner preparations for that evening, Draco took Harry up to show him where he would be sleeping.
“Nothing wrong with being a book dragon, Granger,” he added as he sat across from Ron making him chuckle.
“I need to learn to be more specific,” Harry said as he removed his glasses and massaged the bridge of his nose. “Fine, yea. Whatever.” He started walking again, shaking his head as his hand was grabbed and held in a firm grip. “Not so tight. I’m not your prisoner, you know.”
When the music finally died down and everyone started to filter out, they snuck to the kitchens for snacks before heading back to the common room. Hermione didn’t complain about Greg sweeping her into his arms and carrying her this time. Her shoes were in her hand and she just melted against him. Harry couldn’t blame her. If Draco had tried to carry him, he would have let him.
Potter laughed and shook his head, “I’m just happy to have someone here to eat some of it. I can’t seem to figure out how to cook for just me. There’s always leftovers.”
As they descended the stairs, Potter said over his shoulder, “You’re welcome to pick any room you like. They all need about the same amount of work with the exception of the master bedroom. If I had known for certain you’d take the job, I would have cleaned one out for you.”
“Oh, ok. Good,” she said softly. “I wanted to ask you if we should invite Harry’s family to dinner tomorrow. I know he’s close with the Weasley family, but he didn’t say anything about the Muggles that raised him.”
“Don’t start with me, Potter,” Malfoy sighed. When Harry shoved him again, he grabbed his hands. “I thought you were tired.”
“Oh, I guarantee that they have,” Malfoy laughed. “The Patil twins and that Lavender girl saw us come in here. The entire school probably knows by now.” He grabbed Harry’s hand, lacing their fingers together, “Come along, my darling. I suppose I should make nice with your friends,” he shuttered dramatically as he said this. “It’s still a bit early in the evening to hide anyways.”
“I don’t particularly care for it,” Potter said as he stepped next to Draco. “Sirius’ mother blasted people off of the family tree for disappointing her. Sirius for running away, your mother’s sister for marrying a Muggleborn. Sirius tried removing it, but it’s stuck.” Harry ran a hand through his hair causing it to stick up further. “Her portrait is in the hall with a permanent sticking charm. It took ages, but we finally figured out a way around it. Hermione used a permanent sticking charm to put another portrait over hers,” he chuckled. “Now she’s stuck behind Phineas Nigellus.”
They had kept in touch through owl posts after Harry had spoken at his trials. Exchanging simple greetings and well wishes. Congratulations on nuptials and the births of their children. Birthday greetings and the like. The letters had caused them to form a timid friendship and with time they began to divulge more about their daily lives, likes and dislikes, opinions on the Ministry staff and the political climate. Their timid friendship grew stronger and they started actually meeting. Sometimes to let the children play, sometimes just for a pint. Short visits turned into weekend camping trips and planned holidays, much to the dismay of a certain weasel.
“I know, darling, but you were so concerned about the bad press,” Malfoy crooned, ruffling Harry’s hair. He looked at Hermione, “We talked about it and decided it was time. Besides with all these offers Harry keeps getting for the Yule ball, I was going quite mad. You know how my temper can be.”
“Completely understandable,” Draco agreed. He stood and stretched, yawning as he did. “Do you mind sharing the bed or would you prefer the sofa?”
If you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for sticking around. This is officially my longest fic and I hope it didn't get to rushed towards the end because I wanted to get it finished. I have a bad habit of starting fics and leaving them in the wip pile. Thank you all for the lovely comments and kudos. They mean more than you know.
“Good,” Draco scoffed. “I’m bloody great.” He gave Harry a look that made him wonder if he was still talking about potions.
“I already know you’re an ass so I doubt that would mess us up,” Harry grinned. He went quiet for a minute before saying, “I honestly don’t why I want to learn this. At first, with just the sword play, it was to be better than you,” he chuckled. “Then when I cast a spell, it was just so awesome that I wanted to learn more. Now, I’m not so sure. I like doing it, but I feel like it’s becoming an obsession instead of a hobby.”
He stepped into Draco’s arms without hesitation. “Thank you,” he mumbled against his chest. “I suppose I should get in the shower,” he said as he pulled away. “I forgot my shirt in here.”
“Mum,” Ron rolled his eyes. He still seemed cross at Harry and was being a bit rude to everyone, his parents included. “They have house elves.”
“I don’t want to go out with a fan, Ron,” Harry shook his head. “They only like me because I’m in the papers.”
Since Harry didn’t react to Pansy or Neville when he finally presented as omega, Hermione said he might be a beta like she was. Ron and Pansy(who was now a permanent fixture on Ron’s arm) were concerned he might be omega.
“Well, yea,” Potter shrugged. He looked at Draco like the answer was obvious. “Ron’s not in dueling because his grades aren’t high enough. Hermione thinks it’s silly to waste time on swordplay when I could be studying instead. You’re the only one of my friends that’s good enough to help me figure this out.”
When potions was over, Draco insisted on holding Harry’s hand and walking him to his next class. Harry was going to argue with him about it until he saw a Slytherin girl glaring at them. “Is she the reason for this?” he whispered.
When Ron woke the next morning, he decided to leave Harry to sleep. It wasn’t often that he slept late and he didn’t want to disturb him. He dressed quickly and went to the common room, hoping to catch Hermione before breakfast. He found her sitting with Pansy, his cheeks heating when the Slytherin girl beamed up at him.
“Oh, good,” Harry muttered as he leaned forward to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he whispered against Draco’s skin. “I don’t know if I’m quite ready for that yet.”
As the silence fell around them again, Malfoy rolled his eyes and stood abruptly. “This is awkward as hell.” Harry and Hermione looked at him and at each other and started laughing.
“Think of the worst thing you’ve ever eaten and then burn it,” Draco said, watching as Potter turned the chicken. He had something in a different pot and another smaller one was simmering away also. It smelled divine.
Draco reached over his shoulder to push the door open and then followed him in. “Do you want a chair or do you want to sit on the bed?” he asked as he rummaged in his trunk for his radio.
The evening was relatively quiet and uneventful. They spent time in the common room with Hermione and Pansy, Harry spoke to Ron even though he kept giving them odd looks. After everyone had settled into bed for the night, Harry was unsurprised when Draco slipped into his bed again.
“Yea,” Potter shrugged. “I had to learn when I was younger. My aunt insisted,” he added with a bitter tone.
“Yes,” Harry moaned, not ready for him to stop. His finger slipped into the tight ring of muscle just as he sucked one of Harry’s balls into his mouth. He turned his attention back the his shaft as he slowly pumped his finger in and out. He soon added another finger, slowly working them into Harry and scissoring them to stretch him further. Harry cried out, about to cum when Draco stopped sucking and pulled away from his prick. He groaned in frustration and flexed his hips trying to gain friction. Draco added a third finger, causing Harry to moan and whine as cum leaked from his prick.
Harry scowled up at him, an idea forming in his mind. He reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s shirt, pulling him in quickly and pressing their lips together again. He was surprised when instead of being shoved away, he was pulled closer. A hand landed on his hip, holding him in place while Malfoy kissed him aggressively. He pulled away suddenly, leaving Harry panting for breath and swaying slightly.
“I don’t think so,” Harry shook his head. He was struggling to stay upright. His limbs were growing heavier and he felt nauseous. His back hit the corridor wall just as the most delicious scent washed over him. He instantly felt better. The nausea went away, he didn’t feel so tired. He looked at Malfoy, shaking his head as he realized that the amazing scent was coming from him.
Harry pulled at his tie as he paced the parlour. He stopped at the tables that were set up and adjusted the food trays before resuming his pacing. When he had done this around five times, strong hands gripped his shoulders, spinning him around.
I know I’m meant to say yes, but I don't trust him. Before I can answer, however, he’s on his feet and holding his hand out to me. I place my hand in his, and I can feel my cock responding to his dark, hungry gaze.
I grab my clothes from yesterday, the ones still remaining anyway, and shrink them and put them in my pocket. I find my jacket back in the main room and find a bobble to tie my hair up in a bun with. Harry is watching me as I tie it up, his eyes following me while he is on the phone. I don’t listen to his conversation, I couldn’t understand it even if I did, and instead flick through my phone waiting.
“As you wish, Mr Malfoy,” he says, his face impassive. “I’ll escort you to the lobby.” He holds out his hand.
Pansy’s phone rings. It’s Theo. pansy winks at me and skips off to her bedroom like she’s fourteen. I know that she should be writing her valedictorian speech, but it seems Theo is more important. What is it about the Potter men? What is it that makes them totally distracting, all-consuming, and irresistible? I take another slug of wine.
“Oh, my apologies Draco. May I just look at your ear though?” She darts around Ginny and gets a good look before Ginny hauls her away again. “Aww just 3 more days Draco and your baby is going to arrive.” She says happily and sits on Ginny's knee on the bed.
“Draco, there’s a package for you?” She passes it to me as I shut the door. It's wrapped in brown packaging and has no return address or name. Maybe it's from my mum, or Severus.
I’ve been a bit down when I haven’t been keeping busy at work. And when I’m working I’m usually angry and end up shouting at someone. Ron has been trying to cheer me up and has been taking me out nearly every night with Hermione, but I just end up zoning out and then all of a sudden I’m in bed crying again.
“Don’t worry Harry, I can help. I’m pretty sure grimmauld looked worse.” We both laugh at that and head inside.
I walked back out the door and looked around for Draco, hoping he’d not apparated off. Thankfully I found him sat on the grass under the tree that I had found so adorable in the pictures. I walked over to him slowly to give him a chance to notice me, and sat down next to him.
“Then what the hell Draco?!” I hadn’t even realised I’d stepped outside until I could feel the rain on my shirtless body.
“Yes. When I used to...run away, in the holidays. When my father was being a dick.” I blurt out. Then quickly change tactics. “Tell me about your parents.”
“Yeah about that, guess the secrets out now. How do you feel?” I run my fingers through his hair and he hugs into me further.
I feel like going back to sleep, I am so tired, but instead think about everything he just said. If you were mine. But I’m not his because he made it clear he doesn’t want me. What I would do to be his though? He is the first guy to ever set my blood racing. But he is so antagonising; he is difficult, complicated, and confusing. One minute he basically tells me to leave him alone, next minute he is sending me ridiculously expensive first edition books and tracking me like a stalker! But without him I don’t know what would have happened last night, and despite him, I feel safe and protected. He cares enough about me to come and rescue me from some mistakenly perceived danger. I don’t know why he said he’s a dark knight, he is most definitely not. He is a white knight in shining armour — like in the classic romances, Sir Gawain or Sir Lancelot.
The Submissive will ensure he achieves a minimum of seven hours’ sleep a night when he is not with the Dominant.
Two days later, me and Draco arrived at Andromeda's to pick Teddy up. We are going to take him to the park for an hour while Andy sets the party up. Me and Draco are the distraction. I really can't wait to see Teddy’s face when everyone yells surprise. I bet he’ll be so excited.
“You asked everyone else before me! And then you did that bit about you only trust me! Why?” I ask her a bit hurt by it now. Did she really not trust me with looking after a cat? What about when they had children? Would she not ask me to look after them either.
“Mr Potter.” I whisper. That’s all my brain can manage and I’m still staring. There’s a ghost of a smile on his lips and his eyes are alight with humour, as if he’s enjoying a private joke.
“You don’t have to come up with excuses Draco, if you don’t want to do this anymore then just tell me? I know it's been awkward and daunting and-“
“Healer Bell gave me a potion to calm the morning sickness down a bit, but I left it in my bathroom at the manor. Could-“
