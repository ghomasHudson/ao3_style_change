“Just come,” said Rosier, pleading. “I wanna tell you something, as well.”
“We do, however, have a very suspicious set of circumstances here,” said Professor Snape, his upper lip curling. “Why were they in the upstairs corridor at all? Why weren’t they at the Hallowe’en Feast?”
“I have a couple of brooms in the back, but I’m not sure where…”
I need to start moving.
“A horcrux,” Hermione utters, “I've never heard of one before.”
? Where is everyone?”
The streets of Hogsmeade are entirely empty, there’s not a soul to be seen. There are only blacked-out buildings, bathed in an ominous green light.
“Oh Sirius,” I mutter, almost fondly. There's always a stack of magazines in the corner of the top drawer that I avoid. They’re, well… they're men. The brunet on top winks at me with his usual shamelessness and I shudder just a bit. For the first time I actually push past my discomfort and shove that one out of the way. The blonde on the next cover simply runs his hands through his hair pompously, never looking once at me. I hold onto for a minute, transfixed by his expression, then toss it to the side with urgency. In fact I toss the whole stack aside. This is the only inch of this room I've never seen.
“I don't get it. We spent the summer here, you two down this very hallway. How could we not have seem -- or noticed,” Potter trails off. I look up to find him uncomfortably close, dark hair inches from my nose as he leans over Granger’s shoulder.
Malfoy’s nose rises impossibly higher, but his expression seems all too forced. He’s cracking.
Molly nods, still not looking at Ron, Hermione, or I, and the group disperses into the Burrow. I turn my back to them, kneeling next to Malfoy’s limp body. Charlie whispers, “I hope you know what you're doing.
Remus hunches over Hagrid’s unconscious figure, a deep red, web-like net of spells spilling from his wand. “We were attacked. I'm not sure how they found us. Someone must have told them we’d be moving Harry.”
“Do it, Draco. Kill him!”
“No,” Malfoy says, nudging the other man’s head with his ratty shoe. “They must be ministry.”
“And how –” I rise to throw a curse at the same time as Hermione, “am I supposed to trust that you won’t curse us dead!?”
Tonks herself limps forward, a hand held to the cut running down the side of her eye, “We landed and ran into a little pub and apparated from there, all the brooms left behind and… Mad Eye.”
Overcome by a rage bubbling up in my chest I pull my arm from his grip, bringing it back and then swinging it forward with enough force to have Remus stumbling backwards and falling off his feet when it hits him. He falls back dazedly, dust devils swirling around him. His delirious gaze narrows in, making him look dangerous and ready to snap, like an unpulled trigger, and for a moment the fog splits and I can see right through it.
I can barely catch my breath coming down the endless, winding, wooden staircase for the third time today, but the physical exertion- the burning lungs and tight calves- feels, almost, good. Though I would prefer anything to how I'm feeling emotionally: ashamed, angry, scared, melancholy, anxious, and paranoid all at once.
The neighing of a thestral signals me from behind and my head whips around to recognize the scarred man and shaken witch instantly as they land on the edge of the bog. The creature raises up on its hind legs, bucking wildly as the two hold on for dear life. It’d be barely visible in the black of night if not for the moonlight that reflects off its leathery back.
“You know that’s not what I meant, Ginny. It’s just… he knows things, okay? Stuff about You-Know-Who that no one else on our side knows. Things that will help us find him. We need all the help we can get.”
“R.A.B. Who's R.A.B.?”
this was going to happen?”
“Harry,” Molly whispers. Ron puts a hand on her arm, keeping her up.
“Yes it is, Harry. Rosmerta we need transport back to the castle.”
“What do we do with Tweedledee and Tweedledum here?” I ask to no one in particular.
, and another soul for the Dementors; but
, but Harry’d never forgive her if he died before speaking up. For some reason he really believed that Malfoy was worth the trouble. Maybe she'd better put a little faith in him. He'd had enough trouble as is, right?
My hand flies to my- no not mine- a Weasley’s red hair this time. “Oh, yes. Distant cousin. Go by the name of Timothy.” I descend the stairs as slowly and calmly as I can with my heart beating out of my chest. Instinctively I reach out an arm to shake, ramrod straight, and grasp the Minister’s hand.
I can tell she’s trying to look stern and intimidating but she can't mask her look of panic, not from a Malfoy. It takes a great effort to hold back my lashing tongue. I don't remember the address she states the second after she says it, but I know it's muggle and that Granger’s been here as a child, though it doesn't make a difference. The hand finds its way around my arm again as the three quickly move along threatening to leave me behind in the dust.
“I was

“Grimmauld Place,” he states, voice trembling. I can’t tell if it's out of anger or fear. “You mean to tell me that all this time Black used a Fidelius charm to hide Grimmauld place and use it for… I–”
“Mundungus happened,” Remus spits.
Hope you liked this, please leave a kudos and a comment if you did. Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
“Well, Potter? Do you accept the challenge?” Draco smirked at him, arms crossed, daring him to back down with every line of his body.
His eyes look panicked, pupils dilated, but they gloss over in seconds. I bend over, trying to keep my pace, but I can feel myself losing it, “What did you tell her that you won't tell me?” I say, my top lip curling in a disparaging sneer. I'm met with stark silence. Blood pulses erratically through my veins.
Charlie and Neville fly into view, stepping off their broom down on the farther end of the bog. My heart stops for a moment before speeding up to Firebolt speed.
lovely.
Malfoy’s eyes look glossy.
try to run off one time or another. Don't.” I scowl.
Hermione takes the locket into her hands, “This is is the Slytherin locket. It has the emblem.”
Ron must have yielded the couch to Hermione and lay now directly beneath her, so close they're almost touching. Her hand hangs off the side, brushing his fingers with every breath, and I despise them for it. Ron’s hair is bright, so fiery, so reminiscent, and yet she's too far. And they're too close. I'm so cold.
“Help? You wouldn't help me if the world was ending.” I grab the waitress by the shirt collar and lean her up against the counter.
My fingers brush over the racy posters spelled to the walls. As I make my way down the wall, above the dresser, I trace the faces of a single photo of Sirius, Remus, Dad, and Pettigrew. It's a non-magical photo; the four sit lifelessly. I make my usual route around, peeking into Sirius’ closets and wardrobes for Howards memorabilia like he let me first do when I was only fifteen. There's a few band shirts and quidditch slips in the first closet, sweatshirts, robes, and leather jackets in the second. Nothing new. The chest is, as I already know, nothing but dirty magazines that would make walburga howl, and the usual underwear and socks, but I look inside regardless. I can't seem to help myself.
I know she's right. It's not even a deep down gut type of feeling, it's common sense that I could scrape from the brim of my mind. Simply, I just don't want her to be.
I bend down beside the boy and grab his chin, looking into his lidded eyes defiantly.
From where my head is turned I can see Dumbledore’s wand fly from his hand.
“Harry!” The girl shoves the both of them aside, placing a hand on Potter’s heaving chest. The sound of her cries grate at my ear drums. “I'm not letting you do this to yourself! When we deal with
Ginny smiles placidly and repeats the words I've heard all too well before, “I really do hope you know what you're doing, Harry,” and walks away.
A fresh surge of pain blooms under the skin the hand once held and I hiss at the sensation, “And what was that!”
Hermione orders a cappuccino while I decline a drink altogether. Malfoy and Ron order cappuccinos as well, both looking confused about the whole ordeal. Malfoy especially looks out of place in my oversized Dudley shirt and jeans sitting in a crappy café.
Anything.
“You’ve failed me for the last time Gregor,” I say, my voice hauntingly even. “
“Imperio.”
done. After all, his wrist is clean.
A full minute passes after the front door falls closed and I realize that I haven't moved an inch. Weasley sniggers in a derisory fashion, his girlfriend scowling openly at me.
My voice gutteral and abrasive, “I should think so.” Then I Crucio him as well. Out of the corner of my eye, Narcissa’s cracking mask brings me only a glimmer of pleasure.
A rough hand clings to my arm through the jump. The second that the ground materializes under my feet, the hand tightens and pulls me backwards onto my heels as a screeching vehicle slips past. Car horns honk impatiently and blinding light comes from all directions drowning out what should be a dark night. Smelly bodies shuffle past without reservation.
“A letter came through for you.” he promptly turns on his heel to leave.
“And what’s that supposed to mean, W-”
It's terrifying to feel such true rage course through my veins, rage so strong I truly do want him dead. But, even more terrifying is the person who drops to my feet next.
The door falls open and the three step inside, me behind them. They all look with fresh eyes, but I remember being in this room a long time ago. I wandered in as a child and got a hell of a scolding from Auntie Walburga. I tell them this, but they only look more astounded.
“He's with me.” I say simply.
The woman shakes her head stately, “All of Hogsmeade had been in a frenzy because
“I say we kill him,” Harry says in a surprisingly cold, sinister voice.
I shouldn't remember any of this, yet I do. I was a child, still being pinched by Great Aunt Walburga when I first came here, back when my hair still curled and my nose and chin didn't point like my father's. By the time I was five everything about me, from the way I looked and spoke reminded the blacks of my father, and they didn't want me around so much, I reckon. Don't think Auntie Walburga liked father much. But what do I know about her?
“Thank the heavens you're back!” Myrtle simpers, floating over the sinks, “Mad, that one is. Talked nonstop and wouldn't even let me get in a word,” Myrtle pouts, doughy eyed, then she sighs and slips into her stall. I walk further in, hanging off her every word.
Dumbledore coughs into his hand and shakes his head, “Harry, m’boy, that potion took a lot out of me.”
“Potter, my wand!” Malfoy shouts from his position hunched in the corner of the counter below the cash register.
“What. Happened.” I snarl.
I nod and start with the one at my foot. As I go towards the other, Ron shakes his head and points his wand to cast. I suspect it's a particularly strong one.
to do this!”
I frantically push my way through the ever-growing crowd. It seems like the whole school has gathered under the Astronomy tower. The eyes of solemn upperclassmen and confused first years dart past gaps in the crowd, all looking for the same thing; what they saw from through the grand, stone arch on the opposite end of the field or from the height of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tower. The pale, mangled body of their beloved headmaster.
Dumbledore’s shoulders slump visibly, “Rosmerta- you confunded her?”
I snap out of trance.
!” Boiling tears trail down my face as I let my anger consume me and slap Malfoy across the face.
Dumbledore takes a step towards the shaking boy.
Thank you for reading!! I really do hope you enjoyed this chapter! Writing Draco in this way will always be one of my favorite things, I think, because his redemption was never really explored in canon. However I do find it kind of difficult. Where do I cross the line, am I making him irredeemable?
Potter presses his wand into the center of my chest; it stings. Granger and Weasley stand to the side with doubtful expressions on their face, probably wondering whether or not they should intervene. I can imagine they have to do so often. I want to laugh.
Harry bit his lip, and stared in wonder at the silver-haired boy still holding his hand. It was oddly comfortable and he didn’t really want to pull away. He wondered if he’d made the right decision to accept Mal-
Behind us I hear Malfoy murmur in a state of developing conciousness.
“That isn’t true and we both know it. You aren’t going to kill me and you certainly aren’t loyal to that man.”
I need to stop thinking of my past, I tell myself. I don't belong there anymore, not even mother can shield me from the Dark Lord’s wrath like she did with Great Auntie. I don't think I can ever go back.
“I was out of line,” Draco continued. His normally pale cheeks were a bright pink, “I didn’t think– No, that’s not right. My family, no, my Father–” he shook his head, unsure how to continue.
The wand in my hand feels of a familiar evil as I Crucio the pale, dark-haired man crumpled on the floor, the man from the cafe.
I swallow apprehensively, “No, but-”
“It’s true then, what they’re saying on the train,“ said the boy. “Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.” He indicated his two closest neighbors with a nod at each as he added, “This is Crabbe, and Goyle. And I’m Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
“Bloody hell.”
I look around panickedly, unable to lift him back up, “Is anyone here! We need help!”
killed him.”
"Let's just go to sleep."
than he ever would have expected. The intensity between them was overwhelming. The pressure of his hard cock pressing against his pants was making him light-headed. He rocked his hips against Potter’s experimentally, and the man gasped in surprise, eyes flying open. Draco kissed him almost playfully, smiling at his response.
“All the more reason to keep it a secret. Where else would I be kept alive?” he sneers.
I grin at Ginny’s words. I can always count on her to be a hopeless realist. I lean forwards to place a peck on her forehead, but end up at her identical height, and pull her in for a real kiss.
“No. Severus. Go get Severus, and only Severus.”
, I assure myself as I leave my two best friends.
It's been hours. The black sky’s dwindled to a dawn’s bittersweet blue and dew has begun to collect on the grass underneath us. Hermione’s swath of curls hides Ron’s shoulder almost completely, you'd think she was levitating off the ground in her sleep.
As I turn away, robes soaking up more blood behind me, I bellow, enunciating every word, “Find me Harry Potter, I want him dead!”
“Obliviate them. And work quickly.” Hermione says as she fixes to stand, holding a hand to her face. “If they found us it means they followed my Trace. They could send more.”
When I awake it is to a blurry, barely lit room and the feeling of warmth and security as I snuggle further into the bed. Then, the fog clears. I'm not at the Burrow. I jump out of the bed as if its burned me, my heart thumping erratically in my chest. I've woken up into something more terrifying than my nightmares: my reality.
“Don’t worry, we’ll get help here. Soon.”
Potter’s breathing grew ragged and Draco realized it matched his own. Draco was floored. The kiss was intoxicating. He felt as though all his senses were blinded with the intensity of it. He had yearned for this for so long, and fought it away, that he was overcome as all those years of pining surged to the surface. He tightened his hold on Potter, subconsciously possessive, wanting and needing more.
“I told you he wouldn’t do it!” One of the miscellaneous deatheaters shouts, “The Dark Lord shouldn’t have entrusted him or any of the Malfoys! They’re all cowards!”
I spend what feels like an hour laying there, my heart beating erratically, and trying to catch my breath, trying to remember a time when I had someone to go to afterms an episode. The images that play behind my eyelids are horrid beyond explanation.
“A vanishing cabinet, in the Room Of Requirement. It has a sister, in Borgin and Burkes. I’ve been… mending it.”
“How do I know this won't just kill me faster.” he says hoarsely.
My hands are numb by the time I finish the first page. We had a cat! And I had a broom! Dad, he would have loved to see me fly.
“Don't grovel, Lucius,” I hiss. “It’s unbecoming of you.” I crouch down and grab the bloodied man by his throat. “Besides, it won't make any difference. You and your offspring have already failed me, so you should find yourself lucky your lodgings are so… useful.”
“I don't need to move back!” I snarl, “Someone needs to bloody fucking help him!”
“Sir, I’ll go get Madame Pomfrey and call for help.” I offer, already on the balls of my feet.
"Nothing," replies Ron. "Harry's right, we can't do anything. We can go to sleep, and try to stay alive."
“Fine.”
I turn the page over but find nothing.
, this whole thing, it's bigger than than him. It's bigger that Malfoy. Bigger than Snape, bigger than Lestrange. Bigger than them; pawns the lot of them.
Ron runs a hand over his face, and says in a choked voice, “There we were, flying along, when You-Know-Who showed his ugly face and Mundungus apparated off of George’s broom. Got him hit in the side of the head with a nasty curse as he downward spiralled.”
I throw an arm around him, “Sir? Are you alright?”
I shake my head stiffly and bark, “I don't know! He was hit with a curse or something, just help, please!”
Potter paused with his fists raised defensively, narrowing his eyes at the blonde boy before him. His brow furrowed.
“Is it?”
“As it happens Severus has been assisting me.”
Just then, Madame Rosmerta runs out of The Three Broomsticks, her curly hair in disarray, “Albus! I just saw you appear, what’s happened to you?”
I heat burns in my chest as I remember Remus’ words.
I bite lip, worried.
“We must go now, before the Order arrives!” Snape bellows.
The door to the astronomy tower opens with a bang.
Outside, we all hear a crash and jump. “Let's leave them,” I say quietly, “they won’t know who they are, and the muggles will suppose they’re burglars or something. Come on.” I grab Malfoy by the arm.
Charlie grins proudly, stabbing Neville in the shoulder with his thumb, “Wouldn't gotten back at all if it wasn't for this one. Saved my life.”
“So, whose wand did you steal Malfoy?”
“We have to tell the Order, Harry. Otherwise there's nothing we can do,” Hermione resolves, shaking slightly with each step back my way.
“Look, Harry, I know his death was hard for you b-”
more.
“You bastard!” The cry escapes my lips as I bound up the stairs.
“Right, when I wanted to go look through Kreacher's things,” says the Weasel. “It was so creepy and horrid, how did I forget.”
“He’s wasting our time! The Order could be in any minute!” Fenir growls.
Maybe I could have not joined the death eater's ranks then, but how was I to know that Voldemort was batshit crazy? His old, wise ideas that he used to preach of keeping magic in pureblooded families, of separating our world from those meddlesome, violent muggles and mudbloods- he never lived up to those. He got caught up in the allure that is immortality and set his efforts completely on murdering a teenaged boy and overthrowing the ministry. That'd be no help.
“What,” I ask, pulling her zipper closed, “is Molly still upset with you?”
I push off the last step and take a look around to see where I've arrived on the second floor, only a couple yards away from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“And however did you get so many people into the castle?”
I scream, “Hermione!”
Ron picks thoughtlessly at the peeling wallpaper. “It's bloody worse than I remember,” Ron says, disagreeing with my unspoken thoughts, and steps closer to the old troll foot. “I wish Tonks were here.” He lightly kicks the troll foot with the tip of his shoe as if in tribute.
Hermione’s jaw clenches, “I can't and won't promise you anything Malfoy.”
“You should have let me help,” Malfoy snarls.
I push all previous thoughts from my mind and walk forward on the staircase. The eyes of the shrunken elf heads follow my movement and I think of Dobby. “The first floor should be fine. There's a bedroom and the parlor for us to use.”
Harry was dumbfounded. He had no idea what to say. He folded his arms, arched a brow, and waited to hear whatever Malfoy was trying to say.
“It'd be too risky to cast a spell either way!” Granger says firmly, pushing his wand aside. Potter’s eyes gleam, red light reflecting from the busy traffic.
“Not what you can see,” replies Ron.
“Bastard!” Ron cries. His wand gripped tight in his hand he throws a curse which hits one of the men right in the chest. The man falls to the ground in a fit of spastic movement, his wand flying to the other end of the shop. As light flashes in through the side window, Hermione’s wand falls to the ground with a clatter as the result of an Expelliarmus. The other wizard, foaming at the mouth, snaps and charges at them, his wand ablaze.
“What else is in there?”
We're sitting, simply drinking and thinking to sooth our anxious nerves for what feels like forever, when two men walk into the café; both have tall trench coats, both dark-haired and very pale. They could even be brothers. Neither of them seem to so much as take notice of us, huddled up in our booth, until they sit at a table not too far away.
“I know you, Ferret, and I'm afraid
When my feet hit the ground I feel a strong urge to puke; I’ve always disliked the feeling of apparition, especially over long distances. Closing my eyes to fight the compulsion I can still see the Inferi creeping towards me and smell the salty sea air, but when I open them it’s just us, me and Dumbledore, under the starry sky.
Hagrid rouses and I stoop to his side, brushing the fringe from his forehead. Remus rises off his bent knees, addressing Arthur darkly.
“Only, there are more. And he hadn't discovered how to destroy them yet.” I pull the locket I took off of Dumbledore’s body from my pocket, thumbing the charm.
I run down the stairs leading to the door. I have to find Snape.
The trip from number 4 to the Burrow, from what I saw, didn't go as planned. I remember thinking, for a moment, that this might actually be the end as Voldemort appeared out of a cloud of smoke and Hedwig fell from the sky.
“I'm sorry, Professor. This was never supposed to happen.” My throat feel dry from pulling out those empty words. I reach out and place a hand over Dumbledore’s heart, willing it to beat again. The tears on my cheek are burning hot, a stark contrast from the icy wind that blows through my hair.
“I didn't summon those death eaters,” Malfoy says quietly, and I tell him that I know.
They lost themselves in the kiss, their hips moving rhythmically against each other, breath hot, lips soft, and tongues insistent.
“Maybe it's the red hair,” I try, cringing as I turn away.
“It’s Harry,” Potter said with a grin. He held out his hand, “Harry Potter. I’m new to this world, and I could use all the friends I can get.”
“And what about you Harry! You can't keep putting everyone's life ahead of yours and think that's doing anyone any good! That's not how love works!”
“Do think it was the Ministry that alerted You-Know-Who’s followers at the wedding?” Ron poses, evidently thinking aloud. “I saw a few ministry guests, they could have been talking to Pops. He's too trusting sometimes…”
I toss my wand from hand to hand, just feeling the weight if it.
Potter seemed to come back to his senses from the initial blankening of his mind at the start of the kiss. He pushed back at Draco’s tongue, fighting for control of the kiss. Potter’s hands rose, one to Draco’s hair, the other gripping the back of Draco’s neck.
“See, you're not dead. And you're finally speaking to someone other than Moaning Myrtle.”
“It was. Obviously more clever than any of your Order has been in your protection. Or you as matter of fact. If anyone was privy to this information, as you prolude, they’ve done nothing.”
My eyes dart around quickly, flickering with each strong pulse of the blood streaming through my veins.
“What'd you do to the owner, huh? Lock ‘em in a closet? A quick obliviate?”
I grab a blanket from the room and toss it at Malfoy; his head snaps around and he has to lean forward to pick it up from the floor. For some reason I feel obligated to sit by him.
Draco ached to do more. He knew he had intrigued spectators, but he didn’t care. Let them watch! He smirked to himself at the thought. He would never have expected an opportunity like this. Actually kissing Potter, feeling him in his arms, was so much
“Why can't you just let me do this!” The plumbing underfoot creaks and sighs under the sudden movement.
,” she raise a hand to the sky, “Had appeared next to the moon. Then, everything went quiet. Everyone hid or disappeared.”
“Draco!” someone hisses, “Have you done the deed yet?”
“Why won't she just tell us exactly what he said!” Hermione paces up and down the row of toilets, her tone outraged.
As both of my hands are occupied in an attempt to bare-handedly fight a grown man, the other man reaches  Hermione and slaps her across the face, slamming her backlamming her back against the wall.
“Harry move out of the way, he's a bloody death eater!” Remus pulls out his wand and points it at Malfoy’s now fully blond head, “Probably the one that cursed them too, huh? Cru-”
Lucius Malfoy is a shadow of his former self, with a patchy beard spreading down his throat and his thin, greasy hair so filthy it's yellow. His adam’s apple bops up and down as he wheezes, “My Lord,” but my bare foot hits his throat before the word's even finished.
"Ron-"
I hope you liked this next chapter, it's my first ever that's been beta-ed by @InkSilver here on AO3! *squeals with excitement* Please leave me a comment letting me know what you thought! I totally allow constructive criticism so please give some!! (Or suggestions, anything is cool as long as it's not mean)
“Of course,” said Robin, laughing. “
“Can we not talk about him?’ said Hermione. “He scares me.”
He watched closely as the two duellers took up their stances, which oddly reminded him of a fencer’s stance, and began to stare at each other, as if that would help them in the duel. It was about twenty seconds later when a spell was shot and deflected right at him. He tense don instinct and watched as the red spell vanished into dust right in front of his eyes. It seemed as if that started off the duel at a much fiercer level.
Draco woke up earlier than normal the next morning, he felt like he slept a century and his mind seemed more clam now, but it still felt blank, like he was missing something, like it was a void. He flicked his legs from the bed and took a quick shower and got ready for the day. Blaise knocked on his door with a smile wider than the hallway.
“She didn’t come back because she would be recognised by you,” said Harry. “It all makes sense now.”
He glanced around the Chamber, confused on what he could do. He ignored Ginny Weasley, which was a bad thing as he missed the slightly transparent, ghostly liquid that began to seep from the now open diary. Of course, he still didn’t notice as the transparent mist began to form into a human, a rather handsome looking human boy.
He had been first, Krum had been second, Fleur had been third, and that left Longbottom to be fourth.
“He didn’t do it,” said Harry, his tone cold. “Granger, Longbottom and Weasley found the cat like this and arrived moments before the entire group did. In fact, they had a small argument about running away from it.”
“Houses.”
“I will give you a fifty,” said Atieno, holding his hand upwards and shaking it a little. “You made some strong points, but you also fell behind with a few others. The Dark Arts are called that because they were used in the Dark Ages, which is not something most people are willing to talk about and it has been struck from history. Only an insipid moron would dare try and use the argument that any spell could be Dark Arts if you tried enough. They are not worth your time because they are spewing the same old nonsense that was used centuries ago by those who really wanted to be relevant but lacked any talent whatsoever.
Severus knew when Harry lied, always has been able to. He pushed it out of his mind and sent his godson a quick smirk. “Well, let’s duel, Harry.”
“I don’t know why you’re thanking me for ruining your life,” said Harry as he lifted the wand that seemed to call out to him, knowing it was about to be used. “Obliviate!”
He turned towards the boy next to Fleur, his surprise clearly visible, if the smile on her face was evidence enough, and pursed his lips in thought. It seemed that he was the only one that was trying to send a message through the Yule Ball. His respect for the girl grew intensely.
“Quit thinking so hard,” said Professor Snape as he peered into the cauldron. “Only people that achieve an ‘Outstanding’ on their O.W.L.s are allowed into my class. I do not tolerate slackers.”
“Of course,” said Lily happily. It was a trait of her son’s that she adored, the fact he was an early riser.
“Caught in the act!” yelled out Ernie, pointing his pale finger at Neville. “Who did you petrify this time? Hm – oh my, Justin!”
“How’d you get left here?” he blurted out after a moment of silence. “I mean, no offence, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where that’d happen. Also, what’s your name? It’s weird not calling you anything.”
“What happened to the book?”
“You’ll never guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes,” said Neville as he climbed up the steps with Hermione and Ron on either side of him.
“Right,” said Draco as he walked away. He and Rosier were friends, but not like he was friend with Harry. He put up with Rosier because Harry did.
Molly’s face paled and she turned to Ron, “what exactly did you do?”
Harry folded his arms over his chest and glared at the man.
“I wonder where Miss Granger is,” said Professor Burbage as she tucked the class roll back into her desk. “I have bought in a few casual clothing in various sizes for you all to wear. They are cleaned and have not been worn before. You have ten minutes to find and put on an outfit – Miss Granger, you’re late! Ten points from Gryffindor!”
Many students, despite their rampant love for the sport, were deciding whether they should give the upcoming Quidditch game a pass, knowing that the conditions would be almost unbearable.
Draco instantly stood and looked around the room.
Draco knelt down next to Harry, “are you alright Harry?” Draco resisted the urge to pick up and cradle Harry.
Hagrid didn’t understand until he said serious and Sirius out loud and then he chuckled loudly. “Yeh havin’ me on ‘Arry, I can’t get a new wand, Ministry fo’bid it they did!”
“That remains to be seen…” said Lucius with a highly vicious smirk. “But as all twelve of us have voted.”
James nodded, picking up his son, and made his way towards the exit of the room. Before he had taken more than three steps, he was aware that his son was far lighter than any fourteen-year-old boy should be.
Harry carefully looked at Granger, keeping his face and void of any emotions despite how much he could feel his lip twitching. Honestly, he didn’t even think about getting the oaf fired for raising a dragon, he really just wanted to see the man raise a dragon in a wooden hut. He watched the Golden Trio carefully, his green eyes blinking every now and then as he studied the posture and expressions on their faces. “No, I just want to see a dragon’s egg, of course that is if he even has one,” he said calmly and turned around. “Well, are you coming or not?”
that they will burn out and the game will drag on into the night.”
Nothing.
“He’s fast,” said Terence to Marcus Flint as he watched the first-year speed after the Golden Snitch. “He’s the perfect build for Seeker – small and fast.”
Bellatrix tapped her wand underneath the connected hands, as opposed to the Unbreakable Vow, which was tapped in the top. She muttered a few words and Latin and smirked when a whip of fire began circling around the two entwined hands.
“I’m so glad that you all made it,” said Nott, smiling. “I understand that the location moved and I’m sure the very few of you are curious about that.”
“I was thinking of going to my old house, but it’d have new spells by now and I really don’t want to smash through more spells. It’s a lot different going in rather than out… it’s more effort and more force needed. I doubt I’d get us through in one piece and still be able to –”
“Lucius won’t hurt you, y’know,” he said, unsure of why he was trying to make them feel better. “You’re essentially family if you look at it in some kind of twisted logic that these pure-bloods use.”
He realised that Nott’s plan on hiding his talents was smart, but he couldn’t stand it. When challenging someone to a duel, you should use everything you had. It was dishonourable to challenge someone and then waste time by hiding and acting sneaky. Perhaps it was time to use more serious spells rather than smaller spells, see how Nott liked that.
“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” shouted Neville, startling the group. “And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a mad Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!”
Draco took Dumbledore’s arm and in an instant they were back in Dumbledore’s office.
“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. He looked at Neville who had seemed to do the same exact thing.
James did deserve praise for it however, it was genius and if he put his mind to it, he could almost put Zonko's Joke Shop out of business with the different types of charms and jinxes that he had made over the years.
“But he never came for us,” said Fred. “I don’t think he ever learned what it was, seeing as it’s just a blank piece of parchment, but he knew it was dangerous.”
“He’s not back yet, Ron, I heard he’s coming back tomorrow.”
“None of the books are cursed, so you won’t need to keep your wand handy,” said Lucius. “I counter the wine and alcohol in the cupboard. You may be mature, but you’re twelve, going on thirteen, and you may have a lapse of sanity and intelligence and try and sneak a bottle of my fine wine. One sip of that wine and you’ll be on the floor, slobbering and drooling over it, unable to forget even the simplest of sentences.”
“Jordan, would you mind telling us about the game?” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “I am certain the students would like to hear what’s going on in the match.”
Not to mention that the book smelled just like Atieno.
No human could get in his vault, not even his parents, and that’s how he liked it. Who in their right mind would think that an eleven year old boy held a priceless artefact, such as the Philosopher’s Stone?
As he had predicted, his feather wall lasted around twenty seconds before it was completely destroyed. He watched as the feathers slowly fell to the ground before vanishing almost instantly. That bit surprised him, even when he had planned the spell out with Salazar and Atieno. He hadn’t expected something like that to happen.
“Miss Granger,” said Professor Lupin, a frown on his face as he checked the list once more. “Please don’t interrupt. As I was saying, the next part is to actually run the obstacle course. This is not a theory exam. I will not be holding your hand. You may consult your students for aid. The area has been warded so that I can hear
He cast a spell that he had used previously. This time, however, it had another use. He had become to understand Nott’s patterns, which were rather unpredictable and constantly changing, but he had them. Block, block, attack, dodge, right, attack, dodge. An amazingly simple pattern, but one that seemed to work exceptionally well. So, when Harry swapped his own pattern to counter Nott’s, it worked flawlessly.
“I’ve always wanted to meet the Queen.”
“It’s heavily rumoured that Nicolas Flamel had his own Alchemical Circle or, at least, built his home around one,” said Harry, moving his finger towards France. “He was, after all, an unrivalled alchemist that completely redefined the art. It’s thanks to him that most of what we can do is possible. If he didn’t have one, I’d be shocked. He could’ve learned how to make one… I doubt that, though.”
She couldn’t compete with either of them. It was pointless to even debate it.
Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow-tie and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.
The girl stumbled off, most likely towards the nurse.
“I don’t understand,” said Cornelius, frowning. “Surely it considers me to be the biggest threat due to the fact I am much bigger than you.”
“Thank you,” said Harry, putting the note in his pocket. “What now?”
He placed the letter next to the book that Granger had bought him and grinned at them, his plan and excitement merging together and causing an overwhelming sense of happiness. He would never write on a book, even if it was one as dumb as the book Granger had bought him. His mother was different, however. She would jot down whatever she had on mind, making half her books half-books, half-diaries.
“No, you daft moron,” said Draco. “Do you
“Yes?” the man said, his eyes glinting with amusement. “Oh, how rude of me, I’m Vasily. It is a pleasure to meet you…?”
Not only that, but as he was parting ways with his mother, he learned that James was working on the case with Nott. It surprised him because he assumed it would simply be a lost cause, leaving the boy to suffer the effects for his lifetime. Then again, Nott was a child and the magical populace put children on a pedestal.
“Dumbledore’s gonna put something to stop tampering,” he said. “The Tournament as a whole is worthless and not interesting, the fact that I could bypass something that Dumbledore did… I guess that’s a worthy enough achievement and would turn heads more than winning.”
“Are you going to be the mother hen of our dormitory and pick up all the clothes?” asked Draco, almost tauntingly. “I’m pretty sure Professor Snape will handle it, I can assume he will have strict hygiene rules, especially as the students grow older.” He decided to move a random pawn on the board two spaces and smiled.
“Do you know what’s going on?” said Draco, locking the door to the compartment. “Thank Merlin for the safety charms on the train to stop it from derailing. Father told me about them.”
He understood it, though. If the roles were reversed and some fourteen-year-old boy was mocking him, he would throw his name in to prove the little twerp wrong.
“Well…” Draco explained on how he was in the infirmary as he was hit by a spell and was dragged to the infirmary, and that he can ask Madam Pomfrey if he wishes. He then told Snape that he heard Harry crying and he went to comfort him, and that he blamed himself for his parents death, and that he told them he was worthless, and not to call himself Harry Potter anymore, that he had no surname, and of course that him being called Harry Potter was a disgrace, to his mother and father. “And that’s when you came in and insisted on calling him Potter” Draco said rather loudly, while Snape went pale, “that’s what set him off!” Draco said bitterly.
“Because, as I just said, she is wasting her potential,” said Harry. “Longbottom is useless in every subject besides Defence Against the Dark Arts. He has no drive to better himself in any other subject besides that and it’s painful. Even if he wants to be an Auror, he’ll need to understand a lot of different potions, some basic healing spells, some warding spells, and a bit of curse-breaking.”
“It is, isn’t it,” said Petunia. “I got it from the shop a few weeks ago, wasn’t that expensive but it’s become a regular cup for me.”
Harry pouted, “only a few times, but then I just leave it.”
Snape had to drink some tea so people wouldn’t realize he was smiling, Draco was perfect at riling Weasley up, almost as good as Snape.
“The heir of Slytherin left another message, much like the first, it was written in blood, under the first message,” said Professor McGonagall, her face pale and her hands shaking. “For his betrayal, his body will lie in the Chamber of Secrets forever. His sacrifice, if it could be called that, will be worth the pain and suffering.”
“Yes, I have seen many things about you, Harry Potter,” said Ronan with a serene expression before turning to look at the other students. “Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?”
Draco gasped, “you’re joking-”
However, he also knew that the friendship that had formed between his mother and Narcissa had started off as Narcissa trying to save some face for her family, which was admirable. Her husband had been a well-known Death Eater, not convicted of anything, but everyone knew. She, being the Black that she once was, attempted to seek out the same group of people her husband was suspected of torturing, and befriended them, using every ounce of charm, intelligence, and power that she held.
“Why?”
He paused when he saw Longbottom, who had seemingly taken up residence in the library, always flanked by Weasley or Granger. Mostly Granger. He gave one last swipe in front of him, sure he would catch the
Harry walked alongside his mother slowly, while he pondered how he was going to ask the question, perhaps if he just blurt it out, it’d be easier to ask and therefore not an issue. “What happened to Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, weren’t they father’s friends?”
“I realise this room isn’t much, but it’s better than shivering under a park bench,” said the man, smiling. “Because I won’t be starting work until around three in the afternoon tomorrow, I’ll try and get all this swept up now. I just have a few standard questions.”
“Language, Mr. Potter,” called Professor Snape across the room, “and they’re in there, obviously, I assume they’re just out of sight because your vision is filled with angst.”
“There you are, Mr. Potter.”
“I do not like it,” said Severus, “but I decided it was for the best when he decided to hurl a potion at my head. Thankfully, I, like any decent Potion master, charm all my phials unbreakable.”
Beating on his door snapped him from his thoughts, “enter.”
“Anyone know when we’re actually gonna leave?” he asked. “This is getting ridiculous. We should’ve been gone ten minutes ago.”
He knew that no Slytherins would dare leave, not because of looking out for their own, but they didn’t want Harry to hurt them when he got back, not that said boy would do such a thing. As he waited for Dumbledore to wrap up his little speech, he silently debated how it would be different if Harry was in each house.
“I could speak for an entire day and not even cover an inch of dirt that family has,” said Pansy. “I’m sure Skeeter would love anything on that family.”
“I’ll come,” said Draco. “I wanna gossip about people putting their names in. The water is hotter than usual today, for some reason. Don’t take too long. You wanna be out of here before Crabbe and Goyle wake up.”
“Of course.”
He glanced downwards, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the piece of bacon he was going to eat. It was a tragedy that the last his breakfast was ruined. He considered what would have happened if he had been eating when the Portkey activated, seeing as you were not meant to be eating or have eaten in the previous fifteen minutes. Either way, he muttered something under his breath, dusted off his trousers and robe, and stood.
“Nice half-truth,” said Harry, glaring.
unable to use the Floo without breaking things, Neville?”
“He’s guilty,” said Harry, whispering. “I used Legilimency on him and I learned a few things. He set fire to the Bulgarian embassy to create chaos so that his buddies could slip in, loot the tent of priceless artefacts, and then slip out while everyone was distracted. He was held up because someone confronted him and then the second explosion, which was to be the getaway distraction, caught him in the leg as he was lagging behind.”
“How’d you know that?”
Draco grunted and slid has palms over his face, “what is it?” Draco stood instantly, “where is Harry? Is Harry okay?”
“I would appreciate if you could look into something for me,” Voldemort touched his new arm, “complete secrecy of course.”
Harry continued to read the letter, which took a great deal of time due to the sheer amount that had been written and crammed onto the parchment. The little anecdotes squished into places, the hastily crossed out words and the rough edges that showed a few spells being cast to attempt to neaten the letter and make it look presentable.
Harry gave Theo an incredulous look before chuckling slightly and turning away, looking out the window, he saw a few Merfolk swim past and look at him curiously. “It’s a long story really,” he shrugged, “the headmaster told me not to tell anyone about it until I get the all clear from Professor Snape.”
“And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.
“Just kidding,” he said, grinning. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
“What’s a boy in his class saying?” questioned Hermione, looking between the spot that Colin had just been shoved from and Neville. “Well?”
“Green, Lewis.”
Harry smiled softly at the repeated words, his heart fluttering at the tone that they had been spoken with. His eyes fluttered harmlessly as he was twirled around, the hand of his partner brushing ever so gently against his hips as he was steadied after a spin. He tilted his head, his cheeks flushed a bright red, and prepared himself for the final step, the step that would allow other students to appear on the dancefloor.
“He is one of few who has shown dedication,” said Asahi. “Come, Harry, it is about time I sought to make your Flame brighter than it has ever been.”
“Voldemort placed that into your memory, he’s trying to control you, Harry.” Dumbledore said with his eye twinkled as bright as ever. Before Dumbledore could even think about what he was going to say next he flicked up his wand and stopped Harry’s spell.
“True, but you don’t play Quidditch.”
“Unhand me this instant, Weasley, these robes cost more than your shack,” muttered Harry, completely unbothered by the blood trickling from his nose. He did debate throwing a random curse at the boy on him, but then he realized that he wanted a perfect record, it would earn him the most respect in the long run. “Longbottom, your parents didn’t die for you to just stand there and gape – oof!” He winced as a fist connected with his stomach. “Weasley, must you be so plebeian?”
“Unlike your family, mine don’t condone loveless marriages!”
“I don’t exactly like sweet food; it gives me an awful toothache. Could I have a tea?” Narcissa smiled and gave Draco a soft and warm look.
“Yes, I knew it was you that was following me for the same reason that I knew the Ministry wouldn’t get me for casting magic in the presence of an adult,” said Harry. “If an underage child is in the presence of a magical adult, the Trace will not activate as it assumes the magical adult cast the spell. There were no adults near me, just a simple black dog. Even if I lacked my memories that bit of information would’ve tipped me off.”
“It’s not my job to write to you, you’re the parent, be one!”
“Shut up, Pansy,” said Draco, glaring. “Anyway, you go to Dumbledore and say it’s been stolen. He’d send you away and then go check on it while you’re gone. You shouldn’t know about it so they’ll disregard anything you say.”
“I think I’m on a streak of offending people with things they know nothing about,” said Harry. “First Granger and now Crabbe and Goyle, I wonder who’s next.”
“Hello Malfoy,” Hermione smiled at him.
“Well, there’s no point in standing on the doorstep making idle conversation, come in,” said Petunia and gestured both of them inside. She once again glanced beyond the two guests and made sure no one was looking as she was sure that Lily would just do her freaky thing and vanish from inside the actual house. “Vernon will be home shortly, he’s just stuck at work dealing with a big sale.”
“Yeah,” continued Harry, ignoring Nagini. “It’s a girl, which means I’ll call her Nagini.”
“Peeves, thank Merlin it’s you,” began Draco, letting out a sigh of relief.
Every single student leaned forwards in anticipation, wondering what Flint would want. It was so suspenseful, just waiting for what would be said.
He attached the letter on Hedwig’s foot and gently pet the owl who was nudging his hand almost affectionately. “Try and get that to mother as fast as you can,” he said. “Make sure you remain safe as well.”
He, of course, ignored Tom on the subject of good and evil. They both knew there was no such thing. You weren’t either born good or evil. Everyone sat on a metaphorical line and never moved from it.
“You see, Susan – I may call you Susan, yes?”
Harry was sitting quietly in the limousine which beared the Malfoy family crest on each door, the interior was a lush green and silver, the roof was decorated with soft velvet material and there was a small bar in the middle. The windows were spelled so that you could see out, but not in. Harry never thought the Malfoy family would use Muggle transport to and from their home, he always assumed they apparated to King’s Cross station.
“Sure,” said Draco as he pursed his lips and turned to face his friend. “His name is Professor Quirrell, I think. The one who stutters and looks at Longbottom as if he holds the world’s greatest secret.”
“Too learn.”
“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,” explained Neville. “I’ve got to go and find them…”
“Flattery is beneath me,” said Harry. “I spent the day with Dudley yesterday, I know how intelligent he may be, despite his outward appearance and attitude.”
“I’m not using a belt on the book!” said Draco, glaring. “My belts are worth more than this stupid book.”
Draco lent in close, “don’t take offense, it’s just because you’re now a Professor, it’s most likely malicious.” Draco led Harry into his room and was slightly nervous, he doubt Harry would judge, “I’ll be right back, feel free to look about.”
He was beginning to tire, having waved his wand nonstop for fifteen minutes in complex patterns. The soles of his feet ached due to the odd points on the rock, and his throat felt drier than it had ever been. He had long since run out of spells to use and was simply weaving them back and forth, going for raw power over any kind of finesse. At this point, his sole goal was to hit the man with something unpredictable.
Dumbledore and Blaise burst in; Draco dropped Harry’s hand and looked at them.
“Oh no, Weasley has cracked the case and found us out,” said Harry sarcastically. “We were all just comparing our Dark Marks and planning to slaughter Muggles. Get your head out of Longbottom’s behind, Weasley, you disgrace.”
“That’s the one; I assume you brought Harry’s body here because his parents are buried here?”
Harry woke up with drool dripping down his face; he gently slid off his glasses and looked at Draco, “when are we leaving this place? I am so bored, and hungry, and tired.” Harry closed his eyes briefly before opening them, “can I copy your potions work? I didn’t do it and I don’t want Snape to assign me more that I won’t actually do, no one cares about half the stuff he assigns. Why would I need to make a potion when I can just go and ask him for one and he will give me one?”
“Okay,” muttered Neville, forcing his memory to occupy his mind. “Expecto Patronum!”
“Things are not going as
Gone was the little shy boy that Harry once was, staring wide-eyed up at everything as he took it in. That small boy had changed and flourished into an intelligent and somewhat charming young man. He was still somewhat bitter about everyone and everything that he saw as wasting time, but he was still in pursuit of knowledge.
,’ said Tom. ‘
Another issue was how charismatic Nott was. The boy was more bookish than him and this unnerved him. He, himself, was hardly charismatic, especially not how Nott currently was. Not only that, but the boy was speaking as if it was already a real war, not like a simple house rivalry. It was confusing and aggravating at the same time.
Harry thought on it as he was pulled up. “So, it’s like that curse that Professor Quirrell used on Longbottom?”
Harry scowled at being manhandled and fought to not laugh at Draco’s whiny tone. His right eye twitched slightly as he debated the options. Draco had received a letter earlier today that Lucius was stopping in and not to come and seek him as it was official Ministry business. There was a promise that he would stop by on the next weekend to watch the Quidditch game, which was Slytherin verse Hufflepuff.
“I am intelligent.”
“But isn’t that the point? Everyone starts out on the same level at school, and then it depends on how you learn from there.”
Harry walked towards the oaf’s hut, his shoes crunching on the slightly loose gravel path that looked like it had never once been tended to in the entire time that the castle had been around, actually he wasn’t even sure if it was meant to be gravelled or if it was just random bits of rock that formed a somewhat path. He realized that a few students were still walking around, and some coming from the Quidditch pitch, he realized that it must have been Ravenclaw’s practice session, he kept his chin up and continued walking, slightly weaving around people, not wanting to get slammed over due to his small size and the fact one of them was about three of him in body mass.
“I think he’s getting private lessons,” said Rosier. “Lupin’s teaching him how to beat the Dementors seeing as Longbottom faints like a woman every time he sees one.”
“Hmph.”
“Keep distracting me and you’ll feel his full wraith; he can be very harsh if he wants, even without Snape here staring at him with a slight smirk on his face when Harry punishes his friends.”
Someone, most likely a Gryffindor, was going to be in trouble for dropping and carrying the phial of potion around.
The second month of the holidays had gone by at a rapid pace, faster than the first half, which had shocked Harry as it was usually opposite. He always anticipated the next year and that caused them to go by much slower than they should have, but currently, they had sped by in the blink of an eye.
Draco glared at the board when his knight was taken. He straightened up and stared at Harry. “It was all planned.”
“Rivers, Oliver!” called Professor McGonagall.
“Jesus!” he said, wiping soot off his face. “He’s quicker than I thought.”
spell on a plant will kill it,” continued Harry, a knowing look on his face. “You’ve backed up my theory with what you’ve just said. You stated that a plant will yield less harvest if it’s floated. That proves my theory.”
“Why would you seek power though?” asked Dudley, remembering back to one of the shows he watched recently. “It’ll always cause issues in the end, won’t it?”
“I meant relationship wise Lucius.”
“The book by Sun Tzu?”
“Get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred, attempting to nudge his brother out of the way. “Neville’s in a hurry!”
“Indeed she is, Severus loved her very much, I cannot say much for James as he spent more time with his friends than Lily or Harry, but let’s not speak ill of the dead. Lily was a talented witch, she excelled in potions, had she lived, I would have hired her and not Severus.” Dumbledore chuckled.
Severus just shook his head.
. You’re just wasting time and you’re holding people up. Look behind you.”
you.”
Harry didn’t like this. How could Longbottom, the clueless idiot, know how to speak Parseltongue? He had watched him since Nagini had dropped a hint about it, but he shoved it aside with a grain of salt, hoping that Nagini was wrong and he was right, like always. He wanted to say something, to taunt Longbottom but the entire Great Hall was silent and the students were just standing around, gaping.
“Honestly, Ron,” said Hermione, sighing. “That’s because Potter is missing and they don’t want to show that they’re hurting about it, but they’re still kids and they’re affected by it.”
Dumbledore raised his hand, silencing the bickering boys instantly. “Well now boys, I must admit that you both were at fault –”
Fred burst out laughing and George supported himself on the nearby wall, much to the annoyance of the third-year Gryffindor standing in front of them. They slowly steadied themselves and mentally counted to three before approaching that simple statement as maturely as they could, which wasn’t very.
“What’s happening?” asked Ron, looking at Neville. “Why aren’t you guys on the pitch yet?”
name is, I’ll give you one. Last. Chance to put down your wand and come into the Ministry of Magic for questioning.”
“Not likely!” said Neville, throwing up another weak shield. “If you’re so good, why haven’t you won it yet?”
“I wasn’t hiding, I was using the toilet.”
“What’s your plan?”
“Oy, Neville! Is this your toad?” the large man shouted, startling plenty of kids, while he was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
A woman with red-hair and bright green eyes walked around the sitting room, her son speaking complete nonsense as he looked up at his mother. Her eyes glistened with almost tears when she glanced down and saw her baby boy giggling at her, as if it was funny she was crying. “Oh, Harry, you’re too adorable.” She cooed and kept walking in a half circle in the sitting room. She did debate putting her son in bed, but she knew her one year old son wouldn’t dare sleep until he saw his father.
Harry and Draco stepped outside, easily avoiding getting caught. They were Slytherins, after all, and glanced up at the sky. The sky was clear and filled with stars, shining brightly.
I throw several stunners, and though the sight of Hermione’s terrified face turns my arm to jelly, I manage to land an Expelliarmus and catch the wizard’s wand with my left hand. But the other wizard whom I presumed to be stunned grabs that arm, and attempts to wrestle it away as the wandless wizard continues to charge.
“No,” He says fervently, “Severus- I need Severus and only Severus.”
Potter blinked and glared at Draco, seeming to forget Theo altogether in that moment. “Yes, Malfoy, I accept the challenge. Unless you’re afraid and hoping I’ll say no
Draco quirked an eyebrow and replied coolly, parroting him, “Unlikely.”

Once changed, the three begin planning their next course of action in rushed whispers, and, I’d nearly forgot, I'm merely a piece of luggage to be dragged along. I only play a real part in whatever this is when the Golden Boy wishes it.
“Hogwarts isn't going to be the same and we all know it. Why is that everyone insists of feigning normalcy? I mean, they're throwing a  sodding wedding, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Where did they go! Where are
“Enough!” Potter pushes his way between us. “We need to talk to the elf.”
My hand searches Dumbledore’s neckline surreptitiously as I fix myself to stand, then slipping a chain into the pocket of my robes, and pull out my wand, raising it to the moon in consequence. The magic of a thousand wands light up the sky, the stark white chasing away the fading green, as another star joins the constellations.

I peek into Ron’s doorway. Malfoy sits a few feet away from Hermione, running his left palm up his arm nervously.
With a sigh, I nod and grip my wand tightly, closing my eyes once more. Quietly, I whisper, “Number Twelve Grimmauld Place.”
My breath heaving, I step back apprehensively. “You're the last ones back.”
He looks me harshly in the eye. “Then why don't I believe you?”
“George!”
As I open my eyes Hermione tugs me up and forward. I can see Molly out of the corner of my eye, tears spilling onto her cheeks. They're all looking at me. I ask them what I've just done.
I point to Black’s room and they rush inside, slamming the door behind them. Slowly, I tiptoe over and press my ear to the door. Gryffindors are always far too loud regardless.
Glass shatters somewhere nearby and I hear a scream that sounds nothing like Hermione’s.
A warm hand squeezes my thigh, “Harry, you know he's still harmless, no matter how much he barks. We can't let him be a priority. We need to stay safe.”
“Potter,” Mcgonagall squeezes my shoulder. I turn my head to see her slumped posture, her clenched jaw and fragile expression. The D.A. stands on the edge of the crowd, their wands spitting white sparks into the sky.
I jump up and clutch her by the arm, “We can't tell them about this,” I desperately insist. Hermione pulls out of my grasp.
I step around the couch where the Mudblood and the Weasel sleep, poke into the room where Potter slept. It's empty now. Perhaps he's gone exploring as well.
I pull back my wand and scream the first spell that comes to mind, “Sectumsempra!”

“I –” Draco began. He took a breath and started again, “I wanted to apologize.”
“Here. You read it I.. couldn't.”
I hope you liked this chapter, and please leave a comment letting me know (I loveeee constructive criticism) and kudos if you did. Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
“And my Mother! And my Father! You think you understand this but you don’t! I can’t be saved!”
He sneers. “Weasley asked.”
It hurts too much. To have my wand in my hand and be able to do nothing.

“You know what I mean,” he says, legs pumping quickly. “Were you a part of the raid?”
“Bellatrix,” Dumbledore nods, “You’ve come through as well?”
I really hope you guys enjoyed this chapter, and thanks again to my wonderful beta @InkSiver! If you did like this chapter please let me know with a kudos and comment, please tell me what you think! I'm always open to constructive criticism (just try to be kind).
“Answer me, dammit! Where are they! You- you
They didn't understand it either, when
“That was close. Too close,” I say, my chest heaving with each breath.
“How long ago was this?” Dumbledore asks.
Malfoy scowls but doesn't reply, dragging his nails along the hardwood flooring.
“Harry-” Hermione’s eye widen at the sight of me. She takes me unto her arms and I sob into her shoulder, a soothing hand rubbing circles into my back.
I climb to the third floor slowly, my bones aching. I feel weaker and weaker each day, malnourished and thin. I wonder if they've noticed at all. Soon I will become more of a burden than an asset. What will Potter do with my body then?
Theo took a moment to think, then grinned wickedly at him and declared, “I dare you…” and he paused a moment for dramatic effect, “to kiss Harry Potter!”

Her face displays every bit of  the fiery  stubbornness that made me fall in love with her. She purses her lips, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear, “Tell me exactly what you'd tell any one of them, then.”
“I packed days ahead. I was hoping we wouldn't need it, but...” Granger mutters as she digs around in her pouch.
As we kick off I can see Madame Rosmerta staring after us, an odd expression painting her face. Maybe it’s just the light, but I notice it all the same.
Malfoy walks leisurely up the stairs. The bottoms of his robes are dusty and his legs are shaking.
I rise unsteadily to my feet and my vision clouds over for a moment.
“No, he can’t do anything,” Potter says. “He doesn't have a wand now and he's not getting one, so let's leave it at that.”
“You know where to go, Harry,” Ron says, as he and Hermione each grasp a firm hold of my free arm.
He sneers, “There you go, there is something in that pretty head of your’s.”

“Harry?”
I swallow the lump in my throat, continuously moving back, “I  haven’t told you two everything. Not yet.” I hear the sound of cloth rustling from where I can't see, past the brown-eyed girl.
“Harry what are you talking about? You can't defeat Voldemort. Getting rid of Umbridge was one thing, taking on the darkest wizard of our age is something completely different.”
As my luck would have it, Potter turns and stares suspiciously at me and grabs my arm, only to see that I have nothing hidden in my sleeves. He looks confused more than anything.
The bushy-haired witch visibly suppresses a scoff, her nostrils flared and eyes rolling up to the ceiling.
I then see the nameplate of Sirius’ old bedroom room and push open the door, feeling almost drawn to it. It looks unchanged as ever. After his death I would come back to this room. I still can feel his presence as I did then, as if it was hanging off of the peeling wallpaper, ingrained in the floorboards.
Sleepily, I stumble to the back entrance of the castle, shoving the doors open unceremoniously. I feel like I'm in a haze.
“Oh but I will,“ Malfoy’s grip on his wand tightens.“I will kill you,” he insists.
It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault-
“Mad-Eye I think,” I say. “He probably wanted to ward off Death Eaters and… well, he'd want to ward off–”
“Hermione, where are we?” The weasel exclaims as the hand retracts from my arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I'm guessing everyone else had a safe… trip. Dear Merlin, Harry.” Charlie takes in the scene that's set, his knuckles going white around my shoulder.
I wipe my brow, confused, “But Professor, you need help-”
I want to say something reassuring to Ron at that moment, but the angry woman comes out of the kitchen just then, momentarily interrupting the conversation with a tray of drinks, which she slams on our table before walking away.
The wind whistles through the growing brush and my breath steams up in the frigid night.
No. He wouldn't
I try to hide my astonishment but my tongue is tied.
“If they didn't I highly doubt they'd be throwing curses, ‘Mione!” I rise for half a second to throw a stunner that one of the men blocks.
a death sentence. But, I suppose even diamonds break under enough pressure.
Ron places a placating hand on Hermione’s shoulder, mimicking her perplexed expression.
“You're not getting your wand back,” I say first, but he doesn't even scowl.
“Where the bloody fuck were you,
Malfoy laughs, cold and harsh, “He’s not working for you. He’s a spy. He’s working for the Dark Lord.”
at least am a bit more level-headed than Harry of late. You're a coward. Nothing more, nothing less. You wouldn't have called them because you wouldn't have anything to gain from it.”
It takes time to notice her ragged state, from her disheveled hair, which hangs loosely from her ruined updo and falls over her face, to the bags under her eyes accentuated by smeared mascara; she's exhausted, but determined.
The eighth years had collectively begun meeting once a month in the Room of Requirements with the excuse of promoting Inter-House Unity. Their real motivations were largely access to alcohol, and time away from their studies to spend with others who had gone through similar experiences during the war. Last year’s Seventh Years had faced the brunt of the Carrows’ attentions, as they had been subjected to and taught the very worst, most complex Dark Magic over the course of their partial year. Headmistress McGonagall undoubtedly knew about their activities, but she turned a blind eye – they were all of age and she seemed to understand that they needed this outlet.
“Look, Malfoy, what I'm about to say changes nothing, but you still need to hear it. You need to understand that you can't go back to what you were. There's a price on your head that can only be paid with you alive, and I've seen you to be quite susceptible to the Imperius. Just… remember that before you try to run off, because you
, but who? We’d already found the spy in our midst but…
Charlie grabs me by the shoulder and pushes me back, “Harry lay off! It's us!”
“Draco, I expected more from you.”
“Remus. I'm-”
“What happened?” I nearly whisper.
The white-blonde boy Harry remembered meeting briefly in Diagon Alley stepped forward after Professor McGonagall’s departure.
As Malfoy stumbles backwards in shock, I throw out an arm behind him without much forethought, steadying him on instinct. He tosses a glare my way and takes a step to the side, out of arm’s reach before returning his gaze to the Black family home.
The hand I had cupped around my ear slips and my elbow hits the doorknob. I step back as the door flies open. The trio stands before me, Granger gripping the knob and Weasley just behind her. Potter hunches behind them like a shadow, turned away as he wipes his face.
“You wouldn't bloody dare,” I hiss, straightening my back in a small act of defiance against the icy fear that shot down my spine at his words. I find myself regarding him in a new light. I've always known he wasn't the perfect Golden boy that everyone believed him to be, but I had never thought him one to even
I know, because that image later became ingrained in my brain, that that creature was barely recognizable as the professor I once knew and admired, it's face sagging horrendously to one side, pulling on a bloody eye, and the skin dripping off of its thin bones. The figure’s presence chokes me up, my tongue stopping short of any words, on the edge of asphyxiation.
Ron kneels over Hermione’s body as she stirs.
Only Potter notices. His eyes are puffy and soft, curious. I turn away.
“Do you want to try reasoning with her?” I ask. As I clench my jaw in frustration my eyes lower down to Malfoy’s wrists. Past the matted fringe that sticks my forehead with sweat, I can see that they're still unnaturally pale despite the blood that threatens to stain his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, it's gone.
“Do you really believe that selfish elf would let the likes of you do away with anything of his?” I interject. Once again their eyes are on me; I shrug away the feeling of anxiety that comes with this.
Grabbing Malfoy by his yellowed collar, I bark, “What did you tell her?” But, Malfoy’s eyes are focused on the wall, as empty and dull as they seemed before.
Theo shrugged, aware of several pairs of eyes switching from the enticing display of intimacy before them all to him with interest, “I…might have had an inkling. Perhaps.” Theo shrugged and smiled mischievously at the group.
Constructive criticisms and comments are welcome and encouraged always ;D
“Expelliarmus!”
As we fly towards the castle, the green beams nearly blinding in the dark night, I think of everyone back at the Hogwarts. Is this a result of us leaving the castle? Do the deatheaters know that we’ve found a horcrux? Are they torturing my friends at this very moment?
I cut her off by nudging her lightly in the ribs with my elbow at the strange look on Malfoy’s ashen face as the words shiver through him. She looks up at me, then over to Malfoy, and back to me. She raises an eyebrow at my apparent care, but nods and drops the issue without another word.
Dumbledore lays a cold hand on my shoulder, “Harry, you promised to obey me. Will you deny me now?”
His eyelids have fallen only halfway closed in a paralyzed state and his skin dead and grey. I find my one hand buried in the cold leather that sticks to his back like a second skin, the other clenched around his loose grip of the motorcycle’s handlebar, my wand caught somewhere in between.
her voice again. The last time I heard that grating tone I was standing over her.
“Black? Isn't he Sirius’ brother?” Granger moves towards the door and I step out of the way.
“Shut up!” Hermione exclaims, a bright spell spilling from her wand and onto Walburga’s portrait. Ron leaps back from the painting as the lethal spell hits and I see Malfoy jump as well.
Malfoy’s wand wobbles unsteadily in his hand, but still,
I shake my head, my eyes falling to the floor, “No. I can't do that. I barely let Ron and Hermione come along and Molly would never allow it. Besides, you've got Hogwarts.”
I can’t breath. Why can’t I breath?
“What do you mean?” His voice sounds a little higher with this, “How can you expect more! I’ve been planning to kill you!”
“Oh of course I knew, Draco. Though, I must admit, most of your attempts to kill me did seem very foolhardy.” Dumbledore states this as a fact, plain as day.
Twisting my arms around, I successfully throw the other man off and kick him square in the stomach. As he stumbles backward, I hit him with a Stupefy.
him! Just fucking
Several moments passed and Draco’s tension mounted. Potter appeared to be thinking hard. Draco didn’t know what he’d do if his apology was thrown back in his face. He just wanted a chance, a real chance to become Potter’s friend, and this would be the deciding moment.
“Harry? Zip me up, will you? I can never reach the tiny sodding zippers on these stupid things. Makes me wonder why people wear them. Believe me when I say I'd never wear a dress voluntarily.”
Before Draco could shift to move towards him, Potter jeered, “It’s your dare, Malfoy. Are you coming over here or not?”
“Auntie?”
But the thought of Ginny’s terrified face as Arthur wrenched us apart, strong beautiful Ginny. It's enough to make someone kill.
I've never been good with Obliviate, but I can use it from time to time when necessary. I cast one now, saying clearly, “You came in to work, as usual, and worked your shift. You never saw us, or the customers after us. No customers showed up late, so you decided to close up early. Then you went home.”
“What the bloody hell were you doing!” Potter shouts, teeth bared. Weasley pushes past him to Granger, near the edge of the cluttered sidewalk.
He watched in amusement as his friend, Theodore Knott, set his drink aside and crawled across the circle a little unsteadily until he reached Neville Longbottom. Theo looked nervous, then seemed to steel himself. He lifted a hand and gently cupped Longbottom’s brightly blushing cheek, then kissed him on the lips. The kiss grew heated and Longbottom reached his hands to Theo’s hair, tangling his fingers and pulling Theo closer. Draco knew that Theo had developed a crush on Longbottom ages ago after they had nerded out over Herbology while in a study group together.
“The locket. Merlin how could I have forgotten. We've seen it!” She jumps to her feet, sending Potter backwards onto me.
Draco peppered kisses down Potter’s neck, biting intermittently, loving the feel of Potter’s body underneath his own. Potter whimpered, lost in the overwhelming intensity of Draco’s ministrations. Never before had Potter felt such incredible sensation from any form of intimacy, especially not from mere snogging. He wanted more,
With my blood boiling and palms itching to be around the foul bastard’s throat, I could hardly allow myself to watch him for the rest of the walk. I’d have strangled him. But, unfortunately, I know he’s not responsible. He knows it, too. Maybe he’d’ve even said that he wasn't and I wouldn't have believed him.
“What?” Hermione snorts, “Did you tell her about a secret crush? Don't worry I won't tell.”
“I did tell you I was in the Astronomy Tower with Dumbledore when Malfoy arrived. But, Dumbledore… asked something of me. He wanted my help, to find one of Voldemort’s horcruxes.”
ever betray You-know-who?”
“What the bloody hell?”
Granger’s jaw is a harsh line as she says, “Anything we’ll need.”
Malfoy clams up and drops the flask. He scoots back towards the bed, eyeing the floor.
I place a hand on the wall closest to me and I take weighted steps towards the door. The hinges squeak as it budges open and a deep voice echoes off the stone walls, now silenced.
“Very clever, Draco.”
I suppose I am expecting something, or at least hoping, so finding a piece of ink stained parchment, a letter and an envelope sends a thrill through my body. They're pressed into the wood they have been lost there for ages, forgotten. I pick up the envelope first, delicately. It's addressed to Sirius, mailed from Godric Hallow. My heart stutters. It must be from them, isn't it? I smooth the letter out and begin to read an account, from my mother, of her new life as a mom. The letter is warm and hopeful, full of sentiments long foreign to this world.
For a moment I thought, maybe, just maybe, Snape could have done
“In fact I do. The poison? It could’ve ended up with anyone. In fact, I believe it was Mr. Weasley who consumed it.
“…Yes?” Harry prodded, curious.
Potter rocked his hips up into Draco’s, biting his lip simultaneously. Draco was momentarily stunned by his movement, and Potter brought his hands to Draco’s hips, gripping them firmly. He rocked against Draco again, harder, panting.
“-io!“ I curse, “Come back! Come back and fight you bloody bastard!”
Malfoy snatches the wand with seeker speed and precision, nodding curtly and continuing up the stairs.
?” As Potter speaks I can see the spittle spraying from his mouth and dribbling down his bottom lip with disgust.
Relief threatened to overwhelm Draco. Shaking slightly, he took the boy’s warm, callused hand. He looked down at it in surprise. He had never felt a hand so rough - he would have to find out how it had gotten this way.
“I can’t be sure, maybe ten minutes ago?”
The only thing is, I'm not sure I do.
Draco took a deep breath. “I’ve only heard about the Weasleys from my family, and they…Well, they have a certain opinion about how wizards and witches are supposed to conduct themselves. Especially pure-blood families, but the Weasleys don’t act like most pure-blood families do. So my family always taught me to look down on them and others like them,” Draco explained. He felt like his words were jumbling themselves up on his tongue, twisting this way and that as he tried to express his thoughts.
I want to push down the heat curling inside of me for them. I need to protect them. I can't have them waltz out on a foolhearted mission with me. I can't let emotion rule my life. I don't even know where I'm going. I have no leads.
“No. No it can't be,” My hands shake at my sides, “I- I thought- I thought no one else was going to
As I scramble to my feet they disapparate in a whirl of wind.
“But wait, didn't we throw it away?”
The door flies open and, from it, emerges Draco Malfoy, high nose, snooty voice and all.
His fingers trace over the wall gently, solemnly.
Malfoy’s hand quivers, “I will do it.”
The man sitting farthest to the left casts a glance at me, his eyes so blue they appear white, like blank orbs with small black pupils. As his hand moves oh so slightly inside his too long sleeves, my hand goes to my forehead, then my eyes to Hermione’s and Ron’s faces, and, worst of all, Malfoy’s, all unglamoured.
Potter’s expression seemed to clear. As Potter opened his mouth to speak, Draco braced himself for rejection as though expecting a physical blow.
Without another word, I stand up and turn, never looking back as I shut the bedroom door behind me.
Bellatrix pulls Malfoy by his collar, but he remains on the floor, “Draco, up! Now!”
I feel jumpy, alert, and after pacing all four corners of the room yearn for a bigger space to roam. I open the door to the sitting room quietly, hearing snoring from the other end. Malfoy is in the same corner, tucked up within a blanket, his knees in his armpits no doubt. But that's not what draws my attention in the room- it's Ron and Hermione.
The moment of silence draws out between, thick and pensive.
Ron and Hermione hesitantly step forward.
“Do you feel it?” he whispers. “The darkness in this house?”
My legs run numb and the hard ground hits my knobby knees.
“If I am to do this, I will do it properly,” he growled, his voice low.
I almost laugh at the thought of it.
Scrimgeour stands from his wooden chair, picking up a satchel from the floor. He extends a hand but his handshake is as unreturned as his remark. He let's out a barely perceptible breath and turns to leave through the front door, making me remember at a seconds notice that I am not merely a fly on the wall. I'm here, and I'm not wanted.
Remus jumps off of the beast, ankle deep in the murky water, brandishing his wand. He steps forward looking all too cautious, “Hagrid, is… is he dead?”
Draco suppressed a growl and chose not to reply. Instead, he stood up, walked to Potter’s position, then neatly knelt in front of him.
“Malfoy boy, eh? What’re you doing so far from home?” the man asks in a  the man asks in a gruff voice, ignoring the fact that Malfoy clearly can’t answer with the tight fist around his throat.
He walks forward on a slight limp, and extends his right arm. I gulp down a sliver of guilt at seeing the purple rings on his wrists and biceps, not even forgotten when I remember what’s practically engraved into his father's left arm. It's not about what he's done, it's about what
, I think. Still, I nod and respond, “We’ll find a way to get back into the castle soon,” but Dumbledore looses balance and slumps onto the ground.
“Well,” Hermione sighs and digs a hand into her hair, “There's only one place I can think of to go.”
It’s not until Malfoy comes forward to inspect the odd object as well, that a dusty creature raises itself out of the carpet and rises above us. My first instinct is to grab the person closest to me, Hermione, and pull them behind me; her screams are cut off as the zombified figure of Albus Dumbledore charges at us, arms out. Walburga’s infamous painting awakens consequently, her shrieks echoing throughout the house to join Hermione’s.
,” She hisses with a slimy smile, “I don't know if I could fit that many boys in my toilet.”
“Molly! Ginny! Somebody, help!”
The locket now feels heavy around my neck and I pull it from underneath my nightshirt. I tucked it there last night, afraid that Malfoy, or the death eaters who are possibly looming, might take it. It glimmers like pure gold from the depths of Gringotts, holding immeasurable value. Through the crystal cover a snake swims through a green lake, frozen in time. My fingers shake as I hold it, my thumb pressed into the clasp as I open it for the first time.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe our dear Horace was right and I could use a little help in potions,” Harry considered still out loud. If he was being honest, he’d rather spend time with just Draco anyway than with half of Gryffindor. Draco had something calming about him.
Harry opened his mouth to protest but got interrupted.
“Ok, now write.”
Harry rolled his eyes as he made his way around the blanket to walk over to Draco. But then he motioned at Draco to come closer which he did but with a very disapproving look.
“I just didn’t want to risk you attacking me from behind and hexing me,” Harry answered honestly and walked with Draco in the direction of the dungeons. For a second Harry thought he caught something like a satisfied smirk on Draco’s lips.
Grumpily he got up and walked out of the dorms glaring at the too loud wizards. He kept walking away and up the stairs until the noise faded. Now he was walking along a dark, deserted hall, - it was weirdly familiar somehow - the only sound to be heard, was his own footsteps echoing from the walls. His eyelids felt heavier than usual and just as he was taking the idea of sleeping on the ground into actual consideration, a big wooden door with a glass doorknob appeared in front of Draco.
“Harry is able to see Malfoy’s dreams,” Ron said drily.
I snort and begin to pick at my nails absentmindedly. How little these three truly know, and yet the fate of the Wizarding World is meant to rest in their hands. How pitiable.
There were a couple soft giggles in response, and many widened eyes, before as a group they turned back towards the intertwined young men.
“What the hell, Harry?”
Malfoy stiffens, “Of course I don't want that.”
“Suppose you are,” he says blankly. His eyes are emotionless in a way that speaks measures.
“I don’t need to be saved! I
“Well take a look around you, Potter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have my wand pointed at your chest and you’re trying to convince me to switch loyalties? My loyalty is to Voldemort!”
As Draco deepened the kiss once more, he pushed his weight forward until they both lost their balance. Potter toppled backwards with Draco on top of him, their audience of astonished peers utterly forgotten. Potter’s glasses clattered to the floor unheeded. Draco straddled Potter’s hips, gratified to feel that Potter was as hard as he already was.
Twisting the purple sack across her bust, Granger points her wand at my head. My heart beats for a moment before I realize she's only removing the glamours from both Potter and me. My skin feels completely free of any kind of magic or charm. Realizing what this means, I hastily tug the sleeves of my robe down, concentrating for a brief moment, hoping that none of them notices.
“I was looking through Sirius' things and I was thinking about Dumbledore and- the locket,” Potter’s voice is shaky. “It's a fake, look!”
I slow my march to a creep up the stairs at the sound of Malfoy’s voice and- it must be- Hermione’s. The boy’s drawl reverberates off the walls, quiet and wispy, but demanding.
My skin itches and I strongly desire to throw a curse. I focus my mind on breaking free off this spell, but to no avail. My blood boils just
, as if the word itself was as dirty as the people. He sneers and rubs his hands up and down his arms, which are prickled with goose skin. “
“What did you do to that thing?” Weasley stares dumbfounded, but Granger spares barely a second to explain the expansion charm. After a moment she pulls out stacks of old clothing: pants, sweatshirts, even tennis shoes.
“What ever do you mean?”
“What do you mean?” I scoff, nonchalant. “I was at the wedding, you bumbling idiot.”
’s apology and start over. Draco’s words had surprised him, and he looked forward to finding out what other surprises lay in store for him with this strangely formal boy.
Suddenly the gleam of the locket dries out and it sits dully in my hand, no more valuable than an old stone from the bottom of the Great Lake.
“We thought you’d-” Granger stops.
As the two shuffle out of the alley, I make to follow them, but Weasley grabs me by the wrist, making me stop before leaving. “You didn't do it, did you? Summon those death eaters?” he asks.
Above my head, breaking through the haze of the clouds, is an electric green, slithering snake. The light of it is blazen and it’s edges fade into the dark of the night sky.
Ron and Hermione release my arm and take several steps back; I hear their breaths echoing into the night. Malfoy jerks his arm from my hand without a word, looking around himself with an unimpressed expression on his face. Shivers run down our spines from the brittle cold.
“The necklace, however,” Dumbledore continues, “I can’t imagine how you managed to pull that one off.”
He hoped things would turn out well for his friend. They were both a bit drunk, but they clearly showed equal interest in continuing their intimacy at the moment.
“Then we'll go with you.” Hermione wears the same stubborn mask but her eyes begin to water.
“Malfoy,” Granger scowls, nostrils flared. “Eavesdropping are we?”
He grabbed Potter by the arm and dragged him into a nearby empty classroom, glad that the day’s classes were done.
Several pairs of feet dart up the stairs. Ron and Hermione are windswept and dirty.
When Hermione saw him, she wanted him dead. Ron had to hold her back, protectively seizing her wand, but his actions had no justification. My explanation; the words felt like poison on my lips. He
Remus’ hands shake as he grabs Tonks by the shoulders and presses his forehead to hers and allows her tears to flow unabashedly. He shushes her softly.
“Yeah well, here’s the reality of it: not everyone is going to be okay and safe.” I laugh scornfully. “We might as well sleep at some point because safe is a long way off. Dumbledore might have tried to convince us that this is all well and good, but we’re on their own in this.” I notice my voice raising volume.
The door creaks open and I shove him forward. “We haven't got all night. They're still looking for us.”
Hermione gapes at me open-mouthed as the locket falls to the floor with a crack. The old, underused pipes leak from the ceiling, drip, drip, dripping onto the tiled floor.
Someone cleared their throat loudly and the two young men broke apart, panting. They resettled themselves, Theo settling down next to Longbottom. Draco noted that Theo casually lowered a hand to Longbottom’s thigh and left it there. Longbottom didn’t object, instead he placed his own hand over the back of Theo’s and twined his fingers through his.
“Wouldn't you like to know.”
The spell hits me like a dunk into ice-cold water, pulling me straight through the haze and back to a rightful mind in one sharp, too quick tug at the temple.
“No buts, Harry. Go.”
“What for? You don't think they know, do you?”
Dumbledore lands his broom inside of the Astronomy Tower and I follow in suit. The Dark Mark is hanging directly over the Astronomy Tower but the room is empty. They must be here somewhere. They
Ron snorted beside Harry.
“Then do it. You’re a smart boy, Draco. You know I cannot defend myself. Why don’t you.”
Malfoy’s arm sets ironclad, his face wash of emotion, and eyes steely. He takes two robotic steps forwards and peels his lips back. “Avada Kedavra!”
“The cupboard!” she exclaims, hand flying to her mouth. “That’s where I’ve seen it before! The real locket of Slytherin!”
My anger quickly gives way to desperation. I hastily take another step back, looking over my shoulder calling out to Hermione, but when I turn around, Remus is standing over me, his eyes wide and his jaw on the ground.
Granger then proceeds to push him into a corner, whispering quietly, but intently. Her voice sounds soothing, almost, and Potter’s growling dulls to a low hum. Weasley looks at me with a side eye and I turn away.
The students sitting in the circle watched them in amazement, and not a little admiration. Most of the onlookers had not expected anything of the sort happening between Draco and Potter, though a few – namely Pansy, Theo, Luna, Ron, Hermione, and Blaise – looked on with amused, knowing expressions.
Granger ducks into a thin, dirty alley, and we follow.
“What is it, Malfoy?” I can feel the weight of his wand in my back pocket.
I shouldn’t have told Ron and Hermione and Ginny about this, I shouldn’t have given them any information. This should be my burden to carry and mine alone. I don’t want them to get hurt. Any of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Against the opposite wall is a fireplace and a brown sofa. There are two closed doors in the parlor that I recognize as leading to a bathroom and the old room that Ginny and Hermione shared so long ago. Or was it only a couple of years?
I watch Arthur, Ginny, and Fred help George and Hagrid inside carefully, Ron holding Molly back lest she keen over, and I wonder; how is it that, even when we’ve taken every precaution, everything can go so wrong?
Suddenly, I can move again, but I can’t will myself to. The space where my heart is supposed to be feels like a black hole; empty and all-consuming. In my head I can hear the last words he ever spoke to me.
“Sir-”
I can't stop my heart from beating out my chest again out of fear and, as it falls open, both sides sliced down the middle. Truth be told I'm expecting something more exciting, and the slip of paper that falls out is a bit more that anticlimactic.
I shiver as we pass through what once was Hogwart’s barrier.
“We both do.” Ron squeezes the hand on Hermione’s shoulder, “We are coming with you. Whether you like it or not.”
Behind it we sit for not even a moment to catch our breaths – no, to get a feel of reality. Ron raises himself above the counter sporadically to throw curses at our enemies.
“But I did kill him.”
had the advantage.
“Don't think this changes anything,” I hiss, raising my wand ever so slightly, Neville’s mouth quivers open, like he's about to say something, before he gives out and falls over from the knees. It's only when his head hits the ground that I notice the edges of his hair whitening.
_________________________________________________
“Harry!” Granger shouts. She almost jumps forward, a bit angry and a bit scared.
I open the door fully and Malfoy stares up at me in astonishment.
The man moves past her unconscious body and his hands wrap around Malfoy’s throat, catching him before he could run, clearly disregarding Ron – a Weasley – as the spell caster.
Malfoy seems to take steam in that statement, “Of course not. There’s a whole lot of
Harry stumbled backward, throwing his arms out wildly to catch his balance when Malfoy let him go. He’d been caught off-guard, having not expected someone to try and jump him here at Hogwarts - not with Dudders back in the muggle world. Harry readied himself for a fight, wand forgotten.
Please leave any suggestions or constructive criticisms in the comment section and I'll make sure to get back to you ;)
He stares at me a moment, head cocked to the side and pupils dilating as if he's just discovered the secrets of the universe, “Harry move back.”
“What's the plan now?” Ron asks, fidgeting with the end of his shirt. I can see the absence of his family getting to him already, maybe I'm the only one.
I grimace, anger taking forefront in my mind, and slap the wand into his hand. “Fine, I'll just tell them I lost it. Seems like a Weasley thing to do.”
Anyway, please leave a comment letting me know (I loveeee constructive criticism) and kudos if you liked this! Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
The girl shoves her wand into a small purple sack and whips her head around. “You don't get to ask questions,
I shake my head and lament, “Snape was a spy, Hermione! He betrayed Dumbledore and who knows who else is working for Voldemort in the order. We can't share this information.”
“Then who's going to, Hermione? Certainly not the Order, they don't even know about the Horcruxes!”
“It doesn't matter what we deserve,” she says, eyes downcast. “For all we know we’re the only ones still

Malfoy’s grey eyes then grow wider under the moonlight. Hermione and Ron step onto the stoop, raising their wands to the door. “Welcome to Grimmauld place, your ancestral home.”
I bound around the corner, down the row of stalls, and open up the farthest one where, in the corner, sits Draco Malfoy, bounded at the arms and legs.
Whirling winds and Walburga's gross shouts fill my ears as none of us are able to speak or yell, all except for Ron whose voice roars out, “We didn't kill him!” The words cut through the ghost like butter, and it disintegrates into the dust pile it came from. A distinctive aura of fear wavers in the air around us.
Has their Chosen One finally gone mad? Have their pressures got to him?
“He isn't going to recognize you. My glampours don't falter, they should last you through the night.” she pushes me out of the way and climbs up the stairs, a thin book in her hand. Weasley follows, sneaking past in a less obtrusive way. Potter stops upon approaching me, examining the glamours closely.
“Dare,” Draco said after a moment. He hoped he didn’t come to regret this decision, though he doubted his hope would come true. Theo knew him too well.
Draco drew back from the kiss. He looked down into Potter’s triumphant eyes and noted how the green had darkened with lust. Potter’s dark cheeks were rosy, his lips were slightly swollen, his skin glistened with sweat. He was breathtakingly beautiful, and in that moment, Draco wanted this to never end, wished he could freeze time to live in this moment for all time.
I didn't want him to be the one to come with me, in fact I'd begged him not to. What would I do now if he was dead?
“He hasn’t got the guts, Severus.”
“Hermione!”
I stalk closer, and press my wand to Neville’s throat accusingly without thinking.
Draco was overcome with such a strong emotion at hearing Potter beg that he almost didn’t comprehend his request. He bit Potter at the base of his neck, just above his collarbone, taking his time, before lifting his face to meet Potter’s lips once more.
My jaw quivering, I sneer. “You. Don’t. Know me.”
“I don't know.”
I've never seen Malfoy look so pale; his skin is like crepe paper. He's so delicate, like a cracked piece of China, or a thin, chipped cup as he pretends he didn't just break down to pieces.
“Harry what's the note say?”
The frizzy-haired girl makes her way down the stalls again, towards the rusting sinks where Ron sits, eyes trained on the wall opposite of me. Through the stained glass windows the sun is beginning to rise, caught in a marred aura of red and orange, the light of which reflects in the puddles on the floor.
, I think. I miss the comforting feel of my best friends’ arms wrapped around me as I try to block out the world. That oppressive silence, that uncooperative stubbornness-
His childhood bed sits in the center of the room, headboard pressed to the west wall. I take a seat on its sloping side, just as I used to, and close my eyes. I breathe in deeply as if in doing so I can absorb all that I have left of him. As tears begin to prickle my eyes I stand abruptly, leaning onto the wall with one arm.
My mother’s face glowed so brightly from the wallpaper, and mine right below hers. I used to take pride in my portrait. Now it's scorched to hell and back.
“If you don’t mind, we’d like to get back to the game, you two. It’s your turn, Draco,” Theo said in an arch, but amused voice.
“God bloody damn it!” I scream as I run to shield the muggle waitress. Before doing anything else I stun her, then block a blood-boiling curse aimed at my head.
As the hour grew later, a game of Truth or Dare had started. This would be the third game since the parties had begun, so most everyone involved was familiar with the rules. At the start, everyone had made a Wizard’s Pact not to share what happened or what secrets were revealed to anyone outside of the group involved in the game. If anyone refused a Dare or Truth, they had to take a drink – though the size of the drink was up to the individual so no one felt pressure to drink more than they were comfortable. Draco had decided to merely sip at his firewhiskey tonight, enjoying the slow build of heat in his stomach.
He grinned, and silver eyes met green, “I’m Draco. Welcome to the wizarding world, Harry, you’re in for a lot of surprises.”
been me who’d summoned those death eaters, I wouldn't have used something so obviously traceable.”
At my side Granger absently flips through a moth eaten journal she's found in a chest. “Looks like he wanted to be a death eater. Why would
“Romania. Just got back with my cousin Charlie.”
I don't want to feel any kind of pity for him, but I was there that night on the Astronomy tower. If anyone would know that Malfoy wasn't truly, honestly – well, let's just say I know the true story.
Her lips are warm and soft for the moments they're on mine but she turns her head quickly, words on the tip of her tongue. The staircase creaks ominously and I throw Ginny back, pulling out my wand to find that it's only… Malfoy.
“Anything we’ll need for what?” I grumble, expecting nothing out of it. The three of them share worried looks. Gryffindors.
Potter nods. He emerges from the old bedroom looking red and snotty. “He didn't mention him much, though.”
One part stumps me, however, where Mom writes about Dumbledore. This must have been during the beginning of the war, with mom and dad in hiding, but what did they know about Dumbledore. And why did they meet with Bathilda Bagshot?
“You need the help – ”
“Mad Eye’s dead.”
The blond’s hand falls to the purplish red bruises scattered up his arms, pressing and pinching, emitting small hisses of pain.
him to get information, and we certainly can't defeat You-know-who on our own. We don't even know where to start! We know nothing!” She stares at me, imploring.
I don’t understand, but I have to obey.
it will be at a time when we're not being hunted ourselves!”
“What was that? A whore? Going to bed the Dark Lord to death?” I joke, mostly for my own pleasure, but also to hide the scorn of being the one left clueless again. But what did I expect? A sudden show of comradery from the Mudblood?
“What did he say, Myrtle?” I demand.
Draco sucked at the spot for a long moment, then bit down without warning, sucking at the skin between his teeth. Potter bit his lip, closing his eyes, unable to mask an uneven moan in response or to stop his hips from pressing upwards insistently against Draco. Draco groaned, every exhalation, every sound struck him with an almost physical blow, blazing through him, making his cock twitch in excitement.
“What does that mean?”
“Charlie-” I start but, really, what can I say? He bounds off in the other direction towards Molly, conceding to curiosity and grief.
He continued, “I’ve been thinking about it and…that’s kind of narrow-minded. And I’m sorry. If Weasley is your friend, then he must have good qualities worthy of friendship. I shouldn’t have acted how I did. I…”
He leaned forward and gripped the front of Potter’s robes, pulling him into a kiss. Potter was evidently surprised at Draco’s daring. His lips parted slightly and Draco deepened the kiss. He slid his tongue along Potter’s, savoring the taste, the feel. He raised a hand to cup the side of Potter’s head, sliding his fingers among the messy curls and tugging firmly on a handful.
The Minister gazes up the stairs, “Oh, hullo. I didn't hear anyone there. You must be a relation of the Weasley’s, am I correct?”
___________________________________________________
“Wait,” I shout. I dig into my pocket and pull out the hawthorn wand, tossing it over. “Hermione’ll need it to make the- uh-  charms work correctly. For your glamours. Just, don't get any funny ideas.”
We sit in silence until a waitress, a tall girl with buzzed hair and a pinched nose, lazily asks what we’d like to drink. Her nostrils flare just begging the question.
The order fixes me with apprehensive glares.
“You promise, that if I tell you what I know, you can kill him?”
Malfoy blushes and backs away. I gaze elsewhere.
Harry glanced down at the proffered hand, then up at his face defiantly and declared, “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.”
Three more deatheaters walk in behind Lestrange and climb the stairs. I can not see them properly until they reach the top floor.
“But you can, Draco. The order will protect you, and your family if need necessary. Please, just let us help.”
“Draco will go through with the task-”
“Everything's traceable.”
“Harry what happened? We were worried you left with Malfoy,” Granger says. Well that's a stupid assumption, why would Potter ever do a thing like that?
Myrtle flushes herself down with a squeal as I wobble on my heels.
Unnoticed by the preoccupied wizards, Neville leaned over to Theo and said in a quiet, awed voice, “Did you
I pull the Invisibility cloak over by body and mount the broom. Looking to my side, I half-expect Dumbledore to be falling over again, but he’s steady, eyes determined.
“Probably because he's dead. Murdered, or so I've heard” I say with a sneer. “But I've always thought the circumstances a bit suspicious. Death eaters don't like to talk of him often anymore.”
One of them I recognize as Greyback, the werewolf, but the other two I do not know.
Hermione lets out a startled shriek before she gets the chance to answer, and I spin around, wand out. Malfoy plasters himself against the wall, forehead gleaming with sweat, as a white mist enters the parlor like a gust of wind, landing in the center of the room in the form of a weasel. The animal's mouth falls open and the words slip through like silk, “
“What haven't you told us, exactly?”
“Harry.” Hermione whispers.
Draco watched and waited, biding his time. It was a few days until he finally found a time when Potter wasn’t accompanied by the Weasley boy, and took his chance.
!” I grab Malfoy’s collar and pull him to eye level. He doesn’t move. He doesn’t even speak. He just stares with his unblinkingly blank eyes. They threaten to swallow me up.
“Malfoy, wake up.” The blond coughs and opens his eyes halfway, but doesn't speak.
Lowering myself onto crossed legs in front of him, I respond, “Suppose I'm used to it.”
Dumbledore? I knew there was something, but Merlin. This?
He looks so that no one would even think that the spell had done him in, that he'd fallen from this building without an ounce of fear or life left in him, that the blood spilling from his cracked skull is no longer warm. Dumbledore’s limbs are twisted inhumanely under the side of his body, but his head is turned up to the stars, eyes open.
“What are you going on about?” Weasley voice grates against my eardrums as I turn to face the door looming at the end of the wall. I walk with my arm and fingers outstretched until they graze the nameplate.
“Because I care about you, Harry, believe it or not!”
“Where is he?”
in the red-orange flames, reflecting a burning red so much more fitting for the event than the original blackening purple. They were like skeletal demons risen to life from a cemetery or the pits of hell; what I should have been. What I should be.
I finally heave myself up and lean against the doorframe. My internal conscious argues for telling Ron and Hermione, but I can't bring myself to even imagine relaying the tale after such a night. Hermione doesn't need anyone or anything else to agonize over, and I definitely don't want to be the one to add to her worries.
“I don't want you dead.” Hermione insists, leaving her arm outstretched and offering, but Malfoy scoffs indifferently.
“I don't know what you're planning, but you can't win this war on your own, Mr. Potter.”
“Ah,” Scrimgeour ejaculates, “And where are you from?”
“Fine then,” she huffs, “Take me with you if you need so much help fighting this war on your own.”
Then I find myself sprawled on the yellowed bedding of Grimmauld Place with no concept of time, dripping with sweat. My forehead pulses, a more physical pain this time, though my soul is crying out.
But, the traitorous truth was, as Ron pointed out, that we couldn't let the Ministry find him. We'd made the mistake of going to them too long ago to go back. The Minister couldn't be trusted. Fudge would take this as proof, hard-hitting evidence that
Malfoy looks thoughtful and wraps the blanket around him. For a moment I allow myself to ignore him and who he is and everything he's done.
“Please,” Potter whimpered, his voice breathy. “Please, Malfo-y.” He pulled limply at Draco’s chin, tugging him back to his mouth.
As I shoot curse after curse part of the ceiling breaks and a pile of wood chips fall at my feet. My screams reverberate off the walls and into the night.
Draco looked over at Potter and excitement lit a spark in his belly. The room was illuminated by the glow of several large fireplaces in the back wall of the room, and Potter’s face almost glowed in the soft firelight. His face showed surprise, his mouth slightly open as he stared at Theo.
“Voldemort and his death eaters.”
Hey guys, I know this is kind of a restatement of the canon chapter, but there are some differences that make this pretty important for how I'm developing this fic. I hope you liked it anyway! Like in this chapter, throughout this fic I'm going to be using stuff from the books and the movies for canon info.
Malfoy steps up with shaky legs, and I follow him, more confidently, I hope. The moment our feet step safely onto the thin carpet, the door slams shut of its own accord, and I feel myself propelled into Malfoy’s back. The entrance room looks just the same as it always did; the flickering, mellow light of the gas lamps reveal the thick dust and cobwebs that have been known to paint the walls. Even the nasty umbrella stand is in the same place.
