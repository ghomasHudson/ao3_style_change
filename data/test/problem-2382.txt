“Sounds like your worst nightmare.”
“Did you divine any greater insight from the article after reading it again, Minerva?” asked Albus Dumbledore casually.
Harry grinned and shook his head. “No, you were amazing. Everything about that was amazing.”
“Preferably indoors,” Draco chipped in, smiling slightly. Harry laughed.
“Language, Mr Malfoy,” Liv warned.
“The job was fine.” Liv shrugged. “But after my dad died, I wanted to come home. I missed my family.”
Luna sat her buckets of paint on the floor and pointed at what looked like a signature at the bottom of one of the messages.
Pushing the Dursleys out of his mind, Harry focused on his beautiful surroundings. Long lines of apple trees stretched out in all directions, obscuring Harry’s view of the nearby village and Burrow. Their century-old branches sagged under the weight of the swollen red Braeburns, ready and begging to be eaten. He reached out for one particularly fat apple dangling from a low branch just above his head. With a slight twist, he plucked the fruit free from its stalk and inspected it closely for blemishes before taking a bite, his mouth already salivating as his teeth sunk into its soft flesh. Sweetness spread across his tongue and he licked his lips, savouring the sweet-tart flavour and crisp bite of the delicious fruit.
Ron looked down at his costume again and back up at his girlfriend.
he snapped. “Stop trying to mother me and just leave me be.”
“I’m not ready yet,” Harry rushed out.
“Harry!”
“How do you know all of this?” asked Harry.
“Here, this’ll work better than a quill,” he said. Harry took the proffered pen and stared at it.
“Right,” said Ron, clapping his hands together. “Hermione, Ginny and I are off to the Prefects’ carriage. Catch you later, Harry.”
Harry let out a weary sigh. He knew that it would come back around to Draco at some point. “I’m not dating his family, Ron. They’ve got nothing to do with this.”
“You’re as blind as a flobberworm.” Draco scrutinised his reflection in the mirror that sat on his bedside table. “What do you think? Do I suit them?”
“Whatever you make of it,” she countered testily. “I know that the last couple of years have been difficult, but you are a young man, Draco, you still have your whole life ahead of you. You must take opportunities when they present themselves and use them to your advantage. See this as an opportunity.”
“You think?” Draco breathed. Harry nodded slightly.
“What do you mean?”
She threw the students a cheeky wink and the three girls bowed to rapturous applause, most of which Liv suspected was meant for Luna. After each group had auditioned, only one person was left to perform. Liv had noticed Draco becoming increasingly agitated with each passing audition but she couldn’t hold off the inevitable any longer for him. She looked up from her notes and gave him a sympathetic smile.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t even realise he’d been holding, but just as he was about to thank him, Ron spoke up again. “Malfoy might say that he cares about you—he might even have convinced himself that he does—but he’ll let you down, Harry. I don’t want that to happen, but it will. He might be trying to be a better person for you, but people don’t change. It’s just in his nature.”
Harry chuckled and fell silent for a minute before saying hesitantly, “I don’t know what’s going on with you and your friends at the moment but...I think it’s pretty shitty that they didn’t come to check in on you.”
Harry frowned. “Uh, thanks.”
“I wouldn’t have fallen over in the first place if you hadn’t been manhandling me.”
“Of course, it is,” Draco sighed, trying to concentrate on his breakfast and ignore the stage whispers of the other students, some of whom stood on their tiptoes to take a better look at him at the Gryffindor table. “Do I even want to know what it says?”
“But all Death Eaters are Slytherins,” he sneered.
“You know, patience is a virtue, Phineas,” Albus called after him, winking at Minerva. She smiled at him and felt some of the tension that she had been carrying around all day ease a little. While a portrait was no substitute for the man, she was still glad of his company.
“Someone scribbled horrible graffiti all over my other one.”
“Then
“Well...yeah,” Ron shrugged. “But only so she and Harry can get back together. You’re by far the better actress.”
Harry stepped into the nearby compartment where he’d stowed their luggage before the train had departed. Inside, Neville and Luna were waiting for them.
Unsure of what else to do, Harry hovered awkwardly by his side, unwilling to leave him. Gradually, Draco’s breaths evened out and, slowly, he stood to his full height again, his face drenched in sweat.
But he retired years ago, how on earth did McGonagall convince him to come out of retirement?”
Draco groped blindly, running his hand up Harry’s inner thigh before wrapping his fingers around Harry’s thick, hard cock and giving it an experimental squeeze. Harry’s response was immediate: groaning with unbridled pleasure he thrust his hips forward into Draco’s tight fist while Draco swallowed his low moan with another searing kiss. Their movements were clumsy and uncoordinated at first, but soon they found their rhythm, pumping each other’s cocks in sync as their lips ghosted over each other, panting and moaning into each other’s mouths, pushing and pulling each other closer and closer to climax. As Draco quickly tumbled towards the point of no return, the rest of the world around him seemed to disappear. All he could think about, all he wanted to feel, was Harry’s hand stroking his cock; Harry’s hot, panting breaths against his skin; the delectable, mewling noises Harry was making…Draco was completely lost in him, willingly consumed by the feel of him beneath his fingers and lips and tongue. This was bliss. This was heaven. He didn’t deserve it, but he didn’t care, he just needed this so badly... to feel wanted... to feel Harry.
“Draco and Harry, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G…”
Draco rolled his eyes and held the script out for Harry to share with him. Harry beamed at him and smacked an affectionate kiss on his cheek before resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and settling down to rehearse the scene properly this time. Draco’s cheek burned from where Harry had kissed him and he couldn’t help the pleased smile that spread across his face. Things at Hogwarts might not be easy but he could definitely get used to this.
“Please, Harry,” she asked gently, her voice laced with concern. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
“No surprise there,” Harry mumbled through a mouthful of food.
Myra grunted in response and tossed the parchment that she had been reading onto her chaotic desk.
There was another round of applause and then chatter broke out amongst the students. Harry peered into the hall again and said, “Looks like the ceremony’s over. I’ll go in first and you follow in a minute.”
“I still can’t believe you got made a prefect,” Harry smirked at Ginny, who grimaced.
of melting snow hitting the ground. In the distance, he thought he heard the flutter of wings, probably from one of the albino peacocks that graced their expansive gardens. The absence of sound was a welcome relief to the neverending racket of Muggle London. There were no car engines rumbling or tyres screeching, nor people screaming or footsteps of millions of strangers thundering past. Here, it was peaceful. Here, he could hear himself think.
“How’s the play coming along?” Hestia asked conversationally, taking a sip from her own drink.
“Yes, Professor,” the classroom replied in a muted chorus. Liv smiled warmly at them.
Harry and everyone else in the marble hall watched in stunned silence as Mrs Weasley proceeded to have a heated argument with the goblin, each gesticulating wildly as their voices rose higher and higher. Even Ginny, whose fiery temper was the stuff of legend, stood quietly as her mother made perfectly clear how despicable she thought the bank was treating her children. After Mrs Weasley threatened to close the family vault, the goblin grudgingly conceded and said that Harry, Ron and Hermione would be permitted to make a withdrawal from the bank, but not without taking ‘extra precautions’ to ensure that there was not a repeat of what had happened the last time. The trio agreed to the terms, desperate to get this visit to the bank over with as quickly as possible.
“You’re a big softie, you are,” Hestia teased fondly, playfully nudging Liv with her elbow. “I’d have given him detention for the rest of term for swearing at me. So, what did he have to say for himself?”
When Harry finished his breakfast, Draco reluctantly relinquished his grip on Harry’s hand and they got to their feet. Harry slipped Ron a fistful of Galleons, requesting that he pay a visit to Honeydukes in order to top up their dwindling supply of sugar quills and pumpkin pasties. Ron grunted in response but pocketed the money without complaint. Wishing his friends a fun day at Hogsmeade, Harry and Draco quickly left the Great Hall together, pointedly ignoring the inquiring eyes of his friends that followed them in their wake.
“Hmm, anything in particular from the Dating Section that caught your eye?” Hestia asked lightly. Liv felt a blush creep up her cheeks.
We're finally here, people. It's the night of the big performance. Hope they break a leg.
Tom chuckled and winked at him. “Certainly not, Mr Potter.”
“Yeah, indoors would be better,” he agreed. “You want to come up to Gryffindor Tower?”
“A chance to get back together with Ginny!” he exclaimed. Harry stared blankly back at Ron.
“HARRY!”
“Are you messing about with my balls?” asked Harry suspiciously.
“I think so,” said Neville uncertainly.
“I wrote to you over the summer, but I didn’t hear back from you. I’m sorry about your father. That Ministry ruling was a farce, in my opinion.”
Draco’s laughter ended abruptly at those words. A long silence followed before Draco asked, “How long did they keep you in the cupboard for?”
Draco looked over his shoulder to where Harry and the others were still standing on the edge of the platform and was surprised to see Ginny (albeit nervously) introducing Theo to her mother. He felt a stab of inexplicable jealousy strike him then and quickly turned away from the scene. It’s not like he’d want Harry to introduce him to the Weasleys like that—he hated them. Well, maybe not
“Piss off, Malfoy,” he replied with a wry smile. Draco gave a dramatic sigh.
“I’m sure that he won’t let us down,” Hermione insisted.
Dennis’s jaw tensed but he said nothing, so Draco continued. “And former allegiances aside, we do have one other thing in common—”
“Well, then you need to get your eyes checked,” Harry sniped. Draco tsked and was silent for a few moments before speaking again.
“Of course, the saviour of the Wizarding world wouldn’t want to be seen walking beside an unsavoury character like myself,” Draco teased. “People might get the wrong idea and think that we were in cahoots.”
Harry waved off Hermione, Ron and Ginny as they headed towards the front of the train to sit with the other prefects, feeling a little lost without his friends by his side. Harry headed in the opposite direction, struggling down the narrow corridor with his pet carrier and trunk in tow. Peering through the glass-panelled doors into the compartments he passed, he wasn’t surprised to see that each of them were already full. Even less surprisingly—though no less embarrassing—a lot of people were staring back at him open-mouthed with shock while several others waved and pointed at him as he shuffled past. He hoped that he wouldn’t have to put up with that sort of behaviour all year, but there was little he could do about it either way. Just as he was beginning to worry that he wouldn’t find anyone to sit with, he paused when he spotted a familiar and friendly face sitting in one of the compartments. Knocking on the glass, he slid the door open and popped his head inside.
“Wow Mione, you look really beautiful,” he replied before quickly adding, “I mean, not that you don’t always look beautiful...”
“What the hell is going on?” asked Draco aloud as Harry scanned the room for his friends. He spotted Ron and the others near the centre of the room; Ron was now red in the face as he and Ginny screamed at each other while Hermione appeared to be babbling incoherently, tears streaming down her face as she did so.
“What did I say, Hermione? We can’t leave Harry unattended for more than a few minutes without something disastrous happening to him,” Ron joked. “Who’d have thought that crossing paths with a lion would be the least dangerous encounter we’d have today? Those fire seeds should come with a health and safety warning!”
“I think she liked it!”
A loud scream shortly followed by uproarious laughter drew Harry and Draco’s attention away from each other and they turned to see what all the commotion was. Neville, who was now completely bald, sat staring at his reflection in his mirror with a horrified expression.
“Something’s run up my trouser leg!” squealed Draco, kicking his legs out and howling in unbridled panic as a small lump scurried up his leg towards his crotch. Harry looked up to see Asha’s cage conspicuously empty, so he quickly rolled off of Draco and pulled him to his feet. Draco proceeded to dance on the spot, tearing at his clothes. “Get it off me! Get it off!”
Myrtle cleared her throat to get their attention and floated in front of them. “As much as I’ve enjoyed your company, it’s not much fun watching you boys ride your broomsticks when I can’t join in. I think I’ll just head back to the castle.”
“And what will they do to you if they find out that you helped me?”
“Will I have to wear tights?” asked Ron.
In the two months since the Battle of Hogwarts and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Minerva McGonagall had been run ragged. Determined to have the school repaired and ready for the new influx of students come September first, she had divided her time between coordinating large portions of the castle being rebuilt, writing condolence letters to the families of students and staff members who had perished in the battle, as well as sending out acceptance letters to the new wave of students for the upcoming year. Her task was made doubly difficult considering the high volume of Muggleborn students who hadn’t received their letters the previous year, and a large number of students who, understandably, sought to repeat their seventh and final year.
Harry couldn’t believe it. Draco Malfoy offering to help Harry with anything was nothing short of miraculous. He wished that Colin Creevey was here with his camera to capture the moment.
Dennis paused his brushstrokes then but Draco didn’t look at him. Instead, he kept dabbing paint onto the set piece. “Believe me, hate and I have become well-acquainted with one another over the years. It can be a powerful motivator when you have nothing else. It also serves as an excellent distraction from other...less than pleasant emotions.”
He’d been sitting waiting in the deserted common room for a couple of hours now. Every time he heard the creak of the portrait door swing open, his stomach would clench and head would snap upwards, hoping that it was Ron finally returning from the Hospital Wing. So far, his wait had been a fruitless one. When he realised it wasn’t his best friend returning, Harry would immediately sink back into his chair and resume staring into the fire. The students who did return didn’t linger; they kept their heads bowed and scurried to their respective dorm rooms as quickly and quietly as possible.
“Where have you been?” she exclaimed, her voice slightly higher pitched than usual. “You missed the Sorting Ceremony!”
Harry (currently sporting bright red hair similar to the Weasleys) gritted his teeth in frustration at how dismissive Draco was being. “Based on my previous experience of threatening messages written outside Myrtle’s bathroom, I think it would be a big mistake to be so dismissive about this.”
“I didn’t know! Not for sure, not until—well…” Harry bowed his head, unable to look Ron in the eye then. “Ginny and I figured out between ourselves pretty quickly that we weren’t compatible, if you know what I mean. I do love her, just not in the way that she needs or deserves.”
“Like this,” he said, pulling one of the pillows out from under his head and tucking it under his hips. “I want to be able to see you.”
“Beyond searching and destroying Horcruxes and beating Voldemort, I didn’t spare much thought for what I was going to do with the rest of my life. Now, it’s all over and I’m just feeling a bit…”
Draco had merely shrugged in response, focusing on buttering his morning toast before their first lesson of the day. “I’m not surprised. He is a Gryffindor, after all. McGonagall wouldn’t punish one of her own too harshly.”
Draco knew that he shouldn’t be so antagonistic but he couldn’t help himself. Even though he hadn’t technically done anything wrong, he had still hoped that Theo would forgive him and that they would be on speaking terms by now. But Theo was famously stubborn and had pointedly ignored Draco for weeks now and his frustration finally got the better of him. The corners of Theo’s mouth turned down and he snapped his book shut. Draco focused on keeping his expression impassive and stood to his full height as his former friend kicked his legs off of his bed and approached him, shoulders squared and fists clenched.
Draco knew that he was weak. He knew that he was unkind and insecure and entitled. He was unworthy of the affections of someone as good and kind as Harry—he knew it and the rest of the world would never let him forget it. Draco’s morose thoughts spiralled as Myrtle rambled on and he began to feel increasingly uncertain about his next planned meeting with Harry. Myrtle stopped talking abruptly as she saw the worried expression on Draco’s face.
“You haven’t formed a resistance group in any shape or form?”
Draco’s expression was quite serious all of a sudden and Harry felt as though the air had been pulled from his lungs. Although he knew that Draco liked him (that much was obvious, even to Harry), he was so used to Draco’s flirtatious teasing that the sincerity of the statement took him aback somewhat. Draco’s eyes slid shut as Harry carded his fingers through his hair and pulled him closer again, kissing him gently at first, trying to convey in a kiss how much he cared about Draco because he didn’t have the words. There was a strong gust of wind then and as the branches swayed in the breeze, the tree seemed to sigh contentedly as Draco and Harry kissed each other soundly beneath it. Draco left a trail of gentle bites and open-mouthed kisses down Harry’s neck causing the pleasant ache between his legs to grow more intense and he moaned, rutting against Draco’s leg.
“There’s plenty to talk about!” Ron exclaimed. “I just stumbled across you in the bushes with this...this…”
Harry suppressed a groan and nodded vigorously in response. His breathing stuttered as Draco’s teasing bite turned gentle, pressing another open-mouthed kiss to Harry’s neck as his fingers slipped back beneath Harry’s trousers and boxers. When Draco wrapped his fingers around his cock, he couldn’t help the needy moan that escaped his lips. Draco quickly covered Harry’s mouth with his free hand, smothering another desperate whimper, while his other continued to run up and down Harry’s shaft.
“Would you really?” asked Neville, wide-eyed with hope.
Draco huffed out a laugh. “Sure, you keep telling yourself that. But just take a long, hard look at where your lone wolf routine will take you.”
Draco’s mouth suddenly went dry and wonderfully obscene images of Harry doing just that flitted through his mind. Obviously, that wasn’t what Harry had in mind, so he desperately tried pushing those thoughts aside and ignored the stirring in his trousers. Clearing his throat he said, “Yes, well...the Nimbus 2001 may be an older model but it’s far superior to the Firebolt in my opinion: better made and more reliable.”
“What’s your point?” Dennis asked.
“Yeah, I did!” he said irritably. “You need to be more careful, Myrtle. If I’d fallen off at this height, I would have died.”

Professor Switch eyed them both suspiciously for a moment before deciding to drop the matter. “Yes, well...today is merely an introduction to what we’ll be covering over the next year, so your wands won’t be required. Please, take your seats. Everyone else can come back into the classroom now! The lesson is about to begin.”
Goyle raised his hand a little higher but was unable to meet Ron’s eye. Everyone looked expectantly at Ron for his response, but he looked just as dumbfounded as his friends.
“Oh, yeah. See you later, Malfoy. Feel free to get lost between here and Hogwarts,” he sneered, earning him an amused laugh from Draco.
that you didn’t even have the guts to tell me, and I had to find out from Ginny instead?”
“Bollocks,” Harry snapped. “If this was all some plot concocted by Lucius to improve his social standing, then why is Draco so afraid of him finding out about us?”
. As such, a few changes have been made,” she simpered, handing a bright pink folder to Liv. “There will be no need for a Muggle Liaison Department anymore, so your Department has been dissolved, effective immediately. You and your staff now work for me in the newly-formed Muggle-Born Registration Commission. You are now Deputy Head of The Muggle-Born Registration Commission, quite a step up from your previous post.”
“Maybe.” Liv took a swig of her pint and noted as casually as possible, “Speaking of your parents, I’m surprised that they permitted you to go on this trip. How did you go about convincing them?” When Draco didn’t answer, her smile broadened. “It’s as I suspected. It looks like you’re already beginning to forge your own path in life.”
The stone door slid open and Draco marched inside, closely followed by Harry. Despite the common room being deserted, he headed straight for the nearby stairwell, which spiralled even deeper into the castle’s depths. Harry involuntarily shivered as they made their descent, their hot breaths misting in front of their faces on every exhale. When they finally reached the bottom of the stairwell, Draco pushed open the door to the seventh year boys’ dormitory. He paused mid-step when he realised that the room, unlike the rest of the dungeons, was not deserted. Theo sat cross-legged on his bed reading a book that had a picture of Gwenog Jones on the front cover. His head shot up when he heard the door open and his eyes narrowed when he saw Draco before widening when he caught sight of Harry.
“Yes, because the idea of us being friends is inconceivable,” he said with a slight edge to his voice.
“I don’t know. But don’t even think about taking advantage of me in my vulnerable state,” Draco warned. “I don’t want you asking me any embarrassing questions.”
“Scared, Potter?” he teased. His hot breath made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand on end and he had to suppress the pleasant shiver that traversed his spine.
up if you don’t. Get. Off. Of. Me!” he snarled, articulating each word for dramatic effect, but still, Harry wouldn’t budge. Instead, a playful smile teased the corners of his lips.
“I wouldn't dream of it, Professor,” she grinned. “I appreciate you agreeing to see me. I must admit, after reading today’s Prophet article I was a little worried that you were going to cancel the interview.”
Hestia nodded gravely. “Yeah, I heard about that. I think McGonagall’s right to monitor the owl post for the time being. A few students have already received Howlers in the post.”
Draco gave her a wry smile. “Thanks, Myrtle. You’re certainly not the first person who wished me dead but you’re the only one who still enjoys my company, so I’ll keep my options open.”
“To catch her patients, obviously,” Draco drawled. The confused expression on Harry’s face amused him to no end and he decided not to elaborate any further. “So, what happened to you? I suppose you rescued a baby from a burning building or something else equally heroic.”
“And Ted?” Minerva inquired.
“She’s just happy that I’m happy.”
Myra picked up the birthday cake and took a large bite out of it. Liv stared at her, shell-shocked at her grim predictions. The office scene dissolved into abstract shapes and colours and another began to take form. Liv turned her attention away from the changing scene to Minerva.
A pretty, fair-haired woman sitting at the staff table jumped to her feet and waved enthusiastically at the students who applauded politely in return. Harry scrutinised her closely: after Liv’s photograph had been published in the Daily Prophet, Harry had been taken aback at the resemblance she and Nymphadora bore. She appeared friendly enough, but he couldn’t help but find the physical similarities between her and his dearly departed friend a little unnerving. Sporting moss green robes and styling her long hair into a simple twisted bun, Liv was a more subdued version of the Tonks he knew.
“Sir,” she said more firmly before shouting, “WAKE UP!”
“Honestly, I was surprised how much I liked it,” Ginny admitted. “I’m not usually into lovey-dovey stuff, but it was really good.”
“My happiness has always ranked fairly low on my parents’ list of priorities. It’s always been about doing what’s best for the family,” he said bitterly.
Before Harry could respond to Ginny’s sly remark, silence fell over the Great Hall and he turned his attention towards the staff table to see Professor McGonagall standing, waiting patiently for the chatter to die away before addressing the students.
“Yet you still take what I think and say to heart,” Snape mused. “My recently departed counterpart was right about you: you’re a hot-headed dunderhead who wears his heart on his sleeve and speaks before he thinks.”
“A roll and bacon would be a good start.” Before he took a bite out of the roll, he added, “I heard Granger mention something about using a Muffliato Charm?”
“You’re a bloody show-off, you know that?” Draco chastised lightly.
"Alright, Romeo, if you insist. Although, if you ask me, thou doth protest too much,” she joked.
Liv chuckled. “I suppose not.”
“Hey, Romeo!” Harry’s head snapped up and he saw Ginny standing at the side of the stage beckoning him. “Get your head out of the clouds, you’re up next!”
Harry laughed. “Not this time, we only exchanged a few verbal threats.”
“Very impressive, Mr Malfoy,” she said, handing him back his feather. “Clearly, you’ve done this before.”
“He's not good enough for you!” he cried, pointing accusingly at Theo. “He’s a no-good Death Eater and I trust him as far as I could throw him.
“I really enjoyed it as well,” Hermione gushed. “The performances were so convincing! I thought Juliet really stood out.”
Harry couldn’t immediately recall meeting any Muggles that he had particularly liked and Ginny didn’t look entirely convinced at this assurance but she decided to drop the subject.
Draco looked uncertain at this proposition. “But...what are we if we’re not enemies?”
“He might be a bigoted, evil scumbag, but he’s an opportunist above all else,” he argued. “The Malfoy’s name is in the dirt now. What better way to climb back to the top of the social ladder than by getting on your good side?”
“Not to worry, you weren’t to know. I’ll need to go track down the escapees, but I’ll finish treating you first…” Once she had finished bandaging Draco’s hands and forearms, she slipped a clean cotton gown over his head. “I’m afraid that your school uniform is ruined, bubotuber pus is impossible to get out of clothes.”
Hestia shook her head in disbelief. “That little shit. I suppose I shouldn’t have expected anything less from a Malfoy. How long did you give him detention for doing that?”
They chatted a little more about their families as they drank their tea and she learned that Hestia, like Liv, was an only child, but being from a pureblood family she had spent her entire life in the wizarding world. Although she had relatively little knowledge or experience of Muggles, she seemed quite interested in what Liv had to say on the subject. She seemed particularly interested in the many Muggle books that Liv had filling the shelves that lined either side of the classroom. She ran an index finger along the spines of several books and pulled one out at random to inspect it more closely.
“Umm…” Harry checked his script again. “Act three, scene one. I’m Tybalt, Ron’s Mercutio and Neville’s Benvolio.”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Check out Goyle,” he muttered. “Is it just me or is he giving us the stink eye?”
Liv shrugged. “I suppose that they didn’t want to advertise the fact that they had lost all of the Muggle-Born records. It might have emboldened some people to fight back and given others the opportunity to run.”
“Did you just
“Wow,” Harry sighed. Draco turned to look at him and couldn’t help but smirk at the dreamy expression on Harry’s face. “I mean...that was…”
Harry shook his head. “My new Firebolt arrived a couple of days back and I’ve been dying to try it out, but I just haven’t had the time.”
“I don’t see what the problem is,” she replied. “Anyone who reads it will see that it’s clearly an advertisement.”
Harry was still of two minds about staying in the compartment because he didn’t want to upset Dennis any more than necessary. He decided that if Dennis did ask him to leave then he would do so without complaint. But when he returned to the compartment a little while later, he didn’t say anything to either Neville of Harry. Instead, he avoided their gaze and continued to stare out of the window, ignoring them both. An uneasy silence followed which Neville mercifully broke when he nodded towards the carrier sat beside Harry. “Did you get a new pet?”
Draco scoffed and turned to face Harry as they reached the centre of the pitch. “I seriously doubt that.”
“I am?” he asked, confused. Ginny rolled her eyes.
“Alright,” he muttered. “Ready?”
“I’m the dragon,” she added unnecessarily.
“One...two...three...
“What, are you afraid that she’d bite you and you’d turn into a Were-Ferret?” Harry mocked. “You needn’t worry about turning into a weasel, Malfoy, you already are one.”
Before leaving, Harry bought a few sets of casual robes in a variety of colours and materials, much to the delight of Douglas, who threw in a dragon-leather belt for free as “A small thank you for your generous custom.” It was the first time Harry had ever bought clothes for himself simply because he liked them. He even considered going into Muggle London to get some more clothes before heading back to Hogwarts and he wondered if Ginny or Hermione would want to go with him.
“Your trunk was in my way!” argued Draco.
“You don’t mind me borrowing it?” asked Hestia.
"Suit yourself," he drawled. "It's your loss."
Draco gritted his teeth and turned on his heel, marching out of his father’s office as fast as he could, red hot shame and anger coursing through him. When he finally made it to the safety and solitude of his bedroom, he slammed the door shut behind him and slumped against it, his heart racing. Despite his diminished appearance, Lucius still radiated an aura of superiority that made Draco feel two inches tall. His father always made him feel inferior and stupid by comparison. In his youth, it had been something that Draco had aspired towards—to be looked upon with fear and respect. Now, it just made him feel sick to his stomach.
“You’re right, I don’t,” Draco cut in. “So let’s just drop it, shall we?”
Liv continued to speak but watched out of the corner of her eye as Harry leaned forward and patted Neville reassuringly on the shoulder before whispering in his ear. Neville listened intently, nodded vigorously and appeared to relax a little.
Minerva suppressed a snort. An olive branch, he says. Where in the love of Morgana was she going to find that?
He gave a careless shrug before casting a quick glance in Harry's direction, who was chatting away to Hermione. "There have been some highlights."
The ferret squeaked in the affirmative and began nibbling on her treat. Harry opened the dormitory door and carefully sat the ferret onto the landing. “I’m too busy to play right now. Go explore for a bit and come back later.”
“Hey,” Harry greeted them. “Happy New Year.”
Liv couldn’t help but notice that Draco Malfoy, although his expression remained impassive, shifted uncomfortably in his seat at the mention of the former Muggle Studies professor. She wasn’t sure what to make of his reaction considering he hadn’t been one of Professor Burbage’s students. Pushing her curiosity to the back of her mind, she focused on the task at hand. Picking up a piece of chalk, she began scribbling notes across the blackboard.
“I just heard you!” said Draco hotly. “How can you not hear yourself?”
“How are you feeling now?” he asked.
“Always,” Draco preened.
Liv snorted. “I always appreciate your honesty, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco’s heart rate spiked as he felt Harry’s fingers slip under his shirt and ghost across the bare flesh of his stomach, making his skin tingle before he gave Draco’s belt an experimental tug. Draco quickly rolled off of Harry’s lap and flopped onto his back, his hands shaking a little as he desperately pulled at his belt buckle to undo his trousers. Harry watched him for a moment before deciding to do the same and fought with his own belt and zipper. Everything seemed to move in a blur as they groped and kissed, pulling at each other’s clothes, their hands fumbling as they tugged their trousers and boxers past their hips. Draco just about lost his mind when Harry’s hand slipped between his legs, the tips of his smooth, calloused fingers brushing against his achingly hard erection. When Harry’s fingers closed around the base of his cock, Draco moaned and clamped his eyes shut as he pressed his head against Harry’s shoulder, breathing hard. The feeling of another person’s hand, Harry’s hand, on such an intimate, sensitive part of his body was overwhelming.
“So this ‘friendship’ of yours,” Ginny pressed on, ignoring Harry’s prompt to keep reading from the script. “You are just friends, aren’t you? Or is it something more?”
“We had agreed to leave at eight o’clock sharp.”
“I’ll blow
Harry looked out of the window where he could see the darkened rooftop of the owlery in the distance and felt that familiar dull ache when he thought of Hedwig. It was strange being back here without her. He had worried that it would feel strange being back at Hogwarts. He supposed it did a little bit, but it wasn’t an entirely unpleasant feeling. So much had changed, but he supposed that change wasn’t always bad: suppose he and Draco Malfoy somehow came to a place where they could put aside their mutual hatred and learn to live with each other...that had to be a good thing, right?
Narcissa’s face crumpled and she pulled Draco into a tight hug, hiding her face from view. Draco wrapped his arms around her and rested his head on her shoulder. Her long, blonde hair tickled his nose but he didn’t complain or move it out of the way. Instead, he closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, his mother’s perfume, which smelled like hyacinths, filling his nostrils. It was a comforting scent that reminded him of home. He wanted to stay there, hugging his mother until the train had pulled out of the station and left without him; that way, he could just go home. But too soon, Narcissa pulled away, brushing invisible dirt from his shoulders and tucking his hair behind his ears.
to visit?” Ron teased, earning him a playful slap on the arm from Hermione.
“You and your bloody principles,” muttered Andromeda in a low, shaky voice. She jumped to her feet and stormed out of the kitchen, tears streaking her pale face. Ted stared after her, looking despondent, but he didn’t go after her. Liv shook her head in disbelief.
to fly on his broomstick?”
“But that’s not fair,” Harry argued. “Most of the Slytherins had nothing to do with the war.”
“You’ve got a mean streak, that’s for sure,” Harry muttered. Draco smirked at him.
“Take care of yourself, Harry dear,” she said before adding, “And please try and stay out of trouble this year.”
“The Muggle-Born Registration Commission,” Umbridge repeated slowly in a condescending tone. “The new Minister for Magic has ordered for all so-called ‘Muggle-borns’ to present themselves for interview in order to prove that they haven’t obtained magical power by nefarious means. I will need all of the records that your department has collected over the years of Mudbloods and to begin issuing summons letters to them.”
“Okay, hold tight,” he instructed. “If you scream, I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
Harry smiled. “Great. I’ll be Tybalt—”
“Say no more,” said Draco. “I’m more than happy to tag along. Perhaps we could pop back into Gladrags for a little gander afterwards? Visit their changing rooms again?”
Harry worried his lip and contemplated Draco’s words. “I guess you’re right…”
“Okay, this person that you like—how likely is it that you’ll ask them out on a date?”
When the scene ended, Harry and Draco looked intently at one another and only seemed to come back to their senses when Liv and the rest of the class began to clap. Draco immediately marched back to his seat, looking less than pleased for someone who’d just received a round of applause. Harry walked back to his own seat looking a little flustered. When the applause died down, Liv got to her feet and beamed at her students.
“Not nearly often enough,” she quipped, smiling at him.
“I’m not trying to harangue you,” she implored. “I only want to help you!”
“I’m not talking to Hermione about...this,” he muttered, his cheeks turning as red as the Braeburns. Ginny raised a sceptical eyebrow at him.
“June eighteenth, 1996,” said Liv, smiling sadly. “It’s my birthday.”
The news article, however, seemed to remain firmly in the forefront of Liv Tonks’s mind, if her behaviour was anything to go by. Capitalising on the extra attention that the play was receiving, she decided to double the number of rehearsals, much to the chagrin of everyone involved, as this left no free time for them to take part in the friendly Quidditch matches as Valentine’s Day loomed ever closer. To make matters worse, the atmosphere during rehearsals had remained tense since the former P.A. members had become involved in the production.
“Are you alright?” she asked gently. Liv kept her eyes to the ground, pointedly ignoring the scene unfold in front of her, but she gave a curt nod.
“I know,” said Harry. He hesitated a moment before adding as casually as possible, “But maybe we don’t have to be enemies, either.”
Filch looked crestfallen. “Oh. Right…”
“Brillian’!” Hagrid beamed. He turned to Ron and Hermione. “An’ you two? You comin’ as well?”
Like a movie playing in reverse, the shards of glass flew off of the floor and back onto the wall, the pieces quickly arranging themselves like a giant jigsaw puzzle and within seconds, the mirror was repaired. Temporarily pushing his anger and worry to one side, Harry concentrated on the task at hand. He drew his own wand and they set about fixing the rest of the bathroom, putting doors back onto their stall hinges, vanishing the water all over the floor and cleaning the obscene graffiti off the walls. Harry gave Myrtle’s bathroom stall a fresh coat of paint, then Luna, armed with her paintbrush, set about painting one of her famous murals on the door. She asked Myrtle to stand (or float) still so that she could use her as a model, and Harry watched with great interest as Luna’s work of art slowly took shape. The three chatted while Luna painted. Well, mostly Myrtle talked and they listened as she described in excruciating detail the day that she died and all the people that she had haunted over the years. As Myrtle recounted how she had spent several glorious years haunting a girl called Olive Hornby, Luna applied the finishing touches to her painting and took a couple of steps back to inspect the work.
“My performance,” he pressed. “I got to swing my sword about for a bit today. Weren’t you watching?”
“Two households, both alike in dignity,” he began, his booming voice ringing out through the silent theatre. “In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean…”
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. “You think I should play Juliet as a boy?”
“Of Shakespeare’s
“Year seven.”
“Some more than others,” Ron muttered, glancing towards the Slytherin table.
“Ah, Luna’s already here,” said Neville cheerfully, waving to the person dancing on their own wearing what at first glance looked like a dinosaur costume. When Luna caught sight of Neville she stopped dancing abruptly and skipped over to her friends, grabbing hold of her beau’s outstretched hand.
“I’ll tell you a little bit about myself before we begin, shall I? Like you, I used to be a student here at Hogwarts, though that was a few more years ago now than I care to admit. I’m curious, how many Slytherins do we have in the class?” A couple of hands were tentatively raised and Liv’s smile broadened. “Good to see a few fellow Slytherins in our midst!”
Harry turned to Draco and muttered, “You be Tybalt and I’ll do Romeo.”
“Are you sure?” asked Draco. “We can always do something else.”
“Shh…” he purred. “You wouldn’t want anyone to catch you like this, hmm? Pinned against the mirror with your legs spread and moaning while I pump your cock. You wouldn’t want everyone to see what a dirty boy you are, how much you enjoy getting fucked by me…”
“I’m trying my best to stay out of trouble these days...sir.”
There was a stunned silence as Theo stalked down the corridor out of sight.
“We don’t have to be out all day,” Harry hedged. “If we tag along for a couple of hours, we’ll probably be off the hook for the rest of the afternoon.”
“It’s my new project,” Mr Weasley explained. “Now, I know it needs a little TLC—”
“Always so gracious in victory, Potter,” he sighed.
“As Head of Muggle Liaisons, you’re well on your way to a successful career in politics. You might even be a shoo-in for Minister for Magic in a few years,” she mused.
“And? Ginny’s a grown woman, she can talk to whomever she likes!”
“Well...because it’s a Muggle play,” said Harry simply. Draco lowered the script and looked at Harry.
Liv lowered her gaze and mumbled, “No, Madam.”
“Piss off,” Harry laughed, but he quickly dropped his smile as he heard someone clear their throat behind him. Harry and Draco turned to find Hestia looming over them with her arms crossed.
“What was illegal?” she asked, looking horrified. “Being gay?” Harry nodded and Ginny’s expression transformed from one of shock into anger. “That’s ridiculous! What difference does it make who you love?”
“Oh, haha,” said Harry sarcastically.
The creature squeaked feebly in the affirmative and a white furry head popped out of the cage door, which now lay ajar. Harry let out a long sigh and his body relaxed against Draco’s, relieved that his pet wasn’t injured. Draco grunted as Harry’s body continued to pin him to the floor.
Harry flopped his head against Draco’s shoulder and mumbled ‘thank you’. Draco stroked the top of Harry’s hand with his thumb and mused, “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—you’re too kind and too forgiving for your own good.”
“Other than a couple of crushes, I’ve never really had strong feelings for anyone before. I mean, I love Ginny”—Draco’s jaw tensed when Harry said that—“but as she pointed out, there’s a big difference between loving someone and being in love with them. It quickly became clear that was the case for me. I love Ginny, but more like a sister than anything else.”
“It was an accident!” Harry argued.
“Hmm, somehow I doubt that,” she said quietly. “Thanks again for the book. I’ll see you at lunch.”
god I love your eyes...I love everything about you, Harry. Oh god, I think I love you, too…”
“That would be ideal,” said Draco. “It’s small with a simple structure and easy to picture in your mind’s eye. Now you’ve picked an object to focus on, the next step is to relax.”
There was an awkward silence before Harry cleared his throat and began to rummage through his school bag for his script.
“Will my hair grow back, sir?” asked Neville, looking panicked.
“I know,” Harry mumbled. “I was more worried about how you two would react when you found out that the bloke that I’m with is Draco.”
Harry snorted as Ron waved to the reporters and was quickly swarmed by them. He made his way further down Diagon Alley in the direction of Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions but stopped dead in his tracks when he saw, yet again, several more journalists lingering outside the shop entrance. He cursed so loudly that a passing woman screamed in fright at the angry, disembodied voice and dropped her shopping bags. A couple of shoppers stopped to help the poor woman pick up her scattered belongings while Harry marched back up the road in a foul mood. Everywhere he turned he met resistance in the form of disgruntled goblins, trolls and reporters. He just wanted to buy his school things in peace for Merlin’s sake, and they wouldn’t even let him do that.
Harry turned his head towards his friends and saw Ron and Hermione walking further and further away along the corridor chatting animatedly to one another, neither realising that Harry was no longer with them. If it was only going to take a minute, he’d be able to catch up with them. He faced Draco again and nodded.
“Why can’t we just do the show here?” asked Pansy.
“Come on, it’ll be fun!” Harry implored, lowering his hand. Draco, however, still looked uncertain. “I promise to go slower this time if that’ll make it less scary for you.”
Draco paused and turned to face Pansy, who hurried towards him.
Minerva took a sip of her tea and turned her attention back to the article:
“Why not?” Harry explained to Ron that in the Muggle world, some Muggles held the same prejudiced attitude towards gay people as some wizards had about Muggles. Ron pulled the same indignant expression as Ginny had done when he had told her the very same thing. “Bloody hell. Your aunt and uncle, were they like that too?”
“Finally, something that we can both agree on,” Draco muttered and Harry drew him a contemptuous look.
“You want me to go beat Neville up for making you cry?” Ron joked. Hermione huffed out a laugh and shook her head.
“This isn’t funny!” Harry snapped.
“Yes, but I also said that the play is a critique on human nature, not of fate,” she countered. “Romeo, in his grief, avenged Mercutio’s death by killing Tybalt. He wasn’t fated to do so, he just let his emotions get the better of him. While his predicament is a sympathetic one, the situation wasn’t unavoidable. Romeo could have made the hard choice and walked away, but he didn’t—he
Draco yawned and rubbed sleep from his eyes. “What time is it?”
Harry looked thoughtful for a moment. “How about...I try throwing without wearing my glasses?”
The orgasm that hit Draco stuck him like a lightning bolt, whiting out his vision. All he could hear was the pulse of his heartbeat in his ears as his cock pulsed hot streaks of come across Harry’s hand and stomach. He experienced another surge of pleasure a few moments later as he heard Harry’s breath catch and felt the wet heat of Harry’s climax coat his fingers. Harry had his face buried into Draco’s shoulder, biting back a moan as Draco slowly milked his spent cock, eking out the last bit of pleasure before Harry lazily brushed his hand away when even those soft ministrations became too much. It took them some time to come down from their dizzying post-coital high, their chests heaving as they lay tangled in each other’s arms, sated, sticky and exhausted.
“What’s that thing doing here?” he grumbled. Harry rolled his eyes and scooped Asha up into his hands.
Minerva frowned at her. “Your actions would have indirectly saved the lives of a lot of people, Miss Tonks.”
“Mmm, don’t tempt me,” Harry replied sleepily.
Harry gave himself a little shake and set his expression into a deep frown, trying to get into the character of a moody, lovesick teenager. Luckily for him, that was as natural as breathing.
“I came to check on you, of course,” she pouted. “Sorry that I didn’t come earlier but you know that I don’t like big crowds. How are you feeling?”
“Maybe he just finally found the right study partner,” Ginny suggested innocently, grinning into her goblet as she took a swig of juice. Draco smirked at her.
He pulled his fingers out of his body and guided Draco’s right hand between his legs. Without further prompting, Draco magicked lube onto his fingers to ease the friction and pressed them into Harry’s hole, already slick and wet. Harry sighed with relief and rolled his hips, inviting Draco to push deeper.
“Why?” Ginny challenged. “Why do you hate Theo so much when you don’t even know him?”
Draco cursed and shook his head. “I bet it was that fucking P.A. that did this, whoever they are! When they said that we’d all be sorry, they weren’t joking, were they?”
Hestia lowered her cup onto her lap and smiled sadly at Liv. “Yeah, I knew her and Remus both pretty well. She...she was an amazing woman and a brilliant fighter. I’m sorry for your loss.”
Harry looked over at Draco again and felt his heart rate quicken. Only moments before, he had been daydreaming about what it would be like to kiss him, but now that the opportunity had presented itself, the thought of actually doing it was slightly terrifying. What if Draco refused to kiss Harry? Or worse still, what if he thought Harry was a terrible kisser? Oh Merlin, what if he was a horrible kisser and nobody had ever had the heart to tell him? The usual, nonsensical worries played through Harry’s mind as he sat chewing his thumbnail, trying to figure out how to broach the subject with Draco.
“But if people find out…” he argued weakly.
Liv thought that she might keel over right there and then.
“No cuts or bruises or broken bones this time,” he mused. “Did you turn him into a slug again?”
“Whatever your intentions, you earned that medal,” she argued. “Kingsley wouldn’t have given it to you otherwise.”
“What happened?” she asked. Professor Sprout helped Harry sit up on the bed, looking decidedly less cheerful than usual.
“I assumed as much,” she said wryly. “I must admit, I’ve had my suspicions about you two for a while now.”
Harry shrugged. “Not really. We both knew that he wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’ll get over it. Eventually...hopefully.”
“I was attacked, Professor!” Draco declared. Professor Grubbly-Plank smirked.
“Hmm, that’s unfortunate,” said Ron. “I’d have liked an excuse to hex that smug look off of his face.”
Harry held up his paper missile. “Last one.”
“Bringing us our breakfast.” Harry sat cross-legged on the bed next to Draco and began pulling the contents out of the bag.
“Well, it serves him right, if you ask me. You say he’s prone to forgetting to use a Muffliato Charm himself, he’s simply getting a taste of his own medicine for a change.” He chewed his food slowly for a few moments before asking, “I don’t suppose I can persuade you into spending the day in bed with me instead of traipsing about Muggle London?”
“Wait here,” said Harry, closing the door on the bemused-looking face of his boyfriend. As he pushed his way through the thronging crowd, he caught snippets of odd conversations and bizarre confessionals.
“Hmm.” Harry bowed his head and picked at a loose thread on the bedsheets. “You know, if you want, you can pop over to The Burrow sometime.”
Some of the tension that Harry had been carrying all evening (for weeks, really) eased. It was reassuring to know that Hermione, although not entirely understanding of the relationship, was at least accepting of it. “Thank you.” He glanced in the direction of the boys’ dormitory and grimaced. “I really need to talk to Ron.”
“What is?” asked Harry.
“Are you staying or going, Nott?” asked Draco evenly. “Unlike you, I don’t have time to engage in a pointless staring contest.”
“Luna!” Harry cried despairingly after his friend, but he made no attempt to go after her. He groaned and tossed the rest of the posters into the nearest bin and rubbed his face in frustration. “Bollocks.”
Harry had frowned slightly. “Of course, he’s my best mate.”
The station was practically heaving with them. Streams of people passed his vision in a technicolour blur as they marched in all directions, staring straight ahead with stony expressions. People kept bumping into Draco, knocking his shoulder left and right without even apologising, disappearing into the swarm of bodies before he could even protest. Shaking his head in disbelief at how rude everyone was, he balanced on his tiptoes and looked in all directions, but all he could see was more people and no obvious signs of an exit.
Minerva, however, wasn’t satisfied with this paltry explanation. “If I were to give you this job, I would be entrusting you with my students’ education, and there is nothing of greater importance to me than the safety and well-being of my students. I will not employ anyone that I do not trust, and I don’t trust that you are being entirely honest with me in your reasons for wanting this job.”
“Watch it!”
He leant forward and pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips and there was an audible gasp from the other students. Liv shushed them and everyone quickly fell silent again. As Harry broke the kiss, Draco spoke again, his voice a little hoarse.
“I went shopping,” he began, which wasn’t a lie (not entirely). “With Theo (okay, that was an outright lie). This is part of Twilfitt and Tattings’s new range. Don’t you like it?”
“Congratulations on being cast as Juliet, Malfoy. I think you and Harry performed brilliantly during your audition,” she said sincerely.
“I thought Ginny supported the Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, sounding a little wounded.
“What’s
“Well, for what it’s worth, I’m glad that you came back,” Hestia offered. “Otherwise we wouldn’t be sitting here enjoying each other’s company now.”
“Aren’t you going after him?” asked Ginny.
“The next morning,” Liv replied and Minerva drew her a sharp look.
“I wasn’t certain. I’m not going to lie, you two becoming friends out of the blue did come as a surprise, but I didn’t think too much of it. But after you rehearsed the first kiss in the play, I did wonder…”
“He did try,” Harry admitted. “But he also knows that once I’ve made my mind up about something, there’s no changing it. Ron, Hermione and I might not always see eye to eye, but we’ve been through a lot together. They’re my best friends—they’re just trying to look out for me.”
Liv squealed in surprise at the sudden interruption. She stopped the chair spinning so abruptly that it tipped over completely, sending her crashing onto the hard, flagstone floor. She instinctively threw her hand out to break the fall and a shooting pain shot up her arm as her hand struck the ground. It crossed her mind that she may have broken her wrist, but Liv momentarily forgot the pain when she heard the click of heels hurry across the classroom floor in her direction and, without warning, a strong pair of hands slipped under her armpits and pulled her unceremoniously into a sitting position.
Harry, who had only a moment before been floating on cloud nine, unceremoniously crashed back to reality. “What do you mean?”
“He’s Oberon, King of the Fairies,” said Hermione testily. “And I think he looks dashing!”
Harry made to move out of his chair but he paused. “Professor, what’s going to happen to Dennis and the others?”
Luna gave Myrtle a small wave and Myrtle’s eyes narrowed. “Is she your
“Umm...yeah. That’d be great,” he said, giving Draco a slight smile. “Thanks.”
That threat spurred Draco into action. He quickly pulled his robes back on and retrieved his owl and trunk from the luggage car. He and Harry left their belongings beside the mountain of other trunks, pet carriers and cages on the platform, where Professors Grubbly-Plank and Sprout had their wands drawn and were performing the (now customary) security checks on all of the luggage while the caretaker, Argus Filch, rummaged through one of the trunks.
“Any time,” said Ron, striding in the direction of the photographers.
She also had to contend with finding replacements for several of the teaching staff who had died, been jailed, or had quit. Her first year as Headmistress hadn’t even officially begun and already she had developed a permanent headache.
“Scene five,” Ginny scanned her own script and pointed out the key line to Harry. “There you are: ‘Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged.’ It’s a bit cheesy for my liking, but whatever floats your boat…”
monolith that dominated the centre of the great hall without giving it a second glance, then down the golden lifts that shuddered to a halt in front of her office. Nobody gave her a second look or thought; she might as well have been invisible, and that suited her just fine.
“Or Umbridge,” Harry added with a smirk.
“Oh.” Harry felt his stomach twist with embarrassment at his careless admission. Yet again, he was reminded of just how different his upbringing was compared to everyone else around him. He tried to give a careless shrug and replied evenly, “Umm, for as long as I can remember. I was dropped off at the Dursley’s the night my parents were killed, so since I was a baby, I suppose. They only moved me into Dudley’s spare bedroom after I started getting my admissions letters from Hogwarts—addressed to the cupboard under the stairs, if you’d believe it. Clearly, Dumbledore had a sense of humour. I suppose my aunt and uncle realised then that Dumbledore was keeping tabs on me, so they tried to save face by moving me into a proper room. But the cupboard must have been my bedroom for what...ten years?”
“Not particularly, but you know what they say,” he drew Draco a sly smirk. “Trouble always seems to find me.”
“Ay, pilgrim,” Draco nodded. “Lips that they must use in prayer.”
There were similar threats scrawled along the walls, some addressed directly to Draco. When Harry read those messages, a rush of hot anger swelled in the pit of his stomach, threatening to erupt like a volcano. He clenched his fists by his sides, struggling to speak in a calm, even tone, “Has Draco seen this?”
Draco only half turned away before summoning his courage to face Ron again. “And another thing: you’ve got Theo all wrong.”
“It’s your fault,” Harry teased, lacing his fingers through Draco’s hair and kissing his jaw. “When I saw you in that toga, I just wanted to tear it off of you and have my way with you right there and then.”
“Why not?” she queried. “I think you look nice.”
Minerva pushed the newspaper away in disgust and sank back into her tartan winged armchair, feeling irritable.
Pansy thrust her sword into the air and declared, “Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar!”
“Ah. Right you are, Professor!” said Luna airily, still holding Draco’s reluctant hand firmly in her grasp.
“There you are!” she cried. “I was just about to come looking for you.”
He turned to Luna, expecting her to agree or, perhaps, offer a viable alternative. He did not expect her to close her eyes, point her finger out directly in front of her, and proceed to spin in a circle several times.
“A future?” he scoffed. “It wasn’t too long ago that I had no future.”
“You’re early,” he shot back. “Ready to go?”
When Snape had penetrated Harry’s mind during their Occlumency lessons, Harry felt as though Snape was cutting through his mind with a scalpel, sifting through his mess of memories with precision and purpose. But when Neville did it—probably because he had never done it before—Harry felt as though his brain was being beaten about by a whisk. Memories from the distant past got tangled up in more recent ones: Dudley’s fist connecting with the side of Harry’s face...Harry fighting helplessly against Inferi as they dragged him towards a watery grave...Harry tumbling through the air in a storm as hundreds of Dementors surround him...Harry’s mother screaming and a flash of green light—
“I’m sorry, what was that?” Draco teased, cupping his ear. “Did Harry Potter just say thank you? To me?”
Liv paused and Hestia looked expectantly at her. “I’m expecting there’s a ‘but’ coming up.”
“Careful, ‘Mione, you sound scarily like Percy when you talk like that.” Ron flopped down into the empty seat next to Hermione and asked, “Did Malfoy actually take my advice on board and get lost?”
Dennis drew her an incredulous look. “The fact that you even need to ask that is part of the problem!”
“Not before you take me out on a date first,” he joked, laughing at the angry blush that spread across Harry’s face. Harry tossed another ball, this time at Draco’s face. Using wandless magic he managed to stop the missile mid-flight and toss it back at Harry.
“It’s nothing,” said Draco firmly, brushing his damp hair out of his face. “It happens from time to time, I just needed to catch my breath.”
“Whispering your lines. Can’t you just read without making any noise?” Draco complained. Harry tsked and bowed his head.
“A couple of the younger students have,” said Draco. “Not that there’s much that the staff can do about it outside of the classroom. The rest of us know to keep our mouths shut.”
“I’m not worried,” he lied, keeping his voice low. “I just prefer to be cautious.”
“I am happy. It’s just…” Draco sighed in resignation. “Well, he’s Harry Potter, isn’t he?”
“Oh! Before I forget, you have detention with me this evening,” she said brightly. Draco turned and gaped at her.
“What a surprise,” she quipped. Harry drew her a dirty look and turned back to his script.
Draco jabbed Harry hard in the shoulder but his response was to simply hold up his hands in surrender. “I do protest I never injur’d thee, but love thee better than thou canst devise. Till thou shalt know the reason of my love; And so good Capulet, which I name tender as dearly as my own, be satisfied.”
“That concludes all the important announcements for this evening,” said Professor McGonagall with a genuine smile. “Let the feast begin!”
Harry stood watching at the side of the stage, waiting for his cue to enter the scene, when he heard Draco step up behind him. His skin tingled when Draco leant closer and whispered in his ear.
“For once in your life, do what’s good for you and keep your mouth shut, Malfoy,” Harry snarled through clenched teeth.
Although the sun was still bright and high in the sky, the temperature had noticeably dipped in recent days and the lush green foliage of the Forbidden Forest transformed into a sea of red and gold. Liv was already regretting wearing her hair down today as the blustery wind whipped her long, fair hair into the air and across her face. Pausing to check her appearance as she passed a shop window, she tried in vain to brush it down but quickly realised that her efforts were in vain and gave up trying to maintain a tidy appearance. Looking down the busy high street full of students, she found that she wasn’t the only one fighting a losing battle with the wind. People had thick scarves wrapped around their faces, heads bowed as they faced off against the treacherous gale. One witch squealed as a particularly strong gust of wind blew her pointed hat off of her head and sent it careening down the street.
“Why are you buying another pet, anyway?” he inquired. “You already have an owl and students are only supposed to have one pet. Is McGonagall giving you preferential treatment already?”
“Oh right...what changed your mind?” Harry chanced.
“The first time I ever spoke to a snake was in a reptile house just like this one,” he said.
“Speak for yourself,” said Harry defensively, although he couldn’t really disagree with Ron. Harry’s strength was practical demonstrations, while written assessments had always been Hermione’s forte.
“Exactly,” said Harry uncertainly. “Just acting…”
Harry and Draco stared at each other for a long moment. Harry’s hand twitched as though he was going to reach out for Draco, but he seemed to think better of it. Instead, he tucked his hand into his coat pocket and smiled sadly at Draco. “Well, I suppose I’ll see you again in a couple of weeks.”
“You sound just like your father when you speak like that,” she finally said in a low voice. “Yes, I knew your father very well. He made his views abundantly clear to anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path, like it was something to be proud of. He thought he was too important and too clever to learn anything that he didn’t think was worth his time. But I’m not interested in hearing about your father’s views, I want to hear yours.”
“I’m serious!” Liv argued. She sighed and shook her head. “Maybe I should just accept my fate: I’m destined to be a spinster all my life. I’ll die a recluse and get eaten by my Kneazles.”
“I won’t hold back this time,” he warned. Harry gave a curt nod in understanding. Draco let out a shaky breath and said, “Okay. On the count of three. One...two...three...
Professor McGonagall’s sharp eyes flitted towards the boy in the jester hat and he seemed to wither under her furious gaze. “And you, McKinley? Was it you who added the Veritaserum to the punch?”
Harry smiled. “Romeo and Julien. I think it’s got a nice ring to it.”
Myrtle looked scandalised. “He’s only one of the key members of the British royal family! Merlin’s beard, Draco. How can you not know these things?”
“Alright! Let’s stop shouting at each other. Clearly, we’re never going to come to an agreement on this. There’s only one way to resolve this dispute,” he declared. “Rock, paper, scissors.”
As luck would have it, Draco opened the toilet door and walked straight into none other than Harry Potter. Their bodies crashed together with such force that Draco stumbled back into the small toilet, grabbing the door frame to steady himself. Out of instinct, Harry fumbled for his wand and pulled it out of his robes, but he paused when he realised who he had bumped into. Draco was still an enemy, but evidently, he hadn’t been deemed a particularly dangerous one since Harry quickly stuffed his wand back into his pocket.
“Wow,” said Harry. “That sucks.”
Hermione shrugged. “I figured you’d tell me when you were ready to. I’m sorry that choice was taken away from you.”
“Are you really?” Draco nodded and Narcissa exhaled slowly. “You don’t know how relieved I am to hear that.”
“That’s brilliant, Neville,” said Harry, eyeing the little tree with interest.
“Told you,” said Harry lightly, grinning.
“Well,” Hermione pointed at a nearby row of hedges. “The zoo is just over there.”
“Your guest has arrived, Minerva.” drawled Severus. Snapped from her morose revery, Minerva frowned and looked up at his portrait.
Everyone, except for Ronald Weasley.
“Maybe,” he began slowly. “What about Tybalt? He hated the Montagues so much that even when Romeo tried to keep the peace, Tybalt just threw it back in his face. Everything sort of escalated from there: Tybalt kills Mercutio, then Romeo kills Tybalt to avenge Mercutio, which makes the Prince banish him. That’s the only reason the Friar comes up with to justify using a potion to fake Juliet’s death so that she and Romeo can run away together. The Friar’s only intention was to help. But if Tybalt had been able to see past his own hatred for the Montagues, they all could have lived.”
“I’m fine,” he insisted. “I—”
Liv screwed up her face as though she were about to argue with Minerva on this point, but instead, she sighed and drew her wand, placing it on the desk. Minerva frowned at the curious-looking wand, it was deep brown in colour with strong, oil-like grain patterns along the shaft.
“Out,” Harry replied shortly.
“This”—Ginny gesticulated between her and Theo—“is none of your business,
Draco looked incensed at being silenced, but he kept his mouth shut and they both listened intently as Professor Flitwick’s distant voice echoed out of the Great Hall, followed by intermittent and rapturous applause. Draco tapped his foot impatiently on the ground while Harry watched the proceedings for a few moments before stepping back again.
“I wasn’t following you! I’ll have you know that I was looking for my
“I couldn’t agree more.” Draco pulled his own script out of his bag and opened it at a random page, pretending to find its contents more interesting than Theo’s furious expression. “Now if that’s all, kindly piss off so that I can get back to rehearsing in peace.”
“Miss...Granger, correct?”
Harry read the contents of the poster aloud. “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Presents ‘Romeo and Julien’...”
Draco thought for a moment. “How about...Julien?”
“What are you doing?” asked Harry, sounding confused.
Harry returned her smile. “I’ll try my best.”
“That’s almost every night you two have arranged to rehearse together,” she said suspiciously. “You’ve certainly become much more studious of late, Harry.”
Harry had no time to brace himself before Draco’s spell hit him again, calling forth a torrent of new, unhappy memories: Draco stamping on Harry’s face on the Hogwarts Express...Harry and Draco rolling about the Quidditch pitch viciously kicking and punching each other...Draco laughing in Harry’s face, making him feel angry and small and humiliated—
“During the day, you’ll be free to explore the city,” she continued. “On Saturday evening, however, we’ll gather for a meal before heading to the theatre. We’ve all been to Kings Cross Station before, but for many of you, this will be your first proper trip to London—and your first experience of the Muggle world, in some cases. So, the trip ought to be entertaining as well as educational. I suggest some of you take full advantage of the experience.”
Ron immediately raised his hand. “Would we be doing this instead of classwork?”
Draco sighed and shook his head. “It’s a real shame, and the evening started out so pleasant. I had a great time under the tree grabbing your—”
“Right..?” said Harry slowly.
“Or canoodling,” Harry quipped.
“Yes, if you don’t mind us leaving the same way that we arrived?” Mrs Weasley inquired.
Luna didn’t respond. She continued to spin around a couple more times before coming to an abrupt halt, swaying slightly as she pointed in the direction of a small patisserie. Opening her eyes, she smiled and declared, “It’s this way.”
“I think it’ll be fun,” Ginny piped up. “I’ve never done a play before, and I’m going to need something to keep me occupied if there’s no Quidditch this year.”
“Okay, this weekend we’ll go to Hogsmeade and see what we can find,” Harry suggested. Ron and Hermione agreed and he turned to Draco. “Fancy joining us?”
“So, Draco tells me that you’re going to do a play,” Myrtle offered conversationally.
“What if Juliet was a boy?” Hermione suggested. “It would introduce a whole new dimension to the love affair! By all accounts, Romeo and Juliet’s relationship is already the perfect example of a queer romance: the fact that they transgress the norm by falling in love with someone outwith their respective kinds and engage in a forbidden relationship, the philosphical debate behind the weight of names of identity…the play provides a perfect critique of the heteronormative society surrounding them in Verona!”
“218.”
“Oh, that’s lovely to hear.” Liv blushed, looking pleased. “She was a great manager, I learned a lot from her.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry mumbled. “Can I read off of your script?”
“Yes, I can see that,” she replied dryly. “I’m not interested in the particulars of what you boys were up to. Just gather your things and leave your trunks and pets on the platform with the other students’ belongings. Quickly now, the train is due to depart the station again soon.”
“Oh, for the love of Merlin—Malfoy, I promise that she won’t bite you,” said Harry firmly. Sitting Asha back onto his lap, he rummaged through his jeans pocket and pulled out a fistful of tiny biscuits. Draco’s eyes widened as Harry grabbed his hand and tipped some into his palm. “Here, give her these.”
Even so, he’d probably have felt more sympathetic towards him if Draco didn’t act like such an insufferable git all of the time. He was definitely getting a kick out of winding Harry up; on the train and in the carriage, he looked more amused than affronted by Harry’s retorts, which just annoyed Harry even more. That said, a part of him, deep down, had missed their little sparring sessions, although he would never admit that to anyone. It seemed that Draco had missed them, too. Harry sighed and shook his head. Merlin, they were as bad as each other.
Hestia looked impressed and nodded approvingly. “A perfect textbook answer, Miss Granger. Ten points to Gryffindor.”
she muttered and the door clicked shut. She flicked her wand through the air again.
“That’s a clever way of saying you’ll turn a blind eye to letting Death Eaters come back here to receive an education,” Dennis argued. “You should have kept the Slytherins locked up in the dungeon and thrown away the key.”
“Did she send you over here to talk to me?” Dennis demanded.
“I don’t know!” she cried, throwing her hands up into the air. “Would you like an honest answer, Albus? I don’t know what I’m supposed to do! I’ve got Kingsley telling me that our staff should be on the lookout for odd behaviour from the students, which is a ridiculous request considering we’ve just spent the last year at war—odd behaviour is a bit of a given when the entire student body has been traumatised! We have too many students and not enough staff. It’ll be a miracle if the construction of the school is completed in time for the start of term. And on top of all of this, you want me to forgive and forget what that boy did! I know that I ought to be objective about this—consider the greater good…” She spat the last words with such force that Albus flinched as though they had struck him and Minerva shook her head woefully. “I just can’t do that. I’m not a mastermind like you and I don’t have the endurance that Severus did. I’m out of my depth here. Maybe...maybe I’m not cut out for this.”
“You’re a hard man to find, Don Diego de la Vega. Or should I say...Zorro.”
“To be fair, I think you always look stupid,” Draco taunted.
“It looks like you’re getting a new set of Hogwarts robes, but my eyes must be deceiving me because there’s no way you’re ballsy enough to go back this year. Not after everything that’s happened.”
“Is that a yes, then?” asked Harry, ignoring Draco’s jibe. “Is that why you’re reading the script?”
“A little bit,” said Draco. “But I can understand where you’re coming from, I suppose.”
“But we are the masters of our own destiny. Not our parents, or Dark Lords—just you.” Liv took a sip from her pint before noting lightly, “It’s quite a daunting realisation, isn’t it? That you alone are responsible for making the tough decisions in your life.”
Dennis cast a furtive glance at the ferret before staring back out of the window. Asha stared up at Harry with big, grey eyes, wagging her tail happily before curling into a ball and closing her eyes. Soon enough, she began to emit a quiet, squeaking sound as she snored.
Harry smiled and patted Draco’s knee before turning his attention back to the lesson, a goofy grin gracing his face. Draco stared at the blackboard but he let his mind wander to more interesting places—namely, all the delightful things that he and Harry could get up to during their London trip. But his excitement was cut short when he realised that he’d have to provide an explanation to his parents for his absence at the start of the Christmas break. There was no way that he could tell them the true nature of the trip; they’d ask too many awkward questions that Draco wasn’t ready to address with them quite yet. He also wasn’t keen on staying at Hogwarts over Christmas either as there was no point in staying there when Harry was going home to the Weasleys’ for the holidays. He glanced at Harry then and felt that familiar, pleasant twinge in the pit of his stomach. He would think of something to tell his parents, because there was no way that he was missing out on this trip. Not his parents nor the Dark Lord himself would stop him.
As they approached the Transfiguration classroom, they were surprised to find their classmates still standing outside in the corridor. Hermione weaved her way to the front of the crowd to find the classroom door closed and Neville standing guard, barring entry to the others.
Any semblance of truth long abandoned, Draco stood anxiously waiting for his mother’s response. Narcissa’s frown deepened and she scrutinised his clothing a little closer. “A new range at Twilfitt and Tattings, you say?”
“Muggles call it a Lada,” Mr Weasley explained as he exited the car. He caught sight of Draco standing off to the side of the group and frowned slightly. If he were going to comment on his presence, Ginny didn’t give him the opportunity to do so.
“Can you blame them?” Harry shrugged. “Other than filling in Ministry officials, how much have you told other people what we did last year?”
Everyone listened intently as the boy spoke and the lighting on the stage began to change, the left side illuminated in pale green light, the right in a soft red hue. The boy walked slowly across the front of the stage and the spotlight followed him.
The scene dissolved and reformed one last time, this time following Liv as she marched through the Atrium at the Ministry of Magic, looking eerily calm.
“I saw that!” Draco cried accusingly as Harry marched him past the fake graveyard towards the main entrance. “I saw you roll your eyes at me.”
“How did I do?” he asked, sounding a little breathless.
Ron shook his head in disbelief. “It’s official: the lion in the classroom is only the second weirdest thing to have happened today.”
“Okay,” Draco drew his wand. “Let’s give this a go, shall we?”
“What did you say to him?”
“Yes, I think we both know that all too well,” Myrtle huffed.
Draco felt his stomach drop at those words but he kept his expression impassive. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“An organisation that was disbanded and then re-established during the war by Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom?”
“Please don’t,” Draco groaned before adding, “Did you use that map of yours to find me?”
boring?”
“Oh, not many,” she assured him, pulling a huge bundle out of her handbag. “Just a couple of hundred.”
“Your performance during the audition was exemplary,” she enthused. “And while I think that you would do a wonderful job playing Romeo, you and Juliet share a lot of the same qualities. If you read the rest of the script, I think that you’ll find that you and she have a surprising amount in common.”
Draco’s cocky demeanour quickly receded, however, as they approached the last thestral-drawn carriage that waited to take them up to the castle. His pace slowed and he came to a complete stop a few meters from the carriage, looking uneasy. Harry paused and turned to face Draco.
“I didn’t mean to,” she pleaded. “It just came out, I couldn’t help it.”
“I think it would have been weirder if he was,” Harry quipped.
As they were finishing up their meal, Liv handed out their tickets for the play before escorting them the short distance between the restaurant to the theatre. As they sat waiting for the performance to begin, Draco took in his surroundings: looking left and right, every seat was filled—the place was packed with Muggles. He glanced over the balcony and spotted a large group of them huddled together at the foot of the stage, stepping from one foot to the other in a vain attempt to stay warm. Draco pulled his coat a little closer to his neck and shivered.
“What happened to the company car that work gave you?” she asked. “Mum said that you had a Rolls Royce!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean. In the grand scheme of things, none of that really matters, does it? We’ve all seen our fair share of real battles in the last year, enough to last us a lifetime. I’m sick of all the fighting, and quite frankly, so is he. So, we decided to start this year on a clean slate with one another, and it turns out that when we aren’t spending every spare moment trying to kill each other, we actually have quite a lot in common. Believe me, I was as surprised by that as you are. And then…” Harry shrugged again. “I dunno, things just...changed between us.”
