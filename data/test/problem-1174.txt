“No, Minerva. Have a good night, Merry Christmas.” He responded dutifully, attempting to leave her in the hallway, the festivities of the day
If it was important enough, Harry would definitely not hesitate to get them involved. Until then, it was probably best not to know.
"That's… that's very kind of you Draco. I'm here with someone from Hogwarts whose showing me around though, he just stepped out for-"
Voldemort’s hissing, his calm anger not sounding near so calm anymore, and as he spoke Quirrell’s wand moved again—and again once more.
me already. Father let me use his wand several times to practice too, and the Ministry will never know. I mean, before you get to Hogwarts it’s not tracked as it’s considered accidental magic, but then once you go to Hogwarts they say you’re not allowed to use magic at home but in practice it’s only ever enforced at muggleborn residences. Which means I can practice magic all I want over the summers and yet muggleborns can’t.”
"No offense Apples, but it’s a bit tiny and sparkly for a supposed grown man’s hand-me-down." Fred pointed out, him and George having regained themselves somewhere in their conversation.
If what the ambitious little snake wanted was Harry, and Harry was going to keep vouching for him and keeping the little blond snake under his thumb, Gryffindor could probably deal with Draco Malfoy at their dinner table every so often.
"Aye—her hair was that exact color. She was mighty proud of it, she was, and I 'eard yer father rant about it often enough. 'E was a lovesick fool all seven years of Hogwarts for her so it was kind o’ well known. People called her a Fire Witch fer her 'air and her temper; was a forced to be reckoned with it was!" Hagrid laughed good naturedly, seeming lost in memories at the sight of his hair and not quite noticing Harry’s newly-dazed expression.
“It’s a term for a muggleborn.” He said, although the high note to his voice meant he was clearly avoiding something.
that it was not here for good, friendly reasons. Instead his breath caught in horror the same way it did when he’d looked up into the eye of a twenty-foot troll suddenly standing next to him.
“Ha! Almost nothing is faster than a unicorn—even th’ most aggressive beast in here could never catch ‘em.”
most importantly, so he remained still in hopes not to attract any more ire and that Vernon would get to whatever he was doing quickly.
The only shadow on the whole thing was that most of his friends weren’t here to share it with him, but when he woke up to see the veritable

and hang out with anyone, anytime, so people quickly learned who he actually was instead of whispering from the distance and making their own assumptions.
Draco made a face. “It’s a stupid rule, but even Father doesn’t find it worth making a fuss over it. Mother is always scared I’m going to break my neck or something when I go out flying so that’s probably why. Anyway, just because we can’t have brooms doesn’t mean we can’t fly—there are school brooms I think, and flying lessons first years can take.”
"You know we have to share a dorm room with that now," Dean pointed out dryly, finally deciding he had enough of being too tense around Draco and simply returning to his deserts.
“What did they say? About me missing the train I mean.” Harry brought up, slightly nervous about coming close to talking about it but… after last night and this morning, he suddenly was safe in his knowledge that Neville would not push if he didn’t bring it up himself first. And it was honestly a

“How about pick the one we did the longest ago? It’ll be a good refresher of something we did several weeks ago,” He suggested off the top of his head, and she lit up.
“And what will we be betting on today gentlemen?” Seamus grinned as the field they were going to be practicing on finally came into view.
Harry hadn’t known a thing about the wizarding world until his Hogwarts letter, because his muggle relatives hadn’t told him a damn thing. And if he didn’t know about the wizarding world, he didn’t know his parents were magical. Which meant he hadn’t known how they died.
There was a particularly nasty Death Eater during the war—Greyback—who’d purposefully placed himself near his victims homes right before a full moon to ensure at least someone would get bit, and he got a ton of children that way. Werewolves in wolf form are impervious to a lot of magics, including wards and spells and more so it was kind of a huge threat. Most just died from not surviving the infection, but a lot turned—other than that though
They went back to watching the Hufflepuff try and make an attempt at conversation with his Gryffindor classmate, but he was pretty awkward and she seemed too shy to form words so it didn’t seem to be going very well. He did his house proud though by pushing forward and trying to be friendly despite it though.
“Wait, I was zoning out, what happened?” He asked lowly to Neville beside him, who was just clutching Trevor to his chest and looking like he was trying to not be seen standing so close to Draco.
“Then get out; take whatever filth you had in the cupboard out the shed. No time like the present.” She sneered like she was taking one last kick at him, but Harry considered it a win considering that was exactly what he’d been hoping she’d do. “There will be no change in your chores and you’re expected to finish them the

have a bit more time before they needed to be back at Hogwarts, and the letter in his pocket suddenly got a bit heavier as he remembered the other things he needed to ask. He could just hand the letter to Axeclaw and it would tell him about Dumbledore probably being the one to cast the mail ward and such, but everything else… he kind of needed an answer, and he wasn’t going to get another chance to speak face-to-face with the goblins until Christmas easily, if that since he wasn’t sure he’d be allowed to leave the castle without an adult

"All right, Harry," Grandpa Arcturus said. "You come here, to the center of the circle. You'll be sitting in the middle, right in this circle. As soon as you sit, the spell circle will engage. You won't be able to leave. That's by design. We're going to pull the soul anchor up out of you and into the outer layers of the ritual circle. By keeping you here, you'll be safe inside the inner circle and we'll be safe outside."
Mother would probably be delighted to give the Manor some more warmth. Draco would certainly appreciate it.
"I think…" Draco swallowed around a throat gone abruptly dry as sand. "I think I just saw Lady Magic, Ivy. She was sort of… over the ward stone? Maybe she was the ward stone? No, over it."
"I know, Blue," Draco said. He breathed a ghost of a laugh, smiling as Blue's ears perked up and she stopped wringing her hands. "Honestly, I shouldn't be awake either. But Father."
Harry sat on the bench outside of Remus' cell. The stone wall behind him was cold enough that goosebumps covered his arms. He didn't move. Not when Draco had fallen asleep with his head on Harry's shoulder. That was absolutely the most precious thing in the entire world and no way was he going to stir.
Draco mentally shrugged before tentatively touching the blessing inside his core with the same sort of welcome and love and sympathy as he'd had for Ivy when he stole her bond. It wasn't alive in the same way as she was. It certainly wasn't aware that way. The warped emotions behind it had made a huge difference in what it was and what it tried to do.
Mother frowned at Draco, straightening up only to flinch minutely as the injuries that covered her body twinged against the wards. She would have said something comforting probably, but the sound and feel of the floo flared, pulling Draco's attention away.
"Um, well, I kind of stole Dobby's bond last night," Harry said and then waved his hands when both Amal and Silverclaw gaped at him. "He wanted me to!"
"All right, Harry," Grandpa Arcturus said as he came out of the ritual room. "We're ready for you. Draco, you'll be part of the ritual, as well. The bond between you two should help immensely to keep Harry safe."
"I know, I know," Harry said. He rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands, pressing until he saw stars. "I'm just… tired."
And the need for… for family, for love, for a home with people who cared for him, that let Harry push more magic towards Fangtooth and Arcturus.
"Okay, good news?" Harry asked because he'd be perfectly happy to leave it to an adult to fix the problem. It shouldn't be his job to fix at all.
Draco had to hand it to Harry. That was a remarkable uniform. He might have to see what he could do for his elves, though he would never let them use a print like that monstrosity.
Draco kept reminding himself of that as he watched Harry pant and shudder. As much as Draco wanted to look away, to turn to Mother and Grandfather Arcturus, he couldn't take his eyes off Harry. Not when Harry stared at Draco as though Draco was the only thing anchoring him to life and his body.
Harry nodded. He pushed at the wards and then said "ostende mihi" in as firm of a voice as he could. The shimmering circles that appeared in the air were in English this time. That was a huge improvement over earlier. The runes had been really pretty, like blocky Islamic calligraphy done in complicated interlocking rings, but they hadn't made a lick of sense.
They faded away and the white/bright/warm/wild magic spluttered into shimmering motes that rained down around Draco.
The entrance was on the far side of the labyrinth. Harry bit his lip and then walked clockwise around it. The prayer book hadn't said which way was correct to approach the labyrinth, just that you had to do it secretly and that you had to set up wards to amplify the magic of the prayer.
"It feels familiar," Draco agreed. "Let's go. There's no time to think, no time to plot. We'll have to use Gryffindor brazen stupidity to get through this."
"You know, I'm still desperately glad that you stole Dobby," Draco drawled. "He's way too much for me to handle."
"Harry, you're stunningly, confusingly, amazingly creative," Draco replied. His tone came out as dry as a desert despite the love he sent through their bond. "It's terrifying and ridiculous. No wonder you get into so much trouble. Everyone expects you to turn left, and you go up instead."
"That's," Remus paused, swallowing down whatever it was he was going to say. His eyes flared gold, though, and his fingers went claw-like with actual claws growing on his fingertips.
"Dinner is almost ready, Master Harry," Dobby exclaimed as he popped in. "Dobby has to make dessert yet. Roast is almost perfectly roasty."
Silence fell. His cheeks went hot as Mother frowned at him. Draco squared his shoulders and put his hands on the table, carefully not pressing so hard that his knuckles went white. Confidence. He needed to show confidence on this.
Mrs. Malfoy swallowed a surprised laugh that was really close to a giggle. "Very well, I'll claim my cuddle once we're all out of here."
Maybe Harry should feel guilty about never coming back. Or afraid. Or something. All he felt was excited. He hated Privet Drive, his relatives, and everything associated with living here. The sooner he was gone, the better.
"I'd promise but we both know me," Harry replied way too calmly for his contrition, his relief, his exhausted joy that they'd survived.
The Hogwarts wards rippled out near the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry could see magic impacting them, hammering away on them, but the attack obviously wasn't doing a bit of good. But wow, there were a lot of people outside the wards trying to get in. Croaker and Silverclaw must've brought in a literal army of people to try and bring the wards down.
"Oh, well, that's helpful," Harry said, delighted. He did as Draco instructed, specifically targeting all the confusing messages that the wards were pushing at him. "Ostende mihi!"
Granted, the blessings themselves made sense. Bless the kids, give them a little edge so that they'd do better in life, and maybe they'd make the world a better place. It was the malice behind the blessings that was so confusing.
"You winced when you saw her," Draco said, shaking his head. "Father cursed mother regularly. Daily. Potioned her into compliance for public events. Raped her nightly even though he knew he couldn't father more children. What the Dark Lord did to him prevented him from siring more children, not that it mattered to Father. Or, apparently, to you."
"This is… not safe," Draco finally whispered. He pulled back, holding Harry's hands like they were lifelines. "I really shouldn't go to the ward room alone."
Draco frowned at her, biting his lip before visibly bracing himself. "If neither of you want the romance, why… have the affair?"
"It shows in the behavior and the magic," Draco said. "Your Muggleborn friend Granger was definitely bullied viciously. She wouldn't be so determined to impress the teachers if she weren't. Your Weasley, though, he's not been abused or bullied. His magic is completely clear of any sort of abuse which only makes his behavior regarding Granger that much more appalling."
"Is my magic mature enough?" Draco whispered once he pushed back the faint that had nearly caught him.
The wards. Harry's worries. The Potter magic and the Black magic and even the happily pulsing bond to Dobby.
"Irrelevant," Draco replied. "We need to hurry. The twins said that the passageway takes about an hour to cross on foot."
Then Draco just looked wiped out. Exhausted. The bags under his eyes were purple-blue. His skin looked way too pale even for him. Harry could see the faint blue tracks of veins under his cheekbones. And his hands hadn't stopped shaking since Grandpa Arcturus revealed himself that morning.
Remus' legs gave out underneath him. He dropped to the floor, eyes wide with horror. His eyes still weren't focusing on anything, but he somehow managed to look directly at Harry. The horrified little keening sound made Grandpa Arcturus take a half-step back while Mrs. Malfoy frowned and tapped her bottom lip thoughtfully.
"So," Amal drawled while staring at Remus like he was already exhausted, "what exactly did Petunia say? It couldn't have been good if you reacted like this."
The wrinkles around Arcturus' eyes deepened but they were bright and smiling wrinkles instead of pain or anger or anything. The silver-streaked beard hid his smile. The wrinkles gave it away entirely.
It also meant that Professor McGonagall and the other teachers had to have some idea, too. Professor McGonagall sure hadn't been kind at all when Harry went to her for help. She'd pretty much ignored everything Harry, Hermione and Ron had to say. Snape? He loathed Harry so he was probably delighted that Harry was abused. None of the other professors or prefects or students had cared at all about Harry's horrible hand-me-down clothes or how skinny he was or anything at all.
"Ohhhh, not many, Master," Dobby said thoughtfully. "Was only thousand or so. Is many, many more here. But all best ones was there. Most expensive and rare ones."
"Cooper says that it feels like the warped blessing," Neville said, raising his chin and nodding to Harry and Draco. "He said that it feels like the exact opposite of what you two did. Dumbledore is trying to reverse what you did, Harry, Draco. He's trying to make it all go away so that he can enslave us all for good."
He couldn't deny that. Ivy opened the door, letting Mother, Grandfather and Professor McGonagall into the room. Mother ran straight to him, heedless of the ancient circles still slowly fading underneath Draco. She promptly healed his hand while dressing him down in words he barely heard between the exhaustion dragging him to sleep and Mother's sobs.
If a glare could scorch wood, Dobby's glare would have set the floor on fire despite his tears. Harry frowned and then sighed, letting his arms flop down so that his wrists rested on his knees.
Harry gulped, nerves nearly sending him right back out of the ritual circle again. It was going to hurt. He just knew it was going to hurt. They all looked way too nervous for it not to hurt like crazy.
Draco's head snapped around. He stared at Harry, eyes all blazing blue. Amal jerked so hard that he nearly fell out of his chair. Which, really, seemed like a way bigger reaction than was justified to Harry. It was just an idea, one of Harry's random ones.
"The bond is there, Potter," Draco drawled. "I can't help that I feel things now. If you were paying attention, you'd feel things from me, too."
Magic flared around Harry. Bright celadon green edged with lemon and swaths of forest green shot outwards as Harry's magic shoved at the soul anchor in his scar. His hands clenched into fists on his knees which drew up towards his chest.
Harry hugged him so tight that Draco wheezed. And got hugged back so hard that his back popped. Letting go was so very not easy but eventually they did. Draco slipped out from under the cloak, pale hair bright against the darkness of the stairwell.
"Pfft, no, don't be silly," Harry said, rolling his eyes. "I'm the Gryffindor. You're the Slytherin. I'll go first and you be ready to pull me back through if something gets me on the other side."
"I have a knife, Potter," Draco drawled. "Now go. I'll be in place well before you get to the labyrinth. Just… be careful, please?"
"But… we're best mates," Ron protested a good bit more weakly than it looked like he was going to just a moment before. He was clearly a master of the hurt puppy eyes because Harry winced when Ron stared at him sadly.
"Oh," Harry breathed as he realized that yeah, that was the exact same feel as his fleece blanket. It wasn't like the blanket. It was the same magic exactly. "They warded my blanket. Wow. I had no idea you could do that. Cool."
"I have Voldemort in my head?" Harry squeaked and wow, no amount of deep breathing was going to calm him down. His armchair shook with the force of Harry's trembling. And from his magic swirling around him and Amal.
Harry gasped. His eyes flew open, the brilliant green barely visible because his irises had dilated so dramatically that his eyes look black. He peered at Draco, squinting, and then groaned as he slumped back against the rubble.
Harry stood in the middle of Potter Keep's smaller circular tower and stared up. His mouth dropped open further as he looked up and up and up. The walls had bookshelves. So many bookshelves. They went up not just the five stories you could see outside, but twelve or thirteen, maybe fourteen stories inside.
Dobby's fingers glowed. He waved at the door. Instead of flinging the door open to say something cruel about Harry's birthday and the pure lack of anything good happening for him, Dudley stomped onwards to his room.
"I think we should go up to the battlements," Draco said. "There was a pocket in the war wards up there, like it was a spot for taking messages or something? I saw it when Grandfather was setting the floo to allow a single message to the DOM and Gringotts."
"It's Father's office," Draco corrected. "The artifacts in there are… They're vile. I'm using the wards to keep them from causing problems. I'm afraid it's taking all I have to keep… a specific one… under control."
Draco let his eyes flutter shut as he slumped back in the chair he'd been given in the grey parlor off of the floo room. His whole body thrummed with the power of the wards. They didn't like having the aurors here though, honestly, that might be Draco. He was so very done with their endless questions that probed at things that Draco couldn't and wouldn't tell them.
She popped away before Draco could sarcastically thank her for her so-generous permission. He snorted as he rolled onto his side. He really should know better than to argue with Ivy. She always got her way, no matter what. Father might have thought that he ruled Malfoy Manor, but he wasn't the reason things got done. That was all the elves.
"Bad news first," Harry said. "Why would anyone want the good news first? Seriously, that's never made any sense."
"But he's not going to go feral or kill me or kidnap me, is he?" Harry asked. "I mean, the immediate problem is dealt with, right?"
"Still only call me Potter when you're angry," Harry said. He grinned and leaned into Draco's side. "And of course I know nothing. Why would Dumbledore give me the chance to learn anything that I might be able to use to get free from his control? He wants me weak and helpless against his plots and compliant with whatever he wants from me. Which is probably for me to be a good little soldier and die for whatever cause he was going to manufacture."
"Dobby knows," Dobby said. "Dobby will make sure Master Harry has access to his money. And he will find a way to get Master Harry a safe home with people who take care of him."
"Uh, sir?" one of the junior aurors who looked only five or six years older than Draco asked. His face was so pale that he looked green. "What is that?"
Half the island away, Draco laughed into the bond, abruptly relaxing in ways that made Harry's magic flow more smoothly towards Draco to support him.
He shook his head and huffed. Ivy couldn't do anything to or about Father. Yet. If someone else could steal Dobby, that meant that Draco could steal not just Ivy but all the house elves. And then, once he as strong enough, he would steal the Malfoy family magic, too.
Draco smirked and pulled out two shrunken brooms that he returned to full size. "Aren't you glad that Grandfather Arcturus planned ahead?"
Grandpa Arcturus laughed hollowly and nodded. "I agree, Harry. Let's go to the floo room and find out, shall we?"
Fangtooth's voice faltered for a second and then his chanting picked up strength and speed. Arcturus shuddered, his lips curling back in a snarl as the pain-filled frown turned into a furious snarl that made Harry laugh as he shook and clung to Amal's hand. Dobby seized his other hand and the three of them stared at Arcturus and the healing.
Harry's hands shook as he tried to breathe through the rage. There was so much. So many things that he really hadn't been paying attention to. He'd been outright desperate for anything that would let him stay in the Magical world so he'd kind of refused to even look at everything that made him twitchy about Dumbledore.
"No," Dobby said as he wrapped both of his hands around Harry's wrist. He moved Harry's hand so that it rested against the dirty pillowcase Dobby wore. "But a great wizard can steal Dobby. If Dobby helps, if the great wizard tries with his whole heart, if Dobby and the Great Harry Potter wish with all their hearts, the bond can… move."
"Lovely," Remus sighed. "Right. Well, I'll go have the elves make some food. Merlin knows Lily wouldn't stop until her stomach started screaming at her."
"Because we don't know what your Wolf says," Harry replied. "Duh. I mean, seriously, if your Wolf is snapping at the blessing, that means that your magic is snapping at it. Because your Wolf is part of you. Not a part you like, sort of like how I'm not all that happy that I have an explosive temper that goes off when people do things that remind me of Uncle Vernon and Dudley, but I mean, it's still me. I want it to go away. I don't want to be like them. But it's still part of me. The more I know about myself, the more I understand why I blow up, then the safer I am and the safer everyone else is."
Moody flinched. His fake eye rolled away from Draco while the real one shut in what looked like pain.
Beside Dobby, there was Amal who bounced on his toes and bit his lip. And Grandpa Arcturus and Silverclaw and, well.
"My sons," a voice didn't say. "My beautiful boys. Will you sacrifice your very souls to save the world?"
Popping wasn't like taking the floo. It was kind of like squeezing a foam ball and then releasing it so fast that the ball jumped, except that Harry and Dobby were the balls and they jumped from Privet Drive right to London.
"I'll go through first," Draco offered even though he blatantly, obviously, clearly did not want to.
"Amal took notes," Harry said. "Lots and lots of notes. You can read all of them and then ask all the questions. Once we're safe."
How bad had her abuse been in private that Mother's magic responded to the mere presence of another like a threat?
Draco had the distinct impression that the wards laughed over that. He snorted a quiet laugh before tossing floo powder into the fire. Odd that it felt so very wrong to be away from Harry for this long. Odd and yet not odd at all.
"I know, I know, but can you tell Remus what you told us about the whole not quite a werewolf thing," Harry said. "I think Remus needs to hear it straight from you."
His cheeks burned at admitting that he had a temper. All his life, he'd been beaten and yelled at and bullied and abused for ever speaking up for himself. Most of the time, almost all the time, it made him wince and give up and pull away to hide.
Remus and Amal exchanged a wary look and then went through the floo together. Nearly at a run. Grandpa Arcturus waved for Narcissa to go next.
"That's because you dress like a ragamuffin and don't know a thing about your station in life," Draco said. "Come on. Let's see what the adults have to say."
Cracks snapped like thin ice fracturing under the weight of a tentative footstep, spreading across the blood-black altar.
That moment. That heart-stopping, sickening moment where you knew destruction was coming and there was nothing, not one single thing, you could do to avoid it.
Merlin knew that Harry desperately needed someone to look after him. The few things Harry had said about his life shouted how much he needed care. Draco had to wonder whether Dumbledore had wanted to cripple Harry. Even Draco hadn't been treated that poorly.
"Two options," Amal said in an utterly serious tone of voice. "He's either You-Know-Who or he's Grindelwald. I'd bet on You-Know-Who somehow controlling him. Grindelwald's been defeated and locked away for decades, so I doubt that it's him."
"Yeah, no kidding," Harry said with a little laugh that tried to go all hysterical on him. He bit his lip to stop himself from dissolving into tears or cursing or hiding under the covers. "I don't even know who or what I'm praying to."
The bond opened up to Harry as he shut his eyes and focused on Draco. It was so much easier to find Draco now. Not just because the warped blessing was gone, but because of what they'd done last night. The wild, pure magic that'd flown through the two of them had done something nice to open their bond and deepen it. He could feel Draco's worry and fear.
Draco stared at the headline which appeared in his Google Alerts, his eyes snaking over the article.
He didn’t have the chance, though, because the office door was opening again, the two publicists stepped back inside. “Okay, we think you should go for breakfast today, get to know each other a bit. Maybe tomorrow too. We’ll keep in touch for a while until you feel more.. natural about the whole thing. Paparazzi are bound to follow you around, but keep the touchy-feely stuff on the low for the moment. Maybe an arm touch here, leaning closer there. Speculations should begin soon, but neither of you is to answer a single question to the press. Whatsoever.”
“Yes, it’ll be a tragedy. I ordered McDonald's in your absence.” She held up a happy meal box, shaking it without looking at them. “I got you fries.”
They made small talk for a few minutes, Pansy talking about a photoshop or she’d done the week previous, and Blaise chatting about a recent hookup he’d had. Draco listened along, occasional swigs of his champagne making it easier to follow.
“Your dick of an ex is on our table,” Draco told Harry, rejoining him. Harry seemed to be scanning the room, his hands shoved in his pockets. “But so is your friend, the twin, and my friends.”
Draco realised, despairingly, that he would have to answer Blaise’s burning question on the ride home. Theo even joined, climbing into the back seat, grinning as he asked Blaise for a lift as a second thought. “Cmon, spill it. What did Potter want?”
Draco had met fans a thousand times before, but he never quite knew what to say to them when they appeared. He nodded, mutely, not really having any response. The other boy was off talking again, shaking his head in disbelief. “My god. Can we get a picture?”
Draco looked at Harry, who was shrugging. “It’s as you say, Ang. Footballers get paid a lot of money!”
“I own the whole apartment, I can lie in your bed if I want.” Harry had his head buried in a pillow already, his hand wandering towards the duvet, attempting to pull some away from Draco. “I made you coffee.”
“Rita Skeeter wants an interview,” Lupin said, looking unsure of the response his godson would give. Minerva was dismissing the idea, though.
Draco rolled his eyes, pocketing his phone. He felt slightly deflated since sitting down. He hadn’t seen what his teammates had apparently seen. He was lost. His friends were smirking at him, glints in their eyes, as he rose an eyebrow. “Texting Harry, then?” Blaise teased. The name sounded foreign from them. It was all sort of real, now. “You should have brought him to breakfast. If Pansy gets to meet him, we should too!”
“My friends all texted me to see if you were okay, today,” he said it casually, and Draco rose an eyebrow. “They care.”
“I only know how to cook a few things,” Harry said, finishing his mouthful. “Carbonara is my strong suit.”
“You should be.” Draco was still annoyed, and he couldn’t really think of a reason to give to his friends as to why Harry was lingering outside. “Why couldn’t your Godfather have given you it?”
Finally, someone announced for people to take their seats. Pansy led their small group towards their table, Blaise and Theo on her arms still, while Harry and Draco trailed behind. Cedric was already at the table, laughing with the Ravenclaw who was standing beside it. Pansy greeted him first, flashing an easy smile. The model smile dazzled him as he kissed her cheek. She moved around him, leaving Blaise and Theo to shake hands with him, flashing smiles as well. All pleasantries. They moved away as well as if they were clearing a path for Draco and Harry to greet him.
“Oh,” he sounded again. He thought it over for a second, leaning against the counter. “Well, yeah, he is a bit of a twat, isn’t he?”
“Failed to mention it,” Draco shrugged. He finally stood in front of Harry, his hand running up and down the strap of his bag as he tried not to fidget. “Did you really come to give me a lift?”
For the rest of the week, he didn’t see Harry. He went to training every day, hung out with his friends as much as possible, and kept an eye on the headlines. Minerva, who was desperate for some sort of information on the pair, called him twice to ask if he’d make plans with Harry again soon. But Draco dodged her question, ensuring he would soon, and questioning her on upcoming events that she had organised. It was easy to lounge around his apartment and attempt to push thoughts of his fake boyfriend from his mind. But exactly a week since their parting, a new headline arrived in his alerts, from a bigger name.
There was silence as he picked up a basket, and began shuffling down the first aisle of the shop. Finally, a breath sounded on the other side of the line. “What?”
He had already ordered an Uber by the time the elevator dinged, and he stepped into it. He leaned against the back wall, ignoring the paper burning in his pocket, and pressed the ground floor button beside him. As the doors were shutting, the footsteps sounded, and just as the gap tightened, a hand-cut in, the sensors reopening them fully.
“What?!” It was Draco’s turn to tilt his head, attempting to understand Harry’s words. But Harry was pulling away from him, his hand flying up to catch a taxi.
His face darkened, and he looked ready to physically shout. But Harry was already stepping in, a move ahead. “Is everything okay here?”
“Order me anything, I’m not picky.” Draco shrugged, his eyes not leaving the screen. Harry nodded, typing more.
“Did you see our table? Would’ve been a good lineup without Dickory there,” Theo laughed. Blaise rolled his eyes, reaching across Pansy to smack him on the chest. “What?”
Draco placed Harry on one side of him, with Pansy next to him, Blaise next to her, and Theo next to her. Fred Weasley sat beside Draco, when he finally arrived, his date sitting beside him. Most of the other tables only had 10 people, but theirs had managed 12, shockingly. The Ravenclaw introduced himself to Theo, who he sat beside, with his date beside him, but Draco didn’t listen to them. He was watching Cedric saunter over, cocky in his swagger as he pulled out Cho’s chair for her, and sat beside Angelina.
“Lead the way,” Draco shrugged, and Harry overtook him, pulling him along. Draco didn’t duck his head as he usually did, attempting to look as though he was having fun as Harry dragged him past crowds of people. Some of them recognised them, and a lot of them looked ready to ask for photos, or autographs, or something. But Draco made sure not to properly catch anyone’s eye, looking around instead.
Draco took three large gulps of the hot coffee, relaxing ever so slightly into the padded booth. Harry followed his lead, gripping the cup for dear life by the looks of things. Draco finally looked at him, sighing. He felt stiff, and awkward, and terrible. He hated this.
The rest of the meal was eaten in silence, Pansy too hungry to chat, and the couple feeling horrifically awkward with one another all of a sudden. Harry volunteered the clear the plates, dropping them all in the sink, while Pansy drained her wine, winking at Draco who was miserable.
The words glared up at him, along with a picture of Harry wearing the jacket Draco had bought him. He scrolled through the article, unable to stop itself.
Harry watched as Draco grabbed cups from a shelf, and made them both fresh cups of coffee, which he added dashes of milk to, and some syrup. He handed Harry his and walked past, determined to get back to the living room.
“Okay. Now the sheets; both of you have a questionnaire to fill out. It’s just general information, birthdays, favourite food, favourite film, etc. You’ll swap when you’ve completed them, to ensure you know at least something about one another.” She pushed two pens across the desk. “Remus, may we?”
“I want to gain weight, I just...don’t know if I want it all to be as fast as it was for you. Or, truthfully, as much,” Draco had said nervously, chewing on his bottom lip.
“Take me to bed and feed me a snack. Please,” Draco said simply, and the gleam in Harry’s eye changed from one of confusion to one of intrigue. “Unless...you don’t want to.”
As Draco was about to come, Harry stopped and he moaned again. “Please,” he whispered urgently, tangling his fingers in Harry’s hair, and Harry began to lick a trail starting at his belly button and moving down lower.
In the end, as it did so often, his cock answered the question. While he’d imagined this bloated version of himself, his cock had arrived and reported for duty, growing rock hard. He didn’t bother putting his shirt back on as he left the bathroom.
, but first things first,” he said, and reached down to his pants. He undid the button on his pants, which had gotten painfully tight over the last half hour. He sighed with relief as his tiny pot belly flowed outward with the absence of its restriction. He rubbed his belly.
“These brownies won’t eat themselves,” Harry said, pulling the pan closer. “Come on, for me? Please?”
Draco breathed heavily. His food intake had ticked up the more he and Harry had played together, but this was beyond what he was used to. He was
Harry had just blinked at him, unable to find an argument within him because he knew that he’d likely do the same thing.
.” As soon as Draco had stopped crying, she kneeled in front of him and said softly, “Sweets aren’t good for you, Draco. Sweets make you Fat. You don’t want to be Fat, do you, darling?” In this memory, the way she said ‘fat’ had a distinct capital F sound to it. She’d patted his slightly rounded stomach, his body at the time made of little more than strong legs from playing outside and baby fat, and led him back to the party.
“Oh, love, your mouth was on my cock. I’d have agreed to a threesome with Weasley if you’d have kept sucking me off.”
Five minutes later, Harry had moved them to the spacious sofa in the living room and set Draco’s treats up easily within reach. He settled Draco down comfortably, his head supported by pillows. As he fed his lover, Harry stroked Draco’s middle lovingly. Harry liked the way Draco’s tummy felt underneath his fingers, so different from his own. It was so small in comparison to his own belly.
Max was sweet and kind. His belly was soft and chubby and Draco was mad about him. They’d fucked for six months off and on until Max found a full-time boyfriend who would commit to him like Draco wouldn’t. Their breakup was messy and when they ran into each other a year-and-a-half later, Draco was disappointed to see that Max’d lost a significant amount of weight, and looked to be some sort of fitness guru.
He, Draco Lucius Malfoy, was getting fat. This fact had been pointed out to him the night prior by his lover, Harry  announcing it with little fanfare and disregard as they put the dishes away, as if it wasn’t the dismantling of part of Draco’s psyche.
His name had been Max, and they’d been in a pre-med class on Wizard Anatomy together. It was the autumn after his graduation from Hogwarts, and Draco had been going through a dry spell in the romance department for more than a year. Nothing had felt right, immediately after the War, and he’d been too focused on his future. He hadn’t intended on falling for anyone, instead choosing to focus on his first post-secondary classes. And then Max had walked into the classroom.
“Is it okay with you?” Harry said quietly into Draco’s neck, pausing briefly before resuming his kisses.
“And I do want to get bigger for you, but...let’s just see where it goes. I have a lot of weird hangups about food and weight from my bloody parents, and this might not be as easy as I thought it would be. I still want to be relatively healthy, and I’ve a career to consider, too. I make a living helping people lose weight, how might it look if portly old me was the one giving the advice?” Draco had stroked Harry’s thigh. “Let’s just see what happens.”
“Your turn for what?” Harry asked nonchalantly. “For this?” He took the piece of pizza from Draco’s hand and brought it to Draco’s lips; he took a large bite and nodded.
he was at it, for someone who claimed to only have innocently kissed a boy before. He was good enough to make Draco want to ask questions, but he had restrained himself. He had to restrain himself again as Harry sucked him off in earnest.
The last couple of months had been hectic, even more so than normal. It seemed like every weekend was either taken up with the children, birthday parties, family get-togethers or work functions. Draco had spent an entire week abroad in the States at a convention with American Medi-Wizards, and Harry had then spent the following week on a trip for the Aurors, assisting in the setup of a new office across the country. Their paths barely crossed, despite living in the same house, between their work schedules and social engagements. They’d spent too many nights apart the past two months, sleeping in separate beds, eating separate meals and yearning for each other.
They were silent as Harry frotted against Draco, their act harkening back to the early days when there had been nothing more between them than an exam room and a rapidly-plumpening married Harry. It was sentimental and hot and just a little sad, just a touch of melancholy and nostalgia peppered in between the grunts and the moans. Draco reached down and started to jerk Harry off, both of them rock hard and ready to come.
, Draco, seriously,” Harry said before pushing Draco up against the wall. Harry ground his cock into Draco’s leg, and Draco sank his fingers into Harry’s own belly.
“You read my mind,” Harry murmured, yanking off Draco’s underwear as well and taking the first moist brownie in his hands and bringing it to Draco’s lips. “You must eat all of these,” Harry said firmly with fake assertion. Their roles were usually reversed in this situation. He was used to eating, not feeding, and he was used to being controlled, not doing the controlling. He knew Draco was thinking the same thing, if the smirk on his face meant anything at all.
“I guess I haven’t been eating very well lately...these last couple of months have been crazy,” Draco said in a low voice. “My clothes have felt a bit tighter lately.”
, he supposed. It didn’t bulge, or sag, or anything of the sort. But it would soon, he reasoned. He was already starting to round out, and he supposed another ten pounds would do it.
“Tell me you want to get fat for me, baby, and I’ll keep going,” Harry said. “Just tell me all about how big you want to get.”
The side effect of his parents’ constant admonishments of his figure and eating habits was an adult Draco who watched every bite that went into his mouth. For all of Draco’s life, he had held to that sentiment. He had survived on chicken, fish and salad; he had exercised rigorously six times a week; he went for the occasional runs on his lunch break. He maintained a slim physique and possessed a body that was enviable to the growing number of fat Wizards in the area.
Harry was admiring Draco from his spot on the sofa, his eyes scanning his boyfriend’s body while an evil smile played on his lips. Draco was wearing a pair of sweatpants that still fit, but just barely. They hugged his hips and accentuated a tiny roll of fat that had sprouted there. The grey t-shirt he was wearing was simply too small. He looked like a sausage stuffed into a casing, and it outlined his belly button. Harry struggled to his feet and then made his way over to him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, unable to resist the temptation of feeling his lover’s body pressed against his.
He’d learned to give and receive affection, as hard as it had been. He’d shucked (most) of the toxic sense of pride and superiority that they’d bestowed upon him.  He lived his life the complete opposite of the way Lucius and Narcissa had imagined for their son. He shared a home with his boyfriend, Harry Potter, and occasionally with Potter’s three children. He fed Harry fattening foods and fucked him all night. He was a Healer, not a Ministry official.He had even shoved aside their politics and crude language; he hadn’t used the word ‘mudblood’ since third year and he swore to never own a house elf. If Lucius and Narcissa were still alive, they’d no doubt no longer be on speaking terms with their only son, and were probably rolling in their graves at this precise moment.
Draco Malfoy had shunned almost every feasible trait that had been passed down to him from his parents.
The other side effect was that he could only bring himself to shag blokes of size. Draco hadn’t shagged a man who weighed less than 200 pounds since he had been at Hogwarts. There was something about a man with a belly and a fat arse that really just did it for Draco.
. He felt as though he’d blended in his whole life and now he would stick out. He felt disconnected from himself and yet, at the same time, he felt so very present. He didn’t know what was going on, or why he was feeling this way.
And, Draco was realizing as he peered at his own body in the mirror, it appeared that Potter hadn’t been the only one growing.
“You officially have a belly, my love,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, bringing his hand from around the back and sinking a finger into it. It reminded Harry of their second encounter in the office, when Draco had sunk his finger into the spot where he’d dripped chocolate on his shirt. It did the same for Draco, who closed his eyes as the simple gesture sent a shock through his body.
Draco moaned and arched his back as Harry took his cock in his mouth. The first time Harry had given him a blowjob, Draco had been silently surprised at how
After their first stuffing session that night, Draco had been clear and firm in his parameters for their little arrangement. The morning after, he had woken with Harry’s hand on his tummy, and he had known that he had to clarify his position.
“I’m good,” Draco said, scooting over as far as he could. He watched with a wry grin on his face as Harry heaved himself to his feet, stumbling a bit as he righted himself. Watching Harry as he learned to navigate the world with his increased girth had been one of the more fun aspects of growing his lover. It was something one normally wouldn’t give much thought to in the realm of weight gain, which was part of what made it so hot for Draco. Harry’s widened hips brushed the doorframes, his fat arse nudged knick knacks off the coffee table, his thick gut threatened to tip him over when he stood up too quickly, like a pregnant witch. Draco had had to stop himself multiple times from ravaging Harry before work or on the way out the door with the kids, simply because he’d underestimated the amount of space his fat body needed to squeeze between the kitchen table and the wall.
Compared to Potter, Max had been downright small, tipping the scales at around 210 pounds. He had a small, flabby paunch, generous love handles, and an arse that practically announced itself. As nice as those were to look at, the thing that made Max a must-have on Draco’s wish list was the way his clothes fit.
“We should’ve done this in bed,” Harry muttered under his breath as he tried to lay beside Draco and hold him. The couch was simply too narrow, or the men atop it too large, to accomplish the task. Harry adjusted himself as best as he could, but grew frustrated quickly as his belly prevented him from getting comfortable.
“You like this?” Harry growled, a devilish smile on his face as he pushed himself into Draco insistently. He was so full, but
"We is taking you to your bedroom, Master," Quinn said. "Just as we agrees before. Then we is waking Mistress Narcissa. She is going to be calling aurors. It is going to be okay."
Both of Harry's eyebrows flew up. "Oh. Oh! Huh, yeah, I hadn't consciously noticed that yet, but you're right. Not good. We really gotta get in there and stop whatever he'd doing."
"Goblins," Amal agreed as the others nodded grimly. "Open the floo up specifically to the bank and send him on through. I'll write a quick note for him to give to your account manager. If all goes well, we can let him in tomorrow sometime."
"No, Master Draco," Ivy agreed. Her eyes were huge as she stared at him, huge and pale watery blue instead of the electric blue they would be if Father weren't so weak.
Draco studied the prayer the way Harry had, biting his lip as he read over the warnings and instructions. It was ridiculously simple to do the ritual itself, but he could see that arranging things so that no one would know what was going to happen was virtually impossible. The only complicated part of it was that you had to have one person walk the labyrinth while another person worked with wards around the labyrinth to make sure that the wards amplified the prayer and sent it out.
"You're handling the weight of your new duties remarkably well, young Lord Malfoy," Healer Smethwyck said finally. "Expect your magical maturation to occur in the next month or so. Your core is already starting to open to cope with the family magic pouring into you."
"Every wolf pack I've spoken to said the same thing," Remus said in a sad, thin little murmur that Harry barely even heard.
Harry called up ostende mihi and nodded slowly when Draco showed him the spot. It was almost the exact same spot where they'd had their conversation about whether or not Ron and Hermione could be trusted.
"Cut…," Draco said, shuddering, "Cut to the heart of darkness, that's what… what the prayer says. We won't just walk."
He waved at Harry as if trying to draw out whatever Harry was mulling over. Not that Harry'd figured out just what he had floating in his head yet. Really, the problem was that he didn't know enough magic. If he were older, say a seventh year, he'd probably be able to list all the sorts of magic spells there were. Now he was flailing.
Explosions of light erupted wherever the prayers hit the warped blessings. Draco laughed as he panted. Each explosion was a blessing letting go.
Harry snarled at him because that was impossible, but Dobby nodded that it was true. So Harry breathed in, slowly, and out, slowly. He locked his eyes on Lord Black, on Great-Grandfather Arcturus, and refused.
"Many," Draco said, running through each of the ones he'd learned from Mother and from watching Father make his way into places where he wasn't wanted. "But I doubt that I know any strong enough to actually get us in there. We are talking about the Ward room for Hogwarts."
"No elves wandering around. They're all in the kitchen," Harry whispered as he showed Draco the map. "No one at all."
"Oh, no," Draco said with a little laugh that was all nerves and no humor. "I'm quite sure it's very unwise. It's necessary though. Be ready to shield Mother. I have to protect her. I may be able to claim the magic, but the Ministry will never let me claim the title at twelve. If I can take the magic though, I can revoke their marriage bond and throw Father out. Or get him arrested for his abuse and for following the Dark Lord. That would be perfect."
Healer Smethwyck snorted. "That has to be annoying. I'd have thought you'd turned the notices down."
The family magic wasn't locked into Father. It wasn't trapped inside of him by the Dark Mark. Could Father even feel the family magic? Draco couldn't tell. That Mark was so horrible, so jealous, that he would be surprised if Father had touched the family magic since it was placed when he was seventeen.
"No, not that!" Hermione exclaimed. She pushed back out of his arms, hands gripping his biceps hard enough that it hurt. "I mean, yes, absolutely, I'm sorry for that, but no, that's not what I'm sorry for."
His breath was all shaky with fury and he could see just how his mum would have gone cold. The anger was hot, sure, but there was an icy certainty underneath that he wasn't seeing everything and that when he did, it would show him who his real enemy was.
To Draco's surprise, Mr. Parkinson barked a laugh. "Her mother taught her that hex as soon as she got her wand, Malfoy. She made sure that I and my brothers all watched as Pansy mastered it."
The library had one very dark thing, a lurking, viscous object that felt far too much like the Dark Mark on Father's arm. Draco snapped warding circles around it, one, two, finally three to ensure that its nasty influence couldn't spread. More circles snapped into place around a dozen artifacts in Father's office.
"Don't let Dumbledore in," Harry said so quickly that Draco stared at him. "I mean, keep all of Voldemort's people out, definitely, but you absolutely can't let Dumbledore in, either."
It sounded like glass and felt like jumping into the ice-cold waters of Hogwarts' lake early in spring. The fury left Arcturus' face. Wonder, shock, and then laughter that Harry echoed.
"You're biting yourself!" Harry gasped. "That's what he's doing. It's not the blessing biting him. It's confusing things and you're biting yourself!"
"Oh." Harry sighed and reached out to pat Dobby's bowed head. "Right. Well, one way or the other, it doesn't matter. Do whatever you're going to do, Dobby. I can't leave without Dumbledore's approval and Uncle Vernon can't keep me here indefinitely. When Dumbledore wants me back, he'll come get me even if Uncle Vernon locks me in the cupboard and throws away the key."
Even now, after finding out just who he was and getting magic, Harry cringed at being here of all places.
"The bond," Silverclaw said, his voice barely coming over the roar of the spell and Harry's gasping moans. "It may need to go."
He sighed and opened his eyes. A gleaming image of a woman with ever-shifting hair and eyes the color of emeralds stood in front of him. Her dress was made of ivy and a cascade of water that faded into nothingness before it could hit the ground.
"As I understand it," Amal said with another nod and a firmer grip on Harry's shoulders, "yeah. Lily was… not flattering about that being their only protection. I never understood why they didn't update the wards here and hunker down. You could send entire armies against Potter Keep and never get through. People have tried multiple times over the centuries."
The stubbornness that had gotten Harry through Uncle Vernon's beatings and Aunt Petunia screaming at him straightened Harry's back. The sheer determination not to yield that had let Harry deal with Dudley's Harry Hunting and the disapproving looks at school slowed his breathing.
Harry took in Mrs. Malfoy's horrified expression, Grandpa Arcturus going way too pale and Amal's terrified gulp and triggered the wards to knock Remus out, bind him so that he couldn't escape even with all his werewolf-y wolfiness, and then nodded as Remus got one abortive scream before toppling like a felled tree.
"Right, so, Mum's been mad on the idea of you joining the family," Charlie said as he pushed Percy down next to Ron and shoved tea into his hands. He had to help Percy drink because Percy was as shaky as Hermione had been. "She already thinks of you as family and we've, Bill and I, been trying to figure out where that came from."
Yeah, no, there was no chance that Harry was sleeping peacefully. Draco was fussy. He'd always been fussy. Mother, whenever Father wasn't around, used to tease him about how picky he'd been as a baby. He'd wanted the right blankie and the perfect toy and exactly the right amount of warm milk before he'd curl up and sleep.
"No, you don't have to stay," Harry murmured. "You can let go now. Shhh. It's okay. You can let go."
Probably. And, honestly, even if Dumbledore knew that Harry had escaped his aunt and uncle, even if he knew that Draco had gotten his father killed and taken over as the Malfoy patriarch, he couldn't get into Potter Keep.
"The blessing everyone's been hit with," Harry repeated. "It would have to be very old, wouldn't it? I mean, we know Dumbledore is the one doing it and he's been doing it for generations. Maybe since he was a young man, back in WWII. So it's old. It's not new. I mean, I don't know. Maybe the same principles apply, but what we're looking for is an old prayer, not anything new like you were talking about."
They landed in Muggle London, much to Harry's surprise. He'd expected to be somewhere along Diagon Alley, maybe in one of the side streets where the little, lesser-known shops were. Given everything he'd been told about his father, that was logical. Instead, they landed just outside of the historic brick magnificence that was Blackwell House.
Draco just nodded. "I could see that you'd been abused. Huge rafts of our schoolmates are abused, Potter. Three quarters or more of the purebloods. More than half of the halfbloods. The Muggleborn aren't abused, generally. They are bullied mercilessly, though."
This was Magic itself. Raw, wild, pure magic answering Harry's call, answering the prayer that wanted nothing more than to save everyone.
Harry groaned and curled up in Draco's arms. Great. They were gonna get another round of yelling at and this time Harry absolutely didn't think he deserved it. He'd just saved Draco. That was worth praise, not scolding.
Harry laughed. He leaned against Draco and put his head on Draco's shoulder. It was the most natural thing in the world to put his arm around Harry's back, to tug him closer so that they supported one another.
Draco took a neat step forward and slightly forward to block Harry from view slightly. “Enough, Montague.” He growled lowly at him, and the upper year sneered openly.
there for months to come. If you do not rest, do not calm yourself, do not treat yourself kindly and gently for the time being, it will take from you before you even realize part of yourself is missing. It could stunt your growth and your mind, and worse it could hurt you in ways even a healer with all my knowledge of magical medicine cannot heal. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
didn’t attempt to take Hogwarts, then there was no safer place to hide something precious to their master. And Severus had been building his reputation and trustworthiness under the headmaster for over a decade at that point, he was in a perfect position to sneak it into the castle and find a good place to stash it.
Killing a bunch of muggles didn’t sound very promising he had to admit, but he was also technically an un-charged man sitting in jail right now. That didn’t sound great either. Something was just
Heh, maybe Hermione would like to join the football club? That might be so far out of her comfort zone she’d stop babbling about Charms for ten minutes and discover something else she liked just as much as books. And memorizing said books.
Severus felt his fists clench in his lap, his drink forgotten by the side table. Oh yes, he knew—he was made Draco’s godfather purely because he had both Voldemort and Dumbledore's ear. Lucius knew he was in a position of power and wanted to ensure he'd use that for Draco's benefit, in the end. Severus and Narcissa were closer friends than the two men were due to a love of potions in school, but after years of knowing each other, he and Lucius were established “friends” both because it benefited them in the public eye and also because it was hard to spend years working alongside someone for your own gains and not be intimately aware of how they worked—the fact they got out of each other’s way on the most part was essentially a ringing endorsement for their friendship.
"Even amongst Slytherins it's… I mean, the last living person who was a parseltongue was the dark lord." Draco seemed to falter as he explained that, and Harry took another too-long minute to absorb that.
Harry was thankful that Draco didn’t even hesitate or pause to give his admission of weakness any more attention or importance than necessary as he took a pinch and tossed it into the fire. Harry just hung onto his arm closely as they spun once more into the fire.
“At about two or so they’re a silver color, then when they’re full adults they get this white glow about ‘em. They say it makes fresh snow look grey, and I’d hafta agree to be honest.” Hagrid grinned happily at the memory and now Harry was
He did so love to see the red head lose his temper, because truly it was a sight to behold, but this morning proved he
Strong as hell, but they were Slytherins just the same as everyone else in their house and despite Montague being a not-so-small support beam of how their connection worked, they’d dropped him like a ton of bricks the second he’d started to sink. Who even knows how many broken deals and canceled favors got tossed around when cutting ties with him, and for snakes who took that stuff insanely seriously, that was going to be the center of their gossip and speculation for a long time yet.
Secondly, having a wallflower friend who listened to everyone and that no one really acknowledged was going to be really handy. He
“If I win you lend me your notes on our next transfiguration class. I mean, it’s only been two weeks but everyone in our year knows you’re good at that class already.” He grinned, and Harry narrowed his eyes—Blaise’s presumptuous face filling his mind’s eyes.
Unfortunately he’d have to wait until he was older to see into that vault, but at least he got a chance to see who this Monroe family he was inheriting a name from was. On his way back to the front he trailed through this shelf-way and that… opening trunks that were filled with journals and clothes and even more trinkets he couldn’t identify. There was just so
to follow that up, as he slipped into a nearby classroom to hide out for a bit and found it absolutely empty.
Draco paused, his unnaturally symmetrical face frowning and still somehow looking graceful while he did it. "I don't know anything about the Muggle world," He said boldly, like it was something to be proud of; like also asking why he would have ever bothered to learn such a thing. Harry mentally rolled his eyes, but he always did like a challenge, and
they were getting a some free real estate by stealing it from a werewolf and really just inherited a problem they weren’t willing to even set foot on much less pay to upkeep. All this time Harry hadn’t even known that this property was technically his

“HELP!” he bellowed in panic, Hermione letting out her own terrified screech to join him, and even at this distance he saw the moment the teachers saw the troll bound the corner behind them. Even Snape looked horrified.
“Yes, yes,” She dismissed impatiently, forcing him to put the camera down and address the school brooms scattered on the ground around them. Harry hadn’t known the girl much, but she was half-blood from what he could tell and was

As expected the blond seemed to spasm a bit, but collected himself rather quickly to simply be tense beside him on the bench, expression grumpy as hell. “Well if you’ll be fine by the first game that’s okay.” Although he said it like it was pulling teeth rather than him being generous, but Harry figured that was the best case scenario with his cactus-like friend.
and Blaise dodged—but Draco was clearly training hard to be on the quidditch team because he had him by the back of the robes and then they were just shoving each other, bickering quietly with Blaise trying to finish a sentence and Draco kicking him to make him shut up before he could.
He was so over it though, and still so bone-tired from not getting any true sleep, he just sat up and took a couple minutes to breathe deeply and gather himself. He felt like shit, but… there was
"Slytherins have the unfair advantage of knowing all about Hogwarts and its politics before getting here. Our parents ensure we don't go in blind." He shrugged. Harry couldn't even argue with that, given half of what Draco had told him before they'd started.
“I’ll take them. With the extra features—once a year is totally fine if I can be free of my glasses for all that time. Do I have to take them out at night?”

“You were closer to death this time, but so far as fixing your injuries this go around was much simpler. Cuts and blood replenishing spells are easier than broken bones, and the complexity last time was your organs. No punctured or popped orangs this time, just a lot of cuts and bruises, no matter how serious they were.” She explained calmly.
“Because my whole family’s been in Slytherin since forever. Besides it’s the best house so of course I’ll go there.” He said immediately, then pressed his lips together grudgingly. “I don’t think you can
but he had almost totally forgotten that he wasn’t totally fine and normal and happy to be back at Hogwarts.
Seamus, bless him, not only noticed of the moment Neville was having, but took mercy and changed the subject gently.
To be able to perform all these spells back-to-back, without breaking a sweat, didn’t just mean he had a large reserve to draw from, but it also meant he could
Any sane witch or wizard did not visit Azkaban on a careless whim. Not even if someone within its walls might’ve meant something to you once, the chances of ever seeing them again were slim, so the effort of making it there and then enduring the wretched island itself for any amount of time was more often totally pointless.
He felt weightless, his heart hammering like thunder in his cheat and head, his stomach flipping in butterflies as he got taller and then the weird disorientation of getting taller turned into the feeling of
"Same." Draco and Theo chorused almost immediately, but they were much quieter and reserved about it.
They’d made deals with the Dark Lord personally during the last war to provide resources and information aplenty, Draco knew.
So, with Crabbe and Goyle not bothering to come look for him since their parents had told them not to anymore, he'd been free to pick and choose which room he wanted—there were only five Slytherin boys this year and six bed spaces in the two rooms of three, both rooms having a spot open. Since he was from a newly grey family and Zabini was the most infamously grey family there was, it was an easy choice.
of stuff in the wizarding world was way cheaper than its muggle equivalent—and trust him, he’d spent a lot of time going pence for pence at the grocery store and drug store he spent his stolen pocket money in to make sure he had just enough for the next small item he wanted. Maybe because it cost less to make it magically? Magic

was his example of “normal” then he was still slightly terrified of what the snake house could do with a few dregs of gossip here and there.
Neville… was definitely surprised, eyes getting impossibly wide when Harry told him, but he got over it pretty quickly considering. Even fessing up his lineage conundrum, the blond had simply been just as stumped as Harry himself was before seeming to come to terms with it.
more freaked out or on edge right now, he was already at the end of his rope and his heart and mind couldn’t actually take anymore, so he simply noted the mirror for what it was and decided it wasn’t as important as the other person in the room.
clearly had a rough summer with his muggle relatives. He was unnaturally thin, and despite hiding it well still had circles beneath his eyes. If they knew anything, which they did, he was likely alone right now and having gotten free of his relatives was not going to go back to them for the rest of this summer if he had any sense at all. If he
He spat scathingly. He was consciously aware there was nothing Lucius wouldn’t do for his son but this was insane, even for him.
“Turel is by far my favorite, she already knows my preferences.” Lady Malfoy commented conversationally, bringing Harry’s attention back.

Who, was looking very unsurprised to see them, Harry noted. In fact he almost looked gleeful, which was honestly a creepy look on him, more so than usual.
Luckily, today was Wednesday, which meant the fact Harry had booked it back to his dorm mid-way through breakfast to dive into the pile of Transfiguration texts he’d hoarded on his desk meant he was only missing Transfiguration itself, and History of Magic. The only other class he had today was Astronomy at midnight, so he had all day to figure this out. McGonagall would not be pleased he’d skipped her class, but hopefully she’d understand
Daphne just shot the Zabini a coy look and helped herself to some toast from the tray in front of her, ignoring his distain that would’ve had weaker snakes running for cover.
McGonagall had one, larger than those around it but perfect to lean against, getting comfy to read through his mental notes for the day and take more notes as they came to him. For some reason he found a lot of clarity there, on more technical subjects.
Draco as a close friend but would hold him at arms reach if need be. He was interested in and clearly understood pureblood dealings but was fully okay with starting muggle sports clubs. He was a Gryffindor who’d escaped outright violence for blatantly sitting at the Slytherin table. He was a
In addition to those three there were two Gryffindor second years and three Hufflepuff first years, a mix of muggleborn and half-bloods who were interested in a sport other than quidditch that was open to everyone, and curious purebloods who had no idea what was going on but had heard of this little get together and wanted to know more. Not a single Slytherin so far though, not that Harry was shocked. He could wait them out though.

rules of the game and why some of her tricks were very much illegal. She was surprisingly stubborn and didn't seem to care that she'd only learned the game existed three days ago and didn't even know the rules yet, but defended herself and her actions to the grave—even Lu the Ravenclaw struggled to pit his cold logic against her fiery arguments. Hannah and Neville seemed wiped and didn't say much, but Harry and Seamus were cackling to themselves as they watched Dean get more desperate to get through Susan's thick head. Harry couldn’t quite tell if she was doing this to purposefully mess with them or not, but it was hilarious either way.
talk to anyone. It was probably rude as hell, but he didn’t hesitate in conversation and he most certainly wasn’t shy with anyone, ever. Harry had never once seen him duck his head or avoid eye contact for any reason, even if he hated or respected the person he was talking to.

even if it was a day off. Draco hadn't said it outright, but Harry got the feeling Snape had made it abundantly clear he expected to see all his students at all three meals a day barring a legitimate excuse like illness or detention. Apart from a handful of Ravenclaws they had the Great Hall to themselves and on this particular morning no one even bothered to look up when he sat at the Slytherin table—he considered that progress, though was a bit surprised how quickly he'd gotten to this point. Or maybe it was because they were around mostly upper years who looked half-dead before they got some coffee in their system.
care about, was his son. He even cared little about marrying Narcissa except for that their common goals and personalities were so impossibly well suited he found himself loving her as time went on. He'd always known she was the woman for him, even back in their Hogwarts days; he just wasn't a passionate sort of person.
"If I knew I'd definitely quit it immediately." He snipped with a grin. “You have good timing, I only just woke up and I’m about to be let go too.”
Draco glanced between those two glaring at each other with animosity sparking in the air around them, and back to where Blaise was very visibly considering dumping his bowl of oatmeal onto Daphne’s head beside him where she was silently daring him to dare try it with her eyes… to the space Nott

Draco had clearly heard from Blaise already that he was alive, and being raised in a magical family probably had more faith in magical healing than Harry himself did, so he wasn’t
His stomach clenched at the thought that he might not be able to play quidditch or football at first when the school year started, only a bit under two weeks away now, and pushed himself to walk farther and do one more sit up just at the thought of it.
I mean, he loved Hagrid, but that system was messed up if that was the different in guides muggleborns were getting seemingly by chance.
ago did you get back on track with normal meals?” She asked and since it kind of sounded more like a medical question than the previous probing ones he answered it a bit easier.
"I agree." Lucius hummed, finishing his drink. "We should allow Draco time to continue to write this boy, but we will have Severus for dinner before the school year starts."
Again, Severus thought he was probably fine. Even most of the Slytherins were probably fine, as while Severus still did not understand what had exactly happened, his house suddenly
“Well how lovely and appropriately eerie for a rouge Slytherin.” He complimented cheerily, and her face flickered in surprise, before her smile turned wry. “I know Slytherins don’t do friendly, but you’re very good at it.”
Another long silence… before she nodded once, a tiny movement as if afraid someone would see her even agreeing to this in the safety of her own home.
“Oi, buzz off.” He snipped at her immediately, and Draco saw Harry startle by his sudden change in personality. Well, Harry only ever got to see Blaise when he was happily entertained by his pet Gryffindor, so welcome to his world.
It was only a little before two when he made it out into muggle London and traveled down several streets towards where Tom-the-toothless-bartender had pointed him: to a shopping district. His last order of business at Gringotts was to get a goblin equivalent of a debit card connected to the donation vault that would work in the muggle world—he wasn’t allowed to have one on his trust vault and the Monroe account had limited withdrawals for money until he was 17, and he didn’t want to take a boat load of money from his trust and change it all into physical muggle money that he may or may not use up.

And he had heard about house elves, he knew the general concept. Even Fred and George were chill about the whole concept, and
Given that Nott was on the clear other side of the group almost as soon as she’d appeared, Harry figured it was best not to find out. He seemed relatively fine with Dean, but Dean could bicker like Blaise could and he certainly didn’t have Hermione’s very straightforward personality.
while he bent down to inspect the now unconscious Neville on the ground beside him. He had just enough rationality left to recognize what Sprout had said and put his hands over Neville’s earmuffs, pressing them tighter in hopes the screaming of the mandrakes would be fully blocked out this time. He wasn’t strong enough to just pick the blond up and flee from the greenhouse, but he sure as hell wanted to.
He downed his drink in one go and stood, launching the glass in his hand at full force, where it shattered against the mantlepiece into a thousands shards. It was probably part of some priceless set worth hundreds of galleons, and that made it all the more vindictive and satisfying.
If he were thinking straight he might’ve realized it was because he’d been pushing his core all year to get ahead in Transfiguration, and then just
her favorite student, so this fast-pace of learning was made easier by the fact McGonagall let him knock on her office door almost at any hour of the day she was there and bother her with questions—and what was even better, was that she seemed genuinely happy to entertain him.
But Neville had tried to help and no one had listened to him, and while Dean and Seamus weren’t here to give their sides of the story, it was clear everyone else was feeling a little bit of proximity guilt. They weren’t exactly to blame at all for what happened—even Neville’s warning might not have changed anything—but they’d been complicit in creating the attitude they all had that Neville wasn’t credible.
He huffed and took another sip of his massive tea, adding another point to his mental list of ‘what was wrong with this school’. He wasn’t sure what he was going to do with that list but he was going to keep track none the less.
what the hat had meant by needing to think like a Slytherin while he was in Gryffindor to get places: he was making friends in order to obtain some kind of status for himself, and being a Gryffindor is what was giving him the opportunity to do such a thing. Gryffindor wouldn’t give him he time of day if he were trying to do this as a Slytherin, and while not impossible for Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, it’d definitely be much harder. Slytherin would be a tough nut to crack, but they
“I overheard Lavender saying Hermione’s been crying in the girl’s first floor lavatory all afternoon.”
And it started with Fred and George plopping down on either side of him at breakfast, two hands simultaneously stealing his sausages before he could stop them, but his irritation was derailed by their news.
“Non-magic folk,” he supplied easily, either not noticing or not caring about the sudden shift in conversation as his black eyes grinned down at him cheerily, and Harry had a feeling it was the former. All that told him though, was that Hagrid was a bit slow on the uptake… and he was genuinely kind, to have said something like that for no other ulterior motive than that he believed it to be true.
but you don’t really ever tell me to stop like Draco does, you just worry. I can see it on your face like

"You could spin it easily for both the Dark and Light Lords—you wanted to give Draco a chance at 'coercing' Potter over to our side. Meanwhile, that old coot of a Headmaster would gladly buy that you're simply looking after Lily's son."

to enact a prank they’d apparently been planning for a couple weeks now, so it was certainly going to be a doozy.
Maybe he’d given a little too much thought to his graveyard, because he’d looked up far too many different types of materials used for headstones and now knew an unsettling amount about marble and granite, to be fair. But even he with his eleven-year-old muggle education knew that pumice floated on water, marble sunk. If you punched a stick of chalk, it’d crumble, while if you punched a statue, you’d break your hand.
and he did not like how his heart was slowly sinking into something too close to anger and hate for his liking. He hadn’t felt this way since last Christmas standing in front of that thrice-damned mirror, and he
Also, annoyingly enough, the entire thing was set on a concrete slab to keep it level and prevent it being waterlogged so he couldn’t cut the bottom and dig out quickly either.
Blaise had obviously made the whole house aware of what had happened even before Harry set foot out of the hospital wing, and Slytherins had complicated emotions about the dark lord. He wasn’t the person they were going to talk to about it though, or even talk about it in front of him, so it kind of felt like there’d been an elephant at the table with them no one was talking about despite being otherwise actually willing to talk to him in general now.
Thankfully she seemed just fine with that short answer, and both were saved by Draco and his father returning to them after their side conversation.
He didn’t want to confess he’d just fallen asleep like a child, and pointedly ignored Theo who was smirking into his book. For once Harry was thankful he just stayed quiet with his knowledge.
Realistically, going by what Daphne had said last year, even if he were miraculously innocent there was no way he’d be sane enough to be an actual guardian if he were to be released. Azkaban was just that bad that people didn’t just walk away from over a decade in there perfectly
knew the feeling of straightening your spine and being proud of who you were for once, after so long of being your own worst enemy. Of coming out the other side and wondering why you’d spent so long being your own critic when you realized how many legitimate critics there were in the world. Of realizing you could be happy by being on your own team for once.
He didn’t break his gaze away from her, half afraid this was going to be a dream or a joke if he broke eye contact, but he addressed Hagrid.
at that thought." Blaise—the untouchable Slytherin and possibly one of the only people who could get away with saying something like that—mimicked barfing and still somehow looked composed while he did it.
Blaise snorted a bit ungracefully into his pumpkin juice… and more interestingly, Nott put his book up in front of his face in a motion so quick it was already up by the time Harry’s eyes went to the sudden movement out of the corner of his eye.
When Lily had been sorted, she'd looked back at him with an identical look that her son had just given his godson. Apologetic, comforting, encouraging, hopeful. Hopeful that despite being in warring houses they could still be friends.
Harry's eyes went wide, and his mind left the awkward conversation about ten miles beneath him as his heart and mind leapt from his body and made a mad dash for the heavens.
“That you do. And also, I hope you don’t mind but I shared it with Professor Vector as well, so that she could double check the calculations for me. I was fairly certain of it myself, but having another pair of eyes on something so delicate is always a good tactic.”
And Blaise had to admit, that was one of the cleverest things his roommate had ever said. Draco had a bad habit of outright leaning on his father’s position like it was his own—but this was an improvement by far, even if it wasn’t the greatest comeback in the world.

“So let’s give the command a go; it should give you a general idea of how in control you are with the broom. If it obediently jumps up then you might be good to move to the next bit, but if you struggle you’ll definitely want to work more on getting a handle on it before leaving the ground.” He directed, not feeling the need to get off his broom but sitting side-saddle lazily as he circled around them ten feet up while he gave his instructions. He was
Harry paused, thinking over exactly how he wanted to phrase this. He couldn’t exactly come out and say that Hagrid’s implication that Dumbledore was using a three-headed hellhound for a
ranks pretty low on stuff I care about right now.” Harry dismissed it entirely, before meeting his grey gaze with a wide green plead of his own. “I need your help.”
“Maybe I’ll care more when the adrenaline wears off?” he offered helplessly instead, and Draco slumped into the table in front of him with an equal amount of helplessness that didn’t quite match Harry’s. And it also called attention to the lack of plate in front of him. “And you should really eat something, you know. If you’re going to fret like a hen then at least do it on a full stomach.”
He raised a brow at that, looking back over towards the mantle where the stone snakes seemed to be just as a loss as he felt by that, if not incredulous at the implication as well.
“Take the advice.” He offered helpfully, and he started nodding rapidly enough that Dean let him go.
Because seriously. Not one person in this house gave a shit Montague had cheated—cheating was a fully viable option in the snake house because sometimes, that’s just how you got what you wanted. Cheating was not only fair game, it was fully expected on every level among them. In fact it was more of a surprise when someone played
reason as to why he acted like that, but Harry was going to ignore it for now. Neville was at least being civil in that he was trying his hardest to pretend like Draco wasn’t there, facing forward as they made their way past the greenhouses and headed towards Hagrid’s instead of so much as twitching at Draco’s pointed barbs.
“…McGonagall would let him go, but then Harry’d have to be alone with Mother and he’s not a fan of that. I want to go too.” He admitted.

Maybe it was exacerbated in his memories, as he’d been a child then. He was an adult when he dealt with the Dark Lord and his followers, but in school he’d been a child who’d been against not only his own house, but a wrathful pack of senseless, vicious lions with no teacher willing to back a slimy
and the feeling left his hands and feet cold as adrenaline started kicking in harder than even when he was free falling—or maybe it just hadn’t stopped, and he was losing his mind from his body working double-time in fear and anger and rage on a deceptively peaceful, sunny, Thursday afternoon.
“I’d pay good money to see who kills each other first.” A fourth-year chimed in from down the table.
“Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind if you could get a perfect Potions grade or something out of the deal. If you could work me not failing into the bargain too, I’d appreciate it.”
“I think that is what he was referencing when he said you have parents who love you. It’s inconceivable that one of your guardians would take advantage of your youth and naivety as you’ve always had us to shelter you and teach you better. Mr. Potter, it seems, has not been so lucky. Even more reasons to why he should have been in Slytherin—most students with poor home lives often come out of it able to cleverly avoid trouble and with ambitions for a better life, which clearly he has in spades.” His father explained lightly.
Minerva’s plans weren’t exactly working out. She had hoped to use this threat of endangering his magical core to get him to slow down
“S’a lot to take in at firs’, isn’t it?” The giant man beside him chuckled. “Ya look to be havin’ a hard time takin’ it in so why don’t we walk up n’ down the street once to see the sights. We got some time, eh?”

But it was as he glanced around wildly after the elf, that he realized the shed wall he’d spent the last several days carving through… had been entirely,
Not sure how, but as excited as he was about this whole magical-world business, he was discovering he was super paranoid.
Axeclaw mention that name in different ways, and if what he thought was true, the Greengrass family was a Slytherin name that was entirely neutral.
“Mixing senses! Taste colors or hear scents, anything you can think of,” He grinned proudly. “Not too useful but they’re fun! I was messing around with perception charms and found that out.”
In any case, Draco was complaining because he was a brat, not really because he was against the plan. He was being well-compensated and it wouldn’t harm his reputation or status in Slytherin at all so long as he didn’t lost them too many points—and given Snape would likely be the one to catch them, chances of that were low. He was probably complaining because Neville had tagged along, and for some reason when he was outnumbered by lions he got more cactus-like than usual.
The shopping itself was extremely fun, especially since he was counting the prices listed on each item, using his rather average math skills and the information about how much knuts, sickles, and galleons were worth to determine that he was indeed a very rich child all of a sudden and could easily afford most of what he was seeing. It was one thing to see the piles of gold and another to realize what one gold coin could buy you, and the answer was actually quite a lot. Multiply that by the mounds of gold he now knew he had just in his
That did however mean he was between Harry and a very shocked looking Dean, who seemed to freeze entirely, having no clue what he was supposed to do with a snake on the bench beside him. Harry thought both his and Draco’s painfully straight posture giving away that he wasn’t quite as comfortable as he was pretending to be was hilarious and let out a laugh.
“I must be thick as all hell, because it didn’t occur to me at the time why the Lady would want me to come in on such short notice, nor the hefty fee I got paid to be here and not telling anyone back at St. Mungos I was going anywhere but taking some personal time this afternoon.” She confessed, and Harry perked up. “I mean she’s done it before—a lot of pureblood families pay healers under the table for house visits, and then even more to keep it quiet. No need to let others know they might be having
The next vault he stopped in was the Monroe vault—and to say he was stunned was an understatement. If his donation vault was chaotic and cluttered, this one was… well, still cluttered but it had a regal feel to it.
After all, she couldn’t heal them if they wouldn’t come to her to be healed, so being a confidant often took priority over being the responsible adult other teachers were burdened with being.
Draco scowled at him the boy, but Harry let out a peal of laughter that had the blond relaxing slightly. So the tall Slytherin had a sense of humor; that was good to know. The fact it came at Draco’s expense was a little concerning but Harry could work with that—Draco could do with a little teasing to bring him down a peg or two off his spoiled-brat persona at times. And Harry had intended to tease him out of fondness from the beginning, in any case.
He went around in circles for several minutes trying to come up with something, sitting so long Draco responded first with a confused:

with that small blond boy who came up to him asking questions about potions, it seemed like only yesterday but it’d been four years already. He didn’t know how Draco had gone from being his godson only in name for appearances sake to a child he legitimately wanted to protect—he didn’t know how Lucius was to blame but the man was good so Severus was going to blame him anyway on the belief it was his fault somehow.
For a child though, it could go from a punishment to murder in a shockingly quick amount of time and it set every nerve in her body off. She resigned herself to accept a lot of truly horrible things, and yes she considered herself a ruthless person for it, but the one thing she

himself spiral not-so-slowly and it was an oddly terrifying sensation. It didn’t feel so much like a descent into madness, and more a free fall at the speed of gravity.
Once she was far enough away to be clear of the noise and the exit was firmly in site as she made her hasty retreat…she smirked.
He glanced back at the two adults standing over where they sat on the bench, seeming to tower over them… and they seemed stern, but caring. Protective and clearly not about to let threats pass uninvestigated. From the angle at which they were looking down their noses at them, Harry took a wild guess that they probably had just as high of expectations for their son as Draco seemed to have for people around him, which was where the pompous act came in, probably. Then again, Dudley had the same impress-my-parents-at-the-cost-of-my-independence complex if not to a lesser degree, and definitely not as refined.
It didn’t take him long to track down Daphne, as she was a pretty easy person to find since many were coming to her for deals now that she had a solid reputation of it. What was harder was finding her
“Y-you’re Harry?” A timid voice from behind asked, and Harry braced himself for the inevitable. But when he glanced back, the blue eyes that’s been staring at the back of his head dropped to the floor. “…thank you.” Was all he said instead.
“You clearly know the parts of a plant, and a lot about the medicinal properties of it all. I mean it just struck me as a thought that you might like it, not saying you should or anything.”
Hannah was perfectly content deflecting questions her way and while Neville was the most senior of anyone here, his timid personality meant pretty much no one asked him questions first.
“That’s right!” Harry agreed eagerly. “We all kind of know where our skill levels are and who we work well with, so I think if we just pick teams amongst ourselves it should work out fine. I don’t want to do team captains or anything as even that sounds like too much pressure.”
“Harry, forgive her,” Neville seemed annoyingly amused by his reaction while Harry was still pissy and worked up about the whole thing.
this train glide away, leaving him behind in his old life while the people on here went off to a world of magic, he’d be a bit put out too.
“That’s good. I was worried she had a blibbering humdinger bothering her.” Luna broke into his thoughts, and he looked over to see she was observing the same situation below them as Harry was.
Draco was actually a lot more fun, compared to last year where he’d shopped on his own following the advice he’d been given via letters. Now that he actually had a year of magical education under his belt to know generally what he needed and Draco beside him to discuss the pros and cons of some things versus others, the process was a lot more enjoyable, like they were actually hanging out instead of doing errands.
Lucius seemed to expect this reaction and didn’t even blink, simply taking a delicate sip of his drink and slowly rolling it around is glass thoughtfully for a long couple seconds.
for writing them all off, but he wouldn’t outright scribble them out—if he got desperate enough, who knew? Suddenly some of those reasons might not look too bad.
"What is a Gryffindor doing here, Potter? Get lost." He snarled at the red head, hostility radiating off of him. He was probably a fourth year, and he looked decently pissed.
“See! Neville knows what I’m talking about. And here the actual Slytherins don’t hang around snakes on the daily, what a farce.” Harry huffed.

that his name truly was ‘Harry’ and not short for something else. Having never seen his birth certificate before, that was a relief to confirm.
Not that Fudge was talented, but he legitimately had perhaps too-much power and was stupid enough to use it blatantly for selfish reasons. She’d voiced her half-thought to Lucius but even he, who’d wormed his way into being a close confidant to the Minister over the years, had never been able to make a dent in Fudge’s rock-solid
conflict. And given they had a couple weeks of magic under their belts, let’s just say they were not prepared for the amount of conflict he could bring down on them. Especially not when the twins had learned of his
And oh yeah, at the very bottom he asked for Neville Longbottom, Rubeus Hagrid, Remus Lupin, Susan & Amelia Bones, and Engel Osmias to be allowed to contact him through his mail wards.
about this concept but he figured a bit of mischief was just what the morning needed to stop feeling so mellow and cautious.
It was certainly a grim thought, but one he’d first recognized and developed very early into his first year at Hogwarts when he was more actively focused on infiltrating the Slytherin table. He could read the writing on the wall—he wasn’t an idiot who thought that anything he’d done with the Slytherins so far would’ve been possible if the Dark Lord, AKA his blatant enemy, was still around
“I—I can’t—I didn’t-!” He stuttered, face going pale as he was now too high to just tilt off the broom to escape— and then the thing started bucking.
Harry was, after all, a Gryffindor who probably should’ve been in Slytherin. He knew it was possible, and the given evidence, he knew to tread cautiously.

chomping mouths. It was rather quiet apart from the sprinkle of water hitting soft earth, as predictably the flowers’ pointed teeth were young and made of a plant-like material, so their incessant chomping didn’t make much noise.
Well, if Harry were in the same position he’d be plotting hard right about now. Draco hadn’t told him anything but he trusted his friend had
be open if he wanted to, without any ramifications, and as he settled in at Hogwarts he seemed to be picking and choosing who he wanted to affiliate with. Draco was thankful he seemed to be making the cut, but also a bit pleasantly surprised that someone else was too.
And he kind of did, as tears pricked at the corners of his eyes and he really tried to keep it together, but he just couldn’t.

“It’s a pleasure! I’ll take good care of her, promise.” He flashed a wild grin, the guys accompanying him already having roped the crate to their brooms. “And it was nice to meet you Harry—watch out for the twins for me, they’re a handful!”
to wear makeup, he just didn’t like walking around with scars on his face. And with the way life was going at the moment, there seemed to be no sign that people would stop disfiguring him anytime soon.
Blaise glared at him before seeming to mentally sooth his ruffled feathers and tilted his chin up proudly.
“Sometimes those with weaker magical cores can suffer health problems if they’re not careful. As if your magic is a reservoir that can only do so many things at once—if they use it to cast spells then it’s

Yes, he said it for dramatic effect, but also to sooth Draco, and it clearly worked by his automatic grin at that statement—this one being more real than any he’d had so far this morning.

of blood on their enchanted journals after all, Harry hadn’t seemed all that concerned about injuring himself as a result of his actions, and literally everything about that set every nerve in Draco’s body on edge.
And Harry had been practicing the softening charm as one of his second year Transfiguration spells to get to, so maybe it’d work on rock cakes?
What he had a harder time with though… was that by Draco’s explanation of the plan he’d kind of thought Mr. Malfoy was the one arranging it and had had half a shred of hope Mrs. Malfoy would take after her son and prefer to sleep in rather than accompany them to the bank at the early hour. No need for
was willing to accept that role, for Harry specifically. And given how much he struggled with their house in light of it, it was all the more reason not to cross Montague if they could help it.
“Yeah, she’s female Norwegian Ridgeback. Only a couple weeks, right? So cute!” He cooed at he peeked through the slats in Norbert—
. As it was he was he was upright in bed, reading Dell’s journals and several transfiguration books Neville and Draco had brought him so he didn’t get bored enough to consider a jail break before he was healed.
“Can I hang out in the Slytherin dorm for a bit? That was… a lot. Don’t think I’m ready for Gryffindor right now.” He admitted, and thankfully Theo just nodded blankly like he didn’t care either way, turning to walk in the right direction and Harry following suit at a calm pace. The snake around his neck shifted some in the draft castle air and he lifted his collar a bit once more to shield him. He considered giving it a name, even in just his own head, but if it was going to disappear in a couple hours that seemed like a waste somehow.
He felt his eyes dim. "But people of any sort of background or magical ability can be horrible. Humans are both wonderful and cruel—that's just the way humans are, magic or not."
"So… maybe that was part of it. He wanted to erase the family side-branches so he would have all the family magic." He put together.
a joke then someone had even less of a life than Harry himself did in taking the time to come up with some of this stuff just to prank people with.
Bloody hell,” And yes, Blaise looked very pissed about that news, so Harry suspected there’d been many blood tests or goblin rituals Slytherin families took part in that would’ve made curing potions extremely worthwhile. Maybe he should mention to Axeclaw how much some purebloods would be willing to pay for those potions if he could remember to offer them up front.
, the feeling of all of Harry’s weight, the enormity of his bulk, feeling him lower his entire fucking
Max was wearing a Puddlemere United polo shirt that might’ve fit him at one point. At present, it clung to his tummy and refused to go down all the way, riding up just slightly and exposing the lower part of his belly. His jeans were so tight at the waist that his tummy drooped down, accentuating the fat at his waistline instead of hiding it. Draco almost laughed aloud at how comically tight the pants were across his rear. It was a wonder, really, that the boy’s arse hadn’t split the seams.
“You enjoyed that a little too much,” Harry said with mock annoyance after he stood up, then kissed Draco before shedding the rest of his clothes and padding out of the living room. His gut bounced as he walked.
So when Draco emerged from their bedroom one Sunday afternoon, their first free Sunday in many moons, looking rumpled and sleepy and positively
“I’m hungry, Harry,” Draco muttered, sliding a hand onto his thickened tummy and using his other free hand to grab Harry’s and place it there also.
These were the unspoken things that wracked Draco’s mind on a daily basis. It was a strange world they occupied together, sometimes.
“Been thinking,” Draco mumbled around a mouthful of food, swallowing. “I’ve been thinking that maybe...maybe it’s my turn, y’know?” He said cautiously.
When they were done they were both sweaty and sticky, and breathing heavily. They stared at each other, a distinct gleam in both mens’ eyes. For a moment, neither of them knew what to say. They had a large, empty house at their disposal, a huge comfortable bed, and they’d chosen to jerk each other off against the wall in the living room, like a couple of teenagers. Neither of them could pinpoint why it had happened that way; why their first sexual encounter with Draco’s newly formed belly, a belly that he’d grown on accident over a stressful two month period, had been so immature.
An unfortunate side effect of this, of course, was that they had had absolutely no time to further explore the process of growing Draco. The upside, however, seemed to be that Draco had been far too distracted to even attempt to eat healthfully, and had inadvertently done a little growing of his own.
The only thing, Draco realized as he stared at himself in the bathroom mirror, that he had been unable to scrub from his upbringing, the only thing that had taken true hold in his brain and lodged there, was the high worth that had placed on his own body image. Draco’s parents had fed their son only lean meats and vegetables; most food was bland and healthy; they had instilled in him from a very young age that “
He had told Harry that it might not be so bad, his gaining weight. He might even enjoy it, and he supposed that could be true. It was just so
“Dunno if I can…” Draco murmured, his eyes half-closed, unused to the sheer volume of food expanding his stomach.
he thought in a soft haze. Harry shoved in some more and then suddenly he was on Draco, kissing him, grabbing at his middle.
“Anything for you, baby,” Harry said, relief washing over him. Draco took his hand and dragged his lover to their bedroom, intent on using this afternoon for more than youthful indiscretions.
Draco sank his teeth into the chocolatey brownie, chewed, and swallowed. He repeated the process, moving even slower than he had with the pizza. Halfway through his third brownie, Draco looked down.
Draco laid on the couch for a few moments more, listening as the water in the master bath started up. He suddenly felt inexplicably vulnerable, his naked body feeling sticky and full and queasy and
He found himself in the kitchen, hunting through the fridge, when he heard Harry’s key slide home in the lock. He’d already pulled out some leftover pizza and placed them on the counter next to a pan of brownies he’d baked with the children earlier. Harry sauntered into the kitchen as Draco sank his teeth into the first slice of pizza.
He got up suddenly and made his way to the master bath, where he snuck in and joined Harry in the shower. “Hello, my love,” he said, slipping his arms around Harry’s pudgy waist and joining their bodies together. As the warm water sluiced down their bodies, their mouths met, tongues tied, teeth clashed. He felt grounded again.
, imagining letting himself go after all the time. And on purpose, no less. This weight had crept on, slowly, over a couple of years, and without trying. Was he supposed to just gorge himself until he ballooned like Harry? He imagined his body, cocooned in blubber, round and obese. He imagined a belly on his frame, first just round, then bloated, then sagging down. He imagined bursting buttons, splitting pants, ripping shirts. Could he allow himself to do this?
“Yeah, it’s fine. It’s great,” Draco said. “I told you I was okay with whatever happens. Feels a bit weird.”
“Love what?” he asked grumpily. Naps did nothing to rejuvenate Draco, they simply made him more agitated than normal.
He could still recall the first time his mother had made that clear to young Draco. He had been at his third cousin’s wedding, and about to chow down on an oft-forbidden piece of cake. His mother had snatched the plate away and dumped the cake in the trash while Draco wailed. She had yanked him into a room and told him to “cease that crying this
If the result of the equation was a spell (t) then if he moved that component to the other side of the equation to instead search for the exact amount of
Thursday night he quietly approached his aunt as she straightened up the living room he’d already cleaned, arranging pillows he’d already fluffed up an inch to the left and clicking her tongue like she was put upon to have to tidy up her own house that had already been cleaned.
Draco would not know something was wrong and it was unfair to hold it against him without even talking.
, but even as he pressed his lips together as tight as he could he felt it stream out the corners of his lips and down his jaw as there was just too much and he coughed and suddenly he
Harry had heard someone he trusted a lot more than this woman talk about his magical core before and felt obligated to ask.
But this wasn’t any other student, and even if it broke the rules she had imposed on herself for being a teacher, she couldn’t find it in herself to care.
The woman tossed back her head in an uproarious laugh. “You said it kid! Okay, let’s cut a deal if you’ll listen a second.”
to know that I never did see a muggle doctor except for my immunizations. The muggle ones. And the hospital treated me outright when I broke my arm once as a kid.” He offered grudgingly, recalling the time he’d fallen off a ladder gardening and Petunia had caved and actually taken him to the hospital to get it treated. They were horrible people but him having that blatantly broken an arm would’ve alerted people as he was still in school and it was again his writing hand—also it impacted his ability to do chores which was inconvenient for them.
The day had been long, but it wasn’t over yet as Harry finally escaped and wearily climbed his way up to Gryffindor tower. He was so tired, he was sad to realize he hadn’t even noticed when his
"Okay, let's try. I uh, have no idea how this game works to be honest." She admitted, and Dean just waved her off.
impressed to find a silver necklace inside with two charms on either side of a swirling white and teal crystal no bigger than his pinky nail. One charm was a pink bat, the other an orange bird. Harry couldn't help but grin and immediately slipped it around his neck—the twins were brave to try and get him something to match his outfits, but they'd nailed it so far as he was concerned. He had half a thought that maybe this was pranked somehow, but figured he was in enough of a Christmas spirit to put up with whatever they had planned—chances were that
What it resulted in was a generally empty wooden room with a steepled roof of rafters and three windows total: two on either side of the double doors that made the entrance and a small circular one at the very back center wall, no bigger than if Harry put his arms in a circle in front of him—but all three
have to be near the Dursleys again, to be their own personal house elf locked in their cupboard—eventually their shed. Maybe it was because he’d still had control over himself back then, and he’d literally only known Draco a day before hearing about his family’s dark nature—now they’d been friends for over a year and had literally
“Sure thing I do!” He beamed, and Harry got the vibe of a puppy. It softened him a little bit to this stranger. “I knew yer parents when they were at Hogwarts—dat father o’ yours was a right prankster so I chased ‘im and his friends away from the forest for seven years ya know. And I was there when you were a baby—I ‘elped drop ya off at yer aunt’s that night yer parents were killed, and you was just so tiny. Look at you all grown!”
twin had said that—and made a mini-speech of it too, without his twin interrupting for the first time since Harry had met them. The other just hit the ball back and forth with them like he was listening, but not truly engaging in the conversation for once—his face blank and eyes focused on the ball.
The dark lord would not be pleased to return and find the Malfoy heir consorting with his arch enemy.
He thinks to himself, and it’s not a bad idea. He planned to be friends with Draco no matter what house he was put in, but to actually
After all, given what he knew about the Weasley family then there had to be ways to support financially struggling families to give their children an education.

The cynical stone had been getting colder, that tiny flame in mortal danger of languishing, and with this discovery of a magical world and promises of
“You do.” She was… more than a little relieved he seemed to understand without her having to outright say it, and the tension across her shoulders relaxed some. “It would put me at ease if you would wait a bit before publishing, both because you’re right that there’s a significant amount you can add with some research and also because being a published author so young can have some… adverse side effects.”
“Hes’ got a bit o’ a reputation, fer sure.” Hagrid allowed. “Was always a weird kid too, kept to ‘imself mostly. If memory serves he didn’ like James at all but he was friend with yer mother at least when they were firs’ years I think. Caused a real ruckus, a Gryffindor and Slytherin bein’ friends and all.”
"They do that all the time, ignore it." Draco waved it off distractedly, tapping the table near him in a silent command for Harry to settle down and focus now.

… but forcefully tilted his head slightly so it didn’t look like he was frozen in shock or anything. He saw Mrs. Malfoy take a step forward and place her hands over her son’s shoulders pointedly, and he looked up at her in confusion.
He’d been right about the lack of a guide or a map, but luckily between the four of them and one or two probably unnecessary detours, they made decent time and recognized the hallway they were in as the last one that lead to the Great Hall at just about quarter to eight. Harry was

"Werewolves are considered dark creatures. As if the Ministry would give their savior to a dark creature so soon after the Dark Lord fell." His tone was blank but Harry was clever enough to notice the implied derision. He was sure a lot of the worst of humanity called goblins dark creatures too, so it wasn’t exactly out of place.  “Despite the magical inheritance there, the Ministry never even acknowledged him as your godfather, so he really had no claim even though the attempt was made.”
“Raised by muggles, as a reminder. Please teach me?” He pressed and Draco seemed to remember and then just nodded absently as he continued to fix his tie distractedly. With that settled Harry promptly returned to Blaise with a glint in his eyes. “And

“I don’t necessarily think breaking out of your house stereotype is a bad thing… there’s something to be said for being loyal, brave, clever, and wise. None of those are terrible things at all. It’s the other end of the spectrum… the gullible, stupid, cold, and prejudiced side of the house aspects that get us all in trouble, and then to have this

He knew “Malfoy Manor” where Draco lived was kind of obvious, but he thought the “il Nido” that Blaise called his house was just the Zabini heir being dramatic as hell. “The Burrow” was a less scary name for sure, but he hadn’t pegged the Weasleys as being one of those purebloods to
people and are their friend whether they like it or not, because we can be a bit rude about disregarding peoples’ wishes like that.” Harry leaned into Draco’s shoulder as if making the point and the blond’s ears turned pink once more, a small smile gracing his porcelain face even sitting at the Slytherin table in full view of his housemates. Harry called that
She saw his face, and gave him a grim shake of her head. “Inbreeding leads to insanity, Harry. It was a big deal he was in Gryffindor, yeah, but the fact he went insane and killed a bunch of muggles shocked pretty much no one.” She winced. “And, even if he weren’t back then… he’s been in Azkaban for over a decade now.
her points or provide a counterargument that she would respectfully entertain instead of dismissing out of hand like most adults did, and either follow the argument through to completion until she won with fact or hard research to prove herself right, or they had to call it a draw until either of them could come up with some proof or resource to back themselves up. She was the only adult Harry knew of that would concede an argument to a child if she didn't have a hard fact to support her claims, nor did she ever get upset by the questioning, doubting, or disproving of her own arguments/statements. She almost treated him like a peer—with Transfiguration at least—and Harry discovered that

Blaise stared back, dark eyes watching him with that poker face that gave nothing away. Unlike Draco’s regal apathy, but more as if he were actively considering something and yet hiding his thoughts.

“Draco, quidditch try-out aren’t for another week, what’s with the face?” He teased as they got within earshot, and the blond rolled his eyes automatically at the jibe before jumping right to it.

The person who checked was probably a wizard, and unless they’d lied to Petunia and Vernon about it and passed themselves as muggle
“There’s an odd number of people,” Ron was dumb enough to speak up, earning a glare, which he stupidly glared back at.
He also sent a quick glance around the table at the distant eavesdroppers who were still staring, and upon meeting a warning glare of emerald green, immediately dropped their gazes down to their puddings and politely pretended nothing was wrong.
sorry for breaking the rules of transfiguration but in my defense it was him or me and he very much wanted to kill me." He defended himself with his most innocent wide eyes, and she visibly softened. Only a fraction because she wasn’t a very warm person to begin with, but even that slight relaxing of her scowl made his heart lift.
“My aunt works for the DMLE and she made me promise to tell you about it—apparently when she checked your mail wards for me she found wards were already in place. Not goblin wards.”

“Yeah, it’s a lot of fun you know! I still think you might be interested,” Seamus offered the youngest Weasley easily, thankfully saving Harry from the very awkward pause that had followed his explanation. The Irishman was a good guy; he still talked to Ron actively despite there being a defined rift in their dorm and to this day Harry had no idea it if was out of pity or because Seamus was just an inherently better person than most and actually enjoyed talking to Ron.
Blood wards meant to protect against the dark lord’s followers meant nothing if the boy was already dead.
“Potter, this is a lot bigger than some Transfiguration notes. I would need my dad’s help for that, and a perfect score in Transfiguration won’t cut it when he can easily just tell me to study on my own.”

sign, but one he hoped Draco would at least acknowledge one day, when he remember he was supposed to be grey and not dark.
“No.” He huffed bluntly, and the Slytherin made a scoffing/choking sound which was dramatic enough to worm a tiny smile from Neville.
And Harry guessed the only person either stupid, cruel, or ignorant enough to do something like that would be Dumbledore himself.
like his dad but holy shit the longer he sat across from Mrs. Malfoy the more he saw Draco’s future and if that wasn’t terrifying he didn’t know what was.
Harry was anticipating a very loud night back at Gryffindor tower to celebrate their win, and so took this opportunity of being ignored to have a quieter dinner at the Slytherin table.
Logically, his earmuffs probably weren’t on right. Logically, as Sprout had just explained, it was a paralytic cry and in a couple minutes once the roots were replanted the unconscious blonde would be right as rain.

been there to see him literally get crushed by a troll only the night prior. Draco hadn’t bothered do more than go over the potion they’d covered with him briefly, already focusing on the next one since he’d have to get high scores for the rest of the semester in order to ensure his grade didn’t drop too terribly.
He was pleasantly surprised to get the invite to tea at Hagrid’s, and ditched everyone without a second thought to track down the man’s tiny little hut—he’d needed directions from Professor Sprout but once he saw it he couldn’t imagine how he’d missed it. It was tiny and warm with a big fire in the middle of a rather warm September that for some reason he really just didn’t mind. Plus, Hagrid had showered him in tea and homemade rock cakes—sitting down with a big blanket he was crocheting and letting him rant his head off about his classes so far. The giant of a man and his ferociously named hound Fang
The fact remained that Harry wasn’t interested in fighting to be anyone’s friend; he wasn’t interested in
He flinched, recognizing his expression had probably been annoyed. Dudley was silently gloating at him, sticking his tongue out from near the breakfast table, having been the one to throw the plate. And Harry wasn’t allowed to be annoyed at Dudley, he’d forgotten for a second.
Harry flinched at that, but was comforted that not even Draco would be able to have actually done that—he’d have needed his parents help to get his location from the Ministry, and while he didn’t put that past the elder Malfoys he also didn’t think they’d be happy to bend to their son’s will after only a week of being ghosted. That logic wouldn’t hold true forever though if he continued to not answer and the
And he could take vengeance on the poppies for their judgement, picking them with a neat slice of a magical silver blade he kept on hand for dealing with particularly bratty plants and putting them into a vase where they’d wilt slowly over time in enchanted water. Their bright, beautiful red would be a great gift for Harry in the hospital wing. He was fairly certain red was Harry’s favorite color… if he had something like that, as Harry seemed to like a lot of color, all at once.
Draco was quick with his reply, snapping a picture of his own bag. His bad mood from the morning had miraculously cleared off, leaving him almost giddy.
Draco rolled his eyes, closing the door behind him. She was lying on her sofa, her back to them as she stared at the animated film. “One day,
“I’m fine,” he pulled Harry’s hand off his chin, tugging him by the wrist past his friends, and the watchful eyes of onlookers. He dragged Harry out of the ballroom, through the lobby, and out the front door. There were a few photographers on the pavement, waiting to snap pictures of guests. They woke up a bit when they saw Harry and Draco emerge, but they seemed to stop in their tracks at the look Harry gave them. Harry took over leading Draco down the road, his feet stumbling ever so slightly. Maybe he drank more than Draco thought.
The waitress dropped their identical plates, and wandered off, more and more people shuffling in the door causing her to be distracted. A group of men walked past their table with her, a few seconds later, getting shown to a booth two booths away. Draco ignored them, cutting a piece of his toast in half.
“So,” Harry began, looking at him after the waiter left. He had his arms crossed and was leaning back in his chair. Draco mirrored his actions, raising his eyebrows. “What should we talk about?”
“Is he?” Harry sounded confused. “Everyone I know likes him. Ron and Hermione still think he’s lovely.”
They both stood, filing out of the room, the door shutting behind them. Draco sucked in a breath, not expecting to be alone with the glasses-wearing knob so soon. He gingerly reached for a pen, snatching it from the desk. He stared at the page in front of him, eyes flickering over the questions. He began filling them out, slowly, purposely ignoring the boy beside him, two feet away.
Harry stepped into the elevator, and Draco dully watched the doors begin their journey closed again. “We’re meant to get breakfast now.”
But Harry Potter was already on his couch, a cup of coffee in his hand, and a fresh outfit on, as he watched some reality show that Pansy liked. “I made you a cup,” he gestured towards another cup on the coffee table.
“Does she not like me?” The driver pulled away from the path, fiddling with his radio. He paid no mind to the pair in the back.
Draco stared at the wall behind Harry's head, eyes not really focused on anything. The diner had a few people milling around, but it was gradually filling up with brunch-goers. The new couple sat in silence for a few minutes, until the drinks arrived, the waitress barely giving them time to say thanks before disappearing again.
He fixed his hair in the mirror twice before finally shoving his shoes on and pulling his jacket on. He managed to send an Uber request before he stepped into the elevator, watching as it got confirmed. He stepped out of the elevator on the ground floor, step out through the doors of his apartment building, and instantly getting bombarded.
“Don’t do things that warrant a scolding.” Draco cut another piece off, eating it quickly. Harry seemed to glare back at him but said nothing else. They ate in silence for a few minutes, their plates rapidly clearing. Any sign of a hangover had vanished from his mind, as he downed the last of his coffee, with his final mouthful of food.
Draco nodded back, and Harry slipped from his reach, straightening his t-shirt as he stood up. The Weasleys thanked Blaise and Theo for their hospitality of giving up half their booth, while Harry gave Draco an overly-exaggerated wink. The little shit didn’t seem tired at all. He seemed full of life, as he grinned in a boyish way, running a hand through his hair. When his friends looked back, he stifled a fake yawn, giving a shy wave as they all trudged out.
Pansy was on the tube within seconds of their call ending and knocking on his door 14 minutes later. She had a Happy Meal for herself and had brought three large fries for Draco. She sat on the couch, unboxing the Disney toy that had been included to promote some upcoming film. “Talk.” She demanded, not looking up as Draco paced across his living room, in front of the tv that was mounted on the wall over his fake fireplace. His call had simply said ‘need to see you. Urgently,’ but now he seemed to not even want her there. His fries waited on the coffee table for him, but he ignored them too. He wanted to kick something or run. But he was in the lavish living room he had spent too much money on to ruin.
“Charming,” Draco responded, jointing him. He once again linked their hands, tugging him away from the table, and towards the main road.
Draco lazily rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, bored before it even began. Harry didn’t seem to notice, tipping back another mouthful of wine. Draco let his headrest for a few more seconds, before sitting back up and huffing into his hand.
“I didn’t know you wanted me to bid that much!” Cho snapped back. Draco could barely hear them, but they became clearer as she approached. “You just said you needed a date! I didn’t know I had to pay for it as well!”
“I just know balls when I see them. Said it to Rita Skeeter. She makes most men shake with fear.” She shook the fries towards him. He gingerly took three, wondering what they’d do when they ran out. “She’ll be all over you like a fly to shit.”
Draco stared out the window, his mind on anything else. His publicist was in front of him, shaking her head. He crossed his arms, and uncrossed them, fidgeting around. “I mean it, Mr Malfoy, this is a serious issue.” His publicist took a deep breath, shaking her head more dramatically. “The stories are getting out of control, and every time you go out, they continue.”
“We should go over our story, properly.” He kept his voice low, ensuring no one around them could hear. There wasn’t anyone that close to them, though. They were pretty much in the clear.
“Could’ve been,” he shrugged. He wanted to say more, but Pansy was in front of him, wearing a slinky green dress. She had perfectly done makeup and Draco’s teammates on each arm.
They finished their meal in silence, their most common form of communication between the pair. When they were done, Draco collected the plates, and cups, leaving them in the sink. “Are there usually paparazzi outside your apartment?”
George lost interest then, diving back into a conversation about a different match that had happened a few days ago. The others instantly got involved, Ron even seeming relieved to not discuss the love life of his best friend. Harry, once again, didn’t join, yawning quietly.
“Mhm,” Draco spat his mouthful of toothpaste out. “Look, Blaise and Theo just called, what do I tell them?”
Harry caught the not so subtle hint, nodding slowly. “Okay then,” he stood. “Why do they only come on weekends?”
The food arrived rapidly, and both tucked in, eating quickly. Draco felt strangely hungry, even though he’d eaten his usual weekend breakfast that morning. Harry was hungry after his morning of training. “We should go somewhere else after this,” Draco suggested, pushing his empty plate ahead.
“Pleasure,” Draco didn’t bother with niceties. His voice sounded cold. He stopped himself from glaring, though, offering a nod.
Theo gave him a similar look, both of them suddenly pitying him because of his odd demeanour. “I am,” he forced a smile, which to them didn’t seem very forced, as he took a mouthful of his coffee. “I just, I didn’t know we came across.. like that.”
Harry’s apartment was similar to Draco’s, due to the openness of the space. The kitchen and living room were separated by the kitchen counter, which had a fruit bowl, and a book on it. Harry directed Draco to the spare room, down the hall, where he could change and leave his stuff, or shower. “I didn’t bring more spare clothes,” Draco muttered, trying not to sound spiteful at his slight kidnapping.
“No, I have to keep you around because you’re my fake boyfriend. Now, go and get your glasses. I’ll make dinner.”
“It’s nice,” Harry said, and Draco rose an eyebrow. The boy blushed, slightly, averting his eyes. “It’s just more natural.”
They both remembered the last match they’d played against one another. Blaise had managed to get into a scrap with Ron Weasley, who had immediately begun shouting, which had attracted the rest of the team to the fight. After everyone had managed to get dragged away, Harry and Draco were left shouting obscenities at each other, threatening to throw punches, or worse. Finally, Draco had managed to lunge, Harry lunging back, tackling one another onto the ground. A yellow card had been flashed, both players forced onto the bench, and their photos splashed across BBC News that evening.
Blaise was already flagging the waitress again, reordering coffees so they could continue their catch up when the text came through.
He brushed his teeth as quickly as possible and began pulling on the first clothes he could grab from his wardrobe. “Are you late?” Harry questioned, his voice groggy.
"Okay, let’s start like this: who doesn't know a thing about football? And it's fine to raise your hand, I know there are at least three of you."
"We need to get him to Madam Pomfrey, now!" someone said, and Harry had already forgotten them by the time they finished speaking.
By the time that was done it was late—Petunia had not asked him to cook dinner and he didn’t have anything on him to eat either, so he simply set his tiny alarm clock and set up shop on the thin mat he’d had in his cupboard he was allowed to take out here with him. He made a note to see about getting some better solution on his free day out, but would have to wait a time so that Petunia had cooled off from even this small change.
“I’d like to end the year as I started, and figure this is mild enough not to give anyone a heart attack.”
So he went through every detail, mentally outlining every crack in the willow tree’s bark, exactly how many there were in his graveyard
“Don’t doubt my powers of gossip—I heard some Hufflepuff upper years talking about how weird it was McGonagall was actually running through the halls and made the obvious connection.” Blaise waved off his comment triumphantly as he walked up behind Draco, shooting him a wink. "Good to see you alive, Potter."
Most of it was just sugar with really poor nutritional value, and was in no way filling. He was eating them because by a week in he was irrevocably hungry, but by
In the mean time he was happy to check on his friends who’d disappeared off into their corners. Dean, Seamus, and Lu had fast become the three musketeers in concerns to all things football, and Harry’s idea of having mock games had gone surprisingly well. It was very chill, no pressure for those who weren’t into it and also because there was no point into actually winning, but making it an “official” club game had churned up the fire in those who were actually inherently competitive and the club had gotten heated for a while.
He looked down at what Vernon had dropped in here, and realized it was a bucket of soup cans. Like, every soup can he could remember being in the pantry.
“Monroe actually, if you would Zabini. Or you could call me Harry since any friend of Draco’s is a friend of mine.” He positively
“I need you to fetch these potions if you could; I believe Lady Malfoy said she’d foot the bill if we needed anything.” She winked once and the elf gave a tiny squeak.
fade, Mr. Potter, and I’m sure you can cover it as you have been quite easily. Next year you can learn the glimmer and it will be all the easier, but it should be the least of your concerns at the moment.”
Harry was absolutely not the first nor the last to be given a tour of this manor or sit in one of the dozens of sitting rooms designed to host and entertain and distract from the gentle flow of conversation that was all just interesting, engaging small talk but was definitely going to be used like a weapon in her arsenal at a later date. She might not be after him specifically as he was here for a real reason and also she probably just wanted to get to know her son’s best friend, but that didn’t change the fact Harry knew anyone invited to
Luckily, the back up plan worked out so flawlessly that it probably should’ve been his first plan to be honest.
Harry couldn’t get his thoughts together, but Petunia’s face crumpled into something nasty and bitter and acidic and she hissed at him.  “Just
“Oh,” he blinked, mind racing… but all the questions he had left were for Pomfrey herself, so he just shook his head.
"Of course I can understand you, you're speaking English aren't you? And what's a Speaker?" He demanded, and the hand on his sleeve disappeared the same moment a loud
and pages of it were filled with Draco’s handwriting. Predictably it started as it always had, mostly as a monologue from him as Harry was less than responsive as he had been all summer, but after about six pages of that he started asking questions. Normal things, like ‘how are you?’ or ‘what have you been doing?’. No answer from Harry, of course.
Harry understood: in a world where witches and wizards wore bright emerald and neon purple robes like it was nothing, plain old wood-textured
While he’d been thankful Pomfrey kept him under to treat him after that last near-death experience of the school year, he also realized way too late that it also meant his remaining time at Hogwarts had gone from most of a week to a little under a day left very suddenly, and by the time he’d sat at the end of term feast he almost couldn’t actually enjoy it from how much he was dreading the coming day. He’d had lunch at the Slytherin table and
All of it was gone now. He was not only pale, but pale enough that he definitely looked terminally ill and borderline grey in some places. He was sure his own disgust and uneasiness about his appearance did not help his pallor, but given that obtaining dreamless sleep potions and calming draughts was high on his list of to-dos, he didn’t expect that to change anytime soon.
While it was uncomfortable to think about, there was a reason Petunia had suddenly grown a back bone and just…
Draco cursed under his breath as he pulled out his wand to clean it up, shooting his roommate death stares. No one but Harry was surprised about the brief exchange though.
“… five points to Gryffindor for being the first to change your needle, Mr. Potter.” She allowed almost reluctantly.
the lengths he would go to in order to protect those of the student body who maybe needed it the most always touched her, too. She’d always hated never knowing, or finding out too late that one of her students was afraid to go home each summer, beating herself up for not being able to do more sooner…
. Transfiguration was his strength, so he was going to focus on that and with what he had at his disposal now and not being able to perform magic, he simply plotted, and waiting.
“Do you have any idea what they’re talking about?” Harry sighed to Dean, who’d chosen to ignore the two and study on his own anyway. He looked up from his notes and squinted as if tuning back into the conversation.
“Master Harry Potter sirs… Dobby should tell you—ah! Bad Dobby!” He lunged for the wall again and Harry grabbed him automatically, annoyed.
“Boggarts?” Harry frowned, not having heard of that creature before, although he did make note of Dumbledore’s apparently
He was proven right pretty quickly. “Just hop up on the chair then lad and we’ll see what we can do. Shouldn’t take too long.” Harry did just that while the man finished writing and stood, dusting his hands off on the front of his robe and pulling out his wand. Harry let the man get close, his warm brown eyes meeting his gaze but clearly examining his actual eyes rather than looking
“We can mimic the muggle way of calling it if you’d like—they’re called divisions, so a division 1 team is better than a division 2 team, and so forth. I figure, if there’s not enough people for a division 1 or 2 game, we can make it work with people who want to stretch themselves or something by trying out a different division.” Dean stepped up to take some charge as well, but even despite Lu and Dean seeming to know exactly what they were talking about, there was still a lot of uncertain faces milling around the group.
Well, he’d be less late given he was fully dressed and his bag packed, but still. This was poorly thought out, how they introduced first years to Hogwarts and all. First they’d only mentioned the password
There was a lot going on in his head but remembering that Draco was still his best friend and the Monroe family was now
“Probably in the greenhouses still. He’s spent most of the time since we heard over there, aside from classes.” She frowned worriedly.
Wherever Harry had drifted off to was cut off sharply by voices coming into their area, suddenly becoming clear as the muffling enchantments gave way to the newcomer’s approach.
Neville fell over at least three times in panic from her hard kicks but got used to it remarkably well, even managing to successfully receive more times than he missed them by the time they called it quits.
"But I'll never learn if I don't do it myself." Harry countered smoothly, watching those grey eyes shift… something bothering him about it and causing him to lean back off his anger and reevaluate. "I…I'd
He got the basics as he was desperately in need of, such as underwear and socks and a couple plain white undershirts that actually fit him. He was amazed to realize underwear and socks could
potion to protect Draco. The potions master had pointed this out and Lucius was fully aware of it—he knew he was going to have to take other drastic measures to ensure he wasn’t killed outright when the dark lord returned, but this one was for Draco.
Okay, I like to make things as consistent and close to the canon world as I can when I write (not characters, as I love to mess with those, but the world itself I like to be as true to the original creation as I can make it while also taking all the artistic liberties I want—really what I decide to be realistic about is kind of a toss-up but when I DO want to make it realistic I do research), but JK Rowling was truly magical when she thought up the Hogwarts classes schedule because it makes NO SENSE. Trolling the HP wiki pages, the books, references… there’s just no way some classes could’ve possibly happened at certain times with all the blatant contradictions and only four/five class periods a day.
He simply reacted when Quirrell obeyed some command and lurched forward, despite the fact he would not be able to breathe again.
know some parts of it weren’t totally made up. The chapter on facing a mountain troll had been a little too real if also a lot less graphic than his own encounter, which meant there was a
but he was clearly keeping his snarkier comments to himself until Harry was at least out of the hospital wing. Instead they’d spent the meal going over the class notes Harry missed while he was out—the only class he’d missed actually, which was unfortunately potions.
Draco, tossing his arms around the blond, burying his face in his shoulder and hugging the ever living life out of him.
“I think I’m going to walk around the lake, I’ve missed the grounds.” Harry announced as they left the Great Hall post-lunch. The great thing about his schedule was that he had no Monday afternoon classes, and it was honestly a relief to have such a light first day of the week. Tomorrow was double potions and then History of Magic, which would just be flat out painful, so he’d take the break while he could.
Slytherins his age he could handle, but these adults were like every other adult in his life apart from McGonagall
But then, he realized Harry was shaking and small sniffles were coming from behind his shoulder where his friend had buried himself out of sight, and he instantly had a newfound strength in hugging him as tightly as he could.
After one last moment to gather himself he released the hug and stood back to offer Draco his most earnest smile, and was thankful when Draco seemed to accept it with a smile of his own. Seeming to remember his manners a bit too late, Harry looked at the Malfoy parents accompanying their son and flashed them a much more manufactured, but probably more convincing smile of politeness.
reputation is the one that would take a hit—everyone knew Professor Snape was a strict old bat and that he was always more likely to say no than anything else, but if Draco went to Gryffindor for his help, that most certainly wouldn’t help his reputation amongst fellow snakes.
And on another note, McGonagall had also mentioned it was his father’s best subject, and while he found himself looking up to his mother and all the ways he could emulate her, he found having this one small part of himself in common with his father was warming.
And because he was brilliant at what he did, he’d managed to track down and convince Fred and George to join their budding football club. He tried to apologize to them, but they’d cut him off and hadn’t even let him finish speaking before going off about something else, so he still didn’t know what their opinion on the matter was. Since it was pretty hard to track them down and
Harry relayed that message and Draco seemed to melt in relief some, before standing up straight and returning to a very serious expression Harry hadn’t seen him wear before. "This is concerning. I mean… not
He recognized he’d had bouts of accidental magic in the past, although nothing to ever call much attention to. McGonagall had told him some children were just restrained, and in his desire to be in control as much as possible in his life in Private Drive, Harry figured he’d put a lid on most accidental magic pretty early in life without realizing it. Anything to not cause trouble, anything to keep his life quiet and expected, after all.
attitude was a sour taste in his otherwise sweet start at his Hogwarts journey and he wasn’t interested in this
He didn’t realize he hadn’t lifted his head in days, hadn’t seen the irritation in the Dursleys faces as he seemed to ignore them. And yeah, he was ignoring them, because he was going to die if he didn’t focus on breathing and blinking and doing whatever task was in front of him instead of the world around him.
He felt his anger cool it a bit as he paled, turning and blinking widely at none other than Professor McGonagall, who was in the doorway to the school a bit a ways away, observing the scene in front of her with the killer poker face she was known for. She wasn’t the only one who jumped—apparently many had been so wrapped up in his temper tantrum that not even the Slytherins or more observant Ravenclaws has even sensed her arrival until she’d spoken.
“Any particular plans for this school year, dear?” His mother asked blankly in that way of hers she had when she was almost blatantly being nonchalant. He admitted growing up he was a rather…
Harry had wanted to spend on the place though, and done his own thing which, seemed kind of flippant, but then again Harry was an eleven-year-old wizard who didn’t know magic existed half a year ago and Axeclaw had been protecting his family’s money for significantly longer than he’d been alive so he could probably let it go.
“And these potions will… well, it’ll sooth itself out?” He asked curisouly, tightening his grip around the mirror uncomfortably. Whatever
It was totally furious and literally spitting mad, huge fangs bared in indignant rage at apparently being woken up. Looking closely though Harry saw its deep black scales had a very distinct blue shine to the light that he actually found incredibly beautiful.
“Well of course you’re welcome to stay here a while, I hope to have it cleared up quickly but it’s lovely to see you again Harry.” She greeted him.
left a lot open to interpretation. He knew someone was after the Philosopher’s stone, as someone had tried to get past the Cerberus on Halloween night
in this rather large shed. The structure itself liked to suggest it had two riding-movers and storage for ski equipment and other large-ticket vacation items that would need storage year round that actually well-off people might have in their sheds, but the Dursleys only liked to pretend and hated exercising so none of them had ever seen a ski lift in their life much less had the equipment stored up in here.
They chorused as they kept kicking it back and forth to each other a break-neck speed that left even Dean looking uneasy. It was as if their lightning-fast hits back and forth with beater bats had translated directly into a football skidding across the ground and now Harry
her to do a damn thing—no one could tell him who he could and could not be friends with and he was not about to do that to anyone else either.
If Harry avoided all other living things except for Hedwig the rest of Christmas break, that was his business.
On any given day, Harry could be the color of any flower, but his hair always reminded Neville of the poppies. There was nothing like poppy red.
He just jumps on you and demands to take your picture.” Of course quiet Neville would be freaked out by that behavior but Harry grinned, looking forward to meeting the kid.
They dissolved into squabbling and eventually got back to kicking around the ball, but other than Seamus continuing to give disbelieving remarks periodically about how it was possible, none of them seemed too tripped up by the development. Dean seemed to pick up on the fact this was not a
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN OH DEAR?” He spun at her none-too-kindly, definitely loud enough to be heard over everyone’s earmuffs and she seemed taken aback by that for a second.
He knew he needed to get back to some kind of equilibrium—Dursleys be damned he’d taken care of himself despite their interference and they’d really put him back this summer but
“Yer father and ‘is friends were a lot like that. Wild, smart-alec pranksters: drove Minerva up tha’ wall! I spent mosta those days chasin’ ‘em away from tha’ forest, cause they were too damn curious fer their own good. Musta spent a hundred detentions with ‘em too!” He let out a booming laugh and Harry’s felt his eyes grow wide.
Harry couldn’t help but find it startlingly amusing and automatically smiled broadly. The whole picture the blond painted with his chin in the air and his cheeks lightly pink was very endearing, and he'd never had a friend before either so…
books even. Given how important Arithmancy (muggle math in general) seemed to be in Transfiguration, and the fact he’d always had an
“You wouldn’t waste an old woman’s time by dragging me all the way out here for nothing, would you kid?” Anastasia interrupted, coming around the table to point in his face. Before he could respond she cut him off again. “I’ve treated my fair share of Gryffindors so I’m not taking no for an answer.”
Blaise gave a mock-salute, snapping back to his creepily cheerful self and the other three of them rolled their eyes in sync. “In other business-related news, we come bearing gifts for the invalids present and you will tell everyone that mine is the best.” He declared promptly, placing what looked to be two identical journals, wrapped in neat gold ribbon to be a package on the table around where Nott was standing. Theo himself had placed his own small envelope down as well, Harry noted with a fond smile.
They chorused in just as much indignant surprise as earlier and everyone leaned in as they realized this was a
He nodded, thankful for the calming draught once again otherwise he would not be sitting here so normally hearing this. He was also calm enough to make an educated guess on the other two.
about it and had no opinion either way. Because if he had an opinion, he was rightfully paranoid enough to know Dalia Zabini would somehow
“Eh,” Blaise was suddenly uninterested now that they weren’t gossiping about Snape, picking at his meal lazily.
Neville was sitting on his bed in Gryffindor tower, late after the welcoming feast with Ron already snoring and staring at the glowing white owl on the windowsill.
“I heard we have to fight a troll,” Ron Weasley’s voice was somehow loud enough to cut through the throng of nervously chattering first years after Hagrid left them to their devices outside of a huge set of wooden doors that seemed to be where they were going to get sorted in a minute.
In his series of questions, he’d started with why he was accepted at Hogwarts. Turns out all magical children got an invite, so score. Then he asked about school supplies and how he’d pay for it—apparently this “Diagon Alley” was a place where you could buy everything
“Hagrid definitely will, and I’d be shocked if all the professors weren’t made aware before breakfast tomorrow.” Harry pointed out. “There isn’t really much we can do for tonight.”
So no… others might worry their master didn’t trust them for not revealing himself, but Severus was fairly certain he could get away with not only not recognizing it
, compared to the hours Mrs. Malfoy spent entertaining him in which conversation was surprisingly easy and cordial considering this was his best friend’s parents and he’d never really met
“I’m more concerned about our grades for now though, forget fifth year.” Theo chimed up—clearly mid-way through Draco saying something by the blond’s indignant squawk at being interrupted. “You said the first quiz was about his favorite colors and stuff, right? How the hell are we supposed to not fail that in the mean time?”
The woman grinned, seeming highly amused. “Ha! This should be fun then, eh?” She looked at him, and Harry could only stare.
"You don't dress like muggles—or anybody really." They chimed in between themselves, and Harry was surprised about the sudden change in topic. Especially from the twins, who were the first to totally and entirely accept his weird quirks without so much as an eyebrow or second glance other than appropriately appreciative. Not that they just didn’t comment or notice, they routinely complimented him if he had a new hair pin or band t-shirt they liked on, but other than that never really acknowledged his style choice. And everyone else either just thought he was weird and ignored it or were pureblood and assumed that was how muggles dressed.
than Lily and James Potter. The connection to Dell was there, while he still knew so little about his parents they still felt like strangers he was bitter he never got to meet.
If she had it within her finely trained skills to heal, she would. If it was within her power to help a child out of a bad situation, if she could save the one without risking the many others she was there to serve and protect, she would.
