Draco turns around to see Slughorn almost running after him and slows down so he can catch up, glad for the distraction.
“No, but…” the girl started, but Potter brought his hand up, cutting her off.
“Harry,” Draco moaned, helplessly grasping for the edge of the desk. “Harry, please, I’m so close,” Draco begged, not even knowing what he was begging for.
“Shall we?” Potter held out his arm which Draco took with a half-hearted eye roll, his stomach still swarming with butterflies.
Goyle shrugs. “Playing some kinda game.”
“Detention, Harry!” Slughorn managed in agony. “You’ll receive detention!” And to his own utter horror, Draco had an idea.
“You don’t?” Draco didn’t mind staying away from Teddy. He’d thought it quite reasonable to do so.
In the past three days, every time Draco saw Potter, he’d been flanked by his Gryffindor friends and that had made him chicken out. But even if he did get the chance to talk to Potter eventually, what was he going to say?
come to
“Draco, are you okay?” Blaise took in Draco’s pained grimace, sending the girl a sharp look.
“T-That spell Malfoy. I’ve never heard it before”. Draco laughed, it was a pain-relieving spell that was no longer used. He supposed, in muggle terms, it would be considered a retired prescription drug that was now being abused. “It wasn’t a spell. I was just testing something,” Draco said as he let out a short laugh. An awkward silence fell for a minute or two before Draco broke it “Potter. Why do you keep following me?” he asked as he leaned against the wall and allowed himself to fall to the ground. “Malfoy. I’m worried about you.” Draco stared at him, dumbfounded by the situation. He shook his head to himself. Harry didn’t care, he had an ulterior motive. Draco just wasn't sure what it was yet. Draco sighed “I don’t need a lecture”. Harry nodded. Draco felt his negative thoughts coming back as he tried to keep his composure. “Leave me Potter. I need to be alone” Harry looked at the defeated blonde in front of him and kept his legs planted to the floor. Draco sighed, “Please?” he mumbled. Harry stared at Draco. That was the first time he had begged for something before. This made Harry question even more if he really knew the Slytherin. Harry simply nodded and left. Draco let out a sigh of relief that he was no longer being monitored. It gave him severe anxiety to think that his mask was slipping, especially around the golden boy.
Ron stopped shoveling food into his mouth and looked up at Harry “Should we teach him a lesson?” he asked as he made a fist with his hand.
“So what happened with you and Malfoy?” Hermione asks kindly, as she spoons some peas onto her plate.

Draco kicked the wall angrily and let out a loud sigh. “Just leave me the fuck alone,” he yelled as he brought his fist to the wall, drawing blood.
He was fine.
“Shove off, Potter”
“Whatever Potter. Just get it over with”
“We should probably start with you”
Draco was sitting on the roof in the highest point of Hogwarts, dangling his feet off the edge. He reached into his pockets and grabbed his box of cigarettes, he only had 5 left in the pack.
Harry smiled and rested his hand on Draco's sleeve, he was starting to wonder if the Draco he knew was the real Draco. Because now, when they were alone he felt more close then ever. He didn't care if he had the Dark Mark, if he didn't want to work for Voldemort then he was no different to Snape. Right?
Draco knew that Harry thought he had the Dark Mark, but he didn’t. Truly. The only thing he had hidden under there was scars and open wounds, some inflicted by himself and some by his father.
“But Hermione, he is-”
Harry ignored the mumble, unsure if Draco was joking or not. "Thought you said you were only going to have one" Harry said as he looked down at the large drop. Draco eyed Harry up "I meant 2," he said uneasily as he brought the lighter to his mouth and lit another.
Draco turned his body so his arm was hidden “He took my wand, that git! I was just trying to get it back”
“It was good,” Harry said poking his potatoes.
Both Harry and Draco are 15 years old. There will never be smut in this fanfiction so if you're here for that then this isn't the place. There will be fluff.
Harry tossed Draco's wand back and Draco sneered at him. They both went back to the Great Hall.
Draco felt his sleeve getting wet and he quickly realized the blood had soaked through. He needed to get out of here now. If Potter were to find out about his coping mechanism he would be ridiculed. “Give me my wand, Potter,” Draco said trying to keep his voice stable.
He wasn't hungry, honestly. He had just woken up but he knew if he didn’t eat anything Hermione would hang it over his head so he decided to have some food despite his lack of appetite. Harry found his eyes drifting over to Malfoy.
A single startled gasp escaped the blonde's mouth as he caught sight of Harry in the mirror.
"I don't have to do anything,” Draco said quietly but keeping his hostile tone, flicking a glare at Harry.
The cold air was relentless against his pale skin, causing goosebumps to appear. Draco reached into his pocket as he fumbled around for his lighter and the stick he knew well. Draco shivered as he pressed the lifeless cigarette to his chapped lips. He brought his other hand to his mouth as a way of sheltering the cigarette from the wind. The flickering light illuminated his otherwise hidden nicotine-stained teeth and blue, silver eyes; eyes corrupted by loss and pain. The toxic smoke danced around him and expanded into beautiful wisps of vapor before disappearing in front of him. The slight head-rush feeling helped numb him from his toxic thoughts. He stayed fixated on the smoke as he pulled another drag. Draco was infatuated with distracting himself with his pain, so much so that he flirted with death on a regular basis. It was unfortunate that he chose this addiction instead of a more harmless one because he knew this was just another addiction would follow him to his grave. The stick grew shorter with each drag and Draco felt a slight burn against his fingertips before he extinguished the flame. Draco pulled another out of the pack and quickly lit it.
Draco crossed his arms “Potter smashed it”
Draco and Harry aren't going to be nice to each other at first because they are still enemies at this point, and they have to warm up to each other.
“Thank you, Ronald,” she said smiling back.
“Malfoy?” she said with a laugh “Of course not!” she exclaimed.
Ms. Trelawney rushed to the scene “What happened?”
He pulled one out and held his wand to the tip before whispering the fire spell "Incendio" he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of smoke.
“You like him don’t you?” Ron said cutting Hermione off.
Thoughts were pilling into Draco's head and he was surely going to explode, he almost revealed himself to Harry, his worst enemy, it didn't matter that he was good looking, Harry wasn't gay and he wouldn't understand. No one could understand his coping mechanism.
Harry pulled out a potion from underneath his bed. This was his last one left, but he needed some peace and quiet. It was a dreamless sleep potion. He opened the bottle and sipped it, before delicately collapsing onto his bed.
She looked disappointedly at Harry “Is this true?”
Just as Draco was about to break Snape walked in.
Disclaimer: I don’t own any characters, places, names, or spells. All rights go to J.K Rowling.
“Did you have a nice sleep, Harry?” Hermione asked but the annoyed look on her face showed she wasn’t that interested. Ron and Hermione probably had another one of their fights.
“You're not saying-” Harry paused, “Did you just admit to being a Death Eater?”
Draco kept his eyes facing the floor, he was not doing this bullshit. He soon entered a daze, getting lost in his own negative thoughts about himself.
Ron nodded and put his chicken leg down “That’s true Hermione, but I haven't seen him wear short sleeves either, he doesn’t even wear them during Hogsmeade”
“Ronald!” Hermione exclaimed.
Suddenly out of nowhere Draco's arm starting to burn. He held down on it, trying to stop the pain but he couldn’t. He fell onto the floor, and curled up into a ball, letting out  painful whimpers. He was ashamed of himself, but the pain was too intense.
An awkward silence filled the room for around half an hour as Harry cleaned the crystal balls and Draco zoned out in his seat.
//BEFORE I START, NO I AM NOT DEAD, I WAS JUST EXTREMELY BUSY WITH SCHOOL EXAMS. I’M BACK NOW THOUGH//
“Pathetic,” he said spitting on Draco's sobbing body.
The rest of the day was uneventful. Draco sat in the back of his classes making stupid jokes with his friends as he kept up a fake smile. He could feel Harry's eyes on him watching him and just before his last class ended he told his side-kicks to go ahead of him. Draco waited outside the class for Harry.
"Malfoys do not beg. I trust you will remember this one day” Lucius growled.
Harry looked at him surprised “Why the sudden change of heart?” he asked curiously.
He heard his name being called out,
“Is this true, Mr. Potter?”
"Thought you quit," Harry said as he appeared from the window behind Draco and sat next to him. Draco opened one of his eyes- looking at Harry before closing it and taking in another breath. "It's just one," Draco replied in a defeated tone.
Lucius raised his hand another time, but Draco flinched, raising his hand above his face “Father please, please stop.” he said as he tried to squirm away, but he wasn’t strong enough.
You're a useless son, I wish I never had you” he spat at his son.
He glared over at her “Shut up. My life, not yours.” Draco said in a dangerously low voice. Pansy stopped talking and returned to eating and Draco soon fled the room.
“Well it's your fault, I don't understand why you wouldn’t let me see one secret”
Ashamed by his own weakness the blonde-haired boy dug his nails into his palms creating half-moon dents in his skin. He bit down hard on his lip, trying to keep himself from screaming but he was unable to keep the whimper of pain from escaping his body as he drew blood. He licked the cut which caused a slight sting.
Draco looked at the roof then up at him "I, I don't know.” Draco said in a voice that was uneven “I mean, it's just another coping mechanism” Draco said shrugging. Harry again wondered what he meant by this. “A coping mechanism for what?” he asked, looking into the blonde's eyes. Draco quickly realized he had left his guard down for too long “I don’t know Potter, forget it” he spat at him as he brought the cigarette to his lips. Harry could feel Dracos unease about the subject and decided to change it. “It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it” Harry said as he moved closer to Draco. He flinched as he felt Harry's shoulder pushing against his. He quickly moved away, wincing. Harry eyed the blonde “Did I really push you that hard before?” he asked, jokingly trying to hide his concern. “What? No.” Draco spat back as he recollected himself. “What happened to your shoulder then?” Harry asked as he reached for Dracos collar. Malfoy quickly spun his head around, grabbing Harry's arm, “I told you to drop that” Draco sighed before letting go of his arm. Harry let out a sigh as well as he stared at Draco. Harry wanted to drop it, he really did but he found himself intrigued with the Slytherin he thought he knew. “Well whatever it is, you should go to Madam Pomfrey. I’ll take you”. Draco stared at him for a minute “Why do you care?” I mean “Why are you acting so nice?” Draco looked at Harry, trying to figure out if he had an ulterior motive or not. “I’m not being nice, Draco. If you're hurt you should get it treated”. Draco shook his head, taking in another drag of smoke as he looked at the grounds below him. “It’s Malfoy...” he paused “...and I’m not hurt” Draco replied with caution.
Suddenly, the pain stopped and Draco let out a sigh of relief.
Draco and Harry made brief, awkward eye contact before Harry walked over to the group of tables Draco was sitting at. Draco avoided making further eye contact with him as Ms. Trelawney finished pairing up the rest of the class. “Now that you all have your pairs. I will briefly go over your assignment. You will use the spells we have been practicing over the past couple of weeks to look into the other person's mind. Your task is to find one secret about the other person.”
Draco hated this punishment. his father controlled when and where his punishment would occur. Draco had no clue when it would happen, but he knew when it did it would most surely be painful.
“What were you doing in there Malfoy?” Harry asked.
Just then the door swung open, Ms. Trelawnly smiled at both of them looking at all the clean balls around Harry. "You two have done just great. You may leave and go straight to your common rooms! I didn't realize the time." she said, peering over at the clock: 11:00 pm. Draco looked over at Harry before running out.
Ms. Trelawney shook her head “I’m disappointed in both of you, detention at 8 pm”
Draco angrily stood up, pushing his desk away from himself. “But I wasn’t, okay? Can you just fucking drop it? I wasn’t crying, I’m a Malfoy. Malfoys don’t cry” he said, with venom in his voice.
Harry just caught him in a weak moment, they weren't friends. He couldn't let him get that close again, he needed to keep his mask on tighter. He needed control.
END OF CHAPTER.
“That’s not proof, this is a serious accusation Harry”
A muffled reply came from Draco “Do it yourself”
Draco moved closer to Harry expecting him to move back "Aren't you scared that I might push you off?" Draco asked. Harry stared at him blankly "Aren’t you scared that I’ll push you?” he replied. Draco let out a short laugh “I wouldn’t care if you did” he mumbled as he put his cigarette out and grabbed another.
“Not at all. If it would help at all for me to speak on your behalf, in regards to the validity of the work we will be doing.”
“Weren’t you the one who found him?” Macmillan pressed.
“Hermione?” he asked. “What do you think?”
“Don’t you see, Potter? Have you ever tried to use someone else’s wand? Just as a loaner, not one you won off of someone.”
Draco felt his heart rate quicken.
the end of the line, isn’t he?”
—who nodded quickly, his eyes never leaving the pitch.
He had learned a long time ago that the Malfoy name was no longer one to loudly boast and throw around, and he had gone from a boy with his chin up in the air to a man who kept his head down.
“Right,” he said, still shooting Draco an ugly look.
Harry grinned at her as she walked back to her desk, and did as he was told, downing his cup of coffee and beginning to pack up his lesson plans.
“Ginny,” started Harry, unsure what he was even planning on saying. “You don’t
Draco managed a hysterical laugh, and kissed at Harry’s cheek and jaw.
Malfoy’s face shuttered at once, the shine in his eyes going out as quickly as if Harry had cast a
“You don’t know what I’m like anymore,” Draco said.
Draco took a very deep breath as he returned his attention to the potion long enough to add an ingredient and quickly step back as the potion hissed and sputtered.
So, unfortunately, now Draco was actually attempting to teach Potter how to brew the potions they were assigned, which was proving rather difficult. Thankfully, there were no longer at each other’s throats quite as much, however Draco was still finding Potter’s ineptitude challenging his patience. When Slughorn announced that today’s potion was Amortentia, Draco felt his heart sink slightly. Amortentia was an exceptionally difficult potion to brew, and talking Potter through it was not going to be easy.
Draco felt himself go speechless, finally withdrawing his right hand from Armstrong’s mane to trace his fingers faintly over the tattoo. The parts that Luna had just added were slightly raised and tender and he could feel the delicate lines.
“Wonderful,” she said, with a soft smile on her face. “She is so kind and warm, I’d forgotten how it feels to be around her.”
“Er…Malfoy?”
“I was rather hoping you’d be willing to help me with something.”
“Slughorn tried his best to keep it normal, but everything was so mad and hopeless. He just sort of let us keep making Calming Draughts and simple Healing Potions to slip to the younger students. Didn’t really learn much.”
vulnerable.
“They’re alright,” Harry shrugged.
to it?”
It was a rather intense game, as the Hufflepuff Chasers were formidable, but the new Gryffindor Keeper was very quick.
“Why should I?” Malfoy shot back.
He got four offers out of the six recruiters he flew for. He found that he was happier about that than he would have been if he had gotten offers from all six. It felt like that meant that they chose him for his talent rather than his name.
He walked out of the Auror Headquarters conscious of the fact that Potter was staring after him. He left the Ministry on a high, tossing the Auror reports in a self-emptying wastebasket on his way out.
in a time loop, then it wouldn’t matter what he said, as tomorrow, the day would restart, and no one would recall that the day had already occurred.
doing homework for it.
choice to follow the Dark Lord’s commands, even if he was only doing it to protect his parents. However reluctant he may have been, he was still the one who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He was directly responsible for all the lives those Death Eaters had then taken.
“Yes.” After a pause, Draco continued.  “It feels different, being there. Less…heavy, somehow.”
Draco blinked at him.
There were numerous unusual things Draco had learned about Harry Potter in the two years they had been working together.
He looked at the Thestral, who was staring up at him with his unblinking milky white eyes. Slowly, he let his thin black eyelids shut over his eyes.
Regarding the SEQUEL, I am posting the first chapter as soon as I post this! It's called The Strange & Marvelous Story of Our Revival. If you want to check it out, I'd love that, but I also made sure this story was wrapped up with a proper ending, so you don't feel like you HAVE to read the sequel.
At this, Hermione raised her eyebrows.
He dreaded the idea, but he knew showing Hermione he was serious about it would get her off his back. As expected, Hermione looked satisfied with this answer, and resumed eating her dinner.
Meanwhile, Potter hadn’t just been on the right side, he’d been what the right side had been fighting for all along. What authority whatsoever did Draco have to bring up the war around Potter? As much as Potter seemed to truly hate the attention people paid him and as much as he denied the title of Saviour of the Wizarding World, there was no denying that he had been fighting off Voldemort since he was a child and had been the one to finally defeat him.
“Luna,” Draco offered as an answer. “She couldn’t cover the Mark, but she added the flowers so that I would focus on them instead.”
“And…and they made all this—the suits and the rockets and the space…spacecraft—without magic?”
Potter and Weasley got back to work, occasionally glancing at each other from the corner of their eyes and snickering to themselves.
“Okay,” Harry nodded. “I’ll take that Calming Potion now, though.”
“Draco, let’s go.” Pansy got to her feet. “We’re going to be late for History of Magic.”
Draco’s heart is pounding like crazy now. His palms are sweaty and his feet are cold in the comfort of his polished shoes. He wants to run away so badly but at the same time, he wants nothing more than to fling his arms around Potter’s neck and shove his tongue down the man’s throat.
!” Draco fisted his hand in Harry’s hair – Harry’s hand cupping his balls – and let out one broken sob after the other while he felt his cock rapidly filling up again with the movements of Harry’s head.
“Noted.” Potter tilts his head sarcastically at Pansy before addressing Granger. “Hermione, tell me when the time’s up.”
Potter gives Draco a very bored eye roll before turning his head to address Pansy once again. “Well then, I think I made it very clear that I’m only doing this if the person is also willing. So…” he gives a casual shrug and turns around to go back to his seat.
want to test himself and find out.
But just as Draco starts to contain his shock enough to actually kiss Potter back, he pulls away and breaks the kiss, and Draco follows his lips blindly for a moment before realizing the time must be up. He opens his eyes reluctantly, blinking the dizziness out of them, and the first thing he sees is a set of bright green, slightly out of focus eyes looking into his own. Potter isn’t kissing him anymore, but he’s still holding him in his arms and this close, the green of his irises are even more intense.
“What a
So according to Blaise, Draco had a boyfriend now, and if Potter’s behavior was anything to go by, there was a good chance that
Draco rolled his sleeve back down and headed for the baths on shaky legs, using his time in the shower to make a mental checklist of the things he needed to do that day.
And Potter.
Draco realizes that he too is shaking, but from the sheer force of his anger. He’s clenching his fist so hard, he’s sure he’s gonna have half-moon marks on his palms for the rest of the day.
Draco was getting more and more agitated by the second, but he would rather die than give Borgin the satisfaction of knowing that. He wouldn’t be humiliated by this man who himself wasn’t any better than Draco and his father.
Draco looked around the damaged locker room with a heavy breath. Draco had never really loved Hogwarts that much, but he hadn’t thought that seeing it in wrecks could actually hurt like this. The Quidditch pitch had been repaired during the summer, but the locker rooms were mostly still useless.
Draco couldn’t have asked for better.
Draco wrote down in response, crumpling the parchment into a ball again and throwing it at Potter.
“It is and you are. I don’t understand; why don’t you put yourself out of your misery and just ask him out?”
“Morning, Draco,” Harry said, his head poking out from behind one of the shelves in the library.
Comments and kudos are
“Yeah, I mean,” Draco shrugged. “I’ve got the grades.”
want?” Pansy asked, dropping herself next to him.
“The Manor’s a big house,” he said in a cold but even voice. “Unfortunately for you, you never got the chance to see the inside but it’s an amazing place to spend the rest of one’s life in. If it’d been somewhere like this place that my father had been sentenced to live in,” Draco made a show of looking around in distaste. “Now that would be just sad.”
“Potter? What the hell? Why are you following me?” Draco says, confused.
“Hell yes, we do.” Potter falls into steps beside Draco. “For example, about what happened last week. I’ve wanted to talk to you about that since the day it happened, but since you’ve been so busy avoiding all interactions with me, I haven’t gotten the chance yet.”
“Look, I know that the things I’ve done to you and your friends aren’t easy to forgive, and I’m not asking you to forgive me immediately,” Draco ran a hand through his hair in distress. “I just want you to know that I regret my actions and behavior in the past and no longer wish to be that person. So maybe someday, you can find it in your heart to forgive me, but even if you don’t; it’s okay.” Draco’s voice cracked at the last part and he gritted his teeth to keep his eyes from filling with tears. He needed to be strong for this.
?” Draco whined, wishing he could just pull out his wand and hex Potter.
“No, I’ve got a new one. This one’s yours,” Draco shrugged, like he didn’t care either way; but who was he kidding? Draco
“Draco,” Potter said with an amused look in his eyes, stopping Draco’s hands. “We can’t right now! And definitely not in here. There are people out there and the next period starts in less than five minutes!”
He slid his hand into the hidden pocket on the inside of his trunk and pulled out the black velvet box.
“Draco, we don’t have to talk about this,” Pansy said dismissively, looking down at the floor.
was the one Blaise had been talking about. So that meant that Potter and he where… what?...
They stayed like that for several seconds – sweaty and panting – before Harry slid free and threw himself on the mattress beside Draco with a content sigh. He turned his face to the side – looking at Draco with a lazy, satisfied, little grin – and lifted a hand to brush Draco’s hair out of his eyes.
“I don’t want this to end,” Draco murmured into the comfortable silence between them minutes later, the horror of reality slowly drawing on him as he gradually came back to his senses. “Harry, I don’t want you to stop looking at me like this. Please, I…” Draco shook his head violently, his eyes filling with tears as he felt panic rising up his throat. “I don’t think I can live with that now. Please Harry, I can’t lose you. Don’t let me go back.”
!” Slughorn wailed in a very unmanly voice. “Merlin’s
“What does that even
beautiful,” Harry groaned, taking in the sight before him with hungry eyes before he leaned in to kiss Draco again.
Draco sighs – tucking his wand back into his pocket – and turns to leave. “We’ve got nothing to talk about.”
on his tongue.
“Is kissing the only form of expressing affections you know how to perform?” Draco mumbled against his lips.
A single drop of purple liquid landed on the tip of his tongue.
Draco’s blood runs cold and he comes to a halt. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
And now he thought that maybe, he
“Thank you, it’s good to see you here.”
“It’s just…” Potter tucked his hands into the pockets of his blue jumper. “It gets physically painful sometimes, how much I love you.”
“What is that on your desk?” Slughorn squinted, only just seeing the piece of parchment and rounding Longbottom’s desk to stand in front of Potter.
The red-and-gold team arrived at the same time with Potter on the lead, his athletic body pulling off the scarlet Quidditch robes better than anyone else. He gave Draco a tiny smile that was equal parts friendly and challenging; Draco tried to return it.
Four and a half months ago, after she was born, they’d argued for days over what to name her. Harry had wanted to call her
was …”
“I…” Draco sighed, his voice shaking with the heartache he had felt at Potter’s words. “I don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve you, Harry. And I don’t deserve to be that person for you.”
Draco snapped out of his thoughts sharply. He’d bumped into another student while he was distracted, and sent her books scattered across the floor. His own still-sore chest was throbbing with pain from the force of the impact.
“I, um,” Draco cleared his throat, bracing himself. “I was thinking … Mungo’s Healer Program?”
“What? You’re not going to bolt, are you?” Draco was sure that his eyes were twinkling with a thousand little stars. “Come on,” he said, and he broke into a run, dragging Harry behind himself.
“So you-
want to.
He was still the same person who had made great mistakes in his past, who had taken the wrong path at some point in his life, and still bore the stain of it on his left wrist. A year ago, Draco didn’t believe that someone like him ever deserved to be happy like this, but now here he was, holding on to the feeling with all the strength in his soul.
Harry tilted his head, bringing their mouths together. His tight grip on Draco’s waist had a promise to it. Harry held on to Draco like he wanted to show him that he was never letting him go; that he would never even dream of it.
“Alright, fine. Whatever,” Draco interrupted their conversation, impatient to just run back to his Gryffindor-free comfort zone so he could process this endless chain of train wrecks. “We’re gonna go now. Pans, come on.”
should have died that day, Malfoy, not her,” MacMillan spat furiously. “Every time I see you walking around this school, it feels like she’s dying before my eyes all over again, and there’s nothing I can do to save her,” he said, his entire body shaking with the force of the anger and pain in his voice.
with Draco’s friends?
Harry opened the door, stretching his hand out for Draco. Draco took in a deep breath, taking Harry’s hand, and together, they walked inside the room.
Holy shit! How long has Slughorn been talking?
to honor his mother’s memory, while Draco’d preferred
“Yeah, I should do that.” Draco muttered absentmindedly, sneaking a glance at the Gryffindor table out of habit but quickly looking away – face heating with an emotion he was unable to name – as he was met with a bright smile from Potter almost instantly.
“Anyway, now we have Dean Thomas, who’s actually a competent Chaser – no offense – leaving everyone behind and zigzagging his way towards the Slytherclaw goalposts on the far end of the field – you go Dean! – he’s getting closer and – THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT! YES! GRYFFINPUFFS SCORE!”
have seen his face. Tell her I’m right.”
“What’s up?” Harry put his hands in the pockets of his trousers, leaning a shoulder on the wooden shelf. Draco gave an awkward shrug.
“Let’s see,” Harry said and immediately added another finger, making Draco’s vision go white for a second.
Draco sighed. The truth was that to his own surprise, he
!” Ginny Weasley whined.
Before Draco could make sense of those words, Harry had closed the gap between their bodies and at that moment, it felt like everything in Draco’s life was clicking into place, right where they belonged. Harry’s lips on his, Harry’s hands cradling his face, his scent filing Draco’s lungs, and his warm breath mingling with Draco’s own ragged, unsteady breathing. It felt
“Harry Potter has spotted the Snitch and is shooting towards it like a goddamn arrow, and Slytherclaw Seeker, Draco Malfoy, is right behind him,” Ginny Weasley was heatedly providing.
!” Draco bleated, a ragged huff escaping his lips that sounded more like a sob than a laugh. He took a step forward and opened his arms, but Pansy quickly put a hand on his chest, stopping him.
With that, Goyle practically shoves Draco inside the classroom.  Draco stumbles in, glaring behind himself at Goyle.
Enjoy!
Draco opened his mouth to tell him to
Draco, how do you feel? Are you in any pain?” Pansy was by his side the next moment, taking his hand into both of her own.

“I will.” Draco ran a hand in his hair; he needed a hot shower. “We’ve got until 9 for breakfast. What’s the rush?”
When they stepped out into the chilly air of late October, a light shiver ran down Draco’s spine as the cool breeze brushed against his skin, and he brought his hands up to rub them against his bare arms.

“Wow! You look…” Potter gulped. “You look

Who had beaten up MacMillan like that? Draco knew for sure that it wasn’t any of his friends. They wouldn’t do that; not when Draco himself didn’t even have the balls to admit to have been bullied by him and personally ask them for help. It just wasn’t the Slytherin way of doing things. But who else could it be? Maybe Justin was right and it was just another one of the people that MacMillan had managed to provoke.
That morning, just as he was walking out of the Great Hall after breakfast, Pansy had snuck up behind him and – startling him yet again (for Merlin’s sake!) – had whispered into his ear: “DADA class, second period. I want you to get there at exactly 10:55. Don’t be late. Or early. 10:55 sharp.” Then she had pecked him softly on the cheek, adding: “By the way, you’re looking gorgeous today, darling.” and had walked past him, disappearing among the crowd of students leaving the Great Hall to get to their first lessons of the day.
! Fucking bollocks!” Potter swore, scrambling around his desk to where Slughorn was splayed on the floor. “Professor, are you okay?”
. His mind had kept going back to what Harry had told him in the Potions’ supply room all those months ago.

“I know,” Draco assured her, his mouth twitching into the tiniest smile. “Where would I be without you, Pans?”
He looks to his right at a very mischievous looking Pansy. “Yeah, yeah, Parkinson. This is terribly unfortunate and shit. We all get it. Now what?”
“It could have been me,” Harry almost whispered after a minute of silence. “It
, Draco thought.
Startled, Draco turned around to see Harry, wrapped in a worn leather jacket, standing alone just a few paces away from him. Draco couldn’t do it. He wasn’t brave enough, he was a bullshitter.
Pansy’s black eyes are shooting sharp daggers at him and the tight set of her jaw couldn’t possibly be more threatening. He can almost hear her high-pitched voice in his head, shouting:
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the locker room door bursting open caught all of them off-guard, and Draco whipped around to see Ginny Weasley run inside the locker room – ignoring Draco entirely as she passed him – and fling her arms around Harry’s neck in glee.
“Fine,” Pansy pursed her lips. “But I’ll leave my floo open for you. Just in case things get … too much, you can drop by any time, okay?
By the time they arrived at the party – Draco swearing under his breath and straightening the hem of his toga that had curled up from their slide down the stupid hidden entrance in the girl’s bathroom – the secret trapdoor to the Chamber was already open, displaying a wide space with towering stone pillars entwined with carved wood that rose to a ceiling lost in darkness.
Potter had said, and Draco was going to prove him right. He was going to swallow his useless pride and go talk to him.
“It was Ron,” he said, making Draco's hand still in his hair. “And the prat almost died on me.”
with you? Don’t you know who I am? Or what I have done? How are you
“…stay here for the night?”
At exactly 7:30
It’s only 10:35.
“It’s easy. I want you
Draco swallows hard, his heart pounding in his head. God, what is
Draco took an involuntarily step forward, taking Potter’s left hand into his own. “You’re wearing a wristband.” He almost whispered, unable to hide the trace of astonishment in his voice.
He hastily rolled up his left sleeve, hoping to find his Dark Mark gone, but his shoulders slumped in disappointment as his fingertips brushed the surface of the faded tattoo on his left arm. The Dark Mark was still intact, stark against the pale skin of his wrist and as shameful and disgusting as always.
“We’re playing truth or dare.” Pansy explains. “It’s Potter’s turn, and I dared him to kiss the first person that walks inside the classroom. I had no idea it would be you, Draco. I swear.”
“Oh, look,” Harry said, stretching his neck at the direction of a tiny blue head appearing amongst the crowd. “They’re here!”
“YEEEES! He’s got the Snitch! GRYFFINPUFF WINS!” Ginny Weasley howled at the megaphone and the stadium exploded with cheers of victory.
. It’s okay, just empty your mind.” Draco felt Harry kiss his head, tangling their legs together. He was rapidly losing consciousness.
“Bastard.” Pansy finally looked back at him, mirroring Draco’s smile. They didn’t talk much more, but that was enough for Draco to know that they were fine for now.
“At least she didn’t accuse Malfoy of dosing you with Love Potion this time,” The Weasley-girl said casually. “
Draco’s breath shuddered out of him and his head was limply thrown back onto Harry’s shoulder, exposing his neck further to Harry’s eager lips and teeth. Draco was already fully hard and throbbing with need. He was pretty sure that if Harry kept him waiting for a moment longer, he would go insane.
Pansy’s mouth fell open with shock, but before she could pull out her wand and hex Draco’s own eyelashes off, Potter intervened. “Alright, that’s it. Come on Draco, let’s go dance.”
“Not that one,” said Harry, and he leaned in to kiss Draco on the mouth.
“Yeah, you did,” Potter said. “And that’s messed up, I know. But I also know a thing or two about
are my sweet agony.” And then he fell into a peaceful, dreamless sleep in Harry’s arms.
I think that suits her!”
, and watching as I lost half the people I loved, one after the other, just so our positions would be reversed. All this nonsense concerning blood status was what tore the Wizarding World apart in the first place. And if telling off a bunch of Sixth Years is going to help fix that problem, then that’s exactly what I’m going to do. Whether you like it or not.”
“Then come,” Potter said simply. “Come for me, gorgeous.” He ordered, pushing his tongue back inside Draco alongside two of his fingers.
, Malfoy,” MacMillan took a step closer, his eyes dripping with pure hatred. “I want to watch as a werewolf claws at your skin and tears your flesh apart with its fangs. I want to hear you scream yourself to death.”
“Don’t worry; we have time for that too,” He smirked, eyes dark with lust. “I’m not
deserve it. I want you to never forget that, okay?” He whispered into the private space between their lips.
Draco was still recovering from his climax – weak and breathless under the solid weight of Harry’s body – when Harry slid a hand – fingers still slick with his own saliva – between them, pulling gently at Draco’s cock.
Draco pretended to go back to his book, glaring up at Potter when a minute later another crumpled ball landed right in front of him. Potter shrugged innocently.
“People die, Harry,” Draco exhaled a humorless huff of laughter. “And no matter how good you are, you’re still just a Healer. You can’t work miracles. And expecting yourself to do so is just downright irrational. You need to cut yourself some slack, love. You expect too much of yourself.”
“I…” Draco’s throat is awfully dry. “I have to go.”
” she panted excitedly. “Did you hear my commentary? I’ve always wanted to do that. It felt brilliant!”
. He’s right there, holding Draco’s hand in his own and smiling down at him. And it’s only the beginning of a wonderful life.
…” they screamed, shooting sparks of red and gold from the tips of their wands into the freezing morning air. And Potter looked down at Draco, a crown of tiny snowflakes resting on the soft tangle of his black hair, and his smile was so bright and warm that Draco almost forgot that he was pissed for losing to him once again. Almost.
And the truth was that whatever happened, he wanted Harry in his life, even if only as a friend and nothing more. Harry was the candlelight he didn’t want to lose sight of, even if he could never get close enough to feel its warmth again. So Draco would keep his distance.
It had been six days since Draco had come back from the alternate reality, and it felt like he wasn’t whole anymore. There was a sense of loss in every breath he took, like he had left a part of himself in Harry’s arms that night.
“Of course. Sorry, professor.” Potter tells her; his warm, polite tone not sounding apologetic at all.
“You were saying?” Harry panted, dragging his cock out and slamming back in.
“What?” Draco said, throwing his head back and looking up at Potter’s downturned face – his shaggy black hair framing it in messy ringlets.
Potter soared above the crowd, holding the Snitch up in his hand, and the sea of students started chanting his name in union.
Draco swallowed, looking at Potter’s determined expression in amazement. He’d been aware that Potter wasn’t really looking for revenge – he was just too bloody noble for that sort of thing – but he was still surprised to find out that
Draco took a nervous look around the room, swaying on his feet impatiently. What had he been
, Harry!” Slughorn cried, clutching his burned groin with both hands. Most of the students had gathered around him now, mostly blocking Draco’s view.
“Of course,” Potter said. “I’ve been meaning to give it back to you, I… I don’t know why I didn’t.”
Draco swallowed, his heartbeat quickening. He couldn’t remember the last time that he’d been this interested in something.
Maybe Potter and the others would never truly forgive Draco. Maybe they would always despise him. And Draco wasn’t sure if he could ever be okay again knowing that Potter secretly hated him, but he promised that he would at least man up and talk to him once; to apologize and take responsibilities for his actions. And maybe that way, it would be possible for him to let go of even a tiny fraction of the heavy weight he’d been carrying on his shoulders for the past two years.
“I’m fine. I just…I had a bad dream about my parents,” Draco blurted out a lie. “I was worried about them, is all.”
for informing me about the problem.)
When Draco turned, the spot was already empty, but he knew who Potter was referring to. MacMillan was playing Beater for the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff team today, and he still very much hated Draco’s guts. Draco sighed.
“You took so long,” 18 hours. Draco looked at him – his sagging shoulders, the bags under his eyes and the way he was holding himself; like he was trying not to sway on his feet in exhaustion – and sighed. “Another emergency?”
when you see what I’m going to wear for the Halloween party tonight. I’m gonna be stealing the spotlight from all you bitches.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter,” Draco brushed him off casually, hoping Potter would just move on from the subject.
? This Harry wasn’t the one from the alternate reality. This Harry might be his friend now, but that was it. He had already given Draco the forgiveness he’d been after; Draco simply had no right to ask for more. And he should never let himself forget that.
He had taken his sweet time making sure he looked flawless in his costume. He had charmed his hair to grow longer – now softly brushing his shoulders in loose blonde curls – and worn a wristband of brown leather matching the straps of his sandals over his Dark Mark.
“Of course they
…Draco was actually
“What are you doing out here in the cold at this hour of the night? You’re shivering,” Harry said, his warm breath a cloud of white in front of his face.
! You said you didn’t have one when I asked you for it yesterday!”
“See? No wonder we lost!” Draco deduced, sighing dramatically. “I guess it was just another part of my tragic destiny to have to be the sole competent member of the worst Quidditch team in the history of Hogwarts.”
Potter fixed his green eyes on Draco for a second and then – as if he’d found what he was looking for – turned his attention back to the others. “We’re gonna have to think this through.”
Draco’s bed was located under a large window with a breathtaking view of the depths of the Great Lake.

starting to sound ridiculous to his own ears – when Luna had suggested:
“Morning Granger,” Draco said in an impassive tone, still not sure how he was supposed to handle this particular turn of events.
“Draco, what the
A mixture of cheers and “boos” rose from the audience, but Draco paid them no thoughts as he determinedly sped up to catch up with Potter. Draco’s head was level with Potter’s leather-clad ankle now and he was helplessly watching as Potter reached for the Snitch, long fingers twitching to wrap themselves around the golden ball, and …
“Okay,” He said, grabbing Draco’s hand. “Let’s go.” And he broke into a run the next moment, dragging Draco along.
“I …” Harry gulped, eyes darkening. “Are you sure?”
Draco’s eyes flutter shut at the sensation of Potter being this close and his next breath escapes him in a shuddered exhale. Potter’s lips on his are chapped and rough and Draco couldn’t have
Draco’s trunk sat ready beside his bed for tomorrow morning, when he would leave for the Christmas holidays. And tucked safely inside the hidden pocket of his trunk, next to the black velvet box holding the delicate silver ring – the glazed solitaire now empty of any life-changing purple liquid – sat a small golden ball, a reminder that the past few months hadn’t been just a vivid production of Draco’s desperate mind.
how it wasn’t enough.
“What in the name of
familiar in this otherwise otherworldly conversation they were having. They were, after all, a Death Eater and the Chosen One, and Draco couldn’t escape the nagging feeling that this wasn’t just going to end as a simple conversation about botanical imagery.
“Well, for starters, it’s quite beautiful.”
He looked up to search for the source of the sound and saw a group of people atop the staircase leading to the boys’ dormitories. Among them, a shock of pale blond hair.
“I know she cares deeply for you,” he said, truthfully. Daphne looked close to tears, and Draco hoped against hope that she didn’t start crying. He could handle a conversation, but he didn’t know what he would do if she began to cry. Emotions still didn’t come easy to him, after all.
“I taught there for my first three years out of Hogwarts,” Ashworth provided. “The class sizes are small, which allows you to focus on individual students, which I think would be great for you, especially as you’re starting off.”
Harry’s eyes were slowly drifting closed in his armchair when the familiar sounds of bricks clattering jolted him awake. He blinked repeatedly, trying to fully wake up and looking at who was walking into the common room.
“Yes, but…it shouldn’t be too long. Ten or fifteen minutes, like you said, at the most. And they shouldn’t be overwhelming, you should still be able to recognize that they’re not your own. They’re not like,” Hermione’s face went serious, and Harry could tell she was also thinking about the link he had had with Voldemort. “They can’t make you do anything you don’t want to do. It’s more like you get a little preview into another person’s thoughts.”
there?” Draco felt his heart rate pick up. The very thought of a young Potter being locked up somewhere tight and cold and dark had Draco’s blood boiling.
Before Potter had kissed him.
When they both returned to the table, Potter gave him a funny look.
“What’s funny?” Harry asked.
sorry about the long wait, this chapter was so hard to get through. at first I felt like parts were out of character so I rewrote it about a hundred times until I was satisfied with it lol.
She sat with her legs crossed, a book open in her lap. Her thick black hair was piled up messily atop her head, and she twirled a quill between her fingers, a faraway look in her eyes.
“Wait, the Appleby Arrows?” Seamus suddenly interrupted.
“Let’s be honest, nobody knew who I was,” she said, sounding not at all upset by this. “I just took off my Slytherin colours and blended in. And,” she added, looking at Daphne rather fondly. “I’m alright. Took some hits, had a few broken bones, and I have a few scars, but they were all superficial wounds and I was patched up, no problem.”
“I cannot believe we are doing this,” Potter mumbled under his breath as the two walked towards the dilapidated house. Draco tried to keep a smile from forming on his face. A disgruntled Potter was just such fun, so easy to further rile up.
“How would you respond to rumours that you had something to do with his death?”
Draco lifted one shoulder up and down in a half-shrug.
“It’s alright,” said Harry. “Like you said, I just have to work harder, since my form isn’t a mammal.”
“I have to say, I am very impressed with you all today!” He spoke with a broad grin on his face and his arms out as if he were inviting them all to embrace him. “You all brewed a highly advanced potion to a relative degree of success.”
“That’s great to hear,” Draco said, reaching out to squeeze his mother’s hand. “I’m glad you decided to contact her.”
Potter gave a little smirk at the last line, trying to bring a little humour into the conversation, but Draco had something else Potter said echoing in his head.
He had sheepishly backed off after that.
“She’s asking why we’re here.”
Draco nodded. He still didn’t fully understand how Violet’s telephone worked, but she likened it to two-way mirrors and Floo-calling, and he knew enough by now to know it was the preferred method of communication for Muggles and Squibs.
“You don’t have to say you’re sorry,” Ginny interrupted his stammering. “I understand. We can’t really expect things to go back to the way they were before the war. Nothing is the same anymore.”
“I suppose I should go apologize for being a bint to Heidi. I definitely don’t want her taking it out on me in the next Quidditch match.”
Harry looked at him curiously. There was no reason for Malfoy to be telling him this, but it felt like the conversation they’d had over the flowers in the common room the other day had sparked some unusual sort of truce between them. For a moment, Harry wondered if this was an experiment, if Malfoy was testing him with something small to see whether or not he could be trusted.
“I suppose not,” he said. “I’ve always noticed you. Old habits, and all that.”
“I’m not sure, Professor,” he said, honestly.
Draco’s head snapped up.
“I think it makes a lot of sense,” he said. “I used to…well, I used to think a lot of think a lot of things, many of which were wrong, so don’t get your wand in a knot, but I used to always think it didn’t make any sense that we were put in the same classes as children who hadn’t even known magic existed before Hogwarts. I’m not saying it’s their fault,” he quickly added, when it looked like Potter was about to interrupt. “They just have a disadvantage. Honestly, I’m surprised no one’s thought of this before.”
“Good memory,” Waya said from the corner, where he’d been sitting silently until now. Harry grinned at him.
a certain amount of work, and felt strange not having it. Practically everyone he talked to agreed that it was a good idea for him to cut down on his hours, but he wasn’t sure what he was meant to do with himself with all of the extra time.
“Yes,” he confirmed. “Unless you count Elpis.”
His legs seemed to move of their own accord, and before he knew it, he was standing right in front of Potter and Granger’s desk. The two of them, alerted by his presence, looked up at him.
There had been no bad blood between him and Simone, but every time he saw a picture of her, or caught her name in the papers, he felt a pang in his heart.
Ginny made an irritated clicking sound with her tongue. “Well, alright, but what about…what about if Harry
“I’m not going to hurt you,” the man said, softly. “Aquila has only ever brought back mice and rats, and they’re usually already dead when she…
Harry found the spot Draco meant.
Harry was frozen. He hadn’t expected this. He didn’t know how he possibly
Potter never brought up that night, the night he’d showed up at Draco’s door, shaking and covered in blood. Draco clearly sensed that Potter didn’t want to talk about it, and so he refrained from mentioning it, but he thought about it constantly.
“But it isn’t!” Potter insisted. He then said, conspiratorially, “I almost was a Slytherin, you know.”
Kreacher was eager to assist and returned promptly with Harry’s potatoes. They worked quietly and peacefully, Kreacher fetching and chopping items while Harry began to boil water and thaw some meat. Soon the room was filling up with a pleasant aroma and Harry felt tension he didn’t even know was there release from his shoulders.
was he still experiencing this?
“Good memory,” she said, and turned away to find them a table. Meanwhile, Draco went up to the bar to order their drinks. He let out a breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding. Perhaps he was nervous for no reason, he told himself. Maybe Pansy just wanted to catch up, now that she was back in town. Maybe she was reaching out, looking for friends, because she wanted to try and move back to Britain for good.
the way I do—it’s not—”
“You…you did it,” said Draco, breathlessly. “I can’t believe I just…I just told you and you…you fixed it. Right away.”
“I know! Honestly, I wish more people were as curious as you. The wizarding world is so ignorant on all things Muggle, they think they’re all quaint and stupid, but the fact that they’ve done so much
Harry considered this.
? I—Violet!”
Draco blinked, wondering if Daphne was being sarcastic. After a moment of silence, Daphne regarded him with a confused expression.
“Look, Malfoy, as much as you might like to think so, I’m not an idiot.” Potter holds Draco’s gaze. “I saw Goyle shooing everyone away from the classroom door before you walked in that day.” A huff of laughter escapes Potter, he shakes his head with amusement. “And Parkinson might have thought that she was fooling everybody, but she was practically chocking on her excitement.”
Potter cocks a thick eyebrow at him. “Didn’t you?”
Fun fact: Did you know that reading your comments is one of the best parts of my week?
“No Sir,” Potter said, voice shaking with laughter. “Nothing.”
Books in hand and bag thrown over one shoulder, Draco was making his way through the narrow corridors of the dungeons towards the Slytherin common room when he heard heavy footsteps descending the stone steps behind him, and he slowed down, hand sliding into the pocket of his robes and wrapping around his wand in reflex.
Potter didn’t even know about. “I had it under control.”
“Yeah, maybe I should,” he said, heat creeping into his cheeks, but he was unable to look away from that set of magnificent emeralds.
“Yes, Harry.
“Draco, darling…” Pansy starts, but Draco ignores her, turns away and walks out of the hall. He knows he’s acting like a total prick. He knows that Pansy had only ever been trying to help and it’s not her fault that Draco just can’t seem to be able to get over this whole kissing-potter thing like he’d promised he would; but he can’t bring himself to care. At least not for now.

“Yeah, bye Potter. It was nice talking to you too!” Pansy yelled after him. Potter waved his hand at her general direction without turning back.
Draco’s unfocused gaze landed on a pair of shining emeralds only a breath away from his own face, and suddenly stupid, smug confidence was spilling out of every pore in Draco’s skin.
!” Harry, Weasley and Granger chimed simultaneously, smiling at the camera in their matching red academic dresses.
“It still doesn’t make sense, though,” said Justin. “Malfoy’s not in a position to beat up another student and get away with it, and he knows it. Especially Ernie who’s been waiting for an opportunity to get Malfoy expelled ever since he saw him on the train.”
the world was saved.
, Draco was a total
“Why not?” Potter sounded confused, like he didn’t know what Draco was talking about.
“Oh,” Pansy said, putting her hand on his shoulder. “Then maybe you should owl and check on them.”
Draco was poking his roast chicken with a fork, only partly listening to the conversation happening around him.
When the two captains approached each other and shook hands, Madam Hooch stepped back and readied her whistle. “Mount your brooms!” she ordered. “Three … two … one …”
That night, as Draco lay on his bed staring at the ceiling in silence, for the first time since the war, he thought about the things he could do differently from now – and not the things he could have done differently in the past. And Draco made himself a few promises.
. He tells himself as he walks down a corridor to get to the other side of the castle where the eight years’ DADA class is located.
. We have killed each other’s families and friends, and changed each other’s lives forever. We’ve gave each other wounds that would never properly heal. If it was peace that you were after, you shouldn’t have let me back here in the first place.” He stood up then, turning away and walking towards the door.
Narcissa Malfoy looked as stylish and graceful as always as she smiled at Draco with a small bouquet of Juliet roses in her manicured hands; Draco’s favorite flowers.
“Does he?” Harry said with a way too amused expression. “Yes, I’m thinking about joining the Ministry’s Auror Program come fall.”
“How do you feel about Ron’s idea?” Potter asked softly. “I know that we promised to lay low with this when we first started dating. And we’re obviously not going to do it if you don’t want to,” he hastily added. “But I don’t think it’s such a bad idea. It might actually get Rita and the cheap tabloid journalists off our back,” Potter shrugged, green eyes searching Draco’s face expectantly.
“How do you know how I feel?” asked Potter.
The owl just ruffled its feathers and stared at him.
She withdrew her wand and twirled it between her fingers. Harry observed it, wondering how he hadn’t noticed Hermione had had a new wand this entire time. It was rather handsome, as wands went, a light brown colour with white, Celtic designs above the handle.
” said Harry again, feeling his stomach start to twist in nervousness at the prospect of facing Draco again.
Draco had already been familiar with her humour and how accustomed she was to being the only Squib in the room, as he had met her before. She was very similar to her sister in her mannerisms and attitude, which of course endeared her to Draco, since Violet was such a good friend of his.
“Alright. Alright, I’ll carry the blasted snake.”
He was feeling more like himself again, and his friends were treating him more like as well, and he felt overwhelmingly glad. He also, however, felt confused.
“Can we just be mad at me about this later and help me now?”
“She won’t hurt you.”
Surprisingly enough, Harry felt sufficiently refreshed when he returned to Hogwarts in the new year. He hadn’t expected much when he had left with Ron for the Burrow, remembering the summer and how much time he had spent just sleeping. But it had turned out to be more enjoyable than he thought. Andromeda had brought Teddy around for Christmas dinner and the baby had delighted everyone by Metamorphasing his hair to match whoever was holding him.
“Always thought you’d be a Puddlemere fan.”
“Don’t follow me,” he said, warningly, and hurried away. Every nerve in his body felt like it had been lit on fire. The soreness he had been feeling in his muscles a mere half-hour ago had been replaced by a buzzing sensation. He suddenly felt
“I felt so alone, when we were out there last year. Even though Ron and Hermione were with me, or Hermione, when Ron had—I still felt alone. Like no one could possibly grasp what it was like for me. I was the one who had Voldemort in my head all the time, who had the whole bloody wizarding world counting on me to save them. I

gotten an O in his Defence O.W.L and even made it into N.E.W.T level Potions. McGonagall had had confidence in him, and she was not a woman easily impressed.
“Here,” he said, dropping the load onto the desk. Malfoy flinched slightly as his sudden arrival, but then just nodded hurriedly.
had, at some point, held ownership of the Elder Wand, when he had never even laid a hand on the blasted thing.
Draco’s eyes flew open.
But they also hadn’t talked about anything other than the spellwork, and Harry wasn’t sure if doing so was the best idea. After all, it wasn’t like they had ever held a civil conversation before.
“Sorry, but what is the Oath of the Sacred Twenty-Eight?”
Coming back to Hogwarts had been difficult, and Harry had taken a long time to readjust. He had been twitchy and anxious, flinching at every sound like an easily startled cat. He hadn’t been alone in that, it seemed many students—mainly the older ones—still remained in the state of mind of war, and being back in the castle where the battle had occurred did little to help that. The professors all did their best to help make everyone feel safe and welcome, and the castle itself bore few signs that any war had taken place, but Harry still
Draco made a mental note to heavily research more wandmakers around the world.
. More than that, his theory on wand cores had been right, and here was the proof—twelve inches of walnut wood and dragonfly wing.
Potter looked ready to argue, but Draco did not want to hear the two of them bicker over what Potter’s role in society should be.
“Fetch the ingredients, would you, Potter?” Draco said, in a somewhat resigned voice. Whether this turned out to be an utter catastrophe, he supposed he would just have to wait and see. “And do
He trailed off and Harry started to feel alarmed.
“Oh, fine. I expect a thorough explanation though.”
“Is that paint?” Potter asked. Draco looked closer and sure enough, it did appear to be an oil-based paint, dripping from the bottom of the portrait, a combination of the colours that made up Claudia’s portrait.
“Probably because I constantly feel like I should be doing more for people.”
Harry willed him to understand. He hopped on the letter, ink staining his feet.
but then approached the wheelbarrow and withdrew a cold, slimy piece of meat. Armstrong remained right at Draco’s elbow, waiting for him to place the food on the ground.
Draco’s head snapped up. “What? She’s not?”

“What does the potion do?”
Granger gives him a quick nod – that unsettling little smile still tugging at the corners of her lips – and gives her wand a flick, a timer appearing in the air in front of her face. “Whenever you’re ready, Harry.”
“What?” he whispered, his eyes darting up in surprise and his mind failing to process what he’d just heard.
This was the real Chamber of Secrets, Draco knew it, but instead of the long black shadows and the greenish gloom that Draco had always associated with this place in his childhood dreams, the entire place was lit in purple, orange and black Halloween lights. Fat carved pumpkins floated in the air above people’s heads, charmed fake skeletons walked aimlessly among the crowd, fake spider webs and blood decorated the walls, different dishes of snacks, several bowls of Halloween candy, fruits, and bottles of Firewhiskey and Butterbear covered the long tables in each side of the spacious room. And students in colorful Halloween costumes were laughing and chatting and dancing to the loud music all over the marble floor.
