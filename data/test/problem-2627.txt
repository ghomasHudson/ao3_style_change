Draco was sitting with his back against the trunk and had Harry nestled against his chest.
“Whatever you’d like, Harry.”  Draco said, smiling.
“Mmm... yes. He’s been spending a fair amount of time with you in the sun and he’s always up early doing some kind of workout. I’m surprised you haven’t noticed yet.” Draco said.
“For you, pup, there isn’t a whole lot I wouldn’t do.” Remus said, giving him a small smile. “What do you say we get back to Severus and Mr. Malfoy, before they come looking for us?”
“Can I kiss you?” Draco asked.
“Owls should be arriving any day with O.W.L results and school shopping lists. I’d be more than willing to arrange for someone to escort you when you head to Diagon Ally.” Dumbledore said.
Twenty minutes later and Harry had dressed, eaten breakfast, drank the foul nutrient potion, and was standing on the western lawn facing Severus, waiting for the man to speak.
“Congrats, Harry. I wish I could have been here to see it when you finally blew it up.” Draco said.
” Dumbledore said firmly, wand pointed at the manor. A bright white light erupted from the house. It seemed like someone had turned on spotlights from every window of the house, except it was mid-day and it was impossibly bright.
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked.
Remus and Severus shared a glance, but after Remus nodded, so did Severus.
It was funny, with him being in Slytherin, you would think he would have hated Gryffindor’s on principle. But something about Hermione’s know-it-all attitude, and Ron’s inability to stop eating attracted him, and by his second year at school, he had a solid friendship with them. Now… Now Ron and Sirius were dead, and Hermione was most likely never going to recover.  He couldn’t help the tears that started flowing down his face at the thought of them, the tears that threatened to overcome his body and cause painful sobs that he wouldn’t be able to stop. But there was a time and place for that, and if he didn’t get help soon, it wouldn’t matter that they died to save him, because he would be joining them.
Harry listened as Mrs. Malfoy gave Nipsy directions and handed the elf an almost overflowing bag of gold. The elf took the bag and vanished it almost instantly. Nipsy then bowed deeply and disapparated.
Harry truly looked around at his surroundings for the first time, and noticed that he had been dropped off on a rather tight street, right in front of some rather impressive looking gates. He looked to the left and to the right, but all he could see was a mossy covered wall, maybe 5-6 feet tall, with huge, dense Alder trees thickly placed behind the wall, making it impossible to see what was behind them. He turned around and noted that there was nothing behind him, save for the solitary road he came in on, and huge open fields, which were occasionally dotted with more trees.
“Bleeding hell, who are you?” Harry asked, heart beating quickly.
Severus sat down next to him, sweating like Harry was, but much more composed.
“Be calm, Harry. I would never harm myself, especially not when Draco is still alive in this world.” She said. “
“I’m just going to take a quick shower. Mind if I drop by when I’m done?” Harry said.
Severus was quiet for a moment. He noticed the change in his voice, but couldn’t tell if Potter was angry or not. He decided he needed to change tactics.
“Remus, I…”
Remus reached out and gave his shoulder a firm squeeze.
“Yes, Professor. I’ll do my best.” Harry replied.
When not a moment later Vernon was screaming with pain, Harry started moving. By the time he was off his bed, he had his pants pulled up, ready for Vernon to try something else. It seemed, however, that all his attacker could do was flop around in pain. Giving a vindictive smile, Harry reached under his bed and ripped the floorboard loose, grabbing the envelope containing his mother’s letter, and documents pertaining to him. He quickly pulled out from underneath the bed, grabbed his trunk and bird cage, and strode towards his door, which blasted open of its own accord with little thought from Harry. In the hallway, he was greeted by his deathly white aunt, and for a second, he reconsidered what he was about to do.
“No need to apologize, Draco. Really. I’m so fucking happy it’s not even funny. I’m glad that you were straightforward with me because I probably never would have said anything. Now I don’t have to second guess anything.” Harry replied.
“I didn’t know how you preferred your tea.” She said.
“I do, but only if you feel up to answering them.” Remus replied.
Harry grinned again as he said, “Thanks, everyone.”
Harry thought about this for a moment. He doubted he would ever know the reason for his parent’s not wanting to use the manor, but he truly didn’t see the harm in adding another layer of protection around himself.
“Master Harry... That is the Manor of your ancestors, Potter Manor, sir.” Said a house-elf, who proceeded to sink into a low bow when Harry had turned his wand toward the elf.
Chapter 5 is here!!! So much quicker than the last one :O Truthfully, this chapter was very easy to write, and I hope to keep cranking them out. Fortunately/ unfortunately, I start work Friday in a new position, so I'm probably going to be very busy these next few weeks. I'll try to keep posting, though!
Weasley killed-“ Severus said angrily, before being cut off.
Severus turned his attention to Harry, black eyes meeting his emerald green.
Severus said viciously.
Harry opened the door and headed inside. He could hear voices drifting down the hallway and went towards them. He ended up outside the door to the drawing room and stopped just outside it, trying to figure out if he was going to be interrupting something important. He realized it was Severus and Dumbledore and almost walked in when he caught what Severus was saying.
Dumbledore stood still, looking at Harry over his glasses.
Harry’s eyebrows had raised higher and higher as she explained her gift. A horse? Especially what he assumed were thoroughbred horses? This was easily one of the most expensive gifts he’d ever received and it wasn’t until Draco lightly bumped his arm that Harry realized he hadn’t said anything.
“Get to the point Potter. Stop wasting my time.” Snape snapped out.
“What happened?” Draco asked.
It started the same as usual, with Severus coming to Harry’s door and knocking. However, before Harry could respond, the door opened and Severus walked in. He moved the chairs by the window, sitting down when he arrived.
“Merlin, Draco. I love this so much! Remind me to really express my thanks to your mum.” Harry said.
By the time he was done, Harry was looking him in the eye.
“It’s alright. I just got finished myself.” Draco replied.
“It’s a very, very rare wand holder, Harry, perhaps even one of a kind. I’ve seen variations of these, but never one with quite this combination of traits. You, and only you, are able to take it off. It will prevent accidental drops, disarming, and Merlin help us, losing your wand. You can stow your wand and it’ll feel as if it’s not even there. The Dark Lord himself could search you and wouldn’t find it.” Severus said.
Harry jumped when Snape spoke from behind him.
“Yes, my son, it went very well. I have reconnected with my sister, Andromeda. In fact, if you’re willing, I’d like for you to meet her today.” Narcissa said.
“A Death Eater came into the room and told the Dark Lord that they had captured Vernon Dursley.” Snape said.
” Severus cast and was immediately looking at the memory of the battle that morning.
Harry had a stream of tears running down his face, and sniffled.
“I hadn’t really ventured past the lake yet. Does all this belong to you?” Draco asked.
Was Lucius one of the ones in that room? Severus couldn’t be sure, but he was rather hoping not. Lucius had proven himself a great ally and even greater lover since the Dark Lord had returned last year, and he needed his help if he was going to get out of the manor alive. He went straight to the private study where Lucius could often be found, using another spell when he arrived that turned the door into something akin to smoke. As he swept through the barrier, it returned to its solid form.
“Oh, and one more thing Mrs. Malfoy, before I forget and you are unable to find the house again - Potter Manor is located at 212 Sampford Arundel, Somerset, UK.” Harry called after her.
“Well, that was… something.” Harry said to himself as he got up to look for some food.
Draco positioned himself on his knees, looking Harry in the face. This caused Harry to frown. What was he doing?
“Hmm. Okay. I will have to think of something small, then.” Harry said.
Meemy broke out into a wide grin and said, “Of course, Master Harry. Perhaps Meemy should start with the Potter Manor?”
“Sure, why not.” Draco said, deciding after a second’s longer deliberation.
Hello again :) Writing at work seems to be going okay, though I swear I'm going to end up forgetting something and it's totally gonna mess the story up, but we'll cross that bridge if we ever get to it. You guys have seriously inspired me with your comments and I can't say thank you enough. Much love from me <3
No, Harry was definitely not looking forward to going “home” to the Dursley’s. The last thing he wanted was to have an abundance of time on his hands to think about everything that he had done wrong, and everything he wished he could go back and change. And so, when Harry made his way off the train, it was with great reluctance. Harry slowly picked his way through the crowd, trunk and bird cage in tow, looking for the people he least wanted to see. Unfortunately, his eyes landed all too soon on his Uncle Vernon, who had for some reason, chosen to come and get him by himself. As Harry made his way over to him, his uncle’s great, beady eyes locked on Harry in a way that made his skin prickle with discomfort.
.” Severus whispered.
“As nice as that sounds and as tempting as it is, I’m pretty sure someone
Harry fished his wand out and cast a quick “
Harry sat in the kitchen until the sun had fully risen. He was still processing everything that Narcissa had said, still trying to find a reason for her telling him so much of their personal lives. Was she really just thankful for the small amount of protection and comfort Harry had been able to offer or was there something more to it? He was pulled from his thoughts when the kitchen door opened and Draco came in.
Draco slowly started bobbing up and down, slurping every now and again when his lips broke the suction. The sound only seemed to heighten Harry’s pleasure, though, and he found it hard to keep his body lying flat. He needed to do something, so he moved his hands to the back of Draco’s head and carded them through his hair.
Harry broke into a grin and leaned down.
On a side note, I am trying a few different ways of marking internal dialog. I think I'm going to end up using italicized font from now on, but I might try something else. Let me know what you think please!
“I love you, too.” Harry replied.
“It was in the Prophet this morning. A picture of your old house, completely obliterated. They found his remains inside, protected by a shield. He showed signs of being badly tortured before he was bitten, multiple times, by a snake. Presumably the Dark Lord’s pet... He had a message carved into him, but I’d prefer not to tell you, as it’s unnecessary. Dumbledore implored me not to tell you the details of his stay with the Dark Lord, for fear of upsetting you, but I felt like you deserved and can handle the truth.” Severus said.
They were headed to Harry’s bedroom, but stopped by Narcissa’s room to relay that they would be down for dinner and needed to speak to her after, if it was convenient for her.
As soon as she had gone, Harry let his face fall into a frown. Why would his parents put such a strong locking charm on the door? Surely there was nothing of great value in there, when all throughout the house there were priceless works of art. If that wasn’t locked up, he couldn’t think of anything that would require such a powerful spell; he decided not to dwell on it, and instead went back to exploring the manor.
“Oh Master Harry, of course! Tell Meemy what to do!” Meemy squeaked out.
He knew it worked before he had even finished thinking it and couldn’t help but smile.
“For now. If he isn’t awake in two hours, you are to come find me, as I will need to re-administer the blood-replenishing potion. If he wakes before then, you are to come find me all the same. We have much to
He had never really interacted with the boy at school, even though they shared a common room and dorm. Harry had spent most of his Hogwarts life with Ron and Hermione, returning to his own dorms only to sleep. It had worked for him then, even though it had made him an outsider in Slytherin.
They stayed like that for a few minutes, Harry gaining more and more courage the longer it went on, and Draco was so relaxed when Harry told him he was going to start inserting fingers, he wasn’t the least bit worried. He waited to feel the intrusion and it came, gently and slowly, and he was thankful that Harry was willing to take his time.
between us, you need to tell me the truth.” Snape said evenly, looking Harry square in the eyes. He could see his pupils dilate a second before he answered.
With a masterful swish of his cloak, he set off for the Dursley’s.
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of responding, Draco just pressed the letter into his chest with shaking hands.
Whoa, a chapter within a week of the other one? Whaaaaat? :) Hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed writing it.
They both dove behind the thick wooden table that Draco and Narcissa were using for shelter, screaming the killing curse the whole way. Severus peeked over the top of the table and watched as the sickly green lights hit two of their opponents square in the chest. They both slumped down the ground, no longer able to fight.
Harry was still looking at him incredulously, but gave him a small nod.
“I know, pup. I know.” He said, placing his chin on top of Harry’s head as the boy leaned into the hug and cried against his chest, a few tears of his own sliding down his cheeks.
“Excellent, my boy. Now, if you wouldn’t mind excusing me and Professor Snape? I’d like to have a quick word with him.” Dumbledore asked.
“I’m sorry, Draco. Really, I am.” Harry said, not knowing what else he could say.
“You know, I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times from your mother by now, but if you want to talk, or rage, or swear, or anything, you can come to me. I’ve been there before. I’m actually still kind of there, honestly.” Harry said, looking over to Draco and meeting the gaze that was now directed at him.
After dinner was over, Harry decided to go for a walk around the lake to clear his mind. It had been a physically and mentally taxing day for him, and he was having trouble clearing his mind and focusing on his shield, so he needed to take some time and get it stable again. Draco had asked if he wanted company, but Harry had just smiled and told him no before departing with a kiss.
“O.W.L. results and school lists, no doubt. Just like Dumbledore said.” Draco announced when he realized Harry had arrived.
“Potter Manor is set on nearly 80 acres of land. It has two stories, ten bedrooms, eight bathrooms, five reception rooms, a garden, lake, and many out buildings. There is a stable courtyard, where you will find a coach house, stables, and garage. There is a former vineyard that fell out of use many years ago, but Meemy would love to help Master Harry make it work again. There are two other buildings on the grounds, sir, a cottage and a lodge. Master should be able to see a bit of the cottage just past the lake. There are two bedrooms there, and it is where Master James and Misses Lily spent their honeymoon.” Meemy seamlessly listed off, pausing only to take a breath.
“You have ten minutes to meet me downstairs. If you aren’t there, I’ll assume you want to wait.” Severus finished.
at Voldemort, sneering as the noseless bastard screamed in pain.
In his dream, he was reaching out, about to grab the Golden Snitch, when a Bludger hit him in the head from behind. Harry slipped from his broom and started falling. He had a few seconds of pure panic, but just as he was about to hit the ground, his dream changed. Suddenly, Harry was staring at the bowing form of a black-robed Death Eater. He noticed there were a few more positioned around the room, some guarding the door, others standing like statues along the walls.
Harry rolled his eyes, but answered, “Yes.”
Harry entered and crossed the room, choosing to sit on the foot of the bed rather than the chair that he had occupied a few days prior. Draco followed him and took a spot near the pillows.
Harry watched as Snape pulled a folded piece of paper out from his robes and took it as it was handed to him.
“What happened?” Lucius asked suspiciously.
He didn’t know what to say, so he sipped his drink in silence.
“Are you getting in?” Harry asked, a very self-satisfied smirk on his mouth.
“You caused my wand to twitch in my hand, nothing more, and nothing less. An impressive start, truly, for someone who has never attempted that before.” Severus commented. “From now on, that’s how I want you to cast every spell you use. Even the simple ones. Understood?”
“We are unable to see the manor, Mr. Potter.” Snape said.
It was with one of the greatest efforts of his life that he pulled himself together, and continued towards his home.
He reached in the stall and turned the taps on full blast, letting the sound of the splashing water drown out his thoughts for a moment. After briefly watching the water swirl down the drain, Severus reached into a pocket of his robes and pulled out the shrunken trunk that he had hastily put together earlier. He took it into the other room and set it near the end of the bed, using a lazy flick of his wand to bring it back to full size. He opened the lid and brought his out his shower bag. Severus never left Spinner’s End for prolonged periods of time without having basic cleaning supplies on hand. He found he preferred his own crafted soaps to those he was usually afforded outside his home. Bag in hand, he walked back to the bathroom, which was slowly billowing out wonderful clouds of steam.
“No. If it’s safe to wear, then I see no reason to wait.” Harry replied.
Severus was leaning back in his chair. He had intended to provoke Potter into a reaction, one where he could press him for information, but he did not expect him to break down. Still, there were things he needed to get from the boy if he was going to be able to help him, and anger was apparently not the way to go. So, after making sure to rein his anger back in, he continued.
“Mr. Potter, I think it would be best if you were to simply try it. There are a hundred different ways for me to explain this, but I think that a more direct approach will work better.” Severus said.
“Mr. Potter. I arrived early this morning, hoping to catch you while you were still sleeping. I wanted to see the results of your time alone, and I was not disappointed.” Snape said, turning to look at Harry with an unreadable expression in his eyes.
“I’m guessing that no one has really filled you in on what’s happened?” Harry said, glancing at Severus, who was now looking at his nails with such studious over acting that Harry had to repress a snort.
“Draco, I’m… I’m…” Harry gasped.
! I think about it all the time, and it doesn’t help!” Harry finished, tears streaming down his face.
He slowly started to undress, pulling off his robes and letting them fall to the floor. A casual glance at the mirror caused him to freeze; his undershirt was caked in dry blood, and caused Severus momentary panic before he realized that he had only spelled Harry’s blood off his outer layers before apparating to the Dursley’s earlier. He drew in a shaky breath and continued undressing, stepping in the shower when he had finished. He systemically started scrubbing his body, starting at the top of his head and going all the way down to his feet, watching the bloody water drain by his feet. As he started shampooing his hair, he let his mind wander…
He said internally.
“This feels... so different. Like I’ve found something I lost a long time ago.” Harry said, looking back to Dumbledore.
“Do not look so surprised, Harry. Blonde hair is a trait of only blood Malfoy’s. My hair was kept blonde through a rather simple spell. I think, however, that it’s time to go back to my original color.” She said with a slight smile.
“I love you, too.” Draco replied, taking Harry’s hand and walking them in the direction of the house.
“We’ll be in shortly, Meemy. Thank you.” Harry said.
“Touché, Potter.” Severus said.
Narcissa took one more look at Severus and Lucius before joining Draco. Together, they entered the fireplace and Flooed to Spinner’s End, Narcissa clutching tightly to Draco’s hand.
“I was disgusted, Po-
Harry was a little hesitant when he nodded to his professor. He really didn’t want to duel with him, but he could see the logic behind the training. He let out a deep sigh before he raised his wand.
“Draco… I’m sorry that I left on such short notice, but I wasn’t sure how well I was going to be received where I was headed, and I didn’t want to risk your safety, so I figured it best to leave you here.” Narcissa said.
Meemy wasn’t kidding when she had listed things off. The first floor offered a study, drawing room, dining room, garden room, billiard room, kitchen with attached breakfast room, pantry, larder, utility room, and a bunch of smaller rooms, which Harry could only assume were used to greet people before moving them to another part of the house. The cellar was truly impressive, and it definitely held more wine than Harry would ever try to consume in his life time.
in. Severus willed himself not to lose his focus, not to snap inside this man’s head, and instead focus on what he was there to do.
He looked at Severus, trying to prepare for the next spell, but he was too slow. Severus had disarmed him with a flick of his wand, and with another flick, had hit him with a mild Stinging Hex. Harry winced as he shook the pain out of his arm, and stood to face his professor.
Well, partly for him, he reasoned with himself.
“You definitely know Severus, but after what we saw earlier… Do you think you two can work together? I don’t want to force anything, but it would make me feel a lot better. Both of you mean a lot to me.” Harry said.
“Yes. So much yes.” Harry replied breathlessly.
Draco bumped him with his shoulder to get his attention.
“Not the true extent of what you will be learning, but he knows that I plan on ‘taking you under my wing’ as it were.” Severus replied.
KILL YOU TRAITORS!” The female Death Eater screamed before firing off curse after curse.
When he was sure the spell had worked, he gently picked Harry up and carried him with experienced navigation throughout the manor, quickly but carefully, making his way to the third floor. When they reached the top of the stairs to the door that Harry had found weeks ago, Severus placed Harry’s bloody hand against the door, which unlocked with a loud *
“Cheers.” He said, downing the foul liquid.
“This is amazing, Draco. Are you not happy that you completely aced your O.W.L.’s?” Harry questioned.
Time slipped away from him as he Occluded, and he was surprised to see that it was almost pitch black when he opened his eyes. It didn’t matter though when this was something that he needed to do. He was satisfied with the results of his near meditation and stood up and stretched his aching muscles. It was definitely time for bed.
With a yelled, ‘
It depressed Harry, knowing that in another time, another universe, he could have grown up here. That he could have had an amazing childhood filled with love and adventure. But he quickly locked those depressing thoughts away, for he knew that there was no point in dwelling on what could have been.
Dursley for ever thinking about touching one of his students. Least of all
“Potter, I… would you maybe… never mind. Thank you for bringing me up here.” Draco said with a sigh.
He raced out of his study and down the hall to the room, wrenching the door open when he got there, intent on grabbing Lucius and leaving. But as he pulled the door open, he was blasted back by an explosion that destroyed the front of his house. Severus was hit with pieces of glass and debris, not having the time to react with any kind of charm that would shield the blast. He gasped out in pain as he forcefully slammed into the wall behind him, plaster and bits of wall showering him as he slid down to the floor.
“Of course. You don’t need my permission.” Harry said.
* indicating a house-elf was about to intrude on his space. He continued slowly ladling the potion he was working with into the vials he had spread out in front of him, waiting for the inevitable voice of the irritating creature to ask him for some ungodly favor. A few silent moments later, the elf spoke from somewhere near his right elbow, and if Severus wasn’t expecting it, and wasn’t trained so well to not show surprise, he would have jumped.
He had done his best to stop the bleeding, but he knew that he was in serious trouble. The headache, dizziness, and cold sweat that he was experiencing told him that, but he could do nothing besides keep moving.
He took a deep breath and opened the next present, this one from Severus. It was a long, thin box, and Harry looked at Severus questioningly when he saw what was inside.
“Oh? What did you guys talk about?” Draco asked.
Harry quickly looked at Draco, surprise wide in his eyes, and for a moment, Draco thought he might have rushed things, when Harry asked a gruff, “Really?”
“Right on time, Potter.” Severus said when Harry arrived at the bottom of the stairs. He held his hand out and Harry grimaced when he saw that he was clutching his nutrient potion. He took it from him and downed it without complaint, though, and was rewarded with a smile from the man.
Harry laughed and pulled Draco down for a kiss. He was surprised to find that Draco’s breath was minty fresh. He pulled away and commented on it.
“It is. Severus just gave me some news is all.” Harry said.
. That they put themselves in extreme danger, and paid such a heavy price, speaks so much to their character that it’s truly a shame that the world will never know their blessings. But I feel as if I can say that given the choice again, they would still stand next to you; not out of duty of friendship, or foolishness, but because it is the right thing to do.” Remus said.
He stayed like that for a moment, lost in the cascading water, but he wanted to talk to Draco, and that meant that he needed to get a move on if they were going to speak any time tonight. With a sigh, Harry started lathering soap up and down his body, letting an errant thought through that this would hopefully be something he and Draco would do one day. He felt himself hardening the longer he let the thought play out and had to really concentrate on what he was doing, or this shower was going to take much longer than he wanted.
“Guests? Thanks, Meemy.” Harry said, walking to the room adjacent to the kitchen.
Harry Potter was NOT looking forward to going back to the Dursley’s. He hated them, he hated their stupid house, and he hated the stupid summer. This year was definitely going to be the worst. You see, during the school year, Harry had been lured into a trap set by Voldemort, a trap that lead to the death of 2 of the people closest to him, and left another of his friends in a coma, one from which anyone doubted she would ever wake.
Harry heard him, but didn’t reply. He was reading the note his aunt had left his for his uncle.
He had done his best to stop the bleeding, but he knew that he was in serious trouble. The headache, dizziness, and cold sweat that he was experiencing told him that, but he could do nothing except keep moving.
“Regardless. You should have sought me out
“Thanks Stan, Ernie.” Harry said, nodding his head to driver as he left the bus.
“No need to ask if you’re ready to eat, then.” Draco said playfully.
***I also updated tags to more accurately reflect what kind of fic this is. I'm sure I'll add more***
Draco hesitated for a moment before he held out his left hand.
He watched as Draco started to move. Watched as he stretched his arms out in front of him and flexed his fingers. The blonde gave a giant yawn as he woke up and felt around the bed, before huffing out a small sigh.
“Professor Snape, sir?! You is needed urgently! My master is needing you!” Meemy rushed out, trying to grab Severus by the arm and drag him to the fireplace.
With a sigh, Harry turned around and swept the room with his eyes, making sure she had gotten everything.
He did as he was told; double checking his Occlumency shields were firmly in place, he made sure to vividly recreate the scene he was just talking about. Upon locking eyes with Voldemort, he immediately felt him probing his mind, looking for any inaccuracies.
mind, until I return. Is that acceptable?” Dumbledore questioned, moving towards the door.
The next two weeks continued at about the same pace for Harry. When he wasn’t having the reoccurring nightmare featuring the deaths and injuries to the people closest to him, he was locked in his room and practically forgotten about until mealtimes, when he would get random bits of food and water pressed into his room via cat flap. It was on such a day, when Harry was getting one of his “meals,” that a manila envelope followed the food.
Chapter 1
“We need to move. The Dark Lord will soon discover where we are, if he hasn’t already, and I don’t wish to stick around for
“Meemy?” Severus quietly called out.
Harry leaned closer, hovering right above Draco’s lips and stopped.
And Harry was true to his word. He went so slow that the worst Draco felt was a slight burning sensation when Harry had gotten about half way in, and had stopped when he heard the small gasp Draco let out. He had waited for Draco’s nod before continuing and the process went much smoother when Draco realized that if he pushed down on Harry, almost like he was trying to
“Come here.” Draco said, pulling Harry into a heated kiss.
“What can Meemy be doing for Professor Snape?” Meemy asked.
“Yes, my master. What is you needing?” Pipsy squeaked out from her low bow.
It was with that thought in mind that he heard the subtle *
“It could have been a horrible marriage, but it worked rather well for both us. In fact, the only bump in the road we really had was when Draco found out. He had woken late one night, just a year before he was due to start Hogwarts. Lucius hadn’t been quite as careful as he usually was when he had another man over, and Draco walked in on them – clothed, thankfully – but he saw enough to know that Lucius wasn’t being faithful. I won’t bore you with the details, but it wasn’t easy getting Draco to accept that that was how things were.
Harry let out a low chuckle before he replied. “Just surprised to find he isn’t pale and rail thin.”
Dumbledore disapparated abruptly, and Severus had to spin quickly to keep up. Apparently, the headmaster was furious.
Draco waited a moment before speaking.
tickled. Harry was rock hard, a fact that Draco had to be aware of since they had both been sleeping naked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco didn’t say anything. He looked sad, but Harry couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He let go of Draco, trying to turn away, but Draco pulled him back, grabbing him into a fierce hug, one arm around his waist and the other in his hair. He melted into it resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
When Harry arrived on the western lawn, he found Severus staring at the lake, with his hands clasped behind his back. His robes had been discarded and were floating next to him as if there were an invisible coat-hanger on the lawn. His sleeves were pushed up, and Harry could see the Dark Mark, burned black and deep, on his teacher's forearm. He looked away as Severus turned to him.
“See you then, Severus.” Harry said.
He figured if he could just make it back to his house, he would be able to send word to his remaining friends that he needed help. That was what he was hoping, anyways. He wasn’t even sure of who would come, since the latest incident he was involved in resulted in his Godfather and best friend dead, with one of his other best friends permanently injured. Merlin, he needed to stop that train of thought right there, he simply couldn’t think of Ron or Hermione, and especially not Sirius. Not now.
“Harry Potter, sir.” Meemy said.
“What do you think you’re doing? Unhand me immediately!” Snape growled out, snatching his arm out of the elf’s grip.
Harry didn’t say anything. He didn’t know what
“Potter, I-… I obviously didn’t intend to imply that your love for Black was anything less than what it is. I simply wish for you to see the error of your more… Gryffindor traits. All I wish is for you to put that brain of yours to its full potential. I
“I guess you could say that.” Remus responded. “I got an owl from Dumbledore late this morning asking if I would be willing to accompany you and a few others to Diagon Alley, and I was in the process of replying to him, when Severus shows up and tells me we’re leaving immediately. I barely had time to grab my wand before I was being whisked away. Severus apparated me here, to the edge of the wards, before he shoved a piece of parchment in front of my eyes and told me to memorize it. We argued for probably 30 minutes before he told me you
Harry looked him in the eyes. He could see the smoldering rage in them and knew without a doubt that he was serious.
“That’s not necessary, Headmaster. I shall accompany him.” Severus offered.
. I am disgusted by what Vernon tried to do to you and I am deeply sorry that I was unable to help you.” Dumbledore said.
“To Harry. May you have an amazing birthday with many more to follow.”
He turned from the door and slowly descended the stairs, thinking of how differently that had gone than he expected it to. Harry had surprised him, and in truth, he had surprised himself. He did not often apologize, especially to students, but this seemed like one of those great exceptions. It was obvious that Harry needed guidance, and Severus was sure that he would be able to help him, so long as they were able to put their differences aside.
Harry just nodded, not sure what to say.
“What do you- What did I do wrong?” Harry said, hoping his voice wasn’t trembling like the rest of him was.
“Anything?” Dumbledore asked.
He took a deep, calming breath, and with one last look around his study, Severus started concentrating on his destination. That was when he remembered, with heart-wrenching pain, that Lucius was lying on the couch in his sitting room. He couldn’t leave him behind. It would destroy Draco and Narcissa, and if he was honest, probably himself, too.
Harry and Draco swam for the shore when they noticed her and they were followed by Severus. When they made it back, they were greeted with towels by Narcissa, who wrapped them around the pair.
Draco opened his mouth to respond when a knock came from the door. Harry jumped, but all Draco did was to give a lazy “come in.”
They headed downstairs after the shower was finished and Harry was feeling amazing. They walked hand in hand towards the kitchen and were surprised to find when they arrived that the door wouldn’t open. Harry was about to ask Draco if he knew what was going on when Meemy popped into existence behind them.
Severus stood there, wearing what appeared to be a track suit, and was lightly jogging in place.
Dumbledore stepped closer to Harry. “That’s simple enough, my boy. They need refuge; peace and quiet while they mourn their loss. Your home would be the perfect place for that. I would offer them a place at Hogwarts, but I don’t wish to subject them to the Aurors that would surely demand they be released to them.” Dumbledore said.
This caused Draco to roll his eyes slightly, but he still raised his hand in greeting to his former Professor.
Severus was shocked. It seemed that Petunia had some common sense, after all. Perhaps it would do Harry some good to know that his aunt had left his uncle and appeared to show true remorse for what had happened. He folded the letter back up and tucked it into a pocket inside his robes. Dumbledore gave him a searching look but said nothing.
Draco squeezed his hand and Harry looked at him. He had a small, reassuring smile and Harry appreciated his support.
“Silence, you impotent fool.” Severus said, turning his wand on the giant man.
He had turned on his heel was headed out of the kitchen before Harry remembered he made a promise to tell Draco where Narcissa had gone.
“Thinking? About what?” Harry asked.
Severus had started back floating when Draco arrived, and Harry was surprised to see that not only was the man well-tanned, but he was toned and had very deep muscle definition.
Remus put his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him to his side, giving him a half-hug.
“How long were you next to me, then?”  Harry said, asking the first thing that came to mind, trying to wrap his head around the fact that he owned a manor.
Draco looked down at their joined hands before looking back at Harry. “Sure.” He said, before lightly pulling his hand away and walking back up the stairs.
“It’s great, Potter. Please don’t stop.” Draco said.
“Find him- for me- give him- the floo- address. Tell him- I’m dying. Lily said… Lily said…” Harry finally lost consciousness, mouth still trying to form the words.
“N-nothing. It’s just… I’ve just been trying to psyche myself up to do this for a couple of days, and… I don’t know, now.” He said.
They locked eyes, Draco a bit wide-eyed and Harry doing his best to look calm.
, it’s getting close to my birthday, and I hadn’t left the grounds since I arrived here, so I figured I would head into town and do a bit of light shopping. When I got in to town, I saw a greasy spoon, and decided to grab a late breakfast. I had only been there for fifteen-twenty minutes before three Death Eaters apparated outside the place, and- and I did what I had to, okay?” Harry finished, daring his Professor with his eyes to challenge him for fighting back.
“A simple mistake, I’m afraid. I got a little ahead of myself, Severus.” Dumbledore said.
He raised his wand and opened his mouth to cast a “
“I’ve no idea, Harry. It came in the mail a few days ago, but your uncle refused to let you have it. You will read it, and hide it. If he finds it, I will deny ever giving it to you.” Aunt Petunia said, sounding a little snippy.
Harry was looking at him, slightly open-mouthed in shock. Severus took a deep breath as he leaned back into his chair and scrubbed his face, closing his eyes as he tried to find the right words.
Severus sighed. Of course, Potter would be stubborn over absolutely nothing. With another small sigh, Severus went inside and made his way up the stairs, smoothing his facial features into one of cool impassiveness. When he reached the door, he gave a small knock before entering, not bothering to wait for a reply. He was met with a dark room, one where he could faintly see Potter’s face looking at him through the darkness.
, do you
It had been another long day of training for Harry, but he was determined to get this, even if it took all night, too. He had been trying everything he could think of in an attempt to get the more powerful spells to actually have the required strength behind them but were all still extremely weak. The rock he was trying to destroy had small fissures running through it, but it was still solid and showed no signs of breaking any time soon.
I mock, running my fingers over the keys, "no need to be dramatic. It's not like it's you who's going to meet my Father." But the thought that the house cares, trying to comfort me, makes me feel better.

That night after the club, lying alone in my bed, I knew this time you wouldn't. I knew I would never see you again.
The three of them stare at me as though it was I who killed Dumbledore, but I have eyes only for Potter. There's something in his face... and I remember that night by the lake when I broke down in front of him. He didn't tell them, he just said that he

The face turned warm, kind, different,

"Mr. Potter testified that my help played the most crucial part in the defeat of the Dark Lord, and even talked to all those politicians. They left me alone. There'll be a trial, of course, but at least they will allow me to wait for it as I please, and not in Azkaban."
People are turning their heads, pointing in his wake; bewildered noise is rising among the crowd. Hermione covers her mouth with her hand, and Ron rubs at his forehead. Ginny is standing motionless, hugging herself around the middle.
"There was this guy..." Henry stops, looking up at the ceiling.
Eyes wide in disbelief, he turns to me. I don't know why he is surprised. Well, it's true. Last night with him was my first time ever, and
His hands clasped behind his back, Severus looks straight ahead, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Everyone is cheering, beaming at him. Everyone but Bellatrix. Her head bowed, she is standing motionless with her hands at her sides.

"Why do you think that

There’s a shuffling of paper. “Parchment is ready, Master.”
Harry's hex misses her, and she presses the blade under Weasley's ear.
Harry - a trace of scarlet glints in his eyes. He raises his sword.
He helps me to my feet and leads me by the hand into the cave. There he picks up the locket and tucks it into the inner pocket of my backpack. When he finally comes up to me, I'm leaning against the wall. I feel foul and dirty and cold. So cold.
You would straddle me and kiss every inch of my skin and slide your palms up my chest. You'd ride me with excruciating slowness, rocking, rocking until I saw stars.
With my hand in Seamus’s and my glass in the other, I head across the room.
His breath stills. I realise
Last night, after Potter had left, I went to bed, too. And though I didn't feel great after our chat, I fell asleep immediately. Now, finding Potter already gone, I am relieved. I don't think I'm okay with facing him right now. This whole thing of me depending on his charity is cringe-worthy, to say the least.
I turn to look at him. He stands by the bed, fiddling with the hem of his faded pillowcase. His ears droop, giving him an even more sad and ancient look than he usually has.
"I knew
I put the strap of my satchel over my shoulder and take Hermione’s elbow. Ron takes my other arm, and the three of us head out of the classroom.
Icy scream, frozen in my throat.
Potter shoves the reporter aside and grabs my arm, pulling me along.
The elf brings me food three times a day. Our former elf. He gives me nasty looks but doesn't talk. I don't talk either. I'd never been as cruel to house-elves as my Father was, though as far as I recall, neither was I very nice. So I'd better keep my mouth shut. I began to add

He kisses my forehead.
Not so many options left, is there?
The first floor is just fine, it only needs refreshing and such.
When he doesn't reply, I look up. His face is resigned and relieved, and
“The whole thing won’t work. The Patronus is the final and most vital component that ties it all together

Parkinson's voice among the music snakes its way into my swimming thoughts.
"Bored, Potter?"
"No. The...." Struggling to say the word, you stopped and took a breath.
"Well done, Mr. Potter," he whispers as soon as we are seated, leaning very very close, and I am suddenly breathless in a whiff of his cologne.
"You are most welcome. However..." Dumbledore reaches into the bowl of sweets in front of him. "There is something I have to ask of you." He arranges bright candies in a circle with his left hand; his right one lies on the desk - black, dead and useless. Looking at it, I try not to cringe.
Mumbling something under his breath that sounds like “Generous Masters,” Kreacher takes a seat to my left. Potter waves his hand, and the chair grows up in height, lifting Kreacher up to our level.
Malfoy's lips are swollen, his glittery makeup smudged in places where she touched his face. There are red marks down his neck, and the shirt is gaping open, revealing his sharp collarbone and the trail of stars down his chest. I shouldn't be staring, but I can't fucking look away.
Though not quite.
You knew. He'd got a ring and the anxiety that Hermione would reject his proposal, however ridiculous it may have sounded.
"Yes." My voice suddenly scratchy, I carefully exhale, because
"Dumbledore," Malfoy agrees.
I watch him with a heavy heart. What are we going to do now? I think he hardly knows that himself. We are alone, without any plan or purpose, and the only two people Potter ever trusted are now lost to him.
McGonagall steps aside, revealing a patch of grass and

more than just kissing. I'm acting eager and aroused - more than I actually am. Because I'm mostly terrified, I am bewildered, and that familiar horrible feeling is spreading beneath my skin: this is not what I want, not at all what I've ever wanted. I'm supposed to fake it. I tear my lips away.
Insane shriek fills the air, the wail of terror and pain and anger. When it finally dies down, the voice says no more.
"What do you mean?" I hissed, moving closer to him at the desk. I had no idea I was so obvious.
You come up to hug him from behind, resting your chin at the top of his head. Sliding his hands up your arms, he looks up, and you lean down to catch him in the upside-down kiss. You feel how his lips smile against yours.
I bend down and pick up the broom he's just dropped. "What's wrong with it?"
"Okay, Malfoy... okay... okay, Malfoy," Potter repeats over and over, his face bewildered.
"Potter."
I have no idea where Harry is now, McGonagall saw that I'd lose track of where he was going. The three of them ran up the main staircase, they may be anywhere in the castle by now.
He obeys.
When I finally reach Granger, she is sitting motionless, staring into space. I step in front of her, but she looks right through me.
Every time I move in my sleep, I feel his presence. His arm around my chest is warm, stars are flickering beneath my eyelids, and I am happy.
"Dumbledore left it to me in his will."
"Harry, look, you are upset... but you don't know his reasons."
"Why?" My hand finds the wall, and I lean against it.
I take his hand again; he says nothing, following me all the way to the inner courtyard dimly lit with the Christmas decorations. The fountain in the centre is running merrily, and the falling snow doesn't quite reach the glowing surface of a giant Warming Charm, which encloses everything in the protective sphere. There's no one here, and the place is quiet, though music swims in from the doorway. I lead him to the small bench behind the Christmas tree.
Reaching deep down, I put myself into the spell… and when it finally feels as though I'm soaring high, brimming with joy, I
"I've never done it," I utter.
“I don’t know,” he says in an odd voice, “haven’t decided yet. And you?”
He shouts, turning to me. His face is livid.
Potter throws the jumper on the ground, his T-shirt follows. His boots are unlaced, so he just kicks them off, barefoot. There's this

"Snape, the sneaky lying bitch he is!" Aunt Bella chimes in. "I broke the Unbreakable Vow," she mimics his voice, "let's just wait to hear what song he will sing to the Dark Lord." She cackles, but suddenly her face turns grave. "Before we summon him, I have some business with the Mudblood."
"Why so dull, Potter?" He hissed, once I couldn't be arsed to react to his remark about my poor potions skills. "The only thing that's still fun is making fun of

We aren’t cold anymore.
"When?" I ask, having trouble with my thudding heart.
Fascination in his voice makes me want to hear it again.
I come to my senses kneeling on the floor. When I look around, I realise the Dark Lord didn't speak to
"Yes," Malfoy says quietly, and my heart skips.
Just a moment before it's too late, I pull out of the dive with all my might. And Malfoy doesn't.
Once Gin kissed me like that... But no. Not like that.
Bracing yourself, you entered to find him with his back to you, facing the fireplace.
Rolling her eyes, she takes my hand and leads me out of the room. "Let's get some air."
By this point, I know nothing. I just do everything she says.
"Thanks, Potter," I say, nowhere near as calm as I try to appear.
“Brewing,” he replies.
"It's not about the project, you dick," he says angrily. "I've been doing my best to help you. Or do you want to stay blind forever?"
"Ron, please." Granger stepped in front of him. "Please take it off!"
"Professor Snape has told me about it in detail."
“Why do you ask?” There’s another question under this one, but he doesn’t ask it. Yet.
“I see…” I yawn.
Ginny's voice.
"He won't," Potter said.
I close the distance between us. "Relax, okay?" I find his hand. "We don't need to…"
"It's her birthday, mate. I need something special, and… y'know—” Ron faltered, asking for your help this morning.
The noise instantly dies.
"Healer's orders or?..."

and laughter.
"You room is ready. Do you need a rest?"
I turn in his arms. "Why?"
I don't know how to put it so they'd understand, I hardly understand it myself.
I still. "What?"
"Maybe you're right," he says. "We are taking them to the Manor."
I don't have to ask, he said.
And now he suddenly
"You are brilliant." I squeeze her in my arms, my head swimming.
The chatter around stops.
Next to me, Potter clears his throat, and I avoid his eyes, staring into the fire. I don't really mind them cuddling, not tonight. Tonight is good. Tonight is different. Something's changed. Or I'd like to think so.
He shuts me up with a kiss. A desperate, suffocating kiss, drowning me in his heat, in his presence, in

"Will Hogwarts give me my eyes back?!" I shout. "What the fuck am I supposed to do there? I can't even do magic now!"
His hands clench into fists. "If he had killed you, everything would be much simpler, you know."
Your voice is not your voice. It doesn't matter.

"Feminine hobbies for women are encouraged."

"Wizards don't fix my condition,” he said.

The room's grown warmer, and I pull the blanket down my bare chest.
[3] - Dialogue from the film “The Way He Looks” (2014, dir. Daniel Ribeiro)
"No, come in."
Last night, after... what had happened in the living room, we went straight to bed.
But there is nothing.
"Sorry." I drop his hand. "I'm not here to apologise. I wanted to help."
He puts the stopper back, handing me the vial. "It's yours. Your birthday present."
"I have to go." I stand up. "I'll be back in a few days, I think. You must not leave the room. I told them that the Death Eaters took your body when they fled. So everyone here thinks you are dead, too."
I dash down the stairs to the basement, praying that her shrieks cover the noise I make. When I wrench the kitchen door open, by the sounds from the hall I realise Yaxley is dealing with Dumbledore's shadow. I sprint across the kitchen to the backyard and shut the door, leaning with my back against it, and try to catch my breath. Insane with terror, I realise that Yaxley is going to search the house. Even if he doesn't intend to do it right now, he'll let Death Eaters do it later, now that Fidelius has failed.
After Malfoy finally leaves, I go to bed, forgetting to take my Dreamless Sleep.
There's a click of the closing door and the sound of him pressing the switch on the wall. "Do you mind?"
"Just you taste and find out." He winked, heading out of the room.
"Harry," she warns.
"I know, but I never did, so…"
He leads Astoria to the centre.
"Yes, so that neither of you would be able to expose the other." Dumbledore stands up and walks to the window. "And there's another thing you should know, Harry." With his back to me, he looks into the darkness outside.
"Yes."
your Father used to say. You had always been good at doing as you were told. It had its benefits.
"The what?"
Mother doesn't reply for a while.
"It is quiet here," Henry said, dragging his valise along the corridor past the identical dark wooden doors.
Annoyance would lace your words later. You would just get up and leave the room.
"Hi, I'm still here." I waved my hand in front of your face.
So I spend evenings with Malfoy on the back porch by the kitchen door. He's not that bad. He's not bad at all. I've come to appreciate his company.
"In the tent!" A voice shouts, and footsteps scatter, approaching over the stones.
Of course, it is. A potion. What else did I expect?
"Malfoy, do you really think that--"
"I wanted to

I draw my wand and take a deep breath and reach into my heart for the things that I've never shown anyone, things I've been keeping a secret even from myself for a long time. Things that call my Patronus to life.
This is disgusting.
"Draco?" Goyle sounds scared. "What are you doing?"
"Very well." I clap my hands. "Now, Severus Snape. Come forward."
"Pans made me admit it. Told me she's gay too. That's when we decided to put her parents off," he continues.
. He doesn't feel like me though. I don't feel like him either. I am someone else, too. I have nothing to do with all this.
We don't talk about the hearing with Potter. He never asks. All that he needs to know, he already knows from Granger.
You were laughing.
Waking up around lunchtime, I stagger out of bed and head to the shower.
Chills spread to my bones every time I think that there are still
"What?"
I hop off the broom, running to kneel beside him.
"Where are we going?" He drops my hand.
"I don't know, I... I haven't seen him."
"Did you expect me
"What? I didn't choose the Mistletoe either!"
Harry nods, and I finally remove my hand. He raises his wrist to look at it, and I see the bite marks have disappeared, skin already knitting closed with only a hint of redness and a thin scar in the place where my spell cut it. He points at his mouth, as though asking how long should he hold it.
And one dark lord later. Why?
"Are you going to the Weasleys'?" He asks, his voice strangely careful.
And you don’t even bother to deny it."
"Son... but how?" Tears brim in his whisper.
"What's going on?" Ivy asks, and you realise that you are still holding her hand.
"Like what?"
down his legs (have they always been that long...?)
as though we are one, and I can't tell where one of us begins and the other ends. His hand on my thigh presses me firmly into him.
It doesn't make any sense, it can't possibly be true. Why would he come to Hogwarts, of all places? Still, I don't doubt the meaning of these words. A feeble voice at the back of my mind tries to tell me that he has come for
Malfoy laughs, looks like he's really amused.
He does.
We got a habit of flying together after classes  a couple of times a week. Ron joined us once, but he feels awkward around Malfoy, so usually we're alone.
“Mr. Potter-“ She began before Harry cut her off.
“Harry, you can go faster. Much, much faster.” Draco said breathlessly. “I want you to fuck me now. I’m beyond ready.”
Harry hauled himself to his feet and held out his hand for the older man to take.
“Well, I guess that takes care of that.” Harry thought to himself.
After making the short walk from the car into the house, Harry quickly made his way up the stairs, hoping to avoid his relatives for as long as possible. Thankfully, no one tried to stop him, and he made it to the safety of his room without any interruption.  After taking a look around his small room, Harry left his trunk by the door, moved the cage to its spot on his desk, and threw himself down on his bed. Something as menial as taking the train home and riding in the car to house shouldn’t have left him this tired, but all he could think about was sleeping. So, with that thought, Harry rolled over and drifted off into oblivion.
“Come on, Draco. Just show me; whatever it is can’t be that bad. Did you break something and can’t fix it or what? I promise, as long as you don’t burn the manor down, I don’t really care.” Harry said.
Hello everyone :) I swear, I'm not dead! Just super busy in my day to day life. I forced myself to stay home and write this out (I feel like it's obvious to tell, I think it's kind of rushed and really, really short) but I wanted to kind of write about Severus before I moved on in the story, sooooo yeah. Please enjoy this and let me know if you do in the comments (or if you hate it) and I'll start working on chapter 10 in the meantime!
was gone.
’ back into the kitchen, the pair took off out the door leading to the lake, Harry telling Draco that the men had probably been waiting for a while. They spotted the professors standing next to the giant tree everyone was so fond of and headed towards them, though it became obvious as they drew closer that the two men were arguing. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand as they neared.
He could hear Draco’s breath hitch, but it didn’t last long.
Harry started to move his finger in and out, pressing a kiss to Draco’s shoulder or neck every few moments, until Draco told him to add another finger.
Snape seemed satisfied with what he did, or didn’t, see in Harry’s mind, because as quick as the attack came on, it stopped.
” Dumbledore barely whispered.
“You don’t have to ask, Draco.” Harry replied, blushing lightly.
Harry beamed. He’d just received two incredible gifts and he was having trouble keeping the tears away. He wasn’t sad by any means, but extremely happy.
“Close your eyes and empty your mind,
“Sure. I’ll be right down.” He said.
“Yes. But I can’t allow it, not with Voldemort being able to penetrate your mind.”
Seconds later, there was a massive scream of rage followed by a spell that exploded the wooden table behind which they were all taking cover.
“I need to confess something, but I don’t want to because talking about it makes it real… And I don’t want it to be real….” Harry started, before sucking in a deep breath and continuing, “I-I told Hedwig to leave.”
When they made it to the bathroom, Harry leaned into the shower and turned the taps on, turning around once again to Draco. They shared another kiss as steam slowly seeped out of the shower, eventually encasing them in a hazy cloud of warm mist, until Harry started pulling his shirt up, making Draco lift his arms, and then quickly discarding his own. Trousers and pants quickly followed their shirts, and Draco froze as he watched Harry get in and cautiously step under the spray.
His face flamed and he experienced a moment of total embarrassment before realizing that this was probably going to happen eventually anyway. He calmed down considerably after that and instead relished in the fact that Draco had come to check on him last night. Not once had Draco complained, even when Harry had tried to hiccup out a “sorry” in the shower. Draco had told him to “shut it,” and held him tighter.
Narcissa just shook her head and spoke softly. “Don’t you spend a second more thinking about it, Severus. I know in my heart that you did your best. It’s more than we could have asked for with the situation being what it is.”
“Sorry, Draco… I just.” Harry started, before sighing again. “I just let myself hope for something that I shouldn’t have. And I felt like a first-year, all over again, staring into the Mirror of Erised… I keep hoping that I’ll somehow be able to talk to them, my parents, and I know it’s childish, and I want it so fucking bad… But, Remus was, I don’t know, kind enough to let me know that my parents probably didn’t have time to get portraits done before, well, you know what.
Spotting a tree, Harry pointed the front of the broom towards the ground and slowly descended until their feet touched the ground. Harry dismounted after Draco and the two retreated into the offered shade of the tree.
Harry responded immediately, bringing Draco into his arms again as he picked up the pace, and Draco
“Right.” Draco replied.
“Enjoying the view.” Harry replied with a shrug.
This only seemed to make it worse for Draco, who finally bust out into a laugh. Harry stared at him waspishly until he couldn’t suppress the soft laughs that wanted to escape.
“Of course not! Meemy was only hoping you would be back sooner. Master Potter is refusing to rest until he is speaking to you.” Meemy said.
had tried to rape him, but he surprised to find that that was all he felt towards the man. In fact, once he got past those emotions, he felt a cold detachment from him. Almost like the emotion had evolved into something else. That was certainly interesting.
, if you’d like to call it that. It’s probably going to be upsetting, but I think you should know that the Dark Lord has captured your uncle. Dumbledore and I went to confirm this, earlier this afternoon. We found this when we searched the house. ”
Harry took a few minutes as the sun set to catch his breath and rethink his strategy. Simply saying the spell in his mind was obviously not enough. It might work for the simple spells, but anything he thought of that would destroy the boulder and it really didn’t have the oomph it needed. He sat down in the grass and started brainstorming to see if there was an approach he hadn’t thought of.
“Err… okay. Sorry that he was so forward. He surprised me, too.” Harry said.
“What do you mean, ‘what type of man he is’?” Potter asked, his voice sounding scratchy again.
“All I want is to see him for myself,
Carefully, so he didn’t jostle Draco and wake him, Harry placed the boy's hand on the bed and stood up, stretching as he did so. He left the room shortly after, intent on going to his bed and possibly getting another couple of hours of sleep. As he was closing the door to Draco’s room, however, a figure behind him spoke and Harry jumped. He spun around, wand at the ready, before he realized that it was Mrs. Malfoy.
. He carried him past the threshold and carefully placed him in the chair that sat to the far left corner of the room. Spinning around, he was momentarily lost in the memories that this place held.
He stood there for a moment, letting the water from his face drip and wet his shirt before he decided to just take a shower. He was hoping that it would make him feel a little better, and showering usually did that. He left the bathroom and headed out of Draco’s room, entering his own room a short moment later. He numbly walked to his bathroom and stripped down, turning the taps in the shower on to a random temperature before climbing in.
” The death eater screamed before being blasted backwards into a shop front.
Harry closed the door and stripped his pajamas off as he walked towards the closet and fished around for a pair of shorts and a black tank top. He waved his wand at his mouth and cast a breath freshening charm, which caused his mind to go back to yesterday morning. He grinned at the memory before exiting the closet and moving over to the bed. Draco’s mouth was slightly open and both his arms were lying out in front of him. Harry wished he had a camera so he could capture this moment, but contented himself with leaning down and pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead. With a small smile, Harry left the room and headed downstairs to meet Severus.
Severus had to think for a second. It seemed like a lifetime ago that it had happened.
He noted that the room itself was painted in a deep red, maybe merlot or currant? There were two chairs sitting next to a large window to the left of the room, which Harry assumed overlooked part of the grounds. Continuing along the left wall led his eyes to a door, a few feet from the door that Meemy had brought him through the night before. He continued to skim his eyes around the room, seeing that to the right of the room, there was a fireplace, with a loveseat and comfortable looking armchair, both set in shades of deep red, sitting directly in front of it. Further to the right of the room was another door, which led to who knew where. As he was sitting there looking around, Harry’s bladder made itself uncomfortably known, and he needed to know where the bathroom was.
Vernon’s eyes fell to his wand and he fell silent, casting worried glances from Petunia to Severus to the wand in a rapid cycle.
He could tell when Harry had completely entered him and let out another shaky breath that turned into a laugh when Harry wrapped his arms around him and kissed his neck.
“Do not make me regret this, Harry.” Dumbledore said quietly, before backing up and speaking loud enough to include Narcissa and Draco. “Please, allow us entry past your wards, Harry. We will get started on the Fidelius Charm as soon as we are through.”
“Professor Snape is in trouble. I think he needs help. I need you to get someone for me” Harry said.
Again, Harry felt the anger leaping in his chest, and this time, his mouth was open and ready to strike.
He felt the fingers tilting his chin up from the side and quickly looked Harry in the eyes.
“I… had some things to attend to, though I doubt that is of any concern of yours.” Severus replied.
Harry shook his head. He would think about this later. Right now, he needed to focus on keeping his thoughts and memories contained behind the barrier. He took a breath, securing his mind as he did so, and walked back to the house.
“Meemy?” Harry called, wrapping a towel around his waist.
P.S. The story is probably going to go a -little- quicker than I had originally intended. I feel terrible about taking months and months between each chapter, so to compensate, I've sped things up. I hope it doesn't come across too terribly.
Severus couldn’t help but derisively snort. Of course the Potter’s were wealthy. Not as wealthy as the Malfoy’s, for example, but this place gave him the feeling of discomfort that posh environments usually brought on. Sure, he had been to Potter manor in the past, but whenever he visited, he spent all of his time with Lily in the potions room, thus never really seeing what the manor truly had for accommodations. With a sigh, he stepped into the bathroom. The thought of just lying down in bed pulled at his tired brain, but Severus knew he would sleep better after a decent shower.
Harry nodded again, bracing himself mentally for whatever was about to happen.
“Listen, Harry. Owls in the wizarding world are fiercely loyal. There are stories out there about Owls who have died attempting to save their masters, and I truly doubt that she’s actually gone. She might be giving you some time, surely, and I’m sure that her feelings were probably a little hurt, but…   she’ll be back. Or she’ll be waiting for you to find her. She knew, probably more than
“Alright… Well, I just, you know… I never got to say sorry for causing that mess at the ministry. For getting Sirius and Ron killed… And Hermione, who knows if she’ll ever wake up…  You lost another friend because of me, and I just…I don’t know. I’ve come here, and pushed everything behind me and I feel like I’ve forgotten everyone, and I’m just… I’m just sorry, Remus.” Harry said, voice cracking at the end as he lost control of his emotions.
“Sorry, took a bit longer than expected. Found some of my dad’s old pj’s and they needed to be shrunk a bit.” Harry explained.
“Well, he is tall, dark, and handsome… and
“Harry, I…”
“Uh, wait. Your mum said she was going to visit a relative that she hadn’t seen in a long time. She said she’d probably be gone a few days.” Harry said.
He couldn’t help the laugh the came out when Draco’s eyes shot open and scowled at him.
Harry had his question answered rather abruptly when Draco was extremely close, extremely fast. Harry could have sworn that he phased into his personal space, but suddenly, all of that didn’t matter. Draco had leaned forward another two inches and he was kissing him. It took Harry a full five seconds to process what was happening, and he could feel the hesitation and worry coming from Draco. In fact, the other boy had started to pull back when Harry realized what was going on.
They all smiled at him, even his elves off to the side were beaming with joy.
“I don’t think Draco ever truly approved in what was going on, not until Lucius found Severus. Neither myself nor Draco had ever seen Lucius so happy in life. It was like he had gotten a second chance to be happy, something he thought himself undeserving of after the first war. It was hard not to approve of their relationship, not when it was doing so much good. Lucius was even making great strides in trying to get us out from under the Dark Lord, something I never imagined would happen.
“Of course, Master Harry.” Meemy said before snapping her fingers and disappearing with a small *
“I think you are.” Draco said with an ill-hidden smirk.
“You will accompany me to Privet Drive. We must verify that Vernon has indeed been captured. Did they mention anything of Petunia or Dudley?” Dumbledore questioned.
Releasing a small sigh, Severus walked towards the kitchen with a scowl in place. When he arrived, he found Draco wrapped in his mother’s arms, two cups of tea steaming away on the table.
“Sure, mother. Give me some time to make myself presentable and then we can be off.” Draco said.
“This is so wonderful. Thank you so much, everyone.” Harry said.
“I’ve been contemplating the best way to train you since I set you the task of learning how to cast nonverbally, and I have decided that we will start with honing your reflexes first. From now until your birthday, this will be our main area of focus, and I think the best way for you to achieve results would be to duel with me. Not in a traditional sense, but I want you under pressure when we train.
“Sorry, love, I got a little carried away.” He replied, turning them around.
Harry’s eyes narrowed at him before a sly smile broke out across his face.
“I agree. But what do you say we head inside and get cleaned up?” Harry said, holding his hand out.
“Of course, Mrs. Malfoy.” He said. “Nipsy!”
“Look, Harry- I’ll assume it’s okay for me to call you by your given name?” Severus asked, cracking an eye open to look at the boy.
“Are you cold?” Draco asked.
“Care to join me? I need to get some air.” Harry asked.
“Meemy is only one of three house elves here, Master Harry. Would Master like to meet the others?” Meemy asked.
“I understand. We must go then, to a place where we can safely wait until Dumbledore is able to meet with you. I know just the place, if the owner is willing to harbor fugitives of the Dark Lord.” Severus said, grinning by the time he was finished.
This time, there was no hesitation from his teacher and Harry was quick enough to shield and dodge the first few spells that Severus threw. The outcome was the same, however, when his “
He came, exploding into Draco’s mouth while Draco kept the pace up. Harry could feel him swallowing as wave after wave of pure pleasure hit him. Only when Harry collapsed onto the bed, boneless, did Draco release him from his mouth.
Harry froze, his face immediately heating up.
Severus nodded his understanding and she disappeared with a loud *
“You know, Harry,” Draco started. “I was thinking about you the other day. You were outside with Severus and I was watching you duel with him when an errant daydream ran through my head.”
“Thank you, Professor. Since our training a few days ago, I have done nothing except eat, sleep and practice Occlumency. I was confident that I had it down yesterday afternoon. You see, about halfway through yesterday, I noticed I was able to keep a steady train of thought even while I had the shield up. After that, it became easier and easier to hold in place…” Harry trailed off, realizing he was rambling.
Harry started dragging his prick back and forth over Draco’s, every now and then punctuating a thrust with a kiss. Soon enough, Harry felt the hands on his back tighten and Draco locked up, letting a small moan escape from his mouth. Harry picked the pace up, taking only a few seconds to drag his own orgasm up to the surface. He joined Draco in bliss shortly after, burying his head into the crook of the other boy’s neck. He stopped moving shortly after, not wanting to ruin the post-climax high by accidentally rubbing something overly sensitive. He opened his eyes and watched as Draco’s breathing steadily returned to normal. He waited, and eventually, Draco opened his eyes, looking at Harry with a slight smile on his face.
He would get ready for the day, and maybe, maybe today he would get nonverbal casting down.
“I don’t want to talk about it, mother.” Draco said sniffly from in between his legs.
It took him a few seconds to snap out of the daze he was in, but when he focused on the doorway, he saw a line of black-clad figures standing in a line and advancing on his home. In the middle of them stood Voldemort, face alight with rage and fury. They were already casting spells towards him; red, green, purple, blue, and yellow colors flew towards him. They exploded around him, some blasting holes in the walls surrounding the doorway, some missing him and hitting the wall mere inches away from his head, starting small fires where they landed. Severus knew if he didn’t act immediately, he was dead.
Harry chanced a glance inside the room at this point. He saw Severus kneeling down in front of the headmaster. Dumbledore was admiring his right hand and Harry gasped when he saw that it was blackened and looked… dead. Dumbledore must have heard him gasp because he looked Harry in the eyes and gave him a small, serene smile before turning his attention back to his hand.
of you to finally arrive.” Harry rasped out.
Severus nodded his agreement and crept down the short hallway. He briefly checked the closet under the stairs where Harry used to be kept – nothing. He took a deep breath and continued on, using a spell to open the hallway door. On the other side, he found more smeared blood, which lead over to the couch in the living area. He glanced around the room before making his way over to the couch. Here he found a large pool of congealing blood.
“Merlin, yes, Harry. Please move.” Draco rasped out. The feeling of Harry’s cock so deep inside him and the dull press against his prostate was making Draco want to squirm, just to get a feeling of that flash of ecstasy.
“Keep eyeing him Harry, and I’m going to think you were serious about having a thing for older men.” He said.
“Uh, sorry. What did you say?” Harry asked, shaking his head slightly.
Harry was pretty sure he’d never been this relaxed before, and he was truly enjoying life here. Nearly two weeks had passed since he’d arrived at the manor, and he had spent every minute he could exploring his ancestor’s home.  The first couple of days he spent searching through all the rooms; he was blown away to find out just what it had to offer.
“Merlin, Potter. Where did you learn how to do this?” Draco squeaked out.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I don’t know what to say besides I don’t think I’ve ever been this angry at people I’ve never met before. You should have been treated like a prince after defeating the Dark Lord. These relatives should have worshipped the ground you walked on, instead, they treated you like a bloody house elf.” Draco said.
“Thank you, Professor.” Harry said, teary-eyed.
“Just that it appeared they left.” Severus replied.
“I expected nothing less from your first attempt. You may open your eyes.” Severus directed.
“Thanks, Meemy. I appreciate it.” Harry said.
His wand was in his hand before he even thought about needing it, and with a quick, complicated twirl, he blasted Voldemort across the room and into a wall.
“I think, Mr. Potter, that the first thing we should focus on is nonverbal casting. This should be relatively easy for you to master, as you already have a strong grip on your mind. Mastering this before your next meeting with the Dark Lord is essential.” Severus said.
Dumbledore was silent for a moment, leaving Harry to look back and forth from him to the ring, before he spoke.
He arrived seconds after the old man, and noticed that Dumbledore was stiff with tension, wand by his side. Severus stopped in the middle of putting his wand away as he, too, noticed what Dumbledore had upon landing.
Hello everyone :) I hope you're enjoying the fic so far. I know that my chapters are posted few and far between, and I can only hope that you are finding other fics to occupy your time. I've started a new job and have been working 12-16 hour days. It takes the joy out of life, to be honest, and all I want to do with my downtime is sleep. But, I have been spending the free time that I do get trying to write a couple of words here and there. So, I hope you enjoy this chapter, and the -eventual- others. As always, please leave comments/ suggestions/ constructive criticism in the comments. Happy June <3
Harry watched as her hair turned from the platinum blonde that he was so used to seeing, to a deep, beautiful brown. His mouth was hanging open in shock.
“Dizzy, please show them the way. See that you get them anything they need, whatever it is.” Harry said.
“It’s just… I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I’m surprised that I fell asleep outside, exposed as I was. I was just wondering if, maybe, you wouldn’t mind staying here for a bit? Just until I fall asleep again. If it’s no trouble, of course.” He said quickly.
.” Severus said calmly.
“Can I join you?” Draco asked.
They ate in silence for a few moments, with nothing more than a crunch or sound of swallowing between them. Harry was about to open his mouth to speak, but just then, Professor Snape walked in the kitchen. His eyes scanned the room before they landed on Draco, and Harry could swear that he saw a flash of concern before the professor switched his eyes to him. He walked over to the bar they were sitting at and leaned in close to Harry.
at the end of the school year was a prime example of that. If the boy had used his brain instead of letting his emotions run rampant, he would have seen that Severus had every intention of checking on the mutt staying at Grimmauld Place.
“Shower?” He asked.
She had brought them some roast beef sandwiches for lunch, along with ice-cold, fresh lemonade. It had been a nice reprieve from the heat of the day to kick back under one of the trees on the bank of the lake. They had eaten mostly in silence, with Severus breaking the quiet every now and again with pointers for Harry. But that had been five hours ago, and Harry’s stomach was growling.
The one constant in his life, the one person he was sure he could always count on had a date with death. It was unfair and Harry wanted to scream his sorrow. Why did the people he cared about keep dying? He knew Dumbledore wasn’t dead yet, but he only had a year. It was almost worse knowing it was coming than if he had died tonight.
.” Narcissa replied.
Vernon was caught mid-sentence, and though he tried and tried, getting angrier and angrier in the process, he couldn’t utter a single sound. Severus took a moment before speaking again, watching Vernon work himself into a rage over not being able to speak.
he was lucky.
“Why did you leave, Professor?” Potter asked in a scratchy voice.
Again, the room fell to silence and Severus was tempted to speak, to offer further explanation to pacify Potter’s questions. The boy, however, spoke again.
“Three, two, one…” Snape counted down quietly. “
They continued the birthday chant as the elves placed the cake on the table. The flames from the torches bounced off the shards of color embedded in the icing and Harry was mesmerized.
“How do you feel?” Dumbledore asked tentatively.
Harry stood motionless, watching as the pillar of Slytherin house broke and crumbled. He never imagined that Draco, the Ice Prince, the perfect embodiment of their house, someone who had a mask that rivaled a brick wall, someone who could shut his emotions down without a second thought, would ever be a sobbing heap on the ground. He felt his heart break as he turned and walked to the headmaster.
“I’ll kill him, Harry. If you want him dead, I’ll do it. No one will ever know.” Draco said, pulling back from him.
After another sharp remind from his bladder, Harry located the toilet, which was sat at the end of a sizable single sink vanity. Quickly relieving himself, Harry washed up and headed back through the closet into the room in search of his trunk. He needed a good wash before he took on the day, and he would be damned if he wasn’t going to take advantage of that shower. After locating and extracting his clothes, he made his way back into the bathroom, turning the tap of the shower to hot before stripping out of clothes. Being naked suddenly reminded him of why he was there in the first place, and he viciously kicked his pants across the floor.
True to her word, Harry had waited no longer than ten minutes before he was tucking into a plate of steaming meats and potatoes, and had just finished half his plate when he heard the cracks of apparition outside.
As they neared the stables, Harry could immediately tell that there had been repairs to it. Where there had been rotting, moldy wood and gaps where boards were missing completely, there were now fresh planks and new paint. Harry rushed to see the new interior and was delighted to see that it was completely cleaned. There were no cobwebs and no dust to be seen. Four of the stables had fresh hay already placed inside, and the floor itself no longer gave the impression that one wrong step would send you crashing through it. He was shocked.
Harry nodded his head and called out to the group of adults who had moved away and formed a small circle.
“Yes.”
Harry had heard, and seen, enough. He walked quickly away from the room and stumbled his way up the stairs, not stopping until he had reached Draco’s room where he collapsed in a chair beside the bed.
Remus sighed and suddenly looked much older. He had a slight frown marring his face that made Harry want to comfort him.
Harry was woken the next morning by a dark figure looming over him. He reflexively pulled Draco tighter to him in a panic before he realized that it was just Severus. Just Severus who was now looking at Harry and Draco in bed. Together. With no shirts on.
Severus accidently let his concentration slip for a fraction of a second. He couldn’t help but feel satisfied that Vernon had been captured after what Harry had told him yesterday. When he realized what he was doing, he snapped back to the present, but it was too late. The Dark Lord had seen what he had been thinking and he was furious. Severus could see the rage burning in the red eyes and knew that he had less than a second to react.
Harry let out a small sigh and turned to Draco.
“At the very least, I wish you would have told me, Professor. I thought you left b-because you were disgusted with m-me, disgusted with what you had seen in my m-memories.” Potter said, voice cracking with emotion.
“I know, but still. I don’t know... I can’t explain it.” Harry replied.
“Er… hi, Professor.” Harry stated rather lamely, absent-mindedly rubbing his sore ribs.
“Thank you, that was… that was awesome.” Draco fumbled out.
Alecto let out a cackle and Severus had had enough.
“Of course, Master Harry. Make sure you is washing up before coming to the table.” Meemy replied before disappearing.
You have to want the curse to hurt someone, and righteous anger wouldn’t work. Could he take that theory and use it here? He was desperate to try, and this was as good a lead as any.
This, apparently, was the last that Petunia could take, and she proceeded to faint on the spot. Severus said nothing more and brushed his robes off as he left the kitchen. He peeked his head into the cupboard under the stairs, something he had learned used to be Harry’s bedroom from Vernon’s memories, and sneered in disgust. Slamming the door when he was done, Severus made his way for the front door, only to be stopped by Vernon’s scream that tore through the air. He hesitated, but with one more smile of vindictive satisfaction, Severus apparated from Privet Drive.
“Mrs. Malfoy, I can assure you-“ He tried to say.
“What are you doing, Potter?” Draco asked.
Harry complied and tried to mirror his Professors calm demeanor.
“Eventually, he turned me on my stomach and pulled my pants down. I heard his pants drop and decided to try and kick him rather than scream for help. I hoped against hope that it would be enough. I was lucky that my blind kick had hit its intended target, and my uncle went down. I pulled my pants up and gathered my things. My bedroom door blew open before I even got to it and I was faced with my aunt, who looked like she had seen a ghost. I told her I was leaving, that I couldn’t stay there any longer. She didn’t try to stop me when I pushed past her.” Harry finished, nearly choking on his tears.
“Good. There are a couple of other things I’d like to speak to you about, while I’ve got you here. The first is your spell training.” Professor Snape said. “Though he tries, Dumbledore has yet to find a suitable teacher for the Defense Against Dark Arts position, and you’re seriously lacking in education for it. If you’re willing, I’d like to train you myself. And not just DADA, but real attack and defense spells.” Snape said.
Shaking his head to get rid of the guilt he was feeling because he was ignoring his mother’s letter by leaving, he said, “Aunt Petunia… I have to go. I don’t care what you do with that foul bastard, but I’m not staying here.” And with that, he lightly pushed past Petunia, dragging his trunk and the cage loudly behind him as he descended the stairs.
“The smears lead to the living room couch, where I found a large pool of blood. The air is still heavy with dark magic, so I’m assuming they tortured him before taking him away. Did you find anything?” Severus replied.
“Aren’t you forgetting something?” Draco asked with one eye cracked.
in order. When we go to Diagon Alley for your school supplies, you can get whatever you desire, entirely on me.” Narcissa said, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.
The man said nothing for a few moments before finally speaking. “Harry, I don’t want you leaving the safety of these grounds until September the first. I know it’s not fair, but the weight of the wizarding world rests on your shoulders, and we cannot risk you falling into Voldemort’s hands, and this was too close of a call. That is all I will say on the matter, and I want your word that you will follow this rule.”
?” Harry squawked out.
“I’ll give it a try, Professor.” Harry replied, then cheekily added with a small grin, “And please, call me ‘Harry’ or ‘Potter’, no need for the Mr. anymore.”
“He said that now my Godfather was out of the picture, he was going to teach me what happened if I kept disrespecting him. He shut the door and unzipped his pants. I tried to apologize for disrespecting him, and he started choking me. He told me if I wasn’t quiet, that he would kill me. I tried to prepare myself to scream, knowing that I would only have one chance to do it and that my odds weren’t great. I wasn’t expecting him to molest me while he rubbed himself, and I was stunned for a moment.
Harry’s birthday was fast approaching and he decided that he wanted to visit the neighboring town. He figured while he was there, he would be able to find himself a gift, and would be able to get out of the house for a bit. So with that thought in mind, Harry left on a bright and sunny morning in the middle of July, with nothing else but his muggle clothes, some money, and his wand.
“Healthy?” Severus said viciously.
“I’m sorry for what’s about to happen,” Harry said, sorrow leaking into his voice, before pointing his wand at the door and shouting, “
say. He couldn’t express how happy Draco’s defense of him had made him.
“So, what do we do about this?” Professor Snape continued. “We must have you master Occlumency. The shield in your mind must be strong enough to withstand the Dark Lord. And in order to accomplish that, I want you to first get a feel for what strong shields are like. On the count of three, I want you to use
’ charm that revealed it was barely half past four.
*Pop* *Pop*
Harry looked over his shoulder at her.
Draco chuckled. “Simple breath-freshening charm before and after a blowjob. They always talked about it in the dorms, but I’ve never tried it. It helped quite a bit.”
“Sorry, but please, just call me Harry.” He said.
“I think I should warn you… Though caution might be a better word here, but... I just want you to be prepared for what may or may not be in your vaults at Gringotts. I think I can garner a guess as to what you’re hoping to find there, and I honestly do not think that Lily and James had time to commission a portrait to be made… And honestly, pup, even if they did, well… You have to spend time with it, as it’s more of an impression of who you were, than an automatic magical capture. I know it sounds a little, bizarre, I guess. But I don’t know, Harry. I just don’t want to see you get your hopes up and then be let down.” Remus explained.
“Very much so, Professor. Why do I want to put it on so badly?” Harry asked.
Harry cracked a grin at that. “It’s not that... I’ve never told anyone about this. I think Severus knows or knows some of it, and he had a similar reaction when he found out about what my uncle tried to do, but it’s different with you knowing, and defending me. It... makes me happy.”
“I said it’s bloody hot.” Draco replied. “And I don’t like being ogled.”
Harry had only so much as let the errant thought of his wand being in his hand cross his mind and, quite magically, he was holding his wand.
“If the dust covering you is any indication, then yes, I think that really happened.” Draco replied.
that Draco had been watching him. What he didn’t understand is why Draco hadn’t come said something to him. Was Draco upset with Harry for not telling him sooner? Before Harry offered to give him a massage?
He pulled his slim, naked frame from under the sheets and stood up, twisting and cracking his back in the process, his arms pulled high over his head to stretch the muscles there.
Mere seconds later, the triple-decked, violently purple bus popped into existence; this time, though, Harry didn’t give Stan, the conductor he’d dealt with the last time, the chance to question him. After paying the Galleon fee that it would cost to get him from Surrey to Somerset, Harry quickly retreated to the upper floor of the bus. He chose the bed nearest the stairs, and had barely stuffed his trunk under the bed before the bus shot forward, nearly crushing his legs in the oncoming torrent of beds. He quickly jumped on the bed and leaned his head back on the pillows, silently praying that it wouldn’t take long to get there.
When they had finished planning their trip, which they were set to embark on in less than two days, Harry and Draco stood up, intent on finding Narcissa and seeing if she would be able to accompany them to the horse-dealer, who was located just outside of Exeter, sometime this coming weekend. Remus stopped them, however.
“Harry, I’m-“ was all the warning he had as all his senses were assaulted at once, and he violently came with a loud moan. His bum hole reactively clamped down on Harry’s dick, and it registered in the back of his mind that Harry had made two final pushes before he too locked up, but it had been pushed down as he rode his own orgasm, Harry stroking him slowly and lightly long after he was done.
“Not bad for your first day. You are in better shape than I gave you credit for, This is what will occupy our mornings from now on, and over time, it
If you've noticed any plot holes, grammar errors/ mistakes, please feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to address them!
“Certainly, Professor, but are you sure this is the safest place? The Death Eaters have to know I’m around here somewhere. They found me in a small village not far from here. I... wasn’t as careful as I should have been when I came here.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco closed the short distance to Harry’s lips and slipped his tongue in between his slightly parted lips, taking full control and rooting Harry to the spot. For a moment, Harry forgot why he was leaving in the first place, content to just lay in bed with Draco and let him explore his mouth. He realized, though, that he really did need to get ready, and broke the kiss with a sigh.
“Okay… promise you won’t freak out and hex me?” Draco asked.
“Now try to drop it.”
However, his train of thought was stopped when he felt his wards being viciously attacked; he grimaced. It seemed that the Dark Lord was
They didn’t talk much during dinner. Everyone was hungry and the food was delicious. They had all had seconds of everything, and Harry was pretty sure he could eat a third burger if he really wanted to.
“Yes. And I trust you to go slow, even if I’m not.” He replied, and Harry nodded his head in agreement.
*Pop*
Harry grinned. “Definitely ready.”
“The next two years were some of the best of my life. I had found freedom at Hogwarts, I had friends who cared for me, and no one looked at me like I was less than human. The Dursley’s were too afraid of me when I would return for the summer to actually try and discipline me, so the summers were bearable.
Or if I arrived later, and he would be already seated, Ron and Hermione would walk me right to his desk.
"May I?" I whisper in his ear.
his fingers are fixing a tie at my throat...
"He's just... a guy." I shrug and stuff my trembling hands in my pockets. "He's just..."
He half-stepped into the room. "Hermione is taking the case."
You fucked me furiously into the mattress, the weight of your body on my back holding me down. I let you.
They had erected the tent and carried Weasley inside to put him on the bunk. He moans a lot in his sleep. Granger says he's getting better. She's by his side now, sitting with a book in the shabby armchair.
Those years without his constant presence, without his measuring looks and immaculate posture, had brought something into your life that you'd never had before. Something like freedom. Something that would be taken away as soon as he stepped into the Manor again. Something that didn't have the right to exist when Father was near.
"Like that's not a problem."
- maybe there's something here.
You didn’t. What was there to say? He was right. You didn't even bother to hide them or conceal the titles. Fool.
My heart thudding, I approach the bed.
I look up.
I don’t want to listen to this. No matter what she may say now, it won’t change what had already happened. I kneel in front of the fireplace. "Does he know that you had something to do with my escape?"
The spells collide and explode in the air. The green one rebounds against the red and changes its course. It hits the Dark Lord square in the chest. He collapses and moves no more.
He wrenches the chain off my neck and hurls the locket into the far corner.
I can't stand it. Can't fucking stand it.
"I believe you know your way to the Slytherin Common Room," she snaps, once we descend the steps. "Do me a favour." She gestures at the corridor. "I am quite busy at the moment."
"What do you think, sir?" The shop assistant's refined voice reached you.
"Hermione!"
"You wish," I hissed right into your ear.
I sob and bend my face down over the void, feeling hot tears cooling on my skin in the morning breeze. When the sky turns white over the black forest, I finally step back and wipe my face. I really need to lie down.
Parkinson is by his side, telling him something. She is

Does he probably mean that...
I point my wand at Weasley.
"Kreacher!"
“Isn’t she kind of… annoying?” I say irritably.
“Yes. I’ll be in the locker room.” His voice sounds weird. “Call me if you need anything.” He retreats.
I haven't seen Potter for several years. He hasn't changed much. It only seems like he's grown, adding several inches, and now he's tall, around my own height, maybe. So unlike

His head snaps up.
"And how does gay look?" He laughs.
I know he won't.

"However, your mere presence here shows your effort and willingness to right the wrongs you did to Draco."
I am shaking. "I'm telling the truth. It's the coin Dumbledore gave me! I
I want Noir, but that would sound cheesy. It would sound stupid, it would be offensive, because there is no Noir and has never been - all this time it was only Malfoy. And now, when the dream and reality clash, when two images become one, I am at a loss. I don't understand what I feel, what I want. I don't know.
I'd whisper tiredly, my lips a brush away from yours. "It's been a hell of a night. Take me to bed."
When it fades into the evening air, you open your eyes to see that he is watching you.
insane, cold, dreadful voice. I'd recognise it anywhere.
This is too much. I stop.
"And how does your breaking the Vow that you swore to my sister serve our Lord?" The tip of Bella's wand presses under Severus' chin. He doesn't even flinch. Calm as a brick wall.
I put the note inside and close-open the lid. It passes. I exhale. It has to mean he waits for my reply, even if two weeks have passed since he sent this note.
"Draco!" Mother cries out.
Heat spreading down my limbs, I am suddenly embarrassed, suddenly aroused, suddenly not sure what to do next.
... sharp pain from him grabbing a fistful of your hair, forcing your face down...
"I don't know." I shrug. I really have no idea. I don’t think I care. "But I promised Dumbledore to help you, so... I must figure something out. Until then, you'd better stay here." I head to the door.
"I serve the cause." He grimaced when I asked him last night. What the hell did he mean? I didn't ask, he wouldn't tell me.
"How?" Granger asks in disbelief.
Potter's friends would be better
"So." He clears his throat. "What did your girlfriend tell you? I mean... when she saw us."
This is a goodbye-kiss.
Okay, good. I press the handle.
He insisted that I confided in him with the task the Dark Lord had given me.
There are a few of them.
I shout into the silent Great Hall. And wait. And wait.
"I am afraid not, my Lord. She fainted. She is unable to stand upright due to the fever. I beg your leave to deliver her to her chambers."
"You'd better be," Potter warns me.
to my left. "Master."
If I knew what to do or how, I would certainly make it right. I would grab his face between my palms; I would crush his lips to draw blood. I would be bold and reckless and sure. I don't know how.
Hermione rolls her eyes. "The
Not looking at him, I shake my head and take the door handle. "Dobby!"
Turn to the camera! Your comments on your rescue?!"
"Fuck, Malfoy!" I sit up again. "I thought you left. Next time, warn me or something?"
"I don't!" I nearly stomp my feet.
"You lied to the Dark Lord, Draco. You stood before him and lied to his face. That is when I became truly afraid. Your whole story was a lie to the last detail." Mother's face is grim. "If you slipped, if he as much as suspected anything. One word, Draco... a wrong word, a glance - he would have used Legilimency on you, and it would have cost you your life."
I am really glad that Weasley girl isn't here with us, but my stomach sinks anyway. Because Potter has just all but confirmed my suspicions: they are on a mission, the three of them; secret and dangerous, one that includes no one else.
Potter's got to side with me in that regard. I don't mind. He talks to me sometimes and overall doesn't act like I don't exist. When he looks in my direction, he looks
"Potter, I'm sorry. I did a shitty thing. I only realised just how shitty it was when the
"I'm not going."
"No, just exhausted and in need of sleep," Mother says. "When they brought you here, he followed and absolutely refused to leave. Madam Pomfrey ran diagnostic tests on him and found nothing amiss, except the overall exhaustion. So she ordered him to shower and eat, dosed him with Dreamless Sleep and put him into bed next to you. He woke up twice and went right back to sleep. I couldn't even talk to him properly, thank him for... saving your life, for everything."
I look him up and down.
Why did I think the game was even a good idea?
“Hi, Astoria, Maggie,” he replies.
I can't, I don't want to explain that she fainted when I... when Voldemort said Malfoy was dead.
"Listening to what Theodore told me, I couldn't

fulfil them." He slams his mug down into the sink. His voice is calm, but a pissed-off calm. "You're your own person." He heads to the door. "Good night."
"Don't leave me." My voice shakes as I press my forehead into his temple. "If
I would stay in the house for the time being, Potter said. For how long - he didn't know. He had to return to his Muggle relatives until his seventeenth birthday. He’d turn of age at the 31st of July and then... He didn't know what then. He had a lot of things to do and no idea how long it would take to complete them.
Your heart racing, you stared at him.
“You bring Astoria up all the time, lately…”
I blink, feeling a flutter of my eyelashes over his palm.
There's this
You brushed past me, making your way through the crowd. I followed. Not looking back, you pushed angrily between people on your way. You didn't stop at the bar or turn to the bathrooms, you went on and on across the club, until we were outside, where you finally whirled around under the streetlamp.
"I don't know... I always thought it to be a myth."
I stand back and let her be tortured.
A tug there is and disorientation for sure, but then - nothing. No swirl. I bump into the wall but still remain in the very much same corridor. Cursing, I try again, and my head hits the wall. Only then do I remember the textbook line etched into my memory:
Won't give me this one thing

"Ah! The
Face bewildered, Harry turns to me.
He presses himself to Granger and rocks her on the spot, his face full of her bushy hair, then pulls back and looks around.
"I don't think I'll be returning to her," Harry says quietly, "either way, I don't think I will. I never promised that I’d come back."
"I didn't help
Mumbling under his breath, Kreacher goes to the counter, and I sit at the table, unfolding the newspaper.

"Close the door, Potter, will you?"
The door closes.
"The what?" Harry asks.
There's more. More of them. More of you, more of me. More happiness all over the place in the living room of our home. The home I have just let a stranger in.
I stand up. "Goodnight, sir." Reaching the door, I turn. "Sir? Should I let Malfoy know?"
"Get out." You stare at him, grasping for the last shreds of composure.
"No, I'm taking it now." My hand is already reaching to the bedside table. Fuck it, fuck it all. I'm just gonna take it.
"Do you like it?"
Father most certainly will be appalled. No intricate phrasing, no
Instead, I will stare. Stare at your face that will not have changed in a year at all. Stare at the dark blue woolen scarf around your neck - the one that I gave you, the one that had once belonged to me. You'll still be wearing it.

"What?"
"What do you mean?"
"Henry Ponder."
He goes up to the parents - the two middle-aged couples - handing them a Bible.
The class begins.
He's right. We don't have a tent, and the cave is the best option available, but we haven't eaten anything since we left Weasley and Granger, so...
"Nevermind." I dig my fingers into his forearm. "C'mon, we're gonna be late."
My hand reaches down. I am hard.
When Ron and Hermione come to pick me up, I hear Malfoy hastily stuffing his things into his bag.

Darkness has faded a bit into the beginning of dawn, and I see she props herself on her elbow.

"Kreacher has outdone himself?" He takes my hand.

“Stop… wait,” he whispers, his breath laboured.

You didn't need to hear him talk to know, but the voice made something drop in your guts all the same.

"Oh, fuck off!" He'd laugh. "The brewing process is also
"You are not returning," he says quietly.
"Lucius will thank you generously." Mother turns to him. "And I am sure, once he is informed about these two, the Dark Lord-"
The house belonged to him, he explained as soon as I emerged from the bathroom, and was under the Fidelius Charm, so no one could Apparate in and out. He inherited it from Sirius Black, Mother's madman of a cousin, who happened to be Potter's godfather to boot. It was plainly written in Sirius' will that after his death Potter would get everything in his possession. That meant the house was his, as well as Kreacher, who obviously hated his new master, though he was bound to serve anyway.
The door opens and closes quietly, and now you feel someone's presence in the room. Afraid to breathe, you lie unmoving, your heart going mad.
I don’t know what’s the matter with me…
"Thanks but no, don't feel like it."
You'd spent the previous evening writing down that bullshit. You were doing as you'd been told, and even included certain Muggle details, so that your story would appear natural.
Mother pulls back and looks at me closely, and something shifts in her face, a flicker of understanding?
Harry is gentle, he would never hurt me, he...
"Now, anyone may come forward and strike the sinners⁴. Parents, do come forward!" Mr. Vice rises on his feet, gesturing to the group to stand up.
"How many times, Henry?"
It's his twin brother...
My face is hot; I feel as though I shouldn't be witnessing this, but can’t make myself look away.

"You're
"No." I try to sit up, but the hands on my shoulders force me to lie back down on the pillow.
Happiness for the years to come.
Brushing past us Malfoy turns, and our eyes meet.
"Yeah, sure." I stifle the spark of hope.
"What?" He snorted. "Who says that?"
"Draco!" Father says. "Draco." [18] He beckons to me, and I want to step back and blend into the crowd, but people part before me, recoil as if burnt, and here I stand - alone - before my Father and the Dark Lord.
"How did you get out of the cellar, ugly?!" She dances around him in a swirl of dark robes and her long hair flying.

He catches up with me, blocking my way.
Ron turned, moving out of your line of sight.

He wanted to? I stare at him. "Why didn't you?"
He said nothing. You put the glass down.
The rest of the day we avoid each other. Potter lies in the sun, toying with his snitch, and I deliberately don't look in his direction. But I can't stop imagining him naked. Thin and wiry, lithe muscles rippling alive under his skin as he stepped into the water. His slim strong thighs and prominent calves. The round globes of his small arse as he moved... and his dick,
On tenterhooks, waiting for him to return, I didn't even pretend to be reading, or asleep. I just sat there, waiting.
"Where are you staying?" I ask.

Only then do I realise this class was fun.
Swallowing your tears, you reached out, enclosing her in the circle of your arms. She tensed, and for a moment it felt as though she was going to throw your hands off and break free, before you felt the weight of her head on your shoulder, the silky touch of her hair against your jaw, the bitterly familiar, delicate fragrance of her perfume seeping into your senses, calming your frayed nerves.
Once in the rooftop garden, you head to the narrow spiral staircase in the corner, climbing up and up to the melody, until you emerge on the balcony and stop.
I bolt out, away from the window, aware that he is already opening the door.
"I think they'd accept him whenever he’d apply," Ron says, sitting down next to me on the sofa.
"No, listen... I figured you must do something and have failed so far, and I thought-"
"Yes."
"Master." He pops by my side.
Still raw after you, still bruised after everything, I couldn't even think of anyone who wasn't you. And the mere thought of you made me sick.
I bow and head out of the hall on wooden legs, feeling everyone's stare.
"Weasley."
Well…
I think and dive in your wake,
Very much like I am.
You turned your back to her, hugging the pillow.
There's a giant among them: long shaggy beard and hair and a moleskin coat. No, not a giant, it's Hagrid. Hagrid is holding a bundle in his arms.
Footsteps.
"Don't mind them". He makes a face and tucks his arm under his head. "I killed fucking Voldemort, can I have a moment of peace with my...
It snuggles a tad tighter across my chest and shoulders, tighter than I'm used to wearing my own things - barely nothing, we’re almost the same. The thought is warm. I tug at the collar, pulling it up over my nose and rub my face in it, breathing his smell in, revelling in the touch. My hands reach down to tug my pants off. I discard them on the carpet and climb into bed, switching off the bedside lamp. Only the faint glow of the fireplace remains.
I want Mother here, want to put my head on her lap and feel safe again. Want to tell her everything, unload this burden and breathe. If she only knew, she would be horrified; she still wouldn't be able to help me. I miss her. I remember Father's face the day he returned from Azkaban. He went there strong and proud and emerged a ruin of a man. Whatever horrors he may have done at the Dark Lord's command, he is my father, and if I fail... I can't fail. I don't have the right.
You flinched. "What are you doing?"
It's dark, and I am sprawled on the floor. I don't know where I am or how I got here. The last thing I remember...
And I scream again, scream myself hoarse, shaking all over.
I will never let anyone see
“Okay, let's do your project, why not? But if it doesn’t work and you fail your NEWTs - I'm not the one to blame.”
"Potter!" He jerked. "That hurts."
"I've got you..." Pressing me into his chest, he rocks me back and forth.
"What?"
I sleep for ages, aware of it even in my sleep. My dreams are a weird mix of nightmares and our nights with Harry in the cave. I scream or moan, I'm not sure, maybe both. When I finally wake, Mother is there, watching me from the armchair, a soft glow of a small table lamp leaving her face in shadows.
On my way out, I catch only a glimpse of Nott's brown hair and close the door quickly, hurrying along the corridor.
Suddenly, the Great Hall is in chaos, noise, and voices of people moving in all directions. Harry makes his way to McGonagall. Led by Filch Slytherin students obscure Harry from my view. I step aside, angling through the crowd in his direction.
I struggle to breathe, I don't want to breathe ever again, and surety is spreading through me like terror. Because he doesn't agree, he refuses, he
"He's pouring her pumpkin juice."
"Dunno."
~ How?
“Hi,” Malfoy says carefully.
Their faces are grim and dirty, a lot of them are crying, but seeing me, faint smiles break on their faces. Each one of them. They wave and cheer and greet me, as though I'm some bloody hero. I don't know why they think I deserve it. So many people died because of me.
"Malfoy."
"Cinnamon."
"Is true."
Firm hands grip my arms, wrap around my shoulders, firm hands are closing around my chest, pulling me up and up to the surface, letting me breathe again. Breathe fire and pain and memories.
"No. Whatever it is, Malfoy, we are going to Dumbledore. Now," Potter says wearily and adjusts his glasses.
I start awake at dawn. It's as though someone has shaken me by the shoulder.
Severus grabs the tip of the wand pressing into his throat, wrenches it out of Bella's grip, and throws it on the floor. The wand clatters, rolling over the marble, and with a shriek, Bella dives after it.
"Holy shit," Weasley says somewhere.
," I nod at the folder, feeling oddly warm in the face. His praise makes me feel weird. Good and weird at the same time.
I pour him whole – as I know him - into the music... I am surprised at how easily, how swiftly it comes, rushing up like tears - but those are happy ones - flowing without effort... At the same time, I'm not surprised at all. When my fingers finally stop, the melody fading, I look up.
The words hit me as soon as I switch the radio on and adjust to the broadcast.
"You play well," he says, "I didn't know."
I follow his movements around the field. The Bludger is deflected by Goyle, and Nott, now out of danger, dives directly onto Seamus below, snatching the Quaffle out of his hand.
“Take your clothes off.” He says, and there’s a sound of him unfastening the buckles of his gloves, a rustle of fabric discarded.
"The old man has lived long enough." Bellatrix turns her head to look at him, her poise never wavers. Her wrist twists in a tiny movement for a better grip.
That I'm pretending not to be
"What is it?" I ask. "What's in there?"
All this, all
"I..."
It's only when his lips are hot on mine again, when I’m drowning in the kiss - as an afterthought - I realise what he's just said.
"Acknowledge how?"
and also there's something else. Fascination? I'm not sure. If I could ask him to stop, to stay still for a second, so that I might figure out what it is... But I can't, and it's a brief moment only. Our gazes part, he turns away.
Do I trust him?
At the Manor, I kept it with me all the time but never dared to use it. I didn't know where Harry might be and whether my arrival would do him more harm than good; and anyway, my parents would be punished for my escape - I couldn't let that happen. Now, all I have to do is clutch the coin in my palm, think of Harry and Apparate. So I do, expecting a tug and a swirl, bracing myself for the unsettling disorientation and vertigo that always come with Apparition.
There's a knock on the door.
As long as this thing is around your wrist, your Father knows your whereabouts. As long as the bracelet is there, you are as good as a Squib.
I look down at Malfoy. I did, I promised. Did I have a choice? There's no time for that right now. I bend over Malfoy and grab his ankles. Though skinny, the bastard is heavy as fuck, and I barely manage to move him at first. My hands are shaking.
"Yeah," he says, and I move to lie next to him, my breath evening out.
, Ron.” I rummage over the table, gathering my parchment and stuffing it into the bag.
I don't understand.
He looks up. "You draw very well, I like it... thank you for... taking your time."
"Really?" I laugh. Who would’ve thought that I gave Malfoy that impression?
"Come
He doesn't reply.
"I don't know," he says, "I don't have one." When I ask him about his Patronus. "I never succeed. Not that I tried too hard."
I wrapped my hand around it. "Are you complaining or what?"
that drives you bonkers," Malfoy sneers, all the softness gone from his face, "the thing that turns you into a fucking
In shock, I gaped at him like a fish. "Sir?"
I am still not sure if it was alright. I fucked it up, I hurt him. I did. But he insisted, urging me on, whispering that he wanted me
~ Why?
"How much?"
Potter.
I probably do. I'm just not sure if I'm ready to deal with it at the moment.
I won't break down here; I owe that to my parents.
Head bowed, Henry walks down the dais, heading to his chair. Passing, he throws you a brief glance.
I smile at him over my cup. If someone told me before that this Christmas I'd find myself dating
Tears rush up so swiftly that I barely manage to cover my face before my eyes start stinging. I bite into my lip to stifle a sob. It doesn't help.
A stinging pain slashes at my chest, and my blood gushes hot. There's so much blood and there'll be more, I know. I've been here before. There'll be blood enough to drown the bloody Great Hall... there'll be blood and blood and blood on the floor until nothing will remain in me.
For a moment, we stared at each other. You tried to throw my hand off. I dug my thumb into your collarbone and didn't let go.
Go away."
I adjust my glasses.
"I..." I say, "I'm... I need some air."
That's exactly what I'd been going to do, but put like that his words piss me off.
"I love you, Ron," I whisper into his shoulder. My eyes burn - just a little - I won't cry. "Thank you."
“How much time do I have?”
, and it does - allowing me in. I've been granted a single room, and McGonagall has done everything to make my accommodations comfortable. I can’t -
"We are going to behave as though it doesn't matter, because it doesn't, and forget the whole thing. Then they'll leave us alone. Agreed?"
"Vernon Dudley was with them, a man of the Order."
I am alright - as much as I can be.
"Yeah." I hastily dropped your hand to dust my trousers off.
"But… it happened a month ago," said Hermione. "Harry was perfectly okay until this morning."
Potter snaps, "and, besides, I am bound to protect his life anyway. I need a place to hide and keep him, once we leave Hogwarts."
"Kreacher!" I call loudly.
"Hermione knows shit," Weasley had told me after the first day in court, "just listen to her and do what you are told...
"Malfoy?" the voice whispers loudly, and the light flickers alive at the tip of a wand.
He grabs my elbow, breathing heavily from the run. "We'll sort it out."
he insists, and I… I don't bloody know. Hogwarts is as good a place as any, I just trudge on.
you think but hope that he doesn't,
"I'm sorry." I'm an idiot, I thought. How could I ever doubt Ron?
“I was.” I was.
"Nice jewellery."
"It's his plan... it's his plan," I repeat over and over, "it's his plan." Until my voice drowns in tears that choke me.
"You already have."
"Truth?" She repeats.
“The Vanishing cabinet must be destroyed now?" I asked Dumbledore a week ago. That night when Potter dragged me to him and everything changed.
Food is scarce. We've already run out of the stock of bread, hard cheese, biscuits, and apples Granger had in her beaded bag. We tried to pick berries and mushrooms in the forest, but none of us is an expert. For two days now, we've been living on tea with plenty of sugar that we found among the supplies of the tent.
or what? I don't know... but we are
"Now, your turn!" She says, pressing the bottle into my hand.
Cursing, you hurled the thing against the wardrobe. Rage welled up within you, sniffing out the first shock of betrayal. You wanted to break something. To lay your hands on his throat and squeeze until his eyes bulged.
His face is so close. Exactly as I've been imagining it only a moment ago.
I turn.
"How do you know?"
"Mr. Potter, I assure you--"
I had started it. He was reluctant and withdrawn and not at all enthusiastic about it, keeping his distance, as though always on his guard, .
I spring on my feet and dash out of the room. Hurrying along the corridor, I hear noise and commotion, the sound of hundreds of feet running. I follow them - up, out of the dungeons, up the staircase and into the Entrance Hall. The double doors of the Great Hall are wide open and people flood inside. I follow them.
I'm pretty sure he ignores her. I imagine his arrogant face, the way he glances at her down his nose, turning away to pour himself tea in the most stuck-up manner.
"Well, yes? Why would I do that otherwise?"
"Well, fuck you, Harry, but I'm taking you to the castle."
"Six out there," he says, "the seventh one is the remaining part that's still inside him. The two are already destroyed, four to go. Including the locket."
He puts his arm over my shoulders, steering me to the side, through the mob of people, until we stop. He takes my hand, putting it on the bannisters.
Someone sobs - to my right and left. Everywhere.
"The Room of Requirement," he whispers back. "You must not be seen."
"My place." He finally moves to sit down by the bed. And I stare into the specky face of Harry
perversion imaginable." Your Father's cane against the flagstones measured his pace around the study.
— I don't know. Give me another one.
Instantly, applause explodes around the room.
“I’m here,” he says, and his footsteps crunch in my direction until he finally touches my sleeve.
His presence makes me uneasy for some reason. Flare of anger and annoyance is not new to me, but there's something else...
on its front, perching on the narrow windowsill of the owlery.
I knew then, that what had just happened was more than our pleasure, more than what I thought at first it was. For me it was more.
"You mean..." Weasley's eyes grow round as saucers when realisation finally hits him. "Bloody hell, Harry!" He says, scandalised. "But
"Stay where you are, or I'll tear you bloody." Hatred coils hot in my guts.

"No."
On the pale-grey face, his eyes are dead. In the sheen of obsidian, they are not even green, they are not
Now, I am unwrapping a tiny package that the owl dropped in my palms. It's the size of a jewellery box.
My moan wakes me up. To the darkness before my eyes.
Malfoy steps in front of Dumbledore, holding him at the wand point.
He is rude and makes me grunt in pain. "Get
"Silence!" Snape's voice rings around the Great Hall, and the giant double doors slams shut with a deafening
Surely not…

"Okay,” he says carefully. “I'll start a fire, then?" He moves around the room. "Would you mind?"
"Number 12, Grimmauld Place." I read silently and watch how the walls of the numbers 11 and 13 slide aside, revealing the porch and the windows... and Kreacher, standing by the front door.
but he withdraws, and I don't know how to ask for it; I doubt I would even if I did.
I didn't argue. For the first time, I didn't. My fingers slipped between your arse cheeks, finding their way into your body, loosening you, slickening you up.
My heart gives a thud, I put my glass down and scramble to my feet, taking a few tentative steps forward. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now… A hand takes mine, pulling me close, there's a nice floral scent, a warm palm on my neck, the softness of skin against my jaw when our lips meet, her breath tastes of mint candies, her hair catches in my stubble, my hands wrap around her waist, pulling her closer, pressing her flush against my body…our tongues meet, my pulse is erratic in my throat…
“Yeah?!” I pull the blanket up to my chin. “Come in!”
Harry's cause lives deep in us! In all of us! It's not over!"
“Why?”
side, I don't think I truly belong to one or the other. I just want all this to end. But I promised Harry; the last thing I said to him was that I was on his side. So as soon as I descended from the seventh floor into this hell, I knew that I'd do everything in my power to help Harry's side win.
I need to talk to you."
Sliding my fingers into his hair, I press into his scalp, throwing my head back.
Potter recoiled as if burnt.
It seems that time has stopped, and we are suspended in the moment forever. He is my anchor, and I am floating, and the flood will never end.
"What?" I turn around to face him.
We are in the deserted section of the library, though you never know who may spy on you, lurking behind the shelves. Just like he's been doing for a week.
It was different now, certainty made me bold. I cradled your face and kissed you, long and lingering, trying to tell you everything I withheld with words. I knew you wouldn't be going anywhere.
"Well..." Potter shrugs.
"Fuck you!" He doesn't disappoint.
you idiot," Mother hisses.
"Don’t touch me!"
to the bowing elves, and hurry right back, levitating the tray behind.
"Home. I can't stay here for the night."
"Fine!" There's a sound of the opening door. "Go back, then, and snog to your heart's content. Why don't you?" The door closes.
"Harry? What is it?" Hermione asks, and I realise I've been staring into space for too long.
“I know what harmony is. You sound like a
"Fuck me..." a voice says into the quiet.
"You don't know?" Gin raises her voice. "This is for Harry. Ask your

"And you
- Harry loved. He did. He probably still does.
There, by the wall...
“Let’s go?” He offers. “It’s getting late.”
"Verbal and physical contact (within limits of modesty) between patients of the opposite sex is encouraged."
He splayed his palms over my arse.
I shake it. "Thanks."
Sunbeams in his hair.
Next morning, I walk the grounds alone. I visit Hagrid and stroll along the Lake and sit in our spot, and everything's fine, really.
"What does Dumbledore say?" I ask his back.
I bend down and press my lips to his shoulder blade, to his unyielding back. My arms slide around his sides to touch his stomach, to feel coarse hair below his navel. I turn him around to face me.
“Enough!” I howl, finding myself on my back in the snow as he straddles me, pinning my hands above my head. “Malfoy!
I am alone in the darkness.
"SEVEN?" I feel sick.
Blue jade flashed among his things on the hangers when you opened the wardrobe.
"Draco!"
We are no more.
"Your vials, Master." His fingers close around my hand, turning it upwards as he presses two tiny cold-glass things into my palm.
There is a noise from the Entrance Hall, a flood of voices and a shuffling of footsteps, and they are finally here.
"It's my job," he says, heading to the door, "we'll talk tomorrow."
Harry raised his eyebrows in question.
We are both breathless.
Horror grips me, I fall on my knees.
Weasley!" I order. The wand in my hand shakes. "The
"Why not?" My fingers traced the line down your forearm, to the inside of your wrist.
Potter turns to stare at him. He's been sitting motionless all this time, giving the impression that he isn't listening. Now, by his rigid posture, I realise that he is poised to lash out any second.
Potter’s arm wraps around me, his breath warm at my nape. "Sorry," he whispers, "may I?... I'm... I'm so cold." He shivers. I feel his hand snake under the hem of my sweater, palm splaying cold against my stomach. My heart gives a jolt. "It's freezing," he whispers.
"Leave. Me. The. Fuck. Alone." You measured your words.
And...
They shut themselves in the kitchen, often summon Kreacher, and talk, talk, talk. Whisper when I'm around, giving each other signs. Fall silent whenever I so much as glance in their direction. Cryptic conversations:
The bed dips under his weight as he finally comes. I shuffle to the side, leaving him more space.
"There's no trick." He looks me in the eyes, paying her no attention. "Only my will and my desire to serve My Lord."
"Then
I’m scared, so fucking scared. Too late. There’s only him, me, and the sky. The wind, the cold, my head spinning, the breath knocked out of my lungs, the nothingness of it around, and the vertigo of the height speeding up. I’m scared out of my mind, his body against mine the only thing real in the dark.
She takes my hand in hers. "I still can't believe you are here. For almost a

sort of thing. There are things I've never told them, things I cannot imagine us discussing. Things I tell Noir.
I reached around you again to touch the handles with my fingertips, and the motorbike rumbled alive.
"Come, Severus." I beckon. "Come to your Master and be rewarded." I rise from the high chair and step down off the dais.
I'm not all right; after what had happened two days ago, I am most certainly
"Yes." The conversation made me sort of uncomfortable, but since I was already dosed, I didn't care that much.
Champagne in slender flutes. Is shining.
"I thought, that you'd want to be left alone, so..."
There on the pillow next to him is a piece of parchment, he picks it up.
"I only did my job," Potter replies, "and anyway, I owe you a Life Debt."
"What?" You repeat.
Lost for words, I stare at him. Never in my life did I imagine that it may come to
"Forgive me, my Lord, my wife is unwell," Lucius says, and I see a prone form on the floor.
"I will not berate you, my boy, for I am sure the burden of guilt you carry weighs heavily upon you even without my rebuke."
or my needs or the ways to help me, or people's attempts to walk on eggshells around me. So what if it's Malfoy? At least he doesn't behave as though I might break.
His footsteps retreat. I take a step forward, my feet tripping over the damned bottle.
"Nevermind. I'm not going to sign up for some stupid idea of yours, for some pathetic bullshit you're doing out of pity!"
"No problem." I shrug, as though he was thanking me for a spare apple or... something silly.
I am an idiot.
I sprang on my feet.
He stops in front of me. "
Harry looks up at me and makes a face and then laughs bitterly, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Believe me, we ask ourselves the very same question every day since he died and all hell broke loose."
I will touch a key on the piano, pressing it gently with a lonely sound. And another one. It will feel as though the air shifts, the house around me giving a sigh - of tenderness and longing. I will press another key, listening to the lonely note ringing high in my empty heart - a reminder that
Pomfrey's face appears.
I smile into his stomach, moving down to nuzzle a path down his belly.
"I'm still here," he said above me.
"I don't know," Jared says after a long silence, "I have nothing to tell."
stupid. I hate it.
After classes, I stick to Ron. We no longer hang out with Malfoy in my room in the evenings. My wireless is silent. My Patronus is weak. The other day, when Hermione told me she saw Malfoy with Astoria Greengrass, sitting in the library for the entire evening, I couldn't cast it at all.
I don't mind.

"The sword of Gryffindor. We need it to destroy the locket and the other Horcruxes."
I don't know what I'm doing,
"Do you think I'll be able to read books?"
When Malfoy finally speaks, his voice is quiet, measured. Pissed off.
"Then
Opening the Common Room door, I bump face-to-face with Seamus.
He says loudly to the ceiling. "
just before he drew my blood. Then something shifts in Potter's face, as though a storm passes aside.
He doesn't say all this, but we both know he means it, saying instead: "Are you going to waste this weather?"
"Harry?" He caught up with you on the street.
"Hermione, I need your help to figure it out. I can't leave him wandering around unprotected. Dumbledore said if something happened to him, I'd die."
He nodded and cautiously offered his hand. I took it, giving him a brief handshake. We'd never be friends, but I really wanted to close this thing between us and never return to it again.
I guess. My
"Oh, fuck off!" I'd laugh and poke you in the stomach. "I'm tired. It's the middle of the night."
I know he meant nothing like that, nothing like that
He appears again in the doorway.
I know, I barely have any time left. I am skilled in this, but Potter is powerful; unless I am swift enough, he'll wreck my mind beyond repair.
She's mocking me, but there's no bite to it, and her eyes are kind.
How am I? I don't know. I'm not sure what exactly he's asking.
On weekends, we trudge through the snow to our spot by the Lake, the whiteness of it almost hurtful to my eyes. It takes more than a month, and we are well into December, when one bright afternoon, he finally succeeds.
"Potter?"
He cringes. "Do what?"
To finally
"Yes." He batted it away and gripped his cock. "Come on."
His hand slides up my neck and into my hair, fingers caressing my scalp. "Your hair is long," he murmurs. "I like it."
"Now is the time to declare yourself." The Dark Lord raises his voice, and the cheers die down. "Come forward, and join us... Or die."
"What?" I utter, feeling hot in the face.
"Did he tell you that?"
"It has made all the difference in the world, my boy." He turns to face me. "However, there is more to it."
I roll my eyes. "How do you know?" I don't need empty words to cheer me up.
Slowly we  trudge across the pitch.
Days pass, we move, wary of staying in the same spot for more than a day, lest someone's eye may break through the protective spells. It is unclear, whether they hold as expected, so better not to take chances.

“Yes, you are.” He moves his shoe away from my foot.
“Okay, good.” He grabs my hand again, squeezing it between the ridged leather of the gauntlet. “Come on.”
There is no lack of food, though I barely eat. The elf brings it and takes it away thrice a day.
"What am I supposed to do, Potter? Kill them?"
He looks at me. "No, you were right."
"I thought... I thought that Dumbledore knew everything."
He doesn't reply and turns away. I angle to the side at the very back of the crowd.
“Like this.” I am giving him back all the kisses I had stolen in my dreams.
Potter," the woman corrected herself, mirroring his posture.
So I touched his hand briefly
“My house. Come on, get dressed.”
"You know--" He begins. "I mean… I could ask Astoria, surely--"
"Vernon Dudley," I reply, surprising myself with how smoothly it comes out.
I skimmed my fingertips over the parchment, pressing them into another spot, I realised I could discern written lines on the surface, they felt warm to the touch.
read the brief note his owl delivered when you were waiting for him for dinner.
You didn't reply, and the silence stretched on, making me turn and look at you. There was this brief stricken expression on your face, but it was gone before I even realised it was there. Your face set, you nodded and headed to the door.
When I open my eyes on Sunday morning to his knock on my door and let him in, I suddenly see his vague shape moving in front of me, approaching through the blur.
My hand will reach out… and drop useless, a mere inch from yours.
They told me in St. Mungo's that only a tiny percent of blind people are actually fully blind. That most of them are still able to tell light from darkness, discern shapes and movement and even colours around them.
“It’s the same.” I feel awkward, but still don't resist.
"Quickly!" Goyle commands. "They've entered that fucking Room, I saw them. Potter and his friends." He sprints all the remaining distance to the door and catches the door handle.
"Malfoy's a lucky bastard," someone says down the table.
No, I don't know where Harry is, or where exactly should I go to find him, but the coin urges me to move, and I obey, certain that it will lead me straight to him. I clutch it in my palm and hurry all the way back, peering cautiously around the corners every time I have to take a turn. When I finally climb the staircase up to the Entrance Hall, the noise reaches me: a loud crash and sounds of fighting, shouts and firing curses. I peer out of the hallway and see a familiar Death Eater whose name I can't remember fighting with one of the Weasley twins. Professor Sinistra is attacking a masked woman. Finnigan slashes the air, sending curses at Greyback. I crawl along the wall behind the pillars of the Entrance Hall until I reach the main staircase. Up, up, up, hurry-hurry, I leap three steps at a time, stumbling, almost falling. I hit my kneecap on the marble step and whine at the sharp pain, scramble to my feet and sprint up-up-up the steps, higher and higher, leaving the noise of the battle behind. I fly past the first landing and the second, and even the third. I don't know where the coin is leading me, but I'm sure I'm heading the right way. On the seventh floor, I grip the bannisters and stop to catch my breath. I look down... all the way down to the pit of the Entrance Hall, and my head swims. I step back and turn around and realise I've reached my destination because I see Harry's back far ahead. He is running, running for his life, with Weasley and Granger in tow. I dash after them, faster, faster, and it finally strikes me that he is heading to the Room of Requirement. There, far ahead, is the blank wall with that damned tapestry, and Harry has almost reached it.
"Er, I'm..." It's fucking humiliating. "I'll go change." I begin to pull it over my head.
“I’m cold,” I say, my teeth chattering. “That’s all.”
Since when have I stopped trusting her?
"Where did you get this?" I say.
I'm shaking, I'm so cold. "Forgive me," I whisper.

What happens next, I don't quite remember. I come to my senses into the bright light of the room, holding
"Potter."
"If you won't offer a chair to your visitor, let your friend suffer." The woman did have the nerve!
He sits up. "Come here." His hand is in my hair.
I squeeze my eyes shut, feeling as Mother pulls back.
"Come on, guys, that’s enough!" Zabini shouts. "That was smoking hot."
“Kreacher serves,” the elf croaks behind my back.
I take him by the arm, and we wade up to the castle. Only then does a sudden memory strike me. Well, not a memory - but rather a dream…
"Shhh." You tucked her head under your chin and stroked her hair. "It's okay." You didn't know what you were saying. It was not okay, and you yourself needed a good cry. "It's all right."
"Harry." There's a plea in his eyes, but his voice is steady. He isn't afraid of you.
It takes ages to finally get to the Hospital Wing.
"No, I overheard them talking the other day."
Slowly, I walk all the way back to the Pomfrey's door. Opening it, I peer inside. Already clothed, Malfoy is standing with his back to me. Pomfrey hands him a vial. I close the door and lean against the wall.
He says nothing.
Bellatrix turns. "Severusss..."
So when I open it for the hundredth time and see the note inside, my hand is already closing it by the force of habit.
This is happiness. This.
The man withdrew his hand, the band on his wrist catching the lights in a flick of the white metallic sheen.
"... newly…"
"Harry, come
Potter says nothing. I reach down and cup some water in my palms to wash my face. And again. A stray hiccup or sob jerks me now and then. I scramble to my feet and Potter follows. Water slurps in my boots.
"I won't tell you…" There's a sound of him fumbling with something over there - a click, and a creak, like a lid opening, and then… music fills the air - a bright, uplifting tune. It beats and sways and swirls around, making me want to rock and bounce along with it.
Dumbledore sighs. "Hear me out, Harry."
He releases me. "Sorry."
he has shown me..." He slammed his palm at the desk, making you jump.
"My Lord, he is lying. He deceived Narcissa, and now he is deceiving you."
He doesn't reply, and for a moment I think he's gone.
I pray to some unknown power, repeating the words over and over.
he said he wouldn’t. I turn my head, and my vision blurs; there are a lot of people here. The Entire Eighth year. The task is impossible to remember and count them all; I'm too tipsy.
"Er... okay, fine..." Potter says, while I scramble on my feet.

"It's not a
"Good." He nods.
When I finally put it on, I feel better having it on me again and at the same time, I feel even worse. Rage overcomes me; anger I haven't felt before. Well... I probably have – yesterday - when Ron told me that I have no family.
Slowly, he responds, and his lips are so tender. I'm dying... this is too much... I have to breathe. I tilt his head back.
I have to pick another one
"Very clever," I agree. "But if

“What was that?” I ask.
for fuck's sake! Making it all about himself and then disappearing out of spite, just to alert everyone. You're such an attention whore."
It's been three weeks, but I feel as though I've known him for ages. As though he's always been there within my reach. What had I been doing before he appeared? I hardly remember. How had I lived without anyone to talk to?
"I'm gonna…" I gasped… and came.
Paralised, I can't breathe.
I look down at Malfoy's dead wide eyes staring at the ceiling; at his face frozen in surprise; at his wand, still pointing up.
Fair enough, and I do understand him, sure. It’s just every time I think of Ron - up there, without me - I feel sick.
"I grew up in a good family, but my sinful nature took hold of me in my teenage years, making me stray away from God."
[14] – dialogue between Argus Filch and Minerva McGonnagal, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”, Part 2.
"Wait." His shoulder briefly brushes mine as he steps around me. "Wait," he repeats from behind, and his hands cover my eyes. "Is there any difference?"
Ron and Hermione had been at dinner still, and I won't deny, I’d left as soon as I could, hurrying to the dorm, hoping for something... I don't know what. Something like
"There's still time till June," I shrug. This chat suddenly takes my good mood away.
"Yes, truth instead of dare."
"How do you know?" I mean, really... Not even an hour has passed since the meeting with my Mother.
She and Weasley visited Grimmauld the evening after my breakdown and shut themselves in the library with Potter. They'd brought a Pensieve. I went to my room.
"Really, no." I snatch my hand away. "I can bloody well manage on my own."
"Neville Longbottom."
Your eyes snapped open to land on Theo in the doorway. His smile was knowing, and his bathrobe was open in the middle. He pushed himself off the doorframe.
Probably a shitty day at work, I think. I stand up, following him to the kitchen. I feel uneasy.
You had been going on like this ever since. Even now, three months later. One moment you'd be good and calm, and the next something would trigger a vivid flash of memory, bringing all your anger and self-hatred to the surface.
The spell hits right above his head, shattering the mirror door of the old wardrobe.
"What's the point of swimming in your pants and then having to dry them?" Potter says behind my back as I cast a drying spell over myself and quickly tug my long-sleeved t-shirt on to cover my arms. Only then do I turn to him. He pulls the chain with the locket over his head and hangs it on a tree branch. Not waiting for my reply, he walks into the water and dives.
on your lips and not feel butterflies in my stomach.
Potter enters. He looks better than when I last saw him, I give him that. Behind him, I see Granger's bushy hair and Weasel's red mop.
too," he says quietly, "but now you don't. And I don't know how to speak to you either. I shouldn't have given you any hints, because whatever happens, it's not going to be the same."
"Of course you can," I say instead and squeeze his hand.
"Can't you have it with me?" I threw over my shoulder. "Not with your fucking books. Why the hell even come here if you ignore me in my own house?"
"Look…" He hesitates. "May I come in?"
Chapter 1
Lost for words, I gape at her.
"I want to touch you," he says.
"Snape?" I blurt.
I tuck the band between my teeth and card my fingers through his hair. Wavy and thick, it is a bit longer than mine. I like the way the sunlight brings out the gold in it. I smooth it back from his forehead and temples, gathering it up from his nape into a tiny ponytail and tie it with a band.
"Fuck…"
I go to the bathroom to stare at myself in the mirror. I look like shit. I'd almost ceased to eat since the hearing began. It's been three weeks, and I look like a skeleton.
“Hi,” I reply, hoping that they won’t sit with us.
"How do you know?" I open the lid.
My insides turn to lead. "I must save his life if need be?"
His blond hair was golden rather than the odd platinum shade I've never seen in anyone but… I shook myself.
"I didn't think of it at all!" I bite at his shoulder, and he hisses but doesn’t pull away.
"I'm sorry. I should've listened to you when you didn't want to go there." He shuffles towards me on his knees. "I almost got us killed."
"What do you think will happen?" Potter asks.
And Theo came forward in his open bathrobe to hit me across the face.
speaks inside my head.
"Blaise and Pansy."
“No...” He pauses. “Have you?”
There's a dull sound of something hitting the floor and the crowd parts around Lucius.
Potter looks away, his face stony. What's the matter with him?
I peer at the bundle in Hagrid's arms. It's not a... it's not a bundle,
"No," I reply.
I drop to my knees, and the wall sways to hit my head. I hardly feel the pain, it's nothing, nothing compared to the one tearing me from the inside. I howl, and people stare. It means nothing to me, they mean nothing. I howl and weep, and will never stop.
