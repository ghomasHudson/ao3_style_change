On a cool autumn morning, Draco frowned all the way from his cottage to the bookshop. He shoved his key in the door to unlock it. He jabbed his wand at the coffee maker to get a pot started. He slashed his wand around wildly, casting his usual battery of cleaning spells and spilling the first cup of coffee into his mug. After throwing his wand into the drawer and ripping the curtains aside, he snatched his mug and sat down in the rear corner nook to stare at the river.
Here, it was dark as well, but planets hung throughout the room, casting a dim light on everything.
He changed into his pyjamas and brushed his teeth, then sank into bed with his book.
"Try to move us towards the edge. This way we can get out of here quickly."
"Really," he said. He settled into his chair behind the counter.
Just when he’d decided to kiss Draco, the hands on his back swiftly dropped down to his hips and held him steady.
His legs began moving. He had to get out of sight. He had to forget about that smile.
"I—I'm not sure what you mean."
And that was it. Draco didn't want it to be a facade. He wanted it to be real. A sudden swell of panic forced him to take several deep breaths.
And then Draco remembered that everything was, in fact, very wrong.
No. He decided he'd buy one the next day - the day before Draco's birthday. He had to go shopping for his gift anyhow.
More pieces of the puzzle, but still, not all of them fit into place.
It took a moment for Draco to register his words. He nodded and watched Potter undo and pull down his trousers and pants in one smooth motion. He was hard already.
Draco rolled his eyes. He stood leaning against the wall, as far away from Pierce as possible. "Tell them," he said. "Tell them what you intended to do tonight."
"You look terrible," Potter said.
"Not hating someone isn't the same as liking them," Draco said. Potter, of all people, should know that.
"Told you he knows magic," Anne said. She rubbed Jeremy's arm.
It wasn't as though Draco had a choice. He folded his arms and leant back in his chair. "Just tell me how the investigation is going."
Draco took the cake and frowned when he noticed Emily craning her neck to get a better look inside.
Then there were the Muggles themselves.
Potter waved. "Believe what you want. I was safe, though."
"Just shut up and put your hands on me! People are watching." He winced when Potter's hand brushed against his shoulder blade.
"What now?" Draco looked at Pierce's Stunned body. Even bloodied, he still had a punchable face.
"Can't or won't?" Draco said. There weren't many conclusions to draw, and none of them were good.
"Well," she said, placing her mug in the dirty dish container, "suit yourself, but he's a very charming young man." She flashed a smile at him and finally left.
“I quit Quidditch,” Harry hissed. “Because I needed to focus on my studies, and reading also helps me do that,so if you can leave me alone and mind your own fucking business I’d be grateful.” And with that he slipped his fingers out of his book -not caring about his progress anymore-, threw it on the couch and stormed upstairs.
Sirius barked a laugh at that. “So they finally figured it out, huh?” He said. “Took them long enough. What about you and Draco?”
Harry saw the healer twice a week and slowly, he began to feel better, but he was nowhere near over it. By the time June arrived, he was laughing and joking again, but he’d have his moments. When he went back to Grimmauld Place with Draco, Mrs.Malfoy and Remus, he’d asked to visit Sirius’s grave.
The hospital was decorated for the Holidays and he had to admit it gave the place a bit of a cheer. There was even a bit of mistletoe hung over in a corner and Harry pulled Draco there and kissed him hard. When they pulled back, breathless, Harry said. “I never answered you back then,” he said. “In November, when we, er, talked on the Quidditch stands.”
Sirius cast him a weak smile and pulled him in for a hug. “Sirius?” Harry asked against his godfather’s chest. Tears were welling up in his eyes and he was trying his best to blink them back. “You’ll be okay, right?”
Sirius pulled him in once again, and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “I don’t want you to-”
Potter crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame. "What are you doing here?"
"I'm not accustomed to doing this," Draco said. "Sorry if it's awkward."
"No thank you," she said, and she leaned back on the wall next to the coffee pot, watching it. "You know, I may be old, but I can't remember a time when you've been late to open," she said when he returned.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose as he inhaled, counting to five, then exhaled, counting to five. He wished he could die just then.
"Food will be here in half an hour. Talk."
"All right, all right, I'm going." He balled up the cloak and held it to his chest. "Wish me luck."
Potter continued. "I guess maybe it doesn't matter though. I didn't know you were with someone."
sleep on the sofa?" Draco was starting to feel desperate.
"Oh? You don't have a favourite constellation, even?"
He didn't even bother turning on the lights.
"Then it doesn't matter if I can, does it?"
"It's early."
"I know, I know." Potter rolled his eyes, but he smiled.
"No, which is another reason protecting Potter is a full-time job. All the Ministry safe houses are occupied at the moment, and we don't have time to set up another. You'll be assuming different identities and living somewhere else for the duration of the investigation."
He just didn't have the knack for this. But there wasn't much Draco could do these days, and if puzzles brought him some measure of satisfaction, then Harry was happy to join him.
"Perhaps you two had better wait in your cubicles whilst we finish here," Jennings said.
Draco didn't have to say anything after that, which was good, because only half-formed fragments of thoughts appeared in his head. The metal bed frame squeaked in concert with the slap of skin on skin as Harry thrust into him over and over, and Draco reached to wrap a hand around his cock.
An old, stained table was shoved into one corner with a wooden bench next to it. There were candles strewn about and nothing else.
Hmm. Probably not Pierce, then.
That was the thing he hated most.
"It's not as though we'll be able to argue whilst we're asleep," Potter said, shrugging.
Draco stepped away to grab the empty pastry tray. He thought of Potter's crushed face in his pocket.
die! My entire life's been turned upside down in the last twenty-four hours. And you're wondering what my problem is?"
Draco gave a smug smile. He looked irresistible in that damn jumper again. "Of course. This is a place of business, Potter. I have to think of my customers."
"You didn't answer the question."
"One of the letters I got yesterday was from Ron. He and Hermione have just had their first child."
Autumn was officially only a few days away, but the weather paid no mind to calendars. Saturday was bright, and the air was crisp and cool. Some trees in the area had already turned red and gold.
It wasn't fair, because Draco never caught Potter watching him.
Draco snorted. "I've never been on an assignment that required it."
Only after he heard the bedroom door shut did Draco move. He took his dishes to the sink, then sat on the sofa with his book and unwrapped the frog. He tried to take his time and savour it, but it was gone in moments.
"Pierce!" Jennings said.
"Talking's not going to help."
Draco wasn't about to argue with that. He no longer minded cooking, but he missed eating out.
doing here?"
He gulped the rest of his coffee and decided to pay another visit to MacDonald and Jennings. They sat in MacDonald's cubicle, huddled together in conversation, and they glared when Draco's shadow darkened the parchment they were discussing.
"It'll be fun." Potter pouted, and Draco had to look away.
Potter didn't even have to ask.
Harry sighed. "I don't want to believe it could be Pierce. And it's true, I don't think there's definitive proof. But it makes sense."
He kissed Potter deeply. "Ready?"
someone?" What on earth was he talking about?
Draco sat up, sloshing water around him. He shivered and hurried to get out, dry off, and finish preparing for bed.
Harry picked up a jar of some thick blue potion and shook it. He wondered what would happen if he just shut the door and took all of them himself. The idea was very tempting.
A short, frail-looking old woman in a spotted dress smiled up at Draco over a cake. Soft grey curls poked out from underneath her hat.
Lawrence received an anonymous tip the day before the explosion about the case they were working on, and he and Potter had gone to the location specified in the tip. Only the supposed meeting they were going to spy on never took place. Someone had planted an explosive potion there instead. Someone who never intended for a clandestine meeting to take place.
"Once more," Potter said. "We've got to be missing something." He doused his chips in vinegar. Around them, the buzz of chatter from villagers filled the dim pub. There were still twenty minutes until the quiz would begin.
"Not… Recently." Before Potter could accuse him of lying, Draco said, "What are you going to do once we return?"
Draco knew that sound. Someone had Apparated.
Some meals were easier than others.
"Nobody said anything about taking turns," Draco said.
Harry nipped at his ear and directed them towards the bed.
Potter continued. "You know we'll be returning, right? Just get one flavour now, and try another next time."
As the week passed though, Draco noticed a frightening increase in the amount of time spent with Muggles.
"I reckon we see who that is."
Unfortunately, it was practical for travelling since they couldn't Apparate.
Lewis poured himself another glass of wine, sloshing a few drops onto the table. "Well, I'm interested in your perspective." He gave an encouraging smile. "Besides, I don't see her terribly often. You must have loads of stories."
While the coffee brewed, Harry started a fire and shoved his papers and notebooks on the dining table to the side. On the table, he set out some milk, toast, butter, and jam. Mrs. Wilder sat on the sofa and pulled out a magazine from her handbag. When he placed a carafe full of hot coffee on the table, she looked up and smiled.
Draco had looked at Potter's deed, of course. He was pleased to note that Potter lived on the opposite side of the village. Not that this meant much, since Cartmel only had a dozen streets. They ran into each other occasionally outside of the bookshop. Mostly, it was in the grocery shop. That could hardly be helped. It served as a sort of informal meeting space. Everybody went there, and so you were guaranteed to know everyone you ran into, which easily added an extra half-hour of time to the chore.
"I don't want to keep track of who sleeps where on a day-to-day basis. That's a pain in the arse I don't need."
"It poisons the blood." Draco looked down and saw that Potter's hands were also clasped together. "It's irreversible."
Draco sighed. "There's actually a lot more paperwork than you'd think."
Draco's heart clenched, and he gave a tight smile. Why was it so hard to just lie to Potter and kick him out? He reached for his own bag, and they left the shop. They'd part ways in just a moment anyhow, and Draco could head back to the shop to take his potions then.
“I know Voldemort marked you,” he said, and tried not to wince when Draco flinched at the name. “I know he expects you to do something, and I know it’s an impossible task.” He said and then repeated himself. “If you get help, then I will too.”
“Shouldn’t you be at dinner?” He asked, not looking at him.
“You have to eat,” said Draco.
“I don’t want to be a cool corpse in your memory,” he’d said, barely able to hide the wince of pain in his voice as he stroked Harry’s head. “Life is too short to be remembered like that.”
Harry sighed. And told him. He told him about how he’d been behaving at the beginning of the term, how Draco had been trying to get him to eat -he couldn’t see a way out of admitting that, and so what if he admitted it? Sirius was okay now, he can start eating again-, how he’d noticed Draco sneaking away quite a lot. How Draco had confronted him on the Quidditch stands and how he’d broken down. How he’d made a deal with Draco during Transfiguration, and how there really hadn’t been time for a relationship between all that. He also told him about the Half-Blood-Prince, about how Snape kept giving him detentions for no reason and how he had actually quit Quidditch.
Sirius looked at him for a moment, his expression dark, before nodding. “You won’t return there next summer,” he vowed, and Harry believed him.
Harry did as he told numbly, not really aware of anything. He nodded at the few people that gaped at his scar and he made a detour to pass Nevielle’s parents. Mrs.Longbottom was fascinated by some napkin while Mr.longbottom was tugging at his bedsheets.
"Do you have a due date?" He asked. "Do you know the gender yet? What will you name it? What gender do you want?"
Harry’s throat closed up on him, and he fought back tears as he tried to speak. “Don’t,” he said. “Don’t tell me you love me. Because that’s what he told me last time I saw him and look where it got him. I don’t want anyone to love me, okay? I don’t know how this summer would’ve gone if I hadn’t been sent back to the Dursleys, if I hadn't spent it with someone who hated me.”
Harry drew Regulus closer to him and took his lips between his. “You forget what his father was like.” He said softly and pressed another kiss to his cheek. “I think it reminds him too much of it.”
"Neither do I," agreed Regulus. "Maybe we can just get the papers signed and then tell everyone?"
“You’re managing?” Sirius said with a small smirk.
"So you're telling me you're jealous of a girl, Black?"
Harry grinned at him. “Does that mean they’ll release you by Christmas?”
Harry and Dumbledore portkeyed to St.Mungo’s, attracting quite a few curious gazes as they walked through the lobby to the elevator. Harry didn’t heed them any attention as he pressed the button to the fourth floor -Spell Damage- and had to restrain himself from bolting out of the elevator when they arrived with a ding.
“Hey,” he said, sitting down with them. “What are you working on?
settled into their own corner, switching between cuddling, kissing and eating.
"By the chocolate fountain," said Blaise with a laugh. "And you can say she'd been busy. Come on, I'll take you."
“Come on Reg,” said Harry as he too got up, turning to his boyfriend with a sugar-laced smile. “You’re not even going to remember it by morning anyway.”
Draco sighed. “Fine, I’ll stay with you then.”
"You could've sent a letter." Said Regulus somewhat accusingly, but he was smiling.
“Of course not,” Sirius laughed. “Come on,” he said. “Tell me everything.”
“What?” Harry turned to look at him, causing him to let go of their embrace. “No! Go see your mum! If she doesn’t see you she’ll start to think the Order is keeping you away from her.”
“I love you too,” said Draco with a small grin and with that he left.
“Oh yeah? And tell them what, ‘Harry missed a meal’?”
"Enjoyed yourself, Harry?" Sirius asked Harry, his voice lacking no affection as the carriage pulled up - apparently Sirius had taken a potion so he wouldn't get drunk from the shots, Draco had said Regulus could do that next time, but Regulus had rolled his eyes, muttering about it taking the fun out of it.
He had stopped Harry during the explanation a few times to interrogate him about his eating habits, and wouldn’t let Harry continue with anything until he promised to start eating again, to ask for help when he needed it.
Dumbledore shook his head and stepped back. “No Harry,” he said. “I believe you two deserve some time alone, I’ll wait here for a bit before talking to Sirius myself, and I’ll come pick you up after dinner time.”
“I don’t understand,” he said.
Two weeks before Christmas break, Draco came up to Harry in the library when he was finishing a DADA essay for Snape. He sat down beside him and read Harry’s essay over his shoulder for a bit before speaking. “How do I get help?” He asked.
“I told you we’d talk about that, didn’t I?” Sirius said, and Harry nodded. “Well,” he said. “When Bellatrix hit me with that spell it pushed me through the veil as you know.” Harry nodded. “They’ve been slowly healing the damage caused by her curse and I’m completely cured of it now, hence my waking up.”
The three of them got off the carriage and it took off the instant they were a feet away from it. Regulus wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist, drawing him closer and stealing a peck on the lips. “What was that for?” Harry asked when Regulus pulled back, but he didn’t let go of his waist.
Tears rolled down Harry’s cheeks and he shook his head more vigorously. “I don’t believe you,” he repeated, his voice a strangled sob. “You’re lying.”
“Is that why you feel like a skeleton?”
“Harry-” Draco took a deep breath before starting again. “Do you have anywhere else to go?”
Harry leaned over Draco and enveloped his lips in his own. "Then it's Black to you from now on," he said softly as he pulled back.
He stepped back and looked at Sirius. “Are you okay?” He asked. “Should I call someone? I’ll go-”
Harry didn’t need to ask about what.
“Are you sure about this?” Asked Regulus, turning to his company. “I can name a few better ways to spend Christmas Eve.”
“Thank you for everything,” he murmured as tears fell down his cheeks. “You gave me a home, a family and love. I’ll never forget that Sirius, and will never forget you.” A son escaped him. “I hope you’re happy wherever you are, and I love you too.”
He knew it was low, but he couldn’t deal with both Grimmauld Place and eating.
Harry looked at his DADA book and nodded shortly. He’d known that Draco was going to call on him for it, knew that he was going to have to do it eventually, but that didn’t mean it would make it less scary when it happened.
“I care because I care about you, Harry.” Draco said. “I love you, okay? And not just as friends, I’m in love with you Harry Potter and if I can take all your pain for myself then I would. But I can’t, so I want to help you. I want you to allow me to help you,
When he emerged from surgery three hours later, he was barely conscious. They told them that he’d be lucky to remain like that till- till the end of the two weeks, that this was the best they could do to him. Harry had ended the night screaming into Remus’s chest.
Daphne gave him a sympathetic look and he wanted to turn away from it and run, run away from all those pitying, useless looks, run to where no one can find him, but then someone approached their table and he look up to see Draco approaching them, holding something wrapped in a napkin.
Spring brought warm weather, eventually, but harsh winds kept all the villagers tucked in their jumpers well into June. Draco especially found he was having more and more trouble keeping himself warm, and the heat in the city was a small relief when he Apparated back to London for his monthly appointments with Whitby.
Draco stood up. "Don't you think a fresh set of eyes—"
Inside, someone said something that caused the group to break into gales of laughter. Draco thought he caught his name in the bits of conversation seeping through the cracked windows.
Harry trailed his fingers through the water and lightly over Draco's hip, inching tantalisingly close to his half-hard cock. "You should."
Draco forced himself to smile. "What kept you?"
He grabbed hold of Draco's hips and began thrusting, slowly at first, until he found an angle that made Draco moan ceaselessly. It was incredible that any one person could make him feel this way, so complete and safe, and Draco couldn't get enough. He thrust back in time with Harry, encouraged by his moans of pleasure, and at one point Draco felt a hand reach around to grasp him.
"No."
Draco looked at himself in the window again. Not a hair was out of place, and his robes were immaculate. He looked perfect. So why did he feel as though something was wrong?
As mid-afternoon approached, he began to fidget in his seat. Eventually, he gave up pretending to read and sat staring out the window, to see when Potter might come strolling up the street.
Potter gave an awkward smile. "Erm, yeah."
"Except you don't," Jeremy said, as the last card revealed his third five. "Three of a kind beats two pair. Thanks for the tenner, mate."
"No."
Winter wended its way into the village slowly but surely, blanketing all the buildings and roads with a respectable amount of snow.
"But—"
"Well, perhaps you'll get landed with Barclay."
"Damn," he said.
Draco tossed the bottle back into the trolley and tried to ignore the tightness in his trousers.
Draco placed Potter's hand over the bulge in his trousers and looked up. Behind his smile, Potter wore a plaintive expression, and Draco thought he understood. He needed a distraction.
Potter nodded and withdrew his fingers. "Yeah. I've been thinking about this for a while, you know."
After a half-hour, Draco heard the soft click of the compartment unlocking. It was easier than he imagined to break into MacDonald's desk.
Draco picked up the stack of blankets from the counter and placed them underneath. "You forgot your blanket today."
Potter stared for a minute, frozen. His eyes had gone wide, and he looked curious. Intrigued. Possessive.
"Oh god, Harry, Harry, Harry..."
And with a content sigh, he burrowed his head deeper into the pillow, nestled closer to Harry, and fell back asleep.
"There won't
"There's been so little talk of Hallowe'en," Draco said as they drove home. "Don't Muggles celebrate?"
Potter was still laughing. "Here, it's easier if you take this out." He removed the glass tray from the microwave and tipped the remains of the exploded pie into the bin, then handed it to Draco for cleaning.
"Help me up?"
Draco didn't care. "Where's the file for the case you and Lawrence were working on?"
Hallowe'en dawned cool and cloudy, and the air felt alive with something magical. Ordinarily, Draco loved it, but today it only heightened his tension. It was fruitless trying to pretend he could focus on anything, so he was glad to accompany Harry to the last village meeting before the Bonfire Night celebration that weekend. Rosemary seemed tense herself as she went over her list to check and finalise all the plans.
"It's a little odd," Harry conceded. "But it could just be that—a coincidence."
The residual discomfort from taking his potions lasted for several more minutes after Draco regained control of himself, but he winced and sat up, locking the drawers and closing the box where he collected empty jars. Finally, he stood and exited quietly. When he pulled the key from the door and turned around, he nearly leapt in surprise.
climb up underneath the fabric of his jumper then.
Yes, that was what it was. Fondness, and some sense of camaraderie, though over what, Draco couldn't imagine. They shared nothing from their past; their experiences in the war differed vastly. He wanted to ask Potter what had changed, why he suddenly seemed to care. But he didn't want to know. Not really. That would only invite further discussion about Merlin-knew-what.
Draco scowled. "Remind me again which of us made that wrong turn?"
"You don't know anything about me."
. Fuck. He placed his hands on Draco's thighs, digging his fingers in. If only Draco would use a little more pressure, or move his hand just a bit faster. Harry thought he was going to die if he didn't come soon, and he shifted his hips a little underneath Draco, trying to thrust. It was impossible to tell which of them couldn't seem to stop moaning, not that it really mattered. He was so close. If only Draco would speed up just a little -
"Why are you fondling my cloak?" Potter asked.
"Finally, something I'm good for," Draco said.
Draco thought for a moment. "Have you got your wand?"
"Rough luck," Barbara said. "It's all right. We all had to learn not to play against him."
"Which will never happen since you never give me any of the good cases!"
"Oh yeah." Harry felt like an idiot. He watched Draco trace a finger in figure eights on the arm of the sofa, and a sharp pang of sadness reverberated in Harry's chest. He felt sorry for Draco. He wanted to reach out and wrap his arms around him. The silence was almost unbearable. He clutched his hands together tighter to keep from doing something stupid.
Robards groaned. "Why do you always insist upon quarrelling with me? Those are only guidelines. And I set those guidelines."
Of course, it wasn't as though he'd had many chances to practise his interrogation skills over the years. The fault lay entirely on Robards.
"Right."
"I'm Lister. I'm with the Muggle-Magical Relations Committee—"
Draco didn't need a dozen packages of biscuits, but he needed to do something with his hands. He plucked Jaffa Cakes, Hobnobs, custard creams, and Chocolate Bourbons from the shelves and added them all into the trolley.
"Sir, I apologise," Barclay said, "but my girlfriend's parents—"
He couldn't.
"Right," Harry said. Now that the moment had passed and he had regained control of his faculties, he let go of Draco. "Well, I guess you'll see me again tomorrow then." Hopefully, Draco understood that if he wanted to pick up where they'd left off, Harry certainly wouldn't complain.
The compartment clicked, and Draco sighed in relief.
"Which what?"
"It's funny," he said slowly. "I thought I would miss it."
"It's not as though you'll be doing anything else."
He didn't see anything either, except the bright blue sky above him turning black.
He gave her a small smile.
A loud crack from outside sounded, and he froze.
His heart pounded and his palms felt sweaty. He forced himself to glare back at them all.
Draco grunted and crossed his arms. He tried to listen, but he was hot, tired, and miserable.
Draco flopped onto his back and stretched. "I need to take my potions first."
"Pardon me?"
"You know I would. That's an edge." He took it from Harry and added it to the pile of other edge pieces. "I probably wouldn't be able to hide it from you anyway."
Silence.
Harry grinned. "Are you actually admitting you're wrong about something?"
Potter snorted. "Well, not
"I -" He had to take a deep breath before continuing. "No. He didn't reject me. He - he needs time. To think."
Potter gave him an odd look. "Just… Don't move." And he left.
Draco felt his face heat, and he broke their gaze to stare at a spot on the floor. "Just don't do it again."
"I'm going to the pub this evening," Potter said.
"Good afternoon," he mumbled.
Potter pursed his lips but seemed to think better of saying anything further. He sighed, then tossed a thick envelope across the table at Draco. "Here," he said. "It's all your Muggle identification, and some money."
"I just felt it would be wasted effort... you can't save a dying man. I made my peace with death a long time ago."
Draco took a deep breath, wondering how much he would regret this. "It's important I keep to my schedule. If you can wait after I close, then -"
"Let's get the coffee started first," she said, hanging her coat on a hook.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Potter, how many times have you helped me close the shop? We always use magic."
Someone making dinner for him was nice, he decided. It felt warm and comforting. It was a lot different from when a house-elf cooked for him.
The next morning, Draco awoke early again. It was barely light out, and he lay on his side to watch Potter sleep whilst drifting in and out of consciousness himself.
"Yeah, he was. They'd just got married a few months earlier, so he took it pretty badly," Harry said. "That's why he took some time off afterwards."
"What," said Draco. He had a book splayed open. Didn't he look busy?
"You've got to drive." Potter held out the car keys.
He finally stood and went to put on his shoes and jacket. He shut the door behind him with a soft click and locked it. His head leaned forward to rest against the worn wood.
was the one out of place.
Harry nodded. He remembered that. He had made peace with death once before as well, had walked willingly towards it.
Harry's face fell. He could feel his chin trembling. He blinked back hot tears and choked on his toast.
"No," Draco spat.
At the mention of Lawrence's name, an air of melancholy settled over the room.
Inside, Whitby took a seat while Draco prepared tea. He let Whiby drone on about this and that while they drank, until finally, both their cups were emptied. Whitby's gaze darted to the windows, making sure the curtains were drawn, before reaching into his bag and withdrawing his wand.
Dorothy's eyes widened. "Oh, is that how you two met? Risky, isn't it, to date someone you work with?"
But by the time knocking sounded on the front door, shaking him from his stupor, he was dry.
"I didn't say they do. I said there are a lot of people who
"Not any longer." Draco crossed his arms and averted his eyes. "My Healer said I can't."
"No."
Just his luck.
A strangled cry echoed above him, and his eyes wrenched open to see Harry with his bound hands thrown over Pierce's head, choking him. He shoved his weight against Pierce to topple him over, freeing Draco.
It wasn't until he crashed onto his knees that he realised he'd never given Robards his resignation letter.
? Who'd want to marry him?"
Draco began coughing, and Harry poked his head up. "Are you okay?"
"What are
Saying something would mean obliterating the professional bounds of this living arrangement and crossing the line into unfamiliar territory.
They came to a halt in the biscuit aisle.
"You, however," he said, turning towards Draco, "should let Mr Potter do most of the driving. Perhaps all of it."
As he should. Draco said nothing, because it was good to see Potter squirm.
A grin broke out over Potter's face. "Good, because I want to fuck you."
," Potter repeated. "They don't know where you are."
space. With any luck, it was just a singular occurrence, and Draco could continue to exist in peace.
Potter didn't pull away until he seemed certain Draco had finished. He dragged his lips around the head of Draco's cock and pressed a kiss to it before turning his gaze up and grinning.
"Don't be ridiculous."
"I think I'll die tonight," Draco said to the evening.
"Don't bother looking for your wand," Pierce continued. He pulled Draco's wand from his pocket and dangled it in the air.
Draco bought new boots in London after his December appointment at St. Mungo's. His Christmas gift from Whitby that year was a ban on caffeine, since it elevated his already-precarious heart rate. He made sure to buy the most expensive boots he could find from some Muggle shop. He had no desire to visit Diagon Alley. He hadn't been back since he'd been cursed.
He perked up at the sight of Draco. "Are you all right? What's happened?"
"You could've been killed!"
It was Thursday, and they'd just sat down to a dinner of Shepherd's pie. Steam rose from their plates, and Draco inhaled deeply.
When she caught sight of them she excused herself and came over to them, beaming. "Harry! Regulus!" She hugged them each in turn, as well as she could with a pregnant belly, before looking around. "Where's Draco?"
Harry snorted. “I’ve given up hope long ago, you shouldn’t hold on for my sake.”
He and Dumbledore walked through the hallways, making a few left then right turns before stopping in front of the room Harry knew was Sirius’s.
Daphne blushed. "Four months," she said. "But I didn't know till after Halloween."
"I thought you were planning your run away with Pansy," Harry said as Draco led them to a drink table -no alcohol.
“Are you sure about that book?” Daphne asked, giving said book a wary look. “It’s just strange, isn’t it? Someone went to the trouble of writing all these instructions and invented spells just to leave it lying around?”
“So?” Harry said blankly. “We can look for other healers, I’m sure they didn’t cover everyone.”
They each drew their invitations from their pockets and handed them to the footman. He examined them for a moment before he stepped back and bowed as they entered. The hall inside was a vast space that rather matched the outside appearance, occupied by refreshment tables and masked men and women greeting each other. There was soft music playing in the background but no one was dancing.
“And don’t get conveniently lost at the wine table,” said Draco to Regulus firmly, but he leaned in and pecked him on the lips all the same.
“I’ve just been playing a lot of Quidditch,” he said at last. “It made me lose weight.”
Regulus sighed as he leaned back against the table. “I know, but I don’t see what’s his problem with it. I only drink on holidays, not even birthdays.”
Barley three steps away, Draco caught up with him, and placed a hand on his shoulder to stop him. “I came to talk to you,” he said. “We’ll walk to the common room together.”
Harry flushed. “No, I just-”
Sirius pursed his lips. “We’re not done talking about this,” he said. “And you will eat. Right now, they’ll bring lunch soon and I’ll order you a full meal and you’ll eat it all.”
“I know,” he said. And he did want to eat, he’d promised Sirius after all. “But it’s not easy,” he admitted. Sirius was gone- really gone, and he would never see him again, never have to suffer the embarrassment of being called ‘pup’, never have to put up with a Sirius trying to match-make him with his colleagues' children, never hear him laugh, never wish him a happy birthday or a merry Christmas and eating seemed like such a trivial, selfish human thing that it disgusted him.
Draco had taken permission to stay with him till after the funeral, which was tomorrow, but then he’ll have to return to school.
“I know,” Harry sobbed into Draco’s chest, the sound choked and strangled. “I know,” he repeated, quieter this time. “I know.”
“I-,” this was not how he’d managed their first conversation. “Everything’s alright,” he said. “School’s fine, my friends are alright. Ron and Hermione finally started dating, did you know?” He asked.
The night went on wonderfully. Regulus had pulled in Draco for a dance when the next had started and then beckoned Harry over so the three of them were dancing together, ignoring the few weird looks they got. They danced and danced, stopping only when Harry's feet were too sore to continue and Regulus was starting to get 'peckish'. They went around the tables collecting food and stopped to chat with friends and acquaintances alike before they
Around midnight, when the kisses had started to get a little too intense they were interrupted by cheering voices from the middle of the hall. They went to look and found Sirius and Kinglsey in the middle of a drinking contest. After that the party started to dwindle down and until it was one thirty in the morning and it was only them and their friends left. They caught up with everyone for a bit before excusing themselves and joining Sirius and Remus in waiting for their carriage.
“And what about you?” Draco hissed. “Am I supposed to just leave you here? How will I know you’ll eat anything in these two weeks? My mother can manage.”
"So who's name do you want to keep?" Harry asked.
with some guests, was a very pregnant Daphne.
“And you used it to spy on me?” Harry hissed, turning to look at him. “Whatever happened to privacy and trust?”
The candlelight was burning low in the Slytherin common room but Harry flipped the page in the novel he was reading, determined to at least finish this chapter before going to bed.
“I think you do, Harry.” Said Draco, redirecting his gaze so that he was looking at the snuffed out fireplace near them. “You gave me your invisibility cloak, remember? I-“
“Maybe you can skip the wine tonight?” Harry asked as Regulus led him to a pastry laden table. “He means well, you know.”
Draco gritted his teeth beside him. “Not before you eat this,” he said.
“But?” Harry prompted, scared.
Sirius squeezed him before pulling back, but didn’t completely let go of him. “That Veil you pulled me out of, Harry, was the Veil of death. It’s what separates us from the dead and no one who had fallen through it had ever re-emerged.
He didn’t say anything, just stared at them, and left. As he walked away, he couldn’t help but think that Nevielle at least had his grandmother, Harry had no one.
After a few weeks, Harry returned to school. Remus had had to leave for a mission and Harry couldn’t face an empty house, so he’d asked to go back to Hogwarts.
Harry flushed under his gaze. “I- What do you want me to say?” He snapped. “What happened happened, I’ll start eating if that’s what you want.”
“Potter,” said Snape without
The rest of that week passed by in a blur consisting of redheads and blonds and laughter. On Christmas morning, Harry had woken up to Sirius screaming in pain and was pulled out of the room by Remus as the nurses rushed in to take Sirius away to the surgery room.
Regulus smiled at her. "I hope you it's a girl then. And it was lovely chatting with you, but may we be excused? We'll be back."
“You three go ahead and do whatever you want,” Sirius said, standing up. “I want to see my boyfriend.” And with that he hopped off the carriage and walked up to the entrance, where he was greeted by a footman.
Harry looked at him for a moment before snapping his mouth shut. “Fine,” he gritted, getting to his feet. “I’ll go to Grimmauld Place, but then it will be one full meal a day, nothing more.”
Draco groaned. "Pansy is going to kill me." He said, looking like he wanted to face palm himself if not for his preoccupied hands.
“Yes,” said Regulus sweetly. “You wouldn’t do this to Harry.”
Draco stood up with him. “I’m coming with you,” he said.
Regulus laughed and Harry bid her farewell before allowing himself to be swept away by Regulus. "Where are you taking me?”
“Shouldn’t you?”
Draco froze mid-sentence, and didn’t look up from his parchment when he asked. “Get help for what?”
"Claiming the Black name in that way will be an everlasting amusement source to Sirius." Regulus said thoughtfully.
Harry reached out to open the door and paused, turning to Dumbledore. “Will you be coming in with me Professor, or-?”
Regulus wrapped his arms around Harry and lifted his head back a bit before kissing him. Harry moaned into his mouth and this only encouraged Regulus further. He turned Harry around so that he was pressed between the table and him. Their tongues clashed as they fought for dominance and Harry had to suppress a shiver as Regulus ran his hands up his back.
Daphne beamed. "Of course," she said. "And I don't think you have a choice about being back."
“I just wanted someone to blame,” he sobbed and he was aware of Draco coming over to him and kneeling on the ground beside him, wrapping him in a hug. “It made it easier, you know? I wanted to focus my anger, my hatred, my grief on someone, on something, and I- I don’t know. It just made sense to take it out on myself. It’s my fault after all, isn’t? He wouldn’t have been there if I hadn’t been there. He wouldn’t have been there if I had practiced Occlumency as I was told, as he told me. It was just a coping mechanism, and I tried to stop, I really did, but I couldn’t. It just made sense to not eat, it made perfect,crystal clear, sense. And it kind of works, you know? It distracts me and that’s it, isn’t it? I just need a distraction until I don’t have to deal with it anymore.”
But before he could say anything else, they were interrupted by booming laughter. “I’m glad you had the decency to stop.” Said Blaise. “Daphne sent with me strict orders to give you a room if you didn’t cease your snogging.”
“We weren’t on it for that long,” said Regulus flustrdley. Harry was inclined to agree, but he was thankful for the interruption. He didn’t think other parts of his body could go on for much longer without wanting to join in.
“I- I don’t know what you mean,” he said, fully knowing that Sirius won’t buy it.
“You can’t do this!” He yelled, pulling back from Sirius’s hold. “You can’t just come back and go again! It’s not a game! You either stay, or leave! It’s- It’s not-”
“Harry,” Sirius grinned as he enveloped Harry in a gentle hug. Sirius then tightened the hug and Harry felt him wince.
“I’m scared,” he admitted. “I’ve tried before and failed, who’s to say I’ll succeed this time?”
He muttered the password to Salazar Slytherin and stepped into the buzzing coming room, filled with students from all years lounging happily and exchanging latest gossip. Of course, there always was the threat of Voldemorts, but here it was like he had no power. No one could touch a good gossip mood.
Sirius closed his eyes and took a breath. “They say I have two weeks at the most.”
The next morning, before opening their presents, Harry, Draco and Regulus dragged Remus and Sirius out of bed to serve as witnesses to their marriage and when they returned home, it was the five Blacks' best Christmas.
“I’ve done my part of the deal,” he said. “Now it’s your turn.”
They were sitting at the kitchen table in Grimmauld Place, facing a cold breakfast. The school term had started this morning, but Harry had been excused for the rest of the term, the teachers told him they’ll just count his marks from before Christmas. He’d nodded and thanked them for the arrangements before going back to his bedroom, where he’d taken to spending most of his time.
He’d just nodded, not trusting himself to speak. It was a Friday morning and his friends have been excused from their classes to attend the funeral. Remus had ensured that it would be a private gathering, not wanting to attract the media’s attention with Sirius’s past. Harry had hugged him and thanked him profusely for taking care of it all, Remus had just shaken his head and said that it was his job and Harry wouldn’t have even needed to sign those papers if not for the stupid laws. That at least had drawn a laugh from Harry.
Harry was slowly starting to eat again, he wasn’t fully comfortable with eating a whole meal yet, but he slowly got accustomed to the idea of eating. Sometimes he’d run away and throw the food up, so Sirius and Remus had made a rule about sitting together for an hour after each meal. One day, when he was coming back from a bathroom break, he’d heard Remus promise Sirius to take care of Harry after his- he’s gone. He’d told him to not let him go even after he’d come of age and he finally turned away when they kissed.
Draco smiled at him and pulled him into their hug, so that he had an arm around Harry while Regulus was wrapped around his waist. "We can change it if you want."
Nothing will. “Alright,” he said.
“There will be no sex for you,” corrected Draco. “Harry, on the other hand…” He leaned in toward Harry and kissed him, their masks clashing a bit. Harry moaned in pleasure and leaned back further, allowing him to deepen the kiss. But just when he had slipped his tongue in, Draco drew back. Tease. “We might even make you watch.” Draco said to Regulus.
Once they were outside, Draco turned to him and held out the napkin. “I got you a Croissant,” he said. “Since you missed dinner. Eat it.”
When he came back, he was accompanied by Draco, Mrs.Malfoy and the Weasleys. They all greeted Sirius merrily and chatted with him for the majority of the day. As far as Harry was aware, only the adults knew about Sirius’s two weeks. After the Weasleys left -promising to return on Christmas and even once before that- Remus arrived, when there was only Draco and Mrs.Malfoy left.
“A meal?” Draco said, his voice rising to nearly a shout. “You haven’t eaten since yesterday! Are you trying to kill yourself?”
He placed an arm around Harry's waist, and took his arm with the other, leading them gently down the dance floor. Harry smiled at him in thanks and stole a kiss. "I love you," he said, his voice soft and full of emotion.
“But you do have to deal with it, Harry,” Draco said, hugging him closer to his chest. “You have to deal with it so you can move on. And you’re right, it might never happen. Your godfather might never wake up, so you have to start moving on. I know it’s what he would’ve wanted.”
At the cafeteria he just got a bottle of water before heading back to Sirius, not thinking he could stomach anything at the moment and vowing to start working on his promise to Sirius soon. When he reached his godfather he briefly knocked on the door before entering, not waiting for an answer. Dumbledore could talk to him any time wanted, he had known Sirius since he was eleven anyways, Harry only really got to know him two and a half years ago, and now-
The music in the hall changed then, turning to a soft dance melody. Harry loved this song particularly and wanted to ask Regulus for a dance, but he ignored it in favour of interrogating Daphne.
Draco chose a table in the corner whilst Potter ordered their drinks and food.
. He choked on a biscuit when he saw a wedding announcement for Goyle and Astoria Greengrass. Had the world gone completely mad?
"Which you didn't even realise until twenty minutes and three wrong turns later."
"I don't know what I'm supposed to say," Draco said.
"Wait," Harry said. "The 2nd of September?"
Potter wrapped his hands around Draco's waist and held him close. Painfully close.
Potter led them to a deep green sofa. He sat close to Draco, so that their thighs touched.
"I know," Harry said. "We will. Let's just go out for a bit first. I'm a little anxious as well, and I think the fresh air will do us some good."
Draco rolled off him and reached into his bedside table for the bottle of lubricant Potter had tossed in with their shopping a mere two weeks prior. He handed it to Potter, who unscrewed the cap and squeezed a dollop onto his fingers.
"Hullo."
On the first day he opened the shop after the holidays, Draco turned the key to lock everything up that evening. It had been a decent day. A day without Potter, but otherwise decent.
"A similar principle is at play here."
"I need the Potter-Lawrence case file."
"I'll see you Friday," Robards said. "Don't kill each other."
Robards leant back in his chair and rubbed his temples. He sat staring at his desk for a long time. Draco hoped Harry had got to safety.
Potter's mouth quirked into a smile. "Are you still drunk?"
More and more often, they exchanged pleasantries. Neither probed the other about their reason for living in Cartmel, however. And considering that none of Draco's friends or family came pounding on his door, Potter clearly had not shared Draco's whereabouts with anyone.
"Sofa's not to your liking then?"
Draco nodded. "Were you planning to come back? To the shop. My shop, I mean." He was too nervous. Perhaps this was a mistake.
"It's fine. Really."
"Now get out," Jennings said. "And if you tell anyone except Potter, I'll kill you myself. Trust me when I say nobody would miss you."
"I wasn't aware I was obligated to inform you of all my acquaintances."
Because it was someone else at the Ministry.
Whatever Robards believed, it was wrong. It wasn't worth it to waste more time trying to convince a man who didn't want to see the truth.
Draco was sitting behind the counter as usual, only he wasn't engrossed in a book. He was looking out the window, right at Harry.
wrong," Draco said. "I've just found evidence that Pierce tampered with the Ministry safe house files at the beginning of September."
He wasn't sure what he was expecting though. Aside from the books and puzzles, there was no indication as to what kind of person occupied this space. Harry felt a pang in his chest as he entered the bedroom and sat on the bed. There was so much more to Draco than this. He knew there was. He pulled open the top drawer of the bedside table and furrowed his brow. The only thing inside was an old Muggle sweets tin. And that seemed an odd sort of thing for anyone to keep around, let alone Draco.
Potter was not a regular.
The day was a blur. An angry blur.
"Can I bribe you?"
"I've got just the thing," Emily said. "There's a ceilidh in two-and-a-half weeks' time. You
But since Draco had avoided saying anything at all to Potter, he had no idea what the Chosen One was even doing here, in
Draco snatched Potter's cup and woodenly shuffled away to refill it.
Draco rushed to exit the room first when the meeting ended.
Draco did his best to avoid Potter throughout the week. They ate meals together, but otherwise, a good deal of his time was spent sequestered in the bedroom with a book.
"And that's all! Take a rest, everyone, we'll have another go soon!"
"I'm not sure." Harry reached for Draco's hand. "But it doesn't change how I feel or what I want."
Draco gave a confused smile, like he was trying to swallow a snide comment. "Thanks."
"Right."
After a few minutes, the bedroom door creaked open, and Potter's head poked out.
It was hard to say what went through Potter's head then. He placed a hand on Draco's bare shoulder and began rubbing it.
"What makes you think I can't do both at once?"
"I just prefer to cook for myself." Potter gave him a disbelieving look. "It really is that simple. I'm not having you on."
Draco rolled his eyes—Barclay's life wasn't in danger here. He contorted his face into what he hoped was an apologetic expression and said, "Let me get you a coffee."
"Now, how long have you two been married?"
"I don't know how you can sleep here," Draco said.
Harry blinked a few times, wondering if he'd missed something. "Don't know what?"
And that made him feel so guilty.
"When I was driving, it was still my fault."
The hallway that led to the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office was dark and narrow. Thankfully, it was also devoid of people. Draco turned right where Barclay told him to, and the hallway grew darker and narrower, until at last he came face to face with a faded wooden door with a placard that read 'Confidential Records Office — Restricted Access'.
Maybe he didn't need any more coffee. He set his cup on the table in front of him, then pulled out his journal, his pen, and set to writing.
Draco paused mid-chew, certain his heart was going to pound out of his chest. He realised Potter was watching him and dragged his fork through a pool of gravy.
Draco put his fork down. "Obviously. That's why you showed up ten minutes late and look as though you've been wearing the same robes for the last three days."
Fine. So he missed Potter. He'd been a part of Draco's daily existence for a long time. It was hard to forget that so easily. Potter had become part of his routine, and now that routine had abruptly vanished. Missing that, missing Potter - it couldn't be helped.
It was the puzzle piece he'd been trying to place that morning when Draco had called for him, begging him to get the portkey. He squeezed the piece hard between his fingers. It felt like some relic from another age.
As if they had a choice.
Draco was burrowed against him as always, head tucked under Harry's chin.
It was tiny. A large grey sofa occupied much of the space. A table stood in one corner, with a dusty tele-thing on top. The walls were pink and covered with all sorts of hideous artwork.
And just then, oblivion looked pretty damn good to him.
He opened his eyes slowly, just in case Potter was awake.
Draco spoke with two other Ministry workers he suspected, but he soon realised his interrogation skills were lacking when both of them reacted the same way as Wimple had done.
"No, sir. I'm fine."
"No, but he can find out. We have access to all sorts of information, including…" Harry's face went pale.
"Isn't there a potion you can take for that?"
It was all over.
"I was at the same Ministry Christmas party as you for the last six years. Erm, who should lead?"
Draco tried to remember. It felt so long ago. So much had changed since then. He looked at Harry and wondered if he was thinking the same.
When Whitby returned, they discussed the various potions he would try, and doses. Draco was instructed to begin keeping a journal of his symptoms and how the potions affected him. Whitby gave him a portkey as well, in case Draco found himself in some kind of medical emergency. It would take him directly to the critical care ward in St. Mungo's.
"It's mostly used to reheat food," Potter said.
"Do you want tea or something?" Potter blushed and lowered his voice. "Or we can talk now, if you want."
And that proved challenging when he realised he had to wait until someone entered one of the lifts in order to remain inconspicuous.
But the sight of Harry made him forget any discomfort. He lay crumpled near the telly with his hands and feet bound. His face was red and tear-streaked, and his breath came out in ragged gasps. Draco's heart clenched at the sight, and he tried to push himself up. But he was so disorientated that he nearly toppled back over.
"Then I'll make you cook our entire meal."
"Actually," Barclay looked around and lowered his voice, "there's more to it than that. Wilcox, the Records Keeper, died last Saturday morning."
The carriage pulled up in front of an enormous dark Victorian manor, it’s shadow looming over them like a grim reaper. The house was every horror story you’ve ever heard and every nightmare you’ve ever had put together.
“I’ll get lost how I like,” said Regulus as he returned the kiss. “And I love you.”
“I know,” said Sirius gently. “But my upper fell through it, and I got damaged from that. It’s nothing they’d ever seen before. They’ve tried various spells and have called in international healers. There’s nothing they can do.”
. “We received from St.Mungo’s -Harry’s heart clenched at that please let it be good news, he thought please, please, please- that your godfather has woken up. W-”
“It’s not true,” he said once again, after all the rage, anger and denial has left his body. “You’re just joking, right?”
Harry didn’t remember much of the funeral later on, just that there had been a few eulogies and people had gotten up to place things in Sirius’s casket. He hadn’t joined the, in honor of one of Sirius’s last wishes.
“I - Yes, of course Professor,” he said. “Should I go put my bag away?”
Draco wrapped an arm around his shoulder and plucked the DADA textbook from his hands with the other. “No one,” he said. “There’s no guarantee that this time will be it, or otherwise. What matters is that you’ll be trying and I’ll be there to get your through it. As will Mr.Lupin.”
“He did it to spite me,” said Draco from beside Harry as they walked. “I kissed you infront of him and now he kissed you infront of me.”
“I guess we have nothing to talk about then, go back to Daphne. I can walk myself to the common room.”
Harry looked at him sideways and gave him a crooked smile. “Dumbledore.”
"With Pansy," Harry supplied. "Why didn't you tell us you were pregnant! How far in are you?"
“Harry,” Sirius said the moment he closed the door behind him. Harry looked up at him questioningly. “Did you spend the summer at the Dursleys’?”
"What else were we supposed to think?" Regulus asked as he placed an arm around Draco's waist. "You abandon us in her favor the moment we enter a ball and we don't see you even after we're four songs and two dances in." He kissed Draco on the lips briefly before pulling back with a playful smile.
Regulus rolled his eyes from behind the mask he was wearing but Draco snorted, causing both boys to look at him. “He’s not going to get drunk,” Draco said, pointing at Regulus. “He promised and if he breaks the promise -no sex.”
“My mother told me,” he said quietly.
Draco smacked him on the head while Harry laughed. "What?" Asked Regulus innocently. "I have a point."
“He’s in there?” He asked softly.
"Did so," Harry said with a smile as he allowed himself to be pulled into a hug.
Sirius turned back to Dumbledore, rage flickering in his eyes and Harry saw Dumbledore prepare himself for a shouting match - a one sided one.
"Went to look for Pansy," Harry said as he pushed Regulus off him. The heat of it all was seriously starting to get to him, soon they’ll have to ask for a room.
Harry sat down at the bed beside Sirius, his hand still in his godfather’s. “I- I’m okay,” he said. “Things have been a little weird, but-”
Dumbledore looked at him with those twinkling blue eyes, and when he smiled Harry allowed himself a sigh of relief. “Yes, Harry.” He said. “I am to inform you that you are free of your classes for the rest of the day and if you wish I can take you to St.Mungo’s right now.”
The funeral took place in a small, ancient wizarding cemetery in London. Draco explained that this was where all pure bloods were buried: a wizarding cemetery in the city of their death.
During one of the few occasions where he was conscious in that last week, Sirius had asked Harry to not look in his casket at the funeral.
He heard Draco walk toward him and he sighed as he placed his finger on the page before closing the book so he won’t lose his progress. “Please, Draco.” He said as the boy sat beside him. “Go to bed, I’ll be up soon, okay?”
“And that’s all?” Sirius asked with a raised eyebrow.
Two days before Christmas break, Harry was pulled out of class by Professors Snape and Dumbledore.
He wasn’t able to pay full attention in any of his classes and hadn’t been able to complete assignments regularly, but the teachers had thanked him for his effort and asked him not to worry.
Regulus led them out of the maze of tables and into the dance floor. "To dance," he said, smiling at Harry. "I know this is your favourite song."
“Maybe- Maybe not so in the open,” Harry said against Regulus’s mouth.
“You wouldn’t,” Harry said, appalled. He didn’t think he could count it as a party if there was no after-sex.
The third time he was walking sitting on the Quidditch stands while everyone was having dinner. He’d just come down from a flight that had helped ease his mind and was appreciating the magic of the field at night when he felt someone slip in beside him. He didn’t need to look up to see that it was Draco.
As the foursome made their way out of the graveyard, a single star in the sky glistened brighter than the rest, for a moment, before returning to its usual glimmer.
“He doesn’t know,” Harry whispered.
Professor Dumbledore looked at him with those twinkling blue eyes and nodded with a smile. “Of course, Harry.”
Harry nodded.
“Can we not talk about that?”
Harry and Regulus followed him to the chocolate fountain centered in the right corner of the hall, surrounded by laughing people and various fruit bowls.There were apples, strawberries, bananas, kiwis and some red fruit Harry didn't recognise. He guessed that was bound to happen when the hosts have spent the better part of the year abroad. When they turned around the fountain, however, Harry let out an involuntary gasp. Standing there before them, chatting
Harry glared at him. “I’m not hungry,” he said and resumed walking. “You said you wanted to talk- talk.”
Harry shook his head. “No,” he said, trying not to let the panic seep into his voice. “I can’t go back there, I don’t want to go back there. Don’t make me, please.”
“One step at a time,” Draco murmured. “Remember?”
Sirius opened his eyes. “Don’t you?”
“Yes, Harry.” Dumbledore said. “I believe he is.”
Harry nodded and averted his eyes, don’t say you love me. “When will they release you?” He asked. If they didn’t let him go soon then at least he knew where he’ll be spending Christmas.
Sirius shook his head. “No I’m okay,” he said. “They said the pain will linger for a while, there’s nothing they can do about it. How have you been?”
Harry then told them about how he had kissed Draco under the mistletoe, blushing when he told them about their ‘I love yous’ and smiling when he promised he wasn’t rushing anything. They spent the rest of the evening talking mindlessly, not really caring about topics and enjoying each others’ company.
“Well I’ll never really know, will I?” Harry snapped back.
they were pulled out of the dance floor by Draco.
Harry closed his eyes and took in a breath. “Draco please don’t do this,” he whispered.
And with that he walked away, his steps nearing a gallop in his hurry to get away from Draco. He didn’t exactly want to kill himself, but he wouldn’t mind if it happened. And it would happen, he thought as he slowed down near a staircase, because the nutrition potions were only good enough to get him through classes, nothing more. He still had to wear four layers to feel remotely warm, still had to magically heat his bed so he could stop shivering at night, and still took pills so he could sleep. He referred to muggle ones so he wouldn’t arouse suspicion by asking for sleeping potions every night, but the nutrition ones were easy enough to get.
"Malfoy," Robards said. "Our one-to-one is in an hour. Can't it wait?"
But then, there was nothing inside. Nothing worth taking, at least.
The emptiness left by Potter's absence was pervasive and all-consuming. Happy memories always lured Draco further into the abyss of loneliness. Memories of a not-too-distant past, ones where he and Potter had shared meals and spoken easily with each other. There were a few instances where they'd talked long into the night, and the sound of Potter's laughter always lingered in Draco's ears, lulling him to sleep when he got home.
“I’ll go look for Pansy,” said Draco, scanning the attendees. “I still have her Christmas present, but I will find you afterwards, so don’t wait for me here.” He leaned in to press a kiss to Harry’s cheek but Harry twisted so that their lips met instead. “Bastard,” said Draco when he drew back, but he was smiling.
“Yes Harry,” Daphne said. “But he left all that information lying around, it can’t be all good, can it?”
He pushed past Draco and made his way to the changing rooms, only to be stopped by Draco’s once again. “People love you Harry,” Draco cried from the stands. “No matter how many people you want to push away, you’ll never be able to push away their love. I know your friends love you: Weasley, Granger, Daphne, Zabini and Pansy. I know all the Weaselys love you too, the Greengrasses also adore you and I know for a fact the Mr.Lupin fought for custody of you, but was denied repeatedly, and despite Dumbledore’s interferences, only because of his condition. These people love you and you’ll never, ever, be able to push them away. They’ll always be there for you whether you like it or not. They’ll hurt when you hurt and be happy when you’re happy. I know your godfather loved you -hell, loves you, and I know that if given the choice he’d do it all over again simply because he loves you. He fell doing what he wanted and you have no right beating yourself up over it like that. Hell Harry, I love you, and I know I’d do the same for you whether you like it or not. But please, and I’m begging you here, don’t make the people who love you watch as you slowly kill yourself. Don’t make me watch.” He said the last part quietly, his voice barely a croak, but Harry heard it all the same and he couldn’t stop the tears as they poured down his face this time and he fell onto his knees, sobbing.
One thing Draco liked about village life was that not all that much changed. The seasons. The tourists. That was pretty much it.
"Brilliant," Jeremy said. "Oh, here they are." He waved to three people who stepped into the pub and were removing their jackets.
Lister led them to the car. "Who would like to learn how to drive first?" He looked expectantly at them.
"Fuck, I'm coming, I'm coming," he mumbled, and swung his legs off the end of the sofa, stretching. He made his way to the door, attempted to smooth his hair, and flung it open.
He opened the door and was met with a windowless, dimly lit room. Aside from a small desk up front, row after row of shelves filled the space, and Draco felt thankful for bringing the largest cup of coffee he could find.
Draco crashed to the ground, slamming his left shoulder against the coffee table. Pain shot through his arm, and he lay on the floor clutching at it and cursing.
"Oh?"
"You can't kill him," Harry said.
"I'm about as good as the average person here," Potter said.
Draco's mind flitted between trying to discern which Ministry employee could be a murderer and his feelings for Potter, which seemed to be fuelled by more than mere lust. But that was all this was to Potter, a spot of fun, which made Draco's longing pierce his heart with a knife-like pain.
Whitby snorted. "Big evening planned?"
"It's just some stupid village thing. Besides, you shouldn't get too attached to these Muggles."
"This is why I don't ask you for help," Draco said. "I know you'll just laugh at me. I can't drive, and every time I go outside I'm ambushed by people with nothing better to do than spy on their neighbours."
Draco's funeral was a week later.
"And you don't think I can find that out." Draco turned his eyes down at his bowl of beef stew and sulked.
Maybe this had been a mistake. He couldn't remember why he came back, if he even had a reason. He hadn't been sleeping well, and he needed some time alone after the funeral. Anyone would.
Robards reached into his desk and tossed over a thin stack of envelopes. "Here's your post."
He closed the access book. "Barclay?"
"This is the pace I always go." He was dying to look back.
Draco turned towards him and frowned. "I'm fine." At least, he would be once he'd soaked in the bath with a good book. And then, with any luck, a pleasant date that evening would salvage the day.
"It's not home," he said.
Draco gave a cursory glance around as he shoved his keys into his pocket. He did a double-take when his eyes latched onto a familiar figure that came to a sudden halt at the end of the street. A very familiar figure. One with messy hair and bright green eyes that shifted from Draco to Whitby, confused.
!" Potter grabbed Draco's arm and yanked him to standing.
Nor did he turn down Potter's suggestion that they invite Jeremy for dinner Wednesday.
Draco popped a salty chip into his mouth and unwrapped his burger.
Potter ignored him and scanned his shopping list. "I think this should be enough to get us started. Let's go."
That had only begun.
And he stepped confidently down the path, through the falling snow and all the way to the bookshop. At the door, he didn't even pause - just took a deep breath and went in.
Draco sighed. "Yes."
"I'm going to ask him."
"Let's clean this up tomorrow and go to bed."
Robards tossed the stack of parchment onto his desk. He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. "Listen to yourself," he said quietly. "I'm willing to give you a chance—I wouldn't have hired you otherwise—but you keep making excuses and blaming everyone else. I can't help you unless you help yourself."
Something... distinctly odd was happening. Some kind of electric jolt began in his toes and worked its way up. It was tingly and uncomfortable, and the feeling quickly morphed into hundreds of quick, tiny stabs of pain. He hunched over the desk when it reached his chest, which felt like it would explode. What the hell had Whitby given him? Draco never listened when Whitby performed new tests or gave him new things. He'd long since stopped caring. None of it mattered anyway.
"I don't know."
Draco nodded. He took that as his cue to leave and stood.
Still, though, he hadn't known Potter was taking the loss of his partner so hard.
doing book-keeping, are you?"
Draco needed to tell someone. Robards. But he felt a pull towards Harry as well, to tell him and keep him safe. If Pierce had obtained the safe house locations almost two months ago, why hadn't he come after them yet? Something was odd.
"You do it," Pierce said. "I've got work to do." He laughed and sauntered out of the kitchen.
"I have the bed this week," Draco said quickly.
Outside the Confidential Records Office, Draco took several deep breaths to calm himself, then slowly opened the door.
Potter held a hand out. "Here, give me the map."
Potter turned onto another narrow road and finally said, "Here! Oh, damn." The car stalled.
"You can go faster if you want," Draco said. "You're not going to break me."
"How did you manage that?"
"Oh, work." Lewis waved his hand. "Just got a bit carried away. You know."
He'd have chicken that evening, he decided.
Potter moaned into Draco's mouth, and any blood that remained in Draco's head went straight to his groin. He rolled his hips upwards again, pleased to have Potter making those noises so close to his ear.
And ask whether he was still interested in being with Draco.
A maddening urge to see Potter overtook him.
"Jennings said there's a room on Level Five…"
In an attempt to avoid becoming a complete recluse, Draco made himself go on walks with Potter, where they were immediately assaulted by prying neighbours. They came at them from all sides and had an endless battery of questions. Draco reminded himself repeatedly that it would do no good to make enemies whilst here. Even though Muggles hardly registered as a threat, they could be extremely irritating.
"That's fine. At any rate, as you might imagine, this is just the progressive nature of the curse, the infection. It's one of the early symptoms of..." He waved his hand in the air, beckoning the right phrase to appear.
Draco leant back in the bath and closed his eyes, trying to avoid thinking about who might want to kill Harry, instead focussing on the simple pleasure of the hot water soothing the aches and soreness in his legs.
Robards held up a hand. "We've already questioned Potter at length. I want to avoid having too many people involved."
"Fine," Draco said. The relief that spread through Potter's face was palpable. Draco watched his entire body relax, sagging into the chair. He averted his eyes, and spied the clock. "It's time for you to leave," he said. "I need to close the shop." Thank Merlin.
Harry sat down next to him. "Your whole house is full of nothing. And this." He shook the tin. "What is it?"
Draco nodded. Potter wanted out, then. It
Of course, neither had his partner. But Barclay was an idiot.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked over the packages of Jaffa Cakes. He couldn't tell whether they were cakes or biscuits.
Wrong.
"You don't look so good," Potter said one evening.
"You're welcome to come," Potter added.
Potter smiled and pulled down his soft cotton joggers. Draco's eyes went straight to the bulge in his pants.
"Well, it was, for a while. Sort of." His eyes searched Draco's as though trying to find the right words. "But something changed. You really make me… I mean…"
Jeremy puffed a ring of smoke at him and smiled. "I'd avoid being in charge of catering if that's your aim."
"Pierce."
A dilemma.
"And what about me?"
It was still dark, but he felt aware of himself. He wiggled his fingers—he could move, at least.
Draco hooked his arms behind his knees to keep them in place. His head fell back against the pillow, and he groaned as Harry took him in his mouth and swirled his tongue around the head. It was agonising rapture, and Draco didn't think it could get any more intense than this until he felt Harry tentatively slide a finger inside him.
It wasn't sealed. Surely MacDonald and Jennings wouldn't mind if he read the report first.
"I still think this has something to do with the case you and Lawrence were working on," Draco said. "I wonder if there's a link from your case to someone in the Ministry. That could explain everything."
He burrowed further under the blankets and bumped into something warm.
And Draco listened.
Harry couldn't finish the puzzle.
"Why was that in your bedroom?" he asked. "If you don't know when you'll need it, why aren't you carrying it with you all the time?"
Draco read late into the night, and when he crept into the bathroom to prepare for bed, he took a moment to look at Potter, who was a very chaotic sleeper. Every night when Draco passed through, Potter was flopped over in a different, sprawling position, and his mouth always hung open. If only the wizarding world could see their hero now.
"I wasn't joking earlier when I said the floor might suit you."
"Well, how about we go together?" Potter said quietly.
Potter had seemed fine when they got ice cream, but once they were back home, he sank into the sofa and stared listlessly at the telly whilst a boring news programme played. Draco sat on the opposite end with his book, but he kept glancing at Potter and tried to decide what he should do.
There was a certain comfort to be had in knowing what was going to greet him every single day. His barren bedroom. His sombre face in the mirror. His fifteen-minute walk from the cottage to the bookshop. His slow but steady decline.
"Hm? Oh, just a few pints."
"And I've never been careful with money. I'm not going to start now."
So at ten-thirty, he mumbled a goodbye of sorts to Potter and Apparated.
"Well, nobody else gives a damn!"
He opened his eyes and saw Potter's arm around him, which meant it was Potter's body that was partially draped over his.
"No way. You're coming with me. I have no idea what you want."
Draco rolled over and out of bed and got ready for work.
"No. You have to work tomorrow, remember?"
He looked over at Potter and wondered what his life was like before all this. Did he even live in London? Did he take part in wizarding pub quizzes? What was his flat like? Probably messy—he couldn't even keep his hair neat.
Occasionally, Potter asked whether he wanted to watch anything, but Draco shook his head and kept his gaze focussed on his book.
"Is it really? Well, there you are." Lister scratched his head and then punched some buttons that made irritating chirping noises. "You can set the cooking time here."
Draco couldn't get enough of this, of Potter, and he tried to convey that in the way he kissed him back. It was soft and slow, and without the urgency of lust behind it, all that remained was a quiet, steady intimacy.
"Things of that nature, yes."
"When I ask you to come in, I mean now, not an hour from now!" Robards continued.
"Oh, fuck, I think I've lost the key."
"If we're lost, it's your fault."
While he sat, regaining his composure, someone began rapping at the front door outside. Draco hastily locked drawers, threw glass jars into a box, and exited the store room, making sure to lock it behind him. A glance at the clock revealed it was now opening time, so that was probably Mrs. Wilder out front, anxious for her coffee. He would have to make some adjustments to his morning routine.
