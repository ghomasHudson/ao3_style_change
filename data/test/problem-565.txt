“Run into you?” Harry laughed. “You killed me, if you don’t recall! I was minding my own business when you had to swoop out of the sky and zerg me!”
“Maybe,” Draco laughed sardonically before popping a piece of chocolate in his mouth. “It’s about all the shitty dates I’ve ever had.”
“Good evening,” he greeted Hugo when he realized he was alone in the corridor. “Congratulations on breathing for the first time.”
She flipped over in the bed (Merlin her stomach was big) to try and find a comfortable sleeping position. If anything, she would enjoy the silken sheets until she had to go.
“It’s weird, innit?” Alex said carefully. He hoped he wasn’t the only one who felt it with his foster parents. While there was no real frame of reference for him since he had no memories of his parents, he was sure there was something strange about two people deciding to become your parents.
“Are you going to force me into labor or something?” Grace asked stiffly. “Because really, I promise I’m not going to back out on giving you the kid and it can definitely come on its own—“
“Not now. We’ll have to clean it, and you’ll need to have a talk with one of our best pediatricians.”
“About that,” Harry said, beginning to navigate his own way into the slim black trousers he’d been given. “I can pay for things, too. I know that’s not exactly part of the fantasy but I don’t want the financial burden to be entirely on you.”
Chris dipped his fedora down in what had to be a display of sadness, which made Draco wanted to strangle him. “I didn’t think she’d accept me,” he admitted.
Harry nodded, head cottony and soft when Draco rubbed the skin he’d hurt before. “Yes, please,” Harry requested.
With a few more slaps of their skin, Draco was spilling over the edge and taking up Harry’s offer to do so inside him, his cock jumping and spurting forth white bursts in his already-slick heat.
“Draco, it’s fine,” Harry waived away quickly, feeling his face heat up involuntarily. He hadn’t known that Draco would react so strongly to this. “
Draco took a deep breath before resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Okay.” He sort of had lost sight of what this was supposed to be about.
“You know,” Pansy said, voice a little too sincere for Draco’s taste. “I really do have to thank you for introducing me to that magazine. Don’t think I haven’t forgotten about your little quest, too.”
That day, however, nothing had been on Grace’s itinerary. Not even a meal out with the prospective parents. They were both busy celebrating with the Weasleys even though the birth had been a week ago, and Grace could only imagine what would happen when they got their own kid. She wasn’t really going to stick around to find out, but she predicted centuries of celebration.
Harry had a sinking feeling in his stomach that this couldn’t end well. “I don’t think that’s what we want, sorry.”
Sirius agreed with his husband wholeheartedly and broke the rusty hinges to pry the damn thing open.
“Gerda,” she said pleasantly. “Who’s at the door at this hour? I thought Draco and Harry were taking Grace out to dinner tonight.”
In the bathroom mirror Draco wore a frown to see himself so unshaven. He immediately waved his wand to bring the razor and cream out of the drawer and dancing into his hands. He applied the foamy white mixture generously to his face and went in with the multi-blade tool, shaving off the peach fuzz in favor of a cleaner look. “That’s wonderful, Harry,” Draco said and meant it. “You really have come far.”
Thinking of the baby probably wasn’t wise when at work. Harry knew that Benjy was some couple’s baby, someone’s son. He swore to himself that his little girl would never face wars like he had. Not even horrors of the aftermath of a war.
Harry paused to bite his lip. It felt strange being so formal with the two people who’d risked life and limb for him on at least once an occasion per year at Hogwarts.
“Maybe if you lived with—“ Before Ron could pitch round two of his idea that Harry live in their guestroom his wand lit up red in his pocket. “Ah, fuck.”
Now both men were holding each other with a squeeze, trying to keep from losing sight of what was most important here.
“Just some things we had back when we were in school,” Remus shrugged off, loath to show a thirteen year-old girl his friends’ erotic ramblings from their teenage years. “Tell me the exhilarating tale of your afternoon.”
“Auror Weasley, Auror Weasley!” they cried over their shoulder. “I think he’s under the Imperius curse!” Two more Aurors flanked them, each one grabbing an arm of Draco’s to haul him to his feet, fumbling with their handcuffs. Harry fumed.
“You coming?” Colin hollered from the kitchen. “These are going to be perfectly crispy, I can just feel it.”
The woman leaned forward in her chair with a vaguely smug smile. “I wouldn’t worry if I were you two about our acceptance rate. On top of the fact that we like to take diverse children from diverse family situations, we pay special attention to the legacy of parents.”
Draco followed Harry’s gaze curiously before breaking out into another signature Malfoy grin. “Hungry for more?”
An unflattering snort left Harry and he turned the shade of his House. “I would allow it,” Harry permitted through a rising pulse. Their drinks were delivered and Harry jumped on his, sucking down quite a bit.
It smelled delicious enough to fool anyone who hadn’t drank this particular mix, but Harry knew all of those wired and sugary flavors packed quite the punch.
Draco himself was terrible with any uncomfortable physical sensations. He bruised like a peach and always held a sour attitude when he was in pain, unlike the blissful release it seemed to bring for Harry when administered properly.
On the other side of the grounds, Lily had found a hiding place behind a statue of some great-great-great-grandmother of hers that had convinced her Malfoy husband to show his affection for her by ordering giant marble pieces for her favorite part of the Manor. She also made him buy her a new statue every time she caught him cheating, but Lily didn’t know that.
Draco cracked a smile. “Good.” He went back to the mirror to fix his hair so it looked carefully disheveled. “And I’ll text you when I get there.”
Harry and Ron both stood, confused. “What’s going on here?” Ron asked, at least ten thousand percent sure that Lucius had flipped sides to being a Death Eater again. This was a shit time to do it and break his buddy out of jail, too.
Draco shrugged. His father would want them to name the kids after constellations, so that was out of the question entirely. “If it was a boy? Hm… I like Evan, Maxwell, Parker, Chase, and Augustus.”
“Harry,” Draco said as he sat in the chair across from him. “What is going on in your head right now? I can see smoke coming out of your ears.”
Draco hollowed out his cheeks and sucked hard. His nails dug into Harry’s hips, sure to leave bruises.
Harry kissed his sternum while he slid Draco out of his sweatpants. He really did love mutual fake sick days. “You’re not even wearing pants,” Harry laughed. That sexy bastard. He’d known that they would shag all along.
The crowd went wild. Martha went something beyond wild. “Yes!” she called out immediately. “Yes, I’ll marry you, baby!”
She’d left a note for when Draco and Harry got back from work to find their mother hen had flown the coop for a walk among the unwashed masses.
Their shovels hit the hard, untilled ground with difficulty, as expected. Not even the rotting leaves could soften what winter had chilled so many times without being tended to. Still, Harry and Ron dug.
“Shoes…” Draco took a moment to think and tap his pointed chin. “Black Oxfords, silk socks. While you fetch that and escort him to his dressing room, my good man, I’ll shop for myself because I need a change of clothes as well.” And Draco didn’t trust anyone but himself with his appearance.
“That bad?” Harry asked of himself, lifting an arm and finding that unfortunately true. “Ugh, sorry, I haven’t had much time…”
A little ‘ding’ came from the tab where Harry still had his Facebook open. “It’s one of his friends,” Harry said, surprised. “’Hello, Harry. I can confirm that Chris is who he says he is because we went to high school together’.” Harry paused. “I think we literally just proved them wrong.”
But Draco could, was how that sentence ended in both their minds. It made Draco’s heart beat faster. “Ever since we started ‘this whole thing’ as you refer to it, I’ve found you quite easily excitable,” Draco went for the low-hanging fruit of jokes.
"But I bet you'd rather hear about how they settled down. Who really cares how much they screwed around from age eighteen to twenty-six? Or who they screwed around with? I certainly don't care. The past is the past, right?" Draco was screwing around with Harry now. That was all that mattered.
“It’s better than nothing—oh, fuck.” Clacking heels were rapidly approaching down the hall. “Harry, you wear it. I’ll distract them.” Draco ducked out of the cloak and Harry crouched down low to the floor just in time for Narcissa Malfoy to come around the corner.
Draco’s character reappeared in the town he had been questing in before he had queued in the raid-finder. Everyone from casual players to hardcore gamers used the raid-finder to assemble random groups of twenty-five that would work together to conquer a common enemy.
“I called the bank,” Harry pointed out, looking at Draco instead of his camera. Harry would have forgotten the camera was there in the first place if it weren’t for the red light it displayed when recording. “It’s your turn to make a call now. You know what
Lucius, as usual, ignored nearly everything that came out of his cousin-in-law’s mouth. It wasn’t that he had any extreme dislike for the man, it was just that Lucius always knew best. “We can figure that out
Draco hummed knowingly in response, sliding an arm around Harry’s waist beneath the water. Was he just letting his father get to him? Draco always experienced some sort of angst when there was overlap between what he wanted and what his father wanted.
“Please!” Harry cried out while Draco was waxing poetic in his head about how their rivalry had brought them to this.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. Draco was such a shit. “That’s because you’re my new favorite thing. Er, person, I mean,” Harry doubled back on. “Certainly my favorite and my only Daddy.”
The flag rippled in the virtual wind as Harry chased him down. Spells were being hurled left and right, but they all soared past the two mounted heroes.
If Remus were to tell the truth, it would be that wherever the two went, people were all but throwing their children at them. Their fans would give anything to have their child raised by the great, the powerful, the newspaper-dubbed ‘Drarry’. Instead, Remus gave a half-truth.
Draco watched at the foot of the bed, mystified. Every time Harry seemed to cringe away from one body part in pain, another would be affected by the ropes wrapping tighter around him. Oh, Harry was a genius for this one.
“You’ve done nothing wrong,” Draco assured him quickly. Now that the Farmer’s Market was behind them they had nothing but open fields around them, and a long walk back to the Manor. “I was simply thinking. About my friends, specifically. You want to know something?” Draco chuckled. “Pansy encouraged me to reply to your ad. I think she’d faint if she knew what she was actually pushing back then.”
“Potter,” Lucius finally said airily, breaking a tense familial silence. “You may follow us this way to the dining room.”
Harry saved the bloody world when he was seventeen, and she barely had it together at twenty-two. Rachel had hidden in Bulgaria with her parents during the war’s duration. The whole thing was a sort of dreary blur, except for when the radio announcement came.
Harry rested his bruised body for a moment. “You know, Sir, just because I’m being a sap doesn’t mean I don’t want you to keep punishing me.”
Remus and Sirius exchanged looks. They knew how to plan wordlessly and communicate solely with head nods from all the sneaking around they’d done in Hogwarts. “Harry,” Sirius said gently. “Did you ever take Muggle Studies at Hogwarts?”
Zeke paused to lean back in the opulent chair of Narcissa’s parlor. He chose his next words carefully. “I think maybe part of that anger is that you lost your mum so early.” Grace froze up, breath catching in her throat. “And I don’t know how it could affect this kid to never know their biological parents. It’s not because Draco and Harry are gay, it’s not because I want to have us both stop our lives and be teen parents, and it’s definitely not because I ‘hate you’. I don’t hate you, Grace. I want the best for this kid and this is me stepping up.”
“Doesn’t matter,” he shrugged. “They’re not my best mate and you are, you secretive prick. You need somebody to talk about this stuff with. The job has fallen to me. Now, tell me what constitutes sex between two blokes; more specifically, between you and him.” ‘Him’ was better than ‘that prat Malfoy’, and Ron really had come a long way in terms of acceptance.
“The homophobia one.” Draco motioned to it on the screen like a Roman king would motion to a near-dead gladiator he wanted to spare in the coliseum.
Sliding in a second finger, Draco watched in awe as Harry adjusted in his relaxed state, eyes half-lidded and legs still wantonly spread apart. Draco curled the two digits up inside him, sighing at how tight Harry felt.
“Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini—and what about Goyle?” Harry would never forget how his heartrate spiked when he saw Draco flanked by Crabbe and Goyle as a kid, for it meant Draco was coming into the conversation cocky and confident.
Harry’s eyes drifted up to the man before him. On his knees was where he looked his best. Draco’s neck looked even longer that way, and the lines where his collarbones were seemed heavenly from the angle Harry was at.
“Don’t be. Your heart’s in the right place, yeah?” Ron told him. “And we don’t have to talk to him today or tomorrow. The last thing I’d want is to bother him while he’s already literally torn himself to pieces.”
Lucius led in the family lawyers early that morning—which to an old man like Lucius, meant six in the morning. Harry had answered his knock on the door in slippers and Draco’s pyjamas, glasses askew on his face.
From the couch, Grace watched her third soap opera marathon that day. “Television is a valid art form,” she told him as the secret twin on the television attempted a seduction of her boss.
“You,” Pye began. “Are in a world of trouble. This institution is a respected one, a revered one among wizards. Like I said, people risked their own reputations to bring you on as a Healer here. Healer Nagelhout? Healer Chapman? I would imagine they’re feeling mightily embarrassed now.”
With a lively, animated voice Draco described hobbit holes and the other quirks of Middle Earth while Harry finished his milk. It went down easily and made his skin prickle with warmth.
Taking a lap around the room and its many empty shelves as he waited for Harry, Draco admired all of the hard work they’d put into this place. He would always remember it as the place where Harry helped him out of his indecision. A lot of things in this house were becoming associated with Harry, a prospect that was as exciting as it was scary.
Her stubby house elf awoke from his nap in the foyer with a start. “Y-yes Madam!”  If he was caught sleeping again, he knew he’d get the cane. His tiny feet made like the wind in order to avoid such a fate and zipped to the front door where the newspaper was deposited in no time.
“No, the closest muggle one. He was skilled, trust me. Then we went to a dessert place, and then…” Draco paused for dramatic effect. “Back to my place. And from there we spent the week together.”
Draco couldn’t exactly discuss his hard-on for Harry James Potter only to have it broadcasted on MTV to millions of teenagers who would doubtlessly slander him on the web for it. Those who didn’t slander him would get far too into it, and fan-art and erotic stories would pop up like weeds between the cracks of the internet.
After removing the glasses he’d accidentally fallen asleep in, Harry decided it was time to help out his slumbering lover. Draco hated waking up with those indents everyone got from falling asleep with tight clothes on, and Harry would much rather see him out of the pants anyway.
“The patient in 394 was responding successfully to the potion, but we looked away just a moment and then all of this—this blue stuff was coming out! I’ve never seen anything like it!” she exclaimed.
The two voices stopped as two Healers stopped dead in their tracks upon seeing Healer Malfoy enter the stairwell.
“Malfoy,” he introduced himself, one hand wrapped protectively around his coffee mug while the other extended to offer Harry a handshake. “Draco Malfoy.”
Draco didn’t really know to answer that. If he answered honestly, he was making a list in his head of all the things he liked about his new boyfriend, but something told him Snape didn’t really want to hear it.
“And upon further inspection I must admit I do really like these,” Harry nodded of the lavender undergarment. He kissed the bulge in them experimentally, happy to hear a slight hiss from Draco when he did. Harry wanted to be worthy, wanted to prove himself skillful enough to keep around. “I think I might like them better off of you, though.”
In what would have normally been an embarrassingly quick time, Harry came and made that mess Draco had asked for. As his body lit up with sensations and sparks of pleasure, he emptied himself all over Draco’s hands, sheets, and his own shirt. Why hadn’t he taken his shirt off?
“Creatrix. ‘Trix’ for short,” Narcissa announced proudly. Finally, she had another woman in the house.
“So you’re saying you’d want to see me and some other man…? Salazar, Gin. I never realized how kinky you were.”
A warm, pleasant feeling spread across Draco’s face, the whiskey finally hitting. “Hey, gorgeous,” Draco greeted Harry like they hadn’t been sitting here for a solid fifteen minutes together. “Gimme a kiss.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry replied even though the beautiful, particular man who came in every morning looking half-dead until he got some caffeine into his system never thanked him. Not once.
“I’ll need a cart,” Harry said with confidence upon hearing all the variety of set dressings he could purchase. The clerk looked delighted.
“You are capable of great things, all of you,” Draco insisted. “And I cannot wait to see them. My office is open to you all especially as my house and my responsibility. Even if you simply need to talk, I will be there to listen. Teenage years can be… tumultuous, to say the least. Know you are never alone in this journey to becoming fully-realized witches and wizards. I am here for guidance, assistance, instruction, and to keep you from making the mistakes that I did. Are we clear?”
Sure, some kids on the server were still a special kind of Warcraft stupid—or hadn’t known they’d picked the queer server when they signed up for the game—but for the most part they were bearable human beings.
Harry taught Draco a palm-reading technique that their high school psychology teacher Dr. Trelawney had shown him after class once. Draco laughed and denounced them both as insane, but kept his hand in Harry’s for the rest of the flight. Apparently, Draco had a long ‘love line’. He made dick jokes for a solid five minutes after that, and Harry couldn’t exactly disagree with how proud Draco was of his endowment.
In all honesty, Draco was holding out his hope for Rachel coming back to the hotel and telling them she’d changed her mind. That hope died when he saw the final candidate walk through the door.
And they were a sticky, sweaty mess, their breathing still uneven. Draco kissed Harry’s lips anyway, ignoring how his come had covered his chest.
“Good morning Professor Malfoy,” the golden boy greeted. He had sausage and scrambled eggs on his plate, pausing from eating them to give Draco a friendly smile. Suspicious. “Perhaps you can settle a scholarly debate for us.”
“It would be a lot simpler if they just revealed our relationship, that we can explain, but the nature of which this relationship came about… It’s violating, having it revealed,” Harry admitted with frustration. It was all to sell papers for that Rita Skeeter, too, a bug that Harry wished had been squashed a long time ago.
“Uh,” Draco stammered. “Well, yes, I can sing. Most people can, it’s just the quality of tone that’s the issue…”
Who even was this kid? He was on the underclassmen field hockey team from the looks of his jersey, but he was neither attractive enough nor talented enough for Draco to have remembered from any sports. His black hair was oily.
In silent protest, Lucius wrote down the alarm code on a nearby notepad with a flourish of his jewel-encrusted quill. They would change it over his dead body.
“You know what—“ she cut herself off. “I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to hear any of it. Harry, Draco, I want to leave.”
Draco could not properly articulate how little he cared about magic laws in front of muggles, but he did it anyway. It beat being arrested, even if his husband could bail him out in record time. “Fine.” Draco took the stroller and ushered it into a private clinic room, giggling baby girl still inside.
Harry laughed. He couldn’t help it, Draco just looked so petulant when he wanted something and wanted it immediately, like a spoiled kid.
The hat laughed above him, ruffling his hair. “You are, but you’re not. You have their curiosity and their inner strength, but you prefer a quieter life.”
Harry was always willing to speak the language of rivalry and bets with Draco Malfoy, especially now that they’d formed a tenuous truce between them. One could even say that this was them getting friendly.
The room where Marcus was being held went completely dark. A quiet and distant cry was heard from the room, but that was it since they turned the microphone off.
The other end of the line went quiet. Draco was sure that ‘Emmett’ was going to back out and cut the story short until he spoke up again. “Alright, yeah. Alright. I do… I really do want to see him.”
There were probably kids out there who were in favor of wars between countries and groups because their parents were. They’d never get on the battlefield themselves, but they would stick their noses up in the air in history class when their opinion was asked for and say: ‘Sometimes, war is necessary’.
Without warning Draco pushed in a second finger, making Harry’s toes splay out in surprise. Before Harry could properly adjust Draco pushed in a third and was met with a tight, involuntary clench. “Touchy, touchy. And here I thought you wanted it rough.”
Draco dealt with sick people all day, too. Sick people, his father, his mother, his friends, and his husband had divided his attention almost beyond repair. How a child would change that was starting to scare Draco. In the distance, he could hear Harry and Lucius' arguments being quieted by his mother.
Eric Sinclair and Aiden were attached at the hip ever since they met in first year. Born into a conservative family, Eric was a rebellious gay kid who never had a chance until he met his new friend from wizarding school’s parents. Draco and Harry had for all intents and purposes become his replacement parents.
That didn’t seem to matter to Alex, though. He was the first one to lie down and watch the clouds roll by after their game of tag had tired him out. It had really been more like Olivia tagging him and Alex giving up, but that was beside the point.
“So you two did it on the beach?” Colin laughed. He knew from experience that sandy sex had some tragic results.
Harry hadn’t even considered that sort of danger. He was messing with people’s personal lives on television—admittedly to share their experience and with the intention of helping them—but it just struck him in that moment that some of them wouldn’t take it so well.
“Yes, undoubtedly,” Harry answered, his own smile shaky but present. “I have never known such love, the kind that heals like his does. He is the last person on earth who deserves this kind out outing.”
Draco’s smile got even wider. “Alright,” he said in a voice that indicated they were starting the adult tucking-in. Draco gingerly removed Harry’s glasses to set them down on the night stand before pulling the covers back on Harry’s side of the bed. “After you.”
“Okay!” Draco piped up and clapped his hands together in that way that annoyed Harry so terribly. He always did it when he was planning to leave a situation or trying to cut someone off.
Grace was almost offended by the questioning before remembering she was in no position to be offended by someone who had taken her into his home and life for the next few months. “I’m sure,” she answered in a solemn, serious tone.
Everyone involved was so eager to get the search over with that they all lunged to brush the loose earth off of the metal box.
“I never really saw doctors,” Harry shrugged. “Or much of anyone. I didn’t have friends, or many teachers in school I could trust. Dudley was a menace when he was younger, too, having told all the other kids in town I was a weirdo. He mellowed out around our sixth year but by then I wasn’t even staying with them. Dudley grew out of the homophobia, too, thankfully.”
“Percy Ignatius Weasley,” Molly stopped him, and that seemed to carry more weight than Arthur’s attempts. “I
Colin sighed and gave him a kiss on the shoulder. “Another nightmare about that McCain bloke being elected president of the states?” he asked teasingly.
Hope you’re all enjoying this as much as I am! I promise to keep updating, I promise I have an ending in mind for this one and it’s a long ways away. This one is for Nessa, and they know why. I love you, Valentine.
“See? You’re a complete dick!” Harry pointed out. “Maybe you’ve got something constructive to say but there’s no way anyone will listen to you when you’re such a dick.”
“With respect,” Harry said as if it were obvious. “You should be valued by the men you date and they should know that they’re lucky to have you.”
Thankfully Draco’s friends were a significantly easier crowd to please than his parents, so the pair of old school rivals were having quite the nice, if a bit rowdy, evening at Pansy’s house.
Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was a romantic in the strangest of ways, and they often came out as commands more than requests. Still, he ignored the slight burn in his backside and stood, opening his arms to Draco and looking to make an amazing night even better.
Harry could hardly believe it. Was Draco really right about the clothing thing? He opened his mouth to reply when the blonde himself cut Harry off.
Hook, line, and sinker. Harry thought she would be tougher to crack, really. Prison seemed to have dulled her senses. “What?” he asked, annoyed.
As much as Draco and Harry appreciated and respected the opposite sex, they were getting tired of looking at women when they wanted to be looking at each other.
Draco turned to Harry and searched his features, smiling. “I think that will impress my friends even more than your identity. I haven’t had anything serious in years, and I was beginning to wonder if I’d become allergic to it.” Draco pretended to sneeze just to be an arse.
Theo frowned. That sounded heavy and hardly as scandalous as sex trafficking. “Oh. Is he alright with that?”
Draco’s face went bright red and then the laughter came. He sighed, taking it with a stiff upper lip and an arched brow.
“Yeah? You like this?” Draco teased because of course he did, Harry looked like a man possessed with the way he twisted against the sheets in response to Draco. “You like having a man open you up while you’re dressed like this, covered in your own mess?”
When he reached between Harry’s legs Draco gave his balls a teasing tap with the crop, gentle but more than enough to make Harry squirm with fear. He’d taken a few Bludgers to the groin in his Quidditch career and he wasn’t eager to relive the feeling. Maybe something less painful could be fun, but for now he wasn’t even sure how the crop would feel on his regular skin.
“Yes,” Draco hissed. “Yes, that’s it—“ He was cut off by a moan when Harry circled his thumb around the tip, spreading the precome there and letting it dribble down the sides of Draco’s thick cock.
Draco could tell from the first time they kissed that Harry was starved for attention—not the kind he got in the Daily Prophet, either. Real, physical contact with someone who wanted to spend their life next to him.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco assured them. Something within him was willing to work around the limitations of galleons for a boy who seemed destined to choke on a golf club. “I can get this little guy an appointment.”
Prompt is “Drarry chasing their first kid around the grounds of Malfoy Manor” from lightacandledontcursethedark on tumblr. :)
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Harry laughed right back. He loved how they could do that; laugh during sex. After all, Draco’s penis was in his bum. It was all very ridiculous and didn’t deserve as much seriousness as the world seemed to give it.
“This way is my room,” Draco said and brightened noticeably once he had something else to show he was actually proud of. Draco opened the double-doors with a swish of his wand and stepped inside. Being in here made him feel safer, more secure than ever. The bed was made perfectly, and the bookshelves around the room were perfectly-aligned. “The best room in the house, obviously.”
If Snape squinted his already beady eyes then he could see a young James sitting right there in front of him. The fashions had changed and Harry was thinner but he had James’ stupid jawline and his defective eyesight, which made their faces near identical under the glasses.
“While it would be fun to see you fumble with one,” Draco admitted, lighting the tip of his wand and holding it before Harry’s eyes. “I’m testing your reflexes here. Try and keep both eyes on the light.” He moved the wand back and forth slowly, watching how Harry’s eyes twitched to attention trying to follow it.
“I’m using my laptop this time. Yours is slow as hell,” Draco decided. The door to their room was sealed behind them and while no cameras were currently on, the sooner they shot themselves picking the next Catfish the sooner they could get in a plane and continue to not speak to each other.
“A headband,” he whispered. “A headband cooked into a biscuit. That… Madam, that is a choking hazard for the children.”
Draco was sick of teenagers, but he turned down Fleet Avenue anyway. The next homeless shelter was coed and mostly drug-addicts that left them with nasty magical side effects. A man with purple ears shuffled past Draco, so he figured he was going in the right direction.
“I don’t see what that has to do with anything,” Grace responded quickly. “I hate him. He’s an arse and a dick all at once and I dated him at one point. That’s it.”
“What’s you?” Draco demanded. He wanted to hear the man say it so there wouldn’t be any room for interpretation.
Hermione smiled a little more tensely. “And only two months until the beauty of childbirth,” she reminded him. The last time hadn’t given her any reason to be overjoyed. “And then, never again.”
It was a charming town—the sort Harry would want to live in. It was small enough for there to be a strong sense of community but large enough to not have any neighbors breathing down his neck. The schools were beautiful on the outside from what Harry could see from his seat and most likely run by gay parents.
“But you cared about what your family thought of you and you came out in high school anyway,” Harry protested. He had originally intended to use the fact that Draco wasn’t brave as a counterpoint for the argument that coming out was brave—but now that he had gotten to know Draco better he didn’t truly consider him to be a coward.
“Er, nice to meet you,” Harry tried. “I’m—“ He stopped himself. No real names, but these were Susan and Justin from what he could recall of Pansy saying before. Wait, as in Susan Bones and Justin Goldstein? That strawberry blonde hair of Susan’s gave her away even years later. “I’m having the single strangest night of my life and I’ve been back from the dead twice,” said the savior of wizardingkind.
He beat her down the stairs, giving her another warm and comforting smile. Maybe if he tried enough of those, then Olivia would give up the notion of working for her keep like a tenant.
Draco used semicolons online. Draco feigned a gay lisp when he talked about things that he found silly and wanted to make fun of. Draco thought dragon dicks were the height of comedy and owned gaming-themed clothes.
“Drinks, drinks, who wants drinks?” He did not wait for an answer. Draco was the first to reach forth onto the table and pop open a bottle of aromatic red wine with his wand. Next with a wave of the unicorn-hair wand he poured out glasses of wine for everyone. He started with his father, then his mother, then Harry and then himself. “Let’s drink.”
“Mother, Father,” Draco greeted a bit stiffly. His parents were in their glamours and their best outfits. Draco knew them well. Father had all of his rings on, like they could guard him from truth itself.
“We’re living in sin,” Ron agreed. Even he thought making fun of straight people was sort of hilarious. It never happened outside of his friends poking fun, and it was altogether justified for the shit they’d put Ron’s friends through. “Hey, want to sneak into the Soho cinema tonight and watch some awful movies?”
Harry grinned. “You’re going to have to get used to things that don’t make sense, Dursley,” he teased. “Magic can do amazing things.” When he finished writing the address, he handed Dudley the paper. For some reason, he hesitated.
“Don’t worry, he gets off on humiliation so he wouldn’t mind me telling you. This is why I have a theory: It wasn’t someone at Safeword who sold you out. Call it a feeling, but I know this world and I know these people. I’ll owl you when I speak to them.”
Harry had magic cuffs around both of their wrists in seconds. What the hell had happened here? “You can explain it back at the station.”
Apparently Julian just never asked. It was a noncommittal climate and he figured he’d never see the man again after one sizzling hot night backstage at a night club.
“Well, we both liked the official Katy Perry fan page and we got to talkin’ on one of her posts.” It was incredible to see Ruth talk about Chris. Even though she’d never so much as breathed the same air as his, she twisted her blonde curls around her finger when she talked, totally smitten. “And I replied because he was cute, and it just kept going from there. He’s been with me through so much, he always is there to talk to.”
“So now you know not to mess with me, just like everyone in prison did. Do you understand what I’m saying, Alex? I’m saying that I may not have killed the Potters but that doesn’t mean my hands are clean of blood.”
They reached the second floor and Harry led Draco down the hall. “The guest bedroom needed a proper guest bathroom for when we have your friends or mine over,” Harry said, leading him through the guest bedroom Draco and he had designed together over the past week stuck indoors.
Dudley and he were cool now by way of some awkward bro-talk that was excruciating in the moment but at least gave closure. Petunia and Vernon were getting quite old, and the curse of being their only true son was falling on Dudley to care for them. That was punishment enough for any misdeeds he may have committed as a child.
Harry tilted his head to the side so he could sneak a kiss in against Draco’s temple. From behind them, the pack of kids giggled.
As if Harry could read his mind, he launched into a much less stressful topic. “Enough about the biological mother. Let’s talk names.”
“But I wasn’t. I was just sharpening everything down to a stump that I couldn’t use. You can’t add wood and lead back into a pencil,” she said plainly.
Harry and Theo were stunned speechless that Draco would rather throw the girl into the snake’s den than house her. Narcissa and Lucius beat out Harry and Theo’s protectiveness combined.
Draco wriggled his trousers the rest of the way off along with the shoes he’d worn in, their clothes as sprawled out on the floor as the pair of them were.
Harry approached the tail end of the device, figuring he’d read these in order of who sent them in first. So much for not being wanted—now he just felt overwhelmed. So many men had written back, but did any of them mean what they said? He really, really hoped his highlighting of the discretion necessary to make this work had only attracted those of like mind.
Harry blinked a few times in the face of the journalists before his senses returned to him. A lifetime in front of cameras had taught him to look beyond the flashes and upwards at the ceiling, which happened to be decorated with silver and gold streams of garland.
Well, she had them there. Remus and Sirius had thought that she’d take that as being able to read their books and eat their food, but it was true of this, too. “Yes,” Remus tried. “But I’m telling you that you don’t have to.”
A cold shiver ran up Harry’s spine, his toes curling in his heels. He’d had some, albeit more amateurish, spanking in his life from a man’s hand but never a toy on top of the bruises already forming from how damn hard Draco’s hand was.
Draco placed Harry’s hands onto the sides of the frame. “Hold on tight, sweets, I’m getting your ankles now.” Draco pressed his hands over Harry’s to make sure his grip was firm enough. He sunk down to quickly undo the remaining knots, freeing Harry entirely. “Stay still, stay still,” he warned until he rose, putting his hands on Harry’s sides. “Don’t try and move too quickly. Let me lead you.”
“I wasn’t planning on regaling your friends with the details of our sex life, no,” Draco chuckled, leaning into Harry’s kiss. “I am trying to gain their favor after all, not lose what little of it you’ve gained for me.”
The first two bags were robes and clothing for the closet and drawers, a lot of it indistinguishable at first because they were mostly black. There had been many Potionsmasters since Severus Snape but Draco would never forget his godfather’s tenure here at Hogwarts as the definitive Potionsmaster for years.
“Ah,” Harry recalled with a loving sigh, melting back onto his chair. He could see that familiar twinkle in Draco’s eye and knew where this was going. “Yes, the dining room. I didn’t even know my legs could go back that far.”
With one last glance at his good boy Draco closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift further and further off still, the words of the song playing in his head until he, too, was drawn into a deep, restful sleep.
There was a reason Harry never talked about Regulus with Sirius. His godfather was plagued with guilt for the way his brother died. In Sirius’ mind, he had let Regulus stay in that abusive house, so he was responsible for his becoming a Death Eater.
Harry beamed. He was taking to direction well, and every bit of encouragement from Draco that came after just made him more convinced to keep doing so. If Draco thought he was changing his mind about him after another night of sobriety he had another thing coming. “Thanks.”
And how damn good fresh eggs and bacon were. The both of them were reaping the joys of Draco’s cooking skills.
Conversation continued, staying away from controversial topics like unapproving parents or future admissions this time.
“Draco,” Harry murmured as he carded his hands through his damp hair as the other man kissed his neck.
“Lean in to me,” Draco requested and Harry did so without hesitation, presenting his face with his wide, trusting eyes front and center. Draco smiled and snuck in a kiss to his nose before starting to work.
do that?” Draco was speaking empathically but keeping his voice down. He had always been so expressive, and Harry’s last memory of him was as a stony-faced defendant on the stand. It had been so wrong, and it looked like that had been made right by how contorted Draco’s face was now. Draco blinked a few times. His eyelashes were so long. “I…” Draco’s mouth felt dry. He guzzled the pink drink and set it down clumsily. “You can’t tell anyone, Potter, you simply
“If you want to talk,” Harry said slowly to Ron. “You can send an owl here and we’ll schedule something like normal people. But tonight—you need to leave. Draco has work in the morning, and I have things to get done, too.”
I’m in the sort of mood where every song is about these two, and every story has a connection to them. I love fanfiction so much. Don’t ever let anyone shame you for it. Also yes I changed Teddy's heritage, I hate Remus/a woman.
Draco gave him a shove before checking to see if the other man was online. His stomach was full of macaroni and cheese, and he’d been sure to give the worgen ample time to deal with whatever real-life problem was going down before logging back in.
Harry made his way down the hall, hoping to go unnoticed. His mission was successful, but he knew the swarm was coming soon. If files had been leaked, then there was no doubt an appointment time was close behind.
Leaving his office and the buzz of crime being solved behind, he screwed his eyes shut and apparated to his front door. That way, he could surprise Hermione and little Rosie.
At the mention of the word ‘discriminating’, Luna Lovegood appeared seemingly out of thin air with her puffy blue dress. “Is he giving you any trouble, Harry? I could always talk with Headmaster Dumbledore.”
Draco picked up the DVD case and popped it open. It was unmarked, and they were contractually obligated not to show it to anyone who wasn’t involved in production. Draco would probably show it to Pansy and Theo later anyway just as Harry would show it to Ron and Hermione.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I almost wish I was attending a real party here. It’s nice and private, tucked away from the world and with masquerade masks maybe nobody would recognize us…”
“We’ve reserved a meeting room at The Halkin, and you can bring your mother or any family you like. My husband and I just wish to speak with you, and we are speaking with many young women like yourself.”
‘Our house’. Ron and Draco both could have cried for entirely different reasons upon hearing those words. Both men held back sniffles that went thankfully unnoticed by the crowd.
From his swivel chair, Draco watched in abject horror as his husband tried to soothe this complete stranger. “Yeah,” he added on to reinforce whatever Harry was going on about. “I have no doubt that you’ll find someone.”
Theo stood from his chair and could feel his knees shake when he dropped to the ground next to Colin’s chair. “I have something to ask you.” His teeth felt like they were going to fall out of his mouth.
Maybe she’d been having too much tea time with Remus and Sirius, but Narcissa felt sort of… sorry for the little thing as she hurried away. Even though she was hideous in every aspect, the Malfoy matriarch could still find some pity for her.
Their friendship was sort of destined because of how close their fathers had been in school, but many things had changed since then.
Once the doors were shut behind them there was no keeping them from one another. Draco kissed Harry silly, hands moving all over that cotton shirt of his until he found the tie for his apron in the back. Draco quickly undid the knot, letting the strands fall.
Draco knew who she meant by ‘us’. “You would have to somehow have broken into Safeword’s vaults if it were one of you,” Draco waved off, having already considered the possibility with Harry. “Or stolen my personal copy of the messages, which I have now burned.”
“He,” Draco started to his parents who amidst his thinking were waiting with baited breath. “Is. Someone who is good to me and good for me. He is someone who makes me happy, and yes, I… feel strongly about it.” Why deny it any longer? He’d been found out. “He lives in the Manor with me, he helps me build it… And his name is Harry Potter.”
“But you won’t listen to me now,” she despaired. “And I think you’d be really, really interested in this.”
Harry blinked a few times before trying to rub the exhaustion from his eyes with the back of his hand. “No one,” he said, casting his gaze away. “Has ever tucked me in.”
Draco took in a deep, long breath and Harry instinctively repeated the action. Draco smiled, hand coming up to smooth back Harry’s damp hair in slow, repetitive motions. “You were excellent. Truly,” Draco reminded him.
“Wow, that’s the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me,” Pansy joked, still feigning offense herself.
The hairbrush in her right hand was framed in pearls and adorned in diamonds. It had been a wedding present from her mother-in-law at Narcissa’s wedding that she had treasured as their approval of her marriage to their Perfect and Infallible son Lucius.
Harry’s grip on his thighs tightened, nails digging in. Sweat dripped down the back of his neck, body straining with each merciless pounding of his hips. “Draco,” Harry cried out, slamming up as hard as he could.
Blaise Zabini as Draco’s right-hand man took the liberty to laugh at the conversation he was overhearing.
“He could genuinely not have the money for a ticket, Draco. We’ve been over this, you were raised rich—“
Those were quickly off of his shoulders once he locked the door behind himself. All the other Healers would just have to live with it.
A heavy breath left Draco’s lungs. How had he found someone so perfect for his every dark twist in him? “On your knees in front of me, now.”
“I enjoy snogging you too,” Colin affirmed. He felt filled to the brim with some kind of light, and it showed. Colin was happier than he could properly say, so that light said it for him.
“Yes, that’s it…” Draco sighed, leaning into his touch. It almost hurt to have Harry work out his muscles with such strength, but slowly the muscle loosened its clamped grip and relaxed under the machinations of Harry’s hands.
“Tracy Lethenbacker. Please, call me Tracy, Harry. Your handsome doctor friend never does. Aren’t you two looking good enough to eat? He a doctor too?”
Then they came in—the first years down the center aisle led by none other than Deputy Headmistress Aurora Sinistra of Astronomy. She set the first years in a line by alphabetical order in a hurry. “Make way, make way, we will first hear a few words from the Headmistress.”
Dragonis and his silvery blonde and decidedly virtual hair mounted his proto-drake, taking to the skies. The green dragon flapped its fearsome wings while Draco’s character rode on its back. Using his mouse, Draco could adjust his character’s view of the horizon. He searched the grasslands for some Alliance dog he could swarm when his eyes finally landed on one unlucky worgen.
“Rightfully so,” Draco nodded. “I’ve had my fair share of shit relationships and I know how they end up after someone breaks the trust. Then it’s just question after question about everything that happens.”
Ron and Hermione knew about them, Draco’s friends knew about them, and that meant it was only a matter of time until those two worlds collided entirely. The only safe space that could happen in private was the Manor, and it was, in kinder terms than Draco would put it, unfinished.
Harry felt more invested in the success of this relationship than was his place. He stood tensely next to Alvaro and prayed it was something Alvaro could forgive.
“D’you think he’ll be able to make it to the toilets before he throws up?” Harry asked Draco in a moment of calm before the storm.
“Well,” Harry replied, putting his hands on Draco’s waist. He felt warm there, and strong. “I seem to recall from high school that you used to be able to concoct quite a revenge scheme when someone wronged you.”
“They know it’s trash but they like to keep connected to England! They order two other papers, too!” Why was he defending his parents’ choice in tabloids? They had far more pressing matters to worry about. “Harry,” Draco refocused. “I have to go right now. I have to, I have to get dressed—“
Draco had gotten forgiveness in stranger places when he asked for it, though. Potter had given it to him without him even asking, an act that still stupefied him to this day. That selfless, compassionate bastard. Probably did it for the good karma points. That, or survivor’s guilt, but that was a much less funny concept bordering on frighteningly real for Draco as well.
Merlin, Draco loved this woman. Shrewd, shrill, and self-indulgent to a fault—they would have really made a wonderful arranged marriage like Lucius had hoped for if Draco was somehow straight. “So, where are you taking them tonight?” Draco inquired, walking her across the lobby.
“That’s right, Daddy’s here…” Draco snapped his hips back again, and again, establishing a brutal pace right out of the gate. To feel Harry squirm beneath him, to feel his walls clench and tighten around each thrust, was more special than Draco and his aristocratic vocabulary knew how to articulate.
“Draco…” Harry whispered, fully content to lay here and snog Draco into the next millennia, but they had business to discuss first.
“Stay still,” said Draco as he began a prowl in a circle around Harry, around the stool he’d been sitting on. Draco pulled it out from behind him and put it back underneath the counter, eyes on the prize the whole time: Harry’s beautiful arse. “Oh, yes, now there we go.” Draco slid his hands down Harry’s bare back, slow and steady, until they came upon the globes of his arse to squeeze and fondle them.
“Obviously. That’s why I’m getting some rest; I don’t want to look like a zombie on the first day.” The way Draco snarled that out definitely implied Harry was going to look like a zombie, which only fanned the flames of his anger.
Draco shook his head. How could he ever explain this to his father? “It’s nothing. I’ll get over it. Please, don’t be worried.”
“Second to Fourth, meaning I need to finish the fourth floor. Ugh, there’s just so much that needs to fit in here to please father…” Draco cleared his throat when he realized he sounded like a kid again, stuffing his face with spaghetti in quiet embarrassment.
“Excellent. Then onto our second matter of business, and that will be winning this year’s House Cup.”
Draco left Harry’s shirt on, more focused at the task at hand. There would be countless nights to explore every inch of his body, to see what spots made him whimper and to hear how he liked to be spanked and talked dirty to, but this was a frenzy. Draco was on a mission to make Harry come, to make his eyes roll back into his head and show him what being with Draco Malfoy was really like.
Harry loaded his plate up, shameless about his appetite these days. He was no longer the man who forgot and missed meals; he was eating damn well with Draco. Their cookbook was ever-expanding with more and more pages as they looked up recipes or ate takeout meals and tried to replicate them. “Draco and I cook together a lot,” Harry tried again.
“No,” she laughed, never having read that paper after the war. “I mean, people you’ve met. Even if it’s for a second or two. Before I came here, I asked around. Shop owners, friends, family, and more had seen you or met you at one point or another. I don’t know if you remember her, but my sister, she made a domestic call to the Auror department.” Rachel turned to Harry. “You arrived on the scene and you hexed the living shit out of that bastard who had her under his spell. Literally. He gave her a love potion. Then, you checked up on her every weekend to make sure she was doing alright.”
“We can tell Ginny how proud of her we are later,” Molly said with a knowing smile. Her daughter’s face in papers for being talented and in a star-studded relationship was much better than the rumors that had haunted her after Harry broke up with her. “Now, we eat.” There would be more than enough leftovers.
A smile floated across Draco’s face. “Here.” Draco handed Harry the stack of cards along with a kiss on the cheek.
“I didn’t have much to say,” Harry admitted with a little grin, slowly turning to face Draco. His robes moved with him, his best pair of them, though Malfoy didn’t need to know that. “I’m glad you’ve brought your talents to Hogwarts.”
He shook his head and looked away from the way Eric’s fluorescent hair looked resting against his pale skin, like a purple mist sweeping across him and forever cloaking him.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Let me guess, you want to play truth or dare?” It was well-known that Pansy was an expert at the game and its number one fan. In her opinion, if games didn’t leave other people vulnerable or humiliated, there was no real point to them at all.
“It was Harry’s idea we come here together in the first place,” Draco added in his partner’s defense. “Right, Harry?”
The opposites-attract dynamic Theo and Colin had honestly made Draco feel sick to his stomach. Colin was honey-sweet and his smile lit up a room. In essence, he was everything that Theo was not. Innocent, optimistic, and bright to Theodore’s jaded, pessimistic, and general brooding.
She was sitting in the Charms classroom and laughing, and out of frame was probably Marlene or Dorcas or Alice or anyone, really. Even though the Marauders were about as cool as a sack of soggy chocolate frogs, Lily was still popular as ever.
“Yes, Harry?” he replied, breathless. Why was it so hot in here when nobody was even on the dancefloor?
Draco looked up from the rubbish bin to check the clock as a countdown to his doom when he noticed Harry’s leering. He narrowed his eyes, scaring Harry’s eyes back down to the floor. What was wrong with that freak? When he wasn’t arguing against Draco’s ideas in class or giving him low blows about his family life, Potter looked like he was close to jumping his bones.
“Really?” Harry asked playfully, calling Draco on his bullshit by rolling his right sleeve up too fast for Draco to stop him. “Because I haven’t seen a scratch.”
By the time they touched down in JFK, Draco and Harry were sick of arguing with one another as much as they were sick of travelling so the conversation came to a gracious halt on both sides.
“It is not the thousandth time!” a man’s voice rang from the back of the house before he stepped out and revealed himself. He was smiling as he gave his sister a shove on his way to greet Draco and Harry. “I’m Alvaro, and—wow, you brought the cameras already—and do you want something to eat? Something to drink? The flight here can be murder.”
Before the other one could make any further arguments the one holding the door shoved him in. Masked but still managing to look skeptical were Ginny, Draco, and Harry staring down this new guest.
Well, that had gone spectacularly worse than expected. Who knew her aunt and uncle were capable of that much rage? It was like they waited all of Grace’s life to let their anger it blow up in her face at seventeen.
Ron sighed because he knew Harry hated it when she said that but it was true and right. “Look, I get ignoring us for a day, but twice in a row? Harry—are you even in there?”
“Well, I don’t agree with you,” Harry huffed before pushing his way back out of the bed and to their half-unpacked closet. “And it’s
“Yeah, all I need to see is your boner,” Draco teased and earning another elbow to his arm. “Ow! I bruise easily, you brute.”
“Then that’s all that matters to this reporter. As someone who knew you both in school I want to say on a personal note that I am so happy you two have found happiness in one another,” Luna said, earning smiles from both of the men. “What else would you like the public to know?”
“What?” Harry scoffed. “You’re the one who thinks he’s so great when you’re actually a complete jerk.”
“’After weeks of her accusing me of cheating on her when I wasn’t, I got sick of it all and broke up with her. Since my birthday was at the beginning of the relationship, I gave her my address to send a card. And I guess now’s a good time to mention we only live an hour’s drive away. I live in south Arizona and she lives in Kansas. After I ended things with her, weird things started happening around my house.”
As the world went fuzzy around the edges, Draco lifted up his phone as a beacon of clarity and went to Kingsley’s contact information. If he got this over with, perhaps he could spin the chair so fast it would take off like a helicopter and he could fly far, far away.
The tears couldn’t be helped, Harry supposed, but he still felt shame as they rolled hot down his cheeks. This warmth, this beautiful man whose bed he’d fallen asleep in—more than anything, Harry was embarrassed in front of him. He’d disturbed Draco’s sleep for nothing.
Harry tried to imagine Draco with a wife and children and almost laughed aloud at the thought. “You’re welcome,” Harry said, smiling even though it was such a dark thing to find funny because it would have clearly made him miserable.
“This is—“ Harry said and everyone went unexpectedly quiet. “This is not the outfit I was going to wear to meet you again,” he spoke of his t-shirt and plain trousers. It was all he could think to say. “Um.” He stood up, letting the cloak fall to the floor behind him in a heap. Harry put the vase back on the table and then turned around to face Lucius and Narcissa. “Hello.”
“I heard he’s quitting,” echoed a voice in the stairwell. “I’d quit too, if I was so publicly disgraced like that.”
“Bloody purebloods,” Ron muttered to himself even though he was one. “Never going to understand them.” After all, Marcus Nott didn’t have a soul as far was Ron was concerned. How had Lucius managed to draw blood from a stone?
“That’s my boy,” Draco encouraged. “My good, good boy.” Draco sealed the statement with an open-mouthed kiss, tongue exploring deep within Harry’s mouth. The raven-haired man suckled on his tongue, helplessly stuffed in both holes.
There were of course other Wizarding cities around the world but Harry looked quite foolish translating with his wand. America was never an option, and New Zealand and Australia were nice but ultimately unfamiliar. Harry decided to go with the one he knew, London, but apparently he didn’t know it that well at all. There was a mixed-crowd gay bar near his flat—go figure.
“And she can’t be happy sleeping around? Let me introduce you to a friend of mine, her name is Pansy Parkinson—“
Harry whimpered and bucked his hips up. If he didn’t get enough friction, Harry thought for sure he would lose his mind. “Draco, please…” His hand reached out to stroke Draco’s cock through the lace fabric in order to gain his favor.
Before Harry could as much as protest, they were gone. He was left dumbfounded in his kitchen, surrounded by relatives that only ever got along when the subject of children was a thousand miles away.
Harry turned around as he spoke. “Hey,” he replied eagerly before he really even got a proper look at the other man.
Harry’s glasses were fogged with the heat rolling off of them but Harry refused to look away from Draco. He stared him down from between his legs, eyelashes fluttering to show his appreciation while he continued to suck as hard as he could.
“It’s not like that, Harry. We just have to pick the best candidate. Okay, now here’s Rachel Priestly. She’s twenty-six, married her high school sweetheart, but he died a few days after they found out she was pregnant. Now she’s giving up the kid because she can’t raise it on her own,” Draco went on.
“That was something he said,” Draco continued. “Something about trying to get pictures of my ‘shenanigans’. If he really wants me gone he’d take the opportunity and run with it.”
“Then I bid you farewell,” said Draco, opening his office door and showing Pye the way out. Thankfully, he took it without bidding Draco the same.
Giving him a pinch for referring to him as a house plant, Harry managed to drift into the living-room with Draco.
Draco licked another stripe up and this time lingered around his hole in achingly-slow circles. Harry’s wispy sighs guided and encouraged Draco all the way, and came to a peak when Draco flicked his tongue deep inside the center of the puckered skin.
He fired every smiting holy spell he had at that slippery blood elf. The mage’s health declined as his did, but not nearly as fast. With a defeated shout, his werewolf crumpled to the ground in death. Fuck. Now he was going to have to spend some hard-earned gold on repairing his broken armor.
After the disgruntled bird flew away without so much as a conjured treat—Pansy really didn’t have time for shenanigans like that—she tore open the letter.
Harry pushed the fabric of his pants down low enough so he could also get Draco’s pants down. His cock wasn’t hard yet, but Harry could certainly fix that.
Harry and Draco, having both been holding their breaths, let the air rush out. “Damn,” Draco muttered.
Draco’ and had green dragons drawn in icing decorating the sides. “It’s been calling my name all night. And I need another drink.”
The battle was longer this time around. Harry’s swords clashed against Draco’s armor, the screen exploding in a flurry of spells, flashing lights, bolts of water—
“Drama queen,” Theo accused blamelessly. “Shut up and eat your Pad Thai.” Pansy had convinced her parents to bring her and her clique a gourmet meal during lunch time so they would have a better transition back into going to school again after weeks of relaxation.
Draco twirled the Malfoy signet ring on his right hand. It was supposed to be joined on his left by now with a pureblood woman if the Dark Lord had gotten his way. It was thanks to Harry that he could even live his life freely, openly as himself.
The mental image of the Head Healer of St. Mungo’s so much as drinking a butterbeer was absurd in itself. “Hardly,” Pansy answered confidently.
Draco waited until the baby had stolen Harry’s glasses to gently remind everyone that most of them hadn’t eaten in hours.
Without hesitation Draco sank to his knees in front of Harry, earning a breathy gasp from the other man along the way down.
Of course, Draco complied. He slid their lips together before running his tongue along Harry’s teeth. Harry’s mouth didn’t offer any resistance either.
At this point Harry was just buying whatever fit to shut Draco up, but that was giving him more than a few pains in his wallet.
“But I want to tell them,” Draco had to admit. “For more than it just being a gesture to show you how seriously I take our arrangement. I want to tell my parents about us because I want them to know someone important is in my life. I’ve told them about boyfriends before, you know. It’s just the ‘who’ of the matter that’s going to shock them.”
Lucius sighed. He knew what this was about; or so he thought. “I know that we’re supporting Draco’s actions, but I believe I’m entitled to privately disapproving.”
“What? I make one innocent joke and you’re already done with me?” she asked, disappointed. If Dolores were any younger, she would have tried a pout.
“Our Olivia knows what she’s doing. If she doesn’t want to kiss him back, she won’t. If she does want to kiss him, then she probably will. The girl is resourceful and mature for her age.”
Draco pulled off of Harry with a loud smack of his lips, picking the vial up again and spreading the thick liquid within all over his fingers. “If only the world knew,” Draco breathed, speaking as his index finger lowered back down, pressing to the split of Harry’s spread legs. “What a simpering thing you turn into when your Daddy kisses your hole. The Great Harry Potter, open wide enough for what’s next…”
The waitress returned with their dishes, laying each out in front of them full of tantalizing meats in generous spreads. Draco was half-shocked Hermione wasn’t a vegetarian with her bleeding heart but kept his snide comments to himself.
“Don’t you think everyone has a right to be young and stupid? So long as she does it in Hogwarts or at home, we can at least make sure she’s safe,” Sirius went on. “You can’t make her mistakes for her.”
“But really, Harry Potter as someone’s ickle little house boy, I’m reeling over here,” Theo emphasized. “You’ve described your ideal relationship to us several times, and knowing he fits that script? Fucking incredible.”
“Well, it is this. I mean, him,” Harry confirmed. Draco raised a brow. “Would it be too late to add a plus one?”
There were definitely upsides to living with your best friend. You got to see each other at weird hours of the night, you got to make food together, and you basically became brothers. Unfortunately, the downsides were seeing each other at weird hours, making food together, and becoming brothers as well.
“No matter what happens we’ll find out who Nina is—and the world won’t end. Even if she’s lying, you can learn from this and move on,” Harry tried. “Trust us on that.”
When he woke up the next morning in a cold sweat that haunted him for seemingly no reason, he found that his jaw had actually begun to ache from all of his teeth grinding.
“And they just—I don’t know—let each other cheat!” Harry told Draco, eyes wide with shock and general disgust. “It’s completely mad.”
“That means you’re on in five,” a person dressed in head-to-toe black told Harry. He had no idea who these people were backstage, but they were the sort of mix of stern and focused that he did not want to mess with. The head manager was named Minny something—that was all he knew—and there they were working together on live television where everything could go wrong.
If this were World of Warcraft, Draco would have to suffer under Harry’s blades. It was a violent thought, but there was also no such thing as death in WoW. Draco would respawn moments later in a huff and a large armor repair bill and nobody would be permanently hurt.
Draco swept his hands up Harry’s sides and came to rest stroking under his clean-shaven chin affectionately. “Utterly breathtaking. Do you like how you look?”
“Of course, of course. Wait, one more thing—you take this copy.” Rita handed the paper over the desk to him. He took it. “Because I’m about to have millions more.”
By hand he dipped each slice into the pie tin on both sides, coating them in the mixture thoroughly before transferring them onto the bubbling, greased pan. Cooking was much like making potions to Draco, and he’d always done well with those. It occurred to him when thinking of potions that he would need to owl Theo soon to see how business was going.
Harry had to think it was that and ignore the fact that Alvaro lived around more gay couples than Harry could count because if he didn’t—then that meant Alvaro was right. That meant that maybe there was something there between Draco and Harry, some sort of beast of unsaid longings growing between them, and Harry really, really didn’t know how to deal with that.
Pansy found that pun so delightful that she actually shrieked. “Blaise!” she yelled out, leaning up against her friend until her laughter subsided. “That—that is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard! Holy shit. Holy shit!”
“It won’t be straight away,” Harry assured Ron. “I mean, we have until October and I think Draco can get a week off of work to make sure you can adjust to it.”
A little laugh left Harry. “No, it wasn’t sex. We were picking out pregnant women we could adopt from.”
Once Draco was gone it was time to wash up, apparently. The bathroom was in the same blue palette as the guestroom, but there were much beachier accents in here. Shells on the curtains, for soap dishes, on the walls—Harry could even breathe in and smell the ocean from a charmed conch shell resting on the toilet. So many products, too. He didn’t think he was welcome to them, and used the soap sparingly.
Tiny fingerprints had smudged the glasses, but Harry didn’t mind. “Why, thank you. You kids have a good day, hm?”
Merlin, Olivia loved that. ‘Just a feeling’. How cool was that? “Then what breed is the one that looks like a cat?”
“Draco, she has nowhere else to go,” Theo hissed. He’d seen his best mate be callous before, but he’d usually been able to talk him down from his high horse. “It’s down to her and some other girl, right?”
Harry let his eyes flutter shut. Draco’s mouth was so warm and his head swam as he leaned into that warmth, letting it send chills down his spine.
Tom Riddle had always wanted his life, and Harry briefly wondered if that twisted man would have used this against him too somehow.
Harry moaned shamelessly as Draco’s cockhead ground against a spot that made him see stars. “I love it,” Harry replied through his strain. “I love being yours. Oh, oh—“ Harry cut himself off with a deep growl that simply had to be let out of him.
Draco spent the last few minutes of the thirty he’d given Harry standing at attention in front of the grand fireplace where the Floo was in the Manor. He counted down the seconds on his watch, comforted by the repetition of the numbers and the constant circular motion of the second hand.
“Pffft,” Draco laughed. “They can’t fire their best Aurors.” Especially if everyone kept their mouths shut.
,” Kennedy sighed. How many times did she have to tell him ‘Computer Face’ was not a witty nickname?
“Mhm,” hummed Harry, shamelessly nuzzling up to Draco as they walked towards the open doors to his room. “I was thinking of you.”
Since the situation had been broken down for Dudley without too much resistance, Draco considered himself the victor in the encounter. “Your kid is fine,” he reminded Dudley gruffly. “So I’ll be on my way.”
“Yes, I saw it laying out ever so inconspicuously,” Harry replied with a sardonic grin. He twirled some spaghetti onto his fork and sampled his work. He hummed too, quite pleased with himself. “The cookbook was appreciated, though.”
It would be a lie to say Lucius didn’t have that urge. A part of him still didn’t want to hear it and would much rather hide than face the truth, but a bigger part of him knew he had to be a guiding hand in Draco’s life. He was his father.
“I told him we’d be by the book stand,” Harry said for the cameras. For Ruth, he offered an encouraging smile.
Harry’s hands found their purchase in creating that sex hair of Draco’s he loved so much with they sunk to grasp the roots and meet his thrust. “Draco,” he groaned. He would take this slow on purpose, draw out every second of that beautiful look on Draco’s face.
Harry was going to share stories with the world and get answers for people who desperately needed them. It was not only a noble cause in his humble opinion, but an adventure with intrigue at every new twist and turn.
“Sirius is helping, too,” Harry told Draco to help reassure him. Harry would have been down there adding his own security measures of the Auror caliber if he wasn’t wary of the press returning with their questions and accusations.
“Can I get a statement from you on the rumors that you and Harry are trying to get pregnant through magic?”
“Rule Four: You must always be honest with your limits, and never push yourself to take more pain or kink than is sane for my sake. I know it’s a shitty word, ‘sane’, but ‘safe, sane, and consensual’ is a movement now, really. Sane, what does sane mean really?” Draco repeated, giving Harry’s hands another little squeeze.
“Your hours are more concrete,” Harry countered. “I can’t be on-call and leave the kid home alone. I like my job, sure, but I wouldn’t mind taking a break.”
“Then it looks like I’ll be putting some work in to open you up tonight,” Draco murmured and moved Harry’s glasses to the nightstand.
Draco nodded. “Yeah,” he said again, a smile flickering over his face. “We could have a little Aiden.”
Harry followed Draco into the walk-in closet and tried desperately to ignore the implications of doing that. What was going on? Who had told? “Who could have possibly—?”
His elbows rested on Draco’s strong shoulders. He prolonged the moments before the kiss so that he could capture that anticipation in Draco’s eyes.
Harry stepped closer to Draco to fill the gap between them. “Could you tell I was showing off?” Harry whispered in his ear. “All day, showing off to make you look,”
“Strange?” she laughed slowly, shakily. “Go fuck yourself, ‘strange’. You don’t get to be fucking quirky and clever when my mum is dead. I bet you think you’re so fucking witty and eloquent. I bet your stupid husband tells you that every day and you don’t even think about my mother.”
The man who’d been pushed in was younger, younger than Ginny even. Harry remembered being that young and depressed. “I,” started the man. “I have an invitation. To this.” He looked over Ginny’s shoulder trying to see within as he produced a piece of paper.
“Perfect,” said Harry. This wasn’t exactly how he’d imagined his friends and Draco’s friends coming together but he would be lying to say it wasn’t a little exciting. This kind of plotting took Harry back to his Hogwarts days when he was always up to something.
“…Malfoy and Potter,” Snape assigned, ignoring the squeak of annoyance from Draco. “Bones and Weasley, and that leaves Granger with Goyle.” He took a special sort of pleasure in torturing Hermione, too. If only she hadn’t befriended Potter maybe she’d be safe from Snape’s sadistic tendencies, but the girl who acted suspiciously like Lily Potter had forged a friendship with the boy who looked like James Potter. It spelled their doom.
Ginny was the first line of defense against the interlopers, but she wasn’t alone in the responsibility.
It took three showers in the employee locker room and several angrily-muttered spells, but Draco’s hair was finally clean enough to be up to his standards. He’d nearly scrubbed his scalp raw in the process, but it was all worth it to have that goop smell off of him.
That got a wicked laugh out of Draco. “Touché. Still.” He handed Harry another shirt in his size and Harry groaned.
Draco ran a hand through Harry’s thick and wild hair, sighing softly at how familiar it felt to him now. “Now that’s what I like to hear,” he said with a small, smug grin. “You like it rough, pet?”
“You,” said Pansy, a finger pointed square at Draco. “You are telling me,” she paused for a breath. “You have Harry James Potter, your painfully obvious childhood crush, tied up in the Manor somewhere
“But I think,” Draco said, thumbing his teacup. “I have to apologize to you. I’m sorry, Luna. For everything I did when we were younger.” The vitriol he’d spewed into everyone’s lives at that age was immeasurable, and he was sure Luna had less-than-pleasant memories of her forced stay in the Manor basement. He wondered if he should let her know he’d torn the place down.
Sirius rested his hand on Remus’ shoulder. “Do you know what I think you need?” he asked mischievously before curling his hand upwards to cup Remus’ jaw.
Slipping the ring back in his pocket, Theo made his way back to the front of the shop. He’d check on the potion in an hour like he usually did.
He went back to writing the explanation—admittedly using his phone to Google about half of the answers. Draco took to putting his lab gear away, leaving Harry to smile to himself about the angry red lines the goggles left on his face.
One of the few things that Draco and Harry could agree about was that jetting around was exhausting. They were quiet roommates out of respect for one another’s need for sleep. Hours in stagnant tubes being jetted across the sky with someone formed a camaraderie that at least extended to letting one another get basic human functions done without interruption.
Draco considered it for a moment. His parents couldn’t leave France, but maybe they could still see the new Manor in a way the Ministry wouldn’t throw them all away for. “A video tour, that’s a good idea. Yes, I know, it’s a muggle thing, hold your bile in, but look past your prejudice for a second. We could show you all the rooms we’ve built out together, and how the rose bushes are faring.”
“Tryouts will be at the end of the second week of instruction,” she announced from her clipboard. “Shall we head to the tower, Professor Potter?”
“Not in this weather, nah. Last time we tried that, Cooke nearly got electrocuted,” Ginny reminded him. “So, I’ll actually be at the flat with nothing to do.” Ginny wasn’t blind to their recent distance, either.
“He wants to meet Ruth, and I quote, ‘because she deserves the truth’,” Harry pointed out. At least this person wasn’t messing with their heads anymore. It was pretty clear from the text that ‘Chris’ knew the sham was over.
For the sake of efficiency, they decided to rule out anyone who was late. Both halves of the couple appreciated tact, and their baby’s future mother had to take the situation seriously to be seriously considered.
“I was there with one of my subs,” Draco nodded. “Louis, I think. I remember giving him a nice whipping for the way he looked at you when we saw you on the street.”
“They’re going to know you’re not a pureblood,” Tiffany continued. “You already showed up at their bloody house and told them your name. Professor Lupin taught during your mum’s time at Hogwarts. There’s no way they’ll be okay with that.”
Their lips met, their hands joined, and their hearts beat as one. In this post-coital bliss there was nothing they couldn’t do, and nothing they couldn’t accomplish together.
Harry looked over the Scotsman’s shoulder to see just what he was getting into and his eyes found—fancy golden buffet tables? He couldn’t tell what was in them at this distance.
Harry was quite pleased at how that little lie went over. Draco’s fussiness was legendary, and Harry was glad to see it work out in their favor for once.
When her cracked lips finally came back together she didn’t regret her decision. Sure, her throat hurt like hell and she still had a splitting headache, but Grace didn’t regret screaming.
“Benjy was an Order member, Harry. With your parents and with mine. This is about honoring the dead, and you know it.”
“And then there are the owls from my parents. One is due soon,” Draco spoke like one would of a coming storm. “I hope you understand why I won’t be mentioning anything about this in my upcoming reply.”
Draco laughed brightly, though not as bright as he could have. “Pretty well, I’ll say,” he said and squeezed Harry’s hand. “But Harry, we absolutely have to talk about—“
A pitiful groan escaped Harry’s mouth. Draco had only been rutting against him, but he was already hard.
Harry was also always forgetting how insane that sounded to outsiders. “I got my own room later, but mostly because the guest room had a lock on it and they could seal me in.”
Draco’s hand planted themselves on Harry’s chest, giving him leeway to push his taut hole up Harry’s length even faster. His arse cheeks jolted up and down in an uneven pattern with his thrusts, his arse smacking down on Harry’s legs whenever he pulled up on his cock.
Unfortunately, Pye caught Draco by the collar. “I don’t mean to intrude, but there is something I’ve been wondering.” Since in his mind, women were the sole caretakers of children (oh, how his own children would have daddy issues), Pye had been trying to rationalize two men adopting.
Tracy Lethenbacker was speechless. The entire romance in her head she had constructed around the well-dressed man at the market with his mysterious riches was dashed right before her eyes and replaced with something she found weird and unfamiliar. “Well. It’s,” she said, shaking her head as her face did its best impression of Mrs. Haberdash’s tomatoes. “It’s sure something.”
When those doors opened and Harry stepped through he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was trespassing on sacred ground. Draco was clearly willingly showing him, but seeing this room still felt sacrilegious. This was where Draco Malfoy slept, and that made Harry’s throat tight.
Draco smirked. He was flirting with danger here and didn’t have any intention of stopping. He’d talked dirty online before and it had led to some of the best fantasy situations—some better than the actual in-person sex he had—and a rush of endorphins.
a fifth year. Next year Remus would be seeing her for the sixth time around, and hoped that she could keep up with her homework schedule this time. “Miss Sato, what can I do for you?”
Draco was eating dinner at Pansy’s tonight so Harry made himself a sandwich and dined alone, trying not to think about it.
“That aside,” Remus continued as the corners of his mouth were tugged up into a smile. “I don’t think there should be a ‘we’ in talking about Draco and Harry’s child. We’ll support them in whatever they do.”
Some narrator’s voice told of the show’s premise, to ‘get to the truth’ and all of that noble bullshit Draco liked to roll his eyes at. “The truth was always depressing,” he recalled.
“What if I just stole a plate off of their table?” Ron asked them both conspiratorially. “What if I just walked over there and took one and said nothing? I think it’s sort of foolproof, you know? They wouldn’t know how to react for like ten seconds and I’d be able to get away.”
There was a chime in his earbuds. He was here, at 5:13, and the outside had rainbow lights spelling out its name in big letters: VELVET LOUNGE. Harry swallowed. Bars and clubs weren’t his thing late at night, hence the meeting time, as at night the people on the dancefloor were packed in and indistinguishable, a sea of potential unknown threats. Harry didn’t do crowds much anymore.
That made Draco laugh. “I don’t hold a prejudice against the color, no,” he confirmed. Draco stepped forward, allowing himself a moment of admiration for his work as well. Now that he wasn’t linked to Harry by arm there was the benefit of being able to look at him head-on for further admiration as well.
Harry and Draco had several of these emotional nights leading up to the ruse they were going to spring on the next in the line of villains in their lives. They swore to each other they’d get out in front of these homophobic scoundrels, whoever they were. An outing was bad enough but such an outing had been an act of pure bigotry and hatred, pointing at them with intent to shame.
“Yes, Daddy,” Harry responded eagerly. He positioned himself a little more on his side, trying to show himself off in the beautiful clothes Draco had given him.
“Do we need to do role call?” Lucius asked dryly. Goyle and his little Hufflepuff—was her last name Cabot? Rabbit?—had made the mistake of sharing kisses next to an already-bothered Lucius Malfoy. “Because you’re going to have to stop licking each other’s faces for that.”
“No, no, you got Selwyn.” For many reasons, Harry preferred to stay away from him. “I’ll interview her and get it over with.”
“Oh my god.” Harry’s laughter kept him from noticing the world around him for a moment, and he certainly hadn’t noticed that Lorraine had popped up on their screen.
“That,” said Draco as his arms moved up to wrap around Harry. “Was spectacular. Come over here, yes, come closer, rest on me.”
As her friend nodded and added a final topping of eyeliner on in the mirror, she was prepared to leave her bedroom in a whirlwind.
The flat seemed almost to be glowing and Harry had to blink to adjust to it. White floors and white walls with gold lacquer detailing shone brilliantly under bright, stylish lights hung from the ceiling that looked like dandelion puffs. The windows were covered in white panels with massive fountains in front of them—was that chocolate?
“Yes, sweetheart?” Fuck, if that word didn’t make Draco’s heart swell. He was hanging on Harry’s every word, and he would give him the world if he asked for it.
Draco stared down in awe at the strings of white covering Harry’s stomach around his softening prick, still shoving into that open hole.
“That at least you weren’t one,” Draco sighed, taking the shot from Harry and downing it in spite of the burn. Getting piss drunk was the perfect response to an afternoon spent with parents in Draco’s opinion. “It wasn’t the worst it could have been.”
He hated that since their son was fucking The Chosen One that they had gotten out of jail. Sure, their relationship technically started three years after Harry defended the Malfoy family in court, but those two pillowbiters probably had the hots for each other for much longer and much earlier than that.
Seeing how he’d shocked and terrified Harry’s innocent ears, Sirius patted him on the back. “He quit when he finally got with Lily—she hated the smell—but Remus and I had made quite a habit out of it all on our own.”
Focusing on his breathing did help, Harry had learned about himself in therapy. Harry was in control of his breath now, and in control of his hands as they hadn’t gone to tear out his hair once yet today.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. That cutting look in Draco’s eyes was quite something when he knew he wasn’t the target. “I mean, they did get charmed by Albus when they signed up to take care of me. It bound our blood and ownership of my fate until I came of age. They hated magic and really, really did not appreciate that.”
“You’re horrible. See, this is why you don’t know anything in this class—spending the whole time feeling me up.”
It was hard to keep the ad he’d sent in to himself. Just after sending it Hermione had made a surprise visit with treacle tarts from a bakery nearby—her way of letting him know she was worried about him. She meant well, she always did, but there was no way Harry could talk to her about this. Hermione could tell he was keeping something from her, too, but thankfully she hadn’t pushed too hard.
If so, Harry Potter was in the throes of one. “No. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t read! The words are blurring together, Draco. I think I’m going blind.”
“I hadn’t noticed,” Harry replied completely deadpan, brows raised. Draco laughed first and then they both laughed. Yes, Harry had seen him at his worst. “But I think you knew I liked them, too. Not the weird kid ones you came up with, but the way you said them.”
Clad in only a fur coat, coonskin hat, and being applauded as ‘the first rapper to ever, ever stand up for ‘the gays’’ (hint: he wasn’t even close to being the first rapper to support marriage equality, as there are actually gay rappers) Macklemore and his white bread face and piercing blue eyes gained the mockery of queer individuals worldwide.
Theo had seen that one coming, and spent the whole night preparing retorts. “You literally killed a member of your family. My mother. Are you forgetting that, or are you just mad after being locked up so long?”
“How about,” Harry offered, more eager than ever to get them out of their house so that the madness could finally be laid to rest. “We change it to something we’ll both remember that isn’t a birthday. Hm? Problem solved.”
All of the things Dragonis had said about his father, his family life, his problems—those all belonged to Draco.
Obviously, Harry had told him ‘no way in hell’ before continuing on with the interrogation, but Nott Sr. remained silent.
“Oh, now my onions are the finest around, just take a look at these beauties, these right here,” the man indicated. “Won’t find a fatter onion this side of the Prime Meridian than mine.”
Lucius didn’t really know how to interpret that. His son should certainly have high standards, but his son had also never had a boyfriend. Draco had never gone through the rite of passage that was Teenage Love that could prepare him for later in life. How was Draco supposed to know his type in college?
“Look! Theo, stop looking at the television screen. Turn that off; I’m much more important than Gordon Ramsey. Look! Here he is, I’m going to kill him!”
“Yeah?” Harry cracked a smile. “Sure, I’d like that. We just needed that week indoors to get, ah, reacquainted.”
“I got a girl pregnant!” Zeke reminded her a little desperately. “Time-outs don’t really work on me anymore, mum!”
Harry’s glasses were still on, fogged and askew as Draco fucked his face with no holding back. His own cock strained against his clothing, ridiculously turned on by Draco’s reckless abandon.
“It sounds familiar. It was something Sirius used to talk about in school, I can remember him at lunch saying something to me about it,” Remus remembered as he tried his hardest to wrack his brain. He plunged deep into memories of shaky hands around Sirius’ waist, laughing nervously when Sirius snuck a kiss in against his jaw after a full moon to assure him nobody had been hurt, and that everything was alright.
“Grilled cheese on Texas Toast,” the room service attendant dictated, handing the plate to Harry. “And a slice of dark chocolate cake.” That was for Draco, of course. According to him it was the dinner of champions.
There was a tense silence. The two Healers who’d been gossiping had eyes wider than saucers to see the subject of their gossip before them.
Draco fished his wand out of his discarded trousers and cast a spell to cover his hand in lubricant. “Something like that,” he grinned, trailing a finger down Harry’s cock and balls to reach back towards his hole. “But I’d like us to be even closer, wouldn’t you?” Draco eased in a finger and sighed at how warm he was.
“Oh, Ron,” she was blushing and glowing with excitement all at once. Ron was being sweet, and he’d gotten all of those gifts for her! “Of course I’m going to prom with you; you didn’t have to do all of this.”
Harry moaned, arching up into his touch. He looked down to see Draco’s head between his legs, tongue teasing his slit. Harry’s cock jolted with each flick of Draco’s tongue, his breathing becoming shallow.
Hermione, glowing with renewed motherly pride, never thought she would smile that hard at Draco. He’d gone from her tormentor to her confidant in a matter of years. Privately, Hermione couldn’t wait for Hugo and Lily play dates where she could sip champagne (oh, she missed fancy drinks) and gossip with Draco.
“Don’t worry,” Neville cut in as he filled his plate with warm and gooey pop-tarts. “I can get you two the best of everything. Luna and I are even selling to the Ministry for their whole ‘green initiative’ laws. Finally good to have a Minister who gives the environment the time of day.”
Narcissa clutched her teacup tightly. “Oh, Draco. That’s wonderful,” she soothed, sensing her boy was nervous to say all this.
With a pulse of regret, Colin pulled away to fetch his boyfriend some clothes. “You better haul your arse into these pants,” he said, tossing a randomly-selected outfit at the bed. “I don’t want to miss whatever fit Lucius decides to throw.”
? It was a cardinal sin, it was the height of uncleanliness and ungodliness, and Draco wouldn’t let it stand without at least insulting Chris. “Nice hat,” he drawled. Even Draco, in all of his phases and downright bigoted childhood, had never worn a fedora.
Harry felt motivated to add his own opinion to the clusterfuck of ideas that had sprouted in their parlor. “Look, I get it,” he sighed. “You’re in a messed-up place and things might not seem so clear right now. I’m sorry that your aunt and uncle did that to you.”
“Hm.” Draco turned out the light on the night stand before putting the book next to the empty plate and glass. He made sure to do it all with the utmost care so that Harry wouldn’t be woken up from the peaceful sleep he’d drifted off to, and Draco changed out of his clothes until he as just in an undershirt and boxers.
“I would never,” Harry said, acting incredibly offended. “Here, let’s go with something you already believe: Your lips are divine. After we snog they’re red and puffy, and they never fail to look delicious. Not ever.”
Harry took Draco’s hand in his. “Just avoid any cameras. According to your father I shouldn’t even be breathing on you.”
Remus, arms full of a furry black dog, took the place where Maggie had been standing. For a brief second, he looked like some sort of saint on one of those cards that they gave out at those buildings with the crosses and the men in dresses.
Draco fussed with his hair for a few more minutes and then stepped out of the bathroom towards the closet. By the time he re-entered the bedroom Harry was already up and putting on pants. “Have an outfit all picked out?” Harry guessed.
“Um, well, the thing is: I was by your house because of a boy problem. The boy himself is no longer relevant.” She had to think of a way to get Harry and Draco in a room together. Then maybe she could convince them. At least they were looking into adoption.
“They spawned from the earth,” Colin decided with a smile, knowing how silly he sounded. “You plant kids like you do seeds, and then all you have to do is water them.”
The gate fell, some of the metal bars breaking with the crash back to the ground. The gardens had been thrown into a state of disrepair after eight years of neglect. That was 2,922 days of rotting, infestation, rusting, and decay.
Something about Draco telling Harry that made both of their hearts clench tightly in their chests. Harry tried his best to ignore the sensation as he stormed out, and he blamed the wetness on his cheeks on the cold wind.
In complete agreement, Ron finally braved picking the box up and slamming it shut to take back to the Ministry. Unbeknownst to them, the knockback jinx would still be in effect on the poor intern who would have to process the evidence.
“Both,” Draco responded firmly, turning off the water. “They’re one in the same urge to spoil you like you deserve.”
“Yeah, c’mon, grandma,” Draco teased his mother as he shed his own dirty shoes alongside his husband before entering the wedding cake-white mansion. “Lily’s so fast we have to trap her just to reach her. I think that’s a sign she’s going to be one hell of a seeker and team captain for Slytherin when she’s old enough.”
I’ve wanted to write a chapter on the people in Azkaban since forever. Also, Ron and Harry’s bromance keeps me alive and well. Hope you guys enjoy!
“It makes you a sweet and wonderful man,” Harry informed him, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. “And the thought of you with anyone else… I would kill them. That’s why we got married, isn’t it? For love and only having each other for the rest of forever and all that?”
As a nervous tick Emmett put his hand on the back of his neck and rubbed there as he looked down at the beach. “Well.” He took a deep breath. “You know how I didn’t come out to my family until about a year ago?”
“Oh.” Draco hadn’t known about that. Between Harry’s work and their upcoming baby, they hadn’t had much time to discuss their days with one another. They would usually lie in bed together and recount every detail of their most bizarre experiences to one another, feet nudged together and hands roaming along each other’s warmth.
Draco, a whole world of bickering left within him, would not let his point go. Father and son would argue about entirely different things into the dead of night, just as every Malfoy father and son before them, but the next morning Draco would wake up early to catch the mail.
“Yes,” Harry breathed. “It hurts,” he went on with a ragged breath. “But it’s, fuck, it’s—I’m—I like it.”
Tracy Lethenbacker said something but neither of them heard her. Draco was in awe of Harry—could he really be thinking of the Manor as a home already? They turned for the exit both sporting pinker cheeks.
account. That has to mean it’s someone who’s high in the ranks of the… Hierarchy of Macklemore or whatever.” Harry tried to search for words that didn’t sound completely ridiculous, but it was Macklemore they were talking about after all.
When everything was done Draco transferred the scrambled eggs and bacon over to two plates, handing one to Harry. “Let’s eat here at the counter,” Draco decided, taking up a stool with an intricately-carved back and inviting Harry to sit on the one next to him.
“Hmmm,” Draco hummed and had it turn to a moan with how tight Harry still was after all of this work to open him. Draco was closing in on his orgasm though he wished he wasn’t—he wanted this moment to last forever, to always be the one fucking Harry Potter so hard he offered
Ruth, in between her gay guardian angels, wasn’t as afraid as she thought she would be. “This is you,” she confirmed. “This is you and you’ve been lying to me.”
“What’s going on down there?” Zeke’s sister shouted from her room. All she wanted was for school to start again so she could be back in her sparkly blue dorms and far, far away from her mother.
Harry swallowed. He’d known this was coming. Without the social lubricant of alcohol this was going to be rougher than the discussion at the bar had been. Harry was glad they’d had that discussion, though, considering where they were now.
“Pretty.” Ginny gave his cheek a little pat and squeezed it. She’d never been with a guy who gave her so many compliments on her appearance rather than her personality traits, but then again, she had dated her fair share of gay men. That thought brought up an idea Ginny had been cooking up.
Draco stopped crouching. He walked past another pair of Healers who didn’t bother to hide their shock that he was back, jaws scraping the staircase as he stomped up it.
The thing about the invisibility cloak of legend, the Deathly Hallow Harry Potter still possessed, was that it was limited in size. Three children had once been able to fit under with only minor poking out of their feet, but two fully-grown men did not have the same luxury. They were visible up to their knees.
“You practically reek of heterosexuality, Ron. You just couldn’t pull it off,” Harry let him down easy.
“Nobody’s ever gotten me flowers before,” Harry admitted, voice thin and still sniffling. “Especially not whole bushes of them. They look so lovely transplanted in the yard, and my own will start growing in soon.”
“Shut up!” Harry laughed. He wasn’t sure when he’d started laughing but it had definitely grown in intensity over the moments he’d spent typing in her contact information. “I have to call her,” he laughed out. “Fuck, fuck, we have to call her. Shut up, stop laughing, stop—“
“I don’t know. Even the best researchers can’t figure out why some kids are magic and some are muggles. After all, that was what happened with your mother and mine,” Harry said honestly.
“That’s right.” Draco climbed into the web of ropes in a wave of tenderness that seemed only natural. His nails still dug into the bruised skin around Harry’s ribcage to keep the right balance of being the stern, reprimanding Master and still being the one who cared about Harry more than anything. “You’re my little lion cub. I’ve got you right on my ankle.” It was a wildly ill-advised tattoo, but the sentiment was sweet all the same.
Draco dragged his teeth across the bump of Harry’s Adam’s apple and bit down to the side of it, sucking the beginnings of a bruise onto Harry’s luscious clean skin. Harry kept his head back so Draco could leave a darker mark, nails digging into his shoulders.
Charlie waved his wand so that a clothespin appeared for him to close around his nostrils. Dragons were beautiful and majestic from afar, but the spot of the reserve that they used as their toilet… Not so much.
Even when she walked down the street scooping icing out of its container and eating it like ice cream, she felt solitary. Nobody in this side of town knew her. Nobody would judge her for her messy bun, bare face (she never used to even leave the dorm without makeup), or her giant pretentious sunglasses. Hey, they kept the sun out of her eyes.
“Let’s just break for lunch,” he mumbled into his hands. “I have some paperwork I need to take care of, anyway.” Harry damned himself once again for making that stupid bet that morning.
“We were,” Draco agreed quietly. He wondered if Harry gave himself that same reminder, that same grace about his own actions. It was clearly easier for him to forgive others than to forgive himself. Draco’s heart ached for Harry and all he’d been through.
“Here, let me,” said Harry when he saw Draco worrying at his tie like that. He stepped in front of the mirror, blocking Draco’s view of himself while he undid and retied the Windsor knot. Draco peeked up over Harry’s shoulder to get a better look at his face, making sure it was all clear of products he’d used to get ready.
Okay this is unrelated but how great would it have been if Voldemort never existed and Remus/Sirius had all these kids who went to Hogwarts and constantly got in trouble with Snape because they would refuse to stop sassing him?? It would be the greatest thing. Parent-teacher conferences would be infinitely more combative and sarcastic. Oh my god. It would be perfect. Anyway, Drarry!
“I’m not a sociopath.” Draco stopped in his tracks, offended. The whole ‘I’m So Cool Because I’m Unfeeling’ thing got really tired by age eighteen. “Ruth is a perfectly nice girl who wanted romance so badly she made herself believe someone’s lies. It’s sad.”
Harry, on the other hand, was rather impressed with the amount of qualifying factors in the messages that Lorraine and ‘Macklemore’ swapped. The man on the other end of the phone calls put some serious effort into this. That, or it was actually Macklemore.
“I mean when you first saw the ring,” Draco sighed. It had been love at first sight with Harry and his wedding rings in a dark Knockturn Alley shop full of curiosities and rarities of all sorts. Just because Draco’s ceremony was done didn’t mean he was done with his wedding-planning- obsession.
Draco smiled. He reached forward and traced Harry’s lips with his thumb. Harry took it in his mouth to suckle without having to even think about it. Draco sighed lovingly. “And it’s just you for me, too, precious boy.” He bent down and gave each arse cheek of Harry’s a kiss. “Now, are you ready for a little pain before your pleasure?”
Refusing to meet the eyes of the young girl who’s t-shirt didn’t quite fit because of the growth around her girth, Draco went on.
“I just didn’t know you were into older men,” Blaise said. “That’s the definition of daddy issues, you know. And you married a man a month
A crisp lavender button-down out of the closet Draco had stocked for him and black pants and trousers to go with them, finely pressed. The black shoes were shining bright under the polish Draco had taken them for, and with a vest added in a spiffing outfit was made.
Harry’s lips curled up into a grin, a slow heat consuming his body. “Then I’ll simply have to.” He moved to settle in between Draco’s thighs, pulling the shirt right off of his head.
She scrolled through some more of their chat logs in search of a specific conversation as Harry and Draco watched words like ‘love’, ‘bae’, and ‘studio’ fly by.
"Don't act so shocked when you were the one making goo-goo eyes at him on the line for tickets. And don't even get me started on the way he goes out of his way to make you laugh."
When she couldn’t stand to run anymore, Grace was entirely out of breath. She leaned over and rested her hands on her knees to pant like a goddamn dog. Pregnancy was hell.
Hermione ate her food in a rather aggressive manner when she was angry. She plunged the naan into the masala sauce with a roaring strength and ripped a piece off of it with her mouth. “And what makes a pureblood baby worth more than one that isn’t?”
While Draco was grateful a naked woman wasn’t in there, he was disturbed that nobody was in the bathroom at all.
Harry grinned uncontrollably to be called sweet in return. That made it hard to kiss Draco but Harry swore to try most valiantly to. He gave Draco a few more pecks on the mouth before dipping down below his chin to kiss along his jawline. Draco Malfoy was a vision exposed on his floor, those doubtlessly-designer pants of his a cheery lavender.
Harry swallowed thickly. He was ready, he swore it. Harry stuck his chin up and looked defiantly at Draco.
“You can open this one,” Draco murmured into Harry’s shoulder when he saw the childish shimmer in his eyes.
Harry kicked his legs up onto the desk. The motion reminded him of what he had done to Draco the night before; another intrusion of Draco into every aspect of his life. Maybe Draco would soon fill every corner of his brain, and then Harry could live his days blissfully unaware of his diminished capacity. “Scream,” he said again in spite of the fact that it also brought back memories of the night before. “Where do people go to scream?”
I am in one of those moods for manic writing. I love it. Also, time to play Spot The Doctor Who References! Thanks for the reviews and comments!
“I’m making spaghetti,” Harry said, stirring the pot of sauce and the pot of noodles on the other burner.
Lorraine shrugged. “He’s never had the time or the computer skills. It’s actually sort of cute how terrible he is with technology. He’s always making autocorrect errors.”
“Nyquil! That’s what I need,” Draco found the right word. “Something to make me sleep through it. It keeps me to the bed so you won’t have me breathing on your things and I won’t be bored and snot-nosed all day.”
“I haven’t been with a woman in ages,” Ginny murmured nostalgically as she unwrapped the bar and took a bite. She didn’t even bother swallowing the food in her mouth to say the next bit. “Completely fantashtic. She wash a real looker.”
The designer of the school was also a bit of an imperialist—thought he was ‘complimenting’ South Asia by using one of their words sort of incorrectly—and that only encouraged students to call it ‘Gnat Rows’.
A shuffle of tiny feet rushed up a faraway staircase, so Narcissa sunk back into the bed with her husband. “Do you have plans for the day?”
“I saw you dancing tonight and I couldn’t get enough.” Draco loved weaving stories. “Shaking your whore arse around and flirting with every man with a pulse. I took it upon myself to bring you here to show you what a real man is like, and to show you what happens to boys who act naughtily.”
“One hundred percent, Draco,” Lucius snapped back at his son. “I would never allow any harm to come to you even recreationally. I think you should know by now—”
Harry let himself be doted on. “He loves me,” Harry decided. “He totally loves me. I’m going to start calling him ‘dad’ and asking him for fatherly advice.” Harry had saved him from Azkaban, so could Lucius even really complain?
“You push!” she yelled again, head tipping back as she entered her fifth hour of labor. “You do it!”
“’Brooke lives in Mason, Michigan with her father, a paraplegic who needs her assistance like my father needs mine. First we bonded over that, and things only grew from there’,” Harry read. “’I’ve tried to set up meetings with her, but she is too afraid of her father finding out that she’s gay for me to get anywhere near her. Please, please help me meet her, she won’t even let me talk to her on the phone or cam her in case her father overhears’.”
“I thought you would be the worst part of this job, but I have truly and sincerely underestimated planes.”
“You’re always taking what I say so personally. I meant gay men in general, of which you definitely are,” Draco reminded Harry gently.
“Are they even allowed to feel you up like that? What do they think you possibly have to hide under your clothes?” Draco asked, appalled that he had to watch this man get patted down by some nitwit in an airport uniform. “Tiny guns?”
After fourth year the nightmares about Cedric became unbearable. He would mutter his name in his sleep, his older and deeply unrealistic crush who had been killed right in front of him, and Dudley would tell all his crew his cousin was having gay wet dreams right in his house—how disgusting! Harry would weep for hours and then in his sleep about the things they would say, too. Kids could be so cruel.
“Harry,” Draco called out into the echo of the room. He reached around Harry’s hip to take him in-hand. “With me.”
Harry spoke with a force that made it clear that this conversation was not just about Vera and Wesley. “They need to talk. If they don’t talk, the gap of misunderstanding will only grow wider. You can’t forget things like this.”
Harry tossed another shovel full of dirt to the side. They had opted to search near the trees themselves, since digging through sand was probably too tedious for Marcus’ taste.
“It’s all the books we wanted,” Harry told his husband with a smile. “Goodnight Moon, Velveteen Rabbit, Tales of Beetle the Bard…” Maybe one day he’d tell little Lily what the Tale of the Three Brothers did for her papa in the war, but that was a story he’d save for when she was old enough to understand what a war was.
The three digits thrust in and eased out again and again. Draco could hardly believe his own eyes, could hardly believe how tight Harry had started and how wide he was now and how tight he would be again around his length—it was almost unreal.
With some grumbles the twenty-or-so officers made their way out the front door, avoiding the shattered window with some guilt in their eyes. Draco glared at all of them to the very last, leaving only Ron, Harry, and Draco in the dining room.
It was disorienting, yes. Music was changing to cater to younger tastes, movies marketed to teens didn’t appeal to Harry much anymore, and there were new trends he didn’t understand in the slightest. Whatever that book of faces muggles always talked about did, Harry was sure it wouldn’t catch on.
Harry had compromised a lot when he joined the Malfoy family, but this was the last time. The rest of this process would be just him and Draco. Harry could care less if Lucius was pounding down their door. The fifty files in his hand held their future together and Draco and Harry would make it like they always did. Together.
“Thanks,” Grace remembered, since saying that to a man who had bought you an entire new wardrobe was probably polite.
“He took a week off from work and we spent the whole week together,” Harry went on as if Ron had said nothing. “Draco’s a Healer now, you know. St. Mungo’s is lucky to have him.”
Yeah, well, how discrete would this man be if he realized an ex-Death Eater was contacting him? Draco could see the Prophet headlines now—
Draco measured out the perfect amount of cinnamon and vanilla extract for two and used his wand to tip them over into the dish as well.
Lucius made a grumbling noise, grouchy as ever. This little cooking session with the Lupins felt more like a forced and juvenile double-date between four slightly unwilling parties.
“I am irresistible,” Draco confirmed, wrapping a hand around Harry’s cock and sighing lovingly at it. He moved further down Harry’s body so he could kiss the tip and taste the bead of precome that had gathered there. “Just like you.”
“The man whose ad I responded to, the one who is living at the Manor with me now, is someone we know from school.”
This caught Lucius off-guard. He interacted with few people other than his wife and son, who both knew the story of their courtship well. He supposed it wouldn’t hurt to inform Potter of what they had done, maybe inspire him to do the same.
Hanging more uselessly than ever the opened bra at least served to frame Harry’s chest visually, making quite the sight for Draco on top of him. “Mmm, such a pretty boy you are,” Draco praised. After a few more pronounced thrusts against Harry’s sternum, Draco pulled his hands back to set Harry’s chest free. He moved back down Harry’s body, not breaking eye contact even once. “Let’s see if… oh, yes,” Draco grinned wickedly as his hands wasted no time finding their way right up Harry’s skirts again. “Still hard.”
He was just the slow, bumbling sort that Draco despised, and he had at one point bullied Harry Potter. That was his job and his job only.
“The worst part about that,” Remus said more to himself than to anyone else. “Is that I really don’t know if you’re kidding or not.”
Draco groaned, inching ever close to his edge but refusing to give in until he made Harry hit his. He moved one hand from his hips to bury in that raven dark hair, tugging on it to lift his chin up while he fucked him. “Say it,” Draco demanded. “Louder!”
That made Harry happy. He smiled, silently tapping his lips to indicate he wanted Draco to kiss him there next. Draco gladly obliged.
With a happy noise Harry laid his weight on Draco, his face pressed to the crook of the blonde’s neck where he could kiss the short hairs there.
“Welcome back,” Draco said into the camera with his perfect, celebrity smile. “I’m Draco, this is my cohost Harry, and we have a wild one for you today. Well, once we pick it.” Draco had planned out each little thing he would say already, feigning surprise or little twists in his voice. It was disturbing how good he was at it. “Well, once Harry picks it.”
“Watch this,” Draco said as if it were a challenge. Even though he was dressed like a free, fashionable man Harry couldn’t help but imagine him in his school uniform when he was little and showing off to his friends. Harry recalled that Draco was powerful too, and always second-best in scores to Hermione.
It was nice, though. It was nice waking up to her hand down Pansy’s panties and her breath on Pansy’s neck without a word about some inane dream or flight of fancy. Maggie was down-to-earth like that, and Pansy wondered if she even dreamed at all.
“Yes! This was for the good of an unborn child and the peeping girl… Well, she was just horny!” Harry reminded him. “You’ve done absolutely insane things in the pursuit of arousal.”
In the mirror on his side of the door Harry saw himself dressed pretty damn well. It was almost a pity to take it off. But then there was the bundle in his arms, slowly unfolding to reveal gold trimming. Harry snorted. Draco really had thought of everything.
Now that shocked Hermione and Ron. “What, he didn’t turn his nose up at us as always?” Hermione questioned with a challenge to her voice.
Draco knocked rhythmically on the flat door and a slot slid open with two eyes peering out. They widened in recognition and the slot closed. Harry heard several mechanisms unlocking on the door and felt for his wand with his free hand just to reassure himself it was there.
Draco let Potter and Hagrid go on a bit more about what kinds of creatures would take best to a broom, not really listening as he ate his scone. Just as he had predicted in bed this morning, the Great Hall looked different at this angle. It looked… smaller.
Oh, she could strike him right at that moment. “That’s what new cleaning spells are for. I could buy a book of them, I’m sure.” As a last resort, she could even ask Molly Weasley how all of that nonsense worked. That, and Harry and Draco could teach her a thing or two. They shared housework like a proper couple.
“Are you trying to get in my pants?” Draco asked, turning in his swivel chair to face Harry’s. The board room really did seem like the perfect place for a little office fantasy. “Because I don’t know if you’ve worked hard enough for it yet.”
Draco laughed to himself before shooing Harry’s hands away and taking off the black pants himself. “I’m your Healer,” Draco reminded him, rubbing the bulge that was now only obscured by a pair of boxers. “I take care of everything.”
Draco took a book off of his desk and placed it on top of his head. Harry’s jaw dropped slightly to see Draco take his first steps, and then on.
“No,” Jordan replied, a little shake coming to her hands. “This is my boyfriend pulling a prank on me.”
Harry stayed perfectly still through all of this, gaze unflinching on Draco’s face when it scrunched as he moved the blankets in.
Draco placed his glass down and turned his gaze from admiring the room to admiring Harry. He’d worn a simple long-sleeve shirt and shorts in case any paint had gotten on them. The way he was sitting in the armchair hiked his shorts up ever-so slightly to reveal a soft expanse of thigh.
Before Lucius could open his mouth for another question, Draco was back. “Father, that’s enough. Whatever you’re going to say—that’s enough of that. I should have taken your hand to lead you away and kept you from the lions,” Draco accused of his parents, taking Harry’s hand as he spoke about it.
Harry was far too close to orgasm for Draco’s comfort. He wanted to draw this out, so he let his hard cock fall from his mouth. Harry whimpered as the sensation that had made his toes curl under left him.
“He made me three, actually. I liked the one of the dog best,” recalled Harry. “But when I asked my uncle about marrying a boy he became irate. He said he knew that leaving me in the house to do chores while the rest of the ‘family’ went to church was bound to pervert me, so they tried to take me to church one time after that and I think I wound up biting the priest. They never made me go back again—said I was a ‘devil child’.”
It was an express delivery which was a hundred pounds extra to deliver on a Sunday (as there is, of course, no post on Sundays), but the second he had the shiny new phone in his hand he knew what he was going to do. Harry wouldn’t have any doubt about who Draco was after this.
“For the ‘love of their life’?” Draco asked with a thick tone of disbelief. “Please. If he really loved her, he would make time.”
“I’m not saying it’s strange,” Draco replied calmly. Even Draco with all of his cold ways and sarcastic defense mechanisms longed for someone to curl up next to at night, someone who really understood him. “It’s just… interesting that you think that.”
—was fixated on him. “I don’t care which house,” he said under his breath to the hat. “Just put me in one.”
Grace’s mother had been killed at a young age, so even without her aunt’s prompting, she probably would have remained godless.
Narcissa did something that almost never failed with her husband. She stroked his ego. “Darling, you received exceptional marks in potions classes and you’re still talented with a cauldron,” she said. “I think this isn’t so different from potions, dear.”
“Hey,” Tiffany said, holding the applicator brush in her hand. “I do not appreciate the name-calling right now.”
“Am I truly boring you so deeply?” Draco teased, his default response around Harry. “Or are you just looking for someone to tuck you in?”
“As a matter of fact I do,” Draco replied and produced a deep blue suit with a black turtleneck to go underneath. “One can never be sloppy when arriving for tea with the Malfoys.”
Draco unbuttoned his shirt looking down at Harry hungrily, almost overwhelmed. Where to start on this lovely buffet of skin and lace? “Stand up,” he ordered, and Harry stood less wobbly on his tall heels than he used to. “Do a turn.”
“There,” Draco murmured when he was satisfied with his coating. “Prevents scarring and disinfects broken skin, and it smells like mint.”
“No,” Harry corrected again. “The curve of the spine says you don’t hate me, and in fact… Yes, yes. Yes, I’m sure that these angles here indicate that you can’t get enough of me or my cock.”
“Thanks, mum,” Draco had to say to get permission to pull away from the near-crushing embrace. “Love you, too.” He blushed to be saying that in front of anyone even about his own mother.
“I don’t think I will,” Draco grinned as he sifted through their treasure chest of toys. The empty protests just added to the fantasy. “Hm, now what to use…”
Harry kissing him like that had jumpstarted Draco’s imagination it seemed, as Harry really was giving him ideas on purpose now, no doubt about it.
“Well, look who it is,” said Percy, glass of wine in-hand and looking like it wasn’t his first. “Haven’t seen you in a while, Harry, and I’ve never seen you serious enough with someone to bring them back here to the lion’s den.”
But even post-production came to an end. In Harry’s hand was the finished product—season one of MTV’s ‘Catfish’ starring Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
Draco was so animated about this, and that kind of sincerity couldn’t be faked. If Draco wasn’t careful then he’d slither his way into Harry’s heart caring about him like this. “Yes, let’s, then,” Harry replied.
In the meantime there wasn’t much to do, so he pulled out his phone to check it. 6:30 on the dot, 8:13 looming in the distance.
“Yes,” Draco hissed back. “You can. There is no law of physics preventing you from reaching behind you with your grubby little fingers, picking any key whatsoever of a room with
When the waiter took their orders, he did a double take. The poor bloke must’ve been new around there to not recognize Theo and Colin as regular customers yet recognize them from The Daily Prophet exposés. “Your food will be here soon, sir. Sirs,” he stumbled over his words before stumbling away to the kitchen.
When Harry thought of Draco, he didn’t want to kill anybody anymore. Not even Marcus Nott. Being with Draco was like having someone yank him out of the water he was drowning in, falling deeper with each road bump and tragedy he encountered in his life. Draco always pulled him up.
He was to give a speech of his own to all the Slytherins once they were all collected in the Commonroom, but for now all students ate together as one.
Draco reached for Harry’s shirt and tugged upwards on it until Harry helped it over his head. “Hey, you,” said Draco, a surly smile on his lips as he turned onto his side facing the other man. “Come here.”
If Harry really wanted it to end he’d snap his fingers and the ropes would disappear, but he had no intention of doing that this early in the game.
A snort escaped Ron. “You’re baby-crazy, Harry. Completely mental. Not even Hermione is as thrilled as you and she went through all that pain to get the babies out. You did manage to faint then, though…”
Harry nodded, unaware of the war waging inside Ron’s skull of whether or not he should deliver some tough love to his friend clearly in need. “Good to see you to. Come in, I’m just making a pizza.” Harry waved him in, quickly grabbing the blankets off of the couch and tossing them onto the armchair so they’d have room to sit.
“What? That’s absolutely absurd. Were you going to go egg his house?” Draco had only seen that in muggle movies Harry showed him, but it looked like a practical revenge tactic.
Draco wanted to point to both things in his life, his home and his career, and say he was doing better than everyone who wished him ill had screamed that he deserved hell. It was a petty wish but Draco Malfoy had lots of petty wishes and there was nothing wrong with that, he was but a gay wizard in a trying world that seemed determined to kill him and his parents.
Lifting the cup to Harry’s lips he drank up, needing to stay hydrated not only from their scene but from the alcohol they’d been sipping on earlier. Harry still felt tipsy, though it clearly hadn’t been enough to stop his arousal. If anything it had fueled it.
Harry wished it were that simple. After another minute of pensieve thinking and pointless scribbling with his quill, Harry started to think outside of the box. “Maybe the letters in ‘scream’ have numbers to them. Maybe the ‘another’ does, too. You know, the thing where ‘A’ is ‘one’ and ‘Z’ is ‘twenty-six’.”
At the center of the bar as it faced Harry he spotted a man, a blonde man. A jolt ran up his spine. He stood up straight and his back cracked in several places to be set right after so much slouching. That certainly wasn’t an encouraging sound, but he shook it off.
“It was declared after the war eleven years ago that Slytherin would let in members of all blood statuses, but we cannot forget our past lest we be doomed to repeat it. Eleven years is a blink of an eye in wizarding time. While I am here, for however long that is, I am dedicated to upholding the standard of a fair and equal ground for all witches and wizards to approach one another on. I will not abide anything other than your most excellent selves in the treatment of others.”
“And good luck with yours—if you can believe it this is actually better than last year. There were only two my first year teaching,” Harry said ruefully. He sounded like he actually cared, but it was rubbing Draco the wrong way that evening.
If it was his mother pressuring him to cut his hair again, he would snap. That woman was a loving one, but she no longer had any control over his life or his follicles. If he so please, Charlie would be Rapunzel.
Draco looked over his shoulder again and Mr. Lark had not gotten any less creepy. “Fine,” he grumbled to Harry. “But I get the left side.”
“And what you mean by ‘what you do with each other’…? Harry, Draco,” Luna said gently. “This one is for both of you: Do you feel you’re in a safe, sane, and consensual relationship at which you can leave any time, under the influence of no love potion or spell?”
Blaise let out a defeated groan. “I’m only human, Gin. A red-blooded, heterosexual man. Just because I see a nice pair of tits doesn’t mean I want to leave you.”
The creature rushed to its meal with an excited flourish of its tail. “Monster,” Draco shuddered before skulking even farther away from the bird.
“No,” Harry objected weakly. “We’d just… We’d make sure that we were never followed home and that they kept out of our faces when they did find us.” Harry had known what the burden of a famous last name had done to Draco, and had promised himself that his child would never suffer that fate.
“I think that was half of what was blowing Hermione’s mind, that only after a day I wanted to move in and after only a week did I know this was something serious.”
With one last defeated sigh, Theo tuned back into the conversation. It had moved on to being about Pansy’s problems, as it always did.
Draco smirked. “Yes, well, you know how terrible I am with sharing what’s mine. We’d have you tarted up and pretty for me and me alone. Everyone else looking on will simply have to burn in jealousy.” He slid his hand down the slope of Harry’s back to grab his arse. “This? This belongs to me, and any man with eyes in his skull would envy me for it.”
If this was what having a home and being a regular kid really felt like, Olivia couldn’t believe she had lived without it. It was practically integral, and no downsides had been observed. Well, not yet, anyway.
