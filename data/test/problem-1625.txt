Harry thought, but he knew Draco knew that. “How...?”
Harry still felt a thrill every time he heard those words, and he wanted to take a deep breath, sit up a little straighter,
And wow, did that idea appeal to Harry: being
it hurt. Harry loved it. Lack of lubrication wasn’t the problem — Draco was right, his cock had gotten plenty wet from Harry’s cunt — but each time Draco thrust into him, the feeling of being filled without preparation burned through him and he felt as though he’d never be rid of it. He couldn’t grit his teeth as he might have done, not with Draco’s fingers stuffed in his mouth; nor was squirming to adjust an option, with the taut leash forcing him to stay still, his back arched. And so Harry took it, just like Draco knew he would: groaning, panting, cunt dripping. He
“Merlin, Malfoy, what the hell is this? You didn’t—”
“Gorgeous,” Draco murmured, almost to himself, and Harry gave a weak laugh that turned into a moan when Draco pulled him down, seating Harry fully on his cock.
“The best is when you start begging. I tell you how much I want to fill up your pretty cunt, and you get so shameless. It’s almost like you know your worth, know that you’re just for this...just for getting used.”
Harry let himself sink further into the pillows and nodded.
And there was a postscript too, following the loopy signature, stating that Ginny’s children were to be given credit for the drawings at the bottom of the note: a sloppily drawn dragon, rainbow, and something that appeared to be a crup with long, bowtruckle-like fingers for legs. Upon reading the brief description penned by Molly, for the children's writing was still a work in progress, he discovered that what he’d believed to be a crup was actually a nundu.
Draco growled possessively, gripping Harry’s wrists and holding him still, almost painfully. Harry felt Draco’s hips and mouth fall still, lips not on Harry anymore but breathing hotly on the sensitive skin of his neck. “What was that?” Draco said, and he licked Harry’s neck in the spot where he’d begun to leave a bruise just a moment before.
And so Harry had sat still on his knees for nearly half an hour with Draco’s cock in his mouth and casual hand in his hair. It had taken an immense amount of Harry’s self control to not suck him off, and if he even swallowed or moved his tongue just a bit, Draco’s grip on his hair would tighten as if in warning. Harry was self-conscious at first about the saliva building up in his mouth. It wet his lips and eventually spilled down his chin, and he’d been impatient for the first couple of minutes, but it wasn’t too long before he relaxed and began to notice the lovely floating feeling he had come to associate with subspace.
Dropping his upper body to the bed and resting his head on his left forearm, he reached with his wand hand between his legs. His fingers met his dick, which was as hard as it could get and had become slippery with the fluids dripping from his cunt. He knew that his cunt was rhythmically clenching around nothingness — he could
And that was the worst thing Harry could’ve said, because Draco leaned back slightly and grinned at him. Rather than providing constant stimulation, even if it was underwhelming, Draco’s tongue now only flicked Harry’s dick every few seconds as he spoke: “
“I don’t want to get you wet,” he mumbled, and embarrassment made his face flush further when Draco laughed.
But Draco didn’t hesitate. “All right,” Draco said happily, without so much as a pause, and though Harry’s eyes were still shut, he could hear how smilingly Draco said it. “Do you want to try that right now?”
Harry felt himself get pushed closer, an embarrassing amount closer, just by feeling Draco’s mouth against his, hot and wet and controlling. He felt intoxicated by Draco’s cock inside him, full and deep and everything he wanted. He moaned into the kiss when Draco nipped his tongue, and keened when Draco broke away and began to fuck him harder.
“Why?”
“Say it, Harry.”
Harry had no idea where any of this came from, but he suspected Draco wouldn’t mind. It wasn’t that different from anything they did now. When Draco told him to rub against his leg, that wasn’t so different from just humping something of his own accord, like a dog would; just rub on something if he felt needy. When Draco leashed him to the bed while he read, that wasn’t so different from being collared and leashed all the time, Harry thought, chained to something random around the house so he wouldn’t knock valuables over or play with something he wasn’t supposed to, like a dog would. When Harry wheedled and complained until Draco fucked him, that wasn’t so different from how Harry wanted to have to whine and beg to get what he wanted and needed, like a dog would.
“What a good boy,” Draco said. “Pity I can’t push past your cervix, that would be sure to do the trick.”
As Draco sat back on the bed, the mattress dipped, and Harry had to try
“Maybe I won’t even let you cum,” Draco continued. “I’ll just pin you down and take you until you’re dripping with my cum. Toys like you don’t need to feel good, you’re only here to please me.
He inhaled sharply when he felt Draco’s fingers wrapping around his neck, gently choking him, and Harry moaned when Draco suddenly began to fuck him with deep, hard thrusts. He knew better than to close his eyes, but he had trouble keeping them open and focused. Draco was his whole world — with him, around him, atop him,
It was a little strange, since Harry was accustomed to having to tilt his head up when he kissed Draco, but extremely pleasant nonetheless. The heat in the pit of his stomach had previously dwindled when his anxiety rose up, but it came roaring back as Draco kissed him harder. He felt Draco’s deft fingers undo each of the buttons of his shirt, and shuddered with arousal, but Draco just hooked a finger in the ring of his collar and pulled him closer.
“What the hell are you doing here?”
This was not one of those times. Harry knew that if he were to be allowed to touch himself, it wouldn’t take very long for him to cum. Unfortunately for him, Draco knew this too, and so he kept Harry tied. Draco also knew how to move so that on every thrust in, Draco’s pubic bone ground against Harry’s dick, which made it better and also unbearable for Harry.
Harry bit his tongue and looked away. After a moment he nodded minutely.
you’re the best thing I’ve ever seen?” Draco said, a nudging lilt to his voice, but Harry knew that Draco meant to affirm what Harry already knew — he
And suddenly Draco licked hard over his dick, and Harry let out a shout, his hips moving of their own accord to try to get more of this man’s
And the world felt frozen in time, just Harry waiting painfully for what Draco had to say, holding his breath and not venturing to look the other man in the eye.
“Yes, please—” Harry heard himself gasping, and Draco muttered something else. A leash sprouted from the pristine tungsten collar, stretching from it to Draco’s outstretched, waiting hand, where the leash’s tungsten chain met a handle loop of what looked like sturdy satin ribbon. Harry reached up to feel where the collar and leash connected, and found that there was no place where they separated; just like how his collar welded itself shut, the leash seemed to be completely attached.
unpleasant then you’re in for a rough next few minutes.” He pushed into Harry’s cunt, still holding the leash firmly, and moved slowly in and out a few times.
“Please, Draco, I need—”
but Draco ignored him and continued. “You take my cock so well,” he said, grinding into Harry, and then he moved one hand up to unclasp the gag from around Harry’s head and pulled it from his mouth.
“Fuck, you’re so hot, I want to make you feel good. I love that you’re jerking off while looking at me.”
“I like being embarrassed,” he whispered.
He didn’t know what to do, where to look, what to say, so he froze, his eyes fixed painfully on Draco.
And Harry gasped when he felt Draco finally push inside him, filling his cunt far too slowly. His eyes shut again and he tilted his head back, whimpering.

“But then
“More,” he begged, delirious with desire.
Draco stepped in front of the mirror and corrected his hair with a spell, straightened his waistcoat, checked his fly; Harry watched him with a half-smile. They kissed again, Draco gently cupping Harry’s face before trailing his fingers down to the band around Harry’s neck.
“Please touch my dick,” Harry choked out, painfully aware of how despondent he sounded.
The moments between Harry’s ask and Draco’s answer were always agony. There were two ways it could go. Draco either would grant him permission, the subsequent orgasm leaving Harry’s thighs shaking; or Harry would be refused. And if he was refused, Harry would have to choose between the
better when Draco fingered him than when he fingered himself, for whatever reason, and this was no exception. Harry moaned again when the vibrations increased, and another beautiful round of sparks surged through his body. “F-fuck….”
Draco turned toward him fully. “What is it?”
Harry’s hands began to wander too; he started to try to touch Draco’s cock, which was hardening again against his leg, but the taller man took his wrists and moved them away, nipping Harry’s lip as he did so. Harry moaned quietly and relaxed, and Draco pushed him back until he was lying across the top of the desk. His knees were bent and his lower legs were hanging off the edge of the desk, but Draco pulled Harry forward to more easily remove his trousers. Harry didn’t know what to do with his hands, and, as if having read his mind, Draco grabbed Harry’s forearms and hissed a spell under his breath; cuffs appeared around Harry’s wrists, and short chains sprang from them, rooting themselves in the wood of the desk. “Fuck—” Harry felt his wrists being pulled to the sides of his head and secured there, and Draco grinned at him before pulling Harry’s pants all the way down to his ankles.
Harry was happy. He touched the band reverently and stepped over to the wall mirror in his office, there in case he needed to check his appearance before exiting the room. Draco would be using it shortly, he noted.
And then Draco’s mouth enveloped his dick again, and Harry lost all comprehension. And this time, thank Merlin, Draco didn’t stop, and pleasure washed over Harry.
“Oh, the little slag doesn’t like when he’s empty?”
Harry groaned and shook his head, biting the inside of his cheek to stay as quiet as he could. He felt Draco slowing his thrusts, and wanted to cry out to beg him not to.
“Harry?”
Draco flicked Harry’s collarbone with his index finger. “You heard me. Or is my cute puppy as stupid as he looks?”

They came seconds later. “Turn around,” Draco said to him, and Harry did, pivoting on his hands and knees to face Draco, who was fully hard and jerking himself off again, his eyes on Harry. Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to look Draco in the eyes or keep his gaze low; regardless, he was distracted by Draco’s cock merely a foot away from his face, and couldn’t keep his eyes off it as Draco’s hand moved over himself.
He vaguely knew that he wasn’t making sense, that he was just babbling, but the only thing that seemed important was persuading Draco to be inside him. If only Draco knew how Harry
“Please,” he said again.
He knew that he wasn’t
Draco didn’t say anything, just smiled a beautiful smile at him, took the band from Harry’s hands, and, with his wand, set it around Harry’s neck. It wasn’t a traditional collar, not really, but not entirely a day collar either...but it was theirs, and that was far more than enough for Harry.
“Where do you want it?”
Harry let out a whine when Draco’s cock rubbed against his dick again, and Draco laughed. “Cute little puppy,” Draco said. “Such a

happen in Diagon Alley, or was Draco just making it up as an excuse to come fuck him? Was the door
Harry fell forward a bit and buried his face in Draco’s shirt. “Please fuck me,” he said, his voice breaking a little.
Harry dropped his arm and slid his hand between his legs. His dick was slippery from how wet he was, and he let out a choked whine as he began touching himself. He heard Draco’s breath hitch upon feeling Harry’s cunt clench, and something like pride rushed through him —
One of Draco’s hands held his weight beside Harry’s head as they kissed, while the other slipped down between their bodies and touched Harry’s dick. Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, trying to grind against his hand; from his throat rose a sound of desperation when Draco chuckled into the kiss and moved his hand instead to his own cock, which, Harry realized, had been out this whole time.
. Look how wet you are.” He removed Harry’s pants completely and knelt between his legs, pushing them apart and leaning in, his hot breath on the damp fabric. His tongue laved over the spot, and Harry felt Draco’s tongue moving on the other side of the fabric.
He could feel the aching in his cunt, too.
Harry didn’t remember tearing up, but he must have done so because he was so happy that his vision was suddenly streaked with tears threatening to fall. “I love you,” he said happily. “I love you. Thank you.”
that he could hear how wet he had gotten.
“Good boy,” Draco said, and he reached with his other hand to grab the short leash that still was fused to Harry’s collar, tugging him forward until his cock was touching Harry’s face. Harry felt the soft skin of Draco’s cock brush his cheek, and he whimpered, saliva already building in his mouth from the gag.
Harry groaned, and he let his head fall back, and when Draco hissed, “start moving,” Harry did so without hesitation.
Pleasure crashed over Harry, and it felt so good and was so shockingly out of nowhere that he forgot for a second to kiss back. But then he opened his mouth to let Draco’s tongue in, and the sensations surged through him even more strongly; he bucked his hips, trying to rub against what he thought was Draco’s knee between his legs, but found no further friction as his hips met empty air. He made a confused noise into the kiss at the same time that Draco’s tongue prodded his, and groaned when Draco slowly pulled away; the pleasure waned instantly. Harry automatically tried to follow the kiss, leaning up, but Draco smiled at him and gently held him down with a hand on his shoulder.
“What’s this about?” Draco said casually, in a voice far too sweet and light for the deviously smug expression he wore.
“I want you to say it yourself.”
it. He was so wet, so hard, touching himself, hoping, wishing, wanting, needing.
There were long stretches of time where Harry was forbidden from masturbating without Draco’s permission, even though he usually was able to get permission upon asking, but Harry was glad that there were currently no such restrictions placed on him; he didn’t want to let Draco know what he was up to. He slid a hand into his underwear and felt his dick, not hard but certainly not as soft and wrinkled as it occasionally was, and his cunt, which was not dripping but certainly not as uninterested as it occasionally was. He exhaled and closed his eyes, his head tilting back as he thought about what could be in his near future if he could find the courage to just
“I’m going to fuck you, and you’re not going to say a word,” Draco said. “Moans are fine,” he added, “since I know you can’t help it.” He smirked. “You know the safeword.”
. And
“Fuck, yes—” he groaned. Though he was the one being pleasured, the lack of control he had made it ten times better: he had no say in how Draco would touch him, and if what Draco did wasn’t enough to get him to orgasm, having his wrists bound meant Harry had no way of finishing himself off. It wasn’t often at all that Draco got Harry close to orgasm only to end their play soon after. Harry hated being left without being able to cum, but the feeling of intense submission that came from Draco controlling his pleasure made Harry weak at the knees — even if their sex or scene was over, Draco still took advantage of how submissive Harry felt after being denied.
Harry already loved intelligence degradation, and that went well with his fantasies about acting as Draco’s dog. He’d touch himself to those thoughts when Draco wasn’t around. He already had scenarios planned out for what he would love, and he frantically jerked off to them, only halfway hoping that Draco wouldn’t come home early and catch him in the act. “That’s right,” fantasy-Draco would say, holding his dick in front of Harry’s face while Harry’s tongue licked him excitedly, “lick my cock. Good boy. I bet you don’t even know that this is making me feel good, since you’re only a stupid puppy. I just know that puppies love to lick things, and you don’t know better anyway.” And he would cum on his hand and Harry’s face and have Harry obliviously, desperately lick it up.
. And so he bit back a whine, leaned forward in his chair, and took Draco into his mouth.

words at all.
Harry wished he could muffle the extremely-aroused noise he made. He shut his eyes hard, but opened them when he felt a light tug on his leash; he saw Draco looking at him with his eyebrows raised meaningfully.
He’d chuckled, and Hermione’s laugh had been audible from where Harry sat.
Draco said again; he guided Harry’s head lower, moving past the gag and into Harry’s mouth. Harry closed his eyes tightly as Draco pushed farther in, pressing into his throat until Harry had work to fight his gag reflex. He slid his tongue against Draco’s cock, trying to do his best even when his jaw was pried open, and the smug smile that Harry received in return made the effort more than worth it. As Draco began to fuck his throat, Harry let himself relax, as he was used to doing whenever Draco took total control.

Though he would normally be at least a little embarrassed by it, it felt
The curling of Draco’s fingers inside him was perfect, the position and strength of the vibrator on his dick was perfect, the fireworks were going to be so beautiful.
. “You ever thought about fucking me, Harry?”
It strongly emphasized their power dynamic when Draco made Harry wait for something for no reason other than that he wanted to keep Harry on edge. Harry assumed that this was also what was currently happening with his newest secret — Draco wanted to know what it was, but he was more than willing to draw it out and make Harry admit it without being prompted.

“You’re fucking
“Hm. I suppose I can oblige you.”
Draco eased Harry off of his cock, smirking when Harry licked his lips and broke the line of saliva that had connected his mouth to Draco’s head. Harry was panting and still touching himself as Draco pulled his hair, forcing his head up to connect their eyes.
“I- I...was just...you didn’t say...?”
Harry loved when Draco took his ass without prep, even though it
Harry looked at himself in the mirror, his eyes fixed on the metal collar around the base of his throat, and he got to his knees. He let his mind wander to the incredible things Draco could do to him once he admitted to Draco what he wanted.
He didn’t remember opening his eyes, but he must have done so because he saw Draco’s silver ones gazing down at him, and he didn’t remember his jaw dropping, but it must have done so because his lips were parted.
of having to be the face of everything, especially as he had been rapidly rising in the ranks of the junior Aurors.
. The sensation shot straight to Harry’s cunt; he groaned and he arched into the feeling of Draco’s touch on his chest. But Draco’s fingers wrapped around his throat, and Harry shuddered and went limp as Draco slowly choked him.
“I...kind of want….” Harry took a deep breath, focusing on Draco’s comforting touch. “...a crate. If you’re okay with it.”
He stopped suddenly, whining when one of Draco’s hands made its way up to his throat, lightly touching his Adam’s apple, above his collar. Harry tilted his head back automatically, and he gasped when Draco
a time where he was naturally craving to be fucked. It already seemed to happen some of the time — his libido was wildly unstable from hormones, and occasionally it was through the roof for weeks at a time — but they’d never called it...
He nodded again.
Harry couldn’t say anything. He couldn’t moan. He couldn’t breathe. He half-opened his eyes, unthinkingly, and found that they wouldn’t focus. The gag prevented him from swallowing, so the saliva that was building up in his mouth had nowhere to go but all over Draco’s cock, which stayed forced down his throat.
Harry had just picked up his quill to grade the last stack of the written portion of Auror-trainee final exams when a flash of paper above his desk caught his eye. He grumbled.
...like he’d lost control of his boat, small and unassuming and yet
But when the kiss broke again, the feeling faded once more, and Harry shuddered.
— that’s how easy he was. Sometimes, when they had sex, Harry felt so good just submitting that he didn’t even want to cum that badly; he’d just be content to touch himself or have Draco touch him, without any strong desire to climax.
From there, Draco had pushed him a little more, handling Harry a little rougher each time they met, until Draco had brought it up while they were chastely sitting together on the couch. He’d asked Harry what he wanted and liked and what turned him on the most, and opened up himself about the things
Harry was so close, just from this wonderful magic on the collar that came to life whenever Draco’s mouth touched his, and, without even thinking of what consequences might arise if he did so, Harry moved a hand between his and Draco’s bodies and began to touch his dick. He’d barely had time to buck his hips against his hand when Draco chuckled against Harry’s mouth and smoothly reached down; his fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrist. Harry groaned as Draco kept kissing him, the feelings from the collar rolling and sweeping through him and drowning out any competing sensation — he only realized Draco had grabbed his wrist when Draco began pulling his hand away from his dick. At the same time, Draco moved away, and, unthinkingly, Harry leaned up to follow his lips, wanting to do anything to keep feeling the way he was. Draco just leaned farther out of reach and grinned.
“What are you—”
, he was doing it for
“Do you want to be further under?”
“Apologize to Cassie for me,” Harry said, and Draco smirked and whisked out the door.
the best thing that Draco had ever seen. “You’re so beautiful it puts everything else to shame.”
He had to fight harder than he would care to admit in order to stay still when Draco touched the outside of his cunt and slid one finger inside. Harry exhaled hard through his nose in his effort to stay quiet; he heard Draco’s chuckle from behind him and the unmistakable noise of trousers being unzipped and shoved down.
Harry smiled again, and he nuzzled closer, into the warmth of Draco’s thigh. The cloth was rough against him, but not uncomfortably so, and he let Draco run his fingers along his collar while he read. Harry knew that it was a conscious gesture, that Draco
Draco lay back against the headboard, at enough of an angle to be able to look right into Harry’s eyes when Harry went down on him, but still sitting up enough for it to be clear who held the reins. Draco spread his legs and pulled Harry between them; Harry felt sudden pressure on the back of his neck as Draco lightly jerked on his leash, and Draco drew him in so that Harry was on all fours over him, their faces at a similar height. Harry didn’t know what he was allowed to do, and he couldn’t do much for himself — his jaws were, humiliatingly, propped wide by the ring gag, and he couldn’t even ask to touch his dick because of how his mouth was held open. Draco kept the leash loose in his fist, but tautened it, keeping Harry from moving away at all, and he brought a hand up to Harry’s mouth.
Draco laughed. “You’ve got exams to grade. I can’t go back to Diagon Alley, so I’ll go home and do some work there and make dinner, and you’ll be done in three hours. You can wait that long.”
“Draco,” he said, through gritted teeth, trying to sound firm. “I need to finish grading these exams by 2:30.”
“She’s been here two weeks,” Draco interrupted. “She’s got no clue what you sound like...”
a normal memo — at least that served for some variety. He opened it, and fondness overcame his annoyance as he saw Molly Weasley’s familiar scrawl, most likely owled to the M.O.M. mailroom and then sent to him. Harry presumed this was in response to his RSVP to the annual Weasley gathering invitation.
He whined when he felt the tongue move away from his ass; the sound was swallowed up when Draco leaned up and kissed him heavily. Draco’s chin was wet, and Harry could taste Draco’s cum and his own wetness on Draco’s mouth. He realized that Draco was hard again, and he made another noise as Draco broke the kiss.
Draco said to him, and kissed him sweetly. Harry made a contented sound as their lips met. Draco gently released Harry’s legs, pulled out of him, and sat back, casting an appreciative glance toward Harry’s cunt, out of which Draco’s cum was beginning to drip. Harry rolled onto his side, rather embarrassed but quite pleased nonetheless, and Draco took his leash and lay down next to him.
“I...I know….” Harry said, and he could
“No, just….”
“Yes,” Draco groaned. “Merlin, yes, cum on my cock, puppy—” And he spanked Harry, hard, just as Harry passed the point of no return.
It always surprised Harry how long his high lasted — notably longer than Draco’s — and by the time he had come most of the way down, his hand slowing on his dick, Draco was already grounded again, smiling at him fondly. Harry still felt wonderfully full, and looked with disappointment toward the moment when Draco would pull out. He realized that his left arm was now free, apparently having been released sometime while he was distracted by bliss.
Draco turned towards him, and Harry couldn’t see him, but he felt the movement against his bare back. He felt Draco rest a hand on his hip, possessive, and couldn’t hold back his whimper.
“Fuck, please knock me up….”
“...but she knows your handwriting.”
“I can’t understand you, baby,” Draco said calmly, pressing his fingertips against Harry’s tongue.
,” Harry said, and Draco laughed and kissed him briefly on the mouth.
“Don’t even try to play upset,” Draco said, his breathing getting heavier. “You’re loving every fucking second of this. You love that you’re tied up with my favorite necktie, you love that I’m using your cunt, you love when I hit you. You love that I’ve still got my shirt around my shoulders while you’ve been naked this whole time.”
that always seemed like a crazy thing — and thought, not for the first time or even the hundredth, that there was nobody else with whom he’d rather experience it all.
wet,” Draco said, finally turning his head, his eyes catching on the slickness that coated Harry’s upper inner thighs. “Look at you, you’ve dripped all over yourself.”
“Fuck, thank you….”
“My cunt. Please.”
“Merlin, Draco—”
When Draco let go of his throat, ten seconds later, Harry wished that he hadn’t; but they both knew the dangers of being careless. He was still gazing up at Draco, but he was barely seeing anything he was looking at. One of Draco’s thrusts had him seeing stars, and, without thinking, Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
like that, he really could...just be there, at all hours of the day, just in case Draco wanted to use him, wanted a warm hole to put his cock in. And if he ended up pregnant, that was his fault for being so desperate and slutty, wasn’t it? It’s not like Draco would care if he ended up getting Harry pregnant — toys are for using, after all, and Harry had a cunt, didn’t he? He was made for it.
“Exactly,” said Draco smoothly. “It’s a waste of energy for me to fuck you. You’re just a toy anyway, and it’s no use touching that useless little cock of yours. Might as well make yourself useful.”
Though he wasn’t yet as far gone as he’d been that time, disobeying was still the last thing on Harry’s mind. He was desperate to get fucked, to
“I suppose. But why
Harry made a high-pitched, frenzied sound, the fireworks building rapidly in number, and when Draco let go of his neck, he gasped out, “Please, please, can I cum—?” He felt wild, needy, and it took immense effort to wait for permission, trying not to push himself over the edge too early. It was beyond him how something could feel this good, this
Draco was on top of him, his face above Harry’s, and he was bracing himself with one hand and slowly unbuttoning his shirt with the other. He grinned smugly down at Harry when he saw Harry’s eyes open. “Look how fucking desperate you are,” he said appreciatively, and then, a moment later: “I’m lucky I have you all to myself.”
Draco, of course, noticed right away where he was looking. “What, Harry?”
“What did that do?” he asked, curious but not upset that he’d noticed no obvious changes in how the collar behaved.
“No,” Harry said, holding still while Draco fastened his shirt up, “because you’re the one who makes me desperate in the first place.”
Harry nodded.
Harry felt Draco use the leash to guide him into a kiss, and he warily kissed back, unsure as to what he would be told to do next. Draco slid his other hand to the small of Harry’s back, guiding him forward until he was straddling Draco’s hips. Harry could feel Draco’s cock against the inside of his thigh. He felt dizzy.
“Harry.”
Draco looked down at him, with his beautiful bare chest and beautiful hair and beautiful silver eyes, and Harry wondered, not for the first time, how he deserved that man. How could he? It was Draco, who was handsome and charming and intelligent and sophisticated, more so than Harry thought
Harry groaned. “Please, Draco,” he whispered, and he gasped when Draco yanked his head back by his hair. His scalp smarted with the force of it, and he gasped again when Draco’s teeth found his throat.
“Please,” he said, more clearly this time, “please touch my dick.”
sex; kinky, specifically
“Such a good boy, you took it so well.”
Harry moaned again and blinked his eyes open, and he saw Draco lean back a bit, still fucking Harry’s throat, to look at him. His eyes watered a bit, and his vision was a little blurry — he had to blink every few seconds to clear it — and he recognized this as a symptom of being overwhelmed with how much he loved what they were doing.
The duvet. The vibrator,
Harry moaned, and he obediently kept his eyes open, even as Draco reached down to guide his cock into Harry. Harry felt the familiar slide of Draco’s cock inside him, moving with ease because of how wet he was, and he moaned again when he felt Draco’s hips against him, loving that Draco was fully inside him. Finally closing his eyes when Draco kissed him roughly, Harry let himself sink into the mattress, submitting completely as Draco’s mouth met his.
Harry closed his eyes and turned away, but Draco grabbed his jaw and forced his head back to look at him.
Harry
attractive, but the euphoria he got from being happy in his body and, too, in his submissive headspace, made him see himself closer to how he knew Draco saw him. He had scars all over, aside from the obvious one — he had scars he had gotten as a teenager, from the War; and ones he’d had from being an Auror; and stretch marks on his thighs from when he grew into himself; but when seeing himself like this, with his perfect chest and his body hair and everything, he liked it all.
) that Draco had been interested in of late. He was close enough that Harry could feel the heat of his skin, even through the thick fabric of Draco’s trousers.
And perhaps it was just the impatience talking, but Harry was pretty sure that Draco was drawing out the anticipation of the collar’s other functions solely because he
he thought.
“Seriously?”
Harry already knew that Draco spoiled him, but when he tugged away the cream-colored ribbon and opened the box, his jaw went slack and he glanced up at Draco in surprise.
On the front’s inside, the part that would be touching Harry’s skin, floated a single word neatly carved into the metal:
The kiss was exhilarating, both firing Harry up and pushing him further to submission. He made a discontented noise when Draco suddenly broke the kiss and pulled back; Draco grinned at him and stood up, and he looked Harry right in the eyes as he began to stroke himself.
“I should get back to work,” Harry said, knowing even then that he’d get little done, and he hugged his husband. Elation was a powerful thing.
“Desperate slut,” Draco said, and his tone was a strange mix of sharp and loving that Harry could get addicted to. “You look so needy.
Harry thought, but he thought too that he already knew the answer:
, for Merlin’s sake!) of it turned him on all the same. His breath caught as Draco’s fingers found and fiddled with the little ring that connected Harry’s collar to his leash.
to stick my dick in something right now,” Draco said, “because you’re clearly too dumb to ask me to.” And, with that, he climbed over Harry until he was straddling his ass, pinned him to the bed by a palm between his shoulder blades, and pushed inside him.
Harry swallowed hard and gathered his words. It took longer than it should. “No point,” he whispered.
“You like watching me?”
doing something, he was
The praise was like a drug, both turning Harry on and making happiness swell in his chest.
Harry let out a choked noise. “I’ll make you feel good, I’ll do anything you tell me, I won’t complain about anything else. Please. You don’t even have to do anything, I could do all the work. I just want you inside me.”
“But the other way you could touch my ass and spank me,” Harry continued, squirming to try to get Draco to actually touch his nipples, “or pull my head back. Tie my arms in front of me and push my chest against the desk. Merlin, Draco, please just—”
“I love you so much,” Draco murmured, and started to gently suck marks into the skin of Harry’s inner thighs.
Maybe Draco could gag him and then go jerk off nearby, ignoring Harry, who would just be forced to watch from his crate and desperately wish he could touch himself too. He’d hear Draco groaning, see the look on his face as he got himself off, and be able to do nothing other than be a helpless pet, only to be given what Draco allowed him to have. Harry wanted it so badly.
“Disappointed? That it didn’t feel as good?”
He felt the sparks of orgasm starting to rise deep in his cunt, then in the body of his dick, and he felt himself shaking as his fingers desperately slipped over it.
feeling of slowing his fingers on his dick, his orgasm denied, or making himself cum anyway and having to endure whatever unpleasant punishment Draco deemed appropriate.
“Beg for my cock.”
“I- yeah—”
“And you like being embarrassed.”
The movement of Draco pulling out felt good in and of itself, but Harry despised being empty, and he was mortified to feel Draco’s cum begin to drip from his ass. He groaned again, and slid a hand between his legs to rub his dick, but Draco pulled Harry’s wrist away and spoke in his ear:
“I didn’t say you could move,” Draco said, his voice soft yet firm. “I planned to let you anyway, so I’ll overlook it this once, but next time make sure you ask for permission.”
He stiffened and moaned in the back of his throat when Draco’s fingers gently wrapped around his neck. Not choking, just...omnipresent.
Harry shut his eyes tightly, so embarrassed and
per se, but the thing that was consistent among all his fantasies.
Harry was long past the point of even wanting to argue — if this patronage had been towards the beginning of their play (which, on occasion, it was), he would have retorted, saying he very much
The buzzing of the vibrator was the first thing that came to mind, though muffled since it was inside him, and he tried to focus on noises beyond his being. The scritch-scritching of Draco’s self-inking quill as he jotted notes in the margins. And the neighbor’s crup puppies yapping in the adjacent garden, not even old enough to have a single tail.
But by this point, Harry was hardly in any condition to think properly about
He heard Draco make an approving noise, and felt Draco’s cock throb inside him again, and he moaned and kept his tongue out, continuing to move atop Draco.
,” Draco said, folding his arms with a devious grin, “but I think I’ll wear these to lunch with Luna tomorrow.”
“Actually,” Draco added, as if in afterthought, “I want you to be able to see me. Switch spots.” And he moved up to the headboard, having Harry crawl to where Draco had knelt a moment before, at the foot of the bed.
me?” Draco asked, a horribly annoying, teasing lilt to his voice. “I thought that you” —
Their faces were directly in front of each other, too, and Draco grinned (a bit maliciously, Harry noticed) at him. Draco kept still as he stayed inside Harry, who just looked up at him with wide eyes, unsure of what Draco would do to him next.
top Draco if he so desired, even dom him if the situation called for it. Of course, this sort of talk usually ended with Draco fingering Harry until he begged to be fucked, and occasionally with Harry being left empty for the whole day as a punishment. Both of them enjoyed Harry’s brattier moods.
. But then Draco’s tongue was gone, and Draco replaced it with the pad of his thumb, lightly stroking over the shaft of Harry’s dick.
“Both. Please. I might need rough to get me more comfortable with it.”
Draco’s hand moved up to his hair, pulling his head back, and Harry gasped.
— and had continued to spank him until Harry was so far gone in subspace that he couldn’t stand up without help. It didn’t take very long. Such was a wonderful example of a fun punishment. The “un-fun” punishments included orgasm or masturbation denial that lasted longer than a few hours, being repeatedly forced to help Draco get off without any relief of Harry’s own, or being pushed to the limits of how much embarrassment Harry could take. But even those were, of course, pretty damn fun.)
...Nobody else underneath whom he’d rather be pinned, getting fucked like he was the only thing in the world that could give his husband that satisfaction, that pleasure.
Harry took his time and tried to focus on each of these so as to distract himself, and he’d barely gotten to the two things he could smell when he heard Draco close the book and set it down.
it did more, he just had to get Draco to show him.
“Of course,” Draco added, “you probably couldn’t even top if you had a real dick.”
Draco’s teeth grazed Harry’s dick. “Shut up,” he said, an indiscernible emotion in his voice, and yet the way he said it made Harry want to follow him to the end of the world.
If Harry had been in a headspace that allowed for grateful smiling, he would have done so. Instead, he found himself making a small noise in the back of his throat and turning his head so he wouldn’t have to look right at Draco.
He began to unfold it, vexed, absently noting that it was on plain parchment rather than the signature purple used by the Ministry. So,
“Thank you,” he said. “I love it.”
which he also thought was quite dumb — was one of his favorites. He was pinned, with nowhere to go — his legs were up, which gave Draco perfect access to his holes, and Draco could kiss him whenever he wanted to.
Harry blinked his eyes open, just briefly, and in that quick glimpse he saw that his thighs were littered with hickeys of various sizes and shades. Nobody would see them but Draco and himself, of course, but it still affected him to be marked. He knew that Draco liked doing it, liked leaving things behind that showed the world (even if no one else
Harry had blushed, mumbling each of his answers with his head on Draco’s lap while the latter played with his hair. Less than a month later, they moved in together.
“I love how you get wetter inside right after you cum,” Draco murmured, and, out of nowhere, he started to fuck Harry again with long, deep thrusts. “Perfect. It makes it even easier for me to use your holes to get off with.”
Harry knew that Draco was just as likely — if not more so — to wait until, eventually, Harry came to
that he thought he’d lose his mind. “So what’s the point of me touching it? What’s the point of such a tiny, useless little cock?”
Harry let out a long breath and did as he was ordered. His thighs trembled and ached, and he was lifting himself barely more than an inch off Draco’s cock each time he rose, but he was long past the point when he would argue. Harry sometimes started out mouthy and disobedient, but he seldom stayed that way. On one particular occasion, he had been rude to Pansy while accompanying Draco to lunch with her; Draco often punished Harry with sex, even for unrelated offenses such as that one, so as a result, Harry had later been made to edge himself ten times while Draco watched. The only help he’d be allowed was a phallic dildo. The whole process took over an hour, what with having to stop every little while, and the fact that it was often harder for Harry to orgasm without a vibrator. The first few times he’d been about to cum, Harry had protested when Draco told him to stop touching himself. Draco had done one of those terribly annoying things that Harry loved — the one where he would cock his head slightly, look Harry in the eyes, and say his name warningly in a low voice — and Harry had backed down each time, until, after the fourth time he’d been told to stop, he finally submitted. Usually there was a noticeable moment at which the shift occurred, and this such example was a perfect one. Harry had gone pliant, each breath a moan, and from then on, all he had wanted to do was be allowed to cum. No more fight left in him: each time Draco had told him to stop from that point on, Harry had whimpered and twitched desperately, but taken his hand away. All while Draco watched nonchalantly, sipping an old fashioned. By the time Harry reached ten, he was sweating profusely, shaking, and his eyes were unable to stay focused for more than a few seconds at a time. And when Draco finally allowed Harry his orgasm, it lasted longer and was more powerful than Harry was used to, and, though Harry was normally on the louder side, he hadn’t been able to contain his moans at all. After that, he’d collapsed, and, when thinking back, he could barely remember what happened after. He had vague, blurry memories of Draco gently cleaning him off, getting him a drink, and sweetly petting his hair and whispering soothing words as Harry lay in Draco’s lap.
“Who told you that?”
And if Draco kept going, talking Harry through his orgasm as he often did, his words were lost in the rich explosions, the marvelous sparkles, the spectacular colors. Harry felt his cunt clenching repeatedly, maddeningly, around Draco’s fingers, which still moved inside him as though drawing out Harry’s climax.
unsettling, since neither a spell nor Draco’s firm hand over his mouth allowed him to moan freely. This was one of the only ways Draco could hear Harry’s unrestricted reactions, with no hope of keeping embarrassing noises in, while still keeping him from arguing or begging.
The leather collar vanished, indubitably sent back home to the drawer where they kept such items, and Draco tapped the new band with his wand.
of getting pregnant, he’d still want Draco to finish inside him, no questions asked. He’d beg, even. Like that was any surprise.
Draco’s teeth scraped his jaw. “Which is?”
my cock inside you?”
— was the thing he loved. When his whole world was consumed by this. When his only purpose was to be used as his owner pleased. Fuck, it was good. Draco pushed him lower, and Harry had to fight his gag reflex; he heard Draco make a contented noise above him. Harry felt his face burning, knowing that Draco was watching him in this embarrassing state: flushed, eager, humiliated, and so,
Draco stopped kissing him, but still gripped the leash hard, keeping their lips brushing together. “I think I might fuck your pretty little cunt,” he hissed against Harry’s mouth. “Now be a good boy and turn around for me so I can see your cute holes.”
“I- I need….” Harry began, and he
“Why should I?” Draco murmured smoothly, his palm splaying over Harry’s lower back as a subtle reminder to stay still, be good, be good.
Harry shook his head, and he took a deep breath and began to finger himself again. His mind wandered back to their play, and he realized to his embarrassment that he had been moving his hips in rhythm with his fingers in his cunt. He knew that by now, Draco’s cum was dripping out of him, and that it was definitely getting on the duvet — he hated making a mess, even though it would take a split second to spell away. He did love, though, when Draco made him lick it up. The abundant wetness on his fingers reminded him of earlier, and he opened his eyes.
He heard the sound of Draco spanking him again before he felt it — and then it stung, and then it
Draco smiled — not shyly, for he was never shy, but there was something there that was different from how he normally behaved. Anticipation? “Take it out,” he said, warmth in his voice.
Draco’s palm gently pressed down on Harry’s chest, holding him still so he wouldn’t move again. “Please what?”
took the time to touch him in the ways he knew Harry loved, to take care of him in the ways Harry barely knew he needed, and so much more...thinking about it was stunning, frightening,
Draco nodded. “She wouldn’t let me pay for the charms,” he said with a fond shake of his head, which, Harry thought, really went to show how kind Felicity was.
“Thank you….”
“Aw, look,” Draco mocked, that patronizing lilt to his voice that always made Harry blush. “He’s embarrassed? No worries, baby, I know you too well to think that you don’t like it.”
“We match,” Draco said, their noses brushing, and he leaned back and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. “You’re perfect,” he said again, and Harry beamed.
“Hm,” Draco said appreciatively, tapping the damp spot that had soaked through Harry’s underwear, “I was
“I...I dunno, sir,” he whispered.
perfect.”
Harry whimpered and pressed his hips up, but Draco just continued the same pattern of light, lackadaisical rubbing over Harry’s dick. He knew that Draco would make him talk, and he knew that he’d give in.
“I love feeling you inside me—” Harry mumbled, and he felt embarrassed, too, that the only place he could look was right into Draco’s eyes. Draco was looking at him intensely, in the way he always did; his silver eyes shone with the affection that he was in too dominant a mood to express.
“Fuck you,” he mumbled, and Draco took the opportunity of Harry’s lips parting to grip his hair and push forward, forcing his cock into Harry’s mouth. It tasted strongly of cum and his own wetness, and Harry resented that he moaned quietly when it overwhelmed his senses. His hands were free, and he brought them up to rest on the fronts of Draco’s thighs in order to steady himself. Draco towered above him, it seemed, and Harry knelt at his feet, as subservient as Draco wanted him but not without his own desires.
“It’s okay, you did such a good job. Just stay like that, be good, there you go.”
It was too easy. Harry had no idea what Draco wanted. He couldn’t find the words he needed, couldn’t find
Harry went limp, held up by Draco’s hold on his hips, and he moaned into the pillow as the burn of the impact spread over his backside.
“Please, yes—”
did that to you. Now you’ll
Harry groaned, keeping his eyes shut, and he felt Draco’s lips on his cheek.
me to fill you up with my cum. But I’m not doing it for you. I’m doing it because I own your holes, and I can use them however I’d like.”
Harry heard Draco let out a rumbly, satisfied breath in his ear. “Your hole feels so good,” Draco breathed, and if Harry could talk, he’d moan back that he loved having Draco’s cock inside him, loved feeling him,
“I’m going to suck your pathetic little cock,” Draco said. “And you’re going to sit still because I don’t need you trying to fuck my face like a desperate whore.”
“Damn it,” Harry choked out. “Hurry up. I want you.”
His widening eyes met Draco’s.
Harry cocked his head.
“Yes?”
that he was made to do that, to carry someone’s child,
Harry shuddered again and closed his eyes, leaning into Draco’s touch. “I need….” he whispered, mortified and anxious. “I- I didn’t want to say. For a while.”
felt like. He remembered how, barely a minute in, Draco had reached up and grabbed Harry’s hands, holding them tightly as he continued to eat him out. Harry remembered how he had gripped Draco’s hands blindly, feeling overwhelmed by the affection and care that Draco was showing him and the pleasure that went along with all of it.
“Nothing to be sorry for. Are you all right?”
“Please, I don’t know how….”
“You’re perfect,” he said to Harry, fingertips caressing and tickling his chest.
He’d never been able to cum from oral — only his own hand or a vibrator could push him over. The pressure was never quite right if it wasn’t from one of those, but wow, Draco sure could get him close. Sometimes, when Harry wasn’t cuffed like this, Draco would move back, his mouth slick, and pull Harry’s hand down to prompt him to touch himself if he was close. Draco would keep moving, fingering Harry or fucking him with his tongue while Harry rubbed himself off. Draco had never been insecure about how he couldn’t make Harry cum by himself; he understood that it was different for people who had bodies similar to Harry’s, and that it was hard sometimes, and he was kind and helpful and sweet, doing all he could to help Harry whenever possible.
“No, sir.”
still in his office. “Wait,” he whimpered quietly.
“You’re such a cute slut,” Draco said, slyly caressing the new red mark on Harry’s ass. “I love seeing you ride me and touch yourself, rubbing your cute cock for me. You enjoying yourself, puppy?”
Draco took Harry’s left hand and gently raised it in his own, touching his lips to Harry’s knuckles and, significantly, his wedding band. “What do you want?” he asked gently.
“I don’t...I don’t know—”
child, got to him like little else.
Draco said. “Especially when you beg. It’s like you’re in heat, the way you respond so much.”
when Draco expressed disappointment. Harry wanted to be good, to please Draco, and to be praised in return, even if the praise came in the form of degradation. But his disobedience never lasted long once Draco said something like “bad dog,” because it made Harry want to get to his knees and do everything for him.
, always unlike anything Harry tried to compare it to. And
Harry hissed through his teeth when his knees hit the rough carpet, and he barely had any time to complain about the change in position before he felt Draco’s wet cock brush his lips. He could feel cum dripping out of him and onto the carpet.
went into heat, Harry thought, and then they were fertile and biologically driven to have sex in hopes of reproducing. He wanted that, wanted nothing more than to have sex be the only thing on his mind, taking over everything else until Harry couldn’t think and couldn’t help but spread his legs.
“Draco,” he whispered against the other’s lips, “what about this?”
...but the way he fell apart so easily under Draco was humiliating, and he loved it. He came to the realization that he was whimpering continuously, trying to respond to Draco but unable to bring himself to.
The collar. Draco’s trousers, rough against his shoulder.
Draco spanked him again, his hand coming down hard before Harry had any warning. The pain from the smack shot through his entire body; it fucking
Harry closed his eyes, and felt Draco brush his hair out of his face. Draco kissed Harry on the forehead and pulled him close.
Harry groaned again, turning to bury his face further in the bed.
Harry did as he was told and clumsily flipped himself over, climbing over Draco to straddle him awkwardly. As soon as his lower legs were settled on either side of Draco, Draco guided Harry down as he pushed inside him again. Harry let out a contented sound when he felt Draco’s cock slowly fill him up again; he yelped in surprise, however, when Draco yanked him down by the leash for a rough kiss and thrust up into him. And when Harry started to move to try to reciprocate the motions, Draco just grabbed his hips and held him in place, whispering, “Don’t move.” Draco held Harry still just a couple inches above him, so that he remained inside him, and that left room for Draco to begin to fuck Harry from below, bending his knees to better be able to do so.
as quickly as he could. Completely different from his normal methods, but Harry was in no right mind to care about that.
That particular example of play had taken place about six weeks before Harry became certain that Draco knew he was holding something back...because Harry had been turning it over in his head. He’d been like a dog: unallowed to speak, fed morsels from his master’s plate, and leashed to the table leg, and he’d obeyed silently when he was ordered.
“You’re fucking adorable,” Draco said from above him, and Harry made a noise of surprise when, all of a sudden, his collar appeared around his neck. Draco chuckled. “Just making sure you know where your priorities are,” he said smugly.
sign on his desk. He tried to not let the cadence of his breathing change just from being manhandled, but he knew that, by this point, Draco knew him more than well enough to detect even the smallest sign that Harry was turned on.
didn’t even know what he would like prior to Draco’s discovery, either — like the time Harry was told in the morning of his day off that he wouldn’t be allowed to touch himself or cum until that night, when Draco was to get home from work. This had happened several times, to Harry’s enjoyment (and reluctance). On the most recent occasion, when Draco finally
“Good boy,” he heard Draco murmur, and Harry let himself break into a soft, pleased smile, but his eyes remained shut. “I’ve still got two pages in this chapter, I’ll be done soon. You’re doing so well.”
Draco stayed still for a few moments, gathering himself and coming down from his orgasm. Harry felt Draco regain himself: Draco, still inside Harry, nuzzled the mark his teeth had made on Harry’s neck, and gently kissed his way to Harry’s mouth.
He didn’t know if he could form words. He said nothing, so embarrassed of how desperate his ragged breathing made him seem.
Draco’s waves rocked Harry’s boat once more, and he felt so close to being ready to cum that he thought if Draco made him stop he would scream. He kept touching himself frantically, being
It slid into him easily from how wet he was, and it was embarrassing how good it was to not be empty. He whined softly as he sank down around Draco’s cock, and he instantly started to rock his hips gently, savoring the feeling of being filled.
He felt his hips begin rocking gently into Draco’s touch, shuddered as Draco’s fingers slid against him, and let his head fall back into the pillow.
Harry took a deep breath, and already things were beginning to feel better. He didn’t need for this to be
Confused, Harry made to get up, thinking Draco wanted him elsewhere on the bed, but he was pulled back down by the leash. Not sure what to do, Harry followed along, and he found himself forced to crawl over one of Draco’s legs in order to keep from being asphyxiated. Their chests were now parallel, inches away from each other, and Harry felt quite exposed: he was still naked, while Draco remained fully clothed.
“Tell me which one you want,” Draco said coldly. “Like this, or I push you over, turn you around, and take you like that.”
Harry could hear Hermione’s words on the other side, given his proximity to the phone, and it was something to do with that book club that she and Draco were planning. Nothing interesting. Draco had spoken nonchalantly, casually, not remotely like he had his cock buried in his dripping-wet husband, and it’d turned Harry on more than he had even imagined it could. He’d started when he heard Hermione ask about him, ask to talk to him about Marchbanks’s fundraiser the following fortnight, and he had to wait no longer than a second before Draco, without missing a beat, responded.
“Thank you, sir.”
place — the submissive’s place — to give pleasure, and now that he was getting sucked off while still being firmly dominated, he hardly knew what to do. He was glad that his hands were tied, thinking he wouldn’t be able to keep himself from touching Draco.
It wasn’t nearly as good as Draco’s cock, but still far better than nothing, and Harry began to relax as much as he was able, given that Draco was watching him. Harry felt how wet his cunt was, and how messy with Draco’s cum, and his breath shook as he began to finger himself. The angle was poor, and he could barely reach his G-spot, but it felt good nonetheless. He wanted to buck his hips, fuck himself deeper with his fingers, but he held back for fear of moving without permission.
Harry groaned. That wasn’t what he’d meant, of course, but...he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about it. He’d wondered how it would feel. He’d wondered if he would be in charge. He’d wondered what it would be like to see Draco bottoming.
get home (after what felt like five days of waiting for Harry), he’d leashed Harry to the post of the kitchen table and kept him there while making dinner, humming jovially to himself. Harry hadn’t been gagged, but it had been made very clear that if he spoke anything other than asking to stop or slow down, the denial would be extended three more days. Draco had made Harry kneel right next to him, perfectly still while Draco ate, and for his obedience he was rewarded with table scraps: bites of sautéed asparagus and bacon-wrapped filet mignon and potatoes au gratin — Draco was an excellent cook. (Harry supposed it went hand in hand with the potion making.) After having finished, Draco had remained seated, summoned the latest edition of
“What?”
Which was why Harry had wondered about the magic in the new band around his neck: Draco hadn’t done it, or he’d be able to feel his familiar magical signature on it. And though Draco was quite skilled with wandwork, this was something that he would ask of Felicity in order to be sure that it was done properly. They certainly trusted her enough for it, and wouldn’t be hesitant to tell her what the charms were for — especially if they were as...unconventional as Harry suspected they might be.
Once more Harry felt as if he was in a boat. But this time, he, in his small and unassuming dinghy, had sailed successfully across every body of water on Earth. He’d been consumed by the waves, and now he was one with the sea.
Harry whimpered and shook, his eyes fixed on Draco’s hand moving slowly over his cock as he looked at Harry.
“Aw, baby,” Draco said quietly, pityingly, mockingly, “you know I can tell when you’re lying to me.”
He didn’t know if he was allowed to say anything, so he whimpered, and Draco squeezed his ass with the hand not holding his cock.
“No,” Harry said, unconvincingly.
“Do you want this?”
. The fact that Draco
“So fucking high-maintenance, aren’t you?” Draco growled against his jaw, after having bitten another bruise into his skin. “Merlin, I’ve got to do everything myself.”
“I knew we wouldn’t need lube,” he said, and Harry only registered what Draco had meant when he felt the head of Draco’s cock against his asshole, slowly pushing inside him. He blushed.
will know, and I like watching you get embarrassed.”
, it said, in Draco’s finest cursive.
“Fuck—!”
Even when his cock was all the way in Harry’s mouth, Draco would push him down just a bit further, and he couldn’t help but choke. Draco would pay no notice, other than perhaps a small chuckle, and continue on, slowly picking up speed as he used Harry’s mouth. One of Harry’s hands was tight in the duvet, the other tight in the crease of Draco’s trousers, and he forced himself to relax, opening his throat and trying to untense his muscles. His eyelids relaxed, no longer tightly shut, but resting. He felt content. Not comfortable, no, not even a little, with his neck strained and Draco’s cock down his throat, but content — Draco knew what was best, Draco would use him and then Harry would get a reward, because Draco was so good and lovely and kind to him. He blearily came to the realization that Draco was relaxing his grip, letting Harry’s hair fall from his fingers, and he leaned back a bit. He was allowed a moment to catch his breath as he slowly mouthed at Draco’s cock, before Draco pulled the leash, holding him tightly in place. Harry felt Draco begin to move again, shallowly fucking up into his mouth, and he did his best to move his tongue in a way that would feel good for the man using him. He wanted to please his owner; the uncomfortably empty aching inside him was now second only to the desire to be servile.
was capable of being. Draco, who was attractive and graceful and clever and glamorous, and Harry knew that if he was any of these things, it certainly wouldn’t be glamorous or charming, so how did Draco want him?
“What was that? Good boys speak up.”
, who was all of a sudden visibly half-hard through his trousers and had a sly smile slowly forming on his face.
Draco gently bit down on Harry’s neck, and Harry reluctantly felt the argument drain out of him as Draco’s teeth sank into his skin. He groaned.
Harry barely heard the words Draco said, so he whimpered again when he felt Draco stand up.
But the way Draco was sitting on his desk allowed his robes to fall open, and Harry saw one of his hands rest over the front of his trousers, and finally he was completely certain about what was going on.
Harry still felt himself shaking. “I tried,” he said, “to tell myself that it’s okay, because it’s not too different from some things we already do.”
he thought. “No, sir,” he said aloud. He felt the bite mark on his neck smarting, and relished it.
“Draco,” Harry groaned, “come
rather than ‘getting up your ass’ about something. And
“Then ask.”
“Woah,” he breathed, and Draco grinned at him.
“I’ve got you, baby,” Draco said, kneeling in front of him, and the susurration of his voice was calming. Harry felt Draco take his legs and move them so they were slung over Draco’s shoulders, and he felt fingers gently pressing into his cunt.
“What a good boy you are,” Draco praised, though something in his voice made it sound like patronization, and he forced his wet fingers into Harry’s mouth.
“That’s right,” Draco murmured appraisingly. He was rubbing at the spaces between Harry’s labia, a bit higher than and to the sides of his opening (“the U-spot,” he’d heard it called). It felt good, but it wouldn’t be nearly enough to get him to cum — just enough to make him even more desperate to be used. More desperate to please Draco. And the pressure there made him harder too — not that it was easy to tell, since his dick seldom reached more than an inch and a quarter in length. “You couldn’t make me feel good with that tiny thing. You couldn’t fuck me if you
It was
At that moment, Harry became aware that he was gripping Draco’s forearm tightly, as if to ground himself amidst all of the intense sensations and emotions. He felt how hard Draco was inside him —
into him. Though he
“Door’s locked,” Draco murmured huskily, casually cupping his bulge. His eyes were locked on Harry, whose throat was all of a sudden very dry. “...and I’m hard. You know what to do.” And he stood up, slowly unzipped himself, and pulled out his cock.
“No, it’s okay, baby, you don’t need to touch yourself.”
“I can’t believe how wet you are,” Draco said huskily as he pushed all the way inside Harry. “Leaking all over my cock. I could fucking tease you all day, you look so good with your cunt dripping for me.” He began to rock his hips slowly, still staying most of the way inside Harry as he started moving. His left hand moved from Harry’s chest to holding one of his legs up, maneuvering him exactly how he wanted. Harry just groaned and arched his back, basking in the feeling of being controlled.
“You don’t seem in much of a position to be giving orders,” Draco replied smoothly, but, nonetheless, he took off Harry’s boxers. “I love how hard your tiny little cock gets for me,” he continued, once Harry was completely bottomless, and he licked hard over Harry’s dick.
The apathy in the way Draco said it made Harry shudder with want. He arched, bucking his hips and delighting in the feeling of Draco’s fingers rubbing wonderfully against his G-spot.
Draco gently stopped touching him, and as Harry’s orgasm faded, he realized that he still had his tongue out and was panting. His mouth was dry. He opened his eyes, and saw the light of the room and Draco lying, as hot as ever, beneath him.
Harry was exhausted, but he smiled and hummed and thanked Draco. He felt arousal already creeping into his veins again.
“Does it feel good?”
— I, yes — but,
His world exploded. His back arched, his legs shook, and though Harry couldn’t understand how something could possibly feel this
Harry heard Draco
Draco smiled at him and rolled him over, taking care to stay inside Harry as their positions flipped. He pushed Harry’s legs up and planted his hands on either side of him, leaning forward so he was directly over Harry. Draco hooked his arms under Harry’s knees and pinned him like that, leaving Harry on his back with his knees and the tops of his thighs almost touching his chest as his ankles went over Draco’s shoulders.
“Good boy,” Draco murmured, still holding him close, though Harry hadn’t felt he’d done anything particularly meritorious.
“You know what to do if you want to stop,” Draco said, his tone a bit more gentle than it had been previously. When Harry let out a hard breath, he added, “Although, I would bet a million Galleons that you’re already wet under those Auror robes of yours.”
“Of course,” Draco said, for the fourth time, still holding Harry tightly. “Do you want to go back to the bedroom?”
Harry already knew that Draco got off by getting

“And...I think about you lying back and making me fuck you and it feels good because it rubs against my dick but it’s not enough, and —

he would move faster. “I love getting you all embarrassed and seeing how wet your cunt gets from it. You want my cum inside you, huh?”
“Why, Harry?”
“I’m not even touching you,” Draco murmured, his voice dark and...approving? “And this is how you get. So fucking desperate.”
Harry nodded against the pillow, his embarrassment growing when Draco chuckled.
“I love it so much, thank you. It’s perfect.”
It was getting a little bit easier, now that Draco knew. Just a little. “Just...things? That a...a dog might have?”
Harry huffed and Draco chuckled.
“Yeah….”
Draco held his cock and rubbed it slowly against Harry’s cunt, and spanked Harry hard when he tried to move back against it.
“Stop talking,” Draco said, and even though Harry was
him — and Harry wanted it to stay like that.
“You’re incredible,” Draco said, looking him right in the eyes, and kissed him.
Harry shuddered and did as he was told, biting the inside of his cheek to keep himself from begging. It messed with his mind to be tied up and eaten out: he normally thought it
, in his expensive Auror robes, and sitting behind the
“Good boy,” Draco said, affection in his voice. He murmured something; Harry’s wand arm fell free from the chains. “That was the right answer. You can have both.”
Draco’s languid tongue kept going, licking lazy strokes up Harry’s dick. And though Draco allowed him to move, as soon as Harry’s dick pressed too hard against his tongue, Draco moved back a little, consistently preventing Harry from getting the pressure he craved.
Draco flicked Harry’s dick, hard, and Harry yelped in surprise. He turned his head and dug his teeth into the duvet to keep from making more noise.
Harry realized that his cunt had been rhythmically clenching without his realizing it. He bit down on his tongue, but he could hear his shaky breathing, too loud in the quiet room. He focused on the five, four, three, two, one strategy that Draco taught him, for keeping himself grounded in stressful or intense situations — five things he could see. That was easy. The wall, with its light taupe paint and a few shadows cast from the curtains. The curtains themselves, translucent and maroon and pretty. Harry had picked them out. The nightstand: mahogany and ornate, apparently having belonged to Draco’s mother. The odd lamp that sat upon it, a present from Luna. And one of the many books that Harry was currently reading, also atop the nightstand.
, so Harry relaxed and remained still, though he made a similar embarrassing noise every time Draco thrust inside him.
“Wait,” he called, “please—”
Harry almost went out of his mind when he felt Draco’s lips wrap around his dick, and he automatically lifted his hips to try to grind against Draco’s mouth. Draco roughly grabbed his hips and held him against the bed, and slowly began to suck him.
“You look a

But Harry never knew how to bring up something new like the collar, or especially his craving to try puppy play; do you say it in the midst of post-coital snuggling? bring it up casually over dinner? and when? where? how?
thought about.
Harry made a flustered, aroused noise.
“Why?”
Harry could almost
“And even if I did, I’d want
Harry felt fingers tug at his hair. “Hush,” Draco said, a bit sternly. “You’re to stay still for a few minutes more. I told Molly I’d do some reading about which wood is best for new enchanted cutting boards; it will only take a short time.”
Harry had known for weeks that Draco suspected something was up with him. The calculating looks that Draco fixed him with, the sly way he spoke to Harry (during sex and outside of it), and more, all served to make Harry even more nervous.
Harry’s mind wandered to the first such incident, a few months ago. They’d been on the sofa. He had been straddling Draco, facing him with his head tucked into Draco’s shoulder. Draco had been fully clothed, save for his trousers undone, and Harry had been bottomless on his lap, desperately trying to stay silent while he sat with Draco’s cock inside his cunt. Draco had been scrolling on his mobile when Hermione had called him, and Draco had laid a controlling hand on the small of Harry’s back before picking up.
which did nothing to alleviate his arousal, and in fact only worsened it.
“No, fuck, she’ll know—”
“This is my office! I’m—”
Harry had half the mind to keep struggling against Draco, and press his hips up to just have more of his
“Why should I?”
It embarrassed Harry that, though he’d only known he wanted this for a few weeks — to try pet play, that is — he had to suppress a few things that already seemed sort of natural to think about. He knew he’d been a little bit different, and he knew that Draco noticed — most notably, a few times upon hearing Draco’s praise, he’d been tempted to wriggle happily and move as though he was wagging a tail. He would smile and lean into Draco, but he’d wanted to do more and he sensed that Draco could tell.
Harry couldn’t help the whine he made at those words; he
Harry felt Draco moving against him, rubbing against his cunt and smearing the wetness over himself, but he wanted so much more. “Please,” he begged, “I need your cock inside me, filling me up, please, I’ll make you feel so good.” When Draco didn’t move, he kept going. “I want your cum inside me, please fuck me, I need it, I need your cock so much….”
Draco chuckled, grinding into him. “What a dumb slut,” he growled, “wanting me to knock him up.” And he thrust into Harry a little harder, picking up the pace just a bit. “I wouldn’t care if you didn’t want it, either, since you belong to me. I get to use your cunt however I want to, and what I want is to see how cute you’ll look when I get you pregnant.”
“You’re so beautiful,” Draco breathed, his mouth trailing lower as he prompted Harry to lift his hips, working his pants and boxers off. “Thank you for telling me.”
, this all-consuming. The fireworks were about to go off, and he desperately waited to see, see the gorgeous display of colors they had to offer him.
“Of course,” Draco said again. “What else?”
Harry felt Draco begin to speed up, Draco’s thrusts becoming slightly shallower as he did so, and, had Harry any leverage, he would have been moving his hips to get Draco further inside him. Though he knew he was a pillow prince, this was different: Harry was now just a toy, a thing, all for Draco to use. It didn’t matter what he wanted, and it didn’t matter if he didn’t like what Draco was doing — he had no say in it. He knew that Draco would stop immediately if Harry so much as showed any sign of genuine dislike of their play, and so this knowledge left him free to let go, enjoying and allowing Draco’s control. Even tiny things, like the way he could do nothing about how Draco’s unbuttoned shirt tickled his chest, exacerbated those feelings: that of being owned, and that in which Draco’s feelings were the only ones that mattered.
Harry made another noise of arousal and looked up, watching Draco watch him.
fucking turned on by it. He almost forgot how much he wanted something in his cunt. Almost.
, and the last thing he’d need to climax was Draco’s permission—
“You like this?”
Harry lifted it from the box delicately: a band, sized so it would rest just at his collarbones when he wore it about the neck, made of a single piece of white tungsten. It was not much more than half an inch wide, and there was no clear clasp, just a small line in the metal: a space between the two ends of the near-circle of the band. Harry examined it in awe. It had tiny engravings in the metal, vines and clouds and licks of flame, with a small, faceted blue-green topaz set on each side — the stones would face his shoulders when he wore it. And there, too, on the front of the band, sat the miniatures of a dragon and a stag, both encrusted with diamonds in a parallel style to those from Draco’s watch face. They were minuscule, so much so that anyone more than a yard or two away would see no more than a simple band with two small blobs of oppositely-colored diamonds. They were perfect. And….
Draco pulled his hair, dragging Harry off of his cock. Harry was panting, eyes shut tightly, and he could feel how wet his mouth was, hating that Draco could see how disheveled he looked. He made a miffed noise in the back of his throat.
“If only there was something I could do….” Draco said apathetically, his nails briefly digging into Harry’s skin before he pulled away. “Too bad I can’t help,” he added, moving back so he wasn’t touching Harry, and Harry whimpered before he could stop himself.
, read the smaller wording on their sign. Draco worked the potions and had a room in the basement of their shop where he expertly stirred and invented. He occasionally came home smelling like smoke or some herb that Harry didn’t know the name of; once, his robes held the lingering, acrid odor of what Draco explained to be the smell emitted by black swallowtail osmeterium.
Doing his best to swallow his qualms, Harry squeezed his eyes shut and opened his mouth, letting his tongue hang out, and panted.
Draco quickly pecked him on the lips, and there it was again, a sudden spark of pleasure that lasted for less than half a second, just as long as Draco’s lips were on his. Then it was gone, and Harry was left staring breathlessly up at Draco, his eyes wide and mouth halfway open.
“Draco,” he whimpered, not sure what he wanted, and he clutched at Draco’s shoulder. He felt Draco move him back, turning him gently, and guide him into his desk chair. He sat on the edge of the seat and leaned back in bliss as Draco continued to touch him. “I need….”
“Come on, cum for me,” Draco said, and if he had been attentive, Harry would have identified the intense genuineness and love — and
Harry’s arm was twisted beneath him, his fingers between his legs. He felt a gentle weight atop him, a gentle pair of lips on the back of his neck, and a gentle cock inside him.
“C-can I take a break? Or...?” Harry trailed off, unsure.
“And it’s locked?”
Harry hadn’t understood what he meant until Draco had dragged him, hair mussed and with a wet spot in his boxers, over to the floor-length mirror on the other side of his room. He’d held Harry from behind, his chest to Harry’s back as they looked at themselves in the mirror, and pushed his hand into Harry’s pants. Harry saw in the mirror the bright, fresh bruise on his own throat.
“Does it ever bother you how needy you get?” Draco patronized, nipping at the spot right behind Harry’s earlobe that Harry loved. “You’d spread your legs for me if I so much as took my shirt off in front of you. I bet,” Draco continued, “that if I didn’t let you cum for a week, you’d be begging me at every moment just to let you rub your pathetic little dick on something.”
say. He could feel Draco’s eyes on him.
Harry couldn’t decide what to do; it all felt so good. If he went slowly, he got to feel Draco slowly fill him up, which was incredible — but if he went quickly, the deeper motions were more likely to stimulate his A-spot, which he especially loved. He settled for the faster pace, lowering his head and bracing his right hand on Draco’s shoulder for support.
was the one making Draco feel like that.
Harry was dying. He was sure of it. He wanted Draco to fuck him more than he had ever wanted anything. He felt full, but his cunt was aching, and he’d be okay so long as Draco just
Harry knew that he was going to eventually. It was only a matter of time. He bit back further protests, reluctantly resigning himself to what Draco wanted, and kept his eyes closed.
There wasn’t a secret in his life that Harry had ever
Harry hesitated; he turned his head to the side, breathing hard, and he heard himself whimper again. “I...I want you to cum in my cunt,” he whispered.
Draco, courteous as he was, didn’t sweep all of Harry’s files to the floor and leave them in a hectic mess; he swept his wand neatly over the desk surface and the papers all flew into orderly little stacks, which flew to land in a chair on the other side of the office (so as to not be disturbed by the two men’s antics). Harry smiled shyly and stood up, and Draco helped him shrug off his outer robes before he sat atop the desk. Draco, once more, moved his legs apart and stood between them, only this time, the desk made it so Harry had an inch on him. They smiled at each other.
,” Draco countered as he threaded Harry’s top button through its corresponding hole, “
“No. Pick one.”
Harry was dimly aware that his mouth was hanging open, and that the sounds that came from his mouth were just a jumble of moans, all in reaction to what Draco was doing to him.
Draco grinned at him, and the first thing that Harry noticed (in spite of himself) was that
been good, so I think you deserve to get fucked soon.”
Harry gasped quietly, and he had to fight to keep his eyes open and on Draco’s. He felt the motion of Draco’s cock against his G-spot, thinking about how ironic it was that he was on top and yet completely powerless.
“Anything for you,” Draco murmured again, and he nuzzled Harry’s neck. “You want to see something with the collar?”
but broke off, not even knowing how to start. He was sure that Draco could feel him shaking slightly.
Harry once more found himself nodding silently into Draco’s shoulder, and he let Draco lead him to their room, where Harry had just sat in front of the mirror minutes ago. He felt disoriented and fidgety.
This was the third interdepartmental memo in half an hour, it seemed, and Harry plucked the little plane from the air with irritation. The first had been from someone in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, asking if a small Auror squad could be put together as backup for an investigation of a hub of illegal beast trading. The second, from Hermione, discussing when the best time would be to hold the ceremony for the MACUSA ambassadors. And, the third:
Harry put a check mark next to the second question.
He wanted to say
Draco’s tongue moved lower, tracing Harry’s crura lightly. His actions were sure, confident, languid — they both knew that Harry would do anything in that moment, no matter what Draco told Harry he wanted — but greedy at the same time. Harry moaned when he felt Draco’s tongue work its way into him, and Draco’s nails scratched his hip in reprimand when Harry tried to buck against him. Hard enough to leave a mark.
“You’re amazing,” Harry said. He meant every word, and had for years. “You’re everything I need.”
quietly, and he closed his eyes and tried to steady his breathing. The shame coursed through him and it took everything not to whine and beg Draco for something more.
“Was it her?”
“Hands and knees.”
“Yes,” Draco said again, “you do. Tell me.”
—” he managed, and he realized his hips were moving of their own accord, trying to grind his dick on air. Draco’s teeth found his other nipple at the same time he loosened his grip on Harry’s throat and moved his hand away, but Harry wanted more. He wanted to get dizzy. He wanted to let the numb feeling wash over him as Draco held his throat in the ultimate display of dominance.
“Could we go shopping? For...things?”
And then Draco cupped his face and kissed him, and Harry...well, there was no better word for it, Harry
But then there was the other name. Not a proper
Harry felt Draco’s palm rub over his ass, which by now was undoubtedly a deep shade of red with handprints to match, and squeeze.
touched one of his nipples. He felt no pain as Draco pinched him gently and slowly began increasing the pressure on Harry’s nipple, until finally he was pinching
“I love you too,” Draco murmured in his ear, stroking his dick gently, caringly. And the overwhelming love Harry felt, in combination with the little shimmers of pleasure spinning through his body, made his knees feel, all of a sudden, very unsteady.
He slammed his eyes shut when Draco grabbed his calf, forcing Harry’s legs further apart. He adored being on display, even if he didn’t like to admit it to himself. It was so humiliating — worse when his cunt was soaked, like this — and Harry craved it.
“Go ahead.”
Draco’s lips brushed his ear. “You mind if I keep going, sweetie? Won’t take long.”
And, oh, what if Draco wanted to come by and not let Harry out, just stick his cock through the bars of the crate for Harry to lick and suck, until Draco came on Harry’s face and Harry would whine, lick it up, and have to suffer in silence through his own arousal as Draco zipped himself up and walked away. If Harry whimpered and begged too much, Draco could gag him, send a Stinging Jinx through the bars, or, maybe, they could even buy a shock collar. Merlin, the
He couldn’t seem to form words.
“I love you too,” Draco said. “But I didn’t say you could stop, did I?”
Harry nodded. He wasn’t sure he could speak if he wanted to, and was reluctant to try, fearing that all that the only sounds to come out of his mouth if he tried would be moans.
Harry thought wildly. Draco’s words were lighting the fuses at the ends of the fireworks, and Harry watched, as if a spectator to it all, as they burnt shorter and shorter.
Draco shifted above him, and Harry only noticed that he’d changed the angle when Draco’s cock rubbed over his G-spot on the next thrust in. He choked out a groan and tried to press his ass up to get Draco deeper inside him, and his position change allowed Draco to touch him more easily as he fucked Harry.
of whatever was making him feel that roaring, soaring pleaure.
Draco grunted in surprise against Harry’s mouth before chuckling and kissing him back. And then it was Harry’s turn to make a noise of surprise when Draco ground into him suddenly, rubbing wonderfully inside him. The sound Harry made morphed into raw arousal when Draco grabbed his wrists and pinned them to the desk.
“I decide what you need,” Draco interrupted, and Harry fell silent under his quelling stare. Draco released the spell on Harry’s wrists and flicked his hip. “Turn over.”
could provide. He loved to make Harry come to him
himself get wetter around Draco’s fingers when they hooked and rubbed his G-spot.
Nothing seemed to happen, but when Draco guided Harry’s fingers back to find the spot where the split in the metal was before, Harry found it to be smooth. He traced the perimeter of the band, feeling along the etchings for the opening of the slit, and he let out a heavy breath when he didn’t find it.
Harry’s breathing began to shake, but he remembered that he was still wearing the collar, and squirmed away — any bruises higher than that would be visible easily over his robes, and he
that you didn’t,” Draco said, still grinning, and he stood up, pulling Harry with him.
Draco said it, and the
— make the decisions for him, do the important things, and he could just be content and happy and servile. And if there happened to be sex along with it, then that was all the better, he thought.
Harry had worried and pined for weeks after having figured it out — before Draco had gotten it out of him, of course, he always did — but that didn’t mean he wasn’t still embarrassed by it. It was something unfamiliar to him; which was why it was so odd, he had originally felt, that he would want it.
Draco let out a rare moan, and Harry heard it from very, very far away. “Gonna cum,” Draco said through gritted teeth, and Harry, already in his climax, was overwhelmed with nothing short of elation, euphoria, and intense arousal. “You’re so good, baby, yes—”
Draco leaned forward and briefly bit down on the nape of Harry’s neck before starting to fuck him. Harry moaned, and the sound embarrassed him when he heard it from his propped-open mouth. It sounded strained and lewd, and he whined when he realized he couldn’t try to keep his mouth shut. The whine sounded strained too, and Harry tried to bury his face in the pillow. But Draco
Harry felt Draco touch the outside of his cunt then wipe the wetness on Harry’s inner thigh. “Just as you should be,” Draco said smoothly, and he spelled the tie away from Harry’s wrists. Harry exhaled hard, bringing his hands down automatically to try to shield some part of himself from exposure. Draco just laughed and let go of him, before sitting back, propping himself up on one hand, and letting his eyes rake over Harry’s body. “Well?”
It was beautiful, the band, and would be easy to hide beneath the collar of his robes or even a simple dress shirt if he wasn’t at work. There would, of course, be no need to hide it at home. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his reflection, and it smiled back at him even more when Draco came up behind Harry and put his arms around him. He kissed the back of Harry’s head and Harry leaned into the hug.
and do what he had to in order to feel good and help his partner do the same.
“I’m Head Auror, I can just leave and nobody’s going to say anything, c’mon, Draco. We can go home. Do something fun for the rest of the afternoon.”
“I shouldn’t have to tell you three times,” Draco growled in his ear, and Harry could do nothing but blink helplessly up at him as one of Draco’s hands made its way to his throat. “I shouldn’t even have to tell you more than once. I don’t care if you don’t want to do whatever it is I tell you. You’re nothing but a stupid fucktoy, so stop acting like you’re something more.”
Harry always got ridiculously wet from anything done to his ass. Draco loved to tease him; how much wetter he got when Draco fucked his ass, how his wetness would drip onto the bed — it was mortifying, and even more so when Harry was made to lick it up.
Then Draco was the whole world, and as Draco’s afterglow ebbed and he murmured, “Perfect puppy,” into Harry’s ear and Harry beamed, Harry knew he could not have chosen anyone better.
“You look so fucking good,” Draco said. The sincerity in his voice was clear, but it gave way to pride, smugness, and apathy when he continued. “Now, c’mon, sweetie, get started. I know you can’t stand to wait
Draco chuckled against Harry’s lips and wrapped his arms around him, drawing them chest to chest. “I should let you get back to work,” he said, smiling.
neck kisses, hickeys, bites — anything. It made him feel so submissive, knowing that the throat was what animals went for if they wanted to control each other. He liked feeling like prey, or a weak opponent or mate that an alpha was trying to overpower.
“Can I cum, please—” he whimpered, and felt Draco’s fingertips tickling his chest until they wrapped around his throat.
“I’m going to fuck you,” Draco said quietly and decisively, looking Harry right in the eyes. “I’m going to fuck your wet little cunt and cum inside you, and you’re going to sit there and take my cock because that’s what you’re good for.”
Draco hummed and Harry knew that he was taking in the sight of Harry’s cunt, dripping with his own wetness and Draco’s cum, which had just begun to leak out of him.
try, sometimes — it was always far more short-lived than Harry wanted it to be. It just...was so
“Mm, I’m not sure, baby,” Draco murmured, running his hands across Harry’s back. “What’s in it for me?”
“Y-yeah.”
Draco smirked, and Harry ducked his head when he saw how he was being looked at: like an object. Draco reached out and caressed Harry’s face for a moment before he reached for the bedpost and, from it, unlooped Harry’s leash. He wrapped it thrice around his palm, leaving a little over a foot of slack, and tugged Harry closer.
Harry couldn’t do anything more than blink at Draco helplessly and whimper, his mouth busy, and without warning, Draco took his fingers out of Harry’s mouth and slapped him across the face.
His breath shook. “I think about — fuck, I just, ahh — I think about you tying me down like this, and making me wear a...a strap-on, and then riding me and just taking what you want and I can’t cum because it’s not rubbing against my dick and then you jerk off right there and cum on my chest—” His words flew out far too quickly, and he broke off with a whine; Draco rewarded him by sucking momentarily on his dick before he moved his thumb back over it.
“Do you want me to do anything differently?”
Draco just grinned at him, the closest thing to a smirk that he’d worn since Harry had opened up about what he wanted. Without warning, Draco kissed Harry hard, and the world flipped over on itself:
“But—”
Draco just laughed at his attempts to speak, and turned Harry around; he pushed Harry onto his stomach so he was lying flat against the bed. “Well, you’re lucky I
Harry forced himself to think about something innocent, like the project Draco was working on for Mrs. Weasley — researching woods’ magical properties to find which ones are best for usage in cooking — and it helped for a minute, until he heard Draco walk back into the room.
Harry whined, but he moved his hand away from his dick obediently, so humiliated and so turned on.
Draco began to fuck him, and it was slow and deep and everything that Harry needed. Draco’s movements were lazy but still domineering, and oh,
long.”
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco said coldly, and Harry fell silent with a whimper. “Do you want to touch yourself?”

dog, and not needing to worry or do anything. He’d be treated well. He wanted to curl up on the floor by the bed or couch while Draco worked. He wanted to not be allowed to touch himself, and only be allowed to feel good when Draco wanted to use him.
“You’re not even doing anything,” belittled Draco between breaths, pushing Harry’s head down and holding it there, blocking his throat. Harry desperately tried to move his tongue to prove that he
Harry felt his legs getting sore, and he noticed that he was sweating. He hated that he would sweat so much during sex, but he knew that Draco didn’t mind. “I’m getting tired,” he mumbled, and slowed to a stop. His head was still resting on Draco’s shoulder.
to be filled. But his struggles just served to amuse, apparently, because Draco smirked when he saw Harry squirming, and pulled out anyway. Harry couldn’t keep in his whimper; he hated this part. He felt his cunt clenching around nothing, trying to close around the cock that was no longer there. He let out an embarrassingly plaintive sound.
The boat had tipped over, and Harry was fighting for air, trying to swim as Draco’s waves tossed him about and threatened to pull him under.
The last few thrusts right as Draco came inside Harry were inarguably the best, every time. Harry would never know exactly what it felt like for Draco, but he adored being on the receiving end; the pleasure that shot up his spine when Draco thrust deep into him and stayed there, full and hot and perfect. It was the
, you know I can’t just stop whatever I’m doing to entertain you.”
“It’s okay,” Draco said again, his hand moving to cup Harry’s cheek. “Whatever it is, it’s okay. I can help you. I’ll give you what you need.”
feel good.
He felt fuzzy, like he was floating. He felt good. He stayed limp as the man behind him maneuvered them slowly onto their sides, leaving Harry as the little spoon. The pillow was nice beneath his cheek.
“So wet for me,” Draco said, and Harry
Draco strode calmly toward him, and Harry lowered his head so he was staring at the carpet. Embarrassment jolted through him when Draco knelt in front of him and gently tilted Harry’s chin up so he couldn’t look away.
“Some incident outside Mulpepper’s,” Draco said, smiling. His tone was casual but, by the look in his eyes, he could tell that Harry was feigning his indifference. “Closed down a third of the shops in Diagon Alley for the remainder of the day, but the rest of us might as well shut down too. Anything people need they’ll go elsewhere for. Nobody wants to be anywhere nearby when there’s bubotuber pus and poison ivy covering the whole road.”
Harry wondered how he would mention it, how he’d bring it up, since Draco seemed determined for him to say it without being ordered to. He’d been considering just kneeling with a collar and leash about his neck, waiting for Draco to get home one day; he could say what he wanted in the moment, which might be easier than any alternatives. But then Draco wouldn’t have any time to process, which was not what Harry wanted. Draco liked to plan things, Harry knew, and think about whether or not he had questions about what Harry desired, check for any new limits, et cetera. That planning could even be buying something new, if the situation called for it.
Harry
Draco’s fingers wrapped lightly around his throat, just above the collar, and Harry froze, afraid he’d done something wrong.
“You want my cock?”
he heard Draco stutter,
They leaned apart a bit, and Draco’s hand came up, his fingers tracing the leather. “I understand,” he said. “Which reminds me...I have something for you.” He smiled slightly and reached inside his robes, pulling out a flat square box, not quite the length and width of a sheet of the Ministry’s memo paper.
“Yes.
, aren’t you?” His voice was condescendingly sweet as he spun Harry’s chair to face him. He used one knee to nudge Harry’s legs open, stepped between them, and grabbed Harry’s chin. He gently turned Harry’s head to either side, examining him.
“No, they don’t,” said Draco sweetly, but his tone was firm and told Harry just what would happen if he stepped out of line. “Good puppies don’t talk, but sometimes they need help remembering that.” And he reached forward to squeeze Harry’s ass again, took a fistful of Harry’s hair and tugged his head up, and summoned something — Harry couldn’t see what — from the drawer. He discovered it was a ring gag when Draco reached around his head and tapped the silicone O-ring against his lips, easing his mouth open, before fastening it neatly at the back of Harry’s head. There was nowhere for his tongue to rest, of course, so he was left with it hovering awkwardly in the middle of his mouth as he tried to acclimate to the ring that kept his jaw from closing. He made a slightly disgruntled noise, unsettled by the fact that he couldn’t talk, even though he knew that was the primary purpose for gags in the first place. It wasn’t odd to him in and of itself that he couldn’t speak — silencing charms could accomplish that much. But he found the fact that he could make noise but not
“Thank you,” he mumbled.
Upon thinking about that, Harry was reminded of the permanent collar that he now wore around his neck, the one inlaid with tiny diamonds and topazes, that said
All Harry could do was moan and nod, and he gasped shakily when Draco began kissing his neck again. He felt Draco’s breath coming quickly, hot against his skin, and he knew that Draco was getting close.
If he’d been given the compliment in any normal sort of context, Harry would have ducked his head and blushed, feeling his smile grow too wide for his face. But they were on their bed, with Draco jerking off as he kept his husband gagged and obedient in front of him, so Harry just whimpered again and gazed up at Draco.
. “Please, I can’t—”
whether literally or otherwise. On his knees like a supplicant or a servant or...a dog. Draco quite enjoyed when Harry was on his knees, Harry knew, but the utter mental submission was truly what Draco aimed for. They just often went hand in hand.
have to do the work,” Draco said. “Why would I do that when I’ve got you to make me feel good?” The tone of his voice made Harry want to apologize for suggesting something so stupid.
“Be quiet,” Draco said apathetically. “If you think
Draco knew that Harry automatically felt more vulnerable when his arms were above his head because of how ticklish Harry’s underarms were. Harry hated it, but Draco knew that it made Harry struggle more when his ticklishness was at stake.
But Harry, of course, tried to ignore all of this as he met his husband’s eyes.
“You did so well, baby.”
He was already soaked, and this would have him dripping even more. Harry couldn’t help but shift, arching his back and trying to shift the vibrations inside him — the toy touched his G-spot inconsistently, and the lack of pressure was torture. He was still curled up, on his side, and the position left him with frustratingly little leverage. He groaned. It wasn’t enough.
“Seems like you’re just here for the sex,” Draco teased, and Harry knew that Draco didn't really think that, so he laughed and kissed him, his left hand coming up to wrap around the back of Draco’s neck.
— at least, not anything like the extent to which Harry did — but Harry could tell if Draco was enjoying his mouth by whether or not he heard Draco panting by the time they were through.
“What is it?” Draco asked him, but Harry could tell by the smirk on his face that Draco already knew.
“That’s it?” Draco asked neutrally, feigning innocence. He raised an eyebrow at Harry, still stroking himself.
work, he thought.
“You feel so fucking good,” Draco said, groaning quietly. “You want me to cum in you, baby? Fill you up ‘til it drips out of you?”
“You’re so pretty,” Draco whispered, and Harry whined softly and blinked up at him.
Harry turned his head to the side, resting his cheek on the pillow, and let Draco continue to tease him. He felt familiar hands fondle his ass and leisurely move one finger in and out of his cunt — Harry’s breath began to fall unevenly, and he shifted, hoping that Draco’s touches would stray lower to his dick.
“I know how,” Harry said. Their faces were close together, and he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Draco’s. “I see the way you look at me, like I’m the best thing you’ve ever seen.” It wasn’t arrogant, it was true.
Harry loved thigh hickeys, and he felt himself slowly get lost in the sensations: tiny zings from the teeth lightly scraping against him; pleasurable waves emanating from where Draco sucked against his skin, until a red mark blossomed there; the gentle clasp of their hands together, while Draco’s other hand held Harry’s leg, keeping his thighs open for Draco’s reverent mouth.
“That was so amazing,” Harry said blissfully, still breathless. He couldn’t seem to make himself stop smiling. “Thank you.”
“It’s the perfect temperature,” Draco responded, and he sounded as happy as Harry felt. “I’m glad you love it.”
“What else does it do?”
Harry thought he was struggling so much with admitting
He felt the pressure on the back of his neck as Draco pulled the leash down, trying to force Harry to lower himself. He made a small noise, and Draco stopped.
kiss him, but the tie around his wrists still prevented it. Draco’s tongue slipped into his mouth and Harry made a quiet sound in the back of his throat, trying and failing to ignore the aching feeling inside him from not being allowed to cum.
And the world disappeared, and though Harry didn’t have control over his body, he was still frantically rubbing his dick. But…. Draco was gone, so who was pulling his hair? Harry couldn’t speak, so why were his vocal cords vibrating so much? And he was in space, floating, so what downy surface broke his fall when he went limp?
Harry felt Draco lean in, felt the zipper of Draco’s trousers scrape his skin, felt the heat of the other man’s body against him, and he moaned again when he felt the head of Draco’s cock rub against his cunt. He grabbed a fistful of the bedsheets to try to focus and keep himself from pushing back too much, because Draco had told him to stay still, and he didn’t want to be disobedient.
And then Draco took his fingers out, and brought them, covered in Harry’s saliva, to his own cock, smearing it over himself before beginning to jerk off. Draco’s other hand released the leash, and he instead grabbed Harry’s hair; he kept touching himself, and pulled Harry lower so that his cheek was touching the tip of Draco’s cock.
as he came inside Harry.
“You’re insufferable,” Harry said, a genial eyeroll accompanying his words.
Harry shifted his legs a bit farther apart when Draco’s fingers slipped lower between his thighs, gathering wetness from his cunt and using it to softly rub his dick. “Fuck,” he gasped, his head falling back; Draco’s lips found his throat.
But Harry could hardly remember a time he’d been more conflicted. He loved his collar, he loved sex. He loved the D/s everything that they had. And he
, Harry thought, and made an aroused noise at the idea that Draco had done it despite his protests. Harry knew that Draco was fully aware of the difference between a “no” and their safeword — “no” simply meant that Harry was hesitant and embarrassed about how much something turned him on; or, in a brattier context, that he just wanted Draco to be rougher and force him a bit more. Yes, he was not thrilled about having to figure out the mark on his neck while being at work, but he adored the helplessness that came when Draco roughed him up even after he argued.
Harry whined, but he didn’t struggle against the grip on his jaw.
“What is it, Harry?” Draco asked, his breath coming hard from exertion and his voice a growl. “You gonna cum with my cock buried in your ass?”
Although it may have just been wishful thinking, Harry began to get the sense that he

sign on his desk. How was this happening?
Harry said nothing. He loved the idea of Draco knowing him better than he knew himself, even if their sex was always heaping with two-way communication.
“Quarter to three,” Draco said, a tiny smirk playing with the corners of his mouth. “Why?”
He barely even knew that he had broken a rule when Draco slapped him hard across the face. It stung like mad, and Harry was sure that if he had been touching himself when Draco hit him, he would have cum instantly. His mind felt numb, and he blearily opened his eyes, whimpering.
and he found himself thinking it was
Harry moaned, trying to move to get friction on his dick, but Draco held Harry still as he fucked him. “Fuck,” he rasped, “I need—”
The last thing Harry remembered from before he fell asleep was the realization that he was still wearing the collar.
Harry sat up nervously, avoiding Draco’s eyes and saying nothing. He kept his legs spread, and slowly reached between his thighs, his head leaning back to rest against the pillows as he began to touch his dick. He let his eyes fall closed.
What Draco
Draco kissed across his cheek and jawline; his lips found Harry’s jugular, and Harry whined and automatically tilted his head back, allowing Draco unrestricted access to the more sensitive areas of his neck. He
And it was just those three short sentences in Harry’s scrawl, that’s it, and Draco tapped the memo again; it folded itself into a little airplane and whisked away.
And then he remembered how Draco always looked at him, and spoke to him, and held him when he felt small. He remembered one of the first times that Draco had gone down on him: Harry had been on his back, his legs spread as Draco lay between them, and that was when Harry was still new to what a

“Please….” he said quietly, turning his head to the side so he could see Draco. He tried to ignore the empty aching in his cunt, feeling like he would just
Harry normally would have loved this part — there was a special kind of intimacy that you could never get anywhere else — but he felt so lust-driven that these effects were somewhat dulled. He wanted to touch Draco, to wrap his arms around Draco’s shoulders and
“What a pretty boy you are,” Draco said mockingly, and suddenly got off of Harry, his cock slipping from him as he did so, pulling Harry off the desk and to the floor.
fingers could, and Draco’s cock could, too.
His partner at the shop did the charms and spellwork. It was a very efficient system, and Draco worked well with her: a brilliant, pensive young witch named Felicity. She always wore rose-gold bracelets that complemented her darker skin beautifully, and had a bright laugh that reminded one of being home for the holidays. She gave excellent hugs. Harry would have been worried about Draco’s affection for her if he wasn’t so certain of his husband’s disinterest in women. She was intelligent and insightful, and they were close with her — close enough that she knew a few of the finer details of their relationship.
“Already jerking your little cock again even though you came just a few minutes ago?” Draco said, pulling Harry’s head down. “You’re so predictable.”
“Harry.”
him. Draco had been on a rough, dominant streak of late, selfishly taking what he wanted from Harry and being even stricter when Harry broke a rule. The last several times he had sucked Harry off, Draco had firmly held down Harry’s hips, devouring him without caring what Harry wanted. When in his controlling moods, Draco claimed that the only reason he did it was to make Harry wetter, since then it felt better for Draco to fuck him, but Harry knew that Draco loved making him squirm.
“I love you too,” Draco said, and he gently brought his other hand to the back of Harry’s head, comfortingly stroking his hair. “Tell me what you need, Harry.”
Harry felt Draco’s fingertips dig into his hips, and he blearily heard Draco’s voice through the haze of his desperation: “You’ll have to tell me what you’re asking, Harry.”
of painful speculation, Harry decided that
Harry hesitated.
As Draco held him down, Harry became aware that his cunt had begun to clench and unclench itself around nothing. He was getting very low on oxygen, but, somehow, he found that he didn’t mind all that much. This was nothing like staying underwater for too long and running out of air, or anything of the like — this was pleasant, and Harry felt as though he could
“I c-could lie there while you fuck me.”
Draco
“I can’t believe how much you like it when I hurt you,” Draco condescended, and to prove his point, he pinched one of Harry’s nipples until Harry moaned. “Merlin, look how fucking wet you are. You’d do anything I told you.”
“Mm, what was that?” Draco asked, and, in Harry’s peripheral vision, he could see Draco begin to slowly touch his cock.
“I’m getting close,” Draco said in a growl, his thrusts becoming harder and making Harry see stars.
“So look at me.”
Harry told himself, trying to not make any noise as he felt himself get wetter.
Included among those desires was one that embarrassed him but was rooted in his newly-indulged puppyspace fantasies. He wanted to say something about it, but, as he occasionally did, worried about the way it would be received.
“Kiss me,” Harry whined. “Please.”
“I love fucking you,” Draco murmured quietly, kissing Harry’s neck. “Always feels so good. You liked having both your little holes stuffed with my cum, hm?”
“You’re
“Hard luck, baby,” Draco said.
“You have a problem with that?” Draco murmured, beginning to suck on the spot again, and Harry knew that it was too late, regardless of how he felt about it — he’d already have a bruise there.
“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind, Harry, not a pretty toy like you. You know you were born for this.”
“Rather have your cum in me,” he said truthfully, after a moment of reluctant consideration. “Please.”
“You want to fuck me?”
, in some ways, it meant that if Draco said no, Harry would feel worse about it than he would for a kink that was strictly sexual. He tried to tell himself that it was highly unlikely, it really was, that Draco would even say no in the first place, but because Harry’s anxiety often got the better of him, it was hard to listen to this logic.
, that sounded good, Harry thought. “I...I like thinking about both,” he mumbled.
weak enough to ensure that Harry couldn’t cum from this alone. He was certain that was intentional — Draco wouldn’t have wanted Harry to be able to cum
“It puts me in my place,” he said quietly.
His eyes were still closed, and he took a shuddering breath, jumping a little in surprise when Draco kissed him. The kiss was comforting, slow, Draco’s tongue coaxing courage into Harry, who sighed contentedly when he felt Draco’s fingers tug at his hair. It ended too soon.
He braced one palm on Draco’s chest and the other beside Draco’s torso, and began to move, bouncing himself slowly and feeling Draco’s cock inside him with each motion. He felt Draco relax underneath him, forcing Harry to be the one exerting his effort to make them both feel good.
how aroused he was — as he was fucking himself on Draco’s cock, his cunt was making…
“You’re the one who suffers, according to you,” Draco said. He cast a quick cleaning spell over Harry, kissed him on the temple, and began to assist in the buttoning-up of Harry’s shirt. “Since you get all whiny when I don’t let you cum.”
, and Harry could do no more than gasp and groan and take it. Normally he would have yelled into a pillow or cast a cooling charm on his skin to take the edge off, but neither of those options presented themselves as available at this time. He felt something drip down his thigh from his cunt, and shuddered when he remembered that it was just as likely to be Draco’s cum as his own wetness. Harry started to savor the ache of Draco’s cock forcing its way into him, and he whined.
He whimpered upon feeling Draco’s teeth on his throat, and from his overwhelming sense of utter
“There’s something else,” he said softly. He realized he was gripping Draco’s shirt much tighter than necessary. It would need an ironing charm later. “Not a name, but...could— could you call me puppy? Sometimes?”
in the moment, to disobey, when Draco was so calm and authoritative, and
“Change?”
“I love you,” Draco said, and he reached one hand up to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
That was one of the major things he’d been scared to ask for, and finally it was out there, a huge weight off of Harry’s chest.
And then Draco was grinning at Harry and coaxing a kiss out of him, and awkwardly slipping a hand between them to rub his thumb over Harry’s dick.
Harry didn’t say anything, which was fine, since Draco didn’t seem to expect a response. Pulling him hard by the hair, Draco forced Harry to lower himself a few inches until he was resting on Draco’s thigh. Harry was painfully aware of his wetness soaking into the cloth...the expensive, fitted trousers that Draco fussed over if someone so much as dripped water on them. He felt like his mind was going numb — even more so when he felt himself guided into a gentle rocking motion, encouraging him to rub himself against Draco. He dared neither stop nor disobey, and groaned when he felt the fabric rubbing against his dick. It was rough, and the direct pressure on the head was uncomfortable, so he tilted his pelvis forward a bit, making sure he was grinding and stimulating the body of his dick. Draco pulled him into another hard kiss, and Harry felt a pang of arousal in the base of his stomach when Draco found the pressure points on either side of the nape of Harry’s neck. He pinched hard, and Harry keened and rocked against Draco, rubbing himself against Draco’s increasingly-damp trousers.
Neither man said anything for a long moment, a moment of terrible, silent anxiety that Harry was sure would kill him before age or illness ever got the chance.
Draco laid Harry on the bed and began kissing down his bare abdomen. “Can I take your pants off?” he murmured.
. “I feel so empty and it would feel so good. And I want to make you feel good too. Please.”
“You’re fucking
He was reminded of a time they went to Ron and Hermione’s for a picnic — of course Draco had accompanied him — and they’d played a few games of two-on-two Quidditch. Harry had taken his shirt off to mop the sweat from his brow, forgetting that he had a bruise on his ribs from Draco bending him over the kitchen island the previous night; Hermione had seen it and nearly thrown a fit about
And this always made Harry dizzy, when Draco did something like this — told him to move when he was tied, asked him a question while he was gagged...it made Harry feel helpless. He’d want to please Draco so badly, but not know where to start, and it made him wetter and harder than it had any right to.
“Yeah, please.”
He made a quiet, happy sound when Draco licked into his mouth, and his hands rose tentatively to Draco’s shoulders. Draco held his face in one hand and lowered the other, slowly tracing down Harry’s chest and abdomen until he reached Harry’s dick. Harry gasped minutely when he felt Draco touch it, and heard Draco’s amused, pleased hum in response.
“Merlin, you look so desperate,” Draco groaned. “Desperate, stupid puppy.

“I need you to say it, baby.”
But when the door opened, it wasn’t her, and Harry blotted the paper in his surprise as he watched his husband step into his office and close the door behind himself.
“Woah,” Draco had said quietly after pulling away, his voice throaty with satisfaction. “I didn’t mean to do that, but...damn, look at you.”
“What did you think about?” Draco said, his voice draped in silk and velvet. He was still gently fucking Harry with his fingers, but now he began to curl them again inside Harry’s cunt.
been a good boy,” Draco confirmed. “Up.”
“Can you show me something with the collar?” Harry mumbled, quickly and a bit bashfully, between quiet groans, and Draco kissed him again.
“You say that,” Draco said to him, “like you don’t know how I feel about you.”
in his mouth, so he just moaned.
Harry felt Draco unclip the leash and spell it aside before rolling him onto his back. Draco climbed on top of him, cupped his face, and kissed him.
“Please fuck me,” Harry tried to say, and he whined in embarrassment when the only sounds that came out of his mouth were garbled and incomprehensible. He tried again, then closed his eyes as if to hide from the humiliation of it all. “Please,” he ventured one more time, trying to enunciate and only feeling more embarrassed when it sounded just as pathetic as before. He knew Draco could see his tongue moving inside his open mouth as he tried to form words —
He watched as words formed on the paper, the script so familiar and yet foreign at the same time:
The collar felt heavier than it normally did, and Harry let its weight and that of Draco’s hand push him down into the bed, feeling excited in a way that he hadn’t a few moments before. “What...

almost time for his hearing check at St. Mungo’s — since the incident at work with the sketchy fwooper trade, he’d been told to have quarterly check-ups to ensure that there was no lasting damage. He should be sure to send a Patronus to Healer Patil soon to set something up, Harry thought, and he looked helplessly back up at Draco.
— he was just with Draco. “I think I need to be tied up,” he mumbled, feeling himself turn red: redder, at least, than he already was.
