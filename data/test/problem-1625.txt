“It’s called fresh air, father.” Scorpius teased. He tried not to roll his eyes again as father looked him over. “I’m fine, father.”
“You can open your eyes and open your present, love.” Harry said quietly. Draco hummed and opened his eyes to look at what he was holding.
“Why are people like this?” Hermione asked rhetorically. Blaise just shrugged and held his arm out for her to take. She shrugged and took it, walking back into the Great Hall.
“Yes. He was never big on French food but he brought me here on our first date. I fell in love.” Draco said.
“We’re not leaving the house. Do you trust me?” Harry asked instead, moving his hand closer. Draco studied him carefully and finally took his hand only to be pulled out of his seat. He stumbled into Harry, who caught him around the waist.
“We used to have such fun. You, and I, and the kids. We used to be happy. We used to make other people happy, well you did. That was what you were good at. Not politics or financing.” Draco explain.
“I went to the library. What do you expect me to do? Not check out a book?” Hermione asked. Harry and Ron laughed.
“Yes, your majesty.” Harry said sarcastically back as he brought the necklace over the blond’s head and was happy that he chose a thicker necklace with a large clasp.
“You will do no such thing. Now stay here while I go get your fiancé to calm you down.” Hermione said very calmly. In the type of voice one would use that should someone not listen it would mean instant death.
Blaise turned to the tree and eyed it critically. The few decorations Luna put on were a bit pathetic. He lifted his hands up slowly and the tree dressed itself in the ornaments and garland. He tilted his head and brought his hands slowly down, making tinsel cascade down the tree. He walked out of the room and looked back at the tree. He waved his hands and the tree lights turned on, lighting the tree beautifully.
“Well…I’m rather unfamiliar with the term. But there is the need to guard against students getting carried away and ending up disqualifying themselves for certain types of magical bonds. Or, worse, defaulting on a marriage contract.” Draco gave the Hufflepuffs a very stern look.
“Tom. Hissy-fit. Care to explain what you’re arguing so loudly about?” Harry asked coolly in Parceltongue.
Harry turned his face in to rub it against some of Draco’s magically straightened locks, then turned his pleading gaze back to the mirror.
was merely suffering the effects of Potter’s obnoxiously effective potion. Potter was the one with an extremely embarrassing fetish for incest.
“Hello, my name is Jonas Fishburne.” A messy-haired kid who reminded Lucius oddly of his son-in-law offered his hand to Lucius.
“But, what if there’s something to that? Voldemort was really vulnerable to that because of the unicorn blood.” Harry suggested, “Maybe the power of love is simplifying things, but what if the Marks are reacting because they’re being unraveled somehow? Is that possible?”
Draco shuddered and stood from the chair. Strange how being isolated in the middle of the room and scrutinized would make the padded chair so uncomfortable.
Harry’s eyes sparkled with delight at the doll-sized servings, and Draco quickly joined him, daintily picking through the appetizer.
“If we carry thissss condition to Masssster Jamesss, and he agreessss to abide by it, will you permit him to vissssit his nesssstmate without interference?”
One sleeve was slightly shorter than the other. An odd design, perhaps intended to enable easy access to a wand in a wrist sheath? But no, the shorter sleeve had not been widened at the end to accommodate such a device.
Draco put his mind back to his original strategy. Get Potter off-balance, before he started transfiguring tableware into little red teddy-bears that sang soulful songs about lost loved ones or something.
The house elf took the towel and disappeared with a pop. A second later, a fresh towel appeared neatly folded on the nightstand.
Draco looked at his godfather in disbelief. He knew Severus was an ardent supporter of the Dark Lord, for him to concede the Boy Who Lived might have more magic, could become more powerful…was Severus having second thoughts?
Some of the older students chuckled at that, though Harry caught an air of playful menace in a few that rather reminded him of the Weaseley twins.
Draco smiled grimly, wondering if they ranked high enough on Potter’s enemies list to satisfy the “blood” token of the wizarding courtship ritual.
“Shhh, I know it’s strange. But a powerful Dark Lord doesn’t come into being under a lace canopy, Potter. You are immensely powerful, and you are the Heir of two Founders. Any but the most powerful bonding ceremonies would be…unstable. And as powerful as you are, you wouldn’t be able to prevent yourself from turning me into…something less than I am.” Draco said calmly.
Jamie’s laugh was musical as she assured him that it had been a splendid holiday but that she was glad to be home.
Draco had clearly evoked his interest, and endangered a family secret. He put his hand on his wand to help focus him, allowed himself to snap into a momentary trance just long enough to open a tiny hole in his outer shields…letting the weaker probe slip in…then snapping the shields closed again like teeth, a very nasty counter-spell jolting up along the length of the probe and into the older man’s psyche.
Not content with the magical application, Draco took hold of the solid doors of his wardrobe and tugged it forward, willing the sturdy furniture to fall forward and break into pieces.
“Harry, no.” Draco said, alarmed. A knot of absolute dread was building in his sternum, and he found he couldn’t swallow properly.
A twirl and a flick exploded an ivory dragon figurine he’d cherished since his father had given him to Draco as a reward for some long-forgotten triumph. That wasn’t enough, and his ebony and crystal brothers quickly joined him in tiny pieces on the floor.
The five children ran towards where Draco was half atop Moony, being dragged around the yard in circles. Shouts of “Save poor Moony” and “Kill the Dragon” merged with Draco’s threats on the wolf’s life, countered by barks and growls and suspicious slurping noises, echoed around the yard for several moments.
The many bits of acid were escaping their shards and exploding on contact with whatever they happened to touch.
that is Lord Malfoy, and it is now yours. Tell me young Lord Malfoy, are you here to claim what is yourrss?”
“In the meantime, you’re going to have a very high ratio of first-years to Prefects. I don’t suppose you have any suggestions for dealing with that, do you?”
Draco studied his childhood friend, who was now his closest ally. He had been leaving Blaise out of his scheming of late, and the boy was clever enough to have noticed. And, no doubt, made various suppositions based on that fact. And perhaps modified his own strategic positions to reflect a perceived shift in their long-standing alliance.
“Your Dad was the Boy Who Lived and nearly got killed on at least two occasions during his first year. I
“That dog…it was Black’s animagus form?” Draco exclaimed in disbelief. He’d seen the creature too many times to count and never thought anything of it.
moan! At the same time we did! I should have known, it’s the Black family magic. It wants us together so it can have a blooded Heir! And it doesn’t care about waiting for the bond. And it was
“Escribamens Progenies.” Draco whispered. Potter stiffened, feeling the spell, and the Weasley spotted Draco in the act of lowering his wand.
“It need not be to the death, then. But something more substantial then the shedding of blood. The ruination of a great house… we would have to be dueling for dominion, then.”
Draco handled the hair carefully. It had taken considerable persuasion to induce Jamie to procure one of Potter’s dark strands, and he doubted he’d get a replacement if he messed this up. If he even survived the magical explosion.
“Let us not forget what brought Voldemort to ruin the first time, and then again more permanently. The power of Love!” Dumbledore said brightly.
reached for the greatest gain possible in every situation. Like Draco was going to sit idly by, ‘surviving’, when the most powerful wizard of his age…who just so happened to be bloody gorgeous…was available and ripe for the claiming.
He stirred it slightly with his wand, then tapped the surface, making ripples spread out from the point. James thought he saw a reflection of the bassinet, glowing in the middle of the nursery.
Followed by a diminishing list of names of members of several prominent Light families, several aurors, mudbloods, halfbloods, all well-known as strong Light supporters. No doubt, Draco was holding a membership list of the Order of the Phoenix.
“No matter. I have my own plans for our wedding and how the war should end. This new…distance will allow me to give them the appropriate attention, I think.” Draco said calmly.
Draco pulled Potter inside the bathroom and positioned him facing a toilet before pulling out his wand. The opportunity was perfect for the last stage of the spell.
He studied the list of friends again. There were clear groupings. Weasley, Granger, Black, and the werewolf were his core group of friends. Right in there with his family. So that’s how he looked at them, as surrogate family members. That made a twisted Potter-ish sort of sense.
Draco’s frown was interrupted by Jamie grabbing a random box under the tree, reading the label, and shoving it triumphantly into Draco’s hands.
“Well. Roses seem to be a very important first step in declaring interest. Red roses, specifically: I suspect there’s some sort of symbolism relating to the act of consummation. James almost made it a calling card of his, during the years that Lily refused his interest. A single, long-stemmed red rose, the gossips seemed to think it was symbolic of their combative relations that the thorns were not removed. Something to keep in mind with Harry Potter, I think.”
His twin Regulus Sirius leapt into action, sliding noiselessly past James and down the darkened corridor, padded feet sliding gently on the polished wood floor. In seconds, Regulus arrived at THE corner, the one that overlooked the DOOR.
“The recipe vacation for how you can do me a favor for my favor, so there isn’t any debts! Father says holding debts makes people not your friends.”
“I am willing to start again, from the point before where Abraxas turned from Bilius. If you are willing.”
No, Lucius Malfoy felt out of place because he was old. His magical heritage smoothed away some of his fifty-odd years from his face, but despite the breeding and manners of his fellows he knew his mannerisms were dated. Probably more so due to his own upbringing in the Wizarding World. The young people around him glowed with vigor and excitement and it all made Lucius feel very tired.
Draco pushed his bowl forward slightly and placed his spoon carefully atop it, allowing a sigh of contentment to escape from him. Mrs. Weasley’s beaming went up several notches.
“Mind your volume!” Draco hissed at her, before continuing in a more normal voice. “In any case, there’s a difference between making friends with Gryffindors and turning
“I apologize for touching you, and for whatever memories that may have triggered.” He said, quietly.
So the conquering hero was still a virgin at the pathetic age of 16. Perhaps useful information could be gleaned from this first stage of the spell after all.
lovely to meet you, Thomas Potter-Malfoy.” Cloud said formally, offering his hand. Tom carefully shook it, flashing the other boy his most brilliant smile as he responded.
As Potter screamed, Voldemort laughed his low, hissing cackle that spread out along the ground like a carpet of fog, chilling the bones.
“Well yes dear, but they can’t be allowed to get out of hand! Take Mr. Potter’s little friend, for example. The girl is so busy trying to appear intelligent that she isn’t aware of her place in the scheme of things. She’s apparently content to bring her strength under the influence of a pureblood family, but her behavior is that of one determined to found her own original line!”
James smirked. He and Regulus knew Tonks, she came over all the time to visit their parents. Dad was Teddy’s godfather, after all, and Papa was Tonks’ cousin. Hufflepuff was going to be great, he’d be able to get away with murder.
The quaint little cottage had been built on the apex of the small hill, overlooking a small valley with a charming little creek spanned by a cute footbridge.
include any of the standard nutrient-balancing potions in their ingredients. That was probably why they were so much more tasty than the extremely expensive ones he normally had imported from Zurich.
Draco swept out of the entry hall, leaving the portrait of his aunt uncharacteristically at a loss for words.
“My grandfather Abraxas tried to discourage your mudblood mother, Alice Barclay, from a relationship with your father Bilius, by planting evidence against Bilius...but he did this for Bilius’ own good!”
“We found him years ago. Undoing the curse he was trapped under required bonding him to a new magical soul and allowing them to enter the physical world together.”
Draco waited until the door closed and then cast a strong Colloportus on it before opening the scroll.
These seemed fairly predictable bastardization of one of the courtship traditions common to poorer wizards: food, vine, and copper.
Draco stood suddenly, his chair crashing to the floor behind him as he stared down in total shock at the passionate embrace.
“Gentlemen, I think this is quite enough public discussion. Lord Malfoy, if you would, please join us in my office?” Dumbledore said politely.
Of course, that would also double the effective number of Slytherin Prefects, who could deduct house points…it only took a moment for Snape’s eyes to narrow as he realized this, and a pleased expression quickly came over his face.
Stepping carefully around pieces of detritus, Draco retrieved the marriage contract he and Potter had signed.
And behind that, at the other end of that breathtaking avenue, the broad sparkle of the crystal wading pool, complete with its own smaller tongues of flame wandering the surface of the steaming water.
with you I told you to stay away from me!...No, no I’m sorry I don’t know what came over me…oh god, it’s too late, I shouldn’t have let you get so close…everyone I...everyone I love…”
There was a clatter as Potter slammed his fork to the table, knocking over his chair as he stood up rapidly. Blinking rapidly as he ran from the Great Hall.
Voldemort and his Death Eaters were leaning forward to catch every whispered word of Potter's seduction.
“Harry James Potter! You haven’t been eating properly! Look at you, I can see your ribs sticking out!” she poked suspiciously at Harry’s stomach.
“POTTER! NOW!” Draco screamed, panicked. A strange look flickered over Potter’s face, and his head turned to the side to catch sight of the grounds leaping towards them…and a brief flicker of gold…and Draco was suddenly flung out of his dive, Potter in the other direction, leaping like a madman off his broom.
Tom considered this. So the creature was a magical type of snake. Which explained why he could speak to it. And a familiar to one of the two thugs who’d claimed to be brothers to Scorpius.
“Oh no, my Lord. One Malfoy shall be ample proof of our support. I myself would ask a more intimate appointment.”
Draco gasped as the greedy tugging on his magic jerked at him again, feeling like it would rip his core out of his body.
The rumor that Harry Potter had received a beautiful artifact via two swans had taken only two periods to spread through the entire school, and lunch was now the first chance for everyone to openly compare notes.
like to tell you about your father.” Potter said earnestly, “Malfoy can come too, if you want him there.”
The twins found themselves thrown backwards again, and recovering themselves, immediately split to opposite sides of the room to divide the boy’s attention.
“I do not intend to cross wands with the Dark Lord. I am a Malfoy. We deal in other men’s deepest secrets. Even the Dark Lord has his weaknesses.”
best friend,” she corrected him. “And you were rejected entirely, making you the most unhappy child at Hogwarts.”
“Tom, you’ll want to cast Expelliarmus at me, like I taught you before. I’m going to cast it at you. We have to do this at the same time so the wands will connect.”
? Care to explain, boys?” Molly Weasley asked in a powerful voice, her hands (one still holding a dripping ladle) on her aproned hips.
are the Lord Malfoy now. Not Lucius. If you can make your personal goals coincide with the welfare of the family, you should not be ashamed of what it is that you want.”
“Oh, you misunderstand me, Madame. I’m a Malfoy first, I wouldn’t manipulate such a prize solely for the benefit of Black.”
“But…Draco…we’ve always been friends, I shouldn’t have to look for a suitor at this late date! Why would you put me in this position after how long we’ve known each other?” she protested.
“Of course we will! We’re both of excellent bloodlines, powerful magic, intelligent, and of course gorgeous. Our children will be perfect!”
! I love it when they fight!” Fenrir giggled, back on his feet, and Draco raised his wand defensively as something nastier than usual shone in his eyes.
“I never knew him. I grew up…you know…in the orphanage.” Jamie said quietly, eyes downcast. Draco watched her carefully. Was she really taken in so quickly? Perhaps he really should step in.
“You’re serious, aren’t you. Since when did you go from trying to kill Harry to wanting to marry him? If I’m going to help you, I really need to know what you’re after, Malfoy.”
“Doesn’t matter. I meant it anyway,” he turned and walked down the corridor away from Draco, the two sidekicks haranguing him as he went.
With that, he nodded to her stunned face and swept back into the crowd in search of his new Muggle friend, anxious not to miss the man’s discovery that he was actually enrolled in a course to study magic.
Draco brought his other hand to Arthur Weasley’s shoulder, pulling the larger man into an awkward hug, their hands gripped between them.
Regulus rolled his eyes and Harry smiled at him. Good, the kid seemed to have recovered a bit from the drama with the Sorting Hat. Luna’s kid had apparently worked whatever quirky magic she’d passed on to him. Or her. Huh.
“Mr. Malfoy. I’m afraid I’m going to have to strongly suggest you find another incantation. This one is quite dangerous. And it could result in a very unpleasant sentence to Azkaban.”
“The Malfoy family is one of those institutionalized patriarchal hierarchies that still remain despite the advent of liberalized feminism, Granger. My father isn’t fit to lead because he cannot represent the family to the wizarding world. He will follow my lead, as long as he wishes to remain a Malfoy.”
Probably the last remnant of memories of old sexual magic, Draco decided. Which he would definitely have to look into, if he was going to be having sex with such a powerful being as Potter for the foreseeable future.
“I’m a Potter! And a Black, I guess. Not that I want to live at Gr-…Gr-…ugh, I mean, at Sirius’ house. I’d like to see if my parent’s house can be restored…and I’m not really comfortable with as huge a place as Malfoy Manor.”
“You don’t ask the question directly. You ask what the other would tell you if you asked the question. Then you ask if that would be the truth, a half-truth, or a lie. Then you would ask if this would change after a marriage bond.”
Draco tossed in a handful of sulfur, a common intent-marker for Dark potions, and leaned forward to inhale the fumes that rose as the sulfur boiled into the glowing bile. He took a deep breath of the caustic fumes and exhaled the next incantation into the cauldron.
And with that, the three boys were chattering away like the best of friends, the twins relentlessly pumping Tommy for details about the Muggle world, Kings Cross, and the Hogwarts Express.
But Harry Potter was just standing there, staring at the tabletop as if it held a hundred mysteries, lightly holding the thorny rose by the stem with one hand while the other lightly stroked the soft petals with an absent-minded thumb.
“Harry knows perfectly well where he stands with me, and he’s the only one who needs to. Now, is he in there, or am I going to have to start torturing random Gryffindors for the password to the tower?”
“So now we can’t see my wand…um…I mean the reflection of the old wand…but we see a different reflection instead.” Tom observed.
Lily Evans had been rumored to be an extremely powerful Mudblood witch, only a Potter or a Weasley could possibly have handled the amounts of raw magic that would have been her part of the exchange that happens during consummation. Or the Gaunts or Zabinis of the Dark families, though the latter would be an extremely unhealthy alliance for the Mudblood involved.
Harry pulled back from his son and noted the dried tear tracks, framed the boy’s face with his hands.
“Lucius. I can see the burden you’re carrying. And, as confessions go, that’s a pretty heavy one. If you’ve wronged people, I can’t offer you forgiveness, it isn’t my place. But, beyond the question of forgiveness, who I see before me
“I…I guess it wouldn’t be fair to take him to classes. But I don’t think I could be away from him for very long.”
Potter jumped as if he’d felt the undetectable spell. Apparently he really was studying Occlumency. Still, Draco felt the tingle of magic entering the scroll as the spell set.
“Three transfers, one from the Continent, Italy, one from America, New York, and one from India, Dharamsala. I think the American has potential to become a pretty powerful witch. Six orphans, two of which are Muggle-raised purebloods who are going to need some guidance in the wizarding world.”
Draco drew out the moment, meticulously creasing his sleeves as he folded them up the lengths of his forearms, revealing the unmarked skin beneath.
“Your parents” Orpheus had again stalled his movements as he processed this incredible fact. He knew of the debt, of that Tom had no doubt.
“What’s going on in here?” The door swung open and there, at the threshold, stood Harry Potter, wand in hand, with Draco Malfoy ready for battle at his side.
“Very good. Your Hogwarts letter informed you of your true name in this world. Do you know who your parents were?”
The kids giggled as they closed in on this new victim, little fingers working their energetic magic on his ribs as they commenced the tickle-torture, reducing him to laughing fits.
“Ron! How could you be so insensitive?” Granger rebuked him shrilly. “I don’t see how you can even suggest something like this!”
Draco resolved to use this knowledge to his advantage before Jaimie grew old enough to become the object of Potter’s twisted fantasies, as she was a closer relation.
“My grandfather, Abraxas, humbly begs forgiveness. From his friend, Bilius. For being an unworthy friend. For not understanding the order of values to which such a friendship belonged. For not understanding what it was.”
“I’ve changed my name to Thomas Marvolo Slytherin, you can still call me Tom though.” He said a bit shyly.
“I was stupid, they’re addictive. And then you were using some spells that…Harry…I don’t want to be married to the next Dark Lord.”
Tom gave it some thought, his eyes roving the room, noticing how still Greengrass had gone in his task of clearing his things from around Tom’s new bed. Time to play the game his new father had taught him. Time to impress, in just the right way, to plant that seed that would become loyalty.
“Potter. Trust me, okay? I need these working, and it’s very complicated. But everything I’m doing is to help you, so that we can get married as soon as possible. When the time comes, you’ll understand. But until then, I need you to trust me.”
“As will I, father.” Cloud said, looking up into Mr. Zabini’s face intently for a moment. Then the moment was gone and Cloud turned back to Tom, ushering him comfortably towards the big red engine Tom had seen twice before.
“Possibly. I’d like to settle the argument my grandfather started.” Draco said calmly. The kitchen was suddenly deadly quiet.
He shivered. Strange things had gone on in that old house from the moment he brought Draco there as his fiancé. The disturbing scene in the broom closet had only been the beginning of a series of bizarre magical events directed by an increasingly obsessive sentience, culminating in the attempted kidnapping immediately following Regulus’ birth.
The contents of the cauldron began glowing, and Draco stirred it clockwise three times. When he removed his wand the bundle of silk and hair was no longer on it.
“What about actually talking to Harry?” she asked. “I think he really likes you, you know. But he’s not going to agree to marry you if you don’t…you know…
“Just for the wedding? I…I’d really like to see you dressed up, with your hair curly like…like after the other one.”
“Granger been sinking her hooks into you, Potter? The old magic isn’t really up-to-date with the latest feminist propaganda, it really wouldn’t work with a girl. And even if you were willing to transfer the title to
Draco held his breath as the Vanishing Cabinet glowed with a strange dark light, the gold etched runes sending out strange patterns of shadow and deeper shadow on the floor in the space Draco had cleared around the device.
“No, he’s right Harry. She’s an exiled pureblood, her relatives are in charge of bringing her up in the Wizarding World until she’s of age. If it weren’t for Malfoy they’d revert to females and it’d be Bellatrix in charge of her.” Weasley told his friend.
“I think it would be much more efficient to forego the use of treasure chests entirely. The Malfoy family has, of course, our own ships, I’ll just need to arrange delivery of the contents of our vaults, including all artifacts and heirlooms, to your wharf location in Alexandria.”
“Do you, Severus Snape, swear to select from among your memories concerning Harry Potter, the ones which will be most advantageous to Draco Malfoy for the purpose of choosing a side in the current war?”
Molly Weasley did not look shocked. A flicker of mild surprise flashed behind her eyes, but quickly disappeared as they narrowed, calculatingly assessing Draco’s slender hips and sculpted cheekbones.
“Well, my father was really good friends with Draco at Hogwarts, and he said Draco and Harry had always
“Are you well, my friend? It is a lot to adjust to.” Lucius asked, a curdle of uncertain fear settling in his stomach as the man didn’t meet his eyes.
“Oh. And he’s Heir to a Founder through his father!” Pansy gushed. “Imagine all that raw magic channeled into
“Sometimes I dream things, and then they happen. But most of the time, when I have a dream, it’s of something that is happening right then. When Vol-, sorry, when You-Know-Who is very angry, or very pleased about something, if I’m asleep, I see through his eyes.”
“Stand down, Moody. If he tries to run, you can hex him. Otherwise, keep your wand at your side.” Shacklebolt ordered.
Draco looked hard at the connection. A glimpse of Ginny Weasley, flying on her broom, cheeks flushed and eyes dancing with merriment. Then she was lying on a stone floor somewhere, and Potter was rushing to her, gathering her up in his arms.
Not that Draco would stoop to such a common ritual. For a union of three powerful families as Malfoy, Potter, and Black, nothing less than the royal traditions of heirloom, magic, and blood would be appropriate.
Draco kept walking, five, six, seven, eight steps before the door opened again and the boisterous sounds of the other prefects leaving came to his ears. Draco hid a smirk. He’d not only shut Granger down. He’d effectively taken over the meeting, unilaterally decided the issues Granger would have debated for hours, and dismissed the meeting.
“But your guardians are the Potter-Malfoys!” Greengrass gasped, clearly awed. From the emphasis on the second old family, it was clear his surprise had nothing to do with Harry’s known talent as a Parselmouth, himself.
“Potter was the one getting to accept his own proposal, which was something he’d always wished for anyways. Trust me, I know him quite well. He’ll never sign a betrothal contract for Jamie. He’ll let her choose someone on her own.”
He settled himself and Scorpius down in the warded seat, pulled out his mirror and smiled as his husband answered almost immediately.
It was lopsided, clearly wrapped by hand…as in a human hand, not an elf. And the name-tag bore the label “To Draco Malfoy, from Molly Weasley.”
“It’s called the Crystal Sceptre. It’s been in my family for 600 years.” He sneered at Weasley. “And it is
The boys shivered and nodded. Their father had a careful, enunciated way of speaking about grave matters that made the whole world seem to weigh more than usual.
“Molly, please! I promise I’ll put away everything on my plate but I can’t eat with you hovering over me!” Draco pleaded.
“If Jamie plays a part in your little pranks, fine. Whatever. This Marauder business is foolish and undignified, but mostly harmless. But it
“Uh. I was thinking…it’d be great to see Snape’s face…” Potter looked at the ground, blushing furiously.
“Well, well, look what we have here? If it isn’t Saint Potter and his pathetic little friends!” Draco sneered.
“That was my impression. But, it was still worrisome how disinterested he seemed in finding a solution to this.”
Ron’s mouth dropped open in horror at the mention of penetrative intercourse in the same sentence as his mother. Then dropped open again as the second half of that sentence struck him.
That betrayal hurt. Not only had he lost half a portion of coffee beans to that satanic hell-spawn of a machine, but he now also had to find some other way to get his daily dose of caffeine. He had almost broke down in tears.
"Excellent, now listen to me," Harry said, trying to get Draco’s attention. Malfoy looked at him, eyes still somewhat glazed over, his eyelashes wet with tears, his cheeks marked with tear tracks, the colour on his face drained almost entirely away.
He had wanted to name the kitten after its chaotic and destructive nature, blizzard, but had decided against it, standing in favour of the name snowball, just so he could make a pun whenever he said its name. He couldn’t resist the toebeans, or the killer humor. Thus, the angry ball of fluff was christened Sir. Blizzard SnowBall The First, or Snowpaw for short.
That was until he spotted a snowy white one that reminded him of the late Hedwig. He immediately blew off the idea, disgusted at himself. He didn’t like the thought of another owl replacing his dear friend. He almost slapped himself for even considering it. Someday he would get an owl, but today wasn’t the day.
He was the individual who had given Harry helpful advice during his ‘episode’, as Harry insisted on calling it, being the person who had recommended Harry to get a pet, something Harry was eternally grateful for. ‘Best advice you’ve ever given,’ Harry had said. ‘Never thought you were capable of giving out advice, let alone helpful ones.’ he had added as an afterthought, stating it matter-of-factly. He had gotten a smack on the head that day. He still had a bump to prove it.
Harry had been thankful for avoiding a world war 3, especially after hearing what he had fondly dubbed, ‘break up horror stories, myths and tales 101’, from close friends in Hogwarts. He and his companions had laughed, poked at and made jokes out of those stories, but he sure as heck wasn’t alright when he and Ginny broke up.
Draco had decided to move out from Malfoy Manor in the second half of that same year. It had reminded him of too many traumatic childhood memories. The dungeon, the hallways, the drawing-room. Too many deaths, too many reminders. In addition to that, there was his poor mother.
As much as he tried to not think about it. His thoughts kept wandering to Draco's lips on his. Harry touched his lips. He smiled faintly to himself at the thought of seeing Draco again tomorrow.
Harry had been more than tempted to call into work, but Ginny had insisted that he should not take a day off just because of some ‘little panic attack’. ‘As if there were such a thing!’ he had said. It had taken one argument, two heated debates, three homemade treacle tarts and four separate promises of a Quidditch date to convince Harry to go to work. By then he was beyond late to catch the hourly public bus, and he and Ginny had to run the whole way to Briar Rose. He almost hadn’t made it in time.
He vaguely remembered Potter defending him in his trial, but that can’t be true. He hated Potter, and Potter hated him. It was a simple truth, a common fact. Thus, he concluded that, after a considerable amount of brainstorming, that he had either been hallucinating, dreaming, or under the influence of some potion.
“We weren’t flirting.” He frowned, looking more and more like a grumpy cat that was forced to take a shower. Harry thought he looked adorable.
On the rare occasion that they were so understaffed that they had to assign Harry to fold boxes (God forbid!), Harry’s boxes were either crumpled, smashed, wet, missing a chunk or burnt. Lance didn’t want to know how a water-resistant box could get wet, nor how Harry could have burnt the box despite standing behind the counter the entire time, nowhere near any flammable material, the stove or a lighter.
‘Useless, worthless, disgusting. Failure, disappointment, trash. You can’t even handle yourself out in public, something even a two-year-old can do. What a joke.’ He whimpered softly, curling up into a tighter ball, begging, pleading the horrible voices to just go away. The toxic thoughts kept seeping through the weak almost non-existent defences into his mind once again, corrupting him even further.
It was only by chance did Draco hear of this coffee shop, accidentally overhearing a senior Slytherin from London talking about it to his friend when studying in Hogwarts Slytherin common room in first year. For some peculiar reason, that encounter (, though a slightly odd experience,) stuck with him through his years in Hogwarts, even after the great war.
In those few minutes, the lines between hate and love, love and lust were all blurred, every restraint banished into oblivion. The cold didn’t matter the least, the snow falling around them but a distraction, for they were in each other’s protective cocoon. Time stopped, and they both wished that the moment could last forever.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked, eyes filled with concern. Draco was finding it hard to breathe, his heart pounding in his rib cage. But this time for a very different reason.
“Is the cupcake for a friend, Potter?” Lance let out a mock gasp, his hands raised to cover his mouth. He pretended to wipe a tear from his eye. "His all grown up now." Harry snorted, letting out a laugh.
“I don’t really like coffee, maybe you could help me finish it back inside?” Harry winced. It sounded more like a question than a statement. He didn’t know where that came from. Harry loved Mrs Rose’s mocha cupcakes. So much so that whenever anyone was to sneak a bite out of his, he would attempt to bite them back. Twice. (Maybe three times for good measure, but nobody has to know that. After all, he was a mature gentleman.) ‘An eye for an eye,’ as Hermione would have said. It would be ‘A bite for a bite’ to him.
"It's just," Harry paused. He pursed his lips, contemplating what to say, choosing his next few words wisely. "I think I might be able to help," Harry suggested to him. Draco snapped frowning. Instead, his brows were knitted together in confusion and distrust. He brought his feet up onto the couch and curled into himself further. He glared at Potter, his eyes narrowed in apprehension and suspicion.
“It's just for a silver-haired idiot,” he explained. Lance looked up, having lost interest at watching Harry weak, failure of an attempt to fold a box nicely.
"I-you- a." Now it was Harry's turn to go red. His cheeks burned hot, and the sight of it egged Draco on - his embarrassment, Draco’s nectar.
Spotting no familiar faces, he let out a breath of pure unbridled relief. He felt the tension leave his face, his posture changing to a more relaxed one, as compared to the battle stance he was unconsciously in before. After all, no familiar faces meant no confrontations.
It had been six months since he had moved into the apartment in London, yet he still blamed himself. ‘Selfish, ungrateful son.’ He remembered his Mother calling him. He knew it wasn't really her speaking, but the words still hurt more than any crucio he had ever endured. Afterall, she would always be Draco's mother. It was now one of his favourite ways to describe himself. He was, afterall, unworthy of his upbringing.
Not two minutes into his walk to Briar Rose and Draco was already regretting his choice of clothes and his poor life decision making skills. The bitter cold had a way of wicking away body heat faster than it can be replaced. It was one of those days when normal clothes weren't enough, and they feel thinner than what they actually were. A thin layer of snow was starting to gather on top of his head, the whiteness of his blond locks causing it to blend in perfectly. In the frosty morning air, his skin looked paler than normal despite the blood rushing to his cheeks and nose, making him look like a washed-out watercolor painting.
Although it had been chilly outside, the temperature at a low 2°c, Draco only had his favourite black turtleneck, ripped skinny jeans and winter jacket on. He had been feeling to depressed to dress himself up, and he had simply picked the clothes that smelt the cleanest.
"Are you determined to keep me in this store?" he teased, quietly letting out what sounded suspiciously like a giggle. Harry couldn't think of a good response but continued to hold onto Malfoy's arm. Draco pulled his arm back, trying to break out of Harry’s iron grip but to no avail. Draco gave him a mocking smile.
He was already feeling light-headed and nauseous, and Potter didn’t seem to be a great help with that at all. Draco could catch the smell of his cologne, a light combination of vanilla mixed with cedar and sandalwood, along with a strong woody smell from the lit candles in the air. He could also catch whiffs of coffee beans, flour, and cookies in the air. He suspected he was looking at a part-time kitchen disaster and potential cookie thief.
"Potter," Draco replied, his trademark smirk hanging proudly of his face, crossing his arms in a similar style and sinking back and disappearing into the couch even further. Harry leaned forward towards Draco, about to argue back when-
Draco couldn’t fully comprehend what was going on. The kiss had been initiated by him and had started slowly, soft and innocent, chaste and sweet. It had then swiftly escalated to a full-blown battle, all tongue and teeth, their lust for each other stronger than ever.
Harry whacked him on his head again, harder as compared to before. Lance let out another injured yelp before giving him a pout. Harry merely rolled his eyes and focused on making another order. He poured a cup of coffee, this time sober enough to do so without burning himself.
Unlike most Hogwart students, Draco had no holiday plans or friends, most of them being dead or in Azkaban. He'd be lying if he said he said he didn't blame himself. Some of them, like Pans- Parkinson, were outright avoiding him. He couldn’t blame her for her decision.
Harry buried his face in a throw pillow he grabbed from beside him and Draco disappeared into his castle of pillows and blankets. Draco thought he heard a muffled scream, borderline shriek.
It was a rather popular afternoon tea spot among nearby residences, an open secret among close friends. A hidden gem guarded by locals, the coffee shop was like an treasure locked in a bank vault. It's very existence was like an urban legend, the stories of it's legendary coffee and tales of its heavenly expreso spread by only word of mouth, as no solid information about it could be found online.
His heart was starting to ache, his chest throbbing and his lungs burning as he continued gasping for breath, begging for just a mouthful of fresh air, a breath of relief, but unable to grasp it.
Malfoy cocked an eyebrow. He tried suppressing a wide grin but ultimately failed. He could tell from Harry’s prominent blush and lack of rejection that he most liked him back, or at least didn’t completely hate Draco. He had a chance. Draco grinned. Harry’s usually honey brown skin which bore much resemblance to that of smooth caramel, had a certain rosiness, borderline crimson to it.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, his brows drawing together to form a line. He tilted his head, confused. He looked around, head turning left and right, up and down, as if the answer to his questions were hiding somewhere in the room, playing hide and seek with him. Draco smirked. Harry looked like a lost puppy.
Harry blinked. Once, twice, three times, before he hopped into action, wincing slightly at the sudden movement. Harry whacked Lance on the head as hard as he could and grabbed the package, walking swiftly around the counter to chase after Draco, almost dropping the cupcake the third time in the process.
He quickly shook the snow and ice off himself, brushing his hair back before entering the shop. Briar Rose was a quaint around-the-corner coffee shop, ran by a sweet muggle-born couple, both a ripe age of 80.
Harry gently pulled Draco closer, deepening the kiss. His tongue gingerly prodded Draco’s soft bottom lip, politely asking for entry. As his heart pounded in his chest, Draco complied, opening his mouth slightly. He felt Harry’s tongue prod at his lips, coaxing them open further.
It was the middle of winter, and London was freezing. Feeling like a frozen turkey, a lone Draco Malfoy stepped into the toasty warm coffee shop, his five senses immediately assaulted by an indulgent array of feelings. He took a deep breath, immersing himself in the familiar bittersweet scent of roasting coffee strong in the lively atmosphere, sighing in relief as he felt the bitter chill of winter leave him.
Draco wrapped himself tighter in his borrowed blanket. He stared into the black abyss of his coffee cup, frowning at the bottom of the empty cup disappointedly as if he were expecting extra coffee to appear in his cup if he looked away.
Harry blinked, very frazzled. His lips were still tingling from their kiss. He stared at Malfoy, holding his breath.
Somedays, Harry would see her holding small thin glass vials of colourful ‘fruit extract’. Others, he saw her waving her feather duster around in a ‘swish and flick’, although she always insisted when asked by Harry that she found it to be ‘the best way to clean’.
It had been a typical Monday morning for Draco, one that could have gone much better, if he does say so himself. 'If only it wasn't for that sudden betrayal,' he murmured to himself with a slight roll in his eyes, as his words were lost in the thick gravy of different accents, drowned out by the mindless chatter of other customers.
“But you didn’t,” he replied, giving him a toothy smile. Smooth git. Harry rolled his eyes so hard he thought they may pop out of their sockets. Lance grabbed a cupcake carrier from below the counter, passing it to Harry.
Harry’s hands were dangling awkwardly by his side as Harry tried figuring out what to do with them. In the heat of the moment, he decided to place them on Draco’s slim waist gently, careful to not startle him. He closed his eyes, savouring the moment. They were oblivious to the world around them, their lips latched onto each other’s as if someone had locked their lips together and had lost the key.
The sudden temperature drop from the night before was more apparent than ever, the roofs and streets dusted with a thin blanket of snow, as if someone had dusted powdered sugar all over the city. It looked like something out of a fantasy, though the fairy tail like scenery was quickly shattered by passing vehicles and passerby. Thankfully, the temperature had rizen, if not slightly, to just above the temperature for snow. The streets of London were wet and slippery, glistening with a layer of condensation, a tell tale sign of the frigid temperature and of the melting snow.
‘The sun doesn’t work like that! How on earth is that even possible.’ Harry had said one day. ‘Magic.’ he said matter of factly, adding a wink and jazz hands for that special effect, was the reply he had gotten from Lance. Thus began the start of a great friendship. ‘A chaotic neutral bromance.’ Lance insisted on calling it. He had made Harry look like the normal sane one in their friendship, even though Harry was the ‘boy who lived’. A shooking feat no one but him has ever accomplished thus far.
‘Why couldn’t Potter just mind his own business?’ Draco acknowledged and understood that Harry was worried, but couldn’t for the life of him understand why the dense idiot even cared about someone like him. Didn’t he have work to do? Why would he even bother caring about some useless bloke like me? He quickly masked his confusion behind a fragile mask of bravado. After all, a Malfoy never shows weakness, even in the form of confusion and (god forbid!) uncertainty. Harry had already seen through enough of him today.
It had been almost a year after the great war had ended, yet it felt like yesterday that he had been in the mansion, on The Dar- Voldemort's side.
He knew it was for the best when she had decided to move out, the growing tension in the small apartment growing harder and harder to bear as the days went by. However, things just weren’t the same without Ginny in the house. Shortly after, Harry had been offered a full-time job at Briar Rose.
“Truly, Potter.” He replied, watching Harry slowly fold the box into a 3D shape, his eyes narrowed in concentration. He was taking more time and effort than what he put in regularly when folding boxes and the box looked less lopsided than his usual standard.
“I would like a sextuple espresso with extra, extra whipped cream and six white tea macaroons with a side of whipped cream,” he listed, pointing towards the glass display at the side. Harry looked up from behind the cash register and cocked an eyebrow, unimpressed.
“We weren't flirting!” Harry sputtered after a few minutes of awkward silence, finally emerging from his cave of shame, trying to justify himself in a futile attempt to prove his innocence to no one in particular.
“Goddammit,” he cursed himself in a low voice. 'You’re in public for goodness sake,' he thought to himself. 'Pull yourself together’. He stumbled to the corner of the waiting area, balancing himself on the wall. He closed his eyes, a futile attempt to blink away the white and back spots dancing a merry tango across his vision.
He swallowed, feeling like he ate a rock. It hurt so much. He just wanted it to stop. Was it too much to ask for? He felt something wet fall down his face. It also down his cheek, staining his top. Tears. He was crying.
Draco let out a slow, controlled breath and attempted to loosen his body movements. He rolled his shoulders back and forth before tilting his head left and right to stretch his stiff aching muscles, earning a few satisfying cracks after sitting in one position for too long. His body felt sore and rigid, his joints aching.
'No one cares about you.' His breathing got more and more erratic. 'What is your problem? For once in your life, why can't you just be nice, it shouldn't be this hard.'
Draco laughed to himself at the irony of it all, his voice still a little hoarse and breathy sounding. It was probably because he was so light-headed and out of it, but at that moment Draco thought Harry Potter looked simply angelic. How cliche.
He stared into the distance absentmindedly, looking through the grand frosted floor to ceiling glass panels, watching as the snow softly fell outside the shop, painting the city white.
Draco got in line, shedding off his heavy winter coat. As he waited in line for his turn at the cashier, his thoughts drifted away.
This was it. He had made his decision, and nothing was going to change his mind. Thus, for the next 2 hours, there Harry stood, leaning against a brick wall, staring at the white kitten, waiting outside the pet shop until 10:30 am.
Draco sunk deeper into the plush piece of furniture, wrapping himself tighter in the blanket. He hugged the red pillows closer to his chest, letting out a barely audible low rumbling sound from deep inside his throat that sounded suspiciously like a purr.
"I didn't know the great Harry Potter enjoyed working for mud-bloods," he said, watching Harry write down his order onto a paper cup. Harry simply ignored him, though traces of annoyance could be seen in the slight dip of the corners of his mouth. Draco winced at Potter’s reaction. He hadn't meant for himself to sound so condescending. He attempted striking up a conversation again. “Are you proud of yourself, Potter?”
Draco moved over to the waiting area. He felt the pit inside him grow, his stomach twisting in knots as heat spread up his back. 'Look how badly you just messed up,' he thought to himself. 'You are incapable of being a better person.'
Harry’s furrowed his eyebrows, the edge of his thinly pressed lips pointing downwards, heavy with worry. Although Draco’s breathing was less erratic than before, he wasn’t looking much better than he was before Harry came. His eyes had glazed over, and he had on his face a blank, almost dead expression. He looked dazed as if he was there physically but was not mentally. ‘Is he disassociating? Maybe he's going through depersonalization or derealization.’ Whatever the case was, the concerned crowd of patrons slowly gathering around them and the worried stares of students were starting to become a huge problem.
‘Like a Plimpy out of the water’, as his father used to say. His hands were cold and clammy, beads of cold sweat sliding off his face despite the warmth and humidity of the shop. His head felt like a sledgehammer was pounding on it. He felt like it was splitting into two under the immense pressure. Tears slide down his cheeks, staining his turtleneck. He couldn’t think, see or hear clearly.
"See you tomorrow, Potter,'' he cheered. Seeing that there were no cars, he hopped off the sidewalk and skipped across the zebra crossing. “My new coffee machine doesn’t arrive for the next few weeks or two,” he shouted from across the road. He lied. Draco didn’t understand why he did that.
The items he spent on ranged from a cheap on sale 2 in 1 fur brush and comb for 2 sickles, to unneeded too-expensive luxury pieces of furniture like cat stands, litter boxes, beds and carriers with starting prices of 20 Galleons, a good 5 Galleons more than what the kitten cost. Needless to say, Harry had spent too much. He regretted nothing. By the end of his mad shopping spree, he had spent at least over 100 Galleons. He had lost count.
Harry watched as the snow came down lightly, dancing in the golden sunlight, a choreographed graceful ballet conducted by the gentle wind. When Harry saw that Malfoy was completely gone. He let out a much more audible sound. With Malfoy gone his brain began to switch gears from defending himself from incoming verbal assaults to his dwindling self-esteem to processing what had just happened.
"Draco," Harry raised his voice ever so slightly, "answer me.” He paused for a moment, giving Draco time to process what he said. Draco hiccuped and blinked, stirring just a little bit, although his eyes were still heavy with tears and his pupils remained fairly unfocused.
"Apology accepted," Harry responded coldly, not even sparing him a glance before he went marching off to make Draco’s order.
Harry looked like he survived another war. He had scratch marks, bite marks and small puncture wounds all over his body in different shapes and sizes, his battle scars ranging from tiny bite marks to large foot long scratches. His whole body was throbbing.
‘Something was amiss’, Harry quickly decided. It was as if Draco were just a shadow of his former self, a hollow shell. Harry could tell he was wearing a mask but couldn’t for the life of him figure out why. He was so distracted that it was only when he looked up over the counter towards the waiting area did he realise Draco’s current state.
“Merlin, Potter. I know I’m handsome but this attention is a little bit much, don’t you think?” Draco scoffed, breaking the awkward silence. He emerged from his protective cocoon, reaching out to grab the red porcelain plate his macaroons were on, swiping his index finger all around the plate, catching all the loose bits of sugar, before proceeding to unceremoniously stick his finger in his mouth. Draco looked up, only to see Harry staring at him. Draco blushed in embarrassment, his cheeks hot with a rosy blush painted on his face, making his lily-white skin stand out.
He was freaking out. His breaths were coming out in short puffs of vapour, but he wasn't having a panic attack. He combed his hands through his hair slowly regaining his composure. He looked up, letting the snow fall and rest on his face. He felt the snow melt, cooling down his burning cheeks. Breath pale against the numbing winter air, he walked back to Briar Rose, cupcake in hand, before stomping back to behind the counter.
‘Like a rose.’ Harry thought to himself. It was the blush of roses, the peak of champagne pink. The colour infused cheeks dimpled with a blossoming smile, much like a sunflower blooming in the golden mid-summer sun.
Not 20 minutes had passed when Ginny had startled awake from another nightmare, but this time without Harry by her side. Mrs Rose had been serving customers when she noticed Ginny shivering, her face drained of blood, her lips pale. She had quickly called Harry over, and with both their efforts in reassuring Ginny and encouraging her, paired with a dash of classic humour, they had effectively calmed Ginny down in record time.
“How about this charming young sir give me a sufficient reply to my question?” Harry suggested, quirking an eyebrow, completely unimpressed.
"Are you sure Malfoy?" Harry hunched his back and bent down, leaning in closer to look at him, his nose almost touching Draco’s. Draco swallowed, his mouth feeling as dry as the burnt-toast-that-was-partially-on-fire-for-a-few-seconds he had for breakfast a few days ago. That was the last thing he ate before spiralling and going into an all coffee mode.
“That makes things difficult. We’ll have to insure that she meets only the right sort of suitors. Perhaps Severus can be of help as well, once we settle on an optimal husband for her.”
“Maybe a bit.” He admitted, then grasped Harry’s arm desperately as he started to turn away, “Not like I let the Dark Lord think! Just…Harry, I want you to
Harry seemed to take the hint, wrapping his long arms around Draco in a way that made him feel more utterly safe than he’d ever thought possible.
“Should we be concerned?” Harry asked, casting a glance towards the doorway, where the sounds of Thomas and Cloud amusing the infant with funny noises could be plainly heard.
“Mind your spittle, Weasley. It can be considered a personal insult and grounds for a duel. That you. Would. Lose.”
Draco offered a quick prayer to Merlin to save him from sentimental, well-meaning-idiot Gryffindors.
The nickel continued to sink through the base of the suspended pan, and Jonas ducked down to watch it ooze out through the sheet of metal until it landed, with a plop, on the ceramic table, smoking slightly.
Minutes later, Jaimie had finished her role as bonder and stepped out of the room to find her Gryffindor friends.
“Yes…yes the Reflection spell is appropriate, very good Harry. But these wands are no longer a perfect match.” Ollivander mused.
“Yes, Harry. Royal courtships end with the spilling of blood. Creating a new familial bond through marriage calls up some extremely powerful ancient magic.”
“Is that why you’re looking for Harry right after dinner? Because you’re so balanced?” Jamie smirked.
“Severus. Nothing to be done about it, I think. It’s fortunate the door was locked, or we would have been in the midst of that.” Dumbledore soothed the distraught Potions Master until the explosions subsided.
“Hmmm. So it operates upon the will through emotions. That’s quite typical since the connection is powered by Love magic. I think you may be able to extend your range of freedom, and the time you can be away, through Occlumency. I can teach you a few exercises to get you started.” Draco said.
“Do we have a deal?” Thomas purred, leaning intimidatingly into the personal space of one Orpheus Greengrass. The boy looked caught between humiliation and a terrifyingly hungry adoration directed towards him. He met Cloud’s eyes across the room and rolled his eyes. After playing politics and power games with the fifth, sixth, seventh years all evening, talking a normal eleven-year-old out of the bunk by the window was childishly easy.
Now to find Potter. Draco wanted to set the foundation of the spell now, away from the interfering old man who apparently had the ability to sense new spells occurring around him.
ceremony to vanquish the Dark Lord, and then of course he’d had time to conjure a temporary mirror in the palm of his hand after Molly Weasley had hugged him.
Draco hesitated only a second before he pushed his hand into the churning cauldron, pain searing up his arm as it ate away his skin. The next incantation came out as an agonized scream.
The two looked up guiltily, and found a boy their own age standing on the other side of the cradle, wand raised threateningly.
“My lab! They’re destroying my laboratory!” he sounded rather panicked, before resuming his assault on the door, the sounds of small explosions continuing on the other side of the door.
The note that would accompany the first gift was a work of art in itself. Intricate swirls of calligraphy covered the rich gold parchment, gracefully drawing the eye to the words themselves.
Massssster Jamessss are far too enamored of thisssss usssselessss activity for my preference, Dreamer.” The Critic chimed in.
Draco slid his hand down the Gryffindor’s arm and clasped his hand, interlacing their fingers. Since Harry was momentarily struck dumb, Draco would get to ask the first question. Ah, how he loved being a Slytherin.
“Behind the bed curtains, so they won’t know we’re there. We’ll be in the foot of the bed, so they’ll only see the same lump in the covers that we’ve made to decoy them! And then we all jump on the one that goes for that bed while the others are beating up our empty beds!”
“Give this to Helios…no, wait. Give that back.” Draco scowled. Better not to trust either the Muggleborn or the impulsive Weasley to observe proper protocols. He modified the charm to deliver a sharp jolt of pain to any unauthorized tamperer.
“Wait! Wait, I’ll see if Mr. Weasley could be spared for this matter!” the goblin begged, walking backwards to the door of the office before disappearing in a manic rustle of limbs.
“Do you also swear that in choosing such memories, you shall adhere to the greatest possible advantage of Draco Malfoy with respect to his future dealings with Harry Potter, without attempt to prevaricate, alter, or edit the extent of such memories in an effort to minimize that advantage?”
Draco refused to let his mind wander towards a certain green-eyed Gryffindor whose skin emited burning magic at a touch.
Robes swirling behind and around him, showing off glimpses of the rich, dark, glowing green of his rare dragonhide boots and belt, drawing attention to his toned legs and slender hips. A flash of silver, the Malfoy crest on his hand, now wearing the long ponytail of purebred Lordship…Draco knew he held the ladies of Hogwarts in the palm of his hand.
In an explosion of movement, he was suddenly buffeted by four pillows, wielded with all the violence of desperation.
“Did you say you finally killed that disgusting creature?” Lucius asked mildly, stepping out of the Cabinet.
“Potter felt that the marriage and any additional courtship should wait until after the current war is concluded.” He informed her.
“Oh, but Lord Malfoy! We’ve already established that our experts are far more advanced than your consultants! Your money is very safe here! Now, if not the credit stones, perhaps I might interest you in-”
Ah yes. Potter’s fetish. No doubt Potter was quite hard right now under his robes, only inches from Draco’s very fingertips. Draco thought back to that Pensieve memory, he knew Potter’s erection would be nut-brown, with a vein of purple running up the underside, the pink head just peeking out the opening of-
“Oh, don’t I know it. You’ve wanted him for years but I never thought you would actually…oh Merlin, this is
“Harry, don’t ever try to give me fashion advice. You’re horrible at it. Now be quiet. I’m nearly done.”
, his father had warned him a thousand times about the dangers of forming such attachments outside the family!
“No, not that. It’s. I would rather have it out to start with – the war was over our relationship with your world, and I grew up within and fought for the ideological camp that lost that war, with the result of us having this conversation now. Do you see? I was a, as you would say, a wizard supremacist. All my life, this was my core belief, and yet today, I find myself speaking comfortably to a muggle, feeling comforted by your unmagical hand. I, you cannot possibly understand the horror this had for me, near all of my life, and now, it is nothing. The things I sacrifices! The things I
“Merlin, you were right. It’s going to be hard.” He muttered, and started re-evaluating the strength of the precautionary spells he’d planned. Would the raw strength of Harry’s lustful magic overwhelm them?
Draco nodded approvingly. This would finally be a way to give Blaise the information he needed to choose the winning side without any risk to Draco by revealing it.
“Anyways, the alihotsy and scarab take a while to react. In those amounts, and with only one-seventh of it stirred the same direction as scarab, a good ten hours or so.” Draco assured him. “You’ll want to make yourself puke after class, of course, to make sure it’s not still in your stomach.”
Through deft manipulation of his image, Draco Malfoy-Potter had managed to use his role as the architect of Voldemort’s defeat to catapult himself to an iconic-like status in the wizarding world that very nearly eclipsed that enjoyed (and hated) by Harry Potter himself during the war. His romantic courtship of Harry Potter and artful swindling of the power-hungry Dark Lord into willing participation in Harry and Draco’s Marriage Ritual culminating in Voldemort’s destruction had quickly made him a living legend in the wizarding world…especially to this younger generation that hadn’t grown up on tales of the Boy-Who-Lived.
“Regulus and I have defeated other monsters, it’s true. Why, only a few months ago one of them attacked our baby brother, and we stopped it. We’re unbeatable!” he bragged.
“Merlin! That’s…my father compiled detailed reports on just about everyone who’s anyone, didn’t he?”
“Ask him to meet me in the Great Hall at midnight. Tell him I said he should make sure nobody sees him.”
“Dumbledore, Dumbledore, Dumbledore! Theee old foool hasss ssssstruck us with his chessssss obsssessssion yet again. And taken our ally to make one of us the insssstrument of the other’sssss fall! Clever old Dumbledore! And none of my Death Eater’sssss thought to consssssider the boy my heir! Crucio!”
Fortunately, Draco now saw through Potter’s admittedly devious strategy. And was also now armed with the knowledge of Potter’s strange sexual fetish, which was currently focused on Draco, his nearest living relative of suitable age.
The picture of Potter was still trying to avoid coming too close to the surface of the portrait. Draco took a deep breath and tapped his wand on the sigil of the single red drop.
me, the only distasteful thing for you to do will be two words, at the end, Harry. Can you cast just
“Malfoys have very delicate and refined palettes.” Draco informed him haughtily. “Nevertheless, I will come and eat anyways. I’ll have to see if Severus can provide a potion of some kind.”
The lightning suddenly shot upwards towards his face eagerly, through the steady stream of sick he was emitting. Draco went rigid as the lightning shot into his body that way, licking down to his stomach and causing the last bit of vomit to heave spectacularly out and into the cauldron in one horrible lurch.
Draco smirked at her. It was time for her to learn yet another layer of the Slytherin games of intrigue – the spy with two masters. Severus would be so proud.
“Oh…it’s a formula. The first part tells what his first impression was of you. ‘The very pretty boy with big green eyes’…awww.” She teased.
“Not so much. We’re okay, we just don’t have much in common. He and Regulus stick together, I stick with Scorpius.”
Draco noticed that Dumbledore hadn’t protested this line of questioning. Clearly he wanted surety of Draco’s sincerety as much as the others did. Well, now you know what I’m after, you nosy old man, get me out of this!
be done, Harry. It simply must. You’ve barely escaped with your life how many times? You are powerful, but the Dark Lord is powerful
Harry’s words devolved into a loud, low groan as his entire body suddenly bucked, his limbs going stiff and his face contorting into an almost pained expression as his penis expanded in Draco’s hand, firing several white ropes of his seed across his bare chest.
In a slightly different place, Regulus and Lysander crept quietly through yet another castle corridor.
emotions rather than the more debilitatings lingering behind it, waiting for an ounce of kindness to set him to weeping and raging.
Blaise nodded. The Dark Lord would be eager to regain access to the Malfoy family vaults and artifacts: Draco could take up his father’s former position any time he chose.
Elsbeth Gloryflower, Pansy? There’s no way Potter would have kept an Heirloom from her.” Blaise objected.
Draco couldn’t imagine a space around him where another person could possibly fit in the room. Little rodents indeed.
Oh yes, Draco certainly would not mind having Potter’s attentions focused on him this way for quite a good long time. The Hundred-Year-Honeymoon spell would most certainly have to be among the many elements of the alliance, along with the decision of who was to carry the three Heirs they would need to produce for the various lines they represented between them, and of course things like doweries and such.
Severus Snape, accompanied by Albus Dumbledore, were hurrying down the corridor, Snape’s robe’s billowing out awesomely behind him.
“Not unless you keep it down for hours. I’ll personally make sure you regurgitate every last bit of it right after class ends.” Draco promised.
The Black line could use an advantageous marriage alliance as well, for more appropriate reasons than money. Aside from the obvious importance of Potter’s powerful blood, Potter’s
“Yessss! Now be quiet! If we get caught in here there will be SO much trouble!” Lysander hissed at him, tugging relentlessly on his hand, studying the movement of the local invisible creatures for a moment before pulling Regulus decisively to one carved door, its intimidating surface inscribed with three massive characters, “H1B”.
“My grandfather, Abraxas, joined the Dark Lord Grindelwald and swore himself an enemy of the Light.”
Draco was uncertain whether they’d yet sunk so low as to actually inform the enemy of his ruses to foil her plans to fatten him up. If they did, things would be that much more difficult. As it was, Draco was aware that he’d taken in over 40% more calories than he’d used within the last 24 hours.
Harry quickly distracted himself from his embarrassment by digging shamelessly into the food. After they had eaten in silence for a while, Harry finally broke it.
Of course, Draco reminded himself, this scroll was created before the Dark Lord had met the infant Harry Potter. He clearly hadn’t had nearly as much time to prepare so many defenses since his rebirth only a few years ago.
he wouldn’t be after Harry if he didn’t have some sneaky plan ready! This is perfectly normal for marriages between people who have some reason to be suspicious of each other.”
“Well, this ritual plays upon the tricks of light and reflection. When you look at the wands at first, you see four wands, the two real wands and the two reflections. Then with the water, you see four wands and your own reflection, right? But now I raise the original up out of the water.”
Draco nodded back. Their spirits could request nothing in this negotiation but forgiveness. But the plea was clear. The portraits would be brought together somehow.
“Hmm? Oh, Harry…just doing some research for when we finally bond. The Black library has so much material I’ve never read.”
“Besides, Snape knows you inside and out by now, doesn’t he?” Draco asked, thinking of the Occlumency lessons.
Draco slowly withdrew the volume and carefully placed it on the desk atop the one he’d last been reading. Clearly the Black magic wanted him to know something in particular.
“Cool, thought so. So yeah, Australia, Antarctica, about eight different parts of Africa – watch out for the snakes in that place, they’ll give you some crazy times but so not worth the backlash, man. Oh, and we even popped up to that Muggle moon colony, duuude the Aurors were so pissed off about that, apparently everything up there is closed circuit television and they had to do so many obliviations and bring in squib experts to hack the computers, it wasn’t pretty.”
The twins maneuvered around to the other side and looked again, taking in the scrunched up face and the shock of white hair.
“Shhh, dude, it’s not this place. It’s just a curse to be different. Nobody gets you. They just don’t.”
“About fifteen feet.” Draco agreed. “But it may be possible to stretch that, I think some experimentation is in order. Thomas?”
Draco smirked. It was a bit out of date, but his father’s scroll on Tom Riddle was still sitting on a table in a certain sublevel. A simple comparison, and he’d have his answer.
Harry looked up into his husband’s silver glowing eyes. Ran his hand up his cheek, fingers carding into the free-flowing white-blond hair.
“Potter doesn’t know any better. Whoever’s courting him is obviously one of the finer pureblood families.” Pansy sniffed. “I’m sure they’ll make sure their offspring don’t share Potter’s…proclivities.”
And, he realized, he was himself shaking with agony at seeing Harry’s pain. It didn’t bother him that Harry grew hard at torture. No doubt, Voldemort’s alien pleasure was transmuted over the link to a form Harry’s mind and body could interpret.
He was echoed by hundreds of similar gasps as the Great Hall collectively got their daily headlines.
Draco walked into his office and immediately opened the entrance to the sublevel. Minutes later, he was walking once again into his father’s scroll chamber with it’s treasure trove of information.
Draco had, of course, excluded from the list all the physical intimacies from handholding to lewdly described sexual acts…although some of those descriptions sounded anatomically challenging enough that Draco wondered if they were part of some bizarre muggle ritual.
“Well, now, don’t worry. I’ve not allowed my duties as Lord of Malfoy to distract me from the call of my mother’s line in distress. I’ve arranged to put things right, never fear.”
The Gryffindors were in quite an uproar as well. Their hero was being courted and they had no idea by whom, but some mutters from Ron Weasley had made it clear that the unknown suitor was of the
“Oh Harry! It’s beautiful! Look at the jagged angles, this wasn’t cut or carved, it was grown! And it’s pure diamond, it must have taken decades to create!” Granger breathed.
?” He screwed up his face and gave Tom a stern look before lecturing in a very high, squeaky voice. “Infants are very fragile, maybe one day I will let you hold Scorpius…if you prove yourself
“My grandfather, Abraxas, publicly declared your father, Bilius, a blood-traitor when he married the mudblood witch Alice Barclay.”
“Not impossible. If Potter is powerful enough. But if that’s true, the only reason he hasn’t completely wiped out the Dark Lord is because he doesn’t know his own power, or how to use it. Yet.”
“The Mark is coercive in nature, of course, with a foundation of irrevocable consent twisted to a blanket agreement.” Severus said. “It’s ritual magic, so the emotions matter.”
“Well…she knows a lot about it. I can’t really talk to her about it without getting lost. Nobody can. Maybe you could-”
“Oh. Uh, a dude is just…a person. Like, ‘man’, except it’s not right to make assumptions about someone else’s gender identity. So I just said dude. ‘Cuz with the Spurts climbing all over you I knew I had to say something, but I don’t really know you, so I was just like, ‘dude’. You know?”
daughter, who would be getting to know her father now if he hadn’t lost his life on one of your little missions, Potter? You know, I suspect if Sirius hadn’t been so distracted with his best friend’s son, he might have spent that time looking into Ministry records of his case and found his daughter. You owe this to her, Potter.” Draco argued forcefully.
“Beware of claims of objective truth. Convictions are worse enemies of truth than lies. A brief stroll through an asylum shows that faith proves nothing. Instead realize that all things are subject to different interpretations, and which interpretation prevails is a function of power, not truth. So beware, that when you declare someone an idiot, you will feel frustrated if they turn out not to be. Many fools remain faithful to causes for no other reason than that those opposing it continue to annoy.”
And the greatest fear…well…the etching on the pitiful grave marker was barely legible, but Draco was fairly certain it bore the Dark Lord’s name. The Dark Lord feared death. Which would have to be true, considering the ludicruous number of Horcruxes he’d created.
“Well I suppose there is that, though I wasn’t aware they had the facilities to go beyond mathematical theory here.”
Harry swatted his husband on the back of the head as Hermione started cooing and making faces at the infant. Tom watched it all with suspiciously bright eyes.
And Harry was suddenly sobbing, and Draco was holding him in his arms, soothing his tears with a frantic tenderness that escalated with the painful sight of every salty little drop.
Then…a rich green glow appeared around Potter’s hands, his insane, raw, powerful magic there, visible, and Draco reached desperately for it.
“I really don’t know what Potter’s mood has to do with a marriage contract. But my father is no longer the Lord of Malfoy, I am, and will decide for the family myself. As for our past interactions, that was one of the most common muggle courtship rituals…is Potter from a sect that doesn’t utilize that particular ritual then? You see…I don’t
Harry followed suit by levitating the second and third, and the five of them quickly passed out the doors to the vehicle waiting outside.
“I assume you’ll want certain assurances, sir. An Unbreakable Vow will be sufficient, I think.” Draco said.
The scroll was already laying out on the low table. Draco unrolled it and tapped his wand to the icon of a shield with a crack in it.
“And so the proposition carries. The Jelly-Legs Hex is heretofore reclassified as a Schedule B Hex with a maximum punishment of five house points, unless carried out against a student more than three years junior to the perpetrator.” Anthony Goldstein, the clerk of this meeting, announced.
“In case you’ve all forgotten, Potter is currently being courted according to the very finest wizarding traditions.” Draco reminded them. “Clearly, the Founders line isn’t going to disappear anytime soon.”
He shrugged. They’d get over it. They’d have to. Harry’s hand was still tightly holding his own, giving him a brief squeeze now and then, despite seeming to give his friends his full attention.
“Do you, Draco Malfoy, swear that you will never reveal what you know of concerning Professor Snape’s activities and allegiances in the war, to his detriment?”
how this was supposed to go, a small voice in the back of his head seemed to be saying. And it wasn’t. If the son of Lily Evans and the heir of two Founders had to be so powerful as to sweep him away on their honeymoon, Draco’s pride insisted on having his own form of dominance over the Gryffindor beforehand. A blowjob would have the inexperienced boy quivering in his hands, and signal Draco’s role as the teacher of the shy virgin in this relationship.
“Let’s move down into the basement for this.” Draco interrupted. “I don’t think Tom needs the sort of attention this is going to bring.”
From an impressively warded jewelry-box came the remaining scrap of the very length of ribbon that had formed the heart of the protective Talisman he’d created for Potter in this very room.
“And he’ll know exactly where you’re sleeping. So when they all come in here, like hairy vampire-ninjas, he’s going to come right to where you’re lying asleep, and his big hairy arms are going to lift his pillow up high over you…waiting…waiting…and then their leader will give the signal…
Draco nodded. So Harry could add Sight to his list of talents. It wasn’t a typical Slytherin or Gryffindor trait, which meant Lily Potter must have had some new strain.
“This isn’t that kind of inheritance. The Marauders are the Marauders, it has nothing to do with blood. Except, maybe the tendency to become a Marauder kind of person is inherited.” Potter retorted.
Not to mention the small task of leading said Gryffindor with a hand curled around the elbow, just below the swell of a bicep which kept hardening and rolling under his fingers…
“Potter very nearly killed me, sir. I expect if he hadn’t spotted the Snitch at that moment, he would have dashed us both to the pitch at that speed. He is insane sir, he shouldn’t be flying.”
Harry stared for a moment longer, then raised his hands, trembling fingers fumbling with the buttons of his robe, refusing to look down at what he was doing, eyes drinking in the sight of a naked Draco wading in a gigantic crystal basin of twinking water.
“Bellatrix, I have a title and I expect it to be used in a formal situation such as this one.” Draco snapped. “I killed the werewolf because first he had the temerity to touch my person in an inappropriate fashion, and then he caught the scent of a school full of children and was about to jeopardize the mission by going hunting prematurely. You had no business taking him on a mission this delicate.”
The device, of course, predated the development of sufficiently precise warming charms that house elves later could aim at their masters beds during the night without risking injuries…which practice also predated the more general environmental control charms that the Manor was now imbued with.
seem interested in her, but purely in a non-sexual way. Perhaps Potter didn’t care for the flesh of relatives that happened to be so young.
“Wha-“ Potter turned large, betrayed eyes on Draco. He seemed to be aware something had happened but not what.
But Lucius knew in the absence of its master, the Mark would be sensitive to a new dark lord awakening in the world, a potential future master who only had to claim his mark…
Draco leaned forward and spoke into the juncture of Potter’s thigh, his breath carrying into his pubic hairs around his scrotum.
An ambulance could be heard just outside the windows as Fred and George unceremoniously dumped their burdens onto the large revolving, heart-shaped bed that dominated the center of the room.
As Bellatrix organized her team, Draco nodded to Lucius before picking up the canvas bag and its contents with one hand, and the bonding knife in the other.
The Malfoys could be destroyed. After the debacle in the Department of Mysteries, Lucius was fully confirmed as a Death Eater, no Imperious defense this time, and an angry populace was crying out for the rest of the Malfoy blood. Or more specifically, the Malfoy gold.
“It has to be immersed in liquid state of course. So the components of liquid form the mathematical base, and we need a neutral vessel with no interactive components.”
in their cosmetic potions?” Draco asked, stunned. His own shampoo set consisted of five steps, one potion to clean his hair, one to serve as the basis for various styling spells, one to heal any breaks or brittleness, one to remove the harsh smells left by the previous potions, and one to imbue his hair with his trademark vanilla scent.
Potter’s tense face relaxed, and his eyes lit up as he turned to Jamie and started narrating some wild adventure with Padfoot and Moony.
Lucius’ eyes widened, flitting between his son and the unassuming eleven-year-old boy standing quietly between his two grandsons, now.
to be protected from disclosure, which meant some other reason for that doubt needed to be put forward…an alibi of sorts.
to me, Potter! And forget the Dark Lord! Do you know how many Light families would love to get revenge on a Malfoy? Do you know how many others would withdraw their support in the war if they knew? And what about my Aunt Bella – she’d torture me and send you a howler of me screaming for the fun of it.”
Harry Potter-Malfoy looked around at the assembled heros. Draco, Severus, Albus were there, and projections from Hermione and Ron, of course. All a little worn, a little weary, but all willing and determined and
“We need the numbers! They have really hairy arms, you know. Did you see? So much hair!” James fretted.
“Now, if you two are quite done pawing at each other, please do find a room, and use the appropriate spells beforehand? Ronald’s mother would never forgive him if the two of you had penetrative intercourse while Ron was busy with me.”
“Well, you’ve done this bit of magic before. I suggest you and Tom trade wands for this, though. This wand has cast the Killing Curse on you before, and you’ve cast Unforgivables of your own, so it will be more in tune with you than this innocent lad.”
Draco took that horrible limb and forced it near his own face. Grimacing. He had a strong stomach, even this wasn’t enough. He put two fingers in his mouth. The taste of his own oozing flesh did it for him.
Actually, Draco wasn’t all that fond of all the bowing and scraping that seemed to go on in Death Eater meetings. Or Cruciatus, for that matter.
“And since when have Malfoys lived only by our instincts? You taught me in all things to use my mind first, to analyze and dissect and then to analyze my own thoughts before I even begin to scheme! Perhaps your instincts are old and useless but your mind and wand are not! You are no longer Lord, you are free to go out and learn new things, new ways of thinking! So
Clearly, yet another example of the consequences of hereditary magic left without the stabilizing influence of a blooded Heir.
Readers: Thank you for your kind and enthusiastic feedback! I've gotten busy since I started this, but each time I get a response it makes me start thinking about this storyline again and wanting to finish it. So, please, continue to write back!
have some perfume in it, I think to mask the chemicals…sort of like adding extra chocolate to make a potion taste nice.”
Well. Fenrir really didn’t belong on this mission, the Dark Lord would just have to accept the loss.
The Aurors set about putting a chair in the center of the room, and Draco was unsubtly “encouraged” to sit in it. The Aurors lined the walls, except for Shacklebolt, who sat next to Dumbledore to the front of Draco.
His presence there in front of them was…well…there was a reason his classes would be subject to very strict prerequisites for qualifying grades in related core classes.
So. The Dark Lord truly did dream of a brighter future for the wizarding world, and not one based on endless torture and pain. He wished for respect.
Potter held out for a good three seconds before falling to his knees and retching explosively into the toilet.
. You know. Raising them. Being parents to them. I can barely even remember my parents…I don’t…I don’t know how it’s supposed to be.”
“You can’t even tell me how long this is going to go on! You’ll both be in a much better mood towards each other after eating.” She insisted.
The pain was dimming. Apparently the nerves had been charred beyond functionality and it was just the surrounding nerves that were reacting now.
Draco would have to be sure to reveal all of what Harry already knew…but to reveal too much would also ruin his plans for the powerful Gryffindor.
Harry’s eyes widened in shock, and in a flash he had turned and sprinted to their bedroom to retrieve the heirloom.
A beautiful red-haired woman with Potter’s same green eyes, flashing protectively as she shielded him from someone.
shouldn’t be kept waiting.” Arthur protested. He turned to Draco, expecting him to confirm his impatience.
“She’s in a separate wing. And you’ll love her, besides. I thought you would want to get to know her, considering...” Draco stopped on the edge of the touchy subject of Lily Potter.
“That’s entirely unacceptable. We’ll just have to change it to something appropriate. How about Polaris Capricus Black?”
confident in my consultants, you see. Still, I would like to make sure. Perhaps you would be willing to help me test my wards to see if they are worthy of their task?” Draco raised a speculative eyebrow.
“Mate, I thought you were going to back off the whole…thing.” Ron said, looking from Draco to Potter.
“Good one, ‘Mione. Or, Trelawny’s secret love-child, and he’s having a vision! Or he’s from the future! Or- OW!”
“I came as soon as I got your owl, Draco.” Her sharp eyes took in Tom, softening as she saw the way he shielded Scorpius from view. “It’s like I predicted, then.”
"There will be…I mean, not everybody is going to be cool about this, you know. There will be…assholes."
“So. What we’ll do is slightly reduce the amount of sopohorus, and increase the glumbumble to make up for it. But then we have to increase the alihotsy as well to counterbalance the glumbumble. But what we’ll do is, when stirring in the alihotsy, on the seventh stir, we’ll switch directions to counterclockwise.”
The last time that had been necessary was after the second fall of Napoleon. Dark Lords seemed to have a confusing habit of having to be defeated more than once.
“You’re invulnerable to most curses. But if you get hit my magic gets weakened. Keep that in mind, please.” Draco reminded him.
Draco sat there and watched his boyfriend sleeping. Innocent, peaceful – free of the weight of responsibility Dumbledore and the wizarding world had placed on him at a young age. His rosy lips creased lightly in a small smile as he slept.
A solitary eyebrow raised to acknowledge her, the eyes – a silvery gray color, she noticed – not leaving the wild black-haired boy in the yard.
“That’s…that’s…” Granger seemed to have a rare moment of struggling for sufficiently inflammatory terms to describe her disgust at such a system.
The other boys crowded around. James hurriedly grabbed a few Exploding Snap cards from where Frankie had tossed them, and arranged them in a semi circle like their beds.
Potter was squirming deliciously now, barely able to move in Nagini’s secure hold on his wrists and ankles.
“Good. Tonight, why don’t you get to know Lysander better. She seems like a good friend. Is she a she?”
“Kindly avoid insulting my relative and the youngest representative of the Great and Noble House, Zabini.” Draco snapped, removing the girl’s portfolio and shoving the binder onto Blaise. “I’ll be finding my cousin myself. See that the others are properly approached.”
Draco sighed, and performed a few quick cleaning and neatening and starching charms, restoring her robes to a reasonable state for a well-bred twelve year old.
Severus was telling him indirectly that he should try to reverse their present antagonism. But was that even possible?
“My adopted brother has a runespoor as a familiar, and I was able to bargain with them for some very valuable intelligence about my new guardians.”
“Holy fuck!” Draco cradled his hand, stunned, looking up to see a horrified Harry Potter looking at Draco’s hand, then curling his limbs in to himself as if to prevent them from ever touching anyone else, peeking up at Draco’s burnt hand guiltily.
Draco took a large step to his left and pivoted counterclockwise, sweeping his vision from right to left as he turned, disarming a Death Eater as he turned.
“You’re serious.” Granger sagged. “Look, Malfoy. It might be a bit more complicated than you realize. In the muggle world, same-sex couples are often quite looked down on. Those who have tendencies in that direction, if discovered, are looked down on. I’m pretty sure Harry’s relatives are quite homophobic. If…if you have some reason to think Harry’s attracted to you, and I have no idea why you’d think that, he’ll probably resist it because he won’t think it’s
The boy was a notorious ladies man, he’d never had any liaison that even hinted at a marriage contract, and most parents were sufficiently wary of his mother’s influence to avoid approaching the wealthy Heir for a betrothal agreement.
are, Headmaster.” Draco snapped, then instantly regretted his hasty words as the Headmaster’s new subtle probes shifted oddly…clearly in an attempt to distract him from the even
Draco’s eyes snapped open and he looked at Harry’s earnest face, feeling something inside him glowing with some unknown magical energy as he continued.
“Yeah, you’re right. Sorry, mate. You should open it, at least. You can always return it to Malfoy by the end of the day, we’ll help you with the proper polite refusal.”
He looked down at the talisman he’d just tied his magical core to. He knew his own scroll, if updated, would now show this little bundle as his greatest weakness. An attack on it’s rightful owner would cause it to suck magic out of Draco, sending the attack back on its source. And leaving Draco weakened, possibly completely drained into a temporary squib, depending on the strength of the attack.
“I’ll get you for that little betrayal later!” he whispered, “For now, get up on the couch. I have a present for you.”
Flint blinked as if from a daze and shook out his hand, watching a moment as the plant scattered into little bits of crimson light and droplets of blood that spattered, unnoticed, on the older boy’s stubbly chin.
There was a moment of silence as the twins artfully dodged the small town’s constable, ducking into a narrow alley, one twin pulling out what appeared to be…a garter, the portkey quickly whisking away the four of them to…an anonymous hotel room.
“Mr. Malfoy. I have raised my children to regard your family as a nest of evil from which only despicable things crawl. I have tutored my youngest son to treat you always with disrespect and implacable distrust. I have spoken into every ear in the Ministry and also in public that your family as a whole can only spawn a variety of despicable and irretrievably malevolent individuals.”
Kreacher produced it from suspiciously deep beneath his ratty old towel, eagerly offering it up to Draco.
“Of courrssse. But tell me, young Lord Malfoy, why you do not offer a life-long gift asss your fathhher?”
“And for once you are quite incorrect, Solicitor Murdoch. I in fact wish to dissolve the contract formed by my father, and also seek your help in drafting and negotiating a new contract with another party.” Draco corrected him.
“Finite. Accio wand!” Draco caught the wand and advanced on the boy, grabbing a handful of shirt and jerking him upwards while he was still horizontal. Potter was still horizontal as Draco pulled him face-to-face.
“ENOUGH!” He shouted, the magic somehow twisting his voice into a deep and powerful bellow that shook the corridor in a way that wasn’t caused by the movement of the train.
His closest ties…no surprises. Granger. Weasel. Then the rest of the Weasleys. Lupin. Dumbledore. His other yearmates in Gryffindor. Faint lines attaching to the rest of Gryffindor, and various other members of different houses, even a line tentatively attaching itself to little Jamie. Varying connections to various professors, and one disjointed line reluctantly attaching to Professor Snape. Draco smirked at the angry red line attaching itself to his own portrait.
“Can’t I be? Do I have to cast the deadly curse, or is it sufficient to provide the opportunity for personal vengeance?”
Harry looked at him uncomprehendingly, and Draco sighed. He’d known getting into this that some house training would be required.
Draco thought a moment. Obviously, Potter drew his strength from the people around him. People he was close to. Which explained why he’d been so angry at the suggestion of donating his memories of Sirius.
A tall lanky teen laughed uproariously as he tumbled in the grass, a large black dog and a small crowd of children rolling on the ground with him. Chuckling some more as the big wolf managed to pin him on his back for a round of sloppy doggy kisses.
“What? Oh yes! Well it looks like Mr. Riddle here is fully manifested already. No drain, none at all. The infant is clearly glowing with magic. Why, he’s already got Harry’s eyes, by Merlin’s depleted left ball! Hmm, I never did figure out why he used up the left one, the Greeks always used the right testicle for that enchantment, perhaps the old man was senile and forgot. I’ll have to look into that before I grow senile myself. Never too early to start working on my memoirs, either, hmm.”
seem to get along well, Potter’s eyes flashed as he recounted some particularly wild prank, and Jamie’s captivated grin was, in Draco’s calculation, quite genuine. Give it a few years, perhaps the “big-brother” tone Potter was taking now would turn into that “love” he had been going on about.
The students and teachers applauded his placement, so callous to the personal tragedy being enacted right before their eyes.
“You’re right. I should have sought your counsel first of all. I don’t think the Potter’s courtship can be our only source, though. I have the sense that Lily Evan’s sister and brother-in-law are quite dissimilar to Potter’s parents. One thing Granger did tell me is that she believes that they are…what she calls ‘homophobic’. They would strongly disapprove of a courtship between males.” Draco said.
“Regulus?” James asked, incredulous, suddenly confronted with his brother’s terrified and betrayed face. “What are you doing here?”
No, they were still personal enemies. Potter wouldn’t take the hated Potions Professor into his confidence.
“You haven’t even gotten on the train and you’re in the middle of a ruckus. May I ask what could possibly cause you to cast a birthright charm in the middle of the platform like a beggar?”
“Muggles,” he muttered, disgusted. “Ask your Mu-…ask Granger, I’m sure she can tell you all about the facts of life. After she gets her hands on the appropriate book, of course.” Draco sneered.
“Draco. My study seems to have switched masters in my absence.” His father said, with the perfect amount of sardonic amusement coloring his voice, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards slightly as if entertained by some irony. His face looked worn, wrinkled in places it had previously been unblemished, the cheeks hollow and the eyes with only a glimmer of the powerful force that had burned behind them all his life. This worn face was carefully arranged in an expression of simple peace and dignity, the face of a man who has suffered injustice and has come with power to reclaim his own.
Damn Potter, he was far too clever behind that seemingly oblivious Gryffindor exterior. Draco reminded himself not to forget that his own godfather, surely the most masterful of spies, had been tutoring Potter in Occlumency.
Jamie stuck out her tongue and skipped merrily into the living room, where she was hugged enthusiastically by Molly Weasley.
“A-And then what?” A smaller boy asked him tremblingly, as if he already knew the answer but feared to hear it anyway.
The twins were very nearly identical. Both an even mixture of both their fathers’ features, except that James had his grandmother’s startling green eyes while Regulus’ eyes were the same grey as her own. No doubt, a difference made by the two ancient lines each claiming a twin as its scion.
It was just confusing to have this somewhat tenuous familial relationship, and the love that naturally would go with it, brought up in the middle of a discussion about Potter lusting after Draco’s body. It was almost as if Potter lusted after him
“Uh…I dunno about you, but I actually listed the recipe at the beginning. To take up space, you know.” Potter said, sounding a bit embarrassed.
“He was trapped in stasis for nearly a hundred years. When Harry…rescued him, well…you are somewhat aware of his own upbringing.”
The boy looked down at the child in his arms, then at the train. His arms tightened protectively around the baby as he scrutinized the bright red invader.
“A rival can manipulate more thoroughly than the closest friend, my Lord. If Bellatrix could stimulate Potter to an attempt at Cruciatus through badly-timed laughter, I will have him on a rampage of Unforgivables!”
“It is my study now, father. You are a convict, and therefore unable to act as Lord under the law. I had a time convincing the Manor that you are not, in fact, deceased.”
Potter was gasping for breath, and Draco found that he was breathing hard himself, his own manhood jutting out, painfully hard.
The white pillars of the candlesticks formed a cordon, all the way down the considerable length of the Head table, the gold candleholders with their exquisite carvings gleaming softly against the deep green of the tablecloth. The tongues of flame at the tops of the candles, up above their heads, like a line of soft-white fire casting shadows whose direction changed with the slightest puff of breeze.
“They are customary when courting the son of royalty, Lord. His Heirloom gift was the Crystal Sceptre, a weapon of the Malfoys of old.”
Potter sighed again, clearly enjoying the subtle aqueous massage he was receiving, and Draco suddenly felt the heat in the room multiply tenfold, a burning sensation coming to him through his wand, up his arm, and into what he knew was his magical core.
And then there was listed in much smaller print, just about every member of Gryffindor House, several Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, and not one Slytherin.
“Oh no. I won’t be taking over Grimmauld. Sirius had a daughter, and I’ve persuaded Potter to gift her with the Black estate as his rightful heiress.”
“Would you mind if I said hello to my godson again? The last time I saw him he was still wet and sticky and not too happy about the fact.” Hermione asked, holding out two very capable-looking hands.
Draco wrapped his arms around his prone boyfriend as best as he could and squeezed him snugly. The warmth of his body was making Draco feel drowsy, and the indefinable musky scent of his body from the nighttime sweat was pleasant and sweet. He could hear Harry’s slow, steady heartbeat where his ear was pressed against his chest.
As a result, the swear jar had been re-purposed for pet peeves. Draco had himself forfeited many a Galleon for making unnecessary work for the house elves (although everybody
“Lucius, surely Harry and Draco told you of their plans to adopt the other Slytherin heir?” Jamie said, with just an ounce of condescension in her voice.
Draco shook his head, rolling up the scroll. Some questions would take time to answer. He wouldn’t make himself Potter’s advisor just yet. If he chose to change sides, the time for curative analysis would come. And if he didn’t…
“Uh. It’s a series of books, they’re all sort basic introductions to the fundamentals of all sorts of different topics, for adults who never learned them but develop an interest late in life.” Potter explained.
“So! Have a great time!...Uh…Finite Incatatum!” George said, then snatched at the porkey hanging around his neck, a panicked look on his face as he disappeared.
“Very true. I approve, then. Perhaps we shouldn’t mention it to the other Houses, it never hurts to have a consistent advantage over the years.”
Those Marauders were ruining his cousin, Draco decided. He’d have to keep a close eye on the level of influence the Golden Trio would have over his offspring. The idea of a
James slams his hands together like a thunderclap, sending the other boys scrambling from their perches in terror,
Harry opened his eyes as Draco’s arms circled his waist, and willingly allowed himself to be pulled out of his chair to sit on the rich green velvet tablecloth below them. Draco cuddled him a for a moment until he’d calmed down, then twisted to look at his face.
