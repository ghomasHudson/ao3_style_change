Harry'd warned her to be on her best behaviour, but he figured this might be as close to that as she could get.
"Oh, I almost completely forgot due to the ah," he gestured towards Harry's chest who was starting to get the feeling that Malfoy was, in fact, gay. "I got the job. I had to apply under a fake name and I'm going to be wearing so many glamours I'll look like a regular at the Hog's Head, but I got the job."
"No different." He said it really slowly, like he was turning the words over and examining them for flaws. "You think we have that much in common, that our relationships with people from Hogwarts are 'no different?'"
The kettle began to whistle and he hurried through the process of making tea, feeling very watched as he did so.
Ron laughed and opened it. Inside was the invitation to the event at which Lucius had been killed. Ron's smile fell.
"What?" Harry was irrationally worried that he'd done something wrong and that now Malfoy would leave for sure.
"Work, I suppose. The ministry wants to close Wheezes. If I'm to save it, I need products, and this is," he gestured vaguely, "well it's what I've got so far."
"I've been spending the last 10 years trying to get the Aurors the proper funding. Do you know what a thing like this will do to us if she goes to the press? The ministry will eat me alive, my position as Head Auror will be compromised. Figure out an excuse and we'll see if I won't have to advertise in the Prophet for a new Auror."
Now Harry had to think about what would lead to his overall largest number of happiness spikes. For years, he'd been centering his life around the idea that that thing was a person. When he looked at all his friends and saw them happy and in love, he didn't miss the connection. However oblivious Hermione thought he was, it was impossible to miss some things. What if this date with Alicia was his only chance to find someone who wouldn't treat him like a hero because of something he did as a teenager? What if it was his only chance at love? And most worryingly, what if he blew it all over not being able to dance?
"Harry!" Luna cried, throwing her arms around him and then pulling back to give a quick peck on the nose. "We thought we'd come by and say hullo. Did you know it's a mess in here?"
"I'm not leaving till you summarize your life story. Please use as much detail as you see fit, though leave out the gross bits."
"You know, you deserve to be Potioneering. I might have taken a peek at your former professor. Severus was well regarded across the entire field."
your final— Just as he was about to cast again, his heel caught on a nail he hadn't seen on the floor.
He'd never in his life seen someone look so devastated. Mr Weasley wasn't doing well either, but he was strong for her, and for all of his children.
Ron came into the room without waiting, already halfway through his sentence. "Mate, what's this in the Prophet about you and Malfoy?"
"I thought, 'why not get Malfoy the tea he drank practically every morning at Hogwarts,' actually. But next time I'll save the three quid and bring you one of the stale Canary Creams we've got in the back."
"Yes, Potter, obviously I will be there too." His scowl softened ever so slightly, and Harry couldn't stop staring at it.
"Maybe just try getting your mind off it for a while. Some of our best ideas come to us when we aren't trying to think of them."
"She was just really worried about... you know." Harry wasn't sure he did but he didn't pry. "Any news?"
"Hermione, do you remember when you told me that how the public views something is all about how it's presented?"
The question came at a time when Harry finally had an answer. Ron had owled that morning to say there was an applicant who had answered all the questions perfectly and Harry told Malfoy this.
It was like they all realised it at once, when George died, how close to the end they'd been themselves. How much they'd stopped really caring about life.
Harry just gaped at her for a moment, and then he shook himself, an idea springing into his head clear as day.
Daphne called for the house elf who escorted him out and Malfoy followed not five minutes later. His eyes were red and puffy but he held up a handkerchief like the one Daphne had used proudly.
"You killed him," he said. His voice didn't show any hint of emotion at first and then his face morphed into a mask of anger. "You're.. you killed him!"
"This stupid project of yours to fix The Problem and find yourself a wife when it's quite clear that isn't what you want."
Smiling ever so slightly, Hermione said, "I haven't seen you this... engaged with anything in a long time. I think maybe a project's good for you, and I think you probably know that too."
Harry grabbed him by the feet and began pulling. He was used to this, and he knew by now that gentle coaxing, threats, and even the promise of bacon would fail. It was brute force or nothing.
"Well, I'm Harry. I like Quidditch and hanging out with my friends. I was a Gryffindor at school and I've always loved Defensive magic. I have a crup named Barkley."
"Expecto Patronum," he whispered and the stag erupted from his wand, galloping once around the kids and then dissipating.
"We— we can't just give up," he insisted, looking hopelessly between Ron and Ginny, the confidence draining out of him.
Harry flushed and gestured for Malfoy to follow him to his room where he threw on a shirt. "Why are you here?"
His big breakthrough came the next Tuesday when Harry was finally able to remove enough orange rubbish off the floor to reach one of the desks.
He propped his chin up on his hand shaking his head. "Well, first of all, how the hell are you supposed to talk to someone without seeing them? I mean, at least with the floo I don't have to wonder what they're thinking the entire time. And I have to rehearse over and over before I call so I sound like an even moderately competent professional! I can rewrite an owl as many times as I please. The whole phone thing is a waste of time."
"But it's rainbow," Harry said slowly, trying to emphasise his point. "Pygmies are pink. Purple, sometimes, but never anything like that."
The men frowned but Harry didn't care why. There was no use pretending he'd stumbled in here on accident. Malfoy wouldn't buy that anyway.
Later that night, Harry flooed back to Grimmauld Place and fell into his bed. He'd done sex things with a man. With Malfoy. No, not Malfoy, Draco. Draco Malfoy. He'd have to work on that. Harry Potter had kissed Draco Malfoy. Then they'd done a little more. And if he'd let him, Harry'd do it again. And again.
When Harry got to Courtroom Three, he paused at the sight of a familiar face. Blaise Zabini. What in Merlin's name was he doing here?
"I threw him in as the absolute worst. That way, every woman from him on you'd at least give a chance."
"Cuppa Joe, 2 p.m. tomorrow," he confirmed. Now that Malfoy had accepted, he couldn't make himself say no. That would be wrong. Worse even, then what he was doing.
"Anyway," he continued without noting the interruption, "Someone told me that in the muggle world you can get arrested for stealing Electricity from a train."
"Really?" It didn't look like an heirloom, more like something you'd get for a dollar at the flea market. Maybe he'd been wrong in his guess and the rubies were real.
"I could run a few diagnostic charms if you like," he offered. "It looks like a spin on the Midas jinx, but I hope for your sake I'm wrong."
After it was over, more women came up to him and begged him for a dance. He hid in the corner where he wouldn't be pounced upon as soon as he could.
On the cobblestone street, there was a single dusty shoe-print, right next to the outline of a foot.
He wrote to the six candidates asking for a small transfigured object so he could "test the effects of Pure-blooded DNA on magic longevity." Only four responded with an object and two others, both internationally located wizards which explained their absence at the Award Ceremony, opted out.
"Her favourite Quidditch team is Puddlemere U and she's interested in analysing auras. Plus she wants a kneazle or a cat."
In the middle of figuring out if there was a less morally dubious way to go about this, he got a text from Malfoy.
The street was mostly empty this time of day, but one young child and his mother stared as they walked past, making Harry feel exposed.
Suddenly he was rushing towards the ground, bright orange only inches from his face before he was yanked backwards, reeling to catch himself as the sudden action rocked him and whoever saved him back and forth as they fell out into the hallway.
"Stop moving, it's distracting." Malfoy's eyes trained on the tea in his hand, fingers thrumming on the handle.
It wasn't surprising that Narcissa would threaten Lucius over Draco. She'd defied Voldemort for him, Harry was sure she'd do anything.
He looked at Harry for a moment with raised eyebrows. "Potter, I haven't the faintest idea what problem you're talking about."
"He used to come to the Manor for Parties with his family. He gave me lots of sweets, but mother and father didn't like him much. His brother died, you know, but it was all very hush hush."
"I know about his job at Mungo's. And that he's a barman three nights a week. I know his father was murdered."
She mumbled something else to herself, but when Harry asked, she shrugged it off and started laughing again, so he did too.
What was Ron thinking? Surely even he had the good sense to not set Harry up with a Wasps fan. "I mean the worst team after the Cannons."
Ron whistled through his teeth and huffed out a laugh, patting Harry on the back. "Well, I suppose you're freaking out because it was more than a fuck or something? Develop feelings for the ferret, did you?"
He had one more sample to test, though, so he could know for certain if they'd found Lucius Malfoy's killer, or if they'd messed up somehow. He looked over at the flowers that were waiting on the counter by the machine, and then he realised he didn't have to test anything at all. He already knew.
"Just be yourself, Harry. No witch worth marrying is going to decline a second date with you because of who you are."
Inside Wheezes, Verity was arranging some dung bombs on a shelf. She smiled as they walked in, and Harry cast a quick Tempus.
"Quidditch game today," Harry replied, then he swept out of the room on his way back to the kitchen. He'd decided to take Malfoy's advice. Today, he wasn't going to think about the shop at all.
Ginny slammed her palm on the table and pointed at Harry. "Yes! There is absolutely no way the Bats lose. In your sad fucking face, Potter!"
It was Saturday evening and Harry never came into work on Saturday's but at least if they went now, Malfoy wouldn't have to wait any longer to know the truth.
Harry choked a bit on his drink, rolling his eyes. "You could use a phone to keep up with your friends, you know. It doesn't require a magical fireplace or anything, so it'd be worlds easier."
Hugo blinked at him and Harry stole him from Ron's arms and rocked him back and forth a few times before Hermione pointed at his high chair. "He needs to eat even if you don't."
"I realised the main problem I was having with this whole thing was thinking like a person instead of thinking like an Auror. I might not be one anymore," he quieted the noises of concern from everyone, "but that doesn't mean I was any less brilliant at my job." Malfoy scoffed at this.
"We got all the samples! With the parents so relaxed without their kids around, nice touch, by the way, even the most reserved ones drank."
"You're a bloody Auror, calm down. What are they gonna do to us in muggle prison? Lock the doors? We'd be out in no time."
"I'd have been happy. I would have." Malfoy stared out the window. "And besides, you're one to talk."
Harry leaned his head back against the metal door frame, letting the last glints of sun flash over his face. "Don't I deserve to be happy?"
They finally climbed the steps and walked a bit along the balcony until they came to a set of bright orange panels and a blue door reading, 'Messrs. Fred and George Weasley. Incredibly Impressive Upper Management.'
There was a small smirk on Verity's face, and he took a brief moment to wonder what house she'd been sorted into at Hogwarts. He'd assumed Ravenclaw up to that point but...
"He has always had a peculiar relationship with him. I tried my best to protect Draco, but he wanted his father's praise more than anything in the world. He would have gone on to marry and have children, all to please him. He took the mark for that same reason."
"Shove off, Ron. It doesn't matter, anyway. I totally blew it. He asked if I was attracted to him and I said no."
Zabini spotted him and clicked closed what looked to be a muggle cellphone, stuffing it into the pocket of his robes. He then smiled in his wide, disarming way, teeth gleamingly white, while straightening up his spine. He was certainly handsome—more so even than he'd been at Hogwarts, with his cool brown skin and high cheekbones causing a stark contrast to his azure attire—and Harry felt himself flush involuntarily.
They were out to lunch but Ron wasn't buying his innocent act. He gestured for Harry to show him what he had. Harry grabbed the box he'd been keeping hidden in his pocket and unshrunk it, allowing the contents to nearly spill off the table.
"No, I meant my reaction to your Problem. I still think it's stupid and that you've come up with an idiotic way to solve it, but you've done a lot for me and I shouldn't have been as offended that you thought I was romantically inclined towards you."
There weren't many handholds, but he was able to hold on to the window ledges and start down the side.
"I know you care about them all, Malfoy." Harry could tell he should drop it, but something made him keep pushing. "It's no different from how I feel about Luna or Dean. I'd miss them if they were away."
Then Mrs. Longbottom woke up. She looked directly at Harry and smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes.
"I've decided that the questionnaires will go in the paper, online, and anywhere else we can think of. You'll get hundreds of responses, seeing as you're Harry Potter."
He looked more disheveled than Harry was used to, and he couldn't help thinking it was nice seeing him like that.
At least Malfoy had Parkinson and Zabini, even if they seemed like two of the least pleasant people in the world.
Harry recognised that they must be near Wiltshire, which he supposed made some amount of sense, though he didn't like the idea of being so nearby to the manor.
He approached the machine and held out a hand for the hair Malfoy had taken to keeping on his person. Harry wasn't sure he'd want the hair of Voldemort if it existed, but maybe this parent-murderer/child relationship was different.
"They're very handy for chasing away Kelpies," Luna supplied, carefully combing Neville's hair forward with her fingers and then nodding at it, satisfied.
Malfoy's head bobbed and he and sat delicately on the couch. His face morphed into an expression he couldn't place. "Potter, something's moving in here."
"No offence, but I do think it would have been favourable to have gotten an answer to your previous question before asking me out."
"Well, that's because you're oblivious. You fancy him, admit it to yourself if you can't admit it to me."
The lab was empty when they got in and Harry let out a sigh of relief. Explaining why he was there to anyone would have been very difficult.
"I've been experimenting. There's a yellow one in the back too, but he's a nasty bugger. Tried to bite my nose off."
"Bollocks. That's exactly what he told me." Malfoy stubbed out his cigarette and lit another one. Hermione would kill him if he came over with the smell still on him. Harry didn't mind much, though. It reminded him of Sirius.
"Just because you're sad no one's ever wanted to do that to you..." The rest of the sentence he didn't hear, but Harry snorted and went to his room to change into something more Quidditch-Appropriate.
Zabini stuck out a hand and, after a moment's hesitation, Harry shook it. He didn't hold much against Zabini, after all. Despite being one of Malfoy's cronies, he'd never done anything all that bad to Harry and his friends, even if he was an arse.
"Unaware," Malfoy continued carefully, clearly considering his career as he spoke, "as to not think to hire a professional? Sure, it's costly, but you don't even know the charms for this kind of thing! And not to mention the modifications to the jinx. You could trigger a repeat explosion! Do you honestly think you can perform the spells with enough accuracy to clean the entire room?"
Harry smiled flatly at Teddy and pushed his plate closer to him so he'd take a bite. One he did, Harry answered his question. "I got a Portkey for 4 p.m. that will land in America at 11:02 a.m. their time. Once we're there, Malfoy and I have to find some people for a project, but that won't take long. We can spend the rest of the time exploring.
Malfoy spun around angrily. "No!" He jerked his arm away. "I refuse to put up with this. Either I mark your shop as failing and it closes, or you learn to be a goddamn adult!"
Malfoy let out a groan when Harry bit down on his neck and he thrust up. Harry could feel his cock through the layers of clothing and it wasn't enough. Harry worked down Malfoy's buttons and then threw off his own shirt. He couldn't stop to think, he'd done enough of that already.
Malfoy got out of the cab and met Harry's eyes. Fuck, Harry wanted this. He tried to mentally will Malfoy to leave.
Harry didn't know what to say, so he was quiet for a long while until Malfoy said, "What's this?" gesturing to the parchment spread out everywhere with a list of things to do for the shop.
Teddy grinned and Harry dove across the room and walloped him on the back of the head. It was good to see his godson smiling again.
Afterwards, Hermione told him he should have been less concerned with what was between her teeth and Ron laughed and said it sounded like he'd lucked out. They were both right, in a way.
After brunch, they took the Subway, as per Teddy's request, to meet up with a Potioneer who was famous in the States for inventing Hangover Eradicator which was as brutal and effective as it sounded. Malfoy was interested in talking with her because, as he finally admitted, he really had been trying to find an apprenticeship somewhere in the UK without any luck.
Then she flicked on the open sign, and it flashed a dazzling green and purple pattern twice before the bulbs finally fizzled out.
Luna did not seem fazed by this, and she simply took a seat on the couch, fanning her large stripey-green skirt out around her and calling, "Kreacher."
"Jones seems to have spotted the snitch, but Williams is not far behind, thank Godric — he makes a dive — oh! Wood is hit right in the face with a Bludger despite attempts at a Sloth Grip Roll. Will this mean the end of his two-month dalliance with Witch Weekly supermodel Nichole Dendron? A promising turn of events for men of the UK."
"I'm gay." His voice came out a little strained but he didn't let it stop him. "I like men, exclusively."
"Brilliant, could you swab it, I'm a little.." he gestured to his hands where he was mixing a drink.
"I know. And so do you, I've noticed. For that reason, I'm asking that should you find the person behind murder of Draco's father, you keep it from him."
"Malfoy," he said. While his voice was confident, Harry noticed the way his eyes flicked around the room before he said it, like he was checking to make sure no one else was in there. "But you may call me Draco."
"You were always rubbish at potions. Snape was five seconds from quitting every time you entered the classroom."
He didn't bother checking whose it was because it would take ages to uncover the little plaque sitting on the front, but that didn't matter. Once he got the surface back to normal, there was a product design right in front of him.
"Hardly." Here he scoffed and Harry took a step closer until he was only a few centimetres from touching him.
Harry turned to see a giant man in a bright red blazer and, to avoid his probable death, pinned him to the ground once he saw his face. The poor guy probably thought he had been about to hurt his buddy, but Harry didn't have time to worry about that just now.
Most men were wearing elaborate outfits of mesh or chains and Harry was pretty sure that's why the officer had stopped him at the door. Was this some sort of BDSM club?
Harry walked back over to the couch and was pleased to see there was still Firewhiskey left in the bottle. He took a swig. Barkley ran in from the kitchen and jumped up on the couch.
"You're never gonna get it to explode right like this," Seamus said, leaning in over Dean's shoulder.
"I'm not following." Malfoy cleaned out a glass and filled it with beer, handing it to the maybe-6thformer
The night stretched out before them and outside of the castle it was cold, but inside was warm and quiet and Harry managed to sleep peacefully.
His voice had taken on a hint of the jealous tone Harry knew so well from their Hogwarts days, and he sighed.
"Yeah, best to keep you on your toes." Ginny grinned at him, wiggling her eyebrows, and as much as he kind of wanted to strangle her, he was also glad to see a little bit of her old spark back. He hadn't seen her eyes shine like that for at least a year now.
"You really believed I was dumb enough to think I'd get contacted by my past twice in one month with no explanation? A man like me plans for these kinds of things, Harry."
Taking pity on Verity, Harry cast a Muffliato charm, and she must have noticed that the sound had ceased somehow, because the music was very quickly turned back down.
He gave her a tired smile. She was going to make a wonderful Mind Healer, that much he was sure of. He was glad she'd found somewhere to study further and that she was happy, but he missed her terribly.
Dean and Seamus shared a look and then raised their eyebrows at the other occupants of the table, two of which were being huge gits, not that he was naming any names.
He pulled out his mobile and swore when he remembered that she wouldn't have a muggle appliance in her wizarding company. He clicked on Draco's contact and texted, 'Leave now.'
Malfoy picked up a roll of parchment and scanned it over, his expression illegible. "You've put a lot of effort into this."
Malfoy spent most of the meal trying to explain to Harry why he wanted to find his father's murderer. It wasn't unbelievable to Harry by any means. The second he learned that his parents hadn't died in a car crash and someone named Voldemort was the reason he'd been living with his horrible aunt and uncle since he was one, Harry had been patiently (and sometimes not so patiently) waiting for that moment in the Great Hall when he killed him.
"My apologies." She drew out her wand and reparo'd the cup before setting it on the table with shaky hands. "What has he told you? Please spare no detail."
He shook his head, stopping in his tracks when he made it to the kitchen and saw his housemates there, Ginny perched on one of the countertops, a box of savoury biscuits in her hand, and Ron stirring some eggs around on the hob.
Harry nearly protested the second he heard the words 'Golden Boy,' but Malfoy had a point. Why did he want to help? More importantly, why had Malfoy been fine thinking he wanted to help because he fancied him when Malfoy didn't fancy him back. Theoretically, of course, because Harry didn't fancy Malfoy.
"No, no. All this means is that they share some genes with you. Could be anywhere from an aunt to a third cousin by the looks of it."
"So you hire someone. Actually, let me rethink that, seeing as hiring professionals is against your delicate sensibilities."
"You think I'm capable of spending even a moment in your presence thinking about my father when I'm not drunk of my bloody arse? No thanks."
Teddy needed to go back to Hogwarts soon, but Harry didn't think it was time just yet. Plus, he'd made other plans.
"All of my questions are designed solely to find you someone you're compatible with. Question twelve: How much Potter Paraphernalia do you own? Correct answer is (c) little to none. The question's harder to ignore because if we simply ask they'll say, 'I just think of Harry as a person,' only for you to get to their house and discover they've got a whole wall of your face."
She stared at him for a long moment, seeming like she was really considering it, but then she shook her head. "Sorry."
"Ah well, what do you know? Maybe you could take a look at my tap in the basement? I think somethings wrong with the washer."
"No, I did. Slytherin. I just don't think we should let house stereotypes control our lives now that we're adults. It's rather silly, isn't it?"
"No. We're here with Teddy for the next couple of days and I want it to be fun for him. So not only do you have to not be an arse about anything as unimportant as baseball, you have to stop being so hard to relate to before I kill you."
Even though Draco didn't seem to believe this, he didn't stop Narcissa from leading Harry into the Front Parlour and serving him tea. He did try to stop Narcissa from kicking him out of the room so they could talk, but she was pretty imposing and he eventually left.
Harry visited Ron and Hermione for dinner on Tuesday night. He was still feeling jet-lagged and this might have made his account of the trip somewhat less coherent than it usually would have been, but they still grilled him on it unreasonably hard.
Other than Joseph Rosier, Malfoy had only two other people on the list he thought more likely than any others. The first was a woman, Aaryan Fawley, who lived in Fawley Manor on the outskirts of Scotland, not too far from Hogwarts. The other, Hector Greengrass, had died from a rogue curse — at least allegedly — 3 years before. Fortunately, he had two daughters Malfoy had been friends with as a child. Malfoy arranged a meeting for that week and told them he'd be bringing along a guest. He didn't mention who it was.
He silently cursed Seamus and dug through the stack for something that would be less mortifying, unearthing one with a Centaur on the front, poised to shoot an arrow, and another that was shaped like Rita Skeeter's grinning head. He wished he'd paid more attention in transfiguration.
He pushed himself up onto the sink and through the window, careful to avoid cutting his hand on any glass. At the last moment, he ducked back in to grab a tissue and shoved it in his pocket.
Harry considered her for a second. Hermione had told him that she'd been hired earlier in the year because of her interest in charity. There was no logical reason not to let her keep flirting, so he did.
"Of course, Amber." She beamed at him and he noticed her dwindling glass. This could be a perfect opportunity. "Could I refresh your drink for you?"
She patted the seat. Harry was on her other side, and Ron was next to him, with Lee taking up the other end.
"Potter," he drawled. "I can't say I'm surprised to see you, but this certainly is an unusual circumstance we've worked ourselves into." He nodded at Zabini. "Blaise. Effective as always."
"Yeah, whatever." Malfoy threw his powder and disappeared in a swirl of green flames, calling out "135 Kennington Lane," as he went.
He went on to tell Malfoy about various absurd or strangely specific crimes he'd heard about or witnessed the arrests for and Malfoy listened intently.
Orange. Orange everywhere. The desks, the walls, the floors, the ceiling... not a single thing free of the explosively bright colour. It was like he'd never seen orange before that moment, and he'd spent a lot of time in Ron's bedroom during the summers between Hogwart's visits.
"You don't want the stuff to really blow up though, do you? That's not what the twins wanted, at least. Dispersal, that's the goal. Different sort of spell you'd need to work with."
Ten minutes later she lead him up to the stage and the crowd broke out into applause. He tried not to hide his face from them or let his smile falter because that would mean an excerpt in the paper the next day about the 'Blushing Boy Who Lived.'
He turned without saying anything else and Harry stared blankly after him before Zabini patted his shoulder and pushed him forward.
Malfoy snatched it up, thumbing through the pages quickly. "This is barely anything." He was right, three pages, uninvestigated, open and shut. "They found the DNA of two people near the crime scene and there was no investigation. No witnesses, no cameras-" His voice was getting closer to shouting with every word and Harry cast a silencing charm.
"When I first opened the case file for the Malfoy Murder Mission, I knew a few things. Number one, there were two samples of DNA from the crime scene and Number two, Narcissa Malfoy had been absent on the night of the murder so there were no witnesses. Then, I learned a few more things. I learned that Narcissa cared for her son more than anyone on the planet and that she'd do anything to keep him safe, even from her husband." He ticked this off as three on his fingers. "I learned that Draco was engaged to Astoria Greengrass after the war and only broke it off because of her health, even though she was the only woman he would have been happy marrying. I learned that he then got engaged to a new woman he'd never met in order to produce an heir upon marriage, an engagement that dissolved with his father's death. I visited Finnley Shaw in New York and learned that he was close with the Malfoy's when they were young, and he wanted to keep the killer's identity from Draco as well. I wrongly assumed this made him the killer. I tested DNA sample after DNA sample that all, yes all, came up negative, and I learned that no matter how pureblooded the pureblood DNA was, it was never as close of a match to Draco's as the original DNA had been. And finally, upon visiting Narcissa, I learned that Draco was right in his estimation about how much she cared for him. She wanted to keep Draco from knowing the identity of his father's killer because it would only hurt him more. Why would this information hurt him? It wouldn't if it weren't for the fact that the killer was-"
"If I may offer you a word of advice, Draco's mother was always so concerned with how everyone felt about her. If Draco's anything like her, he feels that pressure too. She waited, though, until she found someone she loved enough to commit to. She wasn't the type to settle down just because she was betrothed to someone. Lucky it worked out for her."
Ginny pushed his feet off her coffee table and sat down in the chair across from him. He put his feet back up just to annoy her. It'd been a while since they'd last saw each other, but despite his worries, nothing had changed.
Malfoy was in a mood from when the Portkey landed to when they checked into their rooms. Harry and Teddy got a room with two queens and Malfoy got his own space which Harry followed him into once Teddy got settled.
His outfits weren't conventional if you considered how most pureblood wizards dressed. Even his dress robes were on the wrong (or right depending on who you asked) side of indecently tight. On the night of the Glamour Incident, he'd been especially attractive. For a guy. Obviously.
The room was large, bigger than he'd been expecting. It was lined with magic-proof wood panelling and fibreglass, and it had about a dozen machines that did Merlin-knows-what spread out in two long lines.
Ron whistled, "So just small talk, then? Merlin, mate, you've really gone and dug yourself in deep. Have you had a slumber party yet, or braided each other's hair?"
"Yeah, I thought so. But do read it over, I've seen newspapers from after you show yourself in public. It's never good."
She sat at the table, barely managing to prop her face up on her hand, red hair falling over her eyes like a sheet. "You're the worst housemate ever. Ron agreed it wouldn't take much for us to kick you out, just a couple jinxes and maybe a nice," she yawned, "imperius."
"I can't even get a wisp!" a fourth-year girl complained. She'd been brought along with her mother and really only talked about how much her heels hurt and how bad she was at defensive magic.
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy wasn't what it took. It was all the sleep deprivation that was making him so "calm" as Ron put it, and he told him so.
"Dear Merlin," Malfoy murmured, his hands clasped in his lap, "do you think the whole stadium can hear him or just the few hundred on this side of the pitch?"
"Nah, but Harry here's a Puddles fan. At first, we had him outnumbered, but now..." She gestured to Lee in his blue and gold face paint and Malfoy's eyebrow twitched up ever so slightly.
"Well, I—" Harry sputtered. "I don't know. It just doesn't fit with the idea of you I've had since school."
Three days later, Harry was digging through all of the 'M' files there were and not having any luck. If only he could have asked the filing clerk, but it wasn't legal for him to access cases without express permission from Robards, and after sneaking in under his invisibility cloak, Harry was pretty sure Peter (that was the clerk's name) wouldn't have him on his good side.
Harry huffed out a laugh. Wasn't that a thought. He'd been wondering the same thing himself, really, and he still hadn't found an answer. Was he going to sign on with Robards in the spring? Was he going to try for anything at all?
"Oh Er... abstracting electricity is a crime, sorry. I've heard of that case and the sockets weren't for public use."
Draco snorted. Ever since he'd taken the job in America, weekends had been their time. After his check-in with Burnes at nine his time, he'd use the Hogwarts International Floo to get to Harry.
"Hey!" Verity shouted from down below and they both quieted. "Would you two shut it, already? You're scaring away my customers!"
McGonagall knew he was an Auror, she'd helped him prep before he was hired. She also knew that it'd been his dream for more years than he could remember.
He left and Harry looked at the paperweight Ron'd transfigured to a chair and back. Harry stuffed it in his pocket.
Harry wanted to do anything in his power to get away from the strange energy around their interaction so he turned to Neville.
"Potter, I think I owe you a thank you. This is really a huge thing to do for me, it's been eating me and my mother up for years now. Do you think you could meet me for coffee tomorrow at that place about a block from the ministry? Cuppa Joe? Maybe around 2."
Everything seemed to be going fine otherwise and Harry couldn't have predicted any possible problems. Hell, if all had gone well, he might have even gotten laid that night. That was until halfway through the meal when Maria got a chunk of spinach stuck between her teeth.
Dean reached away from Seamus toward the coffee table, where he fumbled for the cardboard box sitting atop it.
"When I was ten, my father took down to the ministry to show me his work and I threw a fit. I didn't want to be there, I wanted to be home and less bored and surrounded by sweets. He reprimanded me, of course, but when we got home my mother gave him the silent treatment for a week. She claimed that telling me off in public was unnecessarily cruel. If you ask me, it was the path of least resistance. Did you ever deal with someone telling you off in public?"
Harry had better ideas about what to do with free moments but he wasn't going to bring them up now. Plus, he and Narcissa always managed to take up more time than planned. Usually, it was because they'd take a walk to Andromeda's grave together, sometimes they just sat and talked.
"Ha!" Malfoy scoffed. "Are you actually so bone-headed as to think that treating me like the thestral shite on the bottom of your trainers will solve your problems? If I quit, Potter, it's game over for you. Do you know why I'm here?"
Harry got the impression that Malfoy hadn't told the woman the whole story and that he was relying on something other than tolerance to get the sample. Possibly a memory problem.
"Hello. At work," Malfoy said to whoever was on the other side. Harry could partially make out the person's voice and they were definitely talking louder than necessary.
He was humming to himself as the bacon cooked when Ginny finally stumbled in. She was wrapped in her fluffy polka-dotted dressing gown, glare so pronounced he was sure he'd still be feeling it tomorrow.
Harry let himself imagine the concerned look Hermione would have on her face if she were there right then and smiled.
And then Harry was kissing him. He wound his fingers in Malfoy's stupid hair and tugged it until he groaned. He slotted his legs between his thighs and pushed him back towards the couch.
"If you really want to make good on that bet — " Lee sat back down — "I'm gonna need some basic assurance."
"I don't know. The shop was your investment. Maybe a part of you feels like you'll be really losing them if you let it go. And maybe you're tying up your feelings about the war in it all too. I have no idea what I'm saying, really. Don't take it too seriously. I haven't gotten to the Emotional Grievance Over Your Best Friend's Dead Brothers' Shop Foreclosure portion of my studies yet."
It was nice out, not too cold For January, and at Draco's request, Harry grabbed a bottle of Elderflower wine from the cupboard where Kreacher kept it for them to drink. It considerably lightened the atmosphere.
He started mimicking one with clear practice. It reminded Harry of when he used to look over at the Slytherin table and see Malfoy contorting his face to mock him. It was considerably funnier now.  His voice went from high, posh, and aristocratic to low and grumbly or accented like someone from the states. At one point he took up a Cockney accent and Harry was startled enough to snort wine out of his nose.
"That's why it's still such a mess," she said. "Sorry. We left it at first thinking that Mr Weasley—George—would take care of it himself, but... well, he never did."
Until suddenly it was Friday and he was getting owls from Malfoy and Verity asking if he'd fallen off the face of the earth somehow, and one from Neville saying they were all getting together for a drink that night and would Harry consider 'dragging Ron out of the house to come since it might be good for him.'
'So what now?' Hermione's words tumbled around in Harry's head. He'd spent the last few months falling arse over tea kettle for Draco Sodding Malfoy, and there was no going back now. He'd committed crimes, he'd lost his job, and he'd mourned the death of a loved one and the first chapter of his life. Now was a time for new beginnings, now was a time for moving on.
He unzipped Malfoy's trousers in a rush and shoved his hand into his pants. Malfoy's eyes flew open and he squeezed Harry's hips so hard he was sure it would bruise. It didn't matter. Harry stroked his hand along Malfoy's cock and Malfoy's mouth moved, trying to form words and not finding any except for a broken moan.
He got Ron a t-shirt that said "I ❤️ NY," and Rose and Hugo race cars that looked like a Taxi Cab and a Police Car respectively.
"Yeah.. maybe. Look, I'm knackered." He stood up and stumbled before Harry grabbed him so he wouldn't crash. "I'm just gonna apparate home."
It was a new one—usually, they were more grounded in reality—and he made a note to himself to write Andromeda about seeing his godson again soon.
They were allowed up and took the lift. The woman who opened the door looked like she was in her late fifties. Her hair was dyed red and her lipstick matched, but the strangest part about her was the Brooklyn accent. She was friendly and invited them into where she'd set the table.
Harry nodded and walked towards the cart. The waiter glared at him distrustfully but just as she was about to say something, she looked in Malfoy's direction and took off across the restaurant. Harry didn't hesitate and grabbed the fork Mrs. Fawley had used, stuffing it in his pocket.
Harry didn't know. He thought about him and his parents, who he loved but had never truly met. He thought about Sirius and his mum and dad, who Sirius had claimed to hate but maybe hadn't. He thought about Hermione, who had erased her parents' memories for their own safety and the Weasley's, who had taken him in as their son.
"Brilliant," he murmured, mind racing with possibilities, not feeling nearly as stuck as it had before. "Could I look it over for a sec, though? Make sure it's healthy?"
"Nice day," Malfoy commented dryly, while Harry attempted to catch his breath. He was right. It was sunny, but the air still felt cool against Harry's skin—the type of weather that Mrs Weasley was always complaining London didn't get enough of.
"You need to get her to eat something too," Ron mumbled. "She was holed up in her room all day yesterday. Don't think she left once."
They got back home and Teddy flooed to Hogwarts where McGonagall was waiting for him. Harry looked around his empty flat. It felt strangely cold without Teddy and Draco.
They apparated to the Hog's Head where glamours were definitely allowed and Malfoy ordered some type of wine Harry had never heard of but was apparently the only drinkable thing on the menu. After a few minutes he stepped outside to take a smoke and the barman approached Harry.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, sniffing disdainfully. "Alright then, chop-chop. I need to do my preliminary viewing of the shop so I can make an initial assessment."
"Whoa, no way. You're too drunk for that. You should take a sober up, first." Harry's arms were still around Malfoy's middle and it was starting to get uncomfortable. He let go to where he was just keeping him steady with a hand on his arm.
The woman was approaching them before Malfoy had a chance to invite her, propping one arm up on Malfoy's shoulder and jutting out her hip. Harry saw the way Ron's eyes trailed up her long legs and felt an irrational pang of concern on Hermione's behalf. It wasn't like they'd promised to one day get back together or anything, but Harry had kind of... assumed that they would.
He got up off the couch and moved the cushion with his wand. Underneath was a blue and white bone that was shaking back and forth, not enough that Harry had noticed.
"Better mine than hers. Besides, she's got two kids already without needing to parent me. Three, if you count Ron. "
"Hmm, let's see," said Harry. "I could either have you, the man who hates my guts and is probably going to give me a bad review regardless of how well the shop does, or I could have a fan. Now, I'm not usually one to take advantage of fame, but that seems like a pretty easy choice."
It was nice. Her lips were soft and tasted like the sharp burn of alcohol and coconuts. He pulled away before it got too far.
"Fine. Whatever. But it's not like that with me. I still talk to my friends because I care about them."
"You know when my mother and father were courting, she told him that if he ever embarrassed her, she'd call it all off. Once I was born she told him that there was nothing in this world she wouldn't do for me and that if he ever embarrassed me, harmed me, or did anything of the sort, there'd be hell to pay. My father adored me, of course, so there was nothing to worry about, but you know that."
Not an original owner, not the only person currently competent enough to manage the store, but just what it was left with.
His face still had an uncharacteristic parlour to it and so Harry ordered two more shots and said, "So who do we test next?"
They headed to a less crowded street and apparated back to the hotel. Malfoy told him on the way about how Patricia had thought he was working undercover with a death eater operation to recruit her and failing that, steal her DNA to use for a crime scene setup. She also thought he had imperiused Harry.
Malfoy's eyes were cold, but with his hair all out of place and his chest heaving, he looked the most human Harry'd ever seen him.
"Nicola." She considered him for a moment before sticking out her hand for him to shake. It was covered in rings, one of them was a ruby-encrusted lion.
"It's like, just because I could do anything I want to, people think I should give up what I really want to do something impressive."
There was one more stop to make before the final step in his plan. If things went wrong, he'd lose his job. He couldn't seem to make himself care anymore. His heart hadn't been in Auroring for a long time now.
Hermione fire-called to tell him to come over for breakfast again the next morning. He repeated his usual efforts to get out of bed and arrived just after 8. The kids would already be up since it was a Wednesday and Ron had to be off to work earlier.
The woman's name was Alicia Baldwin and according to Ron, she'd answered every question the way Harry's ideal partner would. The only problem was that Alicia was a gold medal-winning ballroom dancer. The good news was that his reputation for being a terrible dancer had been mostly kept out of the papers. She wanted a partner who could dance and that was perfectly reasonable, but Harry couldn't. Yet. He was half-convinced Ron had done this to mess with him.
Harry spent the rest of the night watching Malfoy smile at him and Teddy looked at Malfoy pityingly before glaring at Harry. What in the hell was going on? Was this some kind of hatred born from him being Teddy's guardian now instead of Andromeda? Fuck, he was not ready to raise a teenager. Would it be so bad if he ended up with Malfoy? Surely the Wizarding world would go insane, but Teddy's two main guardians being together couldn't be terrible. Unless the broke it off. Fuck, what if they broke it off?
Two men noticed Harry staring at them and smiled. He nodded at them and pushed through the dancing people to get to the Bar. If he was looking for Malfoy, this was where he'd find him.
He was sure that more was said, but Harry was so wrapped up in his internal thoughts that the next time he looked up, Malfoy was standing directly in front of him and Zabini, and the room was nearly empty, court session over.
"Thanks, I guess." He hadn't meant to hurt Alicia so badly, but it had all just felt wrong. She had been perfect, and it had felt wrong. What did that say about him? Maybe he was just looking for any excuse not to let himself be happy. He'd read about people doing that.
Ginny groaned. "Why do you hate us? We have never been anything but kind to you. Took you in for the Holidays, let you eat mum's cooking, I even sucked you off once."
"The parents are missing their children. I'm not sure what they'd say if I told them they were all studying."
"Oh, well that's good, right? You didn't want your assists being stripped away any more than I did."
"It was the only way, love. You were setting yourself up for a miserable existence, married to a person you could never truly love. No one should have to suffer that. He'd already taken your childhood from you, I couldn't let him take the rest of your life too." Narcissa's voice was remarkably steady through all this, though her hands shook as she placed them on Draco's arms.
"Mr. Potter." all the magic stopped and the Patronuses dissipated. When Harry turned around to face McGonagall guiltily, he couldn't help feeling like a child again.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, scoffing. "Are you really so completely and utterly—" he cut himself off, and Harry guessed he should consider himself lucky for that.
"Other way around. Pansy got her hooked on it and she forced me to get one. Said it would be better than owling."
"Well no, see, the one on the right, the blood, that one is similar to you in energy strength and it signifies a strong genetical bond. The other isn't similar to the first any more than most would be, but it also has similarities to yours in energy strength and emotional connection."
When he got to the room, Mrs. Longbottom was asleep. Harry hadn't known it before, but Frank had apparently died years earlier. He felt sorry he'd never asked Neville about that.
A house elf opened the door and lead them into a room where Daphne Greengrass, a woman Harry vaguely remembered from Hogwarts was waiting for them.
When he'd imagined Malfoy working at a bar, he'd thought it'd be some sort of posh bar that only served cocktails and had velvet seating in every corner. He couldn't spot him anywhere. The entire place was crowded with guys, only guys, actually and he could barely tell left from right.
"I thought I was about to see you die to avoid a stranger knowing we tried and failed to get a DNA sample."
Malfoy laughed and shoved his arm. "You didn't have to embarrass her like that. I saw you dancing with those other women, you weren't terrible."
Zabini sighed once, letting out a puff of air. "I'll be presenting your case. I thought that would be fairly obvious, my apologies."
It was catchy, really, and he found himself bobbing his head to the imaginary beat as he cast rhythmically at the room.
Would you help me? I don't know anything about this rot, and I need at least a dozen new products within the month."
A blood malediction was nothing short of a life sentence. It would be for her child too, if it resurfaced there. Harry couldn't imagine what it must have taken for Draco to walk away from a woman he loved because having his child would doom her and the baby both.
"I wasn't in love with her, Potter. There's a difference. I loved her, most pureblood marriages don't even have that. I needed to marry, and I was prepared to."
Harry rolled across the floor to his filing cabinet and pulled open the middle drawer to find a new case file which he dated and Titled Malfoy Murder Mission in clear lines. "You said you had a list of everyone who was there the night your father died?"
"You traitor!" Ginny turned to Harry. "We only let you sit with us because you promised sausage on a stick. We're not letting you corrupt the group."
A little old woman was sitting at the head of the room, and she tapped her gavel just thrice, waiting in silence for everyone to look at her.
How Hot Can You Get Harry? asked the one that changed colour when you put tea inside and had a large picture of his winking face on the front. Tea Time With the Trio, said the one beside it with caricatures of him, Ron, and Hermione sipping from fancy porcelain while a caricature of Voldemort died dramatically in the background. Don't talk to me until I've had my daily dose of Weasley, said another that had a moving drawing Ginny, Bill, and Charlie posing shirtless.
Malfoy exited the shop and Verity and Harry stood staring out the front window at the street until he was long gone from sight.
"Come on in." He lead Harry to the bar where he was busy cleaning up. Everyone was gone and he offered Harry a beer.
Harry said nothing, just stared at his friends in mild horror—wondering if they were going to embarrass him, or if Malfoy was going to embarrass him, or if he was going to embarrass himself, wondering why he cared—until the kettle began to whistle and Ron levitated it away from the stove towards their growing stack of collectables mugs.
And then it hit him, Ron was a healer. Ron had been the first one on-site when the murder was called in.
This meant the only thing left for fixing was his relationship with Malfoy. With Draco, fuck he had to get better at that.
"Alright well, I've got a question. It's related to your work as an," he gestured vaguely, "Auror of sorts."
Hermione let out a slow sigh. In the background, he could hear the news, blasting something or other about the Labor Party, and Hermione's mum humming to herself like she always did when she was doing the ironing. She didn't have much of her memory back yet, but she'd nevertheless grown very close to her new British neighbour who invited her to tea twice weekly.
Hermione held up a hand. "I'm not bothered. At least one of us has to be mature about this whole thing, and it won't be Ron. If it was me there with him, I'd probably do whatever it took to get him to shut up too."
"I'm going to shower and change," Malfoy said. "You and Teddy should meet me in the lobby in a few for dinner."
Harry pushed himself up to a seated position on one of the many tables and kicked his feet as he waited.
Harry arrived at the bar Malfoy worked at and was told he wouldn't be in that night. Apparently, he only needed three nights a week to supplement his ministry salary and Thursdays weren't one. The barman was friendly enough, so Harry stayed for a pint and reviewed his notes.
Harry was torn between telling Teddy to watch his language and asking why he was so sure he even liked Malfoy but instead he asked, "How do you even know about the questionnaire."
"Not really. Just wondered." Harry took a sip of his drink and then remembered why he was there. He pulled a letter out of his pocket.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Ginny looked positively delighted. "Another Bats fan? She's more than welcome to join."
Lorelai was nice and plenty funny. She was pretty too. Her hair was long and black and her red dress looked nice with her dark skin tone. She was taller than Harry in heels, though, and he wasn't sure how he felt about that.
He stormed past Harry back the way they'd come, pointing at empty display cases on the top floor. "Bad for business, tacky, loss of revenue, useless!"
When he looked at Teddy sprawled out across the couch, he was reminded that he was his only family now. Him and Malfoy, who was passed out in a chair across from him.
Malfoy stiffened. "Not... officially. The year I graduated Hogwarts was rather busy and I was predisposed during the next year."
Harry was pretty sure he was blushing to the roots of his hair. "Well, that's not erm... that's not it. I'm not gay." He went back to the machine and studied the pattern of the two signatures he was on.
He looked almost offended. "Right, sure. When I was on an undercover mission to kill the headmaster, that was me being honest."
There was one more thing that Draco had said was a problem and even though Narcissa had said that Draco would be negatively impacted by the knowledge of who killed his father, Harry couldn't stop himself from wanting to know.
Her lips thinned into a tight line, and she huffed out a breath through her nose. "Well, what are you going to do about it? Force them?"
She didn't exactly have the kind of style that he'd want for a house, but a joke shop was right up her street.
Teddy looked at him like he was stupid. "I don't give a hippogriff's arse if you're gay or if you 'like Malfoy'." He raised his hands and made air quotes around that part. "I just don't want you thinking you can pretend for a while and then go back to being happy with whatever witch your questionnaire brings."
"I like to think we've moved beyond that kind of stereotyping nowadays," Alicia said. Everyone sobered up and suddenly Harry was uncomfortable. Hermione broke the tension by nodding wholeheartedly and they shared a smile. At the very least, it seemed they'd become friends.
"He's—" Harry realised that he probably scared her. When he'd called to tell her the news about George, because no one else had the strength to do it, it'd been a bit like this too. "He's fine, Mione. I'm sorry, I know I usually call later, but I was too keyed up.
They glided out of the store and to the nearest apparition point while he still felt a little dazed, and the next thing he knew they were standing beside an old-looking blue car and Malfoy was opening the door to the driver's-side seat.
They sat down and Malfoy offered her a smoke. She declined by saying she'd quit many years ago so that was out. She also apparently didn't drink caffeine which was discovered when she asked if Harry wanted a cup of tea but claimed she wouldn't have any herself.
Now Malfoy just looked terrified. Not like, 6th year terrified or anything, but his face had paled and his eyes darted to Harry's face and back to Ginny once. Actually, Harry was quite sure that if he hadn't spent years studying all of Malfoy's expressions in school when he should have been studying for potions, he would have missed the fear entirely, but it was there.
"Usually when something like this happened, they'd clean it all up by the next day. It was his first time back since... you know... and he spent the entire morning in there alone. Around noon there was this huge boom and we all rushed up the stairs to find him storming out and slamming the door behind him, work-suit completely covered with the stuff."
It was clear that the way to pretend it never happened, in this case, was to find more candidates. While waiting for Ron to go through all of the results, Harry got back to working on the Malfoy Murder Mission.
"I know basically nothing about your life, Malfoy, and I went to school with you for 7 years, give or take a year. Your childhood may be common knowledge but I haven't talked to you more than is polite since the war and you bloody well know it."
"We don't know yet, dear. Eat your breakfast," Hermione said with a pointed look at Ron. Harry figured the kids would have gotten it eventually seeing as they were in the room, but he didn't mention that.
"Sorry, sorry," Malfoy said once he'd composed himself, "Harry doesn't drink, of course. How could we forget? Tell me, how do you two know each other?"
There were a few tense seconds where she just looked back and forth between him and Malfoy, and then she stepped away from the shelves, leading them towards the grand staircase.
Malfoy fixed him with a look and Harry rolled his eyes. "Yeah okay. The Dursley's would a lot as long as we weren't around important people. Oh and Snape, of course."
Ron continued explaining through a mouth of food. "It's not like he even filled out the bloody form, I just convinced him to give it a shot."
He sat down next to Teddy and brushed a strand of black hair out of his face. He'd have a crick in his neck tomorrow. Harry grabbed a pillow from his room and tucked it under his head.
Harry let the charged moment go, trying to pretend he'd imagined it. But you didn't, a voice reminded him. Yeah, thanks a lot, voice. You've got a lot of nerve correcting me when you're the one that got us into trouble.
They were sitting facing muggle London and with the trees that used to block the way gone, the lights below twinkled like fairies. Harry pulled his jacket tighter around him.
He tested Finnley Shaw's first, thinking it highly likely. It came back negative. No need to panic, this wasn't implicating his best friend just yet.
Harry told him it was too bad he hadn't been able to use his stellar social skills on the jerks from the restaurant.
Malfoy sighed, but there was an amused light dancing in his eyes. "Astoria, I assume you recognise Harry Potter. That one there's Lee Jordan, and those two are Weasley's. Ginevra," he pointed, "and Ronald."
"Put that out, Darling." He blew his smoke behind him and frowned at Narcissa. Harry waved goodbye as he left. Draco did not wave back. That was okay, there was still more left to his plan.
Malfoy had given him his phone number and told him to call. Harry hadn't been thinking logically about this. He'd just remembered the look on Malfoy's face when he'd talked about his dad and felt the urge to do something about it. What was he gonna do, anyway? How would he get the file? Was what he was doing illegal? It had to be. But he was only solving a crime, what was wrong with that? It was his job to solve crimes. Crimes he was assigned, not ones he picked up off the street.
A man with brown hair ran into the hallway and threw his arms around Harry. It took him a few seconds to realise the man was Malfoy and by that time he'd already let go to jump around giddily.
Harry went to Hermione for advice on his date with Alicia now that he and Ron were fighting-not-fighting. Hermione and Ron would be there since they were both still considered major celebrities and Hermione wanted a night off from the kids.
When Harry was walking down the hall of the Janus Thickey Ward at 2 later that day, he couldn't help feeling guilty. It seemed like taking advantage of Neville's parents somehow, to steal their DNA without them noticing, but he didn't see another choice.
Harry threw the magazine back at her and pointed to the fluff. "I meant that. What the hell is that?"
Harry had to come up with something. He had to save it. His mind kept going to the last time he'd seen Mrs Weasley, a little less than a week before.
"Ah." Draco came down then with freshly dried hair and they stopped talking. Teddy told them they were going to Osteria Morini for Italian food and that was it.
Harry couldn't let this get taken from them too. It felt like there was too much happening all at once.
He knocked on Draco's door and there was a long pause before he answered. He was fully dressed but his hair was wet and he was drying it with a towel.
Which was a great point. In fact, Harry had been so distracted with all of the business with the shop that he couldn't recall if he'd seen much of Ron the past couple of days. It was morning anyway, so he'd best wake him.
Harry didn't know. Maybe he'd grown up. In any case, they didn't go back to the restaurant and the bill remained unpaid. Maybe he'd mail them a cheque. He probably wouldn't.
Alicia seemed confused but she smiled and squeezed his arm fondly. "We're both interested in dancing."
"Well, I can't really help with the first bit," she said, "but maybe you could visit the office. You know they were always drafting ideas up there. I bet there are some you could still use. But pay the mortgage first, and then get the hack in there so they can see how proactive you're being."
"It was Fred and George's shop..." Harry tried, having the strangest feeling that if he made one wrong move everything around him would explode.
"If you wouldn't mind, I need to use the restroom," Harry said, planning on excusing himself so he could distract Patricia with a firecall in order for Malfoy to make an escape.
"In polite society, you can't simply excuse yourself from conversation for the duration of a visit. At most, you can potentially manage a trip to the loo."
Malfoy scoffed and looked at Teddy for support but he just shrugged. Harry wasn't going to give up that easily.
Mrs. Fawley smiled at them both and patted Malfoy on the hand. "I have to go, but owl me if I can ever be of any assistance."
The rest of the night was enough to distract him. All of his friends came up to laugh with him about his dance with Malfoy and the press squeezed in at every opportunity to try to take pictures. At some point, Jerome left, though Harry didn't pay much attention. Ron had grabbed a new bottle of wine from the bar and they all took turns passing it around and taking swigs, even though Hermione considered it poor manners. He and Malfoy danced again and then every witch there pulled him in for some poorly executed but overall not-terrible dances.
"Nothing, you just sounded so—" Harry waved a hand around vaguely— "so muggle. Like the Americans on the telly."
"I do think the daisies would be interesting," Dean said, staring up at the ceiling. His head on Seamus's lap. "Like tiny companions you could put on your window sill."
"Er.. jeans and a t-shirt?" It was comfortable. So what if the t-shirt had a hole in the armpit and the jeans were caked in mud?
"You're the inspector?" Harry asked. It seemed like a very fitting job. If there was one thing people would remember about Zabini, it was how much he loved judging people.
"No. I don't want to bet over who killed your father, let's just test the samples and then we'll know."
"No, I just mean... if you think they're going to scream at you to get out or something, they're not. They aren't like that. Maybe they used to be, but anger just doesn't seem to hold with them anymore. Not since George."
"Hmm? Oh, it's an article describing 20 Surefire Ways to Woo Harry Potter. Beats me why they'd need the extra 19 if even one was actually going to work but—"
Casting the spells Luna'd taught him to check for animal welfare, Harry felt relieved at the bold blue wisps of light that rose out of his head.
"Well, it was nice to meet you, Harry. Owl me some time if you like." She handed him a card that had a mobile number, a floo address, an email address, and her name, descriptors, and occupation on it. She must have been experienced.
It was purposeful, then. At least, a bit. The point hadn't been to turn an entire room into an unnavigable nightmare, but they had wanted orange stuff. In some form or fashion. Which was still very unclear.
When Harry woke up the morning after Hermione begged him to cover her speech, Harry would have rather done anything than get up. He sat there till he was almost late for work before rolling out of bed and throwing on his Auror Uniform.
Harry could feel himself wanting to say yes, wanting to know what would happen if he went inside with Malfoy, if he let himself taste his lips, if he let himself sink his hands into that ridiculous blond hair and kiss him till he was gasping.
Harry went to his own bed and collapsed back into it. If it was that obvious to a 15 year old what Harry was thinking, what about everyone else?
"It just hurt so much, to see them caring about me when people I loved and that other people loved had died."
It had taken therapy, long conversations with Draco, lots of convincing with McGonagall, and finding a support structure with his friends, but he was getting better every day.
"I still need to know why you're helping me. Is this just a continuation of your whole Golden Boy persona, or something else?"
It was drawn on a Magi-board—another one of their inventions which allowed two people to write on separate boards while seeing what the other person was doodling—with lots of little labels and, of course, the bloody awful orange stuff.
Malfoy glared and Harry threw his hands up in surrender. It was a joke! Maybe he was being insensitive. The man was dead, after all.
"Potter, any woman, or man for that matter, who would apply to date you is out of their bloody mind and doesn't see themselves as anything more than a future Mrs. Potter. I'm frankly insulted you think I'd lower myself to that kind of thing."
In the end, she gave him a few spells to try, and he showed up at Wheezes very early the next morning to cast his first modified vanishing charm.
First, he needed to officially hire on his friends for their respective jobs. He didn't want to be exploiting them for free labour when he didn't have to. He also made a note to give Verity a pay bump and hire at least one more clerk for somewhere in the store. If everything worked as planned, she would need the help.
She laughed and blushed and put a hand on his arm. Women tended to do this when he was out in public and he'd gotten used to it. Sometimes it lead to a nice conversation, usually it lead to a broken-hearted witch releasing a Tell-All in The Prophet.
"We only have a minute. Go on, tell me about yourself." She leaned her head on her hand and waited. She seemed nice enough and she was quite pretty with long blonde hair and brown eyes, so he did as she asked.
As for the first part, Harry now knew he was gay. He'd said it out loud to himself for the first time the night before, just to see how it felt. It was terrifying, but terrifyingly right. He'd never felt like this about anyone before and he didn't figure he ever would again.
Malfoy sucked in his cheeks, letting out a slow breath as he turned onto a more residential street—if you could call it that, considering how large the houses were. Trees were lining the space between mansions and a dog was barking somewhere, just barely loud enough to hear. Everything was that soft kind of darkness that came in slowly after sunset, when the air still had a hint of life and the humidity was only just beginning to wear off.
Teddy and Malfoy shared an exaggerated look and Malfoy threw an arm around Teddy's shoulders. "So tell me, where are we eating breakfast in this fine city of carts?"
The pub Astoria had chosen was loud when they arrived. Not just normal levels of loud, either, but the kind that made you want to find a secluded corner somewhere way off so that you could finally breathe a little bit.
He nodded and stood up just as Harry was about to get a sample into the machine. Malfoy crumpled up a napkin in his hand and threw it into the empty takeaway container.
They stood in horribly polite silence for only a moment before Harry decided he couldn't stand it and asked Verity if she would show them to Fred and George's office.
After a few confused seconds, Ron cottoned on and burst out laughing. Harry flipped him the two fingers.
Feelings were going to ruin Harry's life. In addition to missing working on the Malfoy Murder Mission instead of The Problem, he now spent every free second of his time stressing about his first date with Alicia and having to dance in public.
Less than a day after Harry left Ron in possession of the Potter Problem questionnaires, there was a knock on his office door.
Malfoy was sitting several stands above them, but he'd looked up when Ginny called, and he waved curiously at her. So much for not thinking about the shop.
He agreed to go to a function he'd been putting off RSVPing to for months now, the Auror's Annual March Ball, and invited Alicia to go with him. Now he had a date and he just had to learn to dance. In 10 days.
Harry set the tea tray carefully on the coffee table, hesitating before he finally chose to sit on the couch with Malfoy. There was an armchair nearby, but it would've made it hard to reach the tea. And it's not like he was sitting next to Malfoy, Harry reasoned. They were on opposite ends, Harry pulling up his knees underneath him so that they would be facing each other. At first, he felt a bit like a child with his legs crossed in such a way, but then Malfoy looked at him and it was forgotten.
Harry scoffed. It'd be fine, would it? God, he could just imagine the reactions now. "Fine for who, the Prophet? My leagues of adoring fans? You and Hermione might be fine with it but no one else would be."
Harry wasn't sure what had happened to them after the war. He knew Lucius had been put on trial for his crimes, but he hadn't paid any attention to the outcome. He felt almost guilty for it, now, because he wasn't sure how lightly to tread.
On that Thursday after work, they traveled to a muggle restaurant a short apparition away from Mrs. Fawley's apothecary. Malfoy spoke passionately about what he wanted to study and the branches of potions he wanted to specialise in. He used words like "cordial" and "decant" in ways that made no sense to Harry but caused Mrs. Fawley to nod and smile.
Malfoy blinked a couple of times, shifting in his seat. "Just, well, if your Weasley's weren't okay with my being here, I mean."
When he thought it over the next day, he knew he'd said it wrong. But future him wasn't in a cab at 3 a.m., drunk off his arse with the most beautiful man in the world, and wanting so badly to pretend he wasn't feeling what he was feeling. He wanted to be friends with Malfoy, he didn't want to ruin this delicate balance they had found. He didn't want anyone to think the thoughts in his head were anything more than short-lived fantasies and he didn't want to hurt Malfoy.
Harry gritted his teeth, annoyed at the expression on Malfoy's face which clearly indicated that he thought Harry was lacking in all forms of intelligence.
Harry scooted a bit closer. "Isn't it?" He wanted it to be—Merlin but he wanted. And why, so that he and Malfoy were on even ground? What would that give him, with all the history still filling the space between them?
Harry could see Malfoy better now. He was wearing a gray waistcoat/jacket set-thingy and matching trousers — muggle clothes, Harry was surprised to see. He had a silver wristwatch on one arm and his hair was gelled back, though not as severely as during their Hogwarts days. He'd heard Hermione and Ginny call men jaw-dropping before but he'd never actually felt his jaw drop when looking at one. He wasn't sure if it was the clothes or the hair, or if it was just the combined effect of seeing them on Malfoy of all people, but jaw-dropping was the perfect word for it.
Fortunately, he was used to dealing with public embarrassment and he just flipped her two fingers. Unconventional, but it played out in his favour.
"Wicked," the younger one said. Harry smiled at the boy. He reminded him a bit of Fred, without the fiery-orange hair.
"They were Sirius's from back at Hogwarts. Remus figured out how to get a CD player to work and my mum bought him some each year for his birthday."
Before Harry had moved in, you couldn't see much from the grounds of Grimmauld place. After the war, he had started to feel stifled in the old house and had insisted to Ron and Hermione that fixing up the back garden would help. It had, in a way. He should get Neville over here to check on the plants again soon. The song faded out and another one started up he didn't recognise as well.
"Before Voldemort," everyone winced, "orphans weren't talked about. If you were a magical orphan, that meant your parents didn't want you, and what parents would throw away magical blood?" He paused here and looked over his notes once more. They were mostly about the symptoms and treatments for depression and how to be proactive, not about the emotional impact which was Harry's only specialty when giving speeches.
He and Malfoy walked back to the kitchen and Malfoy started a pot of coffee. Harry took the time to turn back to the letter.
Malfoy's chest was heaving, but he composed himself quickly, taking his wand out of his sleeve to clean up the tea he'd spilt on the rug, setting everything to rights and then folding his hands in his lap, looking away from Harry at the wall of photos like he was interested in what he saw.
"Fine. See you at eight. At Close Maggiore." He kept shaking his head as he walked out and when the door finally shut behind him, Harry immediately fire-called Ron.
"For the charm," he said slowly, like Harry was a child. "The one you're using to clear the room. What's the incantation?"
On the walk home in this small section of the universe, Draco Malfoy took Harry Potter's hand in his and Harry felt himself stop breathing. He held it all the way to the hotel, and Teddy didn't say a thing.
Ginny laughed delightedly at that, leaning across Harry to clap him on the shoulder. Malfoy flinched, looking startled but not displeased.
Malfoy smirked at the face he must have been making. "What? We're outside. Don't tell me Potter's become a rule-follower since Hogwarts. Sure you don't want one? Granger's not around."
"Pansy thought it'd be good fun. Being the kind of thing our parents would frown upon made it all the more appealing, I suppose. Blaise and... and Crabbe had managed to find some beat-up old thing in the forbidden forest that we could drive. No idea how it ended up there, mind you, but we all tried it out. I took a liking to it more than the others."
Ron put his hands up in surrender. "I hear ya mate. It'd be fine if you were, though. You know that, right?
When he got to them, he stood regally by the railing for the pitch, his face not betraying anything he was thinking.
The table seated twelve and they sat down in two of the four empty seats left. It was hard to be heard over the music, but Alicia's hand on his arm was a comforting presence. Ron sat across the table from him and gave him a brief smile as he poured Hermione some wine. Neville sat next to them along with Luna who was chatting to the most attractive person Harry had ever seen. Unlike Alicia's more complex dress, this person was wearing plain robes in a deep purple. It took Harry a minute to realise the person in the robes was Malfoy.
"A Patronus," Harry told them, "is the warmth of the fire after you've been out in the cold. It's your best friend smiling at you from across the great hall. It's the feeling of flying and the stars dancing in the sky above you."
Harry realised she was asking him, and he leaned forward, head spinning from how fast this all seemed. "Yes, Your Worship."
"Can't believe you're asking. Just test the bloody samples. I won't do anything to harm whoever it is, I'll just expose them so they can't hurt anyone else."
Two days later, Malfoy was knocking at the door to Grimmauld Place. It was past 9 and Harry'd been working out to ease his mind before bed. He opened the door to let Malfoy in.
"You're both ridiculous. The game starts at 8, so you'd better be ready to watch your hopes and dreams die before we leave at 7."
Malfoy took a shaky breath and Harry grabbed his hand to steady him. He squeezed back and Harry felt his heart jump out of his chest. Teddy gave him the side eye and Harry kicked him under the table in response. So what if he was holding Malfoy's hand? It didn't mean anything.
Mr. Shaw took him down the stairs to the basement. Harry was pretty sure he could fix a tap after doing it for the Dursley's a few times, but he was still nervous. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, the lights went out. Was it a power failure?
"This world has too many laws, too many rules. What happened to the basics? Don't kill anyone and don't steal."
"Well that's... that's," he was going to say unfortunate, but he settled on, "Thank you. I didn't mean to—"
Harry pretended to think it over. "Good angry face, nice restaurant, waiting audience, oh and of course anyone who likes the Wimbourne Wasps."
For no real reason, Harry was utterly compelled to make this idea work. It felt like the most important thing in the world. Maybe that was because Hermione was right and he just needed something to do, or maybe he was simply determined.
"Alicia. You've dressed up. Usually, when there are photos of you scattered about they're.. well." She smiled again.
"Don't. Even think about it. You're a liar and you embarrassed me in front of hundreds of people." She stormed off and Harry let his head fall to the table. He'd blown it.
He met Malfoy outside a block from the restaurant and found he had already hailed a cab. He pulled Harry inside and told the driver to go towards the center of London. Harry knew they were headed to the ministry.
"I'm a pureblood, Potter. Practically the entire wizarding world is my third cousin. Hell, you're probably my third cousin."
"Because I know you, Harry Potter. You aren't going to be alone forever, you're too bloody awesome for that. Besides, if you don't find your soulmate, there's almost no hope for the rest of us."
He stopped on his tracks, unsure of what to do and not knowing who it was and what they were doing there. Then, he threw caution at the wind and slowly walked up to the window. He tried not to make any noise as he walked or with his breathing, the quiet corridor making it easier to spot any out of place noise.
It had been hard to convince Ron and Hermione to let him leave the tower at a time when people were awake and moving around the castle. He had almost given up on it, Hermione had been adamant about having him stay in the common room at all costs and Ron had looked at him with such a concerned gaze that it had almost pinned Harry to the sofa.
Harry grinned and leaned back on his chair. After, a month of staying in the tower and not being able to touch anyone, he was more than ready to go back to normal, go back outside and go back to hugging his friends and being playful with his mates without fearing all the bruises that would come with any touch.
"Thank you," he stared directly into Malfoy's eyes, hoping to convey everything he was feeling into that one stare. "It means a lot to me that you care."
It had been quite scary. The bruises hadn't seemed worse than some of the problems Harry had had growing up at Hogwarts, so to see her like that, it had made his nerves skyrocket.
A love curse. Someone had cast it on him at an unknown time, their best guess had been at the last Hogsmeade trip since they doubted any of the students would be this competent at the dark arts. According to McGonagall, it was an old curse that hadn't been used for centuries, but still famous for how terrible it was.
Ron and Hermione had gone on a date. Well, they hadn't wanted to call it a date to Harry's face since Hermione seemed convinced that going on a date when they could be helping with research was quite selfish. Harry was just glad that Ron had managed to convince her that they would be able to help much more if they took some time to unwind and that going to Hogsmeade was a great way to unwind. It's not like one afternoon would lower their chances of finding anything to help Harry by much if anything.
"It happens when someone touches me," he rushed out to justify. "The curse… it basically makes bruises appear when anyone who isn't my true love touches me. True Love Touch was what they called it."
Malfoy's gaze was curious, likely wanting to ask what was going on with him again. He didn't ask though, he nodded in surprising understanding and let Harry have his silence.
Still, it would have been nice to be bored and spend some time with his friends without being cursed and consequentially being locked up in a tower as if he were a damsel in distress.
And of course, Harry wouldn't call them friends either, he just meant that they were being more friendly toward each other than they had ever been before.
They stayed in silence for a while, Malfoy sipping his coffee and Harry reaching out to grab a few snacks from the middle of the table, mindful of his bruises.
Harry walked up to Malfoy, casting a shadow over him and making him open his eyes with an annoyed expression.
When Madam Pomfrey had finally come back to the room, she was accompanied by McGonagall, Slughorn and Flitwick. Seeing the band that had arrived at the room had not done anything to calm Harry's mind.
Harry's shoulders dropped and his fingers left the wand, body moving into a more comfortable position. He stayed in silence, Malfoy could have heard something but not know that anyone was there. He could go back to what he had been doing before Harry appeared and Harry would let him be, he would turn around and go back the same path he had come through.
Malfoy looked positively paler than he had always been. Eyebrows pinched together and lips parted in surprise. He reached a hand as if to touch and Harry flinched so violently that it startled the two of them.
Draco seemed thorn between worrying that he had hurt Harry and wanting to go back to what they had been doing before. Harry hoped that he chose the second option.
Ron was next to her, head resting on an open book and some drool starting to pool at the corner of his mouth. He didn't look like he would be waking up anytime soon.
He sat down carefully in front of Malfoy, on the other side of the window, their feet almost touching in the middle. He dropped his cloak next to him and turned to look out the window. He couldn't see anything beyond a few trees that looked darker and more menacing than they did in daylight. The window was a little broken at the bottom, a sliver of cold air getting inside through it and falling upon Harry's neck.
He blew on his cup to cool down whatever it was that he was drinking and took a sip, a small brown drop catching on his top lip.
"I do think I want to talk," Malfoy said, his eyes meeting Harry's. "But my first reflex will always be to keep things inside."
Malfoy retreated his hand, that had been hanging in the air until now, and cradled it to his chest as if he had been the one about to be bruised.
Harry blinked, startled at the candid admission. He hadn't expected Malfoy to be so truthful with him, to open up in that way and say something that was private and personal. Malfoy opening up to Harry seemed like an impossibility, implausible. But here they were, in a dark corridor, in the middle of the night and Malfoy was telling Harry that he was scared.
"Asshole," Harry rolled his eyes amused. "I meant the two of us, here in the middle of the night, talking as if we're friends."
The three of them stared at him curiously and Harry knew that now it wasn't just because he was Harry Potter who had defeated Voldemort, now it was also because he had been skipping class and not going down to the Great Hall in over a week.
When the bruises got worse, so bad that they were more visible than the actual skin on his arms, Hermione had put her feet down and hadn't let him go to class. And if Hermione hadn't let him go to class, it had to be a really bloody terrible situation. She had come back at the end of the day, McGonagall and Pomfrey in tow and the three of them had deemed that he was to stay at Gryffindor Tower until further notice.
Dumbledore's death still haunted him too much to be able to sit at that tower again without seeing him fall down the railing. He couldn't sit there and not see the flash of green that had come out of Snape's wand. The tower was filled with memories he didn't want to relive and he wouldn't torture himself with them.
"Why, mate? Why?" He poked Harry's shoulder and turned to his book, neither of them remembering the curse for a second.
They sat stiffly and made small talk over tea, though Daphne didn't have any, leaving them without DNA. When Harry started thinking there was no good solution, Malfoy surprised him by asking Daphne, "Can I see her?"
He heard Ginny sink to the floor in defeat, and then Ron's voice, muffled through the walls, asking, "You really put your mouth on his—" Harry could imagine the accompanying facial expressions and gestures to get his point across.
"Sounds like you've been seeing Malfoy. Hate to say I told you so but I was the one that set you up."
The pizza was better than Harry'd had in a long time. He'd have to remember the name of the restaurant later. Baba— something or other.
Suddenly, he grew more serious, thinking about the possible repercussions of all this. "What am I gonna do, Verity? What if he says the shop has to close?"
Ron shrugged and then got a beep on his pager, some of the very little technology St. Mungo's had gotten around to implementing since the war.
"He's not a product, Harry, he's a pet. But yes." She shrugged, the rainbow puffball rising and falling with her shoulders. "It's just a modified Crinus Muto. Fred and George taught me when they were still struggling to breed them fast enough for the demand."
"After lunch today I cracked open the old case files. They didn't even check out the scene when your dad died!"
They talked briefly about their respective interests, but when Harry made jokes at his own expense she didn't take it well. So she wasn't one for teasing on a first date, that was no problem.
"That's what that one woman said when she discussed why the Ministry had chosen you. The least biased, actually, was her wording. Considering our history..."
Harry walked around it slowly, taking in the simple frame feeling like a fool as he pulled on the door handle gently and bent down inside. The silence was stifling as he closed himself in, but then Malfoy the key in the ignition and they were sailing smoothly down dirt roads.
There were over 100 guests invited to the event, not including plus ones, and 24 of the people on Malfoy's list had RSVP'd yes. It wasn't perfect but it was the easiest solution for batch processing.
"Professor- headmistress, you know I'm an Auror, right? I love Hogwarts, but I've never thought twice about teaching there."
Malfoy's gaze held weight, steely grey eyes reflecting the shifting colours of the light around the room, making them look purple, then blue, then red. "Lots has changed since school."
Harry rushed to them and pulled Teddy into a hug. He was nearly 15, but he let Harry hold onto him without protest for once.
He high-tailed it to the kitchens where Malfoy was busy making the drinks waiters were taking around on trays.
"I don't need to see them to know that they are horrible. Gryffindors aren't known for their impeccable taste." Malfoy turned his head to give him a pointed look.
"It does happen sometimes." Harry smiled and his other hand came up to touch Draco's face, unafraid now. "You're just thinking too much."
"I do tend to do that," Draco nodded, but his eyes were back on Harry's lips Harry knew that they both agreed that conversation was overrated.
"I did the only thing I could do," Malfoy ignored him. "I wrote to my mother, hoping that she had some answers. She comes from an old family, maybe she knew something and, if she didn't, I asked for any books that she thought might help."
Harry bent down slightly, holding the cloak close to him as not to let it touch Malfoy in any way, and put his face close to Malfoy's ear. Malfoy's eyebrows furrowed and, before he could turn to look, Harry intervened.
One normal year had been all he had asked for but he couldn't even get that, the universe seemed set in testing him in every way, shape and form, each one more ridiculous than the other.
Harry walked down the stairs of the castle, the cold touching his skin through the clothes. His fingers were freezing where they were holding the Marauders' map in front of him, his eyes following the line to the name
"Scared of what?" Harry's voice was soft, softer than he had ever used when talking to Malfoy, softer than he had ever thought he would use with Malfoy.
Harry felt warm. Every word that Malfoy said was going directly into his heart and exploding into tiny flames, setting him on fire from the inside out. He turned so he was looking directly at Malfoy and smiled at him.
"Indeed. We grew up, we learned that school rivalries are nothing when there are things that are so much bigger and dangerous. And after being involved in those things, school rivalries sound quite silly."
She reached out, hand outstretched to pat his, and the two of them froze. Her hand stopped midair and he retreated his own slowly from the table, placing it on his lap.
Malfoy's hands had been on his lap the whole time, he had kept them there as he kissed Harry back. But now he raised them, he clutched at harry's robes with them at first, bringing him closer and closer until there was practically no space between them. When he moved again, he held the back of Harry's neck with his right hand and kissed him even harder.
He had tried to stray away from any touches at first. Avoiding people at all costs and ducking out of arms and hands' reach. But it turns out that it is quite hard to avert all and every little touch.
"Yes. I have found a potion in my researches that is known to break curses much like the one you've been carrying."
"You're completely out of your mind," Malfoy shook his head, but there was laughter in his eyes and Harry knew he wouldn't be pushed away.
It was called the 'True Love Touch', a rubbish name if anyone asked Harry for his input. Also, a stupid thing to be cursed with. Why would anyone want to curse him with something like that?
Malfoy licked his lips and nodded once to himself before starting, "The truth is that I was very curious at first. You had disappeared from the castle and no one seemed to know exactly why, and then I saw you that first night and I was even more curious. Because why would you be hiding away during the day and leaving all your adoring fans heartbroken but then come out in the middle of the night."
"Don't beat yourself up over it," Harry shook his head, shifting so he was sitting closer to Malfoy. "No one knew how to help me. It was just a shit situation."
"And then I found out what was wrong with you. One of the things that's wrong with you, anyway," he smiled teasingly. "And I guess, I don't know. I was just worried. And I did want to help you but I didn't know how and that pained me."
The next time he saw Malfoy was actually in daylight, for once. It was Saturday afternoon and the sun was bright despite the cold outside. Most people were either outside enjoying the cool sunshine or at Hogsmeade. Because of that, Harry had deemed it safe enough to leave the tower for once and go to the library, figuring that no one would try to touch him there.
McGonagall had summoned a chair and had sat in front of Harry. Her eyes were deep-set and worried and Harry just wished someone, anyone, would tell him what was going on.
Malfoy rolled his eyes at him, but he didn't seem to mind the conversation and the remarks. He seemed to be having fun with it if the small upward curve of his lips was anything to go by.
"Maybe we should get some sleep," Harry said, thumbing over the words 'old curse' on the book he had been trying to pay attention to.
Harry wasn't sure if it was because of the month he had spent without touching anyone or if it was just because this was Draco, but every touch seemed bigger than it was, fuller and deeper. Every touch seemed to stroke his heart and make his breath hitch.
Harry snorted, amused at Malfoy's words and bored tone. He should have known that if there was anyone who would recognize the seemingly empty space as Harry it would be Malfoy. And there was no one who would make less of a fuss about seeing the Harry Potter than Malfoy.
"That's great!" Harry said, eager to be able to go out whenever he felt like it and go back to eating in the Great Hall and all the normal things he had had to stop doing.
The silence that followed wasn't as harsh as the others had been. This one felt lighter, felt like it was there simply because they didn't know each other enough to break it and not because they weren't supposed to be talking to each other. This was the kind of silence Harry didn't mind having with Malfoy.
"Yes, I do know." He sipped his coffee again, making Harry wait for an answer. "I think we both grew up, wouldn't you say."
He wasn't mad and that was a relief for Harry who found himself enjoying his conversations with Malfoy more and more.
Malfoy frowned and Harry took a moment to think that maybe that hadn't been the best way to start the conversation. Malfoy was doing something nice for him and Harry was telling him that he wouldn't need it.
Harry didn't want to scare him away. He didn't want Draco to see the bruise and decide that he wouldn't touch Harry again until the curse was removed. He didn't want that. He had been telling the truth when he had said that getting a few bruises would be worth it if he got to touch Draco and be touched by him.
Malfoy stared at him with a contemplative expression. Eyes fixed on Harry as he grabbed a napkin and dabbed at his mouth.
He walked aimlessly for a while, secure that no one would see him, through the corridors and the moving stairs. It was a fun game to play, not knowing where he would end up and just peering over corners and through windows. It was like discovering Hogwarts again, as he had done when he had been only 11 and everything had been new and exciting.
Malfoy looked up at him, eyes narrowing as he took on Harry's face and tried to read him. Harry was sure that it wouldn't be too hard, he was terrible at concealing how he felt, after all.
"I think it's your turn to tell me what you're doing in a dark corridor in the middle of the night, Potter."
Harry stared at the black and blue bruises all over his arms. He didn't need to see the ones on his back to know where they were. They hurt as he turned on his bed, the fabric brushing against them making little prickles of pain run up and down his body.
And he thought he had been successful in his attempt, but then a head shot up and a pair of eyes stared straight at the place where he was standing. His fingers reached for his wand as a reflex and he took a careful defence stance beneath the cloak. Then, he took notice of the barely visible almost white hair and relaxed.
Harry met his eyes and smiled at him before finally, finally, letting his finger touch skin. His placed the pad of his index on the skin where Malfoy's shoulder met his neck and felt his breath get stuck in his throat. It had been so long since he had freely touched anyone, he felt like his brain was going to snap if he didn't continue feeling skin on his.
Then he gave up. With a groan, he got up from the bed and carefully walked to the foot of his bed where he kept his trunk. He took a warm jumper, one that covered his arms and his shoulders enough not to have to stare at the bruises on them. Then, he grabbed his invisibility cloak and walked out of the room, listening closely to his sleeping classmates to make sure that none of them was stirring awake with the noise.
He closed the book and put it down on the table. Harry thought he was going to leave and not say anything about it anymore. He didn't know if he wanted that to happen or not. On the one hand, it would mean that he wouldn't feel the pressure of Malfoy's eyes anymore and would be able to relax again and go back to pretending like he was reading anything. But then he knew that if he was ever alone with Malfoy again, he would still want to tell him about all of it.
"Harry," Draco breathed out, his hand reaching out but not quite touching Harry's neck. "There's nothing."
"It wouldn't be bad." He still wouldn't meet Harry's eyes. "But it doesn't seem like it could be true."
"I still need to run it through Professor Slughorn and then we have to wait until the potion is complete, but we have something," McGonagall reassured him.
Malfoy's books fell to the table with a dull sound and Harry buried his face in his crossed arms when he grabbed one of the books Harry had been reading. He didn't lift his head to see Malfoy's expression as he read the title or as he thumbed through the pages.
Another set of stairs later and Harry sighed as he looked up at the Astronomy Tower. He could climb those last stairs and sit up there, look at the ground from there and stare at the sky. It had always been a beautiful place to go to unwind, but Harry couldn't seem to be able to move his feet as much as he wanted to.
Harry still had his book in front of him, he pretended to scan the pages and take notes while he waited for the common room to empty. When there were only three fifth-years standing there, he closed the book and discarded the parchment full of the useless doodles he had made to pass time and went upstairs.
Frowning, Harry turned back to look at Malfoy. He was still sitting in the same place where he had been before, except this time, his eyes were on Harry and not on the outside. In his hands was Harry's invisibility cloak.
"Potter, don't even attempt to make a fool out of the two of us. I know you're there and you know that I am aware of that, so let's skip that whole thing."
His mind had been right to be worried. The news they had gotten hadn't been great, they had been quite terrible, really. The professors had asked question after question, questions that Harry hadn't been able to properly answer. He hadn't known exactly when the bruises had started to appear since he hadn't paid them any mind at the beginning. He hadn't known how long any of it had been going on, he hadn't even known it had been going on.
And Malfoy was right. Hiding was easier and safer, but that didn't mean it was the best option. It didn't mean there wasn't something amazing about opening up to someone and letting them know what's inside of you. Harry had some trouble doing it too, but something about this Malfoy that was sitting next to him and that had been talking to him for weeks, made him want to hear everything he had to say and open up in return.
Malfoy licked his lips and averted his eyes for a second, before turning them back to Harry, a determined flicker in them.
He shifted a little, momentarily forgetting about his bruises and wincing as he leaned against the wall. He tried to conceal it, but Malfoy seemed to have noticed, a raised eyebrow aimed at him.
"I've been staying confined to the tower. It's easier to avoid any contact, accidental or not, with people that way."
Malfoy raised an unimpressed eyebrow and looked down at the books Harry had displayed in front of him. That was when Harry realized his mistake. None of the books was about things that were in the curriculum.
Harry looked at him confused. Then stared down at his hands, at his fingers and palms that had touched Malfoy's skin and that should be black and blue but that weren't.
They arranged to meet for lunch which would enable them to swab her cup or utensils for saliva. Harry asked how likely it was that Malfoy would be able to convince a professional potioneer that he was qualified for an apprenticeship and Malfoy only scowled at him. The bigger problem though, was that neither one of them wanted to have to split up and they had to make up a lie about why Harry was with him.
"And then what? We'd dance together like fourth years at the Yule Ball? If it makes any difference, we already discussed the possibility of one of us being romantically interested in the other and neither one of us is. It's simple."
"Well it was a misunderstanding at first and I thought it'd be funny to watch you put your foot in your mouth a bit. Then, Hermione kept saying how much fun you two were having. I thought maybe there was something you weren't telling us about why it was so hard for you to find a wife."
Malfoy took one look at Harry's face and waved him through. Harry dusted the ash off his clothes and took the drink Malfoy handed him wordlessly.
Hours stacked up till it was well past noon, then evening, then heading towards darkness. Lee was narrating over the official announcer, and it was almost more fun to watch Ginny and Malfoy pretend they didn't want to laugh than listen to what he said.
They all turned around in their seats at the voice, and Lee Jordan laughed delightedly, bounding down the stands towards them.
He snatched it out of her hands, scanning the page with a frown. "This Says 5 Must-Try Glamours to Spice Up Your Sex Life."
"That's for you to decide, isn't it? You know, Neville has some lovely little daisies he's been growing. They talk to you and everything. I think Flaming Left Nipple Twister would fit perfectly. You could market them to anybody!"
"Hey, little guy," he whispered, running a hand over its abdomen and feeling for anything concerning. "You're gonna be a bit hit, you know? Famous, even."
Ron and Ginny took up residence at Grimmauld Place, huddling together when it all got to be too much. The burrow was a mess, they'd said, and Harry hadn't thought twice about offering. With both twins gone, Mrs Weasley was torn to shreds, barely holding it together. As much as Ron and Ginny needed to be away from that, though, he knew they were really there because they worried about him too.
"Come on, you won't even stay for a bit?" Neville turned imploring eyes on her. "We could pop in a film. Or do something fun. A cake! We could bake a cake."
Harry got up slowly, brushing off his hands on his jeans and sighing. It looked like it would take forever to get the office clean, but he started up with his casting again.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "He has it out for me. Perhaps for you, too. Or maybe he just likes to see people suffer, there's really no way to be certain."
"If you want to save this shop—and I do not doubt that somewhere in your... heart..." he said that like he's originally intended on a few other choice words, "you really think that's the best plan—then you'd do well to listen to my advice. I've saved twenty-five businesses this year and shut down another thirty. I know what I'm talking about. Clean up the orange gunk, open the doors on time, and for Merlin's sake, get some new products in here. Anything you have left now," he gestured to the shelves full of dented boxes of Everlasting Eyelashes and Nose Biting Teacups.
Malfoy claimed to be annoyed by Harry having purchased the Portkey for them and Harry told him he could pay him back by helping Ron go through questionnaires for The Problem.
Hermione had prepared notes for him which came in handy considering he hadn't thought to prepare and knew very little about the medical aspect of the topic. Since Hermione was a mind Healer — she'd gotten interested in it after helping to restore her parents' memories after the war — she knew what she was talking about.
He laughed, taking a long sip and clearing his throat. "What gives you the idea that Goyle's a great conversationalist?"
"It says you were spotted together in 'varying states of disarray' standing in the middle of Dia— Hermione."
Malfoy twisted his lips. He was over-thinking this. He coughed and Malfoy rolled his eyes but brought him a beer too and Harry grinned. This was way more fun than at the Leaky.
The woman in front of him was a Gemini from Wales who loved shopping, reading, and dancing — in that order. Harry had already decided these things meant she probably wasn't his soul mate, but that wasn't going to stop him from talking to her.
Draco had given him 3 things to work on. Well, not so much given as yelled them at him. It still counted.
When they made it back to the hotel and Teddy went inside to take a shower, Malfoy asked him how he thought everything was.
She paused, revelling in their rapt attention. Even Malfoy seemed intrigued. "I want you to streak through the Quidditch pitch." At his wide-eyed expression, she continued, "I suppose you can glamour your face if you like."
"You'll be there too?" Harry asked, knowing the question was ridiculous, but still needing confirmation.
After he downed it in one sip Malfoy nodded and pushed it aside, grabbing his hand and pulling him to the dance floor.
They got beer— lemonade for Teddy— and soft pretzels at Yankee Stadium and sat down. Once the game had started, Teddy and Harry had to explain the rules to Malfoy. Teddy was a bigger fan than Harry had realised and he'd apparently spent the year listening to his muggleborn friends talk about it.
He read through, mumbling as he went. "Non-smoker, sure, sure. Non-drinker," he crossed it out. "I don't really care about that, Mione. I drink."
Hermione loved the scarf and photo album and asked him if Malfoy had helped pick it out. He admitted that he had, a bit. Ron thought the t-shirt was funny and said he'd give the kids the toys tomorrow. They were asleep since it was almost 9 at that point. Then he asked, "Did Malfoy and Teddy get on well?"
"What if," Seamus said, "we take the Nipple Twister idea and market it as part of the WonderWitch line? That could sell, right?"
Malfoy whacked him on the arm. "That's because I'm not. It's the muggle's fault for creating such an inane contraption, not mine for being uncomfortable using it."
Harry left the office and marched down the stairs, coming to a stop in front of Verity, who was reading the latest Witch Weekly with a rainbow ball of fluff perched on her shoulder. The shop was otherwise deserted.
"I'm a Death Eater, Potter. My whole family is. I used to walk on money and leave proud footsteps behind me, but that doesn't happen anymore. Now, I try to hide in the shadows as much as possible and I don't want anyone to even look at me. I don't like it when people look at me for I know that there's nothing good going through their heads."
He almost turned around before even reaching the end of the corridor, set on going back to the stairs and go somewhere else before going back to bed. However, even in the darkness, he could make out a hunched over figure sitting on the floor by the last window of the corridor.
And then it ended. The kiss stopped and Malfoy jumped away from Harry, leaving him dazed and wondering what had happened, how everything had shattered so quickly.
And that had to be some high praise coming from Malfoy. More than Harry ever thought he would get from him, more than he ever thought he wanted to hear from him. Strangely, it didn't feel entirely weird to hear it, it felt heartwarming. It made leaving the past behind feel solid between them.
Malfoy was on the first floor and Harry had a feeling that he had chosen that place just to be an inconvenience and make Harry climb down all the stairs from the tower. It seemed like the kind of thing that Malfoy would do, make sure that Harry knew that they weren't friends and that he wouldn't make his life easy at all.
He turned and left without saying anything else, without waiting for a confirmation that Harry would meet him that night. He didn't need a confirmation though, Harry knew without an inkling of doubt, that the moment Malfoy had said to find him he had made up his mind. Harry would find him that night and he knew that it wasn't only for the books.
"Oh." Harry debated if he should get up and leave him alone after all, but Malfoy had been the one to tell him to sit down.
He turned his head to look at the place where Ron had poked him earlier than evening and, sure enough, there was a bruise in the exact same place.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows at the question. Then, Malfoy pointed at his right shoulder and Harry twisted his head to look. Despite the angle, it was impossible not to notice the dark purple bruise that marked the skin there. Neville had pulled him back when they were leaving the dorm the day before to go into the common room and the bruise had appeared right away.
McGonagall grabbed her book and left with one more pointed look in Harry's direction. Hermione reached out a hand and put it on the table near Harry's arm, not touching him but showing that if she could, she would give his arm a supportive squeeze. Soon, they wouldn't have to hold back.
Harry sighed, knowing that he wouldn't be able to get away from it and convince Draco to let it go. So, he turned his head to the right and let Draco look over the left side of his neck, waiting impatiently for him to finish his examination.
He pulled back his chair and got up, grabbing his books and leaving Harry's on the table. Before he left, he turned around and gave Harry a small, closed-off smile.
Harry didn't know. No one had said it would, but then again, no one had known a whole lot about it in the first place. Maybe it had lifted on its own. Maybe it had been a temporary thing.
"I wanted to get away from the castle for a while. It was getting suffocating. Either Pansy and Blaise are hanging off my arm or someone is sending glares my way and I needed a time out."
Harry wasn't sure how what he had said that had made the mood sour so quickly, but he wanted to not have said it. He wanted Malfoy to have that open, amused expression on his face again, he wanted him to keep talking to Harry and let him talk to him.
The door had been closed not too long ago, his roommates leaving for their classes. Classes that Harry didn't think he would ever miss until he had been forced out of them. Forbidden from leaving his room, fear for his health speaking louder than anything else.
But Malfoy was still staring, eyes sharp and unmoving from Harry's form. Harry was sure that he wouldn't be able to escape. Malfoy knew.
"My life is far from normal, Potter," Malfoy's voice sounded like it did years ago, before their late-night conversations and weird understanding of each other.
"I would touch you. That's the thing I want to do the most. I would touch without fear of bruising my fingers. And I would kiss you without thinking that it would bruise my lips," he said. "I don't think I would mind a few bruises, to be completely honest."
"Now that's something I didn't expect to hear. Who would have thought that Harry Potter would miss not going to class."
Harry laughed and almost reached out to clap him over the shoulder, the reality of his situation hit him before he could.
There it was. The question Harry had been waiting for to tell Malfoy everything. He wanted to tell him everything and he couldn't even fully comprehend why himself.
Harry shook his head,d told himself that he was brave enough to do and say what they both needed to be laid out in front of them and moved his hand so it was resting on Draco's thigh.
Harry groaned, playing the part of the annoyed friend who didn't want to study. He didn't want to study, he'd rather spend his night doing anything else, but this was Hermione, who always worried about him and who was always there for him. Hermione who wanted to make sure that he knew enough about everything so that he wasn't lost when he went back to class. And he couldn't say no to Hermione after she did so much for him, not only now but over the years.
"Nah," Harry chuckled. "I actually think I'm going to get something from the kitchens. I'm really fancying a late-night snack, right now."
"Scared that it will make me vulnerable," Malfoy hesitated, but he had already started talking so there was no going back. "If I hide everything I'm thinking and feeling, then it will be easier to pretend those things were never there and it will be harder to get hurt."
Harry didn't wait for a reply and left the corridor quickly, throwing the cloak over himself and almost running to the safety of the Gryffindor tower.
He rested his whole hand on Malfoy's shoulder and shifted closer, felt his cheek warming up with Malfoy's breathing. He turned his head slowly, swallowing around the lump in his throat. Malfoy's eyes were dark silver in the shadowy corridor, intense as they stayed connected to Harry's.
"We can start with Defence maybe?" Harry suggested, thinking that spending a night studying was worth it to thank Hermione for everything.
The three of them had been sitting at the table since Ron and Hermione had come up from dinner, reading books and parchments, taking notes and coming up with theories. Now, it was dark outside and most people had already climbed the stairs to the dorms.
He hadn't come to the kitchens this year yet. He had known that the elves were probably going to throw a figurative party around him if he appeared, but thinking they were going to it hadn't exactly prepared him for all the attention he was receiving.
He let the stairs take him to another path, one that ended on the fourth floor and he jumped out of them. The corridor was as dark, cold and blissfully empty as the others had been. Harry walked along the wall, one finger shooting out to touch it as he walked, feeling the rough stone against his skin.
Harry hadn't ever thought that he would want to go to class. But as he sat up in his bed, alone in the dorm room, as he went down the stairs to the empty common room and ate alone the breakfast the house-elves had brought him, he could only hope that things would go back to normal.
Harry stared at Malfoy's profile. He looked as tired as Harry felt, hair down and messier than Harry had ever seen it, lips downcast into a frown. The idea of telling him what had happened with him seemed more plausible than Harry ever thought possible. But he had been advised to keep it under wraps, in fear of it getting out to the public and there being a worrying amount of articles about it. And more danger for him. Hermione had seemed sure that if anyone knew that it was a curse with 'Harry Potter's true love'
Now, Harry was sitting alone at one of the tables. He had made the effort to grab some books about curses, had even brought some of the ones McGonaggal had provided them, but he wasn't exactly paying attention to them. He could see a Ravenclaw boy flying about in the courtyard through one of the windows and he could only feel strong envy towards him. This damn curse had taken his freedom, Hogwarts, the ability to be with his friends normally and quidditch from him. He wanted all of it back.
He had taken a nap during the afternoon, intent on passing some time without going mad with boredom, and had ended up sleeping more than he had meant to. Now, he wasn't able to fall asleep.
He shuffled even closer and Malfoy stared down at the diminishing space between them, the furrow between his eyebrows was the only thing that showed his confusion. Harry grinned and moved his hand, touching Malfoy's sleeve with his index finger.
Harry grinned at him and noticed the three books that were stacked on a pile on Malfoy's other side. He had actually brought them then. Malfoy had actually asked his mother for books so that he could help Harry out and he was bringing them to him. Harry had believed when he said he would be bringing them, but after everything that had happened between them through the years, it was good to have in front of him the confirmation of how much Malfoy had changed.
He had had to bring up the fact that he hadn't been outside and gotten some fresh air in way too long, that he needed to leave the tower and that he was starting to feel like a prisoner. His friends still hesitated but ended up letting him go when he promised he would avoid all the busy corridors and would just go outside and avoid everyone.
"My insomnia is hardly new, Potter. Anyone with a brain could conjure that I probably don't have the best sleeping schedule. No one does really."
"I think that opening up is hard, but sometimes it's worth it. Sometimes letting yourself be known and letting other people know you is the best thing."
"Because we are terrible at staying in bed all night. And because you always seem to find me," another pointed look aimed at him. "So, find me, Potter."
She smiled at him, a small smile that was more concerned than reassuring. Then, she closed her book, golden letters spelling 'Love Spells' shinning in the dim light of the common room.
McGonagall was in the common room when Harry got there. She was standing next to the table where Ron and Hermione were sitting, pointing at a book that was opened in front of them. Hermione was nodding along to what she was saying, jotting down notes on the parchment in front of her and Ron was attempting to read the book from the other side.
There was a beat of silence. Malfoy was looking at Harry, his eyes travelling all over his face, trying to assess if telling Harry what he had been keeping inside was the best decision to make. Harry tried to keep his expression as open as possible, to keep his eyes on Malfoy and let him know that he wouldn't judge him, that he would be there to listen to what he had to say.
It was probably true. Harry was so used to having a target on his back, to researching all sorts of things - though Hermione did most of that part - and constantly looking behind his back as if he was going to be attacked at every second, that he most likely would be very put off by a 'normal' year.
The common room was empty, the fire still lit and warming up the room, casting an orange glow on the walls and furniture.
Hermione had her head buried in a book, five more scattered around her. Her fingers were stained with ink and her hair was messier than usual. A frown was on her face, but she resolutely didn't look up; not when a few second years started playing Exploding Snap, not when Seamus started telling a story in a loud tone, not when a few fourth years started giggling as they gossiped on the couch.
"I asked my mother to send me some book from our library and I've been reading some," Malfoy started. "They're about curses. If you want, I can lend you the ones I'm not reading and you and your little friends can see if they have anything of interest."
Ron was rubbing his eyes with the heel of his hands, yawning as he pushed the book he had been sleeping on to the centre of the table.
"Fair is fair," Harry sighed. "I missed the castle. I haven't left the tower in days and I felt like I would go crazy if I stayed in there until… well, until I'll be fit to walk around."
Malfoy didn't seem to believe him, but he also didn't seem to care enough to pray for answers and explanations.
He was still not going to ask for answers and Harry wanted to shake him and make him demand them, that way he would have a better excuse to spill everything than just his crazy want to do it.
Harry nodded at her and sent a smile her way, meaning to reassure her that he was alright and would be alright.
She had a serious expression on her face and Harry wanted to be annoyed that she was ordering him to stay confined, but there were some lines of worry on her face that told him that part of the reason, probably the biggest part of the reason, she was doing all of this and telling him not to go anywhere was because she was worried about him and what could possibly happen if he went out and interacted with people.
"We will." Her voice wasn't quite sure and there was doubt in her eyes, but, tonight, her words were enough for Harry.
And that joking tone was so far from what Harry had ever expected from Malfoy, it almost seemed like he had imagined it. Harry had never heard that tone coming from Malfoy, much less aimed at him.
The kitchens were warmer than the rest of the castle. The heat a welcomed change from the shivering cool of the corridors as Harry entered. House-elves were fusing about, doing Harry wasn't even sure what. Some stopped to stare at him as they noticed his entrance.
He tore his gaze away from the window and found Malfoy on the other side of the table, three books in his hands, looking down at him.
Hermione had paced around the infirmary as they waited while Ron had sat on the chair next to Harry's bed, staring ahead. Harry had felt like biting his nails. The silence that had engulfed the room had been suffocating and he hadn't known how to deal with it. It had made his mind run laps and pick up possibilities and the idea of terrible outcomes on its way.
Harry's head shot up, eyes jumping to Malfoy at the mention of 6th year. Malfoy turned to look at him, an annoyed expression on his face.
From his voice, from the rushed words and flushed cheeks, Harry knew that Malfoy was thinking of the same alternative that he was. The one that would explain why his touch didn't leave any bruises on Harry while Ron's touch had. They were thinking of the same thing, but it seemed impossible. It couldn't be.
Harry rolled his eyes at the 'adoring fans' comment but didn't interrupt. He figured that talking this openly about himself was already taking a toll on Malfoy, he wouldn't forbid him from making any snide comments.
Harry knew that Malfoy wasn't about to outright ask him what was going on, as suspicious as he was that something weird must be happening. He would wait for Harry to talk, would say things to prompt any confessions that Harry wanted to make, but not demand anything.
He wasn't sure how to articulate it, though. He didn't know how to put into words everything he wanted to say and everything he wanted Malfoy to know. He had never been quite good with words and with saying what he meant, not like Malfoy deserved him to be.
Malfoy stayed in silence and Harry turned his face to look at him. His expression was closed off yet pensive. He seemed to be thinking about Harry's question and how to answer it, which was more than Harry thought he would do. He had thought that Malfoy would simply brush it off and make a snarky comment, but it wasn't happening.
He shoved the map in his pocket and the cloak underneath his jumper and descended the stairs to the common room again. The fifth years were still sitting on the couch when he came down again and they looked up at him as he appeared.
Now, it was good to be able to walk the Hogwarts corridors again without the fear of bumping into anyone, having someone shove him out of the way or giving him a friendly pat on the back. It was good to be able to move around Hogwarts again, he had missed it. Being confined to the Gryffindor area simply didn't cut it for him, Hogwarts in its entirety was his home and he had been missing it greatly.
"I will tell you once things are ready. In the meantime," McGonagall looked pointedly at him. "Stay in the tower, Potter. I don't think you want to be hurt more than you need to."
Harry watched as she woke up Ron. She put a hand on his hair and run it through it slowly, her thumb catching on his forehead sometimes. She leaned down to whisper in his ear when he groaned sleepily and patted his back softly before stretching up again.
They appeared so quickly that they started overlapping each other, old one not having enough time to fade before new ones emerged. There was only so much that could be linked to his clumsiness. The array of bruises on his arms, his wrists coloured purple, his bruised back that had scared Ron quite a bit when Harry had taken his shirt off one night; those couldn't be because of clumsiness.
Malfoy's face closed off, the playful expression fading into a cold one that left Harry feeling lost and strangely resentful.
That was an easy enough question to answer. And Harry did appreciate the opportunity to change the subject.
Malfoy was sitting on the floor at the end of the corridor, half-hidden in the shadows. Harry walked slowly up to him, steps careful and silent as not to be heard. He still didn't know how last time Malfoy had been able to know he was there when he was being careful.
"Not you too, Potter. It's bad enough that everyone who sees me alone thinks that I'm plotting something, I don't need the Golden Boy to feed into that." He rolled his eyes and turned back to the window.
Harry opened his mouth but opted for showing him instead of just telling him. In for a little, in for a lot. He sighed and pulled his sleeves up, exposing the black and blue bruises that were littering his arm, from wrist to elbow and disappearing beneath the bundled up sleeve at his bicep. The bruises from his last days of classes hadn't faded yet and, even while being so careful, there were some new ones.
"Yeah, but you were going to," he shrugged. "And, anyway, you did help. You kept me company when I couldn't sleep."
This time, he was even more careful with his steps. He walked on the tip of his toes and held his breath for as long as he could, his whole body tense with the effort to make no noise at all.
"I personally don't think that I would ever miss classes," Ron grinned when Hermione glared at him. "I'm kidding, Mione, don't worry."
It was the middle of the night. Harry wasn't sure exactly what time, but the sky was pitch black outside, not even the moon making an appearance.
Draco laughed. A small, breathy sound. Still unsure. But his hand squeezed Harry's and there was hope all around. Hope for the two of them.
His efforts were rewarded when Malfoy didn't look up or make any remarks. If he had noticed Harry, he would have said something.
"I think I do have to." His finger went walked along Malfoy's arm, not quite touching it, but climbing the length of the large sleeve. "I've been injured before because of this curse and it was just annoying. Getting injured after I touch you… That would be completely worth it."
The curse didn't seem like a burden anymore. It would be lifted soon and for now, Harry was buzzing with the feeling of Draco's skin against his own. Despite the lonely month he had spent, Harry felt like he had ended up winning in the end. Winning more than he had ever asked for.
"Voldemort is dead," he started. Malfoy flinched subtly at the name and Harry pretended he hadn't noticed. "And I doubt you're working for some other newly risen Dark Lord."
Harry stared at Malfoy, considering if he should tell him or not. On the one hand, it was Malfoy. Malfoy who always made fun of him, Malfoy who didn't like him and always had a strong opinion in every situation, opinions that usually diverged from Harry's. But, it was also Malfoy who knew nothing about the situation and was sitting alone in a dark corridor in the middle of the night.
Technically, he didn't need the books that Malfoy had gotten for him anymore, but he still had to meet up with him to let him know that. He couldn't just let Malfoy stranded and waiting for him the whole night with the books he had kindly gotten for Harry. Kindly. A word he never thought he would apply to Malfoy, but that was what Malfoy had been, kind enough to ask his mother for books for Harry.
He hurried down the stairs, not wanting to make Malfoy wait too much in fear that the other boy would think he wasn't going to show up. When Harry hopped down the last step, he mumbled the words to erase the map from the parchment and closed it, putting it inside his pocket.
The dorm was quiet apart from the usual snores of the guys he shared with. Seamus was the loudest, but Ron was close on his heels. Dean shifted on his bed, turning to face the door as Harry entered and he stopped in his tracks as not to wake anyone. He tiptoed to his bed, opening the trucks and getting his invisibility cloak and the Marauder's Map from it.
Malfoy hummed, a noncommittal noise from the back of his throat that told Harry nothing about how he felt about the little time they spent in each other's company.
He was elegant about it. He dabbed at his already clean lips with the napkin in front of him, pushed the chair back without making any noise and got up with a straight back.
The professors hadn't known what to do with him. They had never had to deal with a case like that and they hadn't been sure what would be the right course of action. When Hermione had asked if there was a counter-curse, they had hesitated and then Slughorn had said that they would research until they found something. It didn't do much to reassure Harry.
"I don't have a lot of ideas," Harry admitted quietly, sensing that a change of subject might be necessary.
"Hey, mate." Ron had approached their table without him noticing, looking more like himself than Harry had seen in a while, but dead tired all the same. "Ginny and I are gonna head back to Grimmauld. Lee's got somewhere to be early in the morning and Astoria decided to follow her friends off to a dance club." Ron shuddered exaggeratedly, quirking his lips. "You coming?
As Malfoy was speaking to the guys, a man in a chef's hat came out and talked briefly with him and Blazer guy. They were allowed to leave without any problems as long as Harry would release the men. He did and got up, walking away as quickly as possible to avoid the crowds and putting up his Glamour again.
Harry wasn't sure why either. Maybe he just wanted an excuse to get to know Malfoy again now that they were out of school.
Malfoy called back while he was giving a lecture to a group of incoming Aurors. Normally, Harry wouldn't have even brought his phone into work, but he was anxious to get this over with and so he answered, forgetting to take off his Sonorus before he'd already pressed 'accept call.' The trainees could hear his side of the conversation.
"I figured that whatever product he was testing malfunctioned somehow, based on the reaction. Knowing Mr Weasley, though, an entirely orange room could have been the goal."
Harry shook his head but didn't disagree. He focused on the lights and the beat thumping and the feeling of being completely lost in a crowd, with only Draco Malfoy knowing or caring who he was. It was exhilarating, even if it was just for a moment.
'Daniels, Darth, David, Daxley, Dealby, Point Me!' Harry hadn't spent much time in the stacks but he was pretty sure Point Me would fall under P, right next to Potter. He took the little card out and read it over. 'This is the section organised by last name. If you are looking for (d) Death Eater, check under known associates of (v) Voldemort."
He accepted the food she offered him and stepped out into the hallway to sit and eat. Verity plopped down across from him, sipping on a fizzy drink and leaning back against the balcony railing.
"Pygmy puff, you like? I've named him Elton John. Say hi, Elton," she cooed, wiggling her finger at it.
"And why is that? Because a war bonded you together? Because you were in a giant castle away from home for the first time and you had to find some way to not feel lonely?"
The buzzer rang again and Harry stood. He wasn't sure if he should wait for her number after what happened last time or if he should just move on.
"Just thinking about all the work I'll have to do on the office to get to some of Fred and George's ideas is making me nauseous."
Looking around the room, Harry baulked at the dust covering every single surface. It seemed like it hadn't been used since Fred had died, maybe even before Harry's 7th year.
What was wrong? She was beautiful and she wanted him. Maybe he had to know a person better first to like kissing them.
That, Ron snatched out of his hand and uncorked, chugging the contents down. Within a minute he was through with the side effects and looking much more agreeable.
Malfoy patted him on the shoulder rather harshly. "Cheer up, Potter. In just a few short weeks you'll have this crusty old dump all to yourself."
"Oh definitely," Hermione agreed. "How else are we supposed to remember what he looks like when he isn't at our house all hours of the day anymore?"
Harry got off the couch at Grimmauld place and stretched his legs. He hadn't wanted to move once Teddy had fallen asleep next to him a few hours ago, just in case it woke him. He had to go to the bathroom, though, so it couldn't be avoided.
"Bats have the quaffle — oh, lucky that didn't last long — Wadcock, yes that is her real name ladies and gentlemen, you can trust that I asked, is back in possession — passes it to Bricks — not half as smart as one if you ask me — and the Puddles score!"
She snorted, meeting Harry's gaze for a brief moment. Her face reddened and she leaned back against the mostly-empty stand behind them, cupping her hands around her mouth to holler, "Keep playing right like that, Wood! At this rate, you'll win me a bet!"
Astoria's mouth curved into a small smile and she held out a hand to Ron, waiting for him to shake it. He did, hesitantly, and Harry wondered if the slightly horrified expression on Malfoy's face was because he noticed the glazed look in his eyes too.
Hermione sniffed and asked what he'd thought about the topic of his speech since they hadn't talked about it the day before. He reminded her it was really more focused on people orphaned by the war when she tried to talk about the depression aspect.
Harry might have found a solution to The Problem. This was what Hermione had taken to calling his love life, naturally. As was typical, she acted like the answer should have been obvious to him all along, even though it wasn't. Harry was also pretty convinced she never would have thought of it if the events leading up to the Idea hadn't happened exactly as they had.
Luna looked concerned. "Doesn't Harry get any people?" she asked. "I wouldn't want him to feel left out.
He met Ron outside the Burrow on Sunday and pulled him somewhere quiet. They ended up only a few meters from the house, but where no one would stumble upon them accidentally.
Harry smiled as Draco crawled under the covers with him. His feet were cold and they sent pricks of ice up Harry's legs.
"Are you having a laugh?" he demanded. "Potter, you have absolutely no idea what that substance is. Walking in could cause immediate and potentially fatal consequences."
The look on Ron's face didn't change and Harry nearly screamed in frustration. "I'm not! Just because I can't find a wife doesn't mean I want to bugger Malfoy!"
He'd been drunk though, they both had, and their heavy conversation topic had made it all the worse. He wasn't trying to start anything with Malfoy and he'd made the right decision. But what did he do about the fact that Malfoy might still want him?
The next day, Ron cornered him in his office and wouldn't let him leave until they'd 'talked it all over.'
"It's fascinating stuff according to Patricia Gibson. She came right into my office all the way from New York, ranting about death eaters and an imperiused savior trying to steal her DNA. Care to explain?"
He was five minutes late when he arrived but the woman who greeted him, Lorelai, told him he shouldn't worry as they wouldn't be starting for another ten.
Chains coughed and Malfoy grabbed another glass and filled it with beer, sliding it across the bar to him.
When Teddy stumbled blearily into the kitchen the next morning, he and Malfoy sat quietly as Harry made breakfast.
"It'll take hours. At least forty, likely more, if you want to do it safely. And you should." Again, he pointed this at Harry, who was honestly quite offended. Of course he would be safe! He might've been sorted into Gryffindor, but that didn't mean he was completely reckless.
She never cried in front of them. He didn't know why, or what she was trying to prove, but she didn't. She would lock herself up in her room and turn the music up full blast, only coming out hours later when she could pretend nothing was wrong again.
In the end, after a lot more talking, they agreed on Harry following the classic Potter method. He'd pretend it never happened.
"I can't believe you haven't gotten any better at flirting yet!" Ginny crowed. "Should we sign you up for a class or something? Seriously. 'Oh Malfoy, let's talk about the war. Let's bring up our grief and trauma. That'll get me into your pants, won't it?'"
The two men followed and sat on either side of him. One was clean-shaven and looked like he'd completed 6th form barely a week ago. Harry wondered if the place didn't ID anyone. The other guy was muscular and wearing some of the chains he'd spotted earlier. He looked closer to Harry's age.
Harry remembered his Glamour was still in place and dissolved it wandlessly, defeating the original purpose of the 'misunderstanding.'
He didn't feel even a sliver of guilt as he smashed the glass. A reparo would fix it right up and Patricia hadn't gotten on his good side anyway.
He arrived at 7:50. The restaurant was covered with plants outside, Neville would have loved it. A man in uniform approached him.
"Our Harry forgot to mention one key detail. Puddlemere is not playing just anyone, oh no, they're going up against The Ballycastle Bats."
That was how they ended up getting samples of every ice cream flavour and letting Teddy test them with his eyes closed. Malfoy ended up admitting that the flavours were all different even if they were unnecessary and got a chocolate. Teddy settled on Banana and Harry spent a full minute debating between caramel drip and chocolate before Malfoy said, "if you're that torn up about it, get the caramel and then you can have some of mine."
Dear Wizarding Public, it is with great pride and even greater anxiety that I announce to you the failure of my project to find a wife. This is not because there was any shortage of lovely witches willing to court me, it is because I have fallen instead for a man. I'm done lying to everyone, especially myself. Even if this man does not love me back, I will be glad to no longer have to feel ashamed of who I am. Thank you for your understanding through the years. I hope this message finds and empowers anyone who needs it to tell their truth. I am not currently, nor will I ever court a woman again.
"Oh!" she said delightedly, clapping her hands together. "Was that funny? I didn't mean it to be a joke."
"Brilliant. I've just won the bet." He blew a ring of smoke into the air and leaned back in his seat with a grin.
They looked around and Teddy examined a row of snow globes and then an array of condoms that said stuff like, "no glove, no love," and "remember the election with your next erection," which Harry lead him away from.
"But did you have fun? It's been a while since I've seen you so..." he gestured with his hands and stole a bite of Harry's half-eaten bruschetta.
Perfect, still before ten. The shop didn't open until noon on weekdays, but Harry had asked her to come in a little early so she'd be there to show them around. In all honesty, he hadn't visited in months, so he wasn't sure where most things were or how to answer any questions Malfoy might come up with.
"Right, sorry, mature. But Merlin, the nerve of that boy. Did you see the way he was looking at me? Like a kicked puppy. Like he wasn't the one to break it off in the first place."
"Well, the other employees are all typical Potter Fanatics, the really obnoxious kind who worship the ground you walk on. I'm pretty sure my cubicle-mate has a poster of you hung over his bed."
"Good point, okay. Then you're... following me because you want to appeal to the Potions master of my choice."
There was one more thing they had to do before they left New York, and that was visit the Gibson's. Patricia Gibson was a powerful pureblood woman who had married into a half-blooded family against her parent's wishes. For this reason, she was very against blood supremacy and thus had the potential to be the murderer of Lucius Malfoy.
Falling asleep had never been easy for Harry but he tossed and turned that night more than usual. He had a lot to think over. Did he even want to be with Malfoy? Was it worth it? Eventually, he drifted off some time past 4.
"Yeah okay, Potter. Just tell me when the Portkey is." Malfoy flipped open his paper and grimaced at whatever he saw before tossing it back on the kitchen table.
The phone beeped and he knew she'd hung up. He was lucky she hadn't yelled his ear off for waking up a new mother. As he fell into bed,  he thought about Hermione's opinion. For that night at least, there was no getting out of obsessing over Malfoy. He was Harry Potter, after all. That's what he was good at.
Harry looked at Malfoy, noticing the careful way he was tracing the ring of water his glass had left on the table.
He thought that would be the last of it since he didn't hear from Neville for the rest of the afternoon, but at half eight that night, the floo chimed and he went over to it curiously.
He looked between the two of them, stunned that he hadn't considered their talents in this area before. Neville and Seamus were brilliant at causing [].
Harry woke up at just past 7. He had decided not to tell Malfoy about the conversation with Finnley Shaw yet, or about the picture of a young Mr. Shaw waving right next to a stonefaced Lucius Malfoy and a grinning Protheus Longbottom that must have been taken before Harry and Malfoy were even first years.
Truthfully speaking, Harry hated talking in front of anyone nowadays except his closest friends, who at this point included the very long list of Ron and Hermione. They'd both tried to help with The Problem before but the problem with their attempts to fix The Problem was that they always went about it the same way.
"Understood, sir." He might have lost his job, but Robards didn't hate him. The press would have a field day with this and say he was going crazy, but it didn't matter.
The lab was clean and empty when they snuck in and Harry felt confident enough to turn on the lights. The fluorescents made Malfoy look paler than usual and he seemed nervous too. That part probably had more to do with the morally questionable activities and being in the presence of his Father's killer's DNA than the lighting, though.
A woman in a sharp, pressed suit stepped forward from a bench, twirling her wand in a small circle under her chin to speak. "Yes, Your Worship. The Ministry has selected Draco Malfoy as the inspector."
He'd gone through them all and there wasn't a sign of Malfoy. He was almost positive protocol was to file under surname, but he decided to check under L for Lucius, too. And then, when that didn't work, under D for Draco.
Malfoy snorted. He was clearly drunk at this point. "If it was, then at least I'd have an excuse for feeling like this. At least I'd have an excuse for wanting to get back at whoever did it, rather than thank them for doing us all a favour when they killed him."
Harry panted against his neck and thrust again. It was so good, so hot, and he wondered how he ever could have thought he didn't want this, didn't want a single part of it. He wanted Malfoy's hands gripping his hips to hold him in place and he wanted the small whimpers falling through his lips. He wanted the gasps every time Harry sucked a kiss into his neck and he wanted the feeling of a cock against his own. He wanted skin, and sweat, and Draco.
"When you see him again, try not to be all obsessive about it. So, he isn't your soulmate, that's no surprise. You two being mates though isn't impossible to imagine."
"You're next, Gin!" he shouted. She usually preferred a few minutes to compose herself so she could pretend like she hadn't been crying this time, after all.
Malfoy took Alicia's hand and kissed it and Jerome shook it after. "Pleased to meet you, Ms. Baldwin." They smiled hard at each other.
At then end of the meal when Malfoy offered Harry the last bite of Tart, he sat back and looked at him for a moment.
The ball was on a Friday and it started at 7 o'clock. Because of his nervousness, Harry'd spent most of his day at work practicing steps while finishing up his reports. He had to go into the lab at one point to consult on a case about an illegal bonding and the room made him miss the Malfoy Murder Mission. And okay, maybe he missed his almost-friendship with Malfoy himself too.
Her smile grew strained, and she looked over her shoulder. "You're sure you want to see it? You wouldn't rather show Mr— sorry, Draco, around the main store?"
Malfoy handed him the drink and continued wiping down the bar. The question popped into his head again and he thought there'd be no better time to ask.
Harry thought about what it was for him, warm summer nights playing quidditch at the burrow, Hermione's smile when she looked at her children, Rose's first steps, Malfoy's almost jokes that came more frequently every day, Ron's cheers when he watched the Cannons, Barkley's condescending look when Harry pretended to throw a toy, Hogwarts where he always felt at home, and cast. All around him wands lit up. Across the way, a dragonfly danced out of a wand and circled around his stag. The children on the ground beamed and the sixth year boy responsible for the corporal laughed in delight.
They'd set him up with a nice witch they knew from work, or Ron's fantasy Quidditch league, or that Hermione had met in line at the grocery store and tell her they had the perfect person for her. When that person was Harry Potter, though, it all went south. Even the possibility of finding someone had started to seem like it wasn't worth the effort when it came to the number of leaked interviews to the press and sobbing women on his doorstep when they realised he wasn't going to call back.
Harry wasn't, though, and when he got home that night he went straight to the floo and firecalled Malfoy. Screw waiting until the testing. All the talk made him unable to stop thinking about him.
Harry stood in the Ministry lift feeling tempted to spell his eyes open. The previous night had been hard, leaving him with just three hours of sleep and the horrifyingly realistic image of Sirius getting a dementor's kiss seared into his brain.
Verity didn't make any indication that she recognised him, though it was impossible that she wouldn't have, and he seemed to relax infinitesimally.
"I'll see you at 10 tomorrow morning for our last day in the city and our meeting with the Gibson's."
Harry's brain basically short-circuited at that and he got the caramel. Kiss anyone, share their ice cream. It wasn't referring to someone specific, but was it somehow referencing the person he was sharing ice cream with right now, walking through New York City?
"Right, yeah. Being the one who goes around and tells people that their livelihood, their family business, their passion project has to close down was the dream right from the womb." He didn't take his eyes off the road, clearing his throat. "No, Potter, I didn't want to be a fucking inspector. It was the only job that was hiring and I needed the money. Still pays well, and no one else wants to take it, so I'm set."
"If Harry's going to make me sit through this," Ginny said, "there will be retribution. Come here, come join!"
"Ah, none of that." Harry took the pillow Ron was using to shield himself from the light and tossed it on the ground.
The waiter came over to their table to refill their drinks and ask if they wanted anything else. Neither of them did so he walked away to go get the bill. Speak of the devil, he sort of looked like Malfoy.
All around the room people noticing and pointing them out to their friends. Ron seemed to be enjoying it, though Hermione was glaring at everyone who so much as sniggered and Malfoy had that damn gleam in his eye. He shoved Jerome when he started mocking Harry, though.
"Er..." Harry looked at Malfoy, who was busying himself with cleaning the mess off the table and stacking their glasses, not meeting his eyes. "Why don't you go on ahead?"
Malfoy insisted they eat at the table he had near the edge of the patio as they "could at least pretend to be civilised, Potter."
As Lee ran through the pitch stark naked—Ginny laughing madly and Ron wolf-whistling—Harry and Malfoy sat in silence, the space between them feeling a lot bigger than it had the night before. There was something about him that always made Harry feel as if he were talking to a stranger. It took Malfoy a while to warm up every time they spoke, like they had to start over from scratch.
When he got to Ginny's door he knocked twice and waited. A few moments later it creaked open and she poked her head out.
"I'm only saying I think you've been good for him. He seems more relaxed than he was as a child, more genuine too. Maybe with the right encouragement, he can find it in himself to not care so much about the Public's opinion of who he falls in love with."
Verity seemed to be fighting a heavily punctuated eye roll, but she eased Elton off her shoulder and into Harry's hands.
When Harry walked in, Ron was lying in bed with a pillow over his face, the drapes drawn and the smell of booze thick in the air. From the room next door Harry could hear Balanced on a Broomstick blasting at top volume.
Harry nodded, but when he briefly met Malfoy's eyes, he felt more out of his depth than he knew what to do with.
Instead of answering, Harry held out the bouquet of flowers for Narcissa and she took them. He'd put a cut of Pieris japonica in there too and when she saw it she breathed in sharply and brushed her finger against it. She smiled at him for the first time.
"I would have been! You're the one who's so bloody concerned with people thinking you're gay! I've been out since my father died, so don't try to blame this on me. Of course, it's my fault.  I'm not a nice witch who wants to settle down and pop out twenty children."
Harry hadn't forgotten that the person sitting in front of him might be the killer. "Malfoy's important to me. I don't know why."
Ron looked absolutely delighted by this prospect, though Harry wasn't sure which part of it he was most interested in. He didn't stay to find out.
And this is where it got messy. Robards had always liked Harry, but overlooking a thing like using Ministry property for his own personal reasons was beyond what most would consider redeemable. How much did he know? He didn't usually work on weekends, someone had tipped him off.
"You know, I think I will join," said Lee, sitting. "It'd be a lot harder to see your lovely face from across the pitch, wouldn't it? Though I suppose Omnioculars have to be good for something."
Third came the makeover. Not of himself, thankfully (though Hermione had been hinting at her desire to captain that ship for a while now), but for the shop. Vanishing old and expired products, fixing up the broken ones, talking to Dean about some new advertisement posters for the windows, and getting Luna in to give some tips on interior decorating.
Harry looked back and forth between the two of them. Their glares were almost identical until Daphne stiffly nodded. She lead them out of the parlour and down a long hallway, filled with moving portraits. At the very end was a door, but they didn't go in that one, they moved to stand in front of the one next to it.
They were sitting in an Italian restaurant that was equal distance from the Auror headquarters and St. Mungo's.
She stopped fussing with her cup and son and focused entirely on him. "Harry, if you come out just to court him, and then it doesn't work, or your relationship ends badly, I don't want you to regret doing this. You shouldn't be doing this for him."
Malfoy's arms wound around his neck and they moved to the rhythm. He could see Ginny and Oliver dancing now, much less appropriately than he and Malfoy. Beside them, Ron and Hermione were moving to the beat and smiling at each other. Dean and Seamus were dramatically mouthing the lyrics to each other at their table.
"Well, Pansy's made it practically impossible to get rid of her. Crabbe's..." He cleared his throat like that was all he'd wanted to say, but when he spoke again his voice came out more slowly, pauses where it might have broken if he'd let it. "Goyle doesn't have a permanent address, but I get a postcard every couple of months telling me about his new favourite foreign food or a landmark he found particularly thrilling. Nott still comes around to Blaise's place on occasion, but he was always the quiet type, so there's not much to report on there. And none of us have heard from Millicent in years. Last I knew, she and her parents were holed up somewhere in Scotland, but there've been rumours that she fled the country since then."
He was almost smiling despite the fact that he looked tired. His hair wasn't gelled like it usually was and reminded Harry of him at the hotel. A quick glance around revealed that whatever money Malfoy was making at the ministry and bar wasn't going here. The place was cramped and dingy, though the furniture looked antique.
One was blood, what they suspected to be Lucius's and the other was hair, thankfully with the root attached.
Barkley raced after it and Draco stood and grabbed the pizza box, gesturing for Harry to follow him outside into the Garden. The sound followed them out. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away, like a newborn baby it just happens every day
"Alright, Harry." She bit her lip, looking down at something he couldn't see, then back up at him. "They're both doing okay, yeah? I just, I feel so guilty being away."
Alicia laughed and grabbed Harry's arm. "Looks like you have a sense of humour, I think we'll have fun tonight."
There! See, that was the outrage he was looking for! If only she wasn't a couple of portkeys away, he'd grab her up and spin her around in a circle.
"We tested the most probable ones. What are we gonna do, go through every single person who was in the vicinity?"
"I have a right to know! Why do you care if it distantly affects fucking Longbottom? I won't go after him! Do you even care about me?"
Today had been about getting his mind off things, and it'd worked, but it hadn't fixed his problem. He had to admit that he was in trouble. It did no good to dress up the shop and put a fancy ad out if he wouldn't have new things to sell.
They could only test two at a time so it was slow going but they stopped for breaks every once in a while to eat some of the food. Malfoy had brought fried rice and egg rolls at his request which Malfoy characterised as "terribly pedestrian," but Harry was pretty sure he enjoyed.
Both Harry and Teddy agreed that tagging along was the best way to spend their time and it turned out that Malfoy wasn't very hard to convince in the face of his favourite cousin.
"You're trying for that?" Ron asked Harry. "You never... and with Malfoy?" His face brightened a bit at that. "Did you rough him up or something?"
Harry was about to retort when Malfoy spoke again, apparently not needing an answer. "Is this camomile?"
He really hoped this was worth it. He put it in an envelope and owled it to the Prophet before he could think on it a second more.
In fact, he had no idea what it was that Ron wanted to do. Maybe laze about all day for the rest of his life. Perhaps once Harry got the joke shop back up and running, he'd join in on that.
There was a small chance that the killer was Protheus Longbottom and in that case, all the samples would test negative and no one would get hurt. Harry wasn't one to believe in small chances anymore.
A waiter came by to grab their plates and Harry stopped her. The waiter snatched her hand away and placed the bill on the table, taking the plates and cutlery. Fuck. A byproduct of demanding they meet somewhere muggle, he guessed. No witch would have ever treated the saviour that way. Refreshing at it was, it threw a wrench in their plans.
Harry shoved Malfoy who smirked. "Prat. Don't act like you don't understand the parts we've already explained."
"I've been working with Draco these past few months on a project. I feel like your input might be more important than he believes."
Harry grabbed Teddy from their room and lead him to the lobby where they waited for ten minutes before Teddy started to get antsy. It was another ten before Harry got annoyed too.
Something occurred to Harry as they walked up the stairs. "If you knew who I was and if you don't want us to have your DNA, why'd you let us in?"
Malfoy was sitting on the sofa when he got back, his hands folded neatly in his lap, eyes landing on Harry immediately as he stepped in.
"We regret to inform you that Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes has missed its latest mortgage payment," Ron repeated blandly. "You have until October 1st, 1999, to complete the payment, or the property will be forfeited—"
They talked for a while longer and Harry could see Malfoy wanting to be excited about it all. He went to bed that night wondering how Malfoy could be so good at understanding Potions and so bad at understanding himself.
"She was younger than me, of course, but she was always very smart. I'm glad to see Draco's grown up like she wanted. Not like that father of his raised him."
His eyes trailed down from Harry's favourite t-shirt—old and ratty, containing the Campbell's soup logo—to the pair of jeans he hadn't worn since Dean had dragged him to that muggle art class and they'd been stained, all the way to the frog-green wellies Luna had gifted him for his birthday.
"You think Muggle-borns and Pure-bloods should live side-by-side harmoniously but a girl has one physical flaw and you-" Here she broke off to start crying.
"There was an erm..." Harry looked to Hermione for guidance and she shrugged unhelpfully, "confrontation of sorts. But it's all worked out. I'm meeting him this morning to discuss further plans for the shop."
Malfoy placed a kiss on each of his knuckles and Harry drew his hand back so he could make him look at him.
"Er... just that, really. You're trying to get it to work using a spell, but anyone who buys the product will expect it to work without an incantation, yeah?" Seamus chuckled. "So you've got to interweave the enchantment with the material."
"Fuck, Malfoy, all we know about her is that she hated your father, what if she's homophobic? She might not even talk to you. And what if she told the Prophet?"
"Would you like to join us, sir? We're coming up with ideas to help Harry save Fred and George's shop."
He snapped his fingers twice and Harry handed it to him with a snort. Malfoy transfigured it back into a quill and used it to mark off names. He got rid of almost half before he was satisfied.
Harry shoved a jumper off the couch and threw the pizza on the coffee table. He hadn't changed much about Grimmauld place since he moved in, but the house-elf heads were gone and the couch was much more comfortable than any furniture there'd been previously.
Harry took it all back. Zabini wasn't that attractive, even if when he turned around to open the chamber door, Harry could admit to taking a peek at his arse.
They didn't make much small talk, though Rosier was quite willing to discuss the war and Harry's role in it. Harry himself tried to veer away from this topic.
His hair was ruffled, sticking up off his head even as he tried to force it to rights again, and his ears had pinked up profusely. Malfoy swore, brushing dirt off of his waistcoat and trousers, frowning at his foot.
Draco let out a defeated sigh and Harry pulled him on top of him and pressed a kiss to the back of his neck.
"Ah, that's our cue," Malfoy said, and then he grabbed Harry's arm and everything went black—the familiar pressing sensation of side-along apparition closing in on him from every side, his ears popping sharply, and his eyes threatening to fall out of his head—before they landed at the corner of Diagon Alley, right outside the building that used to be Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
"Ah. Right then." Ron blinked at him, then gave a stiff nod to Hermione and turned out of the room, leaving the paper on the arm of the sofa.
Malfoy raised his brows, leaning back in his chair and not looking remotely impressed. "What are you trying to prove, again?"
Harry wondered what Malfoy had been like as a child. Sure, he'd known him at Hogwarts, but like a real, proper child. Around Teddy's age, first starting to have any semblance of a personality. Had he always been so prickly, so severe?
"I don't need to clean the entire room," Harry said. "Just enough to find some of their old product ideas. Will you tell me the incantation or not?"
"Are these from..?" He pulled away from Malfoy to run his fingers across the scars lining his skin. Harry hadn't ever wondered if it'd scarred before. There were three pale white ones crisscrossing his chest and a few thinner ones that only took up a few centimetres.
Clearly, there was something but there was no way Malfoy hadn't noticed Verity's hesitance and he was bound to suspect something if Harry said he no longer wanted to go up there.
"Well that all depends on Draco," Harry answered. "Technically, I'm not an Auror anymore, so I couldn't arrest her even if I wanted to."
"Not at all, he was pleasant and funny, but I didn't agree to let Ron set me up with whoever he wanted only for him to pick a man."
"He said that on the night of the murder you were feeling ill and so you stayed home. He said that you still blame yourself for not being there to stop it, even though he'd rather have just one dead parent than two. He also said that the only way for you both to feel safe would be the killer being found and locked away."
"It is. I haven't seen you so engaged in a long time, years maybe. Just don't worry about what Ron thinks, or what I think, or anyone. Have some fun with it."
With a sigh, he looked at the orange gunk admitted that he should probably wave the white flag and get a team to clear out the rest of the office. It felt wrong, somehow, letting strangers invade Fred and George's space, but he knew it would have to be done in the end, and putting it off wasn't helping anybody.
Harry hadn't been to lunch at the Burrow for a while, but he needed to talk to someone about this. Malfoy had invited him in. Malfoy wanted to have sex with him, unless Harry had completely read the situation wrong. And fuck if Harry hadn't wanted it too. He's wanked himself raw the night before just thinking about it.
Ron nodded and shrugged, rushing over to steady Ginny as he saw her stumble out of her seat drunkenly, laughing with her as he supported her out the door. It closed behind them and Malfoy still hadn't spoken, but he turned back slowly to Harry.
Harry looked around the pub, seeing Ginny and Lee still sitting at the bar, but long since finished with their meal. Ron and Astoria were on a sofa with some of her friends, laughing loudly about something or other.
Harry was about to respond saying that obviously, them being closed was Malfoy's own fault, when suddenly Malfoy began pointing one of his obnoxiously elegant looking fingers at the products downstairs.
"Quite right," Ron said, finally sitting down himself. He'd surprised everyone after the war by getting invested in Healing too. Hermione actually hadn't looked much into Mind-Healing before he'd convinced her.
"No, Potter, seeing as this exact spell has never been done before, I'm not actually trained in the art of breaking it."
Harry went to bed that night with that face still fresh in his mind, tossing and turning. Ginny's brown eyes welling with tears. It was better than Ron, at least, because most of the time his just looked dull, like there was nothing going on at all.
Malfoy spent the next half hour waving his wand around, making annoying faces, and sighing. Every time he did so, Harry grew more on edge.
Peter was stalking down the aisles towards him at record speed. Harry grabbed his clock and three it on, making a run for it and taking the file with him. Hopefully, Peter hadn't recognised him.
