<p>"Dray wait, please?" Harry asked but he was already gone.</p>
<p>"Fuck..."Draco sighed</p>
<p>"I don't have a broom Harry" Draco sighed</p>
As night fell, the train arrived at the platform Draco grabbed his bag and exited the train, he glanced at Harry and looked down
<p>"Yeah, but you have to chase me for it, Accio broom" Harry casted as his broom flew towards him he hopped on and flew away.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Blaise replied as he walked closer to Draco</p>
Everyone boarded the carriges and made their way to the Great hall for dinner. No one noticed that Draco had slipped away and sat alone in a abandond classroom, he pulled out a picture of Harry and looked at it, his cock was hard, he upzipped his pants to relese his throbbing cock, he started to slowly stroke his cock moaning Harry's name. Back at the Great Hall, Harry noticed that Draco wasn't here, he was concerned and worried.
<p>"Are you and Malfoy shagging?" Ginny asked</p>
<p>Draco and Harry couldn't stop staring at each other, smiling. Snape put everyone into pairs, and he happend to put Draco and Harry together to the boys enjoyment.</p>
"Oh Draco yes!" Harry moaned
"He won't hurt you as long as we both live, as your boyfriend, if he touches you, I will legally take action"
Harry kicked his pants away and walked towards Draco, The blonde shimied out of his pants, Harry lifted up Draco's legs, muttered a spell to lubricate his cock. Draco nodded and Harry slowly pushed his cock inside Draco.
"Yeah...I'll write to you later"
"C'mon Harry, let's go" Ron said as he nudged Harry
<p>"Fuck, if Potion's didn't start soon I'd do more" Harry smirked</p>
<p>"Wait what?" Dean asked confused</p>
but he phased that out and just went for it, what they didn't know wouldn't hurt him.
<p>"Defiently" Harry agreed</p>
<p>"Blaise tried to kiss me, I pushed him away and said I was seeing someone, he asked who and I told him, then I said not to tell anyone then he asked what he got in return, I told him he's a typical Slytherin and that he has my friendship but asked if he cares about it, then hetold me he wants to suck my dick and I told him to fuck off" Draco admitted</p>
<p>"Me either Professor" Harry replied before he pretend to gag</p>
<p>"Does anyone else know?" Draco asked</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm dating Draco Malfoy, okay now shut up" Harry blushed</p>
<p>"Okay, I trust you and them" Draco nodded</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Draco asked</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Exactly mate"</p>
"He won't hurt you, remember that" Harry smiled as he kissed Draco once more before they went their seperate ways.
"Yes" Harry smiled and Draco smiled slightly
"Good, now off with you" he nodded.
"What if people find out? What if it goes to my father?" Draco said worringly again
"I promise" Harry replied as he put his forehead onto Draco's.
"I'll be back, I gotta use the lavatory" Harry said getting up
"FUCK!" Draco moaned as sticky white cum spurted onto his stomach, Harry wasn't far behind, his moans grew animalistic as he chased the orgasm he wanted, a few seconds later, his hips stilled and twitched as his seed filled Draco's hole. The boys eyes were locked on eachother as they panted, Their lips locked once more before they moved apart to get dressed.
<p>"You dirty fucker, but I think where you're going" Harry smirked as he pinned Draco down</p>
"I want to be with you but I'm so scared, I'm scared of him"
<p>"Potter! Malfoy! You are late!" Snape growled</p>
<p>"I called her a Mudblood remember! Even if i do apologise...she hates me!" Draco yelled</p>
<p>"Are you seriously horny right now?" Draco asked</p>
<p>The got to the Gryffindor Common room, they stopped in front of the door, Harry said the password and they entered.</p>
<p>"Sorry Professor" Harry apologised as he sat next Hermione</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I ran off earlier, I was scared and I realise that it was a dick move-" Draco started to say but Harry kissed him, his eyes closed, then Harry pulled away.</p>
"Fuck" Draco moaned as Harry was now fully inside Draco.
<p>"That's cool!" Harry nodded as he spread the lube over his aching cock</p>
"Draco..."
"Fuck...Draco" Harry moaned, he just wanted to thrust, but he had to control himself.
<p>"Morning Harry" Ron yawned</p>
<p>"Typical Slytherin, my friendship or don't you care about that?" Draco spat</p>
"What I did was wrong, it never should of existed...my father is going to kill me if he finds out" Draco spat
<p>"Sounds good" Draco nodded as he sat next to Harry</p>
"I love you Draco, and I want to be here for you-"
<p>"I'm sure she will fogive you Dray" Harry replied grabbing his boyfriends hands</p>
<p>"Harry's looking for you" Hermione said</p>
<p>As Hermione and Ron we're walking from Potions they went into the hospital wing to check on Harry, but he wasn't there...so they checked the Common Room, they walked in and saw the clothes on the floor and in the staircase, they slowly snuck up the stairs and entered Ron and Harry's room but what they saw was not what they were exprecting, Draco bent over the bed head and Harry inside him pounding.</p>
<p>Once Hermione and Ron found Harry they told him where Draco is and he ran there holding his broom.</p>
<p>"I want to suck your dick" Blaise said bluntly</p>
<p>"Draco, you are the most handsome person I've ever seen" Harry smiled</p>
<p>"Harry-P" Draco blurted out, he quickly put his hand on his mouth</p>
<p>"Oh I will, making you moan my name loud" Harry whispered, making Draco shudder</p>
<p>"Fuck" Draco moaned as Harry's head bobbed up and down quickly, Draco gripped Harry's raven hair tightly, Harry's teeth dragged against Draco's cock causing a gutteral moan from him.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
"Fuck" Draco moaned and Harry pulled away slightly
<p>"Dray?" Harry smiled</p>
Draco walked in and walked to the sink, tears started to fill his eyes, he lifted his sleeve and looked at the fresh cuts he had made that morning, he started to sob and sob, he didnt notice that Harry Potter had walked in.
"Nothing, it never happened" Draco replied bluntly
"Harry...I want you" Draco said again as he started unzipping his pants once more
<p>"Stop lying Harry, I heard you talking to Malfoy earlier"</p>
<p>"How much did you hear?" Harry asked rubbing the back of his head</p>
<p>"Bloody hell Mione, give us a warning next time?" Ron asked and she rolled her eyes</p>
<p>"Morning" Mione smiled</p>
<p>"Draco...If i was gay you wouldn't have a problem right?"</p>
"Okay..." Hermione replied awkwardly
<p>Their lips connected again, as they removed their clothes in the hallway, Harry pushed Draco onto his bed, his kisses trailed down from Draco's lips down to his erect cock. Harry licked the slit that was oozing pre-cum, then he engulfed Draco's member, causing the blonde to moan loudly.</p>
"Yeah...wow" Harry chuckled back
The next morning Harry wrote to Draco, telling him to meet him before breakfast, then complimenting him and telling him he loves him, then he sends it to him via Hedwig.</p>
"I'm about to cum" Draco moaned
"Draco I will do anything to make sure that he never hurts you again, I promise and if poeple decide to be assholes I will kick their asses" Harry said grabbing Draco's shaking hands
<p>"Who?" Blaise asked</p>
"HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW?!"
<p>"Maybe" Harry replied as he flew closer to Draco</p>
<p>"If you see him tell him to meet me at the Quiddich Pitch" Draco replied as he walked away.</p>
<p>"We should go..." Draco sighed</p>
"Yeah, I'm okay" Harry nodded.
"Draco there is nothing to be ashamed of"
"Fucking cum for me" Harry moaned
"Malfoy, I just want to help" Harry replied walking closer, all Draco could focus on was his plump lips and his sparkling emerald eyes, but the words of his father was on repeat in his head
<p>"You alright Draco?" Blaise asked</p>
<p>"True" Draco nodded</p>
"FUCK HARRY" Draco yelled
<p>"I thought so" Ron nodded</p>
<p>"This" Blaise smiled as he went in for a kiss but Draco pushed him away</p>
<p>"Malfoy really Harry!?" Ron exclaimed</p>
<p>"Go see Madam Pomfrey" Snape growled and Draco and Harry left</p>
<p>"Uh not feeling well" Draco coughed as he tried to hide his blush</p>
<p>"I know so" Harry smiled before planting a kiss on Draco's lips</p>
"I was looking for you" Harry smiled and Draco's head immediently shot up.
<p>"Dray, calm down the only person that is smart enough to figure it out is Hermione. She won't judge you, I'm sure she won't mind us dating"</p>
<p>"I had to wear a gown" Harry lied again</p>
<p>At the Gryffindor Common Room, Hermione, Ginny and Ron were waiting worringly for Harry, Harry was beaming as he walked into the Common Room.</p>
<p>"Well you know, no one is around and it would be kinky" Draco suggested</p>
"Ah, ah, Fuck" Draco moaned as he started to scratch down Harry's back
"Hey, I won't let anything happen to you" Harry replied as he wiped Draco's tears away
<p>"I didn't know you could do wandless magic?!"</p>
"No clue Mione" Harry lied but little did he know, Hermione heard them talking.
<p>"I did not see this coming" Seamus sighed</p>
<p>"I thought you'd never ask" Draco smirked</p>
<p>"It is, like you" Harry smiled as he headed back to Hogwarts</p>
<p>"He won't find out Dray I promise" Harry smiled ashe pulled in Draco for a final kiss before they head to potions</p>
<p>"Fucking hell Draco" Blaise chuckled</p>
In his revisions, he’d left Draco Malfoy on The List. He’d crossed out the epithets and the ‘sodding.’ Striking him entirely hadn't seemed right, though, either. The loss of the barrier, the restraint: it wouldn't do to remove them now, not when just the sight of him
“Even if I considered myself the most attractive, likeable bachelor in the world, Potter, there’s no universe in which I would lower myself to someone as willfully ignorant and indifferent as you’ve become. Now kindly piss off because incredibly, I’d rather look at anyone—any
Harry leaned over to jostle him a little. “Of course you’d like it. It’s like one of those—oh, what was it called—the panoptic tower,” Harry said, face lighting up with the connection. “Not a perfect analogy. No prisoners, obviously, but it’s in the spirit.”
He brought down half a set for tea before recalling what he’d come to the kitchen for and switched to a pair of tumblers. He stepped over to the pantry as well and took out some of the Chelsea buns he’d ordered for the next day’s Christmas lunch. If he got up early enough, he could probably salvage together another tray or two. And if they all had to overdo it on mimosas instead, the group would manage.
Harry moved his pawn. “And what about the two of you? Any big updates while I’ve been gone?”
Harry made a face. “Not my thing at all. Though I suppose you’d have plenty of time to do that here. Sitting in that tower staring at the same old horizon all the time.”
“Now what?” Draco asked around a shaky smile. Harry leaned forward to meet their foreheads.
Draco didn’t have to check that Potter was right. The whisper of the Dark Lord didn’t linger anymore. For the first time in years, he felt alone in his body. More like the Draco Before.
His gaze traced over some of the bodies on display. Pulling was out of the question, no matter how fit everyone seemed or how welcome the distraction would be. If Malfoy’d been flustered by the sight of another’s body, Merlin knew how’d be responding to some of the things Harry saw now. Or to a place this crowded. Except he wasn’t caring what Malfoy thought. He stepped into the mix, dodging various couplings to get to the stairs for the second floor. He could catch up with the rest of the group for a while at least.
“As do my other clients,” he added, frown drawing deeper. Not good.
“Maybe,” Harry said after a moment, fairly certain about where this was leading.
Ron started banging around the pots, his back to Harry. "That's almost a month.” Ron tasted something from the largest pot, stirring up the fragrant herbs and tomatoes, then turned to wave the spoon in Harry’s direction. “Can you handle being home for that long?"
Avoiding the canteen, Harry headed out of the Ministry to grab food and a coffee from a nearby stand. He saw the Daily Prophet on the newspaper stand beside it and braced himself for the worst. The cover, at least, was Harry Potter-free. He grabbed a copy and paid for it along with his meal. He went back to his desk to eat and review its contents. From front to back, he didn’t find a single mention of himself. It made buying the damn thing kind of worth it. He tossed it back in the bin and wiped his fingers clean.
“Dally? Is that a fancy way of saying sleep around?” She squinted at him.
“They aren’t very original when it comes to naming things, are they? ‘Beautiful Point Lighthouse.’ ‘Golden Gate Bridge.’”
His observations of Malfoy’s habits after that were just a product of their proximity, really. Malfoy’s desk sat just to the left of the entrance to the bullpen, when you walked into it. Harry couldn’t help if it was always there in his periphery as he came and went. And over time, passing the same bit day to day, one would be bound to notice little things (well, not
She gave him an over large smile. “Luna and I practice radical honesty, Harry. Our home, our rules.”
Harry’s nose scrunched up. “Sounds terrible.”
He put his face in his hands. Took a number of deep breaths, feeling guilt prickling in his chest and throat.
“I’m glad to hear it. I know it must have been unpleasant for you. So I decided to get you a token of my appreciation.” He flipped through the files beside him, then handed over a thin one. Harry checked it over, then opened it, reading and then re-reading the words.
“He can’t speak English that well either.”
“Let’s go.” It wasn’t until he reached the lift that Harry put it together. Their room hadn’t been served yet. The sheets had still spilt haphazardly over the bed.
A dark haired figure stepped through the door. Draco leaned to get a better look, grip tightening on the edge of the bar. Pansy Parkinson strode through the entrance and made her way over to him.
“Actually, there is,” he said, turning to face them. They looked stunned at his address—he'd never spoken with them before—then recovered enough to get their quills and cameras ready.
Draco’s brows rose. “Have you never read a murder mystery? People are always offing relatives to get their inheritance early. Or at least threatening bodily harm until the will changes.”
For a long while, Malfoy didn’t respond. The resounding bass and heat from the crowd started to press in the longer they didn’t speak. Only when the last drops of his drink disappeared down his throat did Malfoy finally curl his body further toward Harry’s, eyes cool this time. Blue, then red, under a passing strobe light.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Ron, something clicking into place. "Be there to supervise, you mean, if that doormat is any sign of your decorating sense.” He looked back at Hermione. “Did she really take that old thing we used to have out there? I nearly thought I had the wrong apartment. The bookshelf still had some life in it at least, but the doormat’s nonsense."
“I considered leaving this morning. Before you woke up.” Harry looked up, and Draco gave him a flickering glance before turning to look down the hall. “Until I realised how suspicious it would look for me to show up alone and early for a portkey.” He seemed to mean it as a joke, but his tone failed to carry it. Harry helped himself to another piece of toast, considering.
The words echoed in Harry’s mind long after he slumped to the floor and released the spell. He caressed the wood between them, a terrible pulling reaching his heart through his spine. He should have been here sooner. He should have come after him right away.
“Why wouldn’t he use the couch?”
Draco snagged at the fingers tugging his shirt out of his trousers. The teasing look dropped from Harry’s face at whatever he saw when he looked up.
They paused at the threshold to Harry’s bedroom. Harry’d returned to the master after Ron and Hermione moved. There was plenty of space now to navigate around the bed. But they’d explore that later. Harry squeezed Draco’s arms through the dressing gown he’d put him in, his breath ghosting over the cloth collar to graze the small hairs curled at the back of Draco’s neck. Passing Draco’s side, Harry leaned forward to swing open the bathroom door, then led them through the vanity as well. He’d kept the lights off for now and, before Draco’d arrived, drawn the curtains over the small half-circle windows near the ceiling.
Whatever energy had fueled Malfoy through his speech left him then, too. His back and knees curved as his body slouched.
“Not really, no,” Harry said at last, letting his hands cross over his chest. “But what’s that you’ve been saying? We’re all being watched all the time?” He extended his hand to help Malfoy to his feet. When Malfoy accepted it and stood, Harry noticed that for how cool the other’s skin often seemed, it almost burned to the touch.
misread it. Gotten ahead of himself. No, he wouldn’t bother with it now. Better to just… wait and see. If Harry ever actually showed up.
Their shared breaths echoed in the dark. Draco’s sped ahead of Harry's own. Hurried. Hitching a few times until Draco seemed to become aware of it himself and purposely slow it down. Harry returned to his place behind him, nose pressed into the valley of Draco’s ear and hair, hands settling along the dressing gown belt on either side of Draco’s hips.
“Have fun at the conference?” she asked, wiping some of her hair back off her face. It didn’t do much. He watched the strands bounce back into place, wild around her. She caught him staring and tilted her head. “Are computers going to take over the world, or whatever Robards feared?”
Harry started to take a drink, then changed his mind and leaned forward. “Malfoy’s The CRAPI Department? Entirely?”
“We’re here from the Ministry of Magic,” Harry said, glancing over what appeared to be a shoebox filled with name cards. The man’s beard moved, and Harry assumed there was a smile far beneath it.
That could not be what this was about. Harry lifted a shoulder. “It was fine. Nothing eventful. Lots of surveillance theory.”
“So let’s have it, then. No no,” Potter added when Draco reached toward the flap of his bag. “I’ll summon it. Keep your hands where I can see them.” Draco did so, watching the package rise and float over to Potter’s hand. Potter looked it over, felt its weight, before reviewing the address. He scowled and tossed it into the air. It held there, suspended for one short moment, then burst into flames. Potter was
“Next,” the nearest official yelled. Malfoy winced at the tone, and Harry started down the walkway.
They returned to the hotel with an hour to spare before the portkey. Harry’d packed the night before, so he paged through one of his conversational Spanish books while Draco sorted and packed his things.
“Which you’ll ignore?”
Harry tried to picture this. For some reason, all the Kneazles came out hairless. He shifted focus. “So you don’t live in London, then?”
She flicked a hand at him, shaking her head as she headed down the hall. “Coffee is exactly what I was referring to. Even my trust in you has limits, Harry, and one of them is booze before brooms with my only grandchild.”
"Why do you know what my trainee thinks about my office?" At her knowing smile, Draco ignored her for the entrance way. The wreath above it looked sparse this year, more twig than brush. Had they replaced the one Dean had accidentally set on fire the year before? Still looked better than the curtains nearby, though, which never quite recovered from the time Finnegan chundered on them on Bachelor’s Eve 2005. Or the carpet, with stains dating back to the first Bachelor’s Eve and fluids they’d all sworn never to speak of again.
Harry wondered if he was still asleep. Auror Robards sounded far away, like he’d whispered to Harry in a wind tunnel. It wasn’t possible.
Harry watched, then said: “So, there’s a chance I’d actually have to see him wearing them. Or worse, after the fact.”
A sinking feeling had grown and settled in him as he made his way through each new file. In his own occasional eavesdropping and notekeeping over the years, Harry’d become well aware that Jenkins and Flemings had been involved with some bribes, some warrants that weren’t entirely above board. Draco’s files detailed a much deeper and more nefarious series of actions. Physical attacks on family members for persons of interest. Planted evidence in at least three cases. Untoward advances on grieving or recently widowed spouses. Unlawful arrests and extended detentions.
He’d been looking at Harry’s hand. He looked up at his name. His eyes were still that lovely grey. Something unwound in Harry’s chest. Despite the defiant tilt of Malfoy’s head, he’d sucked his bottom lip between his teeth.
But who was counting. Harry added the polvorones next, trying not to crush the beige, delicate biscuits between his fingers. He already felt the weeks stretching out before him. “After that, I’ve got a conference to go to. Completely forgot about my continuing education requirements, so I have to shore that up before they let me back in the field.”
Harry stilled. “The ones since that last Reynolds case?” Harry asked, uncrossing and recrossing his legs before turning a page. A long pause followed. The Reynolds case had been solved more than a year ago.
He headed straight for the master bath once he reached the empty apartment. The strangeness of doing so didn't strike him until he tripped over one of Ron’s shoes on the carpet. Which led to the decidedly feminine clothing and accessories spilling over from the nearby wash bin. And the spread of books and discarded pages on one side of the bed. The framed photos of them kissing near a lake. Under a willow tree. A bit of vertigo, of stepping into something foreign and intimate, hit him fast, and he quickstepped through the vanity and bathroom and closed the door behind him.
Then he heard it. A shuffling of the curtain. A grazing against the wall, likely Malfoy’s knuckles reaching for a towel. Harry’s breathing slowed further. Malfoy was moving at least. For a while longer, only the sounds of the shower running remained.
“Harry. You know that I love you. You’re just, well.” She shifted, her expression getting a little stern. “Well, to be frank, you didn’t really seem like you wanted to know. No, no, let me finish. When you’re here, it’s so clear how hard it is for you to be home, even if you pretend otherwise for the first few days. And when anything controversial comes up, you get all fidgety and avoidant, and then you’re off again. Sometimes you don’t even say goodbye, like this time!”
“I most certainly can. And I didn’t want to tell you, because I knew you’d be a boor about it, but I actually have other plans this evening. I’d hoped you’d be too distracted with Pots to notice. Some Saviour he is.” She shrugged on her peacoat and pulled the edges of her bob out where it caught in her collar. “Now get out of my way, or I’ll be forced to beat you in front of all these people.”
“It’d be my pleasure.”
“Uh huh. Let’s say I believe you.” Draco folded his hands over his chest. “Your weird light hands tried to pull me into that circle of yours. I’m not supposed to take that personally?”
“You’re lucky the paper didn’t catch that.”
“Let me guess: is it a lovely emerald green?”
Malfoy sniffed, though the flash of a canine gave him away.
“Colour me surprised.” Malfoy looked at him, face open with a flash of interest. “Two connections in twenty hours, you did listen to some of those sessions.” He turned his face back to the lighthouse. “No prisoners, you’re right. Though here, the tower isn’t functioning as a point of authority. At the centre of a circular prison, the tower is meant to be that, the ever watchful eye. The prisoners, exposed completely to its gaze, are supposed to look at it and assume a guard is always there watching them, to catch them in wrongdoing. And there is. They get caught often enough. Until eventually, you don’t even have to staff the tower. By then, there’s always someone there in the prisoners’ minds, holding them accountable. Remarkable, in concept.” Harry recognised this Malfoy, the one that appeared when addressing some of the speakers and other attendees at the conference. Someone different from the pompous boy he’d been at school, but bolder than the withdrawn man at the tip desk. Someone new.
The man blinked up at him. “Good morning! Welcome to the Best Coast, gentlemen. First time in the city?”
Hermione looked at him over the choreographed movements of her bottles and tumblers assembling drinks. “The bookshelf…? Oh! Yes. Ginny came by a couple months ago to finally get her things."
It didn’t take long for Harry and Hermione to find him. For most of the summer, when they were all in Ottery St. Catchpole, they often escaped the house to a clearing at the end of the property. There, a grassy bit of land bordered a rushing stream, and they could spend most of the day unmoving under the shade of a large tree. Ron was already there, and Harry and Hermione laid out on either side of him, locking their hands. The stars above them seemed innumerous in the quiet that followed. It took time, but under the moonlight, the grass curled around their knees, Ron let out every bit of the anger he’d held in at the dinner table, a scorching sermon against the Malfoys and the Ministry, an arse-backward place that couldn’t protect itself from the Dark Lord, of course it couldn’t do any better protecting them. He cursed the lot of them, including the Auror Program, and swore then and there that he would have nothing to do with the place. His place was with his family, he said, and he’d help George with the store or Bill and Fleur at home or be homeless and jobless if he had to before he lifted a finger in aid of the recovering government.
Harry listened. Nothing. “Is that a good sign, or a bad sign?”
Malfoy looked at him and inclined his head to concede the point. “It does seem rather like something you’d come up with.” This was followed by a small smirk, and Harry squeezed his hands to keep them to himself. “Though the guide said this was the third lighthouse to be built on this coast. I have to imagine those people, coming onto this land and view for the first time, were rendered a little speechless.”
The disdain on Malfoy’s face sent Harry back a decade, to a sneering expression on the other side of a hundred toxic exchanges. “Makes us even then? For—” He let the sentence hang unfinished. His mouth moved to find the words, but nothing came out. “And all your friends feel this way?” Malfoy set his empty glass down with a controlled force, then shrugged his jacket back on. “Good to know.”
Harry shook his head and nodded toward the pitcher on the living room table. “I’ll have whatever you’re having. Tea isn’t going to do it for me.”
She rolled her eyes at him. “Times like this I remember you’re an only child.”
“Great.” Harry clipped on his watch and checked its face. “Head out in five minutes, give or take?”
Harry did a sweep around the room for a sign of Malfoy. Surely he wasn’t going to leave Harry entirely alone today. “I do. We’re in the bullpen together, though he mans the tip desk. I’m focused on field work mostly.”
“Of course. I’ll see you both on Monday.”
Her smile dropped away completely, just in time for Ron to get out that she was out of her mind.
“I’m not buying Ron stripey tight pants. Merlin, I live with the man.”
“No card?”
Malfoy groaned, though he stopped as well to watch Harry search in the sand. “There’s making do with the situation, and then there’s voluntarily seeking it out. The showers at Hogwarts were just a way of life. And I’m not even going to comment on the loos.” Malfoy bent at the knees near Harry’s side, rummaging for a few shells himself. “Besides, those people aren’t here for my viewing pleasure: they’re here for their own. It’s fairly common on the continent. Munich has a park in the centre of the city dedicated to nudity.”
Harry grabbed a seat in the lounge with the clearest line of sight to Malfoy’s door. Then he pulled out one of his Russian conversation books. He got through asking for coffee, directions, and the restroom before he tried to figure out what the Russian word for Death Eater would be. The words lingered, sticky. It’d been a while since he’d heard that term. The other Aurors were more creative with their taunts for Malfoy: they never pulled out that one. Technically, none of the Malfoys even had that designation in their official records. The family never went to trial, and the terms of their deal with the DMLE had included guilty pleas for less serious crimes, like trespassing or misuse of magical items, in exchange for opening the Manor up to the Department and sharing everything they knew about Greyback and all the other Death Eaters still on the run.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said. He laughed a little. “Played a part, at least.” Harry watched Malfoy’s fork pause halfway to his mouth, felt more than saw the darting glance of those silver eyes.
the spongy brown thing said. A familiar roar sounded on the other side of the door, but he checked the apartment number again anyway. Still 701. He shifted the bakery box against his hip. Even wrung out from adrenaline and the portkey home, he still swore that for the past six years, there’d been nothing but a worn grey plastic doormat where this sassy novelty now—
“Merlin, Potter.” Draco pulled out his list to confirm the delivery method.
The tendril pulled him onto the porch. Draco again saw the hanging ropes of gleaming peppers, the cotton and twine. The tendrils seemed to extend from those in particular. It was a focus. Potter was using them to focus.
had been her undoing. (“I’m too much of a reader for languages,” she’d said in a huff. “That’s what it looks like!”) They made quick business of dinner, Harry and Ron both nabbing seconds, before settling into the living room for Wizarding Chess.
Draco pulled a large box from the bag. He had to widen his knees to keep it from slipping off. “I see. I’m supposed to give you a card, when you didn’t even wrap my gift?”
The stories amplified Harry’s already insistent need to get out of England as soon as possible. And not just for his conference in six days (
Harry didn’t recognise Malfoy’s voice when it split like that. The sound of it compelled his hands up, reaching for either side of the other man’s face. The delicate flinch seared at him, but he didn’t stop until he’d cradled the soft skin lining the sharp edges of Malfoy’s cheekbones between his palms.
“Sorry about that, Potter.” Robards swept into his office and his seat. When he looked at Harry, his gaze flickered to the chair. Harry rocked back a little further. If he wanted obedience, he should show up on time.
“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go,” he cried, circling the kitchen. Harry caught him on the second lap and tucked him under his arm.
A few months passed before another late night, another unsolved case, led to another distinctive memorandum in Harry’s inbox. That time, he didn’t open it. He walked the distance between their desks, set his elbow on one of Malfoy’s paper towers, and waved the memorandum until—for the first time in years—he stared into the light grey eyes of Draco Malfoy. The colour matched the bags set below them. It shocked him into a few seconds of silence.
“As in, you’re leaving the Ministry, or...?”
“After you,” Harry said, voice quiet. Draco stepped in a breath later, and Harry followed, keeping a few moments’ worth of space between them. After a step or two into the room, Draco paused, and Harry swung the door closed behind them.
Harry tried to chase the thought, but he could smell the brightness of the ginger ale from Malfoy’s breath. Malfoy’s eyelashes were darker than his hair, more of a dirty blond.
“Weren’t going to—? You were right. I don’t know ‘Harry Potter’ at all.” Harry looked up at Draco’s tone, the disbelief on the blond’s face. “I’m not sure what I find harder to believe: that you were observant enough to see what they were doing, or somehow so completely altered you could ignore it.”
“The circuit?”
Something about the answer drew Malfoy even closer. Harry could feel the heat off him now, the press of his thighs slotting into the inside of Harry’s knees. “The deal they made with my mother, you mean.”
“Did you take drugs or something? You sound like a lunatic.”
Malfoy futzed with a napkin he nicked from the bartender’s pile. "My company would not be welcome there.” He said it stiffly, though he held himself straight in his bar seat.
Harry frowned at the note and put it in his pocket. “Almost, I think,” Harry said, his voice toneless. “Didn’t make as much progress as I’d hoped over the weekend.”
Interesting. “Didn’t mean to impugn your virtue. My clothes were all out here.”
“Merlin, Malfoy, just take the water.”
Harry put their drinks down and shuffled down the couch to close the distance between them. Harry’s heart clenched at the sounds that left her. The last time she’d been like this… It had to be years ago. After the War. Her failed efforts in Australia. Though she must have cried since then. Just, not to him. He put his chin on her head.
“Why are you—my
“Hey, Harry!” Above them, at the top of the stairs, Dave and Vickie waved as they walked, several others behind them. Harry felt Malfoy’s exhale near his neck, the clearing of the man’s throat. His grip tightened on the hair in his hand before letting it go. When he looked back, the round face and rosey hair were gone.
"Yourself?"
Stupid.
Ron rolled his eyes. His large hands waved a few bowls to empty chopped veg into the pan on the furthest burner. Harry recognised the bowls from his last trip to Mexico. They were cream-coloured, oven proof, and covered in flowers in bright blues, reds, and browns. Ron sent them to the sink. "So how long do we have you for this time? Going to bother unpacking, or is it another round of living out of that suitcase?"
Harry looked over the open binders spread on the bed, the notepad already covered in notes, the hotel dressing gown Malfoy’d put on. “Right. I’ll catch you back here, then.”
“What do you mean? It says right there at the bottom.”
“Oh.” Malfoy’s eyes followed the twisting of Harry’s hand in his hair. “I agreed to meet Dave and some of the others later tonight. Just for some drinks.” Harry looked up at him, surprised. That was a good sign. Malfoy went on: “But I think that was going to be fairly late. Shouldn’t be a problem.”
He did, for the most part. The couple he spoke with helped, taking a few bites when the owner wasn’t looking. Afterwards, despite the cold, Harry opted to walk back. He felt filled to the brim with food and a lengthy hike up the city’s hills would do him some good. The same method kept him in shape while traveling through Spain. Meat and cheese had been his weakness there as well.
Malfoy held up a hand and looked around them.
“Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. For the tip.” Harry felt compelled to say something: Malfoy had seemed to forget about him entirely.
He grabbed the handle and willed it to open.
The plain package arrived in Draco’s deliveries box on a Tuesday. It might've been January or April or August—the sun and smog of Los Angeles left the months a blurred stream of samey grey—but it was definitely a Tuesday that the weighty thing arrived bearing Potter's name and a crimson Ministry seal. Expedited delivery. Highly confidential. The protections swarmed thick over the paper, and Draco circled from a distance at first. Surely they would recognize him and swiftly strike him dead.
“Indeed," he said. Any of the other responses on his mind would get him fired. Robards let his seat tilt back further, both hands on his chest now.
He wanted another drink to flush the want that lingered, despite the turn, that made his body run hot. He reached for the leather cuff around his wrist and turned it over and over until the feeling passed. He stayed in place, the conversation replaying as he ordered another drink. Even after the cocktail, he couldn’t identify where he had gone wrong.
The following mornings, he’d stare at the Ministry package and consider delivering it to Potter anyway. Had he moved already? Gotten some rest? Would the Deniden be there, warning Draco to stay away? Then the tea would kick in, and he’d return the package to sender.
"A Chef de Partie," Draco said, his enunciation perfect, but wasted completely on his commoner boyfriend. His arms returned to his sides. "Don't let anyone within a block of that place hear you call me chef."
Oh. Malfoy’s lateness to the portkey slotted into place.
Harry turned to Malfoy, catching only a glimpse of stony grey before the other man looked away. “The front desk said this place is supposed to have nice views.”
“Wait here.” Harry kept a hand on Draco all the while, but walked around him to mark out its edges, the various handles, the few steps up. Hoping that all his luck would meet him here in this moment and keep him from tripping into an unflattering death, he lowered first one foot, then the other, into the bath, the water lapping over his knees and making his own dressing gown cling instantly to his skin. “Okay, there’s a few steps you’re going to have to take before you reach the bath’s edge. Take my hands… Perfect… and now feel your way up and over. I’ve got a steady hold, I’ll catch you before you fall, I promise.”
“Er, I suppose so.” Harry often shared rooms with several other people on his missions. He hadn’t felt body conscious in ages. A faint colouring was setting in on Malfoy’s cheekbones, different from the embarrassed flush at the portkey terminal.
By nightfall, the Ministry package was all that remained. Waiting so long was a risk—who knew what that place looked like at night—but going during the day had been no walk, either. He’d take his chances.
“See!”
**Two Months Later**
Hermione laughed and brushed her hair back, though she sounded apologetic as she added that “the colour wasn’t really right for the room, Harry.”
Really, it had to be better for all of them than now. To have the Harry he was overseas: who ate at restaurants and went out in public and socialised. Not the one he had to be here to get
The next time Harry tried to thank Malfoy, he thought he might have made some progress when the man actually looked him in the eye for a length of time. Except then Malfoy had said, “Believe it or not, Auror Potter, my ability to do my job isn’t predicated on your validation, but so glad to know that the Saviour approves,” and Harry went home that night to underline Malfoy’s name on The List several times and add variations of 'total tosser,' '100% prat,' and 'perma arsehole NEVER FORGET' in parentheses. Malfoy’s tips continued to be helpful after that, but Harry did not address him again and buried deep any memory of the heat that had run through him to face that burning gaze once again.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry said. “I appreciate the effort.” He thought of Minister Salas. There’d been an owl at his desk telling him who to speak with to schedule the interview when he got back. “I think I’ll actually be around for a few days anyway. Have a matter I need to wrap up first.”
“Doing great. George is going to open another location up in Hogsmeade this year.” He watched Harry move another pawn and clicked his tongue. “I’m working on a truth bomb. Sort of a play on a Sneakoscope, 'cept it blows up and dyes everything within a few feet blue if someone’s telling a lie.”
“Isn’t it, to save a life?” Harry asked. The edges of Malfoy’s mouth drew down for a moment. He looked away to the crowd behind them, his back almost touching his reflection in the window.
The pair of them headed straight back to the room once the sessions were over. The schedule allowed for only a twenty minute break before the groups were to meet back in front of the conference building for the buses that would ferry them to their respective afternoon outings. Harry might have looked into these things sooner if he knew they included these touristy bits. The only other one he’d attended was a somber affair on processing overseas magical beings coming to England. If that had an outing, he’d skipped it.
It felt, for a moment, like the ground had gotten even softer and his right side was sinking slowly into the mud. The raised voices from the other day lingered in his mind. He’d spent the three days after mostly confined to work and his room. He took a few steps toward the kids, almost groaning when it didn’t change the pressure he felt on his chest.
“Just a minute!” It was Hermione’s voice. She would not be pleased with his condition. He cast a quick drying charm. It came out on the strong side, and his hair bloomed into a floof about his head.
“I think she likes having young people around. I took the place because it was the closest to the law library. And I’ve meant to move since I got the shop started, but just, haven’t bothered I suppose.”
When he stepped out of the Floo and into the Ministry Atrium, Harry almost turned right back out again. No fewer than five people had the latest Daily Prophet under their arms. Today’s cover story featured, in full colour, center of the page, a looping picture of Harry purchasing a Bounty bar from a news stand. Above it, in all caps, the headline said,
“What?” Harry tossed the towel over his shoulder. Malfoy made a stuttered gesture at him.
“It was fine,” Harry began, shifting in his seat. “Though I was glad to get your note, actually, because I’d planned on—”
pulled Harry to close the distance. Harry’d already offered everything he had, and Malfoy didn't want it.. Better to fresh start in Spain. He steadied himself at his desk, his knees betraying him.
Now, in the bath, Harry’s lungs began to burn. He sat up, inhaling bubbles like an idiot after his sharp breath in. One of the benefits of working abroad, Harry supposed, was how easy it had made it to avoid Malfoy the last few years. Moving abroad would solve the problem entirely. The irony being that to do so, he had to spend about five days with him in close proximity. Perfect.
Before he could stop himself, Harry said: “Nah, I can speak for him at least. He just sits up there to focus. He gets distracted otherwise. Good notes, if you need ‘em.” The man said nothing else, though he gave a small nod in acceptance.
Malfoy sighed, then turned back to Harry. His eyes were nearly black, all pupils.
“Dave’s anti-tech,” Vickie said around a bite of her sandwich. “He’s here to find out all the latest methodologies so he can take them down from the inside. He’s in our Berkeley office,” she added, giving
Harry had to convince him this place was different. This wasn’t Hogwarts. This wasn’t the Ministry. They were miles from anyone that would tell Malfoy who he had to be. He could be different. They could be themselves here, together.
Once he’d controlled his coughs and managed to hold his face away, the Potter on the porch faded, replaced first in Draco’s vision by the end of Potter’s wand, and then presumably, the real Harry James Potter.
“Excellent, excellent. And Auror Malfoy? Hopefully he didn’t cause any trouble?” Harry let his chair fall back down to the ground. What a question.
And look at him now. International Auror extraordinaire. Maybe the next Assistant Head Auror of International Operations. His body felt blurry. He couldn’t consider the Spanish Minister’s offer now.
Stretching out his next drag, Harry considered where he could bugger off to tomorrow to avoid further conversation. If anything, the weekend had confirmed his instincts from years back: Malfoy was Not His Problem and too much of a bother regardless. Like it mattered what Harry thought of his penance. Like it made a bit of difference. Over the last few days, Malfoy seemed like he might have understood that. That their lives weren’t defined at seventeen, whatever England might have to say about it.
“So it was true, those rumours. You were trying to fix them, too?”
“Have a good time,” Harry asked, unable to help himself. Malfoy’s brows raised a little.
“That’s brill.” Harry frowned as he lost his first piece. Ron’s little pawn gave it a savage blow. “You’ll have to let me know when those get set, I’ve got an Auror or two I’d be glad to get blue-handed.”
Slowly, Harry’s eyebrows rose. Draco extended a hand, remembering his manners. “You can take a seat.” He spelled the fireplace to light. It glowed a soft blue, shining off the decorative orange tiles that surrounded the hearth. “I’ll get us some glasses.”
Malfoy’s stern expression melted away into something softer. The edges of his mouth curled into a small smile. “I know. Robards told me you were coming.”
“This is what?”
The assistant blinked at him a few times, brows raising. “Of course, Auror Potter. Unless something…” He turned toward Malfoy’s desk.
Harry went to leave, then hesitated. He’d use the loo here first: then he’d go. He started to open the bathroom door and reach for the light when a familiar voice shouted and pushed the door closed on Harry’s wrist.
Harry pulled off his glasses and groaned around a vigorous rub of his eyes. The Spaniards he’d been working with the last few months had been so certain that if Harry just tried enough varietals, learned more about what to look for, he’d get a taste for it. Yet he’d traveled nearly every inch of Spain tracking their suspects and for all their efforts, he’d liked it even less than before. Harry set his glasses back on. Surely he wouldn’t have to drink it if he lived there. It was probably just a form of hazing. Or like a pre-screen. One he’d passed, thank Merlin, if the Minister’s offer meant anything. His gaze ran over the living room, settling on the large empty space between the worn leather couch and nearest armchair when it came into focus. "What happened to my bookshelf?"
“The lighthouse is partly keeping the peace, watching the sea for dangers, of course, but it’s also a sign of comfort. The fishermen caught in a storm, the swimmers along the coast. They want to think that someone’s looking out for them. Will notice when they’re in trouble. Which is why they actually do keep it staffed around the clock.”
A tight grin flashed, then disappeared from his face. “He said he’d be here.” He made no mention of the chances he'd had (and failed) to tell Harry about the various last-minute cancellations. It didn't merit comment. In fact, nothing about the last time he saw Harry did. Draco was just going to put those memories in a box and seal it tight and bury it deep among the other realities one harbours but cannot face. Like his slowing metabolism. Or global warming.
Harry frowned at them over his beer. “What does Malfoy have to do with this?”
“I have things to do here.” Potter stared down into the bowl long enough that Draco thought he’d been forgotten. Then Potter added: “I’ll go back when I’m done.”
Third, he was being watched.
“I see. Do I wait here, or?” There were no seats on this side of the processing area. Further out, past the desks, he could see a welcome lounge.
“Amsterdam, then.”
Harry let his hand slide down around the door handle. Malfoy hadn’t locked it the other day. In whatever state he’d returned in, he might not have locked it now. He tried to turn it, breath held tight. The door knob stopped: locked.
Draco came up to the bed so quietly, Harry didn’t face him until the blond strands were visible over the top of his book.
And Harry, in that breathy near-whimper Draco’d always hoped for, answered: “I can think of one way to find out.”
“Sign here,” he repeated to himself, the baritone of his professional voice disappearing into the black. “I’m here on business, Potter, nothing personal.” He slowed his blades as he came to the exit. The handle felt warm to his touch. “Like it matters. Wanker probably won’t talk to me anyway.”
Malfoy stilled his leg and ran a hand back through his hair. It had a natural wave when it was wet, Harry’d learned that morning. The blond used a charm to straighten it out like it was now.
"So you waited just for me?"
Harry leaned on the back of Pansy’s former chair and took in what remained of the food spread. The suit he wore showed of much better quality than usual. Draco’s fingers still tingled with the urge to fix Harry’s tie.
Harry frowned, but let it sink into a pout, aware it would amuse her. “Why do you have to be so sodding reasonable? Couldn't we have just had a sulk together? You couldn’t give me that, for like a day? A good brood?”
Harry did not point out that moments before, she hadn’t been so kind to the public herself. Instead, he said: “I seriously regret telling you about that,” because he did regret it. He’d heard this speech before, and she did not care that he made clear he was an Auror, not a Reviser of Department Names.
Draco sighed. “Please stop speaking. It makes it worse.”
“I do have evidence, actually, other than what Auror Malfoy gave me.” Harry gave a smile that slashed like a grimace. “But I apologise—it’s going to refute all those nice things you’ve just said about me.”
an extra drag. Malfoy sat beside Harry and opened his lunch. He mirrored Dave’s movements from earlier: removing the sandwich, setting out the dish of mash, the applesauce, and mixed fruit.
“I do trust your judgment, Harry.” Andromeda stood and called for Teddy to come down. “But his problems will still be waiting for him when he gets back.”
“I’ll just be going then.” He started forward. The stare continued. “Right. Ta.” When he looked back from the house, it was gone.
“Right on time, Auror Potter, I’m impressed.” Malfoy’s voice ran through him like a balm. His mind had managed to mimic it well enough in his thoughts for the past few weeks, but it didn’t capture the nuances. The tenor that coiled around something deep between his ribs. Harry put a hand on the cubicle wall to get his bearings. He scanned every inch of Malfoy’s face when it turned to him. He looked younger. Strong. Harry couldn’t hide his interest. He felt starved for the sight.
They listened to the short tour, but skipped the walk through a narrow, crowded showroom to wander back to the bridge. Harry leaned against the railing. When Malfoy stepped beside him and crossed his arms over the edge of the suspension bridge, his arm rested near Harry’s. Together, they eyed the sea extending before them.
Except apparently, Potter had moved. The desert that enveloped him overflowed with dried brush and towering cacti, patches of small orange flowers and darker orange outcrops of stone. The mailbox had no box at all this time: just a sign that warned
“Harry, I’m so glad you’re home.” She opened her arms and he mirrored her immediately, pulling her close the moment she stepped up to him. He welcomed her familiar warmth, the calming patchouli scent she always had. He squeezed her tighter. As she cried into his shoulder, he looked around the room. The place was spotless, save a large half-full pitcher of some kind of purple drink. Some things were newly organized. Whatever it was, it had happened a few days ago. Hermione always scoured the condo when she was upset.
Malfoy continued, gathering steam: “Do you know how many people I sent that first memo to before I let it touch your desk? Everyone’s. Every Auror in that office got it first, and I just kept hoping that someone would take it seriously. That if I got through the program, didn’t make a fuss; if I never looked above my station or unrepentant; they’d look past the Malfoy name to my actions. But that’s not how this works. We can’t escape who we are. In that whole office, it had to be Harry Potter who finally saw my tip for what it was.”
“You working on something, Potter? Thought you didn’t bother with our home cases much anymore.”
“Oh yes, thanks for that by the way—not taking it.” They’d technically purchased the bed together, so she could have staked a claim. “I would have come today just to murder you.”
Draco approached, leaving some distance between them once he stopped. The apple fully peeled, Potter pulled it from the air and took a bite. Then he looked at Draco.
to set something up. Seemed more polite than telling them to get bent.
Years ago, she’d have called him on it, burning after the War with the conviction she’d never again let him pass things off as ‘fine’ when they were going to shit. Now, she’d have nodded, taken a seat, and dug into the platter herself. It was 2010, after all. They were thirty. Lots of things were going to shit.
“Auror Potter.”
They dropped in a windowless hall of beige tiles and walls. A large clock on the wall made the time difference clear. It was only a little after noon here. Malfoy staggered forward, having been off kilter by Harry’s pulling when the journey began. Harry caught him before he could hit the ground, and his fingers registered the softness of the jumper and warm body underneath. Malfoy’s eyes flashed when their gazes crossed again, and he pulled himself free of Harry’s grasp.
Harry began setting out the various treats first, buying time. He arranged the churros so they wouldn’t roll onto the table. "It’ll be three weeks, three days, including today."
“Never.” She turned her back to him, burying into the pillows. “Even if you’re the most stubborn person I know. Good night, Harry.”
Harry stared down at Malfoy’s hands. “‘Harry Potter’? I thought you didn’t see me like that.”
The conference tote hovered in his line of sight, and after a moment of debate, Harry picked that up as well. Might as well do some review while he was out.
“Thought it best to start on the right foot,” Harry said. He squeezed the cubicle wall with both hands now to keep them to himself. “You took the job. Robards didn’t tell me.”
Swallowing, Harry moved himself over to lean against the door jamb. Sound carried best there, the side with no hinges. If you knew what to listen for. And these hotel doors were so cheaply made. Harry closed his eyes and focused on his heart beating, letting it slow down, his growing unease melt away. Malfoy had to be doing something in there.
Harry looked at her. The lightness of her tone didn’t match her eyes, which avoided him. Ron’s remark about the Ministry suddenly lingered between them.
“And putting all their efforts into surviving, not poetry,” Harry guessed, following a seal that swam into their line of sight.
Harry leaned in a little further, ducking his head. “I didn’t know you’d quit. If I had realised it sooner—”
He turned his attention back to the passing water and trees beside them. “It’d be a lot steadier, that’s for sure.”
Harry didn’t bother finishing his next drink. He unwound his fingers from the leather strings they’d entangled in again and pressed his way along the crowd to the back patio. The lights glowed low. Harry could identify people more by the glowing cigarettes in their hands and mouths than the lights overhead. That darkness suited him. It only took a few moments’ effort to get a cigarette for himself. He blamed France for the urge. He’d gone again a few cases back. Too many weeks with lotharios at bars. He accepted a light, the place too crowded for a Lumos, and kept pressing through until he found a spot near the furthest corner of the patio. A few of the other conference attendees hovered closer to the entrance, but Harry focused upwards to avoid making contact.
Malfoy busied himself zipping up his jacket, cheeks flushed from the cool wind and (more likely) embarrassment.
“Come on, we can talk out here.”
His gaze stayed on the skyline while his hands plucked at a sleeve. Dave and Vickie called to them to join them, that they were going to grab some ice cream, but Harry waved them off.
Malfoy handed over his goods to the cashier. “No.” His gaze flickered over to Harry, his mouth going drawn. “I’m still in Wiltshire. Just not at the Manor. There was an old parsonage at the end of our land, past our stables. I made it one of my projects during my house arrest. After I got my N.E.W.T.S.”
“Haven’t you heard of knocking?”
“It was that game! Took all my adrenaline.”
“Speaking of the Ministry,” Hermione said quickly, catching Harry’s eye. “Now that you’re back and your case is done, I imagine you’ll have some more free time over the next couple of days.”
Hermione shook her head, her curls tickling at his cheeks. “You didn’t mean to. I mean, you were definitely avoiding everything—” He winced. ”But you’d never leave me alone on purpose. I know that. I just. Sometimes I can’t do this all by myself, and when Ron isn’t around, it feels strange to talk to Molly…”
The tightness in his stomach warmed at Harry’s expression. “As it should be," Harry said, his voice going lower as he shifted closer. "So... is this for me?” Harry snatched up the gold wrapped gift. Draco got a hand on it, but Harry was too fast and had already started to pull it into his chest.
She leaned back against the bar. “I see.” Oh, he certainly hoped she didn’t. “So what happened, you finally shag him?”
“Yeah.” Harry watched Malfoy put two sugars in his cup, then lean in toward him. He wondered if Malfoy had been aware of this morning’s accidental cuddling as well. Harry had definitely woken with his nose brushing the other’s hair, his breath very near that little collection of birthmarks again. He needed to speak with Robards about future rooming situations.
Harry stared at him, rapidly dissociating. "With Malfoy? You can’t be serious.”
Thirty minutes later, Harry convinced himself to walk through the lobby again. Malfoy’s table sat empty, and he had already split the bed by the time Harry stepped into their room. Harry felt the familiar tingling of a stare between his shoulders when he closed the curtains. He kept his gaze averted, waiting until the lights were off before he dared look over. Malfoy seemed fixated on the book in his hands, a small Lumos glowing on the pages from his wand. Malfoy’s head and shoulders emerged from under a much plumper cover set than the one on Harry’s own bed, and Malfoy’s robe covered his arms, the oversized collar curled around his throat. He seemed comfortable there—a stark contrast to the uneasy study he’d made downstairs.
“Before…” How to put it? The pressure of a knee against his own beneath a table. The weight of a stare over his form. A hug that lingered longer than usual.
“Piss off,” he said, kicking a practice bludger a bit further down the pitch. She put her hands on her hips.
"Impossible," Harry said, setting his box down on the island worktop and Accio'ing a few dishes from the cabinets. “‘Weasleys don’t cook for two.’ A wise woman said that once.”
“I would have found out anyway. His Department reports to mine as well, you know, when the tips are relevant to magical beasts.” Hermione watched Malfoy pick up his fallen items as she finished her yoghurt. He seemed small in his lavender jumper and brown trousers. “The Central Repository for Accurate and Probable Information.” She shook her head, nose scrunching. “Clever, but cruel.”
Malfoy let out a small huff and almost looked at him, then stared at their feet. “You are not what I would consider an academic, no.”
Didn't he see how impossible it was otherwise, whatever this thing was between them? If Harry'd thought of Ron from the start; or worse, their exchanges before and during the War? Insurmountable barriers. Surely Malfoy didn't really mean for Harry to face all that again. For the lines to be drawn always between them.
On Friday, before heading home, Harry had to stop back at his desk to pick up some of his other qualification materials for the interview in Spain. Definitely not to see if Malfoy was still in (he wasn’t).
“I’m not sure.” He shifted his weight, moving the box between his hands. “To be honest, I’m not feeling especially up for all the celebrations tonight. I think I wore myself out fighting the crowds.”
Draco huffed at his nerves and that damn confidence of Harry’s, reaching for a water biscuit. "Only to tell you off."
Malfoy stared down at the last few swigs of his glass, then tossed it back. “Sure. Yes, that would be fine. Get me another while you order?”
“I suppose.” Harry’s shoulders began to lower. “But you reviewed them, and you found something helpful. We solved the Milbourne matter. Should be starting the trial next month.”
“Then the thinking started to change. It wasn’t enough to torture wrongdoers. You had to reach their minds. Get them to internalise that sense of always being watched. And for most people, just the fear of being seen, of a neighbor catching and reporting you, is enough to keep them in line. That’s what this whole conference is about, you know. The next step. What happens when we are actually listening all the time. Whether we should be. Whether the lives we can save in doing so are worth it.”
But he’d known, hadn’t he? That something was off. Malfoy’d just made it so easy to ignore. He was quick with excuses.
“Oh, can they?” Hermione asked, pulling together the papers spread on the couch.
They fell quiet after that. When the bus parked in a lot, they kept pace with one another, a bit behind the group making its way to the worn lighthouse. It sat on a narrow and tall piece of land that right out to sea. The lighthouse itself was on the short and stout side, and to get there, they crossed a newer, studier looking suspension bridge. Below them, the waves crashed loudly against the rocks.
“Of course. I could tell from that,” the man’s fingers flickered here, “lyrical twang. Your names?”
“Not really. It’ll be nice to have those two gone from the bullpen. They drove me mad with how they’d talk over my head for ages.”
Telling her opened the box. Breathed life into the very things he’d keep at a distance. But the clock over her shoulder made clear that Harry was now almost an hour late. He might not show at all. And suffering, like wine, was better shared with friends. He’d already spent the past week in half a state of disbelief; that was admirable enough, and outside perspective could be helpful. He straightened his posture.
Harry stared at him, then nodded when Robards seemed to be waiting for some kind of acknowledgment.
“Right here?” Draco let one leg slide between Harry’s. “Or here?”
Harry stayed near the window for a while after Malfoy left, watching the sun set. The buildings blinked on like stars. They were built so close to the hotel, glass from floor to ceiling. If his gaze lingered, he discerned the colour schemes of living rooms; floral duvets in a darkly painted bedroom; children playing in a room with office and workout equipment. Beyond, the cloud cover over the Bay hid the supposed prison from view, but he could imagine it now: life a century before, the knowledge that out there, an unknown number of souls were confined. Azkaban seemed kinder by comparison. At least in the middle of a roaring sea, the prisoners were miles from any other signs of life. This island prison, though—the inmates had to have seen the city from their windows; known that only a mile or two away was freedom, a bustling world going on without them.
After a long breakfast and a Pepper Up potion, Draco rang his boss to request extra deliveries for the next two days. Policy dictated three consecutive delivery attempts before returning a package for nondelivery. It did not require that the package be the first one out.
“It should,” she said, pouring herself a cup. “It’s the coffee you brought back from your trip to Brazil.” They enjoyed the quiet for a few moments, caffeinating, while thumps sounded above them every once in a while. Teddy had the room directly overhead. With a sigh, Andromeda took the seat across from Harry.
Harry turned to him, green eyes visible now and piercing the sizable region of Draco’s chest that he’d occupied for days. “Oh.”
Eventually, she went back to collecting some of the other brooms. “You’re still single, I assume? Figure I’d have read about something by now, otherwise.”
He closed his eyes again, but it didn't stop the tears sliding from underneath his lashes and down his cheeks.
Draco gave him an almost normal looking smirk and left again.
Harry's voice had dropped so low that Hermione had to strain to hear it.
Draco sighed; he'd figured this was coming. He'd thought a lot about it, and still didn't have a good answer. That is, he had one, but he hated it – and knew Harry would too. But it was all he had.
"You really think so, sir? " Harry was hedging now, because he had no idea what Kingsley was getting at, and suspected the other man didn't either, and they were playing the same game. Harry had had enough sessions with the departmental psychwitch to know when he was walking into a trap. He didn't feel like playing today, though, so he nodded. "I guess you're right. So, am I to assume I'm being forcibly sent on vacation?"
The lights, as always, dimmed and condensed until a single ray of white light fell on Draco and Lucius as they began to twist and sway to their signature music. The audience was spellbound as they moved sinuously, nearly slithering around and over each other, until they were entwined in a human knot that had people gasping at the sheer flexibility of the human body. Holding this particular pose was tricky, and it frankly hurt, even when one was that limber, and as Draco flexed into his gravity-defying backbend, the audience applauded. Draco smiled and started to twist to stand upright – but couldn't move.
A pale brow shot up, and she laughed disbelievingly. "What do you think? No, I'm a debutante, trying to piss Mummy and Daddy off by being a whore. That will show them, goddammit."
Air cheek kissing followed and Draco winced inwardly. Snotty as hell though he might be (in Harry's words anyway) he hated places like this. He was aware that he was being sized up, and then a surprisingly strong hand gripped his. "Hullo, Draco! Pansy says we need to transform you." He looked him over. "Although I'm not entirely sure why - she was a bit vague on that point."
At the podium, Dumbledore looked over the grumbling crowd and sighed – every year it seemed like there were more personnel issues, more pay issues and more issues in general on the Tour. From a business standpoint, acquiring the rights to the Marvelous Malfoys made perfect sense; they were a proven draw, accomplished professionals and certain money-makers. And if they were uppity snots, well, those were the breaks and the show must go on.
The old whore had apparently decided that ripped stockings were not deal-breaker, as she had the same pair on as the night before. In fact, the entire outfit was the same, and sniffing her, Harry suspected that she'd not moved from this spot since their conversation yesterday.
Draco was silent for several moments – he would remember that moment for the rest of his life. Harry's voice had been so cool, so dismissive. "You took forever.”
"The rumors are true – as of tomorrow evening, the Tour will include the Marvelous Malfoys in all their splendor."
"Yes?" he managed to say, his voice husky; the glamour affected his voice as well.
"You were scared, and so you cheated on him."
He'd make his way to his couch, push off the accumulated debris of the night before, and pour a Scotch – he kept his bar needs on his coffee table, handily enough – and flip on the telly.
"No - why, was one of your escorts supposed to call? Do they miss you? Are you funding their gym memberships?"
Harry smiled his thanks and pulled out the chair next to him. Draco sat down with his vodka, trying not to get too close, trying not to act like himself. "Like to dance, huh?" he managed, taking a sip of alcohol immediately.
She rolled her eyes and turned her attention to Charlie's spangles. "Dear, you'll look like a, a…"
Grumbling ensued but the steps shuffled away. Harry lifted his head from Draco's shoulder and turned his face to brush his lips over Draco's cheek. "Let's go home."
Harry wasn't sure what he was supposed to know – Hermione hadn't briefed him on that subject lately. As the Deputy Minister of Magic, she saw fit to shoot him priority information about his job, reputation and personal life a couple of times a week, knowing full well that he didn't pay attention to any of it. Lately, she'd been slacking off, but then again, it was an election year, so Harry let it go.
Harry stared in the mirror when he was finally allowed to look; he was glad he'd worn his contacts and not his glasses, inexplicably cool though they now were. Though skeptical at first, he had to admit that the burgundy tones looked good, almost purplish -  they set off the black of his hair well. Well, what was left of it at any rate; most of his hair was being swept up, the remainder gelled into soft spikes. He looked like a character from Bleach, an anime show he'd gotten Draco hooked on. They'd always watched it weeknights together before bed, before Draco had…
"Isn't it?" Charlie looked over his shoulder and admired how the satin clung in all the right places.
"Potter, O'Sullivan is a fictional character," said Draco through gritted teeth. "A drunken, whorish fictional character at that. We are not putting you in a position to get mauled, fried or bent beyond repair."
"Who?" Draco looked up at him and for once, didn't argue the point. Harry shook his head. "You'll know if I'm right in a few minutes."
"Did you forget something?"
"Uhm, yeah." Draco looked up at Harry and a wave of longing washed over him so strongly that he was glad he was still sitting; he might have fallen to his knees and begged the other man to take him back otherwise.
"Leave me alone, please, I can't" Draco said looking away
"I love you too Draco" Harry smiled, their lips connected once more, Harry pushed Draco towards a desk, making sure Draco can feel his erection, Draco moaned.
"What's his problem?" Ron asked as Harry walked up too them
"There is nothing wrong with kissing boys Draco" Harry replied as he moved closer
<p>"Dray...I promise they won't tell anyone" Harry smiled</p>
<p>"Holy fuck, this is beautiful..." Draco smiled</p>
<p>In the Slytherin Common room none of Draco's friends waited forhim which is good, so he easily snuck in and went to bed.
<p>"How are you sure?" Draco asked</p>
<p>"No fair" Draco huffed</p>
<p>"Yeah, Versing each other like old times" Draco chuckled</p>
<p>"That was the point, hold on tight" Harry replied as he flew over the Black Lake.</p>
<p>"Professor, I need to be excused" Draco said as he put his hand up</p>
<p>"I heard enough to figure out why you were late"</p>
"You're bleeding" Harry replied as he walked towards the troubled blonde, knowing that Draco had cut himself by seeing the cuts.
"Malfoy?" He asked concerned
Draco had to stop and think, should he admit his feeling towards Harry or not, it's not like anyone would find out right?
<p>"Sorry Professor" Draco whispered as he sat next to Blaise</p>
"Whose problem?"
<p>"Bloody hell, this fucking stinks of hair gel, cologne and apples!" Harry cringed</p>
<p>"I was right!?" Ginny smiled</p>
<p>"What you did with Blaise was the right thing, and I understand completely, don't worry Dray" Harry smiled</p>
<p>"Fuck off!" Draco yelled as he stormed out of the Common Room and out into the Castle, he bumped into Ron and Hermione</p>
<p>"Please don't tell anyone" Draco asked</p>
"Well boyfriend, our friends would be wondering where we are" Draco sighed smiling
<p>"I told you Mione" Ron replied</p>
"Draco, shit"
<p>"Cool"</p>
<p>"Yeah...that's mostly the reason, why I'm scared that my parents will find out" Draco sighed</p>
<p>"We have Potion's first" Mione nodded</p>
<p>"What do I get in return?"</p>
<p>"How long?" Hermione asked</p>
<p>"Yes, I do" Harry replied</p>
<p>"Not planning on it" Harry replied as he gripped Draco's blonde hair and yanked on it, making a gutteral moan leave Draco's throat.</p>
<p>"No, You uniform is all messy, your fly is undone and you reek" Hermione replied raising an eyebrow.</p>
"Bye mother, bye father" Draco nodded and he boarded the train with Pansy and Blaise.
<p>Harry slowly pushed inside Draco, feeling his cock fully engulfed in Draco's hole, Draco moaned loudly. Harry had to stay still for a minute to gain control, he slowly started to thrust, he hastily slipped out causing the bottom to groan. He slowly pushed in again and got his rythmn back.</p>
<p>"He was a dumbass"</p>
<p>"Fuck..." Draco sighed</p>
"Draco you feel so good" Harry said as his rythmn got faster and harder
<p>"Holy fuck Dray" Harry said cupping Draco's cheek</p>
<p>"Mmmm"</p>
<p>"Morning Ron" Harry smiled</p>
<p>"Too bad" Harry smirked</p>
<p>"Everyone is going to know now!" Draco exclaimed</p>
<p>"Positive" Harry replied</p>
<p>"Come on then" Harry smirked as he dragged Draco up the stairs</p>
<p>"What...?" She ased nervously, Harry took huge breath and sighed</p>
<p>Draco headed to his Common Room, he said the password and walked in completely ignoring everything that was happening around him.</p>
<p>"Yes...Dean, Ginny and Seamus found out but they aren't too fussed about it" Harry nodded</p>
<p>"Well we're out of Potions you wanna shag?"</p>
<p>"Fuck me hard and fast" Draco begged</p>
<p>"Snape is your Godfather?!?" Harry replied shocked</p>
"Can't what?" Harry asked concerned
"Harry ah fuck"
"We can talk about that later...I want you" Draco said sitting up
<p>"Don't be fucking rediculous Ginny, Harry isn't gay and even if he was he wouldn't touch Malfoy" Ron replied</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" Hermione asked</p>
<p>"I know you would..."</p>
<p>"Mmm" Draco moaned as Harry moved down to Draco's pale neck and started to bite and suck on it, making sure he bruised Draco.</p>
"FUCKING POUND ME" Draco screamed
<p>"Oh really?" Draco questioned</p>
"You have no idea how long I wanted to tell you I loved you" Harry whispered
<p>"AH, FUCK LOVE YOU TOO!" Draco exlaimed loudly</p>
<p>"WHAT THE FUCK?!?" Ron screamed and the couple shot apart</p>
"Alright Harry" Draco nodded
<p>During breakfast Draco and Harry snuck off to make-out, they were in a broom closet close to the Great Hall.</p>
"Yes?" Harry replied as Draco was centermetres away from Harry's lips
"My parents, didn't take me coming out well..." Draco said as he got dressed
"You won't" Draco smiled, Harry nodded and took off his shirt, and undid his pants, they dropped down to Harry's ankles.
<p>"Harry it's all good and Ron and I don't think less of you" she smiled</p>
"Har-Potter please" Draco said as his voice broke
"The kiss...what was that?"
"I've been raised that being gay is wrong, disgusting, so I've been so scared to come out and when I did...I-I" Draco choked
<p>"Mione, I've got something to tell you"</p>
"I love you" Draco replied as he cupped Harry's chin
<p>"Yes...now I've got to find him" Harry replied as he pulled up his pants</p>
"You okay mate?" Ron asked with his mouth full
"Draco" Harry gasped as he stumbled away
"Malfoy, can we talk?" Harry asked smiling slightly
<p>"I guess so" Draco replied as he bend over and held the bedhead</p>
"Me too" Draco whispered back, Harry ripped open Draco's shirt revealing his bruised skinny body
<p>"Oh no..." Harry said trailing off</p>
"Draco...you kissed me, don't deny it please"
"P-promise?" Draco asked
"I-I can't" Draco sobbed as he started to walk away he pushed past Ron and Hermione
<p>"You know Gryffindor is versing Slytherin this weekend"</p>
<p>"Lockhart fucked my arm"</p>
<p>"How can you like me? I'm severely scarred, I'm way too skinny and-"</p>
<p>"Fucking hell" Draco replied</p>
<p>"Are you training for the ballet Potter" Draco chuckled as he shook his head</p>
<p>"Oh fuck" Draco swore</p>
<p>"Why was Malfoy running out of the Common Room half naked?" Seamus asked as he walked in with Dean and Ginny</p>
"Are you okay Draco?" Pansy asked as she put her arm on his wrist, Draco winced slightly and pulled his arm away.
<p>"Accio lube" Draco casted and the lube flew to him</p>
<p> </p>
"I'm gay Ron..." Harry admitted</p>
"I'm fine, excuse me I need the lavatory" Draco replied as he got up quickly leaving Pansy and Blaise confused.
<p>"Why Mr. Malfoy?" Snape asked</p>
<p>"Harry it's a love potion, what ever you smell is your soulmate smells like" Hermione replied and Harry and Draco's eyes widened</p>
<p>"Yes, but he's more that people think Ron, he was going to apologise when he had the chance" Harry replied</p>
<p>"Thanks guys" Harry smiled</p>
<p>"DRAY FUCK I LOVE YOU!" Harry screamed</p>
Draco, Pansy and Blaise sat in their usual spot at the back, Pansy and Blaise looked at eachother and back at Draco.
When Harry had exited the Great Hall he pulled the Maruders Map to try and find Draco and he did, So he walked towards where Draco was.
<p>"Hospital wing, Not feeling well" Harry lied</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Harry asked as he fixed himself</p>
"We better go, our friends would be wondering where we are" Draco coughed
"Malf-" Harry was about to say but was cut off by Draco kissing him, Harry's eyes close ashe kissed back, Draco pulled away blushing.
<p>"You do know what Amortentia is right?" Hermione asked</p>
<p>"No, it stinks of fresh parchment, aftershave and chocolate" Draco complained</p>
"Draco, your body"
<p>"Yes, I'm fine" Draco lied...to be honest he was scared, scared that his relationship with Harry would get back to his father...</p>
"B-boyfriend?"
<p>"Maybe, I guess you have to find out" Harry replied smirking</p>
Draco looks away. “I lied.”
in that peculiar tone of mild curiosity coupled with a total lack of feeling that Harry has definitely inherited.
“I know what I said,” Ginny interrupts angrily. “Trust me.”
Ron’s imagination begins to wander despite wanting to have some space from Lavender’s insistent and adoring presence. It’s as if one part of his brain goes hazy and lulled by her pink lipstick, that almost sickly sweet perfume, and those soft, dainty hands, while another part feels almost nauseous with her arms around him, hearing her say his name in that baby voice, and knowing deep down that this relationship was built more on frenzied hormones than a solid, loving foundation.
His cheeks flush, and he acts as if he has no idea how he wound up in this position, with Draco holding down his wrists, straddling his waist, Harry’s mouth open, barely responding, so that Draco has easy access, nearly devouring him.
“Spoken like a true Slytherin,” Draco says not without sarcasm.
“I believe you have something of mine,” Harry says, still smiling that perfect charming smile. Hermione watches the scene in fascination, this upside down world of two former schoolboy rivals interacting years later, and it's like every color has switched and the ground has become the sky.
“You could reward him?”
“Yes,” Harry said, too quickly, “I mean, sure. I suppose.”
“I never wanted to hurt you.”
Pansy and Harry share a look, which Draco notices with a frown.
This someone won’t be in London until Christmas.
Some things, though, have undeniably changed. They are no longer the young hopeful sixteen year old boys they once were, dreaming of an impossible love story, and instead finding only a brutal, bloody war to greet them.
Ron looks wildly after him, and younger Hermione’s brows furrow.
Harry doesn’t speak. He looks down at his hands, which twist together.
“It’s true,” Draco said with a shrug. Harry wanted to argue that
He looks up. Draco’s eyes plead with him. His hand reaches out and takes Harry’s, who does not resist, but does not reciprocate, not at first.
This truce they had between them, a momentary peace where they could forget their past mistakes, their past betrayals and past losses. Harry had known his time with Draco was short, so preciously short.
“You sound surprised,” Draco says, smiling.
“Do not judge him so harshly,” Mr Weasley says wisely, his eyes clouded. “After all, the Wizengamot has already done so.”
Draco goes pale, and his voice is terse. “Pardon?”
But he didn’t say that. He simply watched the storm wreck everything he ever loved. It was easier, to let the pain sink into his skin like small daggers of glass.
“Yes—well, no.” Harry’s face suddenly feels hot. “But we’re friends.”
“That’s fine,” Hermione says, holding out the parcel. “You can hold onto it tonight.”
He sees Pansy move out of the corner of his eyes. She has her robe on, and she walks mechanically to the kitchen, perhaps for a glass of water. Harry’s stomach tenses anxiously. Draco shakes his head, as if to advise him to leave her alone.
“I don’t know if I can,” Harry whispers, so softly she can barely hear. “I just don’t know if I can.”
Ron has little Rose in his arms, chatting amiably with someone in dark robes and gleaming white blonde hair. Draco turns and smiles at Hermione, before noticing Harry behind her and going pale.
Dean flashes her one last easy, sated smile before she creeps out of his four-poster bed, the curtains ruffling softly as she passes them.
* * *
Her door opens, and Draco stands on the threshold. He looks at her, full of pity, maybe resentment, and she despises him even more.
“I was thinking more along the lines of thanking him,” Hermione says with that indignance that Pansy has always admired from afar. “Do you have any suggestions?”
Draco took a deep breath. "Will you excuse me a moment?"
“Oh! I'm Harry. Harry Potter. I work at The Magical Mystery Tour, and I was out here waiting for you. I'm sure Dumbledore will want to see you, so I can take you there and then take your luggage to the guest tent."
“I do mean it, and this isn’t guilt – well, not entirely. I realized tonight that I take you for granted, because you never let me down. And instead of being grateful and happy that you love me enough to do everything for me, I took it as my due. And that’s wrong. I’m the lucky one here, not you. You got no bargain with me. But I’m going to change that.”
Many considered the Malfoys pompous and entitled, and many more regarded them with deep suspicion – no two men could be that pretty. It just was not natural to be that blond, that grey-eyed, have noses that straight or lips that pouty. It had to be a glamour, and if there was anything the family looked down on, it was artifice. In the family's opinion, if you were pretty, you were lucky and if you were ugly? You dealt with it and moved on. That was the way it was done.
Paul sighed. "Nothing; I don't charge clients who are unsatisfied with the result."
"Oh, that," said Harry calmly, sipping his coffee. "I was tired and you took forever."
He hated his conscience almost as much as Draco hated his own.
The animal froze and landed with a thump just a foot or two the side of Draco, its mouth gaping open, showing rows of razor-sharp teeth, its horns ripping a large tear in the cloth of the tent.
“Yeah?”
"Merlin, yes!"
"I'm glad you asked. Do you have your wand? Is that it in your pocket?"
&  &  &
"You want boobs, go for one of those cows down the street, like the ones you were talking to when I came back out. They're just overrated gobs of flesh. I can offer you so much more, Just Harry." Darcy smiled seductively, then stood up, pushing down the strap of his chemise.
"Charlie, there couldn't be a reward great enough to justify that." Harry shuddered and proceeded to take off his clothes. Someone was always naked at the Weasleys. Charlie watched him with brotherly approval. At least, Harry hoped it was just brotherly approval; he liked Charlie just fine, but his heart belonged to a snooty blond. He sighed. Charlie grinned.
Now Darcy raised a brow. "Is that a problem? The way I see it, I have a great body, talented mouth and a hole to stick your dick into, so really, what's the difference between me and a female?"
& & &
Harry watched him from underneath his fringe, which devoid of gel tonight, brushed nearly against his eyebrows. He didn't say anything, just rubbed his thumb over a worn spot on the wood table between them.
Draco woke to see Harry already dressed, and putting on his shoes. "Whatcha doin?" he asked, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and yawning.
The Weasleys, being the closest to the actual flames were able to open the release panels and access the emergency ropes to slide out of the tent, the better to pull people out the front and back exits. On the floor, Harry and the twins worked to corral the people into some sort of line to usher them out, but the fire was spreading fast and they had to settle for just shoving people out. Percy and Hagrid had their hands full with the panicked animals, and soon despite all efforts, it was complete pandemonium. In the melee, Harry looked for Draco, but didn't see him; he fervently hoped he'd made it out okay.
"Harry, honestly – you told her no, she asked you to move on so she could hook someone else for the night – pardon the expression – and now you're all upset? Maybe you should spend your vacation on a couch, with a good therapist about three feet away."
And he was going to be here. Here at The Magical Mystery Tour, in the ring, in the spotlight! All of him in that tight white costume, or maybe the silver one with the rings or the black one…oh Merlin, the black one with the sides held together with thin silver cords ... Harry sighed and lay back on his pillow, taking matters in hand.
Harry laughed and kissed him back.
That last sounded good to him, frankly.
He spent the greater part of the day exploring other parts of the city, and taking pictures, which he loved doing, and was actually very good at. He preferred Muggle cameras, liked capturing things at a certain moment in time, freezing it. He took photos of buildings, of landmarks, and most often, of people. People were endlessly fascinating in the range of expressions they showed, and for whatever reason, Harry seemed to be able to capture ones that were perhaps best hidden; Harry didn't mind waiting and waiting till the perfect moment presented itself. It made for some memorable images.
"Ewww, no, Polyjuice is weak, and it doesn't last unless you slug it down constantly, plus, it's disgusting." Blaise wrinkled his nose. "No, I was thinking, you could change the way you look, a few cosmetic alterations and maybe a glamour for some of the facial features, cause frankly, they are pretty distinctive, and Potter is no fool."
"He's straight, I checked. Now up! Draco's going to need moral support. Come on." She tugged on Draco's arm and he blinked. "Moral support?"
"That's what people say," Harry replied, thinking that the special he was referring to was a mite different then what Darcy probably meant, but whatever.
The owner of that arse was inspecting his fingernails and doing idle toe lifts. "Do stop fidgeting, Draco," hissed Lucius from his perfectly posed spot beside him. "We are role models and to be envied."
"Our war?"
The show that night was nothing short of spectacular.
"Fine." There was a long pause. "How is Zurich?" asked Harry, just to fill the silence.
Draco was shaking now, all over, not just his hands. "I said I was sorry. I told you I was scared. Shit reason or no, it's the truth. Nothing, nothing Aaron…I…said was a lie. When he said he loved his boy, he did, and he does, more than anything else in this world. Life is nothing without his boy. When he said he'd been miserable and that it was his own bloody fault, he meant it. When he told you it wasn't you, it was his own fucking stupid scared self, he meant it. If you can't or won't see that, Harry; that I love you and there is nothing else for me than you, then there isn't anything more I can do. I just can’t.”
After he'd finished his morning ablutions such as they were, he would wander out to his tiny kitchen which adjoined his tiny living room, and root around in the icebox, eating whatever he found that didn't seem liable to bite him back. Often, his breakfast consisted of sweet pickles and a slice or six of processed cheese. It was enough for the first scotch to grab onto and kept him from vomiting, and that's all Harry really asked from anything animal, vegetable, or mineral these days.
"Okay, if you're sure?”
Ever.
“I’m sure – most people still are. They can’t believe you put up with me.” He paused. “Hell, I can’t believe you put up with me.”
Draco Malfoy, too, woke around noon, or later – usually much later – squinted against the light, debated getting out of bed, and started his day with an alcoholic drink of some sort and a Parliament, usually lit and dragged upon before he had even crawled out of bed.
&  & &
The girl looked as shocked as he felt, and for a moment, Harry fancied he saw a brief shadow, a fleeting expression of disappointment – maybe anger – cross that pretty face, but when he blinked and refocused, all that was there was a bored curl of the lip.
“Me either.”
"Are we - are we going to work this out? Are we going to be all right?"
"Shut up you pervert – Harry's not interested." Ginny linked her arm possessively through Harry's, pushing her hand down into his pocket. She was now forced to actually dip her face into her popcorn – extra butter – to eat, since her hands were full.
Draco closed his eyes tightly; the pain he felt and that seeped through the cracks in his demeanor was almost too much to bear, but he had to bear it. He had caused this; him and him alone. "Harry, I'm sorry," he whispered. "I really and truly am. You aren't a diversion - you're everything."
"Sorry," Harry mumbled, embarrassed. Across from him, Ginny was smirking and he fought the urge to hex her. And Christ, it was sprinkling rain and she was still wearing those stupid sandals with the heels. He hoped she fell off them, flat on her fat little face.
"Oh, too bad, but I'm sure you'll find something or someone to do. Have a good one, Draco, okay?"
"That's not the point, 'Arry," Hagrid grumbled. "The point is that these poor creatures are caged and kept captive an' they were never s'posed to be. Now, here, looka this one. Bobo was meant to roam free, if 'eva an animal was. Weren't you, Bobo? Ain't he a beautiful creature, 'Arry?" Harry looked at Bobo doubtfully; a dwarf pigbear wasn't HIS idea of beauty, but it was all in the eye of the beholder as they said. "If you say so, Hagrid."
While still scorning most things Muggle, Draco had developed what Harry thought was a rather disturbing attachment to information technology, but every time he started to harass Draco over it, he would be forced to admit that he loved the laptop Hermione had gotten him for his birthday and would settle for rolling his eyes as Draco demanded that Harry come peruse his latest E-Bay purchase.
After an hour or so of aimless wandering, he found a small coffee shop that sold both excellent, thick coffee – on purpose, and not because it had been left too long on the burner – as well as other herbal necessities, and settled in for an hour or three, making conversation with a few pretty girls. Harry had found that a little weed always helped things along for him socially, and now was no exception.
He thought about himself, how angry he'd been and still was, how hurt and afraid he'd been when he saw that same number, over and over again. How he'd deliberately set out to change everything Draco knew of him, everything he knew of himself as well. He thought about coming home, being in the same bed and not being able to reach out and touch; how just the sight of Draco on his desktop computer made him want to Incendio the whole setup. He thought about going to bed alone, or worse, with someone he never wanted to see again, and waking up alone.
The sharp crack of apparition echoed throughout the flat, and Harry, upstairs in the loo, shivered when he heard it.
Aaron was an excellent dancer; he moved with a lot of grace and obviously enjoyed it. Harry's smile at him was shadowed by memories of Draco on the dance floor – another man who loved to dance and was very good at it. He found himself wondering what Draco was doing right now, and with whom. Harry might look different, act somewhat different, but his thought process had not changed, nor had his complete inability to keep his thoughts from being plainly evident on his face; Draco could read his mind, almost. Being almost painfully glad that Harry still thought of him at all was tempered by the extreme irony of the situation.
"Do they always gripe like that? " Draco's voice was a loud whisper and several of the clowns glared at him. He stared them down, until they tossed their rainbow wigs and looked away.
"Like the thing to do at the time, sure. I understand Draco, told you I did. You wanted more and wanted it right then. And fuck, you can ring up for this - brilliant marketing, genius, really." Harry smiled and went to pull his hair out of the collar out of habit, looking momentarily confused. "Oh, right, don't need to do that anymore. Phantom hair syndrome, it seems.”
"Gorgeous." Harry was checking his ass out in the full-length mirror, flexing the cheeks. "I have an amazing ass – maybe I should just walk around backwards in chaps or something."
"Ah, just smoking too much, I suppose, and haven't had my coffee yet."
He stopped; Harry was staring at him. "How would you even begin to know all this?"
"Fuck. I knew you'd say that."
"I know, and I need you too."
to him!
Pansy and Blaise exchanged looks, including one raised eyebrow. "What's he done, Draco?"
"Sure he's not. Harry isn't interested at all." Charlie nodded knowingly and glanced down at Harry's jumpsuit; Ginny's gaze followed and she nearly choked, tearing her hand out of his pocket and spilling her popcorn everywhere and driving the nearby leopard-spotted monkeys wild. Fortunately, the performance ended before the monkeys could create total chaos. Ginny glared at Harry. "How could you like him?" She hissed.
He dreaded it with every fiber of his being.
Harry got up and used the loo, taking a cursory glance in the mirror; his skin looked a little pale and he looked like he hadn't slept well, which he hadn't, because Draco wasn't there. Even angry, even jealous and hateful, whatever the emotion they were embroiled in at the time, as long as he was in the bed, Harry would sleep. And more often than not, when he awoke, those cool grey eyes would be watching him and if he turned and smiled at Draco, and reached out to stroke his cheek, the eyes would grow warm and he would open his arms to Harry who would willingly crawl into them. Because Draco was his home, no matter where he was.
"Back again? You are an ardent one, aren't you?"
During this performance, Ginny and Charlie had noiselessly slipped down to watch on the same level and now flanked Harry. "Whoa," whispered Charlie. "Now that? That is talent. I wonder what he can do in…"
Draco let himself be pulled along -  thinking of Harry not wanting to be near him had sobered him entirely and he felt nothing but sad now. He vaguely heard Pansy and Paul discussing him. "Well, he can't be a blond, it’s too noticeable, at least not that shade; Harry always did like blonds though.”
"Yes, well, I sound that way a lot. So, like, another week or so? Before you're back?" He tried to keep his voice neutral.
"Oh, yeah, guess you are, at that.”
After kitty-petting came the ritualistic moaning and whining as he forced himself to stand up and take the four long steps to the loo, where he sat down on the toilet with his head in his hands – his ability to aim had been shot a long time ago, along with his sense of self, sense of purpose and ability to balance his checkbook – and propped his chin up on his hand, closing his eyes again. He did all his deep thinking in that pose. First, it was second nature to him by now, and secondly, it was really the only time in any 24-hour period that he was reasonably sober.
"Virile," added Harry. He just liked the word.
He stood back in the shadows, Hagrid grumbling beside him. "It ain't right, Albus. You know them bears are surly for sure and getting' worse every day. T'day one of 'em took a dump right on poor 'Arry's foot and…"
"It was my pleasure." Draco paused. "Uh, maybe we could have dinner or just drinks if you prefer, sometime this weekend?"
“I love you.” Harry’s whisper was only for him.
Harry was still smarting over the very idea that he could be sexually inadequate. "I'm sure Management would." He dragged his suitcase over to the elevators and waited alongside what looked to be a professional party person, complete with way too much makeup and conversely, far too little clothing – not that Harry was complaining. He did love sightseeing.
"You choose to fixate on the oddest things, Malfoy, seriously." Nevertheless, Harry arched his head into Draco's hand, encouraging him to pet him; Draco smirked and twisted his fingers into it, then yawned.
"So how is the fantabulously hot Draco Malfoy? You stuck to him like Ginny to a caramel apple all afternoon."
The lights stayed off that night and the man on the couch scarcely moved.
"Touch myself?" Darcy smiled sweetly as Harry turned pink.
"I had tea and scones with Father in our tent, yes. I did pass by the eating tent, but the smells made me wonder if someone was roasting a gross of newts."
Harry moved to the hearth and took her hand, feeling her squeeze it from her office in London.
"You smell it too? Good, I'm not going insane."
Ooooh, Potter, wrong answer. Dammit, he'd never been good at open-ended questions; he was much more of a yes or no type of bloke.
And when the light changed from gold to black, he got dressed and went looking for Harry.
She shrugged. "Uw knap verlies."
Harry stopped. "I don't know, Draco. Maybe there isn't, finally, anything to say."
"Love you too, and thanks for the advice.” He walked in front of the fire and Hermione shrieked, "HARRY!" But before he could say anything else, Hermione was gone, and a naked, thoughtful Harry was left alone to ponder.
When he would wake, he would smile at Draco – odd in itself because Harry was by no means a morning person – and lean over to kiss him on the cheek. If miraculously, he kissed him on the lips, it was brief, and if Draco tried to reach for him, pull him down, Harry might let him. Or might not; it seemed to depend on nothing in particular.
She shrugged. "This seems to work better, for some odd reason. Wonderful stuff. I had another tube, but I cannot seem to locate it. Pity. I shall have to make a trip to town one day to get more. I do love Muggle towns. Have either one of you ever eaten at Burger King? Their double Whoppers are simply to die for."
Once packed, he broke out the last of his stash of 'substance.'
For the rest of the show, Harry felt rooted in place, his stomach flipping and twisting like an aerialist's antics. And like them, he had no net, nothing to catch him when he fell.
"You haven't answered my question, Potter. Why are you here?"
He'd sounded so broken and his eyes had been shiny and hot, brimming with the same heavy tears that threatened his own right now.
Harry might not be at the top of his game, Auror-wise these days, but when something tickled at the edges of his mind, he listened. His actions might be a tad unorthodox but his instincts were rarely wrong. And somehow, something here felt odd, off. He studied her for a long moment, until she shifted under his gaze and looked down, then back up through heavy black lashes. "All right, lover, are we doing this tonight, or not?"
Draco looked up from the tumbler he'd set down. "Why?"
Draco.
Blaise took the nearly gone cigarette from Draco's fingers and finished it again. "What were you looking for on www.comeandgetit.com? A book club partner?"
Draco nodded and stood up, taking a deep breath. Pansy stood too and slid her arms around Draco's waist, hugging him briefly. "Good luck honey."
"Will I?" Harry needed, wanted to be sure that somehow, he had not ruined Draco's life -that had never been his intention. Not ever.
He woke somewhere between noon and three, depending on how drunk he'd been the night before, and how long he'd stayed up before passing out. It varied, though two AM was a pretty good bet. Not bad for someone who started in with the scotch at noon on the dot each day. He'd tried drinking before noon just once, his rationalization being that it was already noon
"What about my files? My open cases?"
"Both of us?" Blaise sighed. "I was planning on getting pleasantly sloshed and chatting up the bartender."
& & &
"Mine too; I make my own treats, however, so I can be sure of quality ingredients, baking being much more fun than plain old cooking."
"Ah, well, what can you expect from a woman? Overemotional to the extreme, prone to throwing things, jealous, hormonally unbalanced…"
"Goede Avond," he said softly, and the eyes caught his, and held.
Blaise snorted in the corner but said nothing. Draco sighed. "I want to find Harry, yes, more than anything. But I don't see the point of this. If I pick him up, so to speak, he will eventually figure out it's me and be totally pissed off that I resorted to less than honest means to find him."
"Good idea."
No one settled down.
If he did; Draco felt like he knew Harry better now than he ever had, and knew himself even better. But what if it still wasn't enough?
"I missed you." The words were muffled, but they went straight to Draco's heart.
"The sacrifices one makes for love, Malfoy. You do look incredible though; the darker color suits you, makes your eyes 'pop' more."
"It's all right," replied Draco a little uncomfortably. "I'm used to people thinking I'm hot."
Harry held the door open for him and they went into the pub, securing a corner booth. The interior was busy but not noisy, and the lights were low, the globes hanging over the tables dimmed for intimacy. They sat across from each other and ordered the house ale, sipping almost in tandem before setting them down and smiling at each other. "Thanks for meeting me here," said Draco quietly. "It's nice to not have to scream to be heard."
& & &
“Harry…” he felt panic rising in him. “You don’t need to make a statement. I understand, I will change, you just need to give me the chance.”
The only thing that would be enough, in the end, was he, himself, being able to open up and show Harry how much he truly did love him.
Draco turned and moved blindly to the hall and the door, not even stopping for a jacket even though it was late November and snow was threatening the air. He pushed open the door and left the flat, stumbling blindly down the street.
There were some beautiful men in London, but none of them were Harry Potter.
Dumbledore spent the entire next day questioning people, asking them if they had seen or sensed anything, and if so, would they describe what it had been. He got a lot of nonsensical answers and a few worth thinking over, which was about what he had expected. Harry didn't mention the footprint he'd found, but wasn't quite sure why he didn't, except that he had a feeling it would be important somewhere down the road. A new big-top tent was procured, and the elder wizards all participated in raising it and casting a host of protective spells on it; this time, a handful of others were granted access to the wards inside the tent, to ostensibly prevent such a disaster from ever happening again.
& & &
& & &
"Just had a couple of questions for you," replied Harry, his voice even and low with great effort. "Did you pick a new one every time? Or did you find a favorite? Or a couple of them? Did you measure their cocks first to make sure that numbers didn't lie or did you just take their word for it?"
"How did you, of all people, ever wind up in a Muggle glam band?" Harry's voice was raspy, as though he didn't use it much. "No one except your psychotic mentor hated Muggles more than you."
"Not really, but it doesn't matter what I think. So do you like your new tent?"
"Ah, glad it's not just me. Sometimes I'm sure I'm the only one who listens to me." Harry gave him a smile just as an attractive blond man came up to Harry and smiled at him.
Normally, Harry would have saved showering until after his nightly volley through the air, but Draco's comments about bear shit stung, and about a half hour before the evening's performance, he snuck into the family tent to wash up and was greeted by a naked Charlie Weasley, who was, he said, "performing a little personal maintenance." To Harry, it just looked painful – if someone had spread hot wax on his nether regions and then yanked it off, his screams would have been heard in Third World countries. Charlie, however, was nonplussed. "Beauty isn't easy, Harry," he said, calmly ripping a strip off a place that made Harry go pale. "But the rewards are great."
Draco shook his head, staring into his ale. "He doesn't seem to want to, no. But I…I mean, I'm the bastard in the relationship. Always have been, and why the fuck he even puts up with me is something I've puzzled over for years and years. But I think of how much I'm hurting over this and it amazes me that he doesn't seem to be hurting at all. And I wonder if he does love me. Maybe he never did. But dammit, I know that's not true either. Har…" He stopped, horrified and coughed to cover the slip. "Uhm," he scrambled for some Muggle name, "Henry isn't fake, ever. He doesn't lie, he doesn't pretend, so I don't know why this isn't affecting him."
"Four years ago, give or take. Is it obvious?" His tone was a mix of tired and sarcastic. "And you’re horrified, right?”
He looked at his nails, admiring the pearly white polish, then back at Harry. "Kinky shit is extra, and I am never – and I do repeat, never – the sub. I'll talk dirty for free, again, if I like you. You seem like a nice enough bloke, and rather cute, so I'm inclined to be kind. I tell you when we're done, and when I say go, you go, all nice and well-behaved. Understand?"
Harry usually didn't like to be ordered to do anything – in his mind, he'd already spent a lifetime taking orders and doing what everyone else wanted, so when he was sitting in Shacklebolt's office, fidgeting on the worn velvet chair and lacing and unlacing his fingers, he was already on edge.
"Yes, it should be ready, let me look." He wiped a thick strand with a tissue. "All right, come back here and we'll get you set up."
"Millions, not thousands," Draco corrected him, flicking ash onto the pavement. "We have fans across the globe, not just Britain. And as to how I got here?" He shrugged and took a last drag before grinding the butt out under his heel. "Not so differently from you, Potter – the Ministry wanted to punish all of us purebloods, so they attempted to shove us down into little pigeonholes, doing jobs that wouldn't challenge a house-elf. I wasn't having any of that, so I decided to check out Muggle society."
"Yes, please," said Harry, relieved. "I'm afraid I might ask you for a stuffed Cornish Game Hen or the latest score for Manchester United if I tried to speak Dutch."
All his own 'boys' were blonds, without exception; he'd become known for it. And no matter what they wanted, he never gave them his name, never kissed them on the lips, and never let them do more than blow him, and it had taken him more than a month to let that happen.
“Most likely - either there or getting drunk. Knowing Potter, I expect he’d consider paying his respects to his beloved godfather while arseholed a travesty so it stands to reason he went there first. And I do hate it when you call me “Sev.” Its undignified.”
The next day was an 'in-between' day; a day for the performers to rest, try out any new tricks or routines, or just socialize. While Harry loved the show nights, he also liked these days, as it allowed him to check in with everyone, hear the gossip, smooth any ruffled feathers; he was good at that, and Dumbledore encouraged it because no one ever got angry with Harry.
"Just - just try to go in with an open mind, and heart, if you can, and listen to him. You're an excellent listener. I suspect that you might be surprised by what he has to say."
Draco gave him a sideways glance. "Doesn't look like you eat much."
"That would be nice; I'd like that. We could speak without yelling."
"Hi, brought you a drink." Draco set it down on the table, careful to not touch Harry.
"All right - till Saturday, then?"
Harry never made it to work.
unfortunate – the last, the very last thing he needed in his glamorous life was an alcoholic, washed-up wizard with a bad attitude. But that drunk was Harry; possibly the one and only person Draco ever thought he
He looked around in interest; no windmills and no one seemed to be wearing wooden clogs. There weren't even any dikes in sight. He thought of the inevitable rejoinder Ron would make to that observation, and had to smile as he lugged his suitcase into the hotel lobby, showing the bored desk clerk his receipt.
Harry extracted himself from Draco’s grip and looked at him sadly. “I wish I could believe you.”
& & &
Harry shoved his hands back through his hair. "Ginny, there was never an "us." You wanted to think so, even after you knew I wasn't interested in you, or any girl, for that matter. I was never anything but honest with you, and the fact that you not only chose not to believe it, but actively try to hurt the person I
After a few more rounds of verbal jousting with his hapless cubicle mate, Harry left and started walking home; Apparating still made him want to toss, and the tube was downright dangerous. Besides, he'd been banned for six months from going on the O-line after innocently asking a woman carrying batteries if she thought the 'O' stood for orgasm. He'd felt the bumps in the track, seen the batteries and come to a logical conclusion, or so he thought. She thought differently, and bada-boom, he was banned. Walking was healthier, anyway.
"Living" was waking up next to someone you loved and feeling them curl against you in their sleep. It was knowing how they took their coffee and what part of the paper they'd want to read first. It was drying them off when they stepped out of the shower, and smiling when your mobile rang and it was them. It was falling back asleep at night, thoroughly shagged and smelling your lover's scent all over you.
He listened intently, and luck was with him; for a change, the deejay actually said the name of the band after the song.
"Thanks, I work hard at not caring."
Another small half-smile. "Depends on the night."
"Were you happy with him?"
Draco scrambled out of bed and gripped his shoulder, holding onto it tightly. "Harry, I - it's nothing, just an amusing pastime, a diversion. They don't MEAN anything to me."
He felt Harry's chest rising and falling against his and felt his breath against his skin; and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's soaked back and buried his face in thick black hair. "I am yours and you're mine, I swear on my life."
Harry was staring somewhere over their heads. "He's always awake when I come home. He pretends he's not, but I know when he's sleeping; he wheezes like an old teakettle, this little, constant whee, whee, whee sound." The corner of his lip quirked upwards. "It's a weirdly comforting sound that he absolutely insists he doesn't make, but anyway. He's never asleep. So, one night I came home and got into bed - and yeah, we still sleep in the same bed, how fucked is that - and I turned on my side to face the window, like I always do nowadays, cause facing him hurts." Harry took a deep breath, and lit a cigarette to momentarily distract himself, taking a deep drag and exhaling upwards towards the ceiling fans whirring lazily above them.
Draco shook his head. "Unbelievable."
The spotlights shifted and changed colors, the better to shimmer off the tight (and in Charlie's case downright illegal) white satin costumes dotted with gold sequins the family wore. In the wings, Draco privately thought that his father was most likely drooling over the accent crystals, even though sequins were frightfully common.
"Ah…" Draco reached over and stroked Harry's hair with one hand, sliding it through his fingers approvingly. "It's looking good, Potter."
Harry had stared at him. “Do you have any idea what an arsehole you are?”
"How do I sound?"
The leather trousers he could have handled, maybe, but not paired with the net shirt that showed patches of tanned skin throughout, or the studded belt and the boots, the entire outfit accentuated by the short, spiky haircut. It all looked amazing on Harry, but he NEVER dressed like this. EVER. Even if Draco had begged, he wouldn't have, not for him.
A pretty ordinary week day night actually; Draco was leaning forward on his elbows, busily writing stuff down in his planner while peering at the screen of his desktop computer, while Harry stretched out on the couch, reading. Occasionally, one of them would look up and catch the other one's eye and smile, then go back to what they were doing.
She smiled at him and turned away, Onyx yowling as he was stepped over; Harry locked eyes with the cat once more, but this time, it was him that turned away, walking down the street. He would never walk the Enge Kirkesteed again, but it would remain, of course, a lovely memory.
Adams sighed, the same sigh as Kingsley had emitted, and for that matter, the same sigh he got from Hermione, Ginny and even Ron. It was the "Harry, please get a CAT-scan" sigh, and he was tired of it. Maybe a vacation really would do him good.
Eventually, Draco had to get up and stretch, going over to the couch and nudging Harry's legs aside, sliding in under them. "Hi."
Only from Blaise (and Harry if he was being an asshole) would Draco tolerate "Drac." It was stupid, demeaning, unprofessional, and oddly fond.
Harry again stayed behind; he didn't even know why, exactly, or what exactly he was looking for, but like the footprint, there had to be something. This was obviously not the work of a master criminal or else they wouldn't have been this careless in the first place. He got down on his hands and knees at the edge of the mat; something looked rather shiny. He got closer and tentatively brushed his fingertip over the spot; his finger came away with some tacky substance on it. His brows drew together; he'd seen this before. Or, he thought with a sniff, he'd
He was feeling rather mellow when he turned in around two AM and the ringing of his bell at exactly eight AM was not exactly greeted with cheers and whistles, but he tipped the delivery guy anyway and shut the door, scratching and yawning.
"No, he's a Muggle author, so their World Wars. Still cool stuff though."
“Perhaps Black lost his virginity there - perhaps he liked the name. A fan of Shakespeare, maybe, how should I know? But it is there that he asked for a headstone, and it is there that Harry had it placed in his memory.”
"Make fun of me all you want, but it looked so good and felt even better, so thick and soft, with a little wave in it like in fourth year when he looked like a slob, except that it worked for him, of course. Everything always fucking works for him.”
"Okay, then, well, cheerio and all that rot." Harry stood and stretched, then absently picked his underwear out of his butt before slouching out the door. He heard the clink of glass against glass in his boss' office, looked at the clock and thought that Kingsley was starting a little early today – probably because he was going to miss Harry tons and tons.
, of all bloody colors."
Off to their left, the Fossors were arguing with Filch, who, amongst his other duties that he performed badly, was also in charge of the lights. "Bloody electric monstrosities," grumbled Dando, the leader. "I don't see why candles, torches, lanterns are not enough."
After the war, after the furor had died down and things started to be rebuilt, he had hunted down the Dursleys.
The show didn't start till eleven PM, but the venue was already crowded as all hell, and Harry had to take a deep breath and count to ten – four times – before he could steel himself to plunge into the crowd and elbow his way to the front. He found himself wedged in amongst several nubile young things, mostly female, but with a few males scattered throughout, many wearing more eyeliner than the already shrieking girls. At twenty-six, Harry was in no way old, but he still felt ancient in his present company. But he didn't leave. He was determined to see Milo in the flesh.
He knew those eyes.
As the rising sun burned its sparkling image into his corneas, he found himself repeating the same mantra to himself that he had since the day he arrived in Paris.
You just like to be? Well, whatever; won't win you any friends around here." Harry set the luggage down with a thump and rubbed his hands on his trousers. "Do you need anything else right now, Mr. Malfoy, Draco?"
"Got your wand?" Harry grinned as he held open the tent flap.
"Now?" He was hungry and damn sure Ginny wasn't going to share her bun. "Can't we talk later, like after breakfast, after tea or maybe never?" He was personally hoping for never, but his dreams were crushed when she shook her head. "No, now; our future is in jeopardy, Harry and we need to make some decisions. Come on."
Harry listened to the message four times. "I've really missed you Harry."
"Brat."
Draco managed to speak. "Green eyes?"
"A fat camp?" Draco shook his head. "That's punishment?"
Pansy laughed out loud. "Your Harry, Draco, killed Voldemort with the Elder Wand: decimated his remaining followers in the year after that, sparing your family and mine, neither of whom deserved to be spared, and in his most stunning display of bravery and guts yet, he's been your lover for two years and actually lived with your pain in the arse self for a year. Your Harry isn't afraid of anything, and a wild gay club or fetish bar isn't about to change that."
"Don't know; he said no names were necessary. And he can dance! I mean, I can dance, but he's amazing."
"I don't care; let Parkinson pick. She has good taste, so whatever she says."
Fuck, why, why, why did you say that? Harry closed his eyes and wished the words back as hard as he could.
"Oh." He didn't ask how he'd looked or if anyone had been with him - he was pretty sure not, but still didn't want to know.
The next day, Harry was waiting for Draco outside his tent when he emerged that morning, the skin on his hands raw, but otherwise unharmed.
"Harry."
Right.
Frankly, Draco wouldn't put it past Lucius to find a way to bitch at them from the underworld, and of course he'd find a way to do it while they were both naked, the pervy bastard. So, Harry was dressing in a slutty manner, doing shots of liquor that resulted in him being pinned against the wall, having Merlin knows what done to him (although Draco could well imagine), smoking and talking to strange men like he'd been doing it all his life.
"But why didn't she try to convince me? I look good, don't I?" Harry surveyed himself in the mirror.
He listened to the refrigerator hum: to the heater clicking on and off: to the cars going by their townhouse. To the water dripping in the kitchen; they had a leaky faucet there, and Harry just hadn't fixed it yet. He listened to his own heart beating, the sound his silver lighter made when snapped open and closed, and to his own breathing. He thought about Draco; thought about how his voice had been shaking when he asked Harry not to go, not to leave him. He thought about how Draco had lain awake every night, waiting for him to come home, and then pretending to be asleep so that they wouldn't fight. He thought about the look in his eyes the day Harry hadn't responded to him in bed, the hurt when Harry had been so callous in asking if he'd come yet. He thought about Draco steadfastly not asking where he was going or who he was going with; he'd thought it was just thoughtlessness on the other man’s part, more not caring - but were the thoughts just so painful that he couldn't stand it?
"No. I won't refuse you." He took a breath, then stepped closer, and Darcy opened the door, allowing him to step inside, and eyed the camera.
"You're out of your mind – you do know that, right?" Harry had finished his drink and forced his eyes to meet Draco's. "For caring even a little bit."
She shook her head and pulled out some pamphlets, waving her wand – which, unaccountably had a troll doll taped to it – to flip through them. "Well, dear, if its wild oats that are the issue, we could send you to Amsterdam. They do have a legal red-light district there, and the "workers" are regulated by the government, so it's all on the up and up. If you have the money, they have the time, as they say."
"What about Draco? I never went to his trial, or Goyle's or any of that crew. Are they in Azkaban too?"
Pansy raised an eyebrow. "No more “It's bloody brown Blaise?"
Harry was tempted to ask if the fact he was a dude who looked like a lady was supposed to be a secret, and then decided to keep quiet and eat a brownie, which he did as he followed Darcy into her room and shut the door behind him.
this afternoon –soiling the new bedding at that - he figured the bastard deserved it.
Harry shrugged, glad Draco seemed to be accepting his plan. "He can count; he just shoots off too fast."
Pansy helped him up; his legs felt weak, but something else was breaking through now as well - anger. Goddamn Potter, how fucking dare he go dancing with other guys, or let them buy him drinks or fuck knew what else?
"Of course I will…I just shouldn't have to." Draco crossed his arms and stared back at Harry.
"Draco? Okay?" Paul's voice was gentle.
Harry closed his eyes and took a breath before opening them again. "It's been you all along, hasn't it?"
A new face was always welcome in the district, it seemed, and Harry was fascinated by the variety of the girls offering themselves for sale. Some of them obviously specialized, as evidenced by their displays of props, and Harry saw a few items that looked downright dangerous, but he supposed the most successful whores were multi talented, as it were. The Morningstar and leather vambraces in one window disturbed him a bit, though he did like the thigh-high studded boots. He tried, albeit briefly, to imagine Ginny in them, and startled both himself and the girl's prospective clientele with the slightly hysterical peal of laughter that escaped him.
But when Harry came home, Draco might be in the shower. Or worse yet, on the computer; Harry hated that he couldn't bring himself to believe that Draco had stopped with the ring-up boys, and whenever he saw him sitting there with his planner and his mobile beside him, hurt and distrust would well up in him and he would go and change and leave the flat, desperate to make his mind just stop.
Outside the gates of the circus area, the cracks of Apparition were almost deafening as the audience members fled the scene in droves. In minutes, only the performers were left, staring at the wreckage of the tent, the scorched earth, and each other. Minerva was role-calling, moving amongst the stunned performers, ascertaining that everyone was present and accounted for. Harry was doing the same on a more informal scale, and was relieved when he saw two blond heads near the ticket booth.
Harry smiled a bit at that. "Sounds like Dra…" he stopped, then pushed past the surge of feeling the name crossing his lips brought him. "Draco. He likes to just lay there on the bed or the floor or couch and watch the lights play over different shapes and textures."
"No, no, I mean it's his problem, what he did." Draco leaned forward, desperate to make his point. "It didn't have anything to do with not loving you or wanting you anymore. It was solely his own stupidity, his inability to express himself, his fear that you wouldn't understand how scared he was, his lack of faith in himself, not you. He loves you more than anything."
"Fine, four – I forgot about your personal space issues. And besides, there are roughly 3,000 working prostitutes in Amsterdam, so you have 2,999 left to choose from."
"YES! See, you understand perfectly. We thought of Polyjuice, but that's nasty and imprecise. We know there will need to be a bit of a glamour on the face, different clothes, but the hair transformation is what we need from you."
He sat down and shut up, knowing that was the best possible way to deal with a Weasley woman.
The band was successful enough for each member to warrant his own suite, so once Draco closed the door and locked it, the Do Not Disturb sign hanging prominently on the doorknob, he was alone – a rare treat. At least that's what he told himself. If he was truthful, which he never was, he would have to admit that he hated being alone. He especially hated being alone in London, a city that seemed to mock his single status by reminding him that his phantom man should be here, should be in his suite with him, and eventually in his bed with him. And he wasn't, probably never would be.
Draco was so used to not sleeping at night these days that he reflected that he better adapt the nature of his business to something nocturnal if he had any hope of ever actually being there to inspire his employees to – to what? Hell, that's what he had minions and yes men for. Actually, he could probably never show up again and no one would notice. Two months ago, that realization might have dismayed him; now he saw it as more time he could spend with Harry, assuming he could convince Harry to ditch work and agree to never leave Draco's bed/whirlpool tub/side ever again.
caught anyone's eye.
"No, whoa, wait!" Harry stepped back hastily. "Pictures first!"
Harry looked down. "Ah, no. I just like to take photos, is all." He looked back up and met Darcy's gaze. "Would you allow me to take some photos of you – just for my own personal collection?"
"Hallo," said Harry, trying to be friendly. "Going to a party?"
Harry rubbed his forehead. "That's very kind of you, but I must have the wrong window. I'm looking for a beautiful girl." He paused, then added hastily. "No offense."
Oh fuck. Draco closed his eyes for a moment, then looked again, noting that the page had several smeared areas suggestive of where tears might have splashed on it.
Harry shrugged and helped Hagrid feed the crew of animals, some of whom were happy to see them, some who pretended indifference to their presence, and some who actively tried to maul them. Hagrid claimed they just wanted petting. "See there, 'Arry…just needs some love, don't ya, ya little rascal?"
Harry ran his comb through his hair one last time; it was almost behaving, but not quite. He gave up and shook his head till it was its Hogwarts-era unruly self again and called it good.
Pansy reached over and took his hand, squeezing it gently. "What time did you tell him you would be back?"
"Potter," said Draco, shifting to his other foot. "Uhm, sorry about the other night; I was a bit upset, as you can imagine."
"So…"
"That was an amazing performance last night, by the way," said Harry just to change the subject – the thought of exactly what Charlie and Lucius might be up to made him shudder. "I've never seen anyone bend that way. Double jointed?"
"Boobs?" Harry offered, after considering the question seriously.
“Why the hell would he be buried in a Muggle cemetery?”
in the world, so let's embrace the International Date Line like reasonable people, shall we? But he hadn't been able to do it, in the end – apparently, he still had some sense of propriety buried somewhere deep inside the wrecked shell of his body.
"Yes." Harry smiled at him, and Draco wanted so much to just wrap his arms around him and take him home and make everything okay again, somehow; the thought of going back to his Paris flat alone made him want to cry in frustration. And Draco wasn't sure how many tears he had left.
In the main area, Ginny was being held between two Ministry Aurors as her sentence was read. As Dumbledore finished speaking, a roar of laughter went up. Even the Weasleys were laughing; some behind hands and some openly.
That last wouldn't be so bad, really - the refreshment tables at such rallies were usually filled with some pretty good stuff, like lemon bars, mushroom tartlets, the odd chocolate chip cauldron cake or gingerbread.
Shrieks of "Aguamenti" went unheeded, as only one wizard in the tent had the ability to cast spells within those canvas walls, and he was being nearly trampled underfoot by the crowd as they frantically pushed to escape what was rapidly turning into an inferno.
Harry grinned at him when they broke for air. "What are you doing?"
Harry smiled a bit into his ale. "See?"
In the month since he'd first heard that first song, "Galaxy of Dreams," he had become – for lack of better word – a fan boy. Or a fan man, rather.
…outside Trelawney's tent the morning Ginny had demanded he love her.
He hadn't set out to be the lead singer in a rock band; in fact, he hadn't set out to be anything at all in particular, but when the Ministry of Magic basically tossed out the scions of the pureblood houses on their asses, he'd had to do something – and he'd be damned if he took some menial job, some low-rent position in the Ministry just to show how supposedly humble he now was. Draco Malfoy was many things, some unprintable, but humble was not one of them. He'd turned his back on wizarding society and began to explore the very world he'd been taught to despise, finding that his esteemed father had been wrong about that, too.
Draco snorted and stuck his hand out. "Hand me a smoke."

"Boring. High finance is always boring." Another pause. "How are the clubs?"
The portkey was good for 90 minutes, so Harry showered, shaved – it was a special occasion, after all – sent Ginny an owl saying he was on vacation and was positively ecstatic that she wasn't there, and dressed. He grabbed his suitcase, closed his hand around the portkey, and a short, turbulent time later, he was in Amsterdam – in the Prins Hendrikkade, to be exact, where his hotel was located.
"I don't know, honestly - both? I want to talk to him, because I've been thinking a lot about everything, about he and I and where we were and where I'd want to be if we stay together - but I dread it too because what if he's found someone else? What if that's why he's been gone so bloody long?"
Draco was home.
"So what if he does? He still did it to spite me." Draco drained half his vodka in one gulp.
"Yes."
"And the department, you mean."
Had he moved on? Grown tired of them not talking, gotten irritated, decided he didn't need this, didn't need him? Harry knew Draco had tried to talk to him many times but he hadn't been able to get past his hurt and anger. He would decide mid-day that yes, they needed to talk, they would talk, he'd come home early and they'd sit down with a bottle of wine and talk it all out, everything. And then they would be okay.
"Bollocks." He sat and scowled, then wrinkled his nose. "What's that weird smell?"
Harry leaned back and looked at him intently for several moments. "Of what?"
Harry was incapable of speaking, and Draco was amused beyond belief, but he managed to say. "Why not just use a sticking charm or a Reparo?"
Okay, that didn't sound quite right; he tried again, clearing his throat first. "What do you want?"
Hermione bit her lip and gestured to him. "Come over here."
Not just a lion tamer…but a chimera tamer. Not just a fire-breather, but a fire-eater. Not just an illusionist, but a master magician with a pet boggart. And not just clowns, but the most renowned clowns in Europe; the Fabulous Fossors. Some thought the Latin name a tad pretentious, but none could deny that they were, indeed, fabulous.
"Yes. You both have a similar way of speaking, and you use your hands like he does. He thinks I talk with my hands, but I'd swear he was an old Italian woman and I’ve threatened to tie his hands behind his back when we argue; I'm always figuring I'll wind up cracked across the face one of these days."
Harry shrugged, sitting up. "Spies, secrets, war - right up your alley."
The clubs were crowded, smoky, sticky with sweaty bodies, and in the end all the same, depressingly so. Draco got approached an average of 10 to 12 times an hour and told them all to sod off.
He'd ordered a t-shirt featuring Milo in all his pouty-lipped goodness and slept with it under his pillow. He knew all the words to all the songs, even the foreign translations. And he'd listened to hours of interviews, memorizing the sound of Milo's speaking voice. It sounded like southwest England to him, Wiltshire, maybe, the accent slightly less clipped than his own.
"You said he doesn't want to hear your explanations for why you strayed."
As the Fossors came on for their final skit, the rest of the Weasleys appeared. Ginny dragged Harry away and Charlie reluctantly took his eyes off Lucius - but not before waggling his fingers at the other man and smiling in a most suggestive way. Harry was very glad that he was not sharing a room with Charlie tonight, as he was a moaner and seemed to have a lot of stamina for certain pastimes.
"Something French, yeah, it was.” Paul stopped and stared at him. "Oh…"
"Not according to Surly." Harry waved the book. "Substitution is one of the best and most reliable ways to catch the bad guy or girl or thing or whatever. It always works for him."
"And you think I'M obsessed with that thing. “Draco stood up and stretched too. "Ten minutes, then I'm coming back down and dragging your arse upstairs."
"Bad business, 'Arry." Hagrid's tone was worried. "Looks t'me like it was mebbe started here, an' spread to the Big Top."
And there it was again.
"Uh, no," Draco managed, digging his palms into his eyes. "I'm okay; sorry to take so long."
"Easy for you to say; you still look hot."
He would set out enthusiastically enough; he was tired of staying put, tired of singing only in a studio, tired of Harry, who annoyed him to no end for almost all of the same reasons he had in school. He would board the tour bus, waving merrily, and a day out, or less, the loneliness would set in and he would become unbearable to everyone around him.
Yes, he was young…they were young. And yes, they were settled together and not every moment was fireworks and shooting stars. But there was love there and Draco cursed himself regularly for ever finding love – real love - either scary or boring.
The lights dimmed once again, and haunting music filled the air as in the center ring, now magically draped with silver and glass accents, became home to father and son. Not for nothing were they termed marvelous; alliteration and it's rolling off the tongue aside, their fluid and somehow impossible movements captivated the crowd as they twisted and turned, folding and unfolding their limbs, bending and flipping – all with such natural grace that one forgot that what they did didn't seem humanly possible.
"Yeah, I guess. What are you going to do?"
"He wasn't toading at the time; he didn't lick the toad till we drove away, and then he let it go back into the wild. He has abandonment issues, so that was a big step for him."
Milo.
"Yeah, sure." Harry watched him walk away and sighed. It was a very lovely view.
The rest of that day passed in a blur for Draco.
Harry shrugged and looked down for a long moment before looking up again. "What about you? You said you were in the same boat, so to speak."
"Yeah, I guess you would be." He didn't want to talk about it anymore, so changed the subject quickly. "I think the only real option is for me to dress up as you next performance and see what happens."
Darcy was in a white lace chemise this time, his hair loose, makeup minimal, except for the black liner. "I wondered if you'd come back for it," he said, leaning against his door. "You seemed so intent on capturing something with it, some essence … a memory, maybe. Because of course, that's all I'll be to you."
"Of course; far be it from me to stand in the way of justice." Draco shook his head, but followed along as Harry walked and talked.
Draco watched Harry pour him a hefty shot into what appeared to be a clean glass; Draco decided he could only hope for the best in that area. He was amused – and oddly turned on – by the fact that Harry didn't bother to change or even put on a shirt on before pouring himself three fingers of scotch. "Hair of the dog and all," and sitting down opposite him. "To something or other. Salut!"
Draco shook his head. “Not important right now. This is what’s important – what you’re doing.”
“Severus knew the stone was here, and he figured you were here or off getting drunk but felt you probably weren’t the type to visit graveyards while hammered.”
"Yeah, well, I just wanted to check in. You do sound tired though, Harry."
He wouldn't touch Draco's life again.
"Then you can hustle me right over to your darlingest and we'll worry about it then."
The rapping continued until, annoyed, Harry shouted, "Sod off!" If it was a friend, they would; if it was some hapless salesperson, they'd not stop rapping; and if it was anyone else? Well, it wouldn't be. No one else bothered with him.
Harry got up abruptly and left the flat himself, not stopping for his wallet, his keys, anything. Fuck it.
It didn't lessen the impact one little bit.
“We did it, my love, can you believe it?” Harry’s color was high and his eyes were sparkling.
Harry blushed, and started to say that no, he hadn't, but he was pants at lying and everyone knew it. "He's amazing," he sighed, leaning against the tub. "I think he may even be a natural blond."
The alcohol had definitely worn off and all Draco really wanted to do at the moment, truth be told, was go home, crawl into their bed and pull out the sweatshirt of Harry's that he'd taken to sleeping with, rest his face on it, and cry until he couldn't any more. Malfoys didn't cry, he'd always been told that. His esteemed father might never have shed a tear over anything, but he'd never loved anyone either. Not like his son
"PLEASE."
"I have to say, seeing you shot out of that cannon last night – and missing the target entirely – was one of the funniest things I've ever seen." Draco had finished licking the frosting off his finger, and was now regarding him with less of a smirk and more of a smile. Harry had to smile back. "Thank you so much…at least my arse wasn't on fire this time; that was a blessing."
Before Harry could say yea or nay, Darcy's lips were on his, and his arms were around Harry's neck, soft hands stroking his hair, and Harry couldn't do anything but respond in kind.
"I have no idea, really; either wonderfully right or very, very wrong." He got up and started to pour himself a shot of vodka, then put the bottle down again; liquid courage wasn't going to help here…only old-fashioned courage. God help him, he was channeling bloody Godric Gryffindor here.
