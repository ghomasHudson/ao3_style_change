Kingsley sat down hard, and after a brief pause, everyone else sat once again. The minister sighed and rubbed his temples. “Mr. Potter, you must understand. We need to keep them under constant surveillance. The Malfoys must atone for their crimes.”
“Do you want to settle in for a bit? I can show you around the house later, after dinner. If you’d like,” Harry offered.
Harry took the bag from Narcissa (and was thoroughly scorned by Draco when he offered to do the same for him), and they all started up the stairs. Kreacher led Draco to the room next to Harry’s, and a bit further down the hall, Harry left Narcissa with her bag in the second guest room.
Draco had smiled a bit, withdrawing his hand from Luna’s. “What about you two? Off to conquer more dark wizards?”
Harry grinned broadly, falling into step beside Draco as they walked quickly toward the Great Hall exit. He shoved the apple into his cloak pocket.
Pomfrey grabbed Potter and steered him toward a bed as McGonagall started to explain. “The boys in his dorm woke me, they told me Potter was having some kind of fit. His magic was so out of control he brought down the hangings on his bed and several frames from the walls.”
The sinking sensation he felt when Draco let out a derisive snort was comparable only to the time he had been knocked from his broom.. Draco was shaking his head, a far-off look in his eye. “Running all along the countryside with a bunch of Gryffindors and the Chosen One himself. I shudder to think what my father would say.”
Kingsley watched him a beat longer, then nodded, apparently satisfied. He signed his name with a flourish, then gestured for the Malfoys to do the same. Harry watched as first Narcissa, then Draco signed the paper with shaking hands. Kingsley handed the completed paperwork to his assistant, who took it and raced out the door without so much as a nod of acknowledgment.
McGonagall sighed heavily. “It appears as though Draco’s magic, which he used to heal you, is reacting poorly to being separated from him.” Harry and Draco exchanged a horrified glance, then stared back at the terse professor. “Until we get this all sorted out, I think it would be dangerous for you two to be apart- don’t give me that look, Potter, there’s nothing I can do about it. You’ll have to stay here tonight, and then arrangements will be made going forward.”
His gaze fell on the Malfoy family, huddled together and looking uncertain, as if they were unsure if they were welcome. Harry remembered the wand in his back pocket and thought that maybe, this was one thing he could do. Nobody was paying them any mind, so when Harry impulsively crept up to them and tugged on Draco’s sleeve, the only person who noticed was Draco himself, who jumped.
Harry could hardly touch his dinner that night. His stomach was in knots, the creature in his chest pacing in agitation.
As if on cue, he realized with growing horror that tears were forming in his eyes, and a snitch-sized lump had taken up residence in his throat. Merlin help him, Draco would not cry in front of Harry Potter.
“No,” Harry snapped, and his hand went flat on Draco’s chest, fingers splayed to cover as much of the scar as he could. “You didn’t deserve… you were a kid… this is the
Harry, perhaps unconsciously, squeezed Draco’s hand. Draco had never been so glad of the darkness, for he was sure he felt all of the blood in his body rushing to his face.
wand tip lit feebly for a moment, and then went out. Okay. That could have been worse, he supposed. He closed his eyes and focused all of his magical energy, imagining it as a physical source (“
Draco snorted. “You’re going to be sorely disappointed if that’s what you’re after. You already know all of my darkest secrets, and the rest is quite dull.”
Harry was strangely reluctant to leave Draco’s side, but turned dutifully and headed off in the opposite direction, not waiting around to see if Smith would follow. He walked in a daze, feeling vaguely nauseated, until he had reached Professor McGonagall’s office. She had refused to take over the Headmasters’ traditional rooms, preferring her cozy office that she had used when she was teaching Transfiguration.
“Come with me to Dumbledore. He can help you.” Harry had no idea where the thought had come from, but as soon as he said it, he instinctively knew it to be true.
A hush fell suddenly over the Great Hall, and Harry looked around for the source of the nervous energy in the room. He jumped to his feet the moment he laid eyes on Draco Malfoy clutching the strap of his messenger bag, lingering in the entrance of the hall. His shoulders were set defiantly back, pointed chin in the air. He set off, albeit at a slower pace, toward the Slytherin table. Harry glanced over just in time to see Pansy Parkinson set her book bag deliberately down in Draco’s usual seat. Draco had obviously seen it too, and his stride faltered.
Snape was beginning to lose his patience, but was working hard to maintain his composure. “Please elaborate. What exactly did you say?”
‘I am fond of Draco,’ Luna had said airily. ‘I know he thinks me a bit mad, but he was quite good to me when I was trapped at the Manor. It was almost like we were friends.’ Luna never flinched when she spoke of the war. It was incredibly refreshing.
The faces looming above him both showed obvious signs of relief. Madame Pomfrey sighed and ran her wand along Draco’s body, performing some diagnostic spells. “You gave us quite the fright, Mr. Malfoy,” she said hastily. “You’ve been unconscious for the better part of two days. We were beginning to wonder…”
Harry emerged from the castle a short while later, flanked only by Draco, Hermione, and Ron, who could not be talked into leaving his side.
Kingsley sat back in his chair, staring at the Malfoys curiously and with deep skepticism. “I want you to understand that these are far from the usual hearings. That Mr. Potter is being so good as to make this offer on your behalf shows he has a trust in you that you should not take lightly, nor should you take advantage of.” After another moment of quiet contemplation, he stood. “The Malfoy sentences are as follows. Draco Malfoy will spend two years in house arrest under the custody of Harry James Potter. Narcissa Malfoy will spend five years in house arrest under the custody of Harry James Potter. Lucius Malfoy will serve twenty years in Azkaban, allowing for monthly visitors. Now, unless anyone else has something to add…” Kingsley shot Harry a significant look, and Harry grinned sheepishly. “This concludes the Malfoy family hearing.”
Narcissa was watching them with a bemused smile. “Now, boys,” she said, gently chiding. “I’m quite tired, I think I shall head to bed. Please do try not to bicker for much longer, I think a good night’s sleep would serve us all well.”
‘I could never love you,’ it whispered savagely. ‘You’re nothing more than your father’s son, Death Eater scum.’
Harry honestly could not believe the absurdity of the situation he had found himself in. He could only imagine the look on Ron’s face when he found out that Harry became physically ill when he was separated from Draco Malfoy. ‘
A great shudder overtook Harry. He was finally able to focus on the situation at hand, and… oh. Oh. Draco was scared for him. Really scared. “I’m sorry,” he choked out, throat sore beyond belief. “I’m so sorry. I saw a Patronus. A doe. I had to follow her.”
Five minutes later Harry was curled up on the bed directly next to Draco’s, staring intently at his profile. Draco was far too used to Harry watching him to pay it much mind.
Luna glanced up, saw him standing there, and smiled vaguely. She looked back to Harry and brushed a sweaty lock of hair behind his ear. She leaned closer and whispered in his ear, one hand on his lower back. Draco bristled and walked over quickly.
, of all things? And he just had to go and summon the thing for the first time in front of almost the entire Hogwarts eighth year. Because Draco Malfoy didn’t do anything by halves, he absolutely did not.
“Well,” Draco crossed his arms peevishly, “You must admit it leaves something to be desired. But I’ve already said it’s better than Azkaban and I won’t say it again. Now accept my thanks, you great git.”
touch. Though he knew it was a byproduct of the bond they had created, the thought was still bizarre and exhilarating. By the time he was able to rip his gaze away from Harry’s hunched profile, Snape had already repaired the jars and returned them to their rightful place on the shelf.
“Potter, can you hear me?” He attempted to control the volume of his voice, though he knew it was useless to try to stop it from shaking. Harry gave no sign of consciousness.
He stepped forward and took Draco into his arms, pressing a kiss into blond hair as Draco folded into him willingly.
Harry shrugged. “Well, fine. That makes one of then, because I am scared. All the time. Terrified, really. And the only thing that helps me get through it is knowing that I’m fighting for the right side. The side that’s going to win, one way or another. Because Voldemort-”
, Draco thought unkindly. He kept his eyes firmly on the stone passageway before him. This meant that he was wholly unprepared when he was shoved hard from behind.
Draco turned to face him, and his face was open and vulnerable in a way Harry got to see so rarely. “I’m sorry about… Well, about everything that happened. The terrible things I said and did. I’m very sorry. For what it’s worth.”
Harry felt an urgent desire to never discuss what had just happened, and cleared his throat. “You shouldn’t go to Azkaban,” he said abruptly, voice cracking. “And neither should your mother. Without you both, I never could have done this today.”
A few minutes later he headed back, feeling much better after washing up. He knew something was wrong as soon as he saw Harry. He was hunched over, elbows on his knees and head in his hands. Luna was talking to him quietly, but once again the air surrounding Harry seemed charged, and bizarrely enough, the slippers at his feet had at least tripled in size.
Draco turned to Snape, eyes wide with alarm.The potions professor looked uncharacteristically worried. “It would seem, Draco, that you have saved Potter’s life by transferring a great deal of your magical energy to him.”
Harry’s hands were still shaking slightly as he clutched at his stomach. “I started to feel bad as soon as I left here last night. By the time I got to the dorm it was so bad I almost fell over. I don’t remember messing up my bed or the portraits.”
The halls of Hogwarts, however, proved that much had changed. Draco was one of the very few Slytherins who had returned, and that was simply because he had nowhere else to go. It was immediately clear that, though the Wizengamot had cleared him of all charges, the student body was not so quick to forgive.
The first month back had been bizarre. He had not only to cope with the new living situation, in which all returning eighth years had been placed together in one dormitory regardless of house, but he had to do it without Ron and Hermione for the first time ever. Harry kept mostly to himself in those early days, since a great majority of his friends had opted not to return. Then, one day when he was sitting in the eighth year common room working on a Charms paper, Luna Lovegood had situated herself beside him on the couch and began talking to him in that dreamy voice as though they had already been in the middle of a conversation. He still missed Ron and Hermione, of course, but Luna turned out to be very good company, and he quickly grew to love her.
Draco glanced down at his grey slacks and dark green jumper and smirked. “You would think these are ‘fancy’ clothes.” He eyed Harry’s well-worn jeans and tee-shirt with disdain and Harry struggled not to snap at him.
The next time he woke, Draco was feeling quite a bit more rested. He heard hushed voices nearby, but was reluctant to open his eyes. Everything was much simpler in his hazy half wakefulness.
He also, he found, was able to tolerate being increasingly distant from Draco with less severe side effects. Though a part of him knew it was wrong, he kept this to himself. Harry was worried that if given the opportunity to leave, Draco would do so immediately and without question. He selfishly didn’t want to give up the closeness that he had come to cherish.
“Oh, yes, Master Harry, sir,” Kreacher said, bowing so low his long nose brushed the kitchen floor. “Kreacher will be most honored to prepare the rooms, yes, my Mistress would be so pleased. Kreacher will start at once.” And with another pop, he was gone.
There was a small sound then, halfway between a cough and a laugh. Harry turned and saw Narcissa smiling at him, tears sparkling in her eyes. She approached him slowly, then reached out and took his hands in her own. He watched in numb disbelief as she leaned down and pressed her lips to each of his hands. He felt a tear fall onto his fingertips.
Draco closed his eyes and pressed both hands down on the wound, as hard as he dared. “You’re going to be okay, Potter. You are not going to die. Not after everything…” He was only vaguely aware that he was speaking aloud. It was more to comfort himself, anyway. “You are absolutely not going to die because you were being a brave idiot and trying to protect me. Absolutely not, I refuse to allow it.” His hands were growing warm now as he tried to visualize the steady stream of blood turning to a trickle, and then stopping entirely. “I promise you are going to live, Harry Potter. I promise you absolutely will not die today.”
“What? No!” Harry leaned forward. “I was going to say, I would have guessed it would have been like mine. Like fire.”
Harry looked once again to the Malfoys. Narcissa was still crying, though now she was looking at her husband. Lucius didn’t look angry, as Harry suspected he might, only tired. Draco was still watching Harry. Harry knew that it was fair punishment for Lucius to go to Azkaban. He was not a good man. Perhaps not evil, maybe just overly ambitious and prideful, but certainly not good. Only now, looking at the family that was about to be torn apart, Harry wished things were different. Wished he could spare them the pain of losing one another, as he had lost his own family.
“Enough, Lucius,” Voldemort spat. “Your boy has made his choice, and he shall face the consequences.” He glided forward, steps long and confident. “Draco Malfoy. Present yourself to me at once.”
Harry laughed and rolled over onto his back, pulling his hand away. Draco felt foolish for a moment about how terribly disappointed he was, and then Harry reached out with his other hand and threaded their fingers together once more. “That story will have to wait, we need to sleep if we’re to be any good in charms tomorrow. It is a pretty good story, though.”
Draco took an enormous bite of his apple and chewed thoughtfully for a while. “This does not make us friends.”
It was hours later when Professor Snape sent for them, and the only thing they had gained from the piles of books were headaches. Draco snapped the book in front of him shut, feeling distinctly grouchy. It certainly didn’t help that the only thing he had eaten all day was an apple, and it had to be approaching late afternoon.
Harry thought for a moment before answering, “The same reason you lied for me at the Manor, I reckon, and why you saved me again at school. I didn’t want you to die. You were a bully, and- and wrong about a lot of things. But you didn’t deserve to die.”
“Mr. Malfoy needs rest,” Madame Pomfrey demanded peevishly. “He’s dealt with quite enough for one day. You lot clear out and let the boy sleep.” Draco could have kissed her. He listened as several pairs of feet started their quiet exit. “That means you too, Mr. Potter.”
“We?” Draco looked pointedly at the lone book by Harry, open barely past the index, and then the mass of books surrounding himself.
Things happened very quickly from there. Some Death Eaters began to Disapparate as others forged on, closing in on his friends who were all scurrying back into the castle. He waited for an opening, then sprinted through the great doors just before they were warded and shut against Voldemort and his followers.
Harry ran his hands through his already unruly hair. “Well. I’m going to sound a bit of a prat but-”
Silence prevailed, neither of them knowing how to continue, or if they should. Harry was just about to suggest that they head up to their rooms when Draco asked quietly, still looking up at the sky, “Why did you save me that day?”
A huff of annoyance, and then, “Well, one day I was a baby hanging out with my parents, doing baby stuff, I imagine, when this lunatic-”
They didn’t understand Draco like Harry did, though. Even when they were enemies, even at its very peak in sixth year, Harry had understood Draco far better than his friends. Desperate for attention, desperate for approval, desperate to live up to his father’s expectations. All of those things, yes. Never evil, though, and certainly not a killer. He could still picture Draco’s petrified face as Voldemort tortured the Muggle Studies professor in front of him. They had been fighting the wars of their fathers, and Draco had been thrust into a role just as surely as Harry had.
Draco smiled and stepped close to Harry, placing his hands lightly on Harry’s waist. “Well, I suppose I can make certain allowances. Since I am in love with you.”
Harry nodded. “We can’t leave them!” He shouted to Ron and Hermione. “Get out of here, destroy the diadem, we’ll be right behind you!”
Harry laughed aloud, a bit hysterical, the sound out of place in a hall filled with people recovering from battle. He pulled the three of them into a crushing hug.
They were sprinting, Harry with a firm grip on Draco’s sleeve, keeping him both upright and beside him.
And yet, he said he had missed being insulted by Draco. What a crazy person. He and Lovegood were perfectly suited.
“That was me,” he whispered, horrified. His fingers were shaking as he reached out to touch the scar, a thin white slash that crossed from Draco’s shoulder to the bottom of his ribs. “I did this to you.”
There, standing in the light of the early morning, hands linked together so they formed a chain, the four spoke a single word, together, and it was more powerful than any Unbreakable Vow that had ever been made.
Harry nodded and then rested his cheek on his knees, staring at Draco’s sharp profile. His heart ached.
“Draco!” Harry shouted. The other boy did not hear him. His face was colorless, filled with horror as he lay on the ground staring up at the swirling black mass.
and Harry, ever the Gryffindor, wanted to ease his discomfort. “It’s okay if you do,” he said softly, reaching out.
Another flick of her wand and Draco was being carried down the corridor, off to the hospital wing. Harry jogged to keep up, but Pomfrey held out a hand. “You and Smith are to report to the Headmistress at once.”
Harry saw Ron and Hermione holding hands, sitting with the Weasley clan. Molly was sobbing inconsolably into Arthur’s shirt. There was a conspicuously empty seat beside George, who looked completely lost, holding his head in his hands. Though he knew it was selfish, Harry was not yet ready to face them. He couldn’t bear their sadness in addition to his own. He couldn’t handle their gazes on him, full of pity, or worse, gratitude.
“Delicate?” Draco retorted in exaggerated outrage. “Just because I wheeze when there’s more soot in the air than oxygen?”
Harry paused to think and then answered, “Anything you want to tell me. Your childhood, maybe? Pets? First ride on a broom? Your deepest, darkest secrets?”
McGonagall was leaning toward Harry with a concerned gaze and furrowed brow. “Mr. Potter, are you feeling alright? I have never seen you lose control of your magic like that, and you’re looking a bit pale.”
He shook himself out of his thoughts. “Have you finished your Potions essay yet?” Harry asked, the first excuse that came to mind. “I’ve still got six inches of parchment to write, only I think I’ve probably botched the whole thing, if I’m honest.”
Draco sighed and fell back in his bed, scooting closer to the wall and pulling back the comforter on the other side. “If it means you’ll stop talking and let me go to sleep, then have at it. Git.”
Madame Pomfrey grabbed him by the chin, turning his head to each side. “You seem fine, Harry. Were you injured?”
Before he could even finish the incantation, the glass shot off the table with such speed and force that it smashed against the ceiling before anyone could react. Madame Pomfrey gave a cry of shock as the shards of glass fell, scattering across the floor. Harry blinked in surprise, then vanished the shards of glass with a wordless wave of his wand.
“Just spying on me as usual, then?” Draco hissed. He held his arms out at his sides. “Well? Happy now, Potter? Is this what you wanted to see?”
Harry stilled, gaze darting between Draco and Luna as they carried on a quiet, amicable discussion on how best to sift through the immense amount of information in front of them. For all Harry had watched Draco this year, he had never looked quite so comfortable. The slight upturn of his lips, the ease with which he was speaking with Luna. It was the first glimpse of pre-war Draco he had seen, and it had been Luna to bring it out of him.
Draco stopped in his tracks. Surely Harry had not been so affected by his trip to the bathroom. He had hardly been gone ten minutes and he had been just down the hall. This had to be about something else.
“I don’t care!” Draco roared, grabbing Harry firmly by the shoulders. “I don’t care, you can’t die, do you hear me? You can’t. I won’t let you…”
“It is not Luna Lovegood that I am interested in,” he said firmly, summoning all of his courage to look Harry straight in the eyes. Harry stared at him with wide, startled eyes, and swallowed thickly.
Draco turned to him, brow furrowed. “Why on earth would I come back here? From the sound of it you’ll have me sleeping in a dingy tent with a rock for a pillow far before the new school term. Oh, that simply won’t do. I’ll have to look up some household spells to make the next few months somewhat bearable. Maybe Granger knows some- Good lord, Potter, are you crying?”
He shrugged. “I really don’t know. I always thought I would join Ron in the aurors, but it’s not what I really want to do.”
Harry hummed in acknowledgment. “Your names are both on the family tree upstairs. In a way, the house is really more yours than it is mine.”
Harry frowned, shuffling his feet a bit in discomfort. “Well, it wouldn’t be nearly big enough to fill this wall. I only know about my parents, and my muggle family on my mother’s side. I’ve seen pictures of my grandparents, but I don’t even know their names.” He was acutely aware of Draco and Narcissa’s gazes on him, so he forced a smile and hoped it didn’t look as fake as it felt. “It’s alright, though, it’s nice to see Sirius’ family on the wall. And it would be great if we could fix where they burnt away his name.”
An intense pang of fear shot through him then. He had only narrowly avoided Azkaban after the war. If he was found now, kneeling over a dead Boy Who Lived, what would become of him? He had a wild urge to flee not only the hallway, but escape from the school entirely, perhaps even make a life somewhere in a new country. Looking into the pale, waxy features of Harry Potter, and knowing that his fingers were the only chance at keeping him alive, stopped him.
The voice of Draco Malfoy broke him from his reverie. Harry grinned and obeyed, stepping back and turning to face his friends. Hermione and Ron were holding hands, and Hermione was beaming at him. Draco looked positively exhausted, dark circles marring his pale face.
Luna had placed a gentle hand on top of Draco’s and he looked up into Luna’s twinkling glacial blue eyes. “I think you’re going to make an excellent Healer, Draco.” She smiled kindly, and squeezed his hand.
“Good lord, Harry, step back. It would not do for the savior of the wizarding world to die moments after defeating the Dark Lord by accidentally falling off a bridge.”
Good lord, he couldn’t even contemplate his own misery in peace anymore. He sighed quite dramatically to show how put upon he was and turned to look at Harry, eyebrow raised. Harry was squinting slightly, glasses already on his bedside table.
Harry was breathing hard when he finished, heart pounding, and the sound seemed to echo through the empty bathroom. Draco was clutching the sinks so hard his knuckles were white.
A low murmuring was spreading through the room as witches and wizards bent their heads low together to discuss what had happened. Kingsley held up a single hand, and all became silent once more. Still, Harry couldn’t look at the Malfoy family. Would they be glad for his intervention, or outraged? He did not feel brave enough to find out yet.
After a moment of silence, Kingsley leaned forward. “Harry, do you understand what you’re offering? You would have two convicted Death Eaters in your home. Death Eaters that have proven themselves to be a danger to others. Before we could even consider such an offer, I need to know that you are fully aware of the implications of what you are saying.”
A heavy silence followed, and Draco felt as though Harry could probably hear his heart racing, for it was deafening in his own ears. It was the most he had spoken about himself in a long time. When it became practically unbearable, Draco cleared his throat and said, “Oh, and the only pets I’ve ever had are those dreadful peacocks. Horrible pets, quite mean. Your turn.”
“A life debt is a very serious and tricky bit of magic,” Snape continued, looking even more tense and surly than he usually did. “It is not completely understood by even the most learned of wizards. I have a suspicion of what may have transpired, but first, I must ask you to tell us what happened in that corridor before Smith brought Madame Pomfrey to you.”
“Wait!” Draco’s panicked cry stopped Harry short, and he followed Draco’s gaze toward Crabbe and Goyle, perched atop an unsteady tower of debris, terror plain on their faces.
He shrugged. “It’s kind of like… water. A river, or something. I guess I would have thought it would feel…”
Harry did not look back toward Draco, feeling that if he did, he might not be able to force himself to leave.
“No. It’s… it’s Narcissa Malfoy, actually, and her son, Draco. They’re going to live with us from now on.”
Draco’s heart froze at the sight of the dark blood marring Harry’s forehead. He looked around frantically, gaze falling on a stricken Zacharias Smith, whose eyes were darting between Harry and his own wand.
All three watched with badly contained anxiety as the extremely old elf struggled to take the bag from Narcissa’s hand. “Er, Kreacher,” Harry interrupted, “Why don’t you let me take the bags, and you can just lead the way to the guest rooms?”
It was not so very long ago that Draco believed he would never be safe again. Inexplicably, he wanted to cry. Instead, he curled up with his head pillowed on Luna's lap, as he had once done with Pansy. Just before he drifted off, he felt gentle fingers, too rough to be Luna’s, stroke the hair out of his face and tuck it gently behind his ears.
Dizziness came upon Draco like a wave. Unable to resist, he slumped forward, his head thumping down onto Harry’s chest.
It had obviously been the wrong thing to say. Draco recoiled violently. “Well thank you for giving me your
Draco felt like rubbish. Maybe worse than rubbish, since at least trash was usually contained in a bin. He felt like he was tearing apart at the seams, exhausted beyond belief, fatigued and aching and hollow. He had become very comfortable with his solitude, and the past few days had worn on him tremendously. It was proving harder than he would have anticipated to rejoin the world of the social. Not that he ever anticipated needing to rejoin it at all.
bit had been about? The thought was so egregious that it made Draco slightly cross. What did he have to do to show Harry his interest? Be kind to him? Call him by his first name? Ask him out on a
Harry shifted and rubbed absently at the back of his neck. “It wasn’t that bad this time. I guess the further apart we are the worse I feel.”
“Draco, stop,” Harry interrupted. “He would have found a way to make Snape do it no matter what, you know that.”
Twenty minutes later, Harry was casting Scourgify on every surface of the kitchen, trying to clear the worst of the grime which had accumulated. Household spells were not his strong suit, and he was sweating by the time his doorbell rang. He glared at a particularly stubborn and mysterious purple-ish stain next to the sink, threw a hand towel over it, and rushed to get the door.
Harry reached out sluggishly and touched Draco’s face, still not quite out of whatever stupor he had fallen into. “W-Why are you all wet?”
Harry was freezing cold, colder than he could remember being in his entire life. His teeth were chattering so hard he feared he might chip a tooth, yet he felt strangely disconnected from his body. He curled into the warmth beside him, ignoring the muffled sounds trying to penetrate his consciousness.
Kingsley sighed, looking highly put upon. “I knew this might be a point of contention for you, Harry. And I know the state of Sirius’ home. However, this rule is for your safety and-”
Draco pretended not to notice, but Harry could tell by the rigid set of his shoulders and his resigned gaze that he knew exactly what effect his presence caused. After that, Harry had said firmly that they really should’t waste time wandering the castle anyway, and they took the rest of their meals in the common room.
Kingsley barked out a humorless laugh. “Aurors around the clock? Mr. Potter, my Aurors are currently overworked and understaffed, trying to hunt down the Death Eaters who fled. We don’t have the resources to do such a preposterous thing.” Harry’s brain was working furiously, trying to come up with any other solution. “Now, Mr. Potter, if that is all…”
Voldemort was pacing the courtyard like a caged cat, agitated and pausing only to curse whatever unlucky Death Eater happened to get in his way.
Draco turned his back, shuffling through his drawers to pull out pajamas for both of them. “Could’ve been,” he said quietly.
Twenty minutes later, Kingsley rose to his feet, and without thinking, Harry jumped up as well. He saw Kingsley smile, just a bit, in his direction before donning the serious affect of the Minister of Magic once more.
“Just about done,” Hermione answered, eyes darting over the final few pages of the packet. She presented the final page to Harry. “This one requires signatures from you, the Malfoys, and the Minister.”
“Oh, this must be Narcissa and the young Draco Malfoy. It is very good to be meeting you indeed,” he croaked, bowing as low as possible. “May old Kreacher be taking your bags to your rooms, esteemed guests of Master Harry?”
Draco just blinked at him, overwhelmed by a sudden vision of them waking up together, legs tangled, heads bent close together.
Narcissa smiled, but she looked vaguely troubled. “Yes, that’s right. I’ve been to this house only once, when I was a girl.”
McGonagall rubbed her temple in a rare display of weariness. “Professor Snape and I will work to arrange everything. Take tomorrow off from class, by Sunday we should have all the details sorted. Poppy, can you set an extra bed for Mr. Potter?”
“Hey, no, I’m sorry.” Draco reached out at once and laid his hand atop Harry’s. “Teddy will never go through that. You’ll make sure of that, won’t you? As will I. He’s sort of my cousin, after all.” Harry breathed hard and buried his face in his pillow, flipping his hand over and lacing his fingers through Draco’s. Draco’s heart leapt to his throat. The gesture felt infinitely more intimate since they were lying next to each other in the dark. He could easily imagine a similar situation in different circumstances, where they were together by choice instead of force, where Harry was looking at him and smiling fondly, rather than in pain and trying to pull himself together.
It had been a long time coming. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had let himself feel so completely, and he found that once he started, he couldn’t stop. He cried for Colin Creevey, the heroic little boy who had only wanted to help. For Fred, who would never again light up the world with his laughter and pranks, and for George, who had lost a part of himself when he lost his twin. For Tonks and Lupin, who had only just become parents, and Teddy, who would grow up without a mother and father. Even for Severus Snape, whom he had so loathed, but who had loved his mother so deeply that he had protected and guided her child for seventeen long years after she had gone. And he cried for Draco Malfoy, the proud boy who had offered his hand in friendship when he was eleven and had been rebuffed for possibly the first time in his life. The boy who grew up in a stifling environment with toxic belief systems. The boy who made all the wrong choices.
Harry looked over to Luna, who was watching Draco carefully, her expression worried. If Harry were being honest with himself, he was worried about Draco too. He just didn’t like to see those deep purple bags beneath Draco’s eyes. They reminded him far too much of sixth year. Of seeing that pale face, gaunt and drawn, crying in the bathroom mirror.
After a day had gone by with no sight of Draco, he went to see the headmaster. “Give young Draco some time, Harry,” was all he had said. “But be ready because I suspect he will be in great need of a friend.”
Draco felt his eyes burning and an uncomfortable lump forming in his throat. He wanted to rage, to scream and cry and throw things, but instead he let his head fall back against the pillow and closed his eyes tight. He wished desperately to be alone.
Luna laughed, an airy, breathless sound. “Quite right, Draco. Research has never been Harry’s strong suit. Luckily, I do love to read. Knowledge is limitless, and our most powerful source of magic.”
Harry jumped to his feet. “No!” he shouted. He heard Ron’s low moan from beside him. Everyone froze, some halfway through the motion of standing.
Where was he? He took a moment to think back and remembered with a start: the lake. The sword of Gryffindor. The locket, pulling him down, refusing to let him surface. Panic clouding his senses, and then, finally, ice cold water filling his lungs.
Harry nodded and shot out of the room. He was beginning to feel so ill that he thought he might need to be checked by Madame Pomfrey after all, but by the time he had reached the Hospital Wing, he found he was feeling much better.
Draco took in the domestic scene, Luna’s fingers stroking soothing circles in the fabric of Harry’s sweater, Harry’s fingers carding absently through her long blonde curls. The love was so obvious it was almost a tangible, physical thing, and Draco chest ached. As if Luna could sense a disturbance in their peaceful bubble, she stared up at him with icy blue eyes and held a pale hand out to him. Without thinking, he grabbed her hand and allowed himself to be pulled to the couch.
Finally, Harry glanced over to the Malfoys. Draco was watching him, face carefully blank, paler than ever. Narcissa was weeping quietly, one hand pressed to her chest and the other to her mouth. They didn’t look furious, or even dangerous. They just looked scared. Harry felt as though they had endured enough fear for their entire lifetimes. “Yes,” he answered solemnly. “I understand. The offer stands. Please give it serious consideration, and remember that I would not be standing here today if not for them. They are not evil people.”
Draco seemed momentarily stunned out of his grief. Harry suspected he had never had friends so fiercely loyal.
Whenever he mentioned Draco to Ron and Hermione during their fire calls or visits, the two exchanged maddeningly knowing glances, as if to say ‘
Sirius’ ancestral home was looking far worse than Harry ever remembered seeing it. Every surface seemed coated in a gratuitous layer of dust and spiders lurked in every corner. The amount of work that needed to be done felt overwhelming. Rather than dwell on it, he made his way into the kitchen and put on the kettle, making himself a tea to calm him down.
“Potter!” he was shouting. Harry blinked. Draco was soaking wet. “Harry, say something! Can you hear me?”
Harry stood under the invisibility cloak and surveyed the scene in front of him. The Great Hall was filled again with tables and benches, though now they had no discernable order to them. People sat with their friends and family, paying no mind to houses or age. Some were crying, some laughing, others hugging.
“What on earth possessed you to come out here alone, without at least letting one of us know where you were going?” Draco snapped. “You could have died. You almost died! And it would have been for nothing you great, useless sod!” He pulled his wand out of his pocket and cast a warming charm over them both.
Color rose in Harry’s cheeks. The look suited him, Draco thought. “You don’t have to be a twat about it.”
The night after the first time Harry had slept in Draco’s room, Harry had lingered awkwardly at Draco’s door when they would usually part to go to sleep. Draco studied him for a moment before opening his door, stepping in, and muttering over his shoulder, “Don’t wake me up when you come in this time.” Since then, they hadn’t spent a night apart. Harry’s room was used only to store his clothes. It was doing very frustrating things to Draco’s heart.
“You know,” he said, “you never did end up telling me how you got all those house points in our first year.”
“I’m not holding hands with Draco, if that’s what you’re all after,” Ron joked. Draco pulled a horrified face and Harry and Hermione laughed joyfully.
When he had first started trying to summon a Patronus back in fifth year, he had imagined a silver swan bursting out of his wand, graceful and elegant, like his mother’s. After months of relentless practice, the most he could do was conjure a silvery shield in front of himself. He knew it was most likely because he wasn’t using powerful enough memories, but, pathetic as it was, he just didn’t think he had anything happy enough at his disposal.
Before he knew what was happening, Potter was back on his feet and up in Draco’s face. He couldn’t even take a breath to snap something nasty when his back already hit the wall hard. Potter had his fists in Draco’s robes and he was so
“I’m not particularly hungry,” he muttered, then rolled his eyes at her pinched expression. “I ate plenty of lunch and I promise to call for Dobby after the DA is done, alright?”
He opted for a vague approach, indicating that some new things had come to light that were difficult to swallow, but that he couldn’t really explain anything until they met in person again. He assured them that Remus was looking out for him, that he was safe and looking forward to seeing them. None of it was untrue, per se. It just left out all the important parts. Some small, spiteful part of him felt satisfied that they now were in his position from one year ago, not really getting any answers and having to make due with vague hints and lacking reassurances.
When he climbed into the bath a few minutes later, the water was scalding hot—perfect. He could feel his tired and from his transformation irritated muscles unknot and relax. With a sigh, he sank deeper into the water. The only thing missing now was— With a flick of his wand, he summoned a bar of chocolate and happily ate a piece. Yes, perfect.
to ease Harry’s mind— Oh, right. He could. In one smooth motion he pushed Harry onto his back, rolled on top of him and kissed him.
curse left and right. And he’s looking for you, Harry. His vigour to find and eliminate you seems to have been renewed, now that the press is continuously hailing you as the Chosen One.”
He’d run into him eventually. And if he didn’t there were still meal times. Draco grinned. His mother was quite insistent on upholding proper dining routines, even in the face of rather unwilling company. Potter would have to get over his arrogance and talk to him eventually.
, something I can use to destroy the fool, to lure him and his Golden Boy out of hiding and into the open. You see, I was planning to use the Malfoy boy gain access to the school, where the old fool would be vulnerable, but the Malfoys have abandoned their home,” he rambled, half laughing. “I suppose we should be grateful, it is wonderful to have a new permanent residence that is not soiled by the stench of Muggles.”
Taking the glasses off again, there was no doubt about it: He decidedly saw better without them. Bemused, he set them aside. How odd.
“I’m serious! This isn’t a game, how can we be sure he won’t run to You-Know-Who as soon as he gets the chance? For real, Harry, how can you—”
He settled on his bed and spent the rest of his time with the dorm to himself, talking to Sirona. Even though the Gryffindor boys had accepted her well enough, Harry was hesitant to speak Parseltongue in front of them. Unlike Draco they associated it with rather negative things.
Suddenly aware that he was wasting time, Draco did the least Slytherin thing possible and decided to just
Silence settled over them again. Draco felt Harry’s chest rise and fall against his side with every breath, the weight of Harry’s head comforting on his shoulder. Third year. They could’ve had this since third year. Draco pushed the thought away resolutely. The past was the past, there was nothing he could do about it. They’d found each other now. What had Harry said?
Severus whirled around to see Harry standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest and his face set in a stubborn mask, Draco and Narcissa standing a few steps behind him.
“What happened?” he demanded as he closed the distance to them in two big strides and sunk to his knees on Narcissa’s other side.
“I’ll miss you, too,” Harry replied, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. “But we’ll see each other soon, promise.”
“It happens occasionally.” Harry gave him a firm kiss, then pulled away completely, picking up his Invisibility Cloak. Draco bit back a needy sound at the loss of contact.
“I never expected you to,” said Harry. “It’d be nice if you could stop openly hoping for my relationship to fail, though.” His icy tone made Ron flinch a little.
“Or he might not,” Moody said grimly. “You heard Severus; he looks just like Sirius. Sirius died last night.”
Fortunately, she seemed to be a little more acquiescing this time, judging by the guilty look she was giving him.
She made an indignant sound, opening her mouth to respond when Ron’s hand came to rest on her arm, giving it a light squeeze.
Harry laughed a little at seeing Draco’s exasperation, but he sounded apologetic when he said, “I’m sorry, sugar. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
...also, are these notes annoying? I can't tell; I love reading the author's thoughts, but so many fics have no notes at all and idk... -insecurities-
“Mmh, yes,” the Dark Lord mused, tapping his lips in contemplation. “Perhaps you are right, it wouldn’t do to risk you completely. I shall find another way to get into Hogwarts. Nevertheless, you disappoint me, Severus.”
“If you’re all quite finished, I’d like to know what you intend to do about this, Albus,” Severus interrupted, unwilling to endure the back and forth any longer. “The boy is obviously changed, but still recognisable. Whoever sees him will realise that he is not James Potter’s son, all they had in common before has disappeared. I do not believe it would be wise to announce this news too widely just yet, especially after what happened at the Ministry.”
“I’m sorry for making you feel like we don’t trust your judgement. We’ll be better about trusting you. Won’t we, Ron?”
“I just wanted to take a look, maybe I could help!” Harry argued, his heart beating hard in his chest. Again he made to move towards them, but this time Severus whirled around completely, getting to his feet. Despite being the same height, he seemed to be towering over Harry.
“Yes, yes, fuck, I—” But he didn’t have words. He forced himself to lift his head off the wall and look down at Harry. He almost came at the sight of Harry kneeling in front of him, his mouth around Draco’s cock, staring up at him with blazing eyes. The heat in those green eyes was so intense it sent a shudder through Draco’s entire body. No words. He opened his mouth uselessly, trying to do as Harry had requested and tell him what he wanted, but he had no words, doubted he’d ever have words again.
It was a complicated thing, but it matched Harry’s main interest in potions remarkably well: A potion used to alleviate a condition of magical origin that could not be counteracted with a spell. In combination with Harry’s personal interest in the potion because it directly affected Remus, it was the perfect starting point to overcome their habitually antagonistic attitudes towards each other in this particular setting. If Severus was lucky, that would finally break the ice enough to talk about more personal issues between them that had to be addressed.
Harry took a deep breath. Where to begin? How much did he really have to say? He couldn’t keep it a secret forever either way, and latest when summer ended, everyone would know.
Despite the somewhat incredulous look on her face, Narcissa didn’t hesitate to comply and began to unbutton Severus’ robes, while Harry continued to visualise the form he was about to cast. It was fairly straightforward. The form was designed to rid wounds of curse-traces that could interfere with conventional healing spells, given that the curse was located in the wound itself and not deeper inside the body. Not a healing form per se, but perfect for their current issue—that the cuts wouldn’t heal because they held residual dark magic.
“Still, I don’t want you to pick up habits that could cost you your life on a battlefield,” Remus maintained stubbornly, and Harry relented with an eye-roll.
It was a rainy Friday and Harry was meeting Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron. Remus gave him a cheery smile as they stepped outside into the rain to apparate—they really had to fix the Floo access at Grimmauld Place—and Harry tried to find the same enthusiasm for the day ahead of him. It wasn’t like he hadn’t missed Ron and Hermione, he definitely had, but seeing them meant either confronting a whole slab of uncomfortable topics in public or endure hours of subliminal awkward tension as they all carefully refrained from addressing them. It was impossible to predict which it was going to be—either was equally likely depending on their moods.
Then she pulled Harry away from the wall they’d been working on, made him sit down on the couch and asked again, “What are you
Draco had fled the Slytherin common room pretending to evade Pansy’s whining, leaving Blaise to deal with her whims — and glad for the excuse. Shaking off Greg and Vince had turned out to be easier than expected, too. They hadn’t even questioned him when he’d waved them off, assuring them he was fine by himself.
Barely ten minutes later, they walked into the dining room for breakfast, where Draco’s mother immediately pulled Harry into a hug to wish him a happy birthday. They settled down at the table and before long, Remus and Severus entered, also extending birthday wishes as they took their seats.
“Did you know that Harry was supposedly conceived on their wedding night?” she asked, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.
Which also meant that it should be Severus getting ready for the conversation Remus had been avoiding for two days, not him. Remus buried his face in his hands with a groan. He’d suspected that he’d have to give Harry
The words were almost drowned out by the droning in his ears. He felt soft, warm hands around his face and flinched away, but the hands moved with him. It took him a moment to realise that they weren’t hurting him. They were just there, soft and warm. His vision cleared a little and he found those silver eyes again, rooting him in place.
After what could only have been minutes but felt like half an hour, Snape’s face betrayed the faintest frown, gone so quickly Harry wasn’t sure whether he’d imagined it, and he straightened.
The two could still be rather snarky with each other sometimes, that much was certainly true, but only minutes after some sharp banter, Remus would catch Draco simply staring at Harry as he read his book, as if nothing in the world was more interesting than watching Harry read. Vice versa, Remus had found Harry to consistently stare after Draco whenever he went anywhere.
Harry’s hips jerked again, and Draco freed his hand to still them. Green eyes opened to look down at him, black pupils almost swallowing the entire iris. He winked and Harry groaned, letting his head fall back, eyes closing again.
“Oh, right. Look at this.” Harry pushed the book towards Draco. “See all those annotations? They match the instructions that Severus gave us.”
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed resignedly. “Yes, I suppose she does. Fine, I’ll talk to him…soon.”
Nevertheless, it was nice to be surrounded by so much magic again. It was almost tangible, a buzz in the air.
Still, in the beginning Remus had hoped that maybe there was a good reason for it. Perhaps You-Know-Who was actively trying to use the connection to Harry, and Severus had to keep his distance for safety’s sake. But then Severus had ignored him during the first Order meeting, avoiding his eyes the entire time and disappearing into his room again immediately afterwards. It was infuriating. Worst of all, there was nothing Remus could do to change it. Nothing he could do to comfort Harry, because despite all his love for the boy, he wasn’t his actual father. Severus was.
Eventually, he’d lost his cool and retaliated, only realising later that he felt more clear and awake than he had in days. It had gone downhill quickly from there, although Harry wasn’t sure if he really considered it a negative development. The murmured insults were as venomous as ever, yet they didn’t make Harry’s blood boil in the same way as they once had. It still boiled, but differently. He found himself craving that tension, however malicious it was on the surface, just to feel that pull of…
Half an hour later, Harry stepped out of the shower and in front of the sink to brush his teeth, feeling refreshed. He picked up his glasses, which he’d taken off before showering, put them back on, looked up into the mirror—and froze.
“Just stocking up on Pepper-Up potions,” answered Severus, not looking up from the Mandrake root he was cutting up with practiced precision. He slid the root off the cutting board and into the cauldron, then stirred until the potion darkened before lifting his head to look at Draco. “I still owe you an apology for my behaviour last week. I realise that I’ve neglected you just as much and I’m sorry. How are you holding up?”
“I’m worried that either of you will turn your backs on me. Yes, I’m scared that the Weasleys won’t see me as part of their family anymore, but I’m also afraid that if
at that, it hadn’t taken him half as long as it should have. Merlin have mercy on him trying to parent that boy. The door opened slowly and Harry’s black-haired head peaked inside. He caught Remus’ eyes and a smile spread on his face. If he had been able to, Remus would’ve rolled his eyes. He also would’ve had to fight pretty hard to suppress a smile. Merlin have mercy on him. Opening the door further, Harry moved to slip inside the room, only to be held back by a pale hand around his wrist.
It took several minutes to unpack all the packages filled with Muggle clothing, and Draco had to admit that some of it looked like even he could consider wearing it. In the corner of his eye, he saw Weasley staring at his mother incredulously.
Even though he was fairly sure none of his current house mates knew about the hidden rooms, he threw the strongest locking charm he knew at the door, along with a silencing charm just for good measure. Breathing deeply, he tried to clear his mind, to sort the millions of jumbled thoughts racing through his brain.
“You are such a—ridiculously—sappy—Gryffindor.” Draco accentuated every word with a kiss and Harry laughed against his lips. “Thank you,” whispered Draco, holding Harry’s face between his hands, holding his gaze intently. “They’re absolutely brilliant and I can’t believe you didn’t tell me about it earlier.”
“Who is it, Harry?” Mrs Weasley prodded gently, although there was some apprehension in her eyes, as if she wasn’t sure whether she really wanted to know.
As a result, he had arrived more than half an hour earlier than they’d planned to meet, which was just as well in case Harry was done earlier with his “lesson” with Dumbledore — whatever those were about. The first ten minutes or so, he’d even tried to work on his Transfiguration essay. He’d checked the clock approximately twenty times in those ten minutes. Eventually, he’d given up and resorted to pacing unceasingly from desk to bed and from the bed back to the desk instead.
“You yelled at him, called him ‘boy’ like his disgusting relatives used to,” Draco snapped. “He barely recognised me for a good five minutes, not breathing properly, before I finally got him to focus on me.”
Definitely not the impression of a fifteen year old boy. Without answering again, Severus apparated straight out of Grimmauld Place and into Malfoy Manor.
Draco glanced at Harry, as if asking for permission. Harry sighed and nodded, better to get it over with. Draco turned back towards Severus with a rather murderous expression.
After Harry indicated that he was ready, they began their lesson. Compared to the disaster during the last school year, these practices went extraordinarily well. Harry had made rather rapid progress with emptying his mind, now that he’d been given a proper method to do so. He almost felt that he liked it. Within minutes, he reached that relaxed, empty state of mind. In the past several days, Severus had begun to sparingly use Legilimency again, while he was in that state. For the most part he managed to keep him out, and to his pleasant surprise, Severus didn’t pry whenever he failed. Instead, he simply withdrew if he breached through Harry’s defences, never letting any memories play out fully, or any emotions surface in full force. Harry wondered how much of that was due to Severus’ own apprehension to learn something about Harry’s thoughts about
“Not a word about Sirius, do you hear me? Harry is incredibly generous to let us stay here, you will not taunt him with his grief,” Narcissa lectured, and Harry had to suppress a smile. Maybe it wouldn’t be all that bad with her here to control her brat child.
“Gods, I’m so close, fuck, Draco! I’m gonna come,” Harry rasped, tugging lightly on Draco’s hair to pull him off, much like Draco had done to him back on the train.
He wondered whether Slughorn had invited him as well. Probably. No, most certainly; Harry was likely at the top of the list for a man like Slughorn. But Harry knew how to manoeuvre such people now, he had learnt a lot this summer, talking to Draco’s mother and Severus. Still, he knew that Harry despised the idea of being collected like that, and Draco had to admit he could empathise with that aversion. Perhaps he should be glad that Slughorn shunned him due to his father’s criminal activities. Maybe he should go and interrupt their little get-together, enable Harry’s escape, and, ideally, snag the man on the way out and hide in a corner somewhere with him.
Unfortunately, Draco’s good mood began to falter during lunch when his apprehension of the impending confrontation with Harry’s friends returned in full force. As optimistic as he was trying to be about it, there was very little chance of this afternoon going over without at least one mishap, and Draco could only hope that it wouldn’t be his fault.
Severus’ nimble fingers were already working their way down Remus’ shirt, undoing button after button and revealing his marred chest. For a moment he watched Severus’ reaction, waiting for a sign of disgust or for him to put an end to the whole thing, but none of it happened. He didn’t seem to care at all. Satisfied that Severus wouldn’t suddenly jump away from him in horror, Remus turned his attention to removing Severus’ robes. It was tedious work, and Remus was tempted to simply
Dumbledore gave him a kind smile. “Let us not venture into this endeavour with a preliminary negative attitude. Besides, there is no rush to learn — so long as your defences are firmly in place, the connection will simply be irrelevant.”
“Wicked,” Ron beamed. Apparently the twins’ shop had distracted him sufficiently to drop the subject of Harry’s relationship for now. Hermione rolled her eyes and shot Harry a significant look.
doing here?” came the snide response from a seventh year Gryffindor glaring at the group of Slytherins.
Draco felt an unreasonable surge of jealousy at that and he hoped to Merlin it didn’t show on his face. How could he be jealous of someone who had
“He gave me his word to inform you, I figured you’d know by now. Over a month ago, he came to Grimmauld Place with a nasty curse in his hand, spreading fast. He would’ve been dead within days—maybe even hours—if I hadn’t been able to temporarily contain it in his hand. When I informed him that it would spread eventually, he insisted that I have to kill him before this curse does. He listed a number of reasons, none of which was completely convincing if I’m completely honest, but I agreed eventually—on the condition that he informed you.”
Harry pushed the wrappings aside, revealing a smooth leather cover and a small wooden box. Eyes shining, he flipped open the box and promptly furrowed his brows in confusion. Draco chuckled.
“Harry, despite what you may believe, I loved your mother. We were…involved with each other during our time at Hogwarts, through fourth and most of fifth year. We kept it very private and we never— When Lily and I broke apart, it was more than just a friendship that ended. It wasn’t until after her death that I even began to move on emotionally, but the love never truly faded, it just changed with time.”
She laughed. “Consider it an early birthday gift. Now, shall we finish this wall before I go and make dinner?”
Severus laughed again. “They are certainly rather headstrong,” he agreed. “So, Bovin and Bricks? I don’t really see it, but I see neither with anyone else either. I say Yule, if even.”
“Of course, we give as good as we get. It’s a vicious cycle, because anything we do to defend ourselves just reinforces their belief that all Slytherins are blood-supremacists waiting to join the Dark Lord. And unfortunately they’re not even completely wrong with it. Slytherin house is full of pure-blooded Death Eater children who, like me, have grown up with blood-supremacy drilled into them.” Draco sighed. “It is what it is.”
He put his ladle down with a grin. His Drought of Living Death was perfect and he knew it; as did Hermione, judging by her put-out expression.
At this rate, it had barely taken a day for the idea to take root, nagging at the back of Harry’s mind, reminding him that Draco had been there before Cedric already, too, that he’d always been drawn to him even if it had presented maliciously, and that now he was technically
He described the vision Voldemort had sent him, how they had tried to reach Sirius through the Floo but came up with nothing. Then he went on to recall how Umbridge had captured them with her Inquisitorial Squad, which caused Draco to blush furiously again—it had happened several times during Harry’s stories, whenever he’d been involved in a way he now regretted.
The room they had repurposed as a potions lab was clouded in steam. A large counter, transfigured from a desk, stood right in the middle to be accessible from all sides. The walls were lined with shelves filled with ingredients in countless vials, jars, bowls and bottles, along with an impressive collection of finished potions, carefully labelled in Severus’ sleek writing and sorted by purpose and alphabet.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, Sirius did a thorough job with remodelling. Narcissa isn’t half bad at it either, we’ve been going through the rest of the bedrooms on the second floor. Two are already done, so technically we could even house guests.”
that when Albus told us about the charms?!” Lupin had found his voice again, sounding seriously agitated now.
For a long moment they just stared at each other, and Severus knew he must look just as eager as Remus. But there was more to discuss before he could give in to the desire to slam the man into a wall and undress him with his teeth.
Narcissa had taken to casting basic healing spells over the cuts, with very little success. While some of the wounds seemed to at least close a little, the biggest ones across his chest were utterly unaffected. Blood started to drip from the edge of the table and pooled on the floor, soaking Harry’s socks.
“Well, since you seem unlikely to attack each other the moment I leave you alone, I shall be returning to Hogwarts now,” he announced briskly. “Don’t forget to do your exercise this evening, Potter, I’ll be back tomorrow for another lesson. Narcissa.” He inclined his head towards her, then promptly spun around and left, his robes billowing behind him.
Harry shot Ron a grateful look, but the red-head was focused entirely on Hermione who was now turning to him, shrieking, “Dark arts are corrupted! They impact you over time until you eventually succumb to them. Do you want Harry to end up like Voldemort, twisted and evil?”
Remus eyed him sceptically, but didn’t argue. They worked quietly for a few minutes until Severus was completely free of blood, before Narcissa levitated him slowly up the stairs into his room. Harry stopped in the doorway as she settled him on the bed, spelling clean pyjamas on him and covering him with a blanket. He looked so peaceful now, not a trace of the bloodbath left. Narcissa nudged Harry out of the room and closed the door behind her.
“You are a marvellous young man, Harry,” she said, as she slowly got to her feet, swaying slightly. Both Harry and Severus quickly jumped up to steady her, leading her to a chair and forcing her to sit down. She smirked at them.
Harry was looking around curiously, as if he was cataloguing everything he could see; fireplace and sitting area to the left, kitchen and dining table to the right, a tall window looking out into the lake between two curved walls, each with a door leading to one of the two bedrooms respectively. At the sound of the door clicking shut, though, he abandoned his exploration immediately in favour of reaching out to Draco.
to produce a Patronus. That’s highly advanced magic—N.E.W.T. level magic—and he successfully taught third years. Say what you will, but he seems to be a competent teacher.”
Also, if Ao3 fucks up the formatting I will cry. By the time you read this I may have cried. (I cried, look how much prettier they would be if Ao3 let me!)
“That was a good one,” he said happily as he reached out to Remus to heal his injuries. “The surroundings are far more interesting — turn your head, thanks — to work with than our backyard. I think they liked it.”
“Harry?” he hissed under his breath. His bracelet pulsed and the invisible hand around his wrist tightened. Of course Harry would sneak around under his damn Invisibility Cloak.
A warm feeling spread through Draco’s chest, easing some of his tension. It wasn’t that he didn’t already know that Harry trusted him, he simply liked hearing it out loud. In front of everyone.
Instead of sitting down, Harry busied himself with putting the kettle on, as Narcissa and Snape settled at the table.
Harry hadn’t spoken much with Severus since their conversation about the prophecy, although their Occlumency lessons continued to go rather well. His anger towards the man had cooled down, partially due to Draco’s continued stories about growing up with Severus as a godfather. It helped Harry reconcile the man he knew with the man who was trying to be his father. It helped Harry find some trust in Severus. Still, it would take some time until they breached personal topics again.
In front of the drawing room, he paused. The door was open and the room seemed…empty? Had he seriously missed Potter going upstairs in those two minutes he’d been down in the kitchen?
“Sorry,” they mumbled, and Harry gave them a gracious nod. He didn’t want to fight with them, he just wished they could accept that he was capable of making his own decisions.
“Of course they are, why wouldn’t they be? I guess we’ll just have to deal with more people out shopping then. But hey, at least it’ll be safer in a larger crowd, right?”
He found Harry in his room watching Draco, as the Slytherin meticulously arranged a mountain of clothes in Harry’s closet. Looking Harry up and down, Remus had to admit that their shopping spree had certainly given Harry a new look that suited him rather well. He looked comfortable and confident, which wasn’t something Remus could observe in the youth as much as he would’ve liked. When Harry noticed him, a wide smile appeared on his face.
into his room and refused to come out since. Not a particularly good sign. Actually, a rather horrible sign, given how Gryffindors were supposed to be brave and all that.
The thought made Severus uncomfortable. They considered Harry their child, both of them. What claim did he really have on Harry amidst experienced mothers and with all his negative history with Harry? Perhaps Molly’s attitude towards him wasn’t entirely unfounded.
Harry laughed and shifted closer to Draco, pulling him against his chest. Despite his still raging embarrassment, Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“Shall we go somewhere more comfortable?” he suggested, aware that he sounded more formal than he would’ve liked.
today and suddenly it feels like there’s no time at all. We’re at war. I’m the fucking Chosen One, even though I never wanted to be, and everyone expects me to go and kill off Voldemort like the bloody hero that they think I am, that I’m supposed to be.”
part of him must have accepted Severus as his father, otherwise he would never have done that. Right?
With a groan, Draco rolled onto his back, away from Harry, staring at the ceiling. Harry didn’t push further, he simply waited, propped up on one elbow, the other arm on Draco’s chest, where Draco immediately began playing with Harry’s fingers.
His potion had turned paler than anyone else’s by now, with the exception of Draco’s which looked almost as perfect as Harry’s. Was he about to let Draco win the Felix Felicis just so he could inspect this book?
He was aware that it was a desperate, unrealistic thought, but he couldn’t just give up. Dozens of spells and forms he’d read about since finding the healing books in the hidden library raced through his brain, jumbling over each other. It felt like someone had put his thoughts in a blender. He needed clarity. He needed the book.
Remus gave him an odd look, but didn’t comment on his admission. He shook his head. “I’m sure, Harry. Even if Sirius was bisexual instead of gay, he’d never have slept with Lily around the time you were conceived.”
“You wouldn’t. So, that makes me think you actually did have an affair with Lily. Is Harry your son? Do you
“At least her meddling seems to have generally positive outcomes, as opposed to Albus’ schemes,” Remus chuckled.
The compartment door opened again and a group of fourth-year girls stood outside, the one in the front, a brazen-looking girl with long black hair and large dark eyes, levelling a calculating look at Neville.
At Harry’s glare, he quickly raised both his hands in the air defensively. “I’m not going to insist on a conversation you don’t want to have, relax. Just hear me out, please.”
They didn’t do much for the rest of the evening, Harry keeping his head buried in a book Draco hadn’t seen before. It appeared to be on charms. Not a subject Harry had seemed to be overly interested in so far, but Draco knew better than to question him about it when he was hyper-focused, which he obviously was. He barely took his eyes off the thing until Draco finally got up and declared that he’d be taking a shower—and even then, all he got was a quick peck before Harry’s attention went right back to whatever charm he was studying so intently.
“First of all, I’d like to apologise for how I’ve treated you and your friends in class, as well as outside of class while at Hogwarts. While I do have reasons for my attitude towards some students, I know that it doesn’t excuse that I’ve treated you all unfairly.”
By the end of second year Draco couldn’t ignore anymore that he disagreed with his father’s ideologies. The desire to please him hadn’t lessened in the least, despite Draco’s inner conflict. So he’d kept up his perfect pure-blood mask, his air of superiority, his shield of hostility; kept everyone out, denying that he didn’t really want to be like this at all. He had teased and bullied, out of jealousy and desperation, hoping his father would eventually be satisfied.
He didn’t have time to dwell on the thought, though, since Potter had closed the door and was now coming up behind him, sneaking an arm around Draco’s waist again and pressing soft kisses to the back of his neck. For the at-least-twelfth time since finding Potter in the kitchen, Draco
“Narcissa, why don’t you pick a bedroom? We can sit down and talk after Potter and I are done,” he said, before turning towards Harry. “We will begin your lessons immediately, follow me.”
The third floor was taken up by his own rooms and one much smaller bedroom, as well as a small bathroom. There wasn’t much to see here, although Harry enjoyed the countless books in the shelf along the wall next to the fireplace. He picked several of them up and leafed through the pages, undecided which he should read. Eventually, he decided to get back to that once he’d explored the rest of the house.
He got out of bed and turned towards his trunk to pull out fresh clothes, before quickly getting showered and brushing his teeth. His stomach was rumbling. Time for breakfast, no matter what hour it actually was.
The next half hour was spent wildly speculating about possible purposes of Voldemort’s family heirlooms, but none of their theories felt right to Harry. Somehow he was sure he’d recognise the truth if they stumbled upon it, regardless of how ridiculous that thought was.
“You’re right, Potter used to be a mirror image of James. Now that those charms are gone, he’s bound to display more of Lily’s characteristics, isn’t he? Lily’s and whoever his real father is, of course. Could it be that you saw Lily in him for the first time and now are struggling to match that to your previous opinion of him?”
“Contineo,” murmured Severus, pointing his wand at the blackened hand. “What caused this? Albus? What triggered this curse?” Severus’ tone was urgent, and Harry began to grow worried.
Harry’s heart did a little flip at the word, as he let Draco guide him up the stairs and into the drawing room, where he was manoeuvred to sit on a big couch, Draco settling down next to him. Draco was still holding Harry’s hand to his chest. How had they managed the stairs like that?
As expected, Draco did not look pleased. He caught himself quickly though, and Harry could virtually watch his mask slide into place, turning him into the cold, haughty Malfoy heir.
“See, that reaction is exactly why we have to talk about this,” Harry sighed. “I know you don’t like them much, but they’re still my friends. The Weasleys are practically family, they took me in when I had nowhere to go that summer after first year. I—” He hesitated. “I want to tell them about us. I’ll have to tell them about Severus either way, what’s one more surprise? I just— I don’t like keeping secrets from them. Besides, Hermione would probably figure it out in no time, the woman misses nothing.”
Severus nodded and Harry turned his attention to the deep gashes in his chest. As he lifted his wand, Severus’ hand closed around his wrist, tugging at it.
“I did tell you everything,” Dumbledore replied, unfazed. “Everything I know, at least. What I am about to show you is not
“Mum and Dad are just outside with Tonks,” answered Ginny. “The Ministry caught wind that you’ll be accompanying us and insisted on having an Auror battalion coming with—Dad somehow managed to talk it down so it’s just Tonks.”
continue to view me as one of them, the sort-of family that has been forming here will just…dissolve. What if Remus thinks that I’m better off with Mrs Weasley to act as my guardian, what if he realises that he doesn’t
already, but truly obliterating Dementors was a task usually left to specialised Hit-Wizards. It didn’t bode well for the light side of this war.
“So, there are two things: first of all he wants me to learn Legilimency — that’s not the secretive one, though.”
Potter didn’t hex him. Instead, he set his jaw angrily and tried to shove Draco out of the way. Prepared this time, Draco managed to push him back into the kitchen. When it came to physical strength, they had always been quite evenly matched—if Draco wasn’t taken by surprise that is. Draco could only hope that all those changes Potter had gone through didn’t include a sudden increase in muscle tone.
The slight shift in position brought Draco’s hardness that had been pressing into Harry’s hip right into alignment with Harry’s own erection and the sudden unexpected heat and friction had his eyes flying open with a gasp, followed by a deep moan he couldn’t possibly have held back. Instinctively his body sought more of it, his hips grinding upwards. Draco met him halfway and they both groaned, breaking their kiss.
There have also been minor changes throughout the fic to fix/unify formatting, correct typos/grammar and in rare occasions adjust the wording a little. Again, no content changes.
Draco cut himself off before he could finish that thought. No use in entertaining impossible pipe-dreams.
“Floo-call your mother, Draco. Tell her to get ready to leave as soon as I’m back. If everything goes well, I can bring Narcissa to a safe place tonight.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but spoke the first incantation without hesitation. Snape followed suit, conjuring forth his own magical signature.
“Let’s go out,” he proposed, earning himself an incredulous glance from Harry. “Don’t give me that look, we’ve been cooped up in this house for weeks—you even longer than me. As much as this place—and its inhabitants, one in particular—is growing on me, it’s time to go see the outside world again. Seeing how much taller you are than before, you’ll need new robes either way, so how about we go shopping? I need some new dress robes too, and your sweater looks awfully worn.”
“And because you look like him,” Draco supplied, earning himself a glare from both Harry and Narcissa.
“There you are, mate!” he exclaimed. “We’ve been looking all over for you, Hermione is going spare soon. I just wanted to get your map to find you.”
“I can’t believe you,” Draco muttered eventually, looking awfully put out. But his outrage at Gryffindors breaking into the Slytherin common room was quickly forgotten, when Harry recounted entering the Chamber to find Ginny, meeting sixteen year old Voldemort, still going by the name of Tom Riddle. All blood seemed to drain from Draco’s face when Harry told how he’d fought the Basilisk with the help of a phoenix and a sword out of a hat, how he’d been bitten by the Basilisk and how he’d destroyed the diary with the its tooth, thinking it would be the last thing he’d ever do. Seeing Draco’s expression, Harry quickly moved to grab his boyfriend’s hand to reassure him that he was still very much alive. Both Draco and Narcissa scowled when he told them about Lucius’ involvement in all those events, confirming his suspicion that they had known nothing about it.
anymore. So, Draco joined Harry’s daily duelling training with Remus, and Harry followed Draco into the lab to keep him company while he brewed Merlin knew what for his hair, only to have Severus talk him into going over the sixth year curriculum in Potions. Apparently their new teacher, Horace Slughorn, accepted N.E.W.T. students with an Exceeds Expectations in their O.W.L. exams, which meant that Harry could continue the subject after all.
Running a hand over his face he leaned back in his chair and mentally went over the past week. Three Order meetings, all prompted by Death Eater attacks on public places. Moody was planning raids, Kingsley was trying to gather more support in the Ministry but was met with resistance at every turn. And apparently Rufus Scrimgeour, Fudge’s successor and the new Minister of Magic, was looking for Harry. Remus thanked the gods that they had Grimmauld Place under a Fidelius charm, Harry didn’t need any more nonsense to deal with. Especially since Severus had suddenly decided to retreat back into his shell completely.
Snape regarded him for a moment, then nodded. “You successfully occluded for a moment, effectively shutting yourself out of your own mind. The goal is for you to be able to achieve the same barrier without shutting down your sensory perception.” He gave Harry an appraising look. “It appears this method works for you. Continue this exercise every evening.”
Whenever he came across Potter, though, his boredom fell away. While it was slow-going, he could see that Potter’s self-control was wavering.
Harry was infinitely glad that Hermione didn’t know about his “conquered” inheritances, or he’d never hear the end of it.
Blaise gave her a lazy look from where he sat on the couch. “Leave him be if he doesn’t want to. More for us,” he said with a shrug and wiggled the bottle of firewhisky at Pansy, before pouring himself a glass.
over the surface. Narcissa levitated Severus into the room, gently lowering him on the table, Draco hovering anxiously at her side. Despite the stasis charms, blood was still spilling freely from the deep gashes in Severus’ chest.
After he got out of the dress robes and exited the fitting room again, he found his mother already at the register, ordering Harry’s clothes to be packed up and prepared for pickup, so she could summon Kreacher to take them back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was hovering behind her, fiddling with his coin pouch. He looked anxious, and it dawned on Draco that he was probably questioning whether he had retrieved enough gold for such a large purchase. Draco went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder, which made him flinch a bit.
As soon as the last of the threads was gone, Severus let go of Narcissa’s arm, waving his wand one final time as he finished with another incantation. Narcissa was still panting, but she seemed to be able to breathe normally again.
The headmaster gave him a tired smile, before his eyes flickered to Severus, who had followed Harry downstairs.
“Voldemort is a half-blood?!” It was the first thing Draco could think of, but even as the words left his mouth he realised how stupid it was, compared to all the other information Harry had just thrown at him. To his relief, Harry chuckled.
“You are a marvel, Harry,” Draco purred, sliding one leg between Harry’s, supporting himself with one arm and letting his other hand trail down Harry’s chest, over his stomach, until it hit the waistband of his pants. Harry’s breath caught again and this time he held it, every nerve in his body on high alert, his entire focus on Draco’s feather light touch trailing the skin right at the edge of the fabric.
After pouring himself a glass of firewhisky, he settled into his favourite armchair in the living room of his quarters. Staring into the flames that danced in the fireplace, he replayed the day in his mind. It had gone remarkably well, much better than he had anticipated. Narcissa had convinced Potter to let her and Draco stay with ease, nobody had been hexed, and the wolf hadn’t been there at all. Nevertheless, Severus felt decidedly unsettled by his visit to Grimmauld Place; the main reason being Potter. Of course. It was always Potter, wasn‘t it?
“I think this is enough for today,” announced Dumbledore. “We shall continue to practice next time. For now, we must move on to the other purpose for these lessons.”
Within barely fifteen minutes, they had changed into their flying gear and were ready to go. Remus apparated them to a forest that looked suspiciously similar to the one where the World Cup had been two years prior. Indeed, he confirmed Draco’s thoughts just a moment later, explaining that the Muggle-repelling magic still lingered, which made it easy to double up on the charms and thus make it near-impossible for them to be detected. He even produced a practice-Snitch and a rather battered looking Quaffle and transfigured three large tree branches into makeshift goal-hoops before settling down on a conjured chair with a book as Draco and Harry took to the air.
“I don’t like secrets, Severus,” the Dark Lord whispered and Severus blinked. When had he come so close? Had he blacked out? He couldn’t afford to black out, couldn’t risk to lower his mental defences for even a second. He forced himself back into awareness, trying to ignore the intensifying pain as it hit him again with full force without any haze to protect his senses.
“Your mind is still recovering from the Dark Lord’s possession of you. It would be utterly pointless to have you attempt that now,” he drawled.
your own clothes that fit you and it’s a shame that this should be the first time for you to get some.”
“I will bring them either way, I have no use for them any longer. They’ll make an excellent addition to the Black library, even if you never touch them. You owe me nothing in return, neither material, nor your time or consideration. Although I would gladly spend more time with you, so we could try to salvage something of our rather unfortunate relationship so far, I would never demand it of you, and I would certainly not try to bribe you. I merely hope that you’ll find the books useful, I remember that I certainly did.”
Draco had meanwhile recovered enough from Harry’s announcement to give Ron his signature Malfoy-eyebrow and drawled, “Yes, Ronald, this is my room. Problem?”
I hope you enjoyed this round of feel-good Drarry, because I'm afraid it's downhill from here and that hill is steep.
After a few beats of silence, Harry noticed how much calmer he felt. He couldn’t help but smile. To be surrounded by supportive people sure was something he could get used to.
if I couldn’t have you—then I at least needed my father’s approval. Not that I hadn’t been desperate for his approval before, but it somehow just…played itself up more and more.”
“Follow me, I’ll show you to your room. You could of course choose another one, but there’s only one left that’s actually cleaned, so—” Lupin trailed off.
He kept pacing, silently cursing the room for deliberately misinterpreting him. Without a clock to check, he started to count his rounds. Bed to desk, one; desk to bed, two; bed to desk, three …
Remus chuckled. “It would certainly be a welcome change from Order meetings and boredom. We’ll have to get Albus’ approval though.”
“I was wondering whether I could join your demonstration of the Wolfsbane potion, you mentioned it at breakfast,” Draco said smoothly, flashing Severus his best winning smile.
) has agreed to draw floor plans of Grimmauld Place. They're still very much in progress, but shall be included as necessary. For now, here's the fourth floor:
“Good evening, Harry. Please, have a seat,” replied Dumbledore, gesturing at a comfortable looking chair in front of his desk. “Right on time. Have you started well into the new term?”
Severus cleared his throat and the boys looked up with matching embarrassed smiles. Rolling his eyes, he made his way over to Sirona.
“Oh, wait, one more thing: The DA starts on Wednesday at seven thirty in the Room of Requirement,” he told Remus, just as he’d been about to put the mirror down.
Earlier in the week they’d already had half a fight because Harry had to tell her not to stare at Draco so obviously. She hadn’t taken it particularly well.
“Has nobody taught you to respect your superiors, Potter? What’s the hurry, afraid to be out in the real world away from Dumbledore’s golden cage?” He paused, twisting his expression into an arrogant sneer. “By Merlin, Blaise didn’t exaggerate. What’s with your face, ran into a wall and smashed it?”
“Well done, cub, you’ve won the last ten matches,” Remus praised, rubbing his chest where the stunner had hit him.
In the short vacuum of conversation, Hermione rounded on Harry immediately, demanding, “Harry, I would like that explanation now.”
It took every bit of Draco’s self-control not to dive for it immediately. If Harry’s privacy charms really worked the way he intended, his friends shouldn’t even have heard the chime. True enough, none of them seemed to have noticed anything, except the fact that he’d stopped talking all of a sudden.
“Hermione said they’d be coming a little after lunch, so I’m guessing around two o’clock?” Harry replied with the tiniest smile.
“I beg to differ, my dear Severus, it is a rather splendid idea,” Albus insisted, staying infuriatingly calm. “With Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban, you are Voldemort’s closest advisor, but his trust in you is not as deep as it should be. Once I am gone, Voldemort will undoubtedly try to take over Hogwarts. I need you there to protect the students.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said suddenly, breaking the silence. “I’m not exactly sure what to say, I’m afraid I’m not very exciting company.”
Seeing that Harry hadn’t put up a new shield, Severus shot three stunners in quick succession, hoping that one would find its target. None did. Instead, they suddenly seemed to
“Maybe I should go to Italy,” Pansy mused dreamily, “find me a smart firecracker like Gia and settle down as a housewife for her.”
Severus nodded and Remus was about to get up and leave again, when Severus seemed to struggle with himself as if trying to say something, making Remus hesitate.
Remus just nodded. He’d make an exception in this case and just accept whatever she’d done. He didn’t need to know. All he cared about was that they got what they deserved.
Two and a half hours later Remus pushed open the door to Severus’ quarters. The rest of the lesson had gone swimmingly, but even though Remus had barely had anything to do except occasionally assisting a few younger students, he was mentally exhausted.
At this point, Draco had given up on earning his father’s approval, settling for protecting his own life instead; over night, obedience hadn’t been a choice anymore but a matter of survival. Vague hints at Draco taking the Mark “soon” had loomed over his head constantly. There was not a shred of doubt in Draco’s mind that his father would’ve handed him over to the Dark Lord to do with as he pleased without hesitation, should the Dark Lord have demanded it.
Snape’s lips all but disappeared as he pressed them firmly together, clearly biting back some snarky answer.
Harry smiled and nodded and let Draco treat the rest of his scars he’d gotten from trying to reach the stove when he was still way too small to cook.
“Don’t be, you only did what we agreed on. It’s just— You’re a good actor.” He tried to smile but it felt like a grimace.
“May I see?” Harry asked curiously, and Draco could relate to the sentiment. He was itching to see that scroll for himself, too. Burgock handed the scroll to Harry, who unrolled it and held it out so Draco could read as well. For a split second, Draco was distracted by Harry’s automatic consideration to include him, it made him feel all sorts of weird and soft. However, when Harry suddenly gasped, his eyes flew back to the scroll and he began to read.
“Because!” Harry half-shouted, jumping to his feet. “Because maybe I’m just so bloody desperate for a family that— Oh I don’t know, it just is.”
“He doesn’t have a licence, I’m afraid, and we really should be getting home,” Remus replied. He held out his arm for Harry to grab on to.
To his relief, they didn’t have to linger in the corridor for long, as Severus opened the door to the classroom to let them in with a cold command, “Inside.”
He couldn’t keep the sarcasm out of his tone entirely, as much as he tried to, and Hermione’s eyes narrowed slightly.
“You looked like you were about to either hex something or have a breakdown. I’ve known you all your life, Draco, you can’t lie to me.”
She raised an eyebrow at him. “Oh? And who would that be?” she asked, just as the sound of steps echoed from the stairs and Potter came into the entrance hall.
Does he know? Does he know you kneel to the monster who killed his mother? Shouldn’t fathers fucking
The only warning Harry got were soft steps on the stairs before Remus entered, closely followed by Snape. He must’ve stayed at Grimmauld Place overnight.
. Once more, Harry cursed himself for his poor choice of electives back in third year. Frantically, he memorised the pattern, tracing the runes over and over on his thigh. He’d need to draw them directly on Severus’ skin.
“If you had deigned to answer the first two times I knocked, I wouldn’t have had to get your attention like that,” Harry retorted. “Why didn’t you come down for dinner? Or lunch or breakfast?”
Also, unlike most fics, I wanted them to act somewhat realistic and actually talk about their relationship pretty straight away—it always strikes me as a bit weird if they avoid that for weeks to prolong the slow-burn (I at least could never do that IRL, so I won't write it like that either). Ergo: This is not a slow-burn, because I'm not a slow-burn kinda person. Yay, ADHD and zero impulse-control.
Severus nodded, his eyes full of pity that Draco didn’t want. He could keep his pity, Draco wanted to be with Harry. Really be with Harry, not sneaking around in secluded corridors and empty classrooms. Not that he would mind getting Harry into an empty classroom, but that was supposed to be
“Don’t even say it,” Harry interrupted her. “This is not your fault. You wanted the best for me, I was just too scared to bloody well tell him myself.”
All of a sudden, Potter’s grip on Draco’s waist tightened as he briefly broke the kiss, and before Draco could react Potter had spun them around, switching their positions and trapping Draco between himself and the wall instead. Draco’s heart must’ve skipped several beats, because when Potter’s mouth met his again, he felt decidedly dizzy.
. Severus didn’t believe that for a single second. He had to admit, however, that the castle’s magic was incredibly flexible and—to a certain degree—could understand where the rumours originated. Hogwarts’ magic had a tendency to be…wilful.
Ron’s cheeks reddened. “What? No, mate, that’s yours. I can afford my own, I just have to order it.”
The crowd moved, and Remus followed Harry against the stream and over to the outdoor landscape, the mass of students never touching either of them as if they were pushed away like same-poled magnets, creating a little bubble around them. Harry drew up a ward behind them once they reached the natural terrain, shielding the crowd from any stray spells.
Remus laughed and shook his head. “No, nothing went up in flames. Harry did make the ground explode under my feet, though. You should have words with your son about knocking over the elderly.”
Pushing those thoughts away firmly, he made his way down into the kitchen, where Narcissa was already preparing breakfast.
Draco smothered a laugh. He knew it’d been a good idea to give Harry his first present in the privacy of their room—well, Harry’s room, although Draco barely ever went back to his own at this point and practically all his clothes had found a place in Harry’s closet—simply because he knew how adamant his mother could be about proper manners. He watched amusedly as Severus began an argument against her insistence to have Harry unpack all his gifts with everyone present, and was promptly shut down before he could even finish his sentence. At least Severus knew better than trying to push her and relented with a resigned sigh.
“No, you don’t understand,” Severus insisted. “Whoever this is, even though I am loath to admit it, they’re likely to be in Slytherin house. They will share your common room, Draco, perhaps even your dormitory. If your relationship becomes public, you will immediately become the golden ticket to Harry. You’d be a target, whether that be because you’re seen as a traitor or to use you to get to Harry—you’d be a target either way. Even as your Head of House I can not guarantee your safety around the clock.”
The girl turned and her large, dewy eyes widened. “Is that you Harry? My, you sure look different,” she said in her typical dreamy voice. “Neville, look! It’s Harry!”
Remus took a deep breath. “Harry, both your appearance and your magical signature were charmed to resemble James Potter. Now that these charms were stripped down, the resemblance is gone.”
. Where did you even sleep? You didn’t go to the Slytherin dorms, did you?” Her eyes were wide, as though entering the Slytherin dorms would be the pinnacle of everything scandalous in the world.
Harry frowned. Then he thought about it further and grudgingly admitted, “He probably just had enough of so many Weasleys.”
Draco groaned and shot Harry a glare, but eventually rolled off the mattress and disappeared in the bathroom. Harry’s bathroom. He had to suppress a smile. Of course Draco had immediately started to use his much larger and more luxurious bathroom once he’d been given the option. Over the past week a startling number of bottles and vials had found their way into the shower, onto the shelf above the sink and the edge of the large bathtub. Harry hadn’t touched any of them, unsure of whether he truly wanted to risk that.
Forcing all thoughts of James Potter out of his mind, Severus began his demonstration. For the following hours, his focus was on this potion alone, occasionally answering additional questions from either Draco or Harry, who both seemed to be able to follow quite well. They had just gotten to the last part of the brewing process, in which the potion had to simmer for a full hour, being stirred at the exact right intervals in the right direction, before the final ingredient would be added all at the end, when a sharp pain flared up in Severus’ left arm.
“I was literally there when he asked you about it.” Severus fought to keep the irritation out of his voice.
—but at least they had each other. Just to have someone close, to feel someone. The wolf inside him protested that sentiment, but Remus stubbornly insisted that it would at least help a
Once more, chattering filled the hall, except now it was clear that the predominant sentiment was excitement instead of apprehension. Albus waited patiently for the students to calm down before he went on.
At two minutes to midnight, Harry suddenly stood, earning a startled look from Draco as he stalked over to the window and opened it.
“My apologies,” he said, gesturing towards the other armchair. “I did not feel like exposing myself to the tumult of the castle right before the holidays, but if you’d like to join me here I can pour you a glass.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, then turned and took position opposite Severus without a word, wand raised. A malicious smirk spread on Severus’ face, and Draco had to remind himself that this was an act.
Severus barely spared him a glance when he joined him in the lab, moving around the neatly organised station Severus was working at to set up his own further down the counter.
, but I can not grasp it. As if it’d all become clear if someone just told me what I’m trying to remember.”
The silence that followed seemed to stretch indefinitely. When Draco spoke eventually, his voice was smaller, almost pleading.
“It’s hard, I know. But if it’s any consolation, your little performance at the gate was remarkable. If I hadn’t known, I would’ve believed it was real.”
He dressed himself quickly, before settling down on his bed with a book to distract himself. Thank Merlin, it worked. About an hour later, Remus felt calm again, able to rationalise the situation. Severus had been startled, Remus’ mind had transferred his previous thoughts onto Severus’ reaction. It meant nothing, just an unfortunate run-in in a shared bathroom because Remus had forgotten to lock both doors.
He frowned slightly at the memory of the spell. The feeling of Potter’s magic had been strangely…familiar. Completely different from Severus’, whom Draco was much closer to. It didn’t make any sense. But this was Potter, so of course it wouldn’t make sense. Potter, who somehow had gotten even more attractive and was stupidly powerful. It really wasn’t fair how everything just seemed to
Neither of them questioned Severus’ teaching demands after that, and Harry had to admit that he rather enjoyed brewing now that he actually had a grasp on the subject.
Draco put his hands around Harry’s face and forced him to look at him, silver eyes burning with determination. “You are not an idiot. Understand? And I can’t believe that Severus doesn’t care about you at all, I
Harry nodded, his expression still full of joy after his relationship with Draco appeared to have been accepted—or at least not too openly disapproved of—by most of the Weasleys. Severus left quickly and went upstairs into his lab, where he’d hidden the basket that he had picked up earlier in the day. He tried to calm his nerves. If Harry hated it, he’d simply get him something else, he only wished that he didn’t have to do this in front of quite so many people.
He leaned forward and offered his hand to Severus, who only hesitated a moment before taking it firmly. A slight shudder went through Remus as their palms met, Severus’ hand being far softer than he’d imagined it to be.
Harry frowned. Had he passed out? Just what kind of spells had Dumbledore done?! It took barely longer than a moment before the answer clicked into place. Dumbledore’s spells were supposed to rid Harry of any foreign magic put on him—whatever magic had been on him must’ve somehow changed his appearance.
of Snape being his biological father, he still thought it absurd to consider that— It was just absurd.
Merlin, how had they ended up like this? Just a month ago they’d been at each other’s throat, ready to literally fight each other in Umbridge’s office. Now they stood in Severus’ improvised potions lab at Grimmauld Place—Harry’s own house!—watching a simmering potion that was way too complicated for their skill-level, cuddling.
Harry gave him a crooked smile. “Alright, alright. Thanks for taking her, Dad. If the security measures are as strict as you say, there’s no way I’d be able to get her inside.”
“She swore an Unbreakable Vow not to betray anyone in this house, so you can put your wand away already,” Snape drawled.
Severus groaned. It was barely seven o’clock—open ended meant that the Weasleys could very well stay until midnight. With how much energy it required to keep up a polite mask and pretend to be sociable, he wouldn’t survive this much longer. Unless…
Severus nodded, his mind racing to try and find a solution. He couldn’t abandon the potion. If he did, all the effort that had gone into brewing over the past week would be for naught. Remus
“I suppose it makes sense for her to use the opportunity that her husband’s arrest has granted her. I’m assuming she’ll take Mr Malfoy with her once the term ends?”
“Here, I got you some robes, those should fit you fine until we get you some new ones,” he said, pushing the bundle of clothes into Harry’s arms. Harry eyed the robes somewhat sceptically, but accepted it, before turning his attention back to Remus.
Harry was careful to keep his face completely neutral as he learnt about the friendship between his mother and Snape in their early Hogwarts years, their eventual falling out and the alleged goodbye right before she‘d married James; but his insides churned uncomfortably at the implications of it all. Snape himself didn’t say a word and kept his eyes on Remus, his jaw clenched tightly. When Remus finally fell silent, the tension at the table was palpable as everyone’s eyes swivelled to Harry.
Harry stared at the letter, feeling torn. On one side, he was quite happy about his Outstanding in Defence, but thinking back he was sure he could’ve done better in Astronomy, Herbology and Potions. Perhaps even Transfiguration. He had learnt so much in just over a month since coming to Grimmauld Place, it was frustrating to know that he could’ve done so much better if— if what? If the charms had been lifted earlier? If he’d been allowed to live at Grimmauld last year already before everyone else showed up? If he had gotten away from the Dursleys over the summer in previous years? It was pointless to consider what-ifs, but it still bothered him. It bothered him almost as much as the knowledge that he could’ve done Runes and Arithmancy instead of bloody
He pulled himself together and got out of his damned armchair. It wouldn’t do any good to sit around brooding here, secluding himself.
Harry snorted. Of course the press would spin a ridiculous story like that. Then he sobered suddenly. It was a ridiculous story, except that this time they weren’t entirely wrong. The prophecy
One featherlight charm and a firm kick later, a large rock was rolling straight at Harry, gaining its weight back as Remus removed the charm. It shattered into a thousand pieces before it was even halfway to his cub. Sharp, jagged pieces which were promptly turned into ammunition, flying directly at Remus’ face.
The mention of his name pulled Remus’ attention back to Harry’s speech just as every head in the room turned to look at him. Several of the older students seemed to remember him well enough, and he was pleasantly surprised to see mostly smiling or neutral faces. Apparently him being a werewolf hadn’t completely ruined their memory of him as a teacher.
“Some of us have dignity, Parkinson,” Blaise drawled, but Draco saw the twitch of his lips that betrayed his urge to laugh.
Before his anxiety could talk him out of it, he resolutely put the pyjamas back into the drawer and simply stripped down to his pants instead before crawling into bed and casting a privacy charm in Sirona’s direction. No need for a baby snake to see…things. Potentially. Maybe.
“Thank you,” Severus murmured, getting to his feet. “That was quite an interesting technique. How did you make my spells turn against me?”
“Most Healers are proficient in a wide array of spells that can be used in a healing context, only a fraction of those spells are explicitly healing magic. It starts with simple cleansing spells to clean a wound and ends with spells that themselves border on dark arts in order to counteract certain curse damages. Healing is complex, half the spells in that book you’re reading right now aren’t per se healing magic, but they can be
Harry chewed on his lip. He had tried to find something all afternoon, but so far he’d come up with nothing satisfying.
“But if you’re wounded by a dark spell, you wouldn’t go to the curse-breaker department, you’d go to St. Mungo’s. How do they treat such things there?”
“Please, no, not the belt,” he heard himself plead. “I’ll go away I swear! Please, Uncle Vernon, not the belt, I’m sorry—”
Then again, everything had been absurd since the fight at the Ministry. Once more the thought that maybe they had accidentally messed with some old, weird magic inside the Department of Mysteries flitted through Harry’s head. Maybe they had actually fucked up reality somehow and that’s why everything was suddenly upside down.
“Fuck,” Potter muttered. Again. Draco gave a breathy laugh and rested his forehead against Potter’s, trying to catch his breath. Potter smiled, ruining that endeavour somewhat, and began to run a hand up and down Draco’s back, the other still on his waist, keeping him close.
With a sigh, he checked the time. Just a little over eight o’clock. The moon would be up soon, and if Harry’s earlier insistence was any indication, only strong wards would keep the boy from potentially risking his neck just to keep Remus company. Even though Remus trusted the Wolfsbane potion—even the dose that the boys had finalised—for the most part, there was always a risk that something went wrong. He had come close to hurting Harry once before, he didn’t intend to do it again.
Severus nodded. “It will be difficult to adjust for all of us, we’ve grown used to each other’s company.”
told him before was the reason these snakes had such potent healing abilities; prism vipers were so lethal that they were constantly healing themselves from their own venom. But Harry wasn’t worried about Sirona accidentally killing him, or anyone else. In fact, she’d taken a liking to him quite quickly, and spent most of her time coiled around Harry’s arm or neck. He had been delighted to read that, much like Occamies, adult prism vipers had the ability to shrink and grow to fit the available space, meaning that he’d be able to carry her around like that even once she grew older.
The full moon came and went with Harry spending the first few hours of Remus’ transformation at his side, until Severus sternly sent him to bed, promising to stay with Remus in his absence.
He wished he could’ve laughed, it was such a Harry thing to say. He didn’t tap his paw and slowly, a smile spread on Harry’s face.
Yet, here he was. At the summon of yet another master of his: Albus Dumbledore, who’d called a top-urgency Order meeting, summoning everyone to Hogwarts immediately. Eight faces; Remus Lupin, Minerva McGonagall, Alastor Moody and his protégé Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Arthur and Molly Weasley, and Albus himself, all staring at him.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He was still holding Narcissa, while at the same time fighting back tears and the impulse to throw himself into Severus’ arms. When Severus moved over to them and hesitantly put his arm around Harry’s shoulders he practically melted into the embrace and tears shot into his eyes, immediately spilling over his cheeks.
He held Remus’ gaze steadily, hoping that whatever he saw would convince him to let Harry go. It did. As soon as Remus stepped aside with a resigned sigh, Harry bolted out of the kitchen and fled back into the hidden library.
The man smiled and rolled his eyes, before bidding them goodbye and disappearing up the stairs. Draco made to follow Harry into his room, but was pushed out resolutely. Although he respected Harry’s boundaries, he couldn’t help but pout a little disappointedly, at Harry’s stubborn unwillingness to change in front of him. It wasn’t the first time Harry had made him leave or left himself, just to change a shirt, while Harry had seen
“Huh,” said Ron, looking a bit baffled. “I suppose that does make sense. It’s just so ruddy complicated.”
It took Narcissa all of five minutes to put Harry’s fears to rest. Conquering heir to a house meant that he’d earned the title by combat — which sort of made sense, seeing how he’d technically defeated Voldemort when he’d been one year old. It also explained why the titles were disputed now that Voldemort was back alive.
Being bound to Draco Malfoy was inconvenient, yes, but he did rather figure it would save him quite a bit of time, since he would no longer have to pour over the Marauder’s Map at all hours of the day. Harry stared over a stack of books at Draco, watching as he flipped through page after page of an extremely tedious looking book. Harry had a book open in front of him but had hardly looked past the index. He doubted very much that the solution to their problem was in one of these books, but he was at a loss for anything else to do.
uncomfortable enough that he was unable to sleep. When he could bear it no longer, he had jumped out of his bed and went quickly to Draco’s door, thinking that surely Draco wouldn’t mind if he just rested on the sofa in the corner for a bit. He was so desperate for sleep.
Snape watched Harry for another moment, as if waiting for him to be argumentative for the sake of it, but Draco could feel Harry’s pulse slowing and knew that the immediate danger had passed. He let Harry’s wrist go with a small sense of loss, and wondered vaguely if Harry felt the same. “As for your sleeping arrangements,” Snape continued, “since you both reside in the eighth year dormitories, the only adjustment is that, Draco, your things are being moved into the room next to Potter’s. Professor McGonagall is overseeing the house elves as they move your belongings. I think this should be close enough to keep you from feeling any… discomfort.” He looked between the two to see if there were any objections, and when they were not, he continued. “Now, I have begun my research into this matter, but seeing as we are dealing with one of the most complex and intricate forms of magic, I suspect that there will be little that can be done for this situation other than to let time run its course. For now, Draco, I want you to practice your magic often. Start with simple spells and gradually work to increase their difficulty. Potter, I want you to focus on not blowing anything up, especially not my godson. Are we clear?”
Originally, there was some actual plot in this one, including quite a bit of angst. My dear friend and best-motivator Alex (PotionDaddy), then complained that there had been an awful lot of angst since we established Drarry - with the torture and the healing and then Harry’s sad thoughts and the heavy conversation with Severus. So I cut the chapter in half in the middle and went with the fluffiest fluff instead and sent them all shopping together. Yay!
Harry laughed. For the fact that she was supposed to be a baby, she understood quite a lot about relationships. Perhaps snakes simply learned faster in that regard. He turned back to Draco, who was watching him curiously.
“Alright,” he said, squeezing her hand in return before withdrawing it. “You and Mal— I mean Draco can stay. But if M— Draco behaves like a prick, I’ll hex him without hesitation.”
It always does, I should know better by now. Hell, this fic started as “Oh I’ll write a little one-shot” and we’re at 180K words.
“I would like to know about the family life he had before moving into Grimmauld Place, which is a new development as I understood,” she said finally, crossing her arms.
Harry’s insides turned to ice. There was only one way to interpret Remus’ words, but that couldn’t be. Absolutely not. No.
Pansy stared at him for a second, then chuckled and sighed, “I suppose it could be entertaining, yes.”
Slughorn moved around the classroom, inspecting each potion individually. When he reached Draco’s cauldron his eyebrows shot up.
The sound of a door opening downstairs made Draco jerk up and jump off the bed immediately. The sound of someone running up stairs confirmed Draco’s assumption that the conversation had properly riled Harry up. Harry did not come up to their floor, however. Instead, Draco heard a door on the second floor being ripped open, and Draco quickly hurried down the stairs.
“Alright, alright, slow down, cub,” Remus laughed, as he settled into one of the dark velvet armchairs. “What is so exciting?”
“If you want a chance at becoming an Auror, you’ll need a Potions N.E.W.T.,” Harry retorted, refusing to feel guilty about not “rescuing” Ron when they’d collected their time-tables. “Besides, you could’ve just refused her, why’d you need me for that?”
“Well, well,” he said with a chuckle, “barely sixteen and Lord of two Noble and Ancient Houses. How does it feel to move up in the world, Potter?”
Several audible gasps from the assembled crowd drew Remus’ attention back to the big double door; the sixth year Slytherins had entered. He had to admit that he was impressed. While he’d expected Draco to try his luck at convincing his house mates to join the DA, he’d not really foreseen the endeavour to be that successful.
“Then you call Remus tomorrow, with your mirror, and ask him to put my mother on. Tell her exactly what’s on the parchment and she can make inquiries for you. There must be another explanation, I’m sure of it.”
to, you know that, right?” He smirked. “I could drop in on your so-called detention later, unless you’d rather be alone with Sev. I just need an excuse; now I only managed to slip away from Vince and Greg because they were distracted by food. But I’m sure I can come up with something, if you want me to stop by.”
After a moment’s hesitation, he asked, “Why did you take the portrait down for me?” It was the first thing he could think of, but it was as good as any to start with he supposed.
Draco’s stomach dissolved into butterflies at how gentle the touch was, as if he was fragile and worth— Something in his mind cut the thought off reflexively. He didn’t care. Potter’s hand was still on his jaw, his eyes still on him and he was smiling the most genuine smile Draco had ever seen. It made him giddy. So giddy he had to stifle a delighted laugh. Or maybe it was a disbelieving laugh, because slowly, his brain was catching up on what just happened.
Still amazed by the luxury of the bathroom, Harry decided that he might as well make use of it and take a shower before dealing with whatever was going on. There must be a reason why Dumbledore brought him to Grimmauld Place—term hadn’t even ended yet, and if it had, he usually would’ve insisted Harry return to the Dursley’s as always. Maybe freshening up would help with his headache, too, which was still strong enough to make his vision go blurry.
” He smiled at Harry. “We’ve been over this several times already when we’ve discussed spells, and he can’t really explain how it works. Trust me, it’s a mystery to me, too.”
They were already at it when he stepped out the back door to watch. Harry was turning into a formidable duellist, and Severus watched with pride as his son evaded a series of jinxes that Remus shot his way. Draco was sitting on the sidelines, watching.
Severus had given Harry a book with information about all sorts of snakes, including prism vipers. As he’d already told Harry when he’d given him Sirona, prism viper scales were apparently used in several healing potions. What he
To give you something to look forward to during the potentially extended wait: The next chapter finally introduces Draco's POV ;)
he does, because he used to be just like James, mannerisms and all, and now he’s entirely different. I swear to you, Minerva, if you saw it for yourself you’d notice too.”
They settled behind the desk in the front of the room and Harry talked Remus through his plan for the session. When he was done, Remus gave him an approving nod.
get used to kissing Draco. When they finally broke apart again, they were both panting slightly, and Draco gave him a devilish smirk.
“He doesn’t have the ring anymore. The aurors took it when they arrested him. As I am his wife, his possessions were given to me when he was sent to Azkaban. The ring is with me, he has no chance of finding us.”
Narcissa squeezed his hand, bringing his attention back to the room. She still looked at him with deeply desperate eyes. They were the exact same colour as Sirius’ eyes, he realised. The stark reminder of her relation to his godfather swayed him.
Harry looked up at him then, blinking back tears. Draco put his free hand on Harry’s cheek and shook his head.
shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in. Draco still didn’t understand how Dumbledore could’ve let that happen, why nobody had intervened.
“I was foolish. On Harry’s birthday, I overheard him talking to Molly and— Well, in my head it sounded like he only accepted me because he felt like he had to, while considering the Weasleys to be his real family. I suppose old habits kicked in and I retreated behind my walls to avoid being vulnerable. It’s also why I’ve avoided you. With Harry not needing me, I didn’t see how you would still want to be around me. I did not want to wait for you to leave me behind, so I left you behind first. It’s a stupid defence mechanism, I know that, but pushing people away is all I’ve known how to do for the longest time.” He looked up at Remus with pleading eyes. “I hope you can forgive me, I value your friendship much more than I ever anticipated. I truly am sorry.”
The page was covered in notes, all in the same cramped handwriting as the ones on the Draught of Living Death pages. He scanned over it and sure enough, the very first instruction of the textbook was circled and annotated—and the note matched what Severus had taught them, as did the next one, and the one after that.
had pulled him out of the brain fog he’d been fighting for days almost immediately. Seeing Draco smirk at him, all haughty Malfoy arrogance, had grounded him in a way he hadn’t thought possible. It was annoying, simple, and familiar. Still, he hadn’t had the energy to retaliate, and where he would have picked a fight in the past, he opted to simply leave instead.
Lupin sat back, stunned. Draco’s face was incredulous, while Narcissa was simply shaking her head in disbelief.
“Well then it’s his bloody job now to approach me!” Harry shouted, suddenly angry. “I tried! I tried and he shut me down twice. Just— Just don’t tell him anything.” He stood, feeling restless. “I gotta go, I’m sorry.”
Remus laughed. “Is Harry likely to drop by? I didn’t get a chance to speak with him, he was swarmed by people.”
Sirona greeted him with a quiet hiss as he entered the empty dorm, and he gave her an apologetic pat before letting her coil around his arm again. She didn’t like to be left behind, and by now he rarely did; meeting Dumbledore had been somewhat of an exception, and he hadn’t expected to spend all night in the Room of Requirement.
His eyes fell to the envelope and he noticed with surprise that there still seemed to be something in it. Curious, he shook it out and a red and gold badge fell into his palm. His jaw dropped.
“Draco already knows about the prophecy,” he said with a grin and gestured for Draco to join him on the couch.
“Draco.” Harry’s soft voice drew his attention like a beacon. “We’re gonna be alright, we’ll figure something out. Okay?”
, he thought frantically, the tension between them crackling. He tried to shove Potter off him, but Potter was stronger, pressing him into the wall. Since when was Potter the same height as him anyway, hadn’t he always been much shorter?
“Master has summoned Kreacher, how can Kreacher serve master?” the elf ground out. Harry sometimes tried to convince himself that he didn’t sound as resentful anymore as he once had, but he honestly couldn’t tell whether anything had changed about the elf’s attitude at all since they’d moved in.
He let his hands wander over Potter’s chest to his waist and up his back into his hair again. There was nothing else to think about, nothing that mattered except Potter and keeping him as close as possible for as long as possible. Draco gasped when he suddenly pulled away from his lips, and instead started kissing down Draco’s neck. He was dizzy again. This could kill him, probably, and he wouldn’t even mind. Potter was going to be the death of him, of that he was certain.
As they both spoke the incantation a faint glow lifted from their chests and quickly turned into two bright, pulsing shapes of light floating in front of them. Colours danced around them as strings of magic shaped and reshaped themselves, forming ever new patterns.
A tear spilled from Harry’s eyes and his face crumpled. Before Draco could react, his mother had already wrapped her arms around Harry, swaying slightly back and forth as she whispered calming words in his ear. For a moment, Draco wondered whether he should feel jealous—either of someone else comforting
They stayed like that for what felt like hours, as Harry’s heartbeat slowly returned to normal and his breathing evened out. Finally, it was quiet. No ringing in his ears, no racing heartbeat pulsing through his head, just Draco’s quiet breaths, in synchronisation with his own.
“Well, at least now that all secrets are out, I can say this: like father, like son—you really are two of a kind.”
“I’m afraid I can not give you a satisfying answer to that, Harry,” Albus said, smiling. It irked Severus, that everlasting smile.
Severus laughed. “You should have heard him complain about that. ‘That vial was easily worth fifty galleons! I should have made them share!’ He went on through the entire dinner.”
I’ve also been made aware that this fic has been recommended on Tumblr somewhere?! Like… what??! Whoever did that, thank you so so so much for your faith in this story, I can’t describe how honoured I feel and how grateful I am to receive such support <3
Nevertheless, while the book was certainly interesting, it seemed far beyond Harry’s skill-level, and he wanted to understand what he was doing, rather than just blindly learn spells. He opted for a bigger book, whose title sounded somewhat broader—
Draco snorted. Harry had a point there, he would rather have died than apologise to Harry Potter for anything—until today.
He felt a soft wave of magic flow through him and suddenly there was complete silence. It felt unbelievably odd, as if he was floating, free of any thought or emotion.
Hermione gave him a startled look, before remembering why Harry had used wordless magic to begin with and started to flip through the pages. Harry snuggled closer to Draco and was just about to address Ron to start a conversation about Quidditch when Hermione gasped.
The second transformation was a little more complicated; the addition of another bathroom adjacent to Harry’s room, because Severus doubted that the boy would be happy with having to share with his father. Especially if Draco was around, they’d want privacy.
Draco exhaled audibly, trying to calm his racing heart. Then realisation set in and his heart rate spiked up again, tingles running up his arm from where Harry was touching him through the cloak. He felt a tug on his wrist—Harry wanted Draco to follow him. His heart gave another pathetic little stutter as excitement rushed through him and he allowed the invisible hand to lead him down the corridor of the train.
How many more families would Voldemort destroy? Draco’s family was broken, too, all because Lucius decided to follow that madman, uncaring of how it affected Draco and Narcissa. Gods, he already missed Draco. He wondered how his boyfriend was doing, surrounded by his usual friends again, unable to tell them anything at all about the last two months. At least they seemed to be good friends, according to what Draco had told him.
“He’ll sleep for a while, but he’ll be as good as new once he wakes up. You did wonderfully, Harry. You saved his life most likely, we wouldn’t have been able to treat any of those wounds without your spell.” She gave him a warm smile, before unexpectedly pulling him into a hug. She felt much softer than he’d expected. “Let’s go downstairs and have something to eat, you need to get some nutrients in you after all this.”
“Draco? Are you alright, sweetheart?” Harry eyed him with obvious concern, his excitement fading rapidly into a frown. “I’m sorry, maybe it was a stupid idea. You can tell me if you don’t like them and I’ll think of something else, I—”
“If he does everything instinctively, though, how was he able to teach the DA so effectively last year then?” Hermione argued back. “I distinctly remember him explaining spells to me, and as you said about yourself, if I don’t understand a spell I have much more trouble with it.”
He didn’t answer when she bid him goodbye and only looked up once he heard the door fall shut behind her.
“I’ve written down the exact steps of the brewing process here, it should help to follow the demonstration.” He handed Harry the parchment, who unrolled it immediately, eyes flying along the lines. How had Severus ever thought the boy had no potential? Had he really been that biased simply because of his memories of James Potter?
Burgock, a stocky little goblin with slicked back, ginger hair, bustled over to them and raised his hands in front of Harry.
have a brain to remember things with, that’s good to know. What’s it to you what I’ve been reading?”
Pacified by the thought that he would come back the next day, he forced himself to get to his feet and put the box away. He opened the door as quietly as he could, extinguishing the lamps behind him with a flick of his wand, which left him standing in the complete darkness of the drawing room. After carefully closing the door, he lit his wand and made his way towards his room.
“Darling, do you mean to tell me that your earlier claim that Harry never owned his own clothes before was
They quickly made their way to Madam Malkin’s to get new school robes, while Molly and Arthur took off to Flourish and Blotts to get their books for them, apparently content with having Remus and Tonks watch them. Just as they stepped inside the little shop, Harry heard a familiar voice that made his heart skip a beat.
, he chided himself. This was not the time for full moon nonsense. Nevertheless, for the rest of their meal he found himself keeping his eyes on Severus far more than usual.
Severus sat back and thought that over. It could work, but only if the evidence was truly damning, especially considering that they had apparently spoiled Harry’s cousin rotten, which the boy would undoubtedly insist on if asked. But if it worked, it would not only punish the parents but also their rotten child. A smile spread on Severus’ face. Yes, he’d love to see that boy thrown into an orphanage, where he was nothing more than one more mouth to feed. No special treatment, no mountain of presents, no second bedroom he didn’t even need. He would still live a hundred times better than Harry had, but maybe it would peg him down a notch.
He warily glanced over at the boys, even though he knew there was no way for them to have missed his reaction. Draco’s eyes had gone wide in fear, his stare fixed on Severus’ arm. He couldn’t blame Draco for being afraid, especially considering how narrowly he had escaped this fate himself. Harry, however, didn’t look afraid, he looked
“I mean, no, if it was up to me I’d tell the whole world,” Harry said earnestly, and Draco felt like he might explode from joy, “but I somehow doubt people would just accept it that easily. I’m used to nasty rumours about myself, but you’re not. I don’t want anyone to give you a hard time.”
“Well—” The clock struck twelve. “—you still get at least one midnight present this year,” Draco declared, grabbing his wand and summoning it from the bookshelf.
“You know,” Draco remarked, “I’d be surprised about the existence of hidden rooms if this wasn’t a Black estate, and I’d be surprised that you found them in under a month if you weren’t Harry Potter.”
Harry suppressed a snort and merely nodded, keeping his face neutral. He wondered how Dumbledore would react if he knew how familiar Harry was getting with wandless magic. Everyday spells came naturally to him now, so much so that he had to pay active heed to using his wand for them in public.
