Granger smirks and rolls her eyes, releasing Draco’s arm and stepping back. She looks far more at ease now that the storm he had been stuck in was fading. She was hardly the calmest witch around, but so often Granger was the one trying to hold things together for everyone else. Draco, usually, was good at keeping his cool, and he felt a little bad for being yet another mess for Granger to try and clean up.
Harry, immediately, zeroes in on the flinch and slips off his Cloak of Invisibility, draping it over a spare seat. Then, his hands are fluttering over Draco’s shoulders, like he has some intention of doing something, but freezes. Draco watches him, confused, pain beginning to recede.
“How have you spent the holiday, Max?” Draco asks at one point.
“What you just defined is what you already do,” Ginny muses, a small smile on her face, and Draco arches a haughty brow at her.
“You’re certainly avoiding my eyes,” Draco notes, and Harry pouts as he forces himself to lock gazes with the blonde, but he says nothing and Draco sighs. “Look, no one is angry with you, they’ve all made that clear. What are you so frightened of?” Draco’s eyes thin suspiciously as he thinks of something else. “That note from your father. On Monday. Was he a jerk to you?”
As it turns out the train is, in fact, nearing its destination not long after that and Harry and Ron scramble to throw on their robes. They look messy from the rush and Draco helps adjust Harry’s clasp and Ron’s collar. While Frederick, Ada, and Draco had no fancy clothes, it was still incredibly important in their household to always look presentable.
, Fang-
“Dreadful stuff,” Draco scoffs.
There were precursors to the Ministry, though. Ruling factions of witches and wizards that would eventually evolve into the government Draco knew today. They must have been the ones this dragon had interacted with.
“Malfoy, Draco!”
“Aw, but I like gossip.”
“And you did do something. You thought on your toes and used the resources you had at your disposal to keep anyone from dying,” Draco finally speaks up, shifting his head so he can instead kiss Harry’s temple, firm and steady. “I may have no clue what ended up happening, and I’ll agree it was one of the most reckless things you’ve ever done, but Sirius is alive because of you.”
Draco keeps his wand trained on Harry as Warrington and Millicent take great glee grabbing and hurling the Gryffindor into Umbridge’s visitor’s seat, then casting spells to bind his hands to the armrests. Umbridge smirks at the display, at the manhandling, and watches the Gryffindor squirm for a bit.
And in the corner is a small photo of Draco’s face, unmoving at first, but when he twists the card a little the picture changes to that of a snow leopard.
KR-BOOM!
“I’m afraid that is not something I can answer, young Malfoy,” the hat says, “Only you can decide where you
“Plus, the connection Voldemort and I seem to have. What else could it be?” Harry says, sounding more and more excited. Draco isn’t sure why this, of all things, has got the Boy-Who-Lived so energized, especially with everything going on.
“Pretty common,” Leandra says, “I don’t think I know of any pureblood family that doesn’t have something they pass down, although not all of them are magic. Sometimes it’s clothes or a normal book or a photo. Something with sentimental value.”
“It’s really not,” he whispers, but Potter is still smirking.
“Coolio, Malfoy,” Fred says cheerfully, standing, and Draco glares at him.
Draco scowls at where she had been before looking down when Sirius nudges his hand with his wet nose. Sirius, despite being a dog, has remarkably expressive eyes as he looks to the form in clear concern. This form wouldn’t get them anywhere near the Records Department.
And Draco highly doubted his “true” and “positive” selves would ever match.
“Correct,” Sinistra responds and Draco’s eyes widen in surprise. Wait, he was named after a constellation? He’d always just thought his name meant dragon, which was awesome, but nothing beyond that. His confusion must be obvious, for Sinistra looks to him then begins to speak. “The Black family is known for naming their children after constellations, a practice which I can respect. Now I must ask you all to take up your telescopes and find a spot you can see the sky comfortably and we will begin our first lesson on stars and constellations.”
Max’s mother hums, a distant noise that doesn’t seem like she’s even aware she’s done it, before she speaks patiently, “Sometimes you can’t. More of that confusing stuff, you see. Some people need a distraction, while others must face it. Some people need to cry, or scream, or laugh. Some people need to be alone, but others need people surrounding them.”
“I could always get you the sword of Gryffindor,” Potter says conversationally.
~ ~ ~
“Oh! Sign language! I’ve always wanted to learn,” Hermione immediately says, leaning forward and near demanding they teach her some signs. Draco leans back and silently watches, brows furrowed curiously, listening but not commenting. Greg and Vincent seem pleasantly surprised by Hermione’s desire to learn, Greg talking her through the alphabet as Vincent does the signs for each letter. Draco wonders if Vincent will even be able to do some of the spells they’ll learn if he can’t say them out loud… McGonagall had done her chair-ostrich trick without a word, after all, so maybe it wasn’t as big a deal?
“Then you can’t,” Eric replies simply. “There’s no shame in taking care of yourself. If something becomes too much, you have a responsibility to yourself to say ‘no’ and step back. Just because you logically know your fears aren’t founded or needed doesn’t mean they aren’t there. If you can’t handle something today, there’s always tomorrow. Or next week. Or next year. How fast you grow isn’t determined by other people.”
It certainly doesn’t help his nerves when he looks away from Umbridge, for a moment, and finds Potter’s striking, green eyes on him yet again. It’s only for a moment, but it’s a moment that has Draco stiffening up immediately until Potter looks away, attention split between Hagrid and Umbridge.
“Is that why you won’t speak to Potter?” Draco questions sharply and one of Dumbledore’s eyebrows arches up. Draco can’t tell if the man is surprised, upset, or anything else.
By the end of his veritaserum induced confession, it is Barty Crouch Jr. who sits before them, a scrawny, mad man who starts raving over everything his father had done to him. How he’d been snuck out of Azkaban but hidden away under the effects of the Imperius Curse and an invisibility cloak. Draco, for a moment, wonders if this is the same cloak now in his own possession.
“Do you have one of these, too?” Draco finds his own mouth moving, acting like a child in his excitement, and Sinistra inclines her head in an affirmative. Then, she’s reaching into her robes again and removing a similar card. The background colors on hers are different, as is the watermark, but Draco doesn’t much care as he reads it.
” Tracey is suddenly announcing, then pointing her wand at herself. There’s a moment where nothing seems to happen, everyone looking at her strangely, but then something is uncurling from behind her.
“Am… Am I really your friend?” he whispers, just above the noise of the hall, but quiet enough only Draco can hear him.
If Greg and Vincent wanted to tell Draco about their families that was up to them, not Draco.
” Muddy hisses as she slithers out from Draco’s robes. At some point she had hidden further within without Draco noticing and now she lets him hold her in his hands.
“Oh! It’s a family book, actually,” Leandra smiles sweetly at Harry, showing him the cover of the book. There isn’t any visible writing on it, however, rather one large, intricate design carved into the leather. “I got it over Christmas. It is called The Geoscript, and I’m finally old enough to learn from it… If I can understand it.”
Draco can’t find the words to thank the mediwitch, but he does nod to her before he’s turning around and fleeing the infirmary. He has no idea which direction Harry might have gone in, but he needs to find him already and find out what’s going on.
“Yeah? Figures he needs something happy after everything,” Max replies, their voice somber and quiet. It’s raining outside Draco’s en suite window.
“Then we better hurry,” Tracey says as she marches forward and clambers into the fireplace, first. She throws her powder down and is gone in an instant.
It still wasn’t that bad, though. The worst spells would “miss” while the ones that hit were innocent things. The worst they’d managed had been Pansy growing Granger’s teeth in the middle of Potions, which was actually Granger’s idea.
“Whatever, you just have a snooty tongue or something,” Max grumbles, “Don’t like anything unless it’s
Being at the Gryffindor table so much also gave Draco the opportunity to talk to Greg and Vincent, see how they were doing, and ask if they had any books on sign language he could borrow. They’d immediately brightened and that evening at dinner had brought Draco a few books on British Sign Language. Hermione, finally interested, had asked what was going on.
Luna, if possible, brightens even further as she hurries forward to give Tracey a hug. “Oh, very pleasant sight indeed,” Luna says, and she’d likely hug all of them if Eve hadn’t set a hand on her shoulder.
“Not if we find him!” Hermione cuts in, standing up quickly, a fire in her eyes and Draco groans. He catches Greg’s confused gaze and shakes his head. He couldn’t believe this was already happening again. “We’ll help you look. Won’t we, boys?” At Hermione’s intense gaze Vincent and Greg nodded, wide-eyed and startled.
Not bad, per se, but off. The senses suddenly being taken away was more disconcerting than gaining them, and he felt tired now that his animal adrenaline was promptly gone. Hopefully, that would go away with time and practice, because this was a bit of a hindrance.
“That’s pureblood tradition for you,” Draco shrugs, but then Granger is looking to him, her brows furrowed in question.
“Why is that so bad?” Hermione asks, looking up and furrowing her brows.
Figures it would be plant related. Draco opens it, flipping through it and taking stock of some of the more exotic examples within.
Mophead, or would you rather I not help?”
“The Inquisitorial Squad will have ultimate power,” Granger finishes, her expression twisting in upset anger.
Plus, Draco’s articles about sentient, mythical beings that the Ministry has kept quiet about for centuries had done their intended purposes; weaving distrust and discontent amongst people towards the Ministry. Yes, it made more people upset at the Ministry, but the backside of this meant that students came at former Ministry supporters with a renewed hatred. Well… presumed Ministry supporters… which just meant “Slytherin” to most of these people.
“Slytherin is a proud house that others fear. How distasteful.”
“It, uh… It is Greek, Professor. Astron meaning stars, and nomos meaning law,” he offers, voice shaky, and Sinistra blinks once. Had she blinked at all up to that point?
“Yeah, I… yeah…”
Draco takes his duty as scout very seriously, staying low to the ground as he listens for incoming witches or wizards. On multiple occasions they have to duck into another department and wait out a Death Eater running through.
Only a year or two ago Draco probably would have thrown a tantrum at his father, making demands that would surely be granted after he’d worn down enough of Lucius’s patience, but that was no longer an option. He knew he wouldn’t garner any favors from his father right now, even though he’d been on pretty good behavior, and he didn’t want to either. He was all for taking an opportunity when it came to him, but he also had his pride.
we prefer them, it is so much more convenient to have someone who already has a foothold here, don’t you see, but times have changed! I have a whole speech planned for you all when we got to the common room.”
Draco can’t help but feel nauseous.
“You can always go see him tomorrow,” Draco shrugs, “It IS the weekends. And as much as Flint is a jerk, I know you’re excited to be playing Quidditch. You can’t hide how happy flying makes you.” Only a blind, deaf fool would be unable to tell how much Harry loved and belonged in the air. Even while having to use a school broom during their impromptu lesson Harry had been whooping and laughing and flying laps around Draco.
“Feeling better?” Max’s mother asks once they’ve slid in and settled.
“Oh! Like the Tootsie Pop commercial, yes?” she asks, hands on her knees so she can bend down some and take a look at the owl. Now it’s Draco who brightens.
“I assume he was sent to Azkaban for being a Death Eater,” Draco says carefully, watching as Skeeter positively preens at knowing something he doesn’t.
As they skid to a stop Draco is still open-mouthed in shock and surprise at getting soaked, definitely feeling like he’s at some kind of carnival or amusement park now. “Well… that was rather rude,” he grouches, half realizing they’ve stopped, and McGonagall offers an amused half-smile. She removes her wand for a moment and flicks it, the water still clinging to them both and the goblin flicking off with the motion. The goblin doesn’t even offer a thank you, either. Rude…
“Why would I be joking?” Longbottom asks, his tone of voice already beginning to even out into calm conversation. For a moment, Draco and Harry share a smile, then turn back to watch the show.
“No. He’s been busy with… whatever he’s been doing,” Potter replies, spitting out the last of his words with a surprising amount of disdain. “Nobody’s told me anything. Hardly anyone owls me back, and when they do it’s vague and clipped and
This may have been the least Slytherin move he’d pulled in a while…
” Draco sits up a little straighter, eyes wide in horror.
He doesn’t find Lupin in his office, however. Instead, the gruff-looking man nearly bumps into Draco as they both turn a corner, a packed suitcase already in his hand and a travel cloak over his shoulders. He was already leaving, Draco quickly realizes, but he stops to give Draco a calm smile.
“Meh. Maybe not, but sometimes, y’know, it’s just not worth the trouble. It’s not like these teachers are gonna change any time soon. They think they’re in the right!” Max pauses to take a breath before they can wind themself up too much. “At a certain point you just gotta take care of yourself first.”
Draco sighs and pulls out his most successful draft, handing over the parchment wordlessly. Harry reads over it a few times before trying to offer suggestions. Draco, tired and already not in the best mood, shoots most of them down. He doesn’t think he’ll be making any headway tonight, but then Harry surprises him by offering to write to Sirius himself and hopefully get a connection going.
“How would
At least this one Draco felt a bit more confident with after looking into Latin, and some Greek, when researching spell names and incantations.
Filch growls and Draco thinks he hears a cat hiss unhappily. “Well? Which way did they go, Peeves? Tell me quickly!”
Oh. Oh! Okay, that made sense. Draco nods and waves the wand much like he’d seen McGonagall do when she changed the Nubble’s chair into an ostrich. A small gust of wind ruffles his hair and Ollivander’s robes, but it’s weak and Draco doesn’t feel anything particularly special about it. Judging by the look on the old man’s face Ollivander probably sees that too.
“Not like there’s anything for us to watch,” Draco rolls his eyes. “Same as the second task. Just a bunch of staring at nothing. No worries, though, we’ll make sure to congratulate Diggory on his win when all is done.”
Silence falls on the chamber. Slowly, witches and wizards begin to rise, looking around at the chaos Harry’s impromptu rescue attempt had created. It seemed that Harry’s prediction about raw forms of magic making contact was true, but what did it all mean?
“Some tapping by my bed woke me up… Dunno what it was though,” Harry replies, words slurred on a yawn. “Why are
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Harry says, as if Draco’s being the weird one. Hermione, her focus seemingly more focused on her books, looks over from the corner of her eye, but says nothing. Weasley, still appearing to be relaxing, is peaking over his folded arms at them.
It was all about strategy, in the end. What action would garner the most satisfactory outcome? Not, “which action feels best in the moment?” Because, clearly, that did them no favors.
“I’m going to make you keep being nice to people. You need to learn already! Mama always tells me to have some curtsy, even when I don’t like the person.”
Draco despised every second of it.
Just like that, they have a plan.
book, which he’d only skimmed over, but it doesn’t take a genius to figure out what they are.
“Thank you, Miss Babbage. I suspect these incidents are impossible to explain using Muggle means, yes?” now she was looking at Draco and the boy startled.
“Do you truly believe I wouldn’t say anything if I didn’t want you around? What, to spare your feelings?
“I believe so,” she nods, glancing back at the large doors like they’ll open for them right then. “Are you still hoping for Slytherin?” she asks, looking back at him.
With all of their apparent drama dealt with, the two boys are prepared to send up sparks for the other search party to come and find them, but are interrupted by the arrival of a centaur.
“Hmm, just thinking. I just turned thirteen. Can you believe we’ve known each other for more than half our lives?” Max sounds wistful and distant, but in a good way. They sound like they’re in a daydream.
Dobby was giving Draco a very strange look. Draco doubts he realizes he is doing it, since he would have immediately realized how rude he was being and given himself a proper smack for it. No, Dobby has been thrown so much for a loop he can’t even notice his own actions.
“You have a Muggle friend?” Potter repeats, looking like he doesn’t believe him, so Draco sighs and turns on the radio.
Textbooks surround him out on the grounds, he’d found a sunny spot to sit despite the cold temperatures. He felt not too different from a cat in a patch of sunlight by the window, content as he works. Occasionally he stops to snap a picture, he’s near enough to Hagrid’s hut to see some of the creatures moving about, but for the most part his focus is on his work.
“But why not? You aren’t giving me a reason here, Granger,” Draco scowls. Whenever he got particularly heated or frustrated he tended to use people’s last names while addressing them. It was a curious habit he picked up from Mrs Nubble, a lawyer that only called her clients by their last names.
“But what are we supposed to do to ‘educate society?’ I can’t even drive yet!” Max whines miserably and Draco chews at his lip in thought.
For a long, silent moment Mr. Davis just stares at Draco with wide, vacant eyes, then slowly reaches out with his stained, spindly fingers and takes the offered page. He reads them all over - once, twice, three times - before pulling out a stack of bright red paper. He writes a name on a single red sheet each, then taps them with his wand and they watch as the pages fold themselves into origami fish before swimming off through the air.
“You ended up failing everything you were attempting. You only survived all your classes because your grades were already so good,” Draco interrupts, readjusting the radio in his hands.
Chapter Song:
“Thank you, Miss…” McGonagall began and paused to allow Ada to fill in the blank.
“How is
He didn’t get to sing much else because Hermione had taken her book and smacked his arm with it hard enough to make him shriek.
Draco looks back down at his paws, flexing them and shifting his weight some, before standing onto all fours. Jumping and climbing sounded perfect. He’d loved getting up high as a human, it made sense he’d enjoy it as an Animagus.
“Transform back if it’s more comfortable,” Harry says, and, with a smile in his voice, adds, “And I wouldn’t mind having my stuffed toy again.”
“Yeah, Draco?” Harry asks, stepping towards him so they can speak more easily while Weasley and Granger bicker.
“Night before last,” Harry replies, still smiling, and Max releases a series of wordless noises that are clearly baffled, insulted, and shocked.
There was writing on the wall. Red, foul smelling writing on the wall, and water on the floor, and a petrified cat hanging from a sconce. Draco, and plenty more students, are crowded into the corridor, trying to get a good look at what was going on. The blonde had been lucky, if one would call anything about this situation lucky, and ended up near the front.
“No, no, I’m just saying you probably make them work, is all! Like, not like with those old-fashioned, round glasses that make you look like an old spinster.”
No one says a word, they just look at each other, and Draco sees the exhausted resignation in his cousin’s eyes and realizes this is not the first time that this has happened.
“You should be proud. I was emulating you,” Harry huffs and Draco smiles cheekily against his neck. “What do you know about occlumency?”
“The woman is Professor Sinistra,” Harry continues, “She teaches Astronomy.”
Potter lowers his gaze, fidgeting getting worse, and he mumbles, “I guess we both didn’t want to talk about it.”
“Tell me, Mr. Malfoy. Have you begun exhibiting unexplained behavior after becoming an Animagus? Behavior more suited for your Animagus form, perhaps?”
“Fred and me didn’t, either,” George offers helpfully.
Another jerk has him yelping aloud and pressing his body tight to his broom. What was going on? What was happening? WHY was this happening? He can see Harry out of the corner of his eye rushing over, hand outstretched, but the moment he gets close Draco’s broom is flinging itself farther away. He tries desperately to hold on and take control again, but the broom keeps jerking and swinging and bucking like an electronic bull.
“That was terrifying,” Pansy sighs, falling backwards and sitting on the ground, her short, straight hair a mess from sweat and stress. “What happened?”
“Didn’t know what, Eric?” Draco asks, attempting for gentle, but figuring he fails as Eric only cries harder.
“What, really?” Potter yelps, surprised, his grin dropping. “I just saw him, though! Surrounded by a bunch of angry-looking goblins!”
“Malfoy?”
Merlin, he hopes he isn’t pushing it with those last few comments. Thankfully, Umbridge hums a small consent, glancing over Draco’s shoulder at Hagrid. “Yes, it really does boil down to how we are born,” she says sweetly, then turns back to Draco with one of the fakest concerned expressions he’s ever seen. “But you do be careful, Mr. Malfoy. These beasts are considered dangerous for a reason.”
“Hey!”
~ ~ ~
Years and years of emotional training kept Draco from exploding, quietly letting his father chew him out as Narcissa Malfoy stood off to the side, waiting and watching. Her expression was completely unreadable, and Draco quickly attempted to mimic it.
It’s all very touching and Draco wonders if he should send Sirius a photo for Christmas next year…
“Well, I figured that when we’re adults and we go exploring the world and we need a translator you can cover French and I can cover Spanish!”
He swings around onto the grounds, charging forward, and nearly bowls someone big over in his haste. “Move, damn it,” he snarls, trying to spring around them, but a large hand wraps around his bicep and yanks him back. “Let GO, you vile--”
Draco smirks and gives Potter a playful pinch to his side, making him yelp, but laugh after.
“Pretty obvious it was Animagus related with that thing in your mouth,” Pansy says cheerfully. “You may have fooled the professors and other houses, but you live with some of the nosiest people in the world. How long did you expect to keep it quiet?”
“Busy, busy,” Skeeter tsks.
Draco tries to focus his gaze, but everything is blurred, and he realizes it is because his eyes are filling with thick tears that keep rolling down his face. He thinks he sees a familiar, frightened face in front of him and he tries, desperately, to remember how he’s supposed to function.
“Well, father travels enough that he was given the privilege of this specialized powder,” Draco waves his hand dismissively, “and I intend to take full advantage of it while I can.”
Transfiguration also leads into an unexpected… not friendship, but acquaintanceship, certainly. Sophie Roper, one of the Slytherin first year girls, is apparently intrigued with human transfiguration, a complicated subject they won’t even begin to look at in classes until sixth year, but she is fascinated, and in turn so is Draco. Every day she transfigures her dirty blonde hair into a new style, which she always wears with pride, but it seems her interest can only go so far, and she struggles with the class as much as any student. When Draco offers to lend her some of his extra books all he asks is she teach him her hair trick and they are quick… acquaintances.
Draco smirks as he opens up the book in front of him, to the beginning of chapter three, and, with Granger in a supposedly better if flustered mood, they begin talking about what they had read.
“I was exhausted yesterday,” Draco argues. He and Harry had finally been kicked out of the infirmary around dinner, Pomfrey ushering them out with a stern glare, and they’d gone together to get food.
“She made us write lines,” Granger says, sitting with Ginny and Weasley on Weasley’s bed. The twins and Lee have taken over Finnigan’s bed while Longbottom sits on his own, knees pulled up to his chest.
vicious, had it? Certainly, Potter and his lackies deserved to be put in their place every now and then, but had he sounded like
Draco, silent as can be, turns away and maneuvers through approaching crowds of students and heads back towards the castle and, hopefully, answers.
“Mama says you both looked stunning,” Max says.
“Yes. He then proceeded to commit arson and attempt to burn his files to a crisp, managing to set a good chunk of the department on fire with me still inside.”
Tonight, however, Draco is completely alone.
“You’re the one that picked Spanish as your language elective. If you’d picked French, I could have helped you, but you didn’t listen.”
” Draco says, sharp and heavy, and then Umbridge is slumping in her seat, unconscious.
“Wake up,” he hisses, smirking as the other boy grumbles and squirms, mess of hair poking out from his cocoon of blankets. Draco ignores the glare sent his way and instead continues to the bathroom.
“Is that Sirius Black?” questions Pansy as a small congregation of Slytherins – Draco, Pansy, Blaise, and Theodore - make their way through the streets. Sure enough, walking in the opposite direction as the train station is Draco’s cousin, and the blonde stifles a sigh of relief. He’d been looking around for that man the second they’d shown up in the little town.
“No!” Harry is quick to reply this time, looking panicked, then cringes when it draws some of the other students’ attentions. The black-haired wizard glances around nervously before grabbing Draco’s upper arm and dragging him back out into the Entrance Hall. “It was nothing like that,” he whispers and Draco stays quiet to let him gather himself and continue. “He said everything my mom said… He said he loved me and he didn’t blame me.”
The furnishings are mostly black or dark green. Leather sofas and chairs and dark wood tables covered in books and study materials are organized around the room. The windows along the walls are huge, too, and reach from the floor up to the ceiling, giving everyone a view of the lake. The light passing through the water also gives the room a green-blue tint, the sound of the water against the walls and glass immediately putting Draco at ease.
Draco wasn’t as loud or obnoxious as Max’s father, but he was beginning to think this was his favorite room too. So many devices he had never even heard of, from jerrycans to pressurized chambers, but that appeared normal for the Muggles. He didn’t even need to ask what each device did, since the displays did a good job of that.
Silence settles over the three, cold realization freezing them in their spots. “So…” Harry breathes, voice weak and high, “what now? Do we just… go back to our dorms? What if she’s waiting for us?”
“That basically means you’re stuck,” Granger says, and when Draco looks at her, she’s smiling at him.
“Are the other Slytherins fine with this? Since you’re all so ‘suspicious’,” Potter finally speaks up, doing air quotes around “suspicious.” He doesn’t look agitated like his friends do, rather he looks like he simply wants to understand where Draco and his housemates stand on all this.
“You don’t know of my powers,” Draco snarks, but their argument is forgotten a second later as, from around the corner, an ostrich comes running with a shrieking Dobby on top attempting to control it. Whatever the twins have managed, there is surely a story behind it… but the twins will just have to fill them in later, because Umbridge’s office door is crashing open and the menace in pink is rushing out.
They make it down to the Slytherin Dungeons in one piece, thank Salazar, and rush in. The common room has a few students in it, similar to Gryffindor’s, but the moment they come rushing in students are scrambling away. Their eyes are mostly on Theodore and his dreadful appearance, but a few shoot Draco some anxious glances.
Draco Lucius Malfoy is six years of age when he goes missing from the hours of 12:30 pm to 7:15 pm.
“Any particular camp in mind?” Draco asks. Muggles had so many unique clubs and camps and organizations, it was intriguing.
...?”
Draco discovers this because the greenhouses are still one of the places he regularly goes to talk to Max. He still hides the radio whenever someone comes in, but whenever it is just Longbottom, Draco no longer has to flee or make up an excuse as to why he’s there.
The blonde shrieks, springing up, and the two start flinging jinxes and hexes at each other.
“Oh, well this should be fun,” Draco smirks and Potter gives him an unhappy look, “Oh, come now, I won’t be too dreadful. After all, you had the good graces to warn me. But if you think I am going to make this easy for you--”
“I’m afraid you must be mistaken. I don’t make a habit of interacting with the press,” Draco drawls, absently twisting a strand of hair between his fingers as if he’s bored.
“Looks like everyone’s heading out, though,” Eve says, watching as, with most pleasantries and presents out of the way, the students were making their exit. “Guess we should, too.”
The panic is clearly mounting in their group, Draco can feel Eve and Theodore’s legs shaking where he’s pressed his flank back against them. Tracey is the only one who doesn’t seem affected, standing with them, but staring back at the figures like they speak her language.
Everything, all these killing machines, all these attacks, all these deaths and celebrations, were real. All of it.
“A sentient dragon?” Draco questions disbelievingly, “I adore dragons, but even I think that’s a little farfetched. Don’t you remember Harry’s first task in the Triwizard Tournament?”
For a few, calm minutes, with the sun slowly setting, Draco stands and watches the herd, a few of the creatures glancing at him curiously, but leaving him be. He snaps a few pictures and basks in the calming--
“I’ve heard of weirder shit,” Eve shrugs, fingers hovering over a mark on Hermione’s chest that looks like she’d been lashed with a whip. It didn’t look pretty and Draco has to watch for a moment to see her breath again. “Magic’s fucking bizarre.”
Potter, on the other hand, doesn’t have any suggestions.
The photo is one of many with Pettigrew being dragged up to the surface from beneath the Whomping Willow, looking ready to run at the first opportunity.
“I’m sure you’ll see if you read a little lower that this… absolutely stunning work of genius was written by a Mrs. Daisy Hayworth,” Skeeter says sweetly, leaning forward and pointing a sharp nail at the author’s name.
Granger looks up, more confused than offended, and questions, “What? Why?”
The Golden Trio had appeared shortly after, cutting off their conversation which Draco assumed they would pick up some other day, and Dobby had gleefully greeted Potter.
“Oh, yes. Your father’s was a family heirloom, of course - elm, dragon heartstring, nearly 1,000 years old - but I assisted in fashioning it to that cane of his. Your mother’s - redwood, unicorn hair, 10 inches - was a favorite of mine. Took us nearly a half hour to sort her out.”
“The Malfoys are one of the oldest known wizarding families within our world. They have accumulated quite the fortune,” McGonagall glances down at Draco as he falls into step by her side, following the grumpy goblin that was apparently helping them. “And now it falls to you.”
“I know that,” Draco rolls his eyes, “And I don’t trust
They’d argued plenty before, but this had gone a lot farther than either one of them were comfortable with. At one point in their pasts, they wouldn’t have cared. They would have spat the most vile things at each other and never felt remorse. But that wasn’t their reality anymore.
Draco’s first response is to ask what the fuck that kind of answer is, especially when they are just talking about snails, but the look on Longbottom’s face stills the Slytherin. Max begins groaning about being a terrible, snail-torturing person, but Draco isn’t paying attention. Longbottom looks distant and drawn in at the same time. It is clear that whatever Longbottom had been thinking about when he made that comment, it ran a lot deeper than where Draco and Max had been.
Does the Marauders Map show suffixes for a person? And if not…
“Don’t get sassy with me, mister.”
“Teaching by example?”
“The quote says magic and you are being purposefully obtuse, aren’t you? All I’m saying is we may just not be at a point to understand what is going on.”
uh…” Did these guys not usually introduce themselves, or something? Mrs. Nubble would be appalled, Draco imagines. “Are you… you guys first years, too?”
It is the beginning of a new chapter outlining all the houses, their histories, their founders, and their reputations. There’s a picture not too different than the Hogwarts wax seal on their letters, but much more in depth and in color. An “H” is surrounded by four coats of arms. One is blue with a bronze eagle, one is yellow with a black badger, one is red with a gold lion, and one is green with a silver snake. Draco immediately zeroes in on the last one.
It goes about as well as Harry’s Militus. That is to say: not well at all.
Alright so I took a lot of liberties with the classes and schedules, seeing as they aren't very well explained in the books OR movies. I also used
“Yes… I suppose I am.”
“Not really, no,” Eve says blandly, Pansy and Sophie letting out snickers while Daphne turns a little pink. “She wasn’t forced to join the DA. She should live with her choices and deal with the consequences.”
He starts looking for his mother, but can’t find her immediately. She’s a hard woman to miss, so he has to assume he’s simply not looked everywhere. However, as he continues to look, his trunk floating behind him, the crowds begin thinning out and he has yet to find her.
“Yeah, a bunch of Gryffindors already know you’re a lot nicer than you act. Harry told us at the end of last year.”
“More bullshit.”
“Obviously,” Potter snorts as he watches, next, Weasley mimic Granger, only to yelp in surprise and slap a hand over his mouth. He’s wide-eyed and shocked, which makes the rest of them grin at him, but he’s too focused on the new candy to notice or care. A moment later he swallows, then pours another pile into his hand.
“How can I not?” Draco mumbles, trying to get the heat in his cheeks to go down, and he hears Flitwick chuckle. “I grew up without any of this. It feels like a waste to not try to figure out as much as I can.”
“Nu-uh! Mama says you can only be brave if you’re scared first,” Max says with feeling, the sound over the radio crackling as they readjust their hold on their own device. “When you’re afraid, but you do something anyways, that’s when you’re brave.”
He also didn’t know what his Animagus form would be, but… to have something like that as a backup sure wouldn’t hurt. He could just as easily gain an Animagus form and then never use it again. No one would know but himself and a few, choice individuals.
?” he demands, Draco’s family name sounding like venom on his tongue. Immediately Draco jumps back on the defensive, eyes narrowing at the other boy.
On the next bang, the door splinters fully open, wood flying into the room, blocked by a well-timed shield charm from Harry. Smoke and dust cloud upward, for a moment, and then shadows are taking shape as they stroll into the room.
“It’s from a Muggle band, Nirvana,” Draco explains, keeping Granger in the corner of his eye, but mostly focusing on Krum. “’Smells Like Teen Spirit.’ I have a Walkman, now, I could play it for you some time.” Draco didn’t use his Walkman much, since he had so much work to do and the headphones from Sirius made him feel cut off from the world and claustrophobic, but occasionally it was a nice diversion. Perhaps Krum might appreciate it.
what the Lung Dragon was here for? For the Ministry to experiment on him? What kind of life must this creature have been living locked away in the Ministry of Magic’s basement?
“Hey! We can lock that thing in there when it isn’t looking,” Ron suggests eagerly after spotting a key hanging in the door’s lock, but Draco roughly steps on his foot.
“You’re going to tell Harry and Weasley about that, aren’t you?”
“So… Do you like Quidditch?” Ron asks after a too long wait, his eyes lowered as he scuffs his shoes. Draco can almost feel the relief wash over him because yes, yes he does like Quidditch.
That was when Draco and Potter had snuck away and Draco and Max got to hear all about Potter’s day, adjusted for Muggle ears.
He then turns and power walks as fast as he dares away from the portrait, only to run into Sirius hiding around the corner.
It wasn’t much of a bummer for Draco that there was an age cap for the tournament, either, since he had no intention of risking his life for something like a single trophy, but he would certainly be enjoying getting to watch the proceedings. It was bound to be all kinds of entertaining.
“I’m proving my point. Didn’t throw a single punch,” Draco drawls with a shrug, then turns away sharply and begins stalking towards the trees. “Now if you don’t mind, I need to get some energy out,” he calls over his shoulder but doesn’t look back. Despite his cold exterior, he was fuming over these idiot Gryffindors.
“I… suppose I have little choice,” Draco says very slowly, sounding more like a question than a statement, and then Patil is nabbing the camera from his grip. He’s too startled to be suspicious, he’s just trying to understand.
They have to extend the invisibility cloak again when they start finding their friends.
The sky is clear tonight, the sky a wash of black and dark navy, like a smear of acrylic paint, and coated with brilliant pinpricks of light. It almost feels like Draco is looking up at a gigantic beast with billions of glowing eyes staring back at him.
“Okay. Well, unless you are going blind I do not think this reaction is entirely necessary,” Draco scoffs, ignoring the judgemental gaze the Gryffindor gives the side of his head. After a few beats without an answer, however, Draco’s expression twists into worry. “
Draco looks over at that, brows rising, and he takes a wild guess, “Is it Professor McGonagall?”
“Did Umbridge catch you?” Weasley asks his brothers, momentarily looking worried.
Usually, if there is crying involved over the radio, it is Draco’s own. He was a crier, he could admit that now, but only around these Muggles, it seemed. They hardly judged him like other purebloods did and they were a relaxing force for Draco.
~ ~ ~
“Run in the middle!” he snaps at her, not caring how harsh his words or his grip are. “They’re targeting Muggles!”
“STOP!” Harry calls desperately, eyes wide in horror as he watches his friend be tortured right in front of him. Beside him Tracey’s support on Weasley has turned more into a hug as she tries to hide her face, while Weasley stares off like a vegetable.
He suspect, now, that there was something in the Department of Mysteries, perhaps in the Hall of Prophecy, that Voldemort wanted. He isn’t sure why Ebru had put such emphasis on such a place, didn’t know what she could gain from doing that, but he would take what he could get at the moment.
“Whenever I have fought off the Imperius Curse,” Potter begins, every student very quiet and still, “It was like I had two voices in my head. One was the caster, giving me orders, while the other was my own will. It is… difficult to put into words, if I’m being honest, but the best way to visualize it is to hold onto this stubborn need to not be obedient.”
“Oh!” the man sounds surprised, but pleasantly so. “Oh, I see. You must be muggleborn, yes? Or grew up around Muggles, I suspect. Fascinating! Yes, I suppose this must seem rather silly to you, then,” the man makes a motion to the wall of Muggle books, looking absolutely ecstatic. Draco arches a brow at him but nods. “Silly” sounded appropriate. “You will find that Muggles are as much a mystery to us as we are to them, however.”
“Oh, and perfect Granger knows best, does she?” Pansy hisses, rolling her eyes, and Hermione leans back, eyes wide in surprise at just how vicious the words are. “Do everyone a favor and shut up for once. No one likes listening to your know-it-all garbage, acting like you’re better than everyone else.”
Slowly he lowers his wand, glaring coldly at Millicent who, the moment she realizes she’s out of the woods, scoffs. “Really? Nothing? I thought you lions were all supposed to be courageous or something? Turns out you’re just a coward.”
“What the hell are you doing here?!” Potter exclaims, stepping towards Draco and looking at him like he’s some kind of fairy that just decided to take refuge in his home.
Max thankfully accepted that Draco simply had strict parents. Max had accepted a lot of Draco’s explanations over the years, and this was one of the tamer ones.
“Okay, okay,” Draco attempts to get them to calm down as Max begins a tirade, clearly insulted.
“Clearly, but not simply a curse to make your name appear,” he says, waggling the wand, then lowers it. “The Goblet does not think there are two Hogwarts champions, it still thinks Cedric Diggory is the only one. But it also firmly believes that there are supposed to be
As it turned out, not much. Really he just needed to wait.
“Behave!” he repeats and Skeeter smirks, so he glares at her too. “Both of you. Salazar, we have a job to do here.”
“How do you know? What if he lied about being a liar? Plus! You just said he wants to kick out a bunch of people for no reason except that he doesn’t like them.”
He may not be a Wiccan, but it won’t hurt to do some research.
“I do not like the term ‘motive,’ but my intentions, I assure you, are honest,” Draco decides to take this as seriously as he can. As ridiculous as this might all seem, he really, really wanted to date Harry, and these people weren’t just his friends, they were his family, and that meant Draco needed to play ball. “I would like to get to know him more and more everyday. I would like to be there for him when he needs me and let him be there for me as well. I would like to laugh and argue and enjoy each other’s’ presences as often as we can.”
“Oh?” he drawls, “Do tell.”
He looks worse than at the end of the year, somehow. Perhaps not physically, he’s healed up fine and there’s color in his cheeks, but his eyes are cold and far away now that he has nothing to talk about. Draco wishes he knew how to help, but there were hardly any guidebooks for the situation they found themselves in.
A chuckle bubbles out of Potter and he nods. “How are we supposed to get into London, anyway?”
Soft footsteps enter the common room and Draco and Harry lower themselves to the floor to look under the chair. They see fluffy, pink slippers and the bottom of a matching bathrobe. They’ve stopped by one of the couches in the middle of the room and appear to be looking around before calling, quietly, “Draco?”
“It will surely take the Ministry a few days to find out about Ebru. I am to remain as your shadow for them until they clear everything up,” Draco explains, eying the prices for the snacks. He didn’t have a frame of reference, but did these prices seem high? “I cannot promise an outing every day, but I can assure you that you will not remain cooped up in that Muggle house for long.”
“And if they still can’t find anything?” Harry demands, moving to brace himself against the bed and hover over Draco. His face is blotchy and streaked with tears, some still rolling down and off his jaw like he can’t help himself anymore. “What if they’re as clueless, too? Dumbledore said that what happened - what I caused - has never happened before tonight. The Ministry is clueless, they don’t know what that weird…” Harry flaps a hand in the air, “black orb thing is, and Sirius was right in the middle of all of it. What if they can’t fix him?”
Potter swallows, takes one, two, three deep breathes, then finally looks up at Draco with the most mournful eyes he’d ever seen. “Since Yule Ball.”
“Only if they slow down, for Merlin’s sake,” the girl snarks, but doesn’t quite manage a smile. It’s fine. What else can they do?
” Muddy snaps back and Draco hums innocently.
Moody was a paranoid old coot that despised every Death Eater’s child with a passion, especially Draco. Occasionally he would mutter about the blonde pureblood “snooping too much” or “getting into things no one wants him near” or “a walking magnet for trouble.” He doesn’t dare answer any of Draco’s questions that don’t have anything to do with DADA and his eye always seems to follow him around.
on my turn,” Granger answers absently, “Why didn’t she want your opinion?”
“Or you might not have. Best to accept every advantage presented to us, don’t you agree?” the Slytherin says back, purposefully nonchalant about this. He didn’t want Harry making a big deal out of this. “It was a battle, Scarhead. People are going to get banged up. But we lived to see another day.”
He cries for nearly the entire day, locked up in his room, and while most of Slytherin doesn’t fully understand why he would be so upset over this, Draco and Pansy make sure to sit with him through it all.
The lessons, being a very relaxed thing, also allowed students to leave whenever they pleased. Sinistra made it very clear that this was an optional lesson, and if a student needed to study or work on homework, then they should leave and do that first.
The hall erupted into a cacophony of noise as everyone began to sing to the song, but in a mess of different beats, tunes, and pitches. Draco grit his teeth, not even trying after the first line, and instead bore through it until all that was left were the Weasley twins, both going off a slow funeral march, Dumbledore conducting their last lines. When done a small splattering of students applauded them, including Dumbledore himself.
“Mostly Ron,” Harry smirks, glancing back at his friends, before looking to Draco. “Both of them have been a lot more… I hate to say it, but, bearable this break.”
They swerve and weave through the spires and towers, Harry far superior but not boasting about it. It isn’t a race, Draco would lose miserably if it was, and is instead just a very invigorating, much needed fly around.
“I like your haircut,” Potter finally mumbles, voice nearly a whisper.
were an afterthought!”
Max calls him an idiot and won’t talk to Draco for a few days after that, and Draco regrets telling them about the fight, but at least they
“Where is he?” Draco demands and Eve’s expression swiftly hardens before she’s leading Draco through her apartment. The eating area is right beside the kitchen, the space well-lit by bright, natural light. Sitting at the kitchen table is Eve’s mother, dressed in pink, plaid pajama bottoms, an over-sized grey shirt, and fluffy, white slippers. Sitting across from her is Harry Potter, a single bag sitting at his feet, as he and Eve’s mother both nurse mugs of something steaming.
“Usually,” Weasley says, finally swallowing his food as he speaks to the girl. “But some officials, like Aurors, travel so much that they designed special powder for them instead. Bloody brilliant stuff.”
It takes Draco a few moments to realize the boy must be muggleborn, like Eve, and Draco is surprised by the surge of protectiveness he feels at this realization.
“EEK!” Neville exclaims from his bed and Draco looks up. The Gryffindor dorm rooms are shaped similar to the Slytherin ones, but their windows look out to the sky and the horizon beyond and everything is decorated in reds and golds. “Hermione, this is the boy’s room!” Neville continues, grabbing the curtains around his bed and yanking them closed. Draco wonders why he seems so scandalized. He was wearing pajamas, it looked like.
“Are you a Wiccan?”
Also, fun fact, the stories about Max's school are all actual things that have happened to myself. They were such ridiculous stories I felt they had to be included somewhere.
Draco’s chest heaves as he leans back and glares at the group around them. Some look sheepish, some look defiant, and some, to his relief, are nodding in agreement. “Hermione did nothing wrong,” he says in a lower voice and Pansy bites her lip. “She wants to make friends just like anyone else.
“What are… SS soldiers?” Draco asks curiously when he and the Muggle family return to the museum after “linner.” He still thinks the name is silly, but he’s in surprisingly higher spirits now than before. Muggle food was delicious and their music was infectious and their interior design could be just as intriguing as a wizard’s. Who knew?
“You’re such a dancefloor ho!” Max laughs over the radio later in the night. Draco, after his run in with Skeeter, had truly felt his energy plummet and he had finally retreated to the Slytherin dorms.
me?!”
“See? Cool looking, right?” Harry says to his friend and Ron nods like he’s mesmerized, eyes bugged out while he stares at the lightning scar. Draco can’t help the blush on his face and he pushes the shirt collar back up.
” Draco says sharply, sticking “Basket Case” by Green Day in her head. She turns around and immediately fires “Remember the Time” by Michael Jackson into Draco’s head. They glare at each other, silent, then go back to their readings, not wanting to draw Pince’s attention with any flashier hexes.
“What the hell is your problem?” Draco had demanded right back, setting down his papers and glaring testily at the radio.
He’d asked Max’s mother what it was like, since she knew almost as much as Draco’s mother, and she’d answered him honestly.
“Oh, we’re all fine. Sophie’s the one that got the brunt of it with that slumber curse,” Astoria says with a flippant shrug, then nods over to their drowsy friend in her corner bed. “That’s why we’re here. We all came to check on her.”
“Yes. That,” Granger nods, pulling a baffled Draco back to the wall, carefully readjusting the cloak to ensure they are still covered. “I think I must apologize for that… I didn’t listen to your concerns over her and brushed them off like they were nothing, but when the twins said we had been ratted out… I knew it must have been Edgecombe.”
Umbridge may not know where the DA took place or who was involved, but she knew it existed and she knew its name. She was sure to approach Dumbledore about this, which wasn’t a huge worry on Draco’s part, except for the fact Edgecombe was still a factor.
“Uh… I really don’t think I have any right to comment…” Longbottom squeaks, attempting to work but easily being distracted by how jumpy he is over Draco’s extended presence.
But he can’t. Not when he talks on a regular basis to a Muggle. Not when that Muggle’s voice pops into his head and makes him question everything he’s ever been taught. Not when said Muggle has no fear of calling him, a powerful young wizard, out on seemingly pointless matters.
Biting Sirius’s arm it was, then!
~ ~ ~
Whoever those people were, whatever they had been doing, there was no doubt in Draco’s mind what he’d just seen.
“What a peculiar Muggle,” Draco’s own mother says, coming up behind her son and watching the mother and daughter walk away. “She could have stayed to properly introduce herself.”
Eventually the car slid to a stop in front of Kings Cross Station and Mrs. Nubble stepped out to help Draco gather his things onto a cart at the front. She patted him down and ran a hand over his slicked back hair, a decision on her part Draco would no doubt be adjusting the second he got away.
“We’d need to find a way of making it affordable, though,” George reminds his brother.
Draco makes an affronted noise at that, but still climbs onto the bed to sit beside her, legs stretched out beside hers. “I do not have slut energy,” he fires back, “Maybe you have slut energy.”
“Mudbloods are ruining our wizarding way of life.” “Albus Dumbledore is a fraud and should be sacked.” “This Ministry official is a complete joke. I will have them demoted immediately.” “Never speak to those Weasley’s, they are filthy in hygiene and in character.”
Snape finally turns away from his work to shoot Draco a scathing glare over his shoulder and Draco smiles back. He doesn’t ask questions for a few moments, letting Snape work, his legs kicking, before he reaches for one of the shelves surrounding the room and picks up a sphere of crystallized amber. Inside it sits a fossilized lizard of some kind.

They didn’t even seem insulted by him avoiding them, they just seemed confused. It would have been a lot sadder if they were only big idiots, but no. They were big idiots who were still as blindly hatefully as their parents, and after everything, Draco just couldn’t stand to be around that attitude for very long.
“It will put myself and all involved in danger,” Huang-Jun nods, sighing, “Yes, I suspected as much, but I still wish to help. A first step is still only a first step. I can only hope that the upheaval will eventually lead to my freedom.”
Draco was also warned that they had to be careful. Despite agreeing with You-Know-Who’s greater purpose as a whole, saying such things aloud was bound to jeopardize their family’s standings. They had to play into the public view.
“We’re getting really sick of hide and seek, you know,” now Bellatrix is scowling, face twitching as she moves towards them, and Draco can hear Harry and Longbottom trying to move closer without alerting anyone. If they could get in a surprise attack, maybe they could get out of this. “Where’s Harry Potter, little girl? I’m not playing anymore and I won’t be going back to the Dark Lord empty handed.”
It's been a while hasn't it, y'all??? Well, to say I'm sorry, how about we wrap up year five with the LONGEST CHAPTER YET OH SWEET BABY JESUS
It looks like it may have, at one point, belonged to a mighty castle, but was the only thing left standing after the fortress crumbled away.
What on earth could have happened?
It made it easy to listen to idle chatter, too, which was how he heard the whispers about the attack a few floors down. Apparently, an official had been hurt so badly he’d been rushed to St. Mungo’s. Draco doesn’t hear a name, but it definitely piques his interest when he hears it happened the very day Potter and the Weasleys had disappeared from Hogwarts.
“I was curious about this as well,” McGonagall says evenly, looking down her nose at Draco and the boy’s glower fades, quickly shrinking away from the woman’s gaze.
That perks his interest, Weasley crossing his arms and tilting his head suspiciously. “What kind of peace offering?”
“Just tell us this: Are you not telling us because you’re trying to protect us, or because it’s embarrassing?” Draco questions and Harry scowls but doesn’t look up.
“You think I need to have a crush on her to be near her?” Draco demands and his voice has turned icy. “Did you think - did any of you think - that maybe, just maybe, I don’t find her annoying because I actually got to know her?” Draco looks around at the crowd, furious at them all for ignoring his friend. They didn’t know what they were missing, if you asked him.
“I had a vision,” Harry says urgently, his eyes wild and his hands curling around Draco’s arms, too. “It was of Sirius. He was being tortured at the Department of Mystery and I… There wasn’t anyone I could talk to so I went to floo Grimmauld Place.”
“We made it here, didn’t we? Now let’s find the forbidden corridor so we can go back alrea--” Harry is cut off by high-pitched giggling. The three boys look to the far end of the hall where, floating right in the light from the far windows, is Peeves. Draco had only seen the poltergeist at a distance, he tended to stay away from wherever the Bloody Baron might wander, but there was no Bloody Baron here.
“You saw someone?” they hear the unmistakable voice of Filch speak a moment later.
“Is he, uh…” Draco begins, turning towards the majority of the Slytherin table, “Is he a little… you know…” How was he supposed to ask this, exactly?
“I didn’t mean to,” Draco continued, sitting in the dirt, speaking lowly to three, little snakes that slithered around his legs. One was entirely brown, named Muddy, another was white with dark eyes, named Snowflake, and the third was nearly black, named Shadow. Shadow didn’t seem to be paying attention, but Muddy and Snowflake were staring at Draco like they were actually listening to him. Like they were actually aware. Sometimes Draco even imagined them talking back to him.
“Shut up, Nott,” Parvati Patil snaps, eyes blazing.
Draco realized, after a few years of knowing Max, that the Muggle child got upset over some of the most peculiar things. Yes, there was the usual “Draco said something I disagree with so I won’t talk to him for a few days,” but the rest of the time Draco really had no idea where Max’s worries were coming from.
“You want to join us? We’re walking around some, too, you may as well avoid your father with some company,” as he says this, Potter reaches out to stick his hand into Draco’s M&M bag.
Harry was the only one who seemed to do better intrapersonally, borrowing the flashcards to work on his own. Even at the library table he’d mumble to himself as he studied, going over things visually and auditorily. Weasley was physical, which surprised no one, having to move his hands a lot to work out what he was working on, and Eve had even taught him a few words and letters in sign language to help him keep things narrowed in his brain.
Harry is silent, so silent the tension is quickly returning to the table, and Draco begins massaging his fingers over Harry’s back. When the silence goes on, Draco finally decides that, as short as their sit-down was, it was time for them to go. He bids the table good-bye, everyone seeming relieved, then ushers Harry up and out, maneuvering them around the lingering crowds of students as they walk.
“No promises,” Vivian shrugs then winks at the two before she disappears to the third year, girl’s dorm. It leaves Harry and Draco to slip into their own dorm room and change out of their day-old clothes. Blaise, who is always awake first, gives them both a thoughtful stare as they enter before shrugging and going about his business.
“How can I trust that he won’t rat me out the moment we leave here?” Skeeter continues, not really listening.
On his eighth birthday Draco gets his very own racing broom. He adores it and goes flying for hours on end, even convincing his father to come into the air for a little bit and pass around a Quaffle. Lucius doesn’t stay long, but it still is positively invigorating.
“Could be? Makes the most sense. Question is: what?” Harry shrugs, looking back up at Draco.
That startles a giggle out of the boy and he nods, like he’s come to some realization, before grinning brightly at Draco. Was this boy the embodiment of the sun, or something? “Sorry, sorry. So, there’s four houses at Hogwarts, right? And you get sorted into one at the beginning of your first year.”
Luna and Tracey were, in fact, already there, throwing meat at the herd, but what Draco hadn’t expected was to find Theodore Nott with them as well.
“Make yerselves at home,” Hagrid says, smiling down at the boys. Harry moves away from Fang and steps forward to hug the giant man, who booms a happy laugh and gives him a squeeze back. It is all very sweet. “Good te see ye, Harry,” Hagrid pats his back and Harry just keeps grinning up at him.
Draco wonders if the boggart is broken, but then his doppelganger starts to speak.
“If Harry’s idea is correct, they’re only dangerous around other embodiments of magic,” Draco replies, watching as the records are passed around to everyone who is conscious enough to hold them.
“Is Harry and Granger’s love not enough?” Draco stops him dead with a growl, the ginger’s blue eyes widening and the fight very swiftly running out of him. “You mean the world to them, yet you act like it’s not enough. You need everybody’s approval, don’t you?”
Draco rolls his eyes at the over-eager response and goes back to sorting out his things. The train would be leaving in two days’ time, and he wanted to be prepared and ready to go at the drop of a hat. He was ready to get out of this stifling manor and have himself a nice, normal school year.
By the time Max had finished their rant Draco had been boiling with embarrassment and fury. They’d snapped at each other a bit more, getting nastier and nastier, until ending the call and not talking for nearly two weeks.
A mighty shadow, long and serpentine, is momentarily illuminated by the flashing lightning, the creature shifting through the sky like it’s swimming, and Draco scrambles to his feet. “Hello?!” he cries into the storm. It was too late to run, so the next best thing Draco could do was talk. It was one of his greater talents, after all. “Please, we mean you no harm!”
It is entertaining to listen to Blaise have similar complaints as Hermione had after their Ancient Runes exams, which Draco was not part of. “Ehwaz! Fucking Ehwaz! How’d I screw that up?” Blaise had exclaimed as he’d stormed into the dorm room and dug out the corresponding textbook.
In the meantime, Draco had slipped out to take a few pictures, chatting with Max as he did. They’d had a mild argument over something stupid…
“Some parents tutor their children,” his mother had offered over the breakfast table.
“Can anyone tell me what mistake was made there?” Lily asks, walking back to the front of the desk, cutting into the Slytherins’ teasing.
Weasley starts them off, attempting to recount to the dragon as much of their time at Hogwarts as he can, but they soon realize just how much Huang-Jun has missed along the way and Draco has to interject with a few history lessons to fill in the gaps. They talk for the remainder of their visit, exchanging stories rather than interviewing, and when it comes time for Draco and Weasley to rush off it feels like they are leaving Huang-Jun behind.
Sure, Draco didn’t know what “battery-“ or “solar- powered” meant, but he was certain it all was related to “e-lek-try-city,” so what was the point? Malfoy Manor was filled with old and new magic alike, the radio didn’t stand a chance.
She raises her wand to an empty space of floor, notably made of concrete, and says, “
“It’s true,” Eve nods, “There’s a lot about the other schools and wizarding communities that isn’t easily shared, including sentient magical beings. For instance, I’d say go speak to a Long for your final article, but I can’t think of a way you could do that.”
Draco’s brows furrow and he lowers the paper some, glancing over the top. “Hey, Harry,” he says, silencing the conversation abruptly, and all three look towards him. “Your birthday is the 31st, right? Of July?”
“That was nice,” Potter eventually admits, voice low and wondering.
Fuck. So much for Draco retrieving it, then. “Is there a way to counter such a curse?” he asks, hopeful, but not expecting much.
Draco scoffs, shaking out his head and walking alongside the other Slytherins, trying to focus on the class instead of his personal issues.
“The fuck was all that?!” Blaise is demanding, stepping forward to wave his hands at the figures angrily. They stare at him without answer. “I thought we solved your stupid riddles! What was THAT?!”
“Hello? Harry?” Draco nearly drops the mirror in his scrabble to pull it up. The glimpses of another room have now taken over the whole object and instead of Draco’s reflection staring back at him, there is Sirius.
“Wizards and witches have been around for a very long time,” McGonagall replies, also looking at the store, though she appeared to have a nostalgic look to her eye. Draco looks up at her.
“Why?”
“You getting scared there, Harry-kins?” Theodore mocks, having stopped in the middle of the hall, looking around at all the doors, and Harry scowls at him.
“Not your friend.”
“I don’t think you’re a… bad friend…”
Draco and Blaise, and some of the nearby Slytherins, are quick to start laughing, Draco snapping some photos as Potter tries to help his friend, even though he, too, appears to be giggling.
He doesn’t say any of it, however, and instead forces a smile on his face and asks, “Do you think I could go out and practice my broom work?”
“I believe that’s enough talking,” Draco tries to cut in, reaching for the radio, but Potter is leaning away and shielding it with his body, a shit-eating grin on his face.
Theodore is mainly eying the thestral in front of Draco, however, clearly gauging when he should flee. It makes Draco roll his eyes at him and shift sideways, beckoning him with a flippant wave of his hand.
think about it. I do not deny that the Chamber was originally created by Salazar Slytherin, but that doesn’t mean it was either his heir nor a Slytherin who may have opened it. Slytherins, however, are an easy target.”
“Exactly! I don’t want him to come running to our rescue over nothing,” Harry sighs, shaking his head.
“That would be the Headmaster,” Draco replies evenly, sitting down on a stone bench beside one of Hagrid’s gardens. “He’s kind of upset with the Headmaster at the moment, though. It’s… complicated. Don’t ask.”
“It is…” Draco says slowly, then stops to turn around and face Harry again. “You’re coming back down? You would risk being caught a second time?”
“You reckless, foolish, idiot of a boy!” Granger flails her hands uselessly, like she wants to smack Draco, or strangle him, or something along those lines.
“Not that? Possibly? Was that too much to ask?” Draco sneers, turning to keep his eyes on the doors that they pass. He just wanted to find the damn Lung Dragon and be done with this little adventure already.
When Draco is eight, he gets into a fight with Max. Like they often are, the fight starts because Draco had said something Max hadn’t agreed with. It was something to do with controlling savages to keep civilized society safe.
“Maybe not that spell, then.”
“Mnemonic?”

“You just need to get out of your head,” Draco waves him off, glancing at the elevator gates before them. “Put yourself in the present. It’s a Quidditch game between a bunch of idiot teenagers. Why the fuck do you even care how successful you are? Aren’t you just supposed to be enjoying yourself or some rot?”
“That’s the third thing I am.”
Draco doesn’t know how to take any of it. Not only was someone sending him letters on the regular, but he hadn’t been able to read a single one, and his anger was mounting. He kept catching himself glaring at his foster parents whenever he could, furious with them no matter how much they thought they were doing the right thing. The right thing sucked, and he wanted his letters already.
“Potter, Potter, Potter,” Draco shakes his head, slipping out from behind a corner just as he hears the Boy-Who-Lived making his way down the corridor. “You couldn’t help yourself, could you? Constantly hungry for more and more fame that you would even stoop this low.”
The Order already knew he had a talent with getting what he needed from the massive department, plus they knew he had a connection to Terence Davis. With his ease traversing the Ministry it made sense for the Order to get him such access.
All five Gryffindor boys are there, crowding into the room and looking worse for wear. Their heads are down, exhausted and grasping their own hands, but freeze when they look up and see the predator in Harry’s bed.
“It only works on rock, concrete, or earthen floors,” Daphne explains, her chest heaving a bit as she turns back to Harry, “And it’s a little draining, if I’m being honest, but it can offer some good defenses.”
“Malfoy is always trying to tell me how important being selfish is,” Potter grumbles, his face burying itself more and more into Draco’s shoulder the more Draco pets his hair.
“I won’t.”
“He’s not being coy,” Eve agrees, finally moving back to Draco’s back to finish up her preparations. Pansy looks at the muggleborn Slytherin in clear shock, before looking back at Draco.
Thankfully, their well-timed return had worked perfectly. The twins had set off another distraction, pulling Umbridge away and giving Draco and Weasley the opportunity to slip back into Hogwarts through her fireplace. The only people who would know about their usage of the floo network out and in of Hogwarts would be themselves and, probably, Dumbledore. Dumbledore seemed to know everything that happened in these walls.
“This is a textbook, you cur. They use it at Durmstrang and it is far from evil,” Draco flips through the pages idly, scanning them. “Honestly, it is rather old, too. Some of these spells are not even considered part of the dark arts anymore, such as… Aha!” Draco opens the book to a two-page spread and smirks.
“Possible, but very unlikely,” Sirius sighs, running a hand through his hair in a stressful manner. “Me and Draco are going to be using the final task as a distraction from our last two suspects.”
“I hope they do,” Potter says, voice a little high as he forces down a laugh, and Draco snarls.
The Unspeakables, to Draco’s understanding, did the exact same thing in the Department of Mysteries. Sure, it would be easier to sneak around at night, when no one was there, but Draco and Weasley didn’t have that option with their floo situation. It would have been significantly more helpful to have had an Invisibility Cloak with them as they made their way down to the Ministry’s basement, but it would alert the Unspeakables to their presence due to their currently active security spells.
“No. I just know they are. In my heart.”
“Minister Fudge,” Draco calls, standing up before he can leave. Everyone looks at him, which is a little unnerving, but he ignores them and makes his way over to the Minister. He was just nearly out the door again but had stopped to give Draco a very displeased glare.
Draco heaves a deep sigh and nods in agreement. “Yeah… not really worth the risk.” Still, he makes a copy of the file and hands Mr. Davis the original, which he makes fly back to where it belongs. “Thank you for your help, nonetheless,” Draco bows his head and Mr. Davis nods back before going right back to work.
“I’m not fixing you, though, moron,” Harry says, voice soft and slightly teasing around the insult-turned-compliment. “You aren’t a problem, neither is your pain, and you can’t deny it’s there… And I want to be there for you when you allow yourself to feel it.”
When Draco gets to the heavy, metal door to the Records Department the pin at his chest begins to faintly glow. Glowing, golden lines begin to draw themselves onto the door right beside the handle, forming a geometric octagon, before fading away and the click of a lock can be heard.
With a flutter of the little bug’s wings it leaps from the wall and morphs midair, Skeeter’s heels clacking on the stone floor as she lightly lands. She shakes herself out and pats down her robes, these ones cheetah-print with purple fur lining.
“Gryffindor and Slytherin! So good to see you all bright and early in the morning,” Lily - Draco is going to have a rough time remembering to call her Professor Potter - greets them all, running her hands over her clothes to straighten them up. She isn’t wearing robes. Instead she is wearing jeans, a flowery, button up shirt, sneakers, and what looks like a Muggle lab coat. As she speaks she buttons up her coat, still smiling.
“Of course it hurt,” Draco grunts, but there’s little heat in it. It had hurt so much, realizing he couldn’t trust the man he’d once put above all else. “But I had other people who loved me. Truly loved me. Max and their family. My mother. The Slytherins. Even you and your treacherous trio.”
Mr Nubble seemed fine with this set up, and in general so did Mrs Nubble, but that evening Draco’s foster mother sat him down and gave him a long lecture on stranger danger, told him he could always trust the police, and even let him borrow her Nokia Cityman 100, which he was to store in his backpack in case of emergencies.
“His true name… is Voldemort.” She says it with such severity, such intensity, that Draco feels like he is supposed to feel something about it, but he doesn’t. It just sounds like another made up word, like Muggle. “He had followers known as DeathEaters,” she continues and, okay, that at least sounded a bit more threatening, “And your parents were part of them.”
“Maybe I should be trying for the Patronus Charm first, then!” Weasley is suddenly speaking up, his fury momentarily forgotten in the face of a possible solution, and Draco gives him a flat look while Granger speaks up.
“When you realized that your father…
“Very well, but I’ve begun smelling bacon and I suspect Sirius will be tromping up here soon to wake us anyway,” Draco hums, sniffing at the faint smell of cooking meat. He had no idea if Sirius had taken over the kitchen or gotten Kreacher to do it, but knowing his cousin, Draco wouldn’t be surprised with either outcome.
Something bumping his hand pulls Draco out of his musings and he looks down where Muddy is nudging his fingers.
They make decent progress getting rid of all the decorations together when Luna and Tracey come in. Draco is back up in the rafters, removing some of the tinsel that had little lightning bolts hanging from them, when Luna says, “Oh look. Mistletoe.”
Did that make Draco a sap, too? Probably. But he found he didn’t much care at all.

~ ~ ~
“Hey, Malfoy,” Goyle mumbles back.
He never does get a proper answer for his questions, but that evening, during a wandless tutoring lesson up in the Astronomy Tower, he notices Potter looking at his fresh undercut, followed by the boy wonder tripping over his own feet.
Potter is crouching beside him a moment later, hand coming up to grab one of Draco’s shoulders in a vice. “Malfoy, are you okay?” he asks urgently and Draco waves him off dismissively.
“He is not back!” Fudge kept spitting, throwing dreadful accusations everywhere.
“I’m sorry,
“This isn’t some school assignment or prank or a bid to get you in trouble,” he says sharply, setting his hands on his hips. “You could have died back there, and I may be a jerk, Potter… but I’m not a
“Is… is apparation just… teleportation?” he questions, finally looking up at McGonagall with wide, amazed eyes.
Then, Harry is raising his own wand and reciting, “
Draco doesn’t want his father’s approval anymore. He doesn’t want to act like him or sound like him or ever do anything that would make such a psycho proud.
“She isn’t my pet!” Draco calls, then glares at Muddy, whose head waves back and forth leisurely. “She and the other two just… leave me be. And listen to me complain.” Draco’s scowl returns. “And she really shouldn’t be here!”
He set the document aside for Sirius, though, since he’d voiced concerns over the woman in the past.
And then Fudge had stormed in. What a mess this man was.
“Because you and Eve are Slytherins?” Potter asks sharply, his eyes narrowing, and Draco hums and nods his head side to side in a “so-so” gesture.
The letters don’t stop.
But these photos seemed remarkably realistic. Draco squints his eyes as he looks at them. Fake. They had to be fake.
“You agreed to help. Stop complaining.” Potter turns back to watch the massive, destructive tree, trying to end the conversation.
“I’m not rich, technically, my family is,” Draco deadpans and there’s a scoff across the radio connection.
“Harry Potter!” the girls say in unison, clearly startling Harry when he stiffens, his eyes go wide, and he stands at attention. Draco would laugh if he weren’t so curious. Some of the other students have also glanced over.
“They are perfectly peaceful, kind creatures. This fear you have of them is ungrounded and silly,” Draco is saying as he shoves the lanky Gryffindor through the woods.
Eventually Eve has to leave, and Draco and Potter are left to their own devices. There is a moment of awkward silence as the two boys just stand beside each other, their guide gone, and in completely foreign territory.
“From success we learn, but very little. From mistakes we learn so much more.”
“It is quite the beautiful instrument,” Lucius says at length, expression drawn, “I believe Madam Iguala at the Ministry speaks very highly of her
“I hate you both.”
“Young master is not going to read it?” Tana asks, her big eyes wide in confusion, and Draco is immediately snarling at her.
“What?! After coming all this way?” Weasley exclaims, stepping up to Draco’s side and looking at the Slytherin like he’s lost his mind. “We can’t just leave like tha—”
The morning the broom is delivered it also comes with a letter from Sirius Black addressed to Draco. Hedwig nibbles at the piece of bacon Draco offers her as he shakily unfolds the letter.
The note from one of the Muggle children - Eric this time - is always stashed in the record sleeve and he digs it out without preamble, sitting on his bed. Tana doesn’t even pretend not to spy over his shoulder to read it, too.
Weasley also managed to weasel - pun not intended - another bag of PopRocks out of Malfoy. He had had four shrunken down bags in total when first arriving, and now he had two. He hadn’t wanted to hand over another bag, but Granger had given him a very pathetic pair of puppy-eyes and Potter had picked that time to lunge for an M&M, distracting Draco.
“Really?” the blonde draws out in clear disbelief, “I might believe you,” he points at Blaise, “But not Little Miss Gossip over there.”
Draco watches as Weasley rolls his eyes skyward, groaning in what sounds like disbelief, as Potter turns ten shades redder at what Granger is implying. Strangely enough, Potter begins to look worried, and his eyes flick sideways in Draco’s direction a few times before he splutters at Granger.
“Can you show us some advanced spells?” asks an eager-looking Ravenclaw nearly bouncing out of his skin.
him, and now, here he was, constantly worrying about him, wanting him to live the best life he could, wanting to do everything in his power to assure Harry could be happy.
“I’d like to know who this ‘everyone’ is,” Hermione mumbles, never having been a fan of useless gossip.
It would just be his luck. Harry had issues with the Militus Charm and Draco had issues with the Patronus. Even Weasley had managed to finally form his Militus during their private meetups.
“From Sirius. It was a Christmas gift.”
“The Weasley’s are a stain on--”
“I wouldn’t really classify you as a ‘beast’,” Potter says, smiling innocently when Draco’s glare lands on him.
The synopsis is straightforward, which he appreciates, and he discovers that no, it wasn’t a strange title. The book he holds in his hands was an actual diary of a Jewish girl named Anne Frank while she was hiding out during World War II. She was young, too. Truly young. Draco’s age…
“I did,” the professor replies, pulling out her wand and showing it to Draco. It was smooth and straight, made of dark wood, with a slightly lighter handle. It looked very elegant, if Draco was being honest, and he couldn’t wait for his own. Did they all look the same? Did they not? How did one even make wands?
Now, Sophie shoves one of the twins’ Puking Pastilles at him, too. “In case you need an excuse for being late,” she hisses, then reaches around Draco and yanks his hood into place, effectively making him invisible to the world.
“Who are you? What do you want? Do you not know what time it is?” Vernon Dursley demands and Draco plasters on the fakest smile he can offer.
And then they see it, like a beacon of hope. “F8 Lung Dragon,” the plaque hangs on a door just like the others but appears to have a bit more wear to it. There also appears to be very faint scorch marks along the upper corner of the door, but it could be a trick of the light.
“Oh? I do believe it is time for me to hear your stories, then,” Huang-Jun twirls in the air, then resettles in Weasley’s lap, looking at the boys expectantly.
“You couldn’t have
“You mind if we start with Algebra? It’s the next test I’ve got,” Max says and Draco shrugs, even though he can’t be seen.
, freshly made! I'd love to chat with y'all!
Draco snarls and snatches the camera away, making Dobby flinch back, and readjusts it in front of his face. He peers through the little eyehole, this time able to see through to the other side and line up his shot and presses the button.
Finally the door is opened fully and the dark interior within bursts into light as lanterns hanging from the ceiling come on. The whole room appears to gleam gold, and at first Draco thinks it may just be the fire from the lanterns, until he looks a little harder and realizes that no, that is real gold, and his jaw drops.
“We met when we were six,” Max is suddenly adding when their laughter dies down and Draco tilts his head in confusion.
The night before Halloween Draco startles awake in the middle of the night from a nightmare. He hadn’t had as many since arriving at Hogwarts, but ever since he could remember it was always the same thing. Screaming, high-pitched laughter, and a flash of green light.
“Now, now, hold on. We may very well be onto something,” he says, snickering when Potter glares and shoves him.
“Could be worse,” Draco offers pleasantly and Pansy arches a brow at him. “Could be pink.” Pansy groans at the very thought of it, rolling her eyes skyward and shoving the badge into her pocket. Draco had long since hidden his away as well. He’d wear it in public, but otherwise he wanted the damn thing off him.
It is all a perfect combination to sneak Draco back into the Ministry, when no one is expecting him, and sneak down to the Department of Mysteries to find the Unhideable Hall and get his notes on the single Lung Dragon he knows of.
That last name gives Draco pause, looking at it as he attempts to recall what department Jorkins had been in. If her MIA status was to be believed as foul play, one had to ask why. If it was personal, Draco would be wasting his time, but if it was something else it could very well be due to her involvement in the Ministry.
Curiosity momentarily wins over Draco’s stomach and he quickly fetches the CD player from his room. When he returns Vivian takes it while Harry hands him a plate he’d prepared quickly. It has a generous slice of pumpkin pie on it. Draco nods his thanks before digging in.
That is abundantly clear now. The boy wonder’s eyes are downcast, back curved, shoulders slumped, and bags under his eyes. He’s frowning, which he’s been doing a lot of, and his mind looks to be miles away.
The figures stare at him and say nothing.
“I know it isn’t fair,” Draco says and Potter hiccups, pressing in tighter. “Potter… you deserve a happy ending to all of this. You deserved a happy beginning and a happy middle, too, but you didn’t get it, and I… I am truly sorry, Potter.”
Draco is still scowling as he joins Harry at the Hushburn’s kitchen table for breakfast.
Now he simply needed Sirius to get back to him, really, and he’d be good to go.
Silently, but with a few glances sideways at Potter, Draco returns to his book.
“Well, Fred, I think you might just be right! Why, I think the best word to describe little Malfoy now would be…”
He blinks again and she’s disappeared in a burst of flame.
No, that couldn’t have been Potter down there, could it have been? Had Draco just seen Potter get…
When Draco returns to Slytherin he discreetly squeezes Blaise’s shoulder, gives a quick look over the DA girls, and, as soon as he’s in his dorm, Eve is storming in and wrapping him into a tight hug.
“Yeah? Why, was he not supposed to?” George questions skeptically, both he and Fred arching matching eyebrows.
Sometimes he does have to leap to the ground, but with his sense of smell and superior hearing, he slips past the students and lingering faculty with little issue, keeping to the shadows as best he can, before leaping up to another set of gargoyles.
Draco and Harry are quickly joining Blaise with raucous laughter, leaning against each other as they do.
“What do you three want?” Ron snaps first, standing up and glaring back at the Slytherin bullies.
“I’m sorry we couldn’t find your toad, Neville,” the young witch tells the boy. Neville sniffs once, but thankfully doesn’t begin to cry. Draco doesn’t do well around crying.
He’d, instead, snuck over to the congregation of Gryffindors down the stands and grabbed Longbottom. Gillyweed was one of the plants in his book, after all, so it made sense if he’d gotten it for Potter.
“And I think--” Draco’s brain processes exactly what Potter just said, his face falling slack and his eyes widening. “What…?”
When they leave the locker room there are people already waiting for them. James Potter surges forward first and promptly scoops Harry up, hugging him and swinging him through the air.
Draco had scoffed at that last one, not hiding his disdain, even when Harry gave him a sad expression. Draco wasn’t impressed, not even a little bit. What good did keeping his distance do? He was the most powerful wizard Draco knew, the only thing Voldemort feared, so shouldn’t he have been even MORE present than ever before? THAT would have protected Harry, not this avoidance, quiet, “I know what’s best for you better than you do” bullshit.
“If you get ‘Staying Alive’ stuck in my head again, Hushburn, I swear--”
“They need me, Max!” Eric’s voice can be heard in the background.
“Quite the turn around,” Draco muses, both amused and pleased as he watches.
“No,” Draco replies immediately, leaning back in his tub and rolling his eyes. “That wasn’t scary at all.”
He keeps eying Skeeter, though, throughout the lesson, confused by her clear interest in Hagrid when the young champion Harry Potter is standing right there.
His sharp tone does not have the reaction he had been looking for. No, instead of rearing back, looking hurt, or even getting angry, Finnigan and Thomas almost look entertained. No, scratch that, they definitely look entertained.
Draco sneers, nose wrinkling, before he schools his features and nods. “Hullo,” he says, chipper. He’d offer his hand, but both of them are stuck in their positions while their robes are sized. Draco takes a glance at the black robes almost identical to his own. “Hogwarts, too?”
“Tell him greetings from me, as well,” Draco nods.
“I dunno…” Daphne says, but she isn’t talking to Draco. She’s talking to the rest of the girls in the room. “I don’t think he actually has that much to worry about with Cho. It looks kind of like only Hermione and Cho think there’s something there.”
“It isn’t uncommon, when growing up with an understanding of the processes of magic, to create small, little spells of your own,” Leandra says helpfully. Her hair is also a mess, but she’s in much higher spirits. “Or alterations to preexisting spells.”
“A living person… Who is gone now, from this world. He will be marginally missed for the rest of our days.”
It was easier to use the radio with the window open. Draco didn’t know why, but Max said it was because of the “sat-e-light” signal.
“It’s not crucial,” Potter agrees, “I just would like to, and I think you could benefit from sharing this with more people.”
“Love and happiness isn’t a competition, Draco,” Harry says softly when it is clear he won’t be getting a reply. He moves closer to his boyfriend, who has gone still like a unicorn at wand point, and when he’s close enough his hands are framing Draco’s face. Suddenly, those hands feel like the only thing keeping Draco standing.
“Have to do what?” Eve asks, not sounding like she cares as she flips a page in her book.
Millicent scoffs sharply. “No one cares what you think, Davis. Everyone else knows Malfoy’s just scared the Dark Lord’ll kill him like he did Diggory.”
“Hey… so…” Greg suddenly cuts into Draco’s thoughts, looking nervously at the blonde. The impromptu lesson must have ended because Hermione is leaning back in her seat again. Greg glances at Vincent, who signs something quickly and nudges his shoulder, then looks back at Draco. “Are… Are you really…? I mean, the whole train was whispering about it a bit ago…”
“I…” Draco begins, voice cracking, and he stops to just breathe for a second. When he finds his voice again, he says, with his gaze distant, “Potter just kissed me…”
He quickly comes face to face with Neville Longbottom’s wide, shocked eyes, a dark trail rolling over his fingers where it leads to his warthog, as everyone around him smiles and laughs and pats his back.
Draco gives the radio a short glare, then turns and watches the emotions flit over Potter’s face, clearly baffled that this is what Draco has been doing for about eight years. More than half of his life. “Hey, peasant--”
Marcus Flint was sitting in the Malfoy Manor drawing room with Lucius Malfoy across from him. Draco did not understand why he was here. He had been called down by his father in the middle of the day to find the Slytherin Quidditch captain sitting there, seemingly out of the blue.
“Nothing ever goes easy for you guys, does it?” one of the twins questions, but Draco is too exhausted to pay them any attention and determine which is which.
“Malfoy!”
“You lost your toad?” Hermione says, obviously sympathetic for the boy.
Finally, the jellyfish begins to swim upward and Draco hurries to follow it, clambering up the drawers like they are a ladder. When he finally gets to the drawer the jellyfish stops at he’s out of breath and so grateful to finally be there. He pulls out a drawer on the cabinet beside him to sit on top of, then opens up the one he needs and begins rifling through the files.
“Yeah, basically,” Weasley nods, smiling proudly as the group oo’s and ah’s over his spell. It was certainly one of the more intricate ones Draco had ever seen.
When class is finally over Draco moves to get his bag as quickly as possible, but Professor Lupin stops him, requesting he stay behind, and the blond sags. Figures he wouldn’t have been able to escape so easily.
“There you have it. They’ll make sure you aren’t followed,” he says with a head jerk towards Crabbe.
Out of all the things in the World War 2 museum, few displays had really made Draco question its validity. With the realization that this was all an actual event that he had never even heard of before, he had become a bit more receptive and accepting of each explanation.
“Right… only children are pretty normal with folks like you…” the ginger boy says slowly, then looking around at the massive hall the party is taking place in. “So, which family is yours anyway?”
“Yes. Yes he is,” says a witch Draco recognizes as their prefect, Gemma Farley, who has brilliant, blue eyes, a thin nose, and curly, black hair. “Want some potatoes, Draco? You look like a dang twig.” Draco tilts his head in confusion before looking where Gemma is motioning to the table. A gasp escapes him when he realizes piles upon piles of food has appeared all along the tables, seemingly out of nowhere. But… how? Where had it come from? And how had he missed its appearance?
The smile dims as he watches, a tight feeling in his gut making him nervous. What is that feeling? It’s certainly not good… But he should be happy. They’ve won their first game, Harry is the star of the day, and he’s being gushed over by two, loving parents. Draco shouldn’t be feeling anything bad.
It certainly only got better when he saw the stricken, furious looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when the Slytherins emerged.
It is a stressful time, multiple people commenting on how tense Draco had become as of late. Potter even manages to convince Max to send them more Junior Mints, Draco’s favorite, and Tracey offers to steal some of Pansy’s Life-Mimic Figures for Draco to make him feel better.
It is only as he reaches the corridor that the Slytherin common room is hidden in that it hits him like a ton of bricks. He remembers a conversation at the Gryffindor table and Fred and George’s obvious distaste towards the Slytherins thanks to their Quidditch team. These were the cliché Slytherins. These were the ones that exemplified every, negative Slytherin stereotype. These were the ones everyone else used as an example when saying how bad Slytherin was.
“I’m not dead,” Potter mumbles and Draco hiccups, leaning down and resting his forehead against Potter’s own, his eyes squeezed tight to stave off at least a few of the burning tears. A sob still shakes his body and Potter squeezes him a little tighter. “Please, breathe. Nobody’s dead.”
you… but I don’t think you’re a bad person. I think your personality is crap, but not your morals… probably.”
“Happy to be back?” Draco asks softly, not even caring that he can feel snow under his shirt.
be quite a frightening thing,” Draco admits, but he is still having a hard time grasping the idea that his own father would be frightened of anything like that.
“I know what it is. Bane of a Death Eater’s existence, after all. My father would occasionally rant about their… ‘sleezy tactics,’ the hypocrite.”
“O-Oh, right… those…” Potter mumbles, his usual confidence while in the DA dwindling at the subject. It had to be a sore subject for him, it was for a lot of them, but… Tracey had a point. With dark wizards at their doorstep, and with incompetent DADA teachers the last few years, it would be important to know what to do.
“They’re all so…
“Dean?”
He ends up not getting much flying practice in. Vivian, in a bid to make Draco feel better, ends up talking with him for a while on some of her own inventing processes. It gives him a few ideas, especially when they go into charm work and how fluid but fickle it can be when applying it for very specific purposes.
“Then we’ll get someone else to do it! I’ll do it,” Potter offers urgently.
The remnants of Potter’s episode soon fall away, and he falls sideways into his bed, laying there and dragging his fingers through the fur on Draco’s back, only managing in getting Draco to purr louder and melt into the touch.
Harry makes a gagging noise and glances down at the Snitch still in his hand. Up close Draco can see the remnants of spit still covering it. He can’t help but cringe in sympathy.
“Obviously,” Daphne huffs, rolling her eyes, but still smiling.
“Oh, it is alright, Harry,” Luna says before bending forward to place a kiss on Tracey’s cheek.
This chapter went through sooooo many revisions y'all! I wanted to wrap up the year, but there's still SO MUCH that needs to be done! So, next chapter will be the end of year 5. Hope that's okay!
It’s not a pleasant or unpleasant experience, but the OWLs are certainly memorable. He wonders what the NEWTs will be like, in comparison. Certainly more advanced, but would they have the same planning involved, or would they take place all in one day like Max’s SATs and ACTs did?
He wastes no time burying his face into the shorter boy’s messy hair, just as Harry shoves his face into Draco’s neck. They wrap their arms tight around each other, looking for as much contact as they can get, and just cling. Draco misses what the other boys do, misses if they say anything at all or move to their own beds, he’s too happy to see his boyfriend in one piece.
That last one had Draco furrowing his brows curiously, but mostly he just felt overwhelmed. Right, McGonagall had said he was famous, but this was… This was a bit much, even for him. He loved being the center attention, but usually it was with only a handful of people over something unimportant.
“You will be coming down to the dungeons to get ready with me and the girls. You need an appropriate crowd to vent to, and we Slytherins are always eager to gossip.” Granger is opening her mouth to protest, probably to cite rules about inter house boundaries, but Eve hushes her. “I refuse to take no for an answer. You’re coming.”
“The school has their own brooms?” he questions, because that sounded spectacular. He so wanted to try out flying on one, and while he had been prepared to wait he still knew he would be antsy until he finally would get to try.
When he turns back to Potter, though, the boy won’t look him in the eye, his head lowered and face still burning red. Draco isn’t sure why Potter is so upset that they talked about his crush. It was clear Chang had been showing interest since the beginning of the year, so why was Potter denying everything? It was almost like he didn’t want it to be real.
“Yeah, yeah…” Harry sighs, and for a while Draco thinks that’s the end of the discussion. They focus on their wand work and incantations, Astoria drifts by to help Draco with a particular wrist movement he’d been missing, but then Harry is sighing miserably.
Gryffindor is making its way to the goal posts, Draco just about ready to strike, when there’s a cacophony of noise from the stands and Lee Jordan’s voice is cutting through again. “OHHH! That is a nasty fall! Can someone check if he’s aliv--”
“Malfoy! Potter! It’s time to get ready!” Marcus Flint cuts off their fun as he storms out of the Great Hall. His voice isn’t as biting as it usually is and Draco suspects it’s because of the presence of not only a teacher, but also an auror.
“How much of that was your dad, huh?” Max snaps, and Draco straightens up, eyes blazing. “How much were you quoting your dad there? Because he’s wrong! Those people struggling with their money aren’t asking for hand-outs, they’re asking to survive, and usually they have to ask the very system that dropped them where they are to begin with!”
“Perhaps he knew he would only make things worse with the pink terror? Weasley is surprisingly observant in the most peculiar instances,” Draco offers, though he can’t be sure. He can’t think of any other reason Weasley would bail like that.
“We do not use dol--”
Potter’s scandalized expression is completely worth the Earworm Jinx that lodges the “Macarena” in Draco’s head.
~ ~ ~
It takes the better part of an hour to go through them all, but finally he spots a familiar name. Except it isn’t Voldemort’s.
“What?!” Harry yelps, even higher than when Draco had stomped on his foot, and when he opens his mouth to begin denying the claim Draco gives him a withering look that shuts him up.
“She’s actually kind of cute,” Harry says, sitting on the ground beside Draco and running a finger along Muddy’s sleek body. Draco rolls his eyes.
“It’s wild!” Max chuckles, “Thank you. Thank you for being my friend, Draco. You really do mean a lot to me. Mama, Papa, and Eric, too.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Who should we tell? About the Killing Curse?” Potter questions as Draco goes to retrieve his satchel and camera. The distance that the movement puts between them seems to make it a tad easier to talk, for the moment.
“Young love comes and goes, and so do you,” Eve rolls her eyes, then moves towards Draco’s bed.
“You’re as bad as that Hermione,” Harry grumbles, settling back on the couch and closing his eyes.
“It’s nothing. Just… Be careful with that lot, okay? Don’t fall into their pack,” Hermione says quickly, too quickly, then picks up her pace. Draco nearly trips trying to keep up. “We have a Potions essay due soon. I think I’ll go ahead and start it,” she says briskly, making a turn for the corridor that would lead her towards the Gryffindor common room.
“It doesn’t make any sense, though!” Draco protests, confused and frightened.
“Would you like to know who managed to form their corporeal Patronus, Malfoy?” Granger cuts in, making the Slytherin perk up with interest. He ignores the grateful look Harry throws the Muggleborn.
,” he sighs and then they’re heading off for breakfast. Draco would love nothing more than to collapse in his bed and get a few more hours of sleep, but they need to present a strong front today. They cannot seem fazed by the attack no matter how upset they actually are.
“I’m doing well,” Draco finally replies, brows furrowing, then asks, “How do I say that in sign language?” That quickly morphs their conversation into Draco’s first impromptu sign language lesson, Vincent and Greg seeming to be overjoyed to share the information. Some of the other Gryffindors at the table even join in, the twins managing to make everyone laugh when they start making up signs for spells.
“Seriously, Draco! If there’s such a thing as casual dating, why can’t there be competitive dating, with points and prizes and stuff?”
“It began as a place to house magical creatures that could not be hidden from Muggle eyes, thus the name,” Draco replies absently. Each door had a plaque with a letter and number on it, followed by the corresponding animal’s name just underneath. The Lung Dragon was in F8, according to its file. “Now, however, they also keep endangered creatures, interesting creatures for examination, dangerous creatures, and creatures in need of medical attention, if needed.”
“You were a pretty big prat those first few years,” Harry nods, smiling, “But you are definitely one of us now.”
“Oi!” Potter shoves at him and Draco cackles, smirking.
“That isn’t what I said and you know it,” she snaps, raising her wand but Blaise is already pointing back at her.
“Okaasan takes me to Japan to see family pretty often and I’ve dropped by magical communities while I’m there. Longs aren’t some big secret in Asia like they are here. Not sure why that is, though…” Eve replies, tapping her nails against her mug.
Then again, if Draco had never gone out into Muggle London, perhaps he still could have considered himself a perfect son. A perfect heir. A perfect pureblood.
The mediwitch calls out to him, but he ignores her.
“It would be an even better plan if we just got rid of the pink terror,” the boy snarls, shoulders sagging, and Granger hums.
Draco lowers the letter when he’s done with it and hardly even bats an eye when Ada makes grabby hands at him and he passes it to her.
When Harry drags him to the Quidditch pitch it is with Ron in tow, Hermione staying behind to study. They find a spot in the stands to watch as each house has their turn with tryouts, other students coming and going throughout.
One thing Draco was quickly learning about Muggles is that they had the weirdest, and most interesting, of products. He’d never had the chance prior to the 1995 summer to truly explore Muggle places, his parents constantly looking over him, and he was eager to finally enjoy himself and explore the mysterious, Muggle world.
“Oh, get off your fucking high horse,” Potter sneers and Draco snarls right back at him. “I’ve been through hell and back, but nobody treats me like I have! Nobody will tell me anything or let me be a part of this Order, but expects me to do everything for them without question. I do not need YOU lecturing ME when all you have to do is act like the lying snake you’ve always--”
heard him.
“Uh, yeah…” the other boy says quietly, only glancing over, and Draco comes to the conclusion he must be shy. With that realization Draco decides he’ll take the reins of the conversation, going on and on about his racing broom and how unfair it is they won’t be able to take their own to school this year. He sprinkles in a little piece about his father, hoping to impress the boy with just how powerful he is, but it does nothing. If anything, he seems to withdraw in on himself.
“Tilt the broom down!” Greg calls, he and Vincent looking pale as their friend goes higher and higher. Neville looks down and Draco can see he’s paled too, his eyes wide as saucers when he sees the ground getting further and further, and then he’s tipping sideways.
The boy stops mid-sentence and looks over, green eyes wide with surprise. He probably hadn’t even noticed he was talking so much. “Oh! Yeah, sure. Go ahead.”
They skid to a stop somewhere in the trees, hopefully far from the monster, but definitely not where they should be either.
Harry lurches forward in a panic and Draco’s paws are moving before he can think better of it. He either needs to stop Harry… or he needs to back him up.
“What?” Weasley demands at the laugh, and Draco points at the medical supplies.
“Oh, quit being jealous,” Harry snorts, then leans against Draco’s back like he’s an armrest, apparently done trying to make him feel better.
Why wouldn’t they aim to look the best they could?
“America, and the Allied Powers, were the winners.”
It probably doesn’t help that Tracey, very abruptly, tells him never to become a healer. Ignoring better judgement, the new DA member asks for clarification.
In the end, when they get to the theater, two movies catch their eye. Draco thinks “Clueless” looks interesting, but Eve says “Apollo 13” was doing really well. Potter gets to be the deciding vote and they end up buying three tickets to “Apollo 13.”
So he goes in search of the man in question. He moves quickly, but not as recklessly as before, towards the castle entryway he had previously fled from. The corridor it connects to has tall arches that look out to the grounds, like glassless windows, but Draco can’t spot Moody from here. He’s probably moved on, Draco imagines, and heads into the corridor, his tiny claws clicking against the stone as he rushes along.
The world starts to fade when he finally feels pressure on him, he thinks they might be hands, but he’s already faded to black before he knows who it might be.
“Most venomous jellyfish in the world,” Tracey supplies and they glance at her, then back at the Death Eater.
He was just
“You said I probably haven’t told you everything about myself, right? So, I’m… telling you some things,” Potter trails off, biting his lip as if he realizes just how ridiculous he’s being.
~ ~ ~
They send Hermione and Eve out with Harry and Longbottom first. Longbottom can manage the limp Gryffindor girl while also keeping the invisibility cloak in place, and when they get to the floos Eve can take her the rest of the way. After that it is Ginny and Luna, with similar methods, and after that is Blaise and Theodore.
“Fine, I will get the food,” Potter rolls his eyes and stands, brushing off grass from his casual, Muggle clothes and as he heads for the castle Draco notes how they don’t seem to fit properly on his frame. Potter would have gotten those clothes outside of Hogwarts, while he was with his Muggle Aunt and Uncle. It felt like another piece to that puzzle that was looking less and less pleasant.
“I can try to talk to them… If you like,” Granger offers hesitantly.
Draco snorts. “Since when?” he jokes, ignores Harry’s glare, and continues, “We’ve always worked together to figure these things out, haven’t we? Just like the Greengrass’s worked together.”
After the last school year Draco had found more comfort in his solitude than anything else. Crabbe and Goyle were more frustrating than ever and he denied every offer his parents gave for them to drop by or vice versa. And speaking of his parents, they wouldn’t stop “reassuring” him that all would work out for their family in the long run. They were right to assume Draco was pulling away from them. They were wrong to assume why.
The bone shifts, growing in size and taking on a globular form first, before it starts to become more recognizable.
Draco doesn’t join the Golden Trio for their impromptu training sessions often, but occasionally he will slip into the empty classroom they are using that day and watch. He will comment occasionally, usually making Potter frustrated, for the hell of it, but sometimes even join in.
Eventually he goes back to dancing with Eve and Krum gets his date returned. Everyone seems in higher spirits and Eve pecks his cheek when she finally spots her real date.
This familiarity with the bizarre is only added to by having Tracey Davis as a housemate, and is probably why Draco finds Luna Lovegood’s existence far less insulting than others. Granger can hardly stand the spacey girl, but, after a few exchanges, Draco really doesn’t see any issue in the Ravenclaw. Certainly, he doesn’t seek out her company, and he doesn’t believe half the things she talks about, but he doesn’t brush her off the moment they cross paths.
“We should spy on them!” Fred speaks up suddenly, eyes coming alive with a fire that makes Drace weary.
A throat clearing makes both boys freeze. Slowly, eyes wide like a deer in headlights, they look over their shoulders and behind them. They had been flying above Hogwarts, after all, and apparently had stopped right next to the Astronomy Tower…
~ ~ ~
“So…” begins the redhead and Draco’s silver eyes lock onto him. He squirms slightly then nods, making up his mind over something. “I’m Ron Weasley.”
Draco shimmies even closer to the cobra, hand reaching out, and the creature makes a move of examining his hand, head swaying back and forth lazily. Then it leans closer and Draco lays his hand on the head of the creature. There’s a give, Draco notices, along the surface of the creature, before his hand slowly passes through the cool shadows. Not solid, but not intangible either, unlike the Patronus. A Militus has a little bit of heft to it.
They had been right. Edgecombe’s missing Galleon had not been in Umbridge’s possession… because it had been in Millicent’s.
“Yeah, Uncle Severus!” Sirius calls. He sounds like he’s holding back very loud, hysterical laughter. “He only wanted to meet his cousin!”
“If we split up we may have some luck,” Sirius sighs.
But she seems convinced of herself, telling them that while they are here, they will be happy to have the serpents on their side. Draco wonders if they have to look after each other so much because no one else will. It’s a dark thought, but judging by the reputation the house apparently had he wouldn’t be surprised.
“You’re doing an awful job of it.”
“I am pretty certain you are only succeeding in pissing yourself off, Scarhead,” Draco arches a brow.
Harry immediately hurries forward, nudging Weasley impatiently to get him on his feet again, while Tracey cradles the calmed brain in her arms like a baby.
Draco shrugs and continues. “Tracey Davis’s father works in Records. I know, thanks to her, his hours and that he will look the other way when we head down.”
With a huff, Draco shifts out of Potter’s grip, but only so that he can lay out on his side, pressed close to Potter, and the boy shifts to bury his face in fur with little hesitation, hugging Draco like he’s a stuffed animal, and shaking.
“Surprise visit to Harry. Might even stay the evening. Walk down memory lane. Fun stuff,” Sirius winks, backing away from Draco and heading further into town. “And that’s the story we’re sticking to,” he finishes off, then gives a mock salute before turning away completely and jogging in search of his godson.
“W-what?” he splutters in surprise, shaking his head in obvious confusion, and the merman rolls his eyes but keeps smiling.
Everyone seems to focus hard on their practice, dedication in every movement, even Smith. The only one, yet again, who isn’t all that interested seems to be Edgecombe.
“Precisely,” the Slytherin agrees, nodding to Granger in thanks, before looking back at Harry.
It is as Leandra is pulling back the book, looking particularly confused, that the wards wobble and Granger makes her appearance. Almost immediately the bushy-haired girl has zeroed in on the mysterious heirloom, clearly seeing how Leandra had been retrieving it from showing Draco, and her whole body seizes up.
“I’m happy,” he whispers back.
He attempts to work on homework, but he can hardly focus until he receives news.
“You’re probably just lazy,” Draco had shrugged. He could remember dates just fine, after all, so why couldn’t Max?
“They saved my life,” Hermione continues and looks around at them all. “They distracted it and blinded it until Ron managed to knock it out with its own club.”
“It’s hard to tell,” Max admits, “But I think he found one of the baby birds under his back tire… Or, I guess… what was left?”
So, they’ve solved the communication problem with Granger’s enchanted galleons. The issue now, however, is finding a location.
“Shall I be expecting a new hairstyle from you come next school year?” Draco questions casually as he takes a seat in the compartment with Eve. It feels like old times, the both of them alone before some of their friends inevitably crash the party.
“Weasley, perfect,” Eve says swiftly, looking to the ginger expectantly, “Your mom is brilliant, I hear, makes excellent food. If my mother disowns me for being a lesbian can yours adopt me?”
“And if he ever shows up at the Ministry, the Order is waiting to out him to the Wizarding World,” Weasley tacks on. Harry looks between his two friends, some of the fire in his eyes beginning to die out.
When Harry manages to catch the Snitch-Acting ball he returns and tells Vivian that it was much slower than a normal snitch. She makes note of that and then hands them both bats, grinning. “
“Reminds me of first year,” Weasley sighs dreamily during one of their impromptu meetings in the Room of Requirement. It feels more like a comfortable meeting room for the occasion, with a table in the middle surrounded by rolling desk chairs, a chalkboard on one end, writing utensils and parchment on the table, and enchanted windows that show different scenes depending on who of them set up the Room that day.
is always saying ‘different is good,’ but how can it be so good when it makes you feel so alone?” Max says, their voice quiet and downtrodden and it so shouldn’t be what they sound like. Max is meant to be lively, even when they’re upset. This is all wrong and Draco hates it.
Draco blinks at that, stunned into momentary silence, before he says, “Oh?”
“Always knew he had squishy insides,” Draco smirks.
He shrugs helplessly and, with one fluid motion, shifts into a snow leopard. Not a moment after does he realize something is very, very wrong. Professor McGonagall had mentioned that, as an animal, Draco would become more aware of the environment around him. Yes, his senses would be enhanced, but he would also notice a heightened sense when it came to barometric pressure. It was how most animals became aware of natural disasters long before they hit.
Also, if you want to follow me on any other platforms I have a
” Draco storms over to his violin case and begins angrily putting everything away.
Draco doesn’t have a response for that. They’ve already turned on and attacked Umbridge, Harry and the DA have infiltrated the Ministry, the Order is on their way… How much worse could using another floo really be?
“Y-yeah. Yeah, I’m fine, Malfoy, don’t worry about it,” Potter immediately waves him off, trying for relaxed and failing miserably. “Not sure when I’ll see you next so… Happy Holidays, Malfoy… See you.”
“Yeah, but they all shattered in their own department…” Harry says back, waggling his wand at her as he speaks. He’s really thinking this one through and Draco has no clue where he’s going with it. “All the departments house one, specific research topic, right? One of the great sources or mysteries or concepts of magic. In their most raw forms. What if, when they intermingle, weird stuff happens? That’s why they have to be kept separate.”
“Maybe,” Draco agrees, finally coming to a stop right behind the Gryffindor. His hands find their way to tense shoulders, squeezing slightly, before sliding up and pressing at Harry’s neck. The boy was just one, big, living knot and Draco doubted he could easily ease all of it.
I was really anxious about including SO MUCH more lore to the story, but in the end... I figured, the fundamental story remains the same, but you guys are here to read a rewrite, so I wanted to give you something a bit more to sink your teeth into! There's so many plot holes or openings in canon to fill in with magic interpretations!
” the black figure adds, like they actually can’t help themself. Draco assumes they probably can’t.
Draco stares at Eric. Eric stares back.
“It’s a stake out.”
“I absolutely did not.”
Luna, with a sereneness about her, smiles and offers to take the cup. The mediwitch huffs, but allows the Ravenclaw to help, and Draco sucks down as much water as he can as soon as the straw is within reach. He tries to smile at Luna gratefully, but it quickly vanishes. He has too many questions to be distracted for long.
The bespectacled boy is silent, head still ducked, but he hasn’t pulled his hand away from Draco so he counts it as a win. “This is where you’re supposed to be your real self,” Potter finally mumbles. “You’re not supposed to have to be the big, mean Slytherin here.”
The blonde frantically turns back around, eyes wide when he realizes Potter
A single shiver runs through Potter’s body and it could be frustration, anguish, fear, or anything, but Draco still squeezes his arm a little closer as reassurance.
“To be fair, she did say ‘no sexing’,” Eve snickers as she comes in, a new roll of newspaper in hand that looks a little different to the one her mother had been brandishing earlier.
“They do not deserve them! They were given to them out of pity!” Draco argues, remembering what his father had said on the matter after he had returned home, furious.
Death Eater movement, and just the general stresses of school - Draco takes to pictures a lot more than he had in previous years.
“I find Dumbledore’s actions peculiar, though, I’ll admit,” Draco says as he stands. Dumbledore had been hesitant, but pleased to offer Potter his temporary reprieve over the summer with Draco. It seemed odd to suddenly give the boy the cold shoulder. “We’ll talk on it later, however. We must be off.”
“Hey, we’re all Slytherin, here!” Pansy calls and, thanks to her track record, Draco can’t tell if she’s faking being offended, or she actually is. “We have to look out for each other, you know that.”
He turns and makes his way back to the front desk, presenting the cage to McGonagall and then the employee. The wizard looks to the cage in boredom before doing a doubletake and stepping back. “Hey, kid, listen, that owl… maybe not a good choice for a first owl,” he says, sounding frantic, eyes darting between the eagle owl and Draco as if expecting the bird to somehow attack from within her cage.
The silence is comfortable, the sounds of the lake against the windows beginning to lull Draco to sleep, when Harry rouses him with a slight nudge.
“Blood,” Draco immediately answers, confident in that at least, but Max’s father makes a noise in disagreement.
Place they most want to visit out of the country: Potter’s is India and Draco’s is America.
The twins give mock salutes before grinning and hurrying off, leaving Draco to roll his eyes and head for the Slytherin table. How he had become such an idiot magnet he would never know.
“That makes… a lot of sense, actually,” Harry had said aloud after some consideration, his brows furrowed. “Why don’t teachers utilize this stuff more, though?”
“You look so miserable,” Draco says with a wave of his hand at Potter, one of his brows arching derisively, “I’m doing you a favor, really. You clearly need some peace and quiet, and you won’t be able to do that if you are left alone to your thoughts.”
Slytherins didn’t take the fight lying down, though, fighting back with spells and insults, but that often meant everything escalated until a staff member stepped in. The Slytherins were not to be made victims of, but their opponents weren’t willing to back down easily, either.
only found out last year.”
Harry looks at Draco apologetically before he moves back to his spot he’d already claimed by Ron, occasionally glancing over at the blonde with pinched, worried eyes. Slowly Draco takes a seat on the ground, like most everyone else has done, and Hermione sits beside him, close but thankfully not saying anything. Greg and Vincent also move towards them, sitting nearby.
“Dumbledore’s rebuilding the Order of the Phoenix. It’s a--”
When he peaks open one eye to look beside him, Harry is facing him, eyes already open, and looking content where he lay. “It sounds like you both had an exciting adventure.”
“What, like with you? Don’t you want to keep talking to your rich friends?” Ron sneers and it is quite the impressive sneer for a six-year-old. It is almost as impressive as Draco’s.
“Would you have preferred it played with our skulls?” Harry snaps, not missing a beat, and Theodore splutters. When the tall boy has nothing more to say he scowls and spins on his heel, marching back to their dorms. They hardly miss him.
“I… I don’t want him to get involved…” Harry mumbles, ducking his head again, but this time for a different reason. Shame, perhaps? Either way, Draco shifts his grip to his wrist, pressing down firmly to urge him to stay calm.
“Well…” Harry starts, drumming his fingers on the table as his eyes trail around the room. There are a lot of modest, Japanese and Scottish decorations scattered around the entire apartment, including the kitchen, and it gives Harry plenty to linger on as he considers. “What about something from another country?”
“What? No! Of course not,” she quickly says, then looks away. “Hard for people to be cruel when they won’t even talk to you…”
When he arrives in the Slytherin common room it is, blessedly, quiet, and most of the people there only give him confused looks as he passes, shoes squelching from all the water. He thinks he is in the clear after that, certain none of his dormmates will ever attempt to bother him when he’s in such a sour mood, but the moment he opens the door there’s a very surprised call of his name.
Oh, right… and Weasley was coming along…
“No, I saw this dog back when I ran from my Aunt and Uncle’s house.”
“Gee, thanks…”
The prize money from the tournament.
Ms. Hushburn hurries to shut the door behind him, quickly locking everything back up, then marching back into the living room. “You,” she says, pointing at a startled Harry, “Sleep in guestroom. You,” she points at Draco, “Sleep on couch. I will have no teenage sexing in my house.”
“Three feet? Maybe? I dunno, that was at least… seven years ago?”
“Never took you for the ‘unregistered Animagus’ type, Draco,” Pansy purrs and Draco stiffens. “Thought you were smarter than that.”
Ada Babbage was the middle foster child and had chaotic, dark curls she kept in a ponytail, sharp, clever blue eyes, and a rebellious, uncaring streak that put her at odds with Frederick on more than one occasion. She would probably be Draco’s favorite, if one could say he had favorites. Yes, they all looked out for each other. Yes, the Nubbles took good care of them. Yes, Frederick, Ada, and Draco shared an experience not many others could understand. That didn’t make them “family.” They didn’t feel like that to Draco, and apparently the same went for the other two kids.
“It’s just…” Draco starts, trailing off, then glances back at the windows. “We have such a great opportunity here, I don’t want to waste it.”
“Here,” she says and the goblin finally looks up, examining the silver key without so much as blinking his black eyes, before grunting and sliding away from the counter. He doesn’t say a word, but McGonagall begins to follow after him and Draco scurries to keep up. “Yes, you have a vault,” the elder witch finally answers Draco as they walk through a side door and quite abruptly the beautiful marble and bronze on the entry hall morphs into a dark, stone tunnel lined with torches.
James offers a firm pat on his shoulder before offering his final good-byes and finally heading off. Draco turns back towards Harry once the Auror has disappeared around the corner, finding the boy waiting patiently, his mother also absent.
“Millicent seemed really excited about You-Know-Who coming back…” Crabbe says quietly, ducking his head when everyone looks at him.
“No… Just…
“Hey, Draco,” he greets cheerfully, smiling at the blonde as he moves to put his books on his bed and his backpack underneath. The messy-haired boy had been in a great mood ever since their talk with Sinistra and Draco would hate to throw him off that with deep, emotional talk about their house.
Having his eyes opened, truly, to his family’s blind hatred was terrifying. He had attempted to deny it, attempted to keep being a good son, but then he would feel sick with himself, or they would make some witless comment about superiority, and it was just easier for Draco to retreat.
What he finds is a large clearing filled with a modest-sized herd of thestrals.
Potter’s laughter as he retreats to the castle is backdrop to Draco’s realization that he really, really didn’t like Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
Each of them would practice what they already knew while attempting at least one new spell, then hopefully share it with the DA when they got back. Potter was attempting to make a few lesson plans ahead of schedule and looked like he was getting a particularly nasty headache.
“That was beautiful, Dragon. You have practiced very diligently, and it shows,” Draco’s mother says warmly, her smile soft and relaxed but so full of pride it makes Draco puff out his chest.
“Of course,” she says simply, then straightens out her head. She blinks a few times at Draco, watchful and blank, and it is beginning to unnerve the boy. He’s never had the Astronomy teacher’s attention on him for so long. “Five points to Slytherin.”
Tracey turns her head slowly towards the ginger, silent for far too long for comfort, before saying, simply, “I like tails.”
“Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, like you once were,” he says slowly, like he’s teaching a particularly difficult student. “She is also helping us today, so please behave. And don’t tell Potter. He wouldn’t react well.”
“I doubt it’ll clear up much,” Potter comments flippantly and Draco glances at him, brows furrowing.
Edgecombe slowly rips her gaze from Draco, instead looking at Umbridge, but she still looks terrible. “It… I…” The longer it takes for the girl to attempt to speak, the more displeased Umbridge slowly becomes.
“I…” Draco shakes his head, his face pinching as he tries to realign his whole worldview. This was how it had been the whole time? And he’d missed it? “I always had it as the Golden Trio in my head. I never included myself…”
Draco can’t help but grin as Potter pulls out the little, stuffed cat in clear confusion, glancing at Draco for answers. “I… may have mentioned your favorite animal was a snow leopard,” Draco cackles, and Potter rolls his eyes at him.
“You’ll get banged up too, I imagine, tryin’ to invent spells. It can go in WAY worse ways than all my stuff,” Vivian hums and finally looks up at Draco. “Who, what, when, where, why, and how.”
“I’m eccentric,” Draco immediately scoffs, flicking his head and looking out over the lake. He hadn’t been paying close enough attention to his taunts. He needed to be more careful if he didn’t want people catching on.
Draco looks over, wide-eyed. This was considered old? This stunning thing? Sure, it was big and tacky, but he’d never seen anything like it before. How was it considered old?
“Possibly? But, Ron, I just said we have no proof. Don’t get your hopes up.”
“Show us. Right now,” Granger demands and Weasley raises his hands placatingly before pulling out his own wand.
Very suddenly Draco was the most interesting thing in the room as wizards and witches approached him, speaking too quickly for him to follow, but he picked up a few tidbits. “Is it really him?” “White as a sheet all over, must be.” “How’d you do it?” “You must be so talented!” “We all owe you so much. Thank you, thank you!” “The-Boy-Who-Vanished finally appears.”
He also had far more things to concern himself with, such as this flying class on Thursday.
To most of the students it would sound quite nice. Lily is a great teacher, and very encouraging, and Draco is sure he’ll learn a lot from her, but Harry only mumbles a weak, “Yeah…” before hurrying to gather up his things.
And an impressive stack of books from Max’s mother.
“Yes. He did,” McGonagall nods, then turns slightly more interested eyes on the blonde, “But not you. No one knows how, but you survived his killing spell, and in doing so destroyed him instead. I suspect you have a scar from the encounter?”
It had to be a trick, he decided. He walks between each pillar between the two platforms, but nothing happens. He thinks back to when he went to Diagon Alley and begins tapping stubbornly on bricks against the wall. He was getting odd looks, he knew, not helped by Tootsie’s presence, but he didn’t care. He was getting panicked and covering it up with frustration.
They’d been reading it together after they’d realized none of them had ever gotten around to it before. Granger had called them a book club. Draco had called her insane.
They stand there for a long while, desperately trying to pull each other back together, with the sounds of hooting owls in the distance.
No one says anything when Tracey finishes her little speech, her voice blank and vacant as ever, and Draco is momentarily reminded of a similar sentiment Max had shared with him some time ago.
saw Professor Quirrel mumbling something too!”
Draco reaches up to stroke Harry’s cheek, running his thumb over tan skin, before saying in the most posh, ridiculous voice he can manage, “All for you, my dear.” Harry snorts loudly, giving him an exasperated smile, before kissing him again.
“Because he’s a dick?” Potter snaps.
McGonagall steps out of the cart and offers her hand to Draco, helping him out as he stares at the door, approaching after the goblin. It feels like the emerald eyes in the snakes are watching them the closer they get.
Potter and Weasley, to Draco’s side, are nearly doubled over laughing at Draco’s misfortune, having to hold onto each other for support.
half the time?!” Potter explodes, throwing his arm that was not hit with Draco’s jinx around in a desperate manner. “They say Voldemort wants a weapon and they’re guarding it. Okay, what weapon? Oh, lovely, you won’t tell me and I have to be left to wonder and worry what’s going on? Great! Because THAT hasn’t happened before!”
They take a moment, no longer clinging to each other, to wipe at their faces and straighten out their robes. It’s an awkward shuffle to compose themselves after, once again, falling apart in front of each other.
“What? You’re going to keep this from the rest of your house? Good luck with that!” he scoffs. Draco glances down at where Muddy’s tail hangs down his chest and cringes. He was right. If he had a snake with him it would already seem odd, but something like this was bound to get out to the rest of their house.
“And she keeps tabs on the Floo Network?” Eve mumbles around the bobby pins and clips in her mouth. “That’s definitely not good.”
Harry wanted him to let go, to show all those ugly, nasty parts of him that he tried to bury away. They’d seen each other at their worst behavior, but still Draco was terrified. This wasn’t about bad behavior or acting out or calling each other names. This was about a side to him he had always hated, even before he got his act together. This was about a side to him that he feared would chase people off.
“I got her after I met you, actually,” Draco replies, reaching a hand through the cage bars to scratch lightly at the owl’s shoulder.
“That’s… I am hardly telling people lies,” Skeeter says sharply, shaking her head and a few strands of hair falling loose. She looks positively mental.
“Me? Well, my shoulder is healing, you already know that--” Draco begins, a little perplexed, but Harry shakes his head.
“Ada, what are you doing in here?” Frederick’s annoying I’m-oldest-and-trying-to-act-like-it voice calls as he enters the living room wearing rubber gloves and a bandana over his head. Cleaning the bathrooms, Draco suspects. “You still have chores to do!”
“With a hat?”
“Having fun?” Harry’s voice pops up right behind Draco, making the blond yelp, jerking away in a violent lurch. He spins around immediately, glaring at the smirking Gryffindor.
It is during a DA meeting, Draco talking in hushed tones with the twins, when Daphne and Astoria Greengrass approach Harry. The lesson hasn’t started yet, everyone getting settled and joining their friends, but the Slytherin sisters look like they are on a mission.
Draco braced himself, ready to push off, but he didn’t get the chance because Neville, in a panic, jumped off from the ground early and was starting to float away.
Draco flips through the pages and stops on a page nearly at the end. He smirks at it eagerly. “This one’s one of my favorites,” he says and Potter, yet again, leans in close.
“In my nightmares… Sometimes it’s Ron or Hermione. Sometimes Sirius or my parents… Sometimes it’s you…” Potter presses closer, like he’s reaffirming Draco is, in fact, there and alive.
Before the dragon Harry stands, staring up at it in shock before he’s spinning around to face his friends. He says nothing at first, no one does, but then he’s throwing his arms out and barking a shocked, amazed laugh.
“We should head up to that building. See if the dragon is there,” Draco decides, flinching at the way his voice echoes. They turn and carefully make their way up the stairs, not wanting to slip on the damp stone.
He regularly had tea with Umbridge, usually the day of a DA meeting so as to get a read on her knowledge over the secret organization. So far, she was none-the-wiser, but that still meant Draco had to listen to her vitriol. Draco hated to think that at any time of his life he’d sounded anything like this woman.
Marietta Edgecombe was winding up to be the only person in the whole DA that Draco was suspicious of. Smith had proven to be devoted to the lessons and Blaise appeared to be enjoying himself with everything he was learning. But Edgecombe hadn’t calmed down throughout the entire year.
“Granger…” Draco says slowly, feeling an unhappy pinch in his gut, and he lowers his book to glare at the girl. She’s at least not crying anymore, which makes his harsh tone a lot easier to come by, “You have no idea where my ‘horizons’ were to begin with.”
“Leandra says they’re doing all they can. Smith’s apparently plotting murder.”
Arthur Weasley had been found, attacked by Voldemort, in said Department of Mysteries. Voldemort, if he was attempting to get something from this place, would not have drawn attention to it by dragging Mr. Weasley’s body there, so logically Mr. Weasley was already down there.
A penknife that could unlock anything? That sounds like something that could have been remarkably helpful in the past! How long had Harry had something like this and conveniently forgotten he owned it? “Where’d you get that, then?”
They’d all left the Room of Requirement afterwards, adjusted it into a guest bedroom, and let Skeeter inside on her own. Unbeknownst to the reporter, Draco had placed multiple charms on the door that would tell him if she attempted to leave and snoop around.
When Draco moves to his trunk to pull out his robes he finds his school schedule sitting on top of it, outlining his and the other first-year Slytherin’s classes. He sets it to the side to look over later, not wanting to get distracted, and hurries to get ready. As he passes Harry’s bed on the way to the bathroom he uses the robes in his arms to smack at his head.
Draco gasped, imagining the images of cartoon witches all over the television on Halloween, riding broomsticks with their black cats. “Professor McGonagall!” he says breathlessly, “Do witches and wizards fly on broomsticks?”
Weasley motions to Draco’s satchel sitting on the floor. “I know where you hide them.”
“Who is the anonymous member?” Granger questions, confused.
“Draco! Harry!” Vivian calls, splitting away from where she’d been talking with her blonde friend with the wide set eyes - Draco thinks his name was Jason - to approach the boys. “Go get your CD player! I got a new CD from my little brother this morning!”
make me happy,” Draco insists, because it’s true. “I feel like I can relax around you--”
“Hate to break this to you, Draco,” Sirius smirks, “but you’re part of that merry band by this point.”
But there he was, right in the Great Hall, walking around like he was meant to be there.
“Also, the only difference between blood is blood types and I bet you don’t even know yours.”
Max scoffs, which has been happening a bit more often lately. Draco thinks they’ve gotten it from him. “We ain’t poor, but we ain’t exactly rich neither. We just don’t have the funds for a brand-new bike.”
“Should we…” Potter mumbles, then gulps around the lump in his throat. “Should we… talk about… the other thing that happened…?”
!”  she says brightly and suddenly the sound is amplified until it fills the entire room clearly. Draco, startled, laughs brightly as “Monster Mash” plays through the common room, a few Slytherins getting up to dance when the music picks up even though he doubts they know the song.
Harry groans, squirming where he lay, but doesn’t get up. Draco rolls his eyes at him and reaches out to ruffle his hair more roughly than necessary. “Come on. I’m sure the cold, hard ground is very comfy, but I’m not carrying you to our room,” the blonde smirks as he stands, hands coming to his hips and he looks down at Harry. When the boy doesn’t immediately get up Draco kicks his side, then runs for the dorm room as Harry yelps and scrambles to chase after him.
Umbridge begins interrogating Harry like this is a casual ordeal, but with every answer she grows more sporadic.
“I placed your Trace readings to this Ebru woman, unbeknownst to her. When the Ministry eventually links the feed back to her, she is sure to be demoted or, even, sacked, thus giving Terence Davis his hours back. My debt repaid to his daughter, and a familiar face returned to the Records Department for my own needs, I gain two victories.”
Then, today, Draco had come out with Eve to investigate and had discovered the bone had, in fact, been the transfigured body of the previously missing Barty Crouch.
“Could you two move any slower?” Draco calls out to them.
“They ignore the Trace for students during the school year, even during breaks, since they’re constantly surrounded by magic and it would be pointless,” Draco explains.
Mrs Nubble held no such feeling, however.
“Don’t get any bright ideas. We limit how much you can exchange the other way,” the goblin warns and Draco sighs. So much for his sudden desire for a GameBoy… Maybe he could transfer money over to Muggle currency over time and save up?
“Ah, I see,” the elder witch hums, evidently not at all affected by this look either. Dang, Draco couldn’t win with her… “I suppose we may try something from a stall, if we must…” McGonagall doesn’t look too pleased to be eating anything from one of the street side vendors, but Draco is too excited to care.
But Skeeter just smirks at him as she turns and saunters off.
“Most radios have a very finite distance, Draco,” Max’s father explains, then motions to the display covered in what are surely old radios. They are so much bulkier than the one in Draco’s grip. “But these use the satellites up in our orbit to talk to people much, much farther away. Why, I bet I could talk to you from all the way back in America!”
your pout, my dude.”
It wouldn’t do to just throw it out…
Well, Draco assumed they had to be fresh. If the ingredients were being stolen through the year, that meant the potion was being made regularly.
Something within Draco had felt broken and betrayed, but he couldn’t place why, and he had cried to Max’s mother that night for what felt like hours.
“Check,” Draco patted the old trunk.
Sinistra’s office was just down the corridor from the Astronomy Tower. The door looked like any others in the castle save for the single, silver star that hung on the front. Harry was the one to reach out and knock, but before his knuckles even touch wood the door opens inward on its own. The two boys look to each other, the dread pooling in their chests wanting to overflow.
For a moment the figures stare at the giggly ginger without moving. Draco wonders if they can be baffled by his stupidity as much as the rest of them can, but then they’re speaking.
“Speak, peasant,” Draco snaps, “What were you talking abou--”
“He is an unknown,” Draco replies, hands stuffed in his pockets to stave off the cold. He quite liked the cold, but usually because he liked bundling up and getting warm after the fact. “I do not like unknowns. I asked Sirius to do some research into him along with Bertha Jorkins.”
“Uagadou does not use wands,” Sinistra says, looking to the blonde, “Though I do own one for more complex spellwork.” Then she is outstretching her arm and holding the broom out to Draco without a word. Draco swallows, nerves trying to get the better of him, but he manages to reach out and take the broom in both his hands. Harry leans towards him to get a look as well.
Ginny scowls in anger and, as Weasley is raised back up, his now-bloody lips match his sister’s.
He catches a final glimpse of a massive shadow swimming past the window, lazy and relaxed in its movements, before he shuts his eyes and lets the sound of the lake wash him into the realm of sleep.
“You don’t know that,” Harry immediately retorts, hands flexing at his sides, and Draco rolls his eyes.
“What did I do with what?” Draco questions suspiciously, not certain what Max might mean.
“It’s already done, Malfoy, it’s not like we can stop it now,” Weasley grumbles, crossing his arms defensively.
“And I still disagree.”
“You weren’t even a Seeker,” Harry continues to mumble and Draco finally approaches, smiling charmingly up at his friend’s father.
Lucius smiles at him and nods, letting Draco scurry out the door and out of sight.
It is while he is ranting over how unfair the Slytherin jocks are that Draco begins to truly bond with Ron Weasley. Dinners after practice are usually spent at the Gryffindor table, as far away from their teammates as they can get, and Draco holds nothing back as he vents. Ron, and a lot of the Gryffindors, think his word choices are particularly funny and often times will join in with their own stories about the Slytherin team.
“You used that term before,” Mr Nubble spoke up again, leaning forward slightly, brows furrowed. He looked much more curious now and hardly batted an eye when Ada came and sat on the arm of the sofa beside him. “Muggleborn.”

“They’re jerks, but it’s worth it so far,” Draco agrees. “Did you know that our Keeper, Bletchley, uses the word malarkey constantly? Like, unironically, too.”
“Draaaaaaacooooo!” The sudden, loud call startles the white snake and he slithers away quickly, vanishing into the plants. Draco scowls at being interrupted and looks up towards the house, seeing a tall girl smirking at him.
“See? You can be taught!”
“You look acceptable, Granger,” Draco says with a smirk, bowing his head in greeting.
“Sure, sure, but Daphne’s always looking for romance novel stories rather than real life,” Eve huffs, then turns to smirk at Draco, “I was talking to her and her sister the other day, actually. Did you know Astoria thought you and Harry were already dating?”
“What about you, Eve?” Granger looks to the other girl.
