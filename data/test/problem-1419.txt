Harry ate the rest of his breakfast in silence, eyes still glued to that certain Slytherin. There was an alternative to going to the library, hell, even an alternative to Hermione. But Harry wouldn't ever consider it. Not when Flobberworms fly.
Hagrid chuckled through the tears that threatened to pour onto his rosy cheeks and hugged her back, crushing Ginny just as tightly as she was trying to crush him. She laughed with him as they broke a part.
Ron was currently slurping up his second helping of spaghetti bolognese, Hermione telling him to slow down. "You eat like an animal."
He left it at that for the time being, turning to the sink and washing his hands, even though he hadn’t touched anything but the spatula since he washed them last. Draco felt bile rise in his throat. Just the implication of what Harry said… it made him want to hex someone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione instantly cut in. "Absolutely not, Theodore. Isn't there a cut off for those so obviously intoxicated?"
She held up the bottle of Gigglewater. "I'm afraid I'm stuck with tending to the bar."
And so they continued their not-quite comfortable silence well into the evening until Ron stumbled up to the bar, an irked-looking Hermione in tow. She apparently had been either getting ready for bed or was in bed by the time Ron had got to her because she was wearing her Gryffindor dressing gown (every student got one in their house colours each year... it was quite much in Harry's opinion) and her bedroom slippers.
Harry gave him a raised eyebrow. The boy chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Just was helping Dean practice a bit on the pitch. He's super excited about making the team, wanted to get started right away..."
"I wouldn't say that," the second tapestry was in sight, the exit to the main hall in the dungeons behind it. Harry turned to look at Malfoy. He found him grinning, dare he say, almost cheekily. It was refreshing after seeing him looking like he'd tasted something sour just moments prior. "You seem to befriend all kinds of dangerous creatures. I'm sure that at least 75% of your friends could easily destroy all of Hogwarts in a matter of seconds, if they wanted to."
So besides a sneak peek of the official description, you also get an explanation of the meaning behind the title/format! So the title is going to be based off of one of my favourite poems, which you'll see when it comes out. There's a lot of symbolism I've done based around the poem as well, and it makes my little literature analysis loving heart sing :') There's also some meaning behind the amount of chapters/letters in this fic as well. Hypothermia (which Tommy is experiencing in this fic) can be broken up into six stages, according to
Hermione smirked, and said in her quoting-voice, "The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid."
"Alright, dears, stay close!"
Potter remained quiet at that, shrugging his shoulders.
They toured the first floor formal living room, Kreacher parading around and showing Draco some of the Black family heirlooms that still remained. It was quite the sight, seeing Kreacher practically glowing with pride. After the living room, they stopped by the doorway and discussed the mounted elf heads, the troll foot umbrella rack, and (quietly, so she wouldn’t stir) the portrait of Draco’s aunt. Harry cringed and had politely told Kreacher that they should let her sleep when he began to draw the curtains back to show Draco the painting. Kreacher’s ears turned down and he blushed a little— blushed! The elf was a completely different person around Malfoy, Harry swore— and continued up the stairs to the second floor.
Ron began dragging them forward towards the dormitories. "I'm aware. An' don't call me that."
It was true; since eighth years only had to take their NEWT classes, their schedules were more or less cut in half. They started classes at eleven o'clock, ate lunch at noon, and then studied until four (or five, if they had a double lesson or demonstration that day). But that didn't mean that the eighth year students were let off the hook; the house elves did not have to provide their service to the upperclassmen, with the exception of cooking and such. So the students were left to their own devices when it came to cleaning and laundry. McGonagall had suggested a chore chart of sorts, which most of the Gryffindors and Slytherins resented and most of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws adored.
______________________________
The first secret he kept was that his first kiss was with Blaise Zabini while they were both drunk on his Mum's yacht. A mistake Draco cringes at even now, five years later.
"What?" Draco bristled at just the mere implication that there was something more important than what was happening with Grimmauld Place-- at least where these teenagers were concerned. "This is a matter of
The dynamic seemed to shift between Malfoy and Harry as they made their way through the old house. It went from a soft, shared melancholy to something a bit warmer. The smiles came easier, and each room brought with it Draco’s quiet pondering and curious touches. Harry watched him with a soft smile on his face, until they got to the fourth floor.
So because of all of those stressors, I will be on another slight hiatus from this fic. I feel so incredibly terrible about it, as I was really excited for the next couple of chapters, but it is what it is.
Harry nodded and, when he began to walk to the kitchen, didn’t bat an eye when Draco followed him.
Yknow, 2020 just keeps getting worse! I don't know HOW, but it does lmao
She adjusted her position, setting her book down and snatching the blanket off the arm of the couch Harry was sitting on. "Some Austen. I've been feeling a bit homesick."
Suddenly, there was a loud crack to his right, signalling the return of the house elf. Draco immediately breathed in the smell of black tea as Kreacher passed him a cup. "Thank you," he said, folding his long legs under him as well as he could in the narrow armchair. Kreacher bowed, then turned to fix Harry his cup.
“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to—”
TL;DR:
Krecher nodded eagerly.  “Yes, certainly. Then would Master Draco like Kreacher to give him the grand tour?”
Harry nodded. "I get that." Although their roommate assignments were the same as they were in Gryffindor, the rooms themselves were completely different. The walls were covered in a deep purple wallpaper with some kind of shiny, Victorian-esque pattern. The beds were stiff and felt like they were new— Harry missed the old, magically preserved mattresses that were stuffed with goose feathers and smelled of frankincense in the Gryffindor tower. Lying on the new bed felt like lying on a stranger's. "We'll get used to it, though," he said eventually.
Potter looked thoughtful (for once in his life). Draco knew the implications of what he was proposing, knew what kind of metaphorical lines he would be crossing. But if he ignored it-- and the growing feeling of pure
His eyes still surveying his surroundings, Draco nodded. “Yes. Thank you, Kreacher.”
Hermione quirked a brow. "Yeah, you haven't noticed?"
“Happy Christmas to you too, Luna.” He bowed in a similar fashion. “Have any plans for holiday break?”
Harry’s favourite room in the house was easily the kitchen. It had a more homey feel to it than the rest of the house did. The walls were lined with tall black cabinets and a wide cobblestone hearth. There was a permanent cauldron fixed on one half of the cooking surface and a grate for holding pots and pans on the other. Harry had never seen a fireplace such as this before, and he’d only cooked on it a handful of times. Kreacher said it was a classic witch’s stove and that it was meant to be used with magic, made the food taste better. Harry wasn’t sure what difference it made.
Both the elf and Harry turned to Draco, eyes wide in surprise. He’d commanded it so quietly, but the authority in his voice had not wavered. He looked at Kreacher unnerved, eyes half-lidded. The way he held his resolve filled the air with tension. Kreacher shied away from his gaze.
Hermione twisted her coiled hair around a finger, tugging at it until it was pulled taut, and then let it spring back into its tight curl. Something she did when she was nervous, something that constantly happened during exam season. "Do you remember sixth year, and how you were, um, engrossed in the actions and intentions of a particular Slytherin boy?"
Harry continued towards the snitch, ignoring the commentary and all of his surroundings. If he could just keep his eyes on it, not lose sight of it, he'd win it all for sure. He weaved in and out of the other players, refusing to look away from the snitch even for a moment. He was sure Malfoy was on his tail, but he kept going, circling the pitch and eventually making his way towards Ron, who was over at the keeper's post at the Gryffindor goals. Jimmy Peakes, who had just whacked a bludger away from Harry, shouted something unintelligible, and Harry mistakenly, for a
She seemed to blush slightly at this, but with the dim light, Harry couldn't tell for certain. "What do you mean?"
"Goodnight, Kreacher," Potter said, officially dismissing him, and Kreacher was gone with a crack.
As he set the ingredients for tea out on the long wooden table, Draco watched, a curious look in his eye. His face was bathed in the warm light from the candles clustered in the centre of the table, their flames lit indefinitely and wicks never shortening thanks to some simple spellwork. He looked softer here, more boyish than he did at school. But when he noticed Harry looking, something clouded over his expression and his lip curled ever so slightly as he said, “You can’t feel it, can you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
, Potter?"
“You can ask you know. It’s okay.”
There was only two things Draco Malfoy had never told anyone.
Enjoy the chapter :)
And if hypothermia wasn’t about to send him into a deep slumber.
“Yeah, but supposedly this time he means it. Mum thinks he’s gonna propose to the lucky lady.”
"Tea for me as well. Bring along the milk. No sugar."
Harry sighed. “Well, things have been… kind of off with Hermione and Ron, lately.” Draco nodded, but kept translating runes as Potter spoke. “We’d always been close, even after they first started dating. It had always been the three of us. But recently, things have been kind of weird between us”
Harry woke up to snow on the third Saturday morning of December. It had been snowing lightly on and off for the first half of the month, but earlier that week, a blizzard finally hit, and the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were blanketed with a thick layer of the stuff. The windows in the busy hallways of the castle were frosted around the edges and there were snowdrifts halfway up the glass on the main floor. Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny navigated the packed halls with confidence, used to the yearly chaos of leaving for winter break. Ginny and Harry walked side by side, trunks and bags and Pigwidgeon’s cage towing behind them.
The air stilled between them. Draco felt like he'd said something wrong, but it was all true. He was seen as a villain in the eyes of history, and not even Potter's public defence of him to the Wizengamot during Draco's trial could change that. "I guess that's true..." Potter's eyes wandered to Draco's left arm, and for a moment, just a moment, Draco forgot how to breathe.
Malfoy stopped in the middle of the corridor. He mirrored Harry's stance, hands in pockets, eyes looking anywhere but at Harry. "You are aware that I have no desire to practice Dark Magic."
It was at this moment that Ron walked through the door to the common room (it wasn't the Fat Lady and her passwords, but rather a mirror that you had to bow to before it would allow you to walk through it). He was carrying two paper grocery sacks, Dean and Seamus in tow with similar packages.
EDIT: Thank you for all the sweet comments and kudos. We broke 2000 hits within two days of this A/N-- that's absolutely wonderful, and certainly brightened my day. I love you all, and please stay safe this holiday season (Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, and Happy Kwanzaa-- and any other holidays you may celebrate <3).
A month had passed since Draco and Harry had began spending their evenings together, or rather, since Potter had been crashing Draco's nighttime routine of not sleeping, doing homework, and making more Wideye Potion. He'd said it before and he'll say it again: it was weird. It was so weird to spend time with Potter, to drink tea at three in the morning and pretend like it was the most normal thing in the world. But alas, there they were, Draco sitting in the high-backed-chair and Potter sitting on the floor, sipping on their respective drinks on another early Wednesday morning.
infographic, so that is why I've done six letters-- each one based off of the symptoms of the stage Tommy would chronologically be at in the story. I think it's pretty neat; which is ironic considering I typically hate reading epistolaries, but am writing a whole story based around them. Oh well, writing fictional letters is a lot better than reading them.
Potter was silent for a moment, his eyes glazed over with something Draco couldn't place. Draco sipped at his tea, a strange sense of melancholy washing over him; Potter would not let the house die-- would he? Why should he care anyway; it wasn't Potter's home to begin with. Draco wondered if the boy felt only a sense of obligation to the house rather than actual cherishment for the property. Perhaps it was just another one of Potter's endless benevolent deeds; who knows what is going on in the git's head.
"Kreacher believes so, but the magic will have to be stronger. Master Harry will have to enlist in the help of his friends or the Ministry of Magic to rework the wards after experiencing the grief and emptiness of late."
The two continued to discuss Potter's plans to move into the Black family home, practically forgetting Draco's existence. But that's alright.
Kreacher ducked his head, hiding his face from Draco. It seemed he was holding back a snicker. "Does Master Draco require anything of Kreacher before he goes?"
"Well, for starters," Draco said, trying to keep his voice level, "I have spent years in a pureblood wizarding home and have extensive knowledge of how one works. I've raised the manor's wards plenty of times and have placed my own before. Secondly, the Black estate is familiar with me, even though I haven't been there in over a decade," At this point, his voice sounded reminiscent of Granger's, and it filled Draco with an odd feeling-- not quite disgust, but perhaps resentment? "It'll take a while, maybe a couple of days to adjust to my presence, but once it does, the home will work with me a lot more freely than it would with you."
Hullo all, it's been... a long while. A third of a year, roughly. Pretty crazy times we're living in, huh?
Potter screwed his face up, turning to Draco. "What's that supposed to mean?" He looked to Kreacher. "The wards are grieving?"
Ron's slightly widened eyes turned from Pansy back to Hermione. "Yeesh. She sure is something."
I will label scenes that are extremely triggering (if there will be any at all), but not stuff that I think is equal to what was written in the actual books-- just be cautious and aware that this fic may contain things you don't want to read. That is all.
Draco completed six problems in the time it took Harry to speak up again.
He drank to so much more than he could ever thank Harry for outloud.
Draco’s brow quirked. “How old were you when you started cooking?”
“Thank you,” he mumbled, continuing to do his work. “For the advice, I mean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time the tea was prepared, Kreacher had returned and was acting like a giddy child, ready to give Draco a tour of the house. It seemed as though it took all his willpower not to tug on the young man’s sleeve as he led him up the stairs to the main floor.
And if you're new (hi!! glad you're here!!!), please note that chapters are split into two POVs; half of the chapter will be in Harry's POV (daytime) and half will be in Draco's POV (nighttime). That's all for now. Enjoy the fic!
"Well, I'm sure you all will do great!" Neville responded, a little too loudly. Ron started awake with a grunt and, nearly falling out of his bed, struggled to whip his curtains open. The ginger chewed out Neville while Harry finished getting dressed for the day.
Draco bit his lip. Part of him wanted to remind Potter that he wasn't doing this for
"Harry, what're you looking at?" Ron asked before stuffing his face with a piece of toast piled high with bacon and eggs.
They both knew that was subject to change, but neither said it outloud. Instead, they enjoyed the quiet and warmth of the library as they did each other’s homework. A bet is a bet, after all.
The "little get-together" Pansy claimed to have been throwing was actually more like one of those raging house parties you see in coming-of-age American films, and Harry was positive that no one had bothered to ask McGonagall for her permission to have this small event. Someone had charmed the candles to flicker rainbow, and the streamers Ron, Dean, and Seamus had brought earlier were charmed to dance around the chandelier in the center of the ceiling, all of them glowing a bright lavender. A Muggle radio had been smuggled (probably by Ron, Dean, and Seamus, too) from Professor Cloven's office— the same radio that's used in demonstrations for Muggle Studies. Britney Spears was blaring in the common room, and Hermione was right: it smelled of sweat and alcohol, and nearly every student was bumping and grinding to the music.
. "Yeah," Ron chimed in, not-so-subtly taking Hermione's hand beneath the table. "Mum is rather disappointed I'll be gone, but she seems to understand how big this is."
He shut his eyes, rubbed at his left temple. Perhaps the headaches he'd been getting were also a side effect of the potion? "Yes, that'd be fine," he mumbled as he rose and searched the shelves of books that belonged to the common room. Kreacher and Potter spoke for a few moments before the crack of Kreacher's departure rang out. Draco finally found Book of Potions, Volume II and flipped to the familiar page.
WOAH. With that author's note (Nov. 2020 Update: that A/N has been deleted) I posted last night, we gained TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN HITS *screams*
"Nothing, nothing," Harry grabbed his mug of tea from the coffee table in front of him and took a sip. "It's just that plain old streamers don't quite seem Parkinson's style."
A blush blossomed across Harry’s cheeks. “Er, yeah. Haven’t gotten around to changing much.”
"Oh, I'm listening. I just don't care enough to respond."
She narrowed her eyes at him, but the smile remained upon her lips. She let the words sit between them a bit before replying sarcastically, "You, Potter, are quite the charmer when you're drunk."
Potter looked at him. His eyes narrowed into a look that one would normally call scrutinising, but on him, it just looked painful. "You're not even listening, are you?"
For one, it was increasingly obvious to Harry that he was, in fact, at one point or another, maybe a little bit obsessed with the git. He had the faintest memories of staying up until the break of dawn staring at the Marauder's Map, waiting for "MALFOY" to appear in tiny font, along with even tinier footsteps, revealing his exact location. He also remembered going down to the Quidditch Pitch in his invisibility cloak to watch him practice, and even following Malfoy back into his common room afterward to make sure he wasn't plotting or whatnot. But Harry had always told himself that he was doing it to protect his friends, his fellow students, his
(Even if Draco did technically win it.)
Potter smiled a little at that and sent a shrug Draco's way. The way they were sitting, interacting with each other, was familiar to Draco. The light bickering, the slow smiles Potter sent him, the now relaxed posture-- it was the same routine they'd had for the past few weeks. And for some reason, Draco could never get over one of Potter's famous half-smiles without feeling like he was about to burst into flames. Luna's voice filled his head as Draco tried to ignore the slight flush he felt coming on,
"Yes, I remember. You wouldn't stop sobbing into Grandfather Cygnus' robes until he made you drink a Draught of Peace." Draco smiled at the memory of a loopy Kreacher eating a whole tray of biscuits at the reception, then declaring himself the "biscuit king" before passing out in Uncle Rodolphus' lap.
Harry tensed as he stirred the simmering vegetables. He spoke with an air of nonchalance, but his knuckles turned white around the hand of the spatula. “I was in the kitchen a lot as a child.”
Draco frowned, dipping his quill in his ink pot. "I don't."
"I suppose I could stay there for Christmas break. I need to start getting acquainted with the wards; Hermione's been on my case about it."
"Mr. Potter!" McGonagall's shrill voice pierced the air and interrupted his reading. His textbook and his quill case were both puddles on his desk.
Harry did so flawlessly, to McGonagall's surprise, and, as soon as her back was to him, he reopened
Harry's head almost fell off of his hand. "What."
Nights Spent With a Somniphobe has been discontinued for the foreseeable future, and I've come to announce it with a heavy heart. BUT: new fic is in the works. A Dream SMP fic that's canon divergent, centered around Tommy and Technoblade's alliance during the Retribution Arc. It's gonna be SO COOL, can't wait to share the Prologue with you all on Friday <3
“Yes, it happened years ago. He doesn’t talk much of her—”
"Er," Potter said, as eloquent as usual. "Malfoy. You're awake."
"Oi, what're yuh doing?"
"What should that entail?"
At breakfast, he sat, his eyes glued to the blond's back as he sat with Luna, eating crumpets and jam. Although he hadn't said anything, not a word about Malfoy, his friends made it clear to Harry that they were not in the mood for another Malfoy Rant, similar to the one they'd received the day prior. This caused Harry to ramble off a few meek attempts at defending himself, which were immediately shut down by Ron and Hermione. The pair had then changed the subject to easier things, like Ron's excitement for Quidditch practice that evening and Hermione's feelings towards her NEWT level classes, leaving Harry to stew on the fact that Malfoy was sitting at the Ravenclaw table like he was sorted there.
, and she's too 'busy'?"
“That’s horrible.”
"Yes, I will admit that it was complete luck that you got the brand new textbook in sixth year and I got the one the good ol' Half-Blood Prince used. I am one lucky lad."
Draco heard Potter mumble something under his breath, followed by a startling crack. He turned to face the noise only to find a house elf bowing deeply to Potter. Draco recognised Kreacher, although eleven years had passed since the last time he saw him at Auntie Walburga's funeral. He looked like he'd aged twice that, and for some reason he was wearing a golden locket around his neck. When he righted his posture, Kreacher's large eyes landed on Draco.
? Is that even allowed?"
"And did you ever realise that the house was sentient?" Draco's voice wasn't brash, nor were his words filled with ill-intent. He simply wanted Potter to see things his way, the way any wizard with a basic understanding of magical homes would see things, and arguing with the boy certainly wasn't going to get him there. "Did you ever notice the house adjusting to your presence? Did you ever notice the small quirks that came with it, things you couldn't move or couldn't fix because it seemed like the house just wouldn't let you?"
Harry trailed off. What was he even going to say? What is there to say? Theodore said nothing, still drying that same glass which had to have been dry by now. Harry watched with minimal interest, mind going blank. He couldn't quite focus on anything particular; his vision was too fuzzy, mind too foggy. But he felt warm, from the inside out, for the first time in a long time, so he kept sipping his glass until there was nothing but ice cubes in it.
Her eyes shifted from Harry's to Ron's, her lips pursing after a sip of her drink. "Well, you see Harry," she said, returning her cup to its saucer. "Ron was actually going to come over to mine this year."
Either way, Draco was annoyed.
Hey everyone! I've missed writing so much. Please enjoy this new chapter, and make sure to read the end notes for some important updates and info. Thanks guys :)
Harry nodded as Neville rambled on, not particularly in the mood to talk. The boys got dressed and prepared themselves for the day as he talked about some photo preservation spell that Augusta Longbottom had invented. Eventually, while they were tying their ties, Neville seemed to get the message that Harry wasn't up for a conversation and gave him a warm smile, anyway. "Sorry, I've been rambling haven't I? Anyways, we'll talk more about your spell later, then. Have a good breakfast, Harry."
As Draco turned towards Potter, he could already tell that the latter had gotten it wrong. "Really? I got 'The coughing crow...'"
"Am I interrupting?"
This was traditional; every Quidditch game played on the Hogwarts pitch began with a handshake between the two team captains before the referee threw the quaffle. Harry was used to it, but it felt... different this time around. Looking at Malfoy, with a scowl on his face and annoyingly (un)perfect hair, Harry just, God, he didn't even know what he was feeling. But before, when he would grip Malfoy's hand and look him in the eye, it felt like there was a fire deep in his stomach. And also like he wanted to punch something (preferably the prick's stupid face), but now...
Draco dropped the book he was putting into his bag, landing in it with a harsh thunk. "You didn't even know that there was a difference between a normal house and a wizarding house a month ago, and you think you're qualified to save one by yourself?"
Pansy was light on her feet, dancing around the two other Slytherins tending the bar (Harry didn't recognise either of them). She was pretty— puberty had been quite kind to her— and she'd grown into her tall and lanky frame with a grace unbeknownst to Harry. Her makeup was done dark, making her cheekbones stick out like blades and her eyes pop. Harry wondered when this happened, the whole Pansy Not Looking Like A Bulldog thing. The other Slytherins seemed different too. Not just physically, but... socially. Since boarding the train, those who had meaner streaks in the past kept to themselves.
Ron tsked back at his girlfriend. "You know that we don't start classes until eleven tomorrow, right?" He earned himself a displeased look from Hermione. He gave her a small, teasing smile. "That's plenty of time to drink some hangover cure and get on with it."
Harry looked at him, the word "incredulous" written on his forehead in permanent marker.
Draco bowed his head in response. "Same to you, Kreacher."
Harry awoke to the sound of Ron snoring loudly and Dean and Seamus whispering to each other as they got ready for the day. It was quite a cold Saturday morning for it only being early-November, but Harry didn't mind the chill in the air. He sat up in bed, stretching out his arms and legs, feeling the satisfying crack of his joints as he woke himself up. His sleeping habits may have been poor, but at least he slept deeply when he finally did manage to stay asleep. Three to five hours a night may not have sounded like a lot, but Harry could survive off of it.
Draco had approached Potter after dinner in the common room, while other people were still there. This was unusual for the pair, and Draco knew it. But Potter looked very uncomfortable while studying with the Granger-Weasley couple and Draco took pity on that.
Potter nodded dumbly, but didn't move. Something seemed different about him. Perhaps it was due to Draco's rather uncharacteristic desire to speak with him at what some may consider a "decent hour." When he finally did get up to move, he more or less brushed off Weasley's badgering and followed Draco out of the common room
"Here's that Gigglewater for you," she wiped her hands on a towel that was half stuffed in the pocket of her skirt. "Let me know if you want another."
"Strange." He sighed, shaking out his writing hand and setting back to work. "You see, I prefer to do my homework during the day, like a normal person."
"You and your old-timey literature..."
"Are you alright?" Potter asked, sitting on a pouf to Draco's left.
She rolled her eyes, shook her head. "Sweet Aristophanes..." She began to turn away, probably to serve one of dozen other drunks in the room
"Theodore. Nott." He said, avoiding eye contact with Harry.
EDIT: In case you are a reader who has been with me since the beginning of this fic (hi! I love you!!), you may notice that there is half of the chapters than originally published. This is no accident! I ended up combining chapters to make them a bit longer and to overall have a more cohesive reading experience. Nothing has changed plot-wise-- chapters one/two are now one chapter, three/four are now one chapter, so on and so forth. Thanks for bearing with me while I work out the oddities of writing :)
Draco turned towards the two, the elf's words catching his attention. "I never thought about that... Oh, Potter, you've got a mess on your hands, now don't you?"
TRIGGER WARNING: Death, Slight Trauma Mention (stay safe!)
Potter interrupted his reading. "So... who were you talking to earlier?"
"Alright," Malfoy said, clearing his throat. "The ministry sent the paperwork we both need to fill out in order for me to stay with you during break, and I must say, it's--"
Harry nodded, eyes trained on the wood floor below him. His stocking covered toe traced a crack in one of the floorboards as he said, “We’ll plan on it, then. Anyways, I was about to make dinner. Would you care to help?”
"Damn, so close!" Harry sipped at his drink. "So, Nott..."
They stepped into the foyer and Harry bounced a little on his feet as he walked. “We could take a trip to Diagon Alley, if that’d be helpful?”
. While he did so, the professor hissed, without turning around, "And put that dastardly book away, Potter!"
. He was panting and had beads of sweat dripping down his face, hair mussed and looking wild. It made Harry's heart skip a beat. Malfoy's arm was stretched out in front of him, mirroring Harry, and he looked so full of light. Like he was reaching towards the shiniest star, the brightest of jewels. And, God, Harry just
"Wut?" Harry said around a mouthful of toast.
From that point on, throughout the class, Harry's eyes would find Malfoy's. Why, he wasn't sure, but it sure as hell pissed him off. He also didn't know why it made his blood boil, but the thought of Malfoy looking at him made Harry want to punch something. No matter how many times Harry's eyes drifted off to that side of the room, they always seemed to meet a pair of glassy grey ones. Draco Malfoy had soft eyes, which was strange for a bloke such as him. Everything about him was sharp-edges: pointy chin, knobby arms and legs, prominent collarbones--
"No, not at all," Harry stood, stretching an arm across his chest. "I should be heading to sleep anyway. Thank you. For..." He shrugged, looking everywhere but at Draco. "...the help."
And in that moment, he promised that he would spend however long it took to repay him.
"Mate... What happened?" Ron asked him when they were back on the ground.
Draco huffed and brought his legs up into the chair, slinging them over the purple-velvet arm. He used to know exactly what it was that bothered him about Harry Potter: his fame, his stardom, his stupid handsome face, his obnoxious remarks and lack of eloquence. But now, he had no idea what it was about him that made Draco want to rip his hair out. He seemed so different, but still so... Potter. He was still obnoxious, still famous (maybe even more so), still stupidly handsome (definitely more so). But he seemed to have grown up since the war, as they all had, really, and he seemed to have a certain interest in Draco. Or perhaps Potter was just doltish and didn't give a shit about what interacting with Draco meant.
Potter's face reddened, ears and neck darkening right along with it. "No, not at all! I just don't want to bother you so much, especially when the house needs your presence more than ever."
"Letters Tommy would write, if his hands weren’t frozen.
He showed him more than the drawing room, of course.
“We will be owling you more information on resources in this time of need. You should receive the pamphlet by the time you arrive home, or by the time you return to your common room, if you are staying here for the holidays. Please do not hesitate to contact any of the staff if you are in need of anything. It is our number one priority to be here for our students, and we truly and deeply care about each and every one of you. We all hope you have a holiday break filled with love and whatever joy you manage to create with those you love. Thank you.”
"You're over-dramatic and tend to have some stalker-like tendencies," Ron interrupted Hermione's rambling.
Although he still looked crestfallen, Kreacher nodded. "Kreacher understands. Kreacher will send Master Harry's tea back to Hogwarts with his owl come tomorrow."
Seeing the train felt like coming home to Harry.
Kreacher bowed, taking that as his dismissal. "Very good, Master Harry. Kreacher will be awaiting its arrival." He turned to Draco, bowing once more. "Kreacher thanks Master Draco for his kindness. He hopes he'll be seeing Master Draco more often."
Harry gladly stumbled through the outskirts of the dance circle to his dorm room. The lights were dimmed, and someone was sitting on their bed, reading a book. Harry recognised him, but couldn't figure out who it was. His brain was yelling at him, telling him that he knew exactly who it was, but it felt like Harry was underwater. He couldn't focus on anything except his bed, which once was perceived by Harry as uncomfortable and stiff, but now looked as comfortable as a cloud to him. He collapsed onto the duvet, giggling when his glasses rode up his face and rested on his eyebrows. He readjusted them and attempted to unknot his tie with one had, the other one not wanting to cooperate for some reason.
Harry sighed, but did as he was told. As he grabbed his quill to jot some notes down, he caught the eye of Malfoy, who sat across the room. He sat with proper posture, and continued to write as he snickered at Harry. Harry couldn't tell if he was mocking him or if he was laughing with him; but since when did Draco Malfoy laugh
“I bet. You and Malfoy are sure to have a nice time; I hear you two have gotten quite chummy lately.”
, he was doing it for his family, for the house, for his own goddamn piece of mind-- but he just nodded. Potter collected his things then turned on his heel, making his way to the boy's dorms. And Draco sat there, staring at the Gryffindor's bedroom door long after it shut.
Harry smiled at the elf. He’d tidied up for the occasion, looking as though he’d recently bathed and even combed over the few hairs he had on his otherwise bald head. “Happy Christmas to you too, Kreacher. Would you mind bringing our trunks upstairs?”
“Well, I am quite excited to try it. It smells heavenly from over here.”
"Holy Hera, you're still on 'bout that?" Ron says through a mouth of noodles and sauce.
Last night, after his study session with Malfoy, Harry had slept better than he had in a long time. No nightmares, no tossing or turning. Just blissful, dreamless sleep. He had to shake himself out of it, shrug off the blankets before he fell back asleep and missed breakfast.
Potter rolled his eyes, head following their motion and lolling to the side. "And interrupt their 'couple time' together? Yeah, no thanks."
Ron just shrugged. "Nev's not the only one who's been getting cosy with the snakes. Parkinson and Zabini aren't that bad once you look past their whole 'I'm going to bite your face off' demeanor. I don't know about that Nott kid, though; he seems quite cold, but Neville sure has taken a liking to him."
She raised her other eyebrow, earning a snicker from Ron, who was to Harry's left. Her eyes darted over to him, looking like a cat who was ready to pounce. "Oh, and I suppose you, Mr. Weasley, would also like to lose Gryffindor some house points?"
He blushed, rubbed his elbow with one hand. "Well, you see Harry, I was wondering if after classes you could teach me more about the spell you showed me last night. I know you have Quidditch tryouts to oversee tonight, and probably homework to do, and people to catch up with, but I have lots of questions about its mechanics and how you and Hermione came up with it. It sounds a lot like this spell my Grandmother tried to teach me when I was..."
The feast in the Great Hall went as it normally did, but instead of the man with a long grey beard and high-heeled boots beneath his dress robes speaking to the school, Minerva McGonagall gave the opening speech. It was strange, without Dumbledore, but it didn't hurt like Harry thought it would. Over the past year, Harry had learned things about Dumbledore that he almost wished he hadn't. Because now, after what felt like decades of stewing and brooding over the memories, everything in Harry's mind that had to do with the old man was locked up in an angry, red box in the in back of his mind that he refuses to touch with a ten foot pole.
"Hey, 'Mione," Harry asked when the couple in front of him had quieted for a moment to sip at their teas. "You were planning on spending Christmas at Ron's, right?"
He smiled wide, squinched up his eyes and nose and everything. The whole nine yards; the kind of smile he doesn't normally show. "Yup!"
Potter sighed, but Draco could’ve sworn he saw the hint of a smile on his face. Draco passed him his worksheet. He hesitated. For some reason, he felt like this conversation could make things confusing and, well, awkward. But he pushed forward, trying to act casual. Circe, when did his problems become so trivial? “Alright, spill. And give me your Runes work.”
"How can you stand to do this every night?" Potter tapped his fingers on the desk idly as he spoke.
________
"You're good company, Pansy."
"As long as I'm with you, you can go anywhere you like," Harry shoved his hands in his pockets, looking at his feet while he walked. "Well, anywhere besides Knockturn Alley and places of the like."
"Shut up, Ron."
Potter's face twisted into one of confusion. "You're drinking Wideye potion at three a.m? What's the point in that?"
Harry rocked on his heels. “Uh, how about some tea, then?”
END TRIGGER WARNING
But sadly, Harry had no such excuse to lean on this time around.
"Who will be helping you restore the wards?"
This man was relentless.
"I–I was talking to—" The train's whistle interrupted him, and Harry hadn't even gotten his trunk on board.
Well, there goes hoping for a peaceful evening, Draco thought. Potter was truly getting on his nerves at this point, and for fuck's sake he didn't want to put up with it.
With a crack, he appeared in front of the boys. “Good evening, Masters. Welcome home, and Kreacher does wish you a happy Christmas.”
Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, and Ancient Runes-- all NEWT level classes, all equally tiresome. By the end of the day, Harry had a 36 inch essay for Charms (due in two days, thankfully), a chapter to read for Transfiguration, as well as a chapter and practical work for Ancient Runes, and a personal essay for DADA. Harry was just thankful that he was allowed to split his schedule for DADA and Potions in half. McGonagall had owled him a few weeks before the term began, telling him that due to his special circumstances, the Ministry would allow him to only have three year-long NEWTs, as long as he still took one semester of DADA and one semester of Potions, two classes he'd excelled in during his time at Hogwarts. It was a very generous offer, and Harry had personally visited Kingsley to thank him for it. Ron was granted a similar allowance, only having to take four year-long NEWTs to become an Auror since he didn't do as well as Harry did in Potions sixth year. Hermione was told that if she had any passion for magical politics that she there would be a waiver equal to that of Harry's, but she rejected it, not only saying that she would never work for the Ministry, but that she also would never miss out on the opportunity to learn in a professional setting like Hogwarts. She isn't exceeding five NEWTs, which Harry is thankful for, and she has just enough to pursue a career as a healer if she wishes.
The boy shrugged.
Hermione gave Ron one final look and then turned back to her porridge. "Why do you ask, Harry?"
The boy and the house elf conversed in low mumbles, something about Potter's house and repairs needing to be done. Draco tried to focus on his book, his tea, the fire-- anything but Potter, but he was just too damn tired to make an attempt at minding his business.
It was half past two. He remembered looking at the clock in the common room before going to the dorms to lay down. It had read one o'clock.
As the songs turned from popular dance anthems to more mellow tunes, Harry returned to the makeshift bar for more drinks. A boy with a head of mousy, brown hair served him instead of Pansy, who was busy with a group of Ravenclaw girls. He looked familiar to Harry, but he couldn't quite place where he knew him from. The boy was drying a glass with a towel, looking like he was working in an old-timey saloon rather than a crowded room full of stupid teens. He didn't greet Harry, didn't acknowledge him expect for giving him a glass of firewhiskey and a flat look.
_____________________________
Draco jumped and turned to face the voice to his right. "No."
The painting chuckled then, nodding in understanding.
"Fine," Draco said briskly, turning his nose up in the air.
"Well, it's getting late," Potter said, draining his cup. Draco's had been empty for ten minutes. "You should get some sleep, Kreacher. Thanks for the tea."
"Book of Potions, if you must know." He saw Potter nod out of the corner of his eye. Eyeballing the page, skimming for anything relevant to long-term side effects, Draco sighed. He couldn't focus with the feeling of Potter's eyes on him. It felt dozens of spiders crawling under his skin. Draco felt his face flush as he let out a small "hmph" and brought the book back to his spot at the table. Tucking it into his book bag, he saw Potter watching him to his right.
She smiled at him, softer than before. "Thank you, Potter. But you are also drunk, and I'm on my way there, so I don't think it's quite fair to make judgments at this point."
And finally, thanks for reading. Comments and suggestions are appreciated-- kudos as well; they let me know that you guys actually want more of this story, haha. I hope you enjoyed this new chapter. If you did, please keep an eye out for more of my content!
After a moment, Harry shook his head slowly and an unreadable look passed over his face. Draco continued. "The house may be in your name, Potter, but you are by no means its owner. You were unable to provide the house with the respect one would normally give it, if they knew of its magical history. Thus, it will not respect you, and it certainly will not allow you to raise its wards until you've earned its respect," he looked like he was going to defend himself against Draco, but the blond kept going before Potter could get a word in. "It's not necessarily your fault. Maybe if you'd paid a bit more attention during school, you would've had even the most basic of ideas about wizarding homes and the such, but to be fair, you've been a bit preoccupied for the past seven and a half years..."
Suddenly, the trolley beneath Harry's grip hit a crack in the cement of Platform 9 3/4, causing it to jostle rather unpleasantly. Harry stumbled, and the cart ran over someone's heels. He heard a small yelp and the scuffing of shoes on the pavement.
Potter chuckled, slumping forward again. The air was easy between them tonight, and there was something about the chill of the mid-October air in the dungeons that made them more relaxed. For Draco, it was the familiarity of it all. He'd spent countless nights in the Slytherin common room, curled up in front of the fire with Pansy, Blaise, and Theo, all huddling together while discussing the events of the past day, breathing in the same air as he was now.
After breakfast, the three of them made their way back to the common room. Ron and Hermione led the way, while Harry lagged behind them, smiling and nodding whenever someone would wish him luck with the game that afternoon or thanked him for his "heroic actions" once more. It seemed that the first years were never going to treat him like a peer. Harry didn't mind it too much, anymore; they were young, and the way their eyes shone with childlike wonder was refreshing to him. He sometimes just wished all of their enthusiasm was thanks to his Quidditch plays or his friendly disposition rather than his celebrity status.
His friends chuckled. Ron shrugged. "People change, I guess. That's just how it goes, right?"
Harry chuckled. "Yeah, yeah." He then paused, growing slightly more serious. "Why are you already homesick? It's only the first day, 'Mione."
"Another?" Nott asked when Harry set the glass on the bar.
Draco shook his head. “I think I can manage without any more outside assistance, at least for the first few raisings, but we could potentially run into a few problems down the line. It may be beneficial to plan a trip for tomorrow.”
And with that, she pushed her way into the sea of teenagers and disappeared. Harry laughed at Ron's incredulous look and put all of his weight against him. The ginger groaned, leaning into Harry to counterbalance the force of Harry's body on his. "Your girlfriend is scary, Ronny," Harry mumbled.
"They are getting weaker, Master Harry. Reverting back to their abandoned state. You must make a visit," the elf was saying.
Draco stood, folding his arms. Maybe there was a point in lying to him. "What's it to you, Chosen One? Shouldn't you be heading to bed anyway now that Mummy Kreacher has made you a midnight snack?"
Draco turned back to his work, continuing to translate the given prompts. "Uh huh."
"What'd you get for 7.E?"
When did he get to the Great Hall?
He rolled his eyes. "No, but I don't see why--"
Stay safe. Love you all
"Don't look at me like that," he said to the portrait hanging across the room, feeling its unliving eyes on him. It was hard to write an essay with Albus Dumbledore's portrait staring at you.
"'Mione was right 'bout you," he said when their outburst had finally died down.
That feeling only grew when he walked into the Great Hall. As he made his way to the opposite side where the Gryffindor table sat, the room grew silent. The quiet spread like the plague over the room and all eyes turned to look at Harry, but every time he tried to catch someone's stare, no one was looking at him. Hermione and Ron continued to pretend like nothing was wrong when Harry sat down, making conversation and chatting about Quidditch tryouts that afternoon. As he served himself some toast, the room around Harry began to grow tumultuous once more. Ginny and a couple of other seventh year Gryffindors were teaching the first years the school song, Dean and Seamus were pointedly Not Talking about last night, and Neville was sitting over at the Slytherin table.
Feeling bad for asking so much of the Hogwarts house elves this early in the morning, he decided to just call Kreacher and see if he could prepare Harry a cup. It's probably make the elf resent him a little more, but Harry would rather wake up only one elf rather than two dozen. He figured he should probably step away from the dorms to call upon the elf, since he didn't want to wake anyone, and made his way into the common room.
It'd be fine.
He was trying to make this difficult on purpose, wasn't he? "Grab your books. I need your help with something."
I want to give a gentle reminder: As many fandom conventions have been cancelled/rescheduled these past couple of seasons due to the virus, many people in our community (specifically) are not only suffering physically, but financially as well. If you could take the time to talk to, spread word of, or even donate to/purchase from fan artists, writers, or cosplayers you love, do so. Obviously monetary support is amazing and has very immediate effects for any content creator, but many of us cannot give our support in that way at this time. Even reposting their work (with permission/credit, of course!) or just taking the time to tell them that you admire and appreciate them helps content creators just as much in the long run!
“Oh, I doubt that. Charlie doesn’t seem like the type to propose in front of family, especially when bringing someone home to meet his family for the first time.”
Draco led the pair to the library. Potter walked at his side, quiet, but presence so loud. He was buzzing with magic, practically humming. The hair on Draco's arms stood up like it was static instead of the magical energy of someone with too much on their mind. Draco didn't want to pry too much; that was always harder to do in broad daylight. So he stayed mum and just basked in the glow of Potter. It was almost too much, the amount of magic the man possessed. Draco sometimes forgot how strong he was, physically and magically-- he seemed so different compared to when he was in the midst of saving the world. He seemed so far away back then, so out of reach.
"Yeah, but like, what about our rules?" Harry stared completely dumbfounded as Neville laughed at something Nott said.
"No," Potter stated simply, sipping at his drink. "I didn't."
Tryouts went as expected; Ginny, Ron, Demelza Robins, Ritchie Coote, and Jimmy Peaks were all back on the team, with Dean Thomas joining as a new chaser. Harry didn't realise how much he'd missed flying, and using his new broom (a SilverStreak 100, the newest broom on the market. He bought two more brooms for Ron and Ginny's Christmas presents, given only a few months early. He's still planning on getting them other things, though, despite their protests) felt like flying on nothing at all. It was so responsive, much more than his Firebolt, and felt like another limb to Harry. He'd missed the feeling of the windburn on his cheeks, hair tangling, ragged breathing, and the cold sweat of an intense game. Quidditch was the one thing Harry was naturally good at; searching for a snitch was second-nature at this point, and he couldn't wait to get back on the pitch and actually compete against the other houses.
"Anyways," Seamus disregarding Ron and Hermione, "She sent us to get some decorations." He reached into his bag and pulled out a roll of...
"What's going on in that head of yours, Potter?" He started, looking at Draco with wide eyes.
Harry had whiplash from the change in topic. The girls continued to chat as their small group followed the rest of the crowd into the Great Hall, but Harry tuned them out a little. He didn’t realise what (or rather who) he was looking for until he saw it: blonde, messy hair and a bored expression. Draco Malfoy looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. It made Harry’s heart race to think that “anywhere” in this case probably was his own home.
"Anyways," he continued, "My point is that you need someone experienced with wards. And having a Ministry-appointed wards master would probably be near impossible over the holidays because of their ridiculously small task force. So with the Ministry and Granger both out of the equation, it would be in your best interest to take me on for the job."
"Except for Ginny!"
And then he was gone and Ron was suddenly standing in front of Harry, looking at him like he'd turned into a numpty. "Mate, what are you doing?"
The boys remained silent while they waited for the kettle to boil. The more Harry focused, the stronger that pulling feeling was. It made him uncomfortable, reminded him of the Dementors and the horrible feeling of being pulled out of your body. But this kind of pulling wasn’t malice, nor was it painful— it was desperate and filled Harry with a quiet melancholy. Perhaps that’s why Draco seemed to be acting so strange. If he could feel the effects of the wards more intensely than Harry, he had to have been feeling the grief even worse.
“Where’d you hear all that?”
It's been a long few months. I'm nearly graduated now, have been accepted to college (and honors college!), and am about to close this chapter of my life come May. I'm terrified; I'm excited. So many thoughts have been going through my head, and it's because of that (and aforementioned reasons in the previous A/N) that I haven't been posting so much on this account.
The wind in his hair and the smell of fresh air always brought out the best in Harry. Smiles came easier, his focus was sharper-- and he didn't have to worry about schoolwork or friend drama or other dumb things that didn't really matter either way. He had a simple goal with only minimal distractions; it was essentially how he wished his life could be at this point.
"Well," Draco tapped his Defence notes with his quill, "You can tell me about it while working on my Defence assignment for tomorrow."
Ron smirked, seemingly cocky all of the sudden. "Yeah, what about it?"
Draco looked at him quizzically. "What do you expect me to do, get a new travel allowance every day my presence is required at your estate?"
Potter ignored Draco's snarky response and requested a spot of tea.
Potter gave him the side-eye, but passed him his work nonetheless. The two worked in silence, Draco figuring Potter would open up when he wanted to. The quiet was nice, and felt just like studying in the common room in the wee hours of morning, where just the two of them would sit in front of the hearth and talk quietly amongst themselves.
Ron’s eyes narrowed at Harry, something akin to concern shining in them.
Harry stretched and twisted his neck. "Never better. What's gotten into you, Neville?"
He looked Hermione in the eye and shrugged, just as aloof as he had been towards Harry for the last twenty minutes. He didn't serve Harry another drink, but Hermione still tutted and turned to Ron, arms folded across her chest. "Why did you bring me out here?
“It wasn’t the glamorous upbringing of the Chosen One that most people imagine,” he said, practically spitting the words out. Harry’s eyebrows knitted together.
Once again, thank you all for sticking with me thus far, even with my absolutely dreadful posting schedule-- again, thank you for your patience hehe
Draco nodded. He’d been there before, that was for sure. But he’d also chosen himself over his friends before; he knew that most of the time, it wasn’t as simple as that. “Things are complicated for new couples,” he told Harry, setting down his quill. “Especially for those like Granger who have never truly dated before. I’m sure that Weasley is also having a completely different experience with Granger than he did with Lavender Brown.”
The endless bickering from the siblings and smothering from Molly hadn't been necessarily bothersome all summer, but it had been something Harry has had to deal with. (For slightly longer than he would have liked.) But Molly's motherly gaze and Ron and Ginny's snarky remarks were of the same value as classical music to Harry. Some people listened to Bach and Mozart while they went about their day; Harry listened to the youngest of the Weasleys' squabbling while under their mother's close eye. It was familiar, comforting. Not just in the way that it filled the air with noise, but in the way it reminded Harry that he wasn't alone. He's going to miss the busy and chaotic life that he had when he lived at the Burrow.
"Colluding." She didn't even look up from her breakfast, however, she was still pulling at her hair. "Machinating. Conspiring."
"Oh, sorry!" Harry began to say. "I wasn't looking where I was–"
Hermione chuckled. "I'm pretty sure there are no rules dedicated to where one can and cannot sit in the Great Hall."
The silence between the boys was anything but comfortable. Draco fidgeted with his sleeves; what was Potter waiting for? Why was he just sitting there, staring at the floor, looking like a dejected cruppy?
Draco crossed his arms, looking away from Potter's judging gaze. "I do believe I have some work to do, so, if you wouldn't mind..."
Ms. Pince told him it was essentially the most basic book for wards out there; the title seemed to be reminiscent of all of those Muggle books with "For Dummies" in their taglines. So instead of paying attention to the actual lesson the professor-turned-headmaster was trying to teach, Harry had the book hidden beneath the lip of his desk, chapter three ("What's With the Sparkly Blue Lights?") in front of him.
"Draco, I might be able to--"
Thanks for reading everyone xx
Because even though he wanted this win, more than anything, he didn’t need it. He’d had other wins in his life, some wrapped up in shiny, red ribbon, others more complex and not as clean-cut. From what he’d seen, Malfoy didn’t have many wins. And the way he was looking at the snitch, like it was a lifeline in a hopeless fugue… Harry wondered if it was really just a snitch to Draco.
The look Ron wore softened as his gaze fell onto a blushing Neville and a laughing pair of Slytherins. "Just like us."
"Now shake."
"Fine."
Harry looked to the Ravenclaw table where, sure enough, Draco was sitting, robes abandoned for a white button-up and trousers, chin resting on his hand, just like Harry's was moments ago. His eyes looked almost dreamy as he listened to Luna Lovegood speak, probably of magical creatures no one but her and her father could see. His hair was still slightly messy, face still white as a ghost. It made Harry want to slap him, for some reason.

This is a post-war story. There is going to be emotional trauma and moments of heavy depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Harry, Draco, and everyone in the story have gone through so much, and they are going to be in the midst of processing their trauma and losses in this story; that's just how the character development in this fic is.
Whispers followed Harry wherever he went. Like the wake of a boat, they rippled through the groups of students, conversations being snuffed in favour of discussing The Boy Who Lived Twice. Harry didn't get it; he just did what he had to. He didn't understand why people couldn't just let that be-- let
Draco hummed in response, continuing his cleaning. Potter fiddled with his wand in his hands. Draco was folding the blankets and putting them over the couch when Potter decided to help. He silently rearranged the poufs and cushions back to their original positions, not-so-subtly watching Draco out of the corner of his eye. Once the common room was back in order, Draco collapsed into the high back armchair in front of the hearth. He sighed, rubbing his temples.
Kreacher nodded, looking like he was about to be sick. "The Estate will disappear if Master Harry does nothing about the wards."
Hermione and Ron shared a look.
After a minute of struggling to get it anything but loosened, Harry sighed and left it on. In favour of doing absolutely anything, he rested his arms on his stomach and laid staring at the canopy above him. It looked quite soft, and the draping of the fabric reminded him of the banners he saw in the Ravenclaw common room during the restoration of Hogwarts over the summer. Remembering the five weeks he spent rebuilding the school with his friends caused a certain warmth to arise in him, one he hadn't felt in a long time. Him and Ginny and Ron and Hermione had spent hours, days on end together rebuilding their world brick by brick, mending the fallen walls and shattered windows of the castle with more magic than any of them have ever put into a project before. It was beautiful, in a way-- sad, but beautiful. The memories all melted together in Harry's head, and the distant shouts of Madonna lyrics and drunken laughter lulled Harry to sleep.
And if he was sure that he’d wake up from said slumber.
He scoffed, plucking a green bean from the serving dish in front of him and flinging it at Harry. "Shut up, Potter."
Harry woke up late the next morning, hangover hitting him like a freight train. His head was pounding and he nearly vomited upon sitting up. But when he finally managed to stay in an upright for more than three seconds, he caught a glimpse of a vial of clear liquid sitting on his nightstand, labeled with a kraft paper tag reading "Pick Me Up Potion (H. Granger)". Harry downed the potion like a shot, desperate for the frog in his throat to be relieved and his headache to be cured. The potion took only a few seconds before Harry could feel it start to kick in. First, the stomach ache was gone, then the headache, and finally the potion got rid of his horrid morning breath, leaving his mouth minty fresh. Harry sighed; although the effects of last night's drinking were gone, Harry still had no want to go to classes, or even breakfast for that matter. He sat at the edge of his bed, eyes cast on the ground until a pair of olive stockinged feet appeared before him. Harry looked up to find a one Neville Longbottom, smiling, cheery as ever, even at seven o'clock in the morning.
Harry’s bi-weekly meetings with the groundskeeper led to a lot of talk of the blond and the strange friendship he and Harry formed, so Hagrid was aware of the little arrangement they had planned. The large man smiled into the hug and gave a hearty laugh. “Aye, I’ll make sure’ta make extra Rock Cakes then!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So this is the house…” Draco mumbled. Standing in the doorway of Harry’s house. In his stocking feet. (Harry’s brain may have been short-circuiting for reasons totally unbeknownst to himself.) “I haven’t been here in years, but it still looks exactly the same.”
Harry's eyes snapped back down to his parchment. He'd ripped a decently-sized hole in the paper as he was writing. Lovely. He saw Hermione side-eye him and shake her head in his peripheral as he hurriedly cast a
He'd missed this— the feeling of magic in the air, youngins singing the school song to the wrong tune, the smell of cauldron polish wafting through the air– everything about going back to Hogwarts. The air was filled with steam from the train, and the chaos that ensued around him made Harry feel only a tiny bit claustrophobic.
Seamus shrugged with a sly grin, putting the roll back in the bag. "Just following orders, Potter. I'm sure Parkinson has something up her sleeve. Foxes like her always do."
"Yeah, but that's the thing," Harry pulled back the tapestry for Malfoy, "I know they never would want to."
Potter groaned and leaned back in his seat. “Strained? Awkward? I don’t know. It just…” He bit his lip and crossed his arms, pouting a little. Although they’ve talked about some rather personal things before, they’d all been things relative to the past; things that had happened before they’d formed this truce, before they spent their nights together in the common room. Talking about current matters in their lives... This was new territory. Draco could see the hesitance in Harry’s eyes, but almost as soon as he saw it, it disappeared and was replaced with a pitiful gloom. “It feels like my best friends have chosen each other over me.”
Harry cocked his head to the side. “Mr. Ollivander has a daughter?”
The bitter feelings ebbed and flowed over the next half hour, and by the time he’d unpacked, Harry felt a little better about it all. He emerged from his bedroom to find Malfoy walking down the stairs.
_____________________________________
"Potter, I--"
The trio shared a look, repressing chuckles. Harry spoke up first, deciding to forget about Malfoy and Neville and everything being turned on its head for the time being. "Sure, Seamus."
"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione jolted him back to reality. She was curled up on the common room floor now, poufs and pillows surrounding her in a pleasant arrangement of rich purple tones. That was the colour scheme for the eighth year dorms, where Harry and his class were staying for the year. They were given the opportunity to retake their seventh year of schooling since they were unable to sit their NEWTs. The students were all in their original houses, but since they were also technically in a school year that had never existed, the wizarding community resurrected up a new wing buried deep in the dungeons near the Slytherin dorms during the Hogwarts Restoration that took place over the summer. The eighth year commons had a completely different atmosphere when compared to Harry's beloved Gryffindor tower, but the more time he spent in it, the more it seemed to grow on him.
The other boy let out a small noise of confusion. “Why do you want my…”
EDIT: In case you are a reader who has been with me since the beginning of this fic (hi! I love you!!), you may notice that there is half of the chapters than originally published. This is no accident! I ended up combining chapters to make them a bit longer and to overall have a more cohesive reading experience. Nothing has changed plot-wise-- chapters one/two are now one chapter, three/four are now one chapter, so on and so forth. Thanks for bearing with me while I work out the oddities of writing :)
“Fang sends his warm regards, same fer Buckbeak,” his smile softened and large tears pooled in his eyes. He sniffled and rubbed his nose with a dirty handkerchief. “I hope ya all have a lo’ely Christmas. It’s jus… such a shame this’ll be yer last at Hogwarts.”
Draco snorted. "Well, whose do you think sounds more correct?"
Those are the nights Draco dreaded the most.
, Draco thought. "I'll let Hermione know. I'll owl you the plan sometime tomorrow."
"Fine!" Potter threw his arms up in the air as he made his way towards the dorms.
Hermione patted his arm gingerly and smiled, her own eyes misty. “We’ll always write to you, Hagrid.”
Oh, and also if he had a pen."
Draco nodded, not looking up from his work. “Any time.”
Within his peripheral, Harry saw a sudden blur of movement: a flash of green and silver and white blond to his left. Harry turned as fast as he could and leaned forward on his broom, gaining on Malfoy. They zigged and zagged through other players, dodging bludgers and broomsticks until Malfoy halted in his tracks. Harry's robes whipped around him as he sidled up to the other seeker, who seemed to have lost track of the snitch in the chase. Both sets of eyes darted from side to side, eagerly seeking out the golden gleam of the tiny orb.
And if you're new (hi!! glad you're here!!!), please note that chapters are split into two POVs; half of the chapter will be in Harry's POV (daytime) and half will be in Draco's POV (nighttime). That's all for now. Enjoy the fic!
Harry shrugged. "Some tracking potion they needed time to whip up, I don't know specifics. He just said to let him handle it," Harry stopped at the bottom of the stairs and waited for Malfoy to catch up. "But with the potion, you should be able to come and go as you please over break."
though, that was what was throwing Harry off. Luna was... well, Luna. Aloof. Kind. Eccentric. From what Harry had gathered of Malfoy last night (or this morning... time was weird), he was cold and analytical. A git, if Harry was being honest. But then Harry thought back to that brief encounter on Platform 9 3/4 where he seemed... Harry had no idea. Different. Kind of like Luna, now that he thought about it, the way his eyes had been clear and bright, and his expression had been so open, yet almost unfocused. Like there was so much he was trying not to show, and a little bit of everything was leaking out at once.
"Are you sure it can last till Christmas, Kreacher?" Potter looked stricken. Maybe he actually did care.
Draco folded his hands in his lap, cementing the idea that yes, he really was doing this, into his head. "I'll help you with the wards."
Hermione pulled an affronted look, and for a moment, Harry swore she was about to whip out her wand and do something she'd most certainly regret. Instead, she just narrowed her eyes at Parkinson and curled her lip as she said, "No. Thank you."
Potter looked up at him while he laid out his study materials. "You could say that."
"What is happening to this school?" He sipped heavily from his goblet.
"Hey, what's your--" When they locked eyes, Harry could finally place where he knew this guy from. "Oh, you're Nev's friend, right; the one from the Gardening Club? Terrance?"
Draco surprisingly didn’t have to carry Potter out of a burning building that evening, nor did they even have to call for takeout. Turns out, Potter was quite the cook (which confused Draco as to why he had such difficulty making potions, but that was beside the point). The whole process of making the meal— Coq Au Vin, at the chef’s suggestion— went quite smoothly. Draco sat at the counter, arms folded over his chest, making small talk and admiring the queer domesticity of the chopping of vegetables and frying of bacon in Potter’s little kitchen. Harry also looked quite fit as head chef, the definition of “homemaker” in his canvas apron, and the thought made Draco’s neck redden.
"'Kay, well, I'll be on the dance floor." He waggled his eyebrows, swaying as he stood. "See ya, Parkinson."
Draco Malfoy was used to being ignored.
They both let the conversation drop for a moment. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, hating himself for what he was about to say. Should he? If he didn't, the house would die, but, if he did, that'd mean...
"Act'lly, I'll take a shotta Gigglewater."
Draco chuckled. Harry shook his head and laughed along, the weight from the room dissipating with it.
But here he was, doing just that, alone at two thirty in the morning.
"That's stealing," Potter said, brow furrowed.
"Um..." Draco shuffled through the dozen pieces of parchment in his lap. "It was something about ravens... Ah, here it is: 'The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.' Quoted William Shakespeare, I believe."
It was then that Draco realised just how little he knew about Harry’s childhood, or even what awaited him when school let out for summer holiday every year. “Oh? Who taught you how?”
Harry quickly shut the book and looked at his professor, slightly cowering under her intense glare. Although Minerva McGonagall was well into middle age, her severity was at its peak. Her left brow was raised so high it disappeared beneath her wide-brimmed hat. "Yes, Professor?"
"Wait," Harry stopped before the stairs, knowing they were about to switch their path to one that would lead to the kitchens instead of the dungeons. He began to make his way to the hidden staircase to his left, as the moving staircases wouldn't change position for another ten minutes. "Did you not speak to Kingsley?"
NOW! Onto the new fic. It's not a ship fic. I do dabble a little in the DNF/Karlnap side of the community, but I'm not sure if I'll be posting any of that content here. This fic, however, is a Gen fic and is canon-divergent, starting from the day Tommy leaves Logsteadshire and begins to make his way to Techno's house in the arctic. The fic will be seven chapters, one prologue and six letters that Tommy has written in his head. Here's the premise:
Draco smirked a little. "Nothing, really. I just figured I'd save you from that pitiful attempt at socialisation."
Harry laughed, but stopped when he felt a pair of eyes on him from behind. Turning around, he caught Draco Malfoy looking back towards Luna Lovegood, saying something to make her smile distantly. Harry turned back around. Strange it was, the Slytherin King making friends with Luna. Although, if Harry remembered correctly, they were distant cousins or something along the lines of that. They were so
He halted on his broom. His eyes danced around the arena, desperately searching for the snitch until he finally caught sight of the other seeker. Malfoy had lost sight of it too, and was now cruising along the perimeter of the pitch. It was fine, everything was fine. As long as Malfoy didn't have the snitch, the odds were still in Harry's favour. He was the better seeker, after all, and he knew that he could beat Malfoy. So long as he got to the snitch before him, everything would work out and Malfoy would be stuck doing his Runes work for the next week; he just needed to stay focused.
Ron threw a crumpled up piece of parchment at him. "You lucky bastard, indeed."
Potter rolled his eyes. "You can be snarky to me one second and polite to him the next..."
Draco shook his head, glancing away from sculpted abs and chiseled jawline. "Positive."
P.S. We hit 420 hits while this chapter was in the works... nice. Next milestone is 690. We can do this, everyone.
She scoffed and reopened her book. "Hera, no. You couldn't pay me to go in a dark, smelly room with a bunch of drunk and horny teenagers. That's just a recipe for disaster."
"Goodmorning, Malfoy."
"G'morning, Harry. How are you feeling?"
“I don’t really know where to start.”
Harry nodded, a faux smile overcoming his features. "Yeah, makes sense."
"Er..." Potter began, eloquently. "Me?"
He might have done what was right, but in the end, it was for the wrong reasons.
"Master must lay down his own." When Potter stares at him blankly over his cup, Kreacher shoots him a look. "Master Harry does not know this?"
Harry's head was resting on his hand. He kept feeling like someone was watching him, but who, he couldn't figure out. Every time he looked behind him, all of the other students were doing what they should be: laughing, eating, studying. Harry still couldn't help but turn about and stare at Neville from time to time, his red robes clashing horribly amongst the dark green of the Slytherins. "You'd think he was one of them," he says to Ron and Hermione, turning away from the laughing threesome across the dining hall.
His eyes glazed over green-and-silver and red-and-gold cladded flyers, paying close attention to the bludgers that were being whacked through the air. Demelza Robins nearly took one to the shoulder, but steered herself out of the way at the last second. Harry knew that the snitch wouldn't be spotted for a little while (it liked to do a lap around the castle before making its first appearance in the stadium), so he focused his attention on avoiding bludgers and keeping track of Malfoy's position. He seemed to stay on the Slytherin's half of the pitch, occupying the space just above the goals. Harry watched him for a moment, the way his robes whipped behind him, like a flag dancing prideful in the breeze. There didn't seem to be any strategy to his position at the moment, so Harry turned his attention back to the other players.
