"Too right you are, Padfoot!" James bounded up to them, straightening his bookbag and sending Lily a winning smile. "Timing is crucial to a good joke. What are we talking about?"
"Yeah," said Harry, moving away from the Marauders. "You'll— uh— have to remind me what thirds do. We never really got that far at— at our school. And I don't know etiquette like you purebloods…."
…" continued Malfoy quickly, visibly frazzled. "Well— I missed a lot of that season, actually. But I do recall laughing when I heard you'd gotten a cracked skull by your own Keeper who had stolen a Beater's bat in the middle of the game.
The Hufflepuffs cried in outrage, jumping out of their seats and trying to shield themselves, but Peter and Sirius were insistent.
As he imagined each scenario for a second, one in particular made his dick twitch.  So, smirking, he moved behind the smaller boy and pressed him forwards and upwards, Harry stumbled for a moment before leaning on the wall to support himself. He went to turn around to ask what Draco was doing when he stiffened as pale arms wrapped around his waist, and hips pressed tightly to his arse, the familiar feel of erection telling him exactly what Draco was doing.
“Oh, hey ‘Mione. I just had the weirdest dream where you told me Draco was in love with me and knew about our son.”
“It that all? Harry! That is totally okay. You know, Charlie’s gay too! Did you think we would be upset over it?”
He could tell the blond was getting ready to release, and prepared by relaxing his throat and moving his head forwards into the thrust. The cock slipped deeper down his throat until he was chocking and his nose was nestled into a patch of blond curls. Startled by the sudden deep throat, Draco released a strangled cry and came, shots of cum running down into Harry’s stomach. As his climax finished, he slowly withdrew, making sure the brunette wasn’t injured.
Harry smirked coyly and took another step closer, matching each pace Draco took back until they were both pressed against the wall. He learned in to whisper. “So you don’t want me? You don’t want me to spread my legs for you? To take your dick up my arse? To cum inside me?”
“Priceless one? Oh Harry, that’s beautiful. Perfect for him. You’ll tell us the father eventually though, right?”
As he neared release, he moved his hand to wrap around the smaller’s abdomen and chest, seemingly in an attempt to fuck Harry into the wall. Harry was scratching at the stone in excitement from stimulation, only gasps and moans falling from his mouth. He could feel that glorious cock sliding inside his walls and then out. He pressed back just as Draco made his hardest thrust and climaxed, shooting streams of spunk deep into his body. He could feel each spurt splash against his walls. He could feel the cock pulsing inside he chamber. He could feel those balls pressed snugly against him. He could feel the hand tugging at his own erection where it had left a trail of white down the stone. The sensations sailed into one big wave that crashed down and he seized, clamping down on the spurting organ while his own painted the wall.
Draco moved the hand on Harry’s hip to grip the weeping erection, holding it tightly to prevent Harry from cumming (though he didn’t know that Snape had been training Harry rather well for some time). He also wanted the most sensitive organ to get the rough treatment too. He held the underside, pressing the other half against the stone, pulling a short scream from Harry at the sudden coldness and new stimulation. Every thrust pressed him harder against the wall and deeper into bliss.
Harry shoe his head, dismissing the elf, and turned his attention to Draco. “Would you like to stay the night?” He asked.
Three weeks of throwing up later, and Harry went to see Poppy Pomfrey, who had to explain to him how this could happen.
Molly gasped and had a hand over her mouth, tears gathered in her eyes. Arthur simply stared, stunned, until a smile broke out.
“Don’t you ‘hi’ me young man. Missing with no visual contact for over a year and you suddenly show up, not just with a bad, but
The second time he awoke, he was given a list of the instructions; potions he had to take, food he had to avoid, that kind of stuff. Harry was already not particularly looking forward to this.
Draco laced his slender fingers though Harry’s hair, the contrast and meaning behind it making his dick twitch in anticipation. He moved Harry forward so his head was there, and mouth opened reflexively. Draco held back an inappropriate laugh and eagerly pressed the tip of his erection to the hole in front of it. He pressed the tip inside, taking the image in and he pressed in deeper, feeling the back of Harry’s throat. Harry’s lips closed around the invasion tightly, tongue rolling around the organ and letting Draco fuck him.
It worked for a while too. Until he accidentally got involved with someone who wasn’t quite a muggle.
He also had regular check up-s with Poppy, who was the only person he felt comfortable with knowing about his situation. She was also the only one who knew where he was staying, and she always had to come to him, and would have to perform the home-birth too.
Immediately everyone demanded to hold the baby, and Hermione was signalling his to talk over in the corner. He resigned himself to a thorough interrogation, before passing Anton over to Molly. Hey, Grandmother gets the first hold. Then grandfather, then the rest can fight over holding him. Harry slunk off unnoticed by the Weasleys over to Hermione who threw up a privacy charm.
The image was so tempting he had no choice but to enjoy the virility of being a teenager, taking his waking dick in his hand and tugging it to full hardness. As the blond recalled how good the past who-knows-how-long was, and then taking in the image of debauchery that was Harry, it wasn’t long before he was spraying semen again, and this time not into Harry, but onto. Where Harry’s seed was spread on one side of his body, the other was now painted by Draco’s seed.
And fuck him he did. Hands kept Harry in place as he withdrew and slammed forwards again. Harry closed his eyes and focused on breathing through his nose as his throat was attacked. Drool escaped around the corners of his mouth, dribbling onto the floor, and Draco did not let up. Harry pressed his tongue to the base of the sex organ, hollowing his cheeks and sucking whenever Draco withdrew.
Draco then used his other hand to grip Harry’s face and turn it towards him to catch the plump lips in a dirty kiss. Their panted breaths mingling the few seconds their lips weren’t attached. Draco could taste traces of himself still on that tongue and it egged him to go harder and faster still.
Harry’s breathing and heart rate was increasing. Then he passed out. “Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. She cast
Three months old, and Poppy popped in to check in to see how little Anton was going, and give him his vaccinations for both muggle and wizard diseases, per Harry’s request.
Draco’s eyes latched on to Potter, adjusting his position often. He also noticed that Blaise’s eyes kept trailing to the Gryffindor. Draco’s eyebrows raised at the implications of his observation. Assuming this was supposed to be a secret he leant forward to whisper to his friend.
“Master Draco.” The house-elf greeted. “Is there anything Kreature be getting for his three masters?”
“Because if you had you would have seen the huge scandal where Malfoy publicly rejected his fiancee, broke off their engagement, in public, and stated he was in love with someone else of the different sex.”
Draco agreed and they got ready for, and into bed. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s middle and breathed in his scent.
Now 20 weeks in, Harry had moved permanently into his new house. He had called the grouchy house elf the day before, and he was just as grumpy and resentful and he had always been. Until he noticed the second magic generating in the family. He was the Black family elf, and the heir was growing. With the knowledge of a coming child, and hat the father was pureblood, the elf became a different being overnight. He was no longer as grumpy. Didn’t insult Harry, (though he still want partial to the ‘blood traitors’ and ‘mudbloods’, but Harry was grateful to the improvement. It would make the next who-knows-how-long much more enjoyable.
Besides, wasn't Hermione trying to sail the 'Harry and Draco forever' ship off to sea? So what was with this
Draco smiled at the scene before him; the beautiful tiled floor in various hues of brown shone warmly from the rays of the rising sun, which flitted through the windows overhead. His fingers idly traced the intricacies of the wooden panelling beside the door, and the smile stretched his face further. The sheer joyous appearance of this place always seems to brighten his mood for a while.
"I'm saying nothing, but just so you know Mr November has a very fine arse, actually he's quite similar to Drac-"
he thought, as he idly listened to the sound of his breathing, and his heels slapping the steps, echo from the bare walls.
"Gods, it's always déjà vu with you, isn't it, Potter?" he groaned, collapsing onto the bed like a drowning man. "I forgive you, and what's more, I thank you," mulishly, he continued before the Potter could interrupt. "I thank you, because you gave me purpose, no longer was I going to sit back and let Him win the war."
Another blow to his ego was presented with each word uttered by Mr McAvoy, the most prestigious prosecution wizard the Ministry had under their employ. The blonde's wrists were bound (by ridiculously maniacal chains), to the armrests of the most mould-infested chair he had ever come across. His breeding was practically shuddering at the thought of who exactly had sat on this chair previously, and how the actual piece of rigid furniture had attained some of its stains.
"Of course, Mother; that makes a lot of sense," the blonde absently murmured, "Longbottom produces the best flowers, I do not know how he will feel selling them to me but only the best can do for Hermione."
Draco smiled, and inclined his head in agreement, and then continued. "I couldn't let them get you."
If he was being honest with himself, it was that comment from yesterday that was the real reason why his favourite shirt was torn to shreds. And the reason his room was trashed beyond recognition, not because Crookshanks had decided to make Harry's house his new cat-scratcher.
Harry couldn't help the blush which did in fact turn his face red this time. "I – Her – Hermione, that doesn't mean anything, I've grown up since then. I've moved on."
"They'll accuse him despite that though, and he shouldn't have to go through anything terrible ever again, not after Lucius."
"It's about me and Ginny,," he finally admitted, after fiddling with the edges of a crumbling custard-cream biscuit, and Molly felt something drop in her chest. 'Oh Merlin, what has she done now?' she moaned, settling a comforting hand on Harry's and soft enquiring eyes on his own saddened yet determined ones.
and gave the man a sultry smile. Satisfaction and hope swimming through him as the healer fidgeted on the spot.
"I would love to," he answered, rubbing his face with his palms. "But I really should tell Ron and Hermione the news, before the papers get wind of it. Merlin, that would go down so well."
"Fiddlesticks!" Molly admonished sternly; wrapping the small man in another rough embrace. "You've been my son for years, and I'm sorry that you felt the need to marry Ginerva to know that yourself."
"You might want to sit down," he told them seriously and was glad that they complied with little protestation. "I have divorced Ginerva," he said, watching Arthur's smile slip off his face, Hermione's face to blank, and Ron's to grow red.
"Yes, he was terribly rude," Draco agreed, smiling charmingly at him, but Harry's eyes were fixated on Draco's wounds, not his face. His expression was furious, and his eyes were dark with anger, as his left hand turned white against a jar of…dittany?
"Oh fine." the bustling witch acquiesced, and if Harry didn't know better he would say she was pouting. "But you better come here every day for your meals after tonight."
"Don't be silly, Harry!" Hermione retorted with a fond smile of exasperation, "There's no way the jury will find them guilty with the defence you have planned. You forget that I've heard you practising your speeches."
"Try listening to that when someone fucks your wife," Harry dryly returned, which Edward took as a sign to leave. 'Wise man.'
Catriona all but cackled uproariously, and Hermione giggled whilst nervously casting a glance at Narcissa. The blonde witch raised an imperious eyebrow at the muggle-born witch. "I should be furious at you for injuring my son," she said softly, "but I somehow think he won't mind Potter kissing it better." She grinned wickedly at the women.
"Many people, Mr McAvoy. There was Fenrir Greyback, Bellatrix Lestrange, Thorfinn Rowle, Corban Yaxley, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Car-" Harry began to list but was cut off by McAvoy.
the man thought incredulously, yet his Mother continued to plough on. "And my favourite quote has to be the one about Potter shouting about his peni -"
"Yeah but it's 'Mione," Ron said, after swallowing his previous mouthful; and Harry could swear that Hermione was muttering about the emotional ranges of teaspoons, and idiotic husbands.
The sound of Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister of Magic snorting in amusement roused Draco from his thoughts, and with more perception, he saw the wink the man sent the teenager. "Please get back on topic Mr Potter otherwise you will be found to be in contempt of the court." Harry waved his hand at McAvoy in a gesture to continue, barely hiding the smirk which flitted across his face.
"Harry m'boy, I didn't know you were coming today!" Arthur jovially greeted, moving to kiss his wife on the cheek. "I just passed Ron and Hermione in the hallway, they seem really happy about something, do you know what it is?" he directed at the other two, who shook their heads in return. "Oh well, we'll find out soon." He quickly settled himself at the table, beaming at Harry before opening the Quibbler which was resting upon the table.
"Children who had no choice but to fight for Voldemort, children who were forced by their parents to become cold-blooded killers. And that is what I am ashamed of, ashamed that children had to fight your war," The Potter concluded, frigid emerald eyes sweeping across the courtroom before softening slightly upon the sight of Draco.
Draco felt the blush redden his cheeks as he watched how he had pathetically held onto a man who was way out of his league, Merlin, he wasn't even in the park to begin with (despite what his Mother insinuated). He couldn't even reprimand himself for his previous self's actions, as they were that embarrassing; it was true that he never wanted to relive his trial because of how he thought it would end, but he also vowed never to remember the shameless way he behaved, as it was merely too mortifying.
"I was atop the Astronomy Tower, stupefied under my Invisibility Cloak," was the strained reply, and Draco could see the Potter forcibly swallow.
And Harry's thoughts trailed off, as a chaste kiss was pressed to the corner of his mouth. Bewildered, he glanced up at Draco's shaky smile. "D…Does that mean you accept my feelings?"
"We already established, merely five hours ago, that Severus Snape has been exonerated of all crimes. I mean, I will gladly present all of the evidence once more if it will satisfy you, but in case you need reminding – any and I mean any malicious comment against Severus Snape is an insult against myself. That applies to the papers as well, Rita darling," he called to the vicious blonde viper in the gallery, "because that my dear is called slander which I'm sure you are already well acquainted with," Harry's voice was saccharine sweet.
"W-why would you think that 'Mione's pregnant?" he stuttered out, with the woman in question nodding along slowly.
The dawning sun peeped over the horizon where towering, green treetops dominated the golden hues of the skyline. Wispy, white, clouds floated nonchalantly high above. Delighted thrushes and skylarks crooned delightfully to one another, and the sweet smell of the flowers in the window box truly heightened the beauty of the morning.
"Well then it's a good thing that they're both coming around for breakfast then isn't it? They should be here in a couple of minutes, so could you set the table dear?" she asked, posing an intimidating figure with a skillet in one hand and wand in the other.
"And I suppose someone who ignored me for seven years, hated me, and remained virginal is the person for me?" Harry's voice attempted neutrality but was failing horribly as curiosity and hope fuelled it.
Draco shook those thoughts away, he shouldn't bother worrying about these things whilst visiting his mother.
Their arms were linked, heads bent close together whilst they whispered lowly, and even though the sight was common from the affectionate friendship they both shared, the blonde had to swallow his jealousy at seeing them together. He heard the gibberish being spouted from their mouths and knew that one of them
And Merlin, did he look so beautiful but oh so tired. His blonde hair falling around his face like a halo, as he stared at his dragonhide boots. "Jesus Christ, Draco…" he murmured, closing the distance between the two of them and pulling him into his chest.
Fixing the patented Malfoy glare on the witch who claimed to be his friend didn't seem to be that effective, since she only smiled sweetly and fled so that she could snigger on the other side of the flimsy, pale-blue, curtain.
Hermione glanced wryly at him. "You do realise that you're always talking about him. Sometimes it seems as if he is the only thing you care about!"
"He was pardoned of his crimes," she frigidly told the wizard, "Which you should know about since you were the one who fought tooth and nail to set him free, and do I even need to remind you what a mess you were during that time?"
"Sorry," he mumbled out, "but I just wanted to be part of your family ever since I was a child, and I just thought that marrying Ginny would help me firmly become a fixture here."
However, the passionate fervour that Ginny always seemed capable of inciting in others quickly faded from their relationship. They had, of course, consummated their marriage on their wedding night, and on many other occasions as well, but Harry's actions were rarely guided by an overwhelming desire for Ginny.
Clearing his throat, Harry removed his hands from Draco's body. "Right, Mr Malfoy," and Harry's voice was brisk and professional. "We're all done now, you're free to go." He attempted a reassuring grin, but it was just false. "Should you feel any pain, please come back to St Mungo's. Good day."
Hermione smiled wryly and took a small sip of the pumpkin juice she had been craving. "Well, it was the perfect opportunity, and they were driving me up the wall," she admitted unrepentantly.
Groaning, the world came back into focus as he placed his glasses back on. The sickening blue tiles mixing with the immaculate white paint to form one nauseating picture before his eyes. The sound of the door opening, had his wide
"But what else is there?" Hermione asked, squeezing his hand gently as he worried his bottom lip between his teeth.
"Why did you split with Ginny?" Hermione questioned softly, grasping Harry's hand in her own, much like how Molly did earlier.
Harry turned to ask Hermione what exactly she meant with her last comment, but she wasn't there any longer.
Draco nodded into his pillow. "Exactly, you need someone who compliments you. Someone who isn't afraid to argue with you. Someone who would never betray you and your vows."
It was obvious now to Harry, that with a spirit as fiery and passionate as hers, his dispassionate attentions were insufficient.
Blushing furiously, Draco manage a scandalised 'Mother!' to burst from his lips, yet still, his eyes sought the said quote whilst his mind imagined. Imagined how exactly Harry Potter's second wand looked, how it would feel in his hand - "I am not even going to entertain that idea Mother. That gossip rag hardly ever publishes the truth. Even if they are getting divorced, I highly doubt the veracity of the claims in the Prophet" he stated coldly, before standing to his feet. "It's been lovely to see you again, but I really must go, Hermione has given me a task to do – Merlin knows why." the blonde pressed a kiss to his Mother's smiling face, frowning as he heard her murmur something strange about 'The Plan'.
Harry Potter...a haggard Harry Potter. His untameable onyx hair appeared to have gained its own sentience as it was tangled everywhere, whilst his emerald eyes were dull and tired, surrounded by the backdrop of vicious-looking, purple bags.
"Mrs Weasley knows that you would not have known about her news, so I do not know why you are worrying so. I expect she was in quite a rush to switch shifts, as she herself told me that she was running late, so she most likely never had the time to tell you; however this does not mean you are to do nothing," the blonde woman instructed; her eyes never leaving her son's, despite the task she had at hand. "As the Lord to the Malfoy name...No, as her friend, the next time you see her, you shall have a bouquet of the finest flowers, your warmest regards, and this present from myself," Narcissa told her son, indicating towards the blanket that she held in her hands.
"What about men? If Ginny is the only woman you could ever love then is Malfoy the only man you could ever love?"
"You'll be having a winter baby?" Harry enquired, after pulling her into a tight hug. "Because that is really cute, y'know... What?" he demanded when both Molly and Hermione laughed at him. "Oh don't you say how obvious it was that I'm not straight." he whined good-naturedly "I'm just excited about my best-friend having a sprog, okay? Totally natural," he declared, smiling at Hermione who was clasping her husband's hand even though he was shovelling food into his mouth with the other.
"Yes," came the smooth reply, and he couldn't help but watch with fascination as the blonde's adam's apple bobbed. "We need to talk."
Harry floundered for words. "I wouldn't have laughed," Draco's eyes met his and the sincerity was shining in his eyes. "I would have been confused, but then I would have been over the moon. All I ever wanted was his attention…"
"I…" Harry paused whilst dearly wishing he hadn't smoked his last cigarette. "I was fooling myself, Gin. I thought I loved you like a husband should love his wife, but I was wrong. You're my dearest friend but I don't think I was ever in love with you and I realised it too late. And you were trapped in our marriage but I couldn't bring myself to break our oaths for fear of hurting you, but now looking at you now, I know I should have ended this sooner if only to spare you the heartache."
Then, as if that wasn't enough, once they arrived at Mungo's, it was Blaise's older sister who had looked him over with the brisk words of
Draco smiled softly as he saw a tear roll down his memory's cheek; he remembered how it felt knowing that his Godfather and pseudo-father would be recognised after death, not as a Death Eater but as a hero. Relief, happiness, sadness.
"Mr Potter if we could perhaps start the questioning," the nasal tones of McAvoy caused both the past and future Draco's to grit their teeth, and upon closer inspection, it seemed as if Harry did also.
Oh, it wasn't this way in the beginning. In those first few months, he dedicated their intimate moments to discovering new ways to pleasure and satisfy her. However, after the honeymoon period was over, Harry realised - too late - that he did not love her in the way she deserved. It quickly became apparent to him that his love for her was more familial than spousal; and with this realisation, his lovemaking became mechanical and distant. He stopped instigating their intimate moments and would only touch her sexually if she requested it and sometimes not even then.
Suddenly, Harry's arms were full of manila folders, and he watched with an exasperated look as his boss effectively parted the crowds on her
Sighing heavily, he lit another cigarette. He knew that he only had himself to blame. If he wanted a happy marriage then he should never have married Ginny. He always believed that he married her because of his love for her and her family. However, looking back now, he realised that it was also because marriage to Ginny was convenient. At the time, he deeply cared for Ginny; he admired her spunk and was truly proud of the woman she had become, so it was so, so easy to convince himself that he was in love. That his feelings for Ginny were enough for marriage. And, if Harry was being truly accountable, proposing to Ginny after the Battle was over and the dead buried, saved him from being hounded by the hordes of women desperate to be the wife of the 'Saviour'.
That tinkling laugh (which only sounded when the crafty witch was planning something) sounded throughout the room, and a rather deep
"Do shut the curtain, Har… Healer Potter, it is terribly draughty, and you wouldn't want me to catch a chill, would you?" he asked loftily,
"Don't say that, Mione," Harry whined, his breathing harsh. "Draco Malfoy does not deserve to be in Azkaban!"
"Good, because that would have been awkward," the red-haired youth mumbled, before glaring at his wife. "How long have you known?" he demanded of her.
"And why did he do that?" McAvoy asked as he began pacing in front of Harry whilst sneering at the chained form of Draco.
Harry stared dumbfoundedly at the bushy-haired witch. His mouth agape and emerald eyes wide with shock. Draco thought he looked adorable.
So, for the final time that day, the blonde stuck his head back into the pensieve, holding his breath through the suffocating travel, before landing with disorientation upon hard, worn floorboards in a house with no straight edges – anywhere. His breeding urged him to sneer at the sight around him, as he soon realised the floor was the floor to a house, a home. However, Draco just couldn't bring himself to criticise the building, as its mere appearance proved there were such things as sentimental value.
"You can live your life the way you want to, Harry! Ignore the papers, ignore your fans, ignore everyone else. You are the one who is preventing your own happiness, not society. Stop blaming everyone else and get your head out of your butt!"
Draco watched as his memory-self's breath began to shorten as the verdict came in, he remembered that back then all he could see was his Mother's face as he believed it would be the last time he saw her. His memory-self never saw the anxiety spread across Harry's face as the sentence was passed, or see Harry's worried gaze settling on his dishevelled form – but now Draco did.'Ten years working in the Department of Magical Creatures – such a shame they didn't realise that I actually like animals.'
"I said that is enough," she repeated in clipped tones, casting a frosty glare at her husband and son.
"No wonder Ron was worried about Draco if you've mentioned him to Ron as much as you have me," the wizard idly added, smirking slightly at the stunned expression on his best friend's face, before growing worried at the gleam growing in her eyes.
Hiding his mischievous grin in the pillow, Draco flinched as cold fingers delicately felt the wound. "Sorry," the word almost too quiet for him to hear, and the almost inaudible chanting of 'vulnera sanetur' sounded beautiful coming from Harry's lips.
"Yes." Draco turned so that Harry could see the truth in his eyes. "I do." And he smiled grimly as he saw those gorgeous green eyes widen and that devilish hand escape into that sinfully mussed hair.
"Gods, Potter, do you secretly want to be a masseuse?" the blonde groaned "Stop it, Potter…Gods, just how do you do that?"
"Why'd you do that to her!" the youngest male Weasley demanded furiously, "How's she gonna live? I'm guessing she hasn't got anywhere to live any more. How could you!" he shouted whilst roughly kicking his chair aside.
"Can a mother not be happy to see her only son?" she questioned before a delighted laugh escaped her throat. "No, but you are correct; I went to Diagon last morning and came across the most delightful news," she exclaimed and her child could not help but to become intrigued; after all, little to nothing could excite his mother so. "Tell me, have you seen Mrs Weasley nee Granger recently?" she asked; her blue eyes danced merrily.
"Right now, Mr-" the deep voice that had been haunting his dreams since he was sixteen called into the room.
His eyes must have portrayed his pain, for Hermione merely smiled at the wizard, which offered little comfort for the man. "But you admit that you do have feelings for him?" she asked, and Harry inwardly groaned. "Of course you do, my instincts on these things are rarely wrong. You can be happy Harry, just stop being a coward," she told him, dusting some cat-fur from her beige-robes whilst she did so, and Harry was quite sure that he heard her quietly mutter something under her breath.
Harry grinned to himself, knowing that whatever life threw at them in the future he and Ginny would be fine.
The blonde in question felt as if his breath had been stolen from him, and his heart suspended by those five words issued from Harry's sinful mouth.
"Please leave me alone, 'Mione," Harry pleaded softly, taking another desperate swig. "The trial is on Monday, and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm psyching myself out and I can't let myself fuck it up. Too much is riding on it."
"You're wrong actually," Hermione informed him, eyes sparkling so reminiscent of the late Albus Dumbledore's that Harry actually had to blink a couple of times in shock. "Draco isn't blinded by his childhood prejudices any longer, he treats everyone equally regardless of their status and magical ability."
Since she was used to the early mornings, she was busily frying bacon, knitting a summer cardigan, and cleaning the surfaces when her son-in-law Harry Potter entered the kitchen. Visits weren't unheard of in the Burrow, but it was still unexpected to find the man she had called a son for the past twelve years standing awkwardly in the doorway.
Dawning realisation. "The snatchers, you lied to them. You said that you didn't recognise us when I know you did - I saw it in your eyes," the words were steadfast and sure.
Draco felt the feeling of goosebumps intensify until a pleasurable tingle was settling in his bones. He remembered those arms, and the soft reassurances whispered into his ears. That he would be okay, that he was safe, that he would never, ever go to Azkaban so long as he would live, that he deserved to be happy, to live a life, to gain a lover. The world was his and no-one could stop him from living his life. Draco watched intently as his memory-self clung to Harry's form, before visibly struggling to gain composure; he saw the caring smile directed at him from the most breathtaking teenager to live. And he saw how his mother finally escaped the thralls of the gaping audience to wrap her arms around his former self, and smiled a watery smile at the onyx-haired teen, who in return smiled awkwardly at her, ruffled a hand through his hair and left.
the Malfoy thought to himself, quickly glancing around the empty kitchen for the meddling Muggleborn witch, who was Hermione Weasley. A flash of infamous wild curled brown hair came from his left, and the blonde saw the woman
Gods, it was enough to drive any sane man off the edge. This was absolutely not down to the inordinate amount of jealousy he felt at not being the one to spend so much time with Draco Malfoy.
Ginny's face contorted into a moue of confusion. "Harry," she began cautiously, "Are you talking about a divorce? I know they have them in the Muggle world but they aren't allowed here."
When the sound of lazy kisses, and mumbled words met his ears, Harry violently crushed the stub of his cigarette and flicked the abused dog-end to the street below.
"He didn't want me to stop Severus Snape killing him," came the simple reply, and Draco could clearly see the worried frown sent to his memory-self as he said it. Draco watched fascinated as Harry Potter's frown only deepened further, with every comment about the integrity of one Severs Snape. "Ladies, Gentlemen, Minister," Harry greeted with barely concealed hatred, causing memory-Draco's eyes to widen in confusion.
And before Draco could even fully comprehend what she had said, she hurried from the room, leaving him once again on the floor of his apartment. "Just what the fucking hell is wrong with her!" he screamed into his silent home. "None of this makes any sense, just why is she doing this?"
"Because I saw your face. It wasn't the face of a cold-blooded killer, it was the face of a confused boy, and it was the betrayal in your eyes that told me you didn't intend to kill me. You were just going to stupefy me and send me to Dumbledore, weren't you?"
"Oh yeah." he choked out, flushing red at his wife's words. "This looks amazing mum!" he declared at the hearty full-English breakfast which Molly had just placed in front of him, and immediately dug into it with vigour. Harry met Hermione's amused eyes from above the red-head and simultaneously rolled them with matching grins.
"You really are thick, aren't you, Potter?" the blonde laughed, before kissing him much more firmly. Teeth nibbled upon his lower lip, and Harry immediately let Draco's inquisitive tongue into his mouth. Gods, the feel of those pale fingers tugging at his hair, whilst Draco's firm length pressed into his stomach was pure bliss. "But that's okay. You're my idiot now."
He pressed a kiss to her fiery hair, knowing now that she wouldn't mistake it for anything other than comfort. Ginny raised her face to meet Harry's. "But what went wrong? We were so happy at the beginning"
"What is with your questions Mr McAvoy, they are hardly specific are they? How am I supposed to know what is going on in another person's head, short of Legilimency ? Which I did not perform. However, Mr Malfoy's task was to kill Albus Dumbledore-"
"Draco," his mother's soft voice called and the man in question smiled widely at her. "It is such a delight to see you again," she continued, and Draco only shook his head gently at the woman's words.
"Y-You don't fancy me do you, mate?" he asked in genuine fear, causing his friend to let out a loud bout of laughter.
With a forlorn glance, Harry Potter stubbed the butt of his cigarette out on the stone window ledge. Blowing the remnants of the smoke from his mouth, he smoothed his Healer's uniform so that no wrinkles remained from his pathetic slump against the south wall of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.
"I tried to give them as little information as possible. It wasn't much help since He had other sources, but I tried. And the Room of Requirement," the blonde abandoned all pretenses of stoicism, as his vision blurred.
Once again, Harry's voice was cut off by McAvoy's triumphant exclamation and the whisperings of the entire court. Frustrated
A bitter laugh escaped Harry, and that band around Draco's heart only tightened further. "You don't mean that…"
"The Plan, and yes I do," Hermione corrected, before glancing at the Muggle wrist-watch she adamantly refused to remove. "I'm sorry, I must leave, I'm late for work, but I'll owl you the details later," she called in reply, before hurriedly running in the opposite direction.
"I'll be fine Harry, go on and read your guilty pleasure," she said, laughing at the shocked 'horrified' look on his face. "Honestly, I don't like to toot my own horn here, but I'm the smartest witch of my age, and you are an open book."
"It is such good news, is it not Draco?" the witch declared; her son attempted to level an admonishing glare at her but couldn't summon enough genuine feeling to do so. "I love the quotes in there, Brown says that a passing wizard heard shouting through the open window. Apparently, Potter and the girl have apparently never been intimate together; why do you think that is? She isn't exactly hard on the eyes, so I can only presume that it was something he did not want."
"And when I saw you in my manor, that stupid hex obscuring that beautiful face of yours, it felt as if my heart exploded. I couldn't let Him have you, all of my actions were to save you, I couldn't let you die! You must know that I never fought for Him… I wouldn't…not for Him."
The blonde murmured something strangely akin to 'Potter, you idiot' before his shining blue eyes met his. "Of course you're good enough," he answered, whilst shaking his head fondly.
"Only you, Ron," he managed to say between his fading laughter. "Oh, promise to never change. No, I don't fancy you."
Molly's hand flew to her mouth. "A divorce!" Her voice was scandalised and loud. "But your marriage contract…" she faltered as her eyes widened in horror. "Arthur told me the terms of your contract...only adultery could cause a divorce."
The brown-haired witch was, to put it mildly, in the middle of a disaster zone. Tousled clothes were everywhere the eye could see; a pair of crumpled cream, pyjama-bottoms on the bed, a pair of grey socks hooked over the post on the iron headboard, an unmistakable red jumper flung haphazardly across the floor.
"Because you're Muggleborn," he supplied knowingly, an annoyed frown marring his face whilst he did so.
"It's just slightly...crispy," she eventually said, after assessing the damage. "And if we scrape off the slightly darker bits then no-one will be able to tell the difference. Are you staying for breakfast?" she asked, casting a disapproving glance at his thin frame.
"It's okay if you're bisexual, Harry," she said matter-of-factly. "But maybe you're not ready to face it," She stood from the chair and kissed him chastely on the cheek. "Please don't drink any more, Harry," she said softly, whilst deftly plucking the bottle of firewhiskey from his hands. "Just think about what I've said, and try to remember it in the morning."
Harry stared at her, lost. "I can't leave him there, Hermione," Harry stared brokenly at his fingers, "I can't let him rot in Azkaban for something that isn't his fault. Especially since his father killed himself there…" Harry trailed off and Draco thought his still-beating heart had been ripped out of his chest, and repeatedly stomped into the dirt.
"No, it wasn't Hagrid. But he didn't take too kindly to us, and hexed…my colleague when his back was turned," she frowned, and Harry matched it with vigour.
Draco Malfoy thought he was about to die of mortification. Pure, simple, mortification. Not only had that bastard Rowan cursed him, but he had done it whilst his back was turned. Added onto that, Hermione had stripped him bare halfway down his arse! In public. And prodded him with her wand to apparently
"Draco," the witch warned whilst casting stern eyes upon her only son. "You are worrying for nought – again might I add. Mr Longbottom is sure to sell to you because you have Mrs. Weasley's and Mr. Potter's respect."
"You don't get it, Harry! Divorces aren't normal here. It will cause such a scandal!" And Harry realised she was thinking about her Quidditch career and smiled softly knowing that she was thinking about herself and her needs.
"I do understand that Harry, but drinking heavily isn't the answer. If the worst should happen and Malfoy is imprisoned then that won't be your fault."
"I wanted you to talk to me, laugh with me, spend time with me, but you didn't look at me with anything but loathing in your eyes, and it killed me! And then you put my father in Azkaban, and I hated myself because I still couldn't bring myself to hate you."
"I…" Ginny faltered and Harry knew he was victorious when he saw the indecision warring on her face. He knew that whilst Ginny loved her mother she could only take her in small doses now that she was an adult. Growing up as the youngest Weasley, and the only girl, meant that Ginny was subject to Molly's exuberant, and often overbearing, nature and she wouldn't be able to cope living back in her childhood home. "Fine." The pout on Ginny's face was pure petulance.
"I said anyone of blood status actually," she corrected, ignoring how Harry rolled his eyes at her. "But essentially yes. Draco isn't interested in me because he's gay. It's quite simple, I can't see why no-one else saw it actually."
After discovering Ginny's infidelity, Harry immediately filed for divorce. If he had his way, he would have filed for divorce years ago but due to the archaic nature of the Wizarding World, divorce was often difficult to achieve. There were only a few ways a marriage could become invalidated and only if these were written into the marriage contract and agreed upon by the bridegroom and groom's father, because even in the 21st century the Wizarding World still thought marriage talks too complicated for the female brain. Physical abuse, infidelity, and line theft were some of the only situations a marriage could end; emotional and sexual abuse were almost completely unrecognsied.
the wizard thought sadly to himself, nearly missing his Mother's next comments. "Speaking of Mr Potter, have you read the gossip section from the Prophet recently dear?"
Trembling feet landed upon the plush carpet, of the modest apartment he owned amidst Muggle London, whilst the pensieve was innocently perching upon the low coffee table to his left, 'And that was only the first memory, she gave me three others, and she listed their order; why is she doing this to me?' the blonde miserably thought to himself, knowing that the witch would somehow discover if he had not complied to her demands.
Draco couldn't help it, a chuckle escaped him, and he smiled a genuine smile at the man. "No, Harry, you are anything but unpredictable. You are noble, and that was the noble thing to do."
"Oh Ron has always been oblivious to most things, but you too, Harry?" she questioned softly 'patronisingly' "Draco would never date me-"
he thought and tried to not to dwell too long on the indignation of baring his arse to the world. "Bloody hell, witch!" get groaned when he heard her talking to
"Draco, you are being an idiot. You are just like Severus sometimes, do you know that? Worrying over the most trivial of things," the woman chided, and despite the wonderful feeling that bloomed in his chest at being compared to his pseudo-father, Draco couldn't help but grow agitated at his mother's blasé tone.
"Shouldn't you be at work today, Hermione?" Harry interrupted quickly. He grimaced at the frown and glare levelled upon him from the pregnant witch.
"Greg's dead because of me! He shouldn't have been there, I should have…!" the words died as another sob racked his body, shame filling every pore as Harry rubbed circles into his shoulders.
From a young age, Ginerva Weasley had held a crush on the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. Her attention was mostly unwanted by the boy in question, and was received with the awkwardness that came to him naturally. She wanted a hero, and for the most part, Harry failed to meet her expectations. However, on the few occasions that he was forced into the role, he played it well and Ginny only became even more infatuated with him and over the years. Eventually, Harry convinced himself that the affection and admiration he had for her was devotion.
"At least, someone I knew had the decency of cursing me in a duel, though I don't suppose it was much of a duel," he mused aloud, and those intense eyes snapped to him. "I did throw the first curse after all. Of course, I didn't know that you knew that spell, but I was trying to harm you, it wasn't as if I was innocent."
"But nothing!" Harry all but hissed at the man, and Draco could feel goosebumps rise on his skin at the two words. "You are acting just like Voldemort's Ministry workers Mr McAvoy! No, don't you dare contradict me! Under Voldemort's rule, the Ministry performed shams of a trial – show trials. Hell, you were performing them in 1981 too! I was witness to a trial against a Muggleborn witch, who had supposedly 'stolen' a wand despite the well-known fact that the wand chooses its own master. She was offered no defence, had no chance to defend herself as the prosecution was at her throat practically every second, and had no opportunity to wash and clothe herself properly. So yes, you are just like one of Voldemort's men, and you most unequivocally should be ashamed," he ended his tirade; sneering down at the slimy man, eyes blazing in righteous anger.
he internally groaned, and strangely Hermione understood the impact that comment affected him, so instead dryly added. "Trailing after a suspected Death Eater does not entail gluing one's eyes to said suspect's arse anyway."
"And what exactly are you attempting to imply about my son?" the Malfoy woman frigidly asked, her eyes glacially cold as they slowly blinked.
A small frown marred the blonde's face at that thought, he had to admit that the wards were slightly draconian. 'But then again, the family motto for the Blacks has always been 'always pure', so it is quite understandable.' However, he had to be slightly annoyed at the fact that Hermione would never see this place, which would most probably not bother her too much except for that fact that the manor garden was the only place in Britain where the English Long-haired Pegasi bred.
and Harry opened his mouth to voice this before Draco continued. "I didn't feel hate for you, it was jealousy, greed, possessiveness, want…"
"How many of you can say that? How many of you can say that you would sacrifice your life, your happiness so that another could live? Because Draco Malfoy effectively did what my mother, Lily Potter did. Draco sacrificed his chance of living to save his mother. My mother ensured I would live at the price of her own life. My mother died at the hands of Voldemort, and I am sure many of yours did too. So let me ask you if you had the chance to stop that happening would you take it?" No-one dared to meet the teenager's gaze, and Draco thought he saw the hints of relief flooding those mesmerising emerald orbs.
"Harry?" she enquired, her gentle tone hardening the longer he spent ignoring her. "I began suspecting it in fifth year," Hermione declared' her hazel eyes were smug with satisfaction at the choking noises Harry created. "I mean even if you did have that supposed 'crush' on Cho Chang it seemed quite forced as if it was expected of you. Added onto the fact that you described your kiss with her as 'wet', I mean sure if she was crying then it would indeed be wet but for you to describe the entire thing as-"
"And I know that now," the words were calm, and his eyes understanding. "But I was sixteen, with the weight of the world on my shoulders, no-one to turn to, and – this seems trivial in comparison – hopelessly in love with a boy who would barely look at me apart from with hatred."
"I wouldn't have to go looking for another man if you just fucked me yourself!" Ginny declared angrily; jumping from the bed to stand before Harry - uncaring about her lack of dress. "You haven't touched me in years! You don't even touch me or hug me anymore. I never see you, we eat in silence, we sleep in the same bed but you don't even kiss me or ask about my day. Am I not good enough for you anymore?" By the end, Ginny had tears streaming down her face and Harry's heart broke a bit more at what he'd reduced her to.
"Mother," the man greeted happily and crouched beside her chair to press a loving kiss to her cheek. "It is lovely to see you also; I trust that you have been well? Your cough has not returned?" Draco asked her, hoping desperately that the most cherished woman in his life was not ill once more.
"Was the accused there?" he asked, and Harry's emerald eyes locked onto the memory's silver ones, hiding multitudes of emotions Draco could not even begin to name. He nodded almost imperceptibly, before voicing his affirmative.
"Hermione, I love you like a sister, an annoying, nagging, older sister, but could you please just drop it?" Draco watched as she sighed in resignation, yet he also saw the determined gaze she sent his way when he wasn't looking. Harry seemed oblivious, however, as he glanced around the Alley, and turned back to his friend. "Hermione, I'm just off to Flourish and Blotts to see if the newest release of Healer Monthly is out, will you be okay what with the sprog and all." He pointedly looked at her stomach, and she smiled fondly at him.
A boyish grin that didn't meet his eyes spread across Harry's face, "Well, there's nothing I can do about it." And Gods did Draco's heart constrict painfully at the hurt and resignation in his love's voice.
"Mate!" Ron exclaimed, walking into the kitchen whilst fixing the shoulders of his Auror uniform. "How are you?"
"Harry James Potter I will tell you now, that you will not work another late-shift. You are tired off your feet, and will be no use to St. Mungo's like that. Floo them now and tell them that you won't be able to make it say you're ill or having family problems."
"Molly!" Harry shouted; making the mother stare at the man with a raised eyebrow and the young man flushed brightly. "Molly," he repeated much quieter this time. "I love you dearly, but you're just slightly overbearing sometimes. The fact is that there aren't that many specialised in the area of spell-damage – not after the war anyway, so I am extremely lucky to have such a brilliant Mediwitch to train under. And as I was going to say, this is my last shift of the week; Healer Zabini has given me the next couple of days off."
"Listen, Dra-Mr Malfoy, I never should have cast a spell I did not know the origins of or counter to. It was entirely my fault and-" the Healer rambled, and Draco could only smile at the nervousness that action held.
Draco thought it best if Hermione never discover that little fact. Then again, if she found out and I never told her...
"Oh Draco, do not fret so," Narcissa chuckled out, "There is nothing wrong with her, in fact, she is positively radiant." the blonde woman's smile widened; Draco focused on her twitching hands, unsurprised that she was performing her favourite past-time – needle-work - but when he actually focused on what she was making his eyes widened. Tiny pegasi stitched along the edge of a small blanket. "Yes, she is pregnant, dear. Is it not brilliant news?" the woman murmured upon seeing the look of understanding upon her son's face.
"Well, I'll just leave you to it. I don't want to offend his delicate sensibilities with my presence. Bye!" she declared before leaving oddly fast for a woman in her condition.
With a smile, she informed her son that she was in good health, and the blonde man released a relieved breath he didn't even know he was holding. "That is wonderful to hear, wonderful," he breathed, whilst seating himself in an elegantly-detailed French salon chair. "Have you been out recently? You seem to be happier than usual," he commented, after taking in her rosy complexion and contented demeanour.
Harry ran to the nearest loo, ignoring his colleagues who watched him pass with concern painted on their faces. Slamming into the toilet door, he braced his hands against the sink, and stared at his flushed, horrified reflection. "Bloody fucking fuck!" he hissed, whilst yanking his glasses off, and splashing freezing water into his face.
'Oh, Merlin, oh Merlin, oh Merlin,' Draco desperately chanted to himself, his heart pounding loudly in his ears as he waited desperately for Harry's response.
"So he's tamed you on that front then?" Harry smirked teasingly, rubbing his arm when it was hit violently.
"What of society, Hermione?" he asked her bitterly and sighing in defeat. "They all have expectations of me. They wanted me to become an Auror and when I didn't they blew up in my face! Why can't they leave me alone! They would never allow me to even think of entering a relationship with Draco!"
Harry nodded before his mind processed the question, as he dazedly took in the beaming face of the man that could beatify St Mungo's loo. "Would you, Draco Malfoy, do the honour of accompanying me on a date, tonight."
It was difficult to keep his eyes open. He had been working around the clock for the past 27 hours with only short naps and espresso shots to keep him going. He was in dire need of a good rest but he knew he had to get this over with first before Ginny received the paperwork finalising the divorce.
"And if you believe that Harry, then you're the most dimwitted person I know for a fact that he does like you," the witch attempted to argue back but was cut off by the irate wizard.
"By all means," the eighteen-year-old charmingly agreed, as he placed his hands upon the desk in front of him, and smiled at those assembled in the court. However, now that the blonde had a clear head, he could see (from experience of hiding his emotions behind a mask for the majority of his life) that the smile was faked. McAvoy beamed back, and Draco thought he resembled a slimy, little toad.
"I think I know someone like that," Harry's voice was wistful, "But their heart belongs to another so I've been told."
"I did not think you could answer that. I do not blame Draco Malfoy, and like I said earlier I am ashamed of the Wizarding World; ashamed that you are all willing to let this teenager's life be wasted away for something he could not do."
"You better be," she said affectionately. "Anyway why would I leave you for another man, I think that our news would be proof of the opposite."
as he made to pass the blonde, but the hand gripping his elbow stopped him. "Is there something you needed?"
"I couldn't really say Mr McAvoy, I mean who can profess the knowledge of being able to understand the actions of Albus Dumbledore," Harry answered charmingly, chuckling at the weak smiles sent his way. "But I can hazard a guess as to why. He didn't want me to stop what was going to happen."
Draco just smiled unashamedly. "I'm sorry that she hurt you, but I'm not sorry you broke up," his words unrepentant as that 'adorably' confused face met his. "Weasley," Draco choked as Harry's cold hands began to rub 'bloody massage!' dittany into his back. "Oh gods, yes…" his moan was guttural and full of pure want as his blood began to flow southwards.
"I… I don't understand," Molly was devastated. "I always thought you two were happy. I know I hadn't seen you two together in a while but I just thought you were busy at work and couldn't visit together. To think you were miserable…" she trailed off to dab her eyes with a kitchen rag.
"Don't worry about that; Chapman won't talk. I've already had it leaked to the Prophet that I was the one who broke our oaths."
"He gave me a task of retrieving an object that would allow him to survive the battle; I couldn't allow him to get it… Oh Gods…" he mumbled into his arm, roughly wiping the tears away.
"Where were you on the 20th June 1997?" the prosecution questioned, and Draco could see his memory-self cringe behind the mask.
"They may have disliked you for becoming a Healer, but the wards Bill put up stopped you from receiving the Howlers and your deal with Luna and other editors prevented them from printing anything too heinous. Hell, if you give them one interview a year then they promised not to print anything about you!"
Smiling softly, he pushed his worries to the furthest darkest corners of his mind and immersed himself in the world which was his second love.
"Nice try, Harry, but Draco is covering my shift for a couple of hours, and I'll cover his tomorrow. Are you going to answer me now?"
Flicking to the most recent notes, he allowed himself a grimace of sympathy. 'Diffindo to the lower back, no wonder the poor bloke's whining.' Well, at least he knew how to treat the wound. 'Yes, of course you do, you couldn't let another Draco Malfoy happen again, could you?'
"Yes they are, Gin," Harry stated quietly. "Your father and I agreed on the terms of the marriage when discussing your settlement, and we agreed that divorce would be possible in the case of any adultery." Ginny let out a soft groan of distress. "Gin, what's wrong? I thought you'd be happy. You can find someone who truly deserves you."
The smile on his bushy-haired friend's face was one that set Harry's teeth on edge, and his stomach clenched painfully at the sight. "Oh no, I'm perfectly fine, Harry. It's a…colleague of mine, you see? We were investigating a man who was collecting blast-ended-skrewts-"
Gasping for breath, Draco sank to the floor of his living-room. He could hardly believe what he had just witnessed, the things which had been alluded to.
Harry's voice was soft. "Yeah, we just didn't work out." Draco snorted lightly at the understatement, causing Harry to glare at him from underneath his lashes.
"No, it was partly my fault, I just can't help but mother you, you're so adorable." the ginger-haired witch admitted.
"I guessed when we in sixth-year, when all he would do was stare at Seamus' and Draco's arses," she answered wryly, laughing delightedly at Harry's blush and Ron's strangled 'Malfoy'
"No you don't!" Draco shot back, glaring when Harry made to interrupt. "I was angry at myself, angry at Him, and angry at you, because you hadn't killed him, and if you had killed Him then I wouldn't have to help him."
Draco's pale blue eyes were levelled upon Harry. "I needed someone to blame, so when you followed me into that bathroom accusing me of cursing Bell, reminding me of my failures, of how I was killing my mother, I snapped, and I wanted you to leave me alone."
"I don't seem to believe that," she murmured, and settled her warm brown eyes on her friend. "Whenever you mentioned his name you smiled to yourself. I haven't seen that smile since we were in first-year. It was so carefree."
Molly Weasley was used to early mornings. After seven children and a busy husband, she had learnt to wake early to meet the needs of her family. Many a woman would have considered this demeaning work, especially since she was proficient with her wand and skilled with her mind, but Molly Weasely thought motherhood and all its domestic duties was the best job around. She could constantly be in contact with her family, keep the house in some sort of chaotic 'order', and ensure that everyone was well-fed.
"Arthur mentioned that you two seemed happy earlier, and you just talked about your news," Molly nonchalantly said, shrewdly looking at the pair before her. "Should I start knitting baby booties now or later?" she asked, clapping her son on the back when he started choking on his toast and smiling benignly at the shocked looks on Harry and Arthur's faces.
"Hush, Ron. Draco has been nothing but a gentleman since the end of the War. He hasn't said one bad word about anyone, and is a very diligent worker."
"And you're coming for dinner tonight," she stated more than questioned, causing the man to grimace, subsequently making her narrow her eyes.
"I – I don't understand what you are talking about 'Mione." the wizard attempted to say but was cut off by his friend.
Circe! He could practically hear the smirk in her voice. And all Hermione did was sit there and watch. However, unlike with Catriona, from Draco's position (lying on his front, propped up on his elbows) he could see the smirk on Hermione's face.
"Nonsense Harry, I'm just so disappointed in Ginerva. I've raised her better," Molly tittered, glaring at the wall wishing it was her daughter.
"I would like to begin by stating how ashamed I am to be a part of the Wizarding World, a thought I've been harbouring ever since I was eleven when I had just been introduced to it." Draco heard the Saviour speak, and watched as his past self's eyelids closed slowly in defeat. "I'm sure many of you are wondering why, and the answer is right before you. You expected a child, who had only known of his heritage and magic for four years to save you all from Voldemort, the darkest wizard to ever live. Added on to that, you decided to punish the children who fought on his side, children barely above the age of eighteen – some younger still." His eyes flashed quickly to Draco, and now that his head wasn't clouded with resignation, he thought he saw concern bubbling in those emerald depths.
