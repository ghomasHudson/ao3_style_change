Olive dead. Alec and Drys traumatized. Draco, a Death Eater who had attended that raid, and in the end, had burned down the Kaspian’s home.
Harry peered at Draco with almost fully closed eyes, and then brought up a hand to touch Draco’s face, almost as if he was making sure it was really Draco before him.
Alec continued: “So, yeah, we were dueling and Harry slipped up at one point, which gave me the chance to cast this brilliant curse I learned that can make someone ill, and while Harry was distracted with the overwhelming feeling of sickness, I cast the body-binding curse and levitated him to my father.” Alec was beaming with pride. “Quite exceptional, don’t you think? A Mudblood defeating the savior of the Wizarding World!”
“So, uh, should we just go back to Hogwarts then?” Potter asked as he and Draco left the Hog’s Head, both of them pulling on their scarves and gloves to brave the harsh cold.
He was then standing next to Drys at the Ministry while the Minister questioned whether or not they had been the ones to kill the Purebloods who’d resided in Hogwarts. Drys put the Minister under the Imperius curse, and they weren’t questioned again.
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. Instead of saying something, he squeezed Draco’s hand, and then let go.
Pansy seemed to be contemplating what she would say next. She was probably going to sit there and argue with him.
Maybe that was why Draco was being arrested, because in the end Theo had been killed by the potion Draco had brewed.
done? Nothing. He hasn’t so much as said a word to anyone but Pansy, for the most part, since the end of the war. Draco was starting to think there was something seriously wrong with him. Not that he hadn’t noticed that before, but now, with Harry’s help, things were starting to become so much more clear.
He instantly ran over to the toilet, and started dry heaving into it. It was all a lot to take in. He had hoped the Mark would have stopped
The room was incredibly hot, and apparently Harry thought so too, because he reluctantly separated from Draco to pull his robes off. Draco quickly pushed Harry’s hands down so that he had the pleasure of undressing his top half. He tried not to pop a button from his Gryffindor robes, but he thought he accidentally did, and hoped Harry wouldn’t mind later. Once his robes were off, Draco lifted up Harry’s shirt and ran his hands up and down Harry’s muscular torso, relishing on how his skin felt under Draco’s hands, and just how fucking
Draco glanced skeptically down at the book, faced with the reality of not wanting to have to reveal something so confidential, but wanting to earn Potter’s trust back at the same time.
They had both unexpectedly come so far from the two boys who despised the other, and could barely stand in the others presence without hurling insults. And it had all been done in a week. Who knew one week could change your relationship with someone. Especially that ‘someone’ being the man who Draco terrorized throughout his years at Hogwarts.
gave me, and witnessing countless murders, I actually ended up killing someone myself. Including my own father.”
He didn’t voice any of what he was thinking to Potter. “It’s getting late. It’ll be completely dark soon.”
Every single part of his body had been telling him to grip his forearm and sooth the pain, but he couldn’t. Not with Harry around. He would’ve known right away something was wrong and probably forced Draco to show him the Mark.
“It’s an Anemonlea flower. You remembered,” Draco said. It was so very important to him that Harry had remembered the flower they had seen when coming back from Hogsmeade the first day of the curse. He knew why. Remembering a tiny little detail, that brought back memories of the two of them, meant that Harry hopefully had feelings for him? Or, it wasn’t like that to Harry at all. To him, it could be a flower that looked pretty and different from all the others, with absolutely no meaning to Harry.
He currently didn’t know where he was, or how he could form coherent thoughts, but he knew he heard voices, and sometimes he could see certain faces in the darkness.
His stamina and endurance were the best they’ve been since fifth year. This week he’d eaten properly and had multiple walks around and outside of Hogwarts; his body was stronger than ever. Even if his body wasn’t back to full health completely, he was making progress. He only hoped that when this sleeping curse was all over, he’d maintain healthy eating and exercise habits.
“It’s just difficult to say goodbye after all these years you know? And now we have to worry about what lays ahead of us…” He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to do with his life. He’d only recently decided he wasn’t going to be living at Malfoy Manor anymore, the house that his mother didn’t sell, and the one where he didn’t want sold, either. But just because he didn’t want to see it lost to his family forever, didn’t mean he was going to live there after everything.
She’d been planning this for months now, and even though throughout all those months, Draco had begged for her not to throw a huge party, she knew Draco would love it and have a bloody brilliant time. She was absolutely sure of it.
“Okay, I can’t do this, Draco,” Harry blurted out, which promptly silenced the elve’s noises in Draco’s ears. “Are you mad at me, or something?”
leave the bathroom door unlocked, and they could get ready for bed while he used the shower, but he was way too self-conscious for that. It wasn’t like anyone would see him, for there were shower curtains, but the thought that there was always a possibility they could was unpleasant. So, Draco cast several locking charms on the door that could not be easily opened by
At one point during their walk, Potter tripped over some rock buried in the snow, landing face first into the icy ground. Draco thought of how similar the moment was to when they had both walked back from Hogsmeade late at night while it had snowed, and Potter had slipped on a patch of ice.
So far, all of Saturday he and Harry constantly looked at Theo’s spot on Harry’s map, and so far, Theo hadn’t moved even the slightest inch.
Draco scoffed. “You could be wrong, you could be right. Who knows. What really matters here is: We. Don’t. Have. A. Cure. We’re stuck in a school with sleeping bodies, and absolutely no means of escape. On top of all that, it’s almost Saturday. Which means it’s almost Sunday. And Sunday, I assure you, something bad will happen.”
“You’re right. How could I not have thought to look in potions?” Draco was seriously angry with himself. If he had been in the right headspace, they might have already been able to have the cure ready to use.
“I can’t believe your favorite team is the Chudley Cannons. That’s Ron's favorite team,” Potter said with a laugh.
Draco cleared his throat. “Right. Thanks.” He snuck a short glance towards Harry, whose cheeks were aflame. “How’d you know to come down here?”
They walked side by side, passing multiple students and professors who gave them weird looks. Draco wanted to look down at his shoes, to hide from everyone’s gazes, but he didn’t dare to act on that urge in the presence of Harry.
Harry stopped dancing when he saw Draco sit down, and a frown spread across his face. “Don’t you want to dance? Do you not like the song?”
“And Harry, I wanted to let you know I'm sorry. For abandoning you. For making you wait for this talk. For just anything imaginable that I have to be sorry for.” He closed his eyes briefly, taking in his own words. “I hope that after all this time, after all that’s happened, we can still be friends.”
In reality, no matter what you thought was right, if it led to the death of people, it was always wrong. Somehow, the world worked that way, and it took Draco way too long to see it.
After a couple of hushed whispers and staring, Slughorn and every other student went back to worrying about their own potions. That was, except for Kaspian, who strode over to Draco’s table.
About three minutes passed, the two Death Eater’s patted Drys down to check for his wand, which they found right away, and Drys screamed for help in heart wrenching volumes.
He finally found his green scarf, hat, and gloves and put them on. He already had changed out of his robes and dress shirt and had switched to a black jumper with his winter coat on top.
“Why are you even here, Malfoy? It’s the middle of January and you seriously haven’t picked up on any indication that no one wants you at Hogwarts?” Theo drawled from beside Smith. The two of them were getting even closer to Draco.
He was utterly bored out of his mind watching Potter cast the same spell over and over again, so to occupy himself, he found a children's book on dragons and started looking through it. Potter did not approve of his book, yelling at Draco to help him learn the
“I’ve heard plenty of stories, you know,” Theo remarked, trying to come off nonchalant. “No one seems to know the correct one, though. There’s ‘Oh, did you hear how Malfoy killed Alec’s father?’ and also, ‘Did you know Malfoy intentionally set Hogwarts under a sleeping curse to murder them at their weakest?’”
He stuffed the fake book back inside his pocket, and took one last look at Snape and Dumbledore, before setting off to go find his true love.
people, and no longer hide in the shadows anymore. I think that’s one of the first things I’m going to do when the sleeping curse is lifted; apologize to everyone and just make it clear I’m a different man.”
Draco began to relax at the sight of everything. It looked nothing like the place where he had worked tirelessly on the Vanishing Cabinet. The fireplace didn’t even remind him of the Fiendfyre that had happened in that very room. It gave off a homey feel instead, which Draco really appreciated.
The journal was completely battered, the outside torn, filled with stains, and scribbled on in quill. What caught his eye the most was the signature at the bottom; the letters ‘DK’ in cursive, and next to it ‘OB’. Just the two they were looking for.
He wanted to see his father one last time before he left the world. He wanted to tell Lucius how much he loved him, despite everything.
So here Draco was, sulking over the fact that he had to go to group therapy today with Kaspian. He also had Potions and D.A.D.A. today with the bloke.
“Draco!” Harry smiled as they pulled away from each other. “Happy-” but he never got to finish his sentence. Ron grabbed his arm, saying something about impressing a Ministry official, and just like that, the trio was gone.
He wouldn’t have to go through the pain of watching Harry die. Not caring, when he would be turned into the Ministry and most likely die himself.
Harry bent down to pick a flower, and Draco honestly didn’t feel like stopping him. “Harry, what on Earth are you doing?”
Draco knew he shouldn’t be saying those rude things. Especially to Savior Boy here. Draco rarely talked as it was, he didn't know why he was breaking his 'no talking to anyone but Pansy' rule he came up with. He also only talked when professors called on him to answer questions. Which was hardly ever. They all either despised him so much that they couldn’t even look at him, or were downright scared of him, which also meant they hardly ever looked at him. But, something about Potter just made Draco so infuriatingly angry, and it was like he had to lash out at him. Also, there was no one else around.
Draco dramatically rolled his eyes, making sure Pansy would see. “There is nothing to tell. Nothing.”
Draco had pictured spending the rest of his life with Harry. He pictured lots of kisses and snuggles and late night walks. He pictured a future with lots of cleaning up, and lots of forgiveness, but he’d come to accept that that was okay. He knew things would be messy between them, and they’d have to fight to be together, but as long as they were by each other’s sides, they’d get through life and all its obstacles.
“Draco.” He felt Harry’s hand touch his shoulder slightly, and even though the contact came as a surprise, Draco didn’t flinch. “I’ve known you since… forever. I honestly can’t imagine my life without you in it.”
Instinctually, he felt for the rim of his sleeve under his Slytherin robes, and inwardly winced at the fact that
“What do you think, Potter? I was trapped. That’s why I yelled, ‘Help! I'm stuck in this broom closet!’ Do you ever think before you speak?”
His wand was held firmly in his hand, the Dark Mark on his arm stinging and calling out to him, but he ignored it. He briefly remembered that it was pointless carrying around his wand, as he was not allowed to cast any defensive charms, but it wouldn’t even come to that if he could find Harry before something terrible could find him first.
Draco was taken aback by Potter’s words. He tried to think of a witty, snarky remark that would surely end the Potter bloodline, but nothing came to him. He just stood there, staring at Potter blankly, with his mouth slightly open, processing everything he had just heard from The Boy Who Lived.
He felt rough, hard stone at his back and under his hands, and all of a sudden knew he was lying in the pavilion, the place he and Harry had ended up after their snowy rendezvous. The back of his eyelids were suddenly filled with flashes of the previous night: Draco crying, Harry talking, Harry sharing gifts, and their blissful snogging session in the freezing snow.
. His magic was pulling on me, and then It had been like a string was cut between the two of us. He couldn’t control me no matter what spells he cast, even variations of
Although, Draco would try his hardest to succeed, given that Harry’s life was on the line along with hundreds of others.
When Pansy had asked him why he looked ‘so sad’, he had glanced in Harry’s direction, and she got the memo.
“Your blood, Draco, also allowed me to contact you in your sleep. I had originally planned on telling you my offer on day one, but contacting you proved to be difficult. It hadn’t fully worked until about a week in, unfortunately.” Drys cocked his head to the side. “Maybe if you had had the full two weeks, you’d have made the correct decision. Not that that matters any more.”
“So, listen. I’m sorry about what I said earlier. I think we should stop insulting each other for now on, if we actually want to accomplish anything. We’re the only ones awake. We have to accept that fact. We’re on our own.
He then heard a loud gasp, and saw that Granger had apparently spotted Draco, and was running over to where he laid in the back of the classroom.
Draco could deny it, truthfully. They weren’t able to get the spell to break the ward to work, and some evil wizard offered Draco a horrible deal. Instead all he said was: “Sure, Harry.”
Blaise punched Theo smack in the side of the head, his fist made of iron and his expression void of any emotion except for pure anger.
“Well, get it into your head that it wasn’t.” Harry’s hands found their way into Draco’s hair. “You know, I never spoke to you about what you said to Hermione and Ron. When they told me you’d apologized to them, I swear my brain stopped working for a second there.”
Automatically Draco’s thoughts went to his dream, how he thought it might have been a call for help. Could it have something to do with why everyone was asleep?
“Don’t touch me!” Draco finally snapped. “Get your hand off of me!” He was fuming now. He noticed his hands were starting to shake, and his breath was coming up short.
His wand was out of reach, and out of sight, and he quickly felt around on the ground beside him, hoping his wand was somewhere close, and dreading what would happen to him if he didn’t have a protection up and around him soon.
He had absolutely no clue what to do. He should tell someone. This had to mean the Dark Lord was back. But that was ridiculous, Draco had seen him die, like a mortal man. He could never, ever return.
After Blaise had punched Theo, he became a part of Draco and Pansy’s little group. Draco had another friend.
The new found confidence in him allowed himself to apologize to a number of people; including most Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and teachers and ghosts in general.
Harry stood in place, absolutely furious. The rain running down his face and dampening his hair added an intensely dramatic effect. “You need to leave. Right fucking now.”
In the back of his mind, he knew it had been out of line to just take off the way he had, leaving Harry standing shocked and worried at the back of the library. Maybe a little part of him had thought wherever he went, Harry would surely follow. Well, he was wrong. As he kept running, he turned his head constantly, wanting to see if Harry was chasing after him, but Harry wasn’t.
Weasley, who was facing Harry, which meant he was also facing Draco’s direction, started to say something, when he obviously realized they were being overheard and watched.
Draco avoided looking in Theo’s direction and sat down next to Pansy on her left side, which was the farthest he could get from Theo.
And so into the Hogshead they went. Draco liked to think that the Hogshead was specifically chosen instead of The Three Broomsticks courtesy of Harry.
It was weird to have two friends now. Pansy and Harry. Two unlikely candidates that chose to stick around with him. Well, Pansy had definitely been more likely to befriend him, and before they had really become friends, she’d already been his acquaintance for a while. Though, she had more respectable friends to hang out with, she chose him. Harry chose him also. Even though the circumstances were rather extenuating.
Draco shook his head, confused at Harry’s sweet response. “But I thought you hated me? I mean, I bullied you and your friends. I was- am. A-”
He turned on his heels, and headed in the direction of the library, where he would start research on whatever was going on. He was sure Potter was staring dumbly at the back of Draco’s hair.
, the most depressing thought, Harry didn’t care enough to go running after Draco this time. Maybe he finally saw right through Draco’s lies, and didn’t care if Draco got hurt or kidnapped.
Harry made no sense. If they had done that, who knew if the Figure would’ve just killed people anyways, without warning Draco first. He hadn’t
He wanted his mother. He wanted to be wrapped up in her warm embrace. He wished he would have written back to her the last time she’d sent a letter.
Potter nodded in agreement. “I guess we weren’t able to find this antidote because we’d been looking in curses and charms, not potions.”
In all honesty, Draco just didn’t feel like dancing. He supposed he could tell Harry his reason, even though Harry probably wouldn’t believe him. But Harry had said he wouldn’t intrude and try to force answers out of Draco anymore, as long as Draco wasn’t holding back any crucial information regarding the curse. (Which he was.)
He so desperately wanted to ask Potter if what they had accumulated over the past week was something close to friendship. He wanted to know where he stood with Potter- what Potter saw Draco as. But, like always, he was a coward who couldn’t form the right words. He wished Potter would just outright ask him if they were friends, so Draco wouldn’t have to. He wasn’t sure whether Potter was also scared of asking the question, or if he just didn’t care, and didn’t spend all day thinking about if they were friends or not; so the question never even crossed his mind.
“Right.” Potter leaned over the blank page. “Book, please reveal to us a spell that will break magical wards.”
He gave in, in the end, wrapping his own arms around Harry’s waist. In response, Harry hugged him tighter.
In the back of Draco’s mind, he remembered the temperature in the Garden switching from freezing to scolding hot. Now, the temperature was perfect. Everything was perfect. Harry was perfect. Harry was beautiful. Harry was leaning against him and breathing soft, reassuring breaths onto Draco’s neck.
He didn’t have any intention of talking anymore, but his mouth seemed to have other plans. “I’m just- so tired. So so fucking tired of this whole mess.” Draco put his head in his hands. “I’m just such a horrible person, I could probably write an essay worth ten pieces of parchment describing what a- what a-”
“I did what had to be done, and I know you already know this, but you did too. If you look at it in a certain perspective, Drys was just as bad as Voldemort.”
At least for one night anyways until they figured out the next best option of where they should sleep.
There were too many things he wanted to say to Harry before they both died. He was the one person he physically could talk to at the moment, but he had a feeling Drys wouldn’t let that happen.
” So Draco did, against his better judgement. Harry went on now that their eyes were locked. “I care about you. So, so much. Which is a sentence I never thought would come out of my mouth, but it’s true.”
He would be judged for his past mistakes for the rest of his life. Would never be given the chance to show he had changed.
He wanted to thank Pansy for being an amazing friend. She had stuck with him throughout eighth year when no one else would. She deserved a hug and an ‘I love you.’
“Uh, that’s not the Restorative Potion,” Harry pointed out, a look of befuddlement on his face as he examined the potion vial in Draco’s hand.
Potter let out a low ‘ugh’ sound, and turned away from Draco. “You know I realized that, thank you.”
He still couldn’t quite wrap his head around the whole situation that was unraveling before him. Why did all of this stuff have to happen to him? Hadn’t he already suffered enough? Was this the universe’s way of getting revenge for all of the horrible stuff he had done? But if that were true, why was Potter also here? Potter had done absolutely nothing wrong. It all didn’t make sense. There were so many questions he had, it felt like it was impossible for them all ever to be answered.
“Don’t think like that. Our good luck streak can still continue, this is just a little bump in the road,” Potter said softly, like he was speaking to a child.
The world was spinning, everything moving uncontrollably fast, while also slow. The ringing in Draco’s ears intensified greatly, and the sting that constantly emanated from his left forearm increased.
He hastily locked the bathroom and yanked up his sleeve, and not to his surprise, the skull and snake was jutting profusely out of his arm and moving angrily.
“If you don’t want to hang out with me, or be around me, that’s fine. I don’t want to pressure you. I don’t want to force something on you that you don’t want. But please just tell me. Tell me what you want and I’ll do it.”
He knew it had to go back farther than when the sleeping curse had started; there was already something planted inside of Draco from their other years at Hogwarts, and all he needed to awaken that something was to spend time with Harry and only Harry for more than a week, figuring out the curse together, walking around Hogwarts together, sleeping
Draco pictured the memory vividly in his mind, slowly calming down the panic that had arisen in him.
It was then that Draco realized more than half of the Great Hall’s occupants were watching him. Not watching him in disgust or anything related, but the way they constantly looked at Harry; with admiration and awe.
“I’m sure it does look good in my hair. Though, I doubt it enhances my appearance, because my looks are already naturally enhanced.”
Harry had been right, it had taken him approximately one minute to run to the potions room and back. He was slightly out of breath when he finally reached Draco, holding out the vial that was definitely the correct potion, the liquid inside a lighter shade of green.
This time Pansy groaned. “It’s been three weeks now, Draco. I know I told you it was fine to wait a bit to talk to him, to work things out by yourself, but honestly you both look terrible.” She pointed discreetly to Harry across the hall, who wasn’t even trying to hide his tiredness and was staring blankly at the table.
The walk to the unknown location to which Harry was leading Draco to was unbearably quiet. They both didn’t have a clue as to what to say to each other now that their reunion was over.
Though, Draco supposed, his name wasn’t much better. At least his name meant dragon, which was sort of cool.
Draco studied Potter. He was chewing on his bottom lip, and his black hair was falling into his eyes. He acted like it didn’t annoy him, and just let the strands hang there. Draco subconsciously pushed his own hair out of the way, even though it wasn’t even close to covering his eyes like Potter’s hair was.
But, every moment had to stop at some point. That was a part of life. No one could live in one moment forever, sadly. It was comforting to know, though, that if he were ever given the opportunity to live in one memory forever, it would undoubtedly be the one Draco was still experiencing.
“Yes, well.” Draco cleared his throat, slightly parched from all the talking. He brought a glass of water to his lips and downed it whole. “Drys was already talented with creating and experimenting with spells all on his own, before he got his greedy hands on Snape’s marvelous book. I bet the book that holds all of Drys’ personal information on how he created the Garden of Mystics and all his own spells is still in the castle at this very moment…”
After he finished dry heaving, he sat against the wall, and his eyes moved to stare at his Mark once again. The cut that had been there was now almost completely healed, save for the faintest sight of a scar, that was hardly recognizable due to all the other scars around the same area.
Eventually, Harry brought his lips down to hover over the Dark Mark, and Draco gave him a nod. A million chills passed through Draco as the direct contact happened, and a million more chills were produced every time Harry lifted his lips to kiss another part of the Mark.
And so Harry touched the Mark, with all the gentleness in the world at his fingertips. Draco’s blood was on fire, and his heart was about to escape his chest, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop Harry; he didn’t want Harry to stop.
raced through his head as he waited for the Figure to pull back his hood. He thought it really might be Theo, somehow. Or maybe it was Theo’s father, even though he
Draco took in the wonderful sight before his eyes. The floor was covered in cobblestones with tiny flowers and moss in between all the crevices, the walls mirrored the floor, with large amounts of moss and vines. In the very center of the room, a water fountain stood, spitting out water and letting it fall into the pool below, encased by the same bricks that made up the walls. Surrounding the water fountain and outer rim of the Garden, several wooden benches stood, along with different kinds of plants and flowers.
Harry’s hand cupped Draco’s cheek, his finger rubbing the Sectumsempra scar that was there. His other hand made its way into Draco’s hair, and Draco melted all over again.
So what they had to reveal some sort of secret. How was the book supposed to know what was inside their brain? How did Snape
He sighed in relief, and wrapped his arms around Harry a little tighter. “You wanna know a terrible little secret of mine?” He mumbled into Harry’s neck.
“Wait, we don’t even know the password.” Draco added glumly as he was about to try and surpass the gargoyle. Besides the fact that they quite literally couldn’t get into the office without a passcode, he knew he was stalling. He was terrified to see his former headmaster’s portrait hanging in the room.
Draco had gone to bed with his arm burning horribly, and had to hide his discomfort from Potter which proved to be extremely hard, since the git was nosey about every single little thing.
“Yes, well. There’s always room for improvement. And besides I’m not teaching you. I don’t know any of those spells in that book. I’m just going to assist you in learning them and mastering some.” Draco pointed at the book in Potter’s hand.
, and that he’d deal with it, since Harry was obviously ill. “Alec kidnapped me, that’s what.” Draco couldn’t see Harry’s face, but Harry was clearly shooting looks at Alec that could kill. “He played all innocent and lost, and I said I’d explain what was going on. Then, the moment I turned my back, he cast a stinging jinx at me. I threw a spell at him, and then we were practically dueling-” he started coughing once again.
Draco banged his head against the door. He really needed to get out of here. He was starting to panic and he could feel the swell of tears against his eyelids. Not that he was going to cry. He wasn’t going to cry.
Draco got ready for bed, thankful that the Room of Requirement gave him everything he might possibly need. Even the pyjamas it had provided were top quality, they were like the ones he had at The Manor; silk and the color of deep green.
He was about to finish burying himself under the warm blankets, when he felt his heart give a small tug, leaving a burning ache traveling throughout his body. He tried to push away the feeling that was attempting to wrap around his insides, but he couldn’t this time. The worst part was, he now thought he knew why he constantly had this strange feeling, a feeling that only came over him whenever he was talking, looking, or anywhere near Harry.
Throughout the rest of their meal, they talked to each other as if they had been friends for years, and it made Draco feel like he was floating.
“Mrs. Parkinson,” Professor McGonagall stated from beside Pansy. Her lips were set in a firm line, and Pansy finally realized who was standing there. She visibly blanched at the actuality that she had just pushed the Headmistress to the side.
“Draco!” Harry screamed. Draco rolled his eyes and gripped the sink harder. “I will break down this door!”
Sometime deep into the night, Draco was curled up next to Harry, all the lights extinguished and their clothes discarded save for their underwear. He pressed his nose to Harry’s cheek and continuously kissed him there, just because he could. Harry’s arm was protectively around him, tracing designs on the bare skin.
Someone what? Someone who would be Draco’s friend? Someone who would be there for Draco to cry on? Someone who wanted to be in a relationship with Draco? He wished Harry would stop being so cryptic.
his hair was. Draco may have pulled a little too hard, though, as Harry let out a low moan. Draco laughed into Harry’s mouth, but that just made Harry kiss him deeper, something he hadn’t even known was possible.
“This looks promising,” Draco said, showing Harry the page he was looking at. It was a spell that could reveal hidden passageways, and knowing Hogwarts, there was certainly an abundance that they could possibly find.
But saying sorry was better than saying nothing. “I- I’m so sorry,” Draco said, and he really meant it. “I was a fool for siding with
Drys twirled his wand in his hand. “I’ve told you. I’m an expert at creating and experimenting with spells. Snape’s book was a great help, too.”
“How did you not die? When you were a baby? The Dark Lord hit you with the Killing Curse, and you survived.”
Draco nodded and turned back towards the gargoyle. Was he really doing this? Was he really going to have to face Dumbledore? At least Potter would be there with him to ease the tension, but still.
Draco explained every detail of how he had done it. He explained how he used the spell to break magical wards, Obice Confractus, out of Snape’s book, and how he’d assumed the spell would allow the passage of only small objects through the ward, rather than human bodies, or breaking the ward as a whole.
Harry had explained exactly how he’d been able to see Draco torture Rowle, along with many other stories about his adventures at Hogwarts and during seventh year when he was on the run. In return, Draco had vaguely told him what life was like living with the Dark Lord, leaving out a lot of the more gruesome aspects. Which was technically almost everything.
After a while of sitting around and doing absolutely nothing, he made his way onto a balcony, and found a bench to sit on. Inside was way too claustrophobic, and there was luckily no one else out on the balcony.
They hadn’t moved since forever, only picking up their wands to recast warming charms once in a while.
Who cared what everyone else thought of him? Who cared if the world saw him as an evil villain? Well, Draco did. Draco cared a great amount. But he wasn’t about to let that stop him from finding the man he loved.
Draco was still full of misery, still thinking about everything he had done wrong in the past two weeks, the past two years, and basically every year of his life. He wanted to give the illusion to Harry that he was alright, though, at least for the moment. He wanted Harry to think he’d solved all of Draco’s problems. He wanted Harry to be happy, which was more important than his own happiness.
Ever since coming to the Earth-shattering revelation that Draco was in love, the revelation that had hit him about an hour ago, everything was upside down, and Draco didn’t know whether anything could ever be right side up again. The real question was, did he want everything to go back to normal now? Now that he’d found
“So, you really don’t mind everything?” Draco asked skeptically. He hadn’t really wanted to change their lighthearted discussion. “Everything that happened over the span of the Sleeping Curse? All the messed up shit I did?”
“I know the Curse was horrible, and what Drys did was wrong, no matter the intentions. And what he did revolved around my family and I, he wanted me to suffer, no matter the outcome; and he got his wish, but...” he positioned his head so that he could look directly at Harry, and Harry followed suit. “What he didn’t realize, what he didn’t plan, was that I would come out of it all with this.” He took a breath. “Everything that’s happened has led me to you.”
Harry finally turned to look at him for the first time since they sat down in their respective spots. Draco had to bite down on his lip to keep himself from smiling.
. They were such unnatural positions; it had to be uncomfortable. No one could have intentionally fallen asleep with their fingers pinched between pages, heads poking the sharp corners of books. Except for maybe Granger, but she was the only exception.
so many times the past hour, Draco’s ears were starting to hurt by listening to the word on repeat. He hadn’t even made any progress either, so Draco’s head was throbbing for nothing.
to be with him. No if, buts, or maybes. Harry had kissed Draco, Harry had wanted to kiss Draco a second time in the kitchens, Harry had danced with him and laughed with him and smiled at him and only him because, despite everything, Harry had feelings for Draco.
He was dancing in the Garden with Harry. Although, Draco left that part out when relaying it back to the real Harry, who was still sitting intently in front of him, his eyes glossy.
Draco was about to get up and grab his ingredients when the door to the room slammed open, revealing Potter. Draco was surprised he hadn’t noticed Potter's absence sooner.
“Well, if you believe that, that only gives you a more motivating reason to keep on trying, to keep on trying to better yourself, because one day, I assure you, you will be the best version of yourself. A version of yourself filled with self love and self reassurance.” Harry squeezed his hand. “I know I can’t really compare to… uh, your experiences during the war, but I had to better myself this summer. I had to find self love. I already sort of told you all this on Thursday, in the Garden, but I haven’t exactly found it quite yet, but I think I’m getting there. Slowly, but surely. You just have to pick something or someone that gets you to fight, everyday, for yourself. Someone that cares about you.” Harry squeezed his hand again.
Slughorn had a response all written out too, lying on his desk. Draco picked it up and skimmed it over, basically learning that Slughorn thought he should be given a Poor grade for his work.
If his Professors still hated him, and wanted to give him Poor grades and converse with each other about his work and other things about him specifically, all because he had been stupid enough to work for the Dark Lord, then how was Draco supposed to save Harry, let alone the whole school? Every single person in the world was working against him, even his teachers; conspiring against him to make his life hell, even after the war was over.
“We should really get back to Hogwarts then. Can you walk?” Potter shifted uncomfortably on his feet.
It was a slow kiss, sparks flying between them and eating Draco alive. It was perfect. Harry’s lips perfectly parted his own, soft and delicate. He tasted like treacle tart and all things sweet.
With a couple of quick glances over his shoulder to where he could hear Potter casting away, he hastily made his way over to a window in the very back of the library- his wand, letter, and Snape’s book in hand.
“Um, that isn’t fair. Malfoy has to answer the question just like the rest of us,” Kaspian said, sitting opposite from Draco and looking severely ticked off.
“I don’t really know what to think anymore. I mean, I trust your word, if in your ‘visions’ there really was some guy telling you something awful would happen Sunday, then yeah, maybe tomorrow is going to be… not so great,” Harry spoke so seriously, it made Draco snort. “But, the future isn’t certain, there could be a million possibilities for tomorrow.”
He bolted down the hall and swung into the potions classroom, and started to call out Theo’s name. If he were in the potions room, he would most likely be visible to Draco right away. It was a dark classroom, but not
However, Draco was brought back to real life when his robes were completely off, only leaving his long sleeved shirt as the barrier against his naked skin. Harry didn’t seem to sense Draco’s change in mood, and was in the process of flipping them over so that Harry was lying on top of Draco, when he finally looked down into Draco’s eyes and stopped.
For a minute no one said anything, and the only noise that could be heard was the crackling sounds of curses and spells hitting Draco’s protective shield.
Harry had said to him, when really it was the opposite. Draco couldn’t live in a world without Harry Potter.
Draco nodded at Harry, and Harry lightly pressed his fingers over the ugly scar that marred the right side of his face. “Well,” Draco coughed, “Uh, you see, it was from that day… in Myrtle’s bathroom…”
Draco had to admit, he felt a hint of gratitude for Harry, since he had left well enough alone when he suspected Draco had been lying about what had been tapping at the window. On the other hand, if Harry had voiced his suspicions aloud then, Draco probably would have revealed all the secrets he’d been keeping right then and there, and they wouldn’t have ended up kissing each other while Draco had been full of lies.
“Congrats on being a hero, by the way,” Harry spoke. The words sounded mocking, but Draco knew Harry was being sincere.
by now, but he had been wrong. It had only hurt the slightest amount at Hogsmeade, but he had ignored it then, focusing on the mission at hand. But now he had nothing to occupy his mind, and worse, nothing to occupy Potter’s mind, so he would surely wonder why Draco had sprinted to the bathroom.
“Malfoy. Malfoy! Wake up!” The figure was screaming his name. But no, that wasn’t right. He smelled soap and sweets, and the hooded figure surely didn’t smell that nice. “Malfoy!”
He didn’t feel the need to become numb anymore, as his mood was gradually getting better, and his fears for what was to come slipped away piece by piece, but he enjoyed lying in the snow next to Harry. He oddly, really, really, enjoyed it.
He hoped his mind wasn’t somehow playing tricks on him, making Draco think he was in love with Harry. He didn’t think that was even possible, since no one could make someone fall in love with another person, but they could manipulate you into thinking you were in love. Something Draco wouldn’t wish upon his greatest enemy. Except for the Dark Lord. Obviously. Or Kaspian. Or Theo.
Snape’s book hadn’t provided the steps to distribute the Restorative Potion, but Draco had been thinking they’d possibly use their last question from Snape’s book to get their answer, however, he hadn’t clued Harry in on his thoughts.
While snogging, droplets of rain had started to fall, to which they took no notice too, but when the light drizzle had turned into a full blown rain storm, they had taken cover under the pavilion, which really hadn’t been the best place to go, since there was no walls to protect them, but they’d both been dazed and full of lust, not wanting to go too far as to ruin their moment.
“I have something for you.” Harry started to pat down his robes, as if he were looking for something, and Draco tried his hardest not to stare so blatantly.
About two days after finding out his father had died, Draco was still constantly wondering where Harry was, and why hadn’t he come to visit yet. So, finally, he worked up the courage to casually ask Pansy about Harry.
“Well, I think it is the time.” He moved his head so that their noses were brushing slightly, and Draco swore he could almost see himself reflected perfectly in Harry’s green eyes.
Potter continued to act strange and closed-off around Draco as they had brewed the Restorative Potion together. Well, Draco did all of the actual work, and Potter handed Draco the ingredients he needed, much like he did the previous Friday in Potions class.
Well, it was horrible if you counted going behind someone else’s back sickening; someone you specifically told you wouldn’t keep secrets from.
Well, except one dream of his. A dream that wouldn’t come true if Draco kept avoiding it. He touched the gem dangling under his robes; he never forgot to wear it.
Thank you to everyone who's read this story so far! It seriously means so much to me. Thank you all!
They kept on kissing and kissing, stopping to breath every once in a while, but then resuming again. Harry brought Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth and Draco
When he reached the smokey area, he waved away as much of the fumes as he could, and stared down at the floor. He heard a faint gasp coming from beside him, which could only be Potter, and he knew exactly what he was gasping at.
Their lips met in a soft and slow kiss. Draco was hesitant at first, not really knowing the boundaries of what they were doing, but when Harry moved his mouth against Draco’s, Draco followed right on cue.
Once they had finished their odd dinner- or what he should call a late night snack- they stood up and rearranged their chairs back to where they were placed before. Potter reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a couple galleons, setting it on the table. Draco felt like he should say something about how he could pay for himself, but when he reached into his own trouser pocket, he felt nothing, and remembered he hadn’t put any money in his pockets, as he had thought he wouldn’t be needing it. It was weird having
The two of them ripped apart from one another at light speed. Luckily, they had not gone far with what they had planned on doing. Although, the damage was certainly done. There was no way Pansy had missed seeing their close proximity.
Harry was awkwardly lying half across Draco’s torso, his feet near Draco’s shoulder’s and his head near Draco’s feet.
Draco was glad he got the bed closest to the window, though he supposed it wasn’t exactly a window and more of just glass. He loved to look out of it, and into the depths of the lake. It was very calming, looking at the different creatures that swam by, it cleared his head.
“I’m just trying to help, Malfoy. Even after all these years, you’re still a right git who won’t accept help, even when someone offers.”
They sat close together, and Draco was blissfully aware of how close they were, and how their hands were still linked together. His free hand fiddled with the gem hidden under his shirt, and he gazed up at the night sky once again, breathing in the freezing air.
Right before he left the room, Draco glanced back towards McGonagall’s desk and saw Dumbledore and Snape watching him leave. Snape gave one nod towards Draco, to which Draco smiled at. Dumbledore gave a small wave, his eyes gleaming behind his half moon spectacles. Draco waved back.
Draco went on, “And- uh- did the cut leave- any scars?” A small part of him wanted to believe the gash over the snake and skull would stay there forever, disfiguring the vile tattoo enough so that he would never have to look directly at it again. But as Madame Pomfrey looked into Draco’s eyes, he knew what the answer would be.
Of course, the universe hated him, and it inevitably was the person he wanted to see least of all. Draco looked down at the hand that was still clutching his wrist, and immediately tensed. He tried tugging away, but Potter’s grip was firm. He wasn’t going anywhere.
“Well after you told me you spoke Latin, the next day in the library when you were off browsing the books in the library, I found a book on Latin nearby, and decided to take a look for myself. The first page I opened to was phrases regarding the stars and the sky and stuff, and I read a phrase that stuck with me, ‘Ad Astra Per Aspera’.”
Harry dropped his hand suddenly, like fire had seeped through Draco’s scar, burning his fingers. “No. Oh God- No. I’m- God, Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry said, and Draco could tell tears were starting to form in Harry’s eyes. Draco frowned.
. Potter was apparently thinking the same thing. He had his mouth open, and Draco itched to say something along the lines of, “You’ll catch flies, Potter. Stop gaping like a complete idiot.” But he was sure Potter would slap him.
Harry saw him coming and his face lit up. Draco’s face mirrored Harry’s and he was about to embrace him in a hug when Hermione blocked his way, shoving a glass of champagne into his hand.
Lucius Malfoy was another possibility, too. Maybe all this time, he wanted to get revenge on Harry, and using his own son in his terrible scheme was his cruel way of revenge. But, under all of his father’s hard outer core, Draco knew Lucius loved him. If he really had wanted to get revenge on Harry, Lucius would have never used his own son to get what he wanted. Not after the war.
He made a tiny crack in the door, peering out to see if Harry was waiting silently to stun him, and possibly force Draco’s secrets out. Fortunately, he saw no sign of Harry, and the lights were off, which meant he was most likely lying in bed awake, or already asleep.
“So, throughout summer, autumn, and winter, I experimented on Snape’s book, figuring out how it worked. It was tricky, and well protected, I’ll tell you that, but nothing that was too tough for me to figure out in the end.”
Around eleven o’clock, Potter said that they should go back to the Room of Requirement, and Draco agreed. Even though he hadn’t been the one practicing magic, he still felt exhausted.
Once he passed the gargoyle, his mind completely focused on Harry, thinking of all the different places he could be.
was a little hard to wrap his head around, but crazier things had happened in the past weeks, so he figured he shouldn’t dwell on it too much now.
He swore that every last one of them, about fifteen or so students from various years, wore slightly gaping mouths and couldn’t take their eyes off of him for one second.
He glanced down at the new wrap around his forearm. No blood stain in the outline of the snake and the skull like there had been the previous days, whenever it got close to the time to change the bandage. And, according to Pomfrey, it wouldn’t happen again. It was done bleeding for good.
“Harry,” Draco breathed. The word felt so intimate, so personal, and he, Draco Malfoy, got to say it. He thought that there wasn’t a word that existed in any language that sounded as perfect as
Draco shut his curtains to his four poster. He had already cast a dozen silencing spells on them at the start of the year, so right as the curtains closed, Theo’s voice cut off.
mixed with his own grief for his mother is why I think he acts so… mean.” Harry finished, and was shifting uncomfortably.
“I couldn’t have anyone in the way of my plan, either. Potter was in Hogwarts, surrounded by people. I can’t touch him. Only people who are permitted in Hogwarts are even allowed to be around Potter, and the spell which would break Hogwarts’ wards, required the blood of someone prophesied, and had to be cut by the hand of a person close to the prophesied one; they had to mean a great, great deal or else the spell wouldn’t work.
Somehow Harry’s hands had moved from grasping at Draco’s shoulders, to hooking his arms around Draco’s neck. Before he knew it, Harry rested his head against Draco’s shoulder. His arms that were still flung around Draco’s neck began to tighten, almost as if he were holding onto dear life. Almost as if Draco was Harry’s only saving grace.
Draco also wanted to bring up his dream again, how that had happened on the same day too, but he felt it would probably lead to some sort of argument, like it had earlier that day. He also thought about his Mark, how that had somehow awoken the previous night, before he had fallen asleep and had the dream and found out everyone was under a spell. He wasn’t going to tell Potter about that, though. No way.
Harry’s eyes were blown from shock at the disruption. He was sitting back in his chair that had just threatened to tip over. Draco suppressed a laugh.
Once he had finished showering, gotten dressed, and brushed his teeth, he opened the bathroom door only to find an irritated looking Theo and Robins, sitting on Blaise’s bed. Blaise and Davis were apparently in the middle of discussing something related to ancient runes.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Pansy asked carefully. “I’m guessing it has to deal with Potter, if my eyes didn’t deceive me.”
Theo had been the first boy he had ever kissed. It was during Sixth Year, at a time when Draco was lost in his darkest thoughts, mind cloudy and in a deep trance.
Harry shook his head back and forth in disbelief. “This doesn’t make sense. It should have worked. You’re an excellent potioneer, Draco. I know you brewed it right. It must have been the book's fault.”
Now that Draco was standing in front of the wall that led to the Room of Requirement, he knew he couldn’t be brave. Potter also seemed a little tense, so at least that eased his mind a bit.
She planned parties for Wizards and Muggles alike, but of course when Muggles were involved she never let them see her using magic to do all the setting up.
Draco sputtered, and thought long and hard about what he had said to Potter while he was in the middle of yelling at the bloke. He realized he
lowered his mental shields last night before he slept. He remembered feeling flustered and detesting the world, so he had slipped out of his own wards before he slept.
“I see.” He continued to look down at his hands and she went on. “You are welcome at Hogwarts, Mr. Malfoy. I hope you know that.”
He and Harry stood there for what felt like ten minutes, keeping a close eye out for any changes, and from what they could observe, nothing happened.
His face visibly tightened. “Betrayed. Utterly, fucking, betrayed. Though I did have a lot of time to grieve the past weeks while you were in the hospital.”
“I honestly haven’t thought about it like that before. I haven’t thought about that at all. I think it’s just a bad habit I picked up from after the war. You know, always feeling the need to apologize for everything that happened, feeling sad you couldn’t have done more, even if there really was nothing else you could have done differently to help.”
His feet moved on their own accord, and before he knew it he was standing at the side of Harry’s sickeningly Gryffindor bed.
“I think this is all my fault. Why else would all this be happening? Someone’s trying to get revenge on me for killing Voldemort. The same guy in your vision-thing is most definitely the same guy who cast the sleeping curse, and put up a ward so we can’t leave or contact anyone. This is probably his sick idea of getting back at me. So, I’m sorry you were dragged into this mess with me.”
hasn’t gotten word of the real reason why the two of you broke up, seeming as every other aspect of your love life and beyond is out there for the world to read.”
It was all just so strange, everything that had occurred within the past 24 hours. First his Mark had awoken, then the weird dream-like-vision, and then finally everyone in Hogwarts mysteriously falling under some kind of sleeping spell. Now that Draco thought about it all together, it seemed silly
They would never match. Draco would have to accept that. He sort of already did, but a small, small part of him whispered in the back of his mind, “you could be friends, if you just tried.” He knew that would never be true, but that little part of him did hope.
Draco had a horrible, sickening feeling that the figure was sending some kind of message, telling Draco to
“I just- I’m just so confused! Why- how could you do this to me?” Harry said, his eyes full of flames. “After everything we’ve been through. You lied. You put us both in danger. And now we don’t have any time left to fix things. I actually was starting to believe your visions held no truth, but now that I know the Figure
Harry’s mouth fell open at the realization. “Fuck! I knew I was forgetting something.” He ran a hand through his hair, and Draco had the urge to pat it down, even though he had to admit, when Harry’s hair was extra messy, Harry was extra attractive. If that was even possible. “I’ll go run down to Potions again and-”
They hadn’t been prepared for the snow, only heading out in their winter coats; no Gryffindor or Slytherin styled accessories.
Fuck Potter. Draco didn’t need his help to save Hogwarts. He would do it on his own. He was the one who had the strange dream, the one with the angry Mark, he would save everyone on his own. He would prove to Saint Potter he was more than some ‘prejudiced Death Eater.’
“Prepare to be disappointed. No, I didn’t find it. Whatever ‘it’ is.” Harry closed his eyes, and leaned back against the stone that built up the water fountain.
“You don’t know what’s going to happen today! A dark wizard really could be coming, and you don’t want to be left alone!” Draco tried to reason with Harry.
His stomach sank and his heart raced. He was most certainly not alone, and the other presence was definitely not Harry Potter, unless he suddenly became a Slytherin in the time they had been separated, and Harry somehow got dressed in a Slytherin uniform.
because that was how he imagined the event really was in his head. But obviously Harry was doing the favor as a… friend? Maybe. A nice friendly gesture to show he was thankful for Draco’s help. Not a date in the slightest. “Never mind. Let’s go, then. Shall we?”
“Uh, thanks, but no thanks. I have to work on homework.” He knew that she could see right through the lie, it was a Friday night, he had the whole weekend to work on homework. But, she didn’t comment on it, instead she offered a good night to him and grabbed her own bag, leaving the room behind two Ravenclaws.
Draco was glad Potter had offered to check on McGonagall, he really didn’t want to talk to the Headmistress if he did not have to. “Fine. You do that. I guess I’ll check the Slytherin common room, see if anyone is awake in there.”
Draco eyed his mother nervously, silently pleading for help, but she just shook her head and made her way through the maze of people, probably heading to talk with anyone she could find.
Narcissa opened her door, and handed the driver a generous amount of money, before indicating for Draco to get out of the cab. Draco was instantly confused, but he hesitantly did what his mother wanted.
“Of course, Draco. And let me reiterate that I’m not one hundred percent certain that that is what actually happened. I’m fairly certain, yes, but you can never be so sure.”
... I hoped you enjoyed this chapter :) I'm actually really proud of this chapter, it's probably my favorite yet, even if did take me almost a month to write it.
They would have to leave soon, Draco knew, and he didn’t know when the next time they saw each other--alone--would be. And before he and Harry parted ways, Draco had to explain what had happened in the woods with Drys. Especially the part where he had been hit with the Killing Curse.
“There’s a party in Hogsmeade tonight, if you’d like to come,” Harry said to Draco. But it was obvious the invitation was also extended to Blaise.
Harry’s hand was gripping Draco’s hair tightly while his lips kept pulling and sucking on Draco’s bottom lip.
He pushed away the covers of his bed, and immediately went to the bathroom, where he splashed cold water all over his face, trying to remember and forget everything he had been told.
The air was frigid and their warming charms were wearing off. A blazing fire burned inside the Hogshead, visible through the tall windows. Draco chanced a longing look at the heat.
That it was impossible for Harry to have any thoughts other than loathing and hatred directed at Draco. That because of this reason, Draco was miserable. Harry was the reason he was miserable, despite all the good and all the progress that had come to him since the Curse.
He then wondered why exactly he was here in the first place, but remembered Drys had cast some spell over him, probably taking him to this room for some reason.
“You were all at the edge of the Forbidden Forest,” McGonagall said, “you had just started dueling with this man… everything was extremely hard to see and hear…”
Draco thought that was a very wise thing to say. He ought to remember what Potter had said so he could think back on it and use it when times got dark, and he felt something terrible was bound to come out of the genuine good moments.
No one could come inside the school grounds, unless they were invited in by the Headmistress herself.
His attempt, however, was futile, for Harry started to stretch and yawn, and then twisted over to look at Draco.
It was probably just some side effect of being Marked, that was all. All the former Death Eaters were probably feeling the same sort of pain that Draco was feeling, though it might be easier to see if his predictions were correct if another Death Eater were present, or if Draco could write a note to his father in Azkaban. Maybe what he and Potter should start working on was trying to break the barrier spell so they could send letters. Draco knew Potter would never go for that though. He would want to focus on saving the people, not saving themselves.
“It’ll be fine. No one will ever know.” Potter started walking in the direction of the Hog's Head. Draco wanted to shout after him, “Now look who’s splitting up from the other?” But he didn’t. He reluctantly followed after Potter, who was now pulling out his wand and casting a series of opening spells on the Hog’s Head front door, trying one after the other until one would allow them passage.
He set down the new bandage on the side table, he didn’t feel like putting it on his arm, even though Pomfrey told him to. He felt like he was betraying her trust, but it was such a trivial thing to do at the moment, he was sure she would forgive him if he knew what he was going through.
There was Madame Pomfrey, hurrying toward him, wand and potion bottle in hand. There were also three Aurors. One of the three was the man who had originally been standing in the room when Draco first woke up. Then there was a woman with black hair and an emotionless expression, and standing next to the woman was a short man with an unkind smile.
“I sort of look at it like this: there will always be some sort of crisis going on in our lives. Whether we like it or not. Sure, I might be scared about the future and not knowing exactly what will happen, but that’s just a part of life, I think. You just have to- live on.”
He was then escorted to the Ministry, where Drys explained to the Minister that Draco had been the one to kill the Purebloods who resided in Hogwarts, along with Harry Potter. Drys explained how he, himself, had been the one to catch Draco. The Minister thanked Drys, and threw Draco in a holding cell, awaiting a trial where it would soon be decided that Draco would be sentenced to death.
All he really wanted to do was go to the library and start researching. He now had a place to start and he was determined to work it out on his own.
Somehow, Draco had been supremely good at avoiding Harry in the halls, and a situation like this had never happened before now.
Draco shifted around to look at Harry, making sure nothing had happened to him yet; nothing had, Draco presumed. Harry was currently wide-eyed and exhausted, silently coughing.
“But I am, Harry! You don’t even know half of it.” He was back to scratching his forearm. “I can’t do this anymore,” Draco breathed.
Much to Draco’s surprise, Potter nodded his head and started to walk in the direction of the Transfigurations classroom. Draco followed him.
“You really believe that, huh. Normal,” she deadpanned. “If you take one glance around, you’ll realize how far from
Potter picked it up, and started flipping it over- front and back- countless times before handing it over to Draco. Draco opened the inside of the book to the back of the cover page, to see if someone had written anything in it, and was delightfully surprised to find someone had.
Draco’s answer was complicated. Yes, of course he would tell Potter if he had another vision while he slept. Yes, he would tell Potter if he randomly found some secret room. No, he would not, and would never tell Potter about his Mark. “Yes, Potter. I won’t hold anything back,” Draco lied. To some extent.
We had a fake, placed by Alec. Though, in an attempt to make the fake as similar to the real one, some of the spells worked. That’s how I got the letter past the barriers and to my father.”
“Well, I could tell you're stressed-” Harry ignored Draco’s noises of protests- “And I wanted to do something nice for you. So, I packed a basket full of snacks and a large blanket; we’re going to have a picnic in the Garden of Mystics.”
Previously, he had been skeptical to continue leaving his mental wards down every night when he went to bed. It took a lot of energy out of him to constantly keep up his Occlumency, but he thought he might as well not use it as he didn’t need to compartmentalize when the only other person around didn’t even know how to compartmentalize- he thought he’d level the playing field.
“Okay, I’ll tell you just because you asked so politely,” Draco deadpanned, which made Harry laugh, which made Draco smile. Damned chain reactions. “I heard about eighth year the day of my trial. My first thought was that it would be way better than just sitting at home doing nothing but sulk. My second thought was that I would never be able to get a job at all without my NEWTs. My third thought was that I absolutely despised the manor and didn’t want to stay in it any longer.”
terrible. He was probably just wandering the halls, confused out of his mind as to why the entire castle was empty, and why his roommates and House-mates were all dead asleep. It was around one in the afternoon, and even though it was a Sunday and classes wouldn’t be going on, a whole House wouldn’t just be sleeping in the middle of the day.
other visit here, I didn’t get a close up look at my book. But now, I can see clearly that someone had obviously replaced the real version with a fake.” Snape did not seem concerned about that fact
. He had not foreseen the terrible tragedy that he would have to save the no-good-somebodies who were constantly trying to make his life hell. But he had doomed himself to that fate, hadn’t he? He had joined the side of the darkest and evilest of wizards, and that was his punishment.
“You have it in you, Potter.” Draco lied. Well, Potter might have it in him somewhere. Somewhere very deep that could never be unlocked, that was.
Draco marveled at Harry. “And how do you know this? You’re the last person I would have thought would know the layout of the castle.”
Draco wasn’t exactly sure if Potter had really said anything, or if it was his mind making stuff up. They’d never said goodnight to each other before. What had changed?
“I’m thinking,” Draco started, and Harry lifted his chin while Draco turned his body so that he was completely facing Harry. “I’m thinking about you. I can’t stop thinking about you, Harry Potter.”
Ten minutes to eight o’clock, they stopped what they were doing, and looked at each other miserably. It was time to go to group therapy with the other Eighth Years. He knew Pansy hated therapy too, but not as much as Draco did. They slowly packed up their things and headed out of the common room in silence.
Harry continued, “I went to Hogwarts looking for something. Anything. Anything that would fill the emptiness inside of me and all around me. I-”
Draco hated that Mark with all his being. He hated it so much, he had tried multiple times, to no avail, to remove it. He had tried burning it, cutting it, using magic on it, but nothing worked.
Pansy was standing in front of him, and she looked plastered. He could tell from the way she was swaying profusely.
“My mother, Lily, sacrificed her life to save me,” Harry whispered, “and because of her sacrifice, when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse on me, it backfired, and left me unharmed except for my scar.” Harry’s eyes went up as if he was trying to look at the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.
Draco was about to run out the door and search the whole fucking castle for Harry bloody Potter when the entrance opened and in stepped, who could’ve guessed, Potter.
Every inch of his body was starting to burn with pain. He was also losing consciousness quickly, he knew it. He just hoped it would engulf him soon, the pain was beginning to become too much.
Draco pressed on. “But you know what I think, Drys made it so that if he died, the Death Eater’s would die alongside him on purpose. It was definitely something he could have avoided if he wanted to. He knew that if he couldn’t succeed in bringing down the Purebloods, he could at least rid the world of all the Death Eaters. That included me. Take care of one evil beyond the grave.”
Drys sneered. “I don’t trust him enough to not make a mess out of everything. I had one chance to get this done, and if he wasn’t able to become close to Potter, I would have failed. I was not planning on failing.”
He made sure to start his morning with a walk around the grounds, Blaise sometimes accompanying him. Pansy and Blaise watched him at meal times and made sure he ate a proper meal; and most of the time he did.
He had been sitting on one of the armchairs, in the Slytherin common room, in the furthest corner, when Theo approached him cautiously. Draco had snapped at him, and told him to fuck off, but Theo had stayed. He had said he knew something was up with Draco, and told him if he ever needed someone to talk to, he would be there.
“Please, just let it go. I’m-” In distress. Absolutely torn to pieces having to constantly lie to you. Carrying the weight of a lot of lives on my shoulders at the moment. Having to keep that burden to myself. Worrying that the potion we’re brewing right now is for nothing- “Okay.”
by Sunday, or everyone he cared about would die, and everyone who was asleep would stay asleep forever. He had counted on breaking the sleeping curse so the Figure couldn’t use that as leverage over himself anymore, and Draco would have warned McGonagall about everything, and she’d had made everything alright.
Draco stood back up again, mentally preparing himself for what was about to come. He didn’t even feel like looking down at Harry one last time, but Harry grabbed his hand, forcing Draco to look down into his green eyes.
Before Draco even knew what he was doing, he rushed over to Potter and swatted his hand away. Potter looked startled, and his green eyes were huge, staring right into Draco’s grey ones. “Don’t touch them, Potter. Leave them be. They’re rare flowers.”
He thought about how his life aside from Harry was so much better than before. How he finally had the confidence to walk up to both Granger and Weasley and apologize to them both. How he’d talked McGonagall into letting him take Muggle Studies even though it was already halfway through the year.
It wasn’t a proper duel. They didn’t start the proper way and do the proper set up, but Draco presumed that was because he couldn’t
Out of all of their problems right now, that one was probably the biggest and most difficult to deal with. And that said a lot. There were only two of them, in a castle filled with sleeping bodies, and no place to sleep. Potter wouldn’t allow them to split up, he said it wasn’t safe to be alone, since now they were both pretty sure someone had intentionally cast a sleeping curse and trapped them so they couldn’t go farther than Hogsmeade and contact the outside world. It
Everyone agreed with Drys that it was time to take a stand against the Purebloods, and Drys didn’t even have to
Alec Kaspian was a confusing bloke. He was brainless and malevolent, yet charming and attractive. Though the brainless and malevolent part far out-weighted the other part. He was usually seen around Potter, they had evidently become close friends this year. But, Draco was skeptical that Potter actually liked Kaspian.
His arm was sending bolts of pain throughout his body, and it took a large amount of energy out of him to not cut off the dreadful tattoo, and if that wouldn’t work, yank off his entire arm.
He realized, solemnly, that he only had one option left, and that was to talk to Harry. Tell him everything he had lied about, and hope Harry could come up with a solution as quickly as possible.
As he was about to slip into his Slytherin green covers, he thought he heard Harry whisper his name. However, he was tired, and most certainly imagining it. Harry was mad at him and wouldn’t be calling him
Finally, after about five minutes, Harry called out for Draco, and he hopped off the sink, hastily opening the door to see what Harry had been up to.
. Possibly the last thing he wanted to talk about with McGonagall. And, honestly, he couldn’t care less about the special terms and conditions.
He hadn’t been sure, before, that Harry liked him, or even loved him, for that matter. But surely, Harry felt whole when he was with Draco. Harry always laughed when he was with Draco. He laughed, he smiled, he danced, he ran through the halls of Hogwarts when he was with Draco.
Thank you SO MUCH to everyone for reading. I really do hope almost everything was cleared up in this chapter. It was so fun to write, but I was (and am) constantly worried I wasn't explaining everything well enough or that the "end" wasn't going to be as good as everyone expected it to be.
He closed the door behind him, and instantly regretted walking outside. It was still windy, the wind moving around the snow, making almost nothing visible. But, he could luckily make out a small structure farther down the lawn, a structure Draco was familiar with; a pavilion.
The radio was placed on the edge of the water fountain, and Harry let go of Draco’s hand to go fiddle with the buttons again.
that came from the other side of the library. Potter was frozen in place as his line of sight went to the far corner. The corner was now surrounded in smoke, and the smell of burnt wood traveled over to Draco.
Even though he had specifically told himself he wouldn’t let himself fall to the ground, he fell to the ground. He hit his head painfully on the brick wall behind him, which made the excruciating pain that was already starting to overtake his whole body, so much worse.
He let out a small sigh. “To be honest, no, I don’t want to eat in the Great Hall. But, doing so will hopefully make things return back to normal in a quick manner.”
“Last time,” meant that that was because he’d told Pomfrey he was officially leaving the Wing today, right before dinner was served in the Great Hall.
They both went back to staring up at the stars. It was a truly beautiful sight. Draco was lucky to have experienced so many wonderful moments with Harry over the past two weeks. He had thought running through the halls was all the fun he’d get to have with no one else around. But then they both danced in the Garden with each other. And now, they were stargazing, and lying in the freezing snow next to each other. He wondered if he would have another memorable experience sometime in the near future. He really, really hoped so.
Drys was standing directly over him now, and Draco realized he had lost the duel. He had lost, which meant there was no chance of bargaining their lives now. Harry would die. Draco would be forced to watch him die, along with numerous other innocent lives. He would be condemned to think about how he had failed everyone.
He wanted to spill everything to Harry, to talk about his burning Mark and the letter he sent his father, but he couldn’t yet. When everything was figured out, maybe, just maybe, he would. For now he had to make sure their Restorative Potion was perfectly brewed, so he could prove the figure wrong, and wake everyone up. If everyone was awake, the figure would have no leverage over Draco, and everything would be solved.
He was positive Pansy was up to some evil scheme, like she usually was. Probably busy turning his house into a club or an open mic night for his birthday. He would kill her if she was.
“Ha. I doubt I’ll be able to find a job at all. Though, hopefully, with my NEWTs, at most one person will offer me some kind of job opportunity. I honestly don’t care what it is, as long as I can get some sort of payment.”
Harry moved his body closer to Draco, looking intently at Draco’s careful pouring. “That sounds good.”
“Well, you still had the idea.” Draco walked closer to Harry, lightly touching the box-contraption with different sized knobs and gadgets attached. “What is this thing?”
But, when the hood was completely off, and the man’s face was perfectly visible, Draco realized he had no idea who the man standing before him was.
. She did kiss me once, but that’s a story for a different time. No, I never had a boyfriend. I did kiss Theo though, in sixth year. That did not end well,” Draco grimaced. “Don’t ever tell anyone about Theo.”
There was a green and black tie with the snake emblem attached, lying near the stone wall. He wouldn’t have been able to see it was not for the light coming out of his wand.
He ran a hand through his hair, walking out of Slytherin and into the halls of the dungeons. It was sort of weird, the fact that he was hoping someone else would have been awake, so that he wouldn’t have to be alone with Potter, and at the same time he was hoping no one else
“How are you, Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall asked. Even though Draco was terrified of her, she was without a doubt one of the nicest people in the world, especially to him; especially after the war.
charm, only to see that the time was thirty minutes until midnight. He was expecting it to be morning. He didn’t usually fall asleep at random intervals during the day, that was more Pansy’s style.
He was going to use the spell the book had given, Obice Confractus, to charm a single letter, allowing it passage through the ward, messaging his father in Azkaban, asking if Lucius’ Mark had started moving too.
Anyone could have seen his battered, destroyed Dark Mark (that, despite all the scars, was still visible). He still had on the bandage wrap that Pomfrey had given him, but his mind supplied to him the worst possibilities:
The problem was, Draco didn’t know which one to take. He wished he could have both, but that would be completely selfish, and Draco was working on fixing that. “I think i’ll take the first one.”
“I just wanted to give a proper goodbye, before the Aurors come and snatch me up,” Narcissa responded lightly, putting one arm around his shoulders.
Potter stopped walking, and stood facing the side of the path they were walking on. Draco automatically saw why he had stopped and what he was looking at. There was a patch of bright yellow flowers, sparkling in Potter’s wand light. Draco recognized them as Anemonlea, a rare type of flower that only blossomed in the winter. He knew it was quite difficult to actually spot them, for they usually bloomed far away from the human population.
He sat against the farthest wall of the tower, his mind replaying the scene when he’d held Dumbledore at wandpoint on repeat. After a while, it got tiring, but no less sickening. He watched Snape use the killing curse, and watched himself freeze in absolute fear, and the dawning realization that
Draco made a quick glance at Pansy and his mum, and saw that they were already leaving the room. His mum’s personal Auror following right behind. It was something he had asked them to do the first time he had been awake to witness the healing of his Mark that occurred every day before dinner.
curse Potter had cast at him during Sixth Year. The effects of that curse, clearly visible on his face.
sort of looks they’d present. Pansy told him that the whole school knew of the sleeping curse. The whole Wizarding World knew, basically. All the details they knew, though, were that Harry and Draco had been the only ones awake during the crisis, and had somehow woken everyone up.
Draco stuck his nose up in the air, turning his head away; however, it was just for show. He wasn’t really upset with Harry. He wanted to annoy him in a good-natured way. “It’s none of your business.”
Harry’s face softened even more, but at the same time, he still seemed angry and upset. He didn’t say anything, though. He was obviously waiting for Draco to speak first.
Dumbledore could very likely be under the same sleeping curse as everyone else, since all of the other portraits he and Potter passed were sound asleep in their frames, so he knew he might not have to worry about seeing Dumbledore at all. But if Dumbledore was under the curse that meant Snape was too, and they wouldn’t be able to ask him about the book they had found. Draco didn’t know which situation was worse; seeing and talking to the man he had almost killed, or finding that same man, along with Draco’s former mentor asleep, providing no information on the mysterious book.
Draco took a long look at Harry and let out a humorless laugh. “I’m not exactly confused… it’s just a lot to process. You’re the first to mention all of this stuff, too. No one told me anything regarding Alec or Drys in the Hospital Wing. And Pansy had to catch me up on basically every other aspect earlier today.”
“So, you see, Drys showed me what the future would be like if I didn’t join him and if I did join him. Long story short, both were horrible options. But, I was inclined to choose one.” He didn’t go into all the details, just gave her enough information so that she could follow along and understand what he was saying. He purposefully told her he felt this strong tug throughout his
Snape was right, he only needed a counter-curse for two things. He wouldn’t need more than three, but he was still a bit irritated at the limitations. “You’re right. I’m sorry,” He said. “Thank you for your answers.”
Draco glanced around the library, looking for any lingering students, and wasn’t surprised to find no one at all. Everyone was either outside, enjoying the setting summer sun, or eating a delicious dinner in the Great Hall. No one save for Draco would be working on school work the night before their last day of classes.
He stopped his trudge towards the stairs that led to the boy’s dormitory and looked up and around the common room, trying to spot her and trying to seem inconspicuous at the same time. He found her standing at the back of the room behind a large mountain of books--which made the top of her head only visible--waving her hand like a crazy person and not being quiet enough while ‘whispering’ his name.
He felt like he had just run a race. He felt tired, sweaty, and he was breathing ridiculously hard, all at the same time.
A group of people stepped into the room. About six students. He recognized Zacharias Smith, who was leading the group, Theo, Calder Robins, and Justin Finch-Fletchley who were standing directly behind Smith, and towards the back of the group was a girl in Ravenclaw named Mandy Brocklehurst, and of course, Alec Kaspian.
Draco still found it weird that Harry was the one constantly apologizing. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he apologized to Harry, and he, without a doubt, had way more shit he needed to apologize for than the Gryffindor did. Draco wanted to apologize for everything, but he could never find the right moment, or the right words to start the conversation.
Potter stopped a couple feet ahead of him, and noticed Draco was no longer with him. He turned around and spotted Draco, frowning as he walked closer. “Malfoy, what’s wrong?”
Once Draco turned around, he immediately caught Theo’s glaring eye on the opposite side of the room, and froze. Calder Robins was standing beside him, too.
Pushing his wand into his robe, Draco reached for the next object; the photograph he had kept with him from the night of their first, and only, kiss. The Muggle photograph of the two of them in the snow, a candid moment forever frozen in time.
Harry went on, “I think I want to be some kind of teacher. I haven’t thought about it thoroughly, but I like the idea of helping and teaching kids.”
“Well, there could still be someone else. Everyplace was locked. Someone could very well be inside enjoying the peace and quiet without even knowing there’s a crisis going on.”
They had spent the rest of the day in the library searching book after book, sitting at the same table in the same spot, and Draco could tell Potter had been getting more restless as time went on and they still hadn’t found anything. He wanted to insure Potter that it would be fine, they still had plenty more days to search until the two weeks were up. But he didn’t say anything. Now thinking back on it, he wished he had.
Harry shook his head in exasperation. “It was always slightly suspicious how Alec could do all of these amazing spells, spells I’d never heard a whisper of. I never thought twice about where his father had learned them.”
now. And best of all, he felt he could finally enjoy his new life at Hogwarts, finally embrace the fact that he was given a second chance by the entire school, something he had wanted for so very long.
“Anyyywayy,” Harry mused. “I believe it is time for you to have your first listen to songs on a Muggle radio.”
A thread had been tied and knotted between them both, and then the thread had been severed. Draco desperately hoped to tie it back together again, even if it would never be the exact same.
He rested his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry looked at him with concerned eyes. Concerned eyes for
The world was extremely fuzzy when Draco attempted to open his eyes again. He didn’t know how long he’d been laying on the cold floor, but it seemed like a good amount of time had passed.
The future wasn’t certain, but he knew one thing that was. For Harry was right there in front of him, and Draco would never let go.
Attached to the parchment Azkaban had surely provided, there was another letter there; Draco’s letter, the one he had originally written and sent his father. He quickly stuffed the letter he had written into his pocket, and quickly unfolded the response he had received. All that was written in sloppy cursive was one word:
“I just don’t understand how it didn’t work. It should have worked. Something must be wrong with the book. Give it-” Draco reached out for the book, attempting to snatch it from Potter’s tight grip, but he wasn’t fast enough, and Potter pulled the book away and out of Draco’s reach.
together without watching all of his memories throughout the two weeks, he was terrified that they would judge him harshly based on the mistakes he’d made that were voiced aloud by Drys and himself.
“Thank you, Harry.” He felt a hint of tears forming in his eyes. He didn’t even think crying was possible again, considering how much he’d cried earlier. “Thank you, so much.”
What appeared as a simple spell used to revive people badly wounded, could be turned into a spell to
Draco started to close his own eyes as his heart started to beat in an inhuman rhythm. Salazar, Harry’s breath on his lips did something to his insides. He needed to fill the minuscule gap between them
Everything was, to say the least, different… between him and Harry, after their night spent dancing.
He almost started laughing to himself as he realized he’d been standing there thinking about wind and sunlight, when Harry was clearly in awe at the Garden as a whole.
“Draco, hey.” Harry’s voice was now a whisper too. He tugged at Draco’s hand slightly. “Hey. Look at me.
Draco had felt like they were having a moment, just then. A special moment. But, in that moment, he realized one of the reasons he couldn’t breathe was because Harry had been pressed against him so hard he’d been suffocating slightly.
Draco was nervous to hear Harry’s answer, but knew that it was something he needed to have knowledge of. No one had told him, or had been able to tell him, exactly all the details about what went down after Draco had killed Drys.
“Is Harry still bothering you?” Pansy said at lunch on Monday, the second Monday he’d been back to attending classes; after he had eaten dinner with Harry in the kitchen, had almost kissed him.
He hadn’t even noticed Madame Pomfrey fussing over him from the other side of his bed, checking his vitals. She pushed a potion vial to his lips once he and his mother were done with their quick little chat, and he felt it go down his throat; feeling sleepy and less achy already.
Harry started to take small steps toward Hogwarts’ entrance. Draco panicked and rushed in front of him, blocking his way.
“Yeah? Everything okay?” Harry asked, looking up from his wand, which had been twirling in his hand.
“Harry?” Draco called out. He turned in his spot, his wand shining light throughout the corridor. “Harry, if you’re there, please come out. You don’t even have to talk to me, and I don’t have to talk to you if you’d rather me be silent, but I don’t want to be alone, and I’m sure you don’t either and-” he was making matters worse, he knew it. But he was scared. He was scared out of his mind. He hated being alone, it really was the truth.
“Uh, also, Madame Pomfrey, I think he’d want me to tell you this, but I think he’s uh- rather… self-conscious… about his arm. He looked pretty shaken when I saw it and I don’t think he’d want any one other than you to see…”
“That’s what I’m trying to say. There is literally no one else around. You're the first person I’ve seen up and awake.”
In therapy with Elizabeth he brought these thoughts up, and she did help, truly, but there were some things even she couldn’t work out completely.
remember how Draco openly said terrible things about what the former headmaster believed in and supported, and of course how Draco had almost fucking murdered him, right?
Now that Harry was right in front of him, eyes gleaming and face blushed, Draco was speechless. Honestly, there was just too much to say, and Draco couldn’t possibly know where to start.
Drys gave him another withering smile. “Shameful. I really did offer you such a good deal. I gave you a week to think about it, too.” He took out his wand. “Now, come here.”
The stars never failed to stop twinkling, and the constellations they made never failed to be less mesmerizing. Harry was like the night sky. Twinkly and bright, mesmerizing in every aspect; the good and the bad, his perfections and his imperfections.
Before he even registered what he was doing, the metal object- which he now identified as a blade- began cutting through Harry’s forearm. There was so much blood, and Draco knew he would have been sick from the sight had it not been that his worries had mysteriously left him.
“I just needed to tell you some things, about what exactly went down with Drys, and what he had said.”
Draco crossed his arms tighter around him and looked Potter dead in the eye. “I woke up, and you were gone.” His voice sounded quiet and small, and he hated how it had come out like that.
“So, do you want to take a photo? You know, to save this moment forever?” Harry asked, his face scrunched in confusion at Draco’s tense posture.
and go rant to Pansy about what happened. A deeper instinct told him now was the time. The time to explain things and set everything right between the two of them. He’d already waited way too long.
“Trust me, it wasn’t intentional. I was on my way to see if you were awake, and I ran into them on the stairs. Granger asked me if I was on my way to see you, so I told her yes, and she said she would come too,” She explained.
Draco was about to start seeking for a new book on the shelves of the library, and maybe try to break into the restricted section, when Potter spoke once again.
The Auror woman moved closer to her shorter colleague, and Draco got to see who else had entered the room, hidden behind the woman. It was his mother.
Potter uncrossed his arms, raking both hands through his unruly hair. “When I woke up this morning, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all asleep-”
cold-hearted. I’m sure he wasn’t always like that, but when Olive died during the war… everything changed.”
to talk to Potter, but because of circumstances he could not control, he now had to speak to the annoying git routinely.
She lightly touched his chest and Draco groaned in agony from the contact. She jerked her hand back, realizing she had just hurt him.
“Yes, Miss Granger. He might not have been if you would have arrived minutes later, but I can assure you he will be just fine.”
As Draco watched Potter lazily stare at the pages of the book in front of him, he realized he needed to do something other than research counter-curses that weren’t getting them anywhere.
Potter slowly blinked at him and openly gaped. It was like Potter was seeing Draco for the first time in a long while.
charm, only to see that he had a minute to spare before class started. He would never make it on time. He was on the seventh floor. Transfigurations was far from where he was now.
Draco didn’t really need as much of a ‘reward’ as Harry did, considering how every time Harry practiced, he sat on his arse reading books. But, he did like the idea of spending every night before he had to brew the potion, in the Garden of Mystics, alone with only Harry’s company.
his Mark. His eyes felt prickly with tears, not that he would cry, and he noticed his hands were shaking. He tried grabbing a handful of blankets to stop the shaking, but even that didn’t help.
“I hardly think that if I pushed you into the water fountain, you would die. You’re being just a tad overdramatic, you git.” Draco nudged his shoulder to Harry’s.
Draco wasn’t sure what to do. His hands floated awkwardly behind Harry’s back, unsure as to whether he should embrace Harry in front of their friends, and quite possibly people who had stopped to witness the encounter.
After he realized he’d been awkwardly eyeing his side table, he snapped out of the trance and sighed.
Potter was now serving himself a nice sized Butterbeer, foam spilling out over the top of the glass. He made a glass for Draco too, which made him surprised at the kind gesture. He could have figured out how to serve himself a glass of Butterbeer surely, and Potter must have known he was capable, so why was Potter being purposefully
The Death Eater’s all looked at each other, and Draco sensed that they were all smiling under their masks. “If you insist,” the leader said.
The words that came out of his mouth instead of, “I don’t want to dance,” were much more frightening, and once Draco spoke, he couldn’t take the words back or cover them up with something else. “Harry, are we friends?”
As they made their way to Slughorn’s classroom, Draco noticed something different about Potter. He hoped it wasn’t related to the secret he’d told Draco, because it really did not bother him; Potter’s confession hit close to home for him and he would never judge Potter for crying in front of him. He would be a hypocrite if he did. But no, he seemed timid, almost. He was obviously lost in thought as they walked the empty halls, and Draco was immensely curious as to what he was thinking about.
He finally decided what he would do, and hoped beyond hope that it truly wouldn’t lead to worse consequences.
It had been late at night, and Draco had been walking around the corridors by himself, because he just needed to clear his head, and the group of Sixth Years appeared out of nowhere. They had apparently been a part of a group of students Draco had reluctantly tortured during his Seventh Year, and were looking for revenge. He thought he maybe remembered their faces, but Seventh Year was honestly a massive blur for him. He tried to forget as much as possible, but somethings could never be forgotten.
He hadn’t heard back from his father about whether or not Lucius’ Mark had come alive again too, and he hoped his father would answer back before Sunday, that was, if he was awake.
awake because everyone hated him and would surely blame whatever happened to Hogwarts’ occupants on him.
Harry had nothing else to say, and instead headed over to a small elf who was ordering others around.
“I’ve actually figured out, though, because of you, that if I want people to actually see I’ve changed and don’t support all that Pureblood prejudice shit, I have to
Continuing to look at Harry, Harry who was filled with goodness and strength, was not an option. Draco needed to get away from everything, and that included Harry, too.
Weasley nudged Potter’s shoulder, and that seemed to shake him out of his trance. Potter turned to Weasley, and said something to him that was apparently hilarious, because Weasley burst out laughing.
“So you’re telling me, we had a map to this entire school, a map that would let us see if anyone else was moving around, and instead we traveled the school daily, checking for people?” Draco was incredulous.
him and Harry. Draco was certain he was a goner, the stone was flying so fast directly towards his face, and he was frozen in fear, not moving at all.
The door to Draco’s room was opened; he had left it that way the last time he had entered the dorm to see if anyone had woken up, and he walked determinedly towards Theo’s four-poster, Harry still following his lead.
“No!” Draco said a little more harshly than intended. He supposed he was just agitated. He really wanted to test the potion out as soon as possible so the Figure wouldn't have leverage over him any longer. “Sorry. I just mean- we’ll return it later. It’s not important. We should test out the Restorative Potion.”
Eventually, he spoke. “I'm a murderer too, you know.” His tone wasn’t angry, accusing, pitying, or anything in between. Just a sort of sad, reminiscing one.
Draco’s head snapped up to look at Harry. “What are you doing here?” Draco asked, even though it was a foolish question.
Harry snorted, which made Draco blush. “Yeah of course.” The song immediately started playing again, and Harry started to dance, beginning with slow arm and head movements moving to the beat. As the song progressed, Draco realized he’d been staring at Harry the entire time, standing still and doing nothing but blush and blush and
“Salazar, Pansy, I didn’t know you cared about me that much,” Draco said with a slight smirk forming.
“I needed Harry’s blood because, like I said, he is one of the only known prophesied wizards- which I found out from Snape’s book. I needed his blood to break the wards of Hogwarts to let in all of my new friends, and well, his blood is precious. I’m sure I can use it for many more spells.
Once they left the room, and it was just Madame Pomfrey and himself, Pomfrey began to unwrap the old bandage wrap, and dab it with some healing salve. Draco never looked at what she did, but he could feel it and guess.
“I’ve had trouble, over these past few weeks, dealing with everything that happened. My dad, Drys, the Curse in general. I also can’t help but admit I didn’t want you to be friends with a murderer. Someone who made mistake after mistake; who apparently didn’t learn from the war. I talked to Elizabeth, sure, but I should have confided in you, and I realize that now. You know me better than anyone.
Using Drys’ journal, which held instructions on how he and Olive created the Garden of Mystics, Draco and Harry had been able to replicate it, adding on their own touches and magical signatures.
“McGonagall told me to come and find you. She wants to see you in her office as soon as possible,” Pansy said.
He was too afraid to meet Harry’s eyes at the moment, so he picked up the second to last item. It was the necklace with the red gem attached. Draco’s hand instinctively flew to his throat, where he’d just always thought it would be. But now that the necklace was in his palm, the weightlessness he’d just noticed around his throat felt bare and cold.
written at the top. It was written in his handwriting, for sure, which made Draco even more confused. He couldn’t even remember the last time a written assignment was assigned for Potions. Well, there was work they had to do outside of class, but the parchment that he was currently observing had a very official sort of look to it.
“You’re going to be just fine. I’ll get us out of this.” He didn’t know if he was trying to reassure Harry, or himself.
He looked to his side, acknowledging Harry’s presence next to him. He must have given off a worried look- or maybe his whole aura was filled with anxiety- because Harry lifted his hand to rest on Draco’s shoulder, giving him a reassuring squeeze.
“Why hello everyone!” Came a voice from the door. Everyone shifted around in their seats to look at Elizabeth, who was their group therapist. She was tall and slim, and very pretty. “I trust everyone had a good week?” Several students nodded their heads, Draco did not.
She finally turned to him. She was wearing bright red lipstick and dark eyeshadow. Her short dark hair styled perfectly. She honestly looked like the epitome of a stripper. Not that she
“You had a concussion, a few cracked ribs, and multiple chest injuries-” Draco took a sharp breath at the diagnosis- “but I have healed them all. Do not worry. What you need now is rest.”
He thought of how Draco had saved Harry’s life in Malfoy Manor, and how Harry had saved Draco’s life in the Fiendfyre. He could conjure up thousands of memories between them, good and bad (mostly bad), and yet he still could not figure out what had led him to care for the tosser.
” Draco said helplessly. “I spent all of sixth year fighting my task of killing Dumbledore. In the end I didn’t kill him, and I told myself I would rather die than plot someones murder ever again. It’s just weird, no matter how evil Drys was, that after all that time agonizing over the task
“Oh. Okay,” Draco said. So they hadn’t seen their kiss, or anything remotely intimate, Draco thought- which was the only good news he’d heard so far.
Harry traced Draco’s scar that cut across his face with his fingers, lips, and tongue, and Draco eventually had enough teasing and forcefully brought Harry’s lips back to meet his own.
But what was he doing instead of patrolling? He was sitting at the top of the Astronomy Tower. Moping in misery.
“Uhm- well a group of students…” He looked down at his hands, which were folded tightly together in his lap. It was just so
Harry moved in front of him, and now Harry was spinning. “Draco. Draco? What’s wrong? You look sick.” Harry’s hands were now gripping his shoulders, and Draco was glad. He didn’t think he could stand on his own. “Can you hear me? Draco. Draco! Please, you’re scaring me.”
In the distance he heard Harry casting away, making noises of joy whenever he did something correct, and immense groaning when he couldn’t get a spell to work. He snickered to himself, shaking his head at how much fucking
” Draco said, and he knew he was pouting. However, he couldn’t bring himself to care. He enjoyed these little jabs he and Harry threw at each other. It brought back that little tugging of his heart and pit in his stomach feeling that he loathed but loved simultaneously.
He nodded his head towards Snape, and was about to turn and make his way out of the office and down to where he hoped Potter was still standing when he heard Dumbledore’s voice echo throughout the room. “Draco, it is good to see you.” His eyes sparkled from behind his half-moon glasses. Draco had always wondered how his eyes did that. He still wondered to this moment.
Harry was okay, not that Draco cared. A couple of Death Eaters were holding him captive, and when they were done with Hogwarts, Harry would be kept in the Manor’s dungeon.
rather than mope around in their makeshift bedroom. He didn’t know what that something would be, but he’d find it out.
“So, what should we do when we’re back inside?” Potter asked as they turned themselves around and started making their way back to Hogwarts.
“Night, Draco,” Pansy said over a yawn. She then proceeded to stumble towards the Slytherin girls dormitories.
“On my way to continue my search for you, Drys sent me a vision and told me to meet you at the edge of the forest.”
After the second slow song played through, the music stopped entirely, but the two of them kept on swaying, clutching onto each other like the world was ending, crumbling into pieces, and holding onto each other made staying alive so much easier.
He remembered how they both hadn’t had as bad of dreams when they slept next to each other. How Harry’s presence was so much more than comforting.
Harry stopped moving for a second, and then recomposed himself and stood up, holding out a hand for Draco to take.
“I had thought the tie belonged to Theo, you see. I thought Theo was a part of the Figure’s plan somehow, and I thought he had possibly done something to hurt you. But, it was Alec all along. After he took you out and brought you to Drys, he was going to do the same to me. But, I heard him under whatever fancy untraceable Disillusionment Charms he placed, and I wanted to find out who was making the noises.
Draco tried not to focus on Kaspian, and instead busied himself with finishing measuring and pouring the knotgrass in the potion. He could already sense that this conversation was going to take a wrong turn.
Harry was blushing, and it was plainly obvious the red color darkening his cheeks wasn’t due to the cold.
They made their way towards the dungeons, and Draco wondered what would happen to the stairs they had turned into a slide, along with the wall that now had a chunk of stone carved out of it.
“What? Of course you have! Or else he wouldn’t be lying at the edge of the forest, not responding to anything I do or say!”
Draco knew he would have to leave the Hospital soon. He knew that if he stayed another week, or even another day, it would turn into a bigger mess, and he would end up never leaving his hospital bed.
Draco didn’t get to watch his own memories, only the Aurors and McGonagall did. He sat in his hospital bed as Pansy talked to him about whatever. He wasn’t really listening.
“So,” Potter coughed. “Hermione usually scolds me when I eat too much treacle tart. So around her I only have one or two. But sometimes when she isn’t looking, I grab extra. Or I go to the kitchens and the house elves give me some more.”
On top of Potter being upset with him for squandering their Thursday, he knew the other boy was perturbed that Thursday morning Draco had specifically told Potter he wouldn’t keep secrets from him, and then that same day Draco had made very clear he hadn’t wanted to reveal a meaningful secret to Snape’s book. He was sure that made Potter collect doubt that Draco wasn’t keeping anything to himself. The doubt was rightfully placed, since Draco
Draco had no idea what Drys was talking about. What had he done in the time span of retrieving Harry’s blood? What was Draco missing?
He threw back the covers, not caring how messy his bed looked, and made a cool and collected stride to Harry’s bed, carefully trying to not trip over anything in the dark and make a fool of himself. It wasn’t like Harry could really see him, especially without glasses, but the thought was humiliating enough.
He needed Harry. He wondered why he wasn’t here in place of Pansy- not that he didn’t want Pansy’s company.
“And now we match,” he observed, and then started to touch the scar created by a curse that had meant to kill him twice.
“You’ve said that at least a million times now, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes and continued looking at his designated shelf. At this point he thought it was simply just gone. And that they’d wasted their time looking.
“Can I talk to you about something kind of personal?” Draco asked carefully half way through their session.
He wasn’t ashamed of who he was. He had accepted himself a long time ago, and it felt silly to dwell on the matter of who he chose to love. He knew his father would never accept him, but his mother might. He hoped his mother would. He technically still could produce an heir, it would be extremely complicated, but it could happen, and he would get to marry a man.
When they had left the Room of Requirement that morning, Potter suggested they should check their common rooms to see if anyone was awake. Draco knew Potter was being far too optimistic, but he told him yes, to ease Potter’s mind a bit. He was also trying to be nice. That was what nice people did, right? They sometimes agreed to other people’s suggestions, even when they were stupid.
Dumbledore and Snape were staring at him. He tried to ignore them, but it was incredibly hard. Dumbledore wore that God awful smile that secretly comforted Draco. Snape, well, he looked down at Draco like he was an old friend.
“You know how I was in the Hospital Wing before the Curse started?” Draco prompted, proud of himself for being brave enough to talk about this.
“I keep on thinking I’m going to wake up any moment now, and It’ll all be a dream,” Draco mumbled. “A really, really good dream.”
The simplest answer would have been Harry. Harry was making him dreadfully unhappy. And, quite frankly he was. Harry was annoying as ever, trying to get Draco’s attention and talk to him any chance he could get, giving him all sorts of looks, just over all making Draco’s life frustrating. But that was the simple answer.
The rain seemed to intensify as the silence between them grew. Harry was starting to lose his tender look, something like hurtful realization replacing his soft eyes. Thunder made a sickening sound in the background.
. No matter what you did that evening with Drys, no matter how intentional or unintentional, I’m pretty sure it all cancels out.”
Potter apparently had a nightmare that very night though, while Draco had slept soundly. He hadn’t woken Draco up, and Potter never exactly told him he’d had one, but Draco assumed as much due to Potter’s shaky and closed off composure as he got ready for the day.
Draco continued to stand with his arms crossed in the middle of the hall. Unlike Potter, he wouldn’t lose his cool. “Same thing happened to me when I went to check on Pomfrey. She was asleep in her bed, or what I suppose is sleeping, and when I tried to wake her she just wouldn’t budge.”
He found his way back to where Potter had said to meet, and Potter was already there, sitting on the bottom step once again. He was fidgeting with his robes, and breathing sharply. When he finally noticed Draco’s company, he stopped his nervous movements, trying very poorly to hide his tense composure.
Draco stilled, taking in Harry’s words. Draco hadn’t apologized to anyone, besides Harry, and there Harry was, the hero of the war, apologizing to quite literally every person he ran into, for… what? Saving the world? And what has
“You can’t say I’m wrong, though,” Draco said. He’d earned a lot more courage as their conversation progressed.
Draco hadn’t known he was kicking up snow, but now that Potter had said something, he intentionally made sure his shoes were flinging Potter with snow.
His silent tears turned into shaky sobs, and Harry pulled him close. He pulled Draco so close and held him so tight, that Draco cried some more just because of the sheer closeness. Something he had wanted for so long was this nearness, and he hated that he got it now, all because he was crying. It felt wrong. Forced.
“You’re quite welcome.” The faint smile that had been replaced with annoyance was now back on Snape’s face, and Draco was glad of it.
In truth, Draco had been scared. However, he’d learned over the past however many days that being scared and accepting it was okay- human even. He didn't know the exact reason why he’d always been scared of his mother since the war, but deep down that feeling had always been there. And it was less that Draco was scared
“I- I invaded your privacy, Draco! I was just worried about you, though. I thought something was wrong. I thought you were hurting yourself.”
, Draco screamed at the figure: “Show your face. SHOW YOUR FACE YOU COWARD!” Which did not do any wonders to his already charred throat.
At first he felt disgusted with himself. He wanted to cover himself up and not let anyone see him the way he was. But he also felt content. Somehow, someway, deep down inside of him, he felt
He wondered that if Harry could hear the intrusive thoughts piling inside his mind, would Harry run as far away from Draco as he could get? Would he not want to sleep in the same room as him? Would Harry not even take a chance at becoming his friend if he could hear all the horrible thoughts entering Draco’s brain?
He could barely look anyone in the eye anymore, because he was officially a murderer. A cold blooded killer. Someone who he had thought he would never turn into.
He sat on the ground for a minute, collecting his breath and thoughts, before he managed to stand up and speed walk down different corridors he didn’t recognize. His right foot was now throbbing, but he didn’t seem to notice it as much as he noticed his forearm stinging, and the ringing that was attempting to swallow him whole.
Harry contemplated what Draco had said, and for half a second, Draco thought that Harry might forgive him. “But how am I supposed to know that you won't change your mind about slicing my skin, bringing my blood to another dark wizard to save yourself, huh? Any sane person would get as far away from you as possible. So, that’s what I’m doing. Leaving.” Harry pushed past Draco, now walking out in the rain.
Harry was so sickeningly sweet and sincere, Draco couldn’t fathom how he had gotten to this point in his life where Harry bloody Potter was offering him emotional help.
Now, he tried to surround himself with the warmth and happiness he got when thinking of that memory. It helped keep himself calm and grounded when he thought of joyful moments.
Being a Gryffindor was in fact not something he was good at. He’d always hated the idea of being associated with Gryffindor in any way, but now he longed to have courage. He was starting to get the idea that he could never be anything but a coward.
“Are you even hearing yourself speak right now? That doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t even know we were going to be working in pairs today.”
Once they reached the Hogshead, Draco turned to sneer at the two of them, not for the first time in the last thirty minutes, and crossed his arms defiantly for good measure.
He walked in deeper, and came across a slightly broken body length mirror. There was one piece that was missing in the top right corner. He stuck out his hand to touch the area that was missing, when he
He then saw Harry’s gaze move to the skin right above Draco’s heart, where a new scar lay. A lightning bolt to perfectly match Harry’s, right where the Killing Curse had struck him.
he had to wait inside the bathroom. But after a minute of arguing, Draco finally gave a dramatic sigh and went and sat on the edge of the sink. He didn’t want to waste any more time.
Drys casted a spell that was much more powerful than the one’s he’d been sending before. Draco’s shield almost faltered.
Draco returned his attention to Theo, and leaned down closer to his face, Harry’s hand still resting on his shoulder, now gripping the fabric of his robes in anticipation.
Today was Draco Malfoy’s birthday; her best friend. Sure, he was a prick, but she loved him anyway. They’d been friends for about thirty five years now, and if that number didn’t show dedication, she didn’t know what would.
“That’s not the main reason I don’t want to go. You know what I did to Rosmerta. I can’t show my face in her pub. I just can’t. Plus, you know everyone would not enjoy my presence there, so really, why did you ask me?”
Draco was speechless. The gem obviously meant a great deal to Harry, and he was giving it to Draco. It was still hard to process the fact that Harry considered Draco a friend, and that Harry actually cared for Draco.
Draco, still holding onto his recklessness from the night, moved closer to Harry and draped his arm around him. Looking up to see Harry’s expression, Draco saw that he was smiling fondly, still tired yet glad to cuddle.
!” To which Draco had instantaneously flushed and told her to shush or people might overhear and get the wrong idea. Draco had been looking at Potter because he was angry at him, and rightfully so. He most certainly wasn’t looking at his arse. What the fuck Pansy?
“You have ruined my life,” Harry gave Draco a meaningful look. “You’ve ruined my life in the best possible way.” He took Draco’s hand once again. “When I’m back to my
“This morning, I woke up, and you were sort of clutching your arm in your sleep.” Harry didn’t have to say which arm he was referring too. “I needed to know if you were harming yourself, so I could help you. I care about you so much, and I had to know if I was just imagining things or if there really was something going on that you were trying to hide from me. Something that was serious and something you needed to see professional help for.”
Once he started crying, he found he couldn’t stop. So, he stopped trying to prevent the tears, and he let everything become blurry and disoriented, he let his carefully shelved thoughts run free.
Draco ached to take Harry’s hand at the moment. It was mere inches away from his, and he thought it would make Harry feel better to have someone to hold on to as he described what happened. It would certainly make Draco feel better; having to hear about his own death.
“Nothing. It was nothing. Nothing happened, and I’m not shaken up. This is just my normal look.” He tried to sound casual, but he knew his voice did sound a bit shaky.
He’d been told he was on probation for two years, with a possibility for revaluation for a shorter time period if he abided by his probation requirements.
He blinked away the tears that were starting to form in his eyes, and pulled back down his sleeve. He was not going to spend the next however many days wallowing in self-pity over his moving Mark with Potter present. He would ignore the burning as much as he could, and not let Potter see his pain. He wouldn’t look at it at all, because that just brought horrible thoughts about harming himself back to the front of his mind, and he wasn’t going down that dark road again.
“I felt so much relief because I’d found out I hadn’t been alone, but when I had thought about it some more, the relief inside me went away; I was so upset that out of everyone in the castle, it had to have been you. But, it turned out okay, in the end. And I'm glad it was you, I'm glad I got to know you better the past two weeks and I'm glad we got to look past all of our past prejudices, and form… a- a friendship.”
Potter turned slightly at the sound of Draco approaching, and gestured for him to come closer. Draco eyed Potter skeptically, but did walk a bit closer to Potter.
The main Death Eater stood in front of Drys while the two who were still holding Drys in place by his arms stood beside him. They didn’t say anything; just waited calmly until the rest of the group came back together.
“I said that because Alec didn’t want people knowing about his mum. In reality their family isn’t fine, and his dad is
He opened his eyes slowly reluctantly, and noticed rain was still pouring down, thunder rumbling somewhere in the distance. He’d been too engaged in his memories of his night before to notice the storm.
He also noticed that there was no warm presence by his side. He frowned and turned to his other side, waiting to catch his eyes on Harry’s sleeping body, when Harry also wasn’t lying on his other side. Harry was, however, standing up at the edge of the pavilion and looking out at the rain, no doubt getting drenched.
Ever since that night in the Room of Requirement, Harry and Draco had slept there together every night. Eventually, Draco had had to tell Pansy and Blaise where he went off to every night, to which Pansy had laughed in his face upon finding out it was to go snuggle up next to Potter.
Potter did however pull a frown when Draco got to the limitations of the books’ powers. “We just have to use our questions wisely,” Potter said.
The Figure kicked something at his feet, which made Draco look down at the motion. There was something- or someone- lying completely still where the muddy ground of the forest and the wet grass of the lawn came to meet. It was still raining outside rather viciously, and it partly obscured Draco’s vision, but he knew, he knew from the bottom of his heart that that someone who was lying in a curled up position next to where the Figure’s cloak touched the ground, was Harry.
He knew it was a trap from the moment one of the owls dropped a letter in front of him at breakfast that morning. He had eyed the letter suspiciously, and once he came to the conclusion that the letter itself, was in fact, not cursed, had opened it. The letter had read:
“I made a terrible, terrible mistake, Professors,” Draco said. The only reason he had admitted that out loud, was because he deeply felt he
“Here we go,” Potter said as they approached the sparkly ward. He opened the book to the bookmarked page which explained how to cast the counter-charm.
“Yep,” Draco said as he handed Snape’s book back to Potter, like it was some known agreement Potter was the rightful owner of the book. He then recited everything Snape had told him about the book to Potter, who nodded his head and looked extremely excited at the amount of luck they had for procuring the book in the first place.
The entirety of the room was pretty small, but it was a cozy type of small. There was certainly enough room for about twenty people in total, not that the number of people that could fit in the room would be a problem, considering he and Harry were the only Wizards around.
Cool breezes brushed past them as they all ate and chatted and laughed, and the beginning of summer had officially begun. Draco was nineteen now. A student who had passed all of his NEWTs, and had only one more day of classes to go to. He had a boyfriend. Two best friends. Multiple acquaintances and a world full of people who, despite recent
Draco pulled apart Theo’s curtains, and glowered down at Theo who was sleeping soundly in his bed, tucked away neatly under his coverlet.
He sat up in bed and ran a hand through his hair. He wondered why Potter hadn’t woken him from his vision. Perhaps he hadn’t been restless, and had slept peacefully on the outside. He knew that on the inside however he
“And I guess what I’m trying to say,” Draco added on, “What I’m trying to say is that you’ve been a constant in my life, despite all odds, and recently I got to know you on a whole new level.”
Drys, his values and plans, the exact opposite of the Dark Lord’s, and yet so similar. Wanting to rid the world of Purebloods forever, starting with the death of the ones inside Hogwarts; the Death Eaters, who were mostly Pureblood, getting to watch their own kind die by their own hands.
“Well, after I had Snape’s book, and created all of the spells I needed with help from his book, I had
Two weeks spent alone in the castle with Harry, one week when he was out cold in the Hospital Wing after the confrontation with Drys, and at last, the week he’d just recently spent where he was barely even able to move from the bed, due to the sheer bewilderment of everything that had happened during the time of the sleeping curse.
“I understand. Don’t worry, he’ll be safe here with me. I’ll keep an eye on him. Now, goodnight, Miss Granger.”
Draco was just about to measure out the right amount of knotgrass that needed to be added, when Potter moved back his right elbow a little bit too much, resulting in him knocking off the jar of fluxweed from the table. There was a loud crash, and everybody in the room turned to face them. Draco felt a flush creep across his cheeks, and he guessed the scar on his face appeared bright red.
Draco thought about their last group therapy session. He thought long and hard, trying to remember some word Elizabeth had told them.
Love. Four letters. Eight letters if a person was ever brave enough to say, “I love you.” Possibly the most daunting phrase known to Wizarding kind. Perhaps Muggle kind, too.
Potter contemplated what he was going to say, and eventually came up with the world’s most boring answer. “I had a very good breakfast today with lots of treacle tart. My bad thing is I ate too much of it.” That earned him lots of snickers. Not the accusing kind, the kind that Draco would’ve got if he’d voiced that answer, but the friendly, kind-hearted laughs.
Draco had thought the stares the students had given him in the hallways were bad. It was nothing compared to what the students in the Slytherin common room were like.
Before Draco could even register he was heading in the wrong direction, he ran into someone. Or, rather, someone ran into
He decided since he had already told Potter about his first vision, it wouldn’t do him any harm by telling him about the one he had just had. “I had this vision? It was weird. Remember how I told you about my dream that I had where I was in a weird room and there was this hooded figure who told me, ‘two weeks’?” Potter nodded his head carefully. “Well, I had the same dream just now. Except I’m pretty sure it was some sort of message. Not really a dream at all. It was all the same, but this time the figure in the room said my
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Harry squinting at the sky, even with his glasses on. “I don’t see it. Which one’s Ursa Minor again?”
He continued to stare in bewilderment at the empty corridors, when he heard the echo of footsteps bouncing off the walls. He turned himself around to face the stairs he had just come down, relieved to know there was someone else wandering Hogwarts.
Pansy was standing in the doorway, with her hands on her hips and a quirk to her mouth. She was trying to come off as bored, mixed with irritation, but her amusement was certainly not covered.
So, he worked steadily with Blaise by his side and tried to ignore any distractions. All of his classmates and teachers gave him a wide berth in general, they tried not to go near him or acknowledge him, which was a much different kind of berth from the one before the Curse. Draco conceded that it was because what happened with Harry and him was mysterious, and the full story wasn’t out yet. They couldn’t be so sure of what would happen around Draco. The only logical solution, according to his classmates, was to avoid him like the plague.
Even as Draco stood in the middle of the hallway, mentally reassuring himself: he wasn’t reassured. The painful burning sensation reminded him way too much of a darker time. A time where Draco was scared to breathe. He had felt that if he did, the Dark Lord would kill him or his family.
skidding to a stop on his arse, and attempted getting up, but found he couldn’t, due to the amount of laughter coming out of him.
“He was required to go to Hogwarts last year, and I guess he just stuck around for this year too. But he’s fine, I guess. He’s Muggle-born so it was pretty hard for him and his family during the war, but they’re all safe now.”
“Oh, you know, the usual. Talking to the shelves. We were having a tea party, you see, with the brooms, right before you interrupted.”
This time around, Draco was prepared, and turned to look directly at Harry, smiling a huge smile. Harry did the exact same thing, and he wondered whether Harry had actually read his mind. Or, maybe, they just thought alike.
“I won’t see you again until the spring holidays,” she said. “That is, unless some unexpected event pops up that involves you.” She looked at him pointedly, but it was obvious she was joking. Sort of.
“Hating me? Wanting me dead?” Draco offered. “Yes. I knew they would. The looks everyone gave my family and I when we were escorted through the Ministry was nauseating, and they were all people I’d never met in my life. So, of course, the students I had personally bullied and made fun of back at Hogwarts would be even more upset with me. It only made sense. But the three reasons I had
becoming way too cluttered with question after question regarding the whole curse, and newly added on to the list, magical wards encasing them.
Harry didn’t respond, instead he walked over to the door Draco had made appear. Draco followed after him, and they stood side by side staring at the intricate wood-work on the door.
She also sent invitations to people they went to Hogwarts with, people in the Ministry, people Draco worked with, and some of Pansy’s friends- just to fill the space.
Later that night, when the castle was asleep, before the two headed for the Room of Requirement, he and Harry headed for the Garden. Their Garden.
“During my days at Hogwarts,” Drys said, “I always knew I had a special talent for creating spells, and building off existing ones, making them extremely powerful. I experimented a lot, and would stay up all night just to
He was about to protest and ask why Drys would ever even think he’d leave Harry and walk over to Drys, but a faint tugging encased him, and his mind started to go blank. He felt like he was watching the world from afar as he let Harry fall out of his lap and started to make his way over to Drys, who wasn’t standing that far away.
“Potter?” Draco said as he pushed his blankets out of the way and let his bare feet hit the cool ground. “Potter, bloody hell, where the fuck are you?”
He lifted his arm out in front of him, still lying sprawled on the ground, and let out a gasp. His robe sleeve and shirt sleeve had both been cut off at his left elbow, revealing his forearm that had a brand new cut, slicing all the way down the skull and snake. The cut was obviously a new one, not one from his previous self-inflicted injuries, since blood was gushing out
“So, either no one is in the mood for some shopping, or Hogsmeade also got hit with whatever sleeping spell Hogwarts is under.” Potter inquired. “Are you done resting? We should check out all the shops and see if there actually is anyone else awake.”
He’d thought he was a changed man. He’d thought he’d never let anyone take advantage of him ever again. He was so incredibly naive to believe all the lies he’d told himself.
Darkness surrounded him, circling around him like it was about to feast on its prey. It stopped as quickly as it started, though, and Draco was transported to a room in a house. It instantly reminded him of the room he would always go to in his visions with the Figure, but that room had been worn down and completely destroyed.
Small groups of people were swarming his table now--mostly Slytherins--and no one was clapping or screaming, thank Merlin, but the chatter that filled the Great Hall was incredibly loud, and Draco found himself face to face with multiple people who, only a day ago, had glared at him and tried to throw a discreet jinx at his feet.
“Malfoy-” Potter started, and Draco looked away; he couldn’t focus on Potter’s sympathizing face, it hurt too much. “What if we go in together?”
After one more shift, he was in a blank room, save for a body length mirror. A piece was missing. He reached out to touch the missing piece. He took a good look at himself, his scars on full display, and his hatred for himself was there, but not that prominent.
you had some evil intention, Draco. I know you better than you know yourself.” Theo was walking closer to him, but Draco stood his ground, bringing his wand up higher. “I don’t know exactly what you were aiming at, especially with bringing Potter along for the ride, but let me tell you something--”
“Help! I’m stuck in this broom closet!” Draco yelled at the top of his lungs. Though, he made sure he didn’t sound desperate, just wishing for freedom, in an urgent fashion. Yeah.
“I used to, though,” Draco added softly. “Harm my forearm, that is. But I haven’t in a really long while.”
It seemed kind of selfish that Draco was more worried about what would happen to Harry, than what would happen to the rest of Hogwarts and his parents. Sure, the fact that hundreds of people were unconsciously counting on him to break them free of the sleeping curse was a pretty good motive to make the “right” choice, but Draco was still one hundred percent
He’d decided as they’d made their morning rounds to the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms that he would give in and tell the book a meaningful secret. He didn’t know what secret he would tell, but he told himself he’d figure it out when the time came. He’d wanted to tell Potter his decision right then as he made it, but couldn’t seem to form the right words. So here they were now, about an hour into their research session, finally confessing he was ready to tell a secret.
The Death Eaters, save for Draco, got their own cruel punishment. They were forced to obey all of Drys’s commands, but were all fully aware of the evil they were committing; killing their own blood. It was a punishment that served them right, Draco thought.
A lot had changed. Now, even though being alone with Harry was all Draco had thought about in the Hospital Wing, it was just
While Draco had been busy admiring pretty much every aspect of the Garden, Harry had sorted through the food, laying it out in their respective categories. There was a section of sweets which consisted of treacle tart, pudding, and chocolate. The other section was a variety of sandwiches, another was an assortment of fruits and veggies, and the last was cartons of pumpkin juice. Draco was not particularly hungry, since they had eaten dinner not to long ago, but he picked up a sandwich anyway.
People were dancing and drinking and overall having a wonderful time, from what Draco could tell. He wondered if this was what parties in Hogsmeade were always like; the ones he’d never attended.
Drys sneered. “The more people who can live under my empire, of course. And trust me, no one will want to stop me. I’m going to be making the world a
“Looks like we’re here.” Potter said as they neared Hogsmeade. Draco was extremely grateful that they had arrived. He desperately needed to sit down. His chest was absolutely killing him, and he wouldn’t have been surprised if he had looked down to see that his cuts had opened back up again and were leaking blood through his jumper and coat. He supposed he could have taken a rest in the snow if his injuries had gotten really bad, but he didn’t want to freeze his arse off, so he had kept walking alongside Potter, making no complaints.
He was about to crawl back into bed when he noticed Harry was visibly trembling, sort of like he was cold. Draco knew that wasn’t the case. The Room of Requirement was the perfect temperature, catering to their specific needs whenever one of them so much as blinked. Harry must be having a nightmare.
He was about to continue on his way towards the bathroom to get ready when he remembered his vision, along with the horrid offer. “Before I forget,” Draco said, “I had another vision.”
have sent a letter for help to the Ministry. If he had, instead of sending a letter to Lucius, Draco wouldn’t have to make an impossible decision.
Harry shook his hand, flinging water droplets onto Draco, which led to Draco shoving Harry slightly in a playful way, almost causing the tosser to fall into the fountain.
For a split second Draco thought everyone had found out about his and Harry’s shared kiss, before rationalizing that if that were to somehow get out, people’s expressions would be much different from what they were now.
to Draco’s surprise, everyone raised their hand. Even Pansy. Draco slowly raised his hand too, because he would’ve been singled out if he hadn’t participated.
I'm expecting the next chapter to be maybe 10k words? So it really will take me a while to write, but I'm excited for the challenge :)
Draco clutched tightly at his wand and made his way to his four poster, not daring to look in the direction of Theo.
“You and whoever else is present when you want to open the book must each reveal a secret. The secret must be meaningful, and must be something you would not wish to ever say to anyone. Once everyone says their secrets aloud to the book, the book will provide you with whatever you seek.”
After the throbbing lessened greatly, he muttered the password, and stepped into the Slytherin common room. He immediately stood still, gaping at the sight of about ten students of all different ages, just sleeping.
Draco was in a position of so much power. Power, where either way he chose to use it, would end up with people getting hurt.
Draco honestly couldn’t believe he was arguing with Harry about whether or not he should accompany Draco to the depths of the library. But on second thought, he definitely could believe it.
Before he could get a word in, though, McGonagall spoke. “Draco, please realize that I am always here to talk. And if anyone bothers you, whether that be a student or a professor, please come to me immediately.”
And just like that, a flash of green light filled the room, illuminating the shiny masks and highlighting Alec and Drys’ faces of horror and disbelief. Olive fell to the floor, her lifeless body opening up a void of grief and un-realness.
bed- which made his heart ache painfully. He’d become so weak for Harry. Moping about his clothes on top of red sheets. But he wouldn’t trade being weak for the one he loved, for anything in the world.
over here-” Kaspian emphasized ‘Draco’ very noticeably- “because you knew he wouldn’t have a partner and everyone else would, so you would get to work with him.”
“But on top of that, what friend of Potter’s would want to hurt him? What friend of Potter’s wouldn’t stop trying to find an escape, and contact the Ministry once I had entered their head? I needed someone close to Potter like you, Draco. Someone who would think of their own gain first, and someone who was close to Potter in a way that wasn’t friendship. You were the perfect candidate. And, if you weren’t close enough to him, you would surely be after two weeks.”
“I admit, I was a fool for believing we would be safe living in our house during the middle of a war, a war where Muggles and Muggle-borns were the ones mainly being targeted, but I’d assumed the Ministry wouldn’t let the destruction of hundreds of lives happen. I thought Olive and I had more time. I thought that we could wait until things got really bad, and then flee the country, or continent even.
“Come on, Malfoy. You know I’m right. I don’t want to be with you anymore than you do with me, but Hogsmeade seems like the best bet to find answers.”
“CAN YOU PLEASE STOP?!” Draco broke even more, screaming the words and creating more discomfort in his throat. “Please. Can you please just… stop.”
Granger didn’t say anything else, she just continued to stand at the foot of the bed, and after a while of awkwardly staring at Draco, she whispered into Potter’s ear something inaudible.
“Who cares? Let’s get out of here before someone finds us. I think we did some good damage.” That was definitely Theo’s voice.
Draco still felt stiff, and his body was filled with doses of pain, but he knew he felt ten times better than he had the last couple times he’d been slightly conscious.
Dumbledore smiled down at Draco. His eyes sparkled, and Draco felt the anger inside of him subside, replaced with a hint of courage. “Go find Harry, Draco.”
Okay. Maybe Draco had been a little too quick to judge Potter’s skills after all. He was still absolute shit at Potions, but he could read, which was all the skill that Draco really required in a partner. They didn’t talk at all after their little conversation regarding Kaspian, and Draco was fine with that. He really didn’t like to talk to people other than Pansy, though Potter seemed to bring out a weird side of him. It was like he wanted to start up a conversation with Potter, but he was almost too scared to.
That got him kicked out of the Hospital Wing for good. And that’s when, along with Draco being an alleged killer, they placed Aurors outside and inside the Hospital Wing.
“We should head back inside before the snow gets really bad,” Potter stated, pulling his coat tighter around himself.
Draco was looking directly at where the wand had been held, but Harry’s attention hadn’t been held where Draco’s had. Harry was staring directly at Draco, not in a creepy way whatsoever, but in a protective, caring way. The Harry in real life was back to blushing again, and Draco had a feeling it had to do with the words Harry's eyes conveyed in the picture.
He self-consciously scratched his forearm, hating that he hadn’t had the time to secure about a million cufflinks on his sleeves. He could feel The Mark moving under his touch, and shuddered as he continued on his way to his house’s common room. He would think about his dream and Mark at a later time, but right now the priority was finding other people who were awake.
His head still resting on the pillow, he turned towards the door where McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey stood speaking to each other in hushed voices. Maybe McGonagall just came in to talk to Pomfrey, and would leave soon…
“Ah, finally.” A strange noise came out of the radio, and Draco almost covered his ears with his hands. Almost. “Okay, so, summer before eighth year I learned this spell that allows you to play whatever song you want on a radio, you just have to think of a song and it will play it.” Harry seemed truly prideful of the spell.
To his luck, an eagle owl came flying from around a spire and landed on the ledge in front of him. It looked like the owl he had when he was younger, and for a second he allowed himself to reminisce in the good old memories of his youth.
“So, how did you find out about these spells that work on a radio?” Draco asked, stopping himself from thinking about their almost kiss.
without me around,” Draco said jokingly, but not without meaning. His comment earned him a slap on the shoulder which was already sore from Pansy lightly hitting him there day after day. (She said that’s how you know she cares about you.)
So that’s what Olive did, running up the stairs and coming back down with a boy Draco’s age, and going into a room which Draco presumed was the kitchen.
Harry nodded his head. He was also looking intently at Draco, and had long since dropped his food back on his plate.
He wrote down the basics of what he would say to them. He wasn’t ready to actually speak to them face to face yet, but just writing down his thoughts on parchment took a weight off his shoulders. Eventually, he planned to apologize to as many people as he could. It would be impossible to apologize to everyone, so he told himself he’d do his best.
They’d fallen asleep pretty fast, their arms wrapped around each other, Draco breathing in Harry’s scent as he drifted into lovely dreams, dreams that he never wanted to end. He hadn’t remembered having a nice dream since… fifth year. Maybe even third. Who knew.
At first, the whole situation was terribly awkward. There was a huge gap between the two of them, and neither of them seemed to want to close the space. Draco debated on taking the risk and closing the space between them, but Harry got to it first, and their chests were touching. The closeness was intoxicating, however, in the best way possible.
“I got this. It’s probably just the wind. Besides, you went off without me when you ran to Slughorn’s classroom to retrieve the vial with the Restorative Potion. I think it’s my turn to run off without you,” Draco reasoned. Harry was about to retort back some snarky comment, no doubt, so Draco cut in: “
