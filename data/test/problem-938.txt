The letters were glowing silver, surrounded by miniscule white roses.
“Well, I don’t know but I know for a fact that your family is bad! All you do is keep secrets, Malfoy! Last Christmas I know you got hurt after going home but you never told me! Every single time I ask you about something that hits too close to home you don’t tell me! Your father was a death eater! How am I supposed to know if he’s training you to become one too? I saw you at Knockturn alley that day in the summer. Your father was selling illegal dark magic items because he was afraid Malfoy manor was going to be raided! And then he went and beat Mr. Weasley up! And called Hermione that awful word!” Harry was panting by the end of it and he had stood up, brows knitted in anger.
“You’re one of the kindest people I know, Draco.” She said sincerely, and he felt himself go redder, his cloak a little too warm as Harry nodded and squeezed his hand tightly.
The last present was the smallest and had a note that said Open when you’re alone. Draco pocketed it, despite his mother giving him a severe look. He realized too late that she recognized the scrawl. They were the same as the name etched on his ribs.
He glanced at the bedside table and was surprised to find no water or tea. Come to think of it, the bedside table didn’t look like his bedside table at all. What on earth was he doing in one of the guest rooms?
“What’s got them all riled up?” Millicent giggled as she twirled her hair around her finger.
“My soulmate is a Gryffindor too,” Draco whispered, not really wanting to divulge the name.
“Apologize, Harry.” He couldn’t see the devasted look on Draco’s face. He wanted to be celebrating.
“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books — look at all those amazing things he’s done —”
“No, Harry.” Draco wasn’t whispering anymore. Harry was glad the hallway was empty. “I’m not telling you anything! You were horrid to be yesterday!” Harry hung his head in shame.
James bent down to kiss her gently on the temple as Sirius and Remus rushed in with congratulations. Lily glared at her soulmate’s best friends who had inevitably become hers as well, but surprisingly, the commotion didn't upset the baby nestled in her arms. Baby Harry only gurgled in glee as he took in the chaotic energy of Sirius Black.
“Why, it’s a majestic looking one too.” Mr. Granger exclaimed from his sitting chair as the eagle owl sat on their tea table, holding a heavily embossed green envelope. Hermione came down the stairs, hoping for Hedwick, but was surprised to see Draco’s family owl instead.
“How was Christmas?” Hermione asked the boys and was surprised when everyone looked a bit sullen.
“As if Snivellus is a trustworthy source,” James commented as he ran past them with Harry on his shoulders. Harry was squealing in absolute delight.
“W-what, No! Let me go!” I try to struggle as Mad-eye features started to morph and I was no longer looking at my defense teacher, “w-who are you..?”
Writing looks like this:
“Of course we are!” Harry exclaimed happily and I started to feel even worse. Harry and Draco were a duo and I knew that Seamus and Dean got on better when I was not there. They were more playful when it was just the two of them, and I just seemed to make them tense. Making sure they were pre-occupied I slipped out of the great hall unseen.
“Please come with me Mr. Weasley,” Severus stated placing a hand on my shoulder. It had been two days since my mate had fallen into a healing sleep and I was reluctant to leave his side; even though nothing could get to him as he was in my room.
“Simple; he is my mate,” I said softly.
Writing looks like this:
“Colin, are you feeling alright?” Seamus asked the small blue eyed boy that was leaning against me. I was slowly kissing my way up his neck, and Colin was letting out small moans of pleasure. Seamus had his head on Colin’s thigh and was slowly massaging his length to hardness.
“Let’s hope you are right because here Harry comes,” Crabbe stated just as the cannon fired signalling Harry’s turn.
“Don’t worry Perce I am just taking us somewhere more comfortable,” Oliver stated as he placed me on the bed and climbed in as well; his arms instantly wrapping around me, “now tell me everything that you can’t hand yourself.”
(Time skip)
“Who knows brother of mine,” I replied as we turned the corner; coming face to face with Harry, five Slytherins, and three older champions.
“Hey Colin, do you know where Seamus and Dean are?” Fred asked as he, George, and Lee entered the common room.
Dean’s P.O.V
“Yes Harry?”
a voice called pulling me from the darkness I had drifted into. Blinking a few times I came face to face with my blonde mate, “
“Are you serious Draco?” Crab asked.
“What is this condition?” Severus asked in suspicion.
“Then tell me Mr. Potter how was it that your name was shot out of the goblet of fire? Hmm,” the headmaster stated.
“And the finally the champion of Hogwarts is… Cedric Diggory!” Dumbledore called and brought me back to reality. The Hufflepuff’s were going crazy as Cedric made his way up to the front of the great hall, shook Dumbledore’s hand, and made his way into the room with the other three champions. “Our three champions have now been selec...” Dumbledore started but was cut off as the goblet of fire suddenly began to shoot out red flames.
“Alright Ced,” Harry replied softly as I entered my common room completely exhausted.
,” Draco whispered, “What’s wrong?”
“WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU YELLING AT HIM? HAVEN’T YOU DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE!” I roared grabbing Lee by his collar. Lee gave a squeak, but didn’t struggle he just cast his eyes down in shame.
“Why these boys have explained what had happened and are willing to apologize if Mr. Longbottom will apologize first,” Dumbledore stated calmly.
“Yeah just run away you stupid fairy!” Ran shouted as his face became as red as his hair.
“Let’s get him to Percy.”
“I do you git!” my twin growled angrily.
“What the hell is going on with those two today?” George asked in disbelief. Ron and Hermione had been bitching and complaining about Harry all morning and I was finally getting to my last nerve.
“Thank Hades,” Godric sighed in relief.
“Yeah we’re just making sure the fucking blood sucker knows his place!” another boy cheered until I stalked over to the blonde who had spoken first, picked him up and smashed him into the wall behind me leaving a slight dent from the force of the impact. Releasing the boy he slid down and slumped over, on the wall behind him was a small amount of dripping down the wall behind him. The Ravenclaws seeing this finally realised that I would not be tolerating or turning a blind eye to their actions. Just as they were all about to run off Snape came around the corner he locked eyes with me for a second before nodding and casting a sticking and silencing charm on the Ravenclaws before telling me to grab Neville.
“Call him here then,” Bagman ordered impatiently. The man really was not very imposing for a tournament master; in fact he was even sweating as he spoke.
“Stuff is Jordan!” George growled and pulled Fred closer to him, “you have no right to talk to him like that.”
“Yeah right,” I scoffed.
Viktor: a submissive wood nymph who is being courted by George. He is rather self-conscious about being a submissive because his parents are always saying that he is a failure because of it.
“R-Ron and H-Hermione cornered us and forced Seamus and Dean to a-attack you. If they d-didn’t agree R-Ron said he would attack me instead o-of y-you,” I stuttered sadly and Draco growled giving me a look of disbelief, “y-you don’t have to b-believe me I j-just wanted y-you to know the truth.”
Writing looks like this:
“Well met, he will do well in protecting you. Now what is your name young man?” Augusta asked.
“Let us go to bed
“Yes I found out this summer, and besides his blood wouldn’t let him participate.”
I whimpered as my drunken school mate suckled on my neck, and I was to shaken to push the pervert off. All that was running through my mind was that George deserved someone better than me; someone who actually looked like a submissive.
Flashback
“HARRY POTTER!” The room instantly became as quiet as a grave yard, and my heart stopped. Turning towards Harry only made my heart break.  My poor mate was shaking like a leaf as he was shoved, harshly, towards the headmaster. Said headmaster was standing there looking almost smug about the whole thing. My ears finally picked on the whispers of the crowded hall; the claims of cheating of our school mates, and the worries from the foreign schools. The foreign schools were, besides a select few, to see that something was clearly wrong with this situation.
Summary
“We had better get going before Filtch catches us out of class,” Seamus said as Colin and I separated.
“Who would you be; and how did you get into my school?” Dumbledore asked grandfatherly twinkle gone from his eyes.
“Of course we will Little Dragon. You are my soulmate! Nothing will ever take you from me again.”
“No Seamus it is not your fault. We are both to blame, so don’t go putting all this guilt onto yourself.”
“I-I just met y-you, and I d-don’t want to be s-separated yet…”
“Of course Blaise, I will always be with you.”
Dean: Dominant Veela; Mated with Seamus and Colin.
Cedric: Hogwarts champion and Harry’s adoptive brother. He is also a wood elf and has adopted Harry and helped him through his inheritance.
“W-we are in the hospital wing Colin you passed out from blood loss,” Seamus choked out, “why did you do it angel?”
Neville: Submissive day walker (Original Vampire).
Writing looks like this:
I was appalled by this kid’s behavior. According to the twins Lee was one of the nicest people in Hogwarts, but here he is calling my baby brother a slut. The heart broken expression on Fred’s face didn’t make me feel any better about the kid. Out of our whole family we only had two male submissives, Fred and Percy, and we were very protective of them.
“P-papa,” I whispered softly; causing Lucius to turn around and look at me,” I-I can’t lose m-my magic.”
“Stop don’t hurt him!” I shouted as the large man pulled back his other arm preparing to harm the kid. Even though he was always bullying me and tormenting me I couldn’t let him be hurt.
Summary
The moment Dumbledore entered the apartment I knew that there would be trouble. Snape had already left to talk to Neville’s grandmother about the incident so that left me and Oliver to deal with both Dumbledore and the Ravenclaw students.
“Simple Harry has elven inheritance and the tournament would not allow an underage water elf to participate,” I stated.
“Who cares where that cheater is,” Ron sneered.
I watched as my little mate wandered closer to the forbidden forest. He seemed so depressed tonight, but surely he would not be foolish to move closer to the dangers that lurked in those woods at night. Unfortunately he was too distracted by his thoughts tonight to realise how close he was to the evil that made its home there. Suddenly a shadowed figure jumped the boy pushing him to the ground and ripping off his pants. I quickly shifted to my human form just as my mate screamed, “Don’t please! I don’t want this! I’m begging you don’t do this!”
“Get bent you fucking prude!” Seamus snapped as he and Dean pulled me to the third year boys dormitory. Grangers words forgotten as they tenderly made love to me.
“Me! What are you doing?”
Elven Hero
Colin’s P.O.V
Flashback
Percy: Submissive dragon inheritance was to be mated to Oliver but medalling from his mother, Penelope, and Dumbledore prevented him from doing so. Will once again be mated to Oliver.
“I cannot BELIEVE that the two of you would attack your fellow house mate!” Our head of house screeched and my mate cringed at the sound of it.
Elven looks like this:
“Plus me and Fleur will help you in vhat every vay we can,” Viktor stated in his overly accented voice.
“Go to the room near the portrait of wolves and say freedom and integrity,” Snape stated as he turned to deal with the frozen boys.
“Charlie Weasley.”
“He is trying to steal Fred away from me!” Lee snarled glaring at Viktor.
“It could be from the stress of the tournament,” Dumbledore stated as he stalked over to the blonde Lord, “or he is simply faking once more; he is after all an attention seeker.”
Harry’s P.O.V
“I m-missed you *hic* so m-much Ollie,” Percy cried tears intently soaking into my shirt.
Chapter 6
“Are you still competing in the tournament Harry?” Theo asked.
“I have no interest in Fred,” Viktor said surprisingly softly, “a submissive cannot court another submissive.”
“Now do you understand why I am not particularly happy about this situation? Harry could be seriously hurt in this tournament or worse his magic could be bound and he could die because of anything. I want no one from our house to hassle him. Do I make myself clear?” I asked in a steely voice. The house seemed to get the message as I got a bunch of nodding heads in reply, “good.
“What a-are you doing here, Char’?” Percy asked softly reverting back to name he called me as a child.
“So Malfoy tell us when did you get bent and start going out with our little lion cub?” George, at least I think it is George, asked.
“You boys are free to go,” Snape stated and Seamus didn’t need to be told twice before pulling us out of the room.
I swam as fast as I could; I had to rescue Fleur’s baby sister. She was so young and wouldn’t understand why she was down there or that her sister wasn’t coming to get her.
Those words horrified me and I was in front of him growling within seconds, “I would get off him!”
“You heard me I don’t want you near that ass again!” Lee shouted grabbing my shoulders forcefully, “if I see you talking to that bastard again I swear I will lock you in our room and never let you out again!”
“Now that we are all here how ‘bout we get started,” Ron sneered as he sat on one of the old rickety desks, “you two are going to help me with a little project.”
Colin: Submissive light fay; mated with Seamus and Dean.
Percy: Submissive dragon inheritance was to be mated to Oliver but medalling from his mother, Penelope, and Dumbledore prevented him from doing so. Will once again be mated to Oliver.
“Because if you don’t Colin won’t have a pretty face anymore!” Hermione snapped as she brought her wand to Colin’s temple, causing the boy to squeak and go completely still.
Penelope: evil bitch who broke up Percy and Oliver.
“Colin, where are you?” I called out softly praying for an answer, but no reply. Trying again I got my heart breaking response. I could hear whimpering from the bathroom. Quickly I opened the bathroom door I found Colin, but it was a sight I never wanted to see. Sitting on the floor sobbing was my little angel and his arms were covered in blood, “C-Colin!”
Chapter 11
“Big mistake!” I growled moving closer faster than he could react I grabbed the figure by his neck and threw him out of my way snapping his neck in the process. Unfortunately this caused his fingers to be ripped out of my mates’ entrance and my little one to scream. I wrapped my little one in a tight hug as I whispered calming, loving word as my natural magic healed any of the injuries the poor boy had. “Be calm my mate I bust move you, but it might hurt.”
I did as the voice suggested but the light immediately hurt my eyes, “Ugh…. T-to bright…” I whisper softly shutting my eyes.
“I know, come we must find Cedric before it is too late,” Viktor states as we both begin running again eventually ending up near the cup again. Beside the cup was Cedric a dazed and confused look on his face.
Draco: He is a dominate male Veela; who’s family saves Harry with the help of the Diggory’s.
“Thank you Dray,” I said snuggling into his chest, allowing myself to be lulled to sleep by my mates’ heartbeat.
“Yes and Lord Hades wishes for you to know how proud he is of you.” Godric stated a tear slipping down Blaise’s cheek.
“What do you want Weasley,” Draco sneered.
“WOW!” The twins exclaimed causing me to jump.
“I c-couldn’t have asked f-for more for m-my f-first time!” Colin stated with a yawn and soon he was out like a light. This caused Seamus to smile, kiss Colin on the cheek, and follow the younger boy’s example and accept Morpheus’s call.
“Cedric take harry to call his magic guardian and make sure that he doesn’t run off,” Dumbledore stated with a dismissive look.
FinallyHarry and Cedric had been shuffled down to the Slytherin common rooms where they were finally allowed to break down. Harry had curled up on my lap, and was cryign softly as I rubbed circles on his back. Cedric was next to us stairing at the fire with a blamk expression.
“Where is he Seamus?” Dean asked in panic. I was about to answer when my arm began to sting, burning in pain, causing me to gasp. Everything was screaming at me to go to the Gryffindor common room and find my mate.
“Harry!” I yelled as the boys eyes rolled back; his body finally collapsing under the stress of the tournament.
“Dray people are staring,” Harry whispered as he leaned closer to the blonde sitting next to him. Said blonde just gave him a smile and wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder as a sign of comfort to the stressed boy.
All I felt was chilling cold surrounding my body. I had no ability to even open my eyes to see my surroundings. The last thing I remember was my godfather asking to speak with me; then nothing. Suddenly I could feel arms pulling me up, and as we reached the surface my abilities began returning. As we broke the surface, of what I finally realised was water, my vison returned. Coming face to face with a terrified Harry was not pleasing. I only got to look at him for a few seconds before he dived back under. Looking at the stands I realised why; Fleur was on the dock, her arm injured, as she stood standing on the dock in fear. She hadn’t been able to rescue her hostage.
“S-Seamus, D-Dean what’s g-going on?” Colin asked as he tried to come over to us, only to have Hermione yank him back harshly.
“Better?” Oliver asked causing me to blush. It had taken nearly 20 minutes to calm down, and Oliver just held me whispering sweet nothing into my ear. It made me wish that I had never given into Penelope’s black mail. I had missed the safe feeling I got when I was in Oliver’s arms after an upsetting day.
“Lee said some pretty nasty things to him and we haven’t been able to calm him down,” Charlie whispered looking absolutely furious.
“Do not treat me like a child you fool. And this is not your school,” The man with the scythe sneered.
Elven looks like this:
“Then there is nothing left for us to discuss,” the headmaster of Durmstrang institute stated gruffly as he placed a hand on Viktors shoulder and led him out of the room followed by Madame Maxime and Fleur following their example.
“ONLY ONE!” a merman screeched as I reached the tiny blond. The merfolk grabbed and scratched me as we broke the surface of the water beside the stands. Cedric and Draco pulled us out of the water, and wrapped us in thick towels. Gabriela was passed to Viktor and Fleur who were kick to pull the girl into a tight hug as George joined them.
“Leave.” I growled as Barty grabbed the rat and pulling him back to the house. This left me alone with the Potter boy; who was staring at me with large green doe like eyes. “Hello Potter.”
“T-that was our oldest brother C-Charlie,” Fred stuttered in disbelief.
“Not a clue,” my twin replied.
“Wee Harry he iz right,” Fleur replied ruffling the boys hair. Harry just flushed at the girl’s attention.
“It is my fault.”
I had just shot up Fleur’s sparks and was running away from the area like a blind man. This was a nerve racking game; it was a complete death sentence, turn’s right. I needed to find Cedric and Viktor, Turn’s left. We could all get the cup and share eternal glory, Duck. Then this whole thing would be over and we all could win.
“You don’t have zey right to question minor without magic guardian,” Viktor stated gruffly and clamped his hand on Cedric’s shoulder.
(The Next Day)
“Come Wormtail!” the new man shouted as Peter Pettigrew came forward with a shrivelled body. My curiosity doubled as Pettigrew placed the body on the ground and a large cauldron came into view.
Chapter #1
“What do we need to do?” I asked. My worries of Colin’s safety outweighed my worries of consequences.
“Please Percy let us actually help you for once. Just tell us so we can help you,” George pleaded and I finally listened. They were family after all.
“P-please let m-me go…” the boy whimpered as I moved closer to him.
“I just had a really hard day.”
“Mr. Diggory I demand that you allow me to question Mr. Potter; he owes us an explanation, now.”  The headmaster stated. The rest of the once angry group had accepted Cedric words just looked down upon the headmaster’s harsh words.
Oliver: Dominate wood elf who is going to be mated to Percy. Due to meddling from Dumbledore, Molly, and Penelope they were broken up.
I chuckled at my little mates’ reaction, but dimmed the lights as he had asked. His beautiful chocolate brown eyes opened and they took away my breathe. They held such innocence, but fear. It was something that I didn’t like to see but I understood it came with the nature of what he was. “Hello my little mate. My name is Regulus Black.”
“I haven’t seen them e-either.” I said and tried to make myself seem smaller. The tree boys seem to notice this, but couldn’t say anything as Professor McGonagall stalked in with Professor Snape following. Snape was shoving Dean and Seamus by their shoulders.
“Don’t worry love Ced already explained what Lee said to you so I am not mad at you,” George stated grabbing my hand to place a soft kiss on my palm; causing my knees to go weak.
“Of course he believes you,” Fred stated firmly.
I sighed and touched my cheek. It was red and swollen from Penelope slapping me
Charlie carefully opened the letter before reading it out loud:
“B-but surely there is someone more qualifies?” I argued how I could become a teacher when I had no experience.
Cedric’s P.O.V
Seamus’ P.O.V
“Wonder why he was here than,” Cedric said just as the great hall started to clear. Our group cleared out quickly, and went to our own courses. Draco was quick to grab my hand as we headed down to the dungeons for double potions with Severus.
“O-Ollie is that r-really you?” Percy stuttered staring at me with wide eyes shuffling his feet nervously.
“Of course
Elven looks like this:
“Correct you idiot, what the hell were you thinking trying to hex your own brother?” Charlie questioned.
“do you like thaat love?” George whispered as he pressed against the knot in my back, casuing to let out soft moans. George chuckled at my response and continued too massage that spot.
“C-Charlie…” Neville squeaked as he shot me a look of concern.
“Tell us about it then,” Charlie urged.
“I am well within my rights to talk to him however I want to isn’t that right slut!”  Jordan shouted causing Fred to flinch.
English looks like this: blah, blah, blah
I laughed as Oliver, once again, throw out his toast. He was trying to make me a nice light lunch but it seemed that every time he went near the simple appliances in the kitchenette they just seemed to stop working and spaz out.
Summary
Flashback
“How did you k-know I was submissive?” Viktor stuttered and it saddened me that he was so ashamed of his submissive side.
“HARRY POTTER HAS COMPLETED THE FIST TASK; FINSIHING WITH NEARLY A PERFECT SCORE!” Bagman announced as Harry stumbled into the champion’s tent looking very pale.
“Our brilliance on the pitch,” the twins stated in their usual fashion. The great hall finally resumed to normal, at least as normal for Hogwarts, order. The only thing that was off was the whispering about Ron; off until the angry man’s voice sounded from behind us.
“How much longer do you think Father and Harry will be?” I asked as I moved my queen; forcing Blaise to concede defeat as I had his king fully surrounded. Blaise just sighed, closed the chess set, and slumped back in his chair.
“P-papa,” I said as we reached the entrance of the Slytherin dorms.
Elven looks like this:
“T-thank you…” I whispered looking at the small blue eyed boy.
“Harry calm down everything will be just fine,” Cedric stated as he paced his strong hand on my shoulder.
“Where so you think Harry is?” I asked my twin on the way down to breakfast. We were walking with Dean, Seamus, Colin, Ron, and Hermione and they all seemed to be shocked by my question; at least Ron and Hermione were.
“Don’t scare them like that Dray,” Harry scolded softly as he grabbed Draco’s hand.
“Honestly I have absolutely no clue all I know is that Harry will not be going into this alone!” I stated.
“Of course not you silly little elf; I would never allow Dumbledore to remove you from mine of Mr. Diggory’s care. You are much too important to us to allow anything to even come close to hurting you,” Luscious said seriously. The man gave me a soft pat on my shoulder and smile, “now let’s go find you mate.”
“Lord Hades you have our word that your son will be protected.” I stated softly to the distraught father.
“Are you alright Colin? We weren’t too rough?” Dean asked as he pulled Colin so he was in between us on his stomach.
“Come on Harry,” I said pulling the shaken boy towards the doors of the great hall. Said boy gave a weak protested as I directed him towards the belly of the harsh Hogwarts gossip.
“You’re a veela?” George asked in shock.
Dean: Dominant Veela; Mated with Seamus and Colin.
“Why isn’t he waking up Dean?” Seamus whispered in a broken voice, his eyes red from crying.
“Oh Percy,” I whispered as Percy thrashed about in his sleep. He had been having nightmares since the first task, and the howlers did not help either. They had come from his mother, Clearwater, and surprisingly Albus Dumbledore himself. His mother was angry that he broke off the relationship with Clearwater to be with me, and she firmly believed that I had somehow brainwashed my sweet Percy into breaking things off with the bitch. The Bitch, Clearwater, just degraded him and reinforced any negative thing she had ever told Percy. Dumbledore was the most shocking, he stated that Percy must judge fair and not give Harry any special treatment. It sickened me that Dumbledore had plans for not only Harry, but for Percy as well. I know that he was the one that told Clearwater about me and Percy as it was the only way she could have found out, after all the girl was rather dense when it came to things like this. She was more book smart then she was street smart. Looking back down at my mate I vowed to bring down Dumbledore so we could have a bit of peace in our lives.
“W-what are you talking about Lee?” I asked as more pressure was applied to my shoulders causing me to wince and begin to struggle.
“What the hell!” Dean yelled as the door on the other side of the unused classroom opened. Hermione entered with Colin being dragged behind her by his wrist. He had a look of fear in his dazzling blue eyes that just didn’t sit well with me.
As I kissed my mate I noticed a bright light surrounding us. Neville didn’t seem to realise this, but I certainly did. It seems that magic itself had just blessed our bond. Pulling away from the younger boy I had to smile. Neville was completely flustered as he gave me a shy smile. “See you are special,” I whispered softly as someone knocked on the locked door.
“What the fuck is wrong with this tournament?!” Cedric growled as fury bloomed onto his face, “I understand that they expect us to be in danger, but how can they expect studdents who didn’t enter to fine with being thrown into danger aswell!”
“Well I was talking with Viktor Krum and he mentioned that he had Nymph blood, but that’s not the interesting part.  He mentioned that his blood called to one of the twins!” Seamus stated rather excited, and all while he was talking Lee’s face kept getting redder.
“I swear on my magic that I will always protect you and stand by your side,” with Oliver’s stated meant a dull glow surrounded him sealing his claim.
“HARRY!” George yelled running towards us; causing Harry to cower behind me in fear.
“Why a-after the t-tournament?”
As the two contacted Harry’s magic guardian, the adults in the room were in a very one sided argument. Dumbledore was insisting that Harry was lying and that they did not need his magic guardian; well Madame Maxime was calmly telling him to suck it. The rest of the once angry mob was watching, unimpressed with, the so called ‘greatest wizard alive’.
“MY problem! What’s Fred’s problem he is the one fucking the bloody enemy!” Shouted Lee giving me a scathing look.
“We haven’t seen him since he graduated from Hogwarts,” George stated.
“A water elf sir,” he whispers smiling shyly as my eyes go wide a bond forming between us. I watch as Harry gasps, “W-what was that…?”
“Sorry,” Cedric whispered as his face once again went blank. With this the Slythering common room settled into an uncomfortable silence.
“20 Gallons on Cedric!” A random Puff yelled as he placed his name on the list and threw his money in the box.
English looks like this: blah, blah, blah
“I accept your terms Sir Godric and I accept Lady Sprout as my headmistress,” the glowing woman stated her voice soft like a chime, before disappearing. The great hall was completely silent; and I was having a hard time believing what had just happened. Was Dumbledore truly gone?
“Master Malfoy, you must hide. Severus Snape is coming this way.” Draco barely had the time to duck under the bleachers before Snape came limping by.
Draco woke up in the hospital wing feeling much better. The last thing he remembered was Professor Snape asking him if he was alright.
“Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron, Hermione, and Draco froze, watching him.
“I’m Harry Potter.” Harry offered quietly, still looking at Ron.
“No. My parents were wizards. But they’re dead, you see.”
Harry could barely sleep that night, he was too excited by the news of becoming seeker, and he knew by tomorrow morning, the whole school would know too.
“That’s not true Neville. You’re being rude.” Neville looked surprised, but before he could say anything more-
His mother picked up the book with a smile on her face and added it to the pile of his presents. The next present, which he guessed was Ron’s from how messily it was wrapped, was a huge box of Bertie botts every flavor beans. He popped a red one in his mouth and smiled when he realized it was a cherry.
“Mom?” His mother’s eyes were still red.
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it then.” She sat down in the compartment with them and gazed importantly at Ron who looked a little more than peeved.
They were too late in trying to escape though, Harry heard the doors of the great hall opening and the chatter of voices as they came up the stairs. He gave a panicked glance at Draco before throwing his invisibility cloak at him. Right as the first students appeared down the hallways with the petrified cat and the glimmering, blood-red letters, Draco vanished under the glimmer of the invisibility cloak while Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood seemingly alone in the middle of the corridor.
“Is Granger your soulmate then?” She followed up, voice lower. He glared at her more vehemently still.
“Yes, my lady.” Dobby was quivering in fear.
“Have you had breakfast?” Draco asked again as they entered the grounds, heading quickly towards the cover of the trees that shaded them off from the rest of the castle, facing the lake.
He noticed Harry Hermione and Ron walking across the schoolyard and gave them a little wave, watching them hurry their pace until they were closer to Draco. He noticed both Ron and Hermione were sensibly wearing thick maroon and yellow scarves against the morning chill but Harry wasn’t. He unwound his own Slytherin scarf and handed it to Harry, who was already shivering a bit.
“I don’t think so. He’s still the Draco we befriended last year, Ron.” Ron nodded, looking thoughtful.
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.
“Meet me at the library tomorrow morning then?” Before Harry could respond, he heard a bell go off in the castle, signaling the end of lunch hour. Both boys scrambled up, gathering their book bags.
“Ensure nobody ever sees his soul mark. You will always be wherever my son is, even if not always seen.”
“Wait what about Filch,” Draco asked, confused.
Looking around, he realized all of his belongings were in there as well. The dark mahogany dresser his mother had fashioned for him and Narcissa stood not too far  from the bed, cluttered with a few perfumes of his and… were those bottles of fire whiskey? But where were Narcissa’s lipsticks and powders that always sat on the left side?
“Have you spoken to Ginny?” Fred asked Ron quietly a little bit into lunch. Ron shook his head, mouth half full of sandwich, and began searching for his sister, who was gazing down at her food looking depressed.
“Because he’s my friend, Harry!” Hermione saw Ron go a little red but knew that she couldn’t give away her secret to Draco and walked off instead. She walked past Pansy, who had been on her way out of the great hall with Millicent.
“Harry? Why?”
“Stop it.” Hermione was glaring at Harry. “You two need to talk this out.”
“Dobby what?”
The tryout itself was quite easy. He had to race a few of the existing members to test his speed and block a few bludgers to test his agility. He knew he had Marcus’ approval in those departments.
“Draco, sit here please.” She was gentler with Draco, which made Harry glare more.
As always, I absolutely love reading your comments!! Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me.
“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor; Ron, Hermione, and Draco clattering behind him.
“-Ron’s new too” He glanced at the youngest boy, who was tall and had a smattering of freckles all over his face. Harry smiled at the boy, and then looked at the woman.
You have a baby boy now, he reminded himself as he sat up. Undoubtedly Narcissa spent more time doting over Draco than on him. Even as this thought passed through his head, Lucius couldn’t exactly pinpoint how old Draco would be turning this year. One? Two?
Draco.
“Are you okay, Draco?”
“Can we be friends in secret then?” Draco looked at Harry for the first time, and Harry felt very warm suddenly.
“You should talk to Madam Pomfrey about your side if it’s bothering you,” Pansy said suddenly, making him glance at her and glare.
“I miss him.” She muttered in response, wishing, not for the first time in the past few months, that her husband was not a Death Eater.
Harry himself was late, considering he had been paired with Neville, who couldn’t brew anything at all with Snape watching over him, willing him to fail.
Harry loved Hagrid’s flute and blew on it a little before unwrapping the fifty pence the Dursley’s had sent. Ron was absolutely fascinated by the piece of muggle money.
“Go on. Open it.” Harry ripped open the paper as carefully as possible to reveal a pair of gloves with his name embroidered on one of them with gold thread.
“Gold for the golden boy,” Draco responded. Harry playfully jabbed Draco’s side but didn’t take the bait.
July 31st, 1992.
He took a last look at Draco before he followed professor McGonagall.
“Oh, Hey Hermione!” One of the Weasley’s had appeared behind them and was glaring right at Draco. “Leave her alone, Malfoy!” Draco had barely gotten a word out before he was hexed violently, throwing him several feet away from Hermione.
“I’ll ask Dobby to find somewhere,” Draco responded quietly.
“They were, ‘arry.”
enough to beat the current one, who is, might I add, a fourth year.” The man was gone before Draco could say or ask anything more.
Harry slid out of bed as quietly as possible, sliding into his dressing gown and slippers before quietly slipping out of the boys’ dorm. He didn’t notice Hermione buried under a pile of books as he passed by, in too much of a hurry to get out. In the dark hallways, he clutched the lamp he stole off a wall and kept an eye out for Filch or his cat.
“Yeah, just, felt like someone pushed me several feet onto the floor there.” He rubbed his side, feeling the pain ebb from a phantom wound.
“I hate it here.”
He clutched his trolley tightly and glanced into Hedwig’s amber eyes. They looked back at him as if she were offering comfort. Harry had been delighted when Hagrid had gotten him the white snowy owl as a birthday present, he had always longed for an animal companion but it was not a possibility with the Dursely's. He was glad he took some time to calm down because his ears immediately picked up a nearby conversation,
Narcissa certainly hadn't expected Draco's soul mark to appear for a good while, a baby only got his soul mark if their soul mate was already born. She had been born with Lucius' name on her wrist, but she knew he hadn't gotten hers until the day she was born when he was almost two years old.
“That’s the last time I’m telling you the Slytherin password, Harry.” Draco grumbled, but Harry could not hear anything the older boy said. Draco watched Harry for a little while, and was about to drift back to sleep himself when Harry shifted and his shirt rode up. For the first time in his life, Draco saw his name etched onto Harry’s bronzed skin.
“Bullocks. She could have stayed. She’s my soul mate for Merlin’s sake!” Harry stood up to find his robes from his trunk to change, wondering what he could say to make Ron feel a little better.
“Okay, look. Here’s what we do. Let’s go talk to a Prefect and see if they can help?” Hermione nodded, and he let her lead the way to the prefect’s cabin.
“Yes. He even had a bite on his leg. AND he tried to kill Harry at the quidditch match.” Ron glared at the fire.
“You’re so lucky. I barely knew about magic until a month ago.” As much as Draco wanted to interject and disagree with Harry, he didn’t. He supposed he
“I mean, it’s been months since the mark appeared, the Malfoys haven’t said a word, and we haven’t heard that the Dark Lord knows either.”
When she had first married Lucius and moved into his home, she had been terribly lonely in the giant mansion, especially with Lucius gone for extended periods of time doing the Dark Lord's bidding. The solarium in the eastern wing of the mansion, closest to her rooms, was one of the places she had spent the most time in, furthest away from where Lucius' death eater friends would gather, showing her the entire night sky without obstruction. She hadn't had much of an interest in Astronomy when she had been at Hogwarts, despite being named after a constellation herself, but after more than a few nights spent gazing at the night sky alone, her interests had been reawakened.
“Dobby.” The elf appeared before him before he could move to get out of bed.
“Mister Zabini,” A familiar, cool drawl interrupted Blaise, who immediately sat up from his chair. “I believe you are late for dinner. Hurry along.” Blaise stood up to leave, but pointed at a box of chocolates he had brought that were on his bedside table before disappearing behind the curtain.
and stared at Ron.
Harry woke up on Wednesday feeling miserable and empty. He glanced over at Ron’s bed almost instinctively and sighed when he noticed that the curtains were drawn tightly around Ron’s bed. He stared out at the school grounds for a while before groggily getting out of bed. No one in the boy’s dormitory was up yet, and Harry made no sound as he went about getting ready for the day, pulling on a knitted Gryffindor sweater over his school shirt because he felt a bit chilly.
“You are expected to be here before me,” Snape said silkily, glaring at Hermione. “Five points from Gryffindor.” The three went in boiling with rage.
“Meet me by the lake.” The boy was gone before Harry could say anything more. Harry hurriedly climbed up the stairs of the dungeon, and instead of moving towards the great hall, he took a hallway to the left to the courtyard and out towards the lake.
“Mother, I can explain, it's not-“ She held up a finger to his lips as she carried a heaping plate full of pancakes to the breakfast table. He followed with a pitcher of juice.
“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” Pansy spat.
“Happy Christmas,” Ron told Harry sleepily as he scrambled out of bed and pulled on his dressing gown. It was nearly a week since Draco had left, and Harry was missing him terribly.
After Potions, Draco sped away from his friends and headed towards his spot with Harry, surprised to see Ron was with him. He noticed the
“Why can’t Dumbledore magic it away?” He suddenly asked Harry, who stopped beside him to watch Filch as well. Harry shrugged, watching the man teetering on the edge of a ladder.
“Isn’t Gringotts supposed to be unbreakable?” Harry asked curiously.
“We should meet
His answer came in the form of a familiar head of curls peeking in through their cabin door.
“Hello. Sandwich?” Harry helped himself to one, noticing two bottles of pumpkin juice next to the plate as well. They didn’t talk for the longest time, just stared out into the lake while they ate, enjoying each other’s company. Harry sensed that Draco wanted to talk but didn’t rush him. He realized he missed the boy who couldn’t quite shut up back at Madam Malkin’s.
May 4th, '21.
The next morning, Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione were standing near the quidditch pitch. It was absolutely freezing and Hermione had conjured a bright blue fire in a jar as the four of them poured over Draco’s copy of
“Oh for the love of Merlin.” Remus got up and walked to the kitchen.
The fat lady bode him good morning as he strode down to the great hall, which only had a scattered few fifth years studying for their OWLs. They paid Harry no attention as he grabbed himself some toast and hightailed out of there, straight to the library.
“Hi, Ron.” She felt a little guilty she had offered her soulmate no explanation as to why she had been talking to Draco, but it wasn’t like she and Draco had been conspiring on abandoning Harry and Ron and running away together.
He read until his wristwatch told him it was time for his first class of the day.
“Do wizards have names written on them?” Harry went a bit red at the question and stumbled to rephrase it. “I mean, like the name of another Wizard on them?”
Something in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do believe me, don’t you?” He glanced first at Draco, although his question was directed at Ron.
books in the library.
“Did she just leave?” Ron asked in the general direction of the door. Harry didn’t know how to answer, and the crestfallen look on Ron’s face made him wish he hadn’t wished for Hermione to go away.
“What did she say?”
“Thank you, Draco.” The two boys sat in silence for a while, mostly looking at the pictures, and Draco explaining something to Harry every now and again. Somewhere through the night, a blanket had found itself onto their laps, and Harry had fallen asleep cuddled to Draco’s side not soon after.
“Did you catch up with Hermione?” He asked as he took his book bag back and they entered the greenhouse.
“My name’s Ron Weasley,” Ron said a little louder, looking at her right in the eye. Harry wondered if he was missing something.
I laughed as my twin tackled Charlie. It was the first time since we found out what Percy has been through that they acted like children and it was truly a nice sight.
“Of course I will he will never be hurt again as long as I have a say. Dragon’s mate for life,” I stated pulling Neville closer to me.
“What, but they said to send up green sparks when we found it,” I state feeling scared.
I sighed and kicked another pebble; Dean and Seamus had gotten detention and Lee was being an ass so I had no one to talk to or hang out with. Taking a walk seemed like a good ideas so I bundled up and headed out to the beach of the black lake. It surprised me to see how possessive Lee was of the twins; it was almost as if he was one of the twins’ dominants well at least if he was Fred’s dominant.
“C-Calm down, calm down? Please d-don’t tell me to calm down. I have to face a dragon with little chance of surviving.” I stated as strongly as I could.
“Then Mr. Potter wasn’t lying he really didn’t enter himself.”
“Hello Percy,” I stated as Charlie brought my sleepy mate into the sitting room. The sound of my voice made Percy jump and face me; giving Charlie a chance to leave the room as Percy was distracted.
“Attention Students; please return to you houses for the night,” McGonagall called, “except for you Mr. Zabini.”
“Seamus!” Colin squeaked at the sight.
“How did you k-know I was submissive?” I stuttered in shock.
; you still have all your other friends. Just forget about those two,” Draco murmured as he wrapped his arms around Harry; the shaken boy sinking into the welcoming comfort instantly.
“I’m sorry for yelling please Harry look at me,” I whispered softly.
“The tall red haired man pulled him towards that room,” one of the Ravenclaw boys replied before I had a chance to scoff at the ancient man.
“I don’t give a shit what you think Granger!” Dean howlered at the bushy haired witch. Seamus had already pulled me into his lap and was glaring at Ron and his opionated girlfriend. Said girlfirend had just called the relationship a sin.
Seamus: Dominant Veela; mated with Dean and Colin.
“H-he is right S-Seamus,” a soft voice croaked. Gasping Seamus and I turned towards Colin’s bed to see him looking straight at us, “w-where are w-we?”
“Thank you.” Salazar whispered to Regulus who held Blaise.
“Harry’s inheritance,” Cedric replied.
“SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH YOU LITTLE SHIT!” a large red haired man bellowed as I finally made my way out of the bedroom and into the living room. Sitting there was the three boys most responsible for my pain, my potions professor, Oliver Wood, and two unknown red heads.
Dumbledore: Was bonded to Grindelwald, and because he was the one to defeat him he has lost most of his mental capacity to grief. He is currently responsible for all the stress and abuse that has been placed on Harry.
“Silence you incompetent fool! The poor boy has suffered from abuse his entire life and you have the audacity to call his an attention seeker! Let me be clear the board of governors will be hearing of this,” Lucius stated coldly as he stalked out with an unconscious Harry in his arms.
“You don’t even deserve to be our brother; you know what Ronald, Harry didn’t even enter this stupid tournament! Someone who wants him dead entered him in this stupid game,” George yelled and turned his back on Ron. Said boy turned as red as his famous hair as he motioned to grab his wand to curse the twins when someone grabbed his arm stopping the possible deadly situation.
“L-Lord Hades!” Godric stuttered causing me to gasp. What did one of the most powerful entities in the world want with us?
The young elf nods before in a surprising move hugging me around my waist and burying his face against my chest. I look down at him a run a pale hand threw his hair.
“He will be alright The. Remember Draco and Cedric made sure he knew everything and anything he would need to know,” Fred said as he and his twin sat down beside Dean, Seamus, and Colin. There was another surprising thing Harry had managed to form a close alliance with both the Snakes and a bunch of select Lions.
Flashback
I laighed as Draco and his father argued over dinne. Draco wanted to go to the Malfoy manor, and his father wanted to go out. I really didn’t care as long as I was able to be with my makeshift family.
“Yes my mate the only one that can complete my soul. May I know your name?” I ask softly.
“I am sure that he will wake up soon love and we will be here when he does,” I said softly as I took Seamus’ hand in my own. Giving him as much comfort as I could in the situation.
“I would get off him!” A voice growled causing me to look up at the most handsome person I had ever scene.
“Well Blaise I am pleased to finally meet you and I wish to welcome you to the black Manor,” I stated grandly taking Blaise’s soft hands in my own, “I will not pressure you to stay her, but I wish to at least be able to get to know you my mate.”
With lots of laughs Fred.
Harry’s P.O.V
“I must apologize, Lord Malfoy, the tournament is magically binding; he must participate or Mr. Potter will have his magic stripped of him,” Bagman stated sadly and my heart dropped in my stomach. If I lost my magic I would die.
Clearwater has been slowly destroying the little confidence that Percy had, and he has finally broken it off, but it has him a little shaken up.
“ALBUS DUMBLERDORE! GET OFF MY THRONE!” was bellowed as two imposing figures entered the great hall. The taller of the two was a mass of Muscle. He had shaggy, long brown hair that was tied back with a deep red ribbon, and startling black eyes. He wore old fashioned robes that looked something like a knight would wear, and a giant Scythe was strapped to his back. The other man had loose flowing black hair, piercing green eyes, and Greek inspired robes. His body was surrounded by an ethereal glow almost as if he came down from heaven itself.
“I do not care zat you t’ink he is lying we can proceed with’ out hiz magic guardian!” Maxine yelled in anger as three people came and joined the group; one of them obviously very shaken.
Oliver: Dominate wood elf who is going to be mated to Percy. Due to meddling from Dumbledore, Molly, and Penelope they were broken up.
“S-sorry I h-have no idea w-were they have gone o-off to,” I stuttered feeling bad for lying to them.
Fred’s P.O.V
Seamus’ P.O.V
“Do they vant us back in de hall?” Viktor the champion of Durmstrang asked.
“Are you alright Harry?” I asked pulling the shaken boy to the couch and onto my lap. He tensed at first but relaxed almost immediately.
“I’m a-alright D-dray; j-just shaken u-up,” he replied softly and laid his head on my shoulder.
“Harry!” a heavily accented voice called. Turning around I found Viktor running towards me. I took off sprinting towards my fellow Submissive and crashed into him my arms wrapping around his neck. Viktor’s arms wrapped around me, both of us breathing heavily. “I am so glad I found you. The cup, I found it, but it has the same magic signature as a portkey…”
Draco: He is a dominate male Veela; who’s family saves Harry with the help of the Diggory’s.
English looks like this: blah, blah, blah
“Because I know you want to help Harry and that the other judges won’t be fair like you will.”
Elven looks like this:
“Hello Neville, are you feeling alright?” Augusta Longbottom asked softly as she pulled my into a tight hug. A safe and familiar warmth surrounded me allowing me to relax slightly, not completely though, but enough that some of the tension left my body.
“Come on Draco we should get this over with as soon as possible,” Cedric stated as he pushed the door to the great hall open and entered the deafeningly silent room. The rest of us followed as he led us over to the snakes’ side of the room where the delegation from Durmstrang was eating. The whispers of cheating came prominently for the Gryffindor side.
“No I stopped him in time but that is why we were away for the day,” Regulus stated not missing a beat.
“Why exactly were you gone?” Mad-eye asked in suspicion, “what are ye’ planning boy!”
Flashback
“I love as well my Little Dragon.”
“Okay Dray,” Harry mumbled as I passed the entrance to my father’s chambers. The family wing of the Malfoy manner was compromised of 10 rooms in total. The master bedroom, my room, 2 other slightly smaller bedrooms, the nursery, the mistress room, the master bath, the smaller guest bath, the office, and a communal living area. Harry and I had just come from the communal living area and were headed to my room. This was rather unusual for an unbonded couple to be allowed to share a rom let alone a bed, however after much trial and error I had discovered that my little mate actually slept through the night if he had someone to hold him and keep the nightmares away.
“Calm down the headmaster has decided that their punishment is simply for them to apologize to each other. I am sorry Charlie there was nothing I could do,” Severus snapped as he pulled me over to the unwanted guests. I glared at the boys as I was forced to sit beside my brother. How could their only punishment be to apologize, it was because of them that my mate was in a healing sleep. The only positive I could take from the situation is that the blonde little shit was covered in bandages.
“FRED!” Lee shouted as he came running towards me, his face as red as my hair, “Why the fuck are you talking to Viktor Krum!”
“Very well,” the headmistress sighed, “I am reluctant, but I will consent as I feel it is best for Blaise to remain with you,” Sprout stated and told us all that we were allowed to leave and that my room would be ready by tomorrow. Blaise gave me a small smile as he pulled me along to the Slytherin Common rooms for the night.
“H-how?” Dean choked out in utter shock.
“Come here Colin,” I said softly. The shy boy gave Seamus a small glance before moving over to me, wrapping his arms around my waist and barring in face in my chest, “don’t worry little blue eyes nothing will happen to you. I nor Seamus will never let anything hurt you again.”
“w-welcome back m-my lord,” Wormtail stutter and I shot him a look of disgust. Out of all my followers he was the one I hated the most.
I smile and feed Harry another chocolate covered strawberry. The little elf seemed to love anything chocolate and I was more than happy to indulge him. After all the heartbreak Harry had suffered I had not the mind or wish to deny him any that he wants. Plus he completely adorable eating sweet’s, “another love?”
Author’s P.O.V
“Some friends you are,” Seamus called as he grabbed Colin’s hand and pulled him towards the great hall Dean following as they left me and George with Ron and Hermione.
“So that’s why you are so protective of Harry; you’re his mate,” Dean stated proudly, causing me to chuckle.
Author’s P.O.V
“I’m s-sorry for h-hiding form you,” I whispered feeling shame for my actions.
“Good afternoon my boy,” Dumbledore greeted with fake kindness as he glared at my mate Oliver. His whole demeanor gave me chills, “Now where is Mr. Longbottom? We need to resolve this farce so that there kind boys can get back to their studies.”
“Yeah bright eyes, without you Dean and I would have been expelled,” Seamus stated and joined the hug.
“Cedric’s right Harry me and Gred will even volunteer as your bodyguards!” George exclaimed.
“Ric I feel dizzy,” Salazar whispered as one of the merpeople that was guarding our prison brought us food. Salazar my only light had in the last couple decades begun to weaken. He lost weight, his once beautiful silver wings had lost their glow as well as feathers had begun to fall out, and he was barely able to move most days. Unfortunately we were immortal and the only things that would end our suffering was our hearts being ripped from out chests and burned.
Elven looks like this:
“Take me,” Percy whispered and it sent fire through my veins. I needed not to be told twice. I attacked Percy’s neck; laying kisses and small bite marks in my wake. I nibbled my way up to his lips and sealed them in a passionate kiss cutting off the beautiful moans coming from the perfect submissive beneath me. Carefully I opened the button down shirt he wore and ran my hand down his chest; brushing over his now pebbled nipples causing him to arch off the bed.
“Your mannerisms give it away Viktor, and I personally believe that you mate won’t care that you don’t look like the stereotypical submissive,” Colin stated and Viktor began to sniffle. Even though I has tried to reassure him it would hit harder coming from what looked like the stereotypical submissive.
Chapter 5
“I believe you Colin,” Harry whispered as he stood up and pulled me into a loose hug. My body froze for a split second before I wrapped my arms around Harry and the tear gates opened soaking into his shirt, “don’t cry Colin.”
“E-Elf…” the boy stuttered as I froze. An elf, but that would mean one of his parents had elf blood or was an elf themselves. It was one of the worst offences in the magical world to kill an elf, a being of complete purity. Snapping my fingers the boy was released as he fell into my arms; he squirmed slightly but still and tensed.
“Don’t worry about them little brother you have me, Fred, George, and Draco to protect you,” Cedric stated proudly as everyone around them nodded.
“Got that right mate,” Fred stated happily as George nodded in agreement with his brother.
“Why are you defending him; he is nothing but a Griffindork!” Goyle stated.
Harry: is a water elf so emotions and high stress affect him in a very bad way; because he didn’t not have a connection with his parents he is not able to bond with many people; it was only when he found his mate that he began to be able to cope with stress and negative emotions.
“What about you?” Harry suddenly found the ground very interesting.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and Goyle.” Draco watched Harry intently before he revealed who he was. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” If Harry recognized him at all, he didn’t respond. He only stared at Draco as if they didn’t have each other’s names written on them. His friend, however, had the audacity to snigger.
“Give me the letter, Hermione.” He whisper-yelled at her.
Narcissa read the letter twice before penning her reply. She had almost handed the letter to the familiar dark feathered owl when the upstairs study door opened with a bang. She abandoned her desk, stood up hastily, and fixed her hair before going to face her husband.
the entire Slytherin team was holding. He felt angry, he felt like Draco had bought his way into the team, but he knew how well Draco had played quidditch when they used to fly together, and he knew Draco was capable of holding his own in the pitch.
Passing through the barrier felt like everything and nothing at the same time. He kept his eyes wide open, and at one moment, he was heading towards a brick wall, and the next he was gazing at a scarlet steam engine.
Hello! Sorry about this one being kind of short, but I'm getting back into the groove of writing.
Terence was too far away to even realize he had caught it when he finally did. He could hear the cheers from his housemates when he landed on the ground, snitch in hand.
“What? No? Did you see how bitter Snape was when we won?”
“Let’s go visit this Harry Potter then.” Draco chimed in with a grin.
“Neither Ron nor Harry got in the train.” She sounded more worried than she appeared. He squeezed her shoulder gently, trying to think of ways to find out where Harry or Ron were.
“Draco, please tell me?” Harry felt a little desperate.
“What?”
“She’s always all over Ron Weasley.” Pansy continued with a smirk. Draco still hadn’t bit into the thirteenth tart. Blaise was still chewing on his tenth. “And Harry Potter.” Her voice became lower, still. Draco glared down at the tart.
He got his reply during breakfast as he and Ron were discussing what the three-headed dog may have been guarding under the trap door. Neither Neville nor Hermione seemed to be interested, and Hermione was refusing to talk to them again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You didn’t have to be mean and steal Neville’s Remembrall you know?”
“I read about soulmates, but I didn’t think I would meet mine so soon.” There, along her right index finger, was the name
“Harry, not all Slytherins are bad,”
“Yes,” Harry replied, trying his best to sound like he belonged.
“Come help me in the kitchen, son.” Draco followed his mother, dread growing.
Harry wasn’t surprised Draco had put Dobby up to stealing all his letters. Of course, that’s what Draco would do, on Harry’s birthday too. Harry laughed at himself for having held on to the hope that Draco would have sent something for him, no that didn’t sound like Draco at all. Draco was a Slytherin, just like Voldemort.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter! Things will definitely pick up in the next, and I'll sneak some fluff in, depending on how temperamental Draco and Harry are going to be.
“Your
“Son,” Lucius looked down at Draco, “I know neither you nor your mother are ready to tell me about your soulmate, but whenever you are, I’m here. And I’m not going away again.” Draco really wanted to tell his father, more than anything on the planet, but he couldn’t think of the words right now, and as much as he loved his father, as much as he had grown to slowly welcome this man back into his life, he wasn’t sure if he would risk Harry, even if he didn’t have Harry. “And have a good time. I will write to you.”
“I need one today!” Hermione seemed a little frantic, so Harry went to her to help look for anything about the chamber of secrets that none of them had been able to pull up any information on.
“She offered me a biscuit.” Harry couldn’t stop laughing at that.
Draco almost didn’t take the bait, but Goyle’s stare on him felt red hot. He remembered his father's pureblood ideologies, and he was surprised at himself how easily the words slipped out of his mouth. “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.” He sounded just like his father.
“Where have you been mate?” Ron asked Harry again as he showed up at lunch, later on, looking a little flustered. He noticed Draco inconspicuously slide into his place between Crabbe and Goyle and quickly tore his gaze away.
He suddenly heard tiny footsteps and sat up in bed. Through a gap in his bed curtains, Harry could see that Ron was fast asleep in his own bed, and reached for his wand under the pillow. Before he could do anything, a piece of parchment floated onto his lap, and he immediately knew it wasn’t an invader in their dorm, but Dobby.
“Yes, Draco! You were amazing.” Pansy grinned as they entered. Draco felt hungrier than he had felt in ages as he dug into his food.
“Hey mate, how long have you been here?” Blaise shrugged, showing Draco a book he had been reading.
As Harry followed the squat witch to the back of the shop, he noticed a pale blond boy standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Harry thought he looked beautiful but said nothing as he got fitted himself.
“Hey mum, guess what? Guess who we met on the train?” One of the twins spoke excitedly to the plump woman after Harry had gotten situated inside. Scared the entire platform had heard, Harry ducked out of the way.
“’arry?”
Mr. Borgin didn’t miss a beat before he demanded “Thirty galleons, per person.”
“Momma!” Draco squealed as a violet jet poured out. Narcissa made a giant gesture of gasping and clapping, which thrilled Draco.
Draco spent Wednesday afternoon with Blaise and Pansy practising his quidditch. He felt too sad to sit in one place and read or write, and he knew that Hermione wouldn’t be able to corner him anywhere and demand him to apologize or become friends with Harry again while he was surrounded by Slytherins.
“They’re quidditch gloves!” Ron exclaimed, grinning at Harry as he tried it on.
“Hello?” Harry had woken up to a silhouette of a woman near Hedwick’s cage, but before he could get to his glasses, it was gone.
“He did just fine last year, facing the dark lord.”
“Why did this happen? How did this happen?”
“You look stressed, daughter,” Abraxas commented from his armchair, putting the book he was reading down.
“Narcissa!” Lucius looked older than his real age, grey streaks in his blonde hair.
“No ‘mione. Where do you reckon he is?” He was hoping that this meant that Hermione was going to be friends with Harry again. Ron knew that Harry’s actions and been wrong, but he also knew that abandoning Harry while he tried to become a better person wasn’t that great of an idea either. Before either one of them could come up with an idea as to where Harry could be, the portrait door opened and in came Harry, carrying a bag rival to Hermione’s with books.
“I accept your apology, Harry.” Harry gave a teary smile and moved towards Draco who stepped away again. “But I still need some time.” Harry’s eyes widened; he could feel his smile slide away.
Fifteen minutes later, Draco followed Dobby up several staircases, coming to a stop in front of a painting of a wizard in pink and grey robes. At first, there was only a bare wall, but before his very eyes, a door materialized, and Draco was led into it. Inside it was a circular table, spilling with all kinds of delicious food. Four places were set.
“I bet he was at the library,” Ron said, feeling extremely sorry for his best mate. “Doesn’t it close at eight? He was probably kicked out by Madam Pince.” They both watched Harry get situated in a corner, several books spread before him before glancing at each other again.
“You can’t make him choose!” Harry raged.
He was looking at Draco, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes. Harry knew Ron was being rude intentionally because Draco had told Harry he wanted space, but he didn’t want Ron to be rude to Draco.
Irma Pince nodded, knowing that Pansy Parkinson would have a hard time finding books that weren’t jinxed or hexed within the library for the rest of her school career.
“I’m a Slytherin, Harry.” Draco joked
Draco and Harry become best friends, and Draco is slowly introduced into the golden trio's friend group.
The muggles were eating dinner when Narcissa apparated into their living room, shrouded in an invisibility cloak. She stared at them for several seconds, wondering if Hermione had given a wrong address but then decided that Harry wouldn’t have been able to sit at a dinner table in his state anyway.
“No. She wasn’t at lunch either.” The two boys situated themselves towards the back as they watched students filter in through the doors. Ron looked away when Hermione came in as well. “A note came for you during lunch by the way.” Ron handed Harry a folded piece of parchment that contained Hagrid’s invitation to tea.
They sat panting next to each other for a while, legs still intertwined. “What’s my colour then?” Harry asked Draco, his gaze on the cloudless blue sky above them.
“She isn’t.” His response would have been more believable if a note from Hermione, shaped like a bird, hadn’t floated up to him right at that moment.
Lilly laughed as her husband and son chased each other shirtless through the halls of their house. The name of Harry’s soulmate sparkled with the light against his skin.
