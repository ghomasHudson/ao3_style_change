It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Persephone knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
“Elizabeth, please!” She cried out, feeling as though her lungs were becoming smaller and smaller, “How—how did you die?!” She needed anything to distract her.
She took the key and turned to McGonagall, who was staring with raised brows. “Very well done, Miss Potter.”
Immediately, Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, and he was frozen where he lay on the couch. Hermione ran to him and peered over him.  Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.
She sat at the Gryffindor table, her chin in her palm and her book open in front of her. Her other hand was halfway to her mouth with a spoon of hot oatmeal but she was yawning and her eye closed for half a second and then Hermione was shaking her awake, “We’re going to be late!”
She remembered the eyes and refused to let it go, “Is that why you transferred to Hogwarts? Because you’re old school found out?”
When finally she caught her breath, Persephone leaned up against the wall and sighed, “It is so much more fun doing that then it is just having a normal lunch. If losing house points gets you to have fun like this—” She shook her head, staring up.
She squawked awake and then saw Persephone and started squeaking excitedly. She ran across the room, trying to hush the bird but it was too late. She heard a grunt in the next room and then a shift in the floorboards—someone was awake.
She listed off several symptoms—mood swings, fatigue, weakness, sensitivity to heat, losing weight without trying, very easily, bowel movements, shaking hands, sleep problems, changes in your menstrual cycle. She had no shame in listing any of these off and Persephone, blushing, replied with, “I guess…mood swings, yes, and I’ve always been skinny, so…my hands to tend to shake a lot, and sometimes I can’t sleep…I’ve had, um,” She glanced at the teachers, “Panic attacks…several.”
At first, when Persephone picked it up, she thought it ought to go around someone’s neck rather than on the head. Then, when she foolishly and without thinking it through, placed it on her head, she thought that it only should belong on the head, worn almost like a crown or tiara.
She wandered out of the house under the pretense of taking care of the garden, humming. The flowers pressed out of the earth at her humming, turning to her as she passed.
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen."
She jumped from the tops of the bookshelves, hopping from aisle to aisle, until she was above the one glowing red. She took the invisibility cloak off, and tucked it safely into her bag. Closing her eyes, she asked permission from the air, and took a leap faith—literally.
As always, she woke in the early morning and swiftly dressed herself, as to not make noise. The library opened early in the mornings during summer. She planned on researching the school—she had packed her laptop into a book bag brief case. Maybe there would be a letter—maybe she can meet the postman halfway up the street?
He thought for a moment, “Good…very good. Putting family first. You’ve done well this evening—got us the deal from those freaks…I suppose there are worse things to be. But I said no magic in the house—I will not forget this.”
The owl hopped closer. She didn’t know how to pay him, as she didn’t recognize the coins. “Hold on—I’ll pay you in a moment, but I don’t recognize—” She huffed in frustration. She was failing the magician—sorry,
She skidded to a stop, her feet touching the ground into a run and then a walk, her hand still clutching the Remebrall tightly.
“Uuh, Seph?” Ben said—Hades said? “Is it an accident that you didn’t tell me that singing after a first full moon could have fatal consequences?”
Persephone had never been good with animals. She was much better with her computer and technology and the likes. She wondered if most witches had computers. Would she be allowed her computer?
Ron suddenly did not want anything from this place and turned to Persephone, grimacing. She gulped, “Actually, we’re hoping for some directions—to Hogwarts.”
She blinked and looked down, “Oh, yes—observant,” She noted. “I haven’t been wearing my glasses and I suppose I’ve damaged my eyes further, hm?” She tried to pass it off as a joke but she was starting to panic—she couldn’t even properly see the outlines of their legs!
“Can I borrow this?” She asked and he nodded immediately, flushing. She smiled, and thanked him, before rushing out.
“It’s the full moon,” He said. “And you’re in the middle of the forest, about to kill Draco Malfoy—look, I know he’s annoying but that doesn’t give you the right to—”
Persephone chose to give her lenience and fought a much needed smile, “There’s barely enough for one of us—listen, you take the one that will bring you back. You get Ron and get out of the trapdoor with the brooms from the flying- key room. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Quirrell off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really."
“It’ll be worse for both of you if Malfoy tells so the best thing to do is set him free,” She said as sympathetically as she could. “Ron’s got a brother whose studying dragons in Romania, haven’t you Ron?”
“Hey!” Persephone whispered excitedly—she didn’t think raising her voice above that of a whisper was appropriate for this setting—stepping closer, “You’re here!”
That was the first unbelievable thing that had happened that summer. It led to Mary walking her through the workings of a bank, which were much more complex than the wizarding banks. She walked her through how to withdraw, and how to make cards and handle such things. She had to explain several different times but Persephone thought she got it by the fourth time.
The only sound that followed was the sprinkling of the water. George was breathing heavily under Persephone, his arms still tight around hers. Ron was there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Persephone trusted Ron not to lose—he had never lost a game that she had witnessed. They could not possibly lose—McGonagall’s Transfiguration was nothing against Ron’s chess skills.
Surprisingly, Amanda had gotten her something as well. Amanda had gotten her some shoes, white converse obviously meant for later in spring. The two hadn’t properly spoken but she hoped Amanda like the trinkets she’d gotten her.
She looked around wildly—the corridor was too narrow to simply shrink against the wall. She could either wait here to be trample or…or could she possible hide behind the suit of armor…or…or—oh! A chance!
“Nearly,” She mumbled. While her parents seemed awful, what with the way aunt Petunia rarely spoke of them, Persephone didn’t really think her aunt and uncle were any better, other than the fact that they kept her. Up until a year ago, she lived in the cupboard under the stairs. Then, Dudley’s friend had said something to their parents’ about Dudley’s messy little cousin and the Dursley’s ‘moved’ her into the smallest bedroom of the house.
“Of everything that lurks in there, which includes werewolves and giant spiders?” Or so she was told, “Yes! I am! Breaking a huge school rule? Even more so!”
A crack and then she spun, ignoring the stares. Dobby was sitting inside the car, on her trunk in the back. Quickly, Ron and Persephone got back in the car in the front, spinning back to stare at the house-elf. “You weren’t kidding, he really is—”
“Oh, Draco, hush—for how much you talk about her in the common room, I’d say you’re her number one fan.”
“Aha,” Mr. Weasley said with grim satisfaction. “So he’s worried…oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something…”
She was sure none of the Dursleys were up yet. She stuck her hand through the mail slot and extended her hand to reach the lock. Unlocking the door, she very slowly opened the door and stepped across the threshold.  Quickly and silently, she closed the door behind them and took her suitcase and her book bag over her should and running up the stairs.
“Mr. Malfoy, it is a pleasure to greet you again,” His voice was as oily as his hair, “Delighted—and the young Master Malfoy, too—charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced—”
They went through chocolate frogs, Ron interested in eating the frogs while Persephone examined her cards—she’d now was in possession of not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin, the latter being the most famous wizard in all of wizard history. She'd read that.
It lasted a whole period—she felt worse afterwards. Her head was throbbing and she was losing her voice from the damned incident. Her chest trembled, like sobs were still waiting to trail out of her throat. She was still trembling and her hair was a mess. She felt so weak.
Her mind was then filled with information—she was lost in facts about the cold war, of prime ministers and or presidents, of a plane carrying rugby team crashing into Wales, of so, so, so many things, ranging from 1950 to 1960.
“It isn’t my fault,” Draco retorted. “I’ve told you that Persephone Potter gets all she wants by being famous and that Hermione Granger is a teacher’s pet—”
She felt her face heat up, “Ew—for Cedric? Not possible.” He continued grinning. “Besides he’s older than me.”
Then she was splashed with water. She blinked, looking up and seeing Ron standing, an empty water jug in hand. He was reaching over the table and blinked.
They made their way down under the invisibility cloak, trying not to trip over it. Despite Hermione being slightly taller than Persephone, the cloak still had a lot of unused parts, a whole train behind them. This proved to be a struggle when they came across Peeves, who was bouncing against the walls in the entrance hall. By the time they had gotten out of the castle and down to Hagrid’s hut, Hagrid had Norbert ready to go in a large crate.
“Wonder what that was about?” Lavender raised a brow at Persephone. She shrugged. “Is that a letter from a secret admirer, Lily?”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly indented box. Persephone couldn’t stop her trembling fingers but she managed to open it. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with
“Not at all—what? Can’t bake?” She pouted. “Mommy and Daddy cook for you? Do they spoon feed you too?”
“You did at least five years of ballet for that joint movement, you must have!” She said, putting in another bobby pin.
Cedric held a higher note, an impressively higher note, a faster one, and she stared at him with her mouth dropped open.
found out how to get past Fluffy. Besides, Snape nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry and Quirrell’s too much of a coward. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."
Mrs. Weasley and Mrs. Diggory came to a well given compromise of Persephone’s living arrangements—every day at ten, she would be picked up by Cedric and his mum for the dance intensive and be brought back by six. Despite his easy-going attitude and ability to make friends with anyone, Cedric insisted on they’re being each other’s dance partners.
"He’s not,” Persephone cut her off immediately. “He’s going to be perfectly alright.” She changed the subject with a hard gulp. “We’ve seen Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms…what’s next?”
She was a perfect, perfect piece of both of them—beautiful like her mother but with hints of her father. Persephone looked so childlike now, despite her beauty, but her mother had a sense of mature beauty, with the way her eyes and brows arched. She was sure she would grow to be such a mature beauty like her mother—but the resemblance presently was hurting, aching, eating at her.
“P is for Persephone, Fred, or, better yet, P for piss off, Freddie!” She cried while laughing. “P for prank goddess. P for
Five minutes later, when she met Ron and Hermione outside of the library, they both shook their heads. Persephone sighed, stroking Salem’s head as they went off to lunch.
She frowned, “You don’t need to be prefects to be recognizable as brilliant,” She told them, throwing both legs over one side of the broom. “You two are ingeniously funny—notice my use of ingeniously,” She told them, smiling.
"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
But those rehearsals that took place after classes were the ones where Persephone had to look out for Pansy.
Persephone didn’t think she slept. She had her arms folded on the shore, over several pebbles and rocks and sticks and it was rather uncomfortable. Her hair swirled in the water around her, and she could tell there was mud caked in it. Her body ached and her mind was afloat and she couldn’t keep from shivering, waiting for it to be over.
He raised his hand and snapped his fingers and then suddenly, with a crack like a whip, and for a long moment, she felt as though she was air. The next second, she was sitting in the car still, but in a completely different setting.
“Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.
“Those points don’t count when you’re the teacher’s favorite!” Hermione crossed her arms angrily. “Some of us have to at least try!”
"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money outta Ms. Persephone Potter's safe."
She rather enjoyed her names’ origins, much to the displeasure of her aunt, who thought both female icons were hideous in their markings of the world and should have been forgotten. Persephone didn’t mind—she and her aunt barely agreed on anything. Aunt Petunia always sat Persephone down to teach her to sew and to cook and taught her not to speak unless spoken to. She made her do ballet, which Persephone did not mind much, until she had to pull Persephone’s hair into a tight bun. She didn’t get new clothes and barely had enough
“Me too,” Persephone admitted gratefully. She liked having someone to talk to like this. She couldn’t recall a friendship like this. “I thought I could probably swipe it from him during lessons but I think he might be suspicious as to why I get close to him. The invisibility cloak is too risky in a classroom full of people so…” She shrugged worriedly.
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
“Right,” He said. When the grass turned to sand, she pulled her small heeled shoes off, feeling a lure from the water some ways beyond them. “While we’re here, we should get some extra water—” She didn’t hear the rest as she had darted forward, at some point dropping her bag and shoes on the sand in the process. “And there she goes.” She heard faintly in an exasperated voice.
She snorted, “You can say your friends, it won’t ruin your little reputation,” She told him. “How come your friends?”
. Her arm nearly fell out of its socket from the weight but she balanced it out as he explained, "Here, these are the Bludgers. I’ll show you what they do.”
“Big deal,” Ron said, holding onto Persephone’s shoulder for support as her rubbed his foot where the photographer had harshly stepped on. Persephone had not looked up from her book but Gilderoy Lockhart had looked up from his at Ron’s comment.
The brick he had touched quivered—it wriggled—in the middle, a small hole appeared—it grew wider and wider—a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
Tom spoke in her mind and she suddenly almost smiled, “Is that why you gave me a family tree of my own? So I would owe you?”
Ron thought for a moment, “Snape doesn’t seem to hate you, he’s never taken points from you.” He told her. “Why can’t you just make a permission form yourself?”
Later, when she had made it to the Gryffindor common room, she felt ready to collapse. The twins were by the fire, discussing what looked like something very serious. When George spotted her, he nodded to her and tossed something over to her.
But how could they? Their head of house just ignored their pleas and the stone would be stolen. Voldemort would probably barge in here tomorrow.
Slowly, Persephone swam forward and maybe she was disoriented, but she let the girl pick out a twig that had stuck to Persephone hair. She looked at the twig before putting it behind her own ear. Persephone stared.
On their last evening, Persephone’s clothes were all washed and she repacked her trunk with her new things in their right places while laying out her uniform and robes for the next day.
She spun immediately, feeling as if though the blood in her veins had run cold. Two shabby looking wizards that had their eyes on her before when she came out of Borgins’ shop were standing there. They smiled at her with chipped, yellow teeth in a manner that she did not like—disgusting.
Pansy Parkinson, bless her, was trying to kill Persephone. Why? Oh—because she was cast as Persephone’s understudy. This being, should anything drastic enough happen to Persephone that not even Madame Pomfrey be able to fix, Pansy would presume the role of Dorothy.
“Slytherin, probably.” Ron said darkly. "I've heard of his family. They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He shook his head, “His entire family were in Slytherin, the whole lot of them.”
Persephone noticed that his arms were behind his back, as if he were hiding something. It was not often that she could be taken away from the current apple of her eye—finding out as much about Cerberus as possible. She had actually started remembering the myth of Orpheus when Ron had spoken.
Professor Sinistra was the Astronomy professor and one of three dance teachers. Professor Berry and Professor Alison were the other two and she knew very well from second-hand accounts how strict they were. Standing with them were strange women Persephone had never seen before.
She didn’t sleep the first time she felt it—a distant noise outside her window in her dorm made her jerk awake. She felt her eyes sting like they did when she opened her eyes in chlorine water and for a moment a darkness infiltrated her vision. She was half-asleep so she didn’t panic and when her vision came back, she barely noticed it had been absent.
"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Persephone informed them both of the news of Snape’s sudden desire to be the Quidditch referee.
Before Persephone could reason with him, Ron interrupted her, "Get out of the way," he snapped, taking a swipe at Peeves—and so their fate was sealed.
The plan was risky, but then again, they’d come this far. So, right before dinner, the two girls ran to one of the janitor’s closet close to the Great Hall. Persephone changed quickly into the Slytherin uniform she borrowed from George (he had a pair of uniforms from all the houses for reasons she did not want to know) and finally stood straight in front of Hermione.
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid. He seemed confident in where they were going, though he had obviously been used to a different way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains moved too slow.
She was starting to feel a headache come on and it was harder to resist her violent emotions. Considering it was past curfew hours, the corridors were rather empty and she was good and relieved about this. Ben followed her along as she suddenly was a compass and north was the water. She navigated them down into the dungeons and up a set of winding stairs that led them into the boathouse by the lake.
Persephone brought out her laptop and started playing a non-magical movie, while the Weasleys were all entranced by the device. They kept asking questions, pointing at things on it, asking again how it could work, followed by more questions. It wasn’t until George whispered in her ear to keep Percy occupied that he and Fred ended up stealing his prefect’s badge.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
Persephone shook her head. She understood the game but now only could hope she could understand it on the field.
He opened the door wider and they stepped into the river of what could only be bathroom water rushing past them. It was a lot of water flooding the floor and again, George pulled her forward.
She came upon a wooden door, one that creaked loudly when she pushed it open. She came upon a round room made of stone with shelves carved into the stone walls. It looked ancient, with cobwebs covering most corners and a circular candle holder above her head. As she stepped in, a fire burst in the hearth and illuminated the room with a warm glow.
It was so strange—Hagrid seemed to avoid her eyes. He grunted and offered her another rock cake. Persephone re-read the story with closer inspection.
“It’s a list that was published anonymously in the 1930s with twenty-nine families that made the cut as truly pureblooded in Great Britain,” He explained. “It’s families everyone know, like Abbott, Black, Greengrass, Lestrange, Longbottom, Malfoy, Nott, Ollivander, Parkinson, Prewett, Slughorn, Weasley,” She was happy that she recognized the names he listed, though it may be because he was listing the names he knew she would recognized.
Hermione interrupted her, "The dog must be guarding Flamel's Philosopher’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
Apart from the patter of their footsteps, there was the ominous sound of the water trickling down the walls. They started to walk downwards and Persephone, who felt herself growing more hyperaware of everything around her, started hearing some strange sound.
“Oh lord, here goes Lily,” Mindi rolled her eyes. Persephone ignored her and opened the door and slipped inside.
“Oh…” She nodded. “Wow…okay…” She said, still nodding. “Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude but um, what are you doing here?” The elf hung his head making Persephone immediately ashamed. “I mean, I did not expect a guest at this…hour. I would have…made tea,” She glanced up, and then looked at him again. “Won’t you tell me why you’re here?”
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it—it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course."
"But—but I don’t understand! Blo—blown up? What happened?" Persephone asked urgently, feeling a sort of dread fill her as she realized that her parents weren’t alive.
? Those were fictional….yet, should she want to grow a plant just by her foot on the neighbor’s perfectly cut lawn, she could. Without any assistance from any gardening tools, she would probably be able to grow a competition for aunt Petunia’s garden and win by a mile.
There was no one sitting in the tall leather chairs, nor anyone she could see from where she was hiding behind the painting up high. She pushed against the one way picture and fell ever so gracefully—face first and loudly.
“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,” Mrs. Weasley said, smiling at Persephone as she started to clear the table, “What’re you all up to today?”
Neville flicked and swished but nothing happened. Persephone was encouraging either way, and clapped when she saw it wobble. “That was so close! A few more tries and you’ll have it!”
The rest of the day was spent quietly—everyone seemed not to want to trigger another, er, episode (?) so her day was spent with the boys. She helped Ron every time he came in with a question about homework and then she helped Ron through his remaining homework.
She blinked and then smiled, “Right.” Her smile fell a tad, “We both auditioned for the play, though.”
Hermione sighed, dropping her shoulders, “I’m not entirely sure of the reason…I mean, you and I are the only girls from the muggle world in our dorm and yet everything…everything comes so
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted her hair as they looked into the forest.
She slammed the compartment door shut behind her, staring out at the next compartment, her face hot and flushed. Thank god they were only changing their shirts—thank god, oh thank god she hadn’t see anything else—“Heyyyy, Lily?”
"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. "You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
They looked at each other, the girl hummed, smiling like she was coming from a faraway dream. Persephone tried speaking, “Do you want your blanket back?”
George shook Persephone awake when the parked. Mr. Weasley was dashing across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and Persephone was suddenly alarmed—she had checked her watch to find it was a quarter to eleven.
"I remember every detail of every wand I’ve ever sold, Miss Potter. Every single wand wood to the inches—the feather of which will produce your wand came from a phoenix that only gave one other feather—just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for these cores when its sister why, its sister gave you that scar."
She smiled to herself, mumbling the forgotten end to the famous phrase, “…but satisfaction brought it back.”
From what she read on, she found that wands had to be grown and then carved. Then the cores had to be forged into the wand by manners that were listed with not much detailing other than; the use of venom, the use of fire seed bush, and the use of mars.
Dudley knocked into her side as he too pressed his ear against the key hole to listen. She caught the end, “…my foolish sister’s fault!” And that was about all she could handle before backing away, sitting back into her chair and glaring down at the table.
Holy god! I am so sorry for such a long wait and for coming with such a short chapter! School is hectic as its my last year and I've been involved in all sorts of plannings for the school events and such. I hope you enjoy! Leave a thought in the comments!
Looking around, she paled. Several people—men—were staring at her. She looked about, ignoring their eyes and found something very unfortunate about her surroundings—it seemed she had emerged into an alleyway devoted loyally to the Dark Arts.
“For obvious reasons,” Her heart skipped a beat. She stared at him and he said, “The book? Did you get it?”
The woman broke into a kind smile, patting a gentle hand on her shoulder to her elbow, as if sensing her tremble and wanting to subtly soothe her, “Oh, well, not to worry dear, we’ll help you right on, with just a spare minute! Now, tell me, first year at Hogwarts too?” Persephone nodded as the woman led her away from the wall with her cart. “Ron’s new too.”
She pulled him back and let the twins tease them from a distance, “How long until I can jump into the lake because I am dying,” She whined up at him. “Do you think we can skip dinner and just grab something from the kitchens instead?”
Persephone reacted quicker than Hades, running at him and pulling him along by the arm, and under the desk, hiding from the door. They listened carefully, holding their breath, as the footsteps came and then went. For a moment, they listened the silence, and thanked their lucky stars—usually when they were up to no good and there were footsteps nearby, it meant someone would catch them. Or reveal an evil plot of some sort. They were safe in this case.
“No, they call me that because it’s my name—well, my mother’s name. My middle name is my mother’s name,” She explained quickly. “But my name is Persephone Potter.”
He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
It was empty, thank gods. It took a simple maneuver to float up to the portrait of Godric Gryffindor. Unlike the portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the Gryffindor common room, the passageway wasn’t behind the frame. It was
“Look, I’m sorry for—for Pansy. She’s…she’s really forward. She’s always been sort of like that, but she means well…enough,” She winced and Persephone smiled, turning straight towards.
Normal enough, except for when the deer bent down and bit his shoulder. She screamed and surged forward, slapping the deer as he pushed it off.
“No, I did not,” He told her icily but strangely. Was his voice…softening? She waited a beat and he glided to his desk. “I went to school with her—I was in her year.”
“Well, now, don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” Mrs. Weasley said, though her cheeks flushed. “All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.”
“Your eyes!” He exclaimed. He seemed to bend over her, to stare into her eyes. “They’re bloody brilliant!”
“I definitely do not like him,” She said, looking across the stage as Ben's head. He was wearing a black beanie today, as if to hide the messy thick dark hair. “We’re barely friends.”
It varied greatly and mostly came down to a competitive streak between dancers. There was heavy competition between the girls. The first group, Pansy outshined everyone with a phenomenal variation to the music of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. She would be going onto the next round and to Persephone’s chagrin, she saw one of three woman smile at Pansy as she won the round.
When Persephone finished, she stood and had started to cross the stage to grab her book-bag. Quirrell was speaking with Flitwick on the other side and she had thought curiously of what they could be talking of. She had reached the end of the stage and grabbed her bag and turned around.
Persephone ducked down, frantically picking her things up and packing them nastily into her book bag while the girl watched. She cleared her throat and stood up and took her leave.
She got herself better towels as well—better for curly hair and made her hair frizz-free. Another body towel with a lasting heat charm, thick and good smelling. She skipped out on the moisturizers and body sprays—Ben assured her she had a very nice, natural smell.
Persephone noticed someone suddenly pause as they came out of the Great Hall and quickly scuttle back. She nudged Hermione and Ron, “Shhh!”
Rubeus Hagrid fell back down on the sofa, which caused each side of the couch lift off the ground, and the cough sagged under his weight. He started to pile things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. She glanced at her aunt to see her scolding in disgust.
“Oh my god,” She suddenly gasped, looking at his shoulder where the deer had bitten her friend, “Oh my god, was the bite infectious?”
“I don’t tell many people but I wanted to have a slumber gathering with some friends—thank god, we thought you were McGonagall or one of the prefects,” She giggled, turning towards the shared bathroom of the dorm. “Girls, its all clear!”
. She didn’t need to squint—not at all! She ended up nearly a different looking person—still a red head but with freshly cut layers that made her hair
"Course! Just got yer key right here,” He patted his jacket as he held it up. “First stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold—an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither. An’ ye’ll have to repeat the rest of whatcha said, there,”
"Come on, Lily!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Lily sped straight at Snape—she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. Persephone bit back a colorful insistence that he should really
She had to start at some place—she let her wand hover, using the light to read through titles. Finally, she decided on an interesting looking volume, large, black and silver linings. It looked old—she tucked her wand behind her ear and carefully pulled the book out.
She smiled shyly, “I should write Cedric a letter, and figure it out. And thank you, again, Mrs. Weasley.”
Persephone had given up trying to reason. She’d given the proper excuse of how Hedwig wasn’t used to being locked up all day and night, that she was used to flying around. Of course, this only led to Uncle Vernon becoming offended, snarling about how he knew that the owl being let out would be a means of communication.
"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
She ignored his laughter and instead focused on her mind—‘So, what was your time in Slytherin like?’
The Weasley twins later insisted to her that the turban was stuffed with garlic and she believed them, already having speculated the same thing.
Cedric had caught up with Persephone, looking positively confused as to how a crowd had settled around her in less than a minute.
Slowly, with shaking hands, she reached down to grab her bag and slung it over her shoulder before looking up and snapping her eyes to Pansy’s. She felt her eyes flash for just a moment before a spell formed in her head and she felt it seal with another one.
“The money is sitting under your name, and mine as a safety, and I’ve been making sure they put the money every week into the bank over the forty-two weeks you’ve been gone from under their roof.” Mary said. She was so shocked at this news that she wasn’t able to calculate how much money was in a bank with her name on it—she was more shocked that she was worth four hundred and fifty a week.
“Well, you’ll have to learn tons in school now, and I’m afraid languages won’t help you,” Pansy sighed before smiling, “We can help you.”
She started to make her way back across the stage to where she was sitting with Susan, still staring at Ben when all of a sudden, a harsh swoosh and high pitched reeling sounded pierced the air. Suddenly, Ben was before her, pushing her away from the spot where a sandbag had landed, loudly and violently, followed by the long winding rope.
difference in shade. She watched in fascination—she didn’t realize identical twins could be so identical with just the difference of hair color—“There you are!”
“What is it, Potter? Finally come to your senses about your friend choice?” He smirked. “Too late—the offer has expired—”
They showed Persephone and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Persephone and Hermione thanked them profusely. Diana hung back towards Persephone and Persephone still was in shock, “So….you know Charlie then?”
Persephone still couldn’t think straight—if he looked into the mirror, shouldn’t he be able to find him? Wasn’t that his heart’s deepest desire, no matter how ludicrous it was? Was that not what Dumbledore meant about the mirror—Quirrell wanted the stone.
Persephone turned to look up at George, who was leaning on the back of her chair, reading over her shoulder, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
It was a confusing branch of magic that she did not nearly get lost in a library to learn about. The branch of magic that she did almost get lost in a library to learn about was…intricate. It was very complex and very hard to understand but she was sure of was that the books talked about dark magic simply being magic that was frowned upon because of its uses to harm others. People were scared of this magic like they were scared of the Dark Lord’s name.
The boys play fought for a moment while Hermione raised a brow, “He's known as Ben, sure, but his full name is Obi-Wan Solo.”
"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!"
She walked cautiously out of her dorm, quietly climbing down the stairs, across the dark common room and then out through the portrait hole. She did all this without tripping, thankfully and only the Fat Lady noticed anything, "Who's there?"
Her entire life was spent thinking they abandoned her, with the hope in the back of her mind that maybe one day she would get to see them, to be with them. But then, nearly six months ago, she was thrown into a world where she was an orphan instead of an abandoned girl. It made…a strange amount of sense.
The owl hooted and kept going at it, breaking her reverie and she started to fear for a moment for the mice’s life, but when checking the pocket the owl was paying attention to, she found it filled with coins rather than mice. She took it out into her hand, inspecting the coins, and the owl immediately stuck its claw out, a little pouch tied to it. She realized what it wanted, “Didn’t realize owls had an economy…” She muttered, looking up over to Hagrid.
, and this much she knew about herself. Why would the Sorting Hat…why would it change its opinion so quickly? Just before she’d been put into the most logical house, she’d been put in the house that made the
“Alright, Ron, you take Lily to the kitchen and pretend like she just got here while we head upstairs. Mum’ll come down the stairs and be so happy to see Lily she won’t ever need to know we flew the car.” Fred explained quickly.
“Why didn’t you just say that? Who dared you?” Hermione asked and Persephone had to hold in her sigh of relief.
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.
“Not only did you forget to mention your detention but you also forget to mention it was on a full moon.” He hissed. “And by the time I find you, you’ve attacked Malfoy—I had to use three memory spells to get him to stop blubbering about a monster! You’re lucky I’m so good at them, otherwise he’d have gone straight to Dumbledore—or worse, his father. And when I asked you to wait—you don’t! What the hell!
Diana was a much preferred babysitter because she didn’t act like a babysitter. She acted like she liked Persephone, like they were friends. Diana often taught her different hairstyles and let her read whatever she wanted—Percy Jackson usually—and they often times watched old movies too. Diana always laid out all sorts of snacks and took her to the library and even the theatres. It was so much fun, though she had to act like she hated it there because the Dursleys would never let her come again if they thought she’d had a good time.
Persephone was small enough to slip in, dragging both her friends in with lots of force that caused several witches to give them dirty looks. Then they had a job of it to fight their way to where Mrs. Weasley was with the rest of the boys and Hermione’s parents. They had each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2, thank god, because Persephone was most certainly not meeting this guy.
She made a move to get out of the fountain, accepting Hades’ outstretched hand but Persephone grabbed her other hand and pulled. Hermione, and Hades by extension, fell right into the fountain, Hermione straight up on Persephone, causing her to shriek with laughter.
Lots of things came up—no schools, however. Some magic plays, street magicians, and once more, everything listed above. There was an interesting article posted on November 1
Uncle Vernon did not look much too different from when she last saw him. He was still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of his freak of a niece. He cast a glance at the owl she carried in her cage, as if trying to decide if he regretted coming to get her.
She rolled her eyes, “I’m not terminally ill, Ron.” She knew better than to think she was ill. She was a siren, and that obviously gave off some very strange symptoms. “Trust me.”
“Oh? What like—Athena?” He guessed, smiling and she felt herself smile in reaction. “Aurora? You would suit Aurora.”
“With my last, dying breath!” Persephone cried in just a theatrical voice as he did before standing to chuck a snowball that landed over their protective wall.
It seemed there were several options for uniforms—the classic black skirt and white blouse, the black cut clean dress for girls, several different sorts of black skirts and white shirts. Just basic posh boarding school uniform in different styles.
He rolled his eyes, “Where else would I go?” She stared at him and he said, “All the Weasleys are in Gryffindor.”
She anticipated his ambition to bring him to this point, as did George and Fred. She jumped over the stairs and landed in their waiting arms, passing them the badge. Fred took it while George pretended he had it and they ran in different directions.
She suddenly realized that he had been Ben, not Benjamin. He’d never told her that Ben was short for anything—she had just assumed. She cringed, “Sorry—I thought…”
“Should be. Rich, at least.” George said, turning back around. “Dad talks about him. Rumor has it that was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.”
Persephone and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
It was a wonder of how Persephone didn’t catch a cold. Getting on her broom and soaring up high into the cold air while being sweaty should have gotten her a bad cold by now. They did laps on the broom and then finally, it was each their own. The Chasers, Beaters and Keeper played games while Persephone, the seeker, was left to fly around in search for a practice snitch. Oliver warned her that no matter how quickly she was able to find and capture the snitch, it would be ten times as hard in an actual game of Quidditch, because the Snitch in those games are never been used before.
She couldn’t look at him but he came next to her, bending down, “Your legs! They’re…” He sounded shocked but she didn’t really want to know. “Can you…walk?” He held his hands out for her and she stared at them before taking them.
She turned to look at her, “And do you believe yourself a worthy enough dancer to be the leading lady dancing for Hogwarts?” Persephone stared and then mumbled something that even she could not understand. Narcissa cocked a brow. “Pardon me?”
She walked into her compartment, where Ron was also changed and staring out the window. “So what house are your brothers in?" She asked, taking her seat once more. Ron looked up at her sudden entrance and was blushing.
“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and Persephone’s heart lightened considerably. “But you will both get a detention.”
And here there was, clutched in her hand, a chance to go to a school for people like her—away from people like Aunt Petunia, who ignored her freakiness and pretended like she didn’t exist for it. People who could do what she can do. Maybe people had color changing hair existed in this Hogwarts—wizards and witches weren’t that far off in the mythical. There had always been people who did things that no scientific textbook could explain. It just happened, with no explanation—maybe
She backed away immediately, her hand reaching for her wand, “Now, now, no need for that,” The taller one said.
“Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” Fred asked, making Ron scarlet in the face. Percy was staring to notice the commotion around their arrival and was starting to get up.
She figured something very important was being kept inside, by someone very important—but all she saw was darkness. She leaned forward, squinting, but saw nothing—and then she noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Persephone bit her tongue back from asking him. She knew better than to think he’d tell her after seeing all that high security.
She thought about waking Ron and the twins up—who better than to share this first planned act of breaking rules than her best friend and the best rule-breakers in all of Hogwarts?—but then again, she was under her
“Sir,” She began, taking a seat. “I’ve been thinking, for a long time, actually, since I was sorted that I don’t…fit in. Into Gryffindor, I mean.”
From what she could see, the troll had seen Fred and raised its club for him instead, when Ron yelled, "Oy, pea-brain!" from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.
“You know, I would have been your second if you decided to duel him,” Ron told her casually as the twins leaned over to talk to Lee.
And strangely enough, when she moved to tuck her hair behind her ear, something out of the corner of her eye moved. She snapped her head to it, but there was no one there. Distracted, she took a step towards what she had thought had moved…
"Get out of the way," he said. Persephone moved aside, breathing carefully against the stone. It was stuck safely against her collarbone—had her chest really done that much growing in the year?—and she wondered if she could make a run for it.
Persephone gathered George’s blanket off from the couch and followed Ron up the stairs, intent on giving the blanket it back. She bid Ron goodnight and headed up still, until she reached the third year door that read two Weasley names. She knocked—no answer. She would slip in and out, no big deal.
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself. He was the one who asserted the need for the rule of first years being banned from bringing their own broomsticks and playing for their respective house teams."
“Yes you do!” He said. “You support girls, don’t you? You’re all about feminism and supporting girls and understanding each other and love and all that—if a girl came to you and told you she’s confused, you would have comforted her. This girl came to you and you were also confused, you drop the support? Seriously? Even if you don’t know, you can’t make her feel like shit because you don’t understand the problem and that’s obviously how you made her feel!”
“Hermione Granger, your friend, she told me it was your birthday just a while ago and, well I know it’s late, but I got you this,” He handed her a bag, “It’s not wrapped so I don’t think it really counts as a present. I hope it’s alright—I’m not really that well versed in, er, ballerina fashion but my mum, she runs a shop and, I, uh, picked out some things…”
She chose to ignore that nickname and shrugged, “I noticed you know most of the castle incredibly well—how is that?”
Then everyone around them was looking and Hermione, loudly said, “Nice thinking on putting that—fire out Ron!”
was, was that she had planned on brewing a potion like that upon their arrival to school. “Come on, we’d better get up to the school…”
Persephone found a spot near the lake, under a tree. Its leaves had fallen and surrounded the nearby area. She sat under it, her back right up against the trunk. She was facing the lake, where the tree’s roots met the water. Her legs were frozen but she refused to move—something made them prickle, like they were asleep. She stared at the lake in fascination.
She pursed her lips, not knowing how to tread with this subject, “I don’t know if it matters whether or not you’re in your parent’s house. I mean, you’re not your parents, right? And besides, every house seems good on its own.”
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Persephone gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
She was pushing her way through the crowds when suddenly, when she made it to the front, a voice she recognized all too well made her groan, “Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?”
No matter the ridiculous promise, he was trying and she was grateful. She had let some tears roll down her cheeks, hot and burning and she stared up at Hades. Suddenly, she understood what it meant for a heart to skip a beat. Hers was skipping rocks, skipping rope in her ribcage. He had let his hands slide down her arms and hold her hands. They were warm.
“Oh, no, you’ve misunderstood me,” Daphne rushed. “I mean, we can all be friends from different houses—”
Of the boys, Cedric Diggory made it through with an impressive Nutcracker Prince variation. George and Fred weren’t in it seriously, as they pranced about and made very non-ballet moves but it was still Persephone’s favorite. Draco, too, unfortunately made it forward. Persephone hates herself for saying it, but he was very good. She didn’t like that he was good at something she was good at.
She didn’t take her eyes off Slytherin, who had a wicked smile growing on his face. “My Chamber of Secrets has been in the same place for all of time, and will always be hidden behind the snake, though its disguise has changed since its original time. The only hint I can offer you is that it will be on the second floor and no higher.”
It seemed so unbelievable that everyone in the house liked her. Except maybe the ghoul in the attic, who howled and dropped pipes whenever he thought things got too quiet. The mirror up above the kitchen mantel place seemed to have it in for Persephone, always calling at her to tie her hair up.
"Oh, nonsense, Persephone! Yer won’t be the one payin’—well, not technically.” He chuckled heartily, making Persephone’s head cock to the side.
When the end of the trip came, she was very sad to leave. She wouldn’t forget, of course, and the things she’d seen would remain with her forever, she thought—another thing stuck with her. She had to go back to the Durlseys.
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one does."
“Full moon is out in an hour,” He said, staring out the window. She stared at him before it properly hit her. She was locked in a tower with a werewolf. The door would not open until sunrise. No one knew where she was or who she was with.
Persephone huffed, “There are too many stereotypes surrounding girls. Some girls hate skirts and dresses and that’s fine. Some girls like being friends with boys and that’s fine too. It’s fine either way—other girls bullying girls for that is not fine. Girls should support girls—”
Reaching up, she pulled it off, shoving it into her bag—no use going back into the shop now. As she considered her options, she started walking. Nothing looked like Diagon Alley’s familiar shops. How deep inside this horrible little alley had she wound up?
“I’m sure if he’s so dedicated to house unity between Gryffindor and Slytherin, then he’ll stick around until after breakfast.” Persephone turned to look Malfoy in the eye as Ron slouched back into his seat next to her, “Or is it house-bickering that’s brought you here? Still celebrating ancient house feuds that have long been outlived, are we, Draco? Or is it Neville’s Remembrall? Too shiny to ignore?”
“Amanda?” She said, finding the bathroom empty at first. The Gryffindor girl’s dorm bathroom was simple—showers, sinks, mirrors and toilets. Every week, Audrey the prefect came to inspect their bathrooms were clean and usually they were, thanks to Hermione’s insistence that they keep a clean space.
Persephone leant up against the stone column by the top step while Ron stretched out his tall person down the stairs. Had he gotten taller? She certainly hadn’t. They started talking about the Quidditch tryouts and whether or not the team would be changed—Ron was sure Persephone would still be seeker, loyally. She wondered who else would be trying out for the Seeker position when suddenly the Hufflepuffs got even louder.
"No, um, nothing,” She stammered, finding that the pain had disappeared just as she registered it. When she looked back at the teacher but he paid her no more attention. She’d gotten the feeling that he had not expected something he’d just seen.
Persephone listened to the conversation as she started piling dishes away in the sink, and carefully managing several things at once. Though magic was not allowed, technically, this was non-wand magic she was doing, so it didn’t really count. She made coffee while she carefully lowered the dessert from down on top of the fridge when she heard the crack. She nearly dropped the plate of dessert and only managed to slide it back onto the fridge.
“That is hard to answer, Miss Potter, as a wand is it not just its core—every wand core reacts differently to every wand wood,” He nodded, “Do you mind?” He pulled at her fingers, cracking them.
It was halfway through her first lesson that she realized this. When it was obvious she had not taken it, she simply could not focus. She couldn’t take proper notes and she kept looping out of the lesson to random thoughts, staring out of the window. She still felt sick and hot with fever. Her entire mouth ached and every step she took was like a rush of hot iron up her legs.
!—and as she stepped through the archway, she gasped as the archway shrink back into a solid wall. She double checked with Hagrid that she was really seeing what she just saw, and was glad she couldn’t find words to express her feeling of amazement because she would have just talked Hagrid’s ear right off. He grinned at Persephone amazement.
Dobby!” the elf choked. “Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a witch—like an equal—and to be asked by the great Persephone Potter…!”
“I find that, with the thousands of children in foster cares and orphanages and those starving in under developed countries, we need to take a second look at our ethics and take care of them.”
She had a thought of mind—she changed her lip shape and thinned out her long, normally arched eyebrows to a darker black color. She smiled at herself—how strange…but pretty…hm. She looked like…a Veronica.
“I’m…really grateful for the offer, but I don’t think my aunt and uncle would approve…besides, I think they need me at home for the summer,” She said, looking down at her plate, feeling that terrible feeling she always had when she was a child and wasn’t allowed doing things because of her uncle and aunt’s rules.
She took to helping Mrs. Weasley with the dishes, which Mrs. Weasley found very dear of her. While they worked, she recounted stories of her summer to her questions. Mrs. Weasley listened to her, smiling at her in encouragement every so often. She was just finishing about the Fountain of Neptune when the door opened and in walked a stranger.
“I’m going—I’m going to go do it.” She said finally, getting up. If she made out the portrait hole then she would make it all the way because she did
Ben was, well, she wasn’t exactly sure what he was. He wouldn’t admit to being a werewolf, which was irritating because he obviously was one. He had figured her out last year when he used one of her hairs as a wand core and made a fully functioning wand out of it. Long story. Other than her and the Weasley twins, she was sure he had no other friends, isolating himself very successfully from most of the Hogwarts population. He kept a lot of secrets but she thought she trusted him—she would trust him more if he didn’t always take her off into dangerous situations—the Forbidden Forest in the night, was one.
Persephone was startled to find she had tears streaming down her face—guilt immediately coiled in her stomach. “She heard you.”
"You're right Lily," Hermione said finally in a small voice. “Of course, you’re right when you say it that way.”
“Okay,” She gasped, adjusting herself. Fred started to drive again as she reached to grab Salem from Ron. “Alright,” She and Ron grinned at each other.
Ron reached out with a shaking hand, taking the envelope from Errol’s beak and slowly, eased it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears and Persephone leaned away. It exploded with a roar filling the huge hall, and it had begun:
Mr. Malfoy stood behind his son and Hades, a hand on both their shoulders, sneering in the identical manner as his son. Persephone couldn’t help but stare at the hand that tightened on Hades’ shoulder. She stared, and wondered why Hades’ eyes suddenly dropped. What…was going on?
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
“What—are you okay?” He asked, sitting farther down the steps in front of her, leaning against the column. “What’s wrong?”
“Old Filly has asked me to be the official documenter for the process of putting together this little shindig—the more no-maj touches, the better, in his words,” He cocked an eyebrow in thought and raised the camera again. “Anything our young, ambitious actors would like to say?”
Amongst the dense, dark trees, she could make out the shape of something…something strange. And then, someone had tackled her to the nearest tree, keeping her pressed up by the shoulders.
‘Okay!’ She said, jumping up and down, pacing back and forth in front of the door. Pointing at the door, it was her target—she would knock and she would knock thoroughly (how do you even knock thoroughly!?).
pretty, with wispy black hair and a pretty, round face. She looked concerned as to why both Susan and Persephone were sat on the ice.
Susan had to sit longer than Hannah but eventually, the hat called out, "HUFFLEPUFF!" Susan scuttled merrily off to sit next to Hannah, smiling at Persephone as she passed.
She walked in and had to pause—she had visited many teacher’s offices but none looked as interesting or cluttered as Dumbledore’s.
"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Persephone from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to underarm and round her head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Miss. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand."
“She won’t eat anything, I’ve been trying all morning,” Hermione said miserably. Persephone cast her a dark look of betrayal.
She was worried and distracted for the remainder of the day. She was worried about Daphne thinking she cheated to be with Hades—but how could she have done that? If it was all based off chemistry, then how could someone cheat? Was she really mad because she thought she’d cheated? But then, wouldn’t she know that Hades and Persephone were close? Closer than him and Daphne? What even made up chemistry?
When the clapping for the Hat died down and Professor McGonagall announced the beginning, the Sorting began. Fred and George caused a lot of ruckus, yelling out their predictions for the kid under the hat. When they got it wrong, they started booing. It was very comical.
Persephone asked Ron to teach her to play wizard chess—it was a lot like non-magical chess, if it had not been for the fact that the figures had minds of their own. They looked like they were alive and moved on their own, with their own small limbs. It looked like they were directing troops into battle.
“You got the front page with me and it gave you a thrill, eh? Needed more of the feeling so you did the biggest thing you could think of.”
She was sure she would also really enjoy Transfiguration. She found a part of the book where it mentioned Human Transfiguration—it was meant to be so advanced that it would not even be mentioned until later years. People who could naturally change their appearance were called metamorphmagus.
She made her way silently out the door but she did not go downstairs—she headed upstairs, to the room above hers. She was reaching for the door knob, listening to the breathing, when suddenly she saw her hands—her fingers looked longer, with long, sharpened nails. She realized quickly what was probably happening and, almost hissing at the pain that shot up her legs, she stumbled through the house, out the backdoor. The same harrowing, tearing feeling came to her legs and she collapsed from the sudden, blinding white pain that shot up her legs. It felt like she had broken her bones, over and over and she started running, jumping half the way.
She dropped her arms, and her mouth fell open. She closed it quickly and took a step towards him, “I’m sorry.”
She thought of telling Dumbledore of her cat but thought better of it. Students were only allowed one pet and she had an owl and cat. Somehow, she’d yet to be caught and she’d like to keep it that way. She had the Gryffindors to thank—no one was a snitch. She’d be able to catch a snitch in her own house—she was the house’s seeker.
She felt herself break and snap—she screamed into the water, struggling. She felt her bones break, her spine snap all the way up and she couldn’t control her screams anymore. Her legs were no longer legs—they broke and fused together, and she was a mermaid.
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Persephone wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't even glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. Persephone found herself theorizing only she and Hagrid could see it. Before she could ask it aloud, Hagrid had steered her inside.
They walked down the hall by this point, and Hades was staring at Persephone. She met his eye, “Yes?”
She stood up with the key and unlocked the little cage. She took the water out and stared at them. Now what? Now all she had was a mouse—oooooh. They had done this in class. Mice to snuffbox. Here we go.
Persephone met Ron’s eyes and his eyes glanced to the stairs and back. She understood what he meant and followed him out. “Let’s leave them to
Perhaps because of what they were about to do, Persephone glanced around nervously. She was imaging things, of course, but she could swear every shadow cast by a statue looked like Filch could be lurking in, every howl of wind outside sounded like Peeves, sweeping down on them in a nasty surprise.
“Oh, Lily, I am grateful you will be at the funeral,” She told Persephone, holding both her hands. “I am ashamed to admit these occasions draw on far too long.”
"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh—mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...." He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with—with a person called—but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows—"
“Have you been following Oliver’s training program every day, then, while I’ve been gone?” She asked. There was a small paddock that the Weasleys owned, surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below. As long as they did not fly too high, they could practice Quidditch up there.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed."
“Well, sirens are mentioned in it so I’ll give you the book by the end of the day.” He said, “Do you know mermish?”
Persephone stared. Then she looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. She looked back at the snake and winked, too, thinking back to which Greek god was the patron of snakes. And then she thought about how snakes don’t even
But just as she turned away, she heard the scream build. It kept screaming, and it was getting louder! No—no! The shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, ear-splitting, growing louder and louder—she started to back out of the shelves when she heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside.
She stood, flipping her hair over to put in a high pony tail before taking a deep breath and stretching down to touch her toes. Then she slid into the splits and one of the girls cried out. Persephone looked up in alarm to find two of the girls staring at her in shock, “What?!”
Instead of following the masses of people into the Gryffindor tower, they took a left and headed up the stairs to one of the empty classes.
It wasn’t just the Quidditch practice that kept her busy—it was play rehearsals. And, more specifically, it was Pansy Parkinson.
Suddenly, a completely new voice, one that seemed to belong to the youngest boy with the lightest of all their hair, spoke, "Oh, mum, can I go see her, on the train, for just a minute, just to see her, mummy please!"
“Oh, so your house-elf feeds you then?” She didn’t know what a house elf was but she could tell he had gotten very angry when he spat out,
"Good question, Sephie. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see... he was gettin' more an' more powerful—why'd he go?
Before she could even finish the incantation, the feather began to move, floating ever so softly. A smile spread on her face and she watched it float, as Neville watched in amazement, “Wow…”
She rolled her eyes and George laughed, “She is the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen, nonetheless,” He said. “You have to agree.”
It took less than an hour for them to be in her peripheral after dinner and she skidded over to them, “Hello boys,” She smiled a brilliant smile she hoped would soften them up before asking her favor.
She was bouncing her feet up and down, overwhelmed with nerves—now her thoughts were all subjected to which house she’d belong to. She feared she wouldn’t be in the same house as Ron, fearing perhaps she would be put in Slytherin and he would think her evil, but tried to keep herself as positive as possible as they joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
“Well, unless you want to wait another month!” He cried out, jogging backwards. “Remember! Bring the seeds and cores!”
“I’m not grabbing you!” Hermione had finally leapt and struggled toward a damp wall, leaving Persephone to be tangled by…the plant?
“You be careful, Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley said sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. “That family’s trouble. Don’t go biting off more than you can chew—”
“Pretty tiara you’ve got there,” A haggard woman said, coming close to her. Persephone jumped back, staring hard at the woman who made a swipe for her head. She realized quickly that she had never taken the tiara off her head.
"Second—to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
She held it in her hand without moving, surprised to find it still in her possession. Then she noticed the writing on it. Squinting, she read, ‘
“I…I…” She was at a loss of words because he was right. Now looking at it, she had made her feel worse with her ignorance. “Oh my gods.” He waited, crossing his arms. “I don’t know how to support her with this. I don’t know anything about this…her feelings…”
“Right,” Pansy said. She didn’t seem to like the fact that she didn’t know her nickname. “Shall I sit next to you, Draco?” Pansy, decidedly ignoring the window seat, sat right in between Draco and Persephone, as if to make it a point that Draco was hers to corner by the window. “So, Lily,” She tried the name out in her mouth. “What were you doing with Neville and that girl with the awful hair?”
In the bathroom, it was quiet. She set her things up in the unused space in the corner. She placed her calaveras down on the plate, the lilies against the basket and she lit some candles in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Finally, she reached behind her neck and unclasped her locket, setting it down against the basket.
Cedric Diggory, another full moon, Diagon Alley and a strange encounter with a strange piece of jewelry...
“Yea!” George pointed at him. “And not to mention she is a first year. Which one of you jackasses earned as many points as she has in your first year?”
It was an honest to god cliché move of hers, but Pansy had gotten the message clear—she was willing to hurt Persephone to outshine her.
Persephone felt bile form in her mouth and she swallowed, “You—you said she—they abandoned me on your doorstep! You said they didn’t want me!”
He welcomed her into his group of third year friends on the spot—two other boys and two girls. Ash Dawson, Louis Donald, Marilyn Maurison and Laura Brianne. They were very nice to her but she thought it was because they now had even numbers for duets. Louis was a Gryffindor and so naturally, they gravitated towards each other. He was very nice to her and complimented her for her getting on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk." The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. They both stared down at it, frowning. "He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
Persephone was faster than Higgs, even if he had an advantage of distance. She could see the little round ball, she was so close she could make out the detailing in the fluttering wings, and she had just about had it when—WHAM!
“Muggle technology doesn’t go through the magical barriers, and fer good reason—all too complicatin’.” He told her, making her choke.
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Lily.
Persephone was exhausted by the day, not physically but mentally. Despite everything that had happened, her mind was still reeling with information—Ben's foster parents were her neighbors. Did this mean he would be living with them? Was this the emergency that had occurred last summer? She was full of questions.
“You stole the car?” She groaned. “Why did I not guess sooner? I’m so sleep deprived, holy shit,” She tossed her hair over her shoulder—or she thought. George spat her hair out of his mouth.
As she turned, she caught the eye of Susan, who smiled at her. But then a boy some ways down also appeared to have witnessed the entire scene transpire. He was smiling, and flushed when he caught her eye. She turned away, smile still intact, slightly confused, but that weird boy didn’t put a damper on her mood. Where had she seen him before?
"Er—Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, or something, but we never talk about him."
“Professor McGonagall is brilliant! Only people who don’t understand the proprieties of Transfiguration magic would think of her as anything other than that!” Hermione scolded.
Amanda flushed red and stood suddenly, saying two words that McGonagall would definitely take fifty points from Gryffindor for, before stomping away into the bathroom, and slamming the door.
And then, with her heart literally shattering with anxiety, she watched Snape stride in like an overgrown bat, what with his black robes billowing behind him. He came to tower over the desk, not even batting a glance at Persephone. He stared at Madame Pince.
“And we have one less thing to worry about,” Persephone said about an hour later in her own dorm, Hermione standing next to her. She threw the letter into the fire that was lit in the middle of the room and they watched it burn with satisfaction.
They ate Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns. They changed out of their robes and Persephone pulled on one of her new sundresses. It made her look nice, the green sundress against the red of her hair.
Nearly the entire school was out to enjoy the snow. She spotted Hermione teaching Ron how to skate properly, a very amusing thing to watch as Ron was so tall and Hermione was not. Hagrid, too, pulled a sled along across the ice with Fangs on it, who was enjoying seeing so many students. Persephone offered Susan a warming charm as it started getting colder and just as they decided to go back inside, they were joined by Daphne Greengrass.
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."
They fell backward—Persephone slammed the door behind them and they took off running, just about tripping all the way back down the corridor. They didn’t run into Filch and they hardly cared, as they flew up the stairs—their goal was to put as much space between them and Cerberus.
consisted of reading through all her new textbooks and trying to get an idea of what to expect. She was not looking forward to DADA but then again, she never had. There had been several occasions where George, Fred and Ron complained that she was on break and shouldn’t be working but she liked herself to be occupied—she had felt different since going to Diagon Alley and could only feel somewhat herself when she was doing schoolwork.
Persephone dressed in a black skirt and white, sleeveless blouse. She pulled her hair up and stared at the mirror for a moment and concentrated hard—her hair straightened and pulled back in a half up do bun. She spun once and found her look satisfying.
“Quarrels with your housemates already?” The hat mused and her heart skipped a beat—her housemates? Was she in Slytherin then? “Oh, not yet—how trifling…”
“If you want, you can stay. If there’s someone you want to meet, just write their name down and put it here,” She gestured to her little alter. “I’m sure Mum and Dad won’t mind.” More tears slipped as the words registered with her—it was the first time she had referred to anyone as ‘mum and dad’.
“No, no I think I understand…” Persephone frowned to herself. She thought about this for a long time.
Filled with anxiety, she watched her disappear behind the office door behind the large desk. It took a few minutes for her to return and when she did, she seemed more than smug—like she had just won something Persephone did know was taking place.
Eventually, summer came to an end. While Persephone greatly looked forward to returning to Hogwarts, she would miss the Burrow. She felt unjustly envious of Ron because she was sure her welcome back to Privet Drive wouldn’t even include letting her into the house.
"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" Ron asked, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must have cost you a fortune.”
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Persephone with a bewildered stare. "Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.
“Wait—wait, wait, wait, wait,” Persephone said, trying to hold in her laughter. “Do…do you know what—what a dance belt is?”
She maneuvered the mandrake quickly into a large plant pot that she pulled from under the table, burying the thing in damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs up, and removed her own earmuffs.
When he did speak, he spoke with a surprisingly gentle tone, “Look I get how confusing it is to be told all of this and expect to be okay with any of it. Trust me, I’m well aware of how unfair it is…but I wasn’t lying when I said I want to help you.” He said. She met his eye. “And I know it sucks when someone seems to know more about you then you know about them so…I just want you to know that I’m helping you because it sucks being alone in this mess. If you were wondering why I’m helping you…it’s because I don’t want to be alone anymore in this than you do.”
“So inspiring…” Persephone told him, wiping away a tear. George nodded, looking dramatically solemn.
Persephone carefully folded her legs under her on the bed, as not to disrupt the perfectly made bed and glanced around. It was so…cozy. She looked back at Ron, who was watching almost sheepishly.
Then, Professor Sinastra welcome Persephone very directly to the class and had her detail her dance experience.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and, like Flitwick, he paused at Persephone’s name.
“Oh! You can use mine, if you want to!” She offered up her wand. “I’m not really getting anywhere with this anyway.”
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
"And...and did he seem at all interested in Fluffy?” She forced herself to say the name, feeling horror seep into her system. Panic was next.
The few conversations that had been going on by the students that were occupying the common room halted and instead, whisperings took their places as everyone stared up at her. Blushing, she looked away, hoping to make a quick getaway, when, “Lily!”
Persephone edged to her bed, staring at Pansy who hadn’t gotten up. She raised a brow and Pansy stared right back before giggling, “Oh dear, is this your bed?” When Persephone nodded, she shrugged, “I won’t look. Go on, don’t be shy.”
The troll stopped, peering inside and Persephone noticed it was slowly looking at the wall—it hadn’t noticed them. Persephone pushed Hermione slowly, as not to move too fast, but then it saw them. They froze. The troll looked at them in surprise.
"Nothing!,” he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts— I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy."
"Calm yourself, dear girl, you are a little behind the times," Dumbledore was still smiling. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned." Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. This was some of the first examples of magic any of the first years had seen, so it was normal that everyone sat up in their desks and eagerly inclined their heads to learn.
Another thing about Persephone’s appearance was that she had a very thin scar on her forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. She had had it as long as she could remember, and the first question she could ever remember asking her Aunt Petunia was how she had gotten it. Aunt Petunia had no answer, and set the rule that she was not allowed to ask further questions.
As always, she exited the Gryffindor common room early to head to the library and return a book. Ben had been waiting by another painting, staring off into space when she had passed him. She hadn’t even realized she’d passed him until he suddenly jumped to life, calling her name. She turned in surprise.
"Everyone thinks I'm special," She tried. "Those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... I just don’t understand how…” She lost her trail of thought. “I’ve worked for everything—because I’ve had to. Boys in my class always put me down because I’m a girl and I have to prove them wrong but then—I don’t know,” She whined. “I set expectations for myself doing so—I’m smart but it sucks because I’ll never be smart enough. I know how to fix things and I can name most of the scientific names for every dog breed—but if I miss one, I’ve just let everyone down—and myself. And here,” She frowned. “I’ve done something, that I didn’t even know I did, and everyone will expect great things—and, sure yes, I can do wandless magic but there isn’t a textbook on my list required for a wandless class in school—I know nothing of magic. How can they expect great things?”
‘The chamber, yes…’ She closed her eyes, laying her head on the desk that she, Ron and Hermione were working at. ‘Right…right…what could Salazar Slytherin possibly have left behind when he left?’
They passed into the entrance hall, where Persephone saw through a large doorway between the big staircases that people, funeral guests, had arrived beforehand and were mingling quietly with each other. Hades, however, led them away quickly, up the stairs.
He stopped and looked at her. He looked different now. His hair was a mess and his face was still pale but there was something different about him. She looked him up and down and realized—it was the first time she’d seen him in the uniform. He was wearing the white-button down, no tie.
“Here, dear, place this to your chest, where your heart is,” Madame Pomfrey handed her a little silver looking thing that usually belonged to a stethoscope. She placed it to her heart after Madame Pomfrey turned a dial on it. She felt some sort of relaxing state as she touched the thing, as if her heart was set back to its normal pace. She assumed it must, as to check for any heart palpitations. Instead of having one person listened to her heart, the thing was not connected to anything. Madame Pomfrey held a similar looking circular thing that she placed on the desk.
She came upon what was a brick wall. She stared for a moment and stared up. Yes, a wall. She let her hand hover above the wall, feeling the texture. It was cold and hard. No doubt a wall. What had possessed her to go further into the library? How was she supposed to get—oh!
After the utter shock of the American family being wizards, they had somehow talked the Dursleys in to drive her to a little restaurant as a celebration of the kids being back.
Wood now looked down at Persephone like she’d just answered all his prayers. "Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
“Why? Why did he want to scare you off me? He barely notices I’m around so what’s so special about me?”
Mischievous grins spread across their faces as they looked at one another, “We can definitely make that happen.”
“Malfoy!” She called to him and he turned on instinct and immediately regretted it when he saw it was her.
was evidently the right password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. She gaped at it—she was about to turn around and walk away.
The sweet evening air had never felt better. She felt the high of the past hour lift her spirits quickly—Gryffindor’s lifting her up, her friends cheering in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron with a nosebleed for some reason…
Everyone stared at this and Madame Pomfrey seemed to be concentrating, “Have you had any accidents recently?”
"I—don't—want—” Percy tried to say thickly, but the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"What have you been telling her?" Bane asked. "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets? Ronan?" He turned to the other centaur.
“We must have a drink sometime!” Mr. Weasley insisted delightfully. “What is that you’ve got there? Oh, you’ve got Muggle money—exchanging it? Oh—Molly look!” He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger’s hand.
“Well—actually, it’s for your eyes,” He said. “Like eye drops—its Mediterranean water, just off the coast of France. The pearls too—from France,” She touched the pearls that hung from either side of the vial. “A drop into each of your eyes will make you see much better, and they last for a long time too, so no chance of running out—and I thought this was cool, so if you look into the water you can see the ocean and like if you move the vial, it’ll be like your in the water looking around and you can see the sky—I thought it was cool and now that I’m explaining it, it isn’t that cool—” He had rambled and now waited for her response.
Persephone could not find it in herself to be cruel to her, so she sighed and let go of the door. She returned to her alter and made sure to move slightly so Hermione could see, “It’s a Spanish holiday. It’s called Los Dias de Los Muertos. The Day of the Dead. Today we honor those who are no longer with us, by setting out their favorite things and pictures. It’s the day the dead can cross the border of life and the afterlife to join their loved ones, to visit.” She pursed her lips, staring down at the wavering candle fire. “It’s also the day my parents died. It’s been ten years since and I wanted to…I don’t know, meet them halfway through the border?”
Her shackles were connected to the metal tongs sticking near the fireplace while his were by the window. She winced at how tight they were and pulled a tad—it was painful to her.
Persephone’s mouth dried and she nodded fervently, feeling cold all over. Narcissa’s chin raised and she nodded. Persephone wanted so badly to excuse herself but she was currently terrified, frozen in her place.
Even more confused, she looked at him in question but then glanced down to find the dishes in front of her were now piled with food. She had never seen so many things to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
“Coincidences, I’m sure,” Her eyes lingered on his head as he looked down at his camera. Suddenly, he met her eyes and she looked away.
?" She gasped. Those did not seem like good pets to keep—unless, like owls, they were trained and used in normal times in the wizarding world.
She decided Dean would be a last resort. During lunch, she visited the library, intent on finding out what other possible wand cores there were. She found a promising book—unicorns, phoenixes, dragons, she knew about. Then, there was siren hair, siren scale, thestral hair, giant hair, veela hair, acromantula web, fairy wings, hippogriff feather, thunderbird feather, vampire fangs, most DNA samples of werewolves and even Basilisk skin.
While Potions and Transfiguration were the most interesting, Charms looked to be the most fun, only because she understood each spell and charm incantation. Most spells and charm incantations were in Latin, which was very lucky for Persephone, who’d made the connections between Spanish and Latin. She also picked up a book on Latin from the library as well.
It looked like a family tree of some sort and a few moments of examination that it was her family’s tree, printed out in miniature writing. She stared dumb at the parchment dumbly before she blinked hard.
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Fred Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Lily, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Persephone had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Persephone at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Phoney was talking to it, weren't you, Phoney?"
“Magic-stealers—no, that’s—” Persephone tried but the girl had grabbed her hand and pulled her in, shoving her onto a seat.
They waited in the dark, with only the sounds of Norbert thrashing about in his crate and only ten minutes passed before four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.
Super, suuuper long chapter, I know. I was wondering what you guys thought of my slight AU with the whole sirens and Ben thing. Also what house does Ben belong to? I'm having trouble placing him...enjoy!
She sat by the Trevi Fountain, again with gelato, wondering how much trouble she’d get in for swimming in the fountain. Shouldn’t sirens get privileges? They walked along the Tiber, and she was overwhelmed with emotion at knowing she was at the place where Remus and Romulus were once said to have been. Ben had annoyingly gotten several pictures of her crying by the river and she wouldn’t speak to him for an hour. They wandered the narrow streets of Trastever, on the west bank of the Tiber River.
“Don’t turn out your toes too much,” She instructed, “That puts too much stress in the knees. Just follow the natural turn out line. Put your arms out like this,” She examined him and found he did very well, “Huh. You’re really flexible. How much did you dance?”
It was indeed as though ice was flooding her body. She put the bottle down and walked forward; sshe braced himself, saw the black flames licking her body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment she could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
On the other side of the war line, Mr. Weasley struggled over to them with Fred and George by his sides. "Much too crowded in here—let’s head outside.” He was saying but his words were cut off when he caught sight of the tall man behind Hades and Malfoy.
Hermione straightened, pulling herself slightly together, “You are—the most brilliant witch of this century—if not now, than you will be. And…and you’re my best friend.”
“Where’s Hades?” She asked, looking around. He was usually seen with the twins and different house common rooms didn’t keep them apart.
Persephone looked up. Whenever the opportunity arose that Persephone could be sent to Mrs. Figg’s house, the Dursleys would send her. They knew how much she hated that house. It always smelled like cabbage and there were dead stuffed cats on the shelves. The mad old woman would always have something for Persephone to fix and Persephone didn’t want to argue with the woman about how nothing was broken and that taking apart a chair to figure out why it squeaked wasn’t worth it. On good days, they spent the day looking at pictures of cats.
“Moon phases matter in wand making—well, for specific wand woods, I mean.” He said. They were headed to the Forbidden Forest. Did she trust him not to kill her? She was not sure yet. “It’s a new moon tonight.”
“If I may, we have no idea about any dragons or anything about Malfoy being out tonight but…Professor, Hermione and I, we’ve been tutoring Neville. Tonight, we were doing Astronomy, that’s why we were out in the middle of the night.”
"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
Malfoy and Persephone set up their prank in the hall outside the room and waited. Ron was itching to use his concealed little cupcake to shove down Malfoy’s face, but Persephone shook her head—not just yet.
But school was nearly over and it was now Dudley's birthday—the most important time of year. Her cousin was usually bullying her in secret, as apparently, boys bullying girls was greatly frowned upon, but today, he could bully her all in all as a gift. She had no math homework of his to complete for him, so it was back to the summer season of physical abuse and maniac taunting from him.
When she finished helping Aunt Petunia place out dishes and offer everyone wine, she made a move to sit next to aunt Petunia, but Thomas intervened, “Sit next to me, won’t you?”
Persephone smiled, “Well then I’m sure your grandfather will be pleased for your participation in celebrating the past and being so interested with your heritage.” She cocked her head to the side. “I do adore the vintage aesthetic of it. Oh wait—unless you’re…oh, what’s the word for it?” She snapped her fingers in a dramatic attempt to show she was thinking for the word.
He buried the seeds and grabbed a few nearby twigs that he stabbed into the ground, as a way to mark the ground. They were not far enough in the forest for it to be scary but it was certainly ominous looking. She looked around and shuddered, not from the cold though.
Persephone looked at him in surprise, “Because anxiety is caused by a sense of fear and when your body believes it is eating, it believes it is safe enough to eat and there is no danger, thus no fear, and lesser anxiety, yes, how did you know that?” She asked quickly.
Her friends had claimed two desks and consisted of Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott and Ernie MacMillan. Only Justin and Hannah had forms in their hands.
Persephone smiled nervously, passing her in smiles. Mrs. Weasley patted her hair once before turning to her sons once more, “So.”
Everyone’s eyes turned to look at her, in shock. She waited, staring up at Lucius Malfoy. He pursed his lips, “Well, a prime example of how little muggle brought up witches are taught. Have you no respect, girl, of the trauma that has been brought on my family? How dare you ask such a question?”
It was Malfoy—he seemed interested in what they were talking about and was probably still listening. She dragged them away to Herbology.
He shrugged, “You’re a phenomenal flyer.” He said and she looked away, tapping against the ground. “And I think I know why you’re mad at me.” She raised a brow but didn’t look at him. She stared at the dying sun. “You think I trashed the play set, right? Because I asked you to quit and then it was trashed and it…I mean, it makes sense.”
“Well, of course they won’t be, and neither will you,” She smiled almost knowingly. “Persephone, darling, are you aware of a weekly to monthly allowance your aunt and uncle receive for taking…care of you throughout your life?” Persephone shook her head. “Well, they receive a certain amount of money each week to be able to foster you. The day you left for Hogwarts, I made it a point to remind them that they will not be fostering you for nine months of the year and…convinced them to allow me to set up a bank account for you to put the money they receive for you.”
Aunt Petunia worked very hard to teach Persephone what she called, “being a proper young lady”, something Persephone had a hard time doing. She would make her sit by her in a certain position when she would sew and she would make her change the flowers in the bedrooms. She made her cook and clean and keep her back straight and her hair perfectly kept. If she didn’t try so hard, Persephone’s hair would be in its natural state of chaos. It was lucky she could tame it with seconds of hard concentration.
It wasn’t the fact that she was brewing potions for the hospital wing that her ancestor had invented that made her think really hard. It was the fact that Hardwin Potter, his eldest son, was married to Iolanthe Peverell and that she was a direct descendant of them. It was the name Peverell that was bothering her—she had heard it somewhere before.
“Ambitious and clever yet a flare for justice…” At that second, her kitten meowed loudly. The Hat almost laughed, “And a disregard to the rules, it seems…”
“Illegal?” She gasped. “But—but so many classes are based off ideas brought up with ancient magic! How can it be illegal?”
“When we were in our first year—young, carefree, innocent—” She snorted at this. “We got into quite the spot of trouble with Filch.”
“Right you are!” Georgie said, grabbing around the neck and wringing his knuckle against his hair, “Glad to find you aren’t influenced by the pale gits.”
‘Well…I’m not sure about abuse,’ but of course it was abuse, for what else could it be? It certainly wasn’t well-meaning. They simply hated her. ‘But my aunt does treat me nicely some days. She brushes my hair and always brings fresh flowers to my bedroom, when no one else is home, of course.’
“Right,” Persephone got out of the car, disoriented. They were in front of what was called, ‘Hog’s Head Inn,’ written on a sign, advertising with a wild board’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. Next to the door hung a sign, declaring that the sale of unicorn blood was forbidden, and that anyone who asked about it would be thrown out. “And…has George or Fred ever mentioned
Thomas looked at her, nodding, before turning to Uncle Vernon, “Well, seeing as you put up a very convincing case and I can see you are a family man, I feel as if though I have no other choice but to order with you.”
“Welcome, children, to The Wizard of Oz, the Musical!” Professor Flitwick called the students to attention. “Please pass your forms to the front and we can begin!”
Fred saw the same, though he was quieter. “I see the joke shop, too…you don’t think this shows the future?”
The pain worsened and it felt very realistically like her eyeballs were being tugged out of her head. They felt so hot right now—she would start crying if she could. It was dark—black. She couldn’t open her eyes, everything stung her eyes. Even the air!
"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today—”
Percy straightened, “Well, as prefect—and your brother—I’m coming with you to make sure nothing stupider happens tonight.”
He turned his chin up and then, to her surprise, a smirk crossed his face, “And this question? What are you willing to contribute in return?”
Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a sabre-toothed tiger.
But they did end up tickling the pear. The pear giggled and turned into a large green door handle, revealing the entrance to the kitchens. The girls smiled at each other.
“Yeah it’s just…I mean, Patrick has asked people that question before—about having theatre crushes. A lot of people have said you and…well, they always ended up in the hospital wing the same day and avoid Ben religiously…”
“Wait, this would be Draco Malfoy as in” George turned around to look at her, “Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
“You’d better open it, Ron,” Neville said in a timid whisper. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and”—he gulped—“it was horrible.” As if to prove Neville’s point, the letter began to smoke at the corners.
Several Slytherins around her stared but she ignored them, plucking the book out of Hades’ hands. He let it go easily, as if though he wasn’t actually reading it and simply using it as a way to avoid social interactions. He stared at her and she smiled, “Hello.”
She barely remembered what she’d planned that night to get him back with. She’d be fully supportive of him even sending her hate mail right now, just to insure everything had truly happened.
‘Red for energy, passion and action—I think,’ She thought to herself when she saw the Gryffindor table themed red. She couldn’t quite remember what red stood for exactly. Green, for Slytherin, stood for life, nature, jealousy and money. Something of revival, always full of energy.
Persephone looked down at her legs. She’d taken her socks off and her tights off so she was only wearing her skirt and her legs were bare. She saw immediately what Hermione meant. Up along both legs was what looked like a rash growing.
“Yeah, hyperactive thyroid gland, electrolyte imbalance, serotonin syndrome and Reye syndrome, severe brain trauma, spinal cord injury—do you think that’s because of your scar?” He asked, staring at her forehead, making a play to poke it.
“Oh please!” She laughed. “Who else is there?” The three exchanged a look and Persephone raised a brow.
She thought back to the glass that she melted and thought, perhaps she could warm herself. A few minutes in the cold passed and started to focus on her hands—they were stiffening up but after a while, she could feel her heart quicken and heat spread through her veins and she could swear that saw smoke from her pinky finger. She shivered once more.
Persephone hesitated, “Not a tutor—he was a family friend. He taught me Spanish, and from Spanish I taught myself French, as they as so similar, and I picked up Latin some time ago, along with Ancient Greek, though I’m not yet fluent. Now I’m teaching myself Italian,” She smiled. Ancient Greek from Percy Jackson, of course.
She watched, petrified to the spot, not daring to breathe too harshly in fear of the stone falling. She watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.
She shrugged, “Could work,” She bit her lip, “Did you read through this entire thing or can I keep it?”
Persephone accepted her schedule and found she had been put in the same Gryffindor group again, thank heavens.
She couldn’t go back. She was by far too nervous. Instead, she went to the girl’s bathroom, where she ran the water. She ducked her hands under the faucet and bent her head to wash her face.
She had a strange feeling this wouldn’t be the worse rule she’d be breaking but she marched in further and joined him, refusing to meet his eye. “Let’s just hurry up, please.”
He cast some spell that Persephone didn’t catch and she found herself unable to move away from the tree. She stared at him as he caught Malfoy by the arm and whispered an incantation. Malfoy stilled and then blinked and he sent him running. Then he turned back to Persephone. Fang barked and Ben looked at him and then the dog whined, looking down.
“Nice to meet you,” Hades told her, clasping her smaller hand. Surprising her, he leant over it to brush his lips lightly over her knuckles. She stared at him incredulously before he straightened. She noticed the hand on his shoulder tighten. He straightened slightly, his jaw clasped tightly together.
"Are you sure that's a real spell?" the girl asked skeptically. "Well, it's not very good, is it? The spells I’ve tried have all worked for me—granted they were simple and just for practice, but it was rather grand, since nobody in my family’s magic at all. It was ever such a big surprise to us when I got my letter—but I’m rather pleased, I’ve heard Hogwarts is the very best school of witchcraft there is, as I've heard—I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough—oh, and I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
pretty girl with blonde hair and a perfectly symmetrical face smiled at her in a friendly, though curious, manner. “Theodore Nott,” A skinny boy with neatly trimmed, “And this is Draco Malfoy.”
They just looked at her, smiling with such adoration, she’d never felt, or even seen, such adoration. Anywhere.
“We can…we can set them back up,” Hermione’s small voice rung in her head. “See, the snitch is fine—and look, the lilies aren’t damaged at all! It just your…scarf….Look, I’ll come with you, and we’ll put it back together, okay?”
"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried. Of course, Mr. Di Angelo—or should I say Black?—has been tending to your wounds.”
that his only fans are witches,” He said. She scowled. “You’re smart, you’re not head over heels for a pretty face—but most witches are.”
She certainly did not feel happy, “How am I supposed to sound happy while singing?” She finally asked.
“Maybe I’ll set the house on fire instead,” She said thoughtfully. “Maybe start with your computer, then your room.” She told him and watched with satisfaction as he panicked, howling for his mother.
"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Lily’s won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!" Hermione shrieked, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Afterwards, they visited the galleria dell’Accademia. It was to Ben's great pleasure that they were allowed to take pictures and now she had a picture of her standing next to David, something that a 26-year-old Michelangelo had carved out of a single block of marble 500 years ago. It was absolutely beautiful…
Persephone gasped, harshly enough that her chest heaved down and the stone fell down to the little place where her shirt was tucked into her skirt. Thank god for her clothes fitting right and tight, as it settled there now. She raised her hands to her mouth to keep from screaming.
“Miss Potter, I will need for you to come see me every day, without fail,” Madame Pomfrey told her. “I’ll write you a letter of excuse to give to your professors to be excused from class. Until further notice, you won’t be attending any Quidditch practices or dance classes, am I being clear?”
“Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present, the Marauder’s Map.”
“Well it’s your own—” Hermione started saying but Persephone kicked her under the table, giving her a look.
“They’re called thestrals,” He told her. She glanced to see his peculiar eyes captivated by the little one. “Only certain people can see them.”
“Of course not, sir, nor with me, sir,” Mr. Borgin said with a deep bow. “I must also mention, sir, how honorable it is for your recent addition to the family—”
“It…seems, and now this is just a first impression diagnosis, but…Ms. Potter may be suffering from an undiagnosed illness—she’s showing several, serious symptoms of a hyperactive thyroid gland, electrolyte imbalance, serotonin syndrome and Reye syndrome, which could be the cause of a severe brain trauma or a spinal cord injury.” She spoke in all medical terms, in a soothing voice. Persephone didn’t understand any of the words she spoke.
She had informed Hermione of this. Granted, Hermione, too, was influenced by Persephone’s friendship—even Ron’s, too, as the three were now a known trio. She was more relaxed about rule breaking since the incident and a lot nicer, too. When she had told her of the incident, Hermione had jumped the gun and loudly told her to quit the play. Persephone outright refused.
Aunt Petunia intervened with a compliment and Persephone turned to her dinner. She was hopefully doing okay. She thought she was.
"You—Weasley—why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another five points you've lost for Gryffindor."
She held in a scream, as she was without air at the moment and stared up at the thing, and she stumbled back, her feet snapping a few twigs. The small noise proceeding made the thing jump and back up.
“Thanks, Lily… I think I'll go to bed…” Neville started to walk away but he bumped into the table, his legs still seeming asleep to some degree.
"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger brother began to cry.
She paused, surprised at this—he had known she and her friends had snuck out but he wasn’t punishing them? “It…shows us our hearts greatest desires.”
“They’ve never pranked me,” She twirled a strand of green hair. “Weird prank, but efficient.” She sighed. “I think I gave them the idea back in first term.”
“You know—this and that,” He laughed, almost nervously (?). He was tall and handsome but seeing him almost overwhelmed with nerves was strange. “So, what’s up?”
Persephone fought against every instinct to gawk at him and kept a straight face—but what? Did he just…cover for her? Like—save her from being expelled for literally forging a signature, something that was very much illegal??
She watched, again, at the students around her. It was when she glanced at Neville, who was on her desk, that she gasped—he was dropping the porcupine quills into his cauldron while it was still over the fire, “Neville no—!” She tried but it was too late.
So her mother had been…a magician. Alright. Fine. Persephone saw the proof of that passed right down to her—but she would not go to this school. She would in no way turn out like her mother. No matter if she looked like her, had powers like her that would be it. She was in no way connected to the magician that abandoned her on the Dursley’s front steps. Who does that? Just leave a baby on a doormat in the middle of the night! What if she had crawled into the street? If someone had taken her?! Honestly.
Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "Of course yer smart, with a mum like yers, but that ain’t what I mean. About our world, your world. Yer parents' world."
“You have finished in record time, Miss Potter, why do you think that?” McGonagall could tell she was trying to figure it out before Persephone realized quick enough.
Before she could finish, an excited chatter broke out amongst the dancers, looking eagerly across the bar, mouthing something to their friends. Persephone, feeling out of place, had no idea what La Revolution de Danse was. She simply concentrated on her frappe.
Aunt Petunia was just as good as sensing the danger, too, because she quickly said, “And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”
Persephone, in that moment, liked him. Sure, he had the opposite side of a food chain when she’d wanted a friend with a cat, but he understood about meeting expectations that people set—but it sounded like he’d had it worse. She couldn’t imagine having to meet so many expectations only to be told someone else had done it better—never mind that someone would be a sibling. He wasn’t expecting anything out of her, and she decided she wanted to befriend this boy, if he’d let her.
"Oh for the love of—what, Malfoy? Feeling braver being on the ground? Or is your two idiot friends that boost your confidence up to an unbearably annoying amount?” She breathed out, exasperated.
Her legs were painfully sore so even getting dressed was terrible. She did the routine Oliver had them do with the boys and then collapsed next to Cedric. Cedric sat by her and glanced at her several times.
She thought about the conversation for a long moment as she walked to rehearsals—she wasn’t surprised. He seemed very accepting of everything and everyone—he was accepting of her being a siren, at least. The only thing he’d ever had a problem with, a serious problem with, was with older boys having a crush on a younger girls. She’d talked to him about the punching boys rumor and he’d told her not to flatter herself and that he wasn’t only interested in hospitalizing boys that had crushes on her.
Persephone went downstairs slower than usual later, at just half pasted seven, not being used to heels and came into the kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without refreshing Youtube on some strange, gaming channel.
“Miss Parkinson, please,” Professor Flitwick cleared his throat and he seemed to have tears in his eyes (?). “Miss Potter, how absolutely incredible—your voice is—”
“Ron!” Persephone yelled, her scream echoing with the other shouts. It seemed like the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.
"No backup up here, Malfoy.” She smiled brightly. “So let me save you the humiliation and offer you a chance to hand it here!”
It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. She didn’t care much for it, as she was ready to pull him out of the car as soon as she had verification that he hadn’t broken anything bad. Her own wand was still in her pulled up hair, now wet from her unplanned swim in the lake.
She tried her best to keep that strut Pansy always pulled off, trying not to trip over her own feet. No one found this out of order, though she was the only person moving against the crowds of students walking into the Great Hall.
she thought as she sighed, lying down in front of the passage, arms first. Her arms found something study, and she pulled herself in, sliding easily. My god, she was skinny. Standing up in the dark, she brushed herself off, coughing with the dust, before placing the book back in place. As she did that, sudden torches on the walls lurched to life, and warm light abused her eyes. She blinked heavily, her eyes adjusting to the sudden light and then found herself standing at the top of a staircase, torches lighting the path all the way down.
She crossed her legs and undid her knot of hair on the top of her head. Wet curls fell to her shoulders in knots.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Persephone, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
Mrs. Weasley treated Persephone very nicely. It seemed Mrs. Weasley deeply appreciated having a girl in the house and despite living with her aunt, Persephone adored helping Mrs. Weasley. With dinner or little chores, she was appreciated for doing them, something she’d never felt before. In the mornings, when Persephone would appear dressed in a sundress with her hair done in a braid of some sort, Mrs. Weasley would compliment her sweetly, something that made her warm on the inside. She taught her to cook some of the best dishes and never got angry when Persephone did something wrong with the recipe, always helping her correct her mistake.
Hermione and Persephone headed into what Ron called ‘every wizard’s nightmare’, which really was just a cosmetics sort of shop. Persephone and Hermione each bought bobby pins that didn’t move from their designated spots and hair ties that took longer to rip—perfect for girls with thick hair. Persephone bought new gel and a new hairbrush, the newer model thank god, hers was getting cranky. It made a style last twice as long.
"Do you realize who this is, Bane?" Firenze said. "This is the Potter girl. The quicker she leaves this forest, the better, especially under the moon we have tonight.”
She’d never been outright starved by the Dursleys. She was given bread instead of actual meals during punishments. Peppermints, on occasions. She was sometimes not allowed to eat until chores were done and even then, meals were never more than to sustain herself. Dudley had made it his job to take anything she’d wanted to eat—and if it were anything healthier than he liked, he’d throw it into the trash right in front of her. She was cautious, out of practice, when she reached for the gravy.
"Seize her! SEIZE HER!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Persephone right off her feet. He took hold of her neck and before she could start screaming on instinct, he was screaming in agony.
Silently, she let the cabinet door close and she winced at the creak it made. She was surely done for now.
They floated on the mattress, invisible, through the corridors, Ron keeping the spell steady and Persephone getting the hang of the charm quickly. At some point, they passed by Filch, who sniffed as if though he could smell them. Before Percy could panic, Persephone lifted them right above Filch. They had to reign in Fred and George, who thought maybe casting a quick prank on Filch was worth it, and would be a missed opportunity if they didn’t—very well, he couldn’t see them.
She read it through and said, “Well, he says I won’t grow a tail unless I’m in my native body of water—which we don’t know—and that to soothe during full moons would to be just to be in a body of water.” She looked up, “Soothe?”
She’d found a place, during her Potions class. She asked to use the laboratory, and found the bathroom in the dungeons—it was cold but clean and there was a space in the very back that was lit by a torch, a little space that wasn’t needed. She thought she could find someplace better but it was secluded and quiet here.
He laced his hands together in front of his eyes, “You clearly didn’t think—a girl feels like a boy and you ask her if she’s just a tomboy? What the hell is the matter with you?”
“Oh, it was dreadful!” She said with relish. “It happened right here, in this very stall!” Persephone pushed herself up, heading for the faucet to drink. Sirens need water, right? “I remember it so well! I’d hidden here because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked and I was crying,” Persephone, having taken a long pause in breathing to drink the water, felt her pulse lightened. “Then I heard someone come in. They said something funny, almost in a language that they made up. Anyway, what really got me was that it was some boy speaking, in the girl’s bathroom! So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet and then—”
Upon seeing Hades, she had immediately looked around the room, looking for anyone she recognized from her house, but found all the students were wearing green and silver.
The girls were much too tired to talk any more. No sooner had Hermione exclaimed, “I can’t wait until classes start!” had Persephone fallen asleep.
She noticed a tall jug by the window and made her way to it immediately. Without thinking it through, she pulled a Percy Jackson and doused herself head first with the water in the jug. She didn’t even close her eyes—all she knew was that her body was thirsty.
A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Persephone stared at it as Ron was stunned. Gradually, the little amount of laughter died down and the loud chatter broke out once more.
‘Renee?’ Persephone mouthed to herself. What had she said? Something about not knowing about boys. And then she had said something about being barely a girl and Persephone understood. “Listen, girls are allowed to be friends with boys. There’s no rules—people who think with gender norms instead of reality are idiots.”
The little creature had large bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Persephone knew, without a doubt that she had seen this morning.
Madame Pomfrey came back and checked over everything and, finding everything as it was when she originally checked her—in her own words, neither better or worse—she allowed her to return to class.
Persephone was confused as to what the passage meant but she did like the hint of ‘ancient magic’ so she slid the book into her bag and continued.
…’ Why do you think he kept such a close watch on you at all times? You think he wanted to spend his time at a school production of the Wizard of Oz?” He cackled. “You think he didn’t have better things to do than referee a Quidditch match? He had grown paranoid—it had come to a point where he didn’t consider Dumbledore’s presence to be reassuring enough that I could not try anything again.”
She indicated at Persephone and he finally turned, only his head, to look down upon her. “This student has presented me with a note she claims was written by you. As I know you do not write notes for first years, I thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention that a student is forging your signature.”
‘Clever…?’ She thought hard. What would he use? The only thing she knew of the headmaster was that he liked…candy?
“Three!” Mr. Ollivander cried, “Merlin, you were right, Ben!” Tittering excitedly around the table, he took both seeds carefully and put them aside. “Willow, Aspen and English Oak…how interesting…It seems that three will be your lucky number here, Miss Potter.”
“If you don’t mind your business, I’d say you’ll get yourself in a lot of trouble,” He told her. After a long second of staring at each other, he looked away, “And no, it’s not.”
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells."
Persephone snickered as Ron grabbed her schedule, pointing out the hearts she’d drawn around each of Lockhart’s lessons.
There was nothing left to do now except wait. She knew with great confidence that Snape would have no objections to having Persephone switch into his house. It was only the very first week of the school year, and she knew the total of house points she had earned in the last three days was less than ten.
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Persephone found it awkward when she said quietly, “Lily, sir.”
"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone—find it, but not use it—would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes...Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them—but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?"
She had just now smelled the pungent odor of the green blanket and forced herself to breathe from her mouth. Trying her best not to let the soreness overpower her legs, she stood up.
Persephone smiled, “Our secret.” Perfect! Already a secret! She held out her pinkie, “I pinkie promise.”
They paused by the balcony, deciding it would look less suspicious if they were five minutes apart. Persephone went first, looking very lowkey as she wandered down the stairs. She recognized the Greengrass family—Estelle and William Greengrass. She smiled as she approached them, “Hello.”
It was still September, so the weather hadn’t gotten too cold, but it was still early so the outer robes were needed. The boys, practiced with gentlemen manners probably, let the girls go in with a hand, before getting in themselves. Daphne seemed to make her intentions clear with the other purebloods and neither Pansy nor Draco took their place next to Hades, who sat opposite from Persephone. This gave Daphne a nice seat next to him, her sister by her other side. This, however, meant Pansy and Draco had a silent eye fight about who was stuck next to Persephone. Persephone would be dissatisfied with either so she kept quiet, staring out the window.
Snape looked up, his eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
George’s voice was breezier and had a bit of a permanent amused tone to it. Fred’s had a different tone. George was easier to tell.
Susan, too, was on her side but like, seven people against a thousand or so people. Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Persephone, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
"What would three Gryffindor students be doing inside on such a day like this? Finished with all your exams and not enjoying the weather, someone might think you were…” His eyes lingering on Persephone. “Up to something.”
Persephone knew of quick sortings, but she had never heard of someone being sorted before the hat even touched your head. The girl skipped to her house’s table, sitting happily. Persephone followed her with her eyes, wondering if she would recognize Persephone for who she was. She had red hair now, and legs, but could she discern her as the fish-girl?
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford the tip of the handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." He grinned nastily at Persephone. “Why don’t I turn you in for this? Being famous won’t save you from being expelled, and it won’t help you for when my father hears about what you’ve done to me.”
“Anyway, Percy wouldn’t lend because apparently he’s got so many new friends to write to,” George said sarcastically. “Been acting very oddly all summer, hasn’t he? Sending lots of letters, never coming out of his room…I mean, there’s only so many times one can polish a prefect badge without breaking their hand off—you’re driving too far west, Fred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.
Aunt Petunia said nothing but stared for a moment before leaving, leaving Persephone to her thoughts. She stared at the chain looking thing on the sheets and took a hesitant step towards it. It was a necklace, with a round white studded, the size of maybe a quarter, an oval shaped quarter, hanging from a long, golden chain.
“You said what?” Ben—Hades exclaimed, stopping their walk. She was explaining the conversation to him and his sudden outburst made her look at him in surprise. “Say that again?”
They quickly made for the door and Persephone, the key struggling in her hand, shoved the key into the lock and turned—one of the best sounds in the world, the key clicking in place and unlocking the door.
giant, at least. That much was visible—he looked very tall and very strong, strong enough to lift all the Dursley’s with one hand. He did have a beard, though it was wild and tangled and blended in with his long, shaggy mane of hair on his head. His face was almost completely hidden by his wild hair but she could make out his eyes—black and warm, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. He did not even have a trident—Persephone would have been disappointed if she weren’t terrified.
The last full day the students had everyone feeling some sort of way. Nostalgia between the leaving students and excitement for those who would come next year. Everyone was, more or less, looking forward to the summer holiday. All except Persephone, who was sure she would not be allowed to go on the Italy trip with the Johnsons and had the Dursley’s for company.
“Dammit Longbottom!” Malfoy took off. Completely impulsively, Persephone chucked the dye straight at him before yelling for them run. Malfoy had disappeared, looking more red haired by the time he was gone.
"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Persephone. "I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."
. So, undeniably boring that she half wished Voldemort would come rushing in to kill her, as she’d been worrying all through all her exams.
Persephone looked up as the crowd parted, whispering excitedly, and met Lockhart’s eyes. She then snapped her book shut and acted like the rest of the crowd, “Where?”
Persephone was not allowed any visitors, this much she learned when she asked Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, a nice but very strict woman. She was not allowed to see anyone who passed by to see her—not Daphne, not Susan, not the twins and most definitely not Ron and Hermione.
At some point, after feeding Salem and letting her purr herself to sleep very close to her chest, Persephone fell asleep only to wake up sweating a few hours later. She felt disoriented for a long moment and then she felt the full swing of her sudden nausea.
It seriously wasn’t funny—especially when George wasn’t anywhere to be seen and then suddenly popped up.
She reacted accordingly, and she ran for it. She slipped into a large black cabinet nearby, closing it behind them. She waited, breathing silently when a mere few seconds later, she heard the bell above a door clang and footsteps following immediately after.
She and her aunt did not look anything alike. Her aunt always pined her blonde hair up in the same curled to the side do. She was a tall, thin woman with a pearly white complexion that she always applied rouge to. She had a strange obsession over how her skin looked—she was adamant on her skin looking smooth. Persephone noticed how much women wanted the smooth feature, especially as they grew older. One of the neighbors that her aunt spied on with her abnormally long neck had plastic surgery to make her skin smoother—but it didn’t look too smooth any more.
She stood on her tiptoes to see and saw a tall figure follow Draco. This must be Draco’s father—he had the same pale, pointed face and identical glinting, emotionless grey eyes. He would have been handsome, had it not been for the look on his face that suggested he thought he was better than everyone and anyone.
Persephone recognized the name as something Susan’s friends had once mentioned.  Wasn’t it…Gilderoy Lockhart? She was accurate, as she read the fancy gold title on the book:
She smiled lightly, “It wasn't your fault. Truly, you didn’t know. I appreciate your apology though, however unnecessary,” She punched his shoulder jokingly.
“They have their own type of magic, I think.” She said. “They can even launch fire balls from their hands. I haven’t been able to do that just yet, not right anyway.”
“Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?” Persephone asked, changing the subject quickly. She’d rather not divulge all the details just there of her Professor’s friendship with her late mother.
The library was her very most favorite place. All those books…it had taken weeks to convince her aunt and uncle to allow her to get a card. Usually Aunt Petunia came with her to make sure she didn’t chose modern idea books, so she wouldn’t get any ‘dangerous ideas’. Whenever Diana took her, she’d let her hide the books in Diana’s room.
“Later,” He said, striding out of the Great Hall. She watched him go, almost regretfully. She had been looking forward to just talking to him.
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer full chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
After Bologna, they spent five days in Florence, where they visited the Duomo di Firenze, quickly becoming tired from the four hundred six-three steps in time spaces. They reached the lantern at the very top of the structure, which was apparently the highest point in central Florence. They visited the Uffizi, where Persephone nearly cried at seeing Botticelli’s finest pieces with her actual eyes. It wasn’t just the gallery which amazed her but the venue itself. It was architecturally fascinating, having been built in the 16
“Go on, no pushin’” Hagrid urged them in. The first years stumbled in, gazing around. Persephone’s breath was quite literally taken away and she was one of many who gasped.
She let out a shaky breath, quickly readying herself. She thought of Daphne. She could be friends with her. She would
Rehearsal times varied—sometimes they were in the morning, sometimes they were at lunch, and most often, after classes had finished. Everyone met up and ran through lines—they had not yet begun to act the lines out. The student teacher, Rhys Hansenn, was very proactive. He was a fifth year and had been in the theatre productions for a few years. He had an eye for finding the talented students anywhere and he was responsible for a good fifty percent of the set decorators and hair and makeup department.
Persephone felt that it best she was hiding and not out in the open because she was not too sure she would not start swinging.
“Besides, I used to sleep in a cupboard under some stairs when I was young so,” She said offhandedly. She did not know this was as very odd as for him to stop and say, with a blank face and a dead voice,
“Padma told me to tell you that Hermione says that Neville says he ran into Angelina Johnson who ran into Hades Black outside of the common room and that he needs to talk to you,” She said.
“Er, excuse me,” She grabbed her bag and rushed from the room. She didn’t make it far when her legs started to throb painfully. It was as if each step was a stab up her heels. She took her shoes off but this did not help.
The zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Persephone what she wanted before they could hurry her away, they bought her a cheap lemon ice pop. It was rather good, and she didn’t dare complain.
“Defenseless? That miserable nightmare scratched me up enough to deserve a hex—or two,” He laughed into her face. She scowled.
They shook the Weasleys hands and then Persephone’s and commented on how well maintained her teeth were—George snickered at her blush and she stepped, rather on purpose, on his foot.
“Didn’t know owl post came at night,” Persephone said, hurrying over to let her in. “Good, too, she probably has Charlie’s answer.”
All her non-magical friends gave her slips of papers with their number and some wrote them on her skin. She only made sure to memorize Hermione’s. The girls in their dorm all promised to write to each other as they talked and laughed, the countryside became greener and tidier.
