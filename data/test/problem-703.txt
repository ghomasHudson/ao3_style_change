“Don’t start,” he says, fond. Phone sex is so completely not an option that it’s not even funny. “It just makes me think of school.
to, her reputation is at stake — cut her off with a kiss, deep and filthy and much more appropriate for her image.
. He can bury all the squirming, longing feelings that have been collecting dust inside of him for the better part of two years, as long as it means they stop ignoring each other. If it means Draco talking to him again, Harry’ll gladly take a hammer to his own heart.
There’s a pause where Draco is absent-mindedly running the fingers of one hand over Potter’s skin, propped up with her chin on the other, on her front between Potter’s legs. Potter, to her credit, takes roughly twenty seconds to lie there boneless and then says, decisively, “Fuck,” and sits up, pulling Draco up with her until they’re kissing again, both up on their knees, Draco’s arms around Potter’s neck. She moans right into Draco’s mouth and tries to get them impossibly closer.
“D’you want me to—?” she asks, though she’s not sure she actually has the energy right now, but it doesn’t matter because Harry shakes her head — Draco can feel the movement on her shoulder.
It’s a good thing they’re in a hospital, because Draco almost opens his chest again for letting him believe in all that power of love bullshit, even for a minute.
“You can’t,” Draco says, swallowing around the lump in his throat, but Potter just shushes him softly, and everything goes dark.
Potter laughs and then sucks air in, harsh, through his teeth, his grip on Draco’s clothes tightening until his nails dig into the skin underneath. “Don’t try to be funny,” he gets out through gritted teeth.
been the trigger to break the loop, he’d just stunned himself and left Weasley and Granger to drag both his and Potter’s useless bodies from the wreckage. Still, no time to dwell.
go talk to Potter and embarrass herself so much she has to go into hiding, possibly abroad. Somewhere warm, where she doesn’t know anybody and she can drink wine with every meal.
The summer days, long enough to begin with, seem to stretch on longer and longer that week. Harry’s starting to think he might be losing his mind a little, keeps walking around in a sort of warm haze, the kind where he often catches himself standing, eyes unfocussed, staring unseeingly at random walls whilst his mind strays unhelpfully to Malfoy.
, but listen, there’s no time.” He pulls his jumper over his head, almost keels over as the movement makes his head throb in pain and presses it dizzily to Potter’s side. “Honestly, Draco,” he mutters to himself. “This is why you get the long-winded explanation bit out of the way
And he’s been in a permanent state of semi-arousal since Malfoy’s fucking move-in day, but that’s beside the point.
to do, there’s a whole list and getting Draco in his arms is only the very start of it, but he feels clumsy, uncertain. Draco, ever smooth, ever amused by Harry, laughs at him and pulls him into a hug.
“Harry,” Draco says into his hair, when Harry shows no signs of letting him out of the circle of his arms anytime soon. “They’ll quite literally launch the thing without me.”
They break into a supermarket opposite the hospital, Draco freezing the alarms and those weird camera things because he got really good at it a couple of bouts of petty thievery back, Granger filling up a trolley because she got over her moral high-ground around the same time. She doesn’t even try and leave any money in the till, though Draco hears her telling Weasley it’s because of
None of Harry’s limbs seem to know what to do when they come face to face at the top of the escalators. He knows what they
He looks it too. Draco doubts Potter’s ever done or thought or said anything that wasn’t genuine in his whole life. “It’s fine.”
“This party,” Blaise says, pulling his shirt over his head and falling backwards onto the bed. “Is it like, strictly a Gryffindor thing, or are they letting anyone in?”
“This is why I suggested we use my tent,” Draco says, watching Weasley try to shove the turkey into the tiny oven in their tiny tent kitchen. “It has two ovens and an aga.”
They go through the whole thing again, like it’s a play they’re rehearsing where Draco knows all the stage directions but can’t make anyone deviate from the script. Potter’s plan to take Dolohov by surprise fails rather spectacularly, and the small part of Draco that thought Potter might not get hurt, third time lucky and all that, is proved very wrong, very quickly.
Draco gets his hands around Potter’s wrists, a little tighter than necessary because of the teasing and his evident lack of grasp on the English language. He’s noticed himself doing it a lot since that first time; he likes feeling the pulse beat under the skin and he’s not about to do anything so ridiculous as hold Potter’s hand. This is close enough.
The moment passes and Potter’s eyes fall on the cover of Draco’s book as he hooks a leg over the sill, transferring his weight to his other foot. “Oh. I like that one.”
Potter had gone down to get a jumper because the night’s cold and by the time Draco had managed to process the potential idea of Potter wearing his clothes he’d missed his chance to actually offer one of his own. Potter’s back now, in his usual position, elbows on the window ledge and feet on the trellis.
He groans loudly, forgetting himself for a second, and debates shoving his fist in his mouth. Ginny might have been joking, but if this carries on he really will have to invest in a gag. If Malfoy hears him, there’s no way of explaining it. If he comes over here to see what all the noise is about..
Putting his robes on feels strange, after months of not wearing them. He waits long enough that he knows everyone will have arrived and filtered into the Great Hall, sitting on his bed listening to the noise of the castle slowly filling up again.
Potter makes an odd, aborted movement, hands shifting into his pockets. “I’ve been here since summer.”
Draco, climbing in ahead, turns back to him, smiles when he sees the look on Harry’s face, expression clearing until he looks ten years younger, just as excited as if this were novel to him, too, and not just an everyday part of his nine to five.
Draco stares at him. “Excuse me if I’m not at full social capacity at” -- he glances at the clock on his bedside table -- “quarter to one in the morning.”
They’re both on their best behaviour, mature and friendly whenever they have to interact. He slips up a few times, but only because Draco slips first, unthinkingly presses their shoulders together or turns to Harry, laughing at the kind of private joke they’re not supposed to have with each other anymore. You can’t just take those things
Ignoring Neville’s disbelieving eyebrows, Harry turns and reluctantly prods the lobsters out of the way to find the mustard he’d been looking for in the first place, then heads upstairs to eat in his room.
And he’s hard, obviously. Of course he’s fucking hard, it’s practically Pavlovian at this point. Malfoy could probably knock something off his desk and Harry’s dick would perk up at the thud.
“I nicked it when we were in the Ministry looking for the locket. Figured it might be useful.” She has the grace to look slightly abashed. “Obviously I didn’t think something like this was going to happen.”
“No,” he says now, rubbing the back of his neck. It’s a habit of his so Draco can’t tell if he’s in pain or not. “It’s fine, honestly. Sorry.”
“Hi, again,” Potter says, voice pitched loud over the music, her hands still on Draco’s waist. They’re not doing anything, they’re just— there, warm. Draco can feel the broom-callouses on them and she makes a bodily effort not to shiver.
blame him for being brave to the point of stupidity, still determined to go in there even with the chance he’ll end up with near-fatal injuries. If someone told
“He’s getting more blatant,” Luna says amiably, painting Ginny’s pinky bright orange. Ginny’s giggling so hard that she keeps missing and dotting the table with little coloured blobs.
Potter throws himself in front of Granger, wand raised. Dolohov casts something that Draco can’t hear, his mouth curling around the incantation, and Potter drops like a stone, taking Draco’s stomach with him.
The rest of the night blurs: Luna fleecing them all at poker, Pansy forcing him to dance with her for
going to pass out and either he dies or I wake up back on that street and have to do this all over again.”
Ginny looks at him, deadpan. “You don’t care about anyone else bringing people home. Hell, you should try being next door to Dean and Seamus, they’re at it all hours.”
“Harry, really,” Hermione reprimands with a sigh when she comes over and finds him on the sofa, all the lights off and Harry already on his second re-watch of the afternoon.
tells it, the start of the whole thing was Felix Walton’s fault. Harry never met Felix, a boy from one of Draco’s astrophysics classes that Draco was convinced was only there because he’d confused astronomy for astrology and ended up accidentally pursuing a career in magical space exploration instead of Divination, but he certainly
“Next time?” Draco asks, her pulse picking up. She hadn’t— she sort of expected this to be a one time thing.
“Not good enough to stay long past midnight.” Draco quirks an eyebrow, unsure why he’s said that. Potter doesn’t seem sure either, though the smile doesn’t leave his face.
“I suppose you’re excited to see your friends again,” he tells Potter, the pair of them curled facing each other in the centre of Draco’s bed.
“Exactly!” Draco spits, and resists the urge to just whack him over the head. He hasn’t tried that yet — if Potter’s unconscious he can’t run in there and get hurt. “So if you could, maybe, I don’t know,
Merlin. Draco pointedly opens the book again, tilting it the smallest amount after a minute to squint at Potter over the top of it. Potter doesn’t seem bothered that Draco hasn’t responded and has resorted to ignoring him; he’s sitting with his head back against the wall, staring into space, one hand pulling unconsciously at a loose thread in the rug. Draco sighs and throws his copy of The Tempest over, rolling onto his side and burying himself back in the story so he can’t watch Potter’s reaction.
He hears a snort next to him and turns to find Ginny giving him a look. (He’s finally relented re: the first name situation. There really are too many of them and it was getting confusing.) She raises her eyebrows and jerks her head in a completely unsubtle way at her ex-boyfriend. Draco suppresses a wince. As much as he’s found an unexpected friend in her, he doesn’t like being reminded that they essentially have the same taste in men. He even saw her make a move on Blaise before, back when she was still figuring herself out.
Unfortunately, stopping in the middle of the street drew attention to them. Harry didn’t even really understand how it had happened; one minute he was standing there, only a few metres away from the ice-cream parlour and the next, a crowd had formed and his hand was being wrenched out of Draco’s so someone could shake it. The downside to keeping mostly to the Muggle parts of the city was that when he came back, people got crazy, like he was some kind of rare phenomenon that everyone needed to see and talk to and poke at before it disappeared again.
“There’ve been wizards in space since the sixties, we’re definitely not the first,” Draco says in answer to his question. “Pretty sure Carter’s son was
“Since I see her at work,” says Pansy, not really paying attention. “Gods this is taking forever, I’m remembering why we don’t come here on the weekends anymore.”
. Nausea creeps up his throat and he ignores it, forces it back down. “Seriously.” He pats gently at Potter’s cheek. “Oi, you lazy sod.”
Back in the snow, he takes a second to appreciate what an idiotic move that had been. If killing Dolohov
The Muggle crackers are suitably underwhelming. They don’t even bang very loud, no smoke or sparks whatsoever, and all that’s inside are some bits of paper and plastic. “You call this a hat?” Draco asks, holding up the flimsy excuse for what he can only assume is supposed to be some kind of crown.
It doesn’t escape Draco’s notice that Potter starts behaving even more oddly around him after the night of the party. In fact, it starts to get a little unnerving after the sixth time Potter promptly leaves a room just as Draco enters it.
“Buy something decent for God’s sake,” he said on his way past, knocking his shoulder gently into Harry’s. Harry felt the bump, warm all down his arm, all the way to the supermarket.
Malfoy moans next door, as if in confirmation, and Harry resists punching his pillow. It isn’t even late, barely past 4pm. Far be it from Harry to condemn a man for having a nice, late afternoon wank, but
“Sorry,” Potter gets out. “I can’t— it wasn’t—” He dissolves into helpless giggles again and gestures at something small and sharp sitting in a metal tray on the table between their beds. “Time turner,” he says, eventually. “Exploded and a piece embedded itself in your neck.”
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Of course he’s doing it on purpose. He’s been doing it on purpose all summer.”
that sends pieces of brick and plaster rebounding all over the place. For a brief second Draco wonders if he’s not the only one stuck in a loop, some of Dolohov’s moves are starting to seem a little too premeditated, but then:
on his pale skin — but it’s like he doesn’t realise, or doesn’t care. Whenever Harry feels his own face grow hot it makes him want to hide, embarrassed at being embarrassed, and it annoys him that Malfoy can walk around, haughty as ever, even when his whole face has gone pink. Just once, Harry’d like to see him less than composed. He’s certainly heard it enough times.
Potter’s quiet as he raises the mug to his mouth. It unnerves Draco; usually he can’t get Potter to shut up. He sips his own drink just for something to do with his hands and immediately pulls a face.
“You ask a lot of questions,” Potter says, but he doesn’t sound bothered by it. And rightly so, honestly, seeing as he’s the one who keeps dragging Draco out of bed. There’s an odd sort of interest in his face, like he can’t figure Draco out. “But yeah, a bit.”
It’s only because he gets used to Potter being around and providing a steady stream of mundane background conversation that Draco notices something is wrong with him on Sunday afternoon. He’s actually inside Draco’s room properly for once, but he’s restless, pacing up and down, prodding at things on Draco’s shelves. Draco had been trying to do some Arithmancy because it’s been months and he’s out of practice, work spread out on the floor at the foot of his bed, but Potter’s disquiet is infectious.
“Well,” Malfoy says after a moment of quiet. “I suppose we may as well just knock the damn wall through. I see no point in it anymore.”
It throws Draco, standing there, faced with the idea of a tiny baby Potter, one who’d probably learned to crawl along this floor and pull himself up on the bannister. From the outside, the place where the killing curse backfired is obvious, half of the roof caved in, but from in here it looks like a normal house. A little shabbier, a lot less grand than what Draco grew up in, but a home all the same. They probably had to keep a protective enchantment across the bottom stair to stop baby Potter trying to climb them.
“I don’t know.” Draco shivers in his thin shirt and wraps his arms around himself. He’d have thought the cold would have woken him up some but it’s just making him want to get back into bed. “Look, did you want something, Potter?”
Sometimes he manages to hit Dolohov with something, but the psychopath always gets that curse out before his body slams into the floor, the point of his wand always finding Potter before he crumples, or staggers back, or, the one time Draco just up and kicks him in the balls, magic be damned, drops to his knees, howling.
something when he’d qualified, promising he wouldn’t breach the Statute) and Harry wouldn’t do anything to risk his job. He can’t see himself doing anything else and schooling pre-Hogwarts still isn’t a thing for most wizarding families, so this is where he’ll be, for as long as they’ll let him.
Harry nods, ignoring the parts of his body that fight against it, which is all of them. The temperature’s dropped whilst they’ve been walking and he watches Draco wrap his arms around himself, bouncing on his feet a little, wishes things were less of a mess and that he could just pull him into a hug until he’s warm again.
Draco’s whole body goes limp with relief. He feels like he slept for a week, like he could sleep for a week more.
They have to stop talking about it then because a nurse comes in. Weasley hurriedly tucks the time-turner out of sight.
Ginny only pulls a face at him, slapping a hand on the wall that separates his and Malfoy’s rooms. She looks him dead in the eye and lets out an exaggerated moaning noise. Harry almost blushes.
It doesn’t matter, either way. He still ends up with a lapful of half-dead Potter every time, but living the same thing over and over gives a person time to think about these things.
Potter starts shaking, his teeth knocking together and Draco attempts a warming charm, knowing even before he casts that it won’t work.
“They’d get bent,” Harry says on a breath, whole body tight with the conflicting desires to keep perfectly still or to relax further back into the movement of Malfoy’s fingers. He swallows. “Out of shape. You know. Or my teammates would notice.”
Harry’s assumptions were off the mark, apparently. Malfoy doesn’t go silent as he empties himself down Harry’s throat, though he does stop forming coherent words. He still makes noise, just not the kind that would carry so easily through a wall. Small, hitched sounds, and, underneath it — the thing that, weirdly, is getting to Harry the most — his laboured breaths, these huge, unabashed gulps of air as his mouth hangs open and he starts to relax against the bed, coming down from his high. Harry’s heard him moan all number of things, and it’s somehow this, the quiet, intimate sound of his breathing returning to normal, that has Harry mesmerised.
Potter’s underwear is nondescript black cotton but Draco can already see it’s damp and warm and when she leans down — going slowly to allow Potter time to push her back if she wants to — Potter smells good here too, musky and a little sweet and Draco all but buries her face there, hands still on Potter’s thighs, keeping them spread.
Potter rolls his eyes. Draco tracks the movement and then watches as his face shifts, eyes softening, mouth tightening. “It didn’t feel right with people missing.”
The living room, Harry’s starting to think, really has a lot of wonderful features. A neutral, communal space... close to the kitchen... good natural light... three floors away from Malfoy’s bedroom et cetera. Maybe he should just sleep down here from now on. He already seems to be spending half his time on the relative safety of the sofa, and it isn’t
Harry screwed his face up. “Yeah, but. I don’t know.” He sighed, never able to say what he meant because he couldn’t find the right words. “Thanks, I guess. Is what I’m getting at. For still wanting to— you know. Be around me, even with all this other shit.”
Lovegood and Weasley are in there, brewing tea or whatever the correct name is for that pile of soggy, miscellaneous herbs Lovegood calls her “own blend”. The girl Weasley, to be clear. Draco really should start referring to these people by their first names, if only to avoid confusion. He lives with them, after all, and these two in particular have turned out to be surprisingly good company. The Weaselette is mean and doesn’t really give a shit about anyone’s opinion of her, characteristics Draco can appreciate in anyone, and Lovegood is sort of impossible to dislike, even if looking at her makes it hard to forget she was locked in his cellar for the better part of a year. Still, it isn’t his cellar anymore, and she seems to be doing ok.
Malfoy makes a small noise himself, and Harry’s fists clench in his lap. He is absolutely not going to get hard. He might melt into a puddle at Malfoy’s feet, but he is
retain perfect diction even with three fingers inside of him. It’s almost laughable. It’s pretty impressive. It’s so fucking hot Harry is about to come in his pants.
Draco wakes for the second time in as many weeks to a tapping sound at his window. When he sits up, Potter’s face is right there behind the glass, small grin in place. It’s a lot to take in when Draco has quite literally just woken up. He gestures to the window, open just enough to let a tiny, icy breeze in, and wiggles his eyebrows until Draco fumbles around for his wand, shoots a spell to send it flying open properly and collapses back onto his pillows before he can think better of it, pulling the duvet back up over him as cold air follows Potter into the room.
They try levitating Potter but the spell won’t hold and between them, Weasley and Draco have to hoist him up and support him with a shoulder under each arm to get him out of the house. He doesn’t make a single noise, though Draco can feel in the tension of his body how much pain he’s in. They leave a nice trail of blood all the way down the stairs.
Potter’s eyes are still open for now, though, staring up at the roof of the car. There’s this look on his face, one Draco can’t figure out, and then his lips part and Draco’s struck with a truly idiotic idea.
Potter smiles, a small one, but Draco feels a strange sense of accomplishment anyway. “Oh, I don’t know,” he says. “I know where you sleep.”
“Whe—?” Potter starts to say but he has to stop to cough, and Draco huffs, trying to be annoyed and coming up with nothing but fear.
“Bit, ah, early isn’t it?” he asks, nodding his head at the drinks between them and desperately trying to avoid meeting Malfoy’s
Merlin. “Ok, Harry,” Draco says, the name feeling so natural in her mouth that it’s weird. “You’re doing so good, Harry, love having you around me, loved how you lay still and let me taste you earlier.”
There’s quiet for a moment, just Potter’s harsh breathing and the complaining sounds from the car as Granger pushes the accelerator down as far as it’ll go.
“Can you really think of any Professor who would have been prepared to take a horde of twelve-year-olds halfway up a mountain?” he asks when Potter stays quiet.
That time is bad. Draco accidentally tosses his wand aside (he gets a little caught up in the moment) so Dolohov slices Potter
“I have a house but I’m not living there.” He gestures at what must be a window below that Draco can’t see. “I’m down on the ground floor.”
“Can you not?” he snaps, when Potter accidentally knocks a photo of Draco and his parents to the ground.
It’s harder than he thought it would be to just stand there, because he can still hear everything that’s going on. There are a lot of shouts and bangs and flashes, so many that he’s surprised no one on the street comes out to see what’s happening. Maybe the magic of the house that hides it from Muggles masks the noise as well.
“We just put flowers on my parents’ grave,” Potter says mildly. He’s remarkably relaxed for someone standing right outside the place where said parents were violently murdered. “And now we’re about to go into their house. Even if we didn’t look like ourselves, I think anyone watching would be suspicious.”
“Yes?” Harry asks. It comes out breathless, which probably doesn’t help the situation. Or significantly
Potter doesn’t even smile. His face is quickly going slack and he still hasn’t opened his eyes. Draco wants to shake him, can feel himself getting woozy with panic. His head swims and the car jolts to the right as Granger overtakes a line of cars, speeding down the road.
at it,” Harry says, feeling Draco’s gaze on the side of his face as he stares, captivated, at the pale, craterous surface. He wants to press his nose to the glass, tattoo the image onto his brain.
He’d woken up the next day with a dry mouth and that morning-after feeling like your body knows you’ve done something stupid before your brain wakes up enough to remember what it is. They’d had the first (and, to this day, only) house meeting about it, which had mostly consisted of everyone telling him they hardly cared one way or the other as long as Malfoy contributed to the food budget and wasn’t a massive prick to anyone.
Malfoy lifts a shoulder and his robe gapes worryingly at the chest. “We were out in Canary Wharf. I passed Billingsgate on my way back.”
It was, objectively, pretty disgusting when he’d sat up and kissed Harry, even though he cast three different breath-freshening charms and only tasted like spearmint and ginger. Unhygienic, at the very least, but Harry hadn’t been able to bring himself to care.
The Potter of the here and now seems frozen, lost in thought until Weasley nudges them all gently forwards, pulls the front door closed behind them. The silence gets very loud.
“Charming,” Draco says it sarcastically and unfortunately means it whole-heartedly. “I suppose you’re right, though.”
Draco comes to standing up. It’s a weird sensation — he’s never woken up on his feet before and it disorientates him for a second. It’s the first thing he’s aware of, being upright, and then the second, immediately after: a dull pain at the back of his neck, like an oncoming headache only more localised, pinching at the base of his skull and behind his ears.
Malfoy hums but says nothing more, hands beginning a steady rhythm. Harry’s had people play with his hair before, of course, idle, unconscious movements that were nice enough, but this feels different. Maybe because of the headache, or maybe because it’s Malfoy touching him. Malfoy’s long fingers carding through his hair. Malfoy’s soft breathing behind him.
The door opens onto a small hallway, more doors off to the left and up ahead, a rusted pram still pushed against one wall and the stairs to the first floor only a couple of paces from where they stand, huddled in the entrance. No one seems to want to be the first one to go any further.
“Because he, what? Thinks fucking an endless stream of men right next door to me will make me want him?”
Harry suppresses an urge to go over there and pull it over his head in frustration. Malfoy’s always blushing — it shows up beautifully— er,
The year Draco gets promoted to a job with a title so long and complicated that it doesn’t even fit on the subject line of the email he sends, Harry goes to space. He’s in Florida for the first time since that night on the beach, just
Because there’s long distance, there’s here, London, Harry’s job and his flat and his friends and there’s the US, on the other side of the world and then there’s
Potter laughs, gets a hand under Draco’s thigh to pull it up around her waist and bites her neck, a little too hard. “Did you miss the huge badge pinned to my tits? I’ll admit they’re quite distracting but I wouldn’t have thought they’d prevent you from reading..”
Draco, who’d turned away grumpily to stare at the opposite wall, turns back just as grumpily, interested despite himself.
Potter shifts, swinging his legs off the side of the bed so he’s sitting facing away from Draco. Draco has a horrible urge to reach out and touch his back.
The turkey ends up tasting a bit off, whether because it was from a discount supermarket or because Weasley has to shrink it and then regrow it again in order to get it cooked properly, Draco doesn’t know, but it’s not bad after his third mug of wine, and even he can admit Weasley makes a damn good roast potato. Granger puts away about nine of them, and half a mushroom wellington.
Even thinking about it makes him sway slightly for a moment, the distance between he and Potter shortening dangerously. Potter clears his throat and Draco blinks slowly.
The flask is empty and Draco’s sitting cross-legged on top of his desk, right shoulder pressed heavily into the window frame.
He spends the morning moving all the furniture in his room, something he used to do periodically back at the Manor, shifting and rearranging whenever he’d felt like it. Back then he’d used magic. Now he drags the desk over by hand so it’s under the window, shoves his bed further along the wall so that he can see the tiny triangle of lake in the distance even when he’s lying on it. The noise of the furniture scraping on the floor and the pull in his shoulders feels necessary. He has to stop for a second halfway through, breathing heavily, and he almost, ridiculously, wants to just leave the bed right where it is, blocking the entire doorway.
When Hermione finds them she doesn’t even seem surprised. There’s no telling off, just a sigh and Harry pulled away by the wrist. It makes him feel like a teenager anyway, caught out of bed after hours and sneaking into the wrong dorm, the thrill of knowing something’s a bad idea and doing it anyway hot in his chest.
If he really does like Harry, though, why all this messing around? Are they so far past a simple “fancy a drink, Potter?”?
“I do,” Draco says, instead of the several other witty retorts that have already lined themselves up in her head. She senses that this might be the time for a little bit of vulnerability, much as she is disinclined to even think that word, let alone make an attempt to emulate it.
Harry laughs, all deep and tired and says “Sorry,” not sounding very sorry at all and then, “You really have to start calling me Harry. That wasn’t just a— sex thing.” She shifts over, sitting up slightly to unhook her bra with a noise of relief and then hanging off the side of the bed to reach for her wand, pointing it at the lamp to turn it off. Then she flops back down onto one side of the bed.
He notices the tension, even though Draco relaxes almost instantly, and he laughs at Draco’s frown, kisses his face again. Draco’s quill falls out of his hand, Potter sitting right on top of the parchment he’d just been writing on.
Potter goes in first like he usually does, tests the door with his wand before they all file in behind him. Draco’s barely over the threshold before he pushes past and heads for the stairs, ignoring the furious whispers of the others. He already knows where Dolohov is and he’s made up his mind to try this. After a tiny pause, there are footsteps behind him. The other three are following him, because they’re Gryffindors, and because they’re nauseatingly good people who won’t let him go up there alone, even if they might not entirely believe what he’s told them is waiting.
Draco scowls and says nothing, determinedly ignoring the way the tension in the room has lessened already.
Draco’s nod surprises him and he almost regrets it when Potter returns it and lowers himself down out of sight. Draco lets his head fall back and stares at the ceiling.
That’s true. It would feel weird anyway, letting anyone else have Sirius’ old room. Maybe he can convince
Potter’s pulled his bottom lip into his mouth. Draco’s eyes have somehow picked that out in the darkness and zeroed in on it. “I guess I’ll--” he says with a vague gesture.
Malfoy’s eyes narrow thoughtfully and then he sits up and pats the edge of the cushion in front of him, lifts his feet up onto the sofa and tucks them out of the way. Harry stares at him.
Draco knows it’s going to happen a second before it does. The hand twitches, harder, purposeful, and the jet of ugly, familiar orange light singes Draco’s side as it skims him and hits Potter, who makes an awful, gurgled noise and drops, his hands clutching at Draco’s jumper on the way down.
Whenever Draco comes home to visit (and Harry shouldn’t call it that; London’s not Draco’s home anymore, not really), he stays with Harry. They never actually have a conversation about it, but Draco had only been renting whilst he studied, so he doesn’t have a place of his own to come back to. It would be pointless, when he’s only in the country a couple of times a year. All the friends Draco has here live in or around the city, there’s a veritable list of people who would happily put him up, but the first visit after he moves Harry meets him at the International Portkey Office and takes him back to his without thinking about it.
“Hello,” Draco all but yells back. It’s so loud here, in the thick of it. She can see Pansy giving her very unhelpful thumbs-ups over Potter’s shoulder but it’s enough to get her over the initial shock of having Potter suddenly all up in her face. She moves closer on the pretext of casually starting to move to the music again and then they’re sort of— in each other’s space, moving together.
He could make a joke. Something about the magical healing quality of his mouth, or his clearly spectacular kissing ability, but he doesn’t. He blinks at Potter, pulse rocketing the longer they sit there, eyes locked, not saying anything. Potter lets his bottom lip slip free of his teeth and Draco feels his own lips part in response, unavoidable.
She asks it completely casually, like it’s perfectly normal for Draco to be in Harry’s bed at all, let alone planning on sleeping there for an entire night. Draco could freak out about this if she let herself. Or she could follow Harry’s lead and pretend like it’s not a big deal. Only one option gets her a warm, full bed for the night, so it’s not difficult. She nods.
Harry doesn’t actually expect anything to come of it, but the next day Draco’s boss (Carter something? That’s what everyone calls him and Harry still hasn’t figured out if it’s his first or last name. Either way, he has the whitest teeth Harry’s ever seen) slaps him on the back and tells him he’s excited to have Harry on board and that’s that. Instead of leaving at the end of the week with Teddy and Andromeda, Harry stays.
Right. Because Malfoy has a surprising number of friends (yeah, Harry’s going to call them that even if the sounds some of them make when Malfoy brings them home are decidedly more than friendly) that he’s always hurrying out of the door to go and see.
enough about him, especially when he decided to go into uni with stomach flu and took out half the class just before their final assignments were due.
“Better than me,” Thomas sighs, throwing his cards down in defeat. He’s doing even worse than Draco, although the fact that Finnegan keeps eating his pistachios definitely isn’t helping.
It could just be a deja-vu thing. Draco’s pretty sure there’s seer blood way back in his ancestry somewhere. Maybe he dreamed everything, or had a vision right there on the pavement, a premonition of what was going to happen, and now he’s about to see if it was right. He never expected real Divination to feel like this, but then he’s never had a vision before, maybe this is how it works. He would ask Granger, but this is the one subject she refuses to take seriously, and Potter’s already halfway up the path, there isn’t time.
, groans at that and speeds up her hand again, fucking into Draco and pulling her back so that she can grind her hips into Draco’s arse, seeking pressure.
“Get these out the way,” Potter says, and Draco is pleased to note she sounds breathless too, like she’s as gone for this as Draco is. She pats at Draco’s hip with the hand that Draco hasn’t just had in her mouth, and Draco obediently pulls her knickers off and kicks them off the end of the bed. Potter wastes no time in getting straight down to it then, pushing one finger into Draco as Draco tries not to writhe around unattractively and fails. Although, she might actually manage to do it attractively, if the way Potter has started making these appreciative noises is anything to go by.
“Alright?” Potter says, looking mildly concerned. He’s standing next to Draco in the street. In the snow. With Weasley and Granger, and the half-ruined remnant of his first home in front of them.
He tries to think what the him of three years ago might have said about Potter being allowed his pick of rooms. Draco had taken what they’d assigned to him and been thankful he wasn’t being locked up in a tower somewhere.
Right, definitely Malfoy then. Ever since Malfoy moved in Harry’s fridge has somehow been elevated from out-of-date condiments to near Michelin star levels. There’d been a system at one point, before Malfoy, back when they all moved in (fresh from Hogwarts, no idea what to do with themselves, no money to speak of, or no desire to start flat-hunting, depending on who you asked), with separate shelves and designated drawers and everything, but it had barely lasted a couple of weeks. Harry’s seriously considering implementing it again, if only to reduce the amount of time he has to spend moving things like jars of caviar out of the way to get to the orange juice.
He yawns, covering his mouth with the back of his hand. “No, it was fun. I just felt like coming home.”
“Oh.” Draco almost asks Potter why he’s being-- is friendly the word? “Um. No, actually. I think I’m alright.”
“Fuck, I knew it would be like this,” Malfoy says, body shifting on the bed as he drives his hips down to meet Harry’s fingers. “I just
“Sorry,” he says, and Draco sees him wince because he might actually be incapable of whispering and it comes out quite loud. “Sorry.”
kind of realisation, I’d rather know sooner than later. Pansy’ll need time to get the sofa-bed ready.”
“It wasn’t like this before,” he’s saying, indicating the trellis below him with a jerk of his chin. “Neville put it up over the summer when they were working on the grounds and it had all sorts on it -- roses mostly, I think. Everything died when it got colder.”
“Suppose we’ll just have to make use of the time we’ve got then,” says Draco, and cups a hand over Potter’s cold nose. It’s an odd thing to do, and Draco’s hands aren’t much warmer than the skin underneath them but it makes Potter’s eyes crinkle.
“It’s weird we never did this before,” Potter says, voice snatched away by the wind. “All those years living with this on our doorstep.”
“Oi,” Potter says, turning Draco’s face back to hers so she can kiss her again. “’S not my fault. You were giving me bedroom eyes all night.”
Potter corners him in the freezer aisle when the other two are off looking at wine. Draco can hear them, arguing over Shiraz, but the sound tunes out as Potter backs him up against one of the glass doors. It’s ice-cold against his back and Potter is very, very warm when he lines them up, knees to chest, his arms either side of Draco’s head.
They only have a week, so they don’t waste any time. Draco drags him out on walks, relishing the sharp sweetness of autumn after so long in the season-less, weathervoid darkness of space and it’s half term, so they take Teddy to the Science Museum, go flying in Richmond Park, spend an afternoon cutting out strings of bats and paper cobwebs for Harry to decorate his classroom with when school resumes.
He’s still short with Potter a lot of the time, because it’s basically part of his personality after this many years, but mostly Potter laughs it off. Today he seems to barely hear Draco.
“Here,” he says, sliding a mug over to Harry and waving his wand so that the teapot starts to pour. “You look like you need it.”
It’s the same, everything, their walk upstairs, the bedroom, the door opening and the footsteps. Draco’s too busy hoping he’s wrong, that it won’t be
Potter climbs through his window two nights later, some kind of metal flask tucked under his arm and two mugs in the opposite hand. It seems impossible he’s made it up the side of the castle carrying all that.
“I don’t see what your problem is,” Neville says, pulling open a packet of stilton and port crisps. He and Malfoy are the only ones who ever eat the weird posh flavours that Malfoy buys. Harry had assumed it was a Pureblood thing, but Ginny won’t touch them and he’d ruled Ron an automatic outlier on account of the fact that if it was edible, Ron would put it in his mouth. “You let him move in. You could have said no. And he’s been a surprisingly ok housemate.” He shakes the bag at Harry as if in demonstration.
Nothing he’s tried so far has stopped Potter getting hurt. Not sitting it out all together, not pulling him aside, not even burying Dolohov in rubble. He’s sure that doing one thing differently is the key to breaking the loop, like if he does something unexpected enough, it’ll throw the sequence out, but he’s running out of ideas. Except—
, let alone far enough out of the city to get clear skies, and they shut the fucking campus observatory at 9pm like they’re actively
parties,” Potter grumbles at him on the morning of the 30th. He’s heading back down south to see his friends tomorrow and Draco’s privately relieved. If he wasn’t, he might have come and bothered Draco, and there’s something about spending the end of the year together that feels intimate. Draco used to love New Years, more than Christmas even, some years. Various combinations of his friends had always come over to the Manor whilst all of their parents were off socialising. When they were fifteen Pansy had made herself sick drinking most of a bottle of champagne and vomited on the rug in the third sitting room. Draco’s own small glass had made him dizzy enough and she and Blaise had kissed him, giggling, on either cheek when it turned midnight.
“You could just come up here, you know,” Draco sniffs as he fingers the glass of the window pane, searching for any cracks.
Draco says nothing. He hasn’t finished the book yet, though it’s not hard to guess where it’s going.
It gives Harry pause for a second. “What?” he asks, genuinely a bit confused. “You’re the one who ended it!”
Harry kisses up her neck, her other hand pinching one nipple between her fingers so that Draco gasps and jerks back into her. “Fuck yes,” she breathes. “Your posh pureblood accent talking about tasting me— Jesus, Draco.”
Harry groans. It’s no good, he’s going to come in his pants in about three minutes if Malfoy doesn’t move, and two if he
“Hi,” Potter says, nonsensical. Their faces are very close together and there’s blood in Potter’s eyelashes, red framing the green of his eyes. How appropriately fucking festive.
“You need to go faster,” Draco cuts her off. Potter’s eyes are half-lidded already, and it’s scaring him. “Seriously, Granger. He’s going to pass out and then
The man was sweet, was the problem, innocent and unassuming, old enough to be Harry’s grandfather, and all he wanted to do was thank Harry, talk to him for a moment. The war had felt like a lifetime ago, even then, a million miles away from that sun-drenched street where Draco’s hand was in his and all he had to think about was what flavour of ice-cram he was going to get, but Harry had smiled as best he could and let the stranger pat him shakily on the shoulder. He’s never thought he deserved any kind of praise for what he did as a teenager, not now and not then, but he wasn’t going to be an arse about it. He wasn’t going to tell a nice old man to leave him alone.
Dolohov doesn’t look any different from the last time they saw him, not physically, but there’s a wildness behind his eyes that Draco recognises. It’s what people look like when they’ve had a good portion of their higher brain function
“Jesus,” says Potter, her voice going all deep and catching slightly in this way that Draco wants to hear on repeat, possibly forever. Her fingers feel good in Draco’s mouth, strong, and Draco thinks about having them inside her and shudders, suddenly impatient, pulling them out with a slick noise and shoving them back in the direction of her hips.
Draco’s brain, a bit fuzzy with alcohol, takes longer to process this than she would have liked, stumbling over all the pronouns, and when it finally does make sense she can’t think of a damn thing to say. Which might actually be a first, but there’s no time to think about that now because a willing Potter plus the idea of an empty stall sounds like an incredibly appealing combination right now. She’s hardly had to do any work at all and Potter’s all but offering herself up, simple as.
Potter laughs, loud and incredulous and then stands back, hands shoved in his pockets. He seems to be assessing the wall underneath the window and Draco has about two seconds to process that before he strides forwards and gets a hand on the trellis that’s built onto the castle wall. It's new; Draco was surprised to see it that first night, but he likes the look of it against the brick, the weaving ivy and the small white flowers. It’s pretty and delicate and unlikely to hold Potter’s weight. Draco can’t watch; he’d meant the
Malfoy smiles, unabashed. “Yes, I suppose so.” He pulls the door closed behind him and leans back against it. He does a lot of bloody leaning. It feels like every surface Harry looks at in this house there’s a Malfoy leaning up against it. Or, just the one Malfoy, obviously. There’s zero chance of catching Lucius all draped up against a spare door frame, and Harry thanks Merlin for it.
Malfoy turns his grin on the floor, flicks a glance up at Harry from under his hair. It’s not a very big landing. Not much of a space for hanging about really, and yet here they are.
,” Ginny instructs, sending a martini glass full of something orange and glittery over to him with such a wonky levitating charm that Harry thinks it best to resign himself to the role of guinea-pig with good grace and go and join them, if only to stop the floor from getting too sticky.
His lungs are starting to burn. He has no breath to make a noise but a small, desperate sound escapes anyway as Malfoy squeezes tighter around his cock, free hand pushing Harry’s hair out of his face.
“God, your accent,” she says, and Draco has to laugh at that, even as she feels heat building up from the base of her spine, Harry’s fingers strong and thick inside her, her hand applying perfect pressure to Draco’s clit.
The thing is, Potter already knows she saw the match because she’d seen her there, Draco dragged along by Pansy to get pitch-side comments after the game was over. Potter had just touched down, sweaty and grinning from their win, which had been very close, snatched at the last minute by a pretty spectacular catch from Potter that had put her team ahead by a mere 20 points. She’d rocked up, pushing tendrils of hair out of her face, giving her statements to the press all whilst shooting Draco these little looks like she knew how good she looked and how seriously Draco was considering the merits of trying to break into the changing rooms later. Draco wasn’t even supposed the be there; it was for journalists only.
The next morning, Harry pulls himself out of bed and into the shower, already reasoning with himself. He had a lot to drink last night and Malfoy had been louder than he’d ever heard him. Practically shameless. Harry can’t be blamed for getting turned on by such things. It’s a natural reaction.
Right. Sometimes Draco forgets just how fast her brain works. “That doesn’t explain how we’re both alive.” He gestures at himself and Potter.
“Right.” Draco looks back at Weasley, who only smiles, showing all of her teeth. “And what are we proposing he hasn’t realised? Only if it’s a
Draco stares at the sky. It’s clouded over, stars hidden so that the only light comes from the half-moon. “Ok. Why are you telling me this?”
“It’ll be good to see everyone, though.” Potter’s not really speaking loud enough for Draco to hear him all the way up here, but the day is so still and quiet that his voice carries. Often Draco doesn’t actually need to say anything; Potter can have entire conversations with himself, and Draco suspects he probably does, even when Draco’s not there. Potter does everything out loud.
Malfoy yells. It is, as loud noises go, pretty brilliant. Harry’s always liked this, the feel of a cock on his tongue, the intimacy of his mouth on someone’s body, and Malfoy is the most responsive partner he’s ever had. He won’t — or can’t — shut up, groaning as Harry sucks hard and lifts off slowly, dragging his tongue up the underside.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Seriously.” He knocks their elbows together. “Friends? We could do friends.” He can do friends, he
It feels inevitable when, after he’s finished three glasses of water and brushed his teeth, Harry kisses Draco, thinking of Felix Walton and stomach flu and parallels, reflecting back over the years. Draco kisses him back with an abandonment bordering on total surrender, and pulls them into his bedroom.
anything, the emails. They promised they’d stay friends and Harry thinks this is probably them trying to do that, but maintaining a friendship across the Atlantic ocean and a sizeable time zone difference is just as hard as trying to keep a relationship going was.
When Draco knocks on the bathroom door that evening, the reply comes, distorted and echoey through the wood. “I’m in the bath.”
of work goes into missions, even short trips like this one, and it’s not like Harry can do anything to help — so Harry has some time to lie around in Draco’s spare bedroom and think. It’s the summer holidays, it’s not like he has to be back for work, but he finds himself feeling guilty regardless. Not in a bad way, per se, just. There’s something indulgent about it all. The insane privilege of getting to go into fucking
. Even these tiny shiftings of his hips are about to do Harry in. There’s no way he’s missed the press of Harry’s cock through those leggings.
Blaise laughs, gripping Draco’s waist and rolling up into him. “I’m not stupid, Draco. And I’m also not offended. Just admit it so that we can get on with giving him a show.”
“I doubt we’ll see much of each other, then.” Draco’s dropped Care of Magical Creatures, the only other lesson he shared with Potter.
“If you would just put an anti-shatter spell on your glasses, you wouldn’t have to charm your eyes,” Malfoy says casually, as his fingertips start probing Harry’s scalp, catching gently on the damp knots of Harry’s hair.
He balls the jumper up and presses it to Potter’s side, remembers belatedly that keeping pressure on a wound is what you’re supposed to do and ignores the way Potter cries out like he can’t help it, flinching away. The jumper, like everything else that touches Potter, gets soaked through within minutes.
Harry grins, tilts his head. “Can I—?” he asks, trailing his hand downwards instead and stopping with his fingertips millimetres from the pucker of Malfoy’s skin.
The Polyjuice lasts twenty minutes. Draco had suspected as much — they’d used up most of their supply on the Ministry in September, leaving barely a mouthful each — but it’s still a little unnerving to feel all the parts of his body melt back into their usual appearance forty minutes earlier than expected.
want to come. Like, right now.” Draco looks at him properly, half-naked and reclined against the pillows, a very pointed look on his face, like he really isn’t used to getting this far in the undressing process before being jumped. To be fair to him, they
Weasley makes a low whistling noise of appreciation, but Draco doesn’t have time to enjoy it, Potter’s bleeding.
and pushes the door open. He politely averts his eyes from where Potter sits looking all wet and annoyed — Draco was right, it’s a frustratingly good look on him — and goes over to the mirror.
It was an easy enough arrangement. Harry wasn’t actually using the terrace, and Draco wasn’t any bother, even if Harry sometimes had to stumble about his flat in the dark because Draco had turned all the lights off to stop them interfering with his readings.
Draco leans back on his arms, the vee of his only half-buttoned pajama shirt slipping enough to show a bit of collar bone. Potter’s eyes flick to it immediately. They haven’t-- everything is still very new and Draco’s scared but he thinks, soon, maybe. “Hi.”
, let alone operate a vehicle, and I seem to remember Weasley crashing a Ford Anglia into the Whomping Willow back in second year, so I really think you’re our best bet.”
Clearly he hasn’t spotted Draco, which is fair enough seeing as Draco’s sitting there in the dark. His eyes are on the ground, scanning for rocks to assault the window with, probably. It makes Draco want to laugh, the sight of him bent over, hands in his pockets, slightly unbalanced. He hadn’t felt like laughing in months before he came back to school.
And it hurts, is the thing. It’s not what Harry wants, to be having this conversation, but he has to do something, because he wants even less to keep on like this, to go back home and live on the scraps of communication that are all Draco can give him.
Draco watches him pick the frame up. He snorts as he looks at it, putting it back where it was. It’s a mean noise, and it plucks at some angry instinct in Draco.
“Right,” he says, the other three turning to look at him. He takes a moment to focus on Potter, alive and intact once more, before he’s up the path and pulling the door open, yelling.
“And still not nearly enough,” Draco says, unabashed, and Harry doesn’t tease him for it, even when he presses a tiny kiss to Harry’s cheek, even when he links their hands together, pulls Harry’s into his lap and thumbs at his palm.
be responsible for thousands of galleons worth of delay compensation if I make them wait any longer.”
His table is fairly full considering he was barely expecting anybody from his house to return. They’ll be getting some first years too, he assumes, unless the lot of them are so terrified of ending up Slytherin that the hat sends them elsewhere. He doesn’t spot many faces from his own year as he walks, of course, but that’s unsurprising, until his feet have automatically carried him to where he always used to sit and--
before they can drop off. And you apparently have such a high opinion of yourself that if you can’t sleep, no one can, so you’ve decided to drag me into it. I can stun you, if that might help?”
“Ok.” He stays where he is, outside, leaning on the window frame, maybe sensing that Draco’s not in the mood. “Why?”
“Ok,” Potter says quickly, quietly. “Ok, we have two options,” but he doesn’t get the chance to tell them what the options are, because there’s the unmistakable sound of a door opening down the hall.
“So.” He pulls himself up onto the kitchen counter, swings his legs until his heels thunk satisfyingly into the wood, attempts to keep his tone appropriately casual. “What’s the deal with Potter?”
Potter’s not really helping his concentration either, propped sideways in the window, one leg either side so that he’s half-in, half-out, chatting inanely about things like: “It’s weird that everyone’s going to be spread all over the castle, isn’t it?”
” Malfoy says, looking up from under half-lowered lids when Harry finds them in the kitchen with what appears to be several hundred bottles of alcohol set out on the table.
There are lobsters in Harry’s fridge. Harry’s unsure if he’s ever actually seen a lobster in real life before and now there are four on his middle shelf, wrapped in plastic and shoved in next to the leftovers from last night.
Draco snorts, gripping the bottom of Potter’s shirt so she can pull it up over her head and duck down to kiss the newly-exposed flesh. She lets her hands skim down Potter’s sides, digging her fingers in when Potter gasps and tries to wriggle away. “Ticklish,” she breathes, so Draco does it again, until Potter grabs her by the wrists and holds them behind her back, catching Draco’s lower lip between her teeth, releasing it with a soft pull back to meet Draco’s eyes.
Malfoy shakes his head slightly. “Sorry, I thought—” His frown deepens. “Never mind. I was looking for my jacket. You didn’t borrow it did you? The black one.”
Harry goes out to the roof, unable to face his empty bed just yet. The clouds are thick and dark, obscuring the stars. He watches the blinking light of a plane track its way across the sky and imagines Draco’s on it, imagines he has a tangible way of watching Draco get further and further away, instead of this raw, expectant edge in his chest.
“Malfoy,” Potter says when Draco is within speaking distance. Her gaze flicks up and down the length of Draco’s body. She’s not sure if Potter meant her to see but it makes her feel hot all over whether it was intentional or not.
if we stop trying. You want some space? You said it yourself, we barely see each other as it is. Any more space and there’ll be nothing
He heads off to the left, sticking close to the castle walls. It takes him longer than he would have thought to loop them but it feels good to be outside. The sun’s bright in that unexpected, cold way it sometimes is at the end of the year, and the wind chills him enough to keep his head clear.
“Can’t help it.” Draco shifts back on the seat until he can dislodge Potter’s hands and pull the jumper over his head. He’s wearing another one underneath, layered up against the freezing cold, but Potter tries for a wolf-whistle anyway, his lips pursing around the non-sound that his mouth is too dry to actually make. Draco would swat at him for that, if he wasn’t bleeding out.
“It’s mulled wine,” he says before Draco can ask, crawling onto the newly-positioned desk and then wobbling off it.
“Oh, you definitely are,” Draco says airily, thanking her pureblood upbringing for instilling in her the skill of coming across as cooly composed when your insides are doing something completely undignified. “Just because you’re a damn good Quidditch player and apparently learned to brush your hair and dress yourself..” She lets her gaze drag up the length of Potter’s body deliberately slowly. “Well, barely, but I’m sure you’ll get there.”
Potter looks at him deadpan for a second before pulling his glasses off his face to clean them on the bottom of his t-shirt. “I didn’t like it the first time.” He slumps down until his back is pressed against the wall under the window. Draco has to put his legs down flat so he can still see him. “I thought they were so annoying. Dramatic.”
“Potter,” Draco interrupts. She’s a little overwhelmed, every side of Harry is overwhelming, but this rambly, soft, post-sex Harry might be Draco’s favourite so far. “If I’m staying you better make room. And shut up so we can actually sleep.”
going to make this weird. After all, Malfoy still doesn’t know Harry listens to him getting off, definitely doesn’t know that by this point Harry has gotten off
Someone’s pinned a frankly ridiculous badge to the front of Potter’s top, which is long sleeved and far too casual for this place, tucked messily into denim shorts. Draco’s gaze gets lost somewhere around Potter’s thighs because Merlin
“Good, you’re awake.” Granger falls into a chair opposite their beds. “I assume Harry’s told you? The shard must have stuck in you when my bag got hit.” She holds up the beaded bag.
Today had one of those days, all of them eager to take advantage of the good weather, so his head’s still pounding when he comes downstairs after a hot shower to get some food and finds Malfoy lounging alone on the sofa, book abandoned on the floor next to him. He has a headphone in one ear and Harry can hear the music, tinny but bass-filled, from the other side of the room.
his teeth sharp on Harry’s lips one second and his tongue soft and slick and probing the roof of Harry’s mouth the next.
, this is bad, and wrong, probably, and a serious invasion of— something, and maybe Malfoy goes quiet when he comes because his whole body tenses and his mouth opens on a silent gasp or he bites his lip, hard and his eyes screw up and shit, ok, that’s it. Harry rolls over and bites down onto his pillow, breathing heavily into the fabric as he empties himself into his hand. It makes a mess of his sheets but, unlike some people, he prefers not to risk being overheard.
Draco hums again. He’s tired, in that slow, comforting way. It’s late; he doesn’t know long they’ve been up talking. He should probably go to bed soon, or he’ll fall asleep and tip right over the edge of the sill.
Granger stands there, fretting. “Couldn’t we try Side—? she starts to say, but Draco’s losing patience.
“Er, morning,” Harry says, more to the room at large than to the man pouring milk into Ron’s favourite mug. He heard them come in last night, of course — the thump of Malfoy’s bedroom door and the low hum of voices. And then the rest.
very often these days, and it stings, gets Harry’s back up. “Well I don’t know what you want! All I know’s I can’t keep doing this, not without literally going out of my mind.”
,” she says, mimicking Malfoy’s accent. It’s seriously starting to freak Harry out how well Malfoy and Ginny are getting along.
It goes suddenly quiet and Harry swears under his breath. It’s always difficult to know when Malfoy is going to come because he makes so much noise the whole way through that Harry can’t tell when he’s getting close. Not that he’s trying to come at the same time as him, or anything, it’s just a nice thought. Or creepy as fuck, he supposes. Oh
Draco hadn’t even thought of that. It gets dark so early in winter it feels like his life is made up of long nights with snatches of pale sunlight in between. Nice little metaphor, that.
manages to get Draco with a nasty battering hex that dislocates his shoulder, even as he’s lying on the floor with one hand cupped protectively between his legs.
Malfoy looks up at him and then down at his outfit. His cheeks darken, though his expression remains unconcerned. “Is it?”
It has exactly the effect she intends it to. Potter raises her eyebrows and flips them with strong hands around Draco’s middle in about two seconds, manoeuvring them up the bed slightly so Potter’s leaning against the headboard with Draco sitting between her legs, back pressed to Potter’s front and Potter’s chin hooked over her shoulder. Draco wouldn’t admit it for the all the galleons in Gringotts but having Potter manhandle her is an unexpected rush, the way she could probably easily throw Draco over her shoulder and carry her off somewhere if she wanted.
Oh, I’ll bloody well give you mouthy, Draco thinks, but doesn’t actually say because she’s busy rolling them over and straddling Potter’s hips, pinning her hands above her head on the bed. Potter looks a bit blindsided for a split second before her expression goes all challenging and when has Draco ever, in the history of their entire— well, history, been able to resist a challenge from Potter?
“I don’t really drink much at all, usually,” Potter says on a sigh. He’s barely halfway through his own glass and he looks flushed. Draco doesn’t drink very often either, but he’s not much in the mood for a heart to heart over their failure to behave like normal teenagers.
“We all saw that head massage he gave you. Well, Ron did and told us all about it but, same difference. Honestly, Harry.”
“Don’t get used to it,” Potter says, around another yawn. She’s already stretching out, wriggling around to try and get under the covers with Draco still on top of her. “You staying?”
For all his expletives and demands when Harry had his hands on him, he’s being almost unbearably gentle now. Not silent — he’s still making small, encouraging noises as Harry lies there and doesn’t breathe beneath him — but quieter. His touch is softer, more tender.
Draco hits him over the back of the head. He has to stretch up to do it — he’s tall but Weasley is tall on an unnatural level, something Draco likes reminding him of — but it’s worth it. He hopes he’s not blushing. They haven’t actually talked about anything really, him and Potter, and definitely not him and Potter and Weasley and Granger. It’s a conversation Draco feels can wait until they’re not standing in a car park, at the very least.
“Finally,” he says, pushing back the covers on his bed. Draco averts his eyes, trying not to focus on the bandages that break up the smooth lines of his torso. “Let’s go. This food is terrible.”
Draco’s never been in Potter’s room before. He was right -- it’s bigger than Draco’s but surprisingly less red than he might have assumed. It’d taken a shaky three minutes for Draco to climb down the side of the castle to see if his panicked cushioning charm had actually done what it was supposed to and when his feet had reached solid ground Potter had been lying there looking up at the sky, dazed but seemingly intact.
They aren’t playing with real gold — Draco doesn’t have enough of that to throw around any more, something he’s just about managed to get used to — but he’s become quite attached to the small pile of pistachio nuts they’ve been using as bartering chips.
Harry feels his hands bunch in the fabric of Malfoy’s oversized shirt, just like he imagined, and  Malfoy whines into his mouth. Even at this, even just kissing, he’s loud. Some distant part of Harry is vaguely impressed he can make so much noise when he has a mouthful of Harry’s tongue. He pants and murmurs, presses closer and crosses his ankles behind Harry’s back so that his thighs squeeze tight around Harry’s waist.
“You look good,” she blurts out before she really thinks about what she’s saying and then, quickly, “I saw your match against the Wasps last weekend,” which isn’t any fucking better really, but if she’s going to embarrass herself she might as well go the whole hog.
“Thought you might want to come,” Potter says, casual, like that’s a completely normal thing for him to assume. Like they’ve spent any time together at all, really, in seven years.
charm both of them thought it would. There’s a tension from the moment Harry’s plane lands, too prone to motion-sickness to risk the long distance Portkey. All week, Harry keeps catching himself pulling away, like it’ll be easier to leave if he doesn’t let himself fall back in quite so far this time, and Draco, sensing what he’s doing, spooked, clings on all the tighter because of it.
Draco’s so angry — at himself, for knowing this was going to happen and not stopping it, at Dolohov, for having access to spells they’ve never even heard of, at whatever fucked up bit of magic is making him live this
Speaking of, said best friend does not seem in the mood to let Draco do what she inevitably will tonight if left to her own devices — get increasingly more pissed until Pansy has to drag her home before she really
He goes suit shopping alone. Every dressing room he stands in he’s torn between wondering what Draco would think, trying to channel his vastly superior sartorial knowledge and wishing someone would Obliviate any thoughts of blonde hair and soft, grey eyes right out of his head.
That’s why he’d offered really, to shut Malfoy up. It hadn’t seemed like a big deal at the time, not when everyone else had already moved in at one point or another and there was room. The way Malfoy frowned at the offer, surprised and a little bit hopeful, had made Harry’s stomach feel warm, which, in hindsight, should probably have been the first warning sign.
So far he’s managed to uphold both conditions: he’s generally decent (though not entirely, he is still
“So,” Potter says. Apparently they’re all playing the casual game; Draco can hear the disguised worry in Potter’s voice, even if Dolohov can’t.
aside, staying here past when he should, alone with Draco, feels inadvisably hedonistic. It’s the same feeling he’d had when Draco kissed him at Teddy’s birthday (and that was the last time, over two years ago now, they’ve been very good, and Harry only thinks about it oh, every other night), that potent, selfish joy of breaking the rules, just a little.
Surely, though, that has to be because he practically has a front row seat to all of Malfoy’s evening— activities. He’d be the same with any of the rest of them. If Ginny or Luna or Neville or Seamus and Dean, or — God forbid — Ron and Hermione were keeping him up half the night with their obnoxious sex noises, he’d be annoyed at them too. But they aren’t, and he never thinks about what they get up to. Or not much, anyway. Out of sight, out of mind and all that.
It’s a relief when he moves, Draco had been half worried he’d just stay there, staring at the hallway with that indecipherable expression. Back in the graveyard he’d cried, and Draco had felt at a complete loss, no idea how to comfort him or why the pain on his face made Draco’s chest feel hollow, but this is worse, somehow. There was an emptiness in his eyes for a second there that scared Draco.
“Pulling that piece out of your neck effectively ended the loop. If you hadn’t kissed me I would never have had my hands on you in the first place and I wouldn’t have found it.”
“Look who’s talking,” Draco shoots back, flipping Potter’s hands over so he can stroke at the thin skin with his thumbs and watch Potter’s face go slack, note-taking forgotten.
“Oh, tell me you don’t need me to do the whole ‘you’re wonderful and fit as and any girl would be lucky to have you in their bed’ routine tonight, because I really can
He tenses up, and Harry, still eager to hear his name on Malfoy’s lips one more time, prods firmly at his prostate and hollows his cheeks. Malfoy’s almost nonverbal at this point, making noises that are less words than pained, desperate sounds, but — God,
Malfoy’s eyes go all hot and stare-y. He plants his hands on Harry’s shoulders and wriggles, smile innocent, as though he’s just shifting to get comfortable. It makes something in Harry stretch so close to snapping that his fingers dig heavily into Malfoy’s waist.
Still, his absence doesn’t stop the world turning. Harry’s life goes on without him: Sundays at the Burrow and school parents’ evenings and a determined avoidance of any film with a plot that’s even tenuously related to space. Harry remodels his kitchen, buys real furniture for the roof terrace, gets Neville to recommend plants that actually have a chance of surviving under his less-than-green thumb and all the while he
Draco ducks his head, tucks a smile into the scarf he’s wearing. “Yeah, it is,” he says after a bit. “Really very stupid.”
It got so bad, the closeness of the crowd turning overwhelming so fast, that they had to leave. They bought 99s from a van in Greenwich park once they’d apparated back and Harry apologised so many times over that Draco shoved his cone into his face to shut him up, covered his nose and mouth in cold stickiness, then cleaned him off and bought him another one.
“God, do you ever shut up?” Potter asks, walking them backwards with her hands now under Draco’s arse for balance, toeing off her shoes as she goes. She throws Draco unceremoniously onto the bed — Draco absolutely does not
She looks as terrified as he feels. This is so much worse than when Weasley got splinched — bits of Potter’s
Still, he brought it on himself. It’s technically his fault that Malfoy’s ostentatious taste (osten-taste-tious?) in food is now cluttering up the fridge — Harry’s the one who offered him the room. He’d just been complaining so much, waving a glass of wine around and talking about how his parents had cut him off and how the commute from where he was staying on Pansy’s sofa to school was an absolute bitch in the mornings. He’s studying at the Muggle uni not far from Grimmauld in fact, is already a year in, an act Harry is convinced was the only thing he could have possibly done to endear him to Hermione.
And surely Draco is reading too much into the way Potter says that, the look she shoots Draco from under her eyelashes. She’s turned so she’s facing Draco properly, propped up on the bar.
He rubs over him, the shape hot and hard through the fabric, watching as the look of surprise on Malfoy’s face crumples and he moans,
Draco scoffs at that, because, yeah, if you want to call a perfectly executed dive turned back-flip a lucky catch then sure. She still remembers what Potter had looked like, spinning out of the way of the other team’s beater at the last second, ending up flat on her back on the pitch with the snitch clutched in her hand, letting out this whoop of laughter as she punched her fist in the air and her team descended on her.
lumpy. A dodgy back might be a reasonable price to pay for consecutive nights of uninterrupted sleep.
Except he can’t shake the thought that he’s stuck in this loop for a reason. The chances of it being a completely random coincidence are slim to none and he’s a
“How they expect us to learn anything,” Draco would say, when it would start raining and he and Harry would have to cart all the equipment inside to clutter up the spare bedroom instead, “when the light pollution is this bad and most students can’t afford a place with
“Hang on,” Draco says. “How did you know the bag exploded?” He nods at where the bag is very obviously still intact, clutched in her hand.
Draco spends the next day walking around the grounds, trying to put the odd reunion with Potter out of his head and focus on cataloguing what’s changed. He’d done the same back at the Manor on September 1st, feet restless, body itching to be doing something without the usual rush of a new school year to occupy it. They’d only been living in a couple of rooms all summer. He’d felt like it was time for one of them to get over themselves and assess the rest of the house, and it wasn’t likely to be his mother.
He makes an aborted shrugging movement. The bath water laps gently around his shoulders, darkened to an even deeper brown by this ridiculous heat wave they’re having. “Not really. Just wondered if I’m missing out.” His tone turns vaguely accusatory. “You seem to have fun.”
Potter seems unperturbed, still climbing up the side of the castle and dripping all over Draco’s floor.
enough to have a reason to — and Harry realises he misses it, fucked up as that is. He misses all the things that you’re supposed to have in a relationship, the bickering and date nights and seeing your boyfriend’s face more than tri-annually. And once he’s realised that, well. He starts to wonder if you can even call what they’re doing a relationship.
“Such language, Potter,” she mock-scolds, twisting her head to nose at Harry’s neck. Harry comes again then, quick and shuddering all along Draco’s back.
“People will be nice,” Potter says anyway, because he can’t not, then pulls a face. “Not nice, I mean, but. You have every right to be here.”
“Use a different bathroom,” Potter says. He sounds exasperated. His face is probably all frowny and flushed from the hot water. Draco bites his lip.
“Stop staring at Malfoy and concentrate. I’m over here getting all sweaty whilst you’re hanging in mid-air with your mouth open.”
He’s been meaning to ask the pair of them about Potter, actually, whether there’s anything to be done to make things between them less— well,
“Oh, we both know you love dramatics, Dray, don’t be stupid.” It’s an old nickname, something Draco hasn’t been called since the start of sixth year and it makes warmth flood, rusty and unexpected, into his chest. Blaise’s smirk slips into something closer to a real smile and Draco can’t help but grin back. Every cold stare he’d felt on the back of his head when he’d walked in suddenly feels a little easier to deal with.
They should probably split up. It’d be the most efficient way to find the Horcrux, if there is one here, but nobody suggests it. Draco thinks they’re all probably feeling a little spooked, and, loathe though he is to admit it, even in his own head, a little protective of Potter, too. It doesn’t seem right to force him to go through the house alone.
He makes himself pay attention during the briefing, which goes very well until it’s Draco’s turn to talk and he commands the attention of the room easily, calm and clever and authoritative. It’s almost unbearably sexy, so maybe Harry’s gets a tiny bit distracted, but he doesn’t think he’s missed anything too important when he zones back in, and well, if he has, Draco’ll be there to call him an idiot when he messes up.
The grin that breaks on Harry’s face a moment later confirms that she made the right choice. She bites her bottom lip to try and contain it with limited success and Draco can’t help but lean in, rolling them until she’s on top of Harry again. She likes this position; she could definitely get used to it.
“I think that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me,” Potter says, flashing his teeth in an annoyingly charming smile, and climbs out of view.
She tightens her ponytail, gripping her broom between her thighs to keep steady, and gives Harry a pointed look. He’s been absolutely hopeless since Malfoy moved in.
As if summoned by Draco’s musings, Potter appears in the doorway half-dressed, standing on one leg to stretch the muscles of the other, and looks right at Draco. There’s a heavy silence. He switches legs, grunting slightly, not breaking eye contact.
. It feels like weeks since he was last curled up on his lumpy bunk mattress, and he thinks a break from the constant duelling and running and wound-staunching is pretty well deserved by this point.
It doesn’t really sink in that this is happening until Harry’s face to face with the rocket and then he remembers to be excited, the sensation hitting him all at once so that he has to bite back a laugh at the sheer wonder of the moment.
Weasley turns to him immediately, eyebrows raised. “You mean in general? Or why he’s been acting weird around you?”
“You going to come?” Harry asks, and Draco can only nod, can only lie back and take it as Harry doubles her efforts, her hand moving fast and hard inside of Draco. Draco’s legs bend at the knees, her feet pushing into the mattress, hands scrabbling up behind her until she can get them into Harry’s hair, tilting her head to capture her mouth again. It’s a bit of an awkward angle but Draco’s too far gone to actually kiss Harry anyway, so she just breathes against her mouth and feels everything peak, bright and white-hot.
The bathroom smells good, sort of clean and woody, which means Potter definitely nicked some of his products again. Not that Draco really minds. It’s distracting, is all, having to wash himself with soap bars that may or may not have touched Potter’s body, lathering shampoo into his hair from a bottle that might have, only hours before, had Potter’s hand wrapped around it, squeezing.
” he says grumpily, lowering his voice even though they’re hovering twenty foot off the ground and Malfoy definitely can’t hear them from where he’s sprawled on the grass with Luna and Pansy. Malfoy’s phone is blasting Britney Spears so loudly it’s a wonder they can even hear each other.
Harry sinks onto the bench opposite the other four, feeling like he hasn’t quite woken up. It isn’t— it has to be a coincidence. The guy’s wearing a dark shirt and pajama pants that Harry is pretty sure are
“Draco,” Potter whispers, but then his hand brushes down the vulnerable skin of Draco’s neck and catches on something behind one ear. Draco flinches, tries to shift back. Potter holds him still with a surprisingly strong grip.
“I wasn’t expecting it, that first night. Suddenly it had all these flowers again and then you were there in the window, which was, you know, a whole other-- surprise.”
Things have escalated. Malfoy’s volume levels, the amount of self-awareness Harry is willing to indulge in, they’ve escalated.
“C’mon,” Ginny says, taking the magazine out of Luna’s hand and replacing it with her own so that she can tug her towards the front of the shop. “We might as well make Harry buy us this. It’s got free stickers.”
Malfoy falls silent and Harry sighs, flopping back onto the mattress and ignoring his erection. He probably deserves it anyway, to just lie there, frustrated, unsatisfied. That’s what you got for refusing to do anything about what you want, or for refusing to even admit that you want it in the first place.
Ginny only cackles and pinches him again. “I suppose that would explain your silence. Maybe I’ve got you gagged.”
He’s drunk, too, Draco can tell, or tipsy at least. There’s something looser about his movements, the never-ending shift of his body less anxious. He has another rock in his hand and he throws it up in the air and catches it, shrugs, grins. “Yeah. Really good, yeah.”
He kisses messily down Malfoy’s cock and then keeps going, until his mouth meets his fingers and Malfoy lets out a string of curses, his fingers curling into Harry’s sheets. Harry licks over where he and Malfoy are joined and pushes another finger into him, free hand gripping Malfoy’s thigh, his thumb stroking soothingly. Malfoy keens. His back curls and his head comes up so Harry can see his face, sweaty and flushed, before he falls back again and wraps a hand around himself. Harry tugs him by the wrist, pulls his hand away from his cock and Malfoy swears loudly at him but doesn't try to touch himself again.
, like this is one of the books Draco used to read by wandlight when he couldn’t sleep as a kid, but he doesn’t, he just stops in the doorway, blocking their only exit, and smiles.
“So.” Potter shifts again, letting his arms give out so that they’re folded on the ledge instead, feet, Draco assumes, finding purchase on the rickety trellis somewhere. He’s never still, Potter. He hasn’t been the whole time Draco’s known him. “This is your room.”
He tells Draco as much, walking along Cocoa Beach in the clear, breezy night. “This isn’t— it’s not how it’s supposed to be! We talk for ten minutes every couple of months! We have sex like three times a year at
Harry thinks maybe something might shift between them after that, but Malfoy seems not to agree because he goes out that Friday night, like usual, like nothing’s changed, and brings home— well.
Potter tightens her grip on Draco’s waist, clearly waiting for an answer and Draco looks down at her, frozen for a second, and then grabs her by the wrist, dragging them through the crowd. She can just hear Potter’s laugh at her eagerness behind her, and she could turn around to remind Potter who exactly propositioned who on the dance floor but that would get in the way of her main goal at the minute, which is to get out of the mass of people.
He finds it hard sometimes, not being able to share this whole other part of his life with them, if only because he knows how happy even the simplest of charms would make them, how big their eyes would get if he levitated their carefully constructed models and sent them spinning through the air in their own little orbits. But rules are rules (someone from the Improper Use of Magic office had actually made him
“Muggles have Christmas crackers?” Draco asks, running his thumb through the gravy left on his plate in a move that would have gotten him a ten minute lecture had he tried it back home. If his parents could see him now.. Though, considering present company and the fact he’s run away from everything they brought him up to believe in, table manners might not be high on their list of priorities.
Draco stretches, his fingertips brushing the ceiling, then shrugs, lets his legs fold under him and collapses back onto the bed with a small bounce.
She bustles around, checking the cut on Draco’s scalp which is tender, but no longer blindingly painful, lifting Potter’s blankets to inspect his dressings. They all sit there in silence whilst she works until she finishes ticking some things off on a chart and turns to them, hands on hips.
Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s jaw until Harry drops his chin again so that Draco can kiss him properly. He likes this position, likes being able to kiss Harry whilst he gets him ready. Harry wishes he could say he’d forgotten that in the years since they were last together like this, that Draco’s impatient nip at the skin of his throat, probably intended as a reminder, was necessary, but it’s not. Some nights, lying alone in his bed in Greenwich, he’d thought of nothing else.
They get Potter downstairs again, as Draco tells them about the anti-healing curse. Granger casts the diagnosis spell again, just to double check, Potter glowing blue in the dark hallway for a moment, and shakes her head in distress when it confirms what Draco already knows: they can’t do anything for him, they need to get help.
“Missed you,” Draco says later still, the words smeared into Harry’s cheek as he shifts his hips, changes the angle.
Grimmauld is convenient for uni and for work (yes, a job, how plebeian, and it pays like shit but at least it
Then, a couple of days in, they hit some turbulence. Harry calls it that, because it’s the only thing he can compare it to, but in reality it’s much worse than anything he’s experienced on a plane, worse even than the nausea-inducing motion of lift-off had been. The shuttle has layers and layers of intricate charms built into it, regulating the oxygen and gravity and stability, but things are still rough for an hour or two and Harry ends up in the tiny bathroom off of Draco’s private bedroom, apologising in between bouts of emptying his stomach. Draco tells him gently not to be stupid, and sits there with him, the room so tiny that they’re squashed together, Draco’s head knocking into the sink.
Potter chuckles weakly at the look on Weasley’s face and then starts coughing, his body shaking violently with the force of it.
Potter walks in when Draco is already two drinks deep, a recipe for complete humiliation at the best of times and that’s if Draco’s being optimistic, which she isn’t naturally predisposed to be. Pansy stops halfway through the story she’s been telling her because Draco suddenly forgets how to behave like an actual human and makes a sort of flailing gesture at the barman for another drink. From here on out, more alcohol can only help.
“Fuck,” Harry is saying, “Fuck, fuck fuck.” Draco is smiling, her eyes closed. She feels like a dead weight, supported by Harry at her back.
Potter had thrown a rock up at the unsurprisingly inconsiderate hour of half past midnight, when Draco had been considering a late-night bath before bed.
He’d closed the window before he got into bed, the first time since he arrived, because he can feel a cold coming on, the back of his throat odd and tight when he wakes up in the morning, and he doesn’t want to make it worse. He’s regretting it now though, unable to find the energy to get up and open it again, or even to roll over and find his wand. The room feels stuffy and close without the outside air filtering in and it’s making him restless.
“It’s good,” she starts, a little hesitantly, carefully. She doesn’t want to fuck this up and sound ridiculous. “Feels good.” She licks her lips; there’s a beat of silence as Draco considers. “
Potter shrugs. “Basically. Hermione figured it out in about three seconds once she got her hands on that.” He nods at the shard of metal. “It was her time-turner.”
Harry shakes his head, mouth still dry. “No,” he croaks, clears his throat. “Uh, no, sorry. Have you checked the coat pegs?” which is a monumentally stupid thing to say, all things considered, but then Harry’s fairly sure Malfoy is only using the jacket as an excuse to come in and see what’s happening, so.
“Fuck,” Draco says, forgetting to scowl. There’s a distinct thump from next door. Heat flares hard in his stomach. Blaise grins even wider. “Fuck.”
isn’t the kind of inconsiderate person who steals other people’s clothes. Just their toiletries, sometimes.
Potter almost throws his hands up at Draco’s exaggeratedly wistful tone but apparently remembers they’re the main thing keeping him secured and settles for rolling his eyes instead. “Don’t let me keep you,” he says, but ruins the exasperated tone with a look that Draco might call fond, on anyone else.
he has to have someone in there with him. Harry had watched him climb the stairs alone but he’s never known someone make this much noise unless they’re getting fucked within an inch of their life. Maybe he has some kind of toy or something, or is fingering himself open steadily, other hand working his cock slowly as he shoves his hips down.
, which he’s been neglecting in favour of schoolwork and Potter, and debates the merits of attending. They’ll send food up for him if he doesn’t, but he knows he probably should. It feels too weird not to go, and also like some sort of test to prove to himself that he can do this, like if he skips the first thing that makes him feel uncomfortable he’s setting himself up for a year of failure.
“Do you?” Harry can smell fresh grass cuttings from the bin, sugar carried on the breeze as Teddy yells something giddy, incomprehensible.
The back of the castle -- his side, as he’s already unconsciously started thinking of it -- really is pressed right up against the edge of the hills, the ground starting to slope upwards barely twenty feet from the stone walls. It’s sheltered, quieter out of the wind. Draco looks up at his own window but keeps his head forward as he passes it. If Potter sees him go by, he doesn’t make any effort to let know Draco know he’s there, and Draco carries on until he’s out on the bank, staring at the sky reflected so perfectly in the surface of the lake that the two are almost indistinguishable from one another.
It tastes pretty bad, because Potter has a mouthful of blood and Draco doesn’t have any kind of vampire fetish thanks, but it’s still good, more than good, more than Draco’s ever let himself hope for.
Potter rolls his eyes, which seems to take it out of him because they slip closed right after. “Pointing out that you’re choosing not to say it isn’t any better than actually saying it.”
you’re getting laid. Show him how annoying it is.” She mutters something else under her breath. Harry might catch the word
“I’m going on a walk again,” Potter tells him far too early the next morning, the sun barely up and the grass wet under Potter’s feet. He gestures behind him at the stretch of sloping hill.
Potter seems to take a second to actually consider the question, which Draco takes as a sign that no, he hadn’t had any good reason to start lobbing things at the window. After a moment he shrugs. “Just thought you might not be able to sleep either.”
“No!” Potter says again, louder. Draco forces himself to meet Potter’s eye, though his expression is uncomfortably earnest and it makes Draco’s stomach tense up. “I didn’t-- I meant to do
The wedding is in the first week of September, that brief, heady stretch of days where summer hangs around past when it should, everything sticky and slow, burnished gold. Harry’s the happiest he’s ever been, but the loneliness that sits all over his body like a second skin has also never felt heavier.
Ron does’t actually wait for an answer, just switches the channel and vaults over the back of the sofa so that he’s sitting on Harry’s shins. Harry shoves him off half-heartedly.
is the only warning Draco gets before they’re squeezing through darkness and popping back into existence in an unfamiliar room. It’s dim, but enough light spills in through the huge window that Draco can vaguely make out the shapes of furniture.
dead. He’s half-buried under a pile of rubble and there’s snow falling in from the hole in the roof. Draco really wants to sleep, properly. This passing out and waking up a few hours earlier shit is not exactly restful, even if his body restores itself every time.
, after all) and whenever it’s his turn to shop the kitchen’s always overstocked with the kind of extravagant food none of the rest of them would even think to buy (hence: the lobsters) and bottles of the kind of alcohol they would have called pretentious if they weren’t busy drinking them every weekend.
“No shit.” Draco watches the wind pick at Potter’s hair, tangling it further around his head. “Are we lost?”
Potter pulls on the clothes that Granger digs out of her bag and throws to him and then waves his wand, looking around the room expectantly until something thuds into the closed door. He goes to retrieve it, comes back with a whole load of those pill things the Muggles like to use instead of potions.
to think, even for a second, that Draco’s hunch was right, that that’s what did it, what saved them both, him leaning down and slanting their mouths together. But it seems like the only explanation. That’s the one thing he did differently.
next weekend, if people didn’t mind, and they were all welcome to invite whoever they wanted, in fact, please could they, because most of the people Harry liked already lived with him and if they were going to throw a party, it should probably have more than ten guests. Malfoy wasn’t there but he’d smirked awfully at Harry when he caught them all on their way out to buy booze.
Draco briefly entertains the idea of knocking her out. Just for a moment, so they can have a tiny respite from going over what they’ve been over three-hundred times already, but Weasley beats him to it — “Hermione, come on. We didn’t want to delay another month” — and he has to content himself with clenching his hands in his pockets.
,” and Potter is shouting too, there’s so much noise suddenly, and parts of Draco are definitely bleeding. The night has gone from quiet terror to outright chaos in less than a second and Draco’s confused, his ears ringing, skin smarting.
Potter rolls her eyes, but she also bites her lip which is promising. This whole situation is promising: them having an actual conversation, the way Potter keeps looking at her from under her eyelashes like that.
Draco doesn’t even try to figure out how his seatbelt works, just shifts along until he can prop Potter up, kneeling half over him and tugging him down gently to lie flat when he realises the momentum of the car is making his head bounce all over the place.
Harry bites hard on the inside of his cheek to stop himself smiling and feels the balloon of his chest swell. “I thought you said my name meant nothing over here.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “She’s exclusively off men,” he says, crawling over Blaise so that their hips press together. He gives a half-hearted thrust, bites his lip, tries to listen for any sign of Potter next door.
Draco’s head is spinning and she’s still wrapped around Potter, who’s holding her up with apparent ease, grinning unashamedly as if she hadn’t just presumptuously apparated them both into what looks like her bedroom.
“It is,” Draco says and watches him look around, watches his eyes take in the bed and the bookshelves and the thick rug that Draco had shrunk down and brought over from his favourite parlour at home.
Potter stops levitating the stone he’d been making float several inches above his upturned palm and looks up at Draco, eyes widening behind his glasses.
Even so, they manage to steal a private minute or two — Hermione has to go to the bathroom sometime, and everyone’s conveniently distracted by the cake being brought out — because Harry’s apparently a masochist with a sore, yearning spot in his brain where his self-preservation should be.
“Stop saying that.” Draco sits down on the bed. He wishes Potter would move his hands away from his face.
Merlin, she is an absolute nightmare, what the fuck is Draco doing. She lets her head fall back to give Potter better access and is annoyingly very aware of the surely thousands of germs on the tiled wall now in direct contact with her hair. “Potter,” she says, horrified at how it comes out like a whine, and half-heartedly tries to push her back with one hand even as she wraps her other leg up around Potter’s waist so that Potter has to support her weight.
,” Harry pants and holds Draco down, shifting her back and up a bit until she’s more in Harry’s lap and then moving her hips in these small little circles against Draco’s arse. Her fingers are still inside Draco, which is nice when she clenches down and feels them there. She feels lazy and hot, not so desperate now she’s come but still really good, all sleepy and turned on.
The doors open then, and McGonagall enters with a gaggle of children behind her, all of them looking pink cheeked and shivering from the cold. Draco supposes they’re lucky the lake hadn’t frozen over completely.
“I— what?” Draco, distracted from his attempts to hear whether Potter’s in or not, looks down at his friend.
He gets a weird look from Weasley at his use of “again”, but he doesn’t care. They need to move. He didn’t stop Potter getting hurt, but he can make sure that, this time, they get to the hospital before either of them pass out. He can still save him.
When he pushed Harry back with one hand on his chest, he’d leaned over him, the momentum making his hand slip forward so that it now sits right at the base of Harry’s throat, and it’s all Harry can think about.
Friday is a bad day. Draco wakes late and annoyed, somehow both restless and unable to find the energy to do anything, exhausted but unable to sleep.
Luna’s smile turns indulgent and she shakes her head. “He’ll figure it out. Draco’s not exactly being subtle.”
Draco’s new room is on the third floor and he can see mountains from the window. If he leans out as far out as possible without falling, and stretches to the left, he can just see the edge of the lake, dark and still in the moonlight. It’s the first thing he does the night he arrives because everything about coming back to school feels different and strange this year and being able to watch the water is a small comfort, even hanging halfway out of the window like this instead of with his nose pressed to the glass of the Slytherin dorm windows.
Malfoy nods. “I already—” he breathes, chest heaving, and Harry has to suppress a groan of his own because of course, he fucking
has. Several things, in fact. Not to stand within a ten metre radius of a time-turner when blasting curses start getting thrown about. Who Robbie Williams is. What the inside of Potter’s mouth tastes like.
“Come here, idiot,” Harry says into the darkness, voice slurred like she’s already half-asleep, and warm hands find Draco, position her until she’s on Harry’s pillow, with Harry lying half on her chest, one arm slung across her and their legs tangled. It’s too hot to be this close really but there’s no way Draco’s moving. She casts an absent-minded cooling charm over them as she closes her eyes and feels Harry press a grateful kiss to her collar bone. Then she sleeps.
Potter grumbles and shuts the window. “If you don’t want any,” he starts, but he’s already pouring it out. It must have been under a stasis charm; Draco can see steam curling off of it.
“I don’t have the right kind of shoes,” he tells Potter when he steps out of the main doors. Potter’s turned, facing away from the forest, one foot bouncing like he’s eager to be off. He glances down at Draco’s shoes and shrugs, smiles. “I don’t think it’ll matter too much.”
He tugs on something lodged into Draco’s neck and Draco swears and succeeds in jerking his head away. Potter holds it up. It’s small and jagged and sort of shiny, glinting gold but wet with Draco’s blood.
Draco doesn’t know why Potter’s telling him this but he’s not really paying attention so it hardly matters. He’s never cared much about Herbology, much to his mother’s despair. If he concentrates he can feel where Potter’s breath hits his own face, cooled by the time it reaches Draco, but still faintly spicy, his mouth wine-dark. Draco’s never going to be able to drink mulled wine again without thinking of Potter, which admittedly he only ever does about once a year, but it’s the principle of the thing.
Draco feels her bones go all pliable at the level tone and the words Potter says so freely. Potter’s teeth are a light scrape on the skin where her neck meets her shoulder. One strap of her top falls down her arm and she starts trying to get her jeans off without even undoing the button, almost braining Potter with the back of her head when she pushes up to get them over her arse.
,” Weasley says firmly. He nods at Draco and they start shuffling Potter down the street, leaving Granger to hurry after. “You can drive.”
“Right.” Neville raises his eyebrows. Everyone in this house has a bloody eyebrow-raising problem. Maybe that’s why Malfoy fit right in.
“Hi,” the man says, turning to shoot Harry a smile over his shoulder before rummaging around for the sugar. (“Wait for it,” Ginny says under her breath.) “I’m Henry.”
Moving in with Potter and a bunch of Gryffindors has been one of the unexpectedly better decisions of Draco’s life. Not that there’s much competition in that department. Aside from moving out of the Manor with little more than a
Neville, presumably in response to whatever noise Harry made at seeing the newly crustacean-filled fridge, laughs as he ducks low under the arm Harry’s using to hold the door open, pulls a beer out.
“1999,” he sighs after a moment, fingers splaying outwards in an odd, half-joking sort of ridiculous jazz-hands move. Draco’s shocked into laughing.
It’s not until they run into each again, completely by accident  — on the tube platform at Bond Street, of all places, the chances have to be astronomically tiny — that Harry even knows if Draco’s ok or not. Nothing, for eighteen months and then suddenly, there he is on the other side of the tracks. They stare at each other, the hot wind of an approaching train blowing their hair around their faces. Harry waits with his heart in his throat as the train obscures his view for a long minute, terrified that when it pulls away again Draco will be gone with it, off to wherever he’s headed or worse, never actually there in the first place, just a figment of the secret, guarded part of Harry’s imagination that still hasn’t quite stopped waiting, hoping. It wouldn’t be the first time his brain’s turned traitor on him.
Granger, the only other person in the room, doesn’t look up from her book. “Yes, we gathered. Can you stop at Tesco on your way back? We’re out of bread again.”
She reaches down and holds Harry’s hand inside her as she comes, clenching around her fingers, body tensed as it washes over her and then going loose and liquid as she finishes.
The guy is a bit short and his dark hair is messy and his eyes are green and when Harry walks into the kitchen Saturday morning in just his t-shirt and boxers he finds Ginny, Luna, Neville and Seamus sitting at the breakfast table, staring. They glance between him and the stranger, who’s busy making himself coffee, oblivious, and Harry is confronted with four sets of wide eyes and six frantically waggling eyebrows (Luna’s eyes are always wide, but she’s too focussed on painting Ginny’s nails to tell Harry with her face whatever it is the other’s are trying to communicate). Malfoy is nowhere to be seen. He probably isn’t even out of bed yet.
“I was talking about this with Hermione the other day,” Potter is saying, missing or ignoring Draco’s flinch at the mention of Granger. “There’s really no like-- PE or anything in magical education. Unless you play Quidditch.”
Draco laughs humourlessly, face upturned to the dark sky above them. “If you say space I’ll hit you, Potter, I swear to God.”
Malfoy yawns again and pushes himself off of the door. “I’ll cook them tonight if they’re taking up that much space.” He shifts past Harry to get to the bathroom. “I know a wonderful thermidor recipe.”
.” The pain is so bad his vision swims for a second and he stands, dazed, swaying, thoughts literally knocked from his mind, vaguely aware of the sound of Potter yelling somewhere to his left and a body hitting the floor.
Once, when Draco was visiting and it was summer and so hot in London that every struggling plant Harry had put on his roof to make it feel less empty had crisped up and died, they’d been mobbed trying to buy ice-cream. It didn’t happen often, probably because Harry didn’t spend a lot of time in the wizarding district anymore, hadn’t since Hogwarts, but Draco’d wanted Florean’s, so they’d gone to Diagon Alley.
Christmas, festival-for-a-personally-irrelevant-religion-turned-commercialised-garbage-holiday though it may be, and now I’m stuck in the perpetual almost-there of it all with an idiot who gets himself cut up every time no matter how differently I try and do things!”
Blaise shoots him a look but rolls them easily, holding Draco in place so that he can cup him through his jeans with one hand. “
Draco laughs again, or more accurately, breathily expels a lot of air and she’s getting close now, she can feel it.
to his father and as many valuable artefacts as he could shove into his old school trunk, it might be the only good decision he’s ever made. And the whole, not-killing-Dumbledore, not-identifying-Potter-and-handing-him-over-to-the-Dark-Lord business, too, perhaps.
Draco sees Granger stowing her wand away and fixes her with a look. She doesn’t even seem guilty for having cast on an unsuspecting Muggle, which just goes to show how much shit they’ve all had to get used to since this started.
“Hi,” Potter says on Saturday morning, clambering through the window onto Draco’s desk. He presses his mouth distractedly to Draco’s cheek in greeting and Draco freezes. Potter’s always touching him now and he’s not used to it. It’s like he’s channelled all his restless, fidgety energy into getting his hands on Draco whenever possible, now that he thinks he’s allowed.
Harry shoves his hands in his pockets. “I know. And I wouldn’t ask you to. But this— what we’re doing— it’s not really a relationship, is it?”
Potter is a truly terrible dancer. The way she moves on a broom is so brilliant and graceful sometimes Draco could cry watching her, if she’s had one too many pints at a match, but that grace unfortunately does not translate to the ground. Draco’s laughing at her within thirty seconds but she doesn’t look pissed off. She just shrugs and grins, teeth flashing, like she knows exactly how awful she is and doesn’t much care. Draco finds she doesn’t much care either, as long as Potter’s hands stay where they are and they stay this close.
Draco goes over to him instead. “It’s late,” he says against Potter’s mouth, half-hauling him inside with the kiss regardless. Potter clings to him and tastes like toothpaste.
There’s no time to try and leave. Draco’s pretty sure that’s one of the options Potter was going to suggest, but there are already footsteps on the landing. He hopes Potter’s other plan is something more detailed than just stay put and hope for the best, because that’s all Draco’s come up with.
“Look,” Luna says, appearing next to her with the magazine. “There are whole pages of just horse pictures.” She grins happily and sweeps her long hair over her shoulder, causing a man passing by them to distractedly push his trolley into a shelf. Ginny can, privately, relate.
There’s a knock on the door. Malfoy doesn’t even give Harry time to say anything, he just opens it and comes in, shutting it behind him. Jesus, he looks— well, he looks utterly fucked out, honestly. He has a high, pleased colour about his cheeks and he’s wearing those godforsaken leggings again, with a t-shirt that hangs down to mid-thigh.
Draco shoves him right back, hard enough that Harry stumbles to the side, giggling like an idiot. “Oh my God,” Draco scoffs, fighting a smile. “Fuck
“Frankly, it’s embarrassing,” she says on Wednesday, standing, hands on hips, in the middle of his bedroom. “If you refuse to talk to him about it, at least give him a taste of his own healing potion.”
“You’re an idiot.” Draco rolled over and pressed their foreheads together so hard that the bridge of Harry’s nose hurt. “You don’t have to thank me for wanting you,” he’d said into the space between them. “It’s the easiest part of my day. Every day.”
Harry’s never been this far inside the place that Draco works before. Every other time he was here, it was to watch Draco leave for another six months, not to follow him through doors that have to be opened with an identification badge and a fiddly wand movement. The long hallways and warren-like rooms remind him of old spy films, and the further in they get, the more Harry gets the impression that actually this — Harry being here in the first place — is only happening because Draco is
Draco’s known Blaise for over a decade, long enough to read the relief in the lifting of the corners of his mouth, the almost invisible apprehension and the genuine, if well-hidden, warmth at seeing Draco again.
Granger blinks at him. It had been her idea — or, the her of twenty replays ago, anyway — to tell him that, something he would have no way of knowing otherwise. A quick way to prove to them all that he isn’t lying, or completely out of his mind.
Draco sees other people too, Greg and Pansy and Blaise and friends from uni who bitch good-naturedly at him for being the one who made it, the one who’s living the dream halfway across the world, but he always comes back to Harry’s before long, breathless with cold and laughter.
“Are we halfway?” Potter doesn’t even flinch at the mention of dying. Draco supposes he’s done it a hundred times over by now, but
Draco gets up to find his toiletries as Potter starts to lower himself back down. “Don’t break your neck.”
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Yeah, but he doesn’t know it’s me in here with you, does he?” She starts shifting up and down on the bed until the ancient springs are creaking.
Five days later it’s Thursday, Malfoy is getting off in his room, making noise, Harry is lying on his bed, going insane and resigning himself to the fact that this is probably how it’s going to be for the rest of his hopefully short life. This is the state of the world now, and Harry has to accept it, even if he isn’t happy about it. He’s come to terms with worse.
“Morning,” Malfoy yawns, knuckling at one eye. He has on a ridiculous bathrobe and his hair is all over the place.
Potter doesn’t answer, seeming to consider this as he sinks back down into the water and comes up with his hair all wet. It doesn’t even sit flat when it’s soaked, still curling ridiculously in several directions. Draco deliberately looks away.
“So,” says Potter, pulling her in until she can talk into Draco’s ear. “How many songs do I have to pretend to be able to dance to with you before you’ll let me find us an empty bathroom stall?”
Draco narrows his eyes at him. “Come on, Potter, you’ve had worse. Watching you try to dance at the Yule Ball,
It’s not what Potter’s expecting but he lets the change of subject slide, his body relaxing minutely. They’re not touching at all -- Draco can feel it in the centimetres of space between their shoulders.
He carefully evens the top of the pomade back into an acceptable state, raking his sticky fingers through his hair until it lies the way it’s supposed to (less I-look-like-I-use-a-permanent-sticking-charm-on-my-scalp these days, he likes to think, and more sort of— artfully dishevelled), and heads down to the kitchen to determine whether he has any almost-stale croissants left, the ones he managed to save from the bin at work, or whether Longbottom has gotten there first. Nothing in this house is sacred, or safe from Gryffindor fingers, apparently.
Weasley manages to half-lift, half-shove Potter on to the backseat whilst Draco stands there feeling completely fucking useless and once Potter’s slumped in a vaguely upright position, Draco climbs in too and Weasley goes round the front and the doors all get slammed shut and Granger speeds them off down the quiet street.
Ginny is sweating. It’s really too hot to be doing anything more energetic than lying on the kitchen floor under a cooling charm, especially with someone who’s currently too distracted to even follow a simple game of one-on-one airborne dodgeball.
Not embarrassed enough, though, to have any kind of self-control, apparently. He comes so hard imagining Malfoy is getting off next door thinking about touching him that he actually tears a hole in his pillow biting down on it, a rip that he is absolutely going to have to figure out how to mend himself, unless he wants Mrs Weasley asking him what an earth he did to make the fabric split like that.
Potter shakes his head, ducking it so that Draco only sees his smile for a split second before it’s hidden in shadow. “Are you always like this when you wake up?”
Potter shrugs, throwing back the last of her drink. Draco watches her throat move and then quickly looks away, swallowing herself, as Potter raises two fingers from her glass towards the barman. He comes over straight away, of course, and Draco wonders when Potter’s ability to get anything she wants stopped being annoying and started being annoying
Draco nods distractedly — he can feel it dripping down his forehead — but the pain is background in comparison to the fact that Potter’s uncontrollable shaking phase is setting in.
“Ron’s right, you know,” Potter says when he lets Draco go. The light from the freezer reflects off his lenses, and Draco blinks at him.  “What he said back in the car. This probably isn’t the time to start something.”
Draco starts explaining as he spins and drops down next to Potter, who’s awake but grimacing in a puddle of his own blood. Everything’s happened much quicker than Draco’s used to and it’s blindsided him, left him reeling and confused. Might be the fucking lump of brick that fell on his head actually, but either way.
Potter tries to say something in response but he can’t catch his breath, gasping through the pain, and Draco gestures at him. “Look at him!”
“You’re forty-three points down,” she says once she’s soared back up again. Harry literally has not moved from his mid-air spot.
Harry should have sent him home, or at least given him a bucket and told him to stay out on the terrace. He’d been teaching year six at the time; if he got sick his class would be stuck with a substitute for their final weeks before summer, after which they’d be making the transition to secondary school. He hadn’t wanted to do that to them.
It takes him fifteen minutes to get ready, ten to force himself to leave his hair alone and five to realise he doesn’t really have the right kind of shoes.
He stares as Luna waves happily at him from where she’s curled on the floor, her legs folded pretzel style. Is that Ernie Macmillan at the back? How exactly had Parkinson gotten her foot behind her head like that?
Potter moves past him to lead the way back down and for a second Draco’s rendered unsteady by the wave of heat that washes over him at the movement. He knows Potter runs hot but that had seemed excessive, until he realises Potter’s cast his own warming charm over Draco.
“God bless the NHS,” he says, and the four of them file through the many corridors, hidden under Notice-Me-Nots until they’re outside in the dark. The snow here is barely snow at all, grey slush on tarmac under the wheels of hundreds of cars.
Potter frowns but wisely decides against arguing. Draco won’t allow him to be some kind of righteous protector, or whatever he’s imagining.
Draco feels his face warm and quickly starts massaging moisturiser into it. “You have fun, too, Potter. You’re not working at the minute and all you do is lounge around here and play that barbaric ball game.”
“I know!” Harry cuts her off, unable to meet her gaze. “I know. It’s just.” He stares up at a crack in the ceiling. “Does he have to be so— loud about it?”
There’s a strange, angry noise that Draco takes a couple of seconds to realise came out of his own mouth, mingling with the sounds of broken glass under their feet, Granger’s panicked yelling, Dolohov’s laughter. It’s only because Dolohov’s momentarily preoccupied, celebrating his hit on Potter by trying to curse Weasley’s left leg off at the shin, that Draco manages to body-bind him. It’s not a strong spell, Draco’s head is muddled and his arm’s shaking, he can smell blood and it’s terrifying, distracting, but it makes Dolohov fall back at just the right angle that his head cracks into the wall and he goes still.
“And that’s a bad thing,” Draco says after a short pause where he tries to decide if replying will make Potter shut up sooner or only encourage him. His voice comes out all tired and sleep-rough.
It is, of course, insane. Harry thinks he could spend as much time up here as Draco has and still not be used to it. The fact that Draco gets
Draco starts to wish, pointlessly, that the shitting Dark Lord had chosen someone with a few less brain cells to guard this place. There are certainly enough idiots amongst the Death Eaters, people Draco would have had a chance at holding off. It’s not like there’s even a Horcrux here, a fact he’s had to accept after multiple searches of the entire house. He doesn’t understand why it needs the level of sadistically enthusiastic protection that Dolohov is willing to provide.
In spite of himself, Draco’s cock twitches at that. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he says, voice gone breathy. There’s a faint sound that could have come from next door.
Draco shrugs, glancing at him in the mirror. “We were at boarding school for seven years, Potter. What did you do in Gryffindor? Shower one at a time and get dressed in the loo cubicle?”
— that he manages a Stunning spell so strong it blasts right through Dolohov’s own shield and knocks him out.
“Car crash. But seeing as there’s no wrecked car for them to find, I doubt that story’ll hold for long. We really can’t keep Obliviating our way out of things.”
It’s not a good night. Draco’s sleep has improved since the summer but it’s still hard sometimes. His brain won’t turn off, even when his body’s heavy and tired, and very time he closes his eyes he sees things he doesn’t want to. Even with the lamp on his desk glowing brightly, he’s scared of the dark on the back of his own eyelids.
“Potter, really.” The hairs on Draco’s arms are all standing on end in the cold air. “I said it was fine.”
your room,” he tries, but it comes out more tired than anything. Potter only scrunches his face up, the hint of a self-deprecating smile half hidden at the corner of his mouth, and shrugs. He looks relieved that Draco’s said something, stopped the string of words coming out of his mouth.
It’s that odd, nothing-y bit of late December after Christmas that he used to spend curled up in his room with his gifts, or slumped in the library at the Manor, eating whenever he felt like it and watching his parents decide whose New Year’s party they would be making an appearance at that year.
the one they should be worrying about. Draco’s finding it hard to tear himself away, half-scared that the moment he does, the moment he even blinks, Potter’s eyes will close and Draco will have failed, again.
Fear burns at Draco’s extremities and he tamps down on it, tries to focus. Dolohov’ll be under strict instructions not to kill Potter, but he’ll definitely go for the rest of them if he gets the chance. He proves Draco right a split-second later, sending a Killing Curse so close to Granger’s head that Weasley and Potter both start shouting even louder and the smell of burned hair fills the room.
“Hello.” It comes out like a question. Potter stares right back at him, and there’s a pause long enough to be awkward.
Draco’s hands are gentle where they close around Potter’s wrists and tug his hands down. The skin under Draco’s fingers is hot, Potter’s glasses slightly fogged up from where he’s been breathing into his hands.
They decide not to go to the Portkey office together. It’s easier for Draco to Floo straight there, and it’ll be easier too, they agree by some implicit understanding, to say goodbye in the familiar comfort of Harry’s living room.
There are deep gouges in Draco’s tin of hair pomade. Has no one ever taught Potter that you’re supposed to smooth your fingers in a circular motion to preserve the level surface of the product? Evidently not. He likely doesn’t even know what a pomade is, or where to use it, as his hair remains unruly as ever. Draco shudders to think where else Potter might have been slathering it.
that cut on his scalp hurts but he also feels like it might hurt a lot more if he stops, if either of them pulls back.
He swears and crouches lower over Potter, trying to share some of his body heat, but there’s not much of it to spare. Potter quirks a look at him at this new position and ok, Draco is practically on top of him, his body held uncomfortably upwards to avoid crushing the gaping hole in Potter’s side, but he’s
He rolls his hips experimentally and Harry bites his lip, hands coming up automatically to Malfoy’s waist to keep him steady. It’s taking an inhuman amount of effort not to just shove up into the pressure.
“Guess your mouth is good for more than making bitchy comments,” Potter gets out between kisses, and Draco kisses across her jaw, gets her earlobe between her teeth in retaliation. Her tone isn’t mean though, it’s teasing and warm and her laughter is infectious. Draco hadn’t imagined it would be like this, and she’d thought about it a lot. Passionate, yeah, hate-fuelled and angry, most likely, but not this, this easy back and forth. It’s fun, she realises a little deliriously, and
He’s on Draco’s side of the bed, standing there looking down at him and Draco absolutely refuses to move over to make room, this side’s all nice and warm from where he was happily asleep in it before Potter turned up, he can bloody well go round. Except he toes off his shoes and climbs up onto the bed instead, stepping right over Draco. His socked feet make the mattress dip and Draco stares blearily up at him, rolling over and wondering if maybe he’s still asleep and Harry Potter isn’t really falling into his bed, wriggling around until he’s under the covers, his head on Draco’s other pillow. Draco normally gravitates towards the centre of the bed, body curled inward, so their faces end up quite close.
Draco’s third drink has arrived which provides an excellent distraction and excuse to not answer that question. She’s not sure why she feels like this about Potter. Usually, she has little trouble approaching girls she’s interested in and it’s not like she thinks Potter isn’t into women, she’s seen the articles. Hell, her best friend
Harry’s heart sinks into his feet. He’d just wanted to press pause for a while, hadn’t been expecting an ultimatum, but maybe that’s what Draco wants. All or nothing. It makes sense, really. Of course he doesn’t want to wait, hanging on whilst Harry tries to sort through the jumble of his own feelings. Who knows how long that will take, and Draco has a life to be getting on with. He doesn’t deserve that.
Hermione is militant; Harry strongly suspects she’s organised the others. They rotate shifts like they’re on a babysitting rota, swapping out and handing him off to one another. Harry’s not annoyed, he knows that when it comes to Draco all his rational thinking goes out the window, but he’s amused that they think they’re being subtle. Every time they’re dragged away from each other, Draco shoots Harry this warm, exasperated look and Harry smiles back, helpless.
Luna makes a doubtful noise. Ginny listens to her turning more pages, staring resolutely at a frozen picture of a politician she doesn’t know. The way Muggle photos don’t move really weirds her out.
Below them, Luna’s drink explodes as she opens it. Malfoy springs up laughing, drops running down his bare chest and hair spattered pink by whatever carbonated monstrosity Luna picked up from the newsagents on the corner.
After a weighted pause he shifts, moves his hand to prop himself up on the bed next to Harry’s head and starts to stroke with the other again so that Harry doesn’t really have time to be disappointed. And then he leans down, nips lightly at Harry’s ear.
Granger shakes her head, shivering — from cold or fear, Draco can’t tell — and starts pacing. “We can’t risk that. We just need to get him somewhere safe so I can think.”
But he also hadn’t been able to tell Draco to leave, not when he knew how desperately he wanted his degree. So it really had been Felix’s fault that they ended up sitting on the bathroom floor at 3am, Draco’s forehead pressed to the cool lip of the bath, the charts he’d been mapping — as finished as he could get them in his current state — in a pile just outside the door, Harry trying to get him to drink some ginger ale and keep some crackers down.
“Are you bored, or something?” The night is quiet, hardly any wind, the air sharp and cold against Draco’s face.
“Right.” Blaise pops the button on his trousers. Draco spares him a glance from where he sits cross-legged at the foot of the bed, wondering if he’s imagining the sound of footsteps on the stairs. “So I can come?”
The next time Draco sees Potter he’s only just got back from the Prefect’s bathroom. People liked to talk about starting a new year how one means to go on, but Draco’s always been a big believer in spending as much of the first week of January as possible either in bed, or in a hot bath. Potter was at the window when Draco came in, warm and damp from the water, and he’d nodded in greeting, watching Draco dry his hair with a charm as he pulled himself over the sill and then sat himself there.
Draco comes home for Teddy’s birthday that spring. It’s been over half a year, and Harry’s infinitely grateful that Andromeda thinks to mention it beforehand rather than leave Harry to be confronted with an unexpected reunion at a children’s birthday party. They’ve emailed a bit back and forth, he and Draco (Harry going out and buying a computer solely for that purpose and pretending to himself that he needed it for work), whenever Draco’s been back on base, but they never really
Harry may actually growl. He grabs Malfoy’s waist and flips them, throws him bodily onto his back and hikes his shirt up, peels his leggings down. They’re fucking ridiculous and get stuck on Malfoy’s ankles for a second but eventually Harry has them off and can smooth his hands up those long, pale legs. Malfoy shudders, grinning even as his legs fall open.
“It’s good for you.” Malfoy says. Someone must have magically enlarged the space. Harry does not remember it having the capacity to hold what looks like at least half of the party guests from last night, especially with their limbs stretched out in all directions like that.
She was hoping to orchestrate this in a way that would make her look as suave as possible, maybe lean casually on the bar next to Potter in the guise of ordering another drink, but it’s ruined because Potter sees her immediately, almost as if she’d been watching her break away from Pansy. There’s nothing else for it now they’ve locked eyes, Draco’s going to bloody well go over there isn’t she? Fuck, she wishes she were less drunk, or failing that, exponentially
Harry sucks air into his lungs, feeling a bit lightheaded, in a pleasant, floaty sort of way. Malfoy watches him, one hand still combing through his hair.
And from there, well. There were only so many midnight chats under the stars, blankets pulled tight against the freezing city air, that you could have with someone before you started noticing the way your pulse reacted to the sight of them in the moonlight probably meant something.
“Harry’s not very good at realising things,” Lovegood says cryptically, nudging Draco out of the way gently to get to the cupboard behind him.
Granger doesn’t respond, or Draco doesn’t hear her, distracted by Potter’s small, hitched noises, indistinguishably pain or pleasure, Draco can’t tell.
He comes to slumped next to Pansy on a sofa that’s been pushed up against the wall to clear space, trying to decide if he can be bothered to make the trip all the way upstairs to bed.
“It’s also at your house, along with every person in the country who currently wants us dead.” Granger’s started on the wine. She has a book open on the table and a full, chipped mug with Potter’s face on, one she’d apparently bought in fourth year as a joke (Potter hates it, so naturally it’s the most used piece of crockery in the entire kitchen) and she prods at Draco with a socked foot.
Just once, he manages to get to Potter in time, predict the right moment and push him out of the way, but all that achieves is both of them in the firing line and he lies there, breath stolen by the pain, feeling Potter shake under him as they bleed out together and it goes black and Draco wakes up back in the street in the snow. He doesn’t try that again.
her money, Ron, we’re perfectly comfortable in case you hadn’t noticed—” she mutters, but she waves her wand to rearrange some names.
Big on him to begin with, it hangs off Malfoy’s frame enticingly, cutting off at his waist due to his (very slight, thanks) height advantage so that its formless shape looks somehow deliberate rather than the small tent it resembles when Harry wears it.
Every step down from his room feels like an effort. He should have asked Potter, they could have-- but no, that wouldn’t have made it any better.
, for want of a better word, and is waiting to see what Draco will do next? Draco isn’t blind. He sees the way Potter looks at him sometimes.
She puts all of her not inconsiderable skill into the kiss, nipping at Potter’s lips, licking into her mouth and then lifting off so Potter strains her head up, chasing Draco. After Draco’s done this little routine no less than three times, keeping Potter pinned to the bed all the while, Potter flops back, frustrated and pouts at Draco. “It’s my birthday,” she says, and then just lies there looking up at Draco. She must be doing it on purpose, the whole— swollen lips parted, hair fanned out around her on the bed thing, but damned if Draco isn’t completely weak for it.
happen and he’s still in the backseat somewhere, unconscious, reliving it in vivid detail inside his head. Either way, he can’t do much but follow Potter into the house and find out.
“Sorry I’m being so--” he waves a hand and then clenches it into a loose fist in mid-air, letting it fall with a noise of frustration. “ I don’t know.”
And there it is, the catch in Potter’s breathing that Draco hears behind her because they’re so close and oh, ok she was right, she can do this. It is still Potter’s birthday after all.
When he’s gone, when the screen’s gone dark and Harry’s pulled his head back out of his fireplace, he sits on the rug with his chin on his knees and thinks about how inescapably unfair the whole situation is.
He goes to the market beforehand, picks up fresh pasta and chooses tomatoes with the kind of dizzy anticipation that’s infectious, has all the stall-holders smiling back at him. He could apparate back to his flat and dump the shopping but he’s impatient and he just goes straight there, walks to Westminster in the October chill. Draco hugs him so fiercely that the basil plant he’d bought on a whim gets a bit squashed.
Of course, when it goes quiet, it’s so much worse. He goes in after barely a minute of silence, has to see for himself that it didn’t work, that staying outside didn’t do anything to save Potter.
,” she says, rifling through the pages herself. There’s a quiz with multiple choice questions and the title DENIAL: IT’S NOT JUST A RIVER IN EGYPT across the top. “Reckon I should tear this out and leave it on Harry’s pillow?”
She turns to Granger. “Abroad,” is all she says, and the nurse throws up her hands like she’s going to argue but then abruptly closes her mouth and leaves them to it.
Potter rolls his eyes and Draco drops his hand, though not before Potter darts his tongue out and it makes contact with Draco’s skin for a split, hot second. “She’s a vegetarian, Ron, honestly,” he says, starting back up the aisle.
“Um, I’m just going to—” He gestures with one of the mugs and leaves, probably to take Malfoy’s tea upstairs to him.
does he know her voice is going to get more worried? Why isn’t he in the backseat of a car with an unconscious Potter? He takes a step back and peers down the road. The car’s sitting there, parked right where they found it. Or are about to find it. Fuck, did he hit his head?
He does, at least, stop Dolohov’s initial spell, the one that goes off like a small explosion. Dolohov tries it again right after Draco blocks him, succeeds in blowing out all the windows, but by that point Draco’s had just enough time to shout “Granger! The bag!” in warning and get a hastily conjured shield up, which protects them from the worst of the flying glass.
It could so easily be an uncomfortable conversation, the memory of the way they left things still raw for Harry, but their tones are light, teasing, an undercurrent of familiarity warming every word. Harry’s dizzy with it, how they’re
Potter laughs. Draco likes it when he does that and he looks down at his hands, folding them in his lap.
“S’pose we will,” he says, mouth moving against the edge of Draco’s palm. Draco shivers. It’s not because of the temperature.
He hadn’t intentionally given Malfoy the room next to his, it was the only one both free and habitable when he moved in, and the fact that Harry’s bed is pushed right up against the adjoining wall hadn’t mattered at all when the room was empty. These days he toys with the idea of moving it almost every night, but it’s summer and too hot to be shoving heavy furniture around and, anyway, he likes it where it is. He just doesn’t like being woken up at one in the morning because Malfoy’s decided to hell with anyone else’s sleeping schedules, he wants to have
“Merlin, you smell good,” Draco murmurs. Potter’s always been this reckless ball of energy, magic and power and temper contained barely below the surface and it’s as addictive now as it was when they were fifteen and about two seconds away from decking each other at all times.
Harry feels his smile split wider, makes a gross sniffing noise and wraps his arms around himself. “I know.” And then, because Draco won’t get the reference (his literal job is in space and he
“I miss you,” Harry says, wishing he could reach an arm through the Floo and touch Draco’s cheek, even if it would only really be the cold screen of the monitor under his fingers.
The backseat gets damp and sticky pretty quickly, Potter’s bleeding so heavily. Whatever batshit, magic-repelling curse Dolohov’s hit him with means none of Draco’s
He doesn’t care that he sounds insane. He’ll explain it all properly once he’s sure Potter’s not going to die in the back of a car. He knows magic and he knows that, whilst he might be about to loop back to the start again, it’s equally possible that this has just been a one-off, a random blip, and if that’s the case, this is his only chance to make it right.
Like today, for instance. It’s gone lunch time, and Malfoy’s door is opening for the first time all day as Harry pads up the stairs, trying unsuccessfully to walk and eat at the same time without dropping tomato on the carpet. He secretly suspects that Malfoy sometimes waits until he hears Harry’s footsteps before venturing out of his room, just to orchestrate these little meetings. Harry wishes he wouldn’t. It’s quite hard to look someone in the eye when you’ve inadvertently heard what it sounds like when they’re having a really,
He finds him standing on the bed in his socks, his bag packed neatly on the floor with his coat thrown over the top of it.
“But this is a good thing, right?” Potter says eventually, frowning at him. “If you’re telling the truth and you know what’s going to happen, we’ll just do it differently. Search the place first, or take Dolohov by surprise and knock him out before he even knows we’re here.”
The view as he steps out of the main doors is reassuringly familiar, with the forest at the end of the long lawns and the lake to the left, the greenhouses to the right. The grass seem to stretch on longer than it had when he was a child, though that’s backwards.
of the end, because things have been stretching thinner and thinner for weeks and Harry making the trip over to see Draco that summer doesn’t act like the automatic
Some idiot shoves behind Draco and knocks her so she stumbles forward slightly, catching herself on the bar-top next to Potter and getting close enough to realise Potter smells all woody and Merlin, Draco is losing her fucking mind.
It has to be late, though he has no idea what the actual time is, just that he’s drunk and his body’s tired and a little turned on from all the dancing. He notices Potter sitting against the opposite wall, eyes closed but seemingly awake as two girls Draco vaguely recognises from the Gryffindor Quidditch team sit beside him, talking quietly.
The similarity is not lost on Potter. “Bit of a role reversal,” he laughs, chokes through whatever’s caught in his throat — blood, probably, Draco can see that it’s in his mouth, his teeth a weird, smudged pink. He can’t believe Potter’s joking about that day, joking at
Ginny told Draco once that it’s good for Potter to get his aggression out via a healthy outlet like contact sport. Draco can think of several other ways Potter could release his pent up energy, if he wanted.
“Warn a girl first, Potter,” Draco is aiming for outraged but misses by about three hundred miles and lands somewhere between breathy and embarrassingly turned on. “If you’d splinched us I swear to Circe’s left tit—”
All four of them hold their breath when Potter tests the front door with his wand, Draco feels the collective pause, but nothing happens. Potter carefully pushes it open and nothing happens then, either.
Potter has inched himself slightly in front of Draco, blocking him with a shoulder. Stupid, overprotective Gryffindor. Draco’s not going to move, though.
“Right.” Potter claps his hands together. Draco’s become quite familiar with that little move. It’s the “I think I believe you but literally nothing is going to change my mind about walking into this house” clap.
Potter’s eyes go all shiny and pleased, like this is what he was waiting for, like he really came out here just to hear Draco make sarcastic comments, so Draco carries on. “I mean, far be it from me to assume the
“Granger,” Draco yells over the sound of Dolohov blowing up the floorboards just in front of Weasley’s feet. “Don’t let him hit your bag.”
Draco’s vision goes blurry. “Oh, well in that case,” he says, determined to have the last word before they pass out, “I told you so.”
They’re up high enough that the path has all but disappeared when Potter stops and stares out over the edge. Draco feels like he can see for miles, the castle hidden by the steep incline, and the cloud that had surrounded them halfway up long since dissipated into clear sky.
His mouth is warmer this time, especially when Draco parts his lips and tilts his head, gets Potter to open up too until he’s leaning back against the footboard of his bed, Draco bent into him. They’ve both got their hands to themselves and it strikes Draco as funny, suddenly, just their mouths touching and nothing else, and once he’s thought that he can’t stop thinking about how this entire thing is funny, Potter kissing him and then falling off the side of the castle and Draco bringing him in here and sitting him down and kissing him right back.
consecutive songs, someone — Weasley, if he remembers correctly, though by the end he’s little more than an orange smudge — foolishly challenging him to a shot contest until they’re both in danger of spending the rest of the night hugging the toilet.
“You should come to a game sometime,” Harry says like Draco hasn’t been to every one of her games already and they haven’t engaged in some truly inappropriate eye contact every time they crossed paths. Draco nods and, in a move she will vehemently deny later, kisses the tip of Harry’s nose. Harry looks delighted and opens her mouth so Draco has to — she
s work and his hands are red. He hasn’t seen this much blood since it was his own, mixing with toilet water on the floor of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Granger overhears. “Ron, the heating.” She takes a hand off the wheel to slap at Weasley’s arm, directing him in a low, impatient voice until he finds a dial in front of him and turns it. Draco feels warm air cough out onto the side of his face from a vent set into the edge of the door and lets out a shaky breath. He doesn’t move off of Potter.
were the seven-year-olds at this party,” he says, smile rueful. They’re round the corner of the house, hidden from the main garden and tucked together next to Andromeda’s compost bin.
Maybe it’s the kind of thing you don’t ever get used to, though, or maybe Harry’s enthusiasm is infectious, because Draco’s in his element. He’s not really needed for the work that the rest of the crew are doing — some kind of satellite repair, from what Harry’s been able to figure out, and Draco works more in the research and calculation side of things — so he’s free to show Harry around.
“Food’s about ready,” Harry says, chest warm when Draco smiles, easy and sweet, and gets up to follow him downstairs.
“So let’s stop being idiots,” Harry says. Any chance they had at going back to how they were (the way he really wants them to be, the way his whole body aches for) might be ruined but that doesn’t mean he can’t still have Draco in a different way. It doesn’t mean he has to have this Draco-shaped hole in his life forever.
“What about him?” Draco tries to snap, pushing down into the now steady rhythm of Blaise’s hips. “Shit. You should take your trousers off.”
She says it with one eyebrow raised which, excuse her, everyone knows that’s Draco’s thing, how did Potter even learn to do that, and she’s just leaning there all cocky and sure of herself against the bar. Draco wants to mess her up. Who let Potter get this confident? It’s nauseating, except in the way that it’s really not and is making Draco want to get on her knees in the middle of this crowded bar.
It had been his idea to come here. Draco doesn’t think any of the rest of them would have dared suggest it, or tried to stop him once he’d made up his mind. Granger has a point, it’s a risk, but he understands why Potter wants to see the place for himself. And, as Potter himself pointed out, it’s not unlikely the Dark Lord has hidden a Horcrux here. He’d left the ring in the Gaunt house.
Weasley rolls his eyes, counter-argument ready on his tongue and Draco gets up, leaves them bickering happily at the table whilst he goes and pulls the blanket off his bunk and then folds himself down just outside the mouth of the tent. It’s easier than trying to get them to stop, and it’s not like Potter should be the one out here. It’s freezing, and he needs to rest.
Draco gets ready for bed with a strange sense of deja vu that night. He’d followed Blaise to his new room in one of the towers after dinner, noted it was much the same as his own, and they’d talked for almost an hour. It would've felt like a normal first night back, if not for him leaving at the end of it instead of climbing into a bed next to Blaise’s.
Draco frowned sideways at him, lying on his stomach with his head pillowed on his arms. “I knew that already. I knew that when we were eleven, Harry.” He snorted. “And it’s not like I’m Mr. Low Maintenance myself, I have
