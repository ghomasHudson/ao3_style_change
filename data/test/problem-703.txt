“I don’t doubt it.” Draco awkwardly stroked Potter’s back. “But you’ve got Granger and Weasley and even me. We can figure this out.”
“Suits you,” Harry said with a grin. “And here, this is for the two of you – well, three of you, technically.”
“Ah.” Harry sighed. “It’s complicated. I won’t bore you with it.”
Harry took and released a deep breath, then nodded. “Alright. Did you ask him who’s been given a barrier cube lately?”
“Right,” Draco says. When warm breath brushes his cheek, he realizes that Potter’s still gripping him by the shoulders and standing way too close. He considers asking to be released but feels strangely reluctant – probably because it’s not strategically smart to alienate the only other sane 8
“She does,” Harry said, “We’ve talked a couple of times. I feel awful that my vanishing has affected her so much.”
"Yes, it is." Hermione turned to go back the way they'd come, and Draco followed, but they both froze when they saw Ron and Blaise headed their way.
“Er…God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs,” Draco improvised.
Draco breathed, because that made a scary amount of sense.
On a piece of parchment, Harry wrote the entire thing in abbreviations – so many that there was no way Draco would have been able to read it if he hadn’t helped come up with it, but could do very little except trust that Harry knew his friend well enough to be sure she’d understand.
“I still have no idea what you’re talking about,” said Draco.
“Severus, if you shout at the boy like that again, I will throw you out of the hospital wing. Are we clear?”
“I can't either,” Draco admitted tonelessly.
Draco scowls. “No. I
“Because he’s the only one who’s crazy enough about you, and crazy enough in general, to do something this ridiculously over the top.”
“I…I don’t know who you are.”
“I think Leroy is a ridiculous name,” the bigger goblin in the flower-print tunic joined the conversation. “Of course, most human names are.”
Harry’s eyes widened when he heard Draco beg. Without another thought, he fell to his knees at Malfoy’s side and seized his limp hand. It was only now dawning on him that this was not some sort of minor injury. Draco was in danger of bleeding out, and if that happened, it would be Harry’s fault. Suddenly terrified, he shook the limp body, screaming, “Malfoy! Come on, wake up! WAKE UP!”
“Harry!” Bones shouted, and took a step towards them, but then her eyes widened and she barely got a shield cast in time to ward off a nasty-looking dark red hex coming from one of the doorways. Another spell came flying at her from a
her?”
“What did we miss?” Potter asked immediately.
“Oh. Well, come on in then, I’ll get her for you.”
The knot tugged and twisted unpleasantly, bringing a bitter taste to his mouth, but then it loosened.
And speaking of appreciative, Etalice has been the absolute champion of the quick beta and master of valuable comments for this chapter!
“Is there a chance someone could have checked one out and not used it?”
“Oh. Yes, it’s afternoon, about a quarter to five. How are you feeling?”
Draco carefully closed the book he’d been reading and laid it aside. Harry had gone to visit the Granger-Weasley residence and left him not quite knowing what to do with himself, so he’d started on a book Pansy had lent him ages ago.
“That was the most fun I’ve ever had in that place,” Draco said when they were back out on the street. “Thanks.”
Draco snorted inelegantly. “Joke’s on her then, because it’s based on a Muggle method.”
“Yes, but if I wasn’t missing something vital, we’d have our answer by now. I
He could see her desire for his help warring with her need for discretion plainly on her face, and decided to try and help the matter along.
“Maybe it’s for the best. If I’m fired, I won’t have to worry about running into him in the lift or the cafeteria.”
She sighed and threw a quick glance Marielle’s way. The other woman smiled and put her headphones back on without a comment.
Babs gasped and clutched her chest.
“Very well.” Draco waited for Potter’s quill to stop scratching. “Did she mention feeling strange at any point? Did she look uncomfortable, sick?”
“Why is it you sound so sceptical?”
“Yes, sleep,” said Potter. “Sleep sounds like an excellent idea.”
Harry snorts. Parkinson certainly has a way with words.
“Screw your betting pool,” Draco snarls, and yanks Potter close by his shirt. Their lips press together, and the joyously warm feeling of it manages to drown out Theo’s pained words of protest and Blaise’s pleading that they
"What else is involved?"
“She only joined us a few days ago. We thought she just wanted a warm, dry spot to take a nap and maybe a full belly, but she seems to have appointed herself Hospitality Manager and decided to work for her keep.”
Harry was suddenly worried. There was no way he wanted to lose the Half Blood Prince’s advice. This year had been the best he’d ever done in potions, and now he was supposed to give the book to his most hated teacher? He was reluctant, although a little voice in his mind pointed out that it was unfair to everyone else if his success had been brought forth from someone else’s knowledge.
Draco looked after Blaise for a moment and frowned. Granger and Potter wouldn’t like it if he stuck his nose into their affairs. On the other hand, if it concerned him in any way…
“Yes, but it’s only half-official, so don’t go shouting it from the rooftops.”
Harry stood near her, helplessly. The last thing he saw before the curtains around the bed were closed was Madam Pomfrey’s agitated face and Malfoy’s seemingly lifeless body as they extracted him from Harry’s cloak.
“By himself?” Draco scrubbed his palms across his face. “With nothing but – I presume – a hastily applied glamour between him and discovery? Merlin on a manticore, that man.”
“I do remember,” Parvati confirmed. She’d taken her hand off her wand but still looked beyond tense. “Does this have something to do with the Department of Mysteries?”
“There's something I think you might like,” Harry said. His hand left Draco's hair, and suddenly he was kneeling in front of Draco, unbuttoning his pyjama top. “I need your bare back for this.”
And now his wand was all that was left, and they’d displayed it like a memorial designed to punch Draco in the gut whenever he caught sight of it.
A vague idea about Potions tutoring flashes through Draco’s mind, but he can’t manage to voice it.
“They don’t really mix as such – they form lots of lovely little bubbles that tumble all around, but in the end, they are still two separate liquids.”
“Not really the time.”
“How well do you check the depleted cubes?”
“More threats?”
said Harry. “Not
“Early dinner?” Victoria offered. “I’ll buy.”
years he has ever seen.
It was a while longer before Parvati had shaken off her paralysis. She looked at them all, then slowly down at her hands, then into Harry’s face.
can dismiss the spell. So, you see? There is no way.”
“Firewhisky is in the kitchen,” said Draco. “On the counter.”
I'm sorry about the rather large delay. I had a complete meltdown two days ago (not for writing-related reasons) that I'm still recovering from. I've had to eliminate as many stressors as possible for the time being, so I've purposely not written much as to take away the pressure coming from that direction, even though writing is generally very therapeutic for me.
“Oh. Yes, no, I’m fine. Well, I’m not
That makes me feel like you’re about to jinx me in a hallway or get me in trouble.”
“Fine, yeah,” said Potter. “I feel terrible that she’s gone through so much. I mean…imagine thinking that your Auror partner is dead because of the mistakes you made.”
Even though he wasn’t the one supposed to be giving the commands, Harry obeyed him. There was so much heat all of a sudden as his cock slid out of Draco and then back in, so much friction and intensity. Skin dragged against skin; Harry’s fingers still hung onto him hard enough to bruise as he panted into the back of Draco’s shoulder. Draco put more tension into his body and pushed back to try and help, to make the incredible feeling even better. It had been so long, too long since he’d had Harry in any capacity at all, and now, to be at his mercy like this… he could barely breathe.
“What? Why?” Draco glanced over to Bones. “The faster –”
“Always impressed me how well they manage to grow in winter,” Harry commented.
“Maybe…maybe if I reschedule, he’ll send someone else,” Draco tried.
to defeat Malfoy before he could strike Harry down. The scumbag had to pay for what he’d done. Unbidden, the spell from the Half Blood Prince’s potions book came to his mind.
She looked relieved when she said, “Gifts it is.”
He seemed to choke on the last sentence, but got it out eventually.
“Do you think he steals goblin treasures, mama?” Bug whispered very loudly.
Potter nodded. “The first time must have been right after the cairn, and then, for some reason neither of us can even guess at, I went back in time to that exact point. Why then, we don’t know. We don’t know anything.”
“At the scene of a murder,” Draco explained.
“Unfortunately,” Draco muttered before he realized what he was saying. “I mean…I don’t know what I mean. Yes, it looks just fine.”
Granger slumped, probably because of the amount of anger in Parvati’s voice.
“Oh, good,” Harry said as he walked out of it while carrying several medium-sized parcels in a wooden crate.
“He’s a
“Yeah, brilliant,” said Potter, sounding pleased. “Tell Ron thanks for me, will you?”
“Golpalott’s Third Law?” she asked. “I assume you’re treating it like a blended poison?”
to the meeting, and I can’t even finish the bloody project without his input.”
So, naturally, he panicked.
“You know, I’m on excellent terms with Rita Skeeter,” said Potter. “She’s been looking for a bit of pureblood family gossip, did you know that? Apparently, Witch Weekly readers love that sort of thing.”
“Why not? Why do you bloody care about what happens to me? You don't like me, Potter, so don't pretend you do.”
“Because…?”
“Yeah, she’s good,” Blaise agreed. “Shame she quit after Potter died. I mean, it’s understandable – losing a partner is traumatic at the best of times – but still.”
Most people look confused. “Oh!” says Hermione, because of course
Ron swiveled his chair around and gasped, his eyes widening. He clutched his chest. “Be still, my-”
Draco stared at him. Then he said, very slowly, “To send secret messages, Potter.”
It’s difficult to remember that the house-elves are planning to take over the school, and the wizarding world in general, when they’re all wide-eyed enthusiasm and eager to please and hurrying over with trays of Draco’s favourite deserts as soon as he enters the kitchens along with Potter.
“Draco, we’re walking around in a park that’s entirely empty apart from trees, bushes, snow and icicles – and perhaps the occasional confused squirrel.”
Granger’s exasperation with the badge system had known no bounds.
…who took aim with his wand and started on a furious “CRUC-”
“Brilliant.”
Her hand slid down to her belly. She gave him a small smile. "She was able to make sure that it's properly implanted in the endometrium, and we even saw a flicker of a heartbeat, which is...it affected me more than I thought it would."
“Ah, shit.” Lewis sat on a nearby bench.
“It was silly, of course, to think I could have prevented her dying if only I was trained, not when we were all in the middle of that massive battle, but the thought never quite left, that desire to protect. And now, Sylvana dying as well…this is…”
“Well,” said Draco, and bit his lip as he looked closely at the numbers.
“It’s over with, yeah?” Harry said softly, hands stroking down his arms.
“I’ll help if I can,” he said quietly.
The angle had been right, making him see stars and his blood sing, but he had to get the words out, he had to, else he’d never say them at all.
“Had a chat about this a few days ago, didn’t we?” Harry asked.
“I don't want to be greedy and selfish,” he said.
“We can just say that…never mind, we can’t write anything obvious, she’ll be able to see all the messages when I come back out. Bloody hell.”
“Flavors, Greg, we want to know the flavors!” Parkinson butts in.
“Do excuse me, Potter,” he drawled as he got up, stepping over Harry's legs just as a balloon exploded overhead and showered both of them liberally in green sparkles. With a muttered curse, Draco stalked off, barely just catching Potter's half-open mouth and forlorn expression.
Apparently, he sounded more upset than he meant to, because Draco turned around and gave him a smile. “It’s kind of sweet,” he said. “And I don’t plan on breaking your heart in any case.”
“Crystal. Quartz, to be precise, as pure as possible.”
A jolt of fear shot through Draco. Potter wasn't supposed to be this observant, this smart. He wasn't supposed to care about anything Draco did, the same way that nobody else cared these days. Not even Pansy had remarked upon his eating habits, and he'd thought she would be the one if anyone would.
“No cause for alarm, dear audience,” says Ron. “It’s just our favorite Dark Lord vanquisher throwing pots and pans at everyone.”
“No, I mean, I’m literally working on it. I’m painting something.”
“He’s there, Professor,” said the young apprentice, pointing at the bed half-hidden by the curtain.
“Cheers,” said Weasley and tossed his letter near hers. “Little Lamb of God.”
Severus thought about what he had just heard. He hadn’t truly thought that James Potter’s son was cold enough to knowingly use a curse as dark as this one on another person, and he could confirm it by simply thinking back to the utterly distraught boy rocking on the floor earlier. But, more importantly, the boy had actually managed to somehow get his hands on Severus’ old potions book. It had been in a cupboard in the potions classroom, although Severus had forgotten all about it until just now. Under these circumstances it would certainly be best to take possession of it again.
“I guess he’s not…horrible as such.”
“To what?”
She nodded and sighed.
“Blaise.”
“Er, I don’t even know what this is, frankly,” Potter told her. “Or where it’s supposed to be from.”
Out in the open, that was where. And, much as Draco wanted everyone to know he belonged to Harry now, he couldn’t see it ending well. People would be so shocked. Reactions would be even worse than they had been when they had appeared in public as friends, and well-meaning students would reason with Harry, telling him the many reasons why this was such a very terrible idea.
The Floo flared again.
Draco bought a generous armful of gingerbread, then waited until they’d reached a spot between booths that hid them relatively well and put them all in a bag that would have made any muggle question either their sanity or their understanding of volume.
want to go out with you!”
It’s over, all of it, after such a very long time, and he thought he would know relief when the time came, but right now, he knows nothing. He is a puppet with cut strings. His purpose is fulfilled, and he thinks he should know what is next, that people will expect him to know, but he has lost the ability to move forward.
He stops at a window and steps up to it to survey the destruction. He’s sure everyone will join the rebuilding, that a world without Voldemort will band them together, if only for a time. The thought is nice, comforting, but not what he needs right now. He looks over to Draco, who is leaning against a bare stretch of wall, one foot propped against it, and is searching Harry’s face for something.

Clearwater deflated and sighed. “I honestly, truly wish I hadn’t been forced to do that to her. But you lot just wouldn’t leave well enough alone. Look at you, you haven’t even learned from it – otherwise you wouldn’t have gone through my things and I wouldn’t be standing here hating the fact that I have to keep the information from getting out.”
“No idea,” he told her. “I could probably write an entire thesis trying to figure it out.”
“What is this thing?” he asked with a frown. “Why does it…does that say ‘McGonagall’?”
“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “but the problem is, of course, that we’re talking about something that’s essentially both metaphysical and metamagical in nature.”
Hesitantly, Draco suggested, “We should think about this in time loop terms. It might be something that won’t matter until later. Maybe there will be a development in a few days that gives you the password.”
“Oh. Not a bad idea.” She pulled her wand out and took the bookmark from between the pages, making Draco realize it was where she had noted down the code. “Secretum Lingua Videre Hallow,” she said, and touched her wand to the parchment.
“Yes,” Potter confirmed. “We won’t take up much of her time, but we do need to speak with her quite urgently.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Devastating,” Granger said quietly when Parvati seemed unable to find words. “I’ll see if I can find some biscuits, alright?”
The two old ladies exchanged looks.
“I’d be happy to explain,” Luna said.
the Christmas tree reappeared.
“Bake!”
“No, I can,” she replied absently, “I just don’t know which one to pick. I think I’ll go with ‘O Come, All Ye Faithful’.” She set her letter down on the table.
“Why in Merlin’s name does he even work here?” Draco asked as he began to inject the serum with care. “He’s utterly insufferable.”
“It would be counterproductive to figuring out who did it,” Draco said. “I’d lose the ability to ask questions to the witnesses, for one, and I’ve gotten some helpful information that way.”
year common room, behind several stacks of books, in order to try and get his homework finished without encountering distractions starting with the letter “H”. But he was foiled when the same owl who had delivered the small package landed on his parchment and hopped on the not-yet-dry ink.
“Malfoy, nothing happened. It was just... just the light.” It was Potter's voice, close to his ear. “Just the light,” he repeated.
Oh Merlin fuck. Right.
“Merlin fuck,” Draco said for the third time. It seemed appropriate enough, because in front of him, in a makeshift bed in the Department of Mysteries – in Hermione Granger’s office, to be precise – was Harry Potter.
She rolled her eyes. “Thanks. It hasn’t really sunk in. Frankly, it’s not my biggest worry right now; I’ll process it when I have the time to.”
Potter shook his head. “No, she hasn’t had any luck. Do you think it’s the same sort of encryption that yours had?”
“Yes,” Sky confirmed. “Very romantic shackles though. Good luck, Harry! Er, Henry! Come back soon and bring Draco along, will you?”
But Harry was prepared and had faster reflexes. Without hesitation, he hurled “SECTUMSEMPRA” at Draco.
Parvati nodded.
The corners of Draco’s mouth pulled up.
“We need a good cover.” Draco runs his fingers through his hair. They aren’t entirely steady. “Maybe…maybe we should pretend we’ve caught the insanity bug too.”
Potter looked up sharply right when something occurred to Draco as well. “Could this have something to do with the Time Room, ‘Mione? Is there a possibility…?”
Something in his chest tightened and hurt. Draco tried to will it away.
“We’re short on entertainment,” Philomena said eagerly.
“I was going to ask you that.”
“Fair enough,” she said.
“Maybe we should start celebrating birthdays in this department,” Granger sighed, “to remind us all how old we’re supposed to be.” She wrote something on her file and then closed it. “Sorry, Malfoy, you’ve been waiting. Did you need something?”
“I don’t blame you; you’ve been interviewing witnesses. Is Victoria still helping you?”
Evadne regarded Harry again, twitched her tail twice, and then stalked off, apparently satisfied. He found the blanket pleasantly warm and was thankful Evadne had made sure he had one.
Potter scratched his jaw. “I think he was a stripper.”
That night, Draco had another nightmare. It was all cackling laughter, pairs of eyes following him, a high, cold voice in his ears as he ran through the dark manor in search of the exit. Nowhere was safe any longer, not when they were watching his every step, waiting for him to fail and be punished some more. His aunt, gleefully telling him she couldn't wait to
“Har –” he started as she stepped aside to let him on. “Er, Henry.”
“Alright, I’ll bite. Why in Merlin’s name weren’t you able to just walk out of the bloody thing?”
have a leak then. But we’re all exhausted and doing literally nothing else, and we can’t sustain that.”
Draco stared at his hands and tried to figure out why he wasn’t just walking away from her. Hearing news about Harry was what did it – he was like an addiction, and simply hearing the name flooded Draco with a warmth he hadn’t felt in days. Merlin, he
Blaise gave him a 'you are a ridiculous plonker' sort of look. "Of course not."
You’re bloody awful at picking them.”
“You had no way of knowing.”
“Well, my guess would be that he’s desperately in love with you and therefore doesn’t want you to think badly of him.”
They all waited, Harry biting his lip, Draco barely resisting the urge to run his hand through his hair, and Granger clutching her hands in her lap so hard her knuckles were white. Parvati sat straight as an arrow and still as stone, not even blinking as she took in Harry’s appearance.
“Well, fuck,” he said.
“Alright,” Potter said and blinked at him, “How’s that: I’ll give you one question in exchange for your silence in the matter.”
he looks so beautiful Harry has to take a deep, shuddering breath to calm himself. He could stand and stare for hours.
Draco marvelled at how calm Harry sounded, but he felt extraordinarily foolish when it finally occurred to him that Potter would hardly have been such an excellent Auror if he was likely to crumble under pressure.
“Please,” Potter rasped.
“I’m not even denying it. It took me forever to realise.” Harry pulled Draco close, back to chest, and pressed a kiss to his nape.
“It’ll be cancelled out by the Slytherin green
“Oh.” Draco looked at his feet. “No, I’m fine.”
“I miss you,” he rasped into Harry’s shirt.
“Could have been worse,” Harry says, in a somewhat pathetic attempt at cheering up. “You didn’t get last place.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry continued to look at him. Draco couldn’t help but wonder what it was he saw.
“That kind of makes sense.”
“Until I’ve calmed down, yes.”
“Perfect,” she said once it was done and the string of lights took up the entire length of the sofa. With a flick of her wand, she plugged them back in and then used a sticking charm to affix them to the ceiling. Dimming the other light sources in the room brought about a peaceful, cosy atmosphere that Draco welcomed with open arms. He sat with a sigh that was a whole lot deeper than he had planned.
The door to June’s room opened, and a girl with messy brown hair wrapped in a blanket blinked sleepily. “Aurors?”
“Look,” said Potter while they waited. “Penis candles.”
“In my opinion, the answer is ‘no’ to all of them,” said Draco.
“Yes. Charming girl, she was, albeit a bit…” Babs tutted again. A glance told Draco that Harry was also confused.
Harry's arm came around him. “Be greedy and selfish, Draco. Please.”
“The problem is that if I did, my mother would clobber me with the nearest antique vase and then start lecturing me on family bonds and loyalty as I lie on the floor bleeding.”
Draco nodded and paused in his examination for a moment so he could think. What was likely to give him the most satisfactory answer? Asking about the writing? The poison? Demanding an explanation as to how Potter had survived the Fiendfyre? He wasn’t sure how long it might be until there was a chance for him to find out anything else.
“What,” Potter says flatly behind him. He clearly can’t believe his eyes any more than Draco can.
By the time he got there, she had saved her spot with a bookmark and summoned two glasses of water. She was hastily trying to untangle the string of fairy lights but gave up after a moment, instead unplugging them and moving them out of the way with a frustrated swipe of her arm.
“A candy cane that’s shaped like a ‘W’.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Let’s try it, come on. Everyone take one and name a Christmas carol!”
“She’s never worked down here, because some higher up cleverly decided that sort of experience wasn’t needed to oversee us.” Hermione sighed. “Idiotic, but she’s what we’ve got. She’s far too nice to fire Zach for anything but egregious misconduct.”
“Oh?” Draco frowned, and then something clicked. “
“And she said to tell you that Zabini is rather upset with you. And I talked to Parvati as well, she gave me a few more facts that should help us.”
“I don’t have one, I’m a Squib,” Sky said cheerfully.
Only after Potter's footsteps faded did he realize that he still had a serene smile on his face.
Out of words, Draco drank heavily. Warm fingers pried the goblet from his hands, and the protest died on his lips when he finally looked up and into Harry’s eyes.
“Stanislaus would have been in possession of her notes until he died, and afterwards they would have been inherited by some family member or another. If Clearwater
“I think you’re working toward some kind of goal,” Granger said. “And you get a little closer each time, and then leave yourself another hint for the next loop.”
Draco found refuge in the calm and repetitive work of brewing. Tucked away in a far corner of the dungeons, he went about the business of squishing eel eyes with his silver knife, chopping rat tails and nettles and counting under his breath as he moved his stirring rod. His skin felt flushed from the heat of his burner. His nose stung from the fumes, and his fingers were stained a greenish brown.
can’t find one either?” Draco asked her.
As in, an ancient burial mound?”
“Merlin, you’re a good actress, Granger,” Draco marvelled.
young man?”
“It’s nothing.”
was obvious, to them.”
“We need to get to the bottom of this,” Potter mutters.
“Well, it definitely makes things harder. But I’ll keep trying every new name and word I come across, hopefully I’ll get it at some point. Every time I’m remotely bored, I try new words, anything I can think of.”
Draco looked away and plucked another blade of grass. He took some time to think about the answer before he gave it, and Harry, thankfully, didn't push.
Just as Harry makes an unenthusiastic move to disentangle, they hear familiar voices, and Draco crowds him back against the wall so hard that their mouths almost collide. They both stand there, frozen, and Draco’s racing heartbeat is making his breath come short and his body feel all tingly and soft. He has clearly realized the mortal danger of the situation and is extremely worried about being discovered.
“You were driving yourself bonkers reading about everything that could go wrong,” Weasley protested and looked at Harry for support – and then even to Draco.
“Fine,” Harry stepped back into the corridor, but he couldn’t resist shouting back, “I’m telling Hermione that you lumped your intellect in with hers!”
“Whatever. Are you finally going to throw yourself at Potter after this display?” She gestured around the room.
“The castle,” Potter said and looked towards it, so very near now.
Prompt #25 – A Christmas cracker
Draco had to admit, however, that it was all far enough in the past now that the memory and the shame that came with it were no longer all-encompassing. He turned and regarded the elaborate iron sign that hung from the archway they had just passed.
And here Draco was supposed to be a successful, knowledgeable healer and a worldly and confident man. This was getting ridiculous.
Draco made a grab for his water glass because his throat was suddenly bone-dry. He truly wished he’d never had that moment of realization the night before. It was messing with him something fierce.
“Yes, I’m aware, Sue.” Potter adjusted the grip on his wand. He was frowning as well, looking tense, focused. “Since when am
“No, because this victim…” Draco looked up at Granger, not sure how much he should share.
“I was scared,” Draco says. “I’ve always been scared.”
“No talking!” Hermione snaps at them, looking as though she is ready to burst into tears.
“No, you prat, that we can finally stop stressing out about the bloody time loop repeating and turning us back into two people who don’t want to make out with each other any chance they get.”
“I despise you,” Draco said for the record and sat on the sofa. “But I won’t deny that I deserved that.”
He was a terrible father. Draco was retarded because of a cushioning charm! What the hell?! What'd it do? Repel feelings from impacting?!
"Nothing! Positively nothing! The git just walked off!"
...And that may have come off too strong, Lucius realized a little too late as he watched Draco's burst into the brightest red he had ever seen that traveled down his neck to his shirt collar. He was eerily still, Lucius couldn't even see him inhaling. There was no way that broke the teen. He only said to kiss Potter. Geez, Draco was grown enough to at least be able to talk about kissing without shutting down, right? When he had been that age, he already knew the whole nine yards...
It was supposed to be easier; everything, that is.
"Well, are you going to answer me?! What do I do?!" Draco huffed with a pointed look on his face that was learned from his mother, most definitely.
"W-wha..I.." Lucius would have laughed at the small squeak that ended in, but he was already running through the best solutions to fix this conversation. Brutal honesty seemed the best way. Maybe it would pound through that cushioning charm.
The silence that followed after was like a dose of pepper-up because suddenly Lucius felt wide awake and firing on all cylinders as his mind narrowed down like tunnel vision. Shit. He hadn't said that allowed, right? Cissy was going to slowly detach his arms and legs one by one before cruio-ing him into a coma. He lifted his head to stare at his son whose skin was a shockingly bleach white. There was a sort of stand still where father and son were locked in a staring contest; Lucius wasn't sure how much time passed but as he saw Dracos form sway backwards, his mind immediately locked down. Draco could smash his bloody head! He was not going to use a merlin-be-damned cushioning charm! There was no telling what else that would fuck up!
He enjoyed the next decade raising his spoiled son before his 'Lord' returned as a wraith attached to Quirrell's head like some parasite; not that anyone had knew at the time. By the time news had reached the elder Malfoy, Quirrell was dead and his son had rambled on and on about the rumors floating about at school. The last few month's had been quite eventful and Lucius swore on his parents graves that he would have gray hair before the year was over. The next few years didn't prove to be any different as his Lord made increasing attempts at Harry Potter and failed. It came on suddenly that he was ensnared within Voldemorts grasp once again.
Lucius knew his kid was smart. His son had learned all his ABC's at just four years old, and was well on his way counting pretty bloody high for his age at the time! He held high grades in all of his classes and didn't fall behind in his training as Heir. He couldn't be any prouder to call Draco his son.
"...Y-you want m-me to ki...ki...Po-Harry?"
"No, Dragon, but I'm sure you will tell me." He signed his name down on the dotted line before folding the paper up to send off to the Ministry. He grabbed the next stack of papers, taking the moment to stretch his fingers out from the cramps that was starting to form.
It had been in the moment he had lost all loyalty he had felt for Voldemort; he was officially out. He didn't attend another death-eater meeting, and Severus seemed to be following in his footsteps at the murder of Lily.
Maybe he should have just spared this entire conversation and struck up a marriage contract for Draco to tie him to Potter. Damn he should have thought of that. There would have been a lot of yelling and complaining from both ends at the beginning, he was sure, but it would have eventually rolled around in Dracos brain that he might have a obsessive crush on the green-eyed boy. Potter liking his son back wasn't a question either. The handful of times he had seen them together was enough of a confirmation.

The two weeks had had been watching Draco had been stressful enough and sleep had been none existent after reading the news about the Potters; its not like he intentionally dropped his baby! ...Besides, he casted the cushioning charm before Draco's head met the ground! Even Severus gave the boy a clean bill when he had been called in, Draco had been perfectly fine... There had been no reason to tell Cissy, especially with her recovering. Stress had been the last thing she needed. Feeling like he had been hit with a boulder, he slumped in his chair. He did not hurt his kid. There was no way he could've hurt his son with the cushioning charm of all things... He slumped down in his chair further feeling like the air had been sucked from him. He dropped his head against the table, not paying any mind to the quill still gripped in his outstretched hand.
"..-Could the git at least brush his bloody hair? And those aweful glasses! Father, they are three times too big for his stupid head! Why doesn't he take a damn eye correction potion? All those damn wire lenses do is get in the way! Its so muggle like!"
Lucius grimaced at the thought of giving Draco the talk if the boy was this slow on kissing. Hell no. He did his part as a parent! Cissy could get her ass into gear for that lovely conversation. He scowled. Why did he have to be the parent to scar his kid with these types of conversations? He was not cut out to be giving the boy advice of that sort because his own father never even had to. Lucius knew he was going to be married to Narcissa since his first year at Hogwarts, there hadn't been much room to expand on that bloody part!
He hadn't truly given any real thought to what would happen when his Lord did find either of the boys. He figured at most the boys would be removed from Dumbledore's manipulating hands and cared for under Voldemort's careful watch. But reading the recent events he had missed, he didn't have the chance to make it to the Loo before his stomach was emptying itself across the floor of his son's bedroom where he had been resting as Draco went down for a nap. He hadn't responded immediately to Draco's sudden cries, his stomach releasing what little breakfast he had managed to snatch and his brain reeling in tight circles as it replayed the sentences morbidly across the backs of his eyelids. He didn't know what stunned him more; the fact that his Lord murdered the Potters and attempted it on a baby or his Lord had been 'killed' by said baby. It was so absurd that Lucius couldn't hold back the disbelieving laugh as his eyes watered at the sudden looming threat his stomach gave at the thought. A baby... just barely a month younger than his own little Dragon.
Honestly, Lucius thought nothing could have brought him down. Murphy's law dug his claws deep into Lucius unsuspecting back in just a week after his son's birth in 1980. He hadn't known the domino effect it was going to have on his life when his Lord had stormed his mansion and demanded all of his followers to a meeting. His just and understanding leader seemed to undergo a revolting transformation just under two days after Severus reported a prophecy.
Oddly enough, that was the least of his worries.
"...-and the Weasel! That arse! Acting like he is all high and mighty just because he managed to befriend the Boy-Who-Lived! Weasel's a nobody! What does Potter see in that daft twat?!"
For the longest time he had been under the impression that once he graduated from Hogwarts grasp, everything was going to fall into place. After all, the Dark Lord was well on his way of working his way up to over powering the Light-oriented Ministry legally at the time and only seemed to be getting closer each passing day. More followers flowed in every day. His, at the time, fiance was unwavering at his side and his close friend Severus showed no signs of obscuring himself away from society once school finished. Narcissa supported him loyally when it came to the Dark Lord and Severus was right by his side every step of the way. Things could only look up. School ending meant freedom; relieved of the judging gazes of the other Houses, free of dancing around Dumbledore's strings of manipulation, more time to devote to his Lord's ultimate goal. Equality for all among the Wizarding World had been the original idea, that had hooked both Lucius, then Severus until it had drug every Slytherin falling into step. Voldemort wanted better laws down to protect orphans and muggle-borns, wanted to give everyone a chance at working towards their own dreams without being judged by their blood. The first eight years out of school had seemed endearingly promising. While being a extremely private person (he enjoyed wearing hoods and rarely showed his face), Voldemort had been... dare he say it... understanding and justly fair at the time. It had made it easier for Lucius to juggle his Lordly responsibilities, his duty as a Death-eater, as a husband and soon-to-be father.
And what did his son expect? Did he want Potter to hit him too? Have his other eye blackened as a souvenir to take home?
Gray hair did not look good to Lucius, and he planned on keeping it away for as long as possible.
"It's not that bloody complicated Draco! Quit being so thick-headed! You're a slytherin! From the moment you met Harry, you've been scrambling for his attention, any bloody attention! You're like a five year old pulling on his crushes pigtails and stepping on toes! You are jealous of the Weaselys and Granger because they're actually getting positive attention from the boy when you're not. Do everyone a favor and grow the bloody hell up! French kiss the boy in front of the entire school for all I care, but do not come back in my office again with one of your lovesick rants because I swear, by merlins balls, I will walk willingly into an Avada Kedavra!"
'Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...' Those words had damned two families with all of Voldemort's paranoia; the Longbottoms and the Potters both had sons born July 30 and 31, respectfully. While Lucius didn't put much into divination and all that rot, it appeared that his Lord did as it seemed to tear at the once unbreakable man for the next year; breathing down his neck. He became easier to anger and didn't hesitate to take his rage out on anyone he deemed worthy. Dumbledore's lies about all Dark magic being evil had people snubbing their noses at anyone who breathed a word of a spell 'too tainted'; it only intensified with Voldemort's volatile attitude and his appearance had turned... decidedly unnatural. Suddenly, being apart of the Circle meant being a murder and a wanted criminal for the dark arts; not that his Lord showed any acknowledgement of the sudden shift of the public's opinion, because he was busy hunting down two 15 month old babies.
"We're obviously not talking about Weasely, Draco! You're damn crush started years ago, and your mother said to let you work it out on your own, but I don't have the patience to wait until your peanut of a brain figures it out. I hate to break it to you, son. You're romatically fucking hopeless! So let your dad be the one to enlighten you, you've been lovestruck dumb with Potter since starting Hogwarts. Now that I have done more than my share as your father, please use your brain to solve why your constantly soaking in Potters business and hunting him down, and do something before I am forced to an early grave!"
"-...blew up Uncle Severus' class with a simple calming draught!"
"Kiss him, hug him, ask him on a date, shag him, court him for merlins sake! Anything! Just stop with the five year old antics."
He fought a grimace as he looked down at his papers. Was his kid this way because of the 'incident' all those years ago? He mechanically signed another paper without looking, else he would have noticed his signature in blue ink spread across the paragraph, instead of beneath it. If he was being truthful, he tried not to think of the said Incident because his wife would skin him alive if she ever found out.
Despite popular belief, Lucius did not work well under pressure. His mind liked to focus on one task at a time, look at every possible outcome for that problem before he moved. And his mind was already working on the fuck up from over a decade ago, and the possible complications that it was proving now. That was a massive load on its own, not including the pile of paperwork that needed to be done weeks ago, and Lucius mouth never had much of a filter at home around family when he was deep in thought.
"-at mudblood hit me! Me! And do you know what Potter did?!"
Lucius blinked at the sudden silence, realizing that he was expected to respond in some form. Damn.
Potter shrugs. “I saw Hermione eat one of the Bakewell tarts and asked her if she was crazy. She said that Parkinson and she had a good talk. That’s all.”
Prompt #20 – Icicles on a tree
There is so much between them, history and hurt, but in this very moment, it all drains away like snow on a warm summer day. Harry fancies he can feel the sunrays on his skin.
"Of course you can," Harry called back from the corridor.
“He’s in pain,” Granger whispered.
She fell silent. Draco thought she’d probably realized that Potter wouldn’t be easily swayed, if at all, and he guessed she also didn’t want to keep arguing with him.
the answer he should have given.
“There was a sound,” said Clearwater. “Some sort of strange…it’s difficult to describe. The Veil’s always whispering – that’s why it’s policy that no one goes in by themselves, it gets dangerous if you start listening too closely – but the whispering was suddenly drowned out by something like…like a howling wind, and the fabric of the Veil moved more than it normally does. And then Harry came sailing out.”
“My mind understands that, but the rest of me is still having trouble.”
“What?” he asked, because he was fairly certain that a kissable Harry wasn’t what she’d been referring to, and she veered right toward a tree, forcing him to step back with haste to avoid her.
“Speaking of plants, I keep forgetting about this.” He dug in his pocket and produced the small silver cube with the button. “Oi, Hermione, do you know what this is? Or Ron, for that matter?”
“I don’t believe so,” said Draco. “Even if they had, it’s unlikely they would have known what to look for. I’ll ask Parvati if there is a way for me to have a look.” He made a face. Autopsies were not something he was used to doing, and he found even the thought disturbing. But he was a professional, and so he would act like a professional, even if a small part of him wanted to run screaming like he was ten.
“Why are you –”
“It took me a while to figure out how this poison actually works.” Draco slid over another ingredient for Granger to prepare while he finished his latest set of calculations. “It’s a bit insane, actually. It enters the bloodstream – I’m not sure how, since I can’t biopsy Potter’s lungs or stomach lining, but that’s not my major concern right now – and from there attaches itself to cells in the tissue. The thing is, when I looked at what remained in the blood, and what’s attacking the cells…they’re
“How the – I don’t – fuck!” Draco threw his hands up, climbed inelegantly to his feet and started pacing and trying to calm his breathing, which was sorely necessary, because he was already starting to feel dizzy. “Obviously, there’s time sand nearby, but just as obviously, we have no way of
“Maybe. Or maybe Harry tried to be a little too clever when he encoded it. I’ve asked him, but nothing he suggested worked either. Maybe neither of us can follow his thinking.”
Draco would have laughed out loud if he’d had the energy.
“Oh, well, that makes it all better,” Draco said blandly. He opened his eyes and stared out into the darkness. The lights in the room weren’t on, so he was able to make out the broad shapes of the houses across the street.
A small smile appeared on Hermione’s face. “Mum and dad always told me that the rowan trees knew if a bad winter was coming and did their part to make sure no one had to starve.”
“Oh,” Harry repeated, even more weakly.
“She would only exist in the moment,” Hermione said softly. “No future, no past, no familiar people, nothing she knows about herself no matter how many times she’s told.”
“I hate you.” Harry said jovially, standing up himself.
“I fucking hate you.” Harry called after him. Ron only winked back over his shoulder.
Theo snorted and took a sip of his Lager. “Too late I think. He could power the whole city with the energy he’s got right now.”
“I knoooooow!” Harry said, grinning widely. “You were absolutely right, it’s fucking interesting hearing all this stories. I love stories!” Harry pressed a big smack on her temple and then let go of her.
“You always managed to get under my skin, Malfoy. Time didn’t change that.”
“Yeah, I can see that,” Ron said lifting an eyebrow. He sat down on the chair Draco vacated. “I haven’t seen you this thirsty in a while. Did you change your meds and that screwed with your hormones again?” Ron frowned. “I don’t recall you telling me.”
The reunion was fun. It was the first time in 15 years that everyone of Harry’s year at Hogwarts come together and felt good to catch up with those that had left England after the war. Old house rivalry seemed to never have existed, everyone was just happy to tell stories and to find out what people had been getting up to in what part of the world. A year and a half ago, Susan Bones pitched the idea of a class reunion during a boring inter-department ministry luncheon, where she, Daphne Greengrass, Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillen, Ron and Harry had been trying to keep each other entertained.
“You really need to stop riling me up, Malfoy.” Harry’s voice sounded hoarse to his ears. He really hoped he didn’t sound as needy as he felt right now. The twenty minutes has been close to torture.
“Yeah. I’m gonna be ok, Ron. Just need a minute. He promised to leave of ‘till after.” Harry took further calming breaths.
McGonagall pushed hard to get mind-healers available for Hogwarts pupils, and then opened the program for the general public two years later. That helped a bunch to avoid stigmatization. Still took some time and a few very good friends to get it through my thick skull that I needed help.” He snorted and tapped knocked on his forehead with his knuckles.
Harry swallowed audibly. “Yeah,” he croaked and then cleared his throat. He couldn’t believe Malfoy just proposed a One Night Stand! “Yeah,” Harry repeated, his voice stronger this time. “You go on ahead, I need to cool down first.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s lips and back up. He licked his lips and a faint blush started to tinge his ears and cheeks red. ‘Malfoy is blushing!’ Harry thought in amazement. ‘I got Malfoy to blush!’
“The stuck up, snobbish, pure blood daddy’s boy from school wasn’t your type, Harry. This tattooed, tall, dark and handsome bad-boy over there? Abso-fucking-lutely your type. I’m kinda surprised you’re not drooling,” Ron laughed.
“Apparently, ‘Mione said something. Think he finished schooling in Ilvermorny after the house arrest was lifted.”
“Thank you for pointing out the obvious”, Harry let out an exasperated breath. He suppressed the urge to adjust himself in his now slightly tighter jeans. Apparently, his blood had found another place to pool than his head. “Fucking hell, Ron! He’s hot! Why didn’t I know that Malfoy is hot? Why do I even find him hot? He’s not even my type!”
“You should stop giving me ammunition, Potter. I got enough in the last hour to destroy you for the next century.”
“Tell you what, Potter.” Malfoy murmured, now with a husky voice himself. “I’m going to let you breath for a bit. We are going to mingle, enjoy ourselves, see how this evening goes on. If by the end of it you still want to, I am up for a roll in the sheets, no strings attached. Ok?” His ears were bright red by the end of his proposal.
Harry let him off without finishing that sentence for once, continuously rubbing circles on his stomach. He looked up just as the bag finished emptying its contents inside Draco.
“Now let’s walk around for a bit and enjoy this exceptionally good weather we are having.” Harry said as they got up from their table after leaving a generous tip. Draco had stumbled for a second, as if the change in position had suddenly brought every sensation rushing back. Harry slipped his hand around him in support, working his hand once again to the pump and squeezing it.
Harry continued to thrust shallowly until his cock felt oversensitive. He slipped out with a soft plop and Draco didn't seem to register anything even as Harry scooped up whatever cum had dribbled out of Draco’s well used hole and pushed it back inside.
As Draco stood up to follow the instructions, Harry made his way to the broom closet to retrieve what he needed next. He took his time, cleaned up a few cobwebs while he was there to make sure Draco was already kneeling when he went back. After all, his pet loved surprises.
“Nonsense Draco, you love walking in this weather as much as I. Are you saying you want to go back inside?”
“Almost there pet, almost finished. Count the last four strikes for me love.”
Still holding Draco down with his cock lodged in his throat and sporadically spurting cum directly into this stomach, Harry let out a satisfied groan.
“You can go now. And make sure you crawl back here and kneel as before.”
"Please let me taste you"
Before turning the water on, he sat down on the couch and pulled Draco’s head on his lap. He gently pushed his matted hair back from his forehead and looked into his tormented eyes. They had lost their focus and Harry could see Draco was starting to drift off already. And while that was part of the endgame, it was too early to let Draco lose himself. And so with a flick of his wrist, the water once again flowed from the bag.
“Harry it burns!” He cried when he was finally able to form words.
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asked yet again.
“So full Harry...it’s ripping me...please…” Draco moaned
Harry finished securing Draco's right ankle to the rings he had built into their bed for this specific purpose and then stood back to admire the spread eagled form of his lover. Every cell in his body wanted nothing more than to be buried balls-deep into the scorching heat of Draco’s ass and ream him till he forgot his own name.
Draco’s mouth opened and closed mindlessly and it gave Harry an idea. He freed his cock from his pants that he hadn't bothered buttoning back up. He wasn't totally hard yet, but it was getting there. He fed it inch by inch to Draco but stopped him before he could start sucking him down. “No suction pet. Just warm my cock like a good little cocksleeve.”
Harry did not intend for these strikes to be particularly hard, but he did mean for them to have a big impact. Aligning the paddle with its target, he brought it down smack on top of the plug, jostling it and sending shockwaves through Draco's ass, into his stomach, up to his lungs and out of his mouth in a scream that was probably heard by their neighbors.
“There’s my brave pet.” He murmured right in Draco’s ear, dropping a quick peck on his blushing cheek.
The rest of the meal went swimmingly, for Harry that is. They loved the home cooked feel of the food at Angelo’s and the anonymity it gave them both being a muggle establishment. While he was jittery at first, Draco seemed to have settled into his situation by the time the desserts rolled in. Harry let him enjoy his chocolatey goodness in peace. His pet had earned it by taking everything Harry had given him so far so well.
"Brace yourself. I'm going to pull the nozzle out and you better not create a mess here or I will make you clean it up, with your tongue.” He warned Draco who simply hung his head with humiliation.
Draco gave a small sleepy and satisfied smile and Harry wondered if he thought they were done now. Wouldn't do to give his pet any wrong ideas.
Chapter 1
“I need..to go...to the bathroom..” he whispered.
He let his hands linger on Draco's shoulders, rubbing them down soothingly before he crossed over to take his own seat.
As soon as he was done, Harry gently pulled his arm out. A few muttered spells cleaned up the bed and the two of them as much as possible before he pulled Draco towards him and wrapped himself around him as tightly as he could manage. Another spell covered them with a blanket.
Draco positioned the dildo at his loose entrance till it caught his rim, then he looked at Harry as ordered and slid down every painful inch. The nubs scraping at his already tenderized insides, his mouth open on a soundless scream. Once he had seated himself fully, he finally took a deep breath.
Draco’s eyes were watering and his mouth opened to say something. Probably an apology. But it never came. Instead another wordless cry was wrenched from his very soul as the surprise kicked in.
“Now I hope you don't think I have forgotten about that little part where you fell asleep in the middle of sex.” He chuckled.
Draco’s head fell and a barely audible whisper came “I'm sorry Harry. I didn't mean to...”
“Fuck me Harry please…” He finally ceded. Harry was proud.
A fresh wave of trembling rolled through Draco and Harry knew why. He loved being a cockwarmer, loved the humiliation and objectification of the act.
Harry knew Draco’s answer already from the way he was pushing back into Harry’s hand in a motion that was surely unconscious. His hips seemingly jerking both away from and towards Harry’s fingers as they twisted the plug inside his severely inflamed hole.
Draco’s back lifted off the bed, his hands pulling at the restraints so hard Harry knew he would be healing deep bruises by the time they finished.
“Either say your safeword and we stop or fuck yourself on that cock till you come once more.” Harry kept his voice as neutral as he could, not wanting to influence Draco’s decision too much.
He didn't waste any time this time before thrusting the nozzle back inside Draco’s achy and not as tight hole. Draco's sobs were more resigned this time but no less music to Harry’s ears.
Harry saw the moment Draco understood because his pleas of “No Harry” were accompanied by Harry pulling the dildo out and ramming it back again.
That was till they reached Angelo’s and were directed to their usual secluded booth in the corner. Harry waved off the waiter with his usual boy-next-door smile when he tried to pull out their chairs. Once they were in the clear, he reached for Draco’s waist, sliding his hand under his grey casual jacket till he reached the pump of the inflatable plug still up Draco’s ass. The tube was held securely by the waistband of his black jeans so only the pump showed, resting at the small of his back. Under the jeans, he was not allowed any pants of course.
“You can start now.” he said and even he knew his smile was just a little savage.
“There you go ...simply perfect.. You are doing so well Draco.” Harry showered Draco with praises as he manoeuvred his fist inside the hot slippery channel.
Harry’s smile was malicious and Draco’s eyes widened when he saw it. It never bode well.
Harry stopped digging his fingers into Draco’s bruises only to move further in and trace the plug still buried inside his abused hole. He tapped the base and it was as if he could see the vibrations as they travelled up the plug and came out from Draco’s mouth in a tremble.
“You can and you will Draco. You do not want to disappoint me do you pet?”
“Harry…” Draco keened.
“There pet...all done...it’s over…” he murmured into Draco’s ear, rubbing his hand soothingly over his arm and side, cradling him in his arms. Draco’s hands clutched around the pump he had just finished working for the last time and Harry gently unwrapped his fingers from around it.
“Two Harry …”
“Then come over here.”
When Draco finally managed to come, it was one long shuddering scream that seemed to be ripped out of his throat by jagged claws. After the shocks had subsided, Harry carefully undid the restraints and massaged all the limbs to ensure circulation. The bruises were blooming beautifully against that pale skin and Harry dropped a kiss on every one of them. Reaching between Draco’s legs, he pulled the dildo out as carefully as he could but Draco still flinched. His hole was slightly gaping at this point and Harry couldn't help run his fingers along the painfully red rim, eliciting even more flinching and a few mewls. Pulling Draco up into a seating position (one that put more pressure on his sore hole) he got him to drink some water and a few strength replenishing potions.
“Nooooo…..” he sobbed as predicted.
And Draco’s face crumpled with fresh misery.
“I know, pet.” Harry smirked. “Lots of those coming your way today.”
Draco’s eyes flew back to Harry and under all the pain and desperation Harry could see the love and trust that made it possible for them to do this.
Draco sobbed brokenly while Harry directed him to turn around and get on his hands and knees so he could pull out the plug that was still inside him.
With one hand Harry pulled out a chair and directed Draco towards it. And just before he sat down Harry whispered “Remember to be quiet now pet.”
Harry raised his hand and summoned something from their bedroom. It whizzed past Draco’s head and when his eyes settled on it, they widened with equal parts fear and lust.
“Seventeen…”
Harry couldn't stop the little gasp that escaped him at the sight of Draco’s tight hole straining so hard against the massive intruder inside it. The rim was a dark red and swollen and Harry knew without touching it that it would feel hot. He reached for the pump with one hand, using the other to tug and twist the plug and hear the resultant screams.
“Noooooooo...Haa….it hurts...ithurts..Harrrry!”
The last chapter of my first foray into writing smutty smut! Hope you enjoyed it. Comments and kudos keep me alive .
“Feel free to come whenever you want.” Harry paused. “In fact, the dildo will stay there till you come. Do you understand, pet?”
Draco’s hole was visibly straining against the pressure in his intestines and Harry traced a single finger around the red slightly swollen rim. It was going to get so much worse before the day was through, he thought to himself.
“Safeword?” He asked as he walked over, carefully settling down his accessories so as to keep his pet unaware.
“There love. It’s over now. You did brilliantly. You can sleep now.” he murmured, running his hands in broad strokes over Draco’s back.
“Strip” Harry told him, settling himself down on the sofa to watch.
“Good Morning” Harry couldn't help the sappy smile that bloomed across his face.
Draco went rigid at the command, though Harry knew it would be a lot harder to stay that way once the cramps started. “Yes Harry.”
He deflated the plug to about half its current size, before pulling it out with steady pressure. Draco wailed through the entire process.
“Green” Draco murmured, back arching under Harry’s wandering hands.
Draco’s eyes continued to map his face, faster now as the dregs of sleep vanished from his mind. Harry must have given something away, judging from Draco’s sudden sharp inhale.
“Close your eyes, and turn over onto your back. Pull your knees to your chest and show me your dirty little hole.”
“Harry….”
“Of course you don't want me to take it out. Little sluts like you always need to be filled till bursting. Always need something stuffing your dirty hole. Am I right Draco?”
“Then let's see to it. Bend over the side of the bed.”
Draco lamented loudly but his hips started bouncing off that dildo once again, the overstimulation of his prostate a new kind of hell in the immediate aftermath of an orgasm. But before long the pain was bleeding into pleasure once again and Harry watched as another orgasm ripped through him. Draco’s legs gave out and Harry could see that the only thing keeping him on that table was the cock buried deep inside his ass.
“Nine...teen…”
They spent the next hour just walking aimlessly by the river. Harry pumped the plug three more times during that and only agreed to return home when Draco simply could not take another step without agonizing pain and pleasure shooting up his spine and frying his brain.The plug continuously battered his overworked prostate and it was getting harder for Harry to keep him from drifting off into that lovely floaty space where only sensation was real and everything else a hazy blur he couldn't be arsed to care about.
And Harry could see the understanding dawn on Draco’s face as his eyes widened and his mouth fell open on a small groan.
“Nooo...Harry…please…”
When Harry finally pushed his plate away with what sounded like a deafening screech in the silence of the kitchen, Draco almost jumped out of his chair. Harry loved the fact he could reduce Draco to such a state with just some well timed movements and a steady build up of anticipation. This was not the start of their game. It had already begun the moment Draco had opened his eyes this morning.
Draco scrambled into position, and Harry was happy to note it was not as graceful this time.
“And every fourth strike you will pump that plug once.”
“Yes Harry" he moaned, suffering through the molten heat that was coursing in his guts.
Eyes still trained on Draco’s face so as to not miss a single expression, he waved his hand at the bag and the solution started flowing through the tube and into Draco’s ass. At first Draco only let out a little squeak at the sensation of fluid filling his intestines, but it didn't take long for the first signs of discomfort to start showing. And the pain as the Castile soap solution irritated his sensitive insides and the cramping started.
And Harry knew it hurt. The cramps would be murder this time and after having gone through this twice already his abdominal muscles and intestines would be overworked and oversensitive. That was the whole point.
“Oh Merlin Harry !” Draco keened as the burn started afresh. Harry could see his legs tremble from the effort of holding his position. He was such a good little pet. He made sure to tell Draco that.
One look at Draco and Harry almost came in his own pants. Draco looked wrecked. His eyes had watered, just barely keeping the moisture from spilling over his flushed cheeks. His lips were pressed into an unforgiving tight line, working hard to keep away the other noises that were beating at them to get out and be heard. His hands were fisted into the tablecloth and Harry craved.
“Perfect. Then get up and get dressed. We are going out.”
“That was well done, pet. Such a good cockslut.”
Before Draco had a chance to fully grasp the instructions, Harry pumped once and simultaneously pushed Draco into his seat.
“You took it so well love...all twenty strikes...so beautiful my pet…”
He followed it up with three quick strikes alternating between the left and right cheek, giving Draco just enough time to feel each impact before overwhelming him with the next.
“Up on your hands and knees pet.” He ordered.
“Eight..een…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“When we get home, I want to shove my fist in your hole and make you cum screaming. Do you want that pet?” Harry whispered seductively in his ear.
The second enema was practically anti-climactic as compared to the first one. That was not to say that Draco did not suffer through it. The castile soap had done its job of making sure his insides were so irritated that even plain water was torture. So Harry made him hold it for longer, just to keep things interesting. And when he was satisfied with the intensity of the tremors that ran up and down Draco’s limbs even as he tried his best to follow Harry’s orders, he let him go and relieve himself .
“You have been very good, pet. Good pets get rewards. Do you want a reward?”
“Draco, are you with me pet?”
“I love you too Harry.” he whispered, the words failing epically to actually encompass what he felt.
“On your elbows, forehead touching the floor.” He ordered
Harry watched as Draco fell to the floor and crawled as quickly as possible, hoping perhaps to be put out of his misery, or maybe not. He pondered over this dilemma of the masochist as he languidly stroked his cock that had been hard since they sat at the restaurant.
“Red to stop, Yellow to slow and Green to continue.” Draco recited diligently.
“Do you want to come, or do you want me to fuck you ?”
Draco just lay there and took it, body trembling continuously, resigned to whatever Harry decided to give him.
Harry pushed two fingers inside while Draco tried to muffle his gasp. Draco was on fire, the ginger oil coating his sensitive inner skin continuing its assault. “Does it still burn, pet?" He still wanted to hear it from Draco.
Covering Draco's white knuckled fists with his own broad brown palms, he leaned forward and waited till Draco made eye contact before he spoke.
Harry threaded his hands through the shiny blond hair that was by then damp with sweat and pulled his head back just before Draco was able to get his favourite treat .
“We are not even halfway through my plans for you, pet.” He watched Draco, documenting his reaction to that statement. Draco just licked his lips and kept his eyes somewhere in the vicinity of Harry’s chest.
The walk to Angelo’s, usually a short five minute stroll, must have felt like a marathon to Draco in his current state, Harry wagered. And going from the cloudy look in his eyes and his miserable attempts at keeping up a conversation, Harry could also safely assume he wasn't entirely aware for most of it.
Harry leaned back in his seat, smiling goofily as if he hadn't just left Draco’s beating heart bared for the world’s viewing pleasure on the white tablecloth between them.
“Fuck Draco ...that’s it… such a good mouth on you pet.”
“Come here pet” He said, watching with hungry eyes as Draco crawled over to him. "Drink” He held the glass up to Draco’s lips and he gratefully gulped the whole thing down in record time.
Harry smirked. It was all standard punishment fare so far. Draco was accustomed to this. Time for some more surprises.
Now Harry took his time exploring his lover’s body. Starting with his swollen red lips. Harry often thought Draco kissed like each one was his last. Living with a sociopathic murdering megalomaniac in his house for over a year and surviving a war had given both of them a healthy appreciation for all the good things in life. But Draco had perhaps taken the lesson more closely to heart.
He summoned his toy box from where it was sitting next to the bed and picked out a violently purple vibrator with small bumps all over that was originally a gag gift from Ginny but soon grew to become a personal favorite when Harry saw the reaction it managed to get from Draco. Next he opened a smaller hidden compartment in the box and selected a small unmarked glass phial filled with an amber colored oil.
But then Draco’s cock leaked against his thigh when he bit down on the lip he had marked earlier and the moment was benched for later. Right now, he had a promise to fulfil.
Draco whined “Yes Harry, I have tried to be so good.”
Harry set a moderate pace for their little excursion, just enough for Draco to work at keeping up, making sure he felt every step.
With his hands busy exposing his still slack hole to Harry, Draco’s entire weight was supported by his shoulders and neck, a position that rapidly got uncomfortable under the best of circumstances.
“Yes love?”
It took a while, but Draco got it. Specially when Harry reached out and stuck two fingers inside the gaping hole in front of him.
“You can go to the bathroom as soon as you make me come.” he said and Draco’s eyes filled with hope. They both knew Draco could make Harry come embarrassingly fast when he wanted to. “But you should know, I had a nice long wank before breakfast.”
By the time they got home and closed the door behind them, Draco was a whimpering sobbing mess.
“Please what love? Do you want me to take it out? Are you using your safeword?”
“Color.”
It took Draco a few minutes to return. He was moving slower than usual already, a little more deliberately as if tipsy. Harry kept his eyes on Draco’s face as he crawled back and knelt next to the chair he was waiting in. His tipped his face up with a finger under his chin and asked “color”
“Yess Harry...I’m sssorry…” Draco slurred, mind starting to drift away again.
Harry nodded at him to continue. He watched every shade from agony to pleasure skid across Draco’s face as he rode that dildo, chasing his orgasm. Sweat bloomed over his whole body, hanging off the ends of his eyelashes for a few moments before plummeting to his flushed chest and sliding down to pool at his groin. He was debauchery come to life, unfettered desire unravelling on Harry’s ancient coffee table.
“...Three...Four…”
Draco’s hole gave in with just about as much resistance as Draco himself, after spending all day being stretched.
“Nggh…” Draco screwed his eyes shut, trying to answer the question honestly.
More whimpers filled the otherwise silent kitchen as Draco greedily sucked Harry’s thumb into his warm mouth.
Once again the sentence was left unfinished as Harry’s cock finally emptied itself into the depths of Draco’s ass with a vengeance.
And so it was that even with his mind half gone in pain and pleasure, Draco still seemed to surrender his soul through every lick of his tongue and every slide of his lips over Harry’s. For a little while Harry wanted to abandon the scene and just spend the day treasuring Draco like he deserved to be. It had taken Harry a long time to accept that his need to hurt Draco and watch him suffer was as much an expression of his love as his need to care for and protect him.
“No, still the same ones, same dose. He just really turned me on. Fucking hell!” Harry closed his eyes again and toke a deep breath, holding it for a bit before letting it out again slowly.
Harry nooded. “Yeah, I’m good. Thanks, mate.”
“Nah, I’m good,” Ron answered, raising his still half full glass of sparkling water. “In fact, I am going to grab Hermine and go say hello to your new hot stuff. Go cool down somewhere.” Chuckling he turned from Harry and started walking towards his wife.
“Fine, ok. Yes, he fits my type. I need a fucking drink.” Harry pushed his hands through his hair. “You want something too?” He asked, glancing at Ron.
“Um yeah… sorry. Not really though. You do look hot!” Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Ok, now that I made a complete arse of myself, let’s try this again.” He held out his hand to Malfoy. “Malfoy, it’s good to see you.” Malfoy grasped Harry’s hand in a firm grip, his amusement now apparent in his face. His slightly crooked grin revealed perfectly white, straight teeth.
“Shit, Potter,” Draco’s amusement was crystal clear in his voice and his smirk. “Imagine the fun we could have had in school if I had even an inking that you where into men. If it is so easy to get you all hot and bothered now, I have no idea how you even managed to survive being a teenager.”
Theo smiled. “Feel free.”
“No idea mate, but you looked about ready to fuck him right on this table. That is crass, even for you.”
“Hmpf,” Harry muttered and tried to untangle himself from Susan. “But they have cookies.”
“Come on then,” Ron said, clapping a hand on Harry’s shoulder and getting up. “Let’s go talk to some people that don’t drive you into a frenzy.”
“Aww guys, don’t be mean!” Harry wined. “I am sure you all prefer that to moody, grumpy 17-year old me!”
Harry was just in the midst of trying to explain his non-existing love triangle with Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood (the press just loved inventing stuff when they saw things they didn’t understand and Harry kind of let them, because it was amusing and kept them occupied) to Theodore Nott (who now owned a muggle farm in New Zealand, imagine that!) and Lisa Turpin (who Harry knew now was teaching Charms at Hogwarts), when Susan walked past them.
“There is one last thing left. I promised you something at the restaurant earlier. Remember?”
The blows continued raining down unforgivingly on Draco’s battered ass and thighs. His sobs had turned into wails somewhere around the fourth pump and Harry had to bite his own lips raw to keep in the moans that threatened to burst from his throat
Draco stopped all motion for a second and looked directly at Harry. “Green”
“Good boy”
Holding his head still with his hands in his hair, Harry simply shoved his cock straight down Draco’s throat without giving him any warning. He had been too hard for too long for it to be any other way.
Draco knew what Harry was actually asking. And he knew one word from him and Harry would bundle him up and lavish him with all the love and care he could dream of and then some.
“Have to take it out before you can fuck yourself on your favorite dildo pet.”
“Spread your legs...Good...Now reach back and spread your cheeks.”
He took a minute to tuck himself back into his jeans, admiring Draco’s swollen red lips and spit soaked chin.
Thank you everyone who has read this so far! Here is the gift of even more smut from me to you :*
“G...gg...green...”
“Feeling better now?”
Draco got into position and fisted his hands in the bedsheets.
Harry took the purple dildo they had been using earlier and with a quick sticking charm had it placed at the edge of the coffee table behind Draco. He knew that Draco knew what was coming.
“Do you want to come, pet?” Harry asked, each word landing a puff of breath right at the purpling head of Draco’s cock.
Harry made sure to cover the plug in as much oil as he could, pouring some directly into Draco’s loose hole. The fresh burn eliciting a low groan from him. The plug slid in without much resistance, Harry noted with satisfaction. He pumped it till Draco started to tremble, then pumped some more.
When he finally reentered the kitchen, Draco was kneeling by the chair, his back to Harry. Harry took a moment to make his presence known but did not approach Draco, enjoying the sudden tightness in Draco's shoulders, the barely perceptible quickening of his breath.
“G...green Harry.” he said, sealing his own fate.
“Please what pet? Use your words.”
“No Harry I do not want a play by play of the scene.” He paused. Another flush crept up his face .”I like it when you surprise me.”
“Nooooo… Harry … Harry...please…” Draco wailed as the pain started in earnest.
“No Harry” was all he said as he took a trembling step forward and nearly keened before he shoved his fist in his mouth to muffle it. Then another step, and another till he was next to Harry, reaching out to grab the hand he held out like it was the only life preserver for his sinking body.
Draco could only groan louder and thrust faster against Harry's relentless fingers in response. Harry knew Draco loved it when he talked dirty to him. He captured his lips in another bruising kiss as he grabbed the base of the plug and pulled hard, tasting the scream that burst out of his lover. He let it go and watched as Draco’s hole swallowed it back inside like the first meal of a starving man.
Harry rolled over to his side and played with and petted Draco’s hair as he continued to endure the burning in his rectum along with the rough scraping at his tender insides from the textured dildo. Since he had no plans of making this easy for his pet, another flick of his wrist caused the thrusting from the dildo to become erratic. Slow and shallow followed by deep and hard and everything in between. And when Draco’s cries became too loud and the tears came too freely, he crooned softly into his ears “I'm here pet. It's ok.”
This time the pump happened faster and Harry made sure to praise Draco for it. “That’s it, you are doing so well love. Is the plug filling your hungry hole nicely?”
“Here” he looped the tube between Draco’s legs, careful to avoid any contact with his still semi-erect cock. “Hold this”
The look Draco sent his way would have gotten him a fresh thrashing on any other occasion but Harry had to concede it was a remarkably loaded question given the situation. So he settled for a single swat on the most purple part of Draco’s color wheel ass. The resultant sound from his bratty boyfriend was a confused mix of pain and lust, something his brain was valiantly trying to sort and failing.
“Oh pet you should see how gorgeous you look right now.” Harry breathed. Draco’s hole was gaping, trying fruitlessly to clench around the plug that had been there for so long. Harry dipped two fingers inside, ignoring Draco’s moans. The skin was burning, the ginger oil and the constant stimulation having made it inflamed and oversensitive. Harry knew riding that dildo was going to be truly painful.
“Please Harry...I need... Please..”
“There you go pet. A hard cock to fill that ever needy slutty hole of yours. You can ride it and come as much as you want. I will sit here and watch you, so you better put on a good show.”
Harry rubbed soothing circles on his stomach to help distribute the solution.
Harry had just finished setting the breakfast at the table when Draco appeared in the doorway. And just like it had 5 years ago when they had started, Harry’s body still tightened deliciously at the gloriousness that was a naked Draco Malfoy. Every pale sinewy inch of that body held the appeal of a blank canvas for the artist in Harry. He wanted to spend the rest of life worshipping at the altar of his lover’s beauty and grace. And when Draco added the gift of his submission to the mix, as he had now, with his head slightly bent, his shoulders pulled back and his hands behind his back, it was all Harry could do to not fall to his knees and lick his way up from the soles of Draco's feet to that sensitive place behind his ear that never failed to elicit a delicate shiver. He gave himself a moment to relive the time he had done exactly that, but just a moment. Right now, his pet was waiting for him to pull himself together and take them on the glorious journey he had promised.
“Harry ..what …”
“Harry please...please...I need...please...” He wailed as Harry licked all around his belly button and the copious amounts of precome he has slathered all over there without once touching the poor boy’s cock. It was so flushed and hard Harry was sure he would come if he so much as breathed over it. But Draco knew better than to come without permission, so he did just that.
The tears brimming in Draco’s eyes had started steadily falling over now, too overwhelmed with everything he was feeling right then for him to exercise any control over his response, not that Harry let him have any such control when they played anyway. He wrenched every feeling from Draco as if he owned them and Draco couldn't dare to withhold what belonged to Harry.
“One Harry! Thank you for the punishment.”
Draco continued to look at the plate in front of him while he eagerly shook his head “No questions or concerns Harry.”
Draco was struggling with the shame, Harry could see it in his eyes. But he waited.
“Perfect pet. So good for me.” Draco blushed and Harry couldn't help but laugh at the lovely reaction his praise elicited from Draco that his dick up his ass couldn't. So he kissed him again, quick and hard.
