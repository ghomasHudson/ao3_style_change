“Don’t worry about it,” I say, even as I know you will, no matter what I say. You’ve always been a proud man, and to suddenly become so dependent on another person’s benevolence will surely take some getting used to. “Now let’s get you into bed. Do you want me to fetch you a sleeping draught?” You nod silently and follow me towards the spare room. “Good. You’ll need all the sleep you can get; I reckon we have a lot to do tomorrow.”
PS I’m rather sure you’re wrong about your biography, but if you insist, have it your way. Of course it’d only be madness to consider trying to thaw the public’s opinion of you. Whatever was I thinking, suggesting something so utterly ridiculous?
You see, my mother always used to say two things: “Whatever happens, we’ll always have Florence” — a phrase she often used to console me when it felt like the walls were closing in on me and life grew darker than I ever thought possible — and, “Life doesn’t always turn out the way we plan.”
Draco drew in a sharp breath. “You’re saying you thought about giving a hundred-year-old a lap dance? In the middle of Diagon Alley? In front of dozens of innocent children?” His attempt to look appalled was completely ruined by the mirth dancing in his eyes. “Oh my, Potter, you
“Sure.” Malfoy turns to face him fully and Harry readily mirrors the action, ignoring the town far below. “Take a place like this, for example; the London Eye. Thirty minutes trapped in a limited space is a surefire way to kill the buzz if you suddenly find yourselves with nothing to talk about. So, if you haven’t met before, always make sure to provide the possibility for either of you to retreat, if only to the loos, should the need arise.”
Draco does lean in and Harry’s stomach swoops, his lips tingling as Draco’s hot breath ghosts over his skin.
. Draco’s stomach churned. What if the Dark Lord was back from his mission already and Bellatrix had proposed her little Legilimency idea to him? What if—
A noise in the hallway caught his attention and he looked over, but there was nobody there. He was still alone. He sat back in the chair and tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling.
“No, you’re not.” Malfoy’s warm smile is like a soothing balm. “None of us are. We all have our quirks, our flaws and weaknesses; they’re what makes us precious and unique. No one would endure living with someone who is perfect in every way, it would only make you feel inadequate and even more of a failure. So be yourself. Hopefully, it will also encourage your date to do the same.”
“Coming here,” Draco offered, “where no one knew who I was, where my family name didn’t immediately inspire people to curse me six ways from Sunday, it… It was so fucking liberating, you know. Being able to be just anybody…”
Thank you for your offer, Malfoy, but I’m already painfully aware of my own inadequacy and in no need for you (or anyone else, for that matter) to point out my shortcomings at my every turn. Believe me, if there’s anything I know, it’s that I’m just as human as everyone else, and I do not doubt my ability to make mistakes. Just because most of the wizarding world seems to be perfectly all right with painting me off as an infallible saint these days, it’s not something I approve of, and certainly not an image I’ll ever be able to identify with.
He felt so…included, he supposed was the word for it. For the first time in a long time, he felt like he was part of a family.
“Shit.” He’d heard of people who’d travelled through time before, but from what he’d heard, there were restrictions, limitations, regulations. Five hours, he’d read somewhere. And here was this man, who, if he really was the person he claimed to be, must have travelled not hours, but years. If not decades.
“Pans, nobody has been there to feed it for days. I have to go.” He jumped up, making Smaug yip and saunter off to his room while Draco gathered Charlie’s things back into the bag. He bit his lip, only hesitating for a brief moment before he grabbed the man’s keys and slipped them into his pocket.
Draco knew it was his charm, rather than his excellent barista skills, that had earned him the customer votes for the Employee of the Month award five times in a row now.
Heart pounding, Draco turned that last corner and finally caught sight of the door he’d been heading for. He was teetering on the verge of a mental breakdown already, and there was only one person he could trust to talk him through it. Circe, how had his life come to this? Sixteen years old, all prospects of a bright future thoroughly squashed, his only remaining friend: a fucking ghost.
don’t want this, my magic will let go and eventually find someone else with whom I’ll be compatible. So if you’re doing this out of pity, or if you feel like it’s an obligation, please don’t.”
“It’s good to be back,” Charlie agreed, then looked around the room. “Are you all sure I have amnesia? I don’t feel like I do.”
Draco gulped, hoping Harry didn’t detect the shiver running down his spine at Harry’s words. Because that’s what this was; Draco could attest to both the yearning and the feelings. And Merlin, the bodies, too. Harry’s body pressed tight against him, warm and solid and perfect. His own, tingling and needing and wanting. His own, that was starting to show inappropriate interest in the current situation, blood rushing south in preparation for—
The sound of Draco’s footsteps in the hallway sends Harry’s heart racing, his body still taut and thrumming from the vision of water droplets running down Draco’s bare skin, seeking out every dip and curve of his smooth…
“Yeah. A good friend,” Harry finally said. “And soon, a good brother too, huh? You and Charlie do make a beautiful couple.”
“Ah, hmm…” Charlie looked embarrassed. “About that. It’s not really her fault; I know she hates the smell of whisky, and I may have had a bit to drink before I went over to check on her in the paddock.”
A low whine on the pillow beside him drew his attention to Smaug, the fox’s ears twitching in his sleep. Draco ran his hand across the animal’s scruffy paws, playing with the tufts of fur sticking out from between the pads. Smaug opened one sleepy eye and let out a loud sniff.
“I’m glad she did,” Harry said, shuffling to mirror Draco’s position. “In fact, no matter how hard I tried, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you ever since you left.”
“Accio Weasley!” he yelled, putting as much power into the spell as he could muster. Charlie flew towards where Draco stood by the edge of the wards, and Draco braced himself for both the impact of Charlie’s body and the incoming fire from the dragon.
Draco sighed unhappily but let him go, though not before stealing one final fleeting kiss. Harry already had the door open and one foot on the landing when he stopped, struck by a sudden thought.
“So, what do you say?” Harry’s mouth quirked into a playful smile. “Ready to leave the past in the past?”
Draco met her gaze and realised he knew her somehow. Hufflepuff, his sluggish brain managed to supply. He dropped his eyes to her name tag. “Hannah Abbott,” he muttered. “Hufflepuff.”
Unable to hold himself up any longer, Draco lowered his body to cover Harry’s, chest to chest, stomach to stomach, hips to hips — throbbing erection to—
“There you go.” Draco slid the two mugs of coffee across the counter, studiously keeping his gaze from flicking towards the man watching him from the corner table. “Anything else?”
Slyvia’s heels clicked across Draco’s ceiling. She was clearly getting ready to go out, making all the noises Draco expected to hear before a night on the town. For some reason, it only made his own lonely Friday evening seem stranger.
you and Theo? I thought you said you weren’t one to kiss and tell, and then suddenly you just… I don’t know. I’ve been considering your intriguing revelations this entire week and I’m still not sure if you’re joking or not. Somehow, this all feels like too much of a coincidence to be true. I guess I’ll just have to ask them next time I see them, which will probably be next Saturday when we’re helping Ron and Hermione move into their new place.
But then Hermione put me in charge of assembling muggle furniture together with her parents and Dean, and somewhere among all those screws and plugs and patronising cartoon instructions, I lost track of time. So, when the official-looking owl swooped in through the open front door and landed right next to me, I was just as surprised as everyone else. I guess a Saturday Ministry owl would seem rather ominous for most people, so it’s not like I can really blame them for taking notice of the delivery and starting to ask questions. Since I knew it was yours, I pocketed the letter without a second glance, assuring them everything was fine, but some — aka Hermione — refused to let it go, nagging me to open it. ‘It might be important, Harry,’ and, ‘How can you know without reading it?’
Draco leans in, the tip of his nose grazing the shell of Harry’s ear as he adds, whispering, “Always will be.”
And speaking of the people surrounding me, I get why the photo I sent made you assume I’ve told them about
“I know.” Draco’s voice is so soft and gentle, comforting Harry’s aching heart like a plush security blanket.
nocturne. (See, I can’t seem to stop calling it that. Maybe you should take it as a hint to write some lyrics to it one of these days?)
“Slyvia,” Draco greeted as he’d opened the door, realising he was genuinely glad to see her today. Not that he wasn’t ever, but she had a tendency to stop by at the most inconvenient moments. She wasn’t dressed to the nines for a change, but simply wore a plain cotton blouse and a pair of long, loose-fitting trousers that flared around her ankles. She’d left her wig in her flat and her bald head only accentuated her beautiful cheekbones and elegant makeup.
Potter hummed, sounding unconvinced as he seemed to be thinking over what Molly had just told him. Draco’s heart hammered in his chest as he waited for the man’s reply.
Harry’s eyes flashed. “And what do you know about my family? Spending a week with them does not make you an expert.”
“Come on,” Draco continues. “Not all relationships end in heartbreak and you know it. And even if there’s no guarantee, who says the prospect of finding your special someone wouldn’t be worth the risk?”
He wanted this. He wanted love; he wanted companionship; he wanted a family. And if the person he wanted it with didn’t want him back, then why shouldn’t he choose someone who
Yeah, I already know what you’re going to say; that I should just man up and start acting like a responsible adult, right? And that if you’ve been able to go through the manor and fix it all up, I should be able to do the same with my shit. I know. I really should. And I guess I’ll just have to do it at some point, but right now I prefer to just hang around here, play quidditch with the others in the back garden, help Arthur with his muggle research, and let Molly feed me to her heart’s content.
“It's just,” Harry started, shoving his hands into his pockets and hunching his shoulders, “George said— And then the whole apple-and-cheese thing, I—”
Instead, I fetch the potion from the bathroom and bid you goodnight, keeping the walls from falling down.
“You will not,” Molly interrupted, shooting a scathing look around the room before her eyes landed on her oldest son. “Bill, you’re his brother. He’d be least embarrassed with you.”
“Draco!” Charlie called, sounding inordinately pleased to see someone he barely knew. Though he did think they were engaged, so there was that. “Come, sit. Let’s talk.”
Draco went for the door, his left hand sliding into his pocket on its own accord, clutching the silver coin with trembling fingers.
Firstly, the man would either attack him on the spot or turn him in. To the Ministry or the Prophet, Draco honestly wasn’t sure which one would be worse. Not that he was a runaway of any sort — he had served his sentence obligingly before he walked away — but you could never be sure with this man, could never know for certain he wouldn’t want to slice you up if he ever happened to walk in on you unexpectedly.
“I’ll see you tomorrow. The Ministry. Eleven o’clock.” He turned and left Pansy stewing. He had too much to do.
Where his younger self would go into instant counter-attack mode, this Potter stayed calm and centred, as if Draco’s outburst hadn’t affected him in the least. Somehow, this fact managed to rattle Draco more than any offensive move ever would. Draco knew how to handle the hotheaded teenager. His composed older counterpart? Not so much.
PPS Thank Merlin you’re over Theo. I wouldn’t have wanted to come between the two of you if you weren’t. Now I only have to figure out who the secret love of your life is, so I don’t accidentally kiss him too. I’m sure you’d never forgive me if I did.
With the fox ignoring him, Draco gave up the conversation and got up, stretching his aching muscles. His own reflection stared back at him from the mirror as he stepped into his slippers, and he groaned at the sight of his too-long hair all mussed and untidy as it always was after a night of tossing and turning. “I really should find the time to get that haircut,” he muttered. He still hadn’t come to peace with the fact that he’d had to cancel his latest appointment with Mr Wickerton on such short notice, but Pansy and her orphanage had needed him, so it wasn’t like he’d had much choice.
Harry chews his food absent-mindedly, recalling the sight of Draco halfway up that climbing wall not even an hour before. His lithe body must have been made for climbing, all long and lean and pure muscle.
Yeah, your aunts are quite alike, aren’t they? I can’t really blame you for doing a double-take at seeing Andromeda, I did too, the first time I met her. Apart from their looks, though, they really don’t have anything in common except being your mother’s sisters. Andromeda is really sweet, and I still don’t know how she manages to hold herself together what with losing both husband, daughter, and son-in-law in the span of a few months. I guess her secret must have something to do with your cousin Teddy. Yes, he’s indeed a handful, but an adorable one, and being with him does put the past in perspective. He’s a metamorphmagus like his mum so his hair changes all the time. The turquoise is just for when he’s feeling antsy. I guess he wasn’t all that pleased to be told to sit still for the photo.
“Don’t be.” Draco’s silver-grey eyes returned to him, sparkling like tinsel in the light from the crackling fire. “I know I had a privileged childhood, and I’m not complaining. I’m just… It would’ve been nice, you know, to have experienced that…”
“Hi, Draco,” he said eventually, his voice soft and tender. “Thank you for the compliment, though I’m not sure beautiful is the right word. I can’t say I’ve had the chance to check on the veracity of the angel-enchanting arse, but given the situation, I really think it’s best that we
As for me, although it pains me to say it, you’re probably right; I could probably get any job I’d want, regardless of how I do on my N.E.W.T.s. But that’s just another part of why I hate this ridiculous fame. I don’t want to get ahead thanks to something like that, and I certainly don’t want someone else to have their dreams go up in smoke just because we wanted to do the same thing and my fame was favoured over their talent or hard-earned N.E.W.T.s scores. I want to earn my place like everyone else, for my knowledge, my skills. How else would I ever be able to keep my self-respect, not to mention gaining any respect or trust from future co-workers or subordinates?
Harry moved with him, meeting Draco’s thrusts as good as he could, rubbing his leaking cock against Draco’s undulating abs. With Draco’s hands firmly planted on the mattress, holding him up, Harry finally got a chance to explore Draco’s body the way he himself had been explored, caressing his smooth skin, pinching his dark hardened nipples, running his hands over any and all parts of Draco he could reach.
It had been three days since his disastrous wedding. Three days of no Floo calls, no letters, no drop-ins from the Weasleys. He’d started to wonder if he’d ever hear from them again, and if he were honest with himself — which he probably should be, shouldn’t he? — the thought terrified him.
Harry opened his mouth. Closed it. Swallowed. Then, “Draco Malfoy, would you allow me to study the muscles of your body?”
Draco shrugged. “Well, yes. I mean, it’d be nice to have some peace and quiet for me too, but I like my flat well enough. But he’s my family now. He deserves to be happy too.”
Harry leaned in and gave Draco a slight hug, of the friendly variety. It was not at all what Draco wanted, but…it was Harry, and therefore more than he had any right to ask for.
When his message came through, Draco noticed a slight tensing of shoulders but little else. The bloke — no, Draco still couldn’t bring himself to call him by his name — kept talking to his friend, only briefly glancing down at the phone in his hand once she turned to look something up in one of the textbooks. A covert smile transformed his already striking features, making it impossible for Draco to tear his eyes away from the sight as the bloke started tapping out a reply without ever looking up to meet Draco’s gaze. Only when Draco’s phone vibrated in his hand did he come to his senses and resume his breathing.
The fire died and Draco turned to Harry. “Guess we need to finish up here, then. I’ll come back tomorrow to do the bedroom, I suppose.”
"I think so. It'll keep you close to Hogwarts if you decide to take McGonagall up on her offer for the teaching assistant job, and if not, it'll still be easy access to London or wherever. And if I take the Potions apprenticeship with Jacoby in Glasgow, it'll be convenient."
No, Potter had played him, all right. And he’d done it so convincingly too, all sweet smiles and twinkling eyes. Hell, that kiss on the forehead still burned hot on Draco’s skin more often than not. He still hadn’t figured out Potter’s reasons for the visit, what difference it could possibly have made in the grand scheme of things. If it hadn’t been just for kicks, of course? Just another way of taunting him and making his life miserable. Which, Draco admitted, certainly could’ve been the case. Dangling that tempting vision in front of Draco, leading his naive mind to believe in things too good to be true, making it wish for things that could never be.
You may be a poncy git, M, but you know what? Even poncy gits should have the right to be happpy. (Well, as long as their happiness isn’t depending on someone else’s misery, that is.) Who knows, maybe a
… The words had tumbled out of his mouth unauthorised, and as soon as they registered in his brain, he felt the blush rising on his cheeks.
“I— Yeah.” The girl frowned as she perused the display of baked goods. “Any recommendations? I…” She hesitated, then seemed to come to a decision. Turning back to Draco, she murmured, “She told me to surprise her…”
Harry laughs, shaking his head as he returns his attention to his Potions book. Their N.E.W.T. exams begin in only another week and drawing Draco's attention away tonight is already going to be difficult as it is. Better not add Harry's not completing his revising to the list of reasons Draco might try to refuse.
Draco scowled. “No. My favourite belt, the blighter. You’re right, though; he shouldn’t be kept in a flat. I’ve been considering buying a house in the countryside with a large plot of land so he could run when he wants to without worrying about cars and such.”
The smell out there, with owl droppings, pellets, and feathers littering the floor, was usually enough to deter anyone from staying longer than necessary. But Malfoy didn’t seem to notice. He just stood there by the open window, lost in thought, looking out over the fiery autumn colours of the Forbidden Forest. Harry approached with caution, unwilling to interrupt whatever thoughts were running through the boy’s head, but Malfoy turned his gaze towards him, and the look in his eyes was one of longing. Harry remembers himself thinking the boy must really wish he could escape this place and fly far away.
He’d never once wished for that before. Even after he started to really enjoy his time in the Scottish school, he had always looked forward to coming home to Wiltshire every chance he got. And he still had a hard time imagining spending the holidays at Hogwarts, or anywhere else for that matter, but after what happened on Christmas Eve…
Okay. It actually took Ron almost a week before he finally spilt his guts, and no, you twat, he didn’t want to ask me out on a date. He and his girlfriend are very much in love, and although I’m truly happy for them, I was perfectly fine with remaining clueless about what they get up to behind the bed curtains. You, my depraved friend, are a cruel, cruel wizard for alerting me to the existence of their sex life; I really didn’t need that in my mind. And for the record, I’m rather sure hell will freeze over before Ron admits to the Cannons being anything but the next league champions.
Draco sighed and walked the sculpture over to a waiting pedestal before casting a protection charm on it. Even now, he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the fascinating piece. He nearly got lost in the colourful swirls as he tried to put words to his thoughts. “Confusing. They’re all so fucking wonderful, you know? And Harry was being a prick, but not really a prick because he was accusing me of making it up, and it’s not like he was wrong about that, and now he wants to be my friend, and I— I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to disappoint him.”
“Because…” Harry swallows, this throat already tightening from the truth in his next words. “Because you can’t possibly want this, Draco. Not the way I do.”
“Potter? You in?” Harry looked up to see Zabini towering over him, hands on hips, with a challenging glint in his eye.
This time, though, Draco’s momentary awareness of Charlie Weasley was immediately overtaken by the immense fireball that landed in the same spot only a second later.
Anyway, enough about my weird friends. Let’s talk about yours instead. As I’ve understood it, Tracy Davies and the Greengrasses are at Beauxbatons this year. I don’t know if the transfer was by own choice or if their parents made it for them, as the Patils did, but I’ve overheard Parkinson talking about them with Bulstrode so I assume she’s still in contact with them, at least.
"You like that?" Draco asks with a satisfied smirk. "You like it when I hit your prostate, huh? Merlin, you look so amazing like this, falling apart so beautifully for me."
“I love you too, Draco.” He lifts his spoon and points it at mine. “Now, let’s eat this supposed delicacy before it all turns into soup.”
“Then we’ll have to believe it’s going to be okay. I’ll stay close by and get you out if you need it. Deal?”
No, muggles in general aren’t cold-hearted, towards their own blood or otherwise. But I guess all societies have their rotten eggs, just as some pure-blood families find it fit to disown one of their own for something as innocent as falling in love with a muggle-born…
“Oh, you…” The rest of the sentence fled Draco’s mind as Harry’s hands crept up his torso, his touch as frustratingly feather-light as before.
They still lived in Muggle London, far away from the wizarding world’s probing eyes, and even if they socialised with their old wix friends more often these days, they seldom ventured into any public spaces if they could help it. They still valued their anonymity too much to expose themselves to the inevitable assault on their privacy.
Merlin, he loved his job sometimes. A compliment to this witch on her taste in jewellery, and didn’t she see this amazing piece up for auction that just screamed her name? It’s one of a kind and is sure to be one of the more popular pieces tonight. And then a challenge to this wizard over here, covertly suggesting true artistic taste could see value in up-and-coming-artists aeons before their names were renowned. Draco watched that man add bids to three different paintings not long after their brief conversation.
Harry nods, repeating Draco’s words silently to himself. Interest, listen, questions, eye contact… He doesn’t have any problem doing any of those things whenever he’s with Draco. The man is like a bloody attention magnet, drawing people’s eyes from across the room whenever he opens his mouth. Or just exists, really.
“Ha! As if you never did the same when you were that age. I bet you wished for a Welsh Green every year from the time you could talk.”
“He should’ve been, but he got stuck in New York. He was working out an issue with a new distributor for the Wheezes, but there were weather delays and he couldn’t fly out. Harry doesn’t do well with Portkeys, and international ones make him sick for days, so he had to wait until the airports reopened. He’s supposed to be back by tomorrow. He’s promised to have the next week off to celebrate with us.”
“Oh, Harry,” he murmured, feeling his throat tightening around the words. Inside the globe was a familiar domed cathedral with an old, terracotta-coloured roof. The globe was filled with water, and as the water moved, small, floating flowers of purple wisteria cascaded around the Florentine cathedral. He could almost smell the Mediterranian sun washing over him. “The Duomo.” Draco looked up, tears blurring his eyes, but he didn’t care. “W-where did you get this?”
Draco shuddered at the memory of the Dark Lord barging in on their quiet evening, outraged by something (Draco still didn’t know what), throwing Bombardas in every direction until the room and everything in it had been transformed into nothing but shards and splinters and rubble. The house-elves had later been able to restore it to its former glory, thank the stars, but the memory remained. A dull ache of dread buried deep in Draco’s core.
“Uh, I think I have to object too.” Harry’s voice rang clear through the silent room, and Draco’s eyes shot up. Harry met his gaze with a pleading look, his brows drawn and lips tight.
The next time he saw Draco Malfoy, they were on the Hogwarts Express, two of the many eighth-year students ready to return to Scotland for a second chance to finish their education. Draco was one of only three Slytherins returning from their year, Blaise Zabini and Tracey Davis both close by his side. Over the next few weeks, the trio was never seen apart, banding together for support, safety or solidarity. Harry wasn’t sure what, but if he’d felt curious about Malfoy, if he had wanted to talk to him alone for Merlin knows what reason, he couldn’t.
Draco waggled his old-man eyebrows and Harry smiled, feeling some of the pent-up tension subside. He was still unable to grasp quite what was happening between them, but if this was real, if they were actually on the brink of what he thought they were, Harry wanted to savour it.
“Fine, be that way,” Draco said, annoyed at the whine in his voice. He didn’t need the silly little fox to sleep next to him anyway, even if the soft breathing did help to calm his anxiety. He could sleep perfectly fine alone.
When Harry woke up the next morning, it was to the sound of Teddy’s feet hurrying across the landing just outside his bedroom door.
Blood boiling, it took all Draco had to tamper his instinctual urge to lunge at the man. The fury must have shown on his face, though, because Potter had the good sense to lift his chin, alarm written all over his face.
Draco lifted the coin to take a better look at it. A regular silver Sickle, it seemed, only… instead of the usual dragon, there was the head of a man. And not any man either, but the man sitting next to him; Harry Potter, the grown-up version. Draco squinted to read the engraving underneath, not believing his eyes as he finally made out the date. Holy—
“Yes, I am.” He took a deep breath and stood. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish up everything I can for next weekend so you won’t need me much this week. We might not be taking a honeymoon right now, but I’d like to take a few days off with my new husband.”
“No, Pans. I’m not going to wait around on the idea that Harry Potter, of all people, might come around and decide I’m worth his time. Charlie wants me, and I want what he has to offer: friendship, family, companionship.” He sighed and rubbed his eyes. “I’m so fucking tired of being alone, Pans.”
“Here you go.” He commended himself for not letting his gaze stray to the table in the corner where the raven-haired bloke was currently busy making himself at home. “Enjoy.”
Oh, and I can confirm the ink I told you about last time is indeed the Blacks. I brought it with me for Andromeda to inspect as I visited her and Teddy last weekend. (Yes, I had already thought to ask her about it before I got your letter. Great minds think alike, right?) She wasn’t interested in keeping it, though, so I guess it’s yours if you want it. Or if you’d rather Narcissa have it? Whichever you decide; I certainly have no use for it.
?” He stopped pretending and glared. “No shit. We’ve only been planning this thing for months. Honestly, just the fact that I’m still here and haven’t fucked off to some tropical island yet should be testament enough that I am giving this event the attention it deserves.”
Draco laughed as she sauntered off and he shut his door, wondering if he’d lost his mind. Before he could consider it too closely, though, another knock at the door interrupted him.
“Did you arrive with Draco?” Sirius asked, a tone to his voice that Draco couldn’t place, but that had Harry narrowing his eyes at his godfather.
He dropped a pile of files in front of her, the updated RSVP list and final bills from the florist and liquor supplier among them, and laid the invitation on top. There; it was done. He stepped away quickly, unable to bring himself to think too much about it. If he did, he might break down again.
“You know what?” He stalked back to her and leaned over her desk, pointing back at the invitation. “I can. His family is wonderful, he’s attractive, and now he’s asked me to marry him. So yes, I
“How about you?” Draco says, breaking off Harry’s train of thought. “Shouldn’t you be out there searching for your special someone?”
“How do you know?” When Harry doesn’t answer, Draco nudges his shoulder again. “Have you ever talked to them about it?”
When the animal didn’t come running, Draco stuck his head around the doorframe, spotting the russet pile of fur still curled up on the bed. The knocking came again, and Draco turned his attention to the living room instead, where a handsome, long-eared owl stood on the windowsill, eyeing him impatiently. Draco rushed over to let the bird in.
The lift doors closed in front of them, leaving Draco and his cousin alone in the corridor. Draco stiffened, unsure what this was about.
. Scrambling for an effective defence, Harry huffs a strained laugh. “As if I’d ever tell you that.”
Harry smiled at Teddy’s polite “Thank you” and shook his head when the elf turned to offer him one as well.
And hadn’t that been the worst of it all, that intoxicating pride he’d seen in Potter’s eyes that night? Draco should’ve known it wasn’t real, that it was only pretend. Pride like that didn’t exist in the real world; Draco was aware of that now. He’d been searching for it his entire life, after all. Dreamt of being deemed worthy of it, by his father, his mother, his teachers, his teammates. Only Uncle Sev had ever come close, and even then, it had only been because he was better at Potions than his abysmal classmates, an accomplishment that really wasn’t much of a feat.
Draco still remembered those fateful weeks all too well, and the mere thought of them now made his stomach churn. He laid down his spoon next to his half-finished dessert and pushed the plate aside. The entire meal had been divine, but he couldn’t possibly eat another bite. Especially not anything as sickly sweet as Harry’s favoured treacle tart.
And Harry does, thinking trousers that snug really shouldn’t be allowed in a public place like this.
“You… like them?” Harry was disinclined to believe it. “I’ve always pictured you growing up with the most perfect of Christmases, everything posh and polished and not a hair out of place. This” — Harry gestured around the room — “must surely be far from what you’re used to.”
A minute later, he was wiping crumbs and coffee stains off the countertop when his phone buzzed again.
Harry’s stomach clenches and he gives in, finally allowing his body to rush the final few flights of stairs to the top of the tower.
Certain his presence wouldn’t be welcomed by either side, Draco stuck his coin-clutching fist in his pocket and steeled himself for the worst.
Lifting the sheet, Bill peeked underneath, then back at Draco. “Are they as enjoyable as I’ve heard?” he asked, amusement audible in his voice. Draco felt the flush rising on his cheeks, thankful that the man didn’t seem to expect an answer before dropping the sheet and continuing. “Can’t say that I’d have that done myself, but Draco’s right, and it looks relatively new. It’s all shiny and stuff.” He realised what he’d said and chuckled. “The piercing, that is.”
The soft rumble of Draco’s chuckle vibrates through Harry’s veins, making him hot all over. “Keep them,” he says, drawing back to look Harry in the eye. “I’ve already got exactly what I wanted.”
With his lips against Harry's nape and Harry straddling his lap, Draco slowly eases Harry back down onto his cock.
Charlie smiled. “I’ve had a lot of time to think over the last couple of days. I almost died out there because of a really stupid mistake; a selfish mistake. It’s made me step back and take stock of a few things, and I realised that I don’t really like who I’ve become.”
Blue eyes flitted to the corner and back, seemingly putting two and two together. “Ah, bummer.” He mock-pouted, his cheerful demeanour still dancing in his eyes as he studiously raked his gaze down Draco’s lithe frame. “Well, you can’t blame a guy for trying.”
Despite himself, Draco leaned in, curiosity piqued. The revolving rings, one inside the next; the small hourglass in the middle… Draco’s eyes widened. “Yes. It’s a…” He swallowed, mouth dry, heart racing. “…a time-turner.”
“Thanks,” you murmur distractedly, putting one foot in front of the other as I usher you into the living room with a gentle hand on the small of your back. I usually avoid touching you, afraid I wouldn’t be able to ever let go if I did, but your mind seems so far away that I’m unsure you even recognise where you are. I wonder how you got here; if you’ve been walking aimlessly through the streets of London until you eventually happened upon my building. But I don’t ask. Hopefully, you’ll tell me later, and until then, I’ll do whatever I can to make you feel safe and sound.
It was all so perfect. The food was delicious, the evening comfortable, and the rhythmic sound of the waves lulled them both into a sense of utter calm.
When they finally settled under the covers, Draco nestled Harry against his chest, wrapping an arm around his waist and pulling him close.
The sarcastic tone Harry knows so well feels oddly comforting — much more so than the earlier apologies had felt — and he gingerly sits up from his spot on the hard granite floor. Looking around, he realises Draco’s had the presence of mind to move him back into the letter room, so at least he hasn’t been lying in a mound of owl dung —
Thank Merlin you’re ‘still intact and fully functioning’. I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t. So, I take it we’re talking about ugly scars? If so, welcome to the club. I have more scars than I can count and believe me, the one on my forehead is not the ugliest one. So, if you think no one will ever want to look at you naked, the same goes for me too. Honestly, though, if someone loves you, they won’t care about the scars. They’re just superficial marks on your skin and they shouldn’t define you. And at least you’ve got a well-toned body going, don’t you, Adonis?
When Draco woke up, it was still dark. He’d nodded off on the sofa sometime late in the evening, only waking when Molly covered him with a hand-knitted blanket and insisted he’d sleep right there for the night. He’d been terribly tired after the intensive evening and, although embarrassed, he’d been quite comfortable right where he was and so agreed.
“Well, how could they not? I mean…” Draco’s hands outlined the red-clad curves of his bulging torso before they stopped, arms stretched out and fingers splayed at hip height. “…look at me.”
Heart filled to bursting with emotion, Draco tore his gaze from his boyfriend to look up at the little scrap of paper framed and mounted to the wall over the shiny-new espresso machine. The sight of Janie’s scribbles made him smile just as unerringly as it always did.
Harry groaned and ran a hand through his hair. “I never thought I’d say this to a Malfoy, but damn it, Draco, stop apologising. It’s fine.” He gave Draco a small smile and if Draco hadn’t known better, he would’ve thought it looked kind of shy. Which was ludicrous, because Harry Potter was
Harry can feel the heat rushing to his face at Draco's words, and he's glad his lover is behind him and that the room is nearly dark now the sun has dipped below the horizon.
closer. Closer to Draco. Confused, intrigued, and dizzy from a flood of emotions he cannot even begin to name, Harry takes several shaky steps towards the man.
Draco laughed. “Open book, I hope.” He turned and gestured to all the food. “This all looks and smells amazing. Please tell me you had help.”
And the boy’s current eagerness did help a lot with his anxiety. Harry couldn’t help but smile as he was dragged through the throng of people, guided towards the Main Square by a five-year-old with enough excitement in his tiny body to rival an entire Quidditch stadium during playoffs.
It wasn’t that Draco had anything against drag queens per se, even those nearly twenty years older than him like Slyvia. It was just, well, he preferred a different type. The type that worked with their hands, and maybe had a bit of a shadowed jaw, and without question, the type who wore less makeup than Draco did.
“Well, come on then.” Teddy tugged on Harry’s hand, already on the move again. “We have to hurry, or we’ll miss him!”
“Of course, once you know you’re compatible enough to keep a conversation going, or feel comfortable enough in one another’s company not to mind the occasional silence between the two of you, you’re free to choose any activity you’d think your date would enjoy.”
“All right, Malfoy,” Harry grits, against his better judgement. “I’m going to date the fuck out of you. Now, drink your poncy wine and I’ll pick you up tomorrow at noon.”
So yeah, my Valentine’s was really wicked. Just as pink-tinted and romantic as you’d expect it to be. Not. In fact — and I’m only telling you this to, again, prove how little you know me — I spent the day with Teddy over at Andromeda’s quarters.
been talking about him a lot lately, and I was just thinking that… What if the next time you run into him in the Owlery, instead of just wondering what he’s doing there, you ask him? Talk to him. He’s really rather pleasant these days. He and I have partnered several times in Ancient Runes, and I think he’d be open to—”
Luna throws a quick glance your way before returning her full attention to me. “Are you sure you’re not going to do anything about it?” she says, a concerned frown creasing her forehead. “It seems like you want to.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t have memories of my parents, only stories I’ve been told and phantom images in my dreams. I think if I did, if I had real memories, I would’ve liked to remember them when I’m missing them. Like a tribute of sorts. You know, to honour them.”
“Good.” Draco nodded, pushing his hands deep down into his trouser pockets. Harry was sorely tempted to call him out on his uncharacteristic behaviour but got distracted. The dark-grey fabric stretched intriguingly over Draco’s hips and his— “Well then…”
Arthur’s voice, usually so soft and playful, was direct and booming for once. “What in Godric’s name is going on?”
She let go and reached up with one hand to pat his cheek. “You’re such a good boy.” Draco swallowed, unsure what to say to that, but a commotion behind them saved him from coming up with something fitting. Molly’s eyes flicked to the Healer inviting them inside, then turned back to Draco with a smile. “Now come on, let’s go see Charlie.”
“So, um…” Harry busied himself with the files on his desk, unwilling to let Draco see the longing that must be radiating from his features. “Will I see you again? I mean, before…”
“Awake?” Draco started to turn back towards the lifts, unready to tackle the hurdle ahead, but she grabbed his arm.
Dropping his hand to his own leaking cock, he stroked it slowly as he looked into Draco's lust-blown eyes.
Harry and Draco were okay with that. It'd only been a year since the war, after all, and only a month since they'd returned from their final year at Hogwarts. Some things were bound to take time.
He stepped closer, and Harry jumped back with a grin. “No way, you jerk! You’re practically a married man, for Godric’s sake!”
Formal handshakes and polite conversation are usually more than I can handle on the best of days. Now imagine that, times a thousand, warped into overdrive, and taking place on the worst of days. After two weeks of no sleep. Merlin, it felt like every wix in Britain wanted to get ahold of me. In the end, my friends had to usher me out of there, ploughing through the frantic crowd of people who seemed to believe touching me would be their key to eternal salvation. Now, where was my wicked ex-death eater fan repellant when I needed him the most?
“Oh, right.” The amused huff came with an audible eye roll. “As if any man in history has ever managed to figure out the workings of a woman’s brain?”
The rumbling of Teddy’s sock-clad feet on the steps — how was it even possible for such a small kid to make so much noise? — came to an abrupt halt, and that’s when it came again.
.” Harry moans into Draco’s mouth; it feels so fucking good. So fucking perfect. Panting heavily, he glances down between them, intrigued by the sight of their equally raging erections moving against each other through obscenely tented trousers. “Oh fuck, Draco. I’m going to…”
Something had to change. And if Draco didn’t have the decency to stay away when he was supposed to, maybe Harry should be the one to create the necessary distance instead? Maybe that could be his New Year’s resolution or something; taking some time off work to travel the world? He’d miss Teddy something fierce, but maybe it’d be worth it? Just to gain a little perspective, to meet some new people, and… maybe even get laid? (Merlin knew he needed to get laid, what with him sitting here, in the presence of a child, lusting for a hundred-year-old.)
“Tell everybody what, Harry?” Draco snapped, spinning around. “That I’m pregnant? That Charlie’s somehow gotten me — a man — up the duff, and that I’m now expecting his child? Like, seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?”
Draco felt the heat rise on his cheeks as he cleared his throat and promptly turned towards the fireplace. “So, shall we take the Floo, then?”
Draco wanted to step back, hoping Charlie wasn’t about to confess something truly horrid, but before he could, Charlie reached out and took Draco’s hand.
“They’re amazing,” Draco said quietly. “You’re a true artist.” He recognised the amazement in his own voice and hoped Harry didn’t take offence.
Before Draco could have any response to that, even in his own head, a commotion at the door had him whipping around. Hannah Abbott had sunk to the floor, her mouth open in shock as she’d evidently been listening in on the conversation.
PS Well, at least you have a pale natural skin colour for your scars to blend in with. Imagine what they would look like on me. One day out in the sun and they’d be shining like fucking beacons in the dark. You know what the scars on my hand look like, right?
The man walked over to sit on the edge of the bed, bending one leg up on the mattress to be able to face Draco fully. Without drawing his wand, he motioned with his hand, increasing the light in Draco’s orb as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
She threw her head back and laughed. “Oh, Harry. I certainly had a choice, and so did Bill. We, either of us, could have walked away at any time and the tether would have snapped. But we were both attracted to the other, and enjoyed each other, so we came to love one another. He is my mate, but if either of us had chosen otherwise, the bond would have dissipated and started looking for someone else.”
And he and Kreacher (the house-elf you seem to remember) hated each other too. With a passion. I can’t help cringing thinking about it after what you told me about him being connected to the house’s magic. If it’s true, it’s no wonder Sirius didn’t like staying here if the house decided to take the elf’s side in that conflict. Kreacher is at Hogwarts now, working in the kitchen with the other house-elves as he’s done ever since I sent him there after Sirius died. Back then, it was mostly a safety precaution since he knew too much to be reliable, but I’ve always figured he’d be happier there — with something to do and other elves to socialise with — rather than moping around here all by himself with no one but Walburga’s old bigotted portrait to talk to. I can attest it’s not a pleasurable existence.
“Yes.” Harry’s smile subsided, not fading completely but turning more serious, wistful. “Listen, Draco,” he said, tightening the hold of Draco’s hand. “I won’t lie to you; not everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows. There are rough times ahead, worse than either one of us should ever have to live through.”
Molly stepped forwards and, without preamble, wrapped him in a hug. “Welcome to the family! I’m so sorry we didn’t already know about the two of you. You see, Charlie hasn’t been home in so long, and we’d been hoping he’d settle down with a nice girl or boy now that he’s getting older — he doesn’t like to talk about it because he doesn’t like my interfering — but now that we met you, I’m so glad to know he’s finally found someone who cares so much about him!”
“What am I going to do, little dragon? He’s finally my friend, and I’m going to fuck it all up because of this whole Charlie thing.” The fox’s nose twitched as he studied Draco curiously. “And his glass. Oh, Smaug, you should see his glass!” Draco rolled over on his back, unable to keep his arm from gesticulating as he spoke. “It’s gorgeous and so intense, like looking into his soul or something.”
Sure, Draco guessed it could be nice spending more time with people his own age, maybe even get some new friends. The Wiltshire countryside didn’t really have a lot to offer in that regard, and even if his parents had made sure to invite the Crabbes and the Goyles on several occasions to let Draco get to know their boys before heading off to school, Theo was really the only other kid he’d call a friend. And now he was going to be with them every day. They would even share the same bedroom.
“So, I battled one of your namesakes yesterday. Well, I doubt her name was Smaug, but she was a dragon. You should be impressed.”
She slid her hands into the pockets and paused, drawing out several tins of cat food. She set them on the table. “Weird.”
When he blinked his eyes open, Hannah was gone, but a glass of water sat on the table next to him. He must have drifted off. He sat up against his pillows and reached for the glass, taking a long drink of water as he tried to put his thoughts in order.
Draco turned and walked up to the sinks, catching his reflection in the mirror. And yes, he hated that too, the sight of himself so wrecked, so broken. A pathetic mess. Courtesy of Harry Fucking Potter.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he stayed quiet, waiting, heart thumping wildly in his chest.
“Wait, no…” Draco started, trying to interrupt, but everyone kept talking over him. Everyone but the mysterious, dark-haired man in the corner who simply grinned, as if enjoying himself.
," Harry moans as Draco slides in deep, the burn from the stretch of the extra digit only momentary and quickly brushed aside as the feeling of Draco's fingers inside him intensifies.
“Come on, Potter, have you ever heard of a Slytherin who’d place a bet on something they didn’t fully believe in?”
If I hadn’t just witnessed you spending your entire yearly quota of humble gratitude just a few weeks ago, I’d never even contemplate wasting another piece of parchment on a reply to that sarcastic rant of yours. Merlin, Malfoy, you’re such a fucking drama queen sometimes, I don’t even… But I know you, and I get it. Your oversized pride gets threatened and bam! Diva to the rescue. Just like when Buckbeak grazed your impeccable porcelain skin in Third Year. You do know pride is a sign of low self-esteem, right? Maybe you should work on that?
And then Draco is shooting into Harry's mouth, and it tastes hot and slightly sweet, but kind of bitter — sort of like Draco himself, Harry thinks, suppressing a chuckle — but then it's too much to swallow and it spills from the sides of Harry's mouth and the heat of it, the utter lewdness of it all, pushes Harry over the edge.
“Come on.” Harry takes Draco’s hand from his hip, wrapping his fingers around Draco’s as he shuffles off the couch to stand in front of him. “Let’s get you cleaned up so we can do dirty things in my bed later.”
But okay, let’s say I humour you and your sudden romantic streak. Let’s say its not a ruse and that you actually want a relationship like that in the future. If you ask me — which I’m quite sure you don’t, but you know what? I’m going to give it to you anyway because, well, for fucks sake, M,
“Wow,” Draco said, stopping short. “I can’t have been gone more than thirty minutes. How did you get cleaned up so quickly? You look great.”
It’d been a long time since he’d been intimate with somebody, but he wasn’t about to break his streak with Slyvia, no matter how lonely he was. But the invitation, the heart-warming knowledge that someone out there actually did want him, remained with him throughout the evening. That night, as he closed his eyes, he imagined a pair of crystal blue eyes in a weathered, freckled face and fell to sleep with a smile upon his face.
“No, thanks,” she said, as she always did, despite both of them knowing she’d be back within thirty minutes to order two cardamom buns. She handed him a banknote and some coins before taking the mugs, adding, “Keep the change.”
It was hard to tell with the sound of the rain surrounding them, but Draco thought he heard a slight agreement come from the man next to him. The sight of the office building emerging from the darkness ahead felt like a relief, like an encouraging beacon in the awkward silence that had suddenly managed to wedge its way between them. Eventually, Harry was the one to break it, but not until they were only about a hundred yards away from the front door.
A flash of white caught his eye over by the old escritoire in the corner, and Draco braced himself for another explosion that never came. He blinked. It wasn’t another curse. It was the light from the overhead lamp reflecting off… a metallic disc rolling over the polished hardwood floor, coming to rest somewhere underneath the antique piece of furniture. Draco’s gaze flitted to his hand, palm flat against the floorboards, fingers splayed wide, and his eyes widened, panic building in his chest.
“Ah. That’s… good. I—” Draco swallows and averts his gaze. “I just wanted to check in to see if you ever found yourself a date for the evening?”
— and plenty more than that in his own. Harry can’t help smiling as he follows the milk with the ‘appropriate’ amount of sugar, spelling a teaspoon to stir the sickly-sweet beverage in Draco’s mug before casting a stasis charm to preserve the right temperature in wait for Draco’s reappearance.
Draco reached out and wrapped his fingers around the coin, revelling in the calmness that flowed through him as soon as his skin connected with the cool silver. He was just about to Nox his wand as he noticed another glint of metal in his peripheral vision.
“Let me guess,” Draco greeted the girl whose cheeks were still rosy from the crisp autumn air, “two large coffees, one with a splash of milk, the other sickly sweet?”
I lean back on my rickety chair, stretching out my aching legs and crossing my ankles as I watch the people milling around on the sun-soaked piazza. They’re mainly tourists, of course — this time of year, it’s only to be expected — but at least they’re mixed with a healthy dose of locals here, compared to the more famous sights like Piazza della Signorina or Ponte Vecchio. I’ve always preferred places like this, the hidden gems away from the most fervent crowds, but I figure we’ll probably have to tackle those too, sooner or later. Although I’ve been in this town enough times not to have to bother with the obligatory tourist attractions, I’m with a new travel companion now, one who’s never been here before, and it would be blasphemy to leave this place without ever having seen Il Duomo or Michelangelo’s David.
The Dark Lord’s voice rang through the castle and Draco froze, chill coursing through his veins as his mind screeched to a halt.
PS I do hope you’ll change your mind about showing me your drawings one day. The way you describe them, I bet they’re nothing short of breathtaking.
“Yes. Let’s talk about the topics that should always be avoided when you’re on a date; or at least before you know each other much better.” That same finger comes up again as Harry nods, already knowing he’s going to get properly chastised. “The throes of the dating scene, past relationships, politics, religion, and life problems. Tell me, how many of those did you touch on this past hour?”
A slow smile crossed Harry’s face and the corners of his eyes wrinkled as the smile reached them. Dipping two fingers into his breast pocket, he held up one of the silver pieces of paper Pansy had distributed as tickets for the evening.
Draco lets out a harsh laugh. “You’re such a prick, Potter,” he says with a strained voice and an exasperated headshake. “If you can’t tell I’m currently using every last bit of my restraint not to rip your clothes off your body, then you’re a blithering idiot.”
I stand by the counter for several minutes, staring unseeingly at the opposite wall as images of you flash before my eyes; your bare skin, your long limbs, your perfect firm arse and that plump, pink lip trapped under shiny white teeth. The entire flat smell of your lemony shampoo, a scent I’ve come to think of as
He began drying the dishes, opening cupboards to tuck them all away neatly, then turned around and glared at the countertops. “
What if he was walking straight into a trap? Draco didn’t think that was the case, but what if he was wrong? What if Harry was just playing him? For fun, mortification, or revenge; Draco could only guess. Either option was a viable possibility whether or not he wanted to admit it.
A quiet bark from a nearby bush pulled his attention away from his dark thoughts. Behind a park bench off the right side of the path sat a large, black dog. It looked clean and well-fed, but there was no collar around its neck and no sign of an owner nearby.
— the Saviour of the Wizarding World, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One — be interested in someone like him. Not in that way, at least. They’d been sworn enemies, for Circe’s sake, surely— No. His well-meaning friend must’ve just read the signs all wrong. Not like Draco could blame her. To someone like her, so obviously unaware of their shared past, those furtive glances probably
The door swung open, and there he was, a dark blue apron secured over his front and a bright, toothy smile adorning his face.
“I thought we talked about this. I buy you special anti-hairball treats. You eat them and keep the piles of…of
“Oh. I—” The flower draws Draco’s gaze, holding his attention for several excruciating seconds before those stormy-grey eyes, still swirling with confusion, eventually return to Harry’s.
Harry hummed in agreement as Draco wrapped his arms around his waist and began to sway to the music. "I don't dance, you know…"
“I’m not going to jump you,” he promises, noticing Draco’s shoulders tense. “Yet.” He flashes Draco a mischievous grin and revels in the low rumble of Draco’s answering chuckle. “You have a tattoo?” he asks superfluously as he raises his hand to trace what indeed looks like an intricate tattoo of a leafless tree. At Harry’s touch, the tree blooms with leaves, surprising him enough to quickly withdraw his hand as if he’s been burned.
At least Harry was sleeping well. Now, if he could only make sure everything was okay with Malfoy, if he could figure out what was going on, he’d be able to concentrate on his studies and have a normal, final year at Hogwarts.
. Because if anyone deserved the epithet, it was Draco — the stunning blond angel, with his lust-blown eyes and his kiss-swollen lips, his usually-so-pale porcelain skin now flushed with colour.
The evening pushed on, and Draco continued to work the room, but the Minister’s words kept coming back to him.
I know my desire is futile, that my fantasies can never come true. Because we’re friends now, real friends, and after everything, I should be happy we’ve even come this far.
Draco sighed, but nodded and watched as Sirius studiously ignored him on his way back to have a talk with Molly and Arthur. That man was on Draco’s shit list. He’d promised he’d take care of it, and now look what’d happened.
Only the basics, of course, that we’ve been writing to each other since you got out of Azkaban at the beginning of the year. Nothing about the content of our letters or anything; that’s none of their business and never will be. My revelation was enough to render Hermione speechless for several minutes (which is not an easy feat, I tell you) while Neville’s jaw dropped to the floor and Seamus’ and Dean’s eyeballs nearly popped out of their sockets. Luna, Ginny, and Millie simply nodded, as if this was no surprise to them at all, while Ron, predictably, started to splutter, questioning my sanity. That is, until he noticed the unsurprised looks on Blaise’s and Theo’s faces and realised they’d already known — which was when his confusion morphed into plain outrage. (Honestly, I don’t know if he’ll ever forgive me for letting the snakes in on the secret before him, no matter how much I try to explain it was all by accident.) Meanwhile, Pansy stood in the corner, infuriating as ever, cradling a cup of tea in her hands and grinning like the kneazle that got the cream.
“No, I… I’ll be back after New Years, I promise. Mark my words, two weeks together with Mother is more than enough.”
He nodded again and looked so uncomfortable that Harry wanted to laugh. Instead, he slipped his hand in Draco's and pulled him towards the door and the noise of the Weasley clan that could easily be overheard from the garden.
They’d invited him to Christmas dinner? Draco’s stomach tightened, and he moved to the table to sit, trying to calm his racing thoughts. He wanted to go, to be part of this family tradition more than anything, but it would only make this whole lie worse. He couldn’t do it. He shouldn’t.
Draco turned to the nearest fireplace and realised she was right. There, on the end, was a stocking full of sweets with his name written across it. He swallowed around the lump growing in his throat; he’d never had a stocking before.
He wants to take it slow. He’s been fantasising about this moment for so long, and if this is real, if this is really happening, he wants to make it perfect. He wants to drag it out, to savour it. He wants to treasure it and etch it on his memory to keep forever.
Harry fought back a frustrated groan. “Oh, come off it. They’d like you even if you weren’t all dressed up, you prat. You made them feel welcome. You made them relax and feel comfortable in a stranger’s company. That was not the costume; that was
“You’d be surprised.” Sirius smirked, but when Draco raised his eyebrow in question, the man just waved it away. “Anyway, I’ll tell them, but let’s wait a bit longer. Please,” he added as Draco opened his mouth to disagree. “Once we see Charlie’s about to wake up, we’ll tell them, and then they’ll be so happy to see Charlie that they won’t mind a bit.”
Draco was so close, close enough to touch. Harry could smell his fresh spicy scent wafting through the air and it took all his restraint not to reach out for him. It was futile to hope Draco didn’t catch the quaver in his voice.
"He's mentioned it a few times — like I told you, already — but I'm not interested. I told him I need time to figure things out."
It was all so unfair. His life had been far from easy lately, but he’d managed. He’d been able to stay strong, to carry on, to work on his task, and he had actually thought it was okay, that he’d be able to see this through. And then Potter popped by without warning, after five and a half years of radio silence, and just expected Draco to believe him, to trust him.
So, I, well, we all went out last night to celebrate the end of N.E.W.T. exams and— And before you go all ‘don’t drink and write, or I’ll perish from your typos’ on me: I’m perfectly sober now, thank you very much.
The cottage was… Draco stopped to look around and take it in. It was…utterly disgusting, actually. He supposed if clean, it could’ve been considered rustic or quaint, but as it was, it was a fucking pigsty. Dirty dishes sat on every flat surface, and rumpled clothing was wadded up and sprinkled randomly all over the living area. Draco stepped over a pile of old newspapers and nudged aside a folding chair sitting directly in the centre of the room, knocking over a mostly-empty whiskey bottle in the process.
“Yes, I feel the same,” Draco heard himself saying, then blushed. This wasn’t something he usually let people know about himself. His friends knew he cooked, but they didn’t realise it was something he enjoyed.
“After my sentence was up,” Draco said to his abandoned dessert, “I was so excited to get back into the real world. You know”— he glanced up, offering Harry a wry smile —”just walking down Diagon Alley, perusing the shops, enjoying the sun, taking it all in.” He’d got about seven and a half minutes of that before… “I’m sure you remember what happened…” Harry winced. Yeah, he remembered, all right. It had been plastered all over the news, after all, the ex-Death Eater finally getting what he deserved. Draco couldn’t forget it if he tried; he’d always have the scars to remind him.
“Well, shall we start this?” the Ministry official asked, sounding bored. He shot an irritated glance at Draco. “We’re already ten minutes late as it is.”
The laugh escapes Harry without permission, and he opens his eyes to find Draco’s silver depths peering into his own, his brow furrowed in a way Harry’s never seen on this man’s face before. Draco looks… He looks worried.
“Oh, I—” She reluctantly tore her eyes away from her date, her freckled skin turning pink as the wallet slipped from her restless fingers and fell onto the countertop. “I’m sorry, I—”
Sleep eluded him where he laid in the dark, thoughts swirling as he studied the shadows on the ceiling. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t stop smiling.
“Dreams?” Draco asks, breathless. He’s incredibly still, but there’s a twitch in his wings that catches Harry’s eye.
“Draco,” Molly called when she noticed him. “He’s awake, darling. Isn’t that wonderful?” She pulled him into her arms, enveloping him in another one of her motherly hugs. His last one, probably. “Soon this nightmare will finally be over and everything will go back to normal.”
Harry tries not to pout at the loss of Draco's body in his, but a nibble on his earlobe pushes the regret away. "Me? Incredible?" he asks, laughing slightly. "You're the one who just fucked my brains out."
Draco studiously avoided Harry’s sculpture, unable to bring himself to look at it. All over the room, people were talking about it, mentioning Harry’s name, chattering about the raw beauty of the sculpture. With every mention, Draco’s chest tightened and his smile became more forced.
Draco pocketed the time-turner without a second thought and turned around to find Minette taking in Bellatrix’s handiwork with wide eyes.
The first dream came on his eighteenth birthday. It was vivid and colourful and real. So real. After waking up, warm and breathless, he hadn’t been able to recall what had happened in the dream, but he could remember what it had felt like. What
Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, and Harry swallowed it greedily, lapping up every trace of the glorious sound as if he were a parched man who’d been wandering the desert for ages. Harry sank his fingers into the soft, silky locks of Draco’s longer-than-usual hair, grabbing it in his fists and rejoicing in Draco’s answering groan. Draco’s hands, hot and large and eager, moved along the waistband of Harry’s trousers, one of them trailing off to follow the curves of Harry’s spine as the other settled on the small of his back. The press of his palms brought them closer together, reminding Harry of Draco’s current state as he felt the man’s protruding stomach against his abs.
“Your hair looks nice today, by the way,” Draco says, thankfully tearing Harry’s thoughts away from the mental view of his perfectly rounded arse. “Did you try that untousling potion I mentioned the other day?”
Harry holds his breath, aware that his rambling could possibly put an end to… whatever this is, before it’s even begun. Prepared for the worst, he can barely believe his eyes when Draco’s features morph into a fond smile, complete with twinkling silver-grey eyes and everything.
Just like Hermione will eventually have to accept that Kreacher is back with me at Grimmauld Place. (Actually, I think she was more upset about that than me secretly exchanging letters with you for eight months.) Apart from her disapproval, though, I think his presence has actually improved the situation here, just like you said it would. I almost never feel compelled to leave the house anymore — well, except that time last week when I, with a string of expletives, punched my fist to the wall of the second-floor landing after accidentally stumbling on the stairs and almost breaking a toe — and I can’t say for sure, but I think there are other changes going on as well. If there are, it’s all too subtle to put a finger on, but I can swear the place feels brighter somehow, more welcoming. And I might be imagining it, but I think the air feels easier to breathe.
not suited for any kind of desk job, but I do get what you’re saying about having an activity that forces you to focus. What I wouldn't do for a chance to escape my thoughts sometimes. I’d need something more active than brewing for that to happen, though, and definitely something less complicated.
“A—” Startled by the unexpected bluntness, Draco looked up to find deep-blue eyes twinkling back at him. It wasn’t the first time he’d been propositioned at work; men and women alike had a tendency to confuse his professional joviality with genuine interest. And it wasn’t like he could deny this bloke was attractive, what with his disarming smile, sandy blond curls and that well-defined, stubbled jaw. Honestly, had it been just a week ago, Draco probably would’ve taken him up on his offer. As it was, though…
Luckily, the universe decided not to embarrass him at this time, sending him a much-needed distraction in the form of his godson.
Starting today, he would simply refuse to let it govern his life any longer. It was the perfect timing too, with Draco leaving the country for several weeks. By the time he got back, Harry should have managed to shrug off this rose-tinted illusion of possible romance and return to his bloody senses, right?
They’ve already agreed to stay away from the wizarding world, neither of them ready to instigate the commotion being spotted together dating would doubtlessly cause. But Harry had no idea Malfoy was such a Muggle-savvy man. Not only does he handle pounds and pennies like a pro, but he knows how to talk with Muggles without causing suspicion. He can easily blend in, navigating trains and buses and even the ticket barriers on the Underground.
“Er…” The question catches Harry by surprise; Malfoy’s never asked him to interpret a topic beforehand before, and his brain is still on overload from all the wizarding facts about seemingly benign Muggle objects that Malfoy’s been revealing over the past few hours. “I don’t know, be happy she hasn’t dumped you yet?”
. If Draco only knew how often Harry mentally undressed him in the middle of a conversation… He’d be utterly horrified.
You’re asking about the new teachers. No, I don’t think you would have met any of them, except maybe for Elphias Doge, the new History Professor? He’s been working for the Wizengamot for ages, so I suppose your dad could have introduced you at some point. Although old and wrinkled, he’s very passionate about his subject, and his lessons can never be called boring. Such a change from Binns that it’s hard to think of it as the same subject really.
A reply popped up on the screen and Draco blinked, feeling strangely dizzy. Why did— Oh yeah, apparently the occasional intake of oxygen was still a requirement for keeping a functioning brain. Draco took a shaky breath, filing that observation away for future reference while waiting for his blurred sight to return to normal.
“Now, there’s a thought.” Malfoy takes a sip of his wine while Harry splutters, lost for words as he looks between the two of them. “All right, Potter. Here’s a proposition for you. It’s four weeks until Valentine’s Day. How about, during this time, you’ll date me? I’ll study your moves, give you practical tips for improvement, and teach you all there is to know about successful dating.”
And I want to kiss those dry, quivering lips until you’ve forgotten all about your idiot of a father and all you remember is how much you are loved.
Harry shuffled in his seat, moving his book bag under his feet so she couldn’t reach it. “What map?”
And that’s when it happened, right before Harry’s eyes. Draco must have felt it too, because he stilled, lust-blown eyes widening as he stared unblinkingly straight into Harry’s soul. Harry watched in wonder as Draco’s dry, wrinkled skin smoothed out and regained its former lustre, as his white facial hair shortened and eventually disappeared, leaving in its wake neatly shaped eyebrows and those impossibly long golden lashes. Up close like this, they were even more mesmerising than usual, framing Draco’s beautiful eyes like bright rays of pure sunshine. Locks of gorgeous hair, once again cheekbone-length and platinum-blond, fell over Draco’s forehead, making him look dishevelled in a way Harry had never seen him before, except in his wildest fantasies. A fresh spark of arousal travelled down Harry’s spine as he realised just whose hands were responsible for that sexy tousled look.
You had a cat named Cotton? That’s quite a peculiar name for a cat, isn’t it? I bet there’s a story there… Was he just as white and fluffy as I picture him? Merlin, I can only imagine what your father must have thought of all the cat hair clinging to his fancy robes. I don’t know why I have such a hard time seeing 11-year-old you with any kind of pet, but now you mention it, I bet Lucy liked having a fellow feline around. How is he, by the way? It feels like it’s been far too long since I last checked in with him. I hope he’s doing all right; I’m starting to grow quite fond of him.
I’ve been meaning to write back to you all week, but between the chaos at the Burrow and the new term starting, I haven’t gotten a quiet moment until now. Plus, I do tend to leave stuff ‘til the last minute so… Anyway, it’s all quiet now, and I figured I might as well do it before the rest of the castle wakes up. It’s not even 5 am, but I’ve never been able to get back to sleep after my nightmares. (I’m guessing you have them too, so I reckon you know what it’s like.) Did you know I’ve been trying to rescue you from that bloody fiendfyre almost every night this week? I blame your letter for reminding my subconscious.
Draco clenched his fist, missing the sharp sensation of the coin’s edge digging into his palm. He needed it back. After all this time, he couldn’t imagine going a single day without it. He needed the comfort it provided, the reminder not to lose his faith, its promise that
Harry nodded. “It’s easier to get along with challenges when you don’t know anything else. It’s harder to lose something once you know what you’re missing, though, isn’t it?”
It’s laughable really, thinking about how that naïve bloke in the picture had been so convinced his attraction would fade with time if he only learnt to hide his feelings from the world. It hasn’t, not even a little bit. On the contrary, in the seven months since, it has only grown stronger and fiercer, intensifying in tandem with their developing friendship.
“Anyway… Thanks for coming.” Harry said as he paused at the far end of the long aisle, his hands shoved deep in his jeans pockets. A lock of his unruly raven hair had fallen in front of his eye, and instead of flicking it back, he peeked up at Draco through his inexplicably long eyelashes. If Draco didn’t know better, he’d assume the mighty war hero was nervous about something. “We keep the fireworks and anything else flammable in the cave. It’s back here.”
I should have guessed you played the piano. I bet you’re really good at it too, what with your long, dexterous fingers and you being all studious and determined. I’d never have the patience to learn to play an instrument, even if I sometimes wish I could. I’m more of an intuitive, can-or-can’t kind of guy. Merlin, you should’ve seen me when Snape tried to teach me occlumency. Total disaster, I tell you. Knowing how to play an instrument would’ve been cool, though. Maybe there’s a simple one I could learn how to master? Like the drums or something? Or a guitar? Is it hard to learn how to play the guitar?
why Draco was going over to Harry’s tonight — to help him study. Nothing else. Draco resolutely reined in his galloping delusions.
Draco’s bare chest moves against his, his ribcage rising and falling under Harry’s with every ragged breath as they calm down. It takes a while before Harry realises their bodies move in perfect unison, that his own breathing is matched so perfectly with Draco’s, it’s like they’ve always been in sync. As if they’ve been following the same rhythm all along, only now uniting downstage to perform the gig’s main duet together.
“Thanks,” Draco said quietly as he watched Harry turn and walk back towards the hospital’s entrance.
“You work too much,” she said with a pout. “I thought you ran a charity. Surely, it shouldn’t have to take up so much of your time? There isn’t any way you could rearrange it, just this once? For me?”
Incidentally, Crouch Jr is also the answer to satisfy your curiosity regarding the Goblet of Fire. On RIddle’s orders, he not only tinkered with the Goblet’s magic and entered my name, but also, once I had been proclaimed the fourth champion, made sure I had just enough help along the way to reach the cup first and win. It was a portkey, you see, set to deliver me to Riddle’s awaiting reincarnation ritual. Riddle needed my blood to perform the dark magic that brought him back to his human-ish form. If I hadn’t been such a chivalrous fool, insisting Cedric and I grip the cup together, Cedric wouldn’t have been killed. ‘Kill the spare,’ Riddle ordered as soon as he set eyes on him. As if the guy was nothing more than a pesky bug under his shoe. He died on the spot — the only blessing of an AK, it’s quick and painless — an innocent victim who just happened to catch Riddle’s eye. The first of many, all because of me.
“Of course, darling. We’ll see you at the hospital tomorrow. Do you have plans for New Year’s? We don’t have a large party, but you’re welcome to come over to celebrate. We’ll have champagne and a nice dinner, of course.”
“Sure about that?” he asks, and damn it; Harry can hear the smug smirk curving his lips without even looking.
Draco reluctantly released him, and Harry stepped into his pyjama bottoms before going over to the dresser in search of something for Draco to wear. He couldn’t very well put on yesterday’s clothes, could he?
Draco wants him. Has been wanting him for years. If that means Harry’s stuck with him for the foreseeable future, so be it. Frankly, if it means Harry’s stuck with Draco for always, that’d be okay too.
Her raised eyebrows effectively shut me up and I swallow, hoping none of the others has noticed me zoning out. Luna’s too perceptive to hide anything from, but with a bit of luck, the others might have had enough to drink to miss it.
“Well, trust me when I say ‘cocky’ and ‘confident’ was far from how I felt the night before leaving.”
“Now, make yourself something to drink and go entertain that beau of yours. He’s been sitting in that corner all day, enduring everyone’s attention just to be here for your big day. Don’t you think he’s earned yours by now?”
“Don’t we all?” Malfoy chuckles and takes the vacated seat opposite Harry. Harry glares at him. If anyone excels at the dating game, it’s Malfoy; always entertaining a new fling and seemingly loving every minute of it. “What?” Malfoy shrugs innocently. “Either I suck him or he sucks me, and whichever way, a fun time is had by all.”
“No.” Teddy’s nose scrunched up in the most adorable way possible. “I’m a big brave boy. I can go by myself.”
“Yes, Sirius Black. The first man ever to escape Azkaban, aka Potter’s godfather, aka my last living relative, who seems just a tad crazy compared to his cousin, my aunt. He said that Molly almost lost it after her son died in the war and that when they heard about Charlie, she started acting strange again. But then she learned about me, and apparently, the news distracted her enough to get back to normal.” He winced and took another sip of his tea. “And as for Hermione, well, you should see her. She looks like she’s about to drop a baby any day now.”
Draco chuckled and nodded, trying not to think too much about the sensation of Harry’s light stubble against his cheek as he did. Harry’s hands moved slightly over Draco’s back, and then it all changed.
For the same reason I don’t trust myself to drink anything stronger than tonic water these days: because I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you if I did.
Draco keeps his eyes closed but presses his head into Harry's hand, reminding Harry of Orion doing the same.
The groan that escapes Draco's lips sounds inhuman, and a smirk of triumph finds its way to Harry's mouth. "Take me up."
“Well, this is awkward,” Harry said, trying to catch his breath between sporadic giggles. Draco quickly rolled off him, watching Harry sit up and crawl up onto his knees, his jeans hugging every inch of those toned thighs perfectly.
“Good.” Draco took in the tired smile on his husband’s face. He gestured towards Harry’s cup, waiting for him just as always next to his armchair. “I made you tea.”
Harry shrugged, his eyes shifting down, not meeting Draco’s. “I was just checking on things. You? How’d you get in?”
“Hmm.” Malfoy’s lower lip seems to be trapped between his teeth and he doesn’t look all that convinced as his eyes return to Harry’s face. “It’s passable, I guess, but I’ll better make sure to fit in a proper shopping spree in our schedule at our earliest convenience.”
Fuck, I’m sorry. Of course you don’t know about what happened to your parents, and of course you’d want to know. Why haven’t you asked earlier? I double-checked their sentences the other day, not trusting my memory after so many months. (There were a lot of trials last summer, and most of it is nothing but a big blur of awful to me these days.) Narcissa will be out of Azkaban in only a few months, actually. She got one year in prison plus two additional years’ of house arrest. I still haven’t gotten any straight answers on how the Ministry plans to execute it, but with a little luck, you might actually get some company come July. Your father will be a little longer. He got five years, which is still remarkably low compared to most of his fellow death eater buddies, mainly because he offered a great deal of valuable information that helped the aurors capture the strays who were still on the run.
Harry nodded and set his box down, digging in his coat for a key. Drawing it out, he opened the door and returned for the box. “Ready?”
Charlie’s eyes brightened. “Yes, she sent a card. Most dragons wouldn’t bother, but she’s a special one.”
“Tomorrow?!” Her shrill voice rang in Draco’s ears.  “What the— Draco, come back here. Who are you marrying?”
Pansy spit out her wine and the group of people around them fell into silence, then started to giggle. Ernie’s booming laughter followed, and Draco just wanted to curl up and die.
The morning sun poured through Draco’s windows on Boxing Day, the bright light pulling him from his anxious dreams of dragonfire, angry Weasleys, and motherly hugs. The strange mix left him disconcerted and unsure of himself, neither something he enjoyed.
The otherworldly vision of Draco, glowing and magnificent, is the last thing Harry sees before the world fades to black.
“I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.” Harry was going for cheerful, but it ended up rather strained and a little breathless. Hopefully, the jovial smile he plastered across his face would be enough to divert Draco’s attention.
“O-okay.” Harry swallows. The collar isn’t tight by any means, Harry can easily fit his fingers between it and his neck, yet it feels like he’s suffocating. He’s never worn a slim-fitted dress shirt in his life; why would he, when tees and hoodies are so much more comfortable? It’s a nice colour on him, though — even Harry can see that — a deep, warm purple, almost shimmering in the overhead light. It’s a garment he’d never give a second glance if he were on his own, much like most of the clothes Malfoy’s had him trying out today, but just as with the rest, he finds himself trusting Malfoy’s judgement implicitly. A weird concept, indeed.
loving relationship would even make you less of a git? Maybe if you found someone to love like that, you’d eventually end up less of an arse? What if the loving devotion to a wife is what’d finally make you
"No, you won't." Harry reaches up to wrap a hand around Draco's nape, pushing himself up to place a reassuring kiss on those delicious, rosy lips. "And you're already halfway in, right? Just keep going this time. I'm ready for you now."
He couldn't believe his eyes. He’d been wishing to meet him again. First, in a futile longing for reassurance. Later, to force some long-overdue answers or admissions out of him. Sometimes, just to hex him into oblivion, or physically beat the living daylights out of him. And here he was now, shoulders hunched, head bowed, lower lip caught between his teeth as he looked up at Draco through those long-as-fuck, inky black lashes. He looked regretful. Apologetic. As if
Draco cringed but nodded. “Yes, I suppose I did,” he said, uncomfortable at the praise given everything else he was about to tell them. “But when we got there, they took him away and someone”— his eyes met Hannah’s in the back of the room, and she gave him an encouraging nod —“misunderstood something I said in my exhaustion. The truth is, though, other than a quick greeting from time to time on the Reserve, Charlie and I had never spoken. And we were never engaged.”
“Truly,” Draco deadpans, but he steps closer, close enough for his hot breath to ghost over Harry’s cheek. “Can I kiss you?”
And now, if Potter was dead, it meant that… his older self would never exist. Because, Draco finally acknowledged, they were one and the same. His sworn school nemesis, the constant pain in his arse, was the same person who’d comforted him as a frightened child, the same person who had dried his tears as a despairing teenager. This younger version of Potter may not ever have cared for him, but the older one did. Always had. He’d given Draco hope; had made him believe this nightmare would one day be over. Had given him faith it would turn out okay.
“Do you want any spreads with your scone?” Draco clung to his professional, friendly smile, silently praying for patience. “Cream cheese? Butter? Raspberry jam?”
Harry had thought Draco would choose to fuck him like this, taking him from behind. It would surely have been most convenient, considering how close his prick already was to where it was supposed to go. But Draco told him to turn over, and so he did, lifting his hips to allow for Draco to place a pillow under his arse. Draco kneeled between his thighs, his dark eyes roaming over Harry’s body as he lined himself up.
Draco goes silent and for a brief moment, Harry wonders what’s distracting the man from continuing. Then realisation hits him like a rogue bludger; he’s not meeting Draco’s gaze anymore, he’s staring at Draco’s perfect mouth.
Finally able to touch Harry too, Draco reached up to follow the smooth lines of Harry’s body with trembling hands; strong, sinewy arms, broad shoulders, sharp collarbones, racing pulse, bobbing Adam’s apple.
“Oh, kiddo. You really do remind me of Cissa sometimes,” Sirius said quietly. “Once you’ve made your mind up about something, there’s no leeway for any other option, is there?” Draco looked up at the man who shared his eyes, the last of his mother’s family. The last of his own.
Actually, come to think of it, maybe I should take a step back and let you do just that. Surely, you’d prefer to exchange letters with one of them instead of me. I can’t deny that I’ve come to look forward to our weekly thing, but if you’d rather write to any of them just let me know, all right?
Because Harry did. He looked, to use Slyvia’s phrasing, delicious. His weathered black, skinny jeans accentuated his defined legs, and although he only wore a red t-shirt under his sherpa-collared Burberry jacket, it looked festive and casual. Fun. And yes, delicious.
Ginny started laughing but stopped at her mother’s glare. “Right, no Mum, I’m sure Charlie was a virgin until he met sweet Draco here.”
And just because someone belonged to the winning side didn’t mean they were a saint either. Many zealous supporters of the Light had made it their mission to rid the world of anyone who had ever followed Voldemort, regardless of the Wizengamot’s — far too lenient, according to some — rulings, and Harry was reluctantly grateful for Draco’s festive disguise which made him unrecognisable to anyone who wasn’t already aware of his identity.
Don’t think swapping yours truly for someone else would get you out of your promise, though, because I’m fairly sure I’m going to take you up on it. I honestly can’t wait to test your fan-repellant abilities in real life so you might as well book it in your calendar right away, my friend. You, me, Memorial Day 2000. It’s a
Harry gasps, feeling his eyes widen as a potent mix of alarm and desire gathers in the pit of his stomach. “Well, that sounds…intriguing.”
A door opened behind him and someone entered. Draco didn’t have to turn around to know who it was. Of course it was Potter. Of course it was. No one else better suited to make this fucking day even worse than it already was.
Harry smiles and brushes his thumb over Draco’s collarbone, hoping to reassure him. “I don’t. And I’m grateful for your concern, Draco, but if I didn’t want this, your magic wouldn’t have pulled me in, right? If I didn’t want this, I wouldn’t be here to have this conversation.”
PPS And it’s not like you have any right to talk when it comes to weird names. I mean, Draco? Who even names their child that? No wonder you turned out the way you did.
Molly wrapped Harry in a hug before he could even get in a reply or brush the Floo dust from his shirt. As if he wasn't living in Charlie's old room and hadn't just left the house that morning to get Draco for the party.
. It’s really him. I should know, right?” he quickly added as Harry was about to protest again. “I just met him the other day, didn’t I?”
I wish I could say that I believed I would have become the same person no matter who my parents were (or rather, as in my case, which parental figures I grew up with), but I must admit you might be on to something here, Mr Philosopher. In fact, there’s nothing saying I wouldn’t have been just as coddled and spoiled as you, had I had the pleasure of growing up with my loving parents instead of with my bigoted, narrow-minded aunt and uncle.
There he was, returning from his long weekend away, off the Reserve. He stepped out of the hearth, brushing the soot from his sleeves with a confident flair before raking strong, calloused fingers through his long hair. For a brief moment, Draco let himself imagine what it would feel like, running his own hand through those locks, the colour of dark copper, that cascaded over his shoulders in gentle waves. Draco knew the man would pull it back into a knot on the top of his head as soon as he got outside, keeping it out of the way of any stray dragon fire. It was a dangerous liability to leave it down when around the beasts.
, almost falls from Harry’s lips. Because it’s hard to believe anything else when you’re sitting right next to your ‘special someone’. But then again, if it really were true love, if it were destined, wouldn’t the feelings be mutual?
“Huh, I didn’t realise Park Foundation was behind it,” Harry said as he walked over to a stack of boxes in the corner and picked one up, handing it to Draco. It was heavier than it looked, but Draco adjusted it in his arms and waited. “That’s the one you work for, right? The one that runs the Reserve?”
They’re magnificent. Shimmering in the pale moonlight, they reach nearly nine feet wide on each side, the largest feathers similar to the one Harry found on the staircase on his way up. The same heady caramel smell wafts over Harry again, stirring his body’s interest.
Your jumper is soaking wet under my palm, your clothes dripping a trail on the hardwood floor. I summon my wand from the coffee table and you shiver as I cast a warm and gentle drying charm over you before guiding you to the couch.
“Seriously?” Draco chuckled as he got back on his feet. Damn, that laughter was infectious. “Turn around and let me see.”
His clothing was mostly burnt away and his skin was blistering. But he was alive. And he was conscious. Draco saw the dragon pull herself up again, ready for another attack, and Draco drew his wand.
Behind him, Harry let out a shaky breath, and Draco had to squeeze his eyes shut as the sound rushed up his spine like blazing wildfire. Harry’s hand still lingered on the back of Draco’s bare thigh, a warm weight grounding him to the present and keeping his every nerve-ending sizzling with anticipation.
The queue moved slowly, creeping along the front of the podium, taking them towards the small set of steps in the other end where a charming elf greeted the children as they arrived at the last stop before their long-awaited final destination — Santa’s lap. Harry briefly entertained the idea of going up there himself, wondering how Draco would react if he were to saunter over to him and casually sit down on his lap. The thought made him all but burst into a fit of giggles.
Do you ever miss it, Malfoy? Do you miss the thrill of the chase, the wind whipping in your hair as you soar through the sky, the swooping feeling in your stomach as you dive at breakneck speed towards the ground? I bet you do. And, shit… You don’t even get to go outside to taste the fresh air, let alone with a broom. Fuck, I’m sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have reminded you. That was…
“Oh, don’t look at me like that,” Malfoy says, pointing his spoon at him over the table. “I’m not the one having trouble with my dating life; I can walk out that door at any time if—”
want a boyfriend. Why else would you decide to risk everything by coming out to your parents? It’s just… I’ve never allowed myself to actually imagine you together with someone else before.
With a tad more power than is strictly necessary, Harry flicks his wand, sending the tea leaves out of existence. If only his conflicting emotions were as easily vanished. A dash of milk in the rainbow mug —
Shacklebolt chuckled. “Ms Parkinson says otherwise. According to her, this charity was all your idea to begin with. And I’ve recently heard some good things about you from other sources as well; you seem to be making a good name for yourself these days.” He leaned forwards and lowered his voice so only Draco could hear him. “I realise this might sound condescending, son, so please take it in the manner in which it’s meant.” He hesitated, and Draco nodded, nervous to hear him continue. “I’m proud of you. You’ve taken the chance you were given and made something amazing. You’re a most impressive young man.”
“Can you come back in a bit? I’d like to talk to you about something important.” Draco’s stomach knotted, but Charlie smiled, a little dimple poking through on his freckled cheek. “It’s good, though. Promise.”
Granted, Draco had once come from similar circumstances, nothing but Slytherins for generations, house expectations set long before he was even born. But while the Granger-Weasleys kept with the old-school intra-house tradition, the Potter-Malfoys were a modern post-war family, a paragon of diversity. Between their fathers, surrogate mother, and godbrother, Draco’s and Harry’s kids were surrounded by parental figures from all four houses, and he and Harry had always been adamant to make sure they knew they would be loved and supported no matter what house they ended up in. Draco secretly wished Rose would end up in Ravenclaw just to be able to enjoy the shock on Ron’s face once he found out.
Most people, you included, probably wonder why I even agree to come out with you every weekend. I don’t drink; I don’t dance; I don’t even flirt with the handsome men brave enough to approach me. That first time, it had been for moral support. You had talked about it all week, the excitement evident in your voice, in your gestures, the thrill and anticipation of finally getting out there, pursuing your true self. Behind it, though, I noticed the nervousness in your eyes, a stormy swirl of insecurity that made my heart ache. So I decided to come with you, to show that even if your father doesn’t approve of you being who you are, other people do.
It takes another hour — or maybe it’s just a second, Harry can’t be sure — before Draco finally looks up, meeting Harry’s gaze with sparkling, heavy-lidded eyes.
But who was Draco to turn that away? Charlie was everything Draco ever thought he’d wanted — fit, funny, carefree, popular — and he had an amazing family for whom Draco would do anything. Did it matter that there were no real feelings involved? Marriages had been built on less. Hell, most of the marriages on Draco’s family tree were built on less.
Draco rolled his eyes, dismissing Harry’s scepticism even as he knew it was probably warranted. Looking back, Draco was all too well aware of the obnoxious attention-whore he’d been back in the day.
And all through the night, until I’m safely back in the privacy of my bedroom, I keep the walls from falling down.
Draco wants this. Draco wants him. He’s been wanting Harry for years, damn it — and here they’ve been going around stupidly hiding their stupid feelings behind stupid walls when they could have been doing this all along.
Draco stopped moving and looked into Harry's eyes, his own sparkling with mirth. "I'm afraid you'll just have to wait and see."
“Yes, yes, but we need to raise at least an additional thirty-thousand Galleons if we’re going to have the scholarship fully-funded long enough to begin operating off the interest.” She listened to the other speaker, and Draco wandered the room, studying the painting she’d purchased at the silent auction of one of the autumn’s many fundraisers.
They've talked about it before, but the timing has never been right. The weather was bad, or they didn't have time, or there were people about. But now, the grounds are empty, the night is perfect, and Harry is ready. He
Draco pulled his winter coat tighter around himself, shivering in the cold January wind. He wasn’t generally one to take a walk simply for the sake of walking, but Pansy was right and this park looked as good as any. He trudged down the path, barely noticing more than the pavement beneath his feet.
, Draco had just enough time for the words to cross his mind before alarm turned into concern, green eyes imploring and bright with… tears?
I want to scream. I want to break something. No, I want to go to Wiltshire. I want to pummel that fucking bastard into next week, or next year. Or why not the next century? I’m so livid I can’t see straight… until my eyes fall on you sitting on the edge of my guest bed, looking utterly lost.
“Holy fuck,” he breathed, only now taking in the full reality of it all. Draco was here — his Draco, the man he’d been in love with for so long. He was standing only inches away with his flushed cheeks and his shallow breaths, about to enter Harry’s bedroom, about to… “
and begins to rummage through his trunk. As long as Ron didn’t take it the last time he slipped off with Hermione, it should be right— “Found it!”
Draco lost his train of thought when he noticed the corner of Harry’s mouth twitch as if the man struggled to bite back an amused smirk.
“Yes… Good idea…” This time, Harry turned properly to open the door, biting his lip when he felt Draco’s hot breath on his skin as the man leaned in to nuzzle his neck.
Draco’s frown grows deeper, his eyes filled with concern. “Who says there’s going to be heartbreak?”
I clamp my mouth shut, horrified as my own words register in my mind. I force myself to hold your gaze, to not let my eyes wander over your all but naked body. I remind myself why we’re here in the first place, why you’re so nervous, why I shouldn’t care.
Nerves pulled taut, he almost flinched at the creak of a floorboard on the landing above, the sound soon followed by familiar footsteps coming down the stairs. Draco took a deep breath and pressed a hand to his knee, willing it to stop bouncing. Merlin, he hadn’t been this jittery in years.
“Maybe you are, Potter, but I certainly don’t have time to—” Draco stilled as Potter came up from behind him and placed his large warm hands on Draco’s shoulders.
“Er…” The always so eloquent Draco fumbled for words and Harry listened, intrigued, as the man attempted a discreet cough to hide his flustered state. “No, I’m afraid not.”
In the little box, nestled amidst shreds of dark green, crinkled paper, was a glass globe. Draco gently lifted it from its protective bed and, as he raised it, his heart began to quicken.
“Welcome to Santa Claus’ Corner!” said the cheery elf manning the steps. “What is being your name, young sir?”
“I know it may have sounded extreme yesterday, but I meant what I said. The Weasleys have been through a lot, especially Molly.”
Charlie chuckled and rolled his eyes. “Calm down, man. If he wanted to make a big entrance at his own wedding, it’s his right.”
He knows better than to ask the man straight out, though. That’s not how you get Draco Malfoy to talk. Contemplating his options, Harry takes a generous gulp of his tea, hoping it will ease the ache burning in his throat.
Draco looked around the room, trying to find a way out of this where they wouldn’t all hex him once he eventually managed to spit out the truth. The sooner it happened, the better.
"Harry," Draco gasps. His hand falls into Harry's hair and his wings begin to move over Harry's skin. No longer able to stand the pressure, Harry drops his free hand to his own groin, palming his throbbing erection through his jeans. With a bit of wriggling, he manages to open them and push them down, just far enough to let his cock spring free. With it in his left hand and Draco's in his right, Harry proceeds in his endeavour.
I open my eyes and squint up at the man towering in front of me. He’s barely more than a silhouette against the bright sun, but I can still make out the smirk curving his lips.
. Heat rushes to Harry’s cheeks. Biting down on his lower lip, he braves his embarrassment and looks up to meet Draco’s eyes.
“A long time ahead, yeah. So I trust you not to go around showing this to all and sundry, all right?” Draco nodded absent-mindedly, head still swimming with everythi—  “I’m serious, Draco. No one can know about this, or our conversation. Not your parents, not your friends, not even my younger self.” Harry frowned before adding, “Especially not my younger self. Can I trust you to keep it a secret?”
“Then don’t you worry about it; it’ll only get you headaches and premature wrinkles.” Harry frowns at Malfoy’s wink, prompting the man to add, “As will that. Now, here’s what we’ll do…”
Draco should’ve been able to predict Harry’s eagerness, but somehow he hadn’t. For some inexplicable reason, he’d thought he’d be allowed to say this uninterrupted. After all, his own reflection hadn’t interrupted him once during his practice rounds in front of the mirror.
Not bad. The burgundy set off the lighter grey of his shirt and the dark, heathered grey of his trousers perfectly.
"Happy birthday to meeeee…" Harry murmurs into the mattress, his face squished and distorting the sound.
“Well,” Draco smirked, fully agreeing with his husband but determined to lighten the mood. “I guess we’ll have to come up with distractions to keep us occupied then… Such a hardship.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says. And if his voice is a tad strained, he decides to ignore it. “You’re the pro, Malfoy. Surprise me.”
“Good choice,” Draco said approvingly, just as he did every week, regardless of her pick of the day.
Unable to stand it another moment, Draco reached over to where he’d laid his cloak, picked it up, and as the room started to break out in exclamations, he made his way back down the aisle.
“Wait,” he blurts before he can think better of it, “your wings. Can you actually fly with them? Like, really fly? Maybe even well enough to carry someone else?”
He’d never regretted leaving the magical world, but being in Harry’s home — Merlin, he still couldn’t believe he was actually in
PS Seriously? You actually wrote to me knowing that first letter could have been the only interaction you’d get the entire year? Merlin. Knowing that makes me even more glad I decided to write you back. Not that it really was a hard decision to make, but still.
He could feel it; the soreness, the evidence of what had happened last night. The proof that it hadn’t all been just a dream. And Draco was still there, still asleep next to him. Harry could feel his body tucked snugly against his back, his hips, his thighs, could feel his morning erection pressing against his arse. Draco’s warm breaths wafted over the damp skin at the nape of Harry’s neck, deep and even, soothing to listen to. Harry wished he could lie like this forever, ensconced in the bliss of Draco’s nearness, far away from the world outside.
“You…W-what…?” Harry’s brain short-circuited and there was no way for him to stop the flush rising high and proud on his cheeks.
Her eyes widened. “You saved him?” She began running a diagnostic spell over Draco, then tutted. “You’re singed, and there’s a small burn on your arm. I can’t believe you dragged him away from dragonfire!”
“I don’t mean we should pretend none of it ever happened or anything, just, you know…” Harry shrugged. “It did, it’s done, and there’s nothing we can do about it now. We’re both who we are because of it, but there’s no need for us to let it rule our present — or our future…”
Harry tries to stand up but falls onto his arse, his jeans twisted awkwardly around his legs. That finally gets a coherent response from his boyfriend, and they both burst into laughter.
— and, if you find yourself as smitten by their work as I am, do remember to shower them with all the love and affection they deserve in the chapters' respective comments.
“I most certainly do…” Harry summoned the last of his resolve and took a step back, holding Draco off with one palm on each shoulder. Draco looked utterly dishevelled, and seeing that he still was in his Santa form, the sight was… truly something else. “Believe me, the moment that bloody potion wears off, I’m going to rip those clothes right off you, no matter where we are at the time.”
