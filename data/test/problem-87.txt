Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. “Those are expensive, you twat.”
Harry straightened from where he’d been trying to disappear into his chair. “Yes, sir,” he smirked back.
She licked the side of his neck as she viciously gripped a nipple. Malfoy sucked in a shuttering breath as she twisted sharply.
“Oh, I know. George told me. He said you seemed upset.” She continued to play with his hair and leaned in closer, her breasts pressed against his shoulder. Any other day, Harry might have welcomed the soft pressure. But with the disaster sitting just down the hall, Harry probably wouldn't have been moved by a provocative striptease.
“You’re pissed off because I have a skin care regimen and I accidently put your shirt on. You
Harry’s eyes slid off Neville’s unsure expression and landed on Ginny. A tense moment passed before they spoke at the same time.
“No need to explain to me, mate.” He winked and his grin nearly split his face. “I tried telling them you’d not be interested.” His grin turned sly. “I mean, not even that pretty lass you were talking to before had a hope.”
“’Morning,” Harry grunted. “You finished? I need to piss.”
“’Spose so,” Harry replied. He grabbed Mary’s drink and headed back to their table, hoping Malfoy would stay on the dancefloor and away from his information gathering.
Harry gave his back a dirty look and then wandered off to explore all the youthful delights he’d missed out on while growing up with the Dursley’s.
“She knows he was attacked,” Harry offered, “but I think that’s it.”
“Hello,” she smiled, “welcome to The Leather Petal.”
“I was escorting her back to Gryffindor.”
“Wow, Malfoy,” Harry said, “please, don’t hold back.”
“Stay,” Harry panted. “I promised your mum I’d keep you safe. Three days, that’s it.”
Malfoy considered Harry intently for a long moment before saying, “it doesn’t need to be addressed. Potter
Malfoy pulled the cock out of his mouth and it glistened wetly. “I love sucking cock,” he confided. “It gets me so hard. I love to feel and big, fat prick filling my throat.”
Harry finished his tea and stood. “I’m going to the Weasley’s. Should be back in an hour or so.”
“Kreacher!” Harry called.
“Good boy,” he said and then gave a sharp slap to Potter’s left nipple with his crop. Potter hissed. Draco smiled wickedly.
Slowly, Narcissa turned to Harry with murder in her eyes. “Did you do this on purpose?”
An uncomfortable twinge of guilt made him frown as he said, “I didn’t
Malfoy spluttered in outrage. “That is not what I meant, and you know it!”
After a few minutes, Potter blinked up at him and said, “wow.”
Harry made a face. “They play music.”
“In turn,” she said, “our establishment ensures absolute safety and a clean, sterile environment for all patrons.”
He left the kitchen stiffly, continuing all the way to his bedroom where he slammed the door behind him.
“Yes,” he said slowly. “Now, kindly rein in your magic.” Malfoy rubbed his arms uncomfortably and grabbed the teacup that was now floating by his shoulder.
Harry cleared his throat and intoned, “Draco Malfoy, we have reports that you are violating Wizarding Law.”
time.”
“Put your wand down, he’s not a threat.”
“And for you, sir?” the barista asked Malfoy brightly.
Harry slept poorly. Again. He’d tossed around for hours, punched his pillow several times, and could not find a comfortable position. Malfoy kept creeping into his thoughts as soon as he began to drift into sleep. Did the arsehole not care if he died? The stupid, buggering git was smarter than that. He’d been trying to ignore his ‘relapse’ and somehow still managed to dissect the Bugs
"Something wrong with that?"
“I go on break in a little while,” Mark said glancing between them.
here.”
A cultured, feminine voice softly filled the room. “Sir, Jim Roper has arrived for your 8 o’clock.”
Abruptly, Robards smirked, “might need to take another look at this one. You up for it?”
“He is?”
Harry’s thoughts chased each other until light began seeping through his window. Finally, he’d fallen into a deep, if troubled, sleep. He stayed asleep until noon, waking to daylight in his eyes. He showered and dressed without bumping into Malfoy and was glad of it.
“What? No!” Harry pushed his hair back. “Look, I wasn’t expecting him to stay either, but I guess I owe him something.”
With a final, frustrated rub of his eyes, Harry grabbed some Floo powder. “The Wheezing Wizard!” he yelled as he stuck his head into the fireplace.
It was totally normal. He was just wound up from last night. Mary really had been coming on to him pretty strongly, right? And when was the last time he'd been alone with Ginny? He just needed to get some release. That was all. It had nothing to do with Malfoy himself. So he had a nice arse? Plenty of people had nice arses.
“I have to get back to work, but what are you doing tomorrow night?”
“Back so soon?” Mark asked.
” Malfoy wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, “
Rolling his eyes again, Harry said, “he’ll have the same.” He considered Malfoy for a moment before adding, “with an extra espresso shot.”
Finally, Malfoy said, “um.”
Malfoy had his eyes on Harry again. His eyes flicked up and down then slid over to Mary. A slow, lecherous smile crept over his lips and lingered there before he looked back at Harry and smirked.
Malfoy shook his head with his mouth firmly shut. “Him now.”
Whussername – Jones, apparently – had been pretty useless that day. Harry would have had nightmares too if he’d let someone else do all the work. Her Life Detection Charm hadn’t noticed the cats, only confirmed that there were no humans inside. She’d just stared at him with wide, incredulous eyes when Harry said he was going to look for non-humans. It was their first and last call together. Good riddance.
“Not,” Malfoy interrupted, “that kind of noise.” He straddled Harry and ground his arse onto his lap. “I can feel your cock through all those layers of official ministry robes. You must be so hard. Did you enjoy watching me work?”
“You are so weird.” Malfoy shook his head. “Anyway… This thing doesn’t do anything!” He waved a muggle mobile at Harry accusingly.
Trying not to blurt out any of the questions that where shouting in his mind and squirming on the inside because he wasn’t glamoured, Harry aimed for confident as he said, “a pleasure to meet you. Can I get a mead?”
“I know, I know. But I think you’ll understand better if you see it for yourself. And if I don’t do it now, I’ll chicken out later.”
The memory turned grey and Harry felt himself being gently pushed out.
“Miss is gone? Oh, such a shame Kreacher is missing her.” He scanned the room to make sure Hermione wasn’t lurking anywhere.
in those few short moments. Oh shit, Malfoy could have asked
He looked again at Malfoy and warred with himself. Malfoy probably wouldn’t die once Kreacher was done, even without the house's help. But Narcissa thought he might be hurt again if he left. Seeing the git every day for several days sounded horrible. He was a nasty brat who had tried to make Harry’s life at Hogwarts miserable. The whole Death Eater thing also held a large amount of weight. One of Harry’s goals in life up until now was to stay the fuck away from Malfoy and his shitty, bigoted decisions.
In the sudden silence, Harry realized they were both standing and had been yelling across the table, faces barely a foot apart. Malfoy’s jaw was now hanging open, for once at a loss of something to snap back.
“I changed it.” Harry reached up to touch his now blond hair.
Robards was right, Harry ought to leave it alone.
He’d be so deep. He’d lean up and watch his cock slide out of them. Almost all the way. And then slide back in until he was completely sheathed again. In and out. Holding onto hips that met him with desperation, with need. Taking it with ease. Arching a pale back and suddenly slamming their round, full arse back onto Harry. No more slow glides. Hard and frantic. Crying out and taking Harry with them.
Instead, a fierce light shown through Roberts’ eyes and he simply said, “yes.”
He closed his eyes and breathed, willing his pulse back under control. There was no threat, no danger. Everything was okay. Harry opened his eyes as the vibrations slowed to a stop.
Malfoy took it wordlessly and, in a moment, he was gone.
Mrs. Weasley set another piece of tart in front of Victoire. “Of course you’re invited, dear. He’s your cousin.”
what was this? He should leave. This was weird and bizarre, and he didn’t know what to do with it. His skin felt too tight and alien and why was he breathing like he’d also run a race? With sudden shock and horror, Harry realized that his trousers were uncomfortable tight, and his inseam was digging painfully into his dick.
Harry strode over to the woman on the sofa as he said, “he’s being arrested be-
“I’m fine, Potter. It was mild at best. Your house elf fixed me some tea and now I feel fine.” He took a sip as if to prove how totally fine he was. “I don’t know what he added to it, but it worked wonders and I am fine.”
“Of course it’s you.” Malfoy was squinting at him funnily. “What the fuck happened to your hair?”
was suddenly watching and listening in.
With a decisive nod, Malfoy said, “Gringotts first. As amusing as it was to spend your money on drinks last night, I am no one’s kept boy.”
Harry slammed Malfoy down hard on his cock once, twice, and stilled with his cock still buried deeply inside him.
Her smile became seductive and she placed a hand on his arm where it was resting on the table. “What do you want to know?”
“So, is this a social call or something else?” Her voice was hopeful.
“I’m afraid you caught me while I was working,” Malfoy said casually.
“For fuck’s sake,” Harry said in exasperation. Striding over to the bedside, he ordered, “hey, get up!” He gave a sharp poke to where he thought Malfoy’s head might be. His only answer was a disgruntled snuffle.
“But –”
Seriously, these two couldn’t even handle a mild domestic disturbance call? Likely, the neighbor had heard a cat yowling, jumped to conclusions, and the people inside the yellow house where innocent as lambs.
“Coming right up.” He made their drinks and set them on the bar. “On the house,” he said with another wink.
Harry wanted to die.
Not sure if he wanted to know what Malfoy meant by ‘again,’ Harry turned back to his puzzle.
Determination renewed, Harry decided he had to see this through. Malfoy was up to something.
“Tea is already being in the sitting room. It is being
an adult, you know.”
Another book vibrated off the table and Malfoy shot a glare at the elf. Kreacher disappeared back behind the door with a squeak.
The smile faded and Harry was sure he’d misstepped somehow.
“Right, so,” Harry began with a sigh, “what do you remember?”
A nicely decorated and extremely cluttered room came into view. George stood up from a desk in the corner and smiled as he came over to his side of the fire. “How are the Ear-Bugs? Did they sync with the Brick? Was it too… tinny? To bass-y?”
Harry’s breath was coming faster as he watched, and his cock ached where it was trapped in his trousers. Malfoy was a beautiful, wanton thing, fucking his face and rolling his hips to meet the rhythm of his fist.
Harry seriously doubted that. His face was still regularly splashed across the front page of the Prophet.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Okay,” Harry replied slowly, “better question –
“I agree, but he made a lot of shitty decisions and pissed off a lot of people.”
and deemed everything ready.
Taking a deep breath, Harry squared his shoulders and headed to the beaded curtain.
“I can’t.”
Laboriously, Harry helped Malfoy out of the bathroom and to the pub’s exit. The cold air and sudden quiet hit Harry like a physical blow.
Bewildered, Harry said, “well, I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t need
Looking back at Curly Hair, Harry asked, “why was I called in? Looks simple enough. Just knock and see if anyone needs assistance.”
“But you weren’t. While I was gone. Earlier.”
The woman took her time between each smack of her stick. She would look around the room, fix her gaze on someone and watch them as they watched Malfoy being spanked. When her eyes found Harry, his breath caught in his chest. What was she looking for? What made her smile and lick her lips as recognition sparked in her eyes? Why had she stopped using her stick?
Malfoy moaned loudly as the finger pressed all the way in. He started sliding it in and out and second finger quickly joined the first. Malfoy began rocking back onto his fingers in time to the cock he was sliding in and out of his mouth.
Harry felt his own prick swell when Malfoy loosely clasped the base of his cock, holding it while he fondled his balls. He rubbed them back and forth, rolled them, and then let a finger slip behind to stroke his perineum. He was at full hardness now and Harry’s felt his mouth go dry.
“Nev, you don’t have to –”
She smiled back wickedly. “Ah, Harry lad, if I was but ten years younger…” She’d still be old enough to be his great-great-grandmother and Harry fought not to let his smile slip.
He didn’t need to be told twice. He practically threw himself at Draco’s prick and swallowed it greedily. Draco thrust up into his willing mouth while Potter’s fingers squelched wetly in and out of his hole. It was the most erotic sight of Draco’s life and, given his profession, that was saying something.
“It’s almost curfew, Ms. Weasley. A pretty, young girl like you shouldn’t be out so late.” There was a glint in Amycus’ eye that made Harry’s stomach clench with dread and disgust. “Perhaps I should escort you myself.”
As he made to stand, a door slammed in the distance. Harry’s head whipped to the source and he suddenly felt dizzy with recognition. A man moved from one door and slipped into the other one in less than a second, and it’d been years since he’d seen it, but Harry would know that white blonde hair anywhere.
Draco waited a moment then stood and rounded his desk. He stopped in front of the other man, invading his space, and considered him from a closer perspective. Jim’s hair was a dusky blond, almost brown, and could probably be called curly if it grew longer. He wore a pair of muggle jeans and a plain black V-neck. The firm looking biceps stretching the shirt’s material promised a fit body underneath. Draco itched to find out if he was right.
“Auror Potter,” Curly gasped, eyes wide with surprise as Harry continued his banging, “isn’t that a bit much?”
Alecto cocked a questioning eyebrow at Ginny and asked, “what’ll it be?”
“Harry?”
There was a woman lying on the sofa, apparently asleep, but Harry didn’t turn his back to her as he shouted at the man, “where is your accomplice? Who are you working with?”
A truly scandalized and horrified expression filled Malfoy’s face.
Harry continued to pace. “No one can be that cool and composed. He was trying to bait me; I know he was.”
Malfoy rose briefly to turn around on his armchair and offer up his arse. “It’s even better when I’m being fucked. Sucking on cock with another hard cock in my tight arsehole.” Harry saw him deftly use his wand to surreptitiously coat his fingers in lube. He rested an elbow on the back of the armchair and started sucking the plastic cock again. He reached back and slid a finger into his arse.
“Thanks,” Harry said sarcastically. “I gotta go.”
“Ma’am,” Malfoy interrupted, “if you’d allow me –”
Malfoy wasn't having it. “You didn’t ask Potter.”
“Good, good. She’s hinting that she’s going to retire soon.” A look of horror crossed Neville’s face. “She keeps having me teach classes. I’m just an apprentice. I’m not ready to be a professor.”
Harry got an arched eyebrow in return. “Potter,” Malfoy said, “I’m taller than you and your clothes are too big for
Harry smirked. “No worse than you.”
“I is so glad Master Harry is bring the young Master Malfoy to the sitting room to rest since he is
“I’m sure he won’t mind.”
Hermione.” He turned to Malfoy. “And I hear you’re the reason why.”
With ice in her voice, Narcissa asked, “why do you smell like a distillery?” Her eyes unfairly focused on Harry, as though it was his fault the stupid idiot couldn’t hold his liquor.
With a frustrated noise, Roberts’ calm cracked just a little. “Truth be told, Pricilla had the real control the entire time. It’s all about perception, Auror Potter.”
Trying not to let his grin show, he said, “I’ll show you.” He pushed away his uneaten eggs and gestured for Malfoy to follow him.
Perhaps one of the many Voldemort sympathizers who'd fled the country after his defeat had returned? The Malfoys were not popular among that bunch. While nearly everyone else had had to run or face Azkaban, the Malfoys had been able to hunker down and weather the storm. Well, except for Lucius. Harry had been called to testify for each of the Malfoys and, while his testimony had helped keep Narcissa and Draco out of Azkaban, it had utterly damned Lucius.
After a few more moments of puttering around the kitchen, Kreacher addressed Harry again in a softer voice, “I is thinking that Master Harry is also needing good tea.” He placed a cup in front of Harry with a kind expression. “You is looking very upset about Master Draco’s hurting.” He patted Harry on the shoulder and then followed the levitating tea tray out of the room.
Harry heard himself whimper.
George tilted his head to the side. “The Bugs are designed to default to the volume of your mind. Maybe the feedback of…? No. The input can’t exceed… Huh, maybe it could.  I’m going to need to measure -” He got up and started to head back to his desk.
“I mean it, Potter. Follow procedure.”
“He will be fine. I’ve already mended the worst of it. Kreacher will do everything that is needed, and then Draco will just need to rest.” She smoothed Malfoy’s bloody hair back from his forehead. “Thank you, Mr. Potter.”
“And how are you going to do that?” Harry snapped. “You’ve found nothing.
Malfoy when the woman pulled out her wand and pointed it at Malfoy.
“I was not!” Malfoy said indignantly. “What do you mean ‘information’? You were on a date!”
“Nothing much. The details are boring,” Harry evaded. He leaned forward as she had and said, “I’d much rather talk about you.”
Harry sprinted for the back door. He grabbed Kreacher by the shoulders and demanded, “same as yesterday?”
“What exactly do you do for work?” Harry asked in confusion. “And since when do you know how to use a computer?”
Anger flashed across her face. “Fine. But I
Leaning back in his chair, Draco looked down his nose as Jim entered. The man paused just beyond the threshold and startled as the door banged shut behind him. Draco watched silently as Jim Roper looked around the room and realized that other than Draco’s chair, the sofa was the only other available seating option. He shifted uncertainly from foot to foot.
“Potter!”
Eyebrows drawing down, Robards narrowed his eyes. “Half of your body looked like charcoal. The rest was covered in blisters. I’m told Jones is still seeing a mind healer about nightmares.”
Harry saw Malfoy hanging back from the crowd and walked over to him. He didn’t say anything, just stood next to Malfoy and, when it was time, sang the Happy Birthday song. Malfoy was shooting looks at Harry from the corner of his eye, but otherwise didn’t acknowledge him.
“How d’you know Uncle Harry?”
“Weasley Number Four. Or is it Five? Never could tell you all apart,” Malfoy drawled, pretending to examine his nails.
“If you won’t dance with me, I’m sure he will.” She indicated Malfoy.
It was a relief to unlace his trousers and pull himself out. His eyes fluttered shut on the first slow stroke he gave himself. He worked himself up and down leisurely for a few minutes. Opening his eyes again, he found Potter avidly following the movement of his hand and his cock at full hardness.
“Come in! Stop standing on me fecking doorstep!”
“I know.”
Silence.
drag you out of there.”
The challenge was clear, and Harry felt his ire rise. The shot he’d taken had spread just enough warmth through his system to give him the courage to stand. He strode toward Malfoy as though drawn by a magnet. Mary was next to him, already rocking her hips to the beat.
Malfoy’s eyebrows didn’t seem to know what to do, but his little smile was back.
“Of course, dear. But what’s happened?”
Lightly muscled, a V formed in the shape of his shoulders down to his low-slung trousers. Harry could just barely make out the trail of hair leading down from his navel.
“He might hide the good tea again,” Malfoy speculated darkly.
Rules? Approached for what? What was off-putting? Harry felt like he was missing a huge part of the conversation but tried not to let it show as he casually asked, “what did he want to play?”
Definitely long fingers and a firm grip. Not too small. He liked the idea of being encompassed by someone else’s touch. A hand that could grasp him with heat and surety, move boldly just how Harry liked.
“Mum,” George said, coming around the corner, “ew.”
Again, Harry blinked. Her son? Malfoy? Draco Malfoy? The body she held couldn’t be him. It was too small, too… broken. The limbs looked twisted and misshapen, the fabric covering the limp form too ragged and torn.
“And then he died.” She gave a soft chuckle and her eyes grew distant. “T’wasn’t even me that got to kill him.”
Malfoy looked away first and muttered sardonically, “wouldn’t want that.” He went back to his stacks of books and parchment, apparently choosing to pretend that Harry no longer existed.
“Good boy.” Draco pulled slowly out and then slammed back in. He grabbed Potter’s hips and pressed his thumbs into those divots he’d noticed earlier as he fucked into him. He was on fire and so was Potter. The wet heat surrounding him had him matching the other man moan for moan. Potter’s strong thighs were working to meet every thrust in a hard, fast rhythm of slapping skin.
Sunlight poured in through the open window and across Harry’s pillows, hitting him right in the face. This, and the sound of birds squawking, prompted Harry to bury his head under the blankets. The blankets were too hot, but the air was too cold on his sweat dampened skin to push them aside. With an irritated sigh, Harry flung them down and greeted the beautiful fucking morning.
Ah, someone was at the door. Harry had forbidden Kreacher from answering himself because of an incident involving a singing telegram, a bubble charm, and a witch wearing only a few strategically placed tassels. Harry was still suspicious that had been George’s doing.
He didn’t find her there or Mark who, presumably, was on his break.
Harry decided to change directions. “How did you find me? My house is Unplottable.”
Harry did. He cried, “
From down the hall, a muffled, “fuck off,” was yelled back from a neighbor.
Together, they went to the kitchen. Kreacher glanced over from where he was placing two bowls on the table and did a doubletake. “Master Harry!” he exclaimed. “You is not looking like you.”
Sitting awkwardly at the bar, Harry was wishing he hadn’t come. He was used to people staring at him, but here, it felt different. Usually, he’d get a slight widening of eyes, a quick look up at his scar, and then people would generally move on. Here, it started the same, but then whomever had recognized him would give a small conspiring smile, like they suddenly had a secret, before turning away. It was unnerving.
Potter had a dirty, filthy mouth. Draco had to close his eyes to block out the words and the images they conjured.
“Wait, I wanted to ask about the fellyfones with the lines. Do owls travel through the strings? Is that what they’re for? How does that work if there are no strings?”
“Anything you think I might be interested in?”
“Yes, Sir.”
Bringing books and parchment with him, Malfoy joined him in the kitchen. While Kreacher cooked, it was silent except for the sound of flipping pages and the occasional
“You have an Invisibility Cloak,” Malfoy pointed out, “bit hard for others to compete with that.”
the Great Harry Potter can’t even fill Life Debts like a fucking
him. I don’t
“Yeah, okay.”
“Mother,” Malfoy’s voice greeted from behind Harry.
Kreacher popped back in with an armload of supplies and several hovering potion vials. “I is healing the young master and cleaning away the blood. Kreacher is knowing how to mend wounds and will stop the hurt.”
Harry felt his heart rate speed just a bit as he sat down.
“Of course not, dear. Harry! It’s good to see you.” She enveloped him in a hug. “How are you?”
“About –”
“Don’t fuck with your hair,” Malfoy yelled into his ear. “I’m going to the bar.” He slipped through the crowd and disappeared.
Steeling himself, Harry whispered, “
“Yes, well,” Harry said, “do you know who attacked him?”
up to something!”
When Harry entered with Malfoy, he could feel the bass in his chest. A few heads turned their direction and followed them as they made their way inside. Feeling self-conscious, Harry reached up to pat his hair.
Harry’s eyes lit up with glee as he waited for the sound to assault Malfoy. Nothing happened. “Did you tap the note?”
Harry looked into his empty pint and gestured to the bartended. The wizard broke off his conversation with a wink to the witches and sauntered over to Harry.
“Of course you did.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Which teams?”
The heaviness in the air left and Harry felt a small jolt of…
Harry spun around and stared at the wall. Clearing his throat, he croaked, “your mum is here.” With that, he strode out of the room without looking back and slammed the door behind him.
Losing all patience, Harry grabbed the edge of a blanket and pulled. The lazy sod must have been laying on a portion of the blanket though, because all Harry managed to do was reveal an arm before meeting resistance.
and blew a stream of Firewhiskey smoke toward the ceiling. “I’m going to dance,” he announced and then sauntered away.
Astonishingly, Malfoy stopped in the middle of the platform and gracefully dropped to his knees, eyes locked on the floor. The woman in boots walked a few slow circles around him and he never looked up. As she completed her third circuit, she stopped behind him and petted his hair. She gripped his hair and yanked back so suddenly, Harry let out a surprised gasp.
“My name’s Mark, by the way.” Mark gave one last wink and headed back to the bar.
Fuck, right there!”
“What happened? What’s wrong?” Harry’s heart was beating rapidly, and his chest heaved as he came skidding to a stop in the doorway.
“Potter,” Malfoy said with false patience, “I still have a headache from my hangover, my mother just took a
Harry watched the people around the room closely. They seemed like normal, everyday people relaxing at the end of a workweek. Couples sat closely, gazing at each other happily. Singles lounged casually, watching the room, probably hoping to pull. Every so often, the back doors opened to let people enter or exit. Harry assumed one of the doors led to a bathroom. A small line waited outside it and no one stayed inside longer than a few minutes.
“Goodbye, George.” Harry pulled his head out of the fire and tapped the Bugs. They fell out. He looked down at the spider-like devices with a grimace. He tossed them onto the kitchen table and sat down heavily. “User friendly, my arse,” he grumbled while staring at the Bugs hatefully.
“Okay, good.” Forcing cheer into her voice, she continued, “I’m going to go say hello to Andromeda. I’ll see you later, yeah? Just the two of us?”
“Of course not. She’s mine.” Roberts’ smirk bloomed full force in a self-satisfied way.
“No.”
“Seems there was an accomplice this time. Average height, dark hair, mostly obscured. Not much to go on.” Robards looked Harry in the eye menacingly.
Neville cleared his throat and croaked, “I think so. But not quickly.”
looked away and wore a happy, wistful expression. She caught Harry’s eye and whispered, “I’m going to have another grandbaby within a year, mark my words.”
“No, you just made it physically impossible for me to go anywhere without you. And don’t get me started on what it probably means that my mere presence will fulfill a Life Debt.”
Draco made a swift decision before his moment of shocked revelation could be noticed. He was going to fuck Harry Potter. Hard. And Potter was going to fucking love it.
Laughing, Mary said, “so you’re responsible for this?” She indicated Harry’s head.
Narcissa rounded on him and Harry was infinitely glad he’d won the silent contest. She fixed Malfoy with her sharpest look yet and arched a dangerous eyebrow.
Mouth open to say – something, Harry went very still and waited for the inevitable outcry. He didn’t wait long.
That was what Harry was counting on. Emilia Fawley was a treasure trove of information, gossip, and rumor. Harry was almost glad she’d trapped him into dancing with her a few years ago at Percy’s wedding, even if she had managed to wring him dry of everything he’d witnessed during the Battle of Hogwarts in just those few minutes of awkward shuffling.
Harry put his hands over his face and slid down the wall. He stayed there until Kreacher found him.
Kreacher wrinkled his nose and scowled. “I is learning.”
The man next to Neville stepped forward and Harry recognized Amycus Carrow. There was a cruel look on his face as he eyed Ginny up and down.
Nothing happened.
Harry decided to Apparate several blocks from his house and take a long walk home. He mulled over Emilia’s parting words with frustration. She’d known it was him at the pub. Did her grandniece know she’d blown a kiss at Harry Potter or was Emilia playing her cards close to the chest? Was she having him followed? How many aliases did she know about?
He tightened his hold on Malfoy’s head and slid his cock back into red, swollen lips. He fought himself for control, not wanting to choke Malfoy. When Malfoy moaned on a harder thrust, Harry stopped trying to be gentle. He fucked into his mouth and Malfoy took it. Again and again, Harry felt his cock slip down that tight throat.
“No!” Harry protested. “George is branching in new directions. They were in my ears yesterday, weren’t they? I’m fine. My brain wasn't eaten even a little.”
Malfoy tilted his head to scrutinize Harry. With a cruel twist of his mouth, he said, “no,” and reached for the doorknob.
Malfoy pulled himself off the floor. “You’re an Auror?”
“Yes, Sir.” It came out on a hiss of breath.
Glitter Face shrugged and hopped off the barstool. “Suit yourself. But if you ever decide you want to play…” He left the sentence unfinished as he sauntered away.
In the tense, prolonged silence that followed, Harry didn’t know what to do. Malfoy was involved in something. Again. The pang of disappointment Harry felt was a surprise. The anger was not. Fucking Malfoy. Always being the cause of his own downfall. And still, Harry had to help the stupid arse. Harry reminded himself that this was not the time to be thinking about arses.
What the
“You wanted to do this. Ask the fucking questions.” Harry was losing his patience and his head was starting to hurt. Hermione’s insistence that they use Veritaserum was rubbing him the wrong way. God knew where she’d gotten it on such short notice. He was tired, grumpy, and every woman in his life seemed to think he needed to be protected from himself. He was a goddamned adult, thank you very much.
“You is telling Kreacher to burn it.”
“It’s not too loud?” Harry asked disappointedly.
After long minutes, Malfoy finished with his hair and nodded in satisfaction. Distractedly, he brought a hand up to tilt Harry’s jaw. Malfoy’s fingers were steady and warm on his face, his eyes focused while he studied Harry’s angles. He muttered a few soft spells and then ran his hand up Harry’s cheek, smoothing over the tingly places he’d spelled. His thumb glided over Harry’s cheekbone in what felt like a caress and Harry uncomfortably cleared his throat.
“Yes, it does. And they are still intact. I wouldn’t even have known Draco was attacked if they hadn’t thrown a rock through one of the windows.”
“That is
Continuing, Malfoy picked up a different bit, “the spell matrix is spread too thin, causing a tinny resonance.”
Curly was whisper shouting, “- absolutely no proof! A broken pot isn’t evidence!”
“Neighbor, Gladys Periwinkle, called it in. Says she heard a woman screaming. That was about thirty minutes ago, no disturbance since. No prior calls for this address, no records for either of the occupants. Average locking charms on the doors, no dark magic detected, and no wards.” The Auror scanned his notepad before nodding to himself. The nod caused a lock of his curly brown hair fall over an equally brown eye and Harry wanted to flick it out of the way. Honestly, how was he going to focus on the job if his vision was obstructed? Totally unprofessional. That’s why they had grooming standards.
“Enlighten me,” Harry hissed, leaning forward.
“Whatever, Malfoy.” Harry looked at the mess on the table and floor. “What is all this?”
Breathing and heartrate back under control, Draco summoned a robe, put it on and tied it in place. Potter was still breathing harshly, eyes glazed in afterglow. Draco sat down and pulled Potter’s head onto his lap, stroking his hair while he came back to himself.
“Hard.”
A pointed clearing of the throat made him stop and turn back. Red Lips wiggled a finger at her face and arched an expectant eyebrow.
“Good.” Draco released his grip and said, “take off your shirt.”
“No case –!”
Three hours later, Harry had left instructions for Kreacher to watch Malfoy and was sitting in a pub in London. Ursa's Pride was a newer establishment and on weekend nights, was usually packed full of young witches and wizards. At just after noon on a Thursday, it was almost empty. The 20-something wizard behind the bar was chatting with a pair of smartly dressed witches, and a few blokes huddled around a table next to the empty dance floor.
Harry swallowed. “Who?”
Harry winced.
George laughed, clapped Harry on the shoulder and mourned, “it’s a shame I’ll need to abandon the spider design. Ron shrieked when I tried to show him how to use them.”
Harry tensed as the bead curtain jangled closed behind him. The sudden music jolted his senses, and his eyes took several uncomfortable seconds to adjust in the dim lighting. He knew that all it took was a moment of disorientation and
With intensity, Harry said, “I promised your mum -”
Less than an hour later, Malfoy was spewing a constant stream of muttered bitching in Harry’s ear.
Draco looked down and watched himself sliding in and out of those red lips. It was almost too much. Potter was hungry for it and Draco could see his leaking cock bobbing between his legs on every out stroke.
“Emilia,” Harry tried his most winning smile, “I’m trying to help. I would like nothing more than to hear the truth stated plainly.”
“That stuff in the fancy bottle… in the bathroom?” Harry said hesitantly, “it smells nice.”
? Whatever it was, Harry was immensely glad for it. The alternative was too mortifying to contemplate.
“Oh, did they –? Of course they did.
Malfoy was on his knees, holding his head.
Malfoy’s face fell. “Merlin’s saggy fucking testicles,” he swore as he started pacing again. “Before you tried to stop me from leaving, how did you feel then?”
“No. And that is why we are leaving for the continent. Right now.” The command in her voice refused disobedience. “Come along, Draco.”
“Ginny!” Harry grabbed her arm and dragged her away. “Can I see you in the kitchen?”
Harry’s knees almost gave out.
“You could have died!”
And just like that, Harry was alone again. Sighing in annoyance, he took a drink of the pint Malfoy had brought him. He was pleased to find that it was the same blond ale he’d ordered for himself yesterday.
Narcissa’s tense posture relaxed a fraction. She smoothed Malfoy’s hair once more before standing. Sighing, she paused a moment before saying softly to Harry, “I don’t know who did this.”
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Harry but followed Kreacher toward the sitting room with an irritated swish of her robes.
Squinting harder, Malfoy then asked darkly, “what the fuck is in your ears?”
Malfoy’s prick wasn’t fully hard but was well on its way. It sat amid well-groomed, blond curls and Harry waited for him to grasp it. Instead, Malfoy moved passed without touching it to caress his inner thigh. His long fingers just barely grazed his bollocks and his cock plumped further.
Willis shook his curly head and gave a disgusted sigh as he stomped off. Harry really did try to wipe the smirk off his face.
Harry threw his head back and just moved.
They were just pajamas, he told himself, and Kreacher would have washed them anyway. It wasn’t weird. Malfoy probably didn’t usually wear pajamas in any case. Harry hadn’t noticed any missing sets. Probably slept naked.
Malfoy was sitting in an armchair, a cup of tea balanced precariously on the arm. Books and parchment were strewn over the surface of the table amid little bits of – plastic? Harry scanned for threats and found none.
Wiping a shaky hand across his mouth, Malfoy answered, “three more shots. And then… You know… went into the gent’s…”
Malfoy smiled wickedly. “And I’ve been a bad boy, have I?”
“You don’t?” Neville had his head cocked to the side in interest.
“I don’t see how that be any of your fecking business,” she responded bluntly. She sipped her tea daintily to cover a smile and did nothing to hide the challenge in her eyes.
“God, yes.”
A mischievous idea formed in Harry’s mind. Hermione had been pretty rough on him, but Malfoy’d tried to get in a few shots of his own. And Harry wasn’t going to
“Good boy. Take off your trousers and go kneel in front of the sofa.”
“But that’s not hate.”
Harry’s discomfort grew with every passing moment. To give himself something to do, he made himself a cup of tea. He almost spilled the whole thing down his front when Malfoy sucked in a ragged breath a few moments later. Looking up, Harry saw that Malfoy was looking at the floor again and Narcissa was blinking rapidly at her son.
Harry took dinner in his study and slept poorly that night. He was accustomed to sharing the house with Kreacher, but knowing another person was there, his brain kept listening for sounds of confirmation. Malfoy didn’t make much noise. The bathroom door opened and closed a few times and the door to the guestroom creaked once. But Harry
“You need to be taught a lesson too I see.
Less than five minutes later, Harry was at the Weasley’s kitchen table again, eating lemon tart while sitting next to Draco Malfoy and he was actually enjoying it.
“Yes, Mistress,” Kreacher intoned with another deep bow. “Kreacher is taking good care of Master Draco while he is here. He is having plenty of rest and good tea. Last night, Kreacher is making sure he is comfortable.”
“Uh, I don’t think so, anyway.”
my mother healed what she could.”
“No.”
– flew open. Malfoy immediately locked onto Harry and he came with a shout.
Breathing harshly, Harry said with feeling, “
Harry stopped feeling quite so claustrophobic.
Emilia cackled gleefully. “She did not say it, but you be confirming it.”
"It was nothing. Barely worth mentioning," Harry lied.
It didn’t stop until there was blood dripping onto the girl’s uniform. Alecto gave a satisfied nod and said, “now the others.”
of practice.”
him. I just kind of… ended up with him.”
Jim took a deep breath and complied, his eyes trained on the expensive rug.
Alecto turned back to Ginny and raised her wand threateningly. “Now… where were we?”
changing by accident. He was getting better, but emotions tended to loosen his control. At least he hadn’t recently gotten lost again because he’d wandered off while looking like a completely different child. And God,
Harry felt Malfoy’s grip on his wrist tighten and his other hand landed on Harry’s hip. “Stop thinking,” he said again. “Just move. It’s like flying.”
“Right? Hard to believe we were ever that little. How’s Sprout?”
Roberts said nothing and only offered the barest suggestion of a companionable smirk.
And his cock
Malfoy scowled at him and Narcissa shook her head slowly. “No,” she said, “I tried as soon as I healed him. The memory is gone. He was Obliviated and whoever did it knew what they were doing.”
“It runs on electricity. All the magic in the house interferes with it so it won’t work here.”
Potter’s cock gave a little jump and he had to swallow before he said, “yes, Sir.”
Harry was showing himself out when she stopped him. “And Harry lad? Do be sure to thank me grandniece if you see her again, for that drink she bought you at the pub today.” She winked at him as the door closed in his face.
“It’s the Malfoy boy, isn’t it?” Bugger.
Smiling teasingly, Malfoy pointed at the computer, “the internet.”
Malfoy didn’t answer, just looked at Harry like he was an idiot.
“It’s like a muggle mobile.” This clearly meant nothing to Malfoy who stared at him without comprehension. Harry continued anyway, “well, it
“You were arguing. I heard you. Did you know those kids where behind that tapestry?”
Bonelessly, they lay back in the armchair, waiting for their breathing to slow.
Once alone with Malfoy, Harry watched him as he walked up to Neville.
a twat.” Malfoy stood abruptly and pulled Harry’s shirt over his head. He threw it at Harry and said, “there, better now?”
Irritation prickled Harry’s skin. “I’m not trying to save him. He’d probably hex me if I did.”
“Got it,” Harry said. “What’s the area like?”
Potter licked his lips and re-positioned himself. His eyes fluttered as he reached back and slipped a finger in. “I want your cock in me right now. I want it to stretch me wide. I want to feel it for days.” He groaned, and Draco could tell he’d already added a second finger.
Ginny stepped out, absentmindedly brushing soot off her dress. “Hi, Harry. Everything alright?” She came to stand next to him and touched his hair.
Malfoy looked up and his eyes cleared. “Yes. Fine now.” His eyes narrowed as he asked accusingly, “why did you take that hex?”
“Kreacher is maybe finding some,” he said doubtfully.
The door closed on wide, shocked, bright green eyes.
“You can touch me, if you like.”
She turned to Harry and asked with only slightly less venom, “why was he
Harry gave a rough chuckle and asked, “can’t it be both?”
“We’re old chums from way back. Poor bastard can’t even do his hair without me.”
Harry came out of his daze enough to loudly address Kreacher, irritation heavily lacing his words, “burn the sitting room sofa when you get a chance.”
“Nice,” Harry said appreciatively.
Harry looked away from their exchange of heated gazes back to Mrs. Weasley who had
“You grew up muggle, right? Their technology is all over this one and I need someone who’s familiar with ekricity.” Robards pushed the file at Harry and ordered, “get over there and figure out if this is a real case. Misuse was vague on the details. I’ll expect a report when you get back.”
“Yes, you!” Malfoy leaned forward, fists clenched. “You think I need you to protect me from your womenfolk? Especially the littlest Weasel?” In a high-pitch, he mocked, “
“Yes, I mean… I think so?”
Looking at the floor, Malfoy said, “I’m not hiding anything.”
“I didn’t ask you to be here!”
“Good boy.”
Malfoy snorted.
Thinking of George, Harry took a moment to jot down some quick notes for him while he waited for his hearing to become more reliable.
Harry’s prickly feeling of discomfort was interrupted by Kreacher. “Sirs,” he said as he came into the room, “an Owl is coming.”
Fuck. Narcissa was in his sitting room right now. Malfoy was (hopefully?) getting dressed to join her. Harry needed to stop thinking about arses and leave the bathroom. A quick refocusing on his reflection showed that his flush was gone. If anything, he was a bit pale, eyes a little too wide. He splashed himself with cold water again. It was fine. He was fine. An arse was an arse. Nothing special.
almost died.”
“Look –”
Frustrated, Harry swept the surrounding street for movement. Nothing. And none of his spells had hit a target.
“Cat images,” George confirmed succinctly. “Portable, loops lasting much longer than photographs can manage, with
Harry was going to argue anyway. “Yesterday, you had broken bones and your brain was bleeding. What if Kreacher missed something when he was healing you?”
Neville was looking at him oddly, “no, I mean, have you talked about what Hogwarts was like?”
“Tattle-tell,” Malfoy hissed.
As the ringing faded, Harry dropped his quill and headed for the door. Who would be knocking? Grimmauld Place was even more heavily warded now because of the tassel woman, and his friends would have just Floo’ed or walked right in.
In that moment, Draco broke his only rule. He grabbed Potter round the middle and pulled him up to his chest, jerked his head to the side and kissed him, open mouthed and filthy. The new angle made Potter yell louder and Draco snaked his other hand down his chest to find his cock. He jerked it roughly while fucking up into Potter’s tight hole.
Malfoy flinched like he’d been hit. Eyes still trained on the floor, he said, “it’s nothing to be concerned about, I swear.”
Harry did not want to hear the end of that sentence. “Shut it, Malfoy.” To Hermione he said, “it’s a temporary arrangement. He’ll be gone in a few days.”
Roberts’ voice from over a month ago drifted through his mind,
Emilia clicked her tongue. “Fecking bird. Useless and blind as me late husband, bless his fecking soul.” She waved her wand over a nearby tea set and the kettle immediately started steaming. “Do not just be standing there, my boy. Come pour us some tea and you can tell me what you want.”
Harry hastily stood. “I think it’s time we headed back. Thank you for having us over, Mrs. Weasley.”
Malfoy looked up from where he’d been sitting at the table with his head in his hands. His miserable expression changed to surprise. “You have a date?” he smirked, eyes sparkling. “Whatever would the littlest Weasley think?”
“No.” Malfoy seemed to wilt and went back to his half-eaten eggs. He chewed slowly, swallowed and looked up at Harry. “Your hair looks rather fetching today,” he said and then shoveled an enormous forkful of eggs into his mouth and took an obscenely long time to chew it into submission. “These eggs are delicious.”
Harry ignored the dig. “There is no hint out there of who did it. I’ve been looking. Even Emilia Fawley has no information. Yes,” he raised a hand to forestall Narcissa’s interruption, “she told me you went to see her.”
“I, uh, thank you,” Harry fumbled, “but I think perhaps I’m not? Going to do that. I mean, touch you, that is.”
“Yes, Sir. So good.” Potter’s voice was needy and desperate.
was the place?
“She didn’t know. But I told her you could stay here while she figured it out.”
Harry deflated. Stupid Bugs.
“He’s sleeping,” Harry said. “I’ll, um, go get him.” Harry did not want to be the one to break the news of the second Debt if she’d not been able to find who’d attacked Malfoy. He waved Narcissa inside and closed the door behind her.
Behind him, Harry heard his fireplace roar to life.
Harry felt himself racing toward climax.
"Ursa's?" Malfoy asked as they arrived. "You're bringing your date here? To Ursa's Pride?"
“To what purpose? The old families be minding their own fecking business these days. You looking to stir up trouble?” She arched a haughty eyebrow at him.
“Enough,” Robards raised his hands for silence. “Harry, I’m giving you one chance. Stop smirking! Taylor is going in with you. At the merest hint that you are about to get out of line, I’ll have him pull you out.”
“The Cannons and the Harpies,” Harry answered. “I was going to get the Tornadoes, but Ginny told me to go with the Harpies instead. She’s hoping to play for them.”
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. Teddy likes kid stuff? What did you do when you were five?”
With a sigh, he got up and went to search for Mary at the bar. Maybe she’d gone for another drink.
“Hands and knees. Now.”
Harry huffed a small laugh and accepted the serving of cake that was handed to him. He passed it to Malfoy and said, “just so you know, I don’t think you’re completely horrible.”
With childish glee, Harry opened a bottle of Never Popping Bubbles and blew into the wand. He made small bubbles that shifted colors as they floated around the room. With a bit of trying, he figured out how to blow bigger bubbles. Soon, the room was full of multicolored bubbles of varying sizes.
” as he pulsed deep inside him. He felt Malfoy coming too. His hole clenched around Harry and he shouted a strangled curse.
In truth, Harry wanted them to see if there were any new donors to the organization Mary worked for. If there were, they might be someone new on the muggle support scene.
The git slowly lifted a hand to his hair before understanding filtered into his eyes. Looking chagrined and slightly embarrassed, he waved a quick
Breath coming quicker, Harry reached down with his other hand to cup his tightening bollocks.
“Figures,” Harry muttered to himself. To Narcissa he said, “is there anything else you need? A Healer…?”
It was nothing like flying. People where all around him, he felt closed in, and everything was loud.
That had been just one moment during that year. At the time, Harry had been too consumed by the horcrux hunt and running to really think about the students at Hogwarts beyond wistfully imagining the tables full of food in the Great Hall. In the intervening years, he’d been too wrapped up in everything else and trying to just move on from that terrifying year.
“About that…” Without finishing, Malfoy started pacing.
Kreacher appeared with a pop and smiled brightly at Malfoy. “Kreacher will put on a pot of good tea.” He took the pot already on the table and dumped it’s almost full contents down the sink. “There is being no need for this one anymore.”
Poking his head further out his door, Malfoy looked up and down the hallway. “We?”
Waving a dismissive hand, Malfoy said, “don’t be stupid. I won’t go as me. You can go on your date and I’ll find a nice quiet corner to drown myself in.”
“You were so deep in my throat. I want it even deeper in my arse.” He pushed Harry back toward to the armchair until the backs of his legs thumped into it. He kissed Harry with his filthy mouth and moaned into it. They kissed sloppily, tongues and nipping teeth.
“Fine,” Harry said in exasperation. Malfoy looked surprised and Harry wondered if he’d been trying to bluff.
“It is not being for you.” Kreacher’s tone was just this side of insolent. With a flourish, he presented the letter to Malfoy.
Malfoy’s eyes were closed, and he made no move to resist. The woman looked intently at his face and tugged harder, making Malfoy’s back arch to follow the pull. Fist still tight in his hair, she leaned down to whisper in his ear. Without hesitation, Malfoy’s hands rose to the collar of his shirt. Harry’s mouth dropped open in shock as Malfoy smoothly moved down his shirt, undoing each button as he went. When the last button was undone, the woman pulled Malfoy to his feet by the hair. He went easily and kept his eyes closed.
Silence.
“That looks nothing like me,” Harry declared knowing that it absolutely did.
“It’s good to see you, Emilia.” Harry ducked as a blur of green feathers barreled toward his head. “You too, Eustace.”
“I can’t, “Malfoy repeated. In a rush he said, “we accidently triggered my Life Debt to Potter. I have to stay with him until we know who attacked me.”
“Unbelievable,” Malfoy said in exasperated amazement. “You
Taylor was grabbing at his hair like he wanted to tear it out by the roots. “Neither Williams or I could find any traces.”
Harry was quickly trying to regain his bearings. Small details were filtering though. A framed piece of artwork depicting a woman’s provocative silhouette hung over the sofa, a vase in the corner held large feathers rather than flowers, and to his left was a doorway covered by a bead curtain that he should’ve been able to see through.
Harry nursed his drink over the next half hour before getting up to leave. Mark the bartender gave him a wave and another wink on his way out.
Harry was trying to re-ground himself by focusing into his Butterbeer bottle when he felt someone sit next to him. Looking up, Harry saw a slim young man smiling shyly at him.
George started asking questions in rapid succession, none of which Harry even understood. Thankfully, Bill and Fleur knew their stuff and rattled off answer after answer.
to help me with
answers the same questions.”
Still half sitting, Harry shifted his attention back to Malfoy. Eyes still closed, still standing, still trembling, and… oh.
Malfoy sneered. “My mum would not have – Wait, I was injured?” His eyes widened. “She evoked the Debt, didn’t she?”
“But what about –”
“Where were you?” Harry barked.
Malfoy looked from the cup to him in surprise and said warily, “that’s it? ‘Okay’? No further interrogation or suspicion?”
“It was
Feeling deflated, Harry said, “Emilia, give me something here. I just want to figure out what happened.”
Shoulders slumping, Malfoy sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Before you agreed, but after she stated her terms, what did you feel?”
Malfoy stopped struggling and ogled at Harry. Abruptly, he laughed and said, “he helped me unzip them.”
Malfoy continued walking until he’d passed Harry. Harry looked back at Ginny just in time to see her wand twitch in Malfoy’s direction. Without pausing to think, Harry stepped between them and jerked as a Stinging Hex hit him full in the chest.
thinking about arses.
Sooo tight.” Holding onto the back of the armchair, he sank all the way down. He held himself still for a moment and then began working his hips slowly up and down.
Books, parchment, and the bits on the table were slowly bouncing their way to the floor. It was like the table had been set on a running muggle clothes dryer.
From the stove, Kreacher piped up, “Master Draco is having shortness of breath, he is vomiting twice, and is clutching his head several times.”
But Robards was right about another thing too; Harry was fucking terrible at following orders.
“Yeah,” Harry said awkwardly.
Coming closer, Malfoy looked down at Harry’s progress. “You have to try to match the colors and shapes in the image not the pieces themselves. Look,” kneeling down, Malfoy picked up a piece and fitted it to another.
As Teddy beamed at him, his hair rapidly flashed to black and then back again. Along with practicing to make physical changes on purpose, Teddy was also working on
When the quiet became too much for Harry, he asked, “so, how are you feeling then?”
“George,” Harry interrupted loudly, “How. Do. I. Get. Them. Out?”
He found her staring at the fireplace with a rigid posture. Hearing him enter, she turned around with glassy eyes. “That evil, scheming – Harry, he’s a Death Eater!”
A few more bogeys.
Harry climbed the stairs heavily, almost certain now that Narcissa hadn’t found answers. Not looking forward to informing Malfoy he was still stuck here, Harry paused outside Malfoy’s door before knocking softly.
Malfoy just sneered.
Harry rushed forward, dropped down and grabbed his hands. “Malfoy! Malfoy, are you -”
“Oh, Master Harry, you must be trying to be less clumsy.” Kreacher had a hand raised toward them threateningly. “How good of Master Draco to be trying to catch your fall.”
“Nonsense,” she said briskly. With a minute shake of her head, she gathered herself. “I’ll find your attackers. It’s just going to take a bit longer than I anticipated.”
This was ridiculous. They were probably petty thieves or dabbled in illicit brews and thought it made them cool. They didn’t know anything about him or anything else. He was wasting his time. Robards was right and Harry was leaving.
Potter’s breath was coming harder and Draco could feel it on his skin. Its warmth and having that waiting mouth so close without touching was maddening. He gave a rough twist to the head of his prick to take the edge off.
“I know it was bad. I know she fought as much as she could.”
anything. Tell him to leave,” she demanded.
said he’s not a veela, just sun deprived, and –”
a disguise. That looks like a potions accident.” Malfoy stood and approached Harry to inspect him critically. “Who’re you supposed to be then?”
“Good boy.” He smoothed a hand over the pink handprint he’d made and considered his options. “I bet your arse swallows cock even better than your mouth does,” he mused.
Ginny was livid. “What the
Harry felt his mouth fall open. “I – How’d you...? Did Narcissa…?”
Back in Robards’ office, Harry paced restlessly. “There’s something.”
She did look lovely. The maroon dress she wore was simple and snug around her waist and hips with ample cleavage displayed by a deep neckline. She’d done something to give her hair loose curls and her makeup made her eyes look larger and her mouth plumper.
“You want me to fuck you.”
Instantly alert, Harry asked, “what’s happened?” He slammed the door shut and was hurrying down the hallway before the elf could answer.
With a shrug, Malfoy said, “no.”
“What can I say, my hands are magic.”
Draco immediately followed. His vision went black and every nerve in his body seemed to fire at once.
“No! Look,” Harry waved his hands in a placating manner, “Malfoy was just – ah, well, he was… Actually, I don’t really know what he did. But he’ll fix it! Won’t you, Malfoy?” Harry threw a pointed look over his shoulder.
“Wait,” Harry said suddenly, “can’t you look into his head and see who did it? He had to have seen them.”
Malfoy looked up as Harry sat down. He swallowed his bite thickly and gingerly set the sandwich down. “Ah,” he cleared his throat awkwardly, “Potter, it seems I may have been a bit overly dismissive last night.”
A nod.
” Harry quoted. “I agreed to three days and then felt the Debt hit me with some weird… feeling.”
“What do you think?” Malfoy asked, giving a little twirl to show off his outfit. It fit perfectly. Black trousers, that Harry hadn’t known he’d had, and a deep green long-sleeved shirt hugged his body closely.
Fucking hell.
“He’s going to tell me what he knows. He’s always been a conniving bastard, you know he has. We need to know why he’s here.”
Harry’s face went slack as the shirt hit him in the chest and fell to the floor. It was not better. It was so much worse. Harry’s eyes locked on the line of hair that trailed from Malfoy’s bellybutton and disappeared into his trousers. He could just see the very top of indentations that formed what Harry’s brain decided would be a sculpted V, pointing toward Malfoy’s prick.
Malfoy, meanwhile, had picked up the Ear-Bugs and was frowning at them. “So, what do these parasites do?”
Everything slowed. Harry knew he was too far away. Knew he’d never get his wand out in time. He could only watch whatever was going to happen.
When Malfoy finally stopped convulsing, Harry said, “you weren’t this bad half an hour ago. What happened?”
Rolling his eyes, Harry zipped Malfoy up and said, “let’s get out of here. Mary already left.” He pulled Malfoy from his slouch against the wall and had to catch him as he listed sharply to the side. “I didn’t think you’d actually drink the bar.”
“I promised. You should have seen – He was –” Harry trailed off remembering the blood and Narcissa’s pained expression.
A proud, smug smile graced Malfoy’s lips. “I have been so fine, in fact, that I was able to figure out the Ear-Bugs.”
“Mmm,” Malfoy hummed, “I think I could develop one.” Slowly, he rose up and Harry’s prick slipped out of him. He looked over to his disarrayed computers and said, “well, we did a number on…”
“Whatever. Shut up.” Malfoy cleared his throat and continued in falsetto, “
The woman circled back around and reached up to grab Malfoy by the hair again. She held him flush to her body and was just tall enough in her heeled boots to rest her chin on his shoulder. She was whispering in his ear again, gently petting the red areas of his chest as her eyes scanned the room. Whatever she was saying caused Malfoy to tremble.
Harry blinked and cocked his head.
Everything went still, and two sets of eyes widened and stared at Harry in incredulous surprise. Harry shrugged, happy to have moved on. “I keep tabs on a few people. Seemed the best way to get information.”
While Potter eagerly dragged his trousers down his hips, Draco removed his shirt. Once fully naked, he let Potter look for a long moment. Smirking at the hungry expression he saw, Draco sauntered forward with an exaggerated sway.
Harry thought about Eustace too. The daft old bird was apparently the eighth in a long line of daft old birds. Emilia must have been alone a long time now. It made Harry a bit sad to know the origin of the parrot’s name. In the quiet of his mind, Harry could admit he saw a few parallels to her story about Eustace and Malfoy. Annoying, back-talking, and causing unending trouble, indeed.
Harry frowned. “The Aurors help people. It’s their job. They wouldn’t hurt someone who didn’t deserve it.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and moved to leave the room. He turned back before leaving and said with a mischievous smile, "if you think Albert Humble is something, wait till you see me.”
“Yeah, okay. I’ll probably need to get away from Malfoy anyway.”
” Ropes twisted from Harry’s wand, binding the small man tightly and he toppled over onto the floor.
Harry recoiled from Malfoy as he felt that same jolt of…
“I am
“Yes?”
“Not at the moment.”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
Mary’s eyebrow arched. “What could you possibly want with charity records?”
Eyes narrowed and mouth tight, Malfoy paused and then downed his cup as Harry had. Harry nodded in recognition and refilled his cup too.
“Mr. Potter,” she said smoothly, “are you redecorating?” With a tilt of her head, she indicated the empty space that used to contain a sofa.
A moment seemed to pass between them before Malfoy let go and cleared his throat awkwardly. “So, why have the Bugs linked to the Brick thing? You could alter the spellwork easily enough to function without it.”
Narcissa’s eyes bore into Harry. “You let my son go to a pub after he was brutally beaten?”
“Nope. I haven’t found anything either.”
Removing the fingers from his mouth, Malfoy reached behind a pillow and pulled out a dildo. “I’m going to fuck myself with this,” his said with a husky voice. “But first, it needs to be wet.”
“Oh, I think I saw her leave a little while ago?” Mark shrugged uncertainly and then grinned, saying, “but I think your other friend could use some help.” He gestured over his shoulder at the bathroom door. “Tell him to owl me sometime.” With a wink, Mark left.
Blinking in astonishment, Harry patted his hair. “Maybe I really should have Kreacher check…?”
What the hell kind of place needed glamour detection, disillusioned doors, and signatures? Illegal places, that’s where. Harry
He stood and began making sure everything in his work space was ready. He lightly ran his fingers over the arm of the leather couch set against the far wall. On a side table, some of his equipment sat clean and well worn. The rest was hanging on the walls and on a few strategically placed racks. Draco dimmed the lights
“No. Now can you tell me
Looking up, Harry saw that one of the screens still displayed a view of the armchair. The view was fucking spectacular. Malfoy was splayed open, Harry’s cock pumping in and out of his arse and a magicked toy sliding through his lips while he moaned shamelessly.
Harry sat at his desk lazily and leaned back in his chair as he idly twirled his wand between his fingers. It was a slow day. He didn’t even have paperwork to occupy his time. The only thing his ‘In’ and ‘Out’ boxes contained was a fine layer of dust. The unusually hot summer weather seemed to be keeping everyone, including criminals, indoors and out of trouble. He supposed he should be glad about that, but it was only just passed noon and he’d have given his least favorite body part for just one tiny homicide to liven up the day.
“You want me to fill your messy, wet hole?”
“I organized garden gnome pit fighting and commanded the house elves to joust with each other while riding the peacocks.”
The woman gripped Malfoy by the hair again and lifted his head while holding it still. With one last, harsh whisper in his ear, Malfoy’s eyes finally –
Malfoy rolled his eyes so hard, Harry was a bit concerned he might’ve seen his own brain. “Are you sexually repressed? Because I think you’re sexually repressed.”
“That should tell you something, Mr. Potter. The Dark Lord was on the brink of victory. Hogwarts was about to fall. Our side would have won. And I lied. To save my son. There is nothing I would not do for him.” The fierce look on her face made her seem suddenly larger. “Magic doesn’t care why I saved you. It cares that I did. You owe me. Do this, and we are even.”
Trigger Warning: Implied sexual abuse.
“Quite.” Her tone was cutting.
to her.”
The woman settled behind him on her knees and sat back on her heels. Malfoy
“Not yet.” Draco took Potter’s hand and poured a generous amount of lube in it. “I’m going to watch you finger yourself open for me. You’re going to tell me how much you want my cock while you do it.” Draco made himself comfortable on one end of the sofa with one leg bent up on the cushion, legs splayed as he idly stroked himself.
All kinds of what?
What were the safety precautions
“I did say I’d fixed it.”
“Couldn’t I just be visiting for the pleasure of your company?”
know in a way that kept them anxious, waiting for a blow and wondering if it might not come. You had to feel when forcefulness would press them in just the right way and know when a sympathetic word would break them.
“At least you didn’t spell your eyes green,
you see everything. Wouldn’t want to miss any law-breaking.” He gestured to a folding chair that sat just beside one of the tripods. On the tripod was a camera, pointed at the armchair.
“Oh,” Harry said lamely, “it didn’t go with the Feng Shui.”
“All I need from you,” she continued, “is for you to scribble on this bit of parchment with this quill. It will detect your magical signature, and wha-la, you remove your glamour and walk through that door.” With a flourish, she held out an ordinate quill.
“So fucking hot,” Harry panted. “You’re so good at taking cock. Your wet hole feels so good around my prick.”
Harry threw his hands up. “Oh my God, Malfoy. Shut the fuck up and go drink more tea. If you fall down, I’m not helping you up.”
“Okay.” Harry filled a teacup and handed it to him.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry said crossly.
Malfoy looked at him disdainfully, “what is your problem today?”
“Of course it does,” Malfoy said, still not looking at Harry, “it’s extremely expensive.”
Narcissa’s face softened and she reached out to touch the red handprint she’d left on his face. Malfoy winced at the contact and it looked like it pained Narcissa to see him do it. She murmured a spell and the print faded. “I sometimes forget that you’ve grown and aren’t a child anymore. But you’ll always be my little boy. Always.”
“It is of no concern to you, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa said dismissively. “Draco will remain here until I find his attackers.”
him with his idea.
I don’t need you to protect me from that bitch Weasley or your bushy-haired know-it-all. What if I am a threat, eh?” He lifted his wand toward Harry.
Harry’s eyebrows merged with his hairline.
“That probab –”
“Cat images?” Malfoy asked dubiously.
She glanced at Malfoy and then back. “I sincerely hope you’re right. The Veritaserum should wear off in a few minutes.” With that, she entered the fireplace and was gone.
“Why not? He looks half dead and could bleed out!” Harry’s brain was staring to catch up with the fact that there was a
“We met at Hogwarts,” Malfoy answered carefully.
Draco released his face and took a step back. He walked around behind his newest client and regarded him from the back. “You know how to use the colors, yes?”
pathetic? Your mum brought you here because you have
“Watching for surprises, like you said.”
Harry shivered and wondered what these people thought they knew about him. He was
“Potter?” Malfoy’s voice came loudly from the sitting room.
As he left the hallway, he heard Malfoy mutter snidely, “such a gracious host.”
Harry finished his pint and gazed into the bottom of his glass. He sat there for long minutes, alone, and trying to avoid the few interested looks that where being thrown his way.
“I’m not going to die!”
“And we can’t go until I fix -” he waved his hands at Harry expansively, “
She interrupted him just as harshly, “we need honest answers, Harry. I have questions and he is going to answer them. Ron and I leave for Australia tomorrow. I don’t have time to waste on picking apart lies and half-truths.”
“No. His tea worked, and it hasn’t happened again.” Malfoy’s tone brooked no argument.
Harry was still mentally going over why this was such a bad idea when he heard himself say, “fine. Three days.”
“Mobiles. Kind of like George’s Brick? It’s where he got the idea.”
He found him with a small group of other children, a look of fierce concentration scrunching up his little face. As Harry approached, the roots of Teddy’s brown hair turned purple. The other children watched with rapt fascination as the purple began taking over the rest of his hair. Face beginning to turn red, Teddy exhaled a burst of air and slumped. As he caught his breath, his hair faded back to its natural color.
“I don’t need your help.” His sneer lost some of its effect as he swayed and grabbed onto the doorframe.
Harry was excited to get home and open up his new toys. Malfoy disappeared into the library and Harry settled himself into the sitting room with his bags.
“No judgment here, right,” the bartender held up his hands. “Rosie’s got a nose on her like nothing I’ve ever seen. If you didn’t belong here, you wouldn’t have made it through the door.”
“What are you talking about!?” the man exclaimed.
Harry glanced at Taylor before leaning forward and whispered harshly into Roberts’ face, “you’re going to have a narrow view of the world through your cell window.”
“You!” Harry was suddenly so angry. Fuck Malfoy. Fuck him being here in Harry’s house, in his clothes, in his
“I dunno. Five galleons says she could lay you out.” George grinned crookedly for a moment. “Seriously though Harry, what are you doing? Last I knew, you hated him.”
He fucked himself on Harry’s cock, slamming his arse down over and over. “So hard. Fuck. Deeper. Fuck me deeper.” He withdrew Harry’s cock long enough to pull his legs up onto the armchair and brace them along Harry’s thighs. With the added leverage, he was able to fuck himself even harder.
Unhurriedly, Harry slipped his hand into his pajama bottoms. He idly slid the pads of his finger over his soft, but slowly filling, prick. Even the material of his pajamas felt wonderful against the back of his hand. Well, they were his favorite pair for a reason.
Standing, Malfoy pressed his body to Harry’s and said in a rough voice, “if only you could fuck my hole while you fucked my face.” Against his hip, Harry could feel that he was hard and ready again.
Malfoy worked himself until he was moaning a string of, “God, yes, fuck,
Already regretting his decision, Harry went to his study. He had more pacing to do in-between frantically going through his files again and composing more letters.
With a growl, Harry stormed up the front step and pounded on the door. “Aurors! Open up!” Harry was still hammering his fist against the door when Curly came sprinting from the side of the house.
Malfoy was still laughing his stupid head off.
“No. I go out sometimes. I didn’t tell my mother.” His face scrunched up. “She saw some of my more… exciting moments. She saw some of last night.”
I will not be seen with you looking like that.” He advanced on Harry with his wand. “At least you changed your eyes and covered up the scar. Now hold still.”
Malfoy’s eyes snapped to Harry’s and widened. He stepped back sharply and said, “that should do.”
“Well, you missed one.” Harry indicated the broken pot with a nod of his head. “I had a stunner aimed at me and the perp got away.”
Harry knew he wasn’t particularly good at letting things go, especially when there was something that kept scratching at his senses, saying something wasn’t right. This wasn’t just a scratch; unanswered questions were clawing at his brain. Someone had tried to hit him with a Stunner. Just because no one else had seen it didn’t mean it hadn’t happened. Oddly, Harry though Roberts was telling the truth when he claimed it had just been him and Pricilla at the house. He didn’t believe anything else that had come out of the bastard’s mouth though. Pricilla had
“You were made to suck cock.” Potter hummed at this and Draco felt it down to his toes. “So good. Fuck. My good boy.”
Entering and closing the door behind himself, Harry smiled at a stately, older witch dressed in beautiful, flowing robes. Her white hair was gathered artfully on top of her head and she reclined elegantly on a tasteful divan. She completely ruined the effect by saying, “the feck do ye want with me now, boy?”
“Idiot,” Harry said without heat. With a resigned sigh, he stepped into the stall and reached for the zip on Malfoy’s trousers. Malfoy tried to bat his hands away. “You know, Mark could have helped you if you didn’t want me to do it.”
Abruptly, Harry sat as though his strings had been cut. “Give me this case, sir. I can handle it.”
that he gave it to me but, well, who else would it have been? No one else got close enough to have slipped it to me.”
“What happened?” Harry repeated. “Why does Kreacher look like the world is falling apart and he’s responsible?”
Malfoy gave him an offended look. “Just for that, I get to be the Falcons. Prepare to face utter defeat.”
Her eyelashes lowered. “Depends. What’s the something else?”
Back and forth, back and forth. What if he couldn't find the attackers? Malfoy would become a permanent fixture in his house. Harry couldn’t even leave without Malfoy or he'd collapse again. He had to figure this out. He needed to press his contacts harder, but how was he going to handle meetings if he had to have Malfoy in tow? Malfoy could ruin his entire network.
“Potter, sit down.”
“Hmm,” Draco gently soothed both cheeks and rolled them to expose Potter’s tight, pink arsehole, “you’re going to be so tight around my cock.” He trailed a finger over the puckered flesh and felt Potter shudder. Draco placed his prick between Potter’s splayed cheeks and rocked slightly. Potter arched and let out a moan that traveled all the way down his spine. Taking advantage of this, Draco reached forward and shoved two fingers in Potter’s mouth. “Make them wet.”
Harry waited for him to finish and tried not to listen to the sounds of him retching.
Malfoy’s face soured. “Ah, Girl Weasley. Bit overbearing, if you ask me.”
“My what?”
Malfoy was standing tensely, looking pinched and pale. Next to him was Ginny. Her hands were balled into fists and her face was flushed an angry red. When she looked at Neville, there was fear and worry in her eyes.
Giving himself a moment, he wandered to the side table and perused his options. He picked up a supple riding crop and gave it a flex. Yes, this would do nicely. Walking back to stand in front of the shirtless man again, he trailed the padded leather end from just above the bellybutton to under the chin. He applied a little upward pressure and asked, “color?”
“What did you see?” Harry broke in.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to let her give you clothes. You don’t have to hide from her.”
“Yes, Ma’am.” Malfoy slowly picked himself up and stood.
“I found a healing potion in my pocket after that detention.” He looked over to where Malfoy was crouched down and speaking with Teddy. “I don’t
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy beamed at him and lunged at his legs for a hug.
There had to be something to all this secrecy, but Harry didn’t think he had enough to take to Robards yet. He needed
“He bloody well would,” Malfoy grumbled, not quite under his breath. Malfoy Vanished the tea in his cup and said, “I wouldn’t offer that swill to an American and they don’t know shit about tea. Did you know? They sometimes drink it cold. On
Draco thought,
Harry’s eyes shot open again when he heard a loud

A small box labeled
“Stupid,” Harry muttered in exasperation.
“He will be. Here, he'll heal faster and be protected. He'll be safe if he stays here.” She turned to look at her son. "His surname might be Malfoy, but he has just as much Black blood running through his veins. Legally, this is your home, but the house recognizes one of it's own."
“Ah,” she said in a deceptively calm voice, “I was just about to fetch you, Harry.” She turned her burning gaze to him and continued in the same placid way, “I was wondering… Are you out of your fucking mind?”
Harry didn’t have a response and just stood there, jaw clenched, and glowered.
Her words had a physical, heavy feeling. The air felt thicker and Harry had the feeling
You’re going to make us late.”
With a lopsided smile, George said, “that cannot be right.”
Starting to feel oddly offended, he said, “I
The world and sound came crashing back in on Harry when the woman put her wand way. Where were the screams? Had she changed her mind? Harry was sure she had cast something with that barely perceptible flick. Why wasn’t Malfoy writhing on the floor in agony?
“Thanks,” Mary said when Harry set the drink in front of her, “but I’m going to use the loo really quick now that you’re back. Watch my drink for me. I’ll be right back.”
“Okay,” Ginny’s voice shook, horrified eyes still watching Malfoy as he tried to suppress his trembling, “okay.”
George gave a put-upon sigh. “Doxies, Harry? Really?”
“I didn’t.”
“I need another drink,” Malfoy said. He turned and almost stumbled as he began pushing his way toward the bar.
God, how were they going to get out of this? If only Malfoy could
“I want answers. Why are you here, Malfoy?"
George gave a low whistle, “damn, I thought you had that under control, mate.”
“Yes,” Harry said in a daze, “tomorrow.” He finished standing and pushed his way back through the beaded curtain, not even acknowledging Red Lips – Rosie – as he made it back onto the street.
Harry impulsively went for a new angle. He needed to unbalance Roberts and get that crack to open wider. Harry fired off a rapid series of questions. “Who was guarding your house? Why did you put up Silencing Charms? Do you know the minimum prison time for attacking an Auror? Did your accomplice help you drug your girlfriend? Did he watch while you abused her?”
“You’re going to please me.” He ran the crop gently over the reddening skin on Potter’s chest. “You will do exactly what I tell you, won’t you?”
Malfoy snorted. “Not hardly.”
He stared at the floor in shock until a pair of small feet came into view. Blinking to clear his head, he looked up to see Kreacher’s look of annoyance morph into one of confusion. The elf said something, but Harry had no idea what because a ringing noise had replaced the music.
Completely misunderstanding, the bartender chuckled and said, “yeah, he’ll be here tomorrow too. Almost always is.”
Harry was trying to decide if any of that sounded illegal as the bartender was waved over to another section of the bar. What where they
“Mr. Potter,” she said brokenly, “you must help me.”
Malfoy’s expression said he doubted that very much, but he pulled out his wand anyway. Slowly, he raised the Bugs to his ears and jumped when they crawled in. “If this is a joke, Potter –”
An almost inaudible moan escaped Potter and Draco had to tighten his fist again.
Potter eagerly complied and coated his digits in saliva. He swirled his tongue around them filthily and sucked them in to the third knuckle.
“Have you seen my friend Mary?” Harry asked.
Victoire was already on her second helping and asking a thousand questions. “Are you part Veela too?”
“I’ll be here. I’ll owl you the papers and see you then.” She stood and walked away with an exaggerated sway of the hips.
Irritated, Harry opened the door. Malfoy was completely covered in a pile of blankets, no portion of him visible at all.
“Okay…”
Neville nodded and forced a cheerful smile onto his face. “Looks like they’re about to sing Happy Birthday. We should head over.”
“There was… a lot… that happened that year. Nobody really knew who they could trust. We were all scared. All of us.” Neville had a considering look on his face. “I want to show you something.”
“I – er,” Harry blinked stupidly at not only his tone, but the glitter dusting his eyelids and his mesh top. Trying to regain a semblance of coherence, Harry said vaguely, “all sorts of things, really.”
Malfoy blinked. “I – Yes, okay.”
“No, the – what did you call them? – Ear-Bugs? They could be more responsive, but the control is passable.” He tapped the other Bug rapidly and shouted, “decent volume range.”
Harry tried to force his anger down. He had to co-exist with Malfoy for now and raging at him wasn’t going to help anything.
Malfoy stepped close enough that Harry could feel his heat along his back. “Malfoy –” Harry tried to protest.
Leaning back, Malfoy looked up at Harry with lust filled eyes and commanded, “fuck my face.”
Malfoy smiled with triumph, a gleeful shine to his eyes. “This is going to be hilarious. Merlin, I hope she wants you to dance.”
“Oh,” he turned back with a surprised expression and continued, “you tap them both at the same time. I thought that would be the most obvious way. User friendly and all.”
Pretending to write down the old witch’s contact information, Harry quickly scribbled the address to The Leather Petal and promised to have a firm word with the price gouging apothecary owner. The witch grumbled a bit, but wandered off, leaving Harry to contemplate his next move. He could take the information to Robards. Maybe he could convince him to look into the place, perhaps send someone in to ask some questions, maybe an undercover operation? It could lead to something big. It could be a front for an illegal underground black market.
“Yes, because it’s so much better to be born with money than to actually
“Fuck off. I have to cancel now anyway.”
“I was attacked!”
The little smile dimmed but didn’t have the decency to disappear. “I, in my genius, have made significant progress toward –”
Head Auror Robards looked up from a file at Harry. “Crude and lascivious acts using muggle objects in violation of the Statute,” he repeated. “It was kicked up from Misuse. Says here, a complaint came in yesterday and they want us to take a look. And given who it is, I agree.”
Harry expected an outcry from the other patrons, but it didn’t come. It wasn’t that no one else had seen it happen, indeed all eyes were on Malfoy, but no one seemed to think it worth protest. Adrenaline beginning to swirl at the base of his spine, Harry continued to watch.
She gave Neville a casual slap as she walked away, Ginny trailing behind.
house elf?”
“I’m not an Auror.” Harry hoped Malfoy would take the hint and leave the subject alone.
” Alecto’s wand flicked toward Malfoy and he fell to the ground screaming. It only lasted a moment before he was still again and panting limply against the stone. “Do not interrupt me again.”
“Yes,” he purred. “Come sit here. Close, so you can be
Harry hesitated. He needed to question Mary. There had to be a lead somewhere. Just because there weren't any new donors didn't mean there wasn't someone new on the scene. What about volunteers? New employees? Was there an uptick in people requesting the charity’s resources? Desperate people did desperate, stupid things.
“Mother,” Malfoy begged, “please…”
Roberts was agitated and Harry wanted to keep him that way. Without preamble, he asked, “why would an accountant have a woman drugged and abused on his sofa?”
Malfoy moaned when he saw it and licked his lips. Hips still pistoning up and down, Malfoy leaned back to rest his head on Harry’s shoulder and opened his mouth. Harry slid it in and flicked his wrist, charming it to fuck Malfoy’s mouth.
Malfoy stopped laughing.
Harry sighed, “he’s a prat. An annoying, pigheaded, prat. I know.”
“I really don’t think –” Curly started.
Draco moved behind him and poured more lube over his hole and onto his prick. He pushed two fingers inside Potter's arse easily. So wet. So ready.
“Where is the sofa?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, not knowing what else to say.
“He’s right,” Harry sighed. “Just ask me the questions.”
“Harry dear,” Mrs. Weasley called, “isn’t that Kreacher? Oh my, he seems quite upset. Is everything alright?”
He came back to himself slowly, still clutching Potter to his chest and breathing hard. Gently, he lowered Potter and pulled out with a wince. Weakly, he flopped down beside Potter and tried to slow his pounding heart.
Resisting, Harry stammered, “oh… no, I – I don’t –”
Slowly, high cheek bones and a strong jaw tilted up toward him as big, dark-lashed eyes met his and Not-Jim said, “green.”
Malfoy heaved an exasperated sigh. “Merlin’s balls, Potter. There are six living Weasley siblings. I’d rather not have the whole fucking horde accost me because of a lack of specifics.”
Malfoy’s eyes fluttered shut as Harry gripped his hips and fucked up into him with renewed vigor.
his gut was never wrong.
and hold him down until he told Harry what the fuck was going on. He needed to hear that ragged breathing until answers spilled out. He needed Malfoy to stay pliant and do as Harry said.
Silence.
“I panicked.”
“Hardly a distillery,” Malfoy muttered. “I needed a night out after the difficulties of the last few days. Potter was good enough to comply.”
with him?
Malfoy leaned in, reeking of alcohol, and said into Harry’s ear, “stop thinking. Just move.”
They both just looked at him.
“Oh yeah. Teddy told me. He’s kinda funny about his family, you know, ‘cause they’re all mostly dead.”
Looking closer, Harry saw that one of the bits looked a lot like a spider’s leg. It gave a twitch. “Oh my god, what did you do? George is going to be
She examined them closely, before asking skeptically, “then you’re not infested?”
Malfoy recovered first, saying, “congratulations, Potter, you are now fulfilling two Debts for the price of one,” his voice became acidic, “because,
“Kiss your mother with that mouth?”
He rinsed as quickly as he could and leaped out of the shower. Naked, wet, and freezing, Harry reached for a towel.
“Yes, Sir.”
“I love it when you talk smart,” Bill gushed as he pulled Fleur in for a long kiss.
“Shhh,” Malfoy placed a finger to his lips, “they’ll hear you.”
“I did. Thank you for that,” Harry smiled at her. “So, nothing exciting at work? New co-workers? Any volunteers mucking things up?”
“Fuck off and die,” Malfoy moaned pathetically.
Harry blinked. “I –” Harry blinked again. “Is that blood? I’ll call the Aurors,” he said as he took in the smears on her face and hands.
“Still trying to figure that bit out,” George said ruefully.
“Yeah.”
It wasn’t there. God fucking damnit.
“My name is Al,” Harry seethed. “I thought you were going to sit in a corner, not join us.”
“It’s not what it looks like!”
Harry was just finishing the edge pieces when Malfoy’s voice came from the hallway.
So here Harry was. He nodded in understanding. Sometimes the only thing that stood between a success and a failure was a gut feeling. He sized the other Aurors up, deciding how they were going to do this. Curly might be paranoid -not an unusual trait for an Auror- and this could all be nothing. Or it could be something. Either way, Harry didn’t really trust Mr. Can’t Be Bothered To Get A Hair Cut to be reliable backup. Call it a hunch. Taylor, however, looked like he could handle himself in a fight. He had a quietly confident air about him and wore his well-fitting Auror robes like he was born in them. Not that Harry was going to let either one of them foul things up. He, Harry, would of course take point.
“I know enough about
“Did that have anything to do with the fact that you arrived with Malfoy?”
Looking directly at Harry, he moaned as his hands worked in tandem, stroking and fucking. “Fuck. So fucking good. I’m going to make myself come so hard on this cock. It’s filling my tight hole just right.”
“Oh, stop zat,” Fleur smacked her husband on the arm, “you arr not a princess.” Bill pouted at her. “You arr my king.”
“Whoa, whoa,” Harry laughed, “Uncle Ron will always be my best mate and no, Mal – er, Draco isn’t a veela.” But it would have explained the endless expanses of pale, flawless skin, white, shining blond hair, and Harry’s utter inability to
“Malfoy, you can’t just steal things from muggles!”
. You’ll be doing them a favor.”
“Gin, really, maybe another –” Ginny stopped him with her mouth pressed against his. A loud bang made her jump back.
“Hermione,” he said, mimicking her speech, “good morning. I see you’ve met my houseguest. Can I assume you’ve spoken with Ginny?”
Before Harry could respond, she was striding off toward the group of older ladies. Thankfully, Malfoy had left that particular group and Harry spotted him talking to a delighted, blond headed Teddy.
Harry looked back toward the kitchen and saw Bill quietly leaning against the wall in a spot that would have afforded him a perfect view of the silent altercation that had just happened. The oldest Weasley brother was considering him with a thoughtful expression. Harry gave him a shrug and stepped into the Floo.
Fleur answered, “zee theory hypothesizes zat, with zee correct combination of matrices, it iz possible to harness ambient magic and store it based on a running algorithm of consumption. Zee Egyptians tried and failed to use a more… primiteeve version of zee theory to keep zair pyramids intact in perpetuity.”
“What he’s saying, Potter, is that your magic is a mess.”
Harry’s eyes darted to the witches and saw that they were looking back with hungry expressions. He blinked rapidly, not knowing how to respond.
Harry sipped a blond ale and pretended to not watch the room.
A surprised, strangled noise came from Harry’s throat as his eyes betrayed him by avidly following the line of Malfoy’s body. His skin was so pale. Paler then Ginny’s and without all the freckles. From ankles, to calves, up his thighs and over the swell of his arse, there was nothing to interrupt the expanse of his skin. An unwelcome tightness settled in Harry's lower abdomen and, without his permission or understanding, his pajamas bottoms began to tent. Frozen, Harry watched the muscles in Malfoy’s back shift as he moved an arm.
“Do it,” he growled.
“Ms. Weasley,” Alecto tutted, “how selfish of you. You would deprive these others of a valuable lesson?”
Harry sat transfixed, unable to look away. Crude and lascivious acts, indeed.
“Says the bloke wearing my clothes,” Harry pointed out. “And how is that money working for you now, with it all spent on reparations and having several vaults frozen?”
“There is no case,” Robards said sternly.
Teddy looked up at him with wide, worried eyes and asked in a small voice, “do you think he’ll like me?”
, not
“Of course not,” Malfoy said without infliction and Harry didn’t believe him.
“First round’s on me,” Malfoy said, holding a shot and taking the seat next to Harry. “I’m Harvey. Harvey Porter. Al’s told me all about you.” He extended a hand past Harry toward Mary. “Nice to meet you.”
He reappeared on a country lane leading to a small cottage. The front garden was a riot of overgrown rose bushes and shrubs sporting bright yellow flowers. Harry made his way up the uneven stone path and watched as a group of gnomes scattered across the yard.
“I haven’t bought him a gift!”
Time for forcefulness. “Oh? I think you’re a sad little man who gets his rocks off by trying to feel big. I think you’re a possessive shit who takes his feelings of inadequacy out on others.”
“Yes,” Harry answered before she could ask him or ignore him.
Tearing his mouth away, Malfoy groaned throatily and said, “put your hard, hot cock in my arse. Fill me up and fuck me hard.”
Life Debt. And I didn’t set a time limit to mine.”
She frowned at his vague answer. “Do you –”
Mark was watching the space Malfoy had disappeared into with a grin. “Trouble can make life interesting.”
“Oh, well then… I – I suppose I -”
“Yes, and you’ll have to remove your glamour as well.”
before they get into real trouble
He was not an Auror. He was not a member of the Ministry at all. He knew that, but he couldn’t stop himself from keeping his ears perked. Voldemort had taken control of Wizarding Britain before the Ministry even believed he was back. Nothing like that should never happen again.
“An Owl came,” Malfoy announced loudly. He shuffled through the fallen parchment and came up with a piece that was folded and sealed.
Malfoy shuddered but refused to open his eyes. “Mum…” he trailed off pleadingly.
Are you going to his birthday party? He’s going to be five!” She held up her hand to show how many that was.
She gave him a funny look and said, “I don’t think so? I’m down in Accounting. Nobody ever volunteers for that.” Mary gave a little laugh and leaned forward, her breasts rounding further as she breathed deeply. “How about you? What kind of business venture are you getting into?”
“No, I will not,” Alecto snapped without taking her eyes off Ginny. “These students are clearly up to no good. Obviously, they meant to be out after curfew. Such poor behavior cannot go unpunished.”
"Okay, it was a bit loud, is all."
“I do. Mostly. It’s nothing to worry about. It’s fine.”
“How are you going to stabilize the magic needed for all that?”
anything?”
an annoying, pigheaded prat.”
Into the sudden silence, Malfoy said nastily, “well, that was enlightening.”
Harry was just as good at interrogation as he was at fieldwork. It was probably the only reason Robards had agreed to let him in the room. There was an art to asking questions. You had to mix in what you
Mary took her shot and then gulped half the drink Harry had brought her. “Alright,” she said enthusiastically, “let’s dance!” She pulled his arm toward the dancefloor.
“Thanks.” Harry was pretty sure that didn’t come out as a question.
“Sure, got it,” Harry agreed, “no burning buildings.” He left the office with Robards’ narrowed eyes still following him.
George considered the sketch again. “I could add dampeners. I’d like to market this to all ages, even little kids who’re showing random bursts of uncontrolled magic. It might hurt business if the wee tykes have an episode like Harry’s.”
him?”
“I don’t have bugs.” Harry cringed at how petulant he sounded.
Harry ducked into an alley, removed his disguise and Disapparated.
“Paperwork?” Harry asked.
“Don’t be a prick,” Harry admonished. “And shut up, it’s almost our turn.”
Malfoy barked a laugh and said, “welcome to the internet, Potter.”
Draco settled back into the sofa and spread his legs. He cupped his rapidly hardening cock through his trousers and gave a few rough squeezes. “You’re such a good boy, I’m already hard. Would you like to feel how hard I am?”
No casework for Harry, but he was usually the first one sent to a scene. The argument that cases needed more than one person to collect evidence, process, document, theorize, organize, blah, blah, blah… did not apply to fieldwork. And Harry was
Malfoy’s mouth did a funny thing that made him look a bit like a fish. He coughed and asked, “you’re not wearing pants?”
George glanced up. “Don’t get cocky, your arithmancy doesn’t address the defects Harry encountered at all. I still haven’t found what could cause the defaults to fail.”
“Misuse sent up another report,” Robards repeated. “Crude and lascivious acts again. Bit more detail on this one, though.” He looked extremely unamused. Looking down at a file he read, “’levitating dildos, wandless magic, and indecent buggery.’”
“Close your eyes,” Malfoy demanded. Harry did. “The crowd in the stands doesn’t matter. You’re a Seeker, high above everything.”
The young fellow flashed dazzling teeth and gave Harry an almost predatory look. “Mmm, you look very strong.”
“Sirs!” Kreacher shouted shrilly, “Kreacher is hiding the good tea again if you is not being nice!”
Wincing in sympathy, Harry answered, “you were in rough shape. Kreacher healed you, but the left-over effects will probably take a while to go away. Your mum said you needed to rest.”
“You’re so close to my cock. Just a little further and you could taste it.” Draco pulled harder on his hair as Potter tried to do just that. “No. You’re going to watch and not touch. You’re going to stay just on the edge of breathing me in, of feeling all my heat, until I say otherwise.”
Malfoy sat in the armchair and opened his robe. Underneath, he was naked.
“Y-yes, Sir. Please.”
“Alright there?” Harry asked.
Hermione’s eyebrows drew down and she stared at Harry for a long moment. She shook her head and said to herself, “this is stupid.” Louder, she said, “Malfoy was attacked, and no one knows who did it. Correct?”
God, how fucking awful. Poor Ginny. Forced to torture kids or be tortured herself while two of her peers stood witness as it happened. Neville’s indication that Alecto had started taking more of an interest in Ginny hinted at further horrors. Harry’s stomach clenched at the thought of what an older, sadistic woman might want from a pretty, younger girl. Harry hoped to God it was just to offer pointers on effective Bat Bogey Hexes, but was awfully certain there were far more, far worse things on Alecto’s mind.
So much for assuming the memory lapse was from head trauma. Harry needed Hermione. No one knew more about Obliviation and memory than her. Hopefully, she’d managed to restore her parents’ memories. If she could do that, cracking Malfoy’s brain should be a snap for her. At long last, Harry began to feel a spark of hope. Hermione could fix anything. Harry just had to make it to next Wednesday and she’d be back to pull him out of this mess.
Kreacher entered the kitchen, humming happily. “Master Draco is much improved. He is needing to rest, and I is making him some good, strong tea.” The elf continued to hum as he gathered items for tea. Obviously, Malfoy rated higher than Harry’s usual guests because Kreacher was setting up a formal tea tray with fancy cups that Harry didn’t even know he had.
The bell tinkled as she left, and Harry sat back in his chair, dreading tomorrow night. The bar would be packed, the music would be loud, and he would have to pretend to be interested in Mary. He hated that he would need to deceive her like that, but those records might point him in the right direction and it was the best way to ensure she delivered.
hates him.”
Behind him, Malfoy snorted.
a dark wizard could have you at their mercy.
” Harry felt his mouth twist viciously. “Where you even actually attacked? I mean, no one seems to give two shits about you these days. Were you looking for sympathy? Attention? Relevance?”
in tiny lettering. The place was locked up tight and Harry could feel the wards humming against his skin.
“You relapsed again less than an hour ago. Do you really think you needed another Stinging Hex on top of it?” Harry snapped in exasperation.
“Good boy,” Draco breathed. He looked down and with a sharp tug, said, “suck me.”
“No!” she said quickly. “I can’t be sure- They could-” Visibly, she calmed herself and said, “please, Mr. Potter, can you let us in? My son is hurt.”
Harry stared at him for a moment and then whispered back, “thank you, Kreacher.”
Harry wrapped a hand around Malfoy’s bobbing cock and used his other to grip Malfoy’s hip. He fucked up into him, meeting every bounce of Malfoy’s arse.
With determination, Harry set off to find The Leather Petal. It wasn’t far, but a few wrong turns and several misleading signs sent him on a circuitous path to an easy to miss side street. Harry walked past it twice before realizing it wasn’t a service alley.
“No,” Alecto cut her brother off, “we’re going to have a nice chat about her future. Woman to woman.” She turned her attention to Malfoy and said, “take Longbottom to his detention. Oh, and ten points from Gryffindor and another detention for being late, Mr. Longbottom.”
Teddy’s smile fell as he said, “I can’t make it stay though. Gran says my mum could change her hair and her whole face and it stayed for
“Harry!” Neville exclaimed. “It’s been a while! How are you?”
“No, I – I don’t. I have a… I mean, it’s complicated, but…”
“I see.” Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Harry. “Then are you suggesting we accept that Draco will live here with you forever?”
Harry was left reeling. What the fuck? Who reacted like that? Roberts was an accountant for fuck’s sake.
It seemed like Malfoy’s mum was grasping at the same straws Harry was. He wished he could have been under his invisibility cloak to witness that conversation. Narcissa’s icy distain pitted against Emilia’s sharp tongue would be a sight to behold.
Not being a complete idiot, Malfoy eyed the Brick suspiciously before taking it. “What is this?”
“There’s something here, sir, I can feel it.
The line for the Women’s was ridiculously long and Mary wasn’t in it. She could have been inside, but Harry was starting to doubt it. As he reached the Men’s room door, it opened, and Mark came out. He stopped suddenly when he saw Harry.
Malfoy appeared in the doorway. “Lovers’ spat?”
Realizing he was babbling in his own head, Harry turned on the taps and splashed water on his face. What was wrong with him? Why was he reacting like this? It was just skin. He’d lived in a dormitory with four other blokes for six years! Shared a bathroom and quidditch locker room, for God’s sake.
“Okay, fine. But you still should have gone to St. Mungo’s. What if he doesn’t wake up?”
“Why? His mother be looking for the answer already. Do ye really think you could do a better job of it than her?” She looked far too interested in hearing his reply.
“Neither of you have parasites?”
Malfoy cut in before Harry could answer. “Oh, Harry didn’t tell you?” Hearing his name out of Malfoy’s mouth was a weird experience and was only made stranger as the arsehole continued with wide-eyed sincerity, “we’re very close now. Inseparable. Best mates, really. He all but begged me to stay with him. I’m shocked he didn’t mention it to you. Maybe it’s because you’re such a –”
Harry thought. “His mum thought he’d be safe here. He was hurt yesterday, and she doesn’t know how or why. Hermione, it was bad. Like, I thought he was dead when they showed up, bad.” Maybe if she understood the severity of the circumstances, she’d stop trying to stab him with her eyes.
“Good boy,” Draco mouthed against his perineum right before he latched his mouth over Potter’s hole and licked wetly.
“And report them to the Aurors,” Harry said forcefully.
“Don’t be stupid. I can’t go empty handed!” Malfoy’s eyes darted around. “What do five-year-old’s
Harry was back the next night. The Leather Petal was filled with people clustered around little tables, leaning against the bar, and lounging in the soft looking chairs. The music was just loud enough to obscure any conversation more than an arm’s length away.
Bill gave him an odd look. “I’m familiar, but I have to say, I’m surprised you’ve heard of it.”
words.” Malfoy was looking at him hard and had a half-mad glint in his eye.
Malfoy lifted his chin in challenge. “Yes.”
Picking up a bottle of something that definitely wasn’t his, Harry squinted at the label. It looked French and fancy. Harry popped the cap open and gave it a whiff. It smelled nice in a foresty kind of way and, for some reason, this irritated Harry further.
“You’re disgusting.” Harry was not going to smile. He wasn’t.
“I’m pretty sure it does include making sure you don’t die because you’re too stupid to listen to me!”
With another whisper into his ear, Malfoy turned around and slid back to his knees. The woman on stage with him used her booted foot to nudge Malfoy’s knees apart. She had him spread his legs so far that it had to be uncomfortable for him. And then – Oh fuck – she placed the heel of her boot between his shoulder blades and
Kreacher wilted and Harry was
Harry’s mind went blank again as there was movement on the platform again. He was like a mouse, terrified but unable to flee when found by a snake. Almost hypnotized, Harry watched the woman help Malfoy into an upright position facing his audience. He looked wrecked. His whole body was flushed and the white button up hanging off his shoulders only served to emphasize the nakedness of the rest of him. His cock was still hard.
” Malfoy cupped his non-existent, invisible, and absurdly large breasts and proffered them to Harry in a horrifying manner.
“You tried to shove them in his ears, didn’t you?”
Harry threw his head back and fucked him for all he was worth. He twisted his wrist again for more lube and wrapped his fist around Malfoy’s cock. Malfoy bounced so that he slid through Harry’s hand every time his arse swallowed Harry’s prick.
Defeated, Harry muttered, “yes, sir,” and slunk back to his desk.
Instantly on guard, Harry felt himself fall into a defensive stance. “What glamour?”
“I’m sure he was thorough,” Malfoy hissed through clenched teeth.
“I’ve heard many a thing. Always do.”
“No.”
, I will punch you in your fucking face.”
Harry’s heart gave a lurch. “Dobby wanted you to learn healing?”
“Safe? Here with me? You realize we’ve tried to kill each other?” Harry was growing a bit frantic at the idea of Malfoy as his house guest for an undisclosed amount of time.
“I’ve, ah, I’ve been around,” Harry evaded with a vague gesture. The less solid information he gave them, the better.
Eustace the parrot came flapping over and settled clumsily on Emilia’s shoulder. She reached up to stroke her bird’s feathers while keeping her shrewd eyes on Harry. “Me husband’s name was Eustace. He was an ugly, fecking arse. Always in me way, always saying things he shouldn’t of, always making me want to pack me things up and never look back. Oh, the rows we got into.”
Harry did not have a semi because of Malfoy. He had morning wood and that was perfectly normal and not at all anything to do with Malfoy.
“I’m not a twat,” was Harry’s clever comeback.
Slowly, Harry said, “she wanted you to stay here. I said you could.”
Harry reached out and took the quill. Without letting himself hesitate, he scratched a line across the parchment. Harry braced for the worst.
They landed on the sidewalk outside Grimmauld Place badly. Harry stumbled and immediately started counting limbs. Thankfully, all were accounted for.
“No!” Harry exclaimed. “Of course not!”
Harry didn’t know what was happening and he didn’t know why it was so fucking warm in the room all of a sudden, but he did know that this needed to stop. He needed to get his hands on Malfoy. To see if he was okay. Harry knew the pink parts of Malfoy's chest would be hot to the touch and something in the back of his mind wondered if the rest of his skin was hot too.
Slender legs, muscled thighs and, from Harry’s vantage, he could just make out the swell of what promised to be a fantastic arse. And that cock… Sweet Merlin. Harry had never really understood what was so special about cocks. He got it now. It was the brazenness of it. Malfoy was on full display. Jutting obscenely, directly at Harry.
Hesitantly, George said, “Hermione mentioned your saving-people-thing.”
Harry watched Robards stalk away with dismay. Flicking the file open, Harry looked down at a photograph of Draco Malfoy.
Oh, there was something here. He could
A streak of red light shattered one of the potted plants to Harry’s left and he heard a voice curse. Harry whirled into action instinctually. He fired off three spells before he’d even finished ducking behind a topiary. Heart pounding, he waited for return fire.
A muttered litany of, “fuck, fuck, please, God, fuck,” came from Potter, but he didn’t move.
zip.”
to be hurt?
Stung, Harry snarled and lunged, ignoring the sudden tightness in his chest. He tackled Malfoy to the ground and heard a satisfying
Wait…
“You’ve found nothing?” Narcissa returned archly. “I was unaware that you cared.”
A loud bang sounded, and Harry was thrown off Malfoy.
“Are you currently affiliated with any hate groups?” Hermione moved on quickly in what Harry thought might be an attempt to save Harry from answering.
“Harry, have you lied to Malfoy since he arrived?”
“Malfoy,” Harry blurted in surprise, “you’re a
Malfoy curled his lip and drawled, “Weasley, how nice to see you. I’m sure this wasn’t what you were expecting, but –” He cut off with a barely stifled grunt as Ginny zapped him with a Stinging Hex.
Malfoy ponderously lifted his head and placed a finger to his lips. Slowly, he picked up his discarded robe and wiped his chest with it. He licked the come off his hand as he stood and approached Harry. When he was directly in front of him, his legs pressing into Harry’s knees, he reached over to the tripod and pressed a button on the camera. A light that had been flashing red stopped pulsing.
was delivered to the other side of Malfoy’s chest and Harry’s vision blurred, heat crawled up from his stomach and into his cheeks. He realized his breathing was matching Malfoy’s.
“Of course we are,” Malfoy said haughtily to a book, “I have schematics George should see.”
Ginny’s face contorted with rage. “They haven’t done anything!”
“Oh, I have me feelers out. Something is in the winds, I can feel it.”
The two witches stayed a few more minutes before heading for the door. One blew Harry a kiss and he could hear them giggling until the door closed, shutting off their laughter.
Turning his attention to the letter, Malfoy unsealed it and read the contents. “It’s an invitation,” he said bemusedly.
“It was nothing. I’m fine now.”
Neville took a deep breath and said, “it was a bad year for everyone.”
Malfoy blanched.
He might’ve had a point.
“Seriously, Potter,” Malfoy said, “you’ve always been a twat, but this is excessive even for you.”
Malfoy smirked and Harry groaned, but both answered, “no.”
Harry covered his face. “I know.”
“Tell yourself that if you need to, boy,” she said enigmatically.
As he rounded the corner, Harry heard him command, “Elf, come assist me.”
“Camera is off now. Would you care to make some noise?” Malfoy’s voice was soft and suggestive again.
“No.” He looked smug.
Malfoy blinked and looked down. “Oh, I guess so. Must have gotten mixed up with the things Mother sent over.”
“You didn’t happen to find who attacked me, did you?” Malfoy asked quietly while looking at the floor.
Harry closed his eyes and again wondered what the fuck kind of place he was in. Who
“Please,” Harry said scathingly, “I can see your arm shaking. Coward.”
“A puzzle. Damned thing is harder than I thought it’d be. The pieces keep shifting.”
The familiarity in Malfoy’s tone made Harry’s temper flare again. “It’s ‘George’ now, is it?”
Reaching down, Draco cupped the man’s chin and pressed his thumb to a plump bottom lip. “You are not Jim Roper,” Draco stated, deciding that ‘Jim’ was too unattractive a name for a man with arms like that. Not-Jim jerked like he’d been hit but kept his eyes downward. Draco continued, “no, in here you are not ‘Jim’. You are just my Good Boy.”
“Your
Draco shifted his angle minutely and Potter yelled in pleasure, arching his back. “There, God, yes!”
Harry stared after the elf for a long moment. He was not upset. He shook his head and took a sip of tea. Not yet ready to face Malfoy again, he drank very slowly.
The building, when Harry found it, wasn’t much. The windows were blacked out, the dark paint was peeling, and the only thing telling Harry he was in the right place was a small wooden sign featuring a black rose and reading
” he declared forcefully. “I haven’t been relapsing. I was fighting a Debt and didn’t even realize it.”
“The new wards are impressive, but I spent much of my childhood with my Aunt Berga. Remember, this was the House of Black before it was ever your home,” her tone was disdainful, and Harry felt like a bit of an idiot. Of course she’d been here before. She continued, “I came here because you are the only person I can be sure of.”
“A memory.”
Harry had to clear his throat before he could ask, “to what?”
he was there and listened late into the night despite having gone to bed early.
him, but I don’t hate him either.” Harry contemplated the floor. “I think he almost died yesterday. The War is over. No one should be dying.”
Slowly, the bartender said, “’fraid we don’t serve anything stronger than Butterbeer here.”
“I don't want to know. I don’t care." Ginny shook her head rapidly. "You can’t trust him.”
“When I do let you suck me, you’re going to gag on it. It’s going to go all the way to the back of your throat and I’m going to feel you choke on it.”
Harry rolled his eyes and gave George’s arm a squeeze. “Thanks. Really.”
"I brought Veritaserum,” Hermione announced loudly.
“And I only took one muggle thing.” Harry got the distinct impression that Malfoy wanted to stick his tongue out at him. “Now, if it’s so expensive, why doesn’t it
Before Harry could respond, Malfoy leaned across the bar and drawled, “I come with whomever I please.”
“Mr. Roper,” Draco said smoothly, “get on your knees.” He pointed at the empty space before his desk.
He looked over at Potter and saw that he was utterly wrecked. Somewhere during their fucking, he’d lost the glamour that had changed his hair from black to whatever it’d been when he’d first arrived. It was a mess and he looked thoroughly fucked. His lips were still swollen and red from sucking Draco’s cock.
Harry was sure the music would be blaring and the crowd mostly drunk by ten. That did not sound fun. He scowled.
“Those kittens would have died, sir.”
Turning, and definitely not thinking about arses, Harry saw that Malfoy still sported Harvey’s face and hair. Harry tried to surreptitiously indicate to Malfoy that the disguise was still in place. All he got for his trouble was an expression of sneering confusion. Giving up subtlety, Harry pointed at his own hair and then to Malfoy’s.
“George!” Mrs. Weasley yelled from the stove. “The baby can hear you!”
Harry didn’t know where this was going or what he was supposed to say.
Malfoy snorted and placed Tiny Harry back on his stand. “They definitely got the walk right.”
“Well, well, well,” said a man’s voice from Neville’s left, “what do we have here, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Don’t you fucking dare,” Malfoy spat.
Eyes narrowed, Harry asked, “does the confidentiality extend to you and other staff? Are there really
“My eyes feel fine. You probably need glasses.”
Hermione paused long enough that Harry thought this might be the end of the questions. He was caught off guard when Hermione seemed to shake herself and snapped, “have you ever killed anyone, Malfoy?”
“I agree,” Draco said with a smile. “I trust you’ll be making another appointment?”
“Are you wearing my shirt?”
With a twist of his wrist, Harry conjured a handful of lube and slicked his cock. He used what was left in his hand to press two fingers into Malfoy’s arsehole. He was hot, open, and ready.
the malfunction.”
“What are you doing?” Malfoy asked.
Harry ruffled his hair and said fondly, “you’re starting to get the hang of that.”
With a pop, Kreacher appeared. The elf looked over at their guests with his customary, badly faked smile and then froze. With a wail, Kreacher launched himself at the Malfoys’ side. “Mistress Narcissa! Kreacher is getting hot water and cloths! I is getting potions and bandages for young Master Draco! Leave it to Kreacher!” He was gone with another pop.
In that moment, Harry felt that it was true. Hands high above his head, entire body moving, feeling the pulses of music like wind, he felt euphoric. It was just like flying for the first time. The sudden realization that is was wonderful. This was easy.
“You’ll be great, Nev! Sprout wouldn’t retire without making sure she had a competent replacement.”
Harry groaned into his hands and wondered when the insanity had first begun to settle in. Probably the moment Narcissa had shown up on his doorstep three days ago.
“Stupid, fucking…”
“Suck my cock while you fuck yourself.”
Amycus leered horribly at Ginny and said, “I think she needs further instruction. Maybe some privet lessons. I’ve a thing or two I could teach her.”
“I already did.”
In the corner, Taylor cleared his throat pointedly.
Silence fell heavily, and Harry couldn’t think of anything to say or do. He was saved from awkwardness when Kreacher popped into the room.
“Potter,” Malfoy slapped his quill onto the table and finally looked up, “I. Am. Fine.”
Journalists from the Prophet, store clerks, business owners, Ministry workers, petty thieves, backroom brewers, nosey old ladies… Harry had lines of connection to all of them and more. And he’d come up with… nothing. What could Narcisa possibly find that he couldn’t?
She rose and transferred Eustace to a perch. “I’ll tell you the same thing I told Narcissa. Trouble is going to follow that boy like a bad smell wherever he goes. Too much history, not enough effort to change a fecking thing. Lately, I haven’t heard much about the boy except that the two of you have quite the history. I thought it’d be you and your lot that went after him. Since the war, he’s kept himself quiet and shut away in that big fecking manor. I can’t help you, boy. Not with this.”
“Malfoy, stop!” Harry stumbled after him, each step alleviating his distress a little more. “The Debt. You can’t leave.”
“Not much taller,” Harry grumbled.
“What are you into?” the young man purred.
here? Experimental spells? That could fit with Glitter Face’s willingness to try things. But if that were the case, why would he care if Harry had muscles?
Harry nodded in acquiescence and sat down to pour tea. “I’d like to know if you’ve heard anything about the Sacred 28 recently.”
He held Potter’s head very still as he slowed his thrusting and said, “touch yourself.”
“Sure they won’t,” Malfoy agreed sarcastically as he walked away towards a section of roaring dinosaurs.
Smiling, Harry left.
“And I really don’t care,” Harry cut him off. With that, Harry bent, grabbed the man roughly by the arm, and Apparated to the holding cells.
Well, that last bit didn’t sound ominous
“I –” Narcissa said, “I had no idea.”
Harry glanced over to the sofa where Kreacher was intently examining a cut along Malfoy’s temple. “So, you brought him here to have him patched up?”
The bartended didn’t seem to pick up on Harry’s discomfort and continued, “bit dead tonight. Even for a Thursday. Friday nights, now those are the busy ones. Everybody’s looking to blow off some steam from the workweek. You should come back tomorrow for the real fun.”
to watch over me.” Sneering, Malfoy rose more slowly this time, barely wavering at all. “I’m leaving. Give me my clothes.”
“I’ll take the sodding potion,” Malfoy broke in, all humor gone, “
“You stole their dragon.”
But mostly, on his walk home, he kept repeating her words to himself.
“Wha – look, I have to go.”
Harry didn’t answer. With a shove, he pushed the man aside and scanned the room.
me?” Malfoy’s squawked indignation would have been funnier if Harry hadn’t been so busy wishing the floor would swallow him. In hindsight, the pub had been a bad, not to mention useless, idea.
Harry told Malfoy he needed to make a call, told Kreacher to find the prat some clothes, and escaped to the kitchen. He stood for a moment, pinching the bridge of his nose.
A door slammed in the front of the house. “Mum! Do I smell lemon t -” Ginny froze in the doorway, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy, eating her favorite desert, at her family’s table. “Oh
“You know,” Malfoy said thoughtfully, “I think I saw a book in Potter’s library…” He started walking toward the door but paused on the threshold. Looking back, he said, “it was weirdly nice to see you, Weasley.”
“Wonderful. I’ll just… pop back home then.” Mrs. Weasley gave George a very significant look before disappearing back through the fireplace.
Returning to his desk, he sat back down to wait. This was one of his favorite parts. The calm before the storm. He suppressed the urge to shiver with eagerness. There was so much possibility with a new partner and the paperwork indicated that this one would be exquisite. There were almost no limits and the client had asked for him specifically. Draco let a hand slide briefly over his crotch and did shiver this time.
” Shaking his head in disbelief, he took a drink of his mocha. He lowered the cup slowly and narrowed his eyes in accusation.
Malfoy was looking at him with huge eyes. “They fit,” he said succinctly.
“It was… the air felt heavy. I felt like someone was watching me,” Harry described. “What does this have to do with anything?”
Harry’s hips found the rhythm.
Malfoy slid the plastic cock between his lips. His head fell back as he took the toy as deeply as he could, and he moaned. He moved it in and out of his mouth and began stroking his cock.
Swallowing, Malfoy smirked. “I was testing a theory. I was able to lie.”
“Maybe you should go rest in the guestroom or something.”
If it had been twenty-four hours earlier, Harry would have been ecstatic to blearily stumble from his room at eight in the morning to answer the pounding Narcissa Malfoy was giving his front door. Well, maybe not
Harry tensed every time Malfoy cast. It was an old reflex and Harry wasn’t completely convinced that Malfoy wouldn’t curse him bald or give him warts just to be an arse.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Malfoy held up a hand, quickly saying, “I get that I was badly injured. I get it. Your evil minion made that abundantly clear. But I’ve been fine all day. Really. A few moments of mild lightheadedness. That’s it.”
“Why would Malfoy –? Ugh, never mind. Ear
“Then why is he here?” A thought seemed to occur to her. “
“Whatever. What are you getting for Teddy?”
Everyone else in the DMLE office was working industriously. Quills scratched, papers shuffled, and Harry was ready to bang his head on the desk out of sheer boredom. Every so often, a head would pop up and the Auror would quickly confer with their partner before bending back to their task.
Malfoy’s footsteps retreated down the hall before George looked at Harry with a serious expression. “I’ve been filled in on the relevant parts. You’ve stepped in it this time, mate.”
sat on the sitting room table. Pulling the spider-like contraptions out of their packaging, Harry lifted them to either side of his head and startled when they jumped into his ears. After a moment of discomfort, he used his wand to tap the newly added music note on his Muggle Brick. He reeled as music instantly began blaring into his brain. With a yell he couldn’t hear, he clawed at his head, trying to get the Bugs out. Not only did they not budge, they seemed to be trying to burrow in deeper. Eyes beginning to tear, he desperately grabbed for the Brick and his fallen wand. He jabbed at the music note again and collapsed in relief when the music stopped.
“I doubt that very much. She’ll be back in my bed tonight. You will not find any drugs, potions, spells, charms, or curses on or in Pricilla. In fact, she’s probably waiting for me at home right now.”
Baffled, Harry said, “I’m really not sure what the moral to that story was.”
Ginny scowled back. “Hi, Kreacher. Can you set up tea in the sitting room? Harry and I will be there in a minute, after I’m done saying hello.”
The hair on Harry’s arm rose as he lifted his hand to knock. He stilled with his fist hovering before the door and waited.
Malfoy’s eyes snapped from Harry’s hand to his face. His expression shifted to something Harry didn’t have a name for but looked a bit like he was either going to punch Harry or vomit. “Fine,” he eventually ground out.
“What the fuck is all this?”
The woman was holding a broad - stick? - and Malfoy had red blooming on his upper chest. Harry’s breath caught in his chest. She had
“Fine!” Harry snapped. He let go and watched with satisfaction as the man fell back to the floor with a pained grunt. “Taylor, take the woman to St. Mungo’s. Curl – whatever your name is, get another team over here and see if you can get a trace on whoever fired that stunner. I’m taking this piece of shit in.”
The woman was holding her stick again. She ran it’s end up Malfoy’s leg, knee to hip. Slowly she trailed it around his backside and down his other leg. Other than a slight tremble, Malfoy held perfectly still. With almost casual indifference, she slapped it against his arse, once, twice. Still, Malfoy didn’t move, didn’t open his eyes.
“Gross.” George wrinkled his nose at his oldest brother. To Harry, he said, “that’s fucking brilliant.”
“Alright,” Harry said slowly, “I will.”
“Nobody asked you,” Harry snapped.
They laughed for a minute and then Harry sobered. “Really, though. Thanks for not being a dick about this.”
just sitting here drinking tea. Potter, why the fuck am I sitting here drinking tea?
“How disappointing,” Alecto paused and smirked nastily, “of you. Seems you’re about as useful as your father.” She flicked her wand at a nearby tapestry and its threads fell to the floor as it unraveled. Behind it in a hidden alcove huddled three terrified younger students. Harry guessed that they might be Third Years. “If you’d been paying attention, you’d have noticed Ms. Weasley’s uncanny interest in that tapestry and might have wondered why.”
Harry was suddenly losing his enthusiasm for detective work. There wasn’t anything
“Where did you get that?”
“Come closer.”
“Oh, so sorry, Potter. I’ll just fuck off back home then. Oh wait! I can’t because you triggered our fucking Life Debt and I’m stuck with you and your bizarre fucking mood swings. And Merlin fucking forbid I put your fucking toothbrush
“It means that you’re
Red Lips caught him looking. Her smile took on a predatory curve. “I have some paperwork you’ll have to sign before you go any further.”
him. And Malfoy
Malfoy burst into laughter. “Albert Humble?” he chortled. “No, you’re Harry Potter with yellow hair. Can you be any more obvious? Has this disguise actually worked on anyone?”
He was taking deep calming breaths and inhaling the scent of a freshly made cuppa when Malfoy rejoined him. Malfoy sat back down on the sofa and picked up his abandoned tea cup. He stared at Harry silently.
Smiling, Harry said, “anybody with two brain cells would like you. And if they don’t, it’s their loss because you are the coolest five-year-old ever.”
“Oh my God, let it go. It was
Laughing, the bartender said, “don’t look so alarmed. They won’t bite,” he cocked his head to the side in a considering manner. “Unless you want them to.”
“Don’t worry, I don’t think she could tell,” he said. “I’ll go fend off our lusty ladies over there, shall I?”
“Why go to them at all? They have no sympathy for my family and some of them might have been among those who did this.” Narcissa shook her head. “No. At best, they would forget about Draco in a shuffle of paperwork. At worst… Well, I would rather they not have access to him.”
“Harry James Potter, I you think you can lie to m – Oh.”
George’s face darkened dangerously.
Looking back to Malfoy in disgust, Hermione asked, “have you lied to Harry since arriving?”
“He seems like trouble,” Mark said.
The alcohol had led him to the dancefloor but didn’t lend any actual knowledge of how to dance. Suddenly at a loss, Harry shifted from foot to foot while Mary gyrated to his right. Malfoy was still watching him. He tried to recall anything McGonagall had taught them before the Yule Ball in fourth year and came up blank. He desperately tried to relax his shoulders and find any kind of rhythm. He failed utterly.
that? Why? Why was everyone just
in his house that definitely needed medical attention and a known Voldemort supporter had brought that person here.
“Another?” he asked with a smile.
“Harry, I don’t think –”
here then? Brought by whom?”
“Like Hell,” Malfoy stood swiftly and promptly sat back down, holding his head. “I can’t let her – I won’t just sit here!” He tried to stand again and landed on the floor. “Why do I feel so weak?”
Harry blinked hard and suddenly he was looking into Neville’s sad brown eyes.
Shaking his head in bemusement, George left.
once saved you as well. Keep Draco safe and our Life Debt is cancelled.”
Smiling in ecstasy, Harry opened his eyes to look at Malfoy. He faltered to a stop when he saw that Malfoy wasn’t dancing anymore, just standing there looking at him. Harry stared back for a long moment.
“Where is Pricilla?”
“Sure, Malfoy, sure.” Harry rolled his eyes and sniffed the air. “I think I smell beef stew. If we're not leaving now, we should probably eat before we go. Wouldn’t want Kreacher to think his efforts aren’t appreciated.”
“The corner was boring. Watching you try to flirt was much more entertaining,” Malfoy smirked.
” he said with feeling. “It’s not your Debt.”
“Potter, this thing doesn’t do anything! I –” he broke off as he entered the sitting room. “What the fuck?”
Wand arm shaking, Ginny fired hexes at the other two Third Years in rapid succession. Both fell to the floor clutching their noses and blood leaked through their fingers.
Harry stood here blinking and breathing hard. He shook his head and made his way back to the table. He didn’t know where Mary was. She hadn’t been on the dancefloor after he opened his eyes and she wasn’t at the table, but her glass was now empty. It seemed a little soon for her to have needed the loo again.
“I think Hermione wanted to actually punch you in the face.”
A look of satisfaction flashed across Roberts’ face and a feral smile of his own contorted his lips. “I want my lawyer.”
Clearing his throat, Harry said, “as an Auror with the Depart –”
Harry gaped at his sheer nerve but got up to go change anyway.
“No, please” Ginny whispered miserably, “I can’t.”
Neither Harry or Malfoy spoke to correct the elf.
“What did you get him?”
only yesterday.” Kreacher’s eyes gleamed. “It would be terrible for all of Kreacher’s hard work to be undone.”
“Good,” Harry responded. “How’s Hogwarts?”
Turning his attention to the nearby dancefloor, Harry watched as people swayed in time to the music in a way he’d never been able to achieve. A small group nearest Harry danced together lewdly. Bodies touched provocatively and hands were everywhere.
a criminal and he wasn’t anything like Roberts.
“But you said –!”
Rather than heading straight back to the sitting room while sporting a semi, Harry took a detour to the bathroom. He blinked at his reflection a few times without really seeing himself. His mind was stuck on the flowing line of skin he’d just seen. He hadn't been expecting that. Last night, he’d left Malfoy completely clothed and there was no way the git would have been able to manage undressing himself.
“I wanted to tell you,” Malfoy whispered.
“Malfoy,” Harry said from the doorway, “wake up.”
“What? No, it’s just… Gringotts. They’re still pretty angry about the whole,” Harry gestured vaguely, “you know, stealing their dragon thing.”
“Mostly wizarding. Muggles could be about, but unlikely. Suburban.” Robards handed over a scrap of parchment with the location written in block letters.
The other door, though… Harry wasn’t sure where that led. He would have ventured over to take a look, but he noticed that no one ever seemed to go in alone. And wasn’t that odd? Sometimes it was two people, sometimes more. Never a large group and never a person by themselves. Harry continued to watch.
“I mean, he
“The fuck do you want?” Malfoy demanded as he lifted his pillow the barest inch.
“Look at me.”
“Auror Potter,” Curly spluttered, “you can’t just –”
“Your cock was so good in my mouth. So hard. It’ll be so much better in my arse. I want you to fuck me so hard. I want you to pound it into me, deep. So deep. Deeper and harder than you fucked my face.” He was panting, eyes blown so wide only a sliver of green could be seen.
As he swept the beaded curtain aside, he heard a low whistle and an emphatic, “well, fuck me,” come from behind him.
“Saul?”
“Albert Humble,” Malfoy said grandly, “meet Harvey Porter.”
“Longbottom,” Malfoy hesitated and stared at the wall, “the younger years shouldn’t be causing trouble. They’re going to get hurt. Tell them to stop. They’ll listen to you.”
Well, he was right. “What did your mum see when she looked into your head?”
“I don’t want your pity,” Malfoy hissed. He was scrutinizing Harry closely. “I swear to Merlin, if you make this into a
George’s eyes bulged. “My prototype is in pieces. How, exactly, is that ‘fixed’?”
Harry hissed and hastily undid his belt. It was barely open before Malfoy dragged his trousers down, pulled his cock out and licked it from base to tip. “So much better,” he said right before swallowing him down.
He pinned Malfoy down, pulled his fist back to strike, and yelled, “he was evil!”
Her smile widened. “Everyone is a little lost their first time here. Nothing to worry about.”
Robards pinched the bridge of his nose. “Harry, you agreed to follow procedure.”
“Yes,” they answered in unison.
"Well," Harry huffed, "can I
Potter was incoherent. His muscles bunched and tensed as he fought the urge to move. The sounds coming from his abused throat went right to Draco’s prick.
They exited the room and Harry was left to wonder what the hell had just happened between the two of them. Was Malfoy involved in something or not? Why was he sneaking out at night? What was he hiding?
“Find what you can,” Malfoy ordered Kreacher, “and put them in my room. I’ll be up in a few minutes to put something together.”
“Leave her alone!” the man on the floor yelled.
“Okay, thanks, Uncle Harry!” And with that, Teddy bounced back over to the other children, unconscious of his hair flashing between black and brown.
No sound came from inside, so Harry knocked a little harder.
When the vision refocused and sound filtered back in, Malfoy was saying, “ – just Weasley, Ma’am.”
His smile froze and his eyes went wider than Red Lips’ had as he got close enough to recognize Harry. “Morgana’s tits,” he breathed, “Harry Potter is one of us.”
“No. This is muggle hell.” Malfoy had his shoulders hunched toward his ears and was eyeing everyone with suspicion. “What is wrong with them? They just… shuffle forward and look at their hands.”
He entered the kitchen with a firm stride and his head lifted. And then he stopped abruptly, caution and apprehension flooding his system.
He Owled Neville to ask if he knew of a plant with leather petals. He’s gotten a lengthy list back of plants that could be described as leathery, but none that grew actual leather. And really, how would that even work? Leather came from animals. Was there an animal that had petals? He Owled Hagrid and received an invitation to visit but Hagrid didn’t know of an animal that flowered.
“I was right though! He
Lip curling in a very un-Hermione-like way, she announced, “last question. Malfoy, do you have plans to coerce, trick, or use Harry in any way now or in the future?”
Harry was pacing now. Back and forth, back and forth, his mind whirling. Tomorrow would be the three days since Malfoy had arrived. What if Narcissa turned up without any answers? Harry found himself fervently hoping that she had a wider net of contacts than he did. But how likely was that? Keeping informed was what Harry
there is a charge that would stick! Hell, he’ll probably sue the department!”
Harry had no idea what to do.
When Harry trudged into the kitchen, Malfoy was there holding a half-eaten sandwich while leafing through one of half a dozen books littering the table.
He fell through Neville’s eyes and into the memory.
here.”
Malfoy had spelled his hair black. He’d styled it in short, soft waves that looked tousled without being messy. It caught the light when he moved and shone softly. He’d even altered his eyebrows to be darker and fuller. Small changes to his face gave him a stronger jaw and a dimple in his chin.
“I’ll only fill you up if you’re good. You’re going to be good for me, aren’t you?”
A strangled sound came from Malfoy as he tried, and failed, not to spit out his tea.
From behind his book, Malfoy said, “if you see him, tell the Weasley from yesterday to read Mauss’ Theory of Qualitive Binding of Compulsory Acquisition. I think it shows promise for solving his Brick problem.”
Her eyes left Harry and she fixed her attention back on Malfoy. The woman removed her foot and Malfoy arched in a way that made his red arse cheeks spread and offer a glimpse of what was between them. He was breathing like he’d run a race and little shudders shook him. The woman knelt and gently cupped his face in her hands. It looked like she was stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. She gave him a little kiss on the mouth and the tenderness was so at odds with everything else she’d done to him, it made Harry feel light-headed.
“Partly.” She lifted her chin and stated firmly, “he must stay here until he heals.”
“It’s just fine,” Malfoy gritted through clenched teeth. “Our foreign vaults are practically overflowing, you sanctimonious, muggle-loving, arrogant twat.”
. And anyway, he shouldn’t have had it dangling out of his back pocket if he wanted to keep it.”
” He looked disgusted.
“Go on.”
“The Auror Department.”
Harry’s last shred of professionalism and restraint vanished. He picked Malfoy up, spun them around and slammed him onto a computer desk. Screens, towers and keyboards were shoved aside as Harry touched all the places Malfoy had caressed while he watched. He brought his mouth crashing down on Malfoy’s messily and tasted just a hint of the come he’d licked off his hand.
“You’re going to prison.”
Harry sighed and rubbed his temple. “You were badly injured. Your mum brought you here to heal.”
Malfoy looked up with that stupid little smile and said, “morning.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened and he looked at Harry in surprise. “Harry Potter,” he said in tones of wonder, “St. Potter. Golden Boy and Savior. You led a woman on. You
Harshly, Narcissa bit out, “that is exactly what your father said when the Dark Lord came to stay at the manor.”
“An attack that only you saw. Again, there were no traces found. Not only the suspect, but also Aurors Williams and Taylor claim to have no idea what you’re talking about.”
tea. Kreacher is not –”
“Well, this is going to be a horrible few days. Irate women popping in unannounced whenever they please and expecting me to take any potion they happen to have. Wouldn’t have presumed otherwise, really. They
Covered in soap and trying to find anything that might be shampoo, the water went cold and Harry yelped. He jerked when the icy water hit him, and a cascade of bottles joined his feet. Cursing, Harry tried to put them back while avoiding the stream of glacier water from the shower head.
He ignored Harry and continued back and forth several times. Abruptly, he stopped and whispered tensely, “we had it wrong.”
“Ah, Miss is here. Again.” Kreacher reentered the kitchen with a scowl, pretending he hadn't been the one to slam the nearest cupboard.
Malfoy looked down his nose and said, “scared of a little competition, Potter?”
“Yes.” Harry frowned at her. “Hermione, we have magic. Muggles can't do what we do. They just can’t.”
. Potter’s head flung back, and he let out a strangled sound.
was involved somehow.
him. How could a receptionist he’d just met have any idea where he
Malfoy was looking at Harry with wide eyes and wisely continued to say nothing.
Likewise surprised, Malfoy paused before offering, “good morning?”
Curly– Williams, was it? – threw his hands in the air. “Oh, so you can rough him up a bit more? If he calls in lawyers, we’ll never get him on anything even
Malfoy grabbed the teapot gleefully and poured himself a cup. He was about to set it back down when he glanced at Harry. With extreme nonchalance that was obviously fake, he summoned another cup and filled it too. Then he roughly shoved it across the table, sloshing tea over the sides as it stopped in front of Harry.
“You could just ask!” Harry responded more harshly than intended. He breathed out and started again more quietly, “when he got here yesterday, he was –”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I should have guessed you’d poke your nose in. Never could sit by when there was a mystery to solve.”
Malfoy’s face soured. “Wonderful.”
Hermione’s face shifted oddly as she turned to scrutinize Malfoy. “Do you know what happened?”
“She doesn’t know I’m Harry Potter.”
“Hello, Victoire.” He scooped her up and gave her a toss into the air. “How is the most beautiful princess in the world today?”
“Jesus, how much did you have?”
Ginny gave half a smile as she said, “well, at least you know that. Be careful, Harry. He’ll do anything to get what he wants. Anything. Don’t trust him.”
Oddly, this advice seemed to work a bit. Harry remembered the feeling of being buffeted by gusts of wind, of having his broom pitched this way and that and only regaining control when he used the bursts of wind to angle himself for the next.
George smiled rapturously. “The Brick is going to be my crowning achievement. It’s going to power entertainment, instant communication, unlimited access to information, and cat images.”
A moment of silence passed while Malfoy just stared at him.
Harry went to bed happy that night. Sure, they still didn’t know who was responsible for the attack on Malfoy and Harry was at a dead end with leads, but he’d gotten to spend most of the day playing with toys and kicking Malfoy’s arse at tiny quidditch.
“Does your mum know what happened to you?” Her tone was just as intense but had lost some of its sharpness.
Harry gazed at him passively in stony silence.
“Harry, put the baby down, she’s not a quaffle,” Mrs. Weasley scolded as she entered the room.
Malfoy tapped both Ear-Bugs and handed them back to Harry. “I guess the Weasleys might pull themselves out of poverty after all,” he said dismissively.
Kreacher vanished and Malfoy set to his stew expeditiously. He dropped his spoon into an empty bowl and stood only minutes after he’d sat down.  “Owl your secret mistress and tell her to meet you at ten. Only old people go out at seven on a Friday night. I need to go get ready."
“I’m not trusting him. I’m…” Babysitting? Is that what he was doing? Harry’s mind hysterically supplied him with an image of gently tucking Malfoy into a crib and then choking him with a bottle.
your self-righteous friends, after all.” He continued babbling caustically, “what shall we do to pass the time between visits? Should we do facials and braid each other’s hair? Want to talk about our feelings? Talk about boys?”
“I don’t know.”
To Harry, she said, “I’ll be back in a week. I’m going to have George check in on you daily.”
That’s what you said. And I agreed. I’ve felt ‘really fucking awful’ twice. Both times it was when you left here without me. I was completely better as soon as you were back.” With the resignation of a condemned man, he intoned, “it’s
Harry groaned and forced himself up. Plastering on what he hoped was a comforting smile, he headed for the sitting room. “Hello, Malfoy,” he greeted.
Harry gave a small smile. “Thanks for not, you know, interrogating him with regulated substances or flinging Stinging Hexes at him.”
“What the fuck was that?” Malfoy was looking at him with narrow eyes and a cautious expression.
Harry gave himself a squeeze and began moving with more speed.
“Levitation charm, Mr. Potter,” she said with an arched eyebrow. Clearly, her composure was returning.
Harry ran a hand through his shaggy hair and scratched at the stubble on his chin as he looked at the house in question. It was painted a soft yellow and had potted plants on the porch. A neat hedge lined the lawn and the flower beds were full of summer blooms. It looked quiet and peaceful. Normal.
“You stole from goblins. A dragon.”
Head Auror Robards looked like he was doing the same.

It was dark when Harry returned to the vacant seeming building. They should have been open for a few hours now. There were no signs of life on the empty street as Harry checked his glamour one last time.
person.”
a baby!”
Fucking
“That’s stupid. No team is going to sign a player just because they know me.” The very notion was off-putting. Professional quidditch was about skill and talent. Ginny would need to train hard, but she could definitely make it to the pro level someday.
Harry was halfway out of his seat, ready to go
Harry ignored Malfoy's raised eyebrows.
Abruptly switching tactics, Harry said, “you’re right. It’s Malfoy. Draco. He was hurt, and I’d like to know why.”
She looked back at Malfoy with narrowed eyes for a long moment. “You’re not telling me everything,” she accused with surety.
“Yeah, I reckon I could do with another.” It was that or go back to his Malfoy-contaminated house until his next appointment. The less contact he had with the git, the better.
“How’s work?” With any luck, Harry could get the information he needed quickly, make his excuses, and get out of there.
The humming broke off as Kreacher looked at Harry sharply. Slowly, he reached deeply into a cupboard and pulled out a new container of tea that looked rather ordinate. “Master Draco is needing
He managed to squeeze himself into the clothes and headed back downstairs. Entering the sitting room, he tried not to whine as he complained, “these don’t fit.”
Harry ripped the shower curtain aside and stepped into the tub. More fancy bottles littered the wall shelf and the tub’s edge. A lone bar of soap sat amidst all the finery and Harry snatched it up and started scrubbing with perhaps a bit more vigor than necessary.
“Thanks for coming to see me, Harry,” Bill said, flipping his hair effeminately.
What. The.
“Let me see that.” George brushed by Harry and grabbed the parchment. Malfoy relinquished it with smug satisfaction.
“There was an advert in Quidditch Weekly for miniature players that can play against each other. I got him two teams.”
Kreacher peeked around the corner and said, “Master Draco’s illness is lasting for hours while you is away. Kreacher is not being able stop it.”
Harry frowned in concentration as he tried to remember. An image of Mrs. Malfoy looking fierce and powerful emerged in his mind.
Miraculously, Malfoy stopped. He firmly pushed Harry toward the front room and deliberately placed himself back between them, glaring at Ginny with challenge.
He stepped up behind Potter and squeezed a firm, round cheek. He kneaded it gently, and then, without warning, brought his hand up and back down with a loud
an Auror was attacked on his property. Congratulations, your hunch was right.”
“Shut up. Let’s go.”
“I,” George straightened the collar of his robes with mock self-importance, “am a businessman. I know you have to work with people you might not like or agree with. Just don’t get obsessive this time. You were pretty annoying in your sixth year.”
Potter groaned loudly as soon as his hand gripped his cock.
“Again,” Alecto snapped.
“You wanted answers. This is fair, and I can finally have a cup of damned tea.”
“Tea will not be necessary,” she said shortly. “I’ve come for Draco and then we will be leaving.”
Harry really wanted to die.
Malfoy paused and then started cracking up again. “Merlin, no! Can you imagine?”
Harry was still pondering the implications of his house liking someone else better when Narcissa continued, “I will find who did this, I swear it, but I need him to be safe until I do.”
bint. Getting
He nodded his head sharply and moved past Harry. As he did so, there was an awkward shuffle where Harry tried to move back and Malfoy tried to turn to get by, and instead of avoiding contact, Malfoy’s waist brushed across Harry’s hand. The brief touch jolted Harry like lightening, flashing heat through him in a torrential rush. He heard Malfoy inhale sharply as he paused.
“Find the leather petal, Auror Potter,” Roberts whispered just loud enough for Harry to hear.
Pain flashed over her face. “I don’t believe the injuries are that bad. No internal trauma. No spell damage. I healed the injuries that were still bleeding freely. He will be fine.” That last seemed to be said mostly to herself.
“Essentially, yes,” Red Lips sat back with a shrug. “Most find that the tradeoff for a bit of gossip isn’t worth it. We provide a service that is hard to find in Wizarding Britain.”
“Do you know who did it? Did you find them?” he blurted.
“Not at the moment.” He grinned tightly at Malfoy who nodded back with a teacup salute.
“Why would you say that?” he hedged.
“Shh,” Malfoy breath was hot against Harry’s ear, “I’m Harvey, stupid.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “What?! No way! You said he’ll be fine!”
“Well, not just yet. You have to be good first. Watch me. No touching.”
"Lead on, O Fun One." Malfoy gestured to the entrance grandly.
“No.”
think you’re a complete twat. But, you know, you’re also not completely horrible.”
Pointing to the base of the flower, Malfoy said, “I’d say three. Here, here, and here.”
hunch says there’s something we don’t know.” Harry felt his temper slipping. “If I could just get in there, I know I could –“
Strong muscles that met Harry’s every move, every thrust. He would pause, deep inside them, savoring the feeling and kiss their spine, the nape of their neck. Run a hand along a long, lean body and feel the smoothness of their skin.
“Emilia, please, do you have anything that would help me?”
at fieldwork. No one had a higher catch rate than him. Fewer people were injured, and more criminals were imprisoned when he was called in.
“Yes, Sir,” Potter moaned.
Malfoy smirked. “Kreacher, does Potter have any clothes that actually fit him and don’t look secondhand?”
"Fun," Malfoy repeated faintly. "Far be it from me to stop you from having 'fun' at Ursa's."
A man and a woman went in. A little while later, two women and two men together. Shortly after that, two men. No one seemed tense or like anything might be awry. He noticed that when people exited, they usually left entirely, through the beaded curtain and, presumably, back home.
Harry sat at his desk and put his head in his hands. His pulse began to slow and rational thought resumed. He shouldn’t have jumped at Malfoy like that. He'd always had a knack for saying things that would set Harry off but he couldn't have known how badly Harry would respond to that particular charge. Harry himself was surprised at how strongly he'd reacted. Malfoy had just been being a prat. A prat that had been on Death’s doorstep yesterday. He was glad Kreacher had intervened when he did.
Potter swiftly obeyed and Draco took his time walking over and sitting down. When Potter was fully nude and on his knees again, Draco let his eyes wander. “Lean back on your hands so I can look at you properly.”
The fire roared again, and George stepped out. “Mum, you can’t just – Oh. Everything alright, Harry? Ferret?”
never – hurt her in any way she didn’t agree to.”
It was a relief to leave the main thoroughfare and move onto a side street. Harry followed Malfoy into a toy shop he’d never been into before and immediately mourned the loss of a childhood that could have been. Everything was brightly packaged and cheery. Stuffed animals cavorted in a pen, a train set chugged through the air overhead, and a display of action figures strutted around impressively, striking the occasional heroic pose.
Ginny’s eyes were wide, and her freckles stood out against her white face.
Fill me with your come. I want to feel you come deep in my arse. Your cock is so hard. Fill me with your come, Harry.”
“And a firewhiskey. Make it a double,” Malfoy added, “I like to feel it in my throat.”
Heart stuttering, Harry softly said, “yes, I’ve killed someone.”
He was about to pointedly look elsewhere when he realized one of the dancers was Malfoy. From behind, he’d just been another nameless body in the writhing mass. When he suddenly turned around, his eyes had locked on Harry’s. No matter how much Malfoy altered his appearance, there was no mistaking that challenging stare. There was a man pressed up behind him and a woman pressed in front, but Malfoy’s gaze never broke from Harry’s. Malfoy didn’t miss a beat while maintaining eye contact. Arms raised high, each switch of a hip seemed to cause the bass to pulse, and the couple incasing him looked like they were worshiping a god.
“Oh, fuck off, Potter! Your Debt doesn’t include hand-holding and hen-pecking.” Malfoy’s lip curled with derision.
Curly kept talking but his voice faded to an annoying buzz as Harry stopped listening and got a good look at the woman. The first thing he noticed were the angry red marks circling her wrists. It looked like rope burns. Her face was pale and damp, and it made the bruising on her neck stand out starkly. Harry’s vision was narrowing down to a red tunnel as her eyes fluttered just the slightest bit open and she smiled a hazy, dreamy smile at him.
It was Kreacher’s turn to shrug. He pointed toward the front door and mimed a knocking motion.
Harry wanted to vomit.
“I don’t.”
The blanket pile didn’t move or emit any sound.
He eased into bed feeling relaxed and content. The pillow cradled his head just right and the blankets were pleasantly warm and soft. There was really only one other thing that could further ease him into sleep. And really, hadn't he told himself earlier that he needed some release?
Draco used his grip to still Potter’s bobbing head and slowly pushed his prick back down Potter’s throat. Once Potter’s nose was buried in his blond curls, Draco held him there until he felt Potter’s throat start to convulse. He pulled out to let him catch his breath and then pushed back in. This time he just bumped the back before moving out and then pushing back in. He kept up a steady pace as he began face fucking Potter.
When Harry stepped into his kitchen, he saw that Malfoy was clutching his head.
None came.
was left unsaid. “Before that, I was in the gardens at the Manor.”
An hour later, Harry stood outside an interview room trying very hard not to yell, roll his eyes, or hit anyone.
Still nothing.
it, eyes still closed, mouth partly open and chest heaving. Another
“She’s very pretty,” Harry continued. Jealousy tended to be a factor as well. “Maybe you aren’t enough for her. Was she going to leave you?”
“I… don’t think so?” Malfoy was the unlucky subject of all her questions.
“The one that set off our Detection Ward as soon as you entered,” she indicated a shimmering light over Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, you can keep it until after you’ve signed. We are completely discreet about our patrons.”
“Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?”
And then Malfoy took the finger he’d pressed to his lips and put it in his mouth. He added another and slid them in and out, his tongue dancing around them, and gave Harry full eye contact while he did it. He leaned back in his armchair and ran his other hand up his chest. A small noise escaped him as his fingers brushed over a nipple.
Harry’s face must have shown what he thought about that because she held up a finger before he could vocalize an opinion.
Draco brought his hand down on the other cheek. “’Yes,
“Yes, S-sir. I want your cock to fill me and rip me open. I want you in my tight, wet arse.”
Harry thought Roberts would try to backpedal, try make himself sound less possessive. Jealous men didn’t like having their possessiveness pointed out.
just how filthy and depraved they could be. I also didn’t know how much I’d like it.”
Laughing, Malfoy threw a wad of clothing at him. “Go change,
Harry’s happiness at seeing Teddy soured just a little. “Yeah, he’s here somewhere.”
“But it’s just you?” Malfoy quirked an eyebrow.
Malfoy immediately began working on the fastenings of Harry’s robes. He shoved them roughly off Harry’s shoulders while pushing him back, and then dropped to his knees. Malfoy grinned wickedly as he looked up at Harry and ran a hand over the bulge in his trousers.
“Me, arrogant?” Harry fumed.
Draco Malfoy sat in his throne-like desk chair as he casually flipped through a file. His first appointment of the evening was due to arrive in a few minutes and he thought it best to review the contract to keep it fresh in his mind. The terms were not as comprehensive as he might like, but there was still a lot to work with here. It was always exciting to work with a brand-new client. Draco flipped the file shut with a grin of anticipation.
Heartened, Harry pulled harder on his edge of the blanket. “I swear to God, you arsehole, I
Hermione hesitated before asking forcefully, “why did you come to Harry’s?”
Harry shook himself.
“Harry!” Robards barked. “Sit. Down.”
Roberts opened his eyes, and his face took on a placid, disinterested expression. He sat himself up taller, squared his shoulders, and said in a tone just as smooth and strong as Harry’s had been, “Pricilla isn’t most women.”
Malfoy’s face sobered as he said, “I am extremely surprised Granger would go on holiday after that.”
Narcissa ignored his incredulous expression. “He was attacked on Malfoy Manor’s grounds.” She paused significantly and gave Harry direct eye contact. “That means, Mr. Potter, that someone entered our estate without my knowledge.”
Malfoy didn’t look up. “I’m fine.”
“You don’t even know what happened.”
, Harry thought savagely. If Malfoy did anything to upset Teddy today, Harry would beat him bloody. Kreacher would just have to mend him all over again. Harry had been drinking swill tea for years; the old house elf had nothing to withhold for his good behavior.
Harry felt an unwelcome flutter in his groin and stared, open mouthed, utterly unable to look away. Jesus Christ, Malfoy was fucking
“Huh,” George slowly nodded, “I hadn't taken that into account. You could be right.”
“Ferret.”
“Do not lie to me, Draco,” she snapped, “I know you leave the manor some nights.”
Jaw flexing and mouth pinching so tightly his lips turned white, Malfoy arched a sleek eyebrow and turned away from them without a word. His first few steps were cautious and then gained surety as he continued.
“Harry, I really don’t think –”
Harry realized he was staring when Malfoy looked up at him and cocked an eyebrow. “This is making my eyes hurt. Play a game of tiny quidditch?”
Harry ran for the fireplace and threw himself in almost before the Floo Powder could touch the flames. His kitchen resolved before him in a flash of green and he was spit back out.
Her smile was just shy of condescending. “Narcissa came ‘round for evening tea yesterday. It be a short visit. Fool girl never did like hearing the truth stated plainly.”
It was everything Draco could have hoped for. Potter attacked his cock with enthusiasm, swallowing it down in one quick glide and then pulling off with a wet pop before diving back in. Potter’s tongue was a hard press against the underside of his cock and he felt himself hit the back of that tight throat again and again. Draco was bathed in heat and wetness.
“Me and Teddy are childhood friends. Did you know he’s your cousin?”
“No, no. Completely safe. Promise.”
Harry didn’t need to ask which year. “A bit. I mean, she knows about our hunt for horcruxes and, obviously, she was there at the end…”
“Merlin’s balls.” Malfoy rubbed a hand across his face. “I was attacked? How? The wards –?”
“I – yeah. Let me just –” Finally able to move, Harry bent down and gathered the body in his arms. The limbs flopped uncooperatively, and the head lolled to the side. A weak moan came from under the hood and Harry almost dropped the body in surprise. He’d been thinking of it as ‘the body,’ not believing it was alive. With effort and a grunt, Harry stood up with his awkward burden. “Follow me.”
“I told you to stay and drink tea!”
Draco cleared his throat and tried to tame his predatory smile before answering, “send him in.”
“I had no idea he was going to do that. I only left him unsupervised for a few hours.”
“Good,” Malfoy said, somewhat deflated, “see that you don’t.”
“I got top marks on every practical for Disguise and Concealment while I was in training,” Harry declared, feeling rather insulted.
Exasperated, Harry glanced over at Malfoy. “Look, just – Just sit there and drink tea. I’ll be back.”
“Now?” Harry asked. “On a Saturday? Diagon is going to be a madhouse!”
“It is better,” Malfoy returned archly. “I’ve never had to lower myself to secondhand items or low-quality goods.”
much better.”
“I think ‘mess’ might be a bit strong,” Harry grumbled.
“Damn,” Harry said.
Harry entered the interview room after Taylor. Taylor went to lean against the far wall behind their suspect and Harry took the seat across the table from the piece of shit. He flipped open a file, studied it for a moment, and then finally looked up. “So, Mr. Roberts – “
Next, Harry started in on his Ever-Changing Puzzle. It was much more difficult than the muggle variety. The pieces changed shape until you connected them correctly to their adjoining pieces and, because the puzzle changed, he wouldn’t know what the puzzle was until it was completed.
Reluctantly, Harry entered and closed the door. Malfoy kept walking and Harry followed him into a sitting room. A large portion of the room was given over to computers, screens, and tripods. Against a wall, a large, overstuffed armchair sat facing the mass of technology. A few of the screens displayed images of the chair.
“Of course.” Harry smiled back, raised his glass to her and downed the rest of his drink.
Harry left the bathroom and went to the sitting room. Upon his entering, Narcissa cocked her head and raised a sardonic eyebrow at him.
“So,” Malfoy said, “Mother doesn’t know who did it.”
Malfoy waved a negligent hand. “That. Nothing. I had a momentary relapse and he wanted to run off and fetch you. I told him I was fine, and look,” he gestured to himself, “I am.”
“It feels so good,” he moaned. “I’m so full, stretched so wide.” He continued to look at Harry while he fucked himself for several more minutes.
Harry remembered how shamelessly Malfoy had flirted with Mary and the sinful way he'd moved on the dancefloor. “Oh.”

Harry was still gaping at him in bewilderment when the bartender leaned over and said, “Saul likes ‘em buff and tends to come on a bit strong at first.”
Mark gave Malfoy a slow smile. He winked at Harry and asked, “what’ll you have?”
