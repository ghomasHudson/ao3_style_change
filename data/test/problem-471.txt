Harry got a thoughtful look on his face for a moment, before he said, “On second thought, I think this conversation is best had in public.  Colin get out of Godric’s quarters immediately.”
"A pleasure to meet you, Professor," Ryan said with a smile.  "My cousin, Matthew, spoke very highly of you."
The Halloween Ball will be starting in fifteen minutes.  I suppose I really shouldn’t be writing this right now.  I should go down to the common room, meet Hermione, and then go down to the Great Hall.  I’m still worried about how Ron will react when he finds out that I’m taking Hermione to the ball.  I just hope that he doesn’t do anything stupid.
And I will tell you a story true.
The five Ravenclaw boys finished getting ready for the ball, before they left their dorm to go and collect their dates.  Well, except for Kevin and Stephen obviously, since they were each other’s dates.
“Ah much better,” the woman said.  “Now, I’m sure you must be wondering why I’m contacting you.  His Supreme Lordship is busy with important matters of state and asked me to contact you for an update on his behalf.”
“Yes, Nicolas Delaney, you remember him, right? He’s Professor Byrne’s grandson, the transfer student from Beauxbatons.”
*	*	*
“Correct, Miss Granger,” Bill said with a smile. “Since this potion is actually well beyond N.E.W.T level, please take ten very well-earned points for Gryffindor.”
In other news, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named personally led a devastating attack on Inverness and the surrounding area on Saturday.  Early reports indicate that at least a hundred wizards and witches are now dead and even more injured.  The attack also claimed the lives of an unknown number of Muggles, though it is believed to number close to a thousand.
“James and Lily Potter... alive...  Albus, how is this possible?”  Molly asked.
Kneeling between Oliver's legs, Matt smiled at him for a moment, before he leaned down and began to kiss Oliver's ever-hardening member through the material that was covering it. As Matt did this, Oliver pointed his wand at the bedroom doors and mumbled a locking charm, followed by a silencing charm. He certainly didn't want to give Ryan anymore ammunition to embarrass them with, not to mention the fact that he did not relish the thought of Professor Snape overhearing them.
“Yes, Harry, it’s different,” Hermione answered.  “Honestly don’t you ever read?  The wizarding world has absolutely no problem with same-sex relationships and same-sex marriages are one hundred percent legal.”
“Yes, sir, I am,” Draco answered.  “A fact that I would change in a heartbeat if I could.”
JEAN-LUC PHILLIPE BYRNE, born 13-12-1959, age 37
“Goodbye, Mr. Cromwell,” Professor Lasinius said as he watched Ryan head back to the castle.
"Now, on to the start of term announcements," Dumbledore said, as he once again paused to take a sip from his goblet before continuing. "As always the forest on the grounds of this school is forbidden to all students. Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to remind you that magic is not allowed in the hallways between classes and that all products sold by Zonko's and Weasley's Wizard Wheezes are on the banned items list. To read the list in it's entirety please see the list posted outside of Mr. Filch's office, although I warn you that it now numbers close to a thousand items and will take quite awhile to read. Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will begin in about two weeks, as soon as we are satisfied that the added protection wards around the pitch are at their strongest.
Aarik groaned and said, “Looks like the Slytherin Ice Prince is right again,” as he pulled a small bag from the pocket of his robe, counted out five galleons and handed them to his boyfriend.
“No.”
Pausing for a few moments to let his words sink in, Bill went over to his desk, grabbed two old copies of Advanced Potion-Making and two sets of tarnished scales, which he placed in front of Harry and Ron, since neither of them had originally planned on taking the class and didn’t have the appropriate materials.
“Yes,” Ryan said.  “It said born on September 17, 1977 and died on June 24, 1995, age 17.”
To be continued...
“I can live with that,” Harry said.
Chapter Seventeen
“No, we can’t,” Corelian answered.  “While it is true that we Atlanteans do live underwater, we don’t actually live in water.  The nine shield artifacts shield our world from the water and create an artificial atmosphere very similar to that of the surface world.  We have air to breathe, clouds in the sky, and even weather like rain, snow, and hurricanes.  The only difference is that it is never what most people would consider daytime in Atlantis.  Being under the ocean, we don’t have access to the moon, the stars, or the sun, so magic creates all of the light and heat that we need.”
Exiting the box, the three of them quickly got in the small line of people waiting to be searched by security, before being cleared to head over to the security desk to register their wands.  Arriving at the security desk, the man seated behind the counter said, “Wand, please.”
HEPZIBAH ESTHER SMITH, born 03-03-1839, died 21-06-1944, age 105
Aarik looked first at Draco, then at Madam Pomfrey, before looking back at Draco and then sealing the blond into a passionate kiss.  Madam Pomfrey smiled, happy that her patient was distracted and thought, ‘Note to self: when Mr. Malfoy needs medical attention - ask Mr. Potter to distract him.  Saves the headache of listening to Mr. Malfoy’s childish moaning.’
“I’m happy you agreed to let me sponsor you,” Ryan said.
*	*	*
“Yes, Professor Dumbledore is anxious to get it brewed,” Nick said.  “He wants to see Tom Riddle and try and assess how dangerous a rescue mission would be.”
Arriving back at Hogwarts, Professor Severus Snape ran as fast as his feet could carry him from the gates of Hogwarts, up to the castle.  Once inside, he stopped running, but kept up as brisk of a walk as possible, sending one of his withering glares at anyone who dared get in his way.  Finally arriving at the gargoyle, Snape said the password and stepped onto the stairway after the gargoyle moved out of the way.
“Why are you telling me this?”  Harry asked.
Meanwhile, in an unknown location, a teenage boy with black hair stood with his back against the slimy, stone wall of his prison.  The boy was deathly pale and so thin that you could see every bone in his body.  His clothes were ripped and damp and all of his exposed skin was covered in bruises, scratches, and a thick coating of dirt.  His feet ached from standing too long and he wished desperately that he could sit down, but the cold steel manacles encircling his wrists held him in a standing position.
Draco's Journal - August 25, 1996
“Well, Matt what do you think?”  Oliver asked.  “Should we get married in Atlantis?”
“I don’t have to admit anything,” Hermione said.  “Studying is fun.”
Harry stopped and said, “You’re no fun, you know.”
“I agree,” Bill said.  “Especially since I’m a professor and you’re a student.  The clause that Rowena added to the rules makes it legal, but some people will still disapprove.  I’m also not entirely sure how my family will react when they find out I’m dating a Slytherin.”
“No, Harry Potter told me,” Nick answered.
“Yeah,” answered Harry.  “My first crush was on Oliver Wood.  I happened to see him in the shower once after Quidditch practice mid-way through third year.  I’ve had a few fantasies about Oliver.  That’s why I didn’t sign up for his Art class, because I figured dealing with Bill in Potions would be enough of a strain.”
"My, my, it knows my name.  So, mortal, if you’re not here to die then why are you here?"
Immediately following Fencing class, Harry hurried up to the hallway outside Gryffindor tower.  He’d sent Hedwig with a message to Ginny to meet him by the Fat Lady after classes had ended for the day.
“Lily, you’re definitely a sight for sore eyes,” Remus said as he pulled Lily into a hug.
“Salazar Sebastian Slytherin, I assume,” Nick said in Parseltongue, figuring that his ancestor would appreciate the gesture.  “Yes, I am your heir, Nickolas Phillipe Delaney.”
He thought they should only teach pure-bloods,
"Why have you come to my realm still wearing your flesh?"  Valshar asked as Draco approached.  "It does not matter though.  If you are so eager for death, then you shall find it.  Touch my hand, you will feel no pain."
As for how I’m coping with my mother’s death, it’s been very hard. I don’t want my fellow Slytherins to see me cry and I’ve been doing that a lot lately. I really do wish that there was some magical way to bring my mother back, but it is one of the first things that young witches and wizards are taught growing up: magic can do many things, but resurrecting the dead is not one of them. It is of course possible to raise the dead as mindless servants known as Inferi, but I obviously have no intention of doing that to my mother.
"That's cool that you'll be seventeen, soon," Ryan said. "I can't wait until I'm seventeen."
Hermione remained quiet for a few moments and then said, in a tone that was as cold as ice, “Ronald Bilius Weasley!  If you ever call me that again, prefect or not, I will hex you into the middle of next week!”
“On the contrary, Michael, I can,” Adrian said.  “You’re using one of the Nimbus 2001’s gifted to the Slytherin team.  You’re no longer on the team; therefore, you cannot continue using one of the teams’ brooms.”
"Him?"  Arthur asked.  "You mean the basilisk?"
“The bloke I lost my virginity to,” Harry said, “and took the virginity of I might add, is the oldest of Ron’s brothers, also known as our Potions professor, Bill Weasley.”
Matthew returned the grin and said, “Well, that’s true, plenty of people to look at and lust over.  However, one has to remember that the Muggle world’s view on same-sex relationships is vastly different than our world’s view.  Few countries legally allow same-sex marriages and in some countries, it’s even illegal for them to have sex.  In fact, in some countries being gay is even punishable by death.”
“So, if you two are a part of this Circle,” Dumbledore said, “does your presence here leave Atlantis and the shield artifacts you mentioned undefended?”
“Valid questions,” Corelian answered, as he waved his hand and conjured three more chairs.  “If you’ll have a seat, I will do my best to explain.”
I still can't believe that my mother is gone. She didn't deserve to die. Oh Gods, my mother is dead. Why? Why?! Oh if my jackass of a sire were here right now I know he'd probably want to kill me right now, considering that I'm sitting here crying my eyes out as I write this. As the Gods as my witnesses, I swear if I ever see that man ever again, I will not be held responsible for my actions. He deserves to die a very slow and very painful death for what he's done to my mother! I can hear my mother's voice in my head, saying that I shouldn't let my anger consume me and I know that she's right but, right now my emotional wounds are just too fresh.
Over a month had passed, and it was now Friday, December Twentieth, 1996.  It was the final day of the fall term at Hogwarts.  The students who would be returning to their homes for the holidays would be leaving this afternoon and those staying behind would find the castle much quieter than normal.  Upon the start of the spring term, students in Professor Cromwell’s Music class would have to get used to calling him by a different name.  For in just three days, he would become Professor Matthew Cromwell-Wood, following his marriage to long-time boyfriend, Professor Oliver Wood.
*	*	*
“You said that this Draco’s father killed his mother,” Godric answered.  “Well, it wouldn’t be the first time that a Malfoy man has killed his wife.  In 830, Etienne Malfoy, the father of one of Salazar’s favorite students, Armand Malfoy, murdered his wife Giselle after he caught her in bed with the gardener.  He also killed the gardener and then killed himself.  It happened the summer before Armand started at Hogwarts, the first Malfoy to attend the school.  Etienne and Giselle were in the process of moving the family to England, but they never made it.”
Colin nodded and turned to leave.  He was about two feet from McGonagall’s desk when she called out, “Creevey?  You might want this.”
Matthew and Oliver turned to look at one another, the color draining from both of their faces, as they had obviously never even thought of such a scenario when discussing their plans for the future.  Finally, Matthew said, “You know, I never really thought of that.  I mean, the idea of the soul-bonding seems romantic and like the ultimate commitment, but when you put it that away, I can see why you say that it’s idiotic and selfish.”
"Yeah, definitely," Ryan responded as he followed his uncle through the streets.
“Near as I can tell he’s fine,” Harry said.  “According to the diagnostic spell that Madame Pomfrey taught us, he’s under the influence of a Dreamless Sleep potion.”
"Of course," Kingsley Shacklebolt replied, before pointing his wand at Lucius' still form, and said two spells in rapid succession.
Not wanting to waste anymore time, Asheera quickly made her way over to the Floo and stepped into the flames.
“You know, I haven’t said anything,” Ryan said, “but this whole long lifespan thing has been on my mind ever since I found out about it and I’m really beginning to get upset about it.”
Molly and Arthur Weasley were worried when Professor Dumbledore Floo-called them at the Burrow and told them to drop everything and come to Hogwarts immediately.  Of course, the worry they felt was not lessened at all by the fact that the Headmaster was being his normal mysterious self.  He simply told them to come to Hogwarts and everything would be explained when they got there.  The old man simply grinned, his eyes twinkling like mad, and refused to give them any more details.
“They’re just speechless,” Justin answered with a grin.  “They were positive that Ryan was telling tales about being your heir and now when faced with undeniable proof they don’t know what to say.”
“Wow,” Ryan muttered.  “A collection of rare books this size would be worth a fortune.  I remember Matt saying that if we combined our vaults with Oliver’s, Draco would still have more money, but all these books would be worth even more than Matt’s, Oliver’s, Draco’s and my vaults combined.”
“Then you may have given Colin permission without realizing it,” Zach said.  “Helga told me to always make sure to specify people’s names, because if I didn’t everyone in hearing distance will get permission to enter the room.”
“Tom?”  Zach asked softly.
“My grandmother thinks it’s a soft option.”
A look of sudden comprehension crossed Ron's face as he looked to his best friend for confirmation.
"I'm not," Harry said. "Portkey doesn't count though, because I don't have to cast any form of spell. I just have to touch it at the designated time tomorrow evening and I'm off to the Weasley's house. You won't see me again until after school lets out next summer."
“Sealed?”  Harry asked.
Justin smiled at the look on Ryan’s face and explained, “My housemates have all been extremely protective of me since I was petrified by a basilisk in second year.”
Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Harry stopped him and said, "Ron, I know you don't agree, so just please agree to disagree. I'm not in the mood to watch my two best friends fighting right now."
Taking some time to mull over what Corelian had just said, Rufus asked, “Aren’t you a bit young to be an ambassador, boy?”
“I see your point.  Of course, we also have a few things in common.  We’re both Seekers and we both lost our virginity to guys we weren’t in love with.”
“Why?”  Hermione asked.
“That’s fine, Hermione,” Draco said with a smile as he took both Hermione’s dress and his new robe over to the proprietress.
JONATHAN JAMES POTTER, born 17-08-1892, died 12-06-1979, age 87
“Oh yeah,” Nick said at once.  “I’m glad to finally be seventeen; I’ve been looking forward to it for so long.”
-o-0-o-
Twenty-year-old Matthew Cromwell stood in the middle of his bedroom at Cromwell Hall, naked from the waist up as the talented hands of his intended roamed all over his back and their equally talented lips kissed and sucked at the nape of Matt's neck. Even after seven long and very happy years together, Matt had been very nervous when he had finally asked the big question. He had gone to Diagon Alley, bought the ring, and then carried it around with him for months before he finally worked up enough courage to ask the question. Looking back on it, Matt would be the first to admit that his nervousness was stupid because no sooner had he opened the box, his boyfriend said yes, before Matt even got the chance to say a word.
Enraged that Lucius would use the Cruciatus Curse on her beloved son, and further angered that he would call her a bitch, Narcissa slapped Lucius across the face and said, "Go to the Hells!"
"Stupefy!"
“You like him, though?”  Lavender asked.
“Why Ron,” Hermione said.  “I’m shocked.  What brought on this turn around?”
“Could we get back to you on that?”  Matthew asked, after a moment of conferring with Oliver.  “We’d like to sleep on that decision.”
Almost instantly, the aspects of the Archduke Belial and his daughter, the Lady Fierna, the joint rulers of Phlegethos, appeared before Asmodeus. An Archdevil’s aspect is the physical embodiment of a portion of their life force, created to serve as a proxy on another plane. In this way, they can spread their influence without placing themselves in immediate danger. While the aspect and the Archdevil have different bodies, they share the same mind, so whatever one knows, so does the other.
“Thank you, Pucey,” Draco said, which was exactly why he had asked Pucey to do this in the first place.

“Say you’ll at least consider going out with Nick. I mean, obviously, I don’t expect you to do anything now, while he’s underage, but after the tenth...”
CEDRIC JEREMIAH DIGGORY, born 17-09-1977, died 24-06-1995, age 17
“We don’t date though, remember? Dating would imply that we’re a couple, which we’re not. We’re just very good friends.”
“Have you heard from him lately?”  Ryan asked.  “I haven’t.  With the battle in Inverness this past weekend, I’m rather worried.”
ZACHARIAS ETHAN SMITH, born 17-09-1979, age 16
Of course, the Weasleys were not the only ones to get the urgent request from the Headmaster, as Amos and Hannah Diggory had also been asked to drop everything and come to Hogwarts post haste.  Unlike Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, however, the Diggorys were not worried as much as they were bewildered by the request, as they could not understand what could possibly be so important.  The only family member they had attending Hogwarts was their nephew Zacharias, but why contact them if there was a problem?  Surely, the Headmaster would have contacted Hannah’s brother Isaiah and his wife Katherine if there were a problem with their son.
‘If you only knew, Albus,’ Valen thought as he simply nodded to the headmaster and then said, “Well, I haven’t told Ryan this yet, but, the fact of the matter is I met him for the first time when he was two years old.”
"Of course," Barin said. "Just tell Barin what you'd like."
It was at this point that Matt notices Ryan and Justin standing behind Professor Lasinius and said, “Ryan? Mr. Finch-Fletchley, isn’t it? Please come in. Are you certain you can’t stay Valen? We just had some tea and biscuits delivered from the kitchen.”
“Goodbye, Professor.”
“Oh trust me, I did,” Lucius drawled.  “I raped that bitch sister of yours on several occasions; however, it was to no avail.  She just would not get pregnant again.  Looking back on it, I know she knew how to cast a few spells wandless.  I think she must have learned how to cast a Birth Control Charm wandless.”
“As of this past March,” Corelian answered, “I am 296 years old.  That’s ancient by human standards, but actually quite young by Atlantean standards, considering that most Atlanteans live an average of 750 plus years.”
“Because it was you,” Blaise answered.  “Draco said your name when he came.  I talked to him afterward and he admitted that he likes you.”
“Is that true, Colin?”  Harry asked.
“Harry, you shouldn’t be here,” Bill admonished. “Students aren’t allowed in the staff wing, unless invited by a professor.”
“You mean bribes?”
“Thank you, Minister Scrimgeour,” Queen Calliara said with the sweet smile of victory on her face.
“Um, you can call me Justin.”
*	*	*
“Yes, I know, Your Majesty,” his Supreme Lordship said.  “I am sorry for your loss.”
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”  Rufus demanded, as he pulled out his wand.  “Desist at once!”
“You can just sit anywhere for now,” Bill said as they arrived. “Don’t get too comfortable though, because you will be moving.”
By the time that Hermione returned to the Gryffindor common room, it was nearly empty.  Harry, who was asleep in one of cushy red armchairs, was the only person left in the room.  Hermione knew that Ron would be upstairs in his dorm, having retired early rather than spend time with Harry.  Ever since last week, when Harry had announced his intention to be friends with Draco, Ron had barely spoken two words to him.
“Yes and no?”  Ryan asked.  “What does that mean?”
Blaise remained quiet for a few minutes and then said, “Oh what the hell; Draco won’t be happy if he finds out I told you this, but I’ll deal with it.  Draco and I are occasional lovers.  We use one another to satisfy our libidos, but neither of us thinks about the other while doing it.  Up until yesterday I didn’t know who Draco thinks about, until he said the person’s name as he came.”
“The heirs’ identities have been discovered?”  McGonagall asked.  “Who are they?”
“Drawing too much power from one’s magical core can result in death, so only the most powerful of wizards would even consider using a charm that constantly draws power from their cores.”
“Well, I think I’m beginning to understand why you dislike him so much,” Ryan said.
This new hope shall stand against the evil,
“You remember how I always fainted when a Dementor came close to me?”
“Dining room?”
"You just sit down and put on the Sorting Hat," Matt said. "It does the rest."
Narcissa and Draco left on their little vacation a week before his birthday, so after spending the last nine days relaxing on a tropical beach, Draco's normally deathly pale skin did get a bit more color to it. He was still pretty pale after spending most of his childhood indoors, but it was certainly an improvement. Narcissa told him that he looked much better now and she was quite happy that he didn't resemble a walking corpse anymore. Draco laughed at that and had to agree.
Aarik and Draco’s kiss was interrupted when Aarik felt a hand on his shoulder.  Aarik turned his head and saw his mother, who was looking at him intently.
"Maybe it's for the best."
*	*	*
“Well, yes, I do,” Harry said.  “It’s just that when I looked at who owned the book prior to me I had a bit of a shock.  It was a pleasant one, but a shock nonetheless.”
“Have the bedrooms been cleaned yet?”
“Who is Teryn?”  Ryan asked.
“What does the bracelet do?”  Ryan asked.
Of course, what was worse was the fact that more than one player attacked Draco.  Yes, Draco managed to get out of the way before the Bludger that Goyle hit could hit him.  Crabbe’s poorly aimed Bludger only grazed Draco’s foot and didn’t do any serious damage.  Nevertheless, the fact that either of them had hit Bludgers at a teammate was bad enough in Adrian’s mind, whether they actually hit their intended target or not.
“If ever there was a reason to call in an exorcist,” Madam Pomfrey said after mumbling, “Quietus,” and putting her wand away, “Peeves is it.”
“I’m only sorry that I couldn’t have done it sooner,” the King said.  “But, as you well know, I couldn’t help you until I had the power of the throne behind me.”
“Oh dear, I should have remembered,” Rowena said.  “When I died I didn’t know how long it would be until my heir would find my quarters, but I never expected it to take over a millennium.  So, I only cast a preservation charm powerful enough to preserve the books for 500 years.”
“Is that true, Ryan?”  Kevin asked.
“As punishment, he was cast into Tartarus, while still alive, as both ruler and prisoner.  The Olympians chained him to Hades’ ebony throne and made him immortal.  They then cast a powerful spell on him that would cause him to change from a human to a skeleton of gigantic proportions.  Now, this transformation was extremely painful and very slow; it took a thousand years to be completed – one year for each innocent person that Valshar had tortured and killed.  To best understand how painful, imagine the pain of the Cruciatus Curse, multiplied by a hundred and applied non-stop for a thousand years.  That amount of pain would have been more then enough to kill him, but as the Olympians made him immortal, he had no choice but to endure it.”
"The goblins actually let you into Draco's vault?" Bill asked.
“Of course, Harry. Now, as you said, you should get going before you’re missed. I have to go to the library to check on something anyway, so you can sneak out ahead of me.”
"Yes," Charles said. "I know that you're on our side, but as I'm sure you know, it's not something we've told the Ministry about."
“Shutup, Malfoy, nobody was talking to you.”
“Well, I’m only 25,” Bill answered.  “And no, I haven’t been in the position long, only since the beginning of this school year.  The Headmaster transferred the former Potions professor into the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, so he brought me in to teach.  I’m normally a curse-breaker for Gringotts’ Bank, but I did get an Outstanding Potions N.E.W.T.”
“Well, he possessed a fake Tom Riddle to prevent Asmodeus from finding out he was on Earth,” Asheera said.  “Anytime any devil is summoned out of the Hells to the Mortal Plane, the King will know about it in a matter of a few minutes.  He won’t do anything if he senses that the devil is encased in binding magic to force them to do someone’s bidding, but as Voldemort summoned himself to Earth, he can’t appear in his true form or Asmodeus would find out and force him to return.”
“Who are you and what have you done with Malfoy?”
Draco visibly sighed with relief, “Thank Merlin!  I spent the entire trip back from Tartarus worrying that I was going to be in deep trouble when you found out I’d broken Apollo’s mirror.”
"Father, please, don't hurt him," Draco cried again as he gently scratched behind one of the puppy's ears.
“Hmm, well, I haven’t told many people myself,” Harry mused, “of course, I’ve only known since the early morning hours of yesterday.  So what’s the deal with my name?”
“It’s the only explanation that makes any sense,” Pansy said.  “Draco and I are destined to be together, so there is no way that he would ever have sex with anyone other than me unless he was forced to.”
"Same here," said the twins in perfect unison as they sat down on the floor near the fireplace.
To be continued...
“There is no student by that name that I’m aware of.”
Pulling out a large scroll of parchment that must have been Sirius' will, Dumbledore read though it and began to summarize the contents.
Of course, as I’ve already told you, I’ve fantasized about Harry on more than one occasion.  Of course, I haven't told you everything; a few details about those fantasies I’ve left out, dear journal.  To be honest, there have been times when I was having sex with Blaise that I found myself thinking about Harry and pretending that it was him rather than Blaise that I was doing the deed with.  The fact that Blaise has the same raven-colored hair and sparkling green eyes as Harry has certainly helped my fantasies.  Of course, Blaise is of Latino descent, so his skin is tanner than his, but I’ve found it easy to imagine that it’s just Harry with a very good suntan.
"How did you resist her charms?" Ron asked.
*	*	*
“So, should I call you that now?”
“Draco Lucien Malfoy, you must have been crazy to even consider this,” Draco said to himself.  Then after a few deep breaths, he said, “Well, I’m here now, so I might as well do what I came to do.”
“Well, then, I shall make arrangements for Mr. Ollivander to bring a selection of wands here for you to try,” Dumbledore said.  “I would just have you go to Diagon Alley and get them, but, seeing as how the four of you are supposed to be dead, I imagine that going to such a public place wouldn’t be a good idea.  At least until we figure out how to tell the rest of the world that you’ve all come back from the dead.”
Several of the Slytherins looked at Salazar’s portrait, shocked, and finally Vaisey spoke up, this time addressing the portrait, “You crazy old fool!  You’re just a portrait, you can’t take points!”
“Does it make a difference that Justin and Hermione are Muggle-born?”
Alone in Godric’s quarters, Aarik called out, “Dobby!”
“No, I haven’t,” Matt said, “and you’re not the only one who’s worried.  He usually checks in with me by Floo on Sunday nights.  Last night was the first time since I started teaching that he didn’t.”
“Yes, Ginny,” Harry confirmed.  “And Ryan is Ravenclaw’s heir and Nick is Slytherin’s heir.”
The school ran well for several years,
Professor Dumbledore had given the matter some thought, and after talking to the founders about it, they agreed that all Hogwarts staff members should at least have partial access to the quarters of the founders.  The magic of the rooms would allow the heirs to make specific rooms off limits, so, they’d still have plenty of privacy.
Looking at his friend’s reflection, Draco nodded approvingly and then picked up a nearly identical ensemble for himself, seeing as how Blaise was his date for the ball.  The difference was that Draco’s robe was green, with black trim and silver accents.
“Silence mortal known as Severus Snape, before I strike thee down where you stand!  My extended power of speech grows short and I will not answer anymore questions,” the Dullahan rasped as he waved his left hand at the door to the coach, causing it to open.  From within the black curtained coach, a blond head appeared and it was soon apparent who it belonged to.
“Really?”
“Three years?”  Nick asked.  “You mean you were seventeen as a fourth year student?”
“Very well, I shall return for my wand after my meeting with the Minister,” Corelian said.
“You dare bring anyone related to Godric into my quarters?”  Slytherin hissed in Parseltongue.
“Well, that, Zach, is a side effect of having been dead,” Asheera revealed.  “Souls do not age in Tartarus; they forever remain the age they were at their death.  When Valshar resurrects claimed souls, he simply restores them to their mortal bodies; he does not make them the age they should be based on their birthday.  So, while Cedric is technically 19 based on the year he was born, he’s actually only 17.”
Colin sighed and gathered his belongings before going up to McGonagall’s desk instead of leaving with his housemates.  For several minutes, McGonagall didn’t say anything and Colin was about to ask her what she wanted when she spoke, “I’ll be unable to sit your detention tonight.  You should report to Professor Flitwick instead.”
“How is that possible though?”  Hermione asked.  “How can a person born in 1926 be only 16 in 1996?”
“Ah, don’t bother,” Kevin said with a grin.  “I’ll just go find Stephen.  I’m sure he can take my mind off of that unpleasant mental image.”
“Oh, I forgot to mention that,” Corelian said.  “While the jewelry may look like it is made of silver, it’s actually made primarily of mythril.  Mythril a rare metal, but it’s abundant in Atlantis.  It looks like silver, but it’s also indestructible and feather-light.  For the wedding jewelry though a combination of mythril and orichalcum is used, because alone mythril is resistant to magic.  Orichalcum looks like gold in color, but it is inferior in value.  We charm it to look silver and put a layer of it under the mythril when the jewelry is crafted.  Without the orichalcum layer, the jewelry would resist the spells cast on it during the ceremony.”
“No, I can’t.”
“How big is the continent?”  Professor Dumbledore asked.
“Theoretically, yes,” Godric said.  “However, it can only be done in indoor areas and then the spells involved get increasingly more difficult and time consuming depending on the size of the area.  For my training room, it took me twenty-one hours of non-stop casting to charm it and then even with numerous doses of the magic restorative draft, I was still out of commission for three full days as I recovered from the exhaustion and the drain on my powers.”
“And the worst part of this,” Dumbledore said, “is that until he makes his presence known to the Wizarding public, we can’t do anything about it.  Ideally, we’d get the Ministry involved, because as weak and ineffectual as they tend to be, we need to do everything we can to mount a defense.  Of course, with all the spies that he’s got working for the Ministry, even if they were effective, it wouldn’t necessarily be to our advantage to involve them.  They wouldn’t believe us anyway, since the only proof we have that he’s a devil are the words of a nine-year-old boy who died over a thousand years ago and a marked Death Eater – no offense, Severus.”
“To keep an eye on my step-son,” Asheera answered, speaking for the first time.
“I’m not under a spell, Ronald, but I’ve seen a different side of Draco this year and I like what I see.  I also trust my very good friend Harry’s judgment.  If he believes that Draco deserves a chance, then I think that as Harry’s friends, it’s the least we can do.”
I’ve gotten off track here, haven’t I?  Of course, it’s probably because I simply am trying to avoid writing what is floating through my head, as if writing it will make it even more real.  I love Harry Potter, but I have always thought that there is no way that he could love me in return.  Now, I’m even more convinced of that fact.  Of course, his name is actually Aarik Potter, as I’ve recently found out, which gives me even more reason to believe that he could never return my feelings.  He’s the heir of Godric Gryffindor and as such, a member of one of the most powerful and famous wizading lines in existence, how could he ever love me?
“Rowena taught some of us how to simultaneous cast spells,” Justin said.  “Wouldn’t it lessen the strain if multiple wizards and witches, for example all of the professors, worked together to cast the spells?”
By this point, Oliver instinctively knew what the cause of Ryan and his love’s distress must be, and he wrapped Matt tightly in his arms in an attempt to comfort him.  Matthew continued to sob on Oliver’s shoulder, thoroughly soaking the fabric covering it, but Oliver didn’t care.  He was sure that he’d be reacting the same way if he’d gotten a letter saying that one of his parents had died, especially if it was his last remaining parent.
“Well, Ry, how could we refuse?”  Oliver asked.  “I mean eternal youth and more time together?  We’d be crazy to say no.”
"Yeah, mate, you can tell us anything," Ron said.
“I can handle that.  If the truth be told I never took particular pleasure from insulting them, well, maybe the Weas... well, Weasley.  It probably would be easier just to stop though, because, if I heard correctly, most of my material won’t really work anymore.”
“Why don’t people drink it all the time?” Zacharias Smith asked.
“Well, I’m sure he must be here somewhere then,” Godric said.  “He can’t have just vanished into thin air.”
“Yes, Nick,” answered Salazar.  “In my private potions lab, there is a book containing all of my most secret potions recipes.  Among them is a recipe for a potion that combined with the right spell would allow us to see Tom Riddle in his prison, without alerting Voldemort.  Due to the nature of the prison variant of the Time Suspension charm though, we would need a few drops of blood from someone in Voldemort’s service in order to see Tom.”
Watching Voldemort torture the ten Death Eaters, Asmodeus laughed cruelly and said, “I must admit, he can be very cruel when he wants to be, but that is nothing in comparison to me. Hmm, I think someone needs to be punished for allowing Voldemort to escape the Hells.”
“So, that wasn’t Tom Riddle who tried to kill me?”
When Draco ate the peach, a bright white light surrounded him, causing him to be blinded to things around him.  When he could see again, he took a moment to look around at his new surroundings.  The elaborate Temple of Persephone, Asheera and the priestesses were gone and he was now standing in a cold and desolate place, which seemed devoid of life.  Draco instantly knew that he had arrived in Tartarus, the Land of the Dead.
“She can’t, Nick.  She said that the magic that hid her quarters prevented her from being able to leave them and visit other portraits.  The only way that she could have gone to visit one of the other founder’s portraits is if their heir has found their quarters and thus lifted the protective magic.”
*	*	*
“Wait a minute,” Draco said, as a look of comprehension spread across his face, “I get the feeling that Harry is playing with us.”
“Right you are, Harry,” Rowena confirmed.  “I charmed this library so that it would magically obtain copies of every single written work ever produced.  This library contains books on every subject under the sun.
“So you’re spending Christmas at Hogwarts, Ry?”  Kevin asked.
“Your mind is in the gutter thinking about Stephen again, isn’t it?”
*	*	*
“I know that feeling all to well,” Rowena said as she squeezed Brendan and kissed him on the cheek.  “Brendan is the best thing that ever happened to me.  I always figured I’d die an old maid, but then I found Brendan and he changed all of that.  We fell madly in love, got married, had four children and had a hundred and forty-two fabulous years together.”
“How’s the other group, Professor?”  Ryan asked.
He was also desperate for Pansy’s constant attempts to get into pants to stop though, so, however un-Slytherin it may have been, Draco was willing to be brave, take the risk and drink the Veritaserum.
“Well, I was sorted into Slytherin because of my ambition and my desire to make a name for myself; a name that people truly respect, rather than fearing.  You basically got everything I want for myself at the age of one, due to circumstances very much out of your control.”
*	*	*
*	*	*
Bill, Harry, Ron, and Hermione just nodded before accompanying Ryan and Nicolas into Flourish and Blotts.
“Well, within reason,” clarified Rowena.  “For example the castle will not inform him about every conversation that takes place within its walls.  He also doesn’t know what every single person is doing at every single second of the day, but the castle will give him a general idea of what’s been happening.  So, you may notice that he asks questions and while he may present the façade of already knowing the answers, in truth, he probably doesn’t, because the castle has only told him so much and he still needs to fill in the blanks.”
I can't wait for Hogwarts to start. The couple of times that Dumbledore has been around he'd hinted that we should expect a few surprises this year. I just hope they're the good kind of surprises. Of course, going off to Hogwarts also means getting out of this dreadful old house and away from the shrieking of Mrs. Black, who we still haven't been able to silence. Her portrait is still stuck on the wall downstairs and, try as everyone might, we can't find the necessary charm to remove it. I guess they don't call it a permanent sticking charm for nothing.
Newly-appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, the former Head of the Auror Office at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has confirmed that the last two spells cast with Mr. Malfoy's wand were indeed the Cruciatus and Killing curses. As a result, Mr. Malfoy has earned himself a one-way ticket back to Azkaban Prison. Due to the mass revolt of the Dementors, the Ministry has recently acquired two Welsh Greens, a Hungarian Horntail, and a Norwegian Ridgeback to act as guards at the prison.
Snape nodded.  “Well, while I obviously have selfish reasons for wanting that, we’d have to do it anyway,” he reasoned, “as if what Lady Asheera said was true, he can’t be sent back to the Hells while he’s bound to so many living mortals.”
“Yes, that would be me,” Zacharias spoke up.  “I found out a few days ago and I’m still in shock to be honest.”
“If you need any...”  Fred started.
“Mischief managed,” Harry whispered and tucked the map into his cloak pocket before removing his cloak and saying, “Hello Draco, Susan.”
"Many of you have probably noticed the empty seats at the staff table this evening. There are in fact several staffing related announcements which I have to share with you. First off, Professor Trelawny, our Divination teacher, has decided to take early retirement due to an ailing family member in London who she must care for. Due to this change in our staffing, I have decided to remove Divination from the class offerings at this school, which is something that I have wanted to do for quite awhile. Due to this fact, I have decided to cancel all classes tomorrow, so as to give the students currently enrolled in Divination time to look over the other offerings and pick a new class. There are also some new offerings this year for our sixth and seventh year students, so tomorrow they will be allowed to make any changes to their schedules that they wish.
“I know I’m just messing with you, Matt.”
"Yes, mother," Draco said as he opened the door and smiled at her.
“I don’t know, but I’ve noticed a slight twinkle in your eyes the last couple of times you insulted me, almost as if you were having fun doing it, but didn’t really mean what you were saying.”
*	*	*
“Exactly, Harry. We can’t be together like that anymore. It’s against school rules for the professors to date the students.”
“Did Terry tell your little group about my book and then you all decided that it was a good idea to steal it so that you could sneak around the castle and get information about Harry without him knowing?”
“Yes, that does complicate matters,” Scrimgeour said.  “Barnabus, this is strictly off the record, but I have talked with the British Prime Minister, as has every Minister of Magic since Grindenwald’s death.  However, we have never made contact with the rest of the government and I am certain that the Prime Minister has never told anyone else about our conversations, because we’ve never given him any form of tangible proof that he’d be able to pass on to other members of his government.  Without it, I’m sure they’d think him crazy to think that witches and wizards exist or that they have a government that operates entirely independently of Muggle Britain’s authority.”
“Thank you, Mr. Pucey.”
At this point, Asheera took over.  “The Kingdom of Atlantis was not always underwater.  At one time our continent was just like all the others above water, with one distinct difference: the entire continent of Atlantis was much like your village of Hogsmeade with witches and wizards as the only residents.  However, as time passed, it became increasingly harder to protect Atlantis from Muggles as they began to develop ways of sailing across the oceans and landing on our shores, trying to claim this new world as they saw it for themselves.  The other magical communities of the world were very small and it was easy to hide them from Muggle view, but it would have taken an enormous amount of magic to hide an entire continent and keep it hidden forever.
“Voldemort is a lesser devil?”  Angelique asked.  “Oh heavens, then that means that he’s trying to turn Earth into a Hell and usurp Asmodeus.”
“What look?”
Harry nodded and watched as Hermione left.  Once she was gone, Harry quietly snuck upstairs to his dorm, went over to his trunk, grabbed his cloak and map, and left Gryffindor Tower.
“Why did it take so long for you to come back?”  Ryan asked.  “I mean, you returned to Atlantis to avoid dying and all that, I get that.  But why did it take sixteen years for you to come back?”
“My grandmother was born in 1925,” Nick commented.  “Of course, her birthday is July 18th and she’s an only child.  I guess that means that I’m not Slytherin’s heir.”
“He’s sixteen, almost seventeen,” Zach said.  “Though, like you, Rick, he technically should be older based on when he was born.  You should be nineteen, but since you did not age in Tartarus, you are only seventeen.  Tom was under the influence of a Dark Arts spell during his imprisonment that left him frozen in time.  Based on when he was born, he should technically be turning seventy on his birthday on New Year’s Eve.”
Draco nodded and continued to take in the surroundings in awe.  As the carriage turned a corner, Draco noticed that there was a pair of large gates up ahead that blocked further access into an adjacent district.  Curious, Draco asked, “Where are we going?”
Lane Waters looked at Adrian with a pleading look, “I know, but can I at least try?  Harry Potter joined the Gryffindor team when he was a first year.”
Draco nodded as he stood up and began dressing.  Charles noticed Draco's trunk sitting off to one side of the room.  "Pack," he muttered with a wave of his wand, and Draco's schoolbooks, clothes, and other belongings began to pack themselves.  It wasn't long before another person entered the room with their wand drawn.
“What kind of idiot wrote such a stupid rule?”  Scrimgeour asked, deciding to drop the Playwitch issue as he could see he wasn’t getting anywhere with Dumbledore.
Dreams Really Do Come True, Part One
“Okay, your choice,” said Bill.
Back in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Ryan, Zacharias, Nicolas, Bill, Hermione, Justin, Harry, Draco, Susan, Matthew, Oliver, Corelian, Asheera, and Valen stood around the stand now holding the Atlantean copy of the ‘Tome of the Founders’, with Rowena and Helga looking down from the frame above the fireplace.
“Well, we’re supposed to be chaperoning here, Bill,” Valen said.  “So, we should probably mingle.”
The guard nodded to Valshar and again hurried out of the throne room.  He returned a moment later and Valshar said, "The Dullahan will drive the coach back to the Land of the Living, simply tell him where you wish to go.  I ask that you not discuss what has just happened until you are safely home.  As for you, mortal, until we meet again then; I assure you, we will meet again."
The door opened and a man wearing ocean blue robes walked out and as he looked at this new teacher, Harry unknowingly thought the same thing that several other students in the hall were thinking, 'Damn, he's hot.' Professor Lasinius stood about six feet two inches tall with a lean muscular build. Harry couldn't tell what color his eyes were from this distance, but he noted that he had shoulder-length black hair tied back in a tail. Looking at him, Harry thought that he was probably around Bill's age. Professor Lasinius smiled and waved at the students before walking up to the head table and sitting down next to Bill.
“I knew there was a reason I loved you,” Ryan said as he kissed Justin on the cheek. “Come on you two.”
“He was there when I found out,” Harry answered.  “He’s Hufflepuff’s heir.  It turns out that Cedric was, too.  He was Zacharias’ cousin.”
“Yes, here you are,” Madame Pomfrey agreed.  “Well, I can let you all in to see him, but I don’t want you starting anything, Mr. Potter.”
Amos and Hannah immediately loosened their grip, as obviously neither one of them relished the thought of asphyxiating their recently returned from the dead son and having to bury him all over again.
“I don’t believe you,” Pansy said.  “You want me Draco, I know you do.  If you had sex with Blaise, then it must be because he forced himself on you.”
-o-0-o-
"Oh I remember those fights," Matthew said as he thought back. "She was furious with you for weeks. Figured that after two years of education at Hogwarts I'd learned enough to control my powers and should then go and have a proper British education."
*	*	*
“You must be Albus Dumbledore,” Corelian said.
“Are you we really dating, Malfoy?”  Neville asked.
"Members?" Matthew asked. "Malfoy is family? How?"
*	*	*
"Okay, then, see you in awhile, Ry," Oliver said with a smile as he walked off with Matt, the two of them holding hands.
“Ah, okay, Dobby, we’ll be there shortly,” Ryan commented.
Chapter Nine
"No problem, Harry," Bill replied with a grin, and proceeded to cast several highly complex locking and silencing charms on the room.  "All finished."
“Well, you two went to the Ball together,” answered Harry.  “And you were stuck to each other like glue every time I saw the two of you during the course of the night.”
“You know, that doesn’t make any sense,” Ryan said.  “I mean, the Sorting Hat didn’t say who the heirs were, just that they were students at this school.  Which means, obviously, someone is going to know them.”
*	*	*
“Professor Dumbledore asked if I would brew the potion,” Severus said, “as I am a certified Potions Master, but I cannot brew a potion from a recipe I cannot read.”
As had become their routine over the last month since Nick’s birthday, professor and student could once again be found stretching near the lake in preparation for their morning run. Before now, the conversation between the two had been focused on the Weasley family and Bill’s various adventures in Egypt. Running low on things to talk about, however, Bill decided that it was time Nick start talking about his family for once. But, first, he had another question about an observation he’d made recently.
“My marriage,” Angelique said.  “Come now, Nicolas, surely you remember that my surname did not change when I married your grandfather.  I was a Byrne before and after my marriage, since my husband was Maxwell Byrne, my first cousin.  You know that our family is not obsessed with pure blood and we certainly have never encouraged first cousins to marry in order to preserve it.  The family didn’t object in Maxwell’s and my case though because we weren’t related by blood.”
Two hours later, Corelian, Asheera, Valen, Ryan, Justin, and Dumbledore exited his office and went back to the Great Hall for the Ball.  Dumbledore had lied to the other professors when he said that he had charmed the entrance of the Great Hall to transport all who crossed the threshold to the Room of Requirement.
Following the incident with Colin getting permission to enter Gryffindor’s quarters without Harry knowing about it, all four heirs returned to their ancestor’s quarters and rescinded all permissions that they granted since the nights each of them found the rooms.
“And you took Rowena’s last name?”  Bill asked.
"An owl just arrived for you, dear," Narcissa said. "Judging by the seal on the back, I'm pretty sure it's your OWL results."
“Asheera, dear, could you go and be Ryan and Justin’s guide?”  Corelian asked.  “I’d rather not relive that painful memory at the moment.”
“I’m afraid I have no choice,” Snape answered.  “Voldemort knows that Tom Riddle escaped.  I don’t know how he found out, but he knows and he wasn’t happy.  He called every single Death Eater in his service to headquarters tonight.”
“Ah, I see and do you intend to tell Mr. Cromwell this information?”
“How do you know this?”
“They aren’t sure,” Asheera said, “but many of the Atlantean scholars think that it is actually now in the possession of one of the European Ministries of Magic, they don’t know which one though.”
* * *
“Why?”  Zach asked.
*     *     *
Of course they are not alone in this Hall.
“This most curious potion is called Felix Felicis, which is to put it simply, liquid luck.  It is desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong.  However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that you will tend to succeed at whatever you do... at least until its effects wear off.”
*	*	*
Looking at his watch, Ryan said, “Well, first period is going to start in about five minutes, so I guess we should say goodbye, Draco.”
Dobby popped in and bowing before Rowena’s portrait asked, “Yes, Mistress Ravenclaw?”
*	*	*
“I’ve been to Tartarus and back, Professor.  Beyond that, well, your questions will be answered in time,” Draco said, before looking at all of the professors and adding, “Now, however, I suggest that you all prepare yourselves for the biggest shock of your lives.”
Pulling the chain to return the portrait to normal, Ryan pushed the button to open the panel into Matt's room and stepped in, quickly closing the panel behind him. Crossing the room, the sound of the shower running was obvious as well as the fact that the house-elves had not been up yet to clean the room, as the bed was turned down on both sides, the sheets were very rumpled, and a breakfast tray with two of everything except food on it laid abandoned at the foot of the bed.
“Extremely,” Nick said.  “I can’t thank you enough because Bill is the best thing that ever happened to me.”
“Ah, it is good to see you, my friend,” the young man on the throne said.
“Terry Boot,” Colin said.
“If you go,” Asheera said, “I will see to it that you are outfitted with a full suit of mythril plate armor.  Mythril is an indestructible, feather-light metal that is extremely abundant in Atlantis.  It is also resistant to magic.  Even the Killing Curse can’t get past a layer of mythril.  Not knowing what kind of challenge you might be given, I would also insure that you be given certain artifacts which will certainly help you.”
Seconds later, a woman’s voice said, “Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.  Please state your name and business.”
The Priestess Anarra stood and looked at Draco for a moment, before turning to address Asheera, “Forgive me, My Lady High Priestess, but isn’t he a human?”
“No, Hermione.”
“Colin’s turn-ons include black hair and green eyes.”
P.S. Thanks for the dinner invitation, I'd be glad to come over. I'll see you tonight.
As the hug ended, Ryan looked at Corelian and said, “I forgive you for not being there for me.  I saw in the memory that you really wanted to be and that the only reason you weren’t was because Tyriand forced you to stay.”
Both men moaned, muffled by their kiss, as their raging cocks met.  Moving one of his hands from its place around Nick’s waist, Bill reached up and began to run his fingers through Nick’s short, black and blond hair.
“I’m sorry you had to go through that,” Zach said as he hugged Tom.  “You truly have experienced too much pain in your life and I intend to do everything I can to minimize any future pain life decides to throw at you.”
Voldemort held the spell for a few seconds, as the boy, whose throat was now less dry from having recently ingested liquid, managed to scream in agony, softly, but still what could only be described as screaming.  Voldemort then called the house-elf back in and told it to tend to the boy’s injuries so that ‘his guest’ wouldn’t bleed to death and then swept out of the room, laughing cruelly.
“Yes, my Lord,” Rabastan Lestrange said as he levitated the dead owl out of the room.
“I’m staying out of it,” Anthony answered, as he sat down on his bed and began tying his shoes.
Lord Voldemort sat upon the ebony throne that he had set up in the drawing room of the Riddle house in Little Hangleton. Several of his Death Eaters were also in the large room, which was used as the main meeting room. Voldemort stared idly at nothing in particular as he petted Nagini’s head and plotted his next atrocity. After a moment, a large barn owl swooped into the room and landed on one of the arms of Voldemort’s throne. Taking the small scroll from the bird’s leg, Voldemort grinned as it flapped its wings and took off, not realizing it would never see the outside ever again.
“So, is he really a different person these days?”
“You love me?”  Tom asked, his tone indicating that he did not believe it.  “Yeah, right, I guess that’s why you sought comfort in someone else’s arms the second my back was turned.  It was like seeing Blake and Douglas in bed together all over again.”
"They won't have to come anywhere near the house," Harry said. "You'll notice that it mentions a portkey at the bottom of the letter."
As for the Halloween Ball, the episode with Pansy this afternoon really did get me to think about it.  Since Dumbledore announced it I’ve been trying to put it out of my mind.  Obviously, I’m not about to even think about asking the person I really want to go with.  I have no clue if he’s gay or not, and we don’t have the best history.  True, we have been getting along better as of late.  One could even call us friends, but now that we’re finally friendly with one another, I’m not about to do anything that might jeopardize our newfound friendship.
Aarik nodded and then said, “As for me, much like Draco, I don't think I ever really hated him; disliked him, yes, because quite honestly he was an insufferable prick for many years.  However, since he witnessed your death, Mrs. Malfoy, I've been able to see a side of him that I doubt he's ever shown many people.  It was probably mostly due to fear of what Lucius would do to him if he did.  Draco has never even considered supporting Voldemort, but he never told his father that directly because he was afraid of what he would do.  Rightfully so, I would say, considering the kind of man that Lucius is."
“It’s a very interesting place,” Bill said.  “Of course, it’s also hot and getting sand in your shoes can be annoying, but all in all, I did enjoy it.  Many people don’t know this, but they still have a Pharaoh you know.”
“Guess not,” Stephen said with a smile as he packed the last of his belongings and closed his trunk.
"Are we perhaps talking about Fleur Delacour?" Nicolas asked. "Has a little sister named Gabrielle?"
The five students stood in silence for several minutes, just looking around at the room, before finally a female voice said, “Hello all.  I’m pleased to see that someone has finally found my quarters.”
“Of course, Nick,” Rowena said as she disappeared from Salazar’s frame.
“No, I have next period free,” Ryan answered.  “So, I’m heading up to the library to do some research with a friend.”
"That's a stupid question."
“So, why did you leave?”  Ryan asked.  “Why did you leave me with my grandparents?  They were great and all, but I’ve always wondered what was wrong with me that you didn’t want me.”
“Harry,” Hermione said.  “We’re just going as friends.  I’ve been giving him dancing lessons.”
Dreams Really Do Come True, Part Two
Cedric smiled and said, "Correct."
“Well, you wanted revenge on Godric,” Harry said, “and it seems that he also wanted revenge on you.  He just went about his differently.”
Following Aarik into Godric’s quarters, Ron and Hermione gasped when they saw two people sitting on the sofa in front of the fireplace.  They instantly recognized them from the pictures in the photo album that Hagrid had given Aarik – James and Lily Potter – Aarik’s dead parents.  They also could not help but notice Draco sitting in a nearby armchair next to another person who they recognized from the picture that had accompanied her obituary in the
“Christmas shopping?”  Aarik asked.
“Yes, boy, you have been my prisoner for 54 years,” Voldemort confirmed.  “Ever since you were a student at Hogwarts and you tried to thwart my plans to rule the world.  I was certainly not going to allow a pathetic sixteen-year-old whelp to thwart me, so I imprisoned you and assumed your identity.  It really was quite a coincidence that your name just so happened to spell my name, if you rearranged the letters.”
"Unless what?" Ron asked.
“Kyrian,” Ryan repeated, trying to get used to the sound of it.  “Well, I guess if you want to call me that, you can, though I’m much more used to Ryan.”
"I said 'problem solved,'" Harry said as he held up the letter he just got. "My friend Ron's mum and dad have invited me to spend the rest of the summer with them."
“There is something else I need to tell you,” Ryan said after ending the hug with Matt.
Godric looked ready to say something, but his retort fell silent on his lips as he thought about it for a moment and then said, “Oh my Gods, you’re right.  I did encourage him.  In fact, the night before he made the announcement I suggested he do it while we were... well, doing things.”
Not thinking of the consequences, Draco cried out, "Daddy, please don't hurt the puppy!"  He picked up the puppy that Lucius kicked, and cradled it lovingly in his arms.
Harry was about to tell his relatives to have fun, even though he was secretly wishing that they'd all become shark food when their plane crashed into the sea, when his pet snowy owl, Hedwig, came flying in through the open dining room window and landed on his shoulder. As Harry took the letter from Hedwig's leg, his uncle, acting as if he had not even seen the owl fly into the room, said, "Of course, now the only question is what to do with you? I don't want you and your unnaturalness alone in my house."
“Yeah, I know that now,” said Harry.  “I didn’t know that though until a few weeks ago.  Somehow, the subject of marriage and children never came up when Bill was helping me come to terms with being gay.  He never told me that the Wizarding World’s opinion on such things is different from that of the Muggle World’s.  I think he thought I was sickened at the thought of being gay because of one of my crushes.”
“Details, details,” Matt muttered with a grin.  “So are you going to give me permission?”
“Hmm, wish I had known that spell over the summer,” Bill commented.  “I wouldn’t have needed to brew nearly as much Pain-Relieving potion.”
“Don’t stand there and act like you don’t know,” Tom said in a low voice.
Ryan turned a few more pages and came across the pages with the names written in black ink, signifying the heirs of Helga Hufflepuff.  Skimming down the list, Ryan said, “I can make out several first and middle names, but I can’t make out many of the surnames or the dates.  Let’s see here, Barnabas Ephraim, Hepzibah Esther, Ephraim Zebulon, Zebulon Jeremiah, Jeremiah Isaiah, Isaiah, I can’t make out his middle name, Hannah Elspeth,” Ryan paused for a moment and then said, “Hmm, this next entry I can read part of the surname; it says Cedric Jeremiah Dig.”
Starting shortly after Harry's fourth year, Bill and Harry began to exchange lots of owls, and the two became good friends.  During fifth year, when Umbridge began monitoring all of the incoming mail, Harry and Bill hardly heard from each other since, by that time, the letters had begun to get quite personal, and neither wanted Umbridge to read about their personal thoughts and feelings.
Stephen asked, “What?”
“I love you, Bella,” Lucius said as they coupled.  “I should have married you instead of Narcissa.
"The sign-up sheets for the four new extra-curricular activities will be posted on the bulletin boards in your house common rooms in the morning. Your Heads of House shall instruct all sixth and seventh-year students and those currently enrolled in Divination what to do about amending your schedules. Prefects, if you would please lead your houses back to their dormitories; I wish all of you a good night."
The boy didn’t bother to raise his head or even reply, which only made his captor angry.
NICOLAS PHILLIPE DELANEY, born 10-09-1979, age 17
“I do not claim anything,” Corelian answered.  “I am merely stating a fact.  As for how old I am, I’m 296.”
The rest of the room gasped at their Professor’s transformation, having never guessed for a second that he had been using glamour charms.
Looking at the boy, Adrian surmised that despite his youth, he might actually make a good Keeper.  He was rather tall for his age and he had long arms, which would be good for keeping the Quaffle away from the hoops.
“As interesting as this conversation is,” Hermione interjected, “perhaps we should go and get Zacharias now and Nick should head down to the dungeons before he’s late for his date.”
After finishing up at Gladrags Wizardwear, Harry’s group went over to the Three Broomsticks for lunch.  Just as the group sat down at a large table, however, all Hell broke loose.  Explosions and screaming from the street outside could only mean one thing.
“So, how are you going to perform magic then?”  Ryan asked, after his father filled him in on the recent development.
It was now twenty minutes to one and the school carriages had lined up in the driveway outside of the school, ready to take the students who were leaving down to the train station in Hogsmeade for the trip back to London.
“I think he’s quite handsome actually,” Harry said with a grin.
“So soon?”

MEROPE MORFINA GAUNT, born 20-01-1906, died 31-12-1926, age 20
Harry just looked at the blond for a moment, before he leaned forward and placed a chaste kiss on Draco’s lips.  Pulling away, he said, “I like you, too.”
“I resent that remark,” Justin said indignantly.
Alaric sighed and floated up through the ceiling of the room and disappeared.
"Well, Ron," Nicolas said, "Gabrielle and I are still friends, despite not working out as a couple. We still owl each other and about two months ago she said that Fleur had found her mate and was getting engaged. Said it was one of our old classmates named Phillipe Fortier. He was a couple of years ahead of Fleur in school, so she didn't come into her powers until after he graduated, so she didn't realize that he was her mate right away. Come to think of it, Gabrielle did mention a William from Britain in her letters that Fleur had thought was her mate, but after all of the tests were done, it was determined that he wasn't."
Dumbledore smiled.  "As it does to us all, John," Dumbledore said and after a moment, added, "me much more so than you, of course," referring to the fact that he was almost thirty years older than Ollivander.
Stopping at Gringott's first, the goblins didn't give Matthew any trouble about accessing Draco's vault. Matthew, Ryan, and Oliver were all rather taken aback by the huge amount of galleons in Draco's private vault. The Cromwell and Wood families were by no means poor, but the sheer quantity of galleons in Draco's vault alone was certainly impressive. Matthew was pretty sure that even if he combined what was in his vault with Ryan's vault and Oliver's vault, Draco would still have more. Looking at the shopping list that Draco had supplied, Matthew did take a lot more galleons then one would normally think would be necessary for back to school shopping, but he could see from what Draco all had on his list that the larger amount would definitely be needed.
“Salazar, from what I’ve just heard, you don’t really have the right to throw stones,” Rowena said as she slipped into the frame.  “I must admit that Helga and I both were quite angry with Godric for maligning your memory, but now to find out that you bred a basilisk to kill Godric’s heirs, I’m equally as angry with you.”
“How do you know?”  Ryan asked.  “The ‘Tome of the Founders’ hasn’t been fully restored yet and the names of the other heirs are still unreadable.”
"That's almost Slytherin of you, Albus," Remus said with an amused grin on his face.
“So, once a person has eaten this fruit, what happens?”
“No, nothing is wrong.”
Cedric nodded his head in agreement, as Lily performed a quick Cleaning Charm on his face, to which he smiled and said, "Thank you."
To be continued...
*	*	*
“Malfoy Code of Conduct, rule number 238 states that a Malfoy always means what they say,” Draco recited with a grin on his face.
“What do you mean, Nicolas?”
“Ryan, it’s not that simple,” answered Corelian.  “What sets Atlanteans apart from humans, other then our pointed ears, is the fact that we are extremely long-lived.  We actually have some Elven blood, which is the cause of our pointed ears and our long life spans.  However, if I had stayed, I would have had my powers stripped, by having my magical core removed.  Without my magical core, I would have begun to age and while I could probably have held on a few years, I would most likely have been dead by the time you were five.”
“Would they even be able to get into your quarters?  You did say that they were charmed so that only you and your heirs could access them.”
An uncomfortable silence, broken only by the intermittent popping of another bubble blurting another of Colin’s secrets, filled the room.  Some people would normally laugh when someone else got a howler, but nobody was laughing this time.  Of course, the fact that the recipient of the howler could take points and give detentions may have had something to do with it.
“I won’t,” Nick said as he leaned down and kissed the tip of Bill’s nose. “Not like I would need it though; Potions has always been one of my best subjects.”
“No,” Corelian said.  “Only the special abilities that existed at the time of the ceremony are shared, but through a vow renewal ceremony, new abilities can be shared.”
"Oh, you will regret that!"  Lucius exclaimed as he raised his wand at Narcissa. "Avada Kedavra!"
"Yes, I am.  It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor McGonagall.  Allow me to present my grandson, Nicolas Delaney."
“No, he wasn’t,” Asheera said.  “According to the ancient texts, Hades was so angry with Amphitrite that he physically attacked her, greatly angering Poseidon.  Hades and Poseidon were soon throwing vast amounts of magic at one another.  To help you picture the power involved here, the spells that Poseidon and Hades were using against each other could easily have reduced Mt. Everest to a pile of dust.  Zeus certainly wasn’t going to just stand there and let them fight, so he called upon his own vast powers to put an end to it.  Once everyone was settled down again, Poseidon was so angry with Hades that he changed his vote, making the final vote five to two in favor of Persephone’s proposal.”
“Now you’re sounding like Hermione,” said Nick.
Zacharias nodded and smiled, as Rowena slipped into the frame beside Helga.
“Before we go in there’s something I want to do,” Harry said as he held out his hand to Draco.
“Nine and one-quarter inches, dragon heartstring core, in use nine years; is that correct?”
“Oh, I was referring to William Shakespeare,” Ryan answered.  “A 16th and 17th century Muggle playwright.”
“Okay, Zach, you were right,” Cedric said, as the expression on Zach’s face got even smugger.  “I’m bisexual, are you happy now that I admitted it?”
Colin had the grace to look abashed for a moment before nodding his head and saying, “Yes.”
"You going to faint again?" Malfoy crowed, delighted by how easy this was. By now, a small gathering of curious students had appeared, standing in a loose knot around them. Their fights had clearly become a regular source of entertainment. "Should I run and get your little mudblood friend to help you?"
“I suppose you’d be thinking of a Muggle tattoo.”
“Yes, well, enough about what you want,” Draco said, almost faintly. He swallowed, thick and loud in the space between them. “Alright.”
“I assume you don’t just mean the mind-blowing as always orgasm.”
“I ate all the pastries, you know.” It was accusatory and also vaguely triumphant.
He reached out to run his fingertips over the Dark Mark, tracing across the new ring of flame. “Show me?”
Obligingly, Draco tapped it again, and the phoenix bloomed over his skin like watercolours on parchment. If Harry looked, he could see where the curve of the bird’s tail echoed the head of the snake, the wings hiding the biggest loops of its body. “I see you went with my design,” he said lightly, teasing. “After telling me how terrible my art was.”
Harry settled between Draco’s thighs, stroking over them with gentle hands and feeling Draco shudder underneath him, his breath held in trembling anticipation. It took all of Harry’s willpower to sink his cock in slowly, every instinct urging him to just slam into him, claim Draco’s body as his own, but finally he was buried inside Draco, hot and tight and utterly perfect. Draco’s chest heaved with scatter-shot breaths, fingers twisted into the sheets at his sides with desperate, white-knuckled fierceness.
“Really?”
Malfoy licked his bloody fingers slowly, thoughtfully -
“I want to do it again.” Harry could barely believe he had said it aloud; the words hung between them in the air, gossamer-thin and hopeful. “Whatever it is. And more. I want -”
“Then what.”
, writhing and panting, and Harry raised his eyes just long enough to see the hot flush over his cheeks, the inky-black of his eyes staring at him in delirious confusion and arousal. “Good?” he asked, lips still against the Mark, and Draco nodded feverishly, throat working as he tried to remember how to speak.
Heart hammering, Harry stood. “Come with me to bed?”
“Well, I mean - I hadn’t -” Harry gritted his teeth, furious all over again at Malfoy’s lazy drawl and his mocking way of saying
“Shit, sorry, I -” Harry said helplessly.
Allowing Harry to do this, to take control, had been one of the hardest things to navigate in their relationship. Harry could
“Yes - Harry -” Draco said, delirious and black-eyed, magic on his tongue and singing through his veins. Harry curled his fingers around Draco’s cock, twisting his wrist with every upward stroke in the way he liked best, and Draco made a strangled half-scream at the sudden onslaught of sensation, head falling back against the pillows as his spine arched bow-taut, hands white-knuckled claws tangled in the bedsheets.
“Draco?”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco whispered. “It’s McGonagall.”
he admonished himself.
“It’s a little hard to concentrate with you staring at me.”
“Ugh. What do you suggest, then?”
Guessing that Harry was going to just stand there and stare, Draco grabbed at Harry's shirt, dragging him in for another kiss. It was more cautious than the first, slow and tentative as they worked it out; how they slotted together, how Draco liked it when Harry scratched blunt nails over the nape of his neck, how it made Harry shudder when Draco licked over Harry's bottom lip. Draco's mouth was coppery-sweet, that taint of blood masking everything else, and Harry didn't care, content to kiss like this forever if it kept making him feel as though he was flying.
“Wait. Potter.”
Draco hummed, non-committal. “Goodnight.”
“For -” Draco gestured vaguely to himself. “I don’t know. For trying? For meaning it? I just thought - assumed - that you really
"Fine. But get on with it.”
“I’m not
"From you? Hardly likely, is it." Malfoy lifted his eyebrows at him, making a show of looking him up and down. "Did you forget to brush your hair
“No, just
Draco, loved him more than anything in the world, and if Draco was happy then he should be too. He
“Apparently not. I overestimated you.”
“Alright.”
moving while I’m -”
All Harry saw at first was a phoenix; gold and red and orange, taking flight with wings partially outspread and its tail curling down towards Draco’s wrist. Sparks of flame spat from it, ringing the outline of the bird, its head raised and one visible eye bright with amber and black.
“Is that all you’ve got, Potter?” he mocked, that drawling sneer biting through the ringing fog in Harry’s head and turning it to bright-burning anger again. Harry growled, spitting blood in Malfoy’s direction, and lunged for him.
But today the table was almost empty, the dishes stacked neatly by the sink and only Harry’s “You’re A Catch” mug left beside his usual chair, his coffee charmed to be still hot and ready for him. Harry smiled as he lifted it - at least Draco hadn’t been angry at him for anything when he’d left. He was absolutely petty enough to leave his coffee freezing cold and in the “Potter Stinks” mug he’d had made if Harry had done something to particularly irritate him, one of many passive aggressive little
Their eyes met, blown dark with arousal, and then they were kissing again, angry and fierce and perfect, rutting mindlessly into each other's hands.
"They're leaving," Draco breathed finally, risking a half-lidded glance towards the crowd. "I think we bored them."  Harry took a few seconds to comprehend him, too busy concentrating on not coming in his trousers because Draco was
“Hey.”
“Draco,” Harry tried again, softly as though speaking to a timid animal. “What’s wrong?”
rubbing himself against Harry's cock surreptitiously, sweet-burn friction maddening and not nearly enough.
I don’t - I don’t hate it. I don’t hate any part of you. Maybe I did, at first - but that wasn’t your fault, not ever. That was something I had to work out for myself.” He kissed the Dark Mark again, tenderly. “It’s a part of you.”
"Yeah," Harry agreed vehemently, unable to think of anything even slightly better to describe this heady, overwhelming flood of sensation.
“Make it look like we’re still fighting. Class starts soon so our bloodthirsty little audience will have to leave in a few minutes."
“I do -”
“I thought you’d at least get the gist of what I was aiming for,” Harry sighed, too tired and satisfied to be irritated.
friends?”
"Go on then," Malfoy said, eyebrows raised incredulously. "Let's see it."
"Thought the Dementors had finally got you," Malfoy sneered. "Pity."
Slowly, hands shaking with the weight of the nerves he was holding in, Harry reached for Draco, shiver-soft fingers pushing the plush green fabric down, away from the pale, lean body hidden within it. Draco watched him with his breath half-held, stuttering out as Harry’s calloused fingertips skated over his ribs, his stomach, his shoulders, inch after inch of skin revealed, each new exploration of his hands followed with a gentle kiss.
what he wanted.
The Dark Mark. Harry eyed it, remembering when it had stoked nothing in him but revulsion - when even the glimpse of it on Draco’s arm had been enough to make him have to suppress a shudder. At the beginning, when they had both been finding their feet after the War, it had been something Harry hadn’t been sure he would ever get used to. He had tried his best to keep Draco from knowing - had done everything he could to not flinch from it, not to stare  - but he knew Draco felt it regardless. How could he not notice, when Harry closed his eyes rather than look?
“Actually, I wasn’t, entirely. There was another part to my idea. And this one you might not like.”
"That wasn't fighting, Malfoy. I've barely started."
“Do you really not hate it?”
"Typical bloody Gryffindor. No style."
Draco’s breath stilled for a moment, and Harry thought he could almost hear his heartbeat, rabbit - fast and wild against the cage of his ribs.
terrifying. Harry let it spread over Draco’s stomach, branching like Lichtenberg scars across his chest and up to his shoulder before swirling down to the Dark Mark and settling there, where it glowed bright and golden against the shadow-black of the serpent’s coils, looping around in an endless figure eight that pulsed in rhythm with Harry’s thrusts. For a moment, Draco thought that was all it was doing; illuminating the darkness in some sincere but ultimately useless kind of symbolism. That would be just like Potter. But then the glow became warm against his skin, the hum of magic thrumming bright and pure, and the skin marred by the Mark felt as though it was being peppered with thousands of tiny kisses. He looked up at Harry in wonder, saw the amber-gold light caught in his eyes, and let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding. A soft, gentle feeling radiated out from the magic, suffusing the Dark Mark, then his arm, then his whole body; it took Draco a moment to understand that it felt like love - no. Like
too quietly for the salesman to hear, that both of them could easily fit into that tub, and wouldn’t it be delightful to find out all of the filthy things that they could manage in it?
I can’t - Harry -”  the name was a warning, but Harry didn’t need to heed it, already too far gone himself.
“Yeah. Sure. Anything.”
“Okay, so, I thought - if you’re serious, if you really, truly hate the Dark Mark -”
"Either a Muggle tattoo - cover it up permanently with whatever you like, just get rid of the whole thing like it never existed - or a magical one. One you can make visible or not, at will. Where you have the choice to
“And this time?”
“No - no, wait. What are they - is that one a peacock?”
“Yes.”
It all started with a fistfight.
"I'm gonna -" Harry said helplessly, barely a minute later. His face burned, utterly certain Malfoy was going to mock him but unable to hold on any longer.
“I’m just asking -”
"Why not? She
“A-Alright.”
“It’s lunch time.”
Usually, Harry just clenched his fists and gritted his teeth, blunt nails digging into palms, bright points of blessedly grounding pain. Usually, he found the words - thick-tongued, clumsy, molasses through a sieve - to stop it escalating, to keep Malfoy at arm's length.
“Well, some of us haven’t had breakfast yet.”
“Can I see?”
. That’s how all this had started. “Fine. If that’s all it was. Whatever, Malfoy.”
"Why, did you miss me? Been watching where I go a lot, have you?"
The loosely-knotted crowd of students watched in delighted horror as the two of them fought, messy and bloody and without any further words. One of the Muggle-born children started a tentative “Fight! Fight! Fight!” chant that was soon picked up heartily by the other Muggle-borns and finally the students in general.
Languidly, he slicked up his cock, heavy and aching against his palm, while Draco stretched himself, his face flushed under Harry’s dark-eyed scrutiny. Watching Draco do this was
Harry grinned, the queasy knot in his chest loosening. “Brilliant.”
“You never wear short sleeves.”
“I had noticed.”
"Virgin, Potter? How sweet."
“Well, don’t.” Draco stood abruptly, snapping the book shut and unfolding himself from the squashy green armchair with elegant irritation. “Alright? Just -” He made a vague gesture at Harry, at the room, at everything within glaring distance. “Just don’t.” Finally, his shoulders slumped, and he dropped the book onto the chair. “I’m going for a bath.”
“Correct again. Your powers of observation are quite remarkable. Your timekeeping, however, leaves a lot to be desired, as does your language. Please come out of that broom closet.”
“I promise you this isn’t personal,” Harry muttered.
It took Harry twenty minutes to decide that the risk of being shouted at was worth it. Cautiously, he made his way to the bathroom and peered around the door, squinting against the steam that immediately fogged up his glasses.
“You’re - making it worse.”
"This way," he ordered hoarsely. "Now." He felt himself trembling, poised somewhere squarely between flight or fight even as he led Malfoy through a series of corridors into a disused and empty broom closet, the door barely visible behind a net of cobwebs. He didn't dare look to see if Malfoy was following, too afraid that he wouldn't be.
“Potter, what
. Spread out underneath him, all marble-cut angles and lean muscle, he looked somehow simultaneously vulnerable and arrogant; a self-assured knowledge of his beauty tinted by the actual understanding that
“A- alright, but -”
“Do I dare ask what you were both doing inside that closet?” McGonagall asked archly.
“I don’t.”
Like he was some unknowable,beautiful creature, something worthy of blind devotion. It seeped through him, running like raindrops into all of the cracks of him, and he blinked back tears at the sweet, tender ache in his chest and the understanding, steady-soft gaze of Harry above him, still inside him, still dragging him almost to the edge and back with every deep, slow thrust.
“You’re so dramatic, Potter.” Draco pushed back against Harry again, smirking as Harry swore violently under his breath. His cock ached, trapped between them, and they fell into an uneasy, taut silence, neither of them daring to speak. Harry tried desperately to think of literally anything else - his homework, Filch’s face, the smell of stinksap.
It was only when the front door clicked shut and Draco came into the kitchen that Harry realised
“Go away,” Draco said without looking at him, teeth gritted and words mirror-crack sharp. “Why are you always barging in on me?”
They waited until she swept out of sight before shooting each other a look of abject, mortified horror.
dragging over the delicate skin, Draco’s pulse rabbit-fast under his wrist.
“Be quiet. Look. We have to move soon. People are looking at us.”
“Maybe she doesn’t know I’m in here, too,” Harry mouthed.
They lay in comfortable, if sticky, silence for a long while, Harry idly tracing over the Dark Mark with the tips of his fingers, feeling the last residual trace of his magic fading from Draco’s skin like warmth from the embers of a fire. Eventually, Draco mumbled a cleaning spell for them both, turning to face Harry in drowsy curiosity.
Harry sighed as he kicked off his jeans and boxers. “Luckily, I love you, you absolute git.” He knew that Draco did this; when he felt nervous, or uncomfortable, or uncertain, he only went one of two ways - either ice-freeze meanness, or melodramatic humour. He supposed this was preferable to having a screaming row - though he had to admit, sometimes those were very...
It took all of Harry’s self-control not to just rip that robe from his shoulders and take Draco like he wanted to, rough and fast until his smirk turned to gasping breaths and prayer-fervent pleas. That wasn’t what tonight was for.
“I can’t help it,” Draco whispered fiercely. “It’s just -” he rolled his hips back against Harry to show that it was the only movement he had from his position, and Harry moaned, low and rough and
, Harry feeling his chest almost glow with the thrill of it. They broke apart, gasping. Draco's bottom lip had started bleeding a little again. He licked it off thoughtfully, eyeing Harry in the gloom, and for a moment Harry was certain he was going to leave in disgust.
“What even is that?”
“Right. Yeah. I don’t think she’d believe you got a black eye and a split lip by accident, though. And uh, I suppose I should apologise for, you know. The bruises.”
. Did you get-”
“Potter -” Draco murmured as Harry’s fingers skirted towards the Dark Mark. “You don’t have to -”
s which Harry had come to quite enjoy.
Harry groaned internally. Of course.
“What the
“So you took it upon yourself to design me a tattoo despite having absolutely zero artistic ability?”
"Shut up, Malfoy," he said, irritated at the accurate assessment.
“That is a choice you made yourself,” Draco grumbled, already putting on his cloak. He had, Harry noticed, rolled up the other sleeve of his shirt. “The custard ones?”
“Right.” As much as Harry hated to say it, it made sense. He shifted his grip on Draco’s bird-boned wrist and added more tension. Draco made a show of grimacing and pretending to fight back, but his writhing only served to make Harry harder, his cock a constant dull throb of need.
Oh, but he was
, alright? I haven't-"
Harry took a deep breath, trying to organise his words into a shape that was soft enough at the edges to not hurt Draco's pride. He had never been much good at it; words tended just to spill from him thoughtlessly, but this was important enough to try.
Neither of them could have said, later, who moved first. It happened all at once; hands fumbling with trousers, unwilling to break the kiss for more than a few breathless seconds; Draco's low, needy whine as Harry finally wrapped shaking fingers around his cock and felt Draco's cool grip on his own, firm and sure despite their matching earthquake heartbeats.
“Oh,” Draco echoed, rolling his eyes. “Honestly Potter, your

“Oh, do shut up, Potter,” Draco groaned. “I didn’t have a better idea at the time.”
romance, Malfoy? I’m trying here.”
Usually, Draco was all but invisible in a bath - up to his chin in brightly coloured foam or candy-scented bubbles, the embodiment of relaxation. Not today. Today, he was all taut lines and tension, knees pulled up tight, head bowed. He was staring - no,
cupboard with his cheeks blazing and his dignity in tatters, for what? A quick handjob? Ugh.
He took a breath, nodded again, managed to make eye contact and hold it. “Honestly. It looks wonderful on you.”
"Shit," he said aloud after a pause, unable to articulate the revelation.
“I’m not about to
“I don’t think we have time to unpack
It was, Harry mused, sort of beautiful. Not for what it was, or what it had meant; but the stark cleanliness of it, coal-black lines wasting no detail, the promise of it fading with time still unfulfilled. It held no revulsion for Harry now, not when it was so intrinsically part of Draco, of everything they had gone through to get to this moment. He lowered his head and kissed it, tenderly. Draco jolted beneath him, breath faltering, and Harry took that as permission to continue, gripping Draco’s wrist to keep him still and pressing a trail of hot, chaste kisses over the tattoo before opening his mouth and allowing the tip of his tongue to follow the path of the snake’s coils. Draco
“And on me?”
"Where were you at breakfast? I didn't see you with your loser friends."
Harry reached for Draco’s arm, gripping his wrist gently and pressing a kiss to the looping black coils. “What about it?” he asked, nuzzling his face against Draco’s palm, sweet-smelling like parma violets and candyfloss.
in relief, reaching up to grab at Harry’s shoulders, digging blunt nails into his skin to drag him closer. His cock was trapped between them, sweat-slick and still  agonisingly hard, and Draco tilted his hips, desperately chasing enough friction. Harry was unrelenting; lips curled back in a silent snarl, he pounded into Draco as though his life depended on it - was not, in fact, certain that it
Draco scooted to the right enough for Harry to drop onto the mattress beside him, pulling his shirt over his head.
"What if I had? Would that make you angry? Oh
Malfoy spat at the ground, scowling. His eyes were dark with humiliated anger. Harry twisted, breaking his momentum and spinning back towards Malfoy gracelessly, already aiming another hard-knuckled fist towards his face.
“Rowena, would it be possible to transfer the prison charm from Tom to another without Voldemort knowing?”  Harry asked.
Vernon answered instead. "I got a raise at work and I'm taking the family on holiday to the south of France."
“You’ve been taking orders from something that someone wrote in a book?” Ginny asked, suddenly very angry.
“Specialis Revelio!” Hermione muttered as she tapped her wand on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened.
The other Gryffindors at the table cheered and the entire Great Hall was soon abuzz with a new energy.  The students were obviously looking forward to the match tonight.
“As I said, I’ve been to Tartarus and back,” Draco drawled.  “And I decided not to come back alone.”
"I am his godfather," Severus said.
"Don't 'good morning' me, you pathetic little wretch!"  Lucius screamed.  "You'll be starting back to school soon, and I'm warning you now, boy.  This year had better be different.  I had better not pick you up from school at the end of the year and find out, that once again, you've allowed that filthy mudblood to beat you academically!"
“Hades would then issue a challenge, which had to be completed.  If the challenger succeeded, Hades would restore the claimed souls to life and allow them all to leave.  If the challenger failed to successfully complete Hades’ challenge, then the claimed souls would remain dead and the challenger forfeits their own life.”
“I’m fine, Madame Pomfrey, really,” Draco said.  “Please don’t make them go.”
Looking up, Draco saw Asheera standing in the doorway.
“Okay, then,” McGonagall said as she waved her wand over a blank schedule and handed it to Harry, “You’re all done, so why don’t you go sign up for some extra-curricular activities?”
“Did you specify Ginny’s name?”  Ryan asked, as he realized where Hermione was going.
“So, Dumbledore knows everything that goes on in this castle?”  Ryan asked.
The two of them spent a month getting to know one another.  True, it had been Bill who did most of the talking and Nick now knew almost everything there was to know about Bill Weasley.  Over that first week of their relationship, Nick did his best to fill Bill in on everything about himself; when they weren’t in one of their frequent lip locks at any rate.
“He doesn’t,” answered Nick.  “It’s recently come to light that Tom Riddle is not Voldemort.  To make a long story short, Tom Riddle has been Voldemort’s prisoner under a Dark Arts version of the Time Suspension charm since the spring of 1942.  Voldemort is, in fact, a lesser devil whose goal here on Earth is to turn it into the Tenth Hell and usurp Asmodeus’ place as King of the Hells.”
“Does that mean that Atlantis will be unable to help Britain in the war with You-Know-Who?”  Madam Rosmerta asked.
“Watch your tongue, Severus!”  Asheera said in a stern voice that nobody in the room had ever heard her use before.  “I am almost eight times your age and I will not be spoken to in such a manner!  Despite what you may think, I am no fool.  I know you are mad that I allowed Draco to risk his life, but I don’t think that’s the sole root of your anger, and we both know it.  You may not want to admit it, but you’re just angry because James Potter is among the living again.  It means you are indebted to him, again, because as you well know, there’s a life debt between you and I’m sure you must know that while you have helped James’ son survive in the past, that doesn’t cancel or satisfy your life debt.”
“Yes, Professor,” Nicolas said as he looked at the Headmaster.  “Bill and I are together.  We’ve been dating for a few weeks now.”
“Blood Replenishing Potion,” Ernie answered confidently.
“I assume you are skilled in healing magic?”  Dumbledore asked.
*	*	*
“It’s the year 1996,” Harry revealed.
Meanwhile, in the staff wing of Hogwarts, Professor Angelique Byrne was sitting behind her desk grading the parchments on unicorns that she had her fifth-year Magical Creatures students write when there was a knock on her door.  Setting down her quill, she stood, walked over to the door, and answered it to find Professor Weasley standing there with her grandson.
After they had gotten out of the bathroom, where they both parted with everything they’d eaten for the day, they met in Lucius’ study.
“Well, Aarik,” Narcissa said, “I see no reason why you can’t use both.  You can honor Lily’s cousin by doing good things for others, whether you use his name or not.  It is not one’s name, but their actions, that truly matter.”
“What about Kayne?  Did he have an heir to pass ownership of the house too?”  Bill asked.
“He’s Malfoy!”
"Who?" Matthew asked, honestly curious, since his grandmother never gave many details about her time as a student.
Of course, Harry could understand why he would be crying, but it was still a bit of a shock to actually hear it. If Harry wasn’t a Gryffindor, he’d probably have just walked away, but as it was, he felt the need to go and try to comfort him, even though it was Malfoy and the help would likely be spurned. Tapping his wand against the Map, Harry mumbled, “Mischief Managed,” and then tucked it into his pocket.
“You too, Draco.”
“Thank you, Ryan,” Rowena said as she wrapped her arms around Brendan, who was beaming at Ryan for the compliment.  “He is quite handsome isn’t he?”
“Point noted,” drawled Draco, before muttering, “but at least she’ll be able to walk the next day.”
Moments later, the hooded guard returned with the souls of Narcissa Malfoy, James Potter, Lily Potter, and Cedric Diggory following.  Valshar looked at the four of them for a minute, before he said, “Your hero has won you a second chance at life.  You have been granted a stay from this inevitable reality – I almost envy you.”
“You’re so stupid, Pucey,” Urquhart piped up.  “Weakening the purity of Wizarding blood is akin to driving the Wizarding race into extinction.”
“Yes, that’s what I was thinking.”
After years of straining to hear the tiniest of noises that might suggest that Voldemort was coming to torture him again, Tom’s hearing was exceptionally good and he easily noticed the stress that Zach had given the word was.  Almost as if Zach was trying to say that Cedric had been dead, but he was not anymore, which was a completely ludicrous excuse and Tom voiced as much to Zach.
I do so love being a Slytherin, because we Slytherins do tend to find things out before other houses, and oftentimes the information can be very juicy.  For example, I’ve recently found out that shortly after his seventeenth birthday fifteen days ago, Delaney started to secretly seduce Professor Weasley.  Yet, they are not a couple as far as I know, but as usual, the betting pools have already begun and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before Blaise will have to pay me twenty galleons when Delaney is successful at seducing our professor.
“Yes, Your Majesty, he was a...”
“Ah, so I see the clause I created for Brendan and me is still proving useful after all these years.”
Ryan started laughing, causing Kevin and Stephen to look at him as if he’d gone crazy.
“Yeah, Dean, I am,” Harry asked.
“Don’t say that to a woman in labor,” Madam Pomfrey advised.  “She’s liable to get up and kill you.”
Some of the Death Eaters fainted at this announcement. Others murmured their obvious terror. Even Bellatrix, who was arguably one of Voldemort’s most ardent supporters, looked a bit sick, as she realized what master she was actually serving.

Looking at Hermione, however, Harry could see the determined look in her eye and he knew better then to think that he could talk her out of anything once she got that look.
“Indeed,” Dumbledore said, as he turned and looked up at Fawkes.  The phoenix looked Dumbledore in the eye for a moment, before he nodded his head and spread his wings, disappearing in a flash of flames, off to gather all of the members of the Order for an emergency meeting.
“Yes, he was the champion,” replied Bill.  “Harry Potter was also the Hogwarts champion though, because one of You-Know-Who’s Death Eaters was masquerading as a Hogwarts professor that year and placed a powerful enough Confundus charm on the Goblet of Fire to make it draw two names from Hogwarts, picking Cedric and Harry.  At any rate, it wasn’t the task that killed him, it was on You-Know-Who’s orders that he was killed by the Killing curse, after Harry and him were Portkeyed off Hogwarts grounds by the Tri-Wizard Cup.”
“Yes,” Harry said as he pulled the book from his bag, opened the front cover, and showed it to his professor.  He had packed it just in case he had the chance to talk to Professor Flitwick. “See?”
“You broke up with Ron?”  Bill asked.  “Why, Hermione?”
“Ah,” Scrimgeour said as he sat down and then asked, “Is the offer of tea still open?  I think I need to settle my nerves.”
"Mobilicorpus!  Incarcerous!"  Then, he left the room with Lucius' bound body floating along behind him.
“I don’t think it is, Justin,” Rowena said.  “The spell doesn’t read your memories or thoughts, just your vocabularies.  Think of your brain like a dictionary, full of countless words, their meanings, and various expressions.  All the spell did was to give Helga and me access to those words and their meanings, so that we can speak to you in a way that you’ll understand.  Otherwise, we probably would be speaking in a much older version of English which would be very hard for any of you to understand.”
“Corelian actually kidnapped the Minister?”  Madam Pomfrey asked.  “That certainly takes guts.”
MORFIN MARVOLO GAUNT, born 12-03-1895, died 31-10-1950, age 55
Ryan woke up in a very large bed and, for a moment, like every morning in the two weeks since his grandmother's passing, he couldn't figure out where he was. After a moment of thought, however, he realized that he was back in his old room at Cromwell Hall in Yorkshire, where he had spent the first ten years of his life. Ryan's mother had died giving birth to him and he'd always assumed that his father was dead as well, since he was raised by his grandparents. His grandmother had never actually said that his father was dead and, unlike his mother, whose grave he'd visited several times, he had no actual proof that he was dead, but he just assumed that if his father were alive, he'd be around. Not that being raised by his grandparents had been bad or anything, because both of his grandparents had always been very kind.
“It’s the Death Eaters!”  A portly man shouted as he ran into the inn, confirming the worst fears of everyone present.  “And they’ve got the Dementors with them!”
so, finally Salazar left, much to the other Founders' relief.
“A long talk with Bill,” Ron said, “He told me that if I was going to call someone my best friend, I had to learn to trust their judgment.  He also told me that I needed to learn to control my temper if I was going to get anywhere in life.”
"Yes, it is," Dumbledore nodded in agreement. "Charles has taken Draco to his home in Yorkshire. Seeing as how Charles' mother was Lucius' aunt, the Minister has appointed him as Draco's guardian, until he turns seventeen next year."
"I've come for Draco," Severus said as he walked into the room.
“I’m afraid, Pansy, I have to agree with Daphne,” Tracey said.
*	*	*
“We’re really related to Slytherin?”
Adrian Pucey was furious.  He couldn’t believe that a member of his team would attack a fellow teammate.  He knew that some of his housemates were angry with Draco for dating Aarik Potter, but that was no excuse.  In the time since Adrian had taken over as Captain of the Slytherin team, he’d hoped that he’d succeeded in his attempt to instill a sense of good sportsmanship in his players.  It had obviously not worked because Adrian didn’t consider one teammate attacking another to be an example of good sportsmanship.
Stepping forward into the darkness, Nick was momentarily surprised that the torches did not light themselves, as most torches in the Wizarding World tend to do.  He didn’t dwell on it though as he pulled out his wand and pointed it at a nearby torch and said, “Incendio!”
or we will crumble from within.
Aarik was alone in Godric’s quarters, looking quite distressed, and Godric couldn’t help but notice.
“Visiting Draco,” Ryan said.  “He is my cousin and Nick is his dorm mate, so it only makes sense we’d drop by.”
“Now, why was Sirius in Azkaban?”  James asked.
“How did Harry Potter find out?”  Angelique asked.  “It’s not a rule that is often told to the students, mostly because of the age of the majority of the professors, it’s assumed that none of the students would care about such a rule as they wouldn’t want to date any of their professors anyway.”
“You mean other than annoying their sisters to no end?”
“What I don’t understand is how the Prophet got all these pictures,” Harry said, as he looked at Page 4 of the Prophet.  “I mean this picture of Ginny and I was taken inside of Godric’s quarters.  Neither of us took a picture and we were the only ones in the room.  Godric was there of course, but I doubt he’d even know how to work a camera.  Even if he did, he’s a portrait he wouldn’t be able to send the pictures to the Prophet, so I know he didn’t do it either.”
“Similar to human weddings,” Corelian said as he held out both of his hands, “there are rings involved.  Although, humans usually only wear a ring on the third finger of the left hand, whereas Atlanteans wear a ring on the third finger of both.”
Justin looked at Corelian and noticed the look on his face, which led him to believe that Corelian already knew who all the heirs were, a fact which he soon voiced.
“Hermione, I appreciate the offer,” Harry said.  “I’m beyond hope though when it comes to dancing.  Bill tried to teach me without much success.”
“Yes, you’re right, Valen,” Bill said as he smiled at Harry and Hermione.  “Nice chatting with you two.”
"Huh?" Ron asked the look on his face one of total confusion.
“As for the being treated like a prince thing, no, far from it.  The Dursleys treated me like dirt.  They hate anything that isn’t normal and to them magic is the most abnormal thing there is.  They insulted me daily, treated me like a slave, starved me, my cousin Dudley routinely used me as a punching bag, and for the first eleven years of my life, my bedroom was a cupboard under the stairs.”
Draco looked to the left and he was sure that his eyes were on the verge of bugging out of his head, because standing on the hill overlooking the city was the largest building that Draco had ever seen.  Draco grinned inwardly when he imagined Lucius’ reaction, as he had always considered Malfoy Manor to be the grandest home ever built.  Not only did the manor pale drastically in comparison, but you could probably fit the entire house, the grounds, and the mausoleum inside the Atlantean royal palace at least five times and still have more then enough room.
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“Yes, I am,” said Harry.  “Orion and Walburga were second cousins in addition to being husband and wife.  That, Godric, I’m afraid is a side effect of the lies that you implanted in the Sorting Hat.  Many of the old pureblood families have gone to extremes to keep their blood pure, to the point that many of the older families are now so inbred that it’s really quite amazing that some of them are even capable of doing the most simple of tasks, let alone studying magic.  The most obvious examples currently at Hogwarts are Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, both Slytherins and purebloods, but their families are so inbred that they probably have the combined brain power of a slug.”
“Hospital wing,” Ryan answered, “to visit Draco.”
“I don’t want your bleeding sympathy!” Draco exclaimed, as he was totally not used to anyone other that his mom, Blaise and Daphne being nice to him.
“I’ll admit we haven’t been in the past,” Draco drawled.  “However, I think that’s been changing.  In case you haven’t noticed, my insults don’t really have the same bite as they used to.”
“Ah, I see,” said McGonagall.  “Now, why are there soap bubbles coming out of Mr. Creevey’s mouth?”
“Definitely,” Matt agreed.  “Now, if only father would meet someone, you could sponsor him too.”
Later the next evening, after dinner, Hermione and Ryan were once again in the restricted section pouring over various books, trying to find some shred of information that would tell them who the heirs were.  In the last three weeks, they’d probably gone through about two or three dozen books apiece, but had to yet find anything.  What neither of them knew, however, was that their persistence was about to strike pay dirt in a very big way.
"Sure," Ryan said, "though I must admit you are quite cute when you blush. I haven't known you that long, but I can certainly see why Matt likes you so much. How long have you been together anyway?"
Love, Percy
“So it was Peter that betrayed your parents?”
“You actually had sex with our Potions professor?”  Draco asked.
“While your willing compliance is not necessary, it is good that you realize who holds the power here in the Hells,” Asmodeus said. “However, that does not change the fact that you have allowed a devil of your realm to escape and set in motion a plan to unseat me. Such an act cannot go unpunished, even if committed in ignorance or by oversight. As punishment, I order that sixty percent of the souls bound for Phlegethos for the next 191 years be diverted here to Nessus to serve me instead of you.”
“But -”
Finally, he sighed, a decadent, long-suffering exhalation. “Alright. But you’re wasting your time.”
"Just hear me out, okay?"
“Please, I need -” he asked, voice a splinter-shard thing, and Harry nodded, shifting his grip to free Draco’s wrists and dipping his head to press a not-quite gentle kiss to his mouth. The warmth stayed, burning bright around them and casting their bodies in honey-dipped light as Harry began to fuck him in earnest, sweat shining golden on his shoulders as he slammed into Draco again and again. Draco
“I -” Draco said, scrubbing one hand anxiously through his hair. “I suppose.”
“I - you’re right. I’m sorry. It was a stupid idea.”
, the sensible part of him urged.
“And boys,” she called after them as they started to shuffle towards the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey’s undoubted ire, “If I have to deal with - whatever this is - again, I will be deducting points, or worse. Do we understand each other?”
“Done, Malfoy?” he hissed, hot into Draco’s ear. Draco growled in frustration, trying to wriggle himself free and only succeeding in pushing himself backwards against Harry.
“Please don’t flatter yourself. You were adequate.”
“I’m afraid I do, Mr Potter. Out!”
Harry crashed his lips against Draco's, a clumsy, brutal kiss that was more teeth than anything else. It was messy, and almost painful, and
He was hard and aching, had been almost since Harry had begun to touch him. Almost absently, Harry slid his free hand down Draco’s stomach, wrapping strong fingers around Draco’s cock and giving him just enough friction to make him whimper and arch up into Harry’s grip.
“If you don’t stop that I’m going to -” Harry muttered, feeling his cheeks flush pink.
, Malfoy had the sense to shut up, to back off when he saw the warning painted black in Harry's eyes.
“Yeah,” Draco said absently, and his breathing restarted with an engine- stutter gasp. There was a pause, and then, slowly and deliberately, Draco rocked his hips back again. Harry bit back the keening whine that threatened to escape his throat.
“Yeah?”
“Get out of the bath,” he said gently. “And come into the living room. I have an idea.”
“Debatable,” Draco muttered acidly, though they both knew he didn’t mean it.
“Ugh, get
"Sorry-" Harry started automatically, panicking a little now that it was done and couldn't be taken back.
“Yeah, all of that. You can ignore it. You can ignore all of them, honestly. It was just an idea.”
"Oh." Somehow, it hadn't occurred to Harry that Draco might be as affected as he was. "Fuck," he said, eloquently. Draco rolled his eyes and rubbed a hand through his hair with delicate fingers. Harry couldn't tear his gaze away from the outline of Malfoy's cock against his trousers, obscene and thick. Harry's palm itched to touch, to rub his hand across the heat of it, to squeeze and feel the hot throb of desire pulse through it. It was overwhelming and unfamiliar, setting him off-kilter and almost physically reeling, a burning rush of utterly primal arousal licking through him that defied all attempts at control.
"Oh, thank fuck," Harry groaned, taking a quick look around himself before letting Malfoy go and stepping back hastily. "You utter
“What?”
Draco blinked, twisting his arm behind his back ever so slightly, that half-conscious movement telling Harry everything he needed to know. His gaze slid away from Harry to stare at the sink intently, brows furrowed, lips drawn in a thin, hard line. Harry felt his stomach lurch, disappointed, and tried to hide it with a false, cheery smile.
“Rebirth?” There was a cautiously curious tone to Draco’s voice.
Knuckles itching, spoiling for a fight, Harry stopped. His heart pounded at his ribcage, thunderous and fury-fast, his jaw clenched so tight that he could feel his teeth aching.
- at the black that marred the pale expanse of his arm, brows knitted tight together, mouth in that thin, turned-down-at-the-corners grimace which made him look far older than he was.
“Don’t I?” A nonchalant enough reply, but tinted with such crafted carelessness that it immediately made Harry suspicious. He watched as Draco’s eyes flicked upwards to meet his, immediately skittering back down to his book with a deer-startled, almost guilty expression.
You could get it covered. With another tattoo.”
“If you were, I’d worry you’d been replaced. And speaking of you not being nice, I think you owe me some pastries.”
“Fighting,” Harry replied smartly. Draco nodded along.
They crowded themselves into the cupboard and paused, pressed against each other in the narrow space. Harry's heartbeat roared like the ocean in his ears, his breathing ragged, and he could hear that Draco's was gratifyingly similar, hot against his cheek in the dark.
“I hate it. And I know you hate it too.” There was a break threatening in Draco’s voice, a trembling lilt that squeezed Harry’s heart into bright, tight pain for a moment.
“Thank you.”
Draco didn't move for a moment, forehead pressed to the archway. Harry saw him take a deep and shaky breath before pushing away from the weathered stone and turning to face him, quicksilver-eyes skittering away from Harry's face to stare at the ground.
Potter,” Draco grimaced. “Now. Let’s get our story straight before we have to explain this to Pomfrey, agreed?”
“ - It’s just because I’m all pushed against you -” Harry plunged on.
the Dark Mark as well as to hide it."
“Please don’t embarrass yourself
a mudblood - just like your mother."
Harry shrugged, frowning. “It was, at first. I suppose it still would be, on someone else.”
“But -” Draco struggled for a moment with his thoughts. “After everything he did to you. Everything - Voldemort - put you through. Surely this - this is a reminder of all of it, all of that pain and suffering - of everything we saw.”
"What?" Draco sighed, pushing himself back reluctantly and fumbling for his wand to perform a quick cleaning spell. "Honestly, if you're regretting this I don't want to know yet.”
forgotten to brush it - not that it ever made a difference; his hair was untameable, a dark, eternally tousled mess that did as it pleased.
This was unfair, and they both knew it.
“What? You’re going to come all over yourself? How
“Yeah. Much better, actually. Maybe even brilliant.”
“Not the first time, Potter.” He made no move to take the bathrobe off, though, looking at Harry with that silver-spark gleam of challenge in his eyes that always goaded him into ever more reckless contests.
“What reputation?” Harry spluttered, twisting Draco’s arm in irritation. Draco grunted.
” Draco said petulantly. “More -”
He lifted the page he had been scribbling on to show Draco.
“Move over.”
a morning person, and could happily sleep until after lunchtime if left to his own devices.
This time, Harry’s swinging fist caught Malfoy in the gut, a surprised rush of air forced out of him as he doubled over, gasping and coughing. A hot streak of pure joy sparked through Harry like lightning, blue-bright like a summer storm, and he grinned, more teeth than smile, wolf-sharp and dangerous.
But now, years later, and after settling into as much domesticity as two people so much at odds with each other could ever manage, Harry had grown used to it. More than used to it, if he was being honest. It was part of Draco - and Harry loved Draco. All of him, Dark Mark included. It was simply another battle scar from the war, another reminder that he had survived despite everything. On Draco, it was a promise, to Harry’s mind - that the past did not define the person you chose to become.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever seen or even so much as read about such a creature,” Justin said.
*	*	*
“No, actually, you’re not,” Bill said.  “To make a long story short, it has recently come to light that your younger brother, Tom Marvolo Riddle, is still 16 years old, as a lesser devil named Voldemort has been holding him prisoner under a Dark Arts version of the Time Suspension Charm since the spring of 1943.”
“I thought you’d - “
“What is it, Potter? I’m trying to read.”
Harry growled, embarrassed and furious, and squeezed Draco's neck viciously.
Harry thought in transfixed fascination, and then he smiled. It was a triumphant, fire-brand smirk of a smile, that of a boy getting
Harry turned back to face Draco, shoulders slumped. “Then what was this.”
Draco could do nothing but obey, a guttural howl ripped from somewhere deep inside him as he came all over Harry’s hand, hot and messy and perfect, cock throbbing hot against Harry’s palm. Harry followed helplessly, burying himself deep inside Draco’s body with a wordless groan, sweat-dark hair in his eyes and magic burning through his bones.
Malfoy shuddering against him, open and raw and vulnerable.
to resolve.
“Draco.”
“Don’t fucking
Tentatively at first, waiting for Draco’s reaction, Harry stroked over the looping swirl of the Dark Mark, following the curve of it around to the head of the snake and back again. A little pressure, the back of his nail
“Now I feel underdressed,” Harry grinned, eyeing Draco.

that Draco needed it; had known from almost the moment they started out with awkward, half-angry fumbles in echoing corridors that Draco needed to let go of
“Harry. Thank you. For - last night.”
He rolled out of bed with a groan, fumbling for his glasses and some clothes that were at least vaguely clean, and stumbled downstairs in search of coffee and Draco. Usually, he was to be found at the kitchen table, immaculately dressed and somehow already actually
“Oh. That’s - that’s a phoenix. I don’t really know why I did that one, I guess. I just thought, you know - “
“You always
“Yes, Professor. Sorry, Professor.”
“Yeah. I couldn’t decide between a peacock and just a peacock feather, so I tried both.”
me -”
"Yeah, me too," Draco grunted back instead. "Fuck, like that, Potter. That's good-"
Draco smiled, a real, warm smile that made Harry’s heart ache. “You don’t expect me to be nice to you, surely?”
"Potter! Oi, Potter!"
The knowledge that Malfoy was as close as he was, that what he was doing to his cock felt somehow as good as Draco's hand on his own, was all it took. Harry came with savagely blinding force, biting down hard on his knuckles to keep quiet and failing. Draco was only seconds behind him, muttering a string of incoherent filth against Harry's neck. Harry felt the hot, sticky mess coat his fingers, Draco's cock throbbing against his palm, and realised with sudden, hazy clarity, that this was it. Nothing would ever come close to this moment, sweat-slick and sticky in a closet with Draco
“No,” Harry said, not looking up. “Not a spell.”
"Let me finish. It's partially my fault. I know I treated you differently for having the Mark. I'm sorry - I really am - for making you think you were lesser, or not good enough, or anything like that. So, give me one night. Tonight. Let me try and prove to you that I don't hate it, and in the morning, you can choose."
His anger flared bright again, Malfoy's nonchalant arrogance spurring him on. He charged, a bull goaded by the streak of red on Malfoy's lip and the dull pulse in his knuckles.
As a matter of fact, Harry
He shouldered his way roughly past Draco, groping for the door. He was still seething - partially at Draco, the absolute wanker, but also at himself, at his brand-hot anger that flared brightest around Malfoy. If only he could have controlled his reaction, he might not be escaping from a
"Shut up," Harry hissed, and grabbed the back of Draco's neck with bruising fingers. "I don't
Finally Harry managed to pin Draco against one of the weatherworn archways, his face pressed to the cold stone, one arm twisted behind him just a little too high to be comfortable. He had a blue-black bruise over his eyes to add to the split lip, and he was sure there were several more brewing across his pale body. He scowled, cheek pressed painfully against the arch, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry could feel the shift of his shoulders with every inhalation, his body held tight against Malfoy to keep him from escaping.
"Oliver, if you are going to be a member of this family," Charles said, "I'd really appreciate it if you would refrain from insulting it's members."
“Don’t worry, Madam,” Queen Calliara said in a soothing voice.  “This lift is water-tight.”
Pulling out his wand, Harry performed a simple diagnostic spell that Madame Pomfrey had taught them in the Basics of Battlefield Medicine group.
“It’s not Hermione’s fault that Lucius tortured you, Malfoy.”
Ron grinned at his brother and said, “I suppose it doesn’t help that thanks to Colin, mum is going to be raking your arse over the coals, since I doubt she knew you posed for Playwitch.”
“That is probably true,” Rowena stated.  “Of course, if there was one thing that I learned in life, it was that knowledge can be vastly more valuable than all the galleons in the world.  Who are the other people you mentioned, Ryan?”
“My name is Ryan Cole Cromwell, ma’am.”
To be continued.
“Erevan, just because you married Calliara Laitannen does not mean that I am going to give her brother Corelian any special treatment,” King Tyriand explained.  “The law is the law, and the law clearly states that no half-breeds are allowed in Atlantis.  The law also clearly states that Atlanteans who are first in line to positions in the Circle cannot live anywhere but Atlantis for any period longer than a year and a half.  So, I am sorry, Erevan, but Corelian will stay here and his bastard son will stay in England.  Nothing that either of you say will change my mind, so you might as well stop wasting your breath and get out of my sight.”
To be continued...
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
Professor Snape was obviously not happy and he stalked out of the common room, as Vaisey and Urquhart shot death glares at Adrian.  Crabbe and Goyle were looking just as clueless as they usually did.
Ollivander nodded and said, "Yes, I was a Hufflepuff.  All the Ollivander males for the past three centuries have been Hufflepuffs, while the females have been Ravenclaws.  As for Mr. Diggory being your heir, I completely forgot, Madam.  I'm afraid that my age does tend to creep up on me, at times."
“Quite a bit, actually,” Alaric answered.  “You see, Dad, Tom Riddle was a boy pure of heart, who found out about your Chamber and what it contained.  He searched it out, opened it, and took a rooster with him, fully intending to kill the basilisk so that it couldn’t harm anyone.  He didn’t count on finding him there though.”
Harry tried ‘Lemon Drops’, ‘Sherbet Lemon’, ‘Skittles’, and ‘Peanut Brittle’ without any success.  Hermione tried ‘Sweet Tarts’, ‘Nerds’, and ‘Kit Kat’ without any luck.  Harry and Hermione were beginning to get a bit frustrated to be honest, when finally the gargoyle jumped aside when Harry said ‘M&Ms’.
Rowena then explained the truth to Dumbledore and informed him of a spell which she thought would counteract the charms that Godric must have used to give the hat false memories and to block the real ones.  Pulling out his wand, Dumbledore tried the spell, and it indeed worked.
“Do you now?”  Dumbledore asked, his eyes twinkling.  “And who is the heir that you know?”
“Well, there’s more to it then that though,” said Nick.
Arriving at the end of the hallway that the kitchen was in, Zacharias counted the bricks to find the one Rowena had said and then traced Helga’s initials on the brick.  Ryan, Hermione, Harry, and Justin stood with baited breath, watching as the three letters began to glow on the brick, except that they were bright yellow, instead of blue like Rowena’s quarters.  The sound of stone moving against stone sounded as the doorway opened and Zacharias stepped through the doorway.
“Won’t you get into trouble though?”
“No, that’s not possible,” answered Aarik.  “Not without saying goodbye to me first.  Not to mention that he’s supposed to be staying at Hogwarts for winter break.”
“Harry, what did you do to my brother?”  Dennis asked, although Harry noted that Dennis did not sound particularly mad, just amused.
“But, that is not nearly enough punishment, I think,” Asmodeus said. “Considering decisions you’ve both made on other, unrelated matters, I think a stricter punishment is in order.”
"Of course, Sev," Draco said, using the nickname that Severus has grudgingly allowed Draco to call him for the last several years. "I wouldn't do anything to get you in trouble."
“Yes, My Lady High Priestess,” Anarra said, and Draco could tell that she was obviously very excited about the fruit of this Tree of Life.
*     *     *
“Oh, right, well, you guys know that I’m gay,” Ryan said and Matt and Oliver nodded. “Well, I wanted to tell you that Justin and I are together now. We’ve been dating for a little over a month now.”
*	*	*
"Well, I do have a few questions."
Dobby had not noticed the portrait above the fireplace and looked scared for a moment before Ryan pointed at the portrait.  Dobby turned toward the fireplace and looked up at the portrait for a moment before dropping to his knees and bowing.  After a moment, he stood and said, “It an honor to meet you, Mistress Ravenclaw.”
“No, Asheera was with him,” Alaric answered.  “So, wherever Draco is, I’m sure he’s safe.  Asheera is a very powerful witch and I’m sure she wouldn’t let Draco be harmed in anyway.”
Taking the wand and swishing it, Cedric's face was soon covered in soot, following a small explosion which knocked Ollivander off his feet and caused him to knock over several of the boxes behind him.  Standing up and dusting himself off, Ollivander took the wand and said, "Definitely not a good match."
"I am not disputing that fact, Severus," Charles said. "However, the Ministry has granted me custody of Draco until he reaches his age of majority."
“Why would you special order wood from Atlantis?”  Justin asked.  “I’m sure you could have simply gone to Ollivander’s and gotten wands.”
Dumbledore grinned and said, “I apologize, Molly.  I have just been trying to figure out the best way to tell you the news that I have for all of you.  It is certainly something that I never imagined myself having to tell anyone, as it involves something that up until recently I thought was utterly impossible.  One would think that in my century and a half on this planet that I would have learned that nothing is impossible, but oh well, even old men like me can learn new things I guess.”
“Because despite the pain he inflicted on me,” Tom said, “he did cast the Dark Arts prison variant of the Time Suspension Charm on me.  Now that I am no longer his prisoner, I can live my life as if the last fifty-four years never happened.  While I will always hate Voldemort for what he did to me, I am still grateful for that one gift.”
“I can certainly understand that, Minister,” King Erevan said.  “Atlantis has been under the control of the House of Rivarendell since the founding of the kingdom and I would not want to be remembered as the King who placed the welfare of my people in the hands of Muggles.  It does mean, however, no matter how much I may wish otherwise, that I will be unable to commit any Atlantean forces to help you against Voldemort.  The Kingdom of Atlantis has no choice but to remain neutral in the war. Now, let us return to the palace and from there the Circle can send all of you back to your homes.”
“Fair enough,” Nick said with a sigh and Harry could tell that he’d rather Draco called him Nick, but he wasn’t going to push the issue.
Since he didn’t have his wand yet, Corelian exited the dining room in order to perform the countercharms for the concealment spells that he wore on his jewelry.  He had never been much of a man for jewelry, but the Atlantean marriage rites had three main pieces of jewelry, plus two other optional pieces.  Both Corelian and Asheera wore all five pieces of jewelry, but some couples chose to use only the main three.
*	*	*
“...stock from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes...”  George continued.
“Maybe we should tell Professor Dumbledore,” Hermione said.  “He was on staff here when Tom Riddle first came to school here, so he might know more about this Ariana Riddle.”
Corelian raised both of his arms and began chanting in an ancient Atlantean dialect.
My new friendship with Harry is going pretty well, all things considered.  It’s common knowledge in the castle now that I’ve buried the hatchet with him.  Some chose not to believe it of course.  And still others, mainly my fellow Slytherins, seem to believe that I’m setting a trap for Harry.  Pretend to befriend him and then deliver him to You-Know-Who.  Of course, the Slytherins aren’t the only ones who think that because Weasley thinks that too.  Harry told me last night that Weasley hasn’t said more than two words to him since the night Harry offered me his hand.
Professor Dumbledore was, in fact, a very busy man this afternoon, because after contacting Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and Mr. and Mrs. Diggory, he also contacted Remus Lupin, as well as Percy, Fred, and George Weasley.  He had been tempted to place a Floo-call to Romania and ask Charlie to come home, but he was fresh out of International Floo Powder and decided to send an owl instead.  The only people that Dumbledore didn’t contact who could be considered an interested party were Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Dursley, but that was at Lily’s request, as she wanted to deal with her sister and brother-in-law personally.
“No, nothings wrong,” Bill said.  “It’s just that over the summer I tried giving Harry dancing lessons and I was just remembering how much my feet hurt after being stepped on too many times.”
"Oh it can be, trust me," Charles said.
“Of course you did you bloody ferret.  Harry can’t possibly be in his right mind, because he would never willingly offer his friendship to the likes of you.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Correct. Five points to Slytherin.  Now, it should be noted that Amortentia does not actually create love, as nothing can manufacture or imitate real love.  The potion will merely cause it’s drinker to form a powerful infatuation or obsession with an intended target.”
“Godric Gryffindor’s private quarters,” Harry said.  “I recently found out that I’m Gryffindor’s heir.”

“Yes, we were,” answered Brendan.  “We fell in love while I was still a student at Hogwarts.  When the school was founded, the rule about no student and teacher relationships was written, but after Rowena and I fell in love, she asked the other founders if she could add the clause stating that it was okay for students and teachers to date if the student was over seventeen.  They knew that Rowena and I loved each other, so they agreed to the clause.  I’m glad they did, because if they hadn’t, I would have had to wait until after I graduated to be with Rowena.  I was so deeply in love with her that I don’t think I could have handled trying to have a completely platonic relationship for three years.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down near the front of the room.  Normally, they would be inclined to sit as close to the back of the room as possible, but with Bill as their teacher, they didn’t mind sitting up front.  Once the whole class had arrived, Harry scanned the room and saw that there were thirteen other people in the class: five from Slytherin, five from Ravenclaw, and three from Hufflepuff.
“So, a lesser devil thinks he can unseat me, does he?” Asmodeus said. “Well, we’ll see about that.”
Putting one of his usual ocean blue robes on over his tunic, Valen picked up his belt and fastened it around his waist, before fastening his scabbard to his belt.  Taking his sword from its rack above his desk, Valen looked at the sapphire-studded hilt and the engraving in the blade that said, ‘Lord Valen Tynan Lasinius’.
“Please have a seat,” Rufus said as Corelian entered.
"Well, my Uncle Charles is Draco's guardian now," Ryan said. "So he wrote them a note. I'm here with my cousin Matt and his boyfriend, but they went off to say hello to some old friends from school."
“I can’t ask you to do that,” Hermione said.
“Then we just need to brew the potion,” Salazar said, “and get Professor Snape to agree to donate a few drops of his blood.  Many of the potion’s ingredients are very rare, but that is not a problem in my private potions lab, because I charmed it so that it would have an infinite supply of every non-plant ingredient in existence.  I relied on Helga’s greenhouse for the plant ingredients to ensure freshness.”
"Now, Severus, you know I can't let you take him," Charles said as Draco silently watched the exchange.
“Good afternoon, students,” Professor Dumbledore said.  “Before you get on the carriages, I just want to wish all of you Happy Holidays and I hope to see all of you back here safe and sound come January Fifth.”

Ministry officials speculate that if the attacking force of Dementors was large enough, the Aurors and crew could very possibly have frozen solid from the cold of the environment and the fact that the Dementors would have robbed them of any of the artificial heat they had managed to produce.  Examinations of the deceased crew and Aurors indicate that those who didn’t die from the Dementor’s Kiss died from extreme cases of hypothermia.
Harry remained quiet through all of this, but there were still some questions that the group needed answers to, so Zach asked, “How would the Dark Marks prevent Asmodeus from forcing Voldemort’s return?”
“If it makes you feel any better, Matt,” Justin said, “he hasn’t given me permission either and I’m his boyfriend.”
The security wizard placed the wand on the brass device and it began to vibrate.  After a minute, it started to vibrate more and after a minute, it stopped.  Finally, a small strip of parchment came out, which the wizard took and read.
Adrian asked Madame Rosemerta to make sure none of the students left the room while he was talking to Dumbledore and he then grabbed the pouch of Floo powder and threw some into the flames as he shouted, “Hogwarts, Headmaster’s office,” before sticking his head into the flames.

“There must be more books here then in the Hogwarts library and restricted section combined.”
“Does it have to be me?”  Nikolas asked.
“We discussed that,” Aarik said.  “We decided not to allow our relationship off the pitch to affect us during games.  In other words, he doesn’t stand a chance, because I intend to get the Snitch.”
“Godric and Salazar were married and had a child?”
As if he could read what was on his mind, Justin said, “No, Ryan, we just shared the bed last night.”
“Well, if you prefer Ryan, then Ryan it shall be,” Corelian answered with a smile as he sat back down.  “I loved your mother, Ryan.  I loved her very much.  We were to be married, but then two weeks before the wedding, you were born and she suffered complications and died.  I had every intention of staying in England and raising you myself, but what a person intends to do and what they actually do are often very different things.”
"Yes, still wearing my flesh," Draco answered firmly.
Arriving on the seventh floor, Ron looked at the map to try to find Harry, hoping that he was not in Gryffindor Tower and thus perhaps wondering where his cloak and map where.  Finding Harry in the Headmaster’s office, Ron breathed a sigh of relief as he tapped the map with his wand and said, “Mischief managed,” before folding it back up and tucking it into his pocked.  He then removed the cloak and hid it under his robes as he made his way to Gryffindor Tower.

“Peeves will go when he wants to,” the poltergeist said in a mocking tone.
“Because you and your friends never tell me anything!”  Colin blurted out.
“You’re sure?”
“Now, Drake, you don’t really want to kill me, do you?”
you -”
“Make me,” Harry grinned, smug in the knowledge that he was heavier. Draco squirmed back again, and that was when Harry realised, in utterly all-consuming horror, that he was hard, the hot line of his cock pressing against Malfoy’s arse. Draco froze.
Draco sat in silence for what felt like forever, Harry scratching blunt-bitten nails at the back of his neck in nervous anticipation.
“Fuck, please, just like that, please that’s so
“Ugh, why do you have to make this so difficult? Look. I’m not. I mean. I hadn’t. With anyone, alright?”
good at lying.”
“You m-”
"Now what, Potter?" he asked, disdain tempered with almost tentative interest. "Or was this the entirety of your plan?"
“Oh no, don’t let me stop you. Romance away. I’m all yours.” Draco shrugged, barely suppressing the smile that tugged at the corners of his mouth. He followed Harry upstairs with what he felt to be the bare minimum of complaining and threw himself onto the bed before Harry could get into it, arranging his limbs and the bathrobe in a comically sultry pose.
“Beautiful,” he said, hoarse and ragged, and Draco had nowhere to go, no hiding place to run to so that he could ignore the words. “You’re beautiful.” Draco stilled as he felt a curl of Harry’s innate magic crackle over his over-sensitive skin; the taste of it ozone-thick and sparking on his tongue and the back of his throat, familiar and intoxicating and always just a
“Can you let me at least
“Oh,” Harry said stupidly.
“You know,” Harry said, thinking about how utterly terribly his morning had started out. He grinned back at Malfoy, wanting to laugh, wanting to split his chest open from the sheer promise of
“And a treacle tart for tonight?”
It was beautiful - vibrant and alive on Draco’s pale skin, utterly concealing the Dark Mark which he had hated so much; a perfect, wondrous piece of art. And yet Harry couldn’t help the pang of grief for Draco that spiked through him regardless, that Draco had felt like he
“Oh, shut up,” he said, closing his eyes and trying to think about literally anything else. “This is bad enough already.”
, every time - the way his mouth would half open in pleasure, his fingers slowly disappearing inside him, head falling back against the pillows as he opened himself up. He knew Draco took longer than necessary, knew he delighted in making Harry wait for it even though he was just as desperate. Usually, he had enough patience to enjoy the show. Usually.
“So what’s this no doubt brilliant idea?” Draco drawled, throwing himself onto the sofa with gracefully artful composure that only partially hid the nervous tension in his face. “Let me guess - you know a spell to get rid of it magically? Because I can tell you that if such a spell existed, I’d have used it by now. Merlin knows I tried.”
Draco was silent, his breath held. “I don’t know,” he sighed finally, a defeated rush of air. “Both?” Tilting his head back, he looked up at Harry behind him, his eyes so wide and sad that it made Harry ache to make it better.
