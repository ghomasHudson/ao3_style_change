McGonagall stepped forward and rested her hand on Harry’s shoulder. “The Tournament cannot go ahead as planned Mr. Potter. It will have to be postponed or cancelled.”
Ginny had pursed her lips at the mention of Hermione, and eyed him for a prolonged minute after he finished before her expression settled carefully, and she gave a shrug. “Convenient for you, she’s already here.”
He would not walk off this floor, accepting his losses, to go privately lick his wounds and hope that tomorrow they could act like it hadn’t happened.
On Friday, Draco decided to mention it to Harry, Hermione and Ron. He definitely hadn’t expected the sharp look Hermione sent Harry’s way, or for Harry to look sheepishly at the floor.
At one point, Draco imagined that he could hear hissing. Almost like a snake would make… exactly like a snake would make. A very large one if his imagination was to be trusted, though at the moment that was admittedly questionable.
The old wizard looked sad at that. “Unfortunately Harry, the wizard you allowed to use this Map was not the real Alastor Moody.”
Draco understood all at once. The man still thought that he had Harry at his mercy, he couldn’t know that wasn’t the case. And there was only one true enemy of Harry’s: the Dark Lord. Draco’s parents had made it seem, as it was likely what they’d assumed, that the Dark Lord would rise again and
my friend. Or, or I mean, you were, to me. Before I bollocksed it up by acting how I did. I understand if you wouldn’t want to be, anymore,” he finished lamely, feeling very small.
Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in person for years. He could still remember the end of the war, how beaten down and frail the blond had looked at his trial. How his emptiness had unnerved Harry.
All at once Draco understood. Magic, even Dark Magic, performed incorrectly never had the intended outcome. Nearly everyone in the wizarding world was enemy to the Dark Lord, including Adam, but only Harry was the Dark Lord’s enemy. Likely only Harry’s blood would have brought him back correctly, and Harry wasn’t actually here.
Harry and Malfoy were far better than any of the newcomers on the pitch, including the other Houses. When the supervisors first released the snitch, Harry caught it within three and a half minutes, and Malfoy actually cheered him. The blond was truly far better with a quaffle than he’d ever been with a snitch. Harry even found himself wondering if Gryffindor would have won less matches, had Malfoy been playing the right position.
Neville laughed, eyeing Ron on the sofa across from him. “I think she might be trying to tell you something mate.”
Harry wasn’t paying attention, though, distracted by the moving boxes strewn about. “What’s all this for?” he asked curiously.
"Know anything about how to breathe underwater?" Draco asked by way of response, not expecting anything to come of it.
“Why you hate muggles, why you think purebloods are so much better than everybody else. Why you thought Voldemort was some kind of saviour to wizard kind,” Harry ticked each one off on his fingers. “If you can convince me, I’ll leave you alone for good.”
"Talking about me?" Draco's groggy voice inquired, his lips turning up softly as his eyes slowly opened. It might of been the most endearing thing Harry'd ever seen.
Before she could answer, the Auror who looked like Diggory showed up. He took in the sight of all three of them standing around the cup and blinked. “What’s going on?”
Ron sighed, setting his own empty glass on the small center table. “We haven’t been together all that long,” he finally said.
Orion and Walburga’s single remaining legitimate son, Regulus—incidentally the only one of Bellatrix’s relatives that might have then contended for the title—had been reported missing by his elder brother only three days following the murder of his aunt and uncle, and had since been presumed dead.
"They could put anything under that water, Harry," Hermione reminded him softly. "Just because you'll be able to breathe now doesn't make the task safe."
Harry rubbed the side of his head, dismissing his automatic understanding of the unfamiliar word as something he was sure he’d have to deal with later. “So was I,” he said, then sighed. “I just… I feel like I don’t see Remus enough. Maybe we could visit more often?”
Malfoy cut him off with his lips. Somewhere far far away, Harry heard someone—or perhaps several someones—gasping. But it was the last thing he cared about. At the moment, there was no one else in the entire world that mattered but Draco.
Draco's cheeks were pinking up, despite his clear efforts to look unbothered. "It wouldn't matter, obviously I'd be glad enough just to see them."
Not nearly long enough later, Harry pulled away. Draco’s heart stopped, the fear that this was another cruel dream rushing back. That was, until Harry said, “I’m so sorry.”
Realisation seemed to dawn on Harry’s godfather all at once. “Oh! You thought I would be upset that you prefer blokes?”
Blaise seemed unable to help the way his lips tilted upward. "I doubt somehow that your definition of nice and Potter's add up."
Harry and Malfoy exchanged a sour look with each other. “We were only talking about the… missing student, Sir,” replied Malfoy before Harry could come up with a way to phrase
“You’re still not speaking to me then?” Harry asked quietly from the entry way later that evening. Blaise’s curtains immediately closed with a flick of his wand. The only other person in their room was Greg, and based on his lack of reaction Harry guessed he already had a silencing charm around him.
I hope the story flow all ends up making sense and working for you guys once you have the next chap!
Harry looked toward Draco's empty place at the Slytherin table, and then over towards Snape's, and he wasn't so sure.
Draco had no way of knowing what the reply would have been, as Hermione chose that moment to suddenly shout, “Polyjuice!”
“And how has that been so far?” she asked lightly, after he’d told her of his decision to move back to his family Manor.
Draco didn’t, just stared at him until Snape dismissed them all. Harry sighed in defeat and rose, preparing to walk away, when Draco suddenly took hold of his arm and pulled him down. Their lips met roughly for the first time in what felt like
“He’s only been awake for a few—” She didn’t need to finish though, because Harry had already barreled into the room and thrown his arms around Draco, head buried between his neck and shoulder.
Harry grunted a bit, but then his eyes flew open and he bolted upright almost cartoonishly. "What's happening?" They locked eyes then, and just as Draco thought Harry was going to stand up and run off, he said "You stayed."
Harry couldn’t fully meet his eyes. But he was having trouble looking away. “Yeah, um. I’m sorry, it’s just I was stupid to forget a sweater. Just cold, s’all. We can go on in now,” he told his sister.
“Tell them I’m going to take the longest shower I’ve ever taken, so it’s fine if you lot eat breakfast without me. And Dad?” he asked before the older man could leave. “Could you call him Harry?”
She rolled her eyes. “I can’t exactly be competing with her all the time. Talk about a lose-lose situation.”
Harry sat back, his food entirely forgotten as he digested the horror story he’d just been informed of. Eventually, Maria stood. “I have Siskin for first, too, come on. They say he really hates it when kids are late.”
Draco winced as the words reverberated through his mind. Despite what had happened this year, Lucius Malfoy had not been a bad father. For most of Draco’s life, his father had done nothing but push him toward greatness. He’d said it was what Draco deserved.
“I mean go into the maze,” Theo clarified. “Harry might be the Boy Who Lived, but he’s still just a teenager. If he gets to be there, why shouldn’t you? Then at least you’ll be there to protect him. That’s what you want, isn’t it?”
that by the way. Yes I've met Harry! But any random bloke on the street would bet every last coin in Gringotts that yours was his favourite name given five sodding minutes with him! I have never felt so dim in my
If there was one thing Hermione thought she'd never hear the likes of Draco Malfoy say, it would have been the proclamation that he could
Hermione herself was doing her best not to laugh, Pansy and Luna seemed to be doing the same. Harry was biting his lip, looking rather flushed. Grey eyes finally met green, and the air seemed to electrify between them. Draco swallowed and looked away.
“We were quite relieved to hear from you so quickly, Albus,” Draco’s mother said with a practiced smile.
memories, remember? Thinks they’re all horrible and avoids…” Harry’d trailed off, locking eyes with Sheila as it had occurred to him. “That has something to do with all of this, too, doesn’t it? This entire situation. He vanishes—er, occludes more forcefully when
They were nearly to the pitch when Ayesha spoke. “You going to tell me what that weirdness was about?” she inquired.
They came to the right door soon enough and the volume of hundreds of people screaming in welcome hit them full force as soon as Harry opened it. Neville had clearly just taken the stage—and was riling up the audience as one did.
Neville was staring at him, mouth slightly open but apparently unable to reply. Blaise eyed those lips for a few seconds, to give them a chance to form words. When that didn’t happen, he decided he’d been patient enough.
“All right,” Harry accepted, stealing Draco's hand back just shy of desperately. The blond smiled again, squeezing, and their companions seemed to relax.
The second task was in less than two weeks, and they'd been through book after book about Merfolk and breathing underwater and been entirely unable to find anything Hermione or Draco himself labeled sufficient. Worse, Harry—in Draco's opinion—was nowhere near as concerned about this as he should have been. His endless optimism was beginning to worry Draco as much as the rest of it.
Harry knew it was a bit ridiculous to feel guilty, as this was all to do with Voldemort and not him, but he still regretted taking this opportunity away from the other three. Harry’d never wanted to be a part of the Tournament in the first place, but the others had.
This Neville here with him was not so different, he suspected. He didn’t want to be disloyal, and he let what people said get to him, but he had bravery in him. That had been what Harry was appealing to.
Care of Magical Creatures was also the only class he shared with Malfoy this term, and he couldn’t say he minded much. When he arrived outside, the blond was stood next to two girls, chatting to them in french. There was something about the way the language sounded in Malfoy’s voice that Harry liked. He stopped beside the three of them, basking a bit in the light breeze and smell of mountain soil.
"I don't know where he is," Blaise answered the silent question in his eyes, "but you've got to get going or you'll be late. And I'd imagine that'd be bad."
Draco sputtered a little at this but clearly couldn’t deny it, or form any response at all by the looks of it. He cleared his throat and adjusted his seating position just a fraction. Hermione refused to overanalyse
Okay so, sometimes I have to go back and make minor edits because I don’t catch the little plot hole in time. It’s happened a handful of times (sorry), but I’ve been catching them as I’ve been rereading to make sure everything is correct before I finally finish up this fic. This latest time was fully an accident as I just wasn’t paying attention. So, to course-correct for those who read it before I fixed it: Bellatrix was twenty *nine* when she “took over” her House. Not twenty. That is important. Full disclosure, the HP movies mess with my perception of ages every now and again. My bad.
Before he had the chance to say anything more, her expression had already shifted from expectancy to recognition and had settled rapidly into indignation.
“Excited?” Celine asked, barely restraining her smile as she observed the two of them enthusiastically scarf down their waffles.
Other people were looking over at them now, and Draco cared so little that he himself began to wonder if perhaps he had overdone it a smidge.
It’s like, even when you have a plan, you don’t really realize how long certain parts/sections are going to be and everything until you actually write them out. There was a time way back when when I thought I was halfway done, just because I was half way through what I’d put down at the time. And it was, as we now know, decidedly not halfway done at that point. I hope no one has minded. You guys are so lovely, part of me wishes I could keep this going forever. The other part desperately wants to get to everything I’ve been saving up. Ah.
Harry waved him off, doing all he could to ignore the uncomfortable feelings lingering in his chest.
Harry, Dumbledore and the Auror force had set up an entire plan to draw out the monster and prevent his attack when he hadn’t even yet been capable of attacking! And then, given the chance to stop his return, they hadn’t. They’d hidden behind gravestones and let the world’s greatest evil be reborn. Why the hell weren’t they doing anything? Where the bloody hell was back up? If they all hadn’t of grabbed that portkey at once, some or all of them would have died by now!
He looked up. There was no sign of whatever, or whoever, had collided with him. Harry finally was able to see that he was in a graveyard, headstones all around him, and there were Death Eaters everywhere. Or, at least he assumed they were Death Eaters based on how they were dressed. They looked just as they had at the World Cup in the summer.
had written about them. Though, perhaps it was true he should read the whole article first before he assessed his emotions. He picked up the paper without answering.
Harry’s expression darkened. First she was telling him to drop his concerns, as though they were the problem, and then in the next breath confirming they were all well founded?
Theo leapt nearly a foot into the air, then clutched his hand to his chest rather dramatically. "Bloody hell, mate. You scared the daylights out of me."
“What?” asked the blond, just before understanding surfaced. “Oh, about the missing girl. Yes I’ve been informed of the ‘curse
, Harry thought. And then the blond licked his lips, and Harry understood completely what he'd been saying moments earlier.
“Weasley,” Draco hissed at the sleeping prat, who did not so much as twitch. “Weasley,” he tried again, “Weasley get up.” Draco nudged him with his foot a few times before giving up entirely and kicking him swiftly in the gut.
Luna was not alone when Hermione found her. The blonde was in the greenhouse with Neville; they’d made fast-friends, he being one of the only non-Slytherin in all of Hogwarts besides Hermione who showed her—and Harry as well—open support.
"It's alright Hermione," Harry interrupted. "Ron obviously has a few things he wants to say to me. Might as well say them now."
“How’s everyone been?” he asked cheekily into the microphone. He allowed them to scream for just under another minute before he said, “Well that’s good to hear! I’ve had a lot going on, but I missed you! Did you miss me?”
“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone. His eyes flickered past Harry and landed on Draco where he still stood near the cave entrance. “I thought you might bring him along.”
“Thanks,” said Sirius, sitting down and tearing off a large piece of chicken with his teeth. “I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”
Harry had promised he’d go wherever it was today, and now Ayesha thought he’d only been lying, which must have been terribly in character for him.
"Do you ever get tired of your own voice?" Malfoy demanded once he had faced her again. "Could I possibly get through a single sentence, Granger?"
"We're your friends, Dray," Blaise reminded him, in a tone that suggested Draco may have brain damage.
Some part of his brain was reminding him he should probably be very suspicious about now, but he—strangely—wasn't, and that seemed alarming in itself.
Draco nodded, some of the weight of the past few weeks returned to his shoulders, and stood again. "Suppose I'd better go and find out."
Right, Harry thought. It had never come up. And, he realised, he'd never told any of his Slytherin friends about the Marauders Map either.
“Sure,” replied Joshua. “But I think those aren’t until closer to the end of the week, though. Most wait to try out for Quidditch, usually after they find out they didn’t make their Quodpot team. And then there’s Swivenhodge tryouts on Saturday, for the losers who don’t make either. But those games aren’t much to watch.”
” Draco demanded the next day, just after Harry had sent off the letter to his godfather. He had saved telling Draco about Sirius for last for this very reason.
But he wasn’t given the opportunity to question such a decision further, as the woman grabbed hold of his upper arm and yanked him along with her. He wasn’t able to notice where the other three Aurors had concealed themselves, but he hoped wherever it was would be enough. He and Auror Fleur had ducked behind a large gravestone, the darkness providing extra cover.
This was far from the first time Blaise had obnoxiously made a similar claim, and every previous time that Harry could remember, Neville would make some quip in reply and laugh it off. He fully expected the same to be true now. But then Neville, after releasing a long breath, said, “And what would you do if I was?”
Harry knew this, of course. He had to be aware of the group’s history before he’d signed on as publicist. Chris, Alfie, and Bradley were a few nobodies from Lincolnshire, who’d moved to London and been playing in pubs for roughly three years before Neville—fresh out of Hogwarts and looking to make himself known—responded to a poster they’d put up a few months prior about seeking a lead singer.
Neville's eyes went wide. "You're mental! Filch is still out there and–and Snape'll have my head if I'm caught!"
When Theo didn’t reply, Draco looked back over at him. The other boy looked dangerously contemplative.
“No, Averie is douche’s little sister,” Joshua corrected. “But it doesn’t matter what Matt does anyway, I’m too good, so I’m not going anywhere.”
"He is indeed," Pansy told the green eyed boy. "You should have seen him pitch a fit near beginning of term, your eyes were on Diggory all the bloody time. Draco was nearly impossible to tolerate."
Draco groaned and leaned against the wall. "I'm an awful person," he said, pulling Harry from his incredulous state.
“Help me!” Draco shouted. Harry realised then that Draco likely didn’t know Harry wasn’t actually an Auror.
"Some. It's a riddle, I've got to solve it I guess. But that’s not really what we need to talk about."
When he did awake, he found that someone had brought him to his bed. He was alone in it, but his dad sat, seemingly asleep, in the chair across the room. Draco sat up. “Dad?”
Harry shrugged. “I mean, that’s the gist of it, honestly. I was kind of a wanker the last time we talked. I actually came to apologise.”
The next moment Neville's potion exploded. As he did every day in Snape's class, Neville looked petrified as Snape turned and glared.
At the start of term, the seating arrangements in Potions offended Hermione greatly. She wasn't near the back, of course, but she was nowhere near the front either. She never before had cause to appreciate this fact. But Monday morning, Hermione found herself thinking that her vantage point was rather perfect. Because, while she was not seated in the front, Harry was. And so was Draco Malfoy.
Neville left a short while later, and Hermione began to talk to Draco as she sometimes did. Pansy was always demanding she tell him something or another for her. But whenever Hermione suggested she come along to visit this time, the other girl would refuse. All their friends did. Hermione didn’t blame them for not wanting to see their friend like this. She didn’t like it much either, but someone besides Sirius had to check in on Harry and Narcissa. He had a house to remodel and an entire life to rebuild, after all. Lucius Malfoy surely was not going to take up the responsibility, given that he hadn’t even been seen at St. Mungos since the day Draco was brought in. First it was because of his trial. But now Narcissa insisted it was due to misplaced guilt. Hermione thought that was a worthless excuse, but graciously kept her opinion to herself.
There was an answer to that, one that a few minutes ago, he’d thought himself prepared to give. But now—it was the way Draco said the words that made Harry pause. He had spoken as though that was something he’d been waiting to ask for some time, not something that had only just come to mind and been blurted out.
Lavender laughed like this was an adorable joke instead of a barb. “Good looking and funny,” she said.
is in love with him!” she hollered. “Are you truly so despicable that you would destroy our only son in this way? That you would choose something fickle as status over your own flesh and blood?!”
The female Slytherin huffed, her voice returning to sharpness. "When have I ever lied to you for the sake of your ego?"
Neville shot the dark skinned boy a weary look, seemed to steal himself, and stood up. “Come on.” He sounded nothing more than resigned.
Guess what! This chapter officially makes this my longest fic! I’m so happy to post it, especially since this chapter nearly defeated me with how hard it refused to come together like I wanted it to. But I championed through it eventually, and it’s a bit longer than usual. Hope you guys enjoy :)
Neville was quiet, picking back up on his tapping along to the music. “Okay,” he finally said. “Tell me what we need to do, then.”
“The less you know, the better, alright?” Draco said. He was growing increasingly desperate as the seconds passed. It was already early evening, and Harry could be returning to Gryffindor tower at any moment. If he did, there was no way Draco would get his hands on that cloak before tomorrow.
family think he’d gone mad if he could manage. But if he couldn’t, well… He looked at Hermione a touch desperately. “Right. If I could speak to you, erm, privately, just for a few minutes…? Please.”
Snape sneered at him, and Draco was filled with sudden regret for every time he'd ever sneered at someone himself.
She wrapped her arms around his neck, those treacherous tears gathering in her eyes for the millionth time that afternoon. “When did you get so wise, Draco Malfoy?”
Harry considered telling them all the truth, watching Cosima’s face crumple when he explained how Malfoy really felt about her and those like her, what he’d said. He imagined how they’d all react, the hate they’d start looking at Malfoy with in her defense. In the end, Harry pushed down his anger and shook his head.
Daphne and Dean had spoken a bit of Andrew amongst mentions of their other friends that night at the club, but Harry hadn’t known who everyone was at the time and so had simply rolled with it.
Lavender regarded him for long moments, clearly intending to be unfeeling but not altogether managing it. Harry swallowed against his guilt. It wasn’t his fault, he told himself.
The other two Aurors just nodded dismissively—there was nothing they could do really—and turned their attention back on the cup.
“They probably wanted to,” Harry admitted, deciding he might as well be honest. “But… they cared a lot about their reputations. It was easier for them to just keep me secret. And, well, my aunt wouldn’t have let me
But, since Draco was even less in control of himself than usual, his eyes drifted back to Potter. He nearly jumped when he found those enchanting green eyes already trained on him. They flickered away just then, though, and Draco was reminded of Granger's words in the hallway that day.
He shook it off quickly, though. “Sometimes I forget how foreign you are,” he sighed. “Quodpot is only the greatest sport in the world.”
"—think muggles would burn us to death given half the chance, and so should stay to their own place,” she finished, more confident in her assumptions now. “But anyone who's paid attention to you at all knows you aren't your father, Malfoy."
your son anything, Lucius, is myself. You, on the other hand, will exit the grounds of Hogwarts immediately. And you will not speak to Draco in person unless either myself or the Headmaster is present."
He’d known immediately that it was the right decision to leave, and the hours he’d since spent packing up and clearing out had brought a sense of acute relief. It was almost as if Harim was actively encouraging him, for once.
"Or maybe that's a bit much. But I know that you like him. You're not nearly as subtle as you think you are."
But that was another problem for a different day; right now he had to stop his sister from thinking he had some kind of problem with Dumbledore. Even if he did, just not in a way she’d ever understand.
Again Draco tried to reply, but didn’t do so in time. “Something about you, seemed like,” Hermione answered.
“So,” Neville continued into the mic, “due to some contracts I had to sign, I can’t really play the tracks you all are probably expecting!”
His mother, for her part, was most often in what was designated the study, writing out whatever it was one did when one ran charities.
“Harry!” Lavender cut him off, exasperated with his rambling. “Neville is going to be fine. The band is going to be fine. You’ll sort things with Martha and that Quinton bloke because it’s your job and you’ve done great with it so far. And Rita is just about the last thing to concern yourself with. You ought to be a bit more focused on Draco. You know,
“Wait!” Harry shouted, which at least got her to pause. He hurried to explain, wordlessly turning off the stove and sending the eggs into the fridge with magic. “Please just give me a second. I just forgot what today was, I promise. I
“Unfortunately,” said Draco’s father, “if the Tournament is altered, it is more than likely that the Dark Lord’s plans against Mr. Potter will be as well.”
Hermione giggled and pulled back to smile at him. That was when the door opened again, Pansy’s long black curls swinging inside while she hung onto the handle.
Draco laughed aloud. “Speaking of unobservant,” he said when he’d finished, “you really didn’t know I wanted kids?”
"Yes, well, it's the way it's going to be, apparently." He stood then. "I should turn in for the night."
Harry didn’t have a chance to ask directly what she’d said before Clark arrived, a crate hovering above her head as she passed the crowd of students and they began to follow her towards the woods.
“You didn’t mention you’d be coming by today, dear,” she admonished fondly. “Shamim will be thrilled.”
Something must have gone horribly wrong—or right, if one shared Harry’s point of view that is. This Voldemort couldn’t possibly be a real threat; he didn’t even look capable of doing magic.
“Little Cordelia Gray,” she answered sadly. “She was the one who got her pick of Houses yesterday, hadn’t happened in like forever. And a Nomaj-born, too.”
The continuous sense of déjà vu nearly had Hermione dizzy for days afterward. It was as if Harry's name had come out of Goblet all over again, only completely different. Ron behaved the same, meaning of course that he pretended as though Harry no longer existed, as did the majority of the school, meaning distrustful or offended glances and mumbled insults. Everything was just the same, with the only exception being the near entirety of Slytherin House. Instead of ridiculous badges and hissed insults, the Slytherins now guarded Harry and Malfoy as though they were some sort of royalty.
“You say that like you aren’t one of them,” Neville said, sounding genuinely confused now. “It doesn’t make sense. Since when would you even care about anyone but yourself? This story would have been a goldmine for you.”
“It would be messing with Harim’s head too,” Harry had finished in amazement. “He’s trying to block that off. He doesn’t want to think badly of Draco.”
Later, Draco would tell him what he’d overheard and, thanks to growing up a Malfoy, what it meant. Harry, Hermione and Ron would all agree that the Dark Mark was something they’d have to discuss with Sirius tomorrow. And, with only a sight grimace, Draco would concede.
“You could pick truth instead,” she told him sweetly, her smile revealing nearly every tooth. Not for the first time, Hermione felt a bit wary of the dark haired girl. She thought perhaps Luna was intended to be the innocence to her lawlessness.
“And maybe it’s not different at all,” Ron replied. “We break up for all the same reasons every time.”
So, as some of you already know, I didn’t originally intend for Harry’s career path, or really Neville himself for that matter, to take on quite the size role that is now currently the case. By the time I realized this was more important (for pacing, connecting events, etc.) than I had assumed, it was kind of too late in the process to prioritize accuracy highly in that respect. So I kind of do the best I can, as you can see. All in all, if that whole business in this chapter came off as pure nonsense, I’m sorry. I tried. If it doesn’t phase you: thank goodness.
Draco thought. But he said “I didn’t go about things very well, clearly, but yes, I’ve always wanted him this way. Whether you believe it or not makes no difference to me.” He put his back to the redhead once more and returned to where Harry slept on, oblivious. Draco registered the sound of Weasley leaving a moment later and bent down to kiss Harry’s slightly parted lips.
“I do,” Harry said honestly, just as the music came to its close in the background. “But I also know that I love you. I might be a mess—my mind might be a mess. But I
As usual, Harry had not moved since Hermione left. Neither had Narcissa, though she never moved much at all. Which was why Harry was surprised to see her suddenly look up at the doorway and then rise. When Harry turned and met Dumbledore’s eyes, it made sense.
Draco started. “Cross with—what? No. Oh gods. Do you really think you’re what’s upsetting me right now?”
Harry thought he might be ill, finally understanding the some of the underlying anxiety round campus he’d already begun to feel. If students were being kidnapped so often that no one was even bothering to search for them anymore, of course no one was allowed to roam about by themselves. The need for pairs made a horrifying kind of sense. He was nearly unwilling to ask the next question. “When you said she’d be back…” but he trailed off, unable to finish.
“Scrimgeour showed up,” Hermione told him, clinging onto his arm. He resigned himself and slowed his pace as she spoke. “Your mum convinced him to let the Aurors help. He agreed to use Polyjuice and everything just like I said.”
Harry’s neck snapped towards her so quickly he nearly gave himself whiplash; beside him, Malfoy choked violently on his onion ring.
Except then, before he had time to properly panic, she was bursting into laughter at his pained expression.
He abruptly felt horrible. This was her job, and he had been yammering on ceaselessly about his problems since the very beginning. This conversation alone was enough to showcase how little Harry had learnt about her, in return.
“He said he needed your help with something,” Ginny put in, just the slightest bit too flippant. “Figured we weren’t exactly busy here, so you wouldn’t mind.”
The rush of relief at seeing Vee felt like twenty stone being lifted right off his shoulders. It meant Bill and Fluer had to be just as happy here as they’d been before Harry had changed the past.
“I can’t believe I missed that,” Lavender pouted, though her eyes were sly. “Surely you know you’ll have to take your real friends out now.”
You and Brown have until tomorrow morning to put the Longbottom story on my desk, Skeeter had said. Him and Brown. Lavender was his partner, but she didn’t know what he knew, or she wouldn’t be here.
"Denial is never healthy, Dray. Anyone with half a working eye can see that Diggory is unfairly fit. There's nothing wrong with admitting it."
Draco didn't hesitate to take the offered hand, revisiting another instance of an offered hand in his mind's eye, and they left the nearly silent Great Hall behind them. Draco tried his best to ignore the smug look on Granger's face as they passed her.
to the Headmaster to be dealt with. I doubt I can do so objectively. I will be giving you a zero on this practical, however, in case there was any doubt about it. Now get out of my sight.”
“Obviously I’m going to pick Blaise, since neither you or Harry would truly allow otherwise,” he said, the closest estimation to a hiss any Longbottom had likely ever produced.
The gardens were beautiful and vast, and Harry almost had to resist the urge to ooh and aah with the first time visitors. This was, after all, his family’s estate. Looking out at the endless coloured rows and clusters of all breeds of flower and plant should offer nothing new for him.
Harry had taken a few dark hours to cry at the time, and then he’d gotten back to work to stop himself thinking of it.
“Can’t tell you for sure about Siskin,” said Maria. “I have him too, but it’s the first time. Always had Professor Howe before, but I heard Siskin is good
Blaise was, admittedly, shocked. Mostly at the timing, though. He and Neville had been eyeing each other since their Hogwarts days, after all. But he hadn’t imagined that Nev would admit that any time soon, much less in the middle of a wedding reception.
“Fine, I guess we’ll just move on from that,” Lavender said with a small shake of her head, “but secondly: are we honestly
“I don’t know what you want me to say!” Malfoy exploded. “I’m not going to sit and tell you everything you’d like to hear. I’m certainly not going to
“You shut your mouth!” Lavender cut him off, enraged. “You are really something else today! Throwing accusations at me like I’ve not been your best friend for ten years! Since when have I ever cared about a story more than I care about you?! You’re the one who’s throwing me under the bus right now you bastard!”
But that didn’t seem to be too much of a problem, since Ayesha had become somewhat awkward since they’d told Amjad goodbye. Harry figured he would wait for her to say whatever she was thinking, and started getting the stuff out to resume making himself a now-late breakfast. It had been easy to ignore, but he’d been hungry the entire match.
And she turned abruptly and retreated into the house, clearly expecting him to follow. He hurried after her, awkwardly shutting the door behind him before catching up.
With what Harry recognised as no small amount of irony, he found the blond in the restroom—standing in front of the mirror, his back to Harry. His black jacket was discarded on the ground, his dress shirt a bit loose. When they locked gazes in the mirror, Harry was hit with such a wave of deja vu, it was almost unsettling.
Harry had taken one look at the calendar that morning and fallen into an understandably dark mood, as was the trend for years now. It wasn’t long after that he noticed Harim had made himself quite deliberately scarce.
Draco shook his head back and forth, really only the smallest movement. “Oh Merlin,” he breathed. “I really brushed it off as my imagination.”
Sirius looked awful, incredibly thin in the same clothes they’d last seen him. “Chicken!” he said, voice hoarse.
"Right beside you. We all did. I woke everyone else and they left already, has anyone told you you sleep like the dead?"
His voice was low, dangerous. Harry thought back on his words, quickly realising what the blond must of heard in them. “Hey, don’t. I’m perfectly fine.”
For a moment, the woman simply stared at him. Then, slowly, she lowered her wand. “You’re not a Death Eater,” she said, sounding near incredulous. “You’re just an idiot kid.”
Harry smiled. It had only been a handful of days since he’d settled into his new—old—rooms. Really, it was his own wing; there was plenty of space for practically all of his belongings, so nothing had needed to go into storage. And nothing that had already been there—waiting for him to return, apparently—had even needed to be removed.
And now, as the door before him opened and a smile bloomed across his mother’s face, he was even more certain than he’d been the night before.
This was how Draco had managed to let him back in. Because his aunt, who had frightened Harry into delirium right before his eyes, was a psychopath in this world as well. It was why he hadn’t been anything like insistent, or even visibly curious where Harry would notice. He thought…
thank you to all you guys for being so willing to be patient with the slower updates; it’s way better to sit down and write with that encouragement and understanding.
Draco shook his head. “It wasn’t,” he whispered. “It wasn’t. I wanted—I just don’t know how,” he let out a frustrated sound. “I’m not saying any of this right.”
"I don't know Harry," said Hermione. "It didn't sound like he was very rude to you. And you said he was alone when he asked."
Draco shook his head dismissively. “Right. Let me just sneak into the third task. Why should that be difficult? There’ll only be hundreds of people in the audience and an Auror every ten feet. Piece of cake.”
Harry’s fist moved blindingly quick. He was aware that he could have made this simple, could have pulled his wand and cast any number of awful hexes. But there was nothing so satisfying as the crunch of Malfoy’s nose as it gave to the pressure of Harry’s punch.
“Cosima Taylor, Celine Moore, Anthony Jackson, Emily Hernandez, Tyler Brooks, Jeremy Johnson, and now young Miss Cordelia Gray,” he listed, voice full of an aching regret and responsibility. “I have failed them all.”
Harry knew the smile on his face was something to witness, because Neville laughed merrily at him before reminding him he was meant to follow the rapidly retreating woman.
Sirius’s next response finally came attached to a rather traumatised-looking owl the Friday following the task, and it was nearly as short as the previous one.
It’s just that most never desire to. We enter with an idea of what we seek to learn, and we dedicate our lives to the pursuit of that knowledge. But, much to the disapproval of my superiors, I felt I had already learnt everything I wanted to about the Mind, and I wanted to pursue something else—highly unusual to my colleagues, as well, of course. To them, there is
The brown haired boy rolled his eyes dramatically. “I realise there’s been quite a bit more change this year than usual, but I’m fairly certain you’re not a wuss Draco. I can’t believe you actually went and
"Right, uh. I dare you to... go stand at the top of the Astronomy tower and sing the Hogwarts song as loud as you can."
Harry was sure it suited Reid just fine. She didn’t need anything from Harim’s lifetime, and so the black hole where Harim typically dwelled had been unlikely to register with her.
“It seemed losing his sovereign cost him what remaining sanity he had,” answered Dumbledore. “He attempted to murder your double just following the battle, still under the impression he was you.”
That evening, Draco still sat in the library across from Hermione, searching through a useless book about eggs, when Pyxis—his family owl—approached. That was odd, since his mother's letters usually came at dinner. When he opened this particular letter, however, he understood that this couldn't have waited until dinner.
Draco looked at him for a moment. "Sometimes I still can't believe this is real," he told Harry quietly. "You don't know how long I—you can't know what it was like."
Harry had furrowed his brows, and she’d taken this as an invitation to go on. “You’ve had unpleasant experiences with both legilimency and occlumency in the past, yes? Therefore, you’ve cultivated a distaste with regards to both forms of mind magick—and likely maintain fundamental misunderstandings of how each of them work. Harim, however, seems to have a very different opinion. I’d wager he was trained earlier, and with significantly better effectiveness. If his staggering talent is anything to go by, at least.”
There were several gasps at this, and he knew that everyone in Gryffindor knew or would know by morning what had just happened. He sulked towards his dorm room, meeting several wide eyes in the hall on his way, and tossed himself down on the bed, wishing for an entirely different bed down beneath the castle.
"Alright, he's not staring, really," Draco allowed, as the Hufflepuff had looked away for possibly the fourth time. "But he's putting me on edge."
"It wasn't necessary, Panse," Draco said. "You would have just been one more nervous person who might've given me away before I made it back."
Draco’s smile dropped entirely now, a scowl forming. Weasley hadn’t been a prat in a while, there was no reason to be now. “Yes, how lovely of you to rub it in.”
It didn’t seem long before Bagman—who, as far as Draco knew, had no idea what was actually going on—was shouting, “Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin!”
made at fourteen, Lucius?" Severus asked, venom nearly dripping off his voice in defence of the young boy.
“Someone gave you to them!” Draco said angrily, his eyes shimmering as if he were forcing back tears. “Let them treat you like a bloody house elf your entire life!”
Harry released a deep sigh, exasperated and guilty at once. If he were honest, he hadn’t thought about his mission to help Neville since he’d last seen him. It had simply gotten buried beneath everything else that was going on, just as he’d hoped it wouldn’t. Which meant, of course, that he really had nothing to offer the man.
Harry deeply wished it didn’t feel so much like he was lying. The further he got from Draco, the easier it was to say those things. But it wasn’t necessarily going to convince.
"Please, it's fine Draco. The whole school's thought Luna mad since she stepped foot in the castle, you weren't the only one. Not like with Potter."
She pursed her lips. “I’m honestly not sure what more there is for me to tell you, Harry,” she admitted. “You’re progressing. You’ve taken pains to reconnect with your family, and you’re willingly spending time with your friends—when every time before you were rather adamant that they were Harim’s and not yours. I think you’re beginning to soften towards your counterpart, maybe even enough to cooperate with his wishes. On top of that, you’ve told arguably the most important person in your life the truth. However he might have taken it, that is a glaring indication that matters are beginning to resolve themselves within you. I might even dare to say that I’ll soon be free to end my tenure, yet.” Then she sighed. “Were it not for the fact of your continued, willful separation from Harim.”
The Aurors who were taking place of Cedric, Fleur and Viktor had already transformed. When Harry had thought to ask, Scrimgeour—the somewhat intimidating Head Auror—had told him that the other Champions had been slipped a strong sleeping potion during dinner last night and secured elsewhere.
Neville paled, looking round at the company and realizing his very limited options at the same time Blaise did, judging by the appearance of his devilish grin. “In front of everyone?” Neville squeaked.
were everywhere—he should know, seeing as he'd been one—and Harry had been front page worthy many times before. Now that everyone knew he and Draco were bent? Yes, everyone knew. Absolutely everyone. And Draco wasn't the least bit bothered by it. Or he wouldn't have been, if everyone didn't very much include his parents.
“But what about—all the rest of it?” he blurted. Not everything was about the state of Harry’s mind, here.
Harry couldn’t breathe for a moment. All he could picture was Draco on his knees before Lucius, cut off,
and, in fact, even younger than him didn’t help his case at all. Because, of course, Harry had faced the Dark Lord before—and wasn’t
Alright so, I clearly took a lot of liberties with the explanation here, but I had to have one. I just couldn't picture Harry ever being willing to kill a little kid; we can't all be as pragmatic as James Rhodes. (If you understand that I love you in particular lol). Anyway, this chapter was quite a bit longer than the last; the chapter length will probably vary a lot throughout the story so strap in. Comments are loved of course.
to Draco that he found a contentment he’d of never imagined could be had. Telling Draco anything he was thinking at any given time and knowing no judgement would come as a result, that was something unexpectedly gratifying. They’d been together well over five months now, and Draco knew nearly everything about Harry. His reaction to the dementors as well as the incredible pain he felt in his scar at times—the latter of which Draco had the misfortune of witnessing first hand recently, in class no less—being a few examples.
She was Hermione, somewhere deep down, surely. Different world or no, it was something Harry was beginning to need to believe.
Harry watched Malfoy’s face as he spoke, and decided that enduring that awful conversation with Dumbledore this passed summer had been worth it just for this. He knew things about Tom Riddle that he’d never wanted to know, never asked to know. But Dumbledore had sat him down, his usually sparkling eyes sombre as he explained in grave detail how Voldemort had become who he’d been and why, and what Harry had had to do with it.
He sagged with relief when he caught sight of Harry, and Harry tried not to grimace at his obvious hope. Harry slid into Neville’s booth. “What did you do?”
come for Harry. They wouldn’t have known that the Dark Lord needed Harry in order to rise again at all.
Later, when the embarrassing tears had dried on his face and he lay with his head in Pansy’s lap, he realized that his friends probably had no idea what he and Harry were fighting about. Blaise and Greg had clearly heard enough to put it all together, but they couldn’t know all the specifics. And Pansy had to know less than nothing. Yet they’d been here for him anyway. He thought of Harry—not that he’d stopped—and hoped, despite his hurt and anger, that Hermione and Weasley were doing the same.
“You are the reason our son has never learned to control himself,” he said, calmly wiping saliva from his face.
Typically, Harry returned to sleep—and the majority of other times had found himself various places to be, without it even being a deliberate choice to do it.
Everything got rather loud after that, as well. Most of the Weasley brothers were clearly ribbing after Fred, who had a wide smile on his face despite the shaky atmosphere.
It was some minutes before she pulled away, clearing her throat. Still, she seemed to be cautiously hopeful as she was leaving. Harry thought that maybe fixing things wasn’t so impossible a task after all.
fashion, Slytherin House threw a party in the dungeons. Or more like Pansy threw a party, and it seemed to Draco like half of Hogwarts showed up. He noticed Diggory and Krum around more than once, both of them clinging to Chang and Hermione practically the same way Harry was to Draco. Harry hadn't released Draco's hand all day since the task, claiming the memory of Draco's unconscious body tied to an underwater statue was still too fresh in his mind. Draco wasn't about to complain.
And now they were all alive, and he was just supposed to greet them with smiles and clap them on their backs like they’d just seen each other last month for tea and it was all perfectly normal. He’d been a complete idiot to think he could manage to act so well. If he saw Sirius and he
“They’re not in the maze,” one said a minute later, after casting the spell required to locate the Aurors. They were supposed to of been tracing every ten minutes or so, but as the task went on Harry knew they’d done so less regularly. He thought the last time must have been over twenty minutes ago.
He went into a spiel then about current standing, and before long the Auror who wore Krum’s face was entering the maze. Draco took a deep breath and, as soon as it opened in front of Auror Fleur, he ran inside.
Harry walked slowly towards the dungeons, needing to talk to Draco more than ever about the million questions firing through his head about Crouch and Snape and everything else. He knew, also, that it was probably a good idea to write to Sirius about the night’s occurrences. Harry hadn’t heard anything from his godfather since Christmas morning when he’d opened his gift, not even throughout the spectacle that was himself and Draco becoming a couple. If he was honest with himself, Harry was just the slightest bit worried about what Sirius had been thinking about him—he’d been doing his best not to consider the worst.
, thought Harry. He snatched up the stone Krum had left behind and went towards the child, pointing his wand at the merpeople that tried to get in his way and making the threat clear. Amazingly, they actually backed off, and Harry set to releasing the girl. Clock ticking in his mind, he grabbed her about the waist, took hold of Draco's arm and began to swim toward the surface with all his might.
“I destroyed it,” he told her, looking her straight in the eye. “I destroyed all of it. Every picture I had. Every story I’ve written. I realise that plenty of them have been out in the world for a long time and I can’t take them back, but I can certainly not add to it.”
Some part of him was sure that he would have opened his mouth right then, would have spoke the truth into the air, would have risked it.
Keeping my child from me?! You’re a disgrace to have stooped so low!” She spat at him with the full force of her rage.
Cosima nodded, giving him a sad smile as if she’d realised what it cost him to ask. “Not all of us do, though,” she admitted. “They let the Taken stay and go to the specialized classes for the magically sensitive, hoping our magic will come back someday. But… some of us don’t bother. Last we heard, Anthony goes to no-maj law school now.”
"People haven't been looking at us quite so much anymore," Draco said. "It's been dying down. Yet Diggory just glanced over at you
He tried asking one of the mermen for a spear, but that didn't go over well. Finally he dove for one of the jagged rocks at the lake's bottom, swam up and began hacking at the ropes holding Draco. What felt like an eon later, they came apart and Draco floated free. Harry looked around—there was no sign of any of the other champions, and he was at once worried and frustrated. The hour was nearly up—what if they never came for the other hostages? What if they ran out of time? The words he'd heard sung earlier came back to his mind:
“Does Mr. Potter not have the right to decide whether to fight for himself?” Lucius interjected, staring at Harry oddly.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry said once he was face to face with the git. Only after he spoke the words did he notice Malfoy was, strangely, alone. Suspicion had Harry clutching his wand, though he didn't yet draw it out. Better to know what Malfoy was up to before he started firing off hexes. The rest of the school had just barely begun to forgive him, and it had taken near death to do it. He wasn't going to start losing House points on top of everything else.
"Right um, are the stories about your mum true? No offence," he added hastily. Hermione wouldn’t have found this line of questioning odd, it was natural to be curious about Veela heritage, and Blaise’s mum was quite infamous, but the look on Neville’s face was making her second guess it. She shook her head in an attempt to clear it.
Harry nodded. “And then Theo comes in and tells me he practically sent you in there himself, and I—I accused him of... well. It was wrong, I know. I’ve told him that I was sorry, that I know he wasn’t responsible or anything. But he still... you know.”
Pansy had been right about the press, of course. Cameras were everywhere, and the sound of so many in the audience was perhaps even more deafening than it was the first time Harry had done this. He appreciated Greg and Vince keeping everyone at arm’s length, he was nervous enough without everyone clustering around him. But, inevitably, they all had to deposit him with the other champions and leave him alone.
purebloods in America, it has to be worse for her. And me, I… well I only had it for a little while right? Shouldn’t be such a big deal, but…”
The chances that Draco really would come that night were slim, Harry was well aware. For all the reasons Harry almost hadn’t invited him to begin with.
, while we’re at it, are a threat to us too, more so in some ways. Have you ever thought about how much faith we place in them? I know you grew up with muggles, Potter, did they love you?”
Draco knew he'd love to spend today in much the same fashion. But gods, he'd snogged Harry Potter in front of most of Hogwarts—there was no way the entire Wizarding World wouldn't know by now. Spies for the bloody
It was the wrong thing to say, apparently. Malfoy stepped in close, eyes flashing at the challenge in Harry’s tone. “I must say it’s a shame Granger doesn’t go to this school,” he taunted.
“See there’s this friend of mine and, well, I’ll spare you the details. But this is sort of for him, actually,” he said, and Harry paused, looking up at Neville with wide eyes.
Quietly, Draco’s mum left the room. The white haired wizard conjured a chair next to Harry’s and sat down in it without speaking. Then he reached over and placed something in Harry’s lap.
Not in a fit state of mind to do any travel magic, Harry had left Lavender’s flat the muggle way—his movements robotic, mind in a whirl as he’d shut the front door and walked down a flight of stairs to the first level before he’d come to a stop.
was going to be at the wedding, being Fred’s brother and all. It was just too strange to think on for very long.
"Malfoy's asked Harry to the Yule Ball," Hermione said promptly, in the same matter-of-fact tone she would use to remind Ron that they had potions homework due tomorrow.
The last thing Harry wanted to discuss was the row he’d just had with Draco. He held up his hand against any questions and headed toward his room. Seamus looked up when he came in, and Harry pretended not to notice his surprise. He simply went over to the bed he’d not slept in for weeks and closed his curtains.
“I probably shouldn’t of said that, right?” Neville sighed after a long, quiet moment. He sounded completely resigned.
“Me and Cel were just a couple of little girls,” Cosima explained, “but Anthony was this educated sixth year. So when everything happened just the same, big search parties and super strict curfews and the whole damn works turned up nothing until he just stumbled right into the Great Hall on Christmas, suddenly a Squib just like us…”
And then the little girl was back, giving him a hug and telling him thank you. Fleur was waiting when her sister pulled away.
Draco blinked, his surroundings coming back into focus as he looked up at Hermione. She eyed him worriedly.
“Anywhere!” yelled the blond. “You could have gone anywhere! The entire wizarding world would’ve given the skin off their backs to raise you after what you did! Instead you got dropped with those wretches who—gods Harry. You slept in a bleeding cupboard!”
And perhaps it was that some small part of Harry, the part that had so secretly wanted that type of all consuming, awe-inspiring love story, had not put up enough of a fight.
“That’s Matthew,” said Maria as she slid in to his right, confirming Harry’s suspicions. “They’re always going at it because once upon a time Matt wanted to fuck and Josh didn’t.”
At that, her mouth opened into a small ‘o’ of surprise, face slacking somewhat. “Harry,” she said slowly, her voice softened considerably. “Is something going on?”
In the middle of the field, the grass was wild; it came up tall, Harry’s fingers grazing the tops of shifting blades as he made his way steadily toward the Burrow. The closer he got, the more he could hear. A window or several might have been open, as Harry picked up the chatter of many voices and their intermittent, easy laughter carried on the wind.
"Do please get a hold of yourself Granger!" Snape demanded. "Twenty points from Gryffindor for this absolutely unnecessary display!"
her pawn,” Harry hissed, familiar hatred rushing through him with such ferocity he felt almost lightheaded.
“It’s not like that!” Neville exploded, and then looked around in momentary horror before realising he, in fact, couldn’t be heard. He took a deep breath. “They have an open marriage, okay? Kelsey’s known about us all along and she doesn’t care because now Blaise’s dad is dead they’re going to get a divorce as soon as their marriage contract is up, anyway. Seven months. I’m not some side piece. He loves me.”
“I’ve got to stay to let in any other guests,” Remus said, “but I’ll see you when the match starts.”
best friend, and tell her everything while you’re at it. I’m sure she’ll take you right in, believe you straight away. Surely won’t think that you’re a nutter at all. Because she’s
The Auror shook her head, exasperated. “Unbelievable. So not only do I have to pretend to compete—and therefore actually compete—in some bloody death tournament that I didn’t sign up for, but now I’ve got to babysit while I do it? How you even got in here is another concern entirely, so much for the stellar security.”
“Look at it this way,” Edgar said easily, “most people aren’t pieces of shit, especially not Healers. Believe me, if you study for that long to be able to help people, you don’t care who they are. Unless you’re fucked in the head. All’s I’m saying is that even if this law gets passed, which it won’t, than the chance anyone actually uses it is crazy unlikely. Like, not gonna happen.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Ah, but we’re free spirits by choice dear,” she reminded him, eyeing a certain blonde across the room.
"Bloody Potter!" Draco exclaimed, smashing his fist against the wall and swallowing the consequent cry of pain. Pansy and Blaise sat silently, their expressions identical mixes of annoyance and dismay.
“We’ll tell you that story another day,” she said dismissively. “Right now what you need to understand is that Sirius Black is not, nor has he ever been, a Death Eater. He was framed by Peter Pettigrew—”
Sheila heaved a sigh. “Oh, Harry. It will be alright. I see now that I have allowed you to retain your misunderstandings, to your detriment. I had hoped that you would eventually see on your own, and I would not have to be so direct.”
It was a common thing to refer to Draco Malfoy as the Prince of Slytherin, but Hermione had not quite guessed at how literal this could be taken until she'd found herself sat next to Harry in the Slytherin common room yet again. Harry was now surrounded by Slytherins at any given time, so, when night would fall and they naturally congregated towards their common room, Harry tended to follow, leaving Hermione to decide whether or not she would go along too. For the third night in a row, she had.
really. The twins and their younger sister simply entered as everyone else had, noticing their friends—one of which being Luna—and wearing ever-present smiles. Harry only reacted when, not minutes later, Ron Weasley appeared as well. The hand around Draco's tightened a bit, the only sign of Harry's apprehension as the youngest male Weasley made his way directly over to them, looking nervous but determined.
"The fact that it is Potter only makes it worse! That boy ruined everything before he'd even learned to talk! And now the entirety of the Wizarding World knows that he's had his
Harry, who’s head was on Draco’s chest at the time, looked up at him through his lashes. Draco realised he’d likely been nearly asleep.
Pansy and Luna, whose relationship had recently progressed to becoming an official couple and was holding steadier than Draco could admit he expected, were nothing short of the life of the party. For once no one leered or acted as though this was any sort of problem.
"They said—I mean I heard that they took the person you care about the most. For the task, earlier," said Ron.
Nearly everyone politely ignored Neville’s violent blush, but Pansy released a short cackle seemingly before she could stop herself. “Your turn Neville,” she reminded him joyfully.
Draco couldn't be certain what Harry would have said, but he made the decision for him. He pulled his hand from Harry's. "I'll leave you be for a while," he said, pecked Harry quickly on the lips and then walked swiftly away before he could do something stupid like glare at Weasley and be the root cause of another scene. Luckily he found himself a drink rather quickly, courtesy of Blaise.
Harry’s hands were clenched in fists. He wanted to find Zabini and bash his face in, even all these weeks later. But instead, he took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. When he spoke, he sounded collected. “What’s happening now, apparently, is that you’re self-fulfilling a shite prophecy. Yes, Alfie and the rest of them are arseholes who probably never cared about you past what your voice could offer them,” Harry admitted frankly. “And yeah, you fell in love with a selfish prick who didn’t want you to reach your full potential. But it’s all just baggage, and it’s holding you back. None of them at the label know what’s best for you, either, believe me,” he scoffed.
“What’s that look?” the blond in question asked, breaking Harry from his reminiscing. He was playing idly with the fingers of Harry’s left hand.
the tension bleeding from his friend’s shoulders. This was his element, Harry thought not for the first time. He loved this. And Harry knew personally that Neville hadn’t been certain that he’d get it back.
Hey all! I hope you liked the chapter; I’ve been saying for a while now that Draco will become more centric soon, and that time is finally getting started. I honestly am excited.
Harry wished he could punch his former self in the face. “I’ve been an arse,” said Harry, “and I want to try to make it right. All I want is for you to sit back down and let me help you.”
“Not that this isn’t adorable,” Blaise eventually said. “But choose someone else before I get bored.”
The moment broke when five sets of hands started clapping. The two boys untangled themselves instantly; Harry could feel the tips of his ears burning.
“All right everyone,” he said. “My time’s about up, and then I’ll have to make way for the people you all
“Merlin, is it too much to ask that you just put yourself first for once?!” Draco demanded, wincing at the hurt so plain in his voice.
Malfoy gave him a look that said ‘why do you think,’ and Harry rolled his eyes. “Of course,” he scoffed. “So what do you normally do? I probably would have stayed with Cosima.”
His father had made certain Draco could hold his liquor quite young for social reasons, but he was a ways past pleasantly buzzed by the time he realized Potter and Weasley were sitting at their table, clearly sulking, the Patil twins nowhere to be seen. The weasel was glowering in Granger's direction, though she seemed entirely too delighted being in the arms of Viktor Krum to notice—and wasn't that unexpected. Who knew Granger had taste?
Ron chose that exact moment to join them. Normally he was content as he always was after dinner, nothing cheered Ron so much as a good meal. But today he was clearly startled to find what looked like Harry shouting at Hermione from across the sofa.
The blond parted his lips, then closed them again and swallowed. Hermione sprang out of her seat and ran to get him a glass of water from the sink. Some part of her was still surprised when, once she returned, he was still looking at her. Awake. Actually awake.
Parvati gave him a sympathetic look. “She should be back soon. I can clear out for a bit if you like?”
“You lot had best get back to school,” Sirius said, getting to his feet. “Now listen...” He looked particularly hard at Harry. “I don’t want any of you sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.”
Narcissa Malfoy crossed the floor in a flash and slapped her husband across the face. “Don’t you dare lie to me you
He was already in the process of fully denying having heard that voice just then. Because the comment couldn’t truly have been…
"I... I've been a bloody arse. I know that now. And after this morning I—I needed to tell you I was sorry." He looked down at the floor. "I miss us being friends."
Your kudos and especially the comments really mean the most to me. 800 kudos now; thank you all so much!!
“I believe so master,” another unfamiliar voice replied somewhat fearfully. “The portkey has been used.”
“It’s just makeup, dear,” Pansy said with a delight that did not match the statement itself. She clearly knew perfectly well what she’d accomplished, and was rather smug about it. She leant in to mock-whisper in Harry’s ear, seeing as everyone could hear. “They’re gaping because you look sexy, love. I think Draco’s even sweating a bit.”
you know?” Maria didn’t sound particularly comforted, however. Harry could sympathise. In light of it all, pairs seemed rather perfunctory and passive.
Draco answered that by kissing him. "Yeah," he breathed when he pulled away. Harry shivered, and then they were kissing again.
But now it all made sense. Harry was still staring at him, fear and hope mingled in his eyes, a more vivid green then the nightmares had ever managed to produce. That this was really happening struck him once again, knocking the wind out of him for a moment.
A voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like Hermione asked him what in the everloving hell he was doing, but he ignored it. If Harry got to toss himself into dangerous situations for the sake of protecting everyone under the bloody sun, then he had every right to do so to protect Harry.
The last thing Harry wanted to talk about at the moment was Dudley Dursley. He mentally cursed himself for bringing the piglet of a boy up. He hadn’t considered that Draco would ask questions, which was unbelievably dim in retrospect. “You could say that.”
It was Draco’s father that spoke. “How is none of your concern,” he paused as his wife’s elbow met his ribs with a stern look. He continued smoothly, though, as if nothing had happened. “What is important is when, which will be during Potter’s final task.”
Surprise!! I hope no one minds the surprise update! There is an actual reason I am posting this early: I wrote this chapter and the next one in tandem with each other, because this one is actually built into the next but it’s—as you can see—long. Inserting it all in the exact section where it technically belonged didn’t read well and was more disruptive than anything. So after some discussion, it was decided that this be split off and posted as something of an interlude chapter/enhancer for the one following.
Harry wasn’t aware that that was… done. He supposed that there probably weren’t rules against retiring. But Sheila had seemed a ways off from that.
The older Malfoy glanced away; Draco thought he must have imagined the flash of regret on his father’s face.
Hermione had quietly stood up and turned to leave, preparing to give them some time and go contact Narcissa, when Draco’s voice stopped her in her tracks.
With the third task approaching in just days over a week, Harry had found far more comfort sleeping alongside Draco in the cool dungeons than ever before. Being with Draco at night helped keep the horrid nightmares of mazes and Death Eaters and warnings of Voldemort’s growing strength at bay, replacing it all instead with warm fantasies of green ties and slow dancing, the scent of vanilla mint and ice lingering in his dreams.
Harry shifted his gaze to her couch cushion, and then to the small island countertop just over her shoulder. “And then, nothing,” he replied. “I’ve been busy. I just had a meeting today with Martha and Quinton. Martha is demanding that the band finish the single they’ve been dragging their feet on within the next four days, or she’s going to hire someone to do it for them. But Neville isn’t going to stand for that—they write their own tracks or they don’t perform. And
And then he took Draco's hand. The Slytherin swallowed his gasp of shock. He'd asked, but he may as well have been pissed to of done so. Potter was completely sober, had likely been so all his years. Afraid Potter would change his mind and sit back down, he quickly dragged him onto the floor.
Suddenly fed up, Harry stood from his mattress and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s bed curtains, immediately tossing them aside unthinkingly. It wasn’t until after the fact that he realised that the blond might not of been decent, and firmly pushed the wandering thought from his mind in the same instant.
have even succumbed to the strength of it, in a way. But if, in another life, your feelings with regards to Mr. Malfoy were less than pleasant…”
“What’s Quodpot?” Harry inquired, and Joshua stilled, gaping at Harry in a manner so unlike him that Harry almost sniggered.
Cedric, however, didn't appear to notice anything amiss. "Listen... I still owe you one for telling me about the dragons. Would have told you sooner but you've been... anyway. About the golden egg, does yours wail when you open it?"
And suddenly Hermione could no longer retain the calm she'd painstakingly clung to since Monday. "You are both insufferable!" she screeched, and Malfoy flinched in surprise. "Only look at each other when the other looks away—how the bloody hell do you even
Hermione would marry Viktor soon. In just minutes, in fact. There weren’t too many people here to witness it. They hadn’t wanted to risk the press making an appearance, so the guest list had been narrowed down to family and closest friends. One of which had just opened the door and shut it softly behind him.
Hermione didn’t say another word, but Draco could tell she was extremely pleased to have been taken seriously. He was rather proud of her, especially if this kept Harry out of danger.
A look at the man was enough to be sure, as the family resemblance to his older brother was strong. Harry greeted him like they were old friends, and hoped he wasn’t too stiff about it.
He avoided having his eyes on Ophelia for too long, and instead smiled in welcome at Daphne, Dean, and another man Harry hadn’t yet met in this life.
"Got lost!" The Hufflepuff mouthed, looking rather panicked, and then proceeded to pull out a knife and cut at the ropes binding Cho. She came free a lot quicker than Harry was able to release Draco, and Cedric grabbed hold of her and began swimming away.
The blond put a hand on her shoulder and gently turned her so that she was facing him. She looked up into his unusually serious grey eyes.
But Malfoy only nodded, flippant, his expression unchanged as he kept his eyes on the professor. “Unfortunate, that.”
. Draco had not been pleased to discover that Harry had not figured out anything regarding what was expected of him, and had insisted that they begin trying to decipher it immediately. Harry had tried to warn Draco, asked him to get ear plugs or something to serve as proper ear protection, but the blond had waved him off.
Harry laughed, delighted. “You better tell him that,” he ordered, “just the way you said it. He’ll love it.”
. The git that tries to ruin our lives on a daily basis! Who called 'Mione a mudblood every chance he got! Who passed out badges telling everyone that—"
“You!” Draco shouted suddenly, startling Harry just a little. “I noticed, dammit. Every September you’d always come back just a bit too thin. Dark circles—gods. I noticed. And I made
"I didn't really know how much you had to drink," Harry explained, shrugging. "I couldn't be totally sure..."
Which, he understood now, as he stood in his tux, abandoned in the centre of the floor at Hermione’s wedding, was outrageously naive.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly. "Whatever, I'm his boyfriend. I'm allowed to be a sap when it comes to him."
Harry dropped his gaze. Slowly, infinitely careful, Harry took Draco’s left hand. Then, before his mind could catch up, he gently began to lift the sleeve of Draco’s shirt, baring his forearm to the space between them.
Harry’s mind kicked into overdrive. Peter couldn’t die, he needed to testify. He needed to be alive to prove Sirius didn’t kill him. “Help!” he shouted out without thinking.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said automatically, wincing. He noticed belatedly that Victoire had wandered back inside. “I’m- look. I really regret all of that, all of it, and I would appreciate the chance to prove it to you eventually. I don’t work for Skeeter anymore,” he added, already weary of saying these things again and again. “But right now it’s really important that I find Hermione Granger. I need her help with… a lot of things. Is there anything I could say to get you to tell me where I could find her?”
For her part, Victoire had relaxed almost immediately upon him calling her by her name—as a four year old with a near-endless number of family members whom she couldn’t possibly keep track of remembering was liable to do.
The Slytherin seemed to recoil, but Harry must have imagined it. There was no way for shame to have just flashed through those eyes.
Anyway, there’s only one more regular chapter before the epilogue! I will probably post those on back to back days. Oh my god. I just can’t believe it’s almost finished. Come cry with me in the comments.
“Might wanna get your girlfriend out of here at some point, mate,” Harry heard Ron suggest lightly from behind him. Instinctively, he turned—deja vu making him forget that Ron wouldn’t have any reason to be referring to him—and found the red-head elbowing Cedric in the side, because that was the reality.
Draco rolled his eyes. That hardly mattered. "A fair bit," he admitted. "Will you dance with me or not?"
He stared intently at the blond, using all his willpower to get him to look up. No such thing happened. Harry huffed. “Draco, can you at least look at me?”
She turned away from her husband then, off in the direction of the study, but halted in her tracks when Lucius said, “Your beloved son. Even when he has not contacted you in months?”
“I destroyed them,” Harry explained, dismissive. “It’s ashes. But that’s not the point. If I could find out, if I could have taken that many pictures, then someone else could too. My quitting isn’t going to stall Skeeter for long. And if you don’t stop, or at least start being more discreet, you’re going to get found out by someone who will actually run with it. You’re on top of the world right now; we all know you’re this close to hitting the muggle charts, even. But you’re not going to be everyone’s favourite rock star anymore if you let yourself be painted as a home-wrecking whore.”
Hermione tried not to show how caught off guard she was by the casual compliment. "W–well I'd like to think so at least."
His sister had evidently been satisfied with that response, though, because she didn’t seem to notice anything amiss. Her eyes were busy scanning the quidditch stands for a place to sit. She must have found one, because she gestured for Harry to follow her up. The majority of the crowd were students, with only a few adults—probably mostly faculty—scattered within. Harry was eventually caught up in his surroundings. The closer to the start of the match, the more students filled the stands. It was clear there were significantly more than there’d been when Harry had gone to Hogwarts, in the other world. There was also the nostalgia of watching quidditch, hoping your house would win out.
Draco was mildly hungover, but the memories of the Ball were still clear in his mind. He'd asked for a dance, and he'd gotten that and more. He remembered every kiss vividly, and he could recall the way they'd sat, Harry resting against his shoulder as they talked for hours afterwards...
She grinned at him mischievously. “Slytherin. Try not to be too disappointed when baby brother wipes the floor with your house, yeah?”
Sirius slapped his free hand to his chest dramatically. “Harmless? I’m wounded. I’ll have you know that I’m still a very capable wizard.”
Now: wherever you all are in the world, please please be safe. Stay home if you can. Be careful if you can’t. Make good decisions and think of others when you do. As always, much love and thank you so much for reading xx
So the story goes, way back in the summer, whilst outlining this fic, I was actually in the midst of watching season 6 of The 100 as it aired—that CW show I’m sure some of you have at least heard of. (And if you watch it, you’re probably starting to work out exactly how that little kernel is coming out to play sort of, amongst other things soon to come... *wink wink* lol.) Basically, I was pretty excited to get to this point, so please let me know what you guys think. Love it, hate it? Do tell me why, won’t you. I did so miss this.
Draco simply nodded mutely. He had no way of knowing personally what sorts of things were expected of senior Aurors in the field, so he couldn’t argue no matter how stupid he thought it sounded. They’d just been illegally transported from Hogwarts grounds to a graveyard in the middle of nowhere and that wasn’t crime enough?
“—fist fighting like a couple of cavemen!” Clark was yelling in the background. “Can’t even say I’m surprised, the two of you have been trouble since minute one!”
A cry tore its way out of Harry’s throat as Draco’s neck snapped backwards, his grey eyes rolling back into his skull before his body fell to the ground.
Part of Harry still didn’t believe he’d be watching Hermione get married just days from now. It had been a long time since he’d imagined that was something he’d ever actually witness, nevermind that this was an entirely different groom. And, Godric, but
. It made Hermione wonder for possibly the millionth time how they had gotten to this place, a place in which the blond who once tormented her would enter the library and sit right down beside her, positively beaming. And she would be, not wary, but relieved, even glad. Because there was only one reason Draco would be smiling at such a stressful time as this: when he'd solved the problem.
“You are an arsehole, Harry Potter,” Lavender told him, the crack in her voice barely perceptible, but heard all the same. “An obnoxious bellend! Which is disgustingly ironic, since you clearly fancy yourself so much the better person. I’m not your friend?! I’m not sure who the bleeding fuck has been there for you every minute since the start of this thing, then. For all I really could know, you got rid of the man who’s been one of my closest friends since I was fifteen. And yet I’ve still been here. Doing my damndest trying to help you from the moment you confided in me. Dealing with your outrageous stubbornness and your complete unwillingness to help yourself! And it means nothing does it?! The last months don’t count, because I was
He related all this to Sheila, who hummed. “And Draco?” she asked, seeming to brush away Harry’s joviality. “I assume you’ve not heard from him since your confessional.”
"Herm-own-ninny," Viktor called over to them before Harry could think of anything to say. "'Ze scores!"
Hermione gave Neville a long look, and then reached out to take Draco’s cold hand. “I suppose you’re right.”
had been falling in love for the first real time. Not when this was so infinitely special. He told himself he wouldn’t care if Draco thought he was insane, or wanted him on truth serum, or whatever he would think, just as long as he didn’t think it was a game.
And you know it’s true. They call us demons; every single time we’ve revealed ourselves, we get murdered in droves. Because muggles can’t be trusted. And mud–
Draco Malfoy thought he could very well develop an ulcer what with the amount of stress he was dealing with. It had only taken a few days for himself, Harry, and Hermione to work out the meaning of the golden egg’s riddle and realise what needed to be done. The problem was managing it, and they were nearly out of time.
The Slytherin stared at him for a long moment before he finally spoke. “Me, I suppose.” The words were quiet and uncertain, enough that it made Harry’s heart beat faster.
Please note: my estimate from before was definitely off. There is still so much to get to! Basically I’m going to just stop estimating and strap in. If we cross 100k, I hope no one has an issue with that...
"You're mental," said Ron. "Malfoy's a bloke, and he hates Harry. He's got to be up to something. Right?"
"Of course not," he snapped, looking at his friend at last. "That's just my father's way of saying that he'll now be intercepting any letters sent to her and any she might send to me. My mother's already assured me that she accepts me, this is purely Lucius."
“I feel the need to apologise for the severity of my colleagues’ ambition,” she’d said, gently sympathetic. “Reid, in particular, has never been one to delay for the sake of others’ comfort.”
And so, as someone who has gotten to know you well enough to care for you genuinely, I will say that this is no longer a suggestion, it is an order—one that I make despite your discomfort and your pride, for the sake of your well being: merge. You should not go on this way, and you don’t have to.”
“Hm, indeed. But,” she’d countered, “he has deliberately withheld the bulk of his memory base from you, has he not? He has even offered some to you at will. That speaks to complicated mind magick, keeping oneself confined to a certain amount of mindspace, if you will.”
“I think,” she’d began, “the source of the pain—the headaches and nausea you feel, is an almost direct result of your intense dislike for mind magicks when compared to your counterpart.”
Hermione raised her eyebrow, and didn’t attempt to hide pleasant surprise in knowing she had a potential companion in her campaign. However, it would be a topic for a later date as she responded to his last statement.
“Well my best friend is this really smart muggleborn,” he said into her shoulder. “She’s a genius really.”
But she dispelled him of his notions immediately. “No, Harry,” she promised. “The opposite, in fact. See, I was waiting for something. At my wits end with the stagnation. Knowledge, it turns out, is useless with nothing to apply it to. And then, like a gift, there was you. A perfect riddle, tailored just for me. A combination of both of my life-long pursuits—Mind and Time. Talking to you and helping you, Harry, has been… I cannot describe it. It has fascinated me, more than you have realised, perhaps. Once we finish here, I believe I will have fulfilled what I was meant to.”
Harry and Hermione exchanged a glance, thinking for a moment of time turners and wings. Hermione shook it off first.
That was, quite honestly, the first time Draco thought to ask. “Exactly how long was I… out of commision?”
The blond looked at him, his eyes hardened. “Why wouldn’t it be? No bodies. Really, I almost admire the culprit,” sneered the Slytherin. “Going about setting the universe to rights without leaving such a mess behind.”
Hermione beamed at her, she could feel herself blush again. “Thank you, Panse. Tell my Dad I’ll be right out.”
"The highest compliment," proclaimed the blond. Draco leant down to kiss him quickly then, but that was a lost cause. It was never quick, because once they started in, they had trouble stopping. It was why Rita Skeeter—the cow—had had plenty of images to splash across her articles day in and day out for those first couple of weeks before the novelty had worn. And alone in Draco's dorm room, it was even harder. Five minutes at least had gone by before Draco finally left.
One in particular that stood out but never made the cut: the day Ayesha told Harry she was pregnant with a boy and was going to name him after their dad. It was really tragic because Aya knew Harry still wanted to have a family someday deep down, and Harry did about as well as you’d think with the news. But it ended up that there was just never a good place to put it, really, and I thought there was more than enough melancholy memories in the fic already. So I figured I’d put that tidbit in the notes for you lot. And since it’s not strictly part of the fic, you can take or leave.
Draco barely made it into a stall before he sunk to the floor. He absolutely should not have done that. He couldn’t recall even deciding to. One second Harry was going to leave and Draco was going to let him, and the next second they were kissing. Why had he done that? Now it was all worse than ever.
“I have to admit,” Draco told him over the music, “I thought at least some of it was… the technology they use? That computer magic to change voices. But he’s actually good.”
She’d moved so fast, then, that Harry felt the sharp stinging in his cheek almost before he’d put together that he’d been slapped. He stared at Lavender, wide eyed.
Malfoy huffed but didn’t complain as she stood to follow him. Harry’s eyes trailed them as they walked away. Celine was only a few inches shorter than Malfoy, and with their matching robes and pale colouring, from the back, they could have been siblings.
"Then let's at least have a drink if we're keeping on with the embarrassing confessional," Draco suggested tightly.
He was glad he’d had the feeling to put on better clothes before leaving his flat, or even the money might not have done it.
"If you must know," she began, "I was ten. We lived across from this other family’s flat, and I told my mum I wanted to give their daughter a kiss on the lips. My mum said
Blaise’s curtains had opened approximately twenty seconds after Harry had left the room. Draco wished he was a bit more surprised.
It turned out, of course, that one more day might not have been alright. Because said day was Saturday, and it had admittedly slipped Harry’s mind that that meant anything. He received his reminder in the form of his sister that morning. He was in the middle of the kitchen beating eggs, clad in just his pants, when his floo roared to life.
Harry checked himself right on time, managing not to lose his composure at the sight of Lavender Brown, very much alive. She was clearly dressed appropriately for their surroundings: a pink cocktail dress and heels so high and thin it seemed impossible to look so effortless in them. And her face was strained into a smile, contrasting with the promise of violence in her eyes when she shot Harry a look. It felt like it was a warning, one for which context was a mystery to him.
Harry held his breath for only a single moment, but then Draco—having returned unnoticed during the final explosion as planned—was sliding into the seat next to him. "Sorry professor, I just went to get the scurvy grass," he paused to tisk at their ruined potion, "though I suppose it was a waste of a trip."
How easily he had just gotten caught up in it, he marveled—the seemingly bottomless well of love for Draco that truly could only have come from over a decade of wanting. The sheer magnitude was too powerful; it swept him away without producing even a single dissenting thought from him.
Draco had been dating Harry for a while now, but he didn't think he'd ever get used to Neville Longbottom feeling comfortable around him, let alone being friends. But Neville was actually alright, he and Blaise had made fast-friends. And Draco also knew it made Harry happy to still have some of his friends from Gryffindor.
“Oh, he didn’t,” Theo assured him. “He took it off in front of me once. Wouldn’t of even thought about it again if it weren’t for this.”
Lily’s eyes—so like his own—misted, and before he knew it, she had all but yanked him down into her embrace, like he was still a little boy in need of mothering.
A bit of a filler chapter, this. I’ve been in such a writing slump lately. But I’m glad to be back!! Next chapter is about 3/4 written and should be up within the next week, ideally.
Answers like how beautiful Draco was, especially when he smiled, and the calming sound of his voice. Like his selflessness when it came to his sister and his dearest friends. Like the way he’d get so excited about his job, and how he would encourage Harry to do what made him happy. Like his honesty, his self-confidence, his stunning capacity for forgiveness.
"Practically livid. Oh he's giving me quite the spectacular death glare now, you should see it." Harry thought Malfoy sounded entirely too delighted about this to be sane.
It wasn’t until he’d almost gotten near enough to knock on the door that it suddenly flew open, and a small, giggling blur shot through. Or tried to. Rather, the form all but bounced backward off of Harry’s legs, very clearly not having expected the way to be blocked.
Blaise turned to look at him when he’d finished, a brilliant smile on his face. Maybe he really did get a rush from this stuff, Neville thought. The dark skinned boy was clearly missing a few screws, so why was Neville smiling back? He shook his head to clear it. “Come on, let’s get out of here before we get caught.”
Lavender narrowed her eyes. “Manipulating my girlfriend, who doesn’t know any better, into helping you ambush me.” She dropped her wand arm and put the other on her hip. “Not a good look.”
Ron nodded slightly, rubbing the back of his neck. "Yeah, I sort of figured that actually. Weird to hear you say it just like that though. Not bad weird!" He hurried to correct. "Just... weird."
Lavender blinked several times. “Is this about Draco?” she asked finally, throwing Harry off completely.
Draco bumped him in the shoulder. For a while, Harry allowed himself some space to enjoy himself. Draco and his friends swayed along, or danced, mouthing some of the words here and there. Even Ophelia seemed to loosen up around Daphne and appeared to be having a grand time herself.
The Slytherin blinked, so thrown by the question that the answer came out honest. “I think we are. Er, right?”
“You’re in luck,” Harry said, plopping down next to him before Draco had even moved, causing the blond to startle so violently that he tipped over his abandoned juice.
"Not like that!" Harry insisted, attempting to calm his boyfriend. Draco's stormy expression, unfortunately, didn't ease. Pansy had clearly been serious about Draco being the jealous type. Harry thought perhaps he could have worded his statement a bit better. "I mean it, it wasn't at all like that. It's
“Your parents?” Hermione repeated, confused. She’d just realised that she didn’t actually know much—or anything really—about Neville’s family.
As though it could sense Harry’s gaze, it looked up and locked gazes with him. Harry’s forehead burned something awful, and he used all his willpower not to clutch it. He knew then, this was Voldemort.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but there was no need. There was a scream of "Gabrielle!" from the shore, where Fleur could be seen wrapped in a blanket and looking relieved even from their distance. Draco shook his head in mock disbelief, obviously understanding the situation.
Thompson’s wasn’t quite as esteemed as Lewis & Williams, but it was certainly still noteworthy. He’d actually been here a handful of times over the years, though the place proved far better kept in this world. What was more, the patrons were more relaxed, and the dress code wasn’t so strict. There were people dressed like Harry, and then there were people dressed like Neville—wholly sophisticated. He was sans his typical eye makeup, and instead wore a plain pair of glasses.
it to be. The longer I go on the more things blur, and I… it’s difficult to put into words, even in my own head.” At that, he gave something of a bitter laugh. “Anyway, I was an arsehole to you. You
She sat on his sofa without hesitation, curling her legs up onto the leather like she had done it a thousand times before. And Harry was beginning to get the sense that perhaps she had. She patted the space beside her with an expectant look. Warily, Harry obeyed the unspoken command.
Draco nodded curtly, trying not to show how relieved he was at the news. It was better than what he’d been imagining, but he didn’t want Harry thinking that meant it was alright.
"Bite your lip like that. Do you know how often you bite or lick your lips in classes? Because trust me Potter, I do."
“Mr. Neil,” interrupted the stage manager. Harry assumed that she was there to lead him on, and released a disappointed breath, but instead she said, “There’s a group of people at the entrance insisting they know you personally. Would you like me to call security?”
“Well, I assumed after our chat earlier that you would stop moping around. What happened to the plan?”
Harry looked up, hoping the question in his eyes would be interpreted the way he hoped—and not as total ignorance.
After several tense minutes of directing the other Aurors, he grabbed Harry’s arm and the at once familiar and incredibly uncomfortable sensation of apparition overtook him. The next second, he had landed in the middle of a battle field.
Harry crossed the space between them in three strides; he was close enough to take Draco’s hands, but he didn’t. Instead he spoke, low and comforting. “You don’t owe me anything, Draco. We talked about it, even. We decided we needed to know each other, as who we are now. And then I just tossed it out the window, just now. It
,” Draco said. “It also doesn’t make me feel better for you to blame yourself for what happened when it was my decision to be in that bloody maze. I would have figured out a way to do what I did with or without you, probably with even worse results.”
“Hate to interrupt, but everyone’s ready for you now,” she told them. “Merlin, you are a gorgeous bride.”
is in perfect bloody health,” Harry spit. Then, remembering himself, he bit his lip apologetically. “I’m sorry.”
Harry barked a laugh, unable to stop it. “It’s okay,” he promised. His smile faded a bit, but he forced the next words out without the hitch that threatened. “I forgive you.”
Neville put his hands up in a far be it from me sort of gesture. “I mean, not exactly news that you want him mate. I did go to school with you, in case you forgot.”
“Unless we stop it, right?” Harry said. Lucius Malfoy’s eyes turned to him and remained there. Draco imagined he could have reached out and felt the animosity between the two.
“You look stunning,” he informed her. She smiled at him in the mirror. She’d never worn so much make up in her life. Her hair had been painstakingly gathered and tugged into a tight, braided bun atop her head.
Malfoy was jovial as they left the pitch with the direction that they’d both better show tomorrow ‘or else.’
Which was how Harry ended up here, in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione blinking rapidly once he finished recounting the events of a half hour ago. She had the oddest look on her face. "I believe Malfoy, uh, asked you to the Ball."
There was absolutely no hope of Draco holding back the following laugh. “Do you want a thank you or something?”
"We know darling," Pansy said, thinking it was relatively safe to speak again. "We feel for you, really. But Potter's more than oblivious isn't he? He probably thinks you were having him on, given your history I'm not sure you can blame him."
Draco was still looking up at the singer in clear confusion, so Harry got to witness the exact moment when he registered what was happening, and the hand in Harry’s went slack with disbelief.
Harry sighed, very strongly regretting his attempt at humour. "I'm not going to die," he assured them. "You lot made sure of that today, remember? I'll be able to breathe just fine now. I'll do whatever I've got to do and it'll be alright."
Malfoy scoffed at him, his jaw tightening at the insult. “I should think you’d be happy,” he replied. “It’s not a Basilisk, after all.”
Harry had crawled forward while Draco was going on, and now he'd cut the explanation off with his lips. Hermione knew she should look away, as this suddenly felt a very private thing to see, but she didn't. None of the others did either, though, so she felt a bit better about it. Harry and Draco were not the only ones breathless once Harry pulled away.
“So you’re a better wizard than me,” he checked. “Because my mum was a muggleborn. Your magic is better, godlier.”
And my mum too. I didn’t get to be held by them after a nightmare, or hugged when I’d hurt or scared myself, or told that everything was going to be okay. I didn’t get a family to love me, and you
“Krum had the most points,” Auror Fleur told him. “It’s the fairest option we’ve got since no one bothered to tell us what we should do at this point.”
“Draco please,” he begged, ready to go to his knees. “I never lied. I swear I didn’t try to—it wasn’t some kind of trick. I didn’t even know that that was what you assumed until just now. There
She huffed impatiently. “Perhaps I should have lead with what are you doing here? And don’t give me shite about being part of the mission. You’ve not got a trace on you, and I’m not in the position to entertain any games.”
There was a brief flash of pity mingled with something else before the blond got back on track. “Well, I was going to ask ‘what if they hadn’t?’ but this actually works better. Why did they protect you, then, why not take you to some church and have you drowned?”
Harry suppressed his sardonic snort at Malfoy’s version of an explanation, knowing it would hardly help the situation. He couldn’t stop his eyes from rolling, though. Fontaine didn’t notice; he let out a long sigh and stood up, walking towards the window to his left and staring out of it. His back to the two boys, he spoke again.
“No,” Ron admitted. “You know I’ve tried dating other people, it never lasts more than a couple weeks.”
The way she said the word ‘bloodbath’ with such relish made Harry smile. “Why aren’t you trying out?” he questioned. She seemed like just the person for it, to him.
“Voldemort didn’t hate muggles or muggleborns because he resented them for being a threat, Malfoy,” said Harry. “He hated muggles because his dad was one. Not a muggleborn. A muggle. Tom Riddle Sr was
Harry made a strangled noise at this, and the tips of Draco's ears turned pink. "I wouldn't know," he said, remaining ever dignified and stoically not looking at his boyfriend.
Malfoy smiled, and Harry almost tripped. It was a real smile, small but open. Not anything like the sneers and smirks he was used to when it came to Malfoy. And had Malfoy always looked at him like that? Harry hadn't had a single sip of the punch, but he considered that he might be imagining things regardless.
While Harry, Hermione and Ron concerned themselves over Sirius’s safety, Draco appeared to be concerned over each of their own safety, despite reassurances that Sirius wasn’t in any way dangerous. Harry supposed that Draco would simply have to see for himself before he would relax.
Hermione personally hadn’t known much of Luna Lovegood before Parkinson had introduced them all, but all signs thus far said she was a lovely friend to have.
Draco put his head between his knees. For the first couple days, he’d hoped that Harry would tell him that he decided not to go along, to let the adults find him a safe place away from it all so they could handle the Dark Lord by themselves. When that didn’t happen, Draco had just gotten angrier and angrier, until it was more principle than anything. Vaguely, he registered the tears in his eyes with the typical irritation and embarrassment.
But the hum of sound made it clear there was quite a lot of company here already, and that he was surely to be intruding.
“That’s the only reason you came over here, wasn’t it?” Harry shot back. “All about the story, huh. Don’t even actually care what might be going on in my life if it gets you closer to—”
Harry took in a deep breath and released it. His resolve seemed to disintegrate all at once, and he clapped Ron on the shoulder and smiled.
The other three glanced at each other, as if open discussion had never been a second thought to cross their minds. Draco sighed and continued walking; they had classes to interrupt.
And it had been doing so for weeks. Months, even. Even this very second, as he attempted this shoddily detached introspection, he could feel it—the devastation. Devastation at a degree that was
“It doesn’t!” He hollered. “You’re—you can’t go back there! You can’t just live like that. Who the rutting hell let this happen in the first place?”
He could hear others still all throughout the rest of the house, as the stairs creaked and voices occasionally carried. Presumably Victoire had brought little friends along, or was off badgering her grandfather somewhere.
A whole world of emotions went through Hermione at the sound of his voice, but eventually she settled on a mix of confusion and concern. “Granger? Since when do you call me that anymore?”
Harry and Malfoy exchanged a look, and Harry could tell they were thinking the same thing. How long had it been since the two of them were actually
Draco reached out gently, his hand coming to rest on Harry’s cheek. “So much,” he confided, and Harry was aware of little else but that touch. “It’s like after all these years, you’re just… you’re suddenly right there.”
There was really nothing quite like this atmosphere, in Harry’s opinion. It was easy to forget, for a bit, how much still needed sorting out between himself and Draco.
"Wonder how many times he'll have to reject me before I finally get it, yeah?" Draco said, attempting to sound light. The words, instead, came out rather hollow even to his ears, and he internally winced.
Malfoy finally seemed to have recovered some, because he leaned down close and hissed at her quietly. "I am not
“My behavior when I learned of your... sexual orientation,” he paused, and Draco did his best not to shift uncomfortably. “It was unacceptable of me to treat you as I did. I know that now.”
Malfoy looked at Harry then, comprehension dawning at having heard Cordelia’s name listed after Cosima’s and Celine’s. Harry recognised the sudden guilt, and he scowled at the blond in response. Of course Malfoy would only be apologetic now he knew it wasn’t just muggleborns being targeted. Now that he knew it was people who were supposed to have been his friends. His guilt meant less than nothing, in Harry’s book.
St. Mungos was a cold, hopeless place in Harry’s opinion. From the moment he’d walked in just over a week ago, he’d hated it here, but not being by Draco’s side was unthinkable.
you let anyone protect you! You care more about being the goddamned Boy Hero than you care about me, or you wouldn’t of even
Draco glanced at Auror Fleur in fear, worried for the Auror who was wearing Harry’s face. She appeared to be forming words with her lips. After a moment, Draco realised in horror that she had mouthed
And they were, for a time. The Catatonic Howlers still had a loyal audience, enough that papers like the
Sirius sighed. “I wanted to be on the spot. Your last letter... well, let’s just say things are getting fishier.”
“That is why I’m inclined to be lenient with you,” Fontaine continued. “You will clean cauldrons for Professor Danes every night this week, and you will
Harry looked around, waiting and growing more and more stricken about the time, when finally Krum appeared. Or, Harry had to assume it was Krum, since his head was now that of a medium sized shark. Transfiguration, Harry realized, but obviously not gone entirely according to plan. Looked to be getting the job done alright though, that was until he began to bite at Hermione's ropes with his teeth. Horrified that Krum would probably take off Hermione's head before managing to free her, Harry swam quickly toward him and gave him the sharp rock. Krum had Hermione free in seconds after that, and Harry watched with relief as the other boy swam away.
It turned out that Draco was, in fact, asleep. Vincent was also, but Greg appeared to be doing last minute homework and Blaise was idly painting the ceiling with the help of his wand.
ed. “I’m not surprised. But you see, Harry, someday—and I very much expect it will be soon—Reid and the others will have acquired all that they ever will from you. There is only so much to be found, is there not? And on that day, you will be expected to simply leave. And they will use what you’ve provided them for years, perhaps even decades to come, to study the
Harry did his best not to laugh again as Draco tripped a bit and righted himself before finally rounding the corner and disappearing.
The question was so quiet that Harry’s heart clenched. “No,” he said firmly. “Dudley knocked me about when we were kids and he was still capable of catching me. And my uncle will be... my uncle sometimes. But it’s nothing like what you’re clearly thinking, alright? They wouldn’t dare. I know I’ve got magic now, and if there’s one thing they’re afraid of it’s magic.”
When Harry stopped, the resulting silence stretched so long that Harry found himself holding his breath to keep it from shattering. His mind was racing, ardently picking apart every statement he’d just made. He recognised that he’d actually taken a fair few of his words from Sirius. His godfather rarely spoke of his family life growing up, but, whenever he started in, it was obvious their prejudices were still a sore spot. Harry hadn’t realised until now how much he’d actually retained from the older man’s ranting.
She looked at him sadly, and reached out to pat his shoulder. "Maybe Harry will have an idea," she attempted to sound comforting. "This is
This was my favorite chapter, and the one I was most looking forward to. I really hope you guys liked it.
A minute later, she sat down on the sofa, and Harry felt warm at how much lighter she seemed compared to when she’d first come in.
Draco smirked, eyes sweeping the room to give his next words more effect. "Well, it seems we're alone in my bed. So now seems a reasonable time for you to do so, and maybe repeat that, for the sake of my ego of course."
Neville did a remarkable job of keeping his expression neutral, but Harry could see the way his face whitened just the slightest bit. “I don’t know what you mean,” he lied.
“Your other arm you sniveling failure. I need a servant who will perform what I ask of them with some degree of success,” spit the Dark Lord disdainfully.
“A graveyard by the looks of it,” Auror Fleur said as she stood up, bringing him back to present. She reached down to help Draco stand.
“Mind if I use those real quick?” he asked Ayesha, gesturing to her special glasses. “I’ll give them back when the game starts.”
"Are students not allowed to snog their dates? I must've missed wherever that rule was written," said Draco.
Bellatix’s younger sister, Narcissa, had already been married off, and her other sister, Andromeda, had been disowned by Cygnus as well as was married to a muggle. Neither of them stood to inherit anything.
Harry spent the next ten minutes wondering about Snape, until finally getting irritated with himself enough to get back into the match. A lively half hour later, the Ravenclaw seeker caught the snitch, ending the match 360 – 210 in their favour. The Ravenclaw stands exploded into applause, including Harry and Ayesha. Remus clapped along, smiling at their antics.
Draco opened his mouth again, to say what he wasn’t entirely sure, but Not Fleur beat him to it. “He’s some dimwit kid, followed me into the maze.”
"It’s not a part of classes, it’s for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare," Hermione stated proudly. She was unsure of how a common room of Slytherins would react to her stance on the treatment of house elves, but she would stand strongly regardless.
All that Draco could hear then was the sound of Wormtail’s cries. He glanced at Not Fleur, who appeared as though she was both excited and frightened at once. How such a look was possible, Draco had no idea.
"He deserved that," Fred's amused voice assured Harry, who promptly whipped around to see the twins standing not ten feet away, appearing as though trying not to laugh. They'd clearly been there the entire time. Harry tried not to show his surprise when Fred winked at him, playful as he ever was back when they were friends. And suddenly Harry realized that none of the other Weasleys had ever told him they weren't still friends. Harry’s mind chose that moment to remind him that Luna was actually friends with Ginny. He’d just... assumed the red haired girl hated Draco, and therefore him by default. But had she ever actually said so? Had he even spoken to her about it? The only one of the family he could now recall having an outright issue was, in fact, Ron.
“I was,” Shelia confirmed, perfectly frank. “I’ve already ascertained based on our short time together that you are operating under several false assumptions regarding your situation. If you want us to be able to move forward to your benefit, you are likely going to need to put aside your preconceived worst-case scenarios.”
Lucius’s lip tilted up at the corner, the only indication he understood what Draco was saying. He sobered up within moments, however. “Everything I have ever done had been for you and your mother. When I thought that you would be lost because of me...” He looked Draco right in the eye. “I do not have the words to express how grateful I am that you are alive and well.”
The cloak was securely around him as he watched several Aurors show up and take their positions. For all he knew, one of them could be Harry. He did his best not to think about that, though.
“Everyone was paired off right away—me and Cel were a no brainer. I guess they thought it would make a difference if no one was ever on their own,” Cosima told him. “Didn’t matter. Emily Hernandez was next. Showed back up on Christmas, just like always.”
Harry could not recall the last time, if ever, that Ron had laughed so hard. Tears were leaking out of his eyes, and he was down halfway to the floor, shoulders shaking with mirth. A glance at Hermione revealed thin lips and a slightly narrowed gaze. Harry felt distinctly awkward. Finally Ron took a great breath and stopped, at last looking back up at them. His smile slowly melted away as he caught sight of their expressions.
The only safe option Harry had was to go with his gut and hope it didn’t get Neville into even deeper trouble. Extreme trepidation gathering within him, he apparated out.
Parvati beamed even brighter, somehow. “Thanks, Harry. So, how come you haven’t been round the past few days? Lavender wouldn’t say… a lot, really.”
The chuckling Slytherin waved him off. "Draco was perfectly fine, had plenty of time what with the way Snape tore Nev’s head off for five minutes. No one even came close to noticing he was gone."
“I was thinking of offering Harry the same, too,” Granger said. “The Head’s been on me for some time now to bring him back to the Ministry. Not necessarily back to the Auror Force, but we hate to lose a talent.”
I reached instinctively for my wand, but the librarian had already smoothed his features into his usual irritation.
Being forced to stay in the house did not agree with me, never mind that my entire flat could probably fit into Potter’s drawing room. For one, my flat was much newer and cleaner. And despite the valiant efforts of Kreacher, the house seemed to resist all efforts to spruce up its living condition beyond somewhat habitable.
Suddenly, I found it difficult to breathe. London had millions of inhabitants; even this side street I was in filled with clusters of people. Young and old, fat and thin, from all over the world.
“If you leave him unable to string two words together, we’d never be able to figure out what Lucius took from us,” Dolohov explained. “Besides, our master wants him unharmed. That should be reason enough for you.” Despite the reasonable tone, Draco could hear the edge underlying Dolohov’s words. Behind that mask of momentary amiability, there was true danger, and Greyback subsided with ill grace.
“Are we taking the lift?” Draco asked, seeing that Harry was headed towards the bank of them tucked behind the reception. “Won’t it be like walking into a trap?”
They had walked from the Leaky Cauldron to the Tube, then to a rather insalubrious part of Outer London.
A burst of concentrated photons jetted out, hitting one of the propulsors. The car skidded, careening –
And just as quickly, Draco and Harry were alone. They had frisked Harry and Draco, Harry having stilled into involuntary submission, and Draco too distracted by Harry to pay much attention. They had taken away Harry’s gun and both their cellphones before exiting.
“I’m afraid those will have to stay on for the moment, Draco,” Dolohov said. A wild gleam of anger returned to his eyes. “I remember how good you are with your fists. Surprising, that. Didn’t expect Lucius with his soft hands and pressed suits to have a son like you.”
Harry had listened with a somber attentiveness when Draco explained Rosier’s conjectures. Just hearing himself out loud made Draco sound so foolish. But it was the only lead they had, and Draco had to admit it tied together all the loose ends neatly if – if – Draco suspended his disbelief.
“Help us and we’ll tell you,” the taller man said. He had a sinister face: long, pale, and twisted, with a madman’s glint in the eyes. “Or we’ll be forced to use harsher methods.”
“I suppose it’s my way of dealing with it,” I said, after I took a sip. “Learning about the history was my way to understand what I had just been through, help me process the experience in a detached and empirical way. Or so that was my reasoning.”
“I need to be in London for work,” I said. “Most of the libraries and the resources are there. It’s simpler that way.” I wanted to stab myself with my fork. This conversation reminded me why I limited exposure to the Manor as much as I could. I took a sip of Potter’s wine. It burned pleasantly down my throat.
“You should get dressed,” Malfoy said, his eyes averted. “Unless you would like to be the one on show, that is.”
Harry started. None of his alarms had been triggered, and he hadn’t been pushed into combat reflexes as his bio-enhanced system was meant to do with a threat.
He leered at me. “You seem to like my decrepit arse very much. And no more dressing like a Dementor. It makes me sad to think of you hiding all of your … assets … under those baggy robes.”
“Yeah, that’s an example. And this case seems likely the same, with Ted Cross having the same rationale.”
Harry increased power, banking to the left to slip out of the grid. He would be close enough to the suspects soon.
Nervous anticipation rose at the idea; I had no idea what I would face when I returned – for it did feel like a homecoming in a way.
Nonetheless, I still checked it over, my professional side exerting itself. I took note of the small signs of wear that likely occurred before Slytherin hid it here, the leather-bound spine, the thickness of the volume from the vellum.
Draco had to admit it was impressive. Overly done — a diplomatic way of saying paranoid — but Draco was considering upgrading the Manor security along these lines.
“Yes. I’ll also have a protection detail arranged for them. Harry’s right, though; it’s best that you stay away for the time being.”
“My friend here doesn’t like you,” Draco said, and on cue, Harry inched menacingly towards Fletcher. “I wouldn’t recommend provoking him.”
However, Malfoy’s clothes indicated he might actually regard eleven thousand galleons as paltry change. Malfoy’s opera hat, now held in his surprisingly bare hands, looked as though it was worth more than Harry’s weekly stipend. The cut and material of Malfoy’s evening jacket must cost more than Harry’s savings.
“No.” A thousand scenarios raced through Draco’s head, each more worrisome than the last. “I guess we’ll figure it out somehow.”
What happened? Harry squinted. His vision showed a blurry ceiling with delicate motif moldings and a rather extravagant chandelier with crystals dangling from its many arms.
What was it that drew him to me? I wondered as I massaged the scalp. This house’s water pressure was slightly weak, and I stood under the faucet for a minute, water dripping into my eyes.
Fletcher scrutinized Draco over. “Weren’t you part of a UN panel whose very job was to prevent people like me from happening?”
The Shield of Achilles was mentioned in the Iliad, and one of the theory for the Antikythera Mechanism's origin is that it was based on an earlier prototype, perhaps from the island of Rhodes. There's been a lot of articles and even documentaries made on the Antikythera Mechanism. If you want to see the device in person, most of the fragments are held in the National Archaeology  Museum in Athens, Greece.
“You have duties as a Malfoy, and you’re letting your interests get in the way of fulfilling them. Now, your mother knows several eligible girls from good families. You need to come by the Manor sometime and meet them.”
“I’ll go with you,” Weasley said. He glanced at Harry. “We need to balance out our firepower. Unless you want to go with her ….”
Fudge looked uncertain, not knowing whether to project the genial confidence for all the cams around them or answer Harry’s question honestly.
A small gasp of air escaped from Potter’s mouth, then a louder cough. He jerked up with great hacking chokes. He looked at me through wide, unseeing eyes as he fought to breath.
Harry winced. Shacklebolt, the Head of the Auror Force and Harry’s immediate superior, disliked publicity of any sort. Fitting, for a national security agency that operated mostly in the shadows. That meant Harry was about to receive a lecture when he returned to the office.
Harry wasn’t sure whether he was simply looking for trouble or that he had actually smelled a crime. The facts were simple and neat. A little too neat, but in Harry’s experience, sometimes the most logical explanation was the reality.
I shrugged. “Not completely. I’ll have to corroborate them, of course. Imagine if I tried to cite them as sources. How would you go about citing magical visions anyways?”
So I held on. Grimly, painfully, as the burn continued and increased, my fingers gripping my wand tight under my robes, ready to break out of the mental link that was forcibly created between us and hex him. But I was petrified, my muscles frozen, as I was bound by the power of his Legilimens.
We went down to the basement. So this is where all the action is, I thought. Before me was a dazzling array of magical artifacts, the power their auras gave off visible even to the naked eye. I recognized some of the objects as the ones being missing from sets supposedly already completed, and others stolen from magical museums all over Europe.
We Disapparated once we were far enough from the Manor’s protective charms. I was numb, deadened even to its hurtling sensation.
“Here.” I took off my own robes and draped it over him; I wore a thin sweater underneath. It wasn’t much, but it was better than what Potter had on. He looked slightly ridiculous with two robes wrapped around him.
Perhaps I should have chosen a humbler location, I thought wryly as I greeted the doorman cordially and took the lift up. But unlike some of my colleagues, I didn’t particularly care for scholarly squalor.
“Harry!” The holos faded and Shacklebolt turned his attention to his young officer. “I understand you had a busy night.”
“Perhaps you should come and give a guest lecture to some of our advanced students,” McGonagall said thoughtfully. “I kept up with your career in general terms, and it’s impressive. Perhaps some of the OWLs or above Defense students would appreciate your historical insights into the Dark Arts.”
To Harry’s pleasure, Malfoy didn’t make any smart comment, but neither did he look suitably appreciative. Malfoy’s brows furrowed in an unfathomable expression that Harry didn’t know what to make of.
“Oi!” Dawlish called. “If you two are done being lovey-dovey over there, we need to discuss what’s going to happen next.”
Harry flicked his wand. The force of the spell was such that the hairs on my arms rose; there was no jets of light or bangs and flash, but Cross was forced to avoid the spell by Disapparating to the other side of the room.
“What then?” Potter asked. He looked disgruntled at being told that all the work he had done this morning was for naught. I didn’t bother telling him that research usually involved several false starts. Particularly if you didn’t know what you were looking for.
And there was the thornier question of how to define their relationship. Draco and Harry had spent the past few weeks in each other’s company. It was like before – Draco unconsciously divided adult life between when he and Harry dated and after – and Draco could feel the barriers of caution he raised falling.
“Anyone else you would like to invite in?” Harry asked, annoyed. “Haven’t you two ever heard of knocking?”
Draco went still as Harry’s hand brushed over his thigh. He couldn’t help it – all the blood in Draco’s body seemed to rush downward, and Draco’s brain fizzed out.
Draco unpacked, stacking his laptop next to a small pile of books – a traveler’s account of Afghanistan, a book on Alexander the Great’s campaigns in the region, and a dog-eared copy of the Iliad.
“I haven’t seen you wear a suit in … well, never actually.” When Draco used to invite Harry as his escort for formal events, Harry usually showed up in his dress uniform.
“What Harry means to say is thank you,” Malfoy cut in. He shot a quelling glance at Harry. “I think I’ll take my friend to my private box. Tom, why don’t you have something sent up there?”
“You can sleep for a bit, sir,” Finnegan said, his eyes on Harry. He had worked with Harry long enough to know the tell-tale signs of fatigue. “I can wake you when we get to our destination.”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he said through a full mouth. He took an enormous swallow and gulped down half the cup. “Damn. I needed that.”
“I’ll bet.” Draco had a sudden vision of himself bound before Harry, Harry fisting his hair while Draco arched, exposing his neck to Harry.
Setting both of them down with the reverence one treated temple offerings in the corner of the hallway, Draco then went to where the emergency supplies were kept in the closet.
“Please, no more philosophizing. It’s much too early for this,” Potter groaned, coming down the stairs. He was surprisingly light-footed; once or twice, he had snuck up on me while I was in the library reading or the kitchen eating. He sat next to me. The couch sagged in protest at the sudden weight. “What are we talking about?”
Damn. He was an idiot. How could he have lost his temper like that back there? Harry might still need to return to the Leaky for follow-up investigations. Now, it was likely that he wouldn’t be able to set foot in there again.
Draco stared at Fletcher, every line of his body tight. “In my experience everything is negotiable.”
“You’re smarter than you act, Potter. This connection empowers our SI to be faster than your average, but it has also risks. When we use it, it drains our body, and we end up needing to … medicate … to deal with the effects of it.”
Potter stared just a little off to the side. “You know I’m not going to. They’ll just stick me behind a desk and wheel me out once in a while to boost morale.”
The interaction between the victim and his coworkers, Hedwig said. Then I tabulated their technical skills, seniority, and interests, and calculated the odds that they would be involved in a project like developing SI web components.
Potters, on other hand, apparently did. He leaned in to kiss the tip of my nose. It was far too tame, especially by our standards.
My father arched one eyebrow. It was a skill I had never really mastered, despite practicing in the mirror for hours. When I did it, I always looked surprised than derisive.
Harry elbowed someone into the bar, tossed a tray. With his wand in hand, Harry blasted a path to the entrance.
“That’s not our jurisdiction,” Harry snapped. “Aurors don’t handle matters like those, and even if we did, there is a reason why we can’t –”
“Men like that only care about self-preservation,” Harry said scornfully. “And they do everything they can to save their own skin. And take for themselves what they want.”
Touch! Touch was what triggered the book’s magic. Touch and my proximity: the book responded when I physically approached it. If spells were not an option, and staring at it did no good, then maybe my fingers might find the answer.
The forest loomed before us, the trees stooped with age, their gnarled branches guarding the entrance. As we ducked under them, we were hit by a blast of cold air. My teeth clattered. Our eyes met with near pitch-black; sunlight did not penetrate this far into the leave’ thicket.
“You might be trying to trick someone or doing something you shouldn’t be. Or, you could be the victim of someone else. It also means that you need to be strategic going forward. You can’t have it all, not matter how much you try. You need to put yourself first in order to overcome what obstacles you face.” She raised her head to Draco, examining him. “You don’t seem very fond of this card, which is understandable. But do you have any reasons for doubting or rejecting it?”
Harry evidently thought the same. He stood behind me and grabbed my wrist. “Wait.” He performed a quick Summoning Charm.
But in this digitalized and interconnected age, it was crucial for anyone who wished to rise in the world to have a SI assistant. The vast influx of data needed the dedicated attention and analysis that went beyond what one man was able to provide, as the SI connected man to all the resources provided by the world wide Web. One that linked everything from the smart-threads in his trousers to the monitors maintaining order for the traffic grid.
“No,” I said. “It wasn’t because of revenge. It was something I discovered.” I told him about how I discovered the book containing clues to Slytherin’s Grimoire. I also told him about what Luna said about the conspiracy, and how Granger had warned me against trusting the Aurors.
“Would you have known what the Decoder and the Shield are if you haven’t been involved with this business from the beginning?” Harry asked. “I would expect most laymen wouldn’t. And these visitors – I doubt most of them are here for any kind of business that would survive the scrutiny of the authorities.”
“I should take my pants off too, shouldn’t I?” Harry panted. His erection was stiff through the fabric of his trousers; Draco wondered how they hadn’t ripped already.
“They’re swamp dragons, right?” I remembered coming across mentions of them in an article about West African shamans and their curses.
“We have to go back,” I croaked. My voice was hoarse. My throat was sore, and I desperately yearned for water. “My parents are still in there.”
Potter helped me gently off the broom. I refused to let go of his arm, knowing that if I did, I would immediately collapse on the floor.
“What? Oh.” Harry hadn’t realized he was directly under the projection, with the light coming down on his body in the most revealing manner.
“Kingsley knows the owner,” Harry said, and he led Draco in, ignoring the scandalized looks and scowls of the ones waiting for to be seated.
“Your biomechanical system is outdated,” Malfoy said, guessing Harry’s thoughts. “It’s not going to get triggered unless you’re already in a state of alert. The newer systems solve this by having their SIs constantly monitor their surroundings, but yours is more passive.”
been trying to take over his other self’s life, in the sense of dropping in and acting like everything was perfectly normal. Letting everyone believe the lie. Maybe it had caused this, in part. He missed his friends, his life—but he hadn’t made any effort to reacquaint himself, really.
She’d been clearly prepared to retort as soon as he finished, but she paused at that. “How do you mean?” she asked, appearing genuinely stumped. “Based on your account I imagined it was becoming more difficult to maintain such a staunch separation—especially with regards to your emotions and bonds.”
Draco had never been particularly comfortable around Albus Dumbledore. The old man looked at him like he knew every awful thing Draco had ever said or done. Not to mention that Dumbledore was also one of the most powerful wizards to ever live, respected and valued by nearly everyone. It could all be incredibly intimidating. At the moment, though, the old wizard in question was only sitting silently as the near rest of the room’s occupants whispered to each other and kept at least one eye on the fireplace.
,” Harry said automatically, and then nearly tripped over his own feet in shock. It was one thing to understand when
And with that, the Slytherin girl stood up and stormed off to her rooms, leaving Draco slack jawed and Blaise back to silently admiring his nails.
He never got to finish that sentence, however, because Draco had apparently had enough of listening.
Parvati stood on the threshold of Lavender’s flat, clearly surprised to find he’d been the one knocking later on that evening. But she didn’t look visibly upset at the sight of him. Lavender must not have verbally shredded him too harshly—or so he hoped, at least.
Draco thought at least twice a minute. Which was why he was incredibly confused when, eventually, he followed the Auror around another corner and was met with the sight of Harry examining the Triwizard cup.
Half way through the period, Hermione's cauldron blew up in her face. Snape descended on her, obviously trying to keep his glee at Hermione's failure in check, and having little success. The chaos began when she leapt from her chair and began wailing. The pleased gleam in Snape's eyes disappeared, replaced by obvious apprehension at the sight of tears. Ron, smack in the middle of the whole mess and completely ignorant, looked gobsmacked.
No, Draco didn't. But Severus already hated Harry, and the man wasn't an imbecile. He'd know who took it, given that Harry would have to use it in front of everyone during the second task. The only hope they had was if Severus were unable to prove that Harry had stolen it personally, then his hands would be tied. Which forced Draco’s reply, "If we do this, we can't get caught. You can't afford it."
Relief flooded Draco all at once, even as—amidst continual sobs and moans—a sinister, yet still blessedly frail voice said, “Robe me.”
Horror was steadily spreading; the more his—Harim’s voice echoed through his head, the more panicked Harry became. This was, he thought, exactly what he’d feared all this time.
Later that day, Harry quickly came to understand why there were three separate days allotted for Quodpot tryouts.
"Sure. There are herbs for all sorts of things, why not this?" Neville said, completely unaware of the gravity of this revelation.
"Hey Potter!" Malfoy's unmistakable, honeyed voice interrupted Harry's thoughts and had him tensing before he'd even turned around.
Harry didn’t miss the way her eyes rolled before he turned, and he just barely kept his chin up. He led them along in awkward silence for a few moments before he heard an aggressive sigh—and then Draco’s hand was grasping his own.
Neville cracked a smile. “I used to think you were like that,” he told Harry, thoughtful. “Now I reckon you’re probably the only person outside my family who gives a damn about me as, like, a person.”
Hermione Granger stood in front of a full length mirror, looking at her simple gown with a mix of wonder and adoration. It was the same long sleeved, lace white dress that her mother had worn to marry her father.
could not go well for him. “We’ll see,” he hedged, and Lavender snorted, clearly seeing straight through him.
She disapparated without further comment. Harry sat down on one of his kitchen stools, his mind once again a jumbled mess.
Harry wished he could help somehow, and was grateful that Maria took her hand, comforting. Cosima visibly reigned in her sorrow, and Harry felt a pang in his heart at the sight of it.
“I deserve to see this through,” he said. “Polyjuice everyone else. I don’t think that the others should still be put in danger, but I should be there.”
And among them, barking orders in a high pitched, feeble voice, was the most foul creature Harry had ever seen. It wore black robes that covered the majority of its form, but what was left was more than Harry had ever wanted to see. Its limbs were a sickly shade of white, veins stark against it. Its head resembled that of aliens Harry had seen on the telly a few times growing up, with red eyes to boot. The thing looked as though it might collapse at any minute, a wand held uselessly in its grip.
"Don't worry Harry, everyone sports a crush on Diggory at one point or another," Pansy soothed. "You were just enamored by his pretty face like all the rest of us, Draco included."
“Get down!” Harry heard someone shout, just as something—or someone—slammed into him, knocking him against the ground hard.
Anywho, this chapter goes out, in small part, to commenter allalrightagain: I’m sorry I had to fib a bit back when, even if it was only by omission. I’m of the mind that all will be forgiven in just a minute lol.
"How sweet," Blaise teased from behind him. "Watching him sleep, gods the great Harry Potter is a sap."
The room turned to look at her simultaneously as she flushed. “Sorry,” she said. “I only thought that perhaps Mrs. Malfoy was on track about the Aurors. Except, what if instead of sitting on the sidelines and hoping, they actually, er, went in?”
Harry looked around, not able to spot that familiar head of blond hair anywhere he could see. "He went off to give us some space. I'm sure he'll find me later on."
Today was May 2, 2005. Exactly seven years ago, Harry had ended the Second Wizarding War. But that didn’t really answer the obvious question she was asking, so instead he said, “This is the day I… died.”
Harry’s scar had hurt before, but never anything close to this. Vaguely, he could hear Auror Reid’s voice yelling for help, but the pain was too much for him to focus on the words. He must have collapsed only a handful of seconds ago, but it felt like years. After several moments, when the agony had receded enough to allow him to think properly, he forced himself up, doing his best to ignore the remaining sting.
