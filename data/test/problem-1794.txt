“Harry! Good to see you, love. Here to try a new hot chocolate flavor?” she asked, winking.
As though on cue, Curry looked up, blinking at them before beginning to wander over. Draco took a cautious step back, causing Harry to snicker and earning him a scowl.
Satisfied, Harry quickly cast the Drought Charm on the letter, a trick used to keep letters dry during the most terrible of storms, and tied it around Colette’s ankle. After giving her a treat from the jar that he kept at the front of the shop, he opened the door for her. With one hoot of gratitude, Colette swiftly took off into the inky rainclouds.
Teddy grinned. “Okay.”
Once dressed, he ran a comb through his hair, although his black waves still sat at odd, unusual angles. After a minute or two he gave up, spraying himself with eucalyptus and pine aftershave. Then, giving himself a final once-over, he felt reasonably content and headed in the direction of the kitchen.
Draco picked up the mug, swallowed the remaining contents, and then left the café.
Just as Harry had taken a seat at the kitchen table with a bowl of Frosted Flakes, he heard a soft rapping on the living room window. Startled, he stood up and wandered into the room, finding himself looking at Colette hovering outside the window. Harry’s curiosity was immediately struck, wondering why Draco would be writing to him when they’d planned to see each other for knitting lessons that night.
Harry paused, also setting down his plate before looking intently at Draco. He was struck by the vulnerability in Draco’s voice, and there was something akin to fear lingering in his words that caused Harry’s own heart to break in two.
“Really? You’re going right into small talk?” Draco asked, the corners of his mouth tilting upwards.
“I’ll go slow, love. Are you ready?” Draco asked.
Draco sighed as he set down his knitting and placed Stockinette in his lap. “Alright. I’m on board.”
suitable …”
“It’s perfect. Absolutely perfect,” Draco murmured, running his hands once more over its smooth surface before looking up, his gaze softening. “Never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think that Harry Potter would be teaching me to appreciate the finer things in life.”
. We don’t like each other.”
Draco’s shoulders dropped. “I don’t know, Potter. I haven’t practiced Potions in years. What if I’m pants at it?”
As Harry wandered over, Draco glanced up, and a hesitant smile bloomed across his face. Harry, taking the chair that was located on the opposite side of the table, dragged it next to Draco and took a seat.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah.”
This morning, he’d woken up expecting to find the dark, inky lines of his soul mark on his right wrist, tying him to an unknown being. However, as weak light had poured into his bedroom in the Manor, falling across his pale skin, he’d realized that the blank space was just as bare as it had been the night before. His stomach had immediately sunken, knots forming in its pit as dread had set in. While there had been a few reported cases of magical folk not receiving their soul mark on their twenty-first birthday, it was largely uncommon and considered a rare condition.
, Draco thought to himself.
Harry snorted. “Of
Draco sighed, running a hand through his neatly trimmed hair. “Can we move on?"
As soon as the clock signaled that it was opening time, Mrs. Van Ness barged through the door.
“Yeah, okay,” Draco said, a warm feeling of hope filling his chest. “I’ll stay.”
“What are they?” Harry asked, stopping in front of the plants.
“Millicent Bullstrode. Always had been. Millie didn’t sway that way, though, and nothing ever happened between them. In fact, Millie went on to marry Theodore Nott last year. Not that I’ve talked with her, though. Haven’t talked with any of them in years,” Draco said, mumbling the last sentence.
Walking back over to the table, he grabbed his project before heading up to bed.
Draco skeptically raised an eyebrow. “You’re actively offering to spend more time with me?”
Teddy nodded.
“How’re you doing, Andy?” he asked in a lowered tone.
“I’m freezing my bollocks off!” Teddy yelled over the wind.
“Oh, it’s brilliant. The adrenaline that comes with it is unlike anything else. It also helps that I love having Seamus as a partner, which I try to rub in Harry’s face as much as possible,” Ron said, grinning.
that you’ve come out as bisexual. Is it true?”
Harry nodded, removing his hand from Draco’s. “Yeah. Okay.”
After coming to terms with the fact that continuing to poke and prod at his hair was only making things worse, Harry set down his comb and wandered into the living room. There, he spotted Stockinette in a loaf position on the coffee table, her legs politely tucked underneath her body. She stared at him, her head cocked slightly to the left as if to insinuate that Harry was moving far too slowly this morning.
“Do you know what you’re going to get?” Harry asked.
“Oh, is that what it was?” Harry said, laughing. “Alright. Do you still have your broom?”
Harry stood back as Colette made her way into the room, choosing to perch on the edge of his bedside table. Her cream colored feathers were once again slick with rain water, which she promptly shook off to the best of her ability. Harry grimaced as water flew everywhere, including his glasses, and untied the letter from her ankle. The sight of Draco’s handwriting made his heart flutter, although, at the same time, he found himself feeling rather anxious.
“Yes, sounds great.”
“Eager, are we?” Malfoy slid off of him, and Harry whined at the loss of contact as Malfoy settled on his knees in between Harry’s legs, propping them up. As Malfoy muttered cleaning, protection, and lubrication spells, Harry closed his eyes and reached a hand down to his cock, which was weeping precome onto his abdomen. He gripped it loosely, gritting his teeth as he tugged his length up and down.
“Indeed. So, what have you been up to, then? Still with the Girl Weasley?” Draco asked.
, he racked his brain for something to do that evening to take his mind off the absence of Draco.
As he walked out of the door and down the cobblestone path, his mind blank with confusion, his right wrist started to itch. Glancing down, he saw black lines begin to emerge across his skin.
Ron nodded. “Listen, mate, it’s going to seem barmy at first. Give a listen to Hermione, though. She might be onto something.”
Malfoy leaned forward, his hand tentatively reaching up to cup Harry’s cheek. Harry could feel his breath, warm and steady as their lips brushed together. It didn’t feel like fireworks, as Muggle movies so often depicted; instead, it reminded Harry of what it felt like to come home after a long day — a quiet comfortableness that settled into his bones as he climbed into bed, knowing that everything would be okay.
Not being able to help himself, Harry caught up to Draco one day after Potions class, requesting help with his studies ― a clever excuse for Harry to explore why he was so intrigued by him.
Harry watched as Draco’s long, pale fingers let go of the Snitch, whose thin, papery wings shot it high into the sky. Then, as it disappeared behind a cluster of dark clouds drifting in the wind, Draco gave Harry a smile.
are we in a soggy field?”
“Yeah,” Harry said softly. “Me too.”
“Ah, I see. And how long have you and Harry done business together?”
Harry let out a heavy sigh as he picked one of the flowers, twirling the thin stem between his thumb and index finger, and thought of Malfoy. They weren’t friends, so it didn’t matter that they hadn’t talked since Malfoy had stormed off earlier that afternoon. Yet, as Harry replayed the conversation over in his head, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d managed to screw up a relationship that was nonexistent.
“I see. Well, I think it’s a lovely sentiment, Potter,” Draco said, his cheeks flushing. “Actually, speaking of jumpers, how’s yours coming along?”
The air was heavy and smelled like sex as they laid next to each other on their backs. Draco always hated this part. Harry would tell him where to meet next week while they snacked, and then it would be over. No soft touches, or sleepy kisses, or napping together until the sunset. Draco would leave for London first, and he’d spend the next six days pretending that this was enough.
“Um, well, we decided that it would be best to go to the source, so Hermione brewed Polyjuice Potion and then Ron and I disguised ourselves as Crabbe and Goyle and snuck into the Slytherin common room,” Harry said meekly, staring at the wool in his hands.
“What? Do I have something on my face?” Harry asked, instinctively rubbing the area around his lips.
Hesitantly, Harry picked up the skein of yarn. The fiber was soft and thick, albeit a bit itchy.
Harry wandered back to his bedroom, quickly grabbing the satchel sitting on top of his dresser before stuffing it with his wallet, keys, project bag filled with a pair of half-knitted gloves, and a small, mosaic brown and beige shawl in case the radiator in the shop decided to stop working for the thousandth time that winter. Once double-checking that he had everything, he headed towards the front door and was met with an incredibly familiar sight ― Ron and Hermione were taking turns giving Stockinette heaps of affection as they sat on the floor, their laughs echoing off of the thin walls of the flat.
“Draco, darling, you’re drooling.”
There stood Draco Malfoy, several years older and looking like a cat caught in the rain. His hair, ashy blond, was longer than it had been when Harry had seen him at his trial a month after the war had ended, falling in gentle waves to the tips of his ears. He wasn’t as skeletal either, the hollows in his cheeks and under his eyes having been filled nicely.
,” Harry said, knowing very well that he would be telling Ron and Hermione the next time he saw them. “Are you ready to order?”
Harry cleared his throat as he awkwardly pushed up his glasses in an attempt to distract from his embarrassment. “Y ― yes, all good. I’ll be down in a minute. This paper snowflake has been an absolute bastard.”
Harry grinned.
,” Harry said, finally gathering his thoughts. “In fact, I’ve been told I’m an excellent chef. Also, I didn’t know you wore red.”
Potter nodded, and Draco sat up. Wandlessly, Potter murmured familiar cleaning, protection, and prepping spells, and Draco gasped at the cool sensation of lubrication that was now ringed around his arsehole, which felt open and stretched. Potter looked at him, as though asking his permission, and Draco nodded, shifting forward and hovering so that Potter could align himself with Draco’s hole. After a moment of fumbling, Draco could feel Potter’s cock pressed against him, slowly breaching his tight ring of muscles. As he cautiously sank down onto Potter’s length, he panted through the overwhelming burning sensation, knowing that he’d never been stretched this much. He felt achingly full, pushed to his very limits as Potter’s cock became fully seated inside of him.
“Sixty pounds even.”
“Potter?”
They passed by an ice cream shop named Gino’s, and the air surrounding it was sweet with the rich smell of chocolate, cream, and fresh waffles. Continuing up the street, Harry noticed that Draco was unusually quiet.
Harry let out a soft pitter of laughter. “Of course I mean it. In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been trying to find every excuse to hang out with you. I just can’t stop thinking about all of the years we wasted hating each other.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “How’d you know?”
“The trial. Yes, I’m well aware, Potter. Now, I need assistance, and I’d really rather it not come from you. Is there anyone else who works here?” Draco asked.
When Draco left forty minutes later, Harry found himself feeling sorely disappointed and threw himself into helping customers for the rest of the afternoon.
you.”
Not a second later, a sleek grey cat leapt onto the bed, her soft blue eyes staring intently at him. He watched as she looked around the bed, trying to decide where to settle. Eventually, she crept onto Harry’s pillow, curling herself around the crown of his head.
“You alright?” Harry asked.
“Sure,” Harry said.
They made their way around different stalls for the next while, admiring the vast variety of skill sets that had been put on display for the evening. One of Harry’s favorite stalls had been one containing shelves upon shelves of artisan toffee. The toffee maker had explained that each bucket was unique to the taster, as she’d perfected an edible solution that would recall one’s most treasured memories. As Harry had let his sample melt on his tongue, dissolving into a pool of warm, buttery sugar, he’d felt overcome with memories of the Quidditch Pitch at Hogwarts, laughing with Ron and Hermione in the common room, hugging Molly and Arthur Weasley, and ― the most surprising of the bunch ― decorating the Whomping Willow Woolery with Draco. Closing his eyes as he’d savored the toffee, he couldn’t help but hope that Draco was thinking of the same thing.
Draco smirked, patting the cushion next to him. “You’re a sore loser, aren’t you?”
Pansy wrinkled her nose. “Charming, Draco. Really lovely.”
“Please, dear,” Molly piped up, “let us know if we’re putting you and your mother out. That was not the intention of Harry’s surprise.”
Since then, they’d managed to become even more inseparable. Draco had even tagged along to the shop the day after their ice skating date, helping Ron at the check-out counter while Harry and Hermione assisted the customers with any fiber questions. In a way, Harry felt largely relieved that Ron and Hermione were caught up with where he and Draco now stood ― boyfriends who were completely and utterly indivisible.
Draco turned around to find a rather concerned-looking waiter frowning at him. He quickly took his seat again, awkwardly clearing his throat. “I’ll just leave this here for you,” the waiter said, placing the leather folder that contained the check on the table. “Please take your time.”
“But Auntie Narcissa has us now, Granny!” Teddy said, beaming.
And then there was Malfoy.
Harry let out a soft laugh. “As nice as that sounds, are you free on Tuesday?”
As soon as Draco pulled out, they both collapsed onto their backs in sheer bliss. Harry curled into Draco’s side, resting his head on Draco’s rapidly rising and falling chest. Draco looked down at him, and Harry noticed that his fringe was stuck to his forehead with sweat.
Harry offered him a sympathetic smile, remembering all of those years at Privet Drive. “Yeah. Is that what you feel like?”
“Um. Hello,” Narcissa said, fidgeting with the hem of her grey jumper as she took a few hesitant steps forward. “This must be Edward, although I understand that he prefers to go by Teddy.”
“Like.” Harry let out a heavy sigh. “You and me. Roommates. Friends. I think my younger self would be horrified if he could see us now.”
As he finally finished his dinner, there was a polite knock on his living room window. Looking up, he could make out Hermione’s soft, tufted brown owl through the frosty glass. He stood up with a sigh, his stomach feeling uncomfortably stretched, and wandered towards the window, opening it.
Harry, astounded, let out a bark of laughter. “You think I’m bad? You should’ve seen yourself. You spent more time trying to get up from the ice than you did skating on it!”
“So, Harry, I take it we’re still on for the craft fair tonight,” Hermione said.
For once, he no longer had to simply wonder what Draco would feel like ― skin, hair, lips, and all.
Harry looked to his right and saw Narcissa coming through the doorway, stopping in her tracks as soon as she saw Andromeda and Teddy. The dish towel she was holding dropped limply to the floor.
Harry watched as Draco’s face paled, knowing that they were skirting around the edges of dangerous territory: house arrest meant war crimes, war crimes meant loyalty to Voldemort, and loyalty to Voldemort meant prejudices that were nearly impossible to forgive.
past, anyway. Listen, I’m just curious about what you’ve been doing these past few years. I want to talk about the war about as much as you do. That being said, you’re not obligated to tell me anything.”
“You should talk to Hermione about it. I’m sure she’d know a few people at the Ministry looking for apprentices,” Harry said.
Hermione lifted up a deep purple hat. “Ron’s Christmas present. I made him promise he’d pretend to be surprised.”
“Thank you,” he said softly, squeezing Draco’s hand. “I’ve never been ice skating, but I’ve always wanted to. This is absolutely perfect.”
Malfoy followed suit, discarding Harry’s hoodie and T-shirt somewhere off to the right. Just as Harry was about to pull him in for another kiss, Malfoy stepped back, grabbed his hand, and led him to the bed, where he was pushed back onto it. Harry scooted up so that his head was level with the pillows before letting out a slow exhale. Still standing at the foot of the bed, Malfoy was undressing further, peeling off his trousers and pants. Harry stared, hungry eyes easily going to Malfoy’s cock, which was fully hard and flushed against his abdomen, leaking glistening precome onto his skin. Malfoy’s cock was beautifully thick with jutting veins running up the sides, the head deep pink. Harry swallowed hard at the sight of it—at knowing that he was moments away from feeling it, touching it, being fucked with it.
Draco let out a bark of dry laughter. “What, are you suggesting that I spill all of my dark secrets to you, my knitting instructor?”
Draco shrugged nonchalantly, although there was a smirk plastered on his face. “Maybe.”
“If you’re so inclined to sit here, there’s plenty of room.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,
A heavy silence fell over them, and suddenly everything fell into place.
“I’m up for it as long as you supply me with Butterbeer along the way,” Draco said, smirking.
As they stood surrounded in a whirl of white, Harry swore he could feel his heartbeat everywhere, thudding heavily from his eardrums to the tips of his fingers. And, for the first time, he didn’t quite hate that Draco was so much taller than him ― something that had always bothered him during their days at Hogwarts. In fact, it was nice being able to look up into his stone colored eyes, which Harry couldn’t manage to stop staring into. Only a few centimeters closer, and they would be kissing ―
Draco looked up, scowling. “Well, good thing I’m not
Stockinette purred in response.
“Alright,” he began, letting Stockinette twist out of grasp, “feel free to have a seat on the couch while I get the menu.”
“Well, I can attest that cats are wonderful companions,” Harry said, grinning.
Harry sucked in a sharp breath, his eyes tracing Draco’s words over at least three times before setting the letter beside him on the duvet. Looking up, he saw that Colette was blinking at him with bright, hopeful eyes, somewhat reflective of how his mood had shifted since reading the letter. Draco’s words had managed to be a great comfort, although there was a lingering question that needed to be addressed.
Draco took a seat on the edge of the bed, the cotton duvet cool against the back of his bare thighs. He wiped away the beads of sweat that had collected on his upper lip as he studied the rays of blistering afternoon light pouring in through the bedroom’s lace curtains, casting shadows across the buttery yellow walls.
“Also,” Harry began, taking Draco’s hand in his own once again, “to answer your question from the letter, I don’t care what we are, Draco, as long as I’m with you.”
Draco, who had gone bright red in the face, let out a light laugh. “I know it’s not necessarily good, but I did try, so thank you for appreciating that.”
But you were engaged.”
Draco was twenty minutes early, and Harry was
“Malfoy, look. I’m so sorry —”
“What do you think?” Harry asked.
Once Ron and Hermione had stood up, wiping as much silver fur off of their jumpers and jeans as possible, Harry swiftly picked up Stockinette and opened the front door. After locking up, the four of them headed down the narrow staircase that led down to the shop’s backroom.
Draco looked down at him, frowning. “I’m perfectly capable of paying for my own order, thank you very much.”
, their rich, earthy tones and soft wool incredibly pleasing to look at and feel.
“About a year, I’d say. I know I’ve told you before that the first few months were rough ― like, really rough. I was dropping stitches left and right, and my tension was all over the place. Hermione really had to work with me on that. My second project, a beanie, looked more like a cone. I think the first properly successful thing I made was a triangle shawl. It's navy blue, and I still wear it on occasion,” Harry said before noticing that Draco looked uneasy. “Why?”
,” Harry panted, their eyes locked. “
“Midday?” Draco said before his demeanor changed, softening. “Mother will be very pleased to see you. I don’t doubt that she likes the way our Christmases are now, but I think she still winds up a bit lonely every year. I imagine you coming will make her day. Would ― would you be willing to stay for an hour or two? I realize you’ve got Christmas with the Weasleys, and I don’t want to interrupt that, but ―”
“Obviously, Potter,” Draco said, smirking. “Do I smell toast?”
“Does it look good, Ted?” he asked.
“Haven’t found anyone yet. I guess I’m just waiting for someone special,” Draco said.
Harry paused. “Oh, okay. Want me to come with you?”
“Fuck, Malfoy. Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Potter murmured, his hips buckling upwards to meet Draco’s thrusts. Draco let out a loud gasp as the tip of Potter’s cock hit his prostate, sending sharp, overwhelming waves of pleasure to his fingertips and toes. Draco couldn’t see, couldn’t breathe; the only thing that mattered was the feeling of pure, unadulterated rapture that was spreading through him as Potter thrust harder and deeper.
,” Draco began, his cheeks going the color of his shirt, “red does still equal Gryffindor. However, I’m trying to branch out.”
“Well, I’m just —” McWeenie glanced nervously between them, “— going to go. Dinner is at half six.”
Draco let out a light laugh, his eyes transfixed on Stockinette. “I’m not.
Harry raised an eyebrow, amusement settling in as he stared at Draco’s words. Perhaps the most perplexing thing about the note was the fact that, once again, Draco was coming to him for help with his knitting. While the Whomping Willow Woolery did just fine among the locals, it was in no way the most prestigious yarn shop in the wizarding part of London. Several resided around the place, one even being located in Knockturn Alley now that it was no longer dedicated to both the Dark Arts and Dark Magic, instead becoming solely a branch off of Diagon Alley. The idea that Draco would choose his shop out of everyone baffled him, and he found himself slightly desperate to know the answer.
Harry let out a small whimper as Malfoy ground down on his erection, and his hips bucked upwards in urgency again as he tightly gripped the sheets on either side of him. “Fuck, Malfoy, please—”
“Darling,” Andromeda said, reaching for his arms, “let’s wait until everyone sits down, okay?”
“Get ready to have your arse kicked, Potter.”
As he stood there, watching the sun sink completely over the lull of Diagon Alley, he began to mull over his evening plans. When he’d arranged to play a match of Quidditch with Draco a week ago, he’d only just come to terms with his feelings for him. Now, here he was, completely addicted to Draco's presence. Harry knew his flying wasn’t as good as it had been at Hogwarts; he was more than a little rusty, and it certainly didn’t help that his gaze would more than likely be stuck on Draco throughout the entire game. However, he was set on not losing, and he could feel a quiet fire of determination begin to burn in the pit of his stomach.
“Huh. Alright, I’ll go for that as well.”
An hour passed before Draco showed up, politely knocking on the door and then stepping inside. Harry nearly fell off of the ladder, staring so intently at the way Draco’s crisp collared shirt was tucked neatly into his form-fitting trousers that he lost balance, only barely managing to right himself again.
Andromeda let out a soft laugh, wiping her falling tears on the back of her hands as she silently mouthed “thank you” before heading in the direction of the kitchen.
wouldn’t wait so long to see them!” Teddy said indignantly.
Standing up, he quickly ran down the hall and into the kitchen, grabbed his spare supply of letter-writing equipment from a drawer next to the fridge, and then settled onto the couch in the living room. Pale, pewter colored light fell through the window, casting deep shadows across the cold wooden floor. Just as he was about to dip his quill in the ink pot, a sleepy Stockinette stumbled out of the hallway and headed in the direction of the couch, swiftly hopping onto the arm. Harry reached out his free hand, which she gently nuzzled.
Draco’s cheeks warmed, and he let out a huff of nervous laughter. “Yeah, well, I think the Felix Felicius is beginning to wear off …”
A few hours later, he received a letter from Andromeda.
As they began to decorate, Harry trying desperately to concentrate on hanging the snowflakes instead of looking at Draco’s bum, music came flowing out of the Muggle speakers at the back of the shop, the sweet sound of Bing Crosby singing
“Fine,” he said. “I’ll do it.”
Harry spent the next several minutes pulling the jumper onto Teddy and then helping him with his socks and shoes. As soon as Teddy was fully dressed, he darted off of his bed and planted himself in front of the mirror hanging from the back of his door. There, he began testing out different hair colors, eventually landing on mint green.
Before Harry’s mind could churn any further, he felt something soft move against his leg. Opening his eyes, which were blurry with tears, and looking down, he saw that Stockinette had come out from her box and was now nuzzling him. He smiled softly, wiping his nose on the back of his hoodie sleeve before bending down to give her a thorough pet. Although he’d never trained her in any capacity to sense when he was beginning to disassociate, Stockinette had somehow managed to pick it up, never failing to ground him.
“Okay. Are we going now?” Draco asked.
“I came out to my friends pretty soon after the war, and everyone was really kind about it. Hermione immediately bought me a bunch of books on being LGBT, which I still have yet to read. It wasn’t that big of a deal, though, since my mental health was declining fairly quickly at that point. Everyone had bigger things to worry about, I guess. What’s your experience been like?” Harry asked.
I'm totally Draco in this, desperately trying to impress my wife by attempting to knit. Turns out I'm much better at writing about knitting than actually doing it 😂
Without waiting for an answer, Malfoy leaned forward, swiping his thumb over a spot next to Harry’s bottom lip in a way that sent a shiver down his spine. “Maybe we could grab a coffee sometime. Chat about what business with you might entail.”
Harry shrugged. “Sure. You seem like you need some …
Draco gave him a tight-lipped smile. “Thank you, Potter. We weren’t in love, which made it easier, I suppose.”
“So.”
Draco nodded. “I’ve noticed. Did you knit his dog jumper?”
“Ready?” Harry asked as Draco stepped into the fireplace.
“Sorry I’m late,” Draco said sheepishly, taking a seat next to Harry, which happened to be the only one available.
“Good, yeah.”
After a moment, Potter pulled Draco away from the wall, and they stumbled their way onto the sofa, with Draco straddling Potter. Draco ground down, eliciting a moan from Potter, who quickly broke the kiss to mutter, “
filling the air. Draco, of course, managed to make several comments saying that The Weird Sisters’ Christmas album was far superior, resulting in many eye rolls and rude gestures from Harry.
“I should be.”
Harry let out a shaky laugh. “You want me to eat pot roast with your mum?”
“What’s it called?” Harry asked. “I’ve fallen completely out of the Quidditch loop.”
,” Harry said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, “I didn’t realize that you required breakfast.”
Draco waved a hand nonchalantly through the air. “Oh, don’t be. It was a long time ago, and there’s no use dwelling on it now. Plus, I wasn’t entirely innocent.”
“That’s a bit … generic,” Malfoy said flatly. “Could you be more specific? Type of flower? Size?”
Two more thrusts, and Draco was coming, his pleasure shooting hot and fast into Harry. As Draco began to slow, his cock growing limp, Harry fisted his own length a few more times before he orgasmed, semen spilling over his hand.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “You do realize I’m twenty-four, right?”
As Malfoy stood in front of him, facing away, Harry let out a small breath. On the nape of Malfoy’s exposed neck sat a magical black tattoo of a rising phoenix, its inky feathers stark against his skin. Mouth slightly agape, Harry stared at the phoenix, watching it take its first breath after being reborn —
“Hey,” Draco said, his voice gentle as he raised his right hand to cup Harry’s cheek. “It’s okay.”
“Okay?” Potter asked.
“I’ll send a letter your way with the dinner details,” Harry said, his stomach a mess of nerves and excitement as he wandered towards the door. “Happy New Year’s, by the way.”
As quickly as he could, Harry dashed into the kitchen and pulled out the takeaway menu from the junk drawer next to the fridge. As he headed back to the living room, he felt eternally thankful that he’d managed to pick up the dirty laundry and stray shoes that had littered the ground surrounding the couch that morning.
Potter sucked in a sharp breath. “Merlin, Malfoy. You want to—”
Eventually, Malfoy spoke. “So, you like me.”
As they entered the back of the shop, a sharp chill ran through Harry’s lean body, and after setting Stockinette down and flicking on the lights, he immediately turned on the radiator and cast a Warming Charm.
Harry wished the floor would swallow him right then and there.
“Wednesday?” Harry suggested. “I’m usually able to close up shop a little early during mid-week.”
“Right. Well, what is it you want to give to me, then?”
“Sounds good,” Harry said, taking Teddy’s hand in his.
As he continued down the path, he realized that he could see someone sitting on his bench.
Malfoy took a hesitant step forward—something so different from his usual cool and collected demeanor—and let his hands rest on Harry’s waist, pulling them close. Harry sucked in a sharp breath at the proximity, their lips nearly touching. He could feel Malfoy’s soft breaths against the skin on his neck, and he sank into the familiar scent of his orange and clove aftershave.
Draco’s eyes lit up, and a wide smile spread across his face. “Alright. Well, when do you want to schedule it?”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“I think so,” Draco said, setting his yarn on the table and fishing out the owed money from a small, expertly knit coin purse that only Narcissa could’ve made.
Potter shrugged. “Guess we’ll just have to do it elsewhere, next time. Are you free tomorrow?”
A few minutes later, a waitress showed up to take their order. Harry and Draco had agreed to share a pot of tea, which both of them seemed desperate for.
Malfoy glanced up. “Sure.”
Ron awkwardly cleared his throat. “Yeah, I … I suppose that’ll be fine. But, if the Ferret utters a single word out of line, I swear ―”
“Yes?” Harry said awkwardly, feeling his cheeks warm with embarrassment. “What are you doing here? I haven’t seen you since ―”
Harry did as told, rearranging himself on his hands and knees as he faced the headboard. Draco, having cast another lubrication spell, in addition to a protection spell, on his cock, came up behind Harry and lined himself up with his arsehole.
“Malfoy, would you mind staying after for a minute? I’d like to talk to you,” Harry said, anxiously picking at a hangnail.
As he contemplated the horrid concept of moving from his warm, luscious bed, he heard a small pitter coming from the direction of the hallway. Smiling, he clicked his tongue.
With a final check of his watch, Harry stood up from where he’d been crouching next to Stockinette. He let out a heavy breath as he looked down at her, frowning as she butted her head up against his leg.
“Sorry, Stocky. How about I make it up to you with some breakfast?” he asked, wincing as his bare feet touched the bitter coldness of the hardwood floor.
After spending ten minutes lamenting over the absence of Draco, Harry swung his legs over the bed, stretched, and stood up. Stockinette, who’d been fast asleep at the end of the bed, yawned before lumbering over to Harry’s pillow, lying down, and promptly curling herself into a tight crescent.
I'll be getting to comments within the next few days, but know that I've read them all and am grinning from ear to ear. Once again, thank you all. I hope you're having a safe and festive holiday season, and my wife and I are sending lots of love to wherever you are.
Harry glanced down, embarrassment rising in his chest as he let go of Draco’s hand. “Well, I don’t know. I thought we were maybe becoming friends.”
“Draco …” Hermione began, setting her knitting on the coffee table and scooting closer to where he was sitting. “Can I make a suggestion?”
Harry also stood, casting a quick
Draco loudly cleared his throat, sending Harry shooting back to reality. He took an abrupt step back, mortified. Draco, on the other hand, looked awkward but relatively collected, the tips of his pale ears a soft pink.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “As in … a date?”
“Right.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just anxious to get there,” Harry lied as he began to pick up his knitting again. “I’m really excited to see
Once again I'm just going to say THANK YOU for the amazing support you've provided me while uploading TWWW. It means the world to me, and I'm so happy knowing that so many of you are enjoying it - especially the mental health and crafting aspect <3 I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe! Happy Friday!
Harry shook his head. “No, I’ll wait until this afternoon. She and Teddy always go out for lunch on Saturdays.”
“Of course,” Harry said.
feel something for him, being together would do nothing but damage for his public image.
Unfortunately, this did not deter Stockinette from trying, causing Harry to miss most of his episode.
An hour later, Harry and Draco found themselves deeply immersed in the tall bookshelves of Flourish and Blotts. While Harry skimmed the time-turning section, trying to find a suitable book for Hermione that she hadn’t read yet, Draco was poking around the ancient herbology section, which sat a shelf over.
Harry winced as Draco continued to aggressively knit, if one could even call it that.
“This is the yarn you’ll want to use. It’s 100% merino wool. Go ahead and pick three colors,” Harry said.
“Well, Potter? Are you coming?”
Once the cereal box was upright on the coffee table, Harry wandered towards the hallway. Poking his head down it, he could hear Teddy blowing raspberries from the direction of his bedroom and Andromeda sighing in what could only be described as a horrible cocktail of exhaustion and stress.
“Well, I donated Grimmauld Place, Sirius’ childhood home, to charity a few years ago. A painter named Amber Zhao is in charge of running the home and keeping it in shape for various charity functions, so she came up with the idea of holding a Christmas craft fair there. The ticket proceeds go to several wizarding charities, and all money from art purchases go directly to the artists themselves. It’s been running for about four years now, and it’s incredible. There’s every type of craft imaginable: paintings, photography, sculptures, pottery, jewelry, artisan soaps, blown glass, and the list goes on. The fair starts tomorrow and goes until Monday. I’m going with Ron and Hermione, but I’d love it if you could join us, and I’m sure they’d feel the same way,” Harry said.
“I’ve missed you both too. I’m truly sorry I haven’t gotten over here sooner,” Harry said sheepishly.
Several minutes passed before Harry, who realized his watch had vanished with his clothes, spoke. “Do you know the time?”
And because he was a shitty liar, Malfoy now knew this too.
“I love you, too.”
“Yep,” he said.
“Alright. Do you do a lot of business with them?” Draco asked, not batting an eye at Oisín's pronouns.
Harry looked at him with curiosity.
“I’m sorry, Granny,” Teddy mumbled as he burrowed his head into her shoulder.
“Go us,” Harry said through a mouthful of chicken. “So, did you bring your scarf?”
“No worries, Harry,” Hermione said, crouching down in the doorway as Stockinette wandered over to her.
The sky was heavy with dark clouds, threatening to unleash a new flurry of snow and slush at any moment. This caused Harry to frown, a deep crease settling in between his eyebrows as he made his way towards the nearest Tube station. The path was slick and wet with snow that had fallen overnight, and his shoes were already soaked and uncomfortable. Silently, Harry thanked himself for having been reasonable and putting on a second pair of wool socks over his first.
At Hermione’s words, Harry took a seat on the couch, patting the space next to him. Draco cautiously followed, sitting down as though he was waiting for a bomb to go off. Since coming into the shop for the first time, Harry had only seen him this uptight when they’d gone to the ice-cream parlor.
They made their way out of the alley and onto Grafton Street, which was filled with shoppers, street musicians singing Christmas carols, and flower vendors. The air was heavy with rain, although it had stopped lashing for the time being, and a strong wind was rolling over the city. Glittering lights hung above the street from buildings on either side, and the words
“Yes! Will there be sweets there, Granny?” Teddy asked.
During their years at Hogwarts, Hermione had always told him to pick his battles when it came to Draco. Not that he ever listened. However, as he went about starting a new row, he realized that he decidedly did not want to spend his evening fighting over dropped stitches.
Their Chinese food arrived via owl an hour later, which Harry was eternally grateful for given how hungry he was. After retrieving plates from the kitchen and sinking back into the couch, Harry began to split their shared sesame chicken, steamed rice, and spring rolls. Stockinette, becoming rather curious herself, nimbly hopped from Draco’s lap to the coffee table, where she proceeded to delicately sniff the food being served.
“Everyone could use a bit of happiness nowadays,” Harry said.
Almost immediately Stockinette woke up, stretched, and settled in Draco’s lap.
Next chapter goes up on Tuesday, Nov. 24th
,” Harry murmured.
Before Harry could reply, the oven timer began to chirp and Andromeda stood up from the couch.
Andromeda gave a small laugh, and she mussed his hair. “No, sweetheart, Granny doesn’t have an ouchie.”
Draco smiled softly at him. “Yeah?”
Draco arched an eyebrow as he crossed his arms. “You’re meaning to tell me that you’re the owner of the Whomping Willow Woolery?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Yes?”
After ushering Colette inside, he took the neatly rolled parchment paper from her ankle and began reading.
“So, what do you think?” Laoise asked.
“Trust me, the feeling’s mutual.” Draco paused. “But to answer your question, no. I never thought I would end up here.”
He rolled over, his body stiff from lack of movement, and watched as pale sunlight streamed through the window above his bed, catching on particles of dust floating through the air. He tensed, waiting to hear the sound of Hermione’s footsteps coming up the stairs. After a moment, the sound of the bottom step creaking echoed across the house, and Harry groaned, closing his eyes, hoping that he might convince Hermione that he was asleep.
Just before Harry was about to look away, Draco glanced up, catching his eye. Harry watched as Draco’s pale face grew crimson in color, and he shifted away, looking flustered.
Oisín let out a bark of laughter, and they patted Draco reassuringly on the back. “Don’t worry, there’s no pressure to say hi to her. Harry, do you want to grab a handful of grass and feed it to her?”
Harry watched as Draco raised his wand, casting the Snowfall Spell. Slowly, glistening clusters of snow flurries began to fall gently from the ceiling, dissolving upon impact on the ground. Harry looked to Draco, only to find him eyes wide and smiling brightly, several snowflakes landing on his light blond eyelashes.
Knitting had been far more difficult than Harry had expected. In fact, he was tempted to quit altogether. After placing the dishes in the sink and casting a
“Fuck you,” Harry laughed.
“No, it’s fine. Can I help you with anything?” Draco asked.
As Fridays were the one day a week where the Whomping Willow Woolery was closed, Harry spent the morning unpacking several shipments of wool, skein winders, pattern books, and handy bits and bobs that made knitting just a little easier. It took him an hour to go through the first large cardboard box, getting lost in Fariza Hatterman’s new shawl book. The patterns were stunning, mosaic patterns craftily wound into crescent, square, triangle, and circle segment shapes, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from daydreaming of making them. However, reality hit like a freight train as he abruptly remembered the sheer amount of projects he had currently going on, causing him to begrudgingly close the book and move onto the next cardboard box.
Harry looked to Ron. “Do you have any idea what it is?”
As dinner progressed, Harry couldn’t help but be overtly aware of how close he was sitting to Draco. It was nothing new; they’d been in such proximity plenty of times. However, he swore he could feel every one of Draco’s light exhales and polite laughs travel up his spine.
him.”
TW - smut! Easily skippable and towards the end of the chapter! Also, very mild angst! But like, VERY mild! No fretting is needed!
As the group turned right, following the path past a fallen tree, Harry heard an achingly familiar voice behind him. Glancing back, he saw that Malfoy, who was Head Unspeakable, had made his way through the pack of people and was chatting to Elora Dunn. They seemed to be completely engrossed in conversation, so Harry let his gaze linger. Although he and Malfoy didn’t run into each other very often at the Ministry, he consistently had a small crisis after every encounter. With ashy blond hair that was always pulled back into a messy knot on his head and crisp, sleek clothes that hugged his body in all the right ways, there was no denying that he was attractive. Harry had clearly been harboring a small crush on him for a while now, yet he pointedly chose to ignore the feelings that welled up inside his chest whenever he caught sight of the man. He was
Harry sighed, his heart breaking at the sheer amount of pain sitting behind Andromeda’s eyes, and he couldn’t help but think of Sirius. After all, he’d had that same wily streak in him, determined to give his family hell for their foolish beliefs.
“You’ve got Harry to thank for that,” Ron said, grinning.
Stockinette’s food in hand, Harry wandered into the living room. As soon as he caught sight of Draco, his heart leapt into his throat.
“Oh, don’t look at me like that, Potter,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
Except that Harry didn’t want that to be it. He wanted so desperately for Draco to be coming over to his flat for a nice, romantic evening filled with dinner, drinks, and cuddling under one of the many knitted blankets Molly had made for him over the years. He yearned for the ability to look at Draco and know that he was cared for.
“Oh. Okay. Brilliant. Carry on, then,” he said before turning back to his own knitting.
“Have you ever been ice skating?” Draco asked.
Really, this was all Harry’s fault.
“You wish.”
“The Celer One-Thousand. Fastest broom of its kind. No one’s ever seen anything like it,” Draco said, mesmerized.
Harry let out a light laugh. “Yes, presents for
“Yeah, we should. I’d ideally like to be back here around 1:30. Let me just grab my stuff. I’ll be right back,” Harry said before darting back to the check-out counter.
Harry frowned, not sure what to say.
“I’m in the same boat. I haven’t seen anyone since my last boyfriend, who I dated for a few months three years ago. He was my one and only relationship after Astoria died.”
“Okay. You want those three?” Harry asked.
“Great. Give it a go again and see how it works,” Hermione said, handing him his knitting.
There, in front of him, was a ball of soft green yarn and two wooden sticks.
Always Draco.
Draco let out a haughty huff of air in response.
Harry nodded stiffly. He wanted to be happy for Ron, but he couldn’t find it in himself to do it. Truthfully, he had no interest in hearing about how well things were going for either of them, as all it did was make it blatantly clear that his life was going absolutely nowhere. However, as much as he wanted to yell at them to stop, he resisted, clenching his jaw shut.
,” Draco laughed incredulously as he pulled the beanie onto his head, a look of disbelief crossing his face. “You, the loveliest, most attractive man in the entire world, has knit me a hat, and you’re asking if it’s
— to ease the pain of the situation. However, before he could do anything, Malfoy walked away, leaving him alone with nothing but his thoughts.
Andromeda shrugged dismissively as she wiped a stray tear from the corner of her eye. “It’s a lot, I suppose. I hadn’t prepared myself for how different ―
Harry, after briefly choking on his spit, let out a surprised laugh. “Yes. Why?”
“Mr. Potter, I’m so glad you could make it,” Amber said.
Once Harry and Draco had shrunken their bags down to a far more reasonable size and stuffed them into Hermione’s handbag when she wasn’t looking, they began their venture back to Harry’s flat.
“Alright. This way,” the host said, leading them past the glass case nearly overflowing with baked goods and into the sitting area, which was filled with tables and booths.
Harry nodded. “Presents. How should we go about this, then?”
“I’d like to see that,” Draco scoffed. “Now, you never answered my question.”
, and he silently reminded himself to write Pansy a thank-you note.
Next chapter goes up: Thursday, Dec. 10th
Then, there was the constant guilt nesting in Harry’s chest. It had been him that Voldemort was after at the Battle of Hogwarts. So many lives had been lost that night, and for nothing. In the darkest moments of everyday, Harry found himself wishing that it had been him who had died that fateful night ― not Fred, or Remus, or Tonks, or Colin Creevey, or the countless others who had sacrificed themselves for the sake of Harry’s life.
“Granny,” Teddy said, reaching up to cup Andromeda’s cheek, “you’re crying. Do you have an ouchie?”
He sat in a stupor and drank coffee while the porridge cooked, occasionally casting a glance at the clock hanging on the wall to make sure that he was alright for time. By nine o’clock, he’d chucked on his coat and a matching set of a grey scarf, gloves, and a beanie that Molly had knitted for him several years ago. Then, stuffing his keys and wallet into his satchel, he headed out the door of his flat, down the stairs of the building, and out into the brisk morning.
Draco opened the door, and everyone ― barring Teddy, who had promptly decided to cling to Draco’s legs ― shuffled indoors. Once the group had shucked off their extensive collection of outerwear, most of which consisted of too many knitted items to count, Draco led them into the sitting room. There was a large fire crackling in the hearth, and Harry could feel that his fingers were, thankfully, beginning to thaw.
They’d somehow managed to skip that discussion the other night, despite their love confessions and the soft way in which they’d said goodnight. Harry felt perplexed, although he knew in his heart what he wanted the answer to be.
“Look,” Malfoy began, letting out a weary sigh. “I don’t know how to do feelings. I don’t know how to be romantic, or make you feel special, or show you that I care—”
“And you didn’t mind?” Harry asked.
And, instantaneously, Harry knew that none of this had been a sudden, spur-of-the-moment development. He’d been, in fact, falling in love with Draco Malfoy for years. One of his most painful memories, that of the Astronomy Tower all those years ago, crossed his mind, and he realized that he’d seen then the same version of Draco that he was seeing now; scared, and with a lot to lose.
Harry walked quickly to the front of the shop, letting down the blinds and locking the door before lifting his wand into the air and turning off the train and Christmas tree lights with one smooth flick. Then, once he had scooped Stockinette into his arms and beckoned for Draco to follow him, he headed into the back room and up the stairs, unlocking the door to his flat.
in the countryside. He had me play outside so that I couldn’t hear anything, and there were sheep. I went up to one, and the bastard jumped on me. I had hoof prints on my coat,” Draco said sourly.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked, frowning.
“We have,” Harry said, glancing down at his wrist watch, “thirty minutes until we have to open the shop back up.”
After a moment, Malfoy broke the silence. “So, how’s the broom business treating you?”
“Honestly,” Harry began, taking Draco’s hand, “I bet Teddy could’ve skated circles around us.”
“Right,” Harry said nervously, looking anywhere but at Malfoy. “Well, I’d like to buy a bouquet of flowers.”
Harry smirked. “He only knows half of it.”
Once he’d arrived at the Tower Hill station on the East End of London, he hurried up the stairs that led him onto the road. As he wove his way in between Muggles, he spotted a wooden sign reading
It wasn’t during their first, second, or even sixth tutoring session that Harry began to notice his feelings shift. It took months of watching Draco stir a cauldron across the lab table, his ashy blond hair catching the light in the dimly lit dungeon, before Harry realized that Draco had somehow become, in all ways, his everything.
“Right. Well, I’d go with an acrylic blend so that the blanket can be washed. There’s only so much a
“It’s your decision, Draco. Either you drink it, or you don’t. Just know that I won’t be there to listen to your complaining if you don’t at least
“Harry?” Hermione asked. “Everything alright?”
“Now, let’s go around and introduce ourselves. Please say your name and why you decided to take this workshop. I’ll start. My name is Harry, and I’ve been knitting for five years. I really struggled at the beginning though, and I was only able to learn through sheer stubbornness. My goal is to make the process of learning how to knit a little easier,” Harry said, and the table erupted into applause.
“Get on your knees, then, and turn around. It’s a good position to use during your first time,” Draco instructed.
As Harry emerged back onto the bustling path, he thought about how he would have the opportunity to get to know who Malfoy was now, their schoolboy days long forgotten.
“Brilliant. So, what have you been up to since the war? Besides the flower arranging, I mean,” Harry asked.
Draco sighed, finally breaking eye contact with the broom. “Some days more than others, but yes. There was nothing quite like playing a Quidditch match at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” Draco said, frowning. “Well, my mother started a floral arrangement company three years ago, and I help her with that.”
Draco shrugged. “Sure.”
With a heavy groan, Harry sat up and rubbed his eyes. After a moment he reached over to his nightstand, grabbed his wand, and lazily cast
“Malfoy,” Harry said quietly, “are you okay? Do you want to get out of here?”
Malfoy pressed a light kiss to his forehead. “It’s a date.”
Harry answered by meeting their lips together, tentative at first and then steadily more sure. His lips were warm and soft, and he tasted like the chocolate soufflé that Ron had made for dessert.
Harry quickly cast the same spell on his scar, which vanished.
“Right,” Harry said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. “Um, well, no. I’m single, although I wouldn’t mind a partner. How about you?”
“I like it,” Harry said, smiling softly.
“Of course. Come on,” she said, looping her arm through his, “let’s get you downstairs. Ron’s dying to tell you how his training went today.”
Harry snorted. “What happened?”
This is one of my favorite chapters, so I'm super excited to be posting this morning! I hope you all are doing well, and thank you so much for the continuous support <3
“Oh, Draco,” Hermione murmured, leaning into Ron, who was now standing next to her. “Thank you. I can’t tell you how much that means.”
“Can’t you just bring whatever it is up here?” Harry asked.
Draco let out a painful groan. “Yes. Merlin, I don’t think I’ve ever seen something so ugly. Honestly, Harry, the color is hideous. Why did you even put out bright orange yarn to begin with?”
“I mostly use
Next chapter comes out: Monday, Dec. 14th
With one final thrust, Malfoy was coming, emptying himself into Harry before collapsing on top of him. The room stilled, the only sounds being their heavy breaths and the rain that was falling in hard waves against the roof. The air smelled like sex and sweat, just as it always did.
“Much agreed,” Draco said, pulling back and gesturing to the four packages sitting near their feet in a ring of dryness, two of them belonging to him and two to Harry. “So. Presents.”
Eventually, he came across a navy blue, cream, and pastel lavender. Picking them up, he wandered to the check-out counter and stashed them in one of the drawers. Just as he was resuming his people watching position, he saw a familiar face peeking into the window.
“I should warn you,” Harry said, temporarily stilling Draco’s hand, which had come very close to unzipping his jeans, “I’ve only ever done …
As Harry watched Draco’s tall, slender figure disappear into the crowd, he let out a heavy sigh. It was going to be a lonely evening.
when making hats, since it’s pretty soft. You’ll only need one skein, so have at it,” Harry said, gesturing for Draco to pick a color.
“He. Is. My.
Draco gave him a small smile. “Of course. See you tomorrow.”
Harry grinned. “Perfect.”
Harry nodded solemnly. “Yeah. I know.”
Draco nodded, a deep blush still lingering on his cheeks . “Sure.”
“Worsted, and it recommended 64-155 meters.”
“Of course!” Laoise said, beaming as she flicked the switch on the kettle.
Draco hadn’t meant to fall in love —
There was something so different about him, and yet things were still familiar. He seemed to have mellowed a bit since the war, and it no longer appeared like he was an arsehole for the fun of it. For some reason, the changes in Draco had sparked a curiosity in Harry, who wanted nothing more than to get to know who he was now, after all this time.
“Alright, you three, up,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Come on. Time to open up shop.”
Harry smirked, crossing his arms. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Completely normal.
“What are your Christmases like? And how did you celebrate when you were living with the Muggles?”
.” Draco sucked in a sharp breath at the feeling of cold air meeting his now naked body. Potter shifted forward, going in for another kiss, but Draco paused. Slowly, his eyes made their way down to Potter’s long, thick cock, which was laying heavily against his stomach and leaking precome onto his skin. Draco bit his lip to stop himself from letting out an audible groan at the sight.
“Oh.” Malfoy frowned. “You came.”
“Right,” Draco said, grinning, “well, in that case, I suppose I ought to tell you what your surprise is.”
Harry let out an embarrassed laugh. “You’re one to talk, Laoise. You and Oisín have been in business for what, two years? And you’ve already gathered a huge following. You’re easily one of the most popular yarn brands out there.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “You weren’t …
“At the beginning, yes,” Andromeda said, enveloping her arms around Teddy as he hopped up from the floor and crawled into her lap. “I was disowned by my family in 1972 when I announced my engagement to Ted, and Narcissa would visit me regularly for the first few years. However, by the time Draco was born, the visits had slowly begun to dwindle, and she only managed to make it over here once or twice a year. Then, the visits stopped altogether. I’ve always had a hunch that it was Lucius’ doing, but this is all speculation. Who knows, maybe he didn’t even know about the visits.”
“Excellent.”
“Oh, don’t be, darling. You must be swamped with the shop. Now, I just need to check on the salmon. Be right back,” Andromeda said before heading into the kitchen.
His eyes landed on Draco, who was standing to the right of the fireplace with Ron and Hermione. Just as Harry was about to go up to them, a hand on his shoulder held him back. He turned around to find Amber Zhao, the woman in charge of Grimmauld Place and the craft fair, grinning at him.
“Hey, Malfoy. Can I get you anything before we go?” Harry asked.
“A lesbian? Yes. Highly distasteful among our families,” Draco said.
. He wasn’t even close to being ready to leave, as he had yet to pack his knitting bag, wallet, or printed order forms. Dashing to stand in front of the oven door, he took a quick last look at his reflection before begrudgingly deciding that he would have to do.
Draco rolled his eyes before turning towards Ron and Hermione, who were still engaged in a pointless battle, and raised his eyebrows. “What’s with them?”
Harry snorted, gesturing to Stockinette. “And yet ―”
Draco nodded slowly. “How long did it take for you to get good at it?”
“I imagine running the company is a good distraction for Narcissa, given her house arrest,” Hermione said.
“Someone that you don’t know, love.”
“I’ll come help,” Hermione said, following him into the kitchen.
A moment later, something cool and slick circled his hole as one of his legs was lifted higher. He opened his eyes and saw that Malfoy was propping his right leg upon his shoulders, exposing him.
“Merlin,
“Where is that?” Draco asked, frowning at his menu.
. However, as he approached the bench, he quickly realized that politeness wouldn't work.
Harry remembered being told that Andromeda would serve Draco Cauldron Cakes when they used to visit, and suddenly everything felt much more real. Andromeda and Narcissa were in the same room for the first time in nearly two decades, and although it was a bit awkward, things didn't seem like they were going to explode any time soon.
“Sounds good to me,” Harry said.
“I’ve also brought you something that might cheer you up, but you’ve got to go into the living room to see it,” Hermione said.
Picking up the laminated menu, he began to skim over his options. “Is anything jumping out at you?”
“As for Teddy, he’s six and curious about
“He won’t,” Harry interjected. “Thank you both so much.”
Grabbing a handful of Floo powder, Harry stepped into the fireplace. As he let the powder slip through his fingers, flames beginning to engulf him, he could just barely make out the twisted look of fright on Andromeda’s face before he disappeared.
Draco sighed, looking up. “Oh, I suppose.”
Eventually, Harry was the one who broke the silence.
Harry snorted, although a ripple of butterflies shot through his stomach. “
The only thing that kept Harry going was the frequent visits from Ron and Hermione. They would floo to Grimmauld Place at least five times a week, checking in on Harry and bringing him rich, warm food that Molly had made. They kept him updated on the world outside, which had seemingly moved on without him, and this often led to Hermione prompting a conversation about Harry’s mental health. Harry would reassure her that he was fine, and she would reassure him that was most certainly not.
. I think he just wants nothing more than to fit in, you know? Settle down, make friends, establish a routine.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile, touched at how much Teddy cared for him. “Granny told me you named one of your dolls after me. Is that him?”
, he hadn’t. All he’d wanted was to find a nice, quiet flatmate who wouldn’t bother him too much. Although, looking back, that had clearly been too tall of an order; The Boy Who Lived was neither quiet nor undisruptive. Yet, somehow, Draco had found himself unable to say no to whatever charismatic Gryffindor bullshit Harry had been offering in return for a flat with privacy from the press.
,” Draco began, a violent blush rising to his cheeks as he looked at everyone on the porch, “what’s this?”
“Darling,” Andromeda asked gently, “where did you hear that word?”
“Sorry,” Harry said, heat rising to his cheeks.
“Oh,” Harry said, shifting so that he could see Draco more head-on. “Draco, you didn’t have to get me anything. You know that, right?”
“I’ll do anything for you, Harry,” Draco murmured. “Anything at all.”
“Malfoy, do you need help?” Harry asked.
“Fine, fine,” Draco said dismissively. “Anyway, how’s the shop been? I know I haven’t stopped over in a little bit.”
“No, I’m alright. Plus, I’d really like to see how Hermione knits,” Draco said, briefly smirking before continuing. “Thank you, though. I appreciate it.”
“Now,” McWeenie continued, his eyes glancing between the two of them, “who’s doing the trust fall?”
“Hey, Harry?”
Letting out a heavy sigh, Draco turned to him. “I think she would love it. What colors are available?”
Harry shook his head. “You won’t be. I know you, Draco. This is something you’re
Harry grinned, feeling content. “See! I told you I’m a good cook.”
“So, what do you think?” Harry asked as Draco took his first bite.
Looking around, Harry couldn’t help but feel a swell of joy in his heart at all of the bright colors filling the shop. Often, as he was closing up shop, he would spend an hour or so simply taking in all of his yarn stock, organized by brand, weight, and color. His favorite section to stare at was the fingering yarn by a small, indie dyer company called
Draco let out a soft moan, threading his fingers through Harry’s hair. “I want to fuck you.”
“This is a … strange development,” Draco said, snorting.
Teddy, on the other hand, looked alarmingly like Remus, a light dusting of freckles covering his golden skin and bright hazel eyes sitting a bit wider apart than was typical. However, his smile was all Tonks, toothy and lopsided.
!” Harry said, looking up. “This is what you went back for right before we left the fair!”
nodded. “Sure. I’d be up for that. What kinds of arrangements are there going to be?”
“Well, you haven’t seen anything yet,” Draco said, grinning as he took a few steps forward. “Come on. This way.”
Harry instinctively rushed to the window, although his fears were immediately rectified. Draco shot up out of the fall with a gust of speed and leveled himself with the window. Harry stood, breathless, as Draco hovered in front of him. He looked so similar to the boy Harry had grown up with, and yet he was, at the same time, an entirely different person. Gone was the slicked hair and pointy sneer, replaced by a soft, lopsided smile and bright eyes that twinkled with excitement.
“Hello,” Harry murmured, breathing in his aftershave. “Nice to have a moment alone.”
Harry paced the length of his living room for the twentieth time as he anxiously checked his wrist watch, his mind racing with ways in which the reunion could go horribly wrong. Despite there being ten minutes left before he needed to Floo to Andromeda’s house, he’d been ready for the past half hour, having taken a shower and packed his knitting bag early.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he murmured.
“I almost forgot,” he began, bringing them to a halt. “Andromeda wrote me back. She says she’d love to have us arrange a reunion.”
Draco closed his eyes, wearily rubbing them before looking back up. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose.”
“Sure.”
Sitting on his bench was Draco sodding Malfoy, happily eating what Harry recognized as the raspberry sorbet from Gino's. He was more attractive than Harry had remembered. His hair was longer, pulled into a knot on the top of his head, and his features didn’t look quite as severe as they had as a child. His crisp collared shirt was tucked into form-fitting, charcoal colored trousers. Harry swallowed thickly, having completely forgotten that Malfoy, as the newly appointed coach of Puddlemere United, would be at the convention.
Draco looked around, pursing his lips in thought. “How about we start here and work our way around the first floor?”
I honestly don't know where to begin. I started working on TWWW in September on a whim, and while I enjoyed writing it, I was quick to assume that it would become a complete and utter failure - no kudos, no comments, no reactions at all. There were many times when I debated scratching the entire project, but my wife, along with Peachpety and Veelawings insisted I not. So I didn't, and I'm so glad.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I do.”
,” Hermione said, looking intently at Ron, “know how much Draco means to you, and we’d be happy to get to know him better. Plus, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that he’s the first person you’ve taken an interest in since Ginny. He must be rather special.”
Draco seemed lost, glancing around the shop with wide eyes. Harry frowned, wondering why the hell he would be there. In the year that he had owned the shop, he had frantically worked to keep his name unassociated with the popularity of the shop, so unless Draco had an excellent connection, it seemed as though he had stumbled there by happenstance.
“Well, okay,
Andromeda sighed. “Ted, you know you’re not supposed to watch the telly without me ―”
Harry frowned. “I, uh, well … I own the place.”
you work here?”
Harry let out a heavy breath. “Who was she in love with, if you don’t mind me asking?”
Harry blinked.
“Oh,” Harry said, heat rising to his cheeks. “Well, considering the fact that we’ve seen each other nearly every day in December so far, I figure it’s time we ought to start calling each other by our first names.”
crowd. Anyway, I’m about to split you off into partners. You’ll be working with your partner for the rest of the weekend — no ifs, ands, or buts! Let me just find the list …”
Draco let out a small laugh. “It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that you’re miserable, Harry. You procrastinate going to work every single morning; I honestly don’t know how you haven’t been fired yet.”
“You’re a horrendous liar, pet,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Maybe you’re just a late bloomer. My Aunt Eustice didn’t get her mark until she was thirty.”
After a moment of silence, an abrupt bark of laughter caused him to look up. Draco was laughing so hard that his entire upper body was rippling, and there were tears in his eyes. Eventually, Harry couldn’t help but join in, his stomach hurting from a combination of deep giggling and violent waves of butterflies at the sight of seeing Draco so relaxed.
They ate their breakfast in relative silence, both of them conscious of the time. When 8:55 rolled around, Harry collected their empty plates, dropped them off in the kitchen, and then began to gather his things. Sick of his yellow jumper and pair of mittens, he hastily packed a skein of bulky, golden brown yarn with speckles of cream and black for a new cowl, which he intended on giving Arthur, into a broom patterned project bag. Then, once he’d also stuffed his wallet and order forms into the bag, he layered on his coat, a slouchy beanie, and matching gloves that Hermione had made him years ago. Finally, he grabbed the toy giraffe Portkey that he’d rented the previous night. When he walked back to the living room, Draco was standing near the fireplace, his winter coat buttoned to the top and beanie pulled down tightly to his ears. He looked frustratingly endearing, causing a hot flush to rise to Harry’s cheeks.
He’d paired the jumper with a pair of simple, form fitting black jeans and brown oxfords, not knowing just how formal he was supposed to look. However, he figured it would be better to be overdressed in front of Narcissa Malfoy instead of underdressed.
Harry returned the smile as he grabbed the cheap replacement broom, which he’d bought after losing his Firebolt during the war, off its propped position against the wall. Sliding out of the window, he looked down for a moment to watch all of the wixen passersby. Then, taking a deep breath, he took the leap.
“Hi, Harry! Just changing Teddy’s shirt. We had a little chocolate milk accident,” Andromeda said, her voice coming from the direction of Teddy’s room.
Harry’s heart sank, his mind churning with ideas of who Draco was knitting the hat for. He and Parkinson had always seemed close during school, and he was nearly certain that they’d dated at some point. Perhaps it was a gift for her? Or, if not, some other person lucky enough to call Draco theirs.
Harry nodded. Either he got up now and barely made it onto the train, or he stayed and mustered up the courage to do something.
“Okay,” Draco said, casting a lubrication spell on his right fingers as he knelt in between Harry’s thighs. “I’ll let you know when I’m about to do something, alright?”
He wandered over to his trunk, which sat at the foot of his bed, and put his hand through the handle. Then, after double-checking that he had everything, he made his way out of his living quarters and down the corridor. Before his mind could catch up, he began to wander left, heading towards Draco’s living quarters instead of the Great Hall. He silently chastised himself with every step, trying desperately to convince himself not to descend the stairs that would lead to the dungeons. Yet, that’s exactly what he found himself doing, his footsteps echoing loudly against the cobblestone floors. The rest of the castle was silent, the air eerily still.
Harry could feel heat rising to his cheeks. “Oh. Thanks.”
