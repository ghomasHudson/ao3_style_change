Potter himself had been completely ignoring him since the incident in the closet, and luckily no gossip had spread around the school. If they passed each other in the halls, Potter didn’t even make the effort to give him a wary glance anymore. He just kept walking, refusing to even acknowledge Draco’s presence. In their faculty meeting, Potter had ignored him until they were obligated to team up together to brainstorm new classroom layouts for the following term. Potter had conversed with him minimally, only for the purpose of the exercise, and then went back to completely ignoring him. Draco found that he didn’t like it at all. He far preferred the first couple of weeks, during which Potter had at least bothered to engage in playful banter or lecture him. Now it was as if Draco didn’t exist. Potter was determined to give him the silent treatment. Like a child. No, this was far worse than when they were children. Draco didn’t like it at all.
As expected, a house elf was waiting for him in the Hogwarts keep. “Are you Mr. Malfoy, sir?” The house elf asked meekly. Draco nodded. “Please follow me, Mr. Malfoy, sir.”
. Usually it was just the collision of flailing limbs when, say, struggling to steal his wand. Or a frustrated punch to the shoulder when Draco had said something terrible. Or casting dark curses when they were trying to, quite literally, torture each other. He and Potter didn't exactly have a peaceful history. Maybe they could be "not enemies," but could they ever truly escape being
“I wonder if we can...come here.” Draco crossed the pit toward Potter, who was getting on his hands and knees in the dirt. “Mount me.”
" Harry said softly. "That’s the problem. I want more than an incredible wank in a changing room. I want
Draco gripped his father’s bedpost to support himself. He saw the portrait of his father as a young man hanging on the wall, and then glanced away only to see himself in his father’s mirror. A small sob escaped him, and he finally stopped trying to fight his emotions. He curled up on his father’s bed and allowed himself to
Draco raised his eyebrows, feeling genuinely surprised. A Slytherin Potter-Weasel who had an advanced knowledge of Potions
Draco groaned at the intrusion. He had been fully content to grind against Harry through his trousers until they both came like teenagers, thankyouverymuch.
to return to Hogwarts at all. The only reason he was sitting on the Hogwarts Express was because Hogwarts was the last possible place that contained it: The Fountain of Youth. And he had to find it. Because if he found it, it would be such a monumental discovery that it would make his career. It would undoubtedly wash away his past. He would no longer be known as Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. He would be known as the man who discovered The Fountain of Youth. And then, he would go abroad again to make some other brilliant discovery and find respect all over again.
Harry’s brows drew together, his face all severity and tight lines, any lingering dreaminess gone. Draco instantly realized his mistake.
Draco stepped outside of Harry's bed curtains, internally debating how long it would take for a hormonal teenager to finish a wank and where else he should wander in the meantime. All of his thoughts abruptly stopped when he heard Potter softly moan a single word behind him.
"They're safe," Draco assured Harry, not lifting his mouth from Harry's skin. "James, Albus, Lily. They're all safe."
After they had crossed the moat and were well outside of hearing range from anyone near the castle, Potter muttered, “I can handle this myself, Malfoy.”
Potter. Yet, inevitably, he sometimes thought about how desperately he had wanted Potter to take his hand on the train when they first met. He thought about the way Potter adamantly defended his family at the trials, saying things like, “The Malfoys are innocent, and were simply swept up in events beyond their control.” Or when the prosecutor was questioning Potter about the murder of Albus Dumbledore with sly words, and Potter had interrupted him in a fury, saying, “You’re twisting the question, sir. Draco didn’t do anything wrong, nor was he going to. I know because I was there.” And the way Potter had looked at Draco--right at him--when he added, “Draco has a good heart. If he did anything that night, it was change the course of history and allow me to win the war.” And how it had made something in Draco melt a little.
Something dark, possessive, and dangerous coiled inside of Draco then, growing rapidly until it was a ball of hellish rage. He wove that fury into himself until he felt its powerful magic pooling in his veins. If rage was magic, this Death Eater would already be dead.
there weren’t detailed lists. Draco was only left with a single lead. The people at Carter’s estate had explained that in his lifetime, Carter had donated all of his discoveries to two major organizations: the National Museum of Wizarding Artifacts in London, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his alma mater. And Draco had already been to London.
It had been fifteen long years since Draco had last seen it. Yet there it was, just the same as he remembered and coming into view: the dark silhouette of Hogwarts, its castle towers stabbing into a red sky. It was a most appropriate colour, seeing as it had been slick with death the last time he had seen it.
He and Harry stared at each other in the dark, a million unspoken things between them, until Draco's eyelids grew heavy.
Healer Victoria sat in a small wooden chair by the fireplace with her hands politely folded over one knee. She gave a few judgmental glances toward the fountain of vermouth, still bubbling with full strength on the floor beside her.
In its place, was a new book, however. Again the clone started at the beginning and spent most of that night pouring over the theory of Alchemy.
A loud sound startled the clone out of his retreat. Voldemort had twisted himself into a state; so wound up he seemed to lose his ability to speak. A high-pitched whine, like the whistling of the winter wind through bare branches, disturbed him. The noise was more unnerving than the tantrum. Out of control, the phantom rocketed around the room, gaining speed and volume as he went.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Andi said with a smile and a kiss on the cheek when Harry was back on his feet.
Also a small snippet in the corner about a WNN interview with the couple by Lee Jordan featuring a photo of the pair in headsets on the air, laughing and dressed in t-shirts.
The book and the clothes, had they been his? They had felt like possessions, like they were something he had control over. But they hadn't been, not really.
“I’m sorry, love,” Harry said as he stood and lifted Draco’s head enough to slide onto the sofa, then lowered it into his lap. He touched Draco’s forehead and noted the perspiration there. He took in the paler than usual skin tone, and the way Draco’s arms were around his midsection. “Have you eaten anything today?”
“Something's wrong,” Draco said, his voice slightly panicked. “I’m so sick all the time and much more exhausted than before, and I’m huge and it’s still so early compared to last time.”
“I will be,” Harry replied, his voice hoarse from screaming and his throat raw. “I’ve never lost control like that, I…” He had no idea how to even finish that sentence so he didn’t.

Harry’s personal favorite was a bo staff. Spelled to expand out from a small one-foot long handle, the smooth six-foot weapon in Harry’s hands became an extension of his arm. The length allowed him to knock attackers unconscious who were well out of normal reach.
“Here they are, Scorpius, your sisters. This is Lily in the purple blanket and Narcissa in the yellow one.”
Switching topics again, you need to be more careful. You left a mark on me. Minerva noticed and asked if I was seeing someone and reminded me that if I was, I was welcome to bring them back to my rooms as long as, and I quote, ”the lady and I could be discreet and professional around students, and she passed a ministry background check for the safety of the children.” I shot tea out of my nose, and I think I turned so red the mark just blended in at that point. Luckily, (unluckily? I can’t decide) Sybill interrupted, pointing out that marks that appear on the body have different meanings and omens based on their location. She then spent 10 minutes trying to decide if it was technically on my neck or my shoulder as she poked and examined it while I tried to bat her off to no avail. Say, Harry, did you know that a mark on the right side of your neck portends auspicious events in your home, but a mark on the right shoulder means unpleasant news? Because I do now! Thanks, ever so. Oh, and guess where she decided, in the end, the mark was? Merlin, I hope she’s wrong and it’s the neck. Somebody please kill me. I thought once I was an adult my days of being embarrassed about hickies would be over…
“More than I can say, more than I ever thought I would be,” Harry admitted, his smile content as he looked out over his family and friends.
No one dared suggest Voldemort's ideas were anything less than brilliant. Any hint at such a thing often led to death and dismemberment, which may have been where they got all the extra corpses. No, everyone agreed the fault must lie with someone else.
“There’s too many. We’ve got to get out of here!” Cedric yelled over the sound of the world falling down around them.
Harry sat, like most nights since the Malfoys had moved in, buried in his big overstuffed chair by the fire. He wasn’t sure why tonight felt different, only that it did. He watched the flames lick the wood, scarring the exterior before slowly infiltrating and systematically destroying the once sturdy wood until it was nothing but ash. Harry wondered if there was a lesson there, for him, about the outcome of all of this shit in his head that kept him from sleeping well and had him on edge in general. Hermione’s gentle suggestion earlier that he consider a mind healer had sent him into a rage, which had sent his strong-willed best friend into a frustrated rage of her own, one which had started off with her reminding him that they loved him and wanted to help, and gone straight through to what a selfish arse he was being about this whole thing, and after that she’d flounced off through the Floo in trademark Granger fashion. At the time, he’d felt a bit justified but now, in the calm of the evening, he just felt hollow and broken. Still angry because, fuck, that feeling rarely left anymore, but mostly just sad and empty.
Harry wore a traditional Muggle black tuxedo with a starched white shirt underneath. Instead of a waistcoat, he wore a scarlet sash and crisp bow tie--not a bright, clownish scarlet, but a much richer, deeper colour. And over that, he wore a matching scarlet satin robe that exquisitely captured the light and shadow of the room as it rolled around him; the robe was perfectly fitted at Harry's arms and shoulders, yet the remaining floorlength fabric billowed so openly behind him as he walked that it was more reminiscent of a lightweight cloak or cape. Harry’s dark hair was slicked back and slightly to the side, and by some miracle it was actually
Then, with his mouth against Harry’s hair, an arm nestled around Harry’s back, and the water still running, Draco drifted to sleep.
it to life, and hoping that these Death Eaters wouldn't question it. The dead, unmoving Mark shivered into motion, writhing beneath the tip of his wand.
Granger completely ignored him. “Oh, that’s it! Opportunities.” Granger lifted a finger and moved it as if she were skimming through the contents of a book. “It’s the Fountain of Scouth,” she nodded proudly.
was because, as Harry himself had pointed out, they were probably the last two people on earth who would accept each other for who they were, rather than what they'd
Draco sighed and left, the tinkling bell mocking him on his way out. If every clothier was booked, then the decision was made for him. Draco would not be reentering society. Not that night, at least. ...Not that he had considered it. Because the reason for stepping into the shop in the first place had simply been to obtain some new dress robes before leaving for Cairo.
Draco’s neck snapped back around with renewed curiosity, his eyes focused on the fabric of Harry's bed curtains, his ears alert. Had Potter just said what he thought he'd said?
was supposed to be the one doing the smirking. Yet Potter was on top of him with his eyes ablaze, smirking that arrogant little smirk because he had just made Draco’s cock twitch, looking
When Harry slid his mouth back to the tip, added suction, and moved back down again, Draco fell completely back against the tile, the thin pool of water splashing beneath his weight as his strength left him. Harry moved up again and swirled his tongue around the tip of his cock, gently kissing and sucking. Then Harry pushed forward and nearly swallowed Draco’s cock whole.
“Oh!” Draco sat back up so quickly that he nearly dragged Harry with him. “So this whole time I was assuming that these were strictly wizarding hieroglyphs, but I'm no longer sure that's the case. I think they may be a combination of Muggle Egyptian hieroglyphs and Wizarding Egyptian hieroglyphs." Draco picked up a photograph, magically easing out the creases that he and Harry had accidentally put into them.
. He hated the way Cornelius’ slender hips swayed as he moved about the caravan, and the way he always walked around the caravan after a shower with dripping wet hair and no shirt to speak of.
"Let's try this again, Potter," Draco sighed, trying to bring Harry's focus back to the waltz. If Harry stopped looking at him like that, Draco would be less tempted to fall to his knees at Harry's feet and pour his entire heart out. "One, two, and --"
Well over an hour later, Draco and Harry sat together on the edge of a fountain in the palace gardens, still answering Longbottom's questions about what had happened so he could complete his Auror paperwork. Draco had been staring at the same cluster of flowered topiary for what felt like forever, but he was still stunned by the beauty of the pink and yellow blooms as the fountain trickled majestically behind them. At least endlessly staring at the same patch of flowers was preferable to staring at the repellent fashion choices made by some of the Aurors and reporters.
“Can you explain to me,” Potter said, almost squirming with his obvious desire to tackle Draco to the floor, “why you transported a failed antidote potion onto my son’s pillow?”
“I need to catch a portkey to Cairo on the morning of May Second in London, but it just so happens that all of the hotels are completely booked for the celebration. I overheard Weasley say that you had reserved a section of rooms specifically for Hogwarts staff. Do you have anything left for the night of May First?”
Saliva wasn’t nearly enough, especially not for Harry’s first time, so Draco cast a quiet spell to properly lube up his second finger before he slowly inched it alongside the first. Harry moaned and his cock throbbed in Draco’s mouth. Draco pulled away, worried that Harry was going to come before he wanted him to. Draco began to scissor his fingers apart, and Harry gripped the sheets tightly in his fists.
“Of course,” Harry said. Before Cornelius could actually form a question, however, Harry continued. “Shall I tell you about my night with
no matter how impossible a situation seemed. Draco swallowed tightly. This Dumbledore was chatting with Professor McGonagall about the welfare of the students with dementors floating about.
Draco was staring out his window the following Sunday evening, contemplating any additional research he could finish while still at Hogwarts, when there was a faint knock on his door. He pulled his attention from the snow and checked to make sure that his shirt and robes were fully buttoned.
Potter abandoned the last two buttons of Draco's shirt and brought their mouths back together. Draco moaned pitifully and summoned the entirety of his willpower. Before he could change his mind, he pressed a hand to Potter’s chest and pushed until their lips parted and Potter was kneeling. “Wait,” he repeated, scooting himself upright, his erection tight against his trousers.
“Well then,” she said, sliding Draco’s tea toward him and folding her hands around her teacup. Draco tensed, waiting for her to begin lecturing him about why we don’t apparate failed potions onto students’ pillows, but was pleasantly surprised when she simply said, “Tell me about Siberia.”
“No,” Draco said shakily, and then took a breath and straightened his shoulders, pushing down the feelings of rejection and vulnerability welling up inside of him and shielding himself in the cold familiarity of the old Draco Malfoy. “No, Weasley,” he sighed, smoothing back his hair. “I’ve lost my appetite.” He spun down the hall, casting a cleaning charm over his shoulder at the food on the floor and flung the bloodied handkerchief over his shoulder.
Harry was protective of his children, Draco knew. He was a good father. Harry was afraid to lose more people he loved, he’d made that much very clear, and that fear extended to his children most of all. Draco hadn't
Draco took a breath. There was no need to panic. It was entirely possible that Lily and Albus were perfectly safe.
, lots of our classmates had, but that article confirmed it. I lost a bit of a bet with Ron over it, actually. How long ago was that now? Merlin, it...”
“Malfoy?” Another Death Eater asked--this one Draco had actually seen during the war. “I should kill you right now. Traitor.”
And then there was Potter himself. His entire face was flushed crimson as he blinked awkwardly, breathing hot on Draco’s face with atrocious morning breath in his hideous pyjamas. He had crust at the edges of his eyes and hair that defied gravity, and he was undoubtedly the most beautiful thing Draco had ever seen.
“Do you have anything to say for yourself, Mr. Potter?” Draco asked. He couldn’t bring himself to simply say
She took his hand and shook it. “Are you sure you have to leave? The students have been thriving under your tutelage. I can’t believe how much Albus has come out of his shell, and--”
best good-morning kiss of Draco's life. Draco moaned and pressed his growing erection into Harry’s hip as Harry broke the kiss to glance at the clock. “Do you think we have time to…?”
Draco didn’t really know what to do. An apology didn’t really seem fitting. He could pat Albus comfortingly on the shoulder, but didn’t want it to seem pitying or condescending. Instead, he continued to sit beside Albus in silence, watching the three silhouettes above the Quidditch pitch. Finally, as he moved to stand up, he said, “If you ever want more of a Potions challenge than what you’re getting in class, come see me. I’d be happy to tutor you personally.”
Draco’s eyes lifted to Potter, who was still hovering in the air in his Quidditch gear and looking very much like sex on a broomstick. “I’ll dirty my robes,” was all he could think of saying.
“I’m tempted to cast an Incendio and put it out of its misery. It’s not even worth sitting on. There is not a single place to sit on this sofa that doesn’t bring about physical pain. Believe me, I’ve tried.” Potter lightly bounced up and down on another area of the sofa and grimaced. “I would’ve expected better from a place that looks this posh.”
“Oh!” she said, sounding a little surprised as she batted her smiling eyes. “Oh, of course, Mr. Malfoy. I had the pleasure of working with your father.” The...
Potter. He could face a train full of screaming children. He could face Granger, who had every reason to despise him. But somehow the thought of facing Potter was so much worse. So much harder. He hadn’t actually seen Potter since the trials, and even then they hadn’t spoken directly. Come to think of it, they hadn’t actually
Granger sighed and put her fingers together, then pressed them against her chin as she leaned back in her chair. “Your first priority is your students,” she finally said.
Draco must have drifted to sleep, because the urgent knocking on his door sounded distant at first. And there it was again, loud and impatient against his door. “Come in!” he shouted, sitting up and trying to will himself awake. He looked up at the clock. The doorknob wiggled, and then the knocking resumed.
When Draco entered the Grand Ballroom, he could barely see the other side of it. The ballroom felt like it was nearly a kilometre long, and it was filled with people. Everyone wore their finest robes. The room shimmered with glamourous fashions and warm smiles. At the far end of the room there were steps leading up to a platform where members of the Ministry sat like kings and queens. Even with all of his practice identifying Harry from a distance on the battlements, he couldn't quite tell if Harry was among them.
Draco was already so on edge that when Harry began to come and the pressure tightened impossibly around Draco’s cock, Draco couldn’t hold back. With two more thrusts he came, still buried deep inside of Harry.
“Therefore, if you believe the potions should be out of your system within 24 hours, you are only allowed to ingest these potions--careful to consider the appropriate amounts, mind you--on the weekends, between Friday and Saturday evening, so that you have some time to recover before class on Monday. Is that clear?”
It was late, but not late enough to discourage Draco from doing a little exploring. He felt fairly confident that the Room of Requirement had been completely incinerated, so that would be of no use to him. Instead, he thought it would be best to head to the main dungeons. All sorts of things ended up beneath Hogwarts, from giant man-eating basilisks to priceless archaeological artifacts. One of these days he would really need to have a talk with the new librarian about the proper care of crumbling artifacts and the importance of humidity control. It was embarrassing.
“And how are you going to do that, exactly?” Harry cocked his mouth into a sly, sexy little smirk against his pillow, and Draco knew he had to do something drastic before he fucking lost his mind.
Potter shifted uncomfortably, blushing a little. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea--” he cleared his throat. “I have patrol, and...” he murmured something completely unintelligible.
The scars of Potter’s Sectumsempra were still there, of course--three pale, puckered lines like a long, disconnected backward Z from the spell that had brutally sliced Draco open. The first line slanted from the ball of his left shoulder across the span of his chest. The second, at a sharper angle, began near his right armpit, crossed through the first scar and spanned down to his lower left ribs. The third, separate from the other two, began an inch to the right of his naval and curved around to his side and into the top of his pelvis. Potter gingerly lifted a hand and pressed his fingers to the thick puckered edge of the first scar at his shoulder. “Draco,” he whispered, his voice all pity and regret. Draco rolled his eyes and tried to squirm away again, but Potter pushed him forcefully back against the wall and straddled him, sitting his weight on Draco’s legs so that Draco was now the one pressed between
been that happy? Ever? He couldn’t remember. He’d been running from his past for so long, passing the nights with sleeping draughts, focusing on research for so long, he couldn’t remember the last time he had been happy. Cornelius had lightened his heart a little before he broke it, but it had never been enough to make him feel really, truly happy. Draco watched Potter with a new sort of envy. After all these years, he still wanted what Potter had. He wanted joy. And far worse: a tickling part of the back of his brain said that he wanted that joy with Potter.
After a Friday class in late September, Draco decided it was time to start searching for the Potions Storage Library. He went back to the dungeon trapdoor and opened it without any interference from a particular Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. When he reached the bottom of the narrow stone steps, he cast a Lumos spell, but the darkness around him was so intense that it hardly did any good. “Lox!” Draco cast into the room, and five small balls of white light, each blazing like an afternoon sun, flew from the tip of his wand toward the ceiling, illuminating the entire room. This spell would have been very convenient when he had last explored the dungeons as a boy, he thought. Now, this spell was one of his staples. He didn’t know how he could have explored any tombs without it.
“Neither did I, to be honest. But these aren’t your usual potions, either.” Draco told him about his discovery and his new potion experiments.
Instead, he studied all of the things that both had and hadn’t changed since Dumbledore’s time. McGonagall’s portrait was right next to Dumbledore’s and Snape’s on the wall closest to Granger’s desk. Granger had to be one of the youngest leaders of Hogwarts in history, but it suited her. She had always been an excellent scholar; Draco had never, at least internally, denied that much.
When Friday night arrived, Draco could hardly wait to begin. He was a little nervous, but mostly filled with excitement. Experimenting on himself was reckless and certainly not ideal, but it meant that he would know the effects of all potions within a couple of months. Rats could easily take years.
There was an abrupt knock on the door and Draco fell away, cheeks flushed and breathing hard. Harry cleared his throat and opened the door. Draco crossed the room and began pacing by the window, his black robes still clinging tightly to him, hanging in pieces at his left arm.
"Draco," Harry whined. His dark brows furrowed as he breathed heavily and unevenly through his nose.
Draco dropped his bag against the sofa and sat down. On closer inspection, the sofa was not as comfortable as it appeared to be. The cushions sank deeply into it, causing a sharp slab of wood to dig into one’s bum, or back, or whatever body part one was attempting to relax with. Draco had intended to take the sofa merely to avoid sharing a bed with Harry, but that option was looking highly unpleasant.
make better enemies. It was certainly starting to feel that way. They fit in all the wrong places. Draco preferred to shield his emotions behind insults and a harsh facade, while Potter preferred openness and honesty and the occasional angry outburst. ...Nevermind that Potter seemed to be the one person who managed to consistently see
“That’s just perfect,” he murmured to himself, leaning against the wall as he stared at the curling yellowed potion labels. He began sorting through them, turning them in circles so that he could see them from all angles. He found seven different potions that had a barely legible
He wriggled out of his robes, took a small sip of vermouth and leaned back onto his pillows, trying to relax. He was still wearing a black silk shirt with silver braces and pale grey trousers, so he rolled his shoulders, taking a moment to appreciate that glorious silk-on-silk feeling. He tried to forget about the night before. He tried to ignore the fact that he could still smell Potter in his bed. Taste Potter’s skin, his scar in his mouth. Taste that tingling golden heat. He shook the thoughts from his head and closed his eyes. It was the weekend. He was determined
Merlin, Potter was actually letting him go through with this. Draco brushed a thumb over one of Harry's nipples as he traced his tongue along the top of Harry’s spine, involuntarily thrusting his hips once against Harry's lower back. Soon Harry was bucking up into his hand, his chest heaving as he gasped for breath. Draco bit down at the base of Harry’s neck and
a mansion, technically, but that was another matter entirely. It was far easier to keep his life simple, since he was constantly packing it away.
mercy, hmm? I've read about this mind-blowing thing you can do with magic during sex that may or may not be illegal in several countries."
Granger was only free to help Draco with his potions once per month, but Draco was happy to have any assistance at all. In January they discovered the Fountain of Sleuth (that was Potion Five, which greatly heightened the mystery-solving senses of the consumer). In some ways, the potion was similar to Felix Felicis. It turned out to be quite helpful in discovering a small lead as to why there were dementors on school grounds. Under the potion's effects, Draco felt a sudden need to travel to the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where they had first seen the Dark Mark in the sky. There, hidden under some leaves in the snow, was a small, round object no bigger than a marble. After doing additional research, he and Granger discovered that it was a very rare magical artifact that functioned as a magical holding cell for dementors. Draco could only surmise that it had been dropped by whomever had cast the Dark Mark in the first place. Perhaps they had intended to unleash dementors that same night, and something had gone wrong. Or perhaps dropping the artifact had been an accident. They may have found one answer, but it created a multitude of new, unanswerable questions.
When they arrived in London, Draco silently followed the Hogwarts crowd to the hotel. It was a very nice hotel. Draco wasn't sure why he hadn't thought about it before, but
Really, Potter was an absolute slob--what did Draco see in him? Nothing. Obviously. He couldn’t see anything in someone who was such a slob, even if it
Potter looked pained, and then slowly held the wand back out to Draco. “I mean. I guess you can have it back. If you want. I’ve just...right. I mean it
golden now, sun-stained from his years of outdoor work. He couldn’t remember when he had grown his hair out exactly; it was sometime after his father had died. He found that he liked pulling it back into a messy bun during a dig to keep it securely out of his face. His skin was a little more sun-tanned as well, although his time at the museum in London had already started him back on the path to pale. He lifted his dark dragon-leather satchel over a shoulder and stepped off the train, feeling like a giant as children eagerly scurried around him.
. Everything felt wrong, except you.” Potter jerked back, apparently realizing what he just said. “Yours! Your wand I mean!” Potter was clenching his wand like it was a life raft. His face was practically glowing red in the dark.
“Pretend this never happened? Absolutely.” Best that Weaslette not find out, anyway, or she might hex Draco’s bollocks off.
Draco stared, certain that without a lifetime of pureblood etiquette dictating his every movement, his jaw would be hanging open. He couldn’t respond. His mouth had gone completely dry.
Draco smirked, reaching for Harry's wrists and pressing them to the mountain of silk pillows above his head. "Scared, Potter?"
Draco collapsed onto the tile, incapable of moving. “Holy shit,” he breathed at the ceiling, his arms sprawled out beside him.
Draco never would have thought that he could actually have this: a full life. He never thought that he would feel so full and loved, especially after so many years of misery and hardship. He certainly never thought that he could have it with Harry. After everything they had gone through, Draco knew that they would be alright, because they finally had each other. In a way, they'd had each other all along. Draco felt stupidly joyful and way-too-deep in love every morning when he woke up with Harry Potter at his side. It should have been impossible, but it was his life. His delightfully good life.
and not some shadow of a deed I did once.” Potter placed his elbows on his knees, and let his forehead fall into his palms. “Yet you don’t even want to
his trousers. The muscles in his arms were rolling subtly from his movements in the dim light. His head was down, gravity pulling dark hair over his eyes. Draco held his breath as he ran his eyes over Potter’s naked chest, the teasing trail of dark hair disappearing into his trousers.
“But that’s not very nice at all! Don’t worry, Professor, we will see that he is scolded.” Lily turned back to James. “But what did it
Draco moved toward his father’s room. When he opened the master bedroom door, he was overwhelmed by a familiar scent that filled him with nostalgia. The air still contained traces of the scented potions his father once wore. He hadn’t expected that. He hadn’t expected anything of his father to be left in the room--to still be
After another couple of hours, they were all quite drunk--or at least Draco was--and the crowd had begun clearing out. There were only a few old men left in the corner.
"Draco," Harry whispered fondly. He was still halfway across the room when he brought his hands together at his chest and then parted them rapidly. Draco’s shirt and waistcoat ripped open down the middle, buttons exploding this way and that. Draco felt all of his clothing, robe and all, being forced down his shoulders.
less indecent. Granger was wearing a tasteful, flowing purple robe that just barely touched the floor. “For the same reason you are, Granger,” Draco said, pointing upward.
A slow and steady dripping broke the silence that followed. The rain had arrived, leaving dark stains in the dirt. One plump drop spattered against Draco’s temple before the rain fully began pelting against him. Draco leaned back against the dirt wall, breathing heavily. He had never said anything like that aloud to anyone before. Yet, overcome with anger, he had somehow been able to tell
him. He had never felt so elated and terrified in his bloody life. In one swift movement Draco pulled Harry’s mouth to his and rolled Harry onto his back.
, more than anyone, how James can be. He’s as overconfident as I was when I was that age, and hasn’t made a mistake big enough to question himself yet,” Potter said. “Most people
As it so happened, Potter wasn’t asleep. With one arm still over his face, Potter’s free hand slipped into his trousers.
, and anyone I let into my life abandons me as soon as they find out about my Mark.” Draco looked Potter straight in the eye, breathless and shaking. “I have no one.
all too willing to look the other way if he misbehaves, so believe it or not, I appreciate your efforts. Sometimes he can be a git, but he’s my git, and I’m sorry if he--that he--” Draco could hear Potter scratching his head in the dark. “Well you may be in for a difficult year. I’m afraid he wasn’t very fond of you, even before you became the Potions Master--”
“When I was attempting to make an antidote for you, I...well, look.” She slid her notes across the table toward him, and he studied them. The contents of Potion Eight reacted in perfect opposition with the contents of Potion Seven. They hadn’t found the Fountain of Youth at all. They had just been lucky enough to find the antidote to Potion Seven--or perhaps antidote wasn’t the right word. Since he still wasn’t sure that Potion Seven was intended for human consumption at all, it was possible that Potion Eight was intended to simply undo its effects.
again, wasn’t he? Standing so miserably close with his stupid miserable face. Potter’s biceps clenched through his pyjamas beneath Draco’s hands, and Draco tried very hard not to squeeze.
proving a point. He had a theory and he was proving it. Luckily, Cornelius didn’t seem to mind. A few minutes later, flushed and feeling rather drunk as Draco returned to the forest, he realized that he still had dirt on his palms.
, for Merlin's sake. Draco cleared his throat and tried to gain some composure. “You’re sure about this, Potter?" Draco murmured. "If I take your hand--you do know what that
Draco sat in the hotel lobby and admired his surroundings while Granger talked to the hotel receptionist. Everywhere he looked, there were gilded mirrors and candelabras and fancy chandeliers and sofas with clawed feet. At one time in his life, this style of living was to be expected. It was normal. Anything less had been deplorable. Now he took in the sights, enjoying the colours and architecture as the treasures they were. When the Hogwarts crowd started moving again, Draco was on his feet. Some lingering faculty members drifted away with keys in their hands, but Draco wasn’t in any hurry to get his. He was enjoying the scenery. He was enjoying his last few moments in good company.
Draco knew it was stupid. He knew it was stupid and completely irresponsible. But right now, he felt empty and pained and just wanted to feel something else. He had three hours to kill anyway. He lifted the potion and allowed one tiny drop to fall onto his tongue. One. The smallest dose possible. The effects, if he felt them at all, would barely last for a few hours. In theory.
“Try me. You’ll be dead before your spell can fall.” With the hand in front of his chest, Draco signaled: One. Two.
Internally, Draco laughed. Outwardly, he frowned. “Because your son refused to follow simple instructions. He misbehaved in class. I requested that he clean his mess before he left, and he didn’t. Thus,” Draco waved his hand through the air, as if the conclusion should be obvious.
Speaking of which: Was dinner that night going to be a formal affair? No one had said. No one had said what time dinner was, either.
it even. The crowd had parted enough for Draco to see a dozen Death Eaters near the entrance of the Grand Ballroom. Draco's stomach curled in on itself when he saw several bodies sprawled across the floor near the entrance. The poor witches and wizards had probably been caught too off-guard or shocked to even think to defend themselves. Draco could only hope they were still alive.
Potter out of his bed, but he wasn’t fast enough. Potter had already cast his wandless, silent Accio and Draco’s wand was in Harry's hand. Why did Harry always have to steal his bloody wands?
Potter hurled himself upright on his elbows, gasping, his eyes wide and his face barely a foot from Draco’s. Draco saw that Potter was having this same realization. And saw Potter realize that Draco was realizing it. Potter’s attempt to lift his face had only served to put more weight in the lower half of his body, pressing their erect cocks even tighter together, adding friction as Potter shifted. The heat, the friction--it felt so
Surprisingly, the celebration had roared back to life shortly after the Death Eaters were dealt with. No one could argue that the Wizarding World didn’t know the true meaning of
“Of course. You do...remember him?” Granger asked cautiously. Remember him? How the hell could anyone forget Harry bloody Potter? But more importantly--Potter
Draco began pacing on the battlements, watching Potter below. He fully expected to see James run out to his father and tell him everything, but the moment never came.
It was never particularly obvious; it was in a supportive hand against a back. A gentle word. A softening of the eyes.
“Sorry about your breakfast, mate,” Weasley said, looking at the spilled pastry and pumpkin juice. “Want me to fetch you something else?”
The palace was quiet as Draco made his way toward the throne room. Dimly lit candelabras flickered against the walls, barely illuminating giant paintings. Once he arrived at the entrance, he saw two more Death Eaters inside, taking turns sitting on the throne rather than working on the wards. Merlin, they couldn’t even do their
When Draco had lined his shelves with sleeping draughts, he tried to find the Room of Requirement. Just to see if he could.
sorry for...that night. I just...I’m scared, honestly. I’ve never really been with a man before, and I don’t have the slightest idea what I’m doing."
Harry dolefully nodded twice, tightening his hand over Draco’s as they looked up at the bursts of light sparkling across the sky.
“Oh. Er--I guess you drew the short straw then?” Potter glanced nervously sideways. Draco followed Potter’s gaze to see Weasley, who was waiting for their shots and grinning like this was the funniest fucking thing he had ever seen in his life.
there were dementors on Hogwarts grounds, but Granger was a ball of anxiety. It was the week before Christmas holiday and everyone's schedules were booked, but she dragged half of the staff outside to cast
As Halloween approached, the students were noticeably gleeful, which meant even more botched potions than usual. Draco found himself detracting points from Houses left and right. ...Except for Slytherin, of course. Slytherin students were always the height of academic excellence. And Lily Luna. She was always smiling brightly, and saying, “Yes Professor Malfoy,” and “No, Professor Malfoy,” and he found that he hadn’t the heart to detract points from her even when she spilled her cauldron while attempting a Cure for Boils. This, of course, turned out to be a mistake, because when she smilingly asked for help on her next potion, two of her Gryffindor friends placed a croaking pinecone on Draco’s chair. She was sneaky. Smiley and sneaky and just as adventurously mischievous as every Gryffindor in existence. ...Except worse, because she hid perfectly under the guise of innocence until it was too late. And even then, he hadn’t detracted any points, because her cunning was so...well,
After his final class had finished, Draco packed his clothes and research supplies. He didn't own very much; it made traveling easier. Well, he
Draco closed the door to the Slytherin toilets. Opened it again. And walked right back into his bedroom. Whatever this was, it seemed to be distinctly tied to his room. And at this rate, the vermouth was making him so drowsy that he was getting too tired to care about late-night students walking into his room. He cast protective wards over all of his belongings, cast cushioning charms on all of his walls so that no students would injure themselves by falling into his room from odd angles, set up several ladders throughout the room in case any students needed to get back into the ceiling, and crawled into his bed. He threw his robe and black leather gauntlet toward a chair, let his hair down, flicked his bedcurtains closed with his wand, crawled under his covers, and shimmied out of his clothes. He made small snow angels in his sheets. Silk, silk, silk on his bare skin. This felt right. Now he could finally sleep.
Draco swooped down, landing a little more roughly than he had intended to, but managed to stay on his feet. “Later, Weasel,” Draco called as he tossed the broom on the green beside him.
“No, Professor, that’s the thing. My dad hasn’t been able to cast a Patronus since my mom died. It’s one of the reasons he left the Aurors. You
Draco didn’t bother to let him finish before he pulled him into another breathtaking kiss. They were on a tight schedule, after all. Best not waste a second of it.
conjure the frogs right in his bedroom. Draco took a step, but lost his balance and stumbled against his desk. “Go jump in the lake!” he yelled toward the door. But he still heard
to lift Potter through the door and float him gently back to his bedroom floor, trying desperately not to stare at Potter’s shapely bum in the process.
. Any lingering doubt in Draco’s mind bloomed fully into joy. He could feel tears, obnoxiously pesky things, threatening to well up in his eyes as he smiled. Draco willed them away. He would not
it, Potter. Like you feel a Patronus. Like you feel a broom.” Before Draco could consider the consequences, he tapped his bare, uncovered wrist to Harry's for just the briefest surge of golden light. "Like you feel
Draco spent his time teaching, trying not to let Potter or his children drive him to madness, and doing his best to avoid direct contact with Potter. He still kept an eye on him from the battlements, but that was more for school
“Out!” Draco yelled, allowing his head to come crashing back onto his pillow, the enchantment between him and Potter--thank Merlin for small miracles--broken. One more minute, and he almost assuredly would have been snogging Harry Potter, Lifelong Archenemy of Draco Malfoy and Saviour of the Wizarding World. What the bloody hell had he been thinking?
“Oh, Malfoy, c’mon,” Potter tugged at Draco’s sleeve. “Say it. Just once. You know you missed me.” Draco decided that either he also brought out the inner teen-aged boy in Potter, or Potter was perpetually a teen-aged boy. It was too early to tell.
. If he found something he liked, what was the harm in buying some new robes before he left London? He stepped inside. The tailor was measuring someone new, and barely looked up as Draco entered. “Do you have any robes that could be ready within the hour?” Draco asked. He may as well travel to Cairo in style. Because that’s all this was for. Cairo.
“Are the two of you...together?” Draco asked, stepping back so that he could see them better. Pansy was wearing emerald robes designed as a fashionable pantsuit; her short, dark hair tightly framed her face. She looked every bit the confident businesswitch Draco always suspected she would become. Greg, on the other hand, looked slim and haggard; clearly Azkaban had not been kind. Still, Greg was smiling genuinely at Draco and wearing robes that, while a little shabby at the edges, still looked perfectly festive.
. It had always been the plan. He intended to see it through. In addition, Draco had convinced himself that the only reason Harry wanted
If it was deadly, at least he was surrounded by people. Surely one of them would notice his imminent demise and call for help.
Draco spent Christmas the way he had spent every Christmas since his parents died: alone. Well, mostly alone. He had never actually
Draco was in the midst of running past a room when he heard cackling voices coming from inside. He abruptly stopped, his fancy boots sliding a little along the smooth palace floors, and then doubled back into the room.
“Really. A talent like yours shouldn’t go to waste. In fact, if you want to stay after class tomorrow I will personally show you how to make an advanced Sleeping Draught.”
more work to do. He spent a couple of days working through some labeling and summoning spells to rule out the possibility of human error. He found ten other possible potion candidates, but none of those potions contained any ingredients listed in his ancient texts either. He returned them to the shelves.
job correctly. Draco crept into the shadows of the doorway. His boots were nearly silent on the thin red carpet that ran down the center of the room. He cast two Expelliarmus spells, one after the other, followed by binding and disillusionment spells.
“I believe we’re going to get started,” Granger began. She began listing general announcements: an update on House Points and a generous donation given to the school from a former student.
He looked at his reflection in the dark glass of his window: his newly purchased black and green robes, his long hair secured with a velvet green ribbon at the back of his neck. A stranger might think he actually looked like a Potions Master, but he didn’t feel like one. He didn’t even feel grown. He felt like a child, as shy and nervous as he had felt when he had first stepped onto this train.
. And Draco knew for a fact that Harry wouldn’t have left the building without every single one of his children. ...Which meant that Harry would still be in the palace, looking for James.
She crossed her legs mid-air and allowed gravity to pull her down onto his bed again. “Sorry,” she said, looking a little embarrassed, “but isn’t it exciting?” She pulled out her wand and began running another round of medical diagnostics. “Nothing is unusual. I mean, you’re still the same age, the same overall health. The only difference is that you drank a potion that had you near
Draco leaned back against the tree, thinking of how he had discovered that trick when trying to intensify his own variety of sleeping potions. He thought of the bottles of them he had left in his rooms--enough to last a week, and then some. It helped him get through the bad nights. The nights when he would dream about the war. It made sense that Potter needed something similar. “You make Sleeping Draught for your dad then?”
But their hands were still touching as they clutched the wand, and they were both smiling hopefully at each other. And that was something.
Draco had managed to compartmentalize Potter completely over the last few months. The Potter box, with all of his Potter emotions, was tucked safely away in a corner of his brain, never to be opened again.
Draco thought of his mother sitting in the sunlight in her little garden in France, how proud and happy she always looked when Draco arrived for tea. “Expecto patronum,” he said a little more clearly. Barely a mist. He was past the pitch now. He was running out of time.
an imposter. How could anyone have wanted him here? How could he have actually been qualified enough for this position? How had he gotten through endless stages of interviews? How--
That week, the school was buzzing with gossip. Where had the Mark come from? Who had cast it? Was someone trying to infiltrate Hogwarts? Was someone trying to kill Harry Potter? Or, in Draco's secret thoughts, was someone else after The Fountain of Youth? They never caught any Death Eaters and they still hadn’t found any answers, but Potter and Granger went back over the grounds, casting a series of strong and complicated protective wards. Draco had offered suggestions, reviewing the spells the Death Eaters were most likely to cast in their attempt to break into the wards, if that had been their intent at all. Potter began patrolling the grounds almost nightly, and Draco often found himself going for walks around the battlements at the same time. To think. Just to think. It had nothing to do with watching Potter from the battlements as he walked the grounds alone. It had nothing to do with a newfound desire to protect him from potential dark wizards who might hurl themselves out of the shadows and try to kill him. Again.
Draco had come prepared this time. He was wearing thin black gloves, which were already drastically helping with the touching situation. Lily skipped back over to her tapestry, and Draco spent most of the lesson explaining the concept of musical beats and measures.
“Draco!” Potter ran into the room and fell to his knees at Draco’s bedside, pressing a warm hand to Draco’s writhing chest in an attempt to still him on the bed so he wouldn’t convulse
. Oh Merlin, what had he gotten himself into? He knew he had to move. He knew he had to get off of this train and move forward to meet the house elf at the base of Hogwarts, just like the note attached to the owl had said. Most professors arrived at least a week before the students arrived, but Draco’s research had gone on just long enough to obligate him to return with the students. And now he was unexpectedly petrified.
“Here.” Draco opened his eyes. Potter was holding out his research journal in one hand and the dropper in the other. Draco balanced the journal on his knee, hastily scribbled the date and
Draco wasn’t sure what to show him, exactly. The war? That might be too intense. Draco ultimately decided to show James the memories of Harry on a broom for the first time, followed by a Quidditch match, and Potter flying from the dragon at the Triwizard Tournament. Maybe he would end with a scene from the Fiendfyre, when Harry saved Draco's life. It had a nice arc to it.
They cast the Patronus simultaneously, and two streams of light shivered from the end of the wand. Harry’s Patronus and Draco’s. ...Except the light wasn’t its usual blue blur; it was gold, and bright, and vivid. Draco felt full and strong, despite the fact that a dark and gruesome hell had opened above their heads. There was magic visibly swirling around their hands, and it should have been impossible. Everything about the two of them should have been impossible, but somehow they had defied the odds.
As he approached the moat, he saw Albus Sirius sitting with his back against a tree. Draco glanced back toward the Quidditch pitch, where Potter was still flying with young Lily and James. For a moment, Draco considered walking right by him. But something about the boy’s solitude, in contrast to the happy game the rest of his family was sharing on the Quidditch pitch, was so painfully familiar that he couldn’t bring himself to simply walk by. Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets and sauntered toward Albus. Albus was wearing his Slytherin robes, and his dark hair was neatly parted to one side. “Not flying?” Draco asked once he was only standing a few feet away.
Draco crashed against the hallway wall, so desperate to stay on his feet that he managed to roll against the wall until it was firmly pressed against his back. He tried to reach for his wand, but it had already been forced out of his hand. Draco's eyes frantically assessed his surroundings as his mind raced to find a new plan.
been looking at Potter like that too? And then his hearing had finally come back, and Granger was calling Potter’s name, and Potter redirected his gaze. “Sorry...er...dragon,” was all he said before crawling under the head table like an undisciplined child--who
Draco had been in the middle of the forest one morning, crouched low and peacefully scraping frosted flora from the dirt floor in order to test its similarities to an ancient specimen of dried Frost Root, when a new and terrifying thought suddenly slammed into his brain. His thoughts often wandered while out doing fieldwork; there was always lots of contemplating and soul searching, that much was normal. But this particular thought? This was something else entirely. He had been reflecting on his feelings toward Cornelius, trying to make sense of the attraction, the anger, the insults. And, to his horror, it dawned on him that he had always felt that way about Harry Potter. Multiplied by one hundred.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant was just as elegant as the rest of the hotel. The scent of fresh bread and grilled vegetables filled the air, and Draco's stomach growled. He'd been been so focused on trying to ignore his attraction to Potter all afternoon that he hadn't realized how hungry he was. ...Or at least he hadn't realized how hungry he was for actual
Potter looked at Draco’s mouth incredulously and stepped closer, his hands coming to either side of Draco’s collar and gripping it tight. “Potter,” Draco warned, pressing his hands to Potter’s ribs as he tried pushing him away, clinging to his last vestiges of sanity. "If you--" But Potter was pulling Draco down to his height, pressing their mouths together more firmly. Draco's stomach flew into his throat. “Mmm,” Draco groaned hopelessly against Potter's lips, instantly forgetting whatever logical thing he had been about to say as his arms slid from Potter’s ribs to wrap around his back, pressing their chests tightly together.
Draco almost laughed. For having no idea what he was doing, Harry had quite expertly sucked his cock. Typical Potter, somehow managing to succeed spectacularly without having the slightest idea what he was doing.
James flew to the other side of the pitch, visibly sulking. Draco remained where he was, determined to keep his distance. He knew exactly how James felt, and knew it was best to just let James be until he worked out his anger. Lily flew over toward James’ side of the pitch, leaving Draco and Potter to watch the other half.
“Thank you, Granger,” Draco smiled, the familiar name flowing off of his tongue with a far greater deal of appreciation than ever before. “Headmistress,” he corrected.
“When I opened my wardrobe I was thinking about all of the things I had to accomplish today. What were you thinking about, Harry? When you fell in here?”
hands this time, and pulled them back into that tiny, dark broom closet. “Do you have any idea what your female hatchling said to me today? She strongly implied, or may as well have said...”
Fuck all, maybe Potter was right. Maybe, in some bizarre twist of fate, after a lifetime of contempt and rivalry between them, Potter was now the last person he had left in the entire world. The last person who wouldn’t abandon him for his Mark, because he already
“I wanted to remind all of you,” Granger began. “That the term will finish unusually early next week, so that students can join their families at the Victory over Voldemort celebration in London. Are there any questions or concerns?”
“Not when everyone is trying to kill you or disarm you so they can get their hands on the most powerful wand in the world.”
Draco swallowed and took a large step backward before he could do anything stupid, and Potter’s hand quickly lifted from his waist and was rustling in his own hair. “How was that, Weasel?” Draco looked over at Weasley, whose smile had gone a little crooked, and his whole head was craned sideways so that he looked like a confused dog.
...Then why was this so hard? Why was there such a tightness swelling up in his throat? Why did he feel like he was being ripped open and
“Quite." Draco briefly pulled a stopwatch from his waistcoat and glanced at the time. "Well. Shall we go to dinner, 'Grand Guest of Honour?' Don't want to keep your fans waiting.” Draco bowed and exaggeratedly offered his arm as a joke. When Harry stood and actually wove their arms together, however, it didn’t feel like a joke at all. It felt perfect.
As the night wore on, Draco found that he actually enjoyed banter with Weasley. He enjoyed sitting at a bar next to Potter, their elbows accidentally brushing sometimes beneath the fabric of their shirts. He enjoyed the way Potter would look back at him if he hadn’t said anything in a while, as if making sure he was still there.
. Draco gave a boyish giggle. He didn’t even know that was a spell that could be cast. On the whole, that had been an excellent shirt and Draco didn’t even
allowed himself to do what he had been dreaming of doing since that first night in the Great Hall. “Prudish?!” Draco ran his finger along the skin he found there, pushing his finger beneath the fabric to pull at Harry’s bare thigh. He pulled his fingers out again and placed a hand on either of Harry’s legs, scraping along Harry's thighs over his trousers. At the same time, Draco traced his tongue over the top of Harry’s shoulder, smiling when Harry’s trousers tightened at the crotch. Harry’s breath was already ragged by the time Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's hips and began unbuttoning his trousers. “Prudish, am I?”
Harry hummed and adjusted, digging his fingers into Draco's thighs as he dragged them over his shoulders until Draco was arching sharply off the bed, supported by his silk pillows. “Draco Malfoy thinks I’m brilliant?” Harry pressed his nose against Draco's scrotum and then explored further, flicking his tongue teasingly down Draco's crack. "Hmm?" Harry hummed, parting Draco's cheeks enough to circle his tongue lightly around Draco's arsehole.
. And because it was wandless, there was no pink line of light from his wand to betray him. The Death Eaters had no way of knowing that Draco had cast anything other than an Unforgivable Curse.
Draco smiled gleefully into his pillow, relieved that Potter couldn’t see his face. Draco nodded a final time. “Saved me again, Potter,” he said into his pillow after Potter left.
Leave it to Potter to turn into a stammering imbecile. Draco flicked open the bedcurtains with his wand and blinked against the light, so that the whole situation looked...well...
Harry. Enemies turned lovers. See this potion vial below them, here?" Draco pointed to the small icon between the two figures holding hands. "I always assumed that the light in this image was symbolic of the
When Draco wasn’t on the battlements, he continued exploring the dungeons with the assistance of spells and maps.
Potter, who was bravely attempting to sit on the sofa, was wearing starched black trousers and a royal blue button-up shirt with a shimmering white tie. His dark hair was still a little damp, but it was combed in an attempt to make it look less wild. He looked absolutely delicious even
Harry stepped forward, leaning toward Draco’s ear so that Lily couldn’t hear what he was about to say. Feeling Harry's soft, warm breath against his ear and the slightest graze of fabric grazing against his legs was enough to make Draco's toes curl. “The trouble with all of this is, I want
The week had felt like it would never end, and now he went nearly skipping down to the kitchens, where he found a cluster of house elves cleaning the ovens. “You,” he pointed to one that looked familiar, the one that had shown him to his rooms when he first arrived.

Draco stared past Potter and up into the door in the ceiling of his bedcurtains. Right into Potter’s disastrous bedroom.
of doing to you for a long,” Draco subtly leaned forward further, pressing his growing erection against Potter’s hip. “
“Nah. They’re making me stay for the rest of the morning, even though I’m perfectly fine. Dad showed up after we got here and had a bloody
Potters? Well, Potter had married a Weasley, hadn’t he? They were known for their tendency to reproduce. He really hoped that there weren’t any more. It was just his luck, anyway, having all of Potter’s hatchlings in his Potions classes. It was far more Potter-Weasels than anyone should rightfully have to encounter in a lifetime, and he had to see them all in a single day.
to put James in unnecessary danger, but he felt that saving Harry's life had been worth the risk. He knew James himself agreed. Draco had always believed that saving a loved one's life was worth risk; he had the mark to prove it. But Harry had already lost far too many people in his life; he didn't want any more
It took nearly two weeks to discover that the donations lists in the library were more or less useless. Carter’s donations had been given in bulk, and no one had bothered to sit down and make any record of the items donated or where each item ended up. Draco did, however, find a lead when scanning through potions donations. Small batches of potions donations were frequently listed as being taken to the “Potions Storage Library.” Apparently, somewhere in the dungeons was a large storage room that contained all of the potions stored by Hogwarts. This meant, of course, that in addition to the decent potions donations, he would probably have to filter through unsolicited donations and student projects. In theory, the room should be filled with preservation charms so he wouldn’t need to worry about spoilage. At least he hoped so, because some of the potions listed were well over 100 years old.
“And let me know what you find, won’t you? I’m very interested to learn what sorts of potions we have been storing away.”
to see the look on Potter’s face when he found out he had produced a Slytherin. He instantly gravitated toward the child. “Mr. Potter,” he said shortly after his introductory lecture, clearing his throat and intending to put this Potter-Weasel on the spot like he had the others in an excuse to shave House points away. But he probably wouldn’t shave as
“She’s fine,” Potter smiled appreciatively. “Nothing that the Healers couldn’t mend. She’ll be back to normal in a few days.” Potter’s eyes sparkled at him.
Draco nearly kicked the air in exasperation. "Fuck you, Potter." If he'd learned anything over the last few months, it was that Harry was a fucking
Granger stood and gave the welcoming speech. The students were in complete awe of her, and even Draco had to concede that she held herself with enough grace and poise to seem superhuman. Ron Weasley sat at her right side. Judging by the way that Weasley, who was apparently the Quidditch coach--nevermind the nepotism there--beamed at Granger, Draco guessed that they were still happily married. A flash of their wedding bands in the candlelight confirmed it. Clearly Weasley was not as content with Draco’s presence as Granger was, if his furrowed orange eyebrows were any indication. Weasley had already attempted to murder Draco with his eyes several times, and dinner hadn’t even appeared yet. Weasley leaned forward to look disgustedly down the table at Malfoy for the upteenth time, as if he couldn’t even believe what he was seeing was real.
Draco took the scroll and pulled it flat between his fingers. On May Second there was to be a grand celebration, including a grand feast and a grand ball, to commemorate the anniversary of the grand victory over Voldemort. The grand guest of honor, Harry Potter, would be part of the grand events. The grand Harry Potter would be available to shake hands, serve the first dish, and lead the first dance. Everything was going to be very grand. ...Draco really hoped they had actually bothered to run all of this by Potter before they decided to print all of these grand scrolls. Draco closed the scroll and looked up at Lily. “I...”
Bloody hell, Potter was doing this on purpose. He was just trying to make him look bad in front of his colleagues. But if that was really the case, Potter certainly didn’t look much better.
? Preposterous.” Draco teased as Granger pursed her lips. “I can’t make any promises…” he swallowed, “Hermione.” The word felt strange and foreign on his tongue. “Yes, I do think I’ll stick with Granger, if you don’t mind.” He smiled, threw back the rest of his tea and made his way toward the library.
Before Granger could reach for him, Draco felt his pulse quickening. He felt his limbs loosening. He tested his vocal chords and managed a groan.
"This fog between them? In the Wizarding translation, it means ignorance, a state of the unknown. I'd always assumed that this was what the world was like
“Of course I will,” he said a little more snappily than he meant to, hoping that his voice sounded more confident than he felt.
clean with soap, not with those awful cleaning spells you’ve obviously been trying and failing to cast on them--I think you would be taken far more seriously as a professional.” She paled. “Yes, I am really seeing it now. You could even have the potential for St. Mungo's! Especially if you stopped pretending you were better than everyone else all the time.” Draco nodded, smiling. “How lucky I am to have your assistance! And here I always thought you were so repellent when we were in school, partially due to your birth to Muggle parents of course, but then again I
And Draco did. He told Granger all about Siberia. He told her about the research facility in the mountains, about the digsite near Lake Baikal, about their significant discovery of ancient potions ingredients. He was genuinely surprised by how easy she was to talk to. She listened openly, and asked questions that encouraged him to talk further. Talking with Granger brought a surprising level of relief. He knew, now, that this was as good a time as any. It was better to have Granger in on his plan, more or less, than to have Potter discover him snooping around the castle again.
There was a long silence, and Harry realised he'd been holding his breath. He let it out slowly, quietly, not wanting to reveal himself if it could be avoided. He hoped they would just leave and be none the wiser to their certainly unwelcomed interloper. After such an awkward breakfast, he felt himself horribly on edge and off centre in his own home.
Rather than flying an identifying flag, someone had painted the words "The Burrow" on the side of the hull in lopsided letters. The name referenced an early home the Weasleys had been forced to abandon in their fight against the increasing power of Voldemort and his new government.
“Yes, just like us.” Draco’s voice dropped into a soft whisper. “One day, they got the best news ever. They weren’t just having one baby, they were having two babies. Two little girls, and their son would be a big brother to both of them.”
Harry felt a growing respect for the Malfoy matriarch, her gaze direct and her words quiet and polite. After thinking for a moment, he responded by calling for Winky and then turning back to her. “What times do you normally take your meals?”
The only time they had been separated was the long awful months Sirius had spent in Azkaban when Harry was a teenager. Despite the difficult circumstances, Harry had grown into the role of leading the ragtag bunch of pirates. By the time they freed Sirius, no one disputed Harry's right to command, causing Harry to realize he could do anything he set his mind to.
“If you were a witch, I’d swear you were trying to tell me you’re pregnant, but you’re not a witch so…”
The Killing Curse took so much energy from the caster that it was rare to find anyone who could do more than one without needing rest. The sheer number of enemy soldiers had the Killing Curses coming with alarming regularity. Harry and Cedric were struggling to keep their men protected as they fought to open the door behind them while the rest held their ground, providing cover fire.
This bitter idea bothered the clone. Magic powered by blood or the soul came easier to him than ordinary spells. Blood magic was especially accessible. It gave the clone a focus, helpful for advanced casting, where he would normally have to work around his lack of a wand.
Ron nodded as he took a moment to stare across the water. "Pettigrew still insists on going when you board."
“He insisted,” Harry said quietly as he leaned over to kiss his husband’s forehead, “but I’ll make you whatever you think you can eat.”
I hope you don't mind me calling you Draco - the Potter/Malfoy thing reminds me too much of my teenage years and wasn't that just a picnic. Anyway, I’m writing because every attempt to actually talk to you since the start of the school year has been sidelined by someone or something. The sheer volume of work involved is beyond anything I imagined. Being the Defense teacher is, surprisingly, very different from my time running the DA. I dunno about you but my students seem to love getting detention, the grading and lesson planning is driving me spare and, Merlin, the staff meetings. I thought Binns was bad as a teacher. I know you agree with me on that, we had matching eye rolls yesterday.
Cedric was as good at deflecting spells with his double handed iron axe as he was with his wand. Iron had always been impervious to magic. The magnificent weapon absorbed the Avada Kedavra as easily as any other spell.  No one else was as good as Cedric at casting with a two handed weapon.
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione nodded in agreement. “Kingsley said as much and said that he would consider it a personal favour.”
“I can’t imagine growing up without my mum,” Draco admitted, his heart breaking a little for the man who’d never known his own mother at all. “I’m really sorry, Harry. That bastard took so much from us all. I know I’m luckier than most.”
“Of course,” Draco said, brushing his cheek with a tender kiss before pulling away. “Wine? Or perhaps beer would better suit your barbecue?” The sarcasm was thick, indicative of his sometimes grudging tolerance of Harry and Arthur’s exploration of all things Muggle.
A few hours later, they were finally driven back inside by the cool night air, chilly despite it being early summer. As they put their brooms away, Harry suggested hot chocolate and Draco readily agreed. They moved carefully down the stairs, trying not to disturb the elder Malfoys and made their way into the kitchen.
“If we are going to have what I suspect is a deeply personal conversation, it would go better if you called me
The dismembered corpses being studied were somehow spared the destruction. The clone suspected dead bodies freaked out the dark lord. Given that the research was being done on Voldemort's behalf and his own status as mostly dead, the clone found his discomfort deeply amusing.
“Everything is fine,” Dr. Smithers said quietly. “Draco will be much more tired than last time. He needs to take it easy. I will get you potions to help with the nausea and some supplements. He’s eating for three, after all.”
I was stunned when I heard you were coaching the Ravenclaws; impressed though.  I’ve no doubt you’re great at it - you were a challenging opponent
“You’re angry and I don’t blame you. This war was placed on the shoulders of children who never should have borne it, least of all, you. We failed all of you, all but a few adults and thankfully, you had those. The Weasleys, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape.” Narcissa sighed. “I should have done more. Anyway,” She continued, “I want to help now. I know it’s late and well, I’m not your mother. I know that.”
“My home is wherever you are,” Harry said, turning to face him. He was about to say something else, but laughed instead when he heard a distinct series of pops behind them. “Sounds like more of the family’s arriving. Let’s greet them, shall we?”
The doctor frowned slightly, checked something in the chart and then turned back to Draco. “Your weight is up, but this could just be due to stress-eating.”
“I promise,” Harry assured him, moving to wrap his arms around Draco’s waist and capturing Draco’s mouth in a chaste brush of lips. “Thanks for taking care of me.”
He heard Draco sigh. “I'm sorry, mother. It's alright. I still have my family intact and that's worth everything else.”
The pirate would not stand in a room and ignore someone because they were different. He believed in the legend of Harry Potter, the fearless man they claimed him to be.
A couple of hours later, sat at their kitchen table with multiple cups of coffee (Harry) and herbal tea (Draco) and a half eaten box of pastries (mostly Harry) between them, the couple looked at each other and both began to laugh, chuckles at first and then full out laughter. They laughed until they were out of breath. Still smiling, Harry drained his cup and stood, holding out his hand to his husband.
Narcissa’s words haunted him, an unexpected glimpse into all that Draco lost that day, and his heart broke a little, for Draco and the choice that was never really a choice, for the future Draco’d lost, and for all of those that he couldn’t save. A lump rose in his throat and he fought down sadness and anger and frustration. Maybe it was time to start moving forward, beginning perhaps with Draco.
“Because they don’t let little boys be there until after your sisters are born,” he explained patiently. “You need to stay with Nana and Poppy tonight so I can take care of your papa.”
“Rinse and spit,” he said quietly and Draco did, his hand still trembling. Taking the empty glass, Harry set it aside and rinsed the flannel before returning to sit on the floor. He handed the flannel to Draco and leaned against the door, waiting. “You want to talk about it?” Harry asked.
“You didn’t look like the toys or the posters. You looked like a street urchin, Harry. No one knew...no one knew that you weren’t a spoiled, well-dressed young wizard. That’s what I was expecting.”
Lunch that day was a quiet affair, but a bit less tense than the previous meals, so Harry thought he’d plunge forward with Hermione’s suggestion. He took a long drink and cleared his throat.
Over his shoulder, Narcissa Malfoy turned back and gave him one last look. Then the door closed between them.
I’m sorry. I think I made it all the way back to my rooms before I even realised I’d just left you there, arse on the floor, cheeks flushed, lips swollen and eyes searching and confused.
“The house-elf heads,” Harry said as he walked past Draco and toward the stairs. Once in the entry, he stopped in front of the gruesome display and fought down a flush of bile. “This, this just…” Harry clamped his lips down and tore his eyes from the heads to look at Draco before continuing. “They don’t just come down, I tried. I also tried simple spells but then I stopped because I wasn’t sure if there might be some sort of curse attached.”
The ‘Phoenix of the Sea’, ‘The Marauder’ and ‘The Burrow’, each so unique, made up the small but deadly force that led the fight against Voldemort.
I think I just heard you start to pack up your work out there, so I suppose I’ll send this to you now. I’m using your owl because if I made Portia deliver a letter 25 feet from me, she would be irate for a week. Put on your shoes, I want to go out to dinner, I know a very special little french place in muggle London, and I told Minerva I needed to pick up some supplies in Diagon, so she knows I’ll be off school grounds for the evening. I doubt she’ll worry about you, you never were one for following rules. Besides, if you plan to meet mother, we’ll have to work on your table etiquette.
Ron nodded and then turned to look his best friend right in the face. "You know this is a trap though, right?"
Draco took in a shuddering breath and then another. Finally, he rasped, “Harry, that’s...that’s not possible.”
“It was Robert Michaels, he was assistant to the lead Auror assigned to the case which gave him access to a lot of information. He faked authorisations to get the rest. It was an act of revenge.”
Hours later, still trying to steady his breathing from the torture of the day, he looked back.  The last tech to leave turned off the lights. With a wave of his hand, they all flared back to life.
“Of course, love.” Harry stepped closer to the bassinet and gathered the first little bundle up and placed her in her papa’s arms, then the second. Two beautiful little girls blinked sleepily in the warm light of the evening sun..
.” He traced the fingertips of his right hand up Potter’s neck, thrilled to see gooseflesh trailing his touch, and wove them forcefully into that mess of dark hair, pulling Potter’s head back a little before pushing him close again. He heard Potter’s breath quiver, and felt Potter’s right hand--the hand that Weasley couldn’t see--grip Draco’s waist. Potter’s reaction delighted him, and Draco closed his eyes, relishing the feeling of Potter’s willing hand against him. “And when we get back to the castle,” Draco licked his lips, “you are going to sneak to my room. Because,” Draco moved his head so Weasley couldn’t see what he was doing, and ran his tongue along the length of Potter’s ear. He sucked Potter’s earlobe into his mouth, rolling it gently between his lips. Merlin
at him. Oh Merlin, were their faces this close a moment ago? Potter’s eyes were so gentle, so open, so captivating. He had to say something. He had to move his mouth to form words or else he might move his mouth a little too close to Potter’s. Or worse, he might move his hips.
Draco risked a glance to Potter’s face, but Potter’s eyes were either closed, or so downcast that they appeared closed in the dark. But Potter kept… well...
“I wonder,” Draco said, getting to his feet and extending a hand. “May I?” Potter didn’t even hesitate before handing over his wand, and Draco let the heat of it thrum in his cold hand for a moment. “I’ve found that sometimes if a spell is forgotten and ancient enough it can go undetected by modern wards.” Draco cast an ancient ladder conjuring spell he had discovered on one of his early digs that had saved him in many an exploratory situation thereafter. “They also have a tendency to throw modern wizards into confusion. It’s something I’ve been studying in my spare time.”
“It won’t do you any good, sir,” the man said. “Every clothier in London is completely booked. You couldn’t possibly get something

Albus opened it again. Draco flicked water from his hands and reached for a towel. Draco craned his head out of the room, looking into the hallway of the Slytherin male dormitories. His heart warmed a little at the sight. How he missed it.
to understand what loneliness means.” Draco looked at the ground again, rubbing his sore chest. “You want to know what happened to me? After the war, my family was completely ostracized. No invitations, no social ties, no way to start a new life. We were completely cut off. Unable to distract themselves or recover from the horrors of the war, my parents’ health suffered until I made them leave the country. Any remaining friends I had who
, too, beneath Draco’s hand as he slowly began to stroke. Harry’s cock felt better than silk, and he explored it with his fingers until blind exploration wasn’t enough.
Draco felt his heart slowing. He could feel his lungs stilling. They were running out of time. Even if Granger
James leaned back against his pillows, crossing his arms with a cocky smile that looked so much like Harry’s that it hurt Draco’s heart a little. “A stag.”
The Grand Ballroom was already ten times smaller without masses of people inside of it. When Draco fully stepped inside, he stopped breathing.
“Your face is even worse,” James said, appearing beside him. “Didn’t you visit the healer?” James had also doubled down on Potter guard duty. They even coordinated their schedules to make sure that when one of them was unable to be on the battlements, the other certainly
“Come on,” Weasley said, patting them on the back. “They’re bound to fade out eventually. Hermione’s just taken the kids back to the hotel.”
his father? The only possible conclusion was that she must have worked with his father after the war, during that brief time when his father had tried to redeem his mistakes and push beneficial legislation through the Ministry before both of his parents had given up attempts at rejoining society completely and moved to France. Certainly before the war, no one would describe working with his father as
As Draco stumbled forward between two more tight shoulders, he saw Harry descending the steps from the Ministry's platform. The sight of him took Draco’s breath away. Because he was
"No you won't," Harry said with a sly smile, bending to trace his tongue along the top of Draco's thigh. "You like me too much." To prove his point,
Now their erect cocks were separated only by a thin layer of cotton and a thin layer of silk. Draco could feel
“Where are you going to sleep? This sofa isn’t fit for man or beast.” Draco leaned forward on the sofa and shrugged out of his suit coat.
too, pulsing between their skin like a heart. Pulsing even as Draco dug his nails into Potter’s flesh and Potter groaned, thrusting against Draco’s thigh.
Lucky for Potter, Weasley plopped down beside them. “Alright, what’d I miss? How many is that tonight?”
As Harry and Draco leisurely walked back toward the palace, Harry wove his arm through Draco’s and entangled their fingers.
“She didn’t hurt you though?” Draco almost hated himself for asking, but he had to know. He couldn’t stand the thought of Potter going home with anyone who wanted to hurt him. He couldn’t stand the thought of Potter in pain, especially when all Potter had probably wanted that night was to be held. And Draco had often found himself lonely enough to know exactly what that felt like.
James marched right past Draco with his wand drawn, but Draco curled his fist into the back of James' robes and pulled him back. "Oh,
Draco led the house elf back to his desk in his rooms, where he had three vials in an open stand. “Now,” Draco said, turning to the house elf. “I am going to drink this potion. I do not know exactly what it will do. If I appear to be ill or in any pain of any kind, you need to contact a Healer immediately. Understood?”

James violently shook his head. “I can’t believe my dad wants me to be nice to an evil bastard like you.”
him a great deal. It was hard to deny that much when his thoughts had so quickly shifted from a determination to avoid Potter completely, to an overwhelming desire to snog him until they couldn't remember their own names. Harry still wouldn't look Draco in the eyes, and that was becoming its own special brand of torture. He was tempted to grab Harry's face between his hands and
She was silent for a long while, watching as he stirred and added and read. Then, Draco nearly dumped the entire cauldron over when she said: “You like boys.” It was not a question. He just stared up at her, eyes wide. Before he could even begin to explain how inappropriate the conversation was or ask how she even
Draco dragged himself out of bed and stood behind Harry, still naked. “Who’s Juliet?” he asked, kissing Harry’s neck and wrapping his arms around his waist.
having Potter kneeling beside him in his bedroom and pressing his hand against his chest with concerned eyes as though he actually
, all of a sudden. To feel so warm. To feel so protected, so cocooned by another person. By Potter, in particular. The thought terrified him. He pushed Potter off and scrambled out from underneath of him as if he were made of poison. “Trapped in a muddy pit with Harry Potter,” he said sourly, crawling back on his hands and knees and pushing himself back to his feet. “Just what I’ve always wanted.”
Draco fiddled with one of his empty glasses. “Well by all means, Weasley, if you would like to flirt with Potter, I would happily join you for another shot as soon as I finish scratching out my eyeballs.”
“Fine. Laugh. That’s what you always do in the face of sincerity, isn’t it? Turn cynical. Make it into a joke. Avoid it altogether.” Potter bristled and backed against the opposite side of the pit. He leaned against the wall, digging his fingers into the dirt as if it could restrain him from marching forward and punching Draco into the ground.
“Haven’t the foggiest. Hold on. Going to test something.” Malfoy stepped aside and out of view, pinched himself,
For some reason, Potter was grinning at him like Draco was a fucking bunny rabbit in a den of werewolves. “Oh, Malfoy, I’ve missed you,” Potter said teasingly, with--was Draco reading that right?--a dollop of sincerity.
Potter wouldn’t have been able to experience anything like this as an orphan, Draco realized. He wasn’t sure what Potter’s childhood was like, but it certainly wouldn’t have involved his parents playing Quidditch with him. And that smile. Something within Draco began to ache. Had Draco
When the meal had finished and the plans for the following day had been thoroughly covered, Mr. Wilson finished his fourth sherry and scooted forward in his seat. “Mr. Potter, I’ve always wanted to ask: do you
In the newspapers that morning, Draco had read that the palace was magically configured to adjust to the amount of people inside; it could fit the entire city within its walls if it needed to. Right now, however, despite how huge it was, it still felt too small. Witches and wizards were
Draco's facade, break down his shields, and somehow turn Draco into a joyful blubbering fool. Still. Maybe they would never be what the other really needed; maybe they would never truly be enough. What Potter had said about them in the pit--that maybe they were the last people in the world for each other--that had made sense at the time. But they had tried and failed. Worse things happened every day. The
. The headmistress. By some miracle he had avoided her until now. She wasn’t present in any of his interviews. Now he was realizing that he hadn’t really thought this part through. He would have to actually
Draco took a deep breath. It was too late now. He decided to do what he always did in times like these. He had done it the first time he was on this train, and he could do it now: act far, far more confident than he actually felt. He straightened his shoulders and stepped back, smoothing out his robes and running his hands over his golden hair. It
?” Draco stood, anxiety swirling through his gut. “Are you alright?” Potter was crossing the room, moving straight toward Draco as if he had no control of his own two feet. He was close. Closer. Too close. Far too close. Something was wrong. Something was terribly, terribly wrong. Draco gently pressed a hand against Potter’s chest, trying to steady him, trying to keep him in place. Potter was only inches from Draco’s face, and Draco intended to keep him at a distance. “Say something.” But then Potter leaned forward and kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth. It was short and simple and soft and sweet, but Draco dropped his hand and stepped back until his calves were pressed against the edge of the bed, feeling completely undone. Unnerved. Unfastened. Unmade.
you four! Down that hallway to capture the Minister! And you four,” Draco pointed to another group, “to the Throne Room. Bring down the wards so that Lord Voldemort can apparate into the palace and prove that he is very much alive on this anniversary of his death. Now
Draco smirked. Leave it to Harry Potter to invent wandless stripping spells and yet have no knowledge of more established ones. “Oh, I think you’ll find I’m full of surprises, Potter.”
Draco caught Harry’s wand mid-air and batted the Death Eater’s wand away. Before the wand had even clattered to the floor, the Death Eater was incapacitated and the other Death Eater began to run away. Draco had him incapacitated and on the floor in a matter of seconds.
“Draco?” Granger was at his side in an instant, running her wand up and down his body as she murmured diagnostic spells. “Oh
, she just kept right on going. “And I need your advice, because one of my friends thinks he might like boys too, and he--” Draco was only half listening to her because he was still a bit in shock, and also didn’t want the entire classroom to be imbibed with good luck if he didn’t finish his potion correctly. Ultimately, he cut her off and suggested her friend go talk to a counselor and would she
“Fuck me, Draco,” Harry whispered, his breath hot against Draco’s ear. "I want you to fuck me." Harry leaned back to meet Draco’s eyes. “Please?”
James stepped through the door and into the night. Before Draco could close the door, James reached for his arm. "
Draco's nervous energy was getting the upper hand. He took a fidgeting step, fully intending to continue his search for Harry.
When he couldn’t find the Room of Requirement, he took to walking through the edges of the Forbidden Forest, seeking ingredients for his classroom supply.
Draco finally managed to wedge himself between two broad wizards, and was about to shove through two witches, when he felt the floor sliding beneath his feet. He was sliding backward even though he wasn’t moving his legs.
Harry almost laughed. “He’s just releasing the balls for us. He’s busy strategizing for another game.”
, honestly,” Draco murmured, summoning his robe from the chair by his bed and slipping it quickly around himself before Weasley could come up with some thoughtful retort about the rather hypocritical fact that Draco was only wearing a sheet.
From the moment Draco met Cornelius, he felt inexplicably angry in Cornelius’s presence. He respected the man’s knowledge of Norwegian flora, to be sure, but also thought he was a complete git. He hated the way Cornelius read his newspaper in the morning. He hated the way Cornelius would sit giggling at the kitchen table, writing gossip-rich editorials for
“For the record, pup, if I really wanted to kill your dad I would have done it already. Tell me about the hooded thing.”
Draco slowly closed the door and fell into the chair in front of his desk, feeling like a complete idiot.
big enough for both of them. They may as well have been sleeping on different continents. Draco was almost disappointed.
“No,” Draco shook his head, trying not to sound as devastated as he felt, but failing miserably. “I didn’t.” Of course he didn’t know. Draco had spent far too much time avoiding the
Draco reached up and touched his lips, which were rapidly growing cold in the absence of that tingling golden heat.
Harry looked over to his second daughter and stroked her tiny hand. The yellow name bracelet was still blank. "Hello, Narcissa Rose,” he whispered.
Draco didn’t speak, just shook his head jerkily and kept his eyes trained on his hands that were now restlessly wringing in his lap.
Harry smiled, leading them into their bedroom. The men undressed quietly, then entered the large ensuite. Harry started the shower and followed Draco in. “Let me,” he said quietly when Draco reached for the shampoo. He was rewarded with a gentle smile. Harry washed Draco’s hair and then ran a soapy sponge over his body, caring for his beloved tenderly. While Draco dried off, Harry completed his own shower quickly. Draco was already in bed when Harry emerged, still toweling his hair dry. As he slipped into bed, he stifled a yawn and realized just how tired he was as well. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist and curled up behind him, smiling to himself as his husband moved back into his warmth.
“I’ll help you up a bit,” Harry said quietly, speaking the incantation and waving his wand to slowly lift the head of the bed.
Harry snorted. "The man threatens to faint when he gets a papercut. He's going to get himself killed."
The techs shut down about dinner time. The clone concluded that if he skipped the kitchens until later he did not run into anyone there. While he waited, he would follow people around by tracking the sound of footsteps, or conversations.
When the rest of dinner had been artfully arranged on the table, Harry sat down, watching as Draco took in the dining-room, turning more than once to look at Harry as he did. “Balloons? Muggle candy… Sour Patch Kids?? I love Sour Patch Kids.”
The clone started each manuscript at the beginning. As he learned about the history of the men and women who mastered their craft, he gained insights into how they approached magic.
.  I’ve seen Calcagno fly and I agree on his skills.  Piper has some talent, no doubt, just needs some time.  Richmond is a promising seeker and the Olsens are killer beaters for Gryffindor so don't count us out just yet.  We can’t overlook Underhill’s seeker skills for Hufflepuff either. I watched him train the other day and he’s fearless.
“Harry,” Kingsley said, his large hands folded on the scarred table. “I want you to know how much I appreciate your help with this. I know this isn’t ideal.”
I shall begin very simply. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT MAP? I know I played it off, cool as a cucumber, when you showed it to me, but it bears a striking resemblance to the one my mother made to track me when I was a wandering child, but its far more complex. The detail and magic involved in creating something like that is striking and, frankly, a little frightening. I wonder if Mother learned it from her cousin, or maybe they both learned the basics somewhere else? I didn’t say anything when I saw it at first, but my mother and auntie Andromeda loved cousin Sirius. I was taught not to speak of him, but I used to hear funny stories from the house-elves. I wish someone had been around to teach me that sort of mischief.
Draco gave him a tiny half smile and a brief nod, and Harry felt encouraged enough to try chatting while they worked.
Uncle Sirius captained the vessel now. Though not related by blood, Harry counted Sirius Black as family in all the ways that mattered, having raised him from the moment his parents fell.
“Well, I inherited it from Sirius but the thing is, I don’t know much about owning a house and I don’t know anything about magical houses. I was thinking, hoping that maybe since we’re stuck here, you all might be willing to help me with it. It’s gloomy and well, not very homey and I’d really like to change that.”
The hatch was locked tight. A thick wooden beam had been wedged into the metal loops on each of the two doors, bolting them together.
“It felt right.” Harry paused for a moment, then continued. “This is my quiet place, a place to reset and try to heal. Ron and Hermione are wonderful, but they are moving on, starting their post war lives, Hermione in school, and Ron helping George at the shop and, well, in dealing with their losses as a family. I don’t want to hold them back, you know? Because if they knew how much I’ve struggled, if I shared it with them, they’d figure out I’m more of a mess than I’ve let on, and they’d put things on hold to try to help me and they need the chance to live their own lives. I’ve been, well, stuck. Held back by my own struggles and by a public that won’t let me just live. They all want something from me and it’s just too much.”
“Are they alright? Anyone hurt?” Harry kept his voice calm, but he hadn’t worked hard to help them bargain the exchange of information for their lives to see it go to shit now, and if he spared a tiny thought for the Malfoy he’d been equal parts exasperated with and fascinated with, well, it was no one’s business but his own.
The stories of Potter were about a man unique from anyone else the clone had ever known; strong and brave, willing to take on the world to protect those who could not protect themselves.
There had been one more person in the room that day. A fair-haired woman stood at Lucius Malfoy's side. Her face had the distinguished appearance of someone who had and would age well. Narcissa Malfoy was the only person the clone ever remembered who looked at him like that. He could not explain exactly what about her expression made him feel warm inside.
After the initial conversation, Draco drank his tea in silence, the frown between his brows growing deeper by the minute. With their son occupied with his breakfast, Harry spoke to Draco in low tones. “Are you alright, Draco? Your morning sickness seems to be lasting longer than last time.”
Hello friends! Quick note. This chapter contains a brief trigger warning for past suicidal ideation. But it is all ok in the end ;)
This was his now in the way only information could be. His mind was his own. No one could take that away from him. The clone cradled this new piece like a great treasure, then retreated.
Draco paused and finally looked up then, looking as though searching Harry’s face for something before shaking his head. “Thank you,” he said quietly, “but I think I will rest as well. Yesterday was...difficult.”
"They say that the wife of his best friend is personally championing the independence of house elves" she said a few nights later.
Regardless, we need to be more careful or people will find out and it’ll be pandemonium. I don’t want to upset what we have.
Harry kissed the bare shoulder before nuzzling his face into Draco’s neck, breathing in the scent that he loved so much. “Completely. Are you?”
When the clone closed his eyes, he could see it. The great Harry Potter in his dashing pirate clothes, riding into the city in triumphant splendour.
Glad you found this note under your breakfast plate. Would you like to know a secret? I put you in charge of dishes so I would have time to get ready. I know you always start with the cups and saucers, then the silverware, finally the plates. You are easy to predict. I’m yours, Harry Potter. I’m somewhere in the castle students can't find. Using the map is cheating. Come and find me. I love you, I’m in love with you, and when you reach this mystery location, I will not be wearing nearly enough clothing for my mother's sense of propriety and decorum. Hurry up, I'm waiting...
“Aww, thanks. I’m glad you’re enjoying it,” Harry said between bites. “I still want you to guess the theme though.”
“Partly, if I’m honest,” Draco admitted, looking over at his companion. “I mean, I grew up with the books and posters and toys of you. I was sent to Hogwarts directed to make friends with the great Harry Potter. Thing was, you weren’t what my parents or I expected.”
Harry snorted. “That’s an understatement, Kingsley. I paid my dues, did my duty and then some! We're not making this a recurring theme here, is that clear?” Harry looked him in the eye and waited.
Well, this is it the end - and the beginning, at least for Harry and Draco.  Thanks for reading along with our little story.
A line of shelves stretched across that section of the lab, floor to ceiling. The usual collection of paraphernalia lay scattered about on the long wooden planks. The clone slipped across the room, counting on the general normality of everyone ignoring him, to avoid suspicion. A pale, slender finger ran gently over the edge of a shelf.
“It's alright, Mr Potter.” Narcissa sighed. “Please, do not be too angry with Draco. He has much on his mind that no child his age should. He's frightened and angry and with good reason. He's been through a war too, despite the differences. His life, I'm afraid, will never be the one he grew up dreaming about.”
of his symptoms objectively. He trusted her judgment, so he vocalized how he felt and she wrote down anything else she observed.
“I am?” Harry whispered as he pulled away, reaching down to stroke Draco’s hardening cock between them.
with boxes of Bertie Botts beans. “I’m prepared to do what I must,” she sighed emphatically, patting the bag at her side.
. Then Harry lifted his hand again, running a long, dripping strand of Draco’s hair between his index and middle finger. “And this. This has been driving me mad.”
. People will follow your lead. You can set whatever trend you wish.  If you make a mistake, don’t panic, because even your mistakes will be seen as fashionable. There,” Draco said, wiggling the knot of the tie back and forth. “Your royal subjects await.”
He and Potter had hated each other for most of their lives. Why should he care if Potter hated him now? His own words from the truth potion echoed back into his ears.
The doors had gone to rights by early Saturday afternoon, to everyone’s relief. Draco had spent most of Sunday napping, and the rest of the week trying to focus on anything but the memory of Potter in his bed.
Of course, that all changed one morning when Draco accidentally had a bit of a lie-in, and came out to find Cornelius sitting at the small table near the kitchen, sipping coffee and reading his newspaper
Harry like this, completely unclothed--all skin and beauty and need. The vision of Harry, naked on his back and leaning up on his elbows with wild hair and no glasses to hide the brilliance of his eyes, looking at Draco like
A few minutes later, while Weasley was in the loo and Draco had walked across the room to glance at a note on the wall about someone selling potions ingredients, a man sauntered across the pub toward Potter. Draco instantly began walking back toward the bar, Death Eaters still fresh on his mind. The man bent toward Potter’s ear, pressing a hand firmly on Potter’s opposite shoulder, and began whispering. Draco reached Potter’s side, crossed his arms, and cleared his throat loudly. The man stood upright, gave Draco a bit of a scowl, and then walked away. Potter’s cheeks were bright pink, and his knuckles went white against his glass as he shifted on his stool. The man walked straight out of the bar, letting the doors slam behind him.
always try to avoid Potter’s sincerity or turn it into something cruel or laughable. Sitting alone in the mud in the rain and shivering with cold, Potter looked painfully pathetic. After a few moments, Draco stood up, walked across the pit, and sat next to Potter in the mud, folding his arms around his knees. They were both silent, trying not to shiver with cold as the rain fell around them.
The plan had originally been designed to keep Draco focused and productive, rather than wallowing in misery and regret. But now the plan was
When Longbottom was close enough, he punched Draco across the side of the face. "Draco Malfoy," Longbottom said bitterly as Draco lost what little balance he had against the wall and toppled to the floor.
“I think I’m going to be sick,” Draco murmured, and he did feel a little nauseous after Weasley and Granger’s hideous display. Merlin, what would it be like to have someone like that in his life? To be so comfortable with someone? To swoop someone up and kiss their neck and...he blinked over at Potter. Potter blinked back.
How had Potter endured it all? So much had already been thrust onto his shoulders when they were children. Draco was old enough to see how

really. Whenever Draco got too frustrated, he took great pleasure in removing points from Gryffindor on account of James’ predictably snobbish behavior in his classroom. Whenever he found that he needed a break, he walked the grounds, usually along the lake, around the Quidditch pitch, and back to the castle.
“Hey,” she whispered, sliding her fingers alluringly along Potter’s shoulders in a way that made Draco want to slap her away. “How about you come back to my place tonight? I promise I’ll make it worth your while.” She slid a piece of paper onto the bar and turned, swaying her hips as she walked back toward the corner of the room. Draco glanced down and saw that she had slid him Apparition coordinates.
“I wanted to punch that stupid shit-eating grin off your face, that’s what. And that’s all I will say on the matter.”
Harry pulled out and crawled over Draco, who had already collapsed onto the bed. Harry placed soft kisses along Draco's face and then nuzzled into Draco's neck with a contented smile as he relaxed at Draco's side.
Potter was lying between Draco’s open legs wearing only his hideous pyjamas and a thin pair of plaid cotton undershorts.
Draco sat in the Great Hall for the Halloween Feast wearing fine velvet black robes. Weasley and Granger hadn’t arrived yet, but Draco didn’t mind their absences. With Potter not speaking to him, it offered a pleasant sort of quiet. Or at least it did, until James Potter ran into the hall like the building was on fire. James was breathing heavily, as if he had just ran across half of the grounds. Potter was on his feet within seconds. Draco just kicked back and took another sip of pumpkin juice.
comfortable,” Granger said some time later, crossing her ankles and settling back onto his silk pillows as she continued to monitor Draco's health. “And here I always thought you were just conceited. But you may actually be on to something, Malfoy. This is really quite nice.” Then she sat upright, gasping. “Ohmygosh!” Draco slowly turned his stiff neck to look at her. “Do you know what this means? We found it.
As he stared at his watch, pretending to be enraptured by the time, his thoughts drifted to Cornelius Howe, as they often did when he felt completely alone. Cornelius had been one of his colleagues during a research expedition in Norway. He and Cornelius had shared a caravan located between the research base and the forest where they were doing their research.
Harry gave that arrogant little smirk. “You’ve only told me a dozen times.” Harry extended his gloved hand a little further.
Potter kicked Draco’s bedpost so hard that Draco wouldn't have been surprised if it had scooted along the floor. “You can’t even--!” He looked at Draco very seriously, trying to catch his breath. “I don’t know why I
When Draco turned, he saw two old friends standing behind him arm in arm. It was such a welcome sight that he wanted to
the money, it was true, but in the early days being paid kept him away from his father. After the war, he swore would never ask anything of his father ever again. He had asked for love and protection, and look where that had gotten him. He would not be caught dead on his knees begging his father for a single knut. So he worked. He traveled, he researched, and he worked. It was a most un-Malfoyan lifestyle, which meant that he trusted it.
“Mr. Potter!” One of the Ministry members stood, eagerly extending a hand. “Oh, Mr. Potter. Thomas Wilson, at your service. It is
A spasm of green light flickered near the main entrance of the ballroom and a sickly Dark Mark rose toward the ceiling. The room erupted in screams. Because the event was so heavily warded, no one could disapparate. Fearful witches and wizards began stampeding toward the numerous side doors. It was absolute chaos.
stay? That would certainly get some lips talking. Draco Malfoy, back in high society. But that wasn't the
intended for his wife, as a warning for Potter. It wasn’t clear. Either way, Ginny was dead, and they hadn’t caught who did it. Draco stared at the small photo of the suspected Death Eater, but didn’t recognize him. Then he looked at the larger photo of Potter standing in a cafe with a shattered window and toppled tables and chairs. Draco couldn’t actually see Ginny’s body in the photo, but a rivulet of red hair near the bottom of the frame made the photo gruesome enough. And that look on Potter’s face--Draco had seen it before. That look of complete and utter shock. Of undiluted grief. He had seen that look on Potter’s face more times than he wanted to admit. He'd seen it after the astronomy tower. He'd seen it in Malfoy Manor. He'd seen it after the war. Draco watched the photo until Potter buried his face in his hands and his shoulders shook with the force of his sobs.
“There's nothing to be overly concerned about. Potter and I are capable of being professional. We’ll be fine.”
Draco took a shaky breath. The room was silent except for the trickling of the vermouth fountain in the corner. He slowly reached up, pulled the ribbon out of his hair, and smoothed his hair back into his fist. He tied the ribbon back into his hair and let his hands flop out onto the bed in front of him, just
He pulled out an eyedropper, stuffed it into the first potion, and lifted it over his mouth until three drops fell onto his tongue. He smacked his tongue against the roof of his mouth and swallowed.
Maybe Draco should say something. He could get up, and leave, and go find Potter, and make sure that everything was okay.
“Just because your brother has a stag doesn’t mean you can’t have one too. Your Patronus is your Patronus,” Draco said.
Draco floated back to his feet and took her hand as gracefully as though meeting Ministers was something he did every day. Well. It actually
just some ghostly glimpse into the past. Yes, somewhere in the castle was a version of himself at the same age as this particular Potter. And yes, this particular Potter would inevitably become the man who would spectacularly suck his cock on the floor of the Quidditch changing room and wear his shirts and kiss him goodbye. However, as desperately as he wanted to be near Harry,
Potter’s hand wrapped around Draco's wrist over his robes, holding him in place. Quietly, so quietly that Draco wasn’t entirely sure Potter had said anything at all, Potter whispered, “I don’t hate you, if that’s what you think.”
Draco sat down and opened his research journal. He had drastically revised his notes beneath Potion 1, giving it a proper name and so forth. He turned to a blank page, wrote the date in neat, slant script, and then:
“Oh dear. Well. He is currently away on business at the moment, but he is expected back in a few days. You have time to...prepare. Or...whatever it is you need to do.” She shifted uncomfortably and then let out an explosive sigh. "I'm sorry, Malfoy, but as it pertains to the welfare of this school I really must ask. Will you be...capable? Of working professionally in such close proximity to Harry?”
He served on committee after committee wherever he traveled, abandoning traditional aristocracy for new forms of power and influence. Whenever he made a new discovery, he published his findings in prestigious journals like
“He wants us to meet on the lawns in an hour for a family picnic. He's finally going to introduce us to his girlfriend, Flora.”
Harry bit his lip and smiled into his mug. “You don’t mind, do you? I only brought the one shirt. Everything else is t-shirts until I can pick up my dress robes for the day. I wasn’t thinking.” Seeing Potter standing in the early morning wearing Draco's clothes felt almost painful to witness, because a part of him wanted to witness it again, and again, and again. A part that he shoved very forcefully to the back of his thoughts.
When the first years had left his room, he had an hour to make some tea and prepare for the next class. Fifth years. Very angsty fifth years. He gave them a similar opening lecture about what to expect from the year, and then assigned them the task of making a poison antidote, to confirm that everyone had successfully retained information from their previous year and also to give himself a moment of peace.
Draco didn’t bother to respond. He was trying to disappear back into the crowd, which was proving to be more difficult than pushing to the front had been, because everyone was now pushing against him in their attempt to get a better view of Harry.
Even before all of that, Harry had fantasized about Draco. He'd fantasized that they could be Draco and Harry rather than Malfoy and Potter. The Harry he'd left in the next room seemed so young and
The room was spinning, and Draco just closed his eyes and laid down in the middle of the floor. Why had he thought this was a good idea? Why had he decided to do something so reckless and irresponsible? It was so...well, it was so
Well, the war made everyone a little crazy. Everyone was convinced they were going to die anyway, probably Potter most of all. Frankly, Draco was surprised they hadn’t
“Oh ho! Off again, are we? Well, whenever you do decide to settle down, I hope to be the first to know. No, I won’t have Australia laying claim to you, not a mind like yours, you know!”
. He knew because he was standing next to a younger version of himself as Professor Snape gave a potions lecture. He stared at his younger self. His short pale hair was slicked tightly back, and he was scrawling neat notes onto a slim piece of parchment. Draco lifted his hand, and it traveled directly through the potions table. He waved his hand in front of his younger self’s face, but nothing happened. Not the slightest acknowledgment. He was some sort of ghost then. A ghost of himself, witnessing memories of the past.
“I don’t know. You saw it, right Professor? When I sent you that cool message when we got back to the healing ward? Uncle Ron let me do it. I guess it was...kind of like Dad’s. But wasn’t it the
It was late on Sunday evening, but not so late that he expected Granger to be asleep. He crept into her office and poked his head in. She was sitting at her desk, organizing piles of parchment. Draco cleared his throat and her cat howled. Granger looked up. “Professor Malfoy,” she said, looking surprised. “Come in.” Draco entered her office properly and sat in a chair on the other side of her desk. “How are your classes going?” she asked.
something. Without moving off of the floor, Draco lazily summoned a mug from his bedside table and stuck it into the falling vermouth between the second and third tier. He took a sip. It wasn’t terrible, as far as vermouth went. Still, he felt a little unnerved by Potion 1. Sure, he had felt like absolute shite for a few minutes, but was that it? It didn’t
Draco ate a quick meal and went back to his rooms, where Healer Victoria had kindly agreed to meet him and assist with his experiments. She thought his rooms were a good choice because they were comfortable and in a safe part of the castle near other employees.
“Monsieur Malfoy!” Draco recognized a young duchess from his visits to his parents' chateau in France. She offered her hand, and he bowed deeply as he brushed his lips against her gloved knuckles. “It is so good to see you, monsieur! How are you?”
Draco knew what to do with an arrogant Potter. He knew what to do with an angry Potter, and a brainless Potter, and a violent Potter. Now he even knew what to do with a breathless Potter. But he did
Then Harry leaned forward and dragged the flat width of his tongue from the base of Draco's cock to the tip.
“Lilly,” Harry muttered, “this really isn’t--” Lily lovingly smacked his ribs and he stopped talking.
should do more research on this, Draco. I have a tendency to try to take on too much. Who did you get to assist you? Was it you, Harry?”
Draco sighed and looked toward Potter and Weasley, who were walking by him in the hall, likely returning from dinner.
Draco nodded, resisting an angry urge to swipe all of the test vials off of the table and let them smash to the floor.
; the tables were still covered in food--hogs and peacocks and giant fish and fresh fruits and cheeses and endless other delights. However, since the Grand Guest of Honour was nowhere to be seen, it likely meant that the events had formally moved into the Grand Ballroom. Draco hadn’t eaten since breakfast, so he quickly slipped several morsels into his mouth. He didn’t have time to sit and dine properly, but luckily no one gave him any notice.
Weasley was waiting for them in the courtyard, leaning against a stone statue with his arms crossed. “Oh good! Just the men I wanted to see,” he pulled away from the statue and moved toward Harry and Draco. “Can one of you explain to me,” he looked pointedly between the two of them, “why a stag and a dragon are attempting to shag in the middle of the ballroom? Any ideas? There are
Hogwarts, where he had first fallen in love with Potions. Hogwarts, where he learned how to fly! Hogwarts, where he had owned the halls with Crabbe and Goyle, raising a little hell just for fun. Oh, that had felt so bloody fantastic, so innocently youthful, so naively
