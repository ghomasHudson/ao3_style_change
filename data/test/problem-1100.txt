“Well, he’s right, though,” Harry interrupted and looked at them again, spearing his steak and kidney pie with his fork, “he does deserve the punishment he got. It fit his crimes, and maybe he’ll learn a thing or two.”
***********
“You don’t look well rested, Harry,” Hermione observed, eyes raking over his face.
“No. Please never ask that again.”
“Well,
Ron gave him a dubious look. “Okay. I left the Dreamless in your bed. You’ll probably need it.”
“My pleasure, dear boy. I already gave some Dreamless Sleep to Ms. Granger, so at least this night will be a fulfilling one,” Slughorn said as he summoned a stack of papers. “Now, you may go. I have so much grading to do before dinner, it’ll be a miracle if I make it!”
“’Night, Harry,” Hermione said and smiled kindly at him, though the smile didn’t reach her eyes.
“Will you?” Harry asked, dragging the pad of his forefinger up Draco’s erection. He reached a vein on the underside of it and stopped there, rubbing small circles.
Harry tried to process what that meant. “So you... you actually...”
Draco held his gaze. “What do you want to do?”
“Merlin, I’ll kill you.”
Harry blinked, confused. “Well, yeah.”
Malfoy raised one eyebrow. “I’m just fine, Potter, thank you for asking.”
Malfoy muttered a soft curse and squirmed slightly. “Potter, please leave me alone.”
Finally, they reached the trees. Harry halted, turning in the general direction he expected Malfoy to be. “This is it.”
“There’s water dribbling down your chin,” Ron pointed out.
“Harry, dear boy, could I have a word with you?”
“Good Lord, Draco,” Harry pulled back and stood. Unzipping his jeans, he shoved it down along with his pants, his own cock demanding immediate attention. He stroked it quickly twice, then stood in front of Draco and asked breathlessly, “Will you? Can I?”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and opened his mouth to speak, but Harry interrupted him.
“Yes, shit,” Draco moaned, straining uselessly against the rope, “I need it, please.”
He was ready to resume his walking, but another noise, this time more muffled, reached his ears. Harry turned his head and stared at a nearly hidden alcove to his left, where the sound seemed to come from. Cautiously, he raised his wand and pulled the tapestry hiding the entrance to the alcove aside.
Harry felt something nudge his foot. He raised his head to look at Hermione, who was staring at him with concern. “You look a bit pale. Are you ok?”
Harry took a deep breath and tried again, “look, I know I’m possibly the last person you want to talk to right now, but I want a chance to set things right. Please? Meet me after dinner in the disused Defence classroom. It won’t take long.”
“Yeah sorry, Nev, thanks!” Harry replied, pace slowing to a fast walk until he reached the moving stairs.
“What about Pansy?”
As soon as Slughorn dismissed them, Malfoy packed his things and stood up to leave, while most of the students took a few seconds to kick into action. Harry hurried to grab his stuff too, but Slughorn stopped by where he was sat.
When Harry reached up to him, he realised he didn’t quite know what to say. “Er... Are you ok?” Harry felt like the world’s biggest wally. ‘Are you ok?’, really?
He felt guilty. Technically, he knew he didn’t assault Malfoy, but he couldn’t help but feel that had he not touched Malfoy first, nothing would’ve passed between them. Malfoy would’ve gotten himself off and gone back to his dorm. And maybe that was why he was avoiding Harry. He was disgusted. And he had every reason to be- hell, Harry felt disgusted at this realisation himself. But even then, he still couldn’t stop the memories from flooding back, and his body from reacting to them.
“Here? The noise would probably reach up to Gryffindor Tower, Potter.” Malfoy tilted his head back and swallowed, exposing the elegant arch of his throat and his bobbing Adam’s apple. Harry gulped. “I could hardly explore around the castle for a vacant classroom or empty loo, either. Not that it would work. I would either be seen or heard.”
“Mm...” Draco moaned softly, and Harry bit his lower lip gently.
you had one of those.”
“And I assume this is an invisibility cloak you’re carrying?”
“Yes, there
“Harry,” Hermione said and searched his gaze, “don’t you think it’s time to move past this rivalry of yours? So many things happened in the war, and really, I’m so tired of fighting. I don’t think I have the energy left in me to still hold grudges, let alone one that’s so old and crumbled.”
“Potter, most curses don’t leave you ‘drunk’, and the ones that do have the collateral effect of making you forget everything that went down. You know, like actual alcohol.”
Harry shook his head a bit to disperse the thoughts. Ron is right here, he reminded himself, and he absolutely does not need to see that. Right. Harry sighed internally and set his mind - he and Malfoy would talk and, if nothing else, at least he would get the opportunity to apologise.
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco muttered and covered his face with his hands.
Harry wanted to say, watching Malfoy leave the classroom. “Sure, professor.”
horny.”
Harry smiled back at her. “I’m sure he would love to know you’re keeping his tradition alive.”
“It’s none of your bloody business, go away,” he said with some difficulty. His voice had a breathy quality, and he seemed a bit panicked now, like he was caught in headlights and wanted desperately to make a run for it.
Harry gave a happy squeal and practically dragged Draco to his room. Draco bounded along behind Harry giggling happily. The noise sounded strange to him but it felt good to make it, so Draco let himself have fun and giggle as much as he wanted. "This one is mine! It's all mine, and Remus says I don't have to share if I don't want to, and all the toys are mine! I never had toys before I came here, because Dudley took them all away, but now I do. Isn't that great?" Harry beamed brightly, radiating pure joy.
He sighed a bit. "I used to live with Aunt Petunia and her husband and son. They're a lot like your mum, I think. They didn't want me to have any friends, though, and I didn't really pick the Weasleys. Uncle Remus said I needed friends, and took me there. You're the first person I wanted to be my friend that I can actually do something about."
It didn't take too long for a nice looking man in funny, shabby clothing to find him. Harry thought the man smelled familiar, and he trusted his senses. So he went with that man, and was taken care of after that. There were a couple of rough months, where he would sometimes wake up and the man would be hurt all over, and himself too, but he never remembered the man hurting him and he smelled truthful. It didn't take him long to become aware on full moons again, and realize that he was changing into an animal.
He winged away, heading to his destination. He liked delivering mail to his other favorite human. He didn't quite understand why his two favorite humans were determined to live apart, but he was sure eventually they'd figure it out and move in together. He'd just have to help his primary human be extra charming.
Draco settled back in to finish his breakfast. "Okay mother I will finish eating first." Draco said as he kept eating, trying to finish up quickly.
"Can I go play now? Or do you need me here to wait?" Draco asked anxiously hoping he could go play with his first ever friend. Draco started to bounce up and down excitedly as he waited for Remus's response. Draco reached his hand out to Harry's so that the boy could lead him away once he had permission.
(See the end of the chapter for
He nodded, listening intently when Draco talked about his cat he cuddled. "I hope she's not too mad at you for getting lost. I'll be sad if she is. I hope she doesn't get mad at me for helping you, and being your friend."
Within minutes they stepped out into their own house, dark and dreary as it usually was and at his Mother's request Draco went up to his room.
-DMHP-
"I'm not very good at letters yet, either." Harry confessed to his friend. "A-and if we can't write letters, then we'll still be friends. But I bet we'll be able to write letters." He was very confident, and sure that they'd be allowed to spend time together and keep in contact.
Harry bolted after his friend, grabbed Wolfy, and snuggled up with him. He could tell that Draco was very upset, and didn't want him to be so. He hugged his friend and his Wolfy close, his eyes watering. "Please don't cry, Draco."
"No, I didn't tell them. And I know you didn't tell them..." Harry was honestly baffled by Draco's question. He lifted the card, an eyebrow shooting up as he saw who the gift was from.
He grinned at Draco, his eyes bright, and got up, going over to his window, his magic dancing around him with his excitement. "My pet is over here. It's a little bit shy. I don't know if it's a girl or a boy, yet, but it's pretty!" He climbed onto the chair set beneath the window, then stood on it, opening the window so he could look out, trying to locate his pet.
"Sure! I would love to see your pet. What kind of pet is it?" Draco asked curiously but quietly. He had never had a pet before and his dad just had those weird birds outside the manor…
Ron grinned at Draco, completely willing by this point to fight for their budding friendship. This was something his siblings could never have, and he wasn't about to let it go for anything at all. He didn't care about what his parents would say, either. Draco and Harry were including him and cared that he was having fun. This was the best thing he'd ever had! "That sounds like a cool potion! Mum doesn't have time to teach me potions yet. The twins keep blowing them up, and she has to stop and fix things." He grinned. "And then ice cream after, yeah?"
"What the bloody hell, Potter?" Draco asked the letter in confusion. He honestly wasn't sure how to respond to it. He supposed it was someone's idea of a prank. There were people who forged Potter's handwriting and signature now, so it could just as easily have been one of them. He hadn't recognized the owl after all.
Harry frowned at Draco's explanation of his mother. "She really, really reminds me of Aunt Petunia now." He wondered if he could talk Remus into letting Draco stay with them, or if that would get them into trouble somehow. He knew he was allowed to stay with Remus because they had gone to a large building with lots of people, and there had been tests, and his name had been put down on some papers as something called a Werewolf. He guessed that was turning into the strange dog when the moon was full.
Harry, meanwhile, is simply baffled that his assignment from his Mind Healer has gone missing - even if he had crumpled the parchment up and tossed it away.
Harry watched, close enough that he could step in if Ron decided to be rude. He hoped that maybe they could make friends before Ron realized that Draco was a Malfoy, and that would help Ron get over it. He knew that Ron's parents didn't care for the Malfoys and that Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley often fought, but he hoped that maybe seeing Draco was different would change things for Ron.
-HPDM-
, or Siau Scops Owl. Harry liked him quite a bit. His spotty brown feathers and large round face made him look distinguished. He also enjoyed the bird's small 'horns.' That was another difference between Hedwig and this owl. Hedwig had never had those feathers that stuck up on the sides. But then, she'd been an entirely different sort of bird.
Draco's eyes lit up with excitement at Remus's suggestion. He couldn't remember the last time he had ice cream, he guessed it was a birthday at some point. Draco hugged Harry back hard, he was so glad for the contact with another human. Draco longed for human contact all the time, but when he was at Harry's he was given that, and his desire was at least somewhat sated.
Harry beamed a bit and dug in, munching happily. Remus had provided them milk and and juice, and Harry loved that. He prodded Draco gently. "Eat. It's really good. You'll like it." He squirmed and wriggled as he ate, happy that he got to eat at the table.
"I have been on my best behavior Mother, just as you have always told me to be. Harry is a very nice person and I really like being his friend. I would love to come back sometime and to be able to write to him! I can tell Father this as well if you want me to."
Out loud he said, "Hello my name is Draco. It's nice to meet you, what is your favorite game to play? Harry and I like to go on adventures in between our studies!" Draco finished excitedly, belatedly remembering to hold out his hand, as adults usually did, something about manners.
"Ummm are you sure? I...I can't accept this...that's too much, we just met. I mean I would love to have a real friend and all but you don't have to give me things to be your friend. And what do you mean by the first friend you have chosen?”
Harry spent the evening working on his letters and writing Draco a new letter. He talked about how he hadn't got caught about his snake, or at least he thought he hadn't, and he told Draco about all the things they could play the next time that they were together. Uncle Remus usually let him play anywhere in Diagon Alley, because there were always adults around who adored him. He often got free ice creams from Florean Fortescue, and thought that maybe Draco could get one too.
Remus checked Draco's face over for him. "You missed just a small spot, there." He cleaned it off for him. "You did very well at getting yourself clean." He smiled his tone warm and friendly. He quite liked Draco Malfoy, and thought that perhaps he would be good for Harry as well as Harry being good for him. He was, however, quite resigned now to the idea that Harry was likely going to be in Slytherin out of sheer stubbornness if Draco was sorted there.
"Draco, do you wanna see my pet?" He whispered it, eyes shining brightly. "Only you can't tell Uncle Remus, because I'm not s'posed to have pets yet." His eyes were shining with friendship, and a hope of his own. He was so glad he had run into Draco again.
Harry was pleased that Draco enjoyed the food. He thought Remus made the best food, and he was just happy that he didn't have to try to learn how  to cook it. He loved living with Uncle Remus, and he wished that they could keep Draco with them, too. He was sure now that he and Draco would be best friends, forever and ever.
"It is cool that snakes can smell with their tongues! Your snake friend is so pretty and friendly, I am glad you showed me, and I promise I won't tell Remus." Draco said with a smile at Harry, Draco had never really felt like he could trust anyone, but Harry seemed different somehow.
Harry looked back, fidgeting a bit, his eyes watery. He was smiling though, and happy to tell his friend what he knew. He was glad that Draco wasn't afraid of him, and that they could still be friends. He hoped they would be in the same House when they went to Hogwarts.
"Oooh!! Maybe we could all have sleepovers sometime too! Harry and I are supposed to have sleepovers at some point...maybe you could join us! Oooh maybe your birthday could be a sleepover day!!" Draco said practically bursting with excitement.
Harry smiled, eyes warm, glad that his friends were getting along and sensing that Ron was now going to champion Draco along with him. Draco caught Harry's smile, and returned it with one of his own. Then he followed his two friends to the Apothecary, laughing and rather carefree.
Draco stared at Ron as he talked, curious about some of the things he said. "Where would you have the party if not at your place? But if you are sure that you won't get into trouble, then I would love it if you asked your Mum if I could go to your party! But I am still not sure if mother will let me go. But a formal invitation might help her agree. I don't know if you were planning on sending out invitations but if you can get me one that would be great.”
Cajetan returned home, his duty complete. He re-settled on his perch, having taken the time to go hunting on his way back. Maybe his humans would get it through their heads that they belonged, now. If not, well... he'd just have to take more steps. He hoped they'd figure it out soon, though.
Draco loved spending time with Harry and Remus, it felt like home. Draco got happier and a little more confident as they spent more time together. His parents were happy with his reading and math improvements. Draco and Harry learned well together, and had a ton of fun playing as well when the learning session part of the day was over. One day, when Draco was dropped off, he heard that a friend of Remus and Harry’s would also be stopping by, which made him curious but also nervous…
The young boy known as Harry Potter lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin until he was about four years old. While he was there, they didn't treat him kindly at all. They were horrible, and starved him, and generally neglected him, favoring their own son instead while the boy in question took all of Harry's things and blamed him for all the problems. At least, that was up until he got bit by the funny looking dog after they locked him out on a full moon.
Draco finished speaking and bowed his head. He continued subconsciously rubbing his wrists and lower arms as he looked around for his mother. Not finding her, he looked back up at Harry, grateful to have someone to talk to.
Draco hugged Harry tightly, trying not to cry at the thought of leaving his friend and Remus and their warm home. He focused on his mother's words of "maybe they can do it again" to try to keep from crying. "I will write soon too. Maybe after I get your letter first though so I can respond. I am going to go home now and practice!" Draco said excitedly, as he was determined.
"It's not fun, but it could be worse. If you don't go all tense and fight it, it doesn't hurt as much. I used to fight it, sometimes a-and..." He bit his lip before he told a secret that wasn't his. "Draco, you have to promise not to tell people, okay? B-but I live with Uncle Remus because he's a Werewolf too. So I'm not alone when I change. But Uncle Remus still fights his wolf. He sometimes takes a potion that smells kind of like poison when he thinks he has to, but I think it drives the wolf inside crazy. I wish he wouldn't. I'm okay, I stay in control when I change, but Uncle Remus doesn't. I could probably... probably be okay. I've never changed with anyone but Uncle Remus. He doesn't want me to bite anyone on accident, but I don't think I ever will. Because I listen to my wolf. Maybe... Maybe when we go to school, we could try it out? You could stay with me."
Harry grinned brightly, his eyes sparkling. They gathered the books and had the shopkeep ship them to Remus, then they headed off to the next place. They had to get some groceries, and Harry was happy to lead them off to the Lands of Abundance. He was excited, because the last item on the list was a stop to bring home as much ice cream as they could afford after everything else.
Later that day, he met the rest of the Weasleys, and he and Remus went and had dinner at their house. Harry loved the Burrow. It smelled of safety, love, and home. He had always wished to find a place like that, but he had never expected to. Now, he had, and he was awed by it. Remus said they'd visit a lot, since Harry seemed to fit right into the madness that was the Weasleys.
Narcissa went upstairs to her room and wrote Remus back, without saying anything else to Lucius who was still at work.
Narcissa had put Draco to bed by the time the letter came in, merely a quick good night story, and then she shut Draco's bedroom door. He had a small, snake shaped magical light that turned on as the door shut. Draco heard his mother's footsteps get farther away and whimpered a little bit to himself and snuggled his cat stuffed animal close. His kitty made him feel safe even during the darkness and loneliness of his room. Draco rolled about in bed for a while, sad because he was alone and had wanted a hug-and partially because he was excited to see Harry again. Eventually though, Draco managed to get comfortable enough, wrapped up in his blankets to fall asleep. His warm blankets and plushie helped him to feel safe enough to sleep. Draco had fun filled dreams about playing with Harry and all the fun shenanigans they could get up to.
Narcissa chuckled a little at her son's urgency but figured as long as he didn't make a mess she wasn't going to argue with him. He finished his breakfast rather quickly and then approached his mother. "Might I have my letter now, please Mother?" Draco asked as politely as possible. Narcissa gave him the scroll and sat down with her own parchment and quill, ready to write to Remus as she had told Lucius she would. Lucius was already at work for the day and Narcissa had some time before she planned to leave the house. Sighing slightly, Narcissa started to write.
"Can we really have ice cream now? I would love that! That sounds awesome! I...I don't remember what kind of ice cream I like though...is that okay? And oooh you get extra ice cream? That's super nice of him to give you that!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shook his head, and set the now wrinkled piece of parchment aside. He'd been awake too long, and really ought to go to bed. He'd finish job hunting in the morning. He got up and took himself off to bed, unaware that this was only the first of many deliveries.
First long (ish) chapter! Hope you enjoy it! Draco is written by Meowfoy of course, and Harry is written by the lovely JoellethePoe!! Remus is sometimes shared by Meowfoy and Poe Narcissa is Meowfoy only as she generally is only around briefly when other characters are around.
"It's ok if you can't think of a joke right now. Maybe one will come to you later, or you can remember a good prank pulled by Fred and George to tell me about. Plus if you hang with them long enough, I am sure you will get good at pranking too!" Draco said earnestly, a smile lighting up his pale face.
"That's very good, Ron. You're doing very well." Remus gave Draco the next word to spell out, alternating between the two boys. Harry finished his book in the meantime, and came over to help, and soon they were passing the parchment in a circle.
Remus received the letter and sent a brief reply, having received it well after Harry had been tucked into bed. His heart ached a little bit for Draco, who surely only wanted his parents to show him love. It was sad, when parents were too busy for their child. Remus wished he could start a daycare, though he doubted that people would trust him with their children, given his condition.
Harry sees Draco for the first time, and decides that he looks lonely. An important decision is made.
Harry's confusion was evident as he pulled out a large, heavy bag from the box. He set it on the table next to the now much lighter box and opened it. He blinked rapidly, staring at the gleaming galleons as they shone up at him.
Harry squirmed his way into the hug as well, comforting Draco. "Uncle Remus just doesn't want them shouting. I don't like shouting much." He snuggled the blonde boy.
Which meant that Harry had to finally buckle down and pick out a new owl for real. One that was sturdy and reliable. The problem was that he just couldn't find the right one. He was getting desperate, and about to go looking up breeders when he finally hit a patch of good luck. He found an oddity, an owl about as odd as he was, and they simply clicked. It was almost the same as when Hagrid had bought him Hedwig as a gift. Or at least, it felt similar to Harry.
"Okay then, I am going to go send this now." Narcissa said as she left Draco's room.
"I heard you met a new friend today, son. Harry Potter was nice to you? That is good to hear. Your mother and I talked it over and I think you should be allowed to see Harry as often as you can. What do you think of that, Draco?" He asked.
“Double standards,” Draco muttered, and Harry pretended he hadn’t heard. “So you’re a ponce?”
“Pepper Imps,” McGonagall enunciated, and the winding stairs started to move. She noticed the look on Harry’s face and smiled a little sadly. “He loved his sweets, that man.”
“Really?” Harry said, surprised. He didn’t remember that condition coming up at his trial.
When he got there, pulling the tapestry aside with no warning, he was granted by the sight of Malfoy slack-jawed, his lips forming an ‘o’, eyes closed, and his hips undulating almost imperceptibly. He ogled blatantly, even as Malfoy’s eyes flew open and he opened and closed his mouth indignantly. “A little warning, maybe!” He said, panting a little.
Draco looked away. “Blaise was being disgusting. Wouldn’t shut up about the Engorgio jokes, so I told him off. He didn’t appreciate being called a ‘braindead buffoon whose mind was constantly in the gutter’, so he decided to ‘teach me a lesson’,” he said, making air quotes with his fingers.
Draco groaned. Harry said nothing.
“No, wait, hear me out first. I know what I did was a bit shitty, and you have every right to be mad at me. I should’ve taken the fact you were cursed into consideration and not made any moves, and there’s no excuse for that, so all I can say is sorry. I know you would never do what you did while sober, and it was taking advantage of you. So, yeah, I just want you to know that I’m not proud of my actions and I recognise the shittiness of them. So, yeah. And I also would like to take the opportunity to apologise for nearly killing you in sixth year, since I never did,” Harry said in two breaths, taking a huge gulp of air when he finished. He looked up.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed and pushed himself off the desk, “I agree. How shall we remedy that?” he spoke in a low voice, taking two steps forward until he stopped right in front of Harry.
Harry felt his face flame. He instinctively looked at Malfoy’s face for a second, before rapidly averting his eyes. Malfoy had his own closed and his expression was one of pure mortification. He breathed deeply, in and out, in and out, and seemed to be keeping himself on a very tight leash. The thought of Malfoy on a leash piqued the interest of Harry’s cock, and he quickly tried to distract himself.
“Oof. I’ll never understand Slytherin friendships...”
Draco suddenly looked uncomfortable. “I’m not really allowed to use my wand outside of classes.”
Draco bit his lower lip so hard it turned white. He was moaning nonstop now, like a chant. Harry bent forward and pushed his shirts up until his torso was mostly exposed, and took one nipple into his mouth.
“They probably don’t want us to use spells that could prove dangerous, like Serpensortia or something,” Harry said slowly, trying not to irritate Hermione further. “Honestly, I just think it’s a miracle they’re letting us practice at all. I know Kingsley isn’t a coward like Fudge was, but he still faces a lot of pressure from the Wizengamot. Barely half the school is back for the year, lots of parents are still scared shitless.”
Harry’s eyes didn’t move away. Malfoy did look a bit ill, staring at his food with a blank expression on his face. He didn’t even seem to notice Harry’s scrutiny like he used to before. “Yes, I know. I was at his trial.”
Draco nodded impatiently and moved forward, fitting Harry’s cock into his mouth and sucking eagerly. Harry’s knees nearly gave way when he felt the hot silkiness of Draco’s mouth and the delicious pressure. Draco moaned freely around Harry’s cock, the vibrations travelling all the way to his groin and making him shiver. Harry thrust as gently as he could, afraid he would hurt Draco. He didn’t know if he had ever done something like this before, but judging by his skills, maybe he had.
Across the hall, Malfoy rose from his seat. Harry’s heart picked up speed.
“Why the hell have you been avoiding me, then?” Harry demanded, indignant.
Harry felt himself flush a bit. “Did you sleep well?”
Harry rose from his seat and nodded politely. “Thanks, professor, you too.”
Well, when he noticed the very obvious boner straining against the seam of his trousers.
“If we’re quick, yes. There’s nowhere in the castle you could have the privacy you need, so we’ll go outside.”
“Oh. Well, once... but I don’t want to talk about it.”
“What the fuck?” Malfoy panted, struggling to free himself. Harry was going on pure instinct, and managed to wandlessly cast a mild Incarcerous, binding Malfoy’s hands behind his back. Malfoy’s eyes grew huge, almost comically so, and his erection throbbed noticeably. “Merlin, Potter.”
“Apparently,” Malfoy said, looking down at his lap, his face turning pink, “it makes you... really horny. Unbearably so. And extra sensitive.”
“Really bad, I want it so bad,” Draco whispered, writhing with need.
Malfoy twitched a bit as Blaise Zabini, one of the few returning Slytherin eighth years, accidentally elbowed him in his efforts to humour the other occupants of their table. He scowled and scooted farther down the left of the bench, which was empty save for a few misplaced first years. Harry was surprised to see there was no hissy fit thrown and found himself worrying, too.
“Malfoy! Wait up!”
Draco bucked his hips, seeking contact, but Harry pulled himself up and stayed out of reach. “Fuck fuck fuck, ok, will you please suck me off please,” Draco begged, squeezing his eyes shut and opening them a moment later, watching Harry's every move.
The sight tipped Harry over. He pulled out of Draco’s mouth and wanked furiously as his orgasm hit him like lightning. “Fuck!”, he half-yelled, his come missing Draco's body by a small inch and hitting the grass instead.
“I haven’t! I didn’t know what to say, and I feel that’s pretty understandable, given I had your cock in my mouth last night and came untouched sucking you off!”
“Sure, Headmistress,” Harry said, a little alarmed, and nodded at Ron and Hermione. They nodded back, muttered ‘’night, professor’, and walked away. Harry followed McGonagall in silence, looking behind his shoulder at the crowd dispersing. The ruckus had been subdued at the threat of detention with Filch.
Light shot out from the tip of Harry’s wand. Malfoy was sitting very still, back perfectly straight. Harry quickly assessed him, looking for any obvious injuries or something that could be causing pain. Malfoy’s fists were balled at his sides, and Harry was about to ask whether he’d been hexed, when he noticed... oh.
Even worse, when he had wanted to take back his wand, his body had reacted instantly, especially a part of his anatomy that he never thought he would see waking up in his presence.
“Why not… If it will allow you to learn humility…” he sneered.
Harry smiled. It was a fresh start after living hell last year. They were finally going to be able to continue their lives peacefully.
He knew that Malfoy had been very patient with him, he had felt it as he touched him without ever going further in his own actions. He did not however think that Malfoy wanted more.
She pointed him to a chair to sit on and sat down in the armchair in front of him, joining her hands on her desk.
Whatever Malfoy said about it, he had only responded to the spell which he had cast to him, thus engendering an interminable series which had concluded with the famous
Harry walked faster, determined to speak to Malfoy, no longer able to bear the grip that Malfoy had on him.
So Harry was completely stuck.
He then began looking for the Golden Snitch and blinked his eyes when he realized that even the sky seemed cloudy. He looked around and noticed that his teammates were becoming more and more difficult to distinguish.
Malfoy recoiled again and finally met the edge of his desk. He opened wide his eyes for a second before closing them in spite and opening them to look to the side, bitterly realizing that he could not move.
Draco felt sore, understanding the implication in Harry’s remarks. He knew full well at what stage their relationship was in Potter’s last memories and he apparently wished that they would return. His heart shook at the simple thought, that the Harry standing in front of him did not want his presence at his side, or at least not as he had shared it for the past few years.
“Is it Hermione talking or is it you?” Harry retorted, turning your head to Ron in a wicked gaze.
Even after all that, he still seemed suspicious. But Harry didn’t want to stop there, he wanted to prove to him how conscious he was of wanting him. He stared his eyes on those of Malfoy, getting his face closer to his, until he brushed his lips.
His gaze turned to witch photos where Ron and Hermione were with him, smiling and bickering.
"And then … we had all understood for a long time ..." he added to Potter's intention in a stare.
«Oh you see, I’m not sure that you are old enough to hear it, my dear brother» Ginny sneered exchanging an accomplice glance with Harry.
Harry closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and oxygenated his brain to give himself the courage to recover his mind.
“It’s hard to believe, but given the number of guys around him, I guess his bedside skills are better than the rest of him.” Ron hissed, wincing.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows slightly and then very slowly stretched a smirk which he struggled to master.
The next few days, he was back to being himself. He had thought of Malfoy only informally and had not seen him since that famous night. He continued peacefully to live his student life as she had begun and stopped formalizing what had happened.
Harry was thinking about the warmth he felt in his heart every time he looked at Malfoy, every time he smiled at him, and it scared him terribly.
He had always felt this feeling for Malfoy. Hatred so cold that it scared him sometimes.
, Potter. As I just told you, it’s not going to change the current situation, so I see no reason to talk to her about it.” he replied, stooping again to pick up his briefcase.
“Going out with the Weaslette I assume, Potter?” asked Draco, unsure of why he wanted to know where he was going, or why he even said anything at all.
“Yes, really. Now are we going to keep standing out here in the cold hallway, or do you want to come in and we can continue snogging, in my warm bed? Do I have to call you prince to get you to say yes?”
” Hearing his name from Harry’s mouth was something he had never realized he wanted to hear before. It gave him this weird feeling in his stomach, which he chose to ignore for now. “Am I a better date than whoever stood you up?”
“Draco Malfoy, would you do me the honors of making this already pretty much a date into a real date?” Harry was blushing, and Draco found the whole image quite adorable. He took the misshapen flower from Harry, and took a bite out of what seemed to be the stem. He acted as if he was judging his answer based on how it tasted, and to be honest, it wasn’t half bad.
“No, it isn’t. You must be lucky that I love you too.”
“I am not calling you that.” Draco was laughing as they entered the common room, something he had almost forgotten he could do. They were outside of Draco's room, as it had been closer to the entrance, and Harry looked unsure of what to do next. They were looking at each other, processing the night's events. It was really all of a sudden, that Draco decided to lean the few inches forward and connect his lips to Harry's. It was an immediate burst of fireworks in his chest, as Harry slowly kissed him back, almost pushing him up against the dorm door. This was the happiest either boy had felt in ages, finally getting what they had both wanted for so long, even if they were unknowing of it. When they finally broke apart, Harry was blushing hard and smiling wide.
“Who said anything about this being a date?” Draco focused on making his pancakes, almost out of batter. He could see Harry out of the corner of his eye trying to pour his batter in some shape, almost as if trying to make art. It was a few minutes later that Harry had turned back to Draco, holding some poor attempt at a pancake rose on his spatula.
“People don’t chase after me, Malfoy.” Harry could see that Draco wanted to get Harry’s attention away from the pan, but he was determined not to mess up the first one. “You know, they always say the first pancake is always the worst to come out, but I don’t believe it. Stop doing that.” Draco was twirling his wand, making little drawings of Harry in the air.
“How will you know it isn’t burning?” Draco was very confused as to how cooking really worked in general, as he had been fed by house elves for most of his life.
“I suppose,
“After all this time? You know, Potter, all I ever wanted was to be your friend.” Green eyes met grey at these words, and Draco suddenly realised how hard it was for him to hide his true feelings right now. It felt as if his world was crashing down, just because of a dumb, messy haired boy looking him in the eyes.
“You think I would know you well enough by now to know you clearly have something to say. I didn’t spend 6 years of my life watching you across the great hall for it to result in nothing.” Draco said, immediately regretting it afterwards realizing what he had admitted to.
, this could be a date. This pancake isn’t even awful like I expected.”
“Oh really, Malfoy? You watched me for six years, yeah?” Harry was finally looking towards Draco, trying to attempt a smirk but failing. “Of course, I already knew that, you know. I kind of did the same thing to you. Am I allowed to ask you why, though?”
They worked in silence for the next few minutes, with occasional insults at how the other was pouring or stirring. It was a comfortable silence, something that the two boys didn’t get often, with catching up on schoolwork and constantly being asked about their experience in the war. For Harry, these were always positive conversations, people simply wanting to know how the ‘Golden Boy’ was doing, but for Draco, it never went as well. Draco was sure Harry knew the things people said about him, for being on the wrong side of the war and all. It was slowly getting better, nearing the end of the school year anyway, so Draco just kept ignoring them and keeping to himself.
thought Draco, as he walked back to his room.
He hadn’t even noticed how much time had passed, letting his mind wander while he watched his classmates. This was only a little bit upsetting to Draco, he had a slight feeling that this would have been a set up to make a fool of the death eater once again. He sighed as he stood up, getting ready to go back to his room without food  for a nap. As he was walking down, Harry had walked out of his own room, dressed in a nice green jumper and black muggle jeans.
“You’re an idiot Gryffindork, you know that Harry?” Draco was smiling at him as they broke apart, hands remaining on the other yearning for warmth.
“Do you know what today is, Potter?”
“There it is! The answer to the question that crosses the friendship line. But did they really make you cook for them? That’s awful, we had house elves do our cooking.” They were piling their pancakes onto plates, and Harry started to top his with whatever sugar he could find in the large kitchen.
“You’re getting awfully close to the friendship line there, Potter, wouldn’t want to cross that now would you?” They were nearing the kitchens, and Draco was starting to hope they were nearing the end of this conversation topic. He didn’t need to reveal to his supposed rival that he really just wanted to be his friend.
“Wow, very funny. If you won’t answer the question, then at least tell me what to do to help.” Draco rolled up his sleeves, seeing Harry glance down quickly at his dark mark. Draco expected him to say something about it, but Harry simply looked away to explain how the batter was made.
“What do you mean by trying to? When have you once tried to flirt with me. I thought you were supposed to be the oblivious one!”
He was cut off by Draco kissing him again, this time rougher and more sure. Draco’s hands slid into his unruly hair, and he reacted by wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. This kiss was much better than the first one had gone, and neither one wanted it to end. They were lucky it was late, and no one was in the corridor to see them. Harry almost wanted to ask to spend the night with Draco, but not wanted to push too far again and ruin the night.
“You’re one to talk, your hair looks like you’ve just been out flying,” Draco stopped mid sentence. This was not happening right now, was it? “Are we fucking
“I think I would like that too. I would prefer you didn’t slip me a love potion though, that might make me change my mind.” They continued to eat their messy pancakes, occasionally making a joke or saying a meaningless insult. The night had been going very well overall, both boys having the most fun they had had in months.
“First date? Does this imply there will be a second?” replied Harry, smiling as he set his plate down and sitting across from Draco.
“My pleasure, of course, I am your prince in shining armor, aren’t I?”
“Are you planning on poisoning me?”
Harry sighed. “We need to talk.”
A sudden noise interrupted his train of thought. He stopped walking and looked around for the source. In the empty corridor, it sounded eerily echo-y and hinted at someone in pain.
“Yes.”
Harry ate his dinner without tasting it. He did everything automatically, even when Ron and Hermione talked to him, smiling at the right moments and nodding his head at the right pauses. The only thing he could focus on was the fluttery jitters in his belly, the anticipation. He knew he should be nervous about the awkward situation he was about to get himself in, and he was, but deep down he also felt... hopeful. As if maybe, if Malfoy just allowed him to explain-
“Blimey, Harry!” Neville said, holding his hands in front of him defensively, “No need to rush, there’s still plenty of food left!”
Harry stood there, dumbly, watching as Malfoy stroked himself furiously and gasped, his hips moving rhythmically, matching his hand’s pace.
Harry woke up late for breakfast. He’d gone straight to bed last night, but couldn’t sleep, the images of what he and Malfoy had done replaying in his mind, over and over again. He'd wanked twice before managing to fall into unconsciousness. He rushed around the dorm, grabbing his robes and books and brushing his teeth at the same time, and when he was done, he dashed down the stairs. As he exited the common room, he almost ran into someone.
“I do not wish to hold you back from your rest, Harry. You will need to be whole in the morning, and so will I, so I won’t take long.” She dropped two sugar cubes in her tea and stirred. “I just wanted to remind you that, for obvious reasons, certain spells weren’t included on that list. You know, of course, that some charms and curses were invented by professor Severus Snape, and it has come to my attention that you can cast some of them. While they are not traceable due to their unofficial nature, I must ask you to refrain from using them. If caught, you could bring great trouble not only on you but on me, as well. The ministry does not take well to things done without their knowledge.” She smirked a bit and clinked her spoon on the rim of her mug, setting it down on the saucer.
Malfoy moved without hesitation, using the tree to lift himself up, his eyes glued on Harry’s face. Harry placed his shirt where he would sit back down and, in one swift movement, pulled Draco’s trousers and pants down to his ankles.
“You’ll have to hold on to that self-control of yours until we’re safely out,” Harry said, and threw the cloak over Malfoy, “or Filch will catch us and I’ll have to pretend
They made their way to the Entrance Hall without incident. Harry walked fast, and the only evidence he had of Malfoy’s presence were the little stifled moans and groans the Slytherin couldn't suppress behind him. When they reached the big, heavy doors, Harry checked to see that no one was coming before pushing them open, trying to make as little noise as possible. He held one open for Malfoy to pass, feeling the ghostly brush of the invisible body on his back.
Malfoy muttered something that sounded suspiciously like ‘as if you aren’t’.
“Your parents didn’t really defend the mass murder of innocents, did they?” Ron pointed out. “Actions have consequences, is what I think.”
“Sorry, mate, I tried waking you but you were sleeping like the dead,” Ron said, taking a swig of his pumpkin juice.
“I’m fine, Herm, really. It’s first day jitters, is all,” Harry noted absently, his gaze falling automatically on the table across the room. Malfoy looked better than yesterday, but he still had a frown etched on his face. He lifted his eyes and looked back at Harry, and for a second, they were the only ones in there. Then Malfoy dropped his gaze and took a bite of his blueberry muffin. Harry blinked and turned to Hermione. “Double potions today, yeah?”
Malfoy held his gaze steadily for what seemed to be several hours, as if searching for something, and nodded. Then he strode off without a second glance at Harry.
“See you later, Harry,” Ron said as he stood to leave, taking Hermione’s hand. Harry didn’t think he would ever get used to the feeling of being the slightly estranged third wheel to his best friends.
Ron nodded, looking more alert. “Utter shite, I tell you that. Next, they’ll be refusing to teach us defensive spells. Again.” At the mention of the Umbridge fiasco, Hermione’s scowl became even more pronounced.
Harry recognised the bait, but he took it anyway. “Well, I won’t lend you a hand, if that’s what you’re suggesting. Honestly, I know it’s weird, but can’t you just find some empty bathroom and take care of that? I doubt you’ll happen upon someone at this time of night. Or maybe run to the dungeons and solve the problem in your bed.”
Malfoy stared at him for a second and then drawled, “Mastermind Potter, how come I haven’t thought of that?”
“Er, thank you, professor Slughorn, I’ll be- er- sure to remember that.”
Malfoy was sat inside, glaring at him with a passion. “Fuck off, Potter,” he hissed threateningly, narrowing his eyes.
Before he knew it, Harry was moving forward and kneeling in front of Malfoy. He grabbed his right wrist and forced it out of Malfoy’s trousers, then grabbed his left, which was clutching blades of grass, and held them in his hands.
She shook her head, seemingly amused. “Oh, he knows.”
McGonagall raised one hand and continued. “These spells were considered to do, and I quote, ‘more harm than good’, and any students performing them inside this institution will have to answer to me and the Minister. While no punishment is to be enforced, there may be a series of questions inquiring about the caster’s intentions, and pains will be taken to ensure total honesty,” she spoke the last sentence reluctantly, one corner of her mouth turning down. “The list has been put up by Mr. Filch on the notice board. You may check it after dinner. For now, let us feast.”
Harry spent the entirety of potions class staring at the back of Malfoy’s head. He kept being assaulted by flashes of what happened between them, and Harry feared he would end up popping a hard on with Ron sitting beside him. He had to talk to Malfoy, to set things straight. Maybe, they could even... Except they couldn’t. Malfoy hated his guts, and if last night he’d appeared eager to do anything sexual with Harry, it was because he was cursed. He would’ve probably done it with the first person to find him, and had it not been Harry it would’ve been-
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, pulling himself up, “’night, Herm.”
Harry smiled politely and nodded, excusing himself. He had little time to think about anything else after that, as he ran the rest of the way to Advanced Charms, for which he was late.
When Harry made it to the Entrance Hall, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Sighing, Harry pulled the cloak over himself and started for the stairs.
As he made his exit, he wished fervently that McGonagall hadn’t brought up the subject of his doomed fight with Malfoy. He still hadn’t apologised and felt so guilty it nearly choked him sometimes. It’s not as if Malfoy were completely guilt-free, but still-
“Serves him right, honestly,” Ron continued around his bite of mashed potatoes, one hand in front of his mouth, “He got lucky his sentence is only community service, and he was even granted the opportunity to complete his studies first. Maybe he’ll actually do some good for our society, now.”
“What?”
Harry helped himself to eggs and bacon. “Yeah, I had a bit of insomnia.”
“Come on, let’s go,” Hermione said, already walking towards the staircases. Ron and Harry tagged behind her, but a voice interrupted their path.
“I don’t hold any grudges, Hermione. Obviously, I haven’t completely forgiven him, even after he apologised at his trial, as some things aren’t so easily pardoned. But I no longer want to gouge my eyes out at the sight of him.”
“Ah!” Again, Draco was so aroused he sounded nearly pained. Harry’s cock was rock hard in his jeans, and every noise made by Draco inched him closer to the edge.
“Did you not understand?” Harry asked, feeling himself start to panic. He didn’t think he would have the guts to say it all again.
Malfoy got up and gasped. “Fuck.”
“Yes, why?”
“So what are you saying?”
Harry removed his outer shirt, placed it on the grass, beside Malfoy’s bum, and simply said, “Up.”
“Malfoy, are you ok?” Harry took one step forward, ignoring Malfoy’s muttered ‘piss off’. “Lumos.”
“Oh, Merlin... so good...” Malfoy was starting to become incoherent, his moans getting louder by the second and body twitching and squirming of its own accord.
“We are talking.”
“Why did he?”
“Yeah, I heard,” Harry said politely. He didn’t miss her at all. “You know, you never told me why Blaise cursed you.”
“I’ll talk to professor Slughorn about getting some Dreamless Sleep for you today.”
“Huh,” Harry said, feeling his stomach flip. There was something about seeing Malfoy like this, fighting so hard to keep a hold of himself, to not lose control... “Well, don’t you want to... you know... I can leave if you want?”
Draco pursed his lips. They were very nice lips, Harry noticed, pink and soft looking. “Probably. I don’t think I’ve ever had a real interest in the female anatomy.”
“Merlin’s balls,” Malfoy muttered, letting out a quiet noise that sounded like a moan. “I’ve been cursed, alright? By Blaise, that motherfucker.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. Power dynamics were really complicated, especially among pureblood families, and it seemed like the scale wasn’t tipping to Draco’s side at the moment.
They kissed for several minutes, exploring each other’s mouths, gently caressing hair, napes, cheeks and upper arms. When they parted with a soft ‘pop’, lips glistening with saliva, both boys just gazed at each other, enjoying the headiness of a satisfactory kiss. Draco leant towards Harry and pecked him twice on the lips, before trailing down to nibble at his neck. Harry sucked in a sharp breath and tilted his head back, giving Draco better access. They both were breathing heavily, feeling each other’s erections pressing between them, demanding.
“So, what is it then?” Harry said, exasperated by Malfoy’s evasive sarcasm.
The blond turned his head in Harry's direction and grimaced a little, but stopped and waited for him at the corner of the corridor.
,” Harry said pointedly.
Harry frowned. “He cursed you... with a boner?” It sounded funny when said aloud, but Malfoy wasn’t laughing.
“Good,” she said and peered at Harry beseechingly. “We do not want another incident like the one with mister Malfoy, do we?”
It was so hot, seeing Draco finally lose control, and knowing he’d been the cause... Harry gave a satisfied smirk. “That’s more like it,” and then he bent down and licked Draco’s cock once, all the way from the base to the tip. Draco threw his head back with such force that he hit it against the tree with a cracking noise, but he didn’t seem to care.
He'd only stayed with them a month after that. He felt achy and sick that whole month, until the next full moon. He couldn't remember the day or the night, but once it was over he felt much better. His family, however, wanted nothing to do with him, and drove him to the middle of London and dropped him off where his aunt said 'his kind' would be able to find him.
Harry beamed at Remus once he'd caved, giving a happy wriggle. "It's okay, Draco. You can stay and have dinner with us, and then when we're done, you can color with me until your parents come. And if they don't, then you can sleep in my bed with me. It's huge! Uncle Remus got it for me." He tugged his friend toward the bathroom, where they could clean up and Draco wouldn't feel so ashamed to cry.
It had taken a few sessions, but Harry had finally come to terms with the damage that Vernon Dursley had done to his psyche in terms of his sexuality. The Dursley's insistence that everything be, "normal, thank you very much," had convinced him that he had needed to find a girlfriend and caused him to suppress any interest he might have had in men. Harry didn't think he was very good at being gay, but he did think that he was gay. How else did you explain sixth year?
Harry's word proved true. Molly came with a boy close to their age, with bright red hair. The boy didn't look very happy to be there, but Molly said something about the rest of the kids having some sort of sickness and Ron being lucky not to catch it, and wanting him away for the day so that she could brew remedies and Floo St. Mungo's without worrying that he would be bored or also get sick.
Draco finished speaking and finally looked back up at Remus, hoping the man wouldn't judge him for his parents' name, and wanting Remus to see the true happiness in his eyes as he spoke about Harry.
Remus followed after the boys, and sat to gather them both into his lap. "I'm not mad, Draco. I know you're excited. And you didn't give away any secrets, you were very excited, but you also were careful. That's a very good skill. I didn't say we'd talk about sleepovers because I don't want you to have them, I said it because we do need to talk and plan for it. We need to make sure it will be alright. And I more than think you can be friends with Ron. I think you already are, and he's not about to let you stop being his friend."
Draco asked nicely, wanting Ron to go first if he felt comfortable doing so. Draco was just glad to be at Remus's house, surrounded by friends and love, something he had never really had before. Draco waited for Ron to answer, excited to be doing something with this new friend of his. Draco did search briefly for Harry though, as Harry had become a bit of a fixture in Draco's world at this point. Draco saw Harry was happy and completely engrossed in his book so Draco figured he would let his friend be, and work with Ron and Remus.
Draco giggled happily at the snake and bowed his head as a sign of respect. "I am sorry friend, I didn't realize you could understand us. But I am glad you do. It's nice to meet you, glad you are okay with me petting you." Draco said and then he proceeded to scratch the scales on the snake's hood. He did it softly and carefully not wanting to be too rough with the snake.
I am super excited to be bringing this project of ours to you all here and I hope you love it! Poe and Reap are amazing writers so check them out too!
Remus received Narcissa's letter after Harry had been put to bed, and read it over carefully. He smiled a bit at the mention of Draco coming the next day, already thinking of what he needed to do to take care of two little boys instead of just one. He wrote back promptly, actually finding himself quite excited that Harry had made such a close friend so quickly.
He found it, and started calling to it. His voice sounded different when he did, more slippery and sibilant. "Hey, you can come in. Uncle Remuss isn't here. I want you to meet my friend, Draco." He reached for something just out of view, and came back in the window with a small snake wrapped around his arm and bright eyes.
Narcissa gave Draco a small smile and said; "That sounds like a good idea, I like that initiative Draco! Try to have your room tidy by tonight and then you will definitely be allowed to see Harry tomorrow. Maybe I will even give you some money to spend in Diagon Alley. But this room has to be tidy for the money to be given out, okay?"
Draco giggled a bit as Harry led him quickly yet gently through the street, to his home. He enjoyed the difference just holding hands made when running through the streets. Harry was gentle and didn't pull him so much as guide him as they ran along. Whereas Draco's mom usually left bruises when they walked for too long... Judging by the outside, Draco could tell it was much smaller than his home, but somehow he got the feeling that it was still nicer, and had more warmth. Draco stopped outside Harry's door and hesitated, suddenly unsure of his welcome again. His parents didn't really seem to want him so why would anyone else welcome him in? Harry was nice but he seemed to be the exception, not the norm.
