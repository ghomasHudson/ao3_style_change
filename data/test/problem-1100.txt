Remus Lupin felt dirty. It wasn’t only an effect of staying in the woods for a whole week. He used cleaning charms on himself every morning and again when he had found a safe place to sleep. It wasn’t the same as taking a shower but it fulfilled its goal. No, he felt dirty because of where he was. The wolf inside of him growled as he stood at the edge of the forest, looking down at the large mansion seated in the valley below. It was an impressive building, more impressive than practical. The owners obviously wanted everyone to know that they had more money than any normal person would earn during their whole lifetime.
Harry looked down on his hands. They looked perfectly fine to him. Then he fully realized what the snake had said.
: I was told to tell you that you need to inform us appropriately early in advance of the date of your wedding as we need to tell our tailor about the theme of the wedding at least two months before the dress rehearsal.
: I know we talked about this before, but are you guys really okay with me being adopted by snape first
I acknowledge the pain you all surely suffered due to my absence (look at me thinking I'm important, give it up for self-confidence, everybody), and therefore I am paying you back with TWO long-ish chapters (pls love me again). The first one (this one) is more about humour and the second one, which I will upload tomorrow evening will have Actual Plot™.
Harry tried to understand her words, but it was difficult for him to grasp the concept. Whenever he had been angry before, it had only made his life more complicated. Getting angry at Uncle Vernon had resulted in a blue eye and no food. Getting angry at his classmates let everyone believe he was ‘unstable’. Or possessed by Voldemort. Over the years he had learned to swallow his anger down and to go on with all his fury hidden behind a mask. It didn’t always work, but at least less people were yelling at him to ‘grow up and stop complaining like a little boy’. But now, for the first time, he thought that maybe he had the
, the animal answered, sounding slightly miffed. But before Harry had the chance to protest again, she continued.
: I thought pavati and lavender would have burned down our house down by now because of the “subtle” homophobia
Padma believes her chatname proves that she’s indeed the smarter one because she capitalized the first letter of each word.
Narcissa nodded. “He might be a bastard, but he would never send me a poisoned or cursed letter – at least not yet, not while he still believes that we will come back to him.” She opened the letter, her fingers moving cautiously as if she was holding a snake ready to attack. “Nevertheless, the content of the letter is simply atrocious. How dare he threaten me like that.”
: but at least my brother will probably stop setting me up on poorly disguised dates with his friends
: Well, for example when you make a potion, it matters which knife you use right? It matters if it’s sharp or blunt, and often you need to make sure that you cleaned it completely after cutting something. And the way you cut stuff matters too! As well as the order you put everything into the cauldron.
: I mean I know potions was never really one of my strong subjects, but I know enough to understand how great your work is
Malfoy seemed to wince at his own name, but he agreed to call the potion master. Before he turned away, he hesitated for a second and looked at Dumbledore questioningly. “Professor, I think I felt a wave of powerful magic just a minute ago. Do you know what –“
: Um… sure? Hi everyone, my name is Harry. I’m a student at Hogwarts and I’m excited to talk about the topic of muggleborn integration today.
Now, I’ve just noticed that my assistant has scheduled lunch for me with Fudge. Since it’s Monday, can I assume that I can cancel the lunch?
: ALSO whos gonna listen to your three hour TED talks about integration vs assimilation of muggleborns if not me
, spells that every student his age could cast. But now that he was watching the core of his magic running through his body, he felt the potential behind all that power. Somehow he had the feeling of swimming against the tide – if he could just learn in which direction the water was going, then he could turn around and swim with it. His magic could be faster and stronger.
Dumbledore waited for Moody’s nod before turning towards Lupin. “Remus, if you could try to reestablish your ties to Greyback’s pack –“
Harry opened his eyes for a second. There were lights lazily floating above him, but he was quite sure that they weren’t real. Rising his hand to find out if he could touch him was too much of a struggle though. He simply stared at them for a few seconds before closing his eyes again.
It's later than I had hoped to update, but it's still Sunday evening where I am, so it totally counts as updating on schedule :D
Now some unfortunate news: Because of my exams I won't be able to post the next chapter until monday in two weeks. I hope you understand that I really need to soley focus on my exams for the next two weeks.
: never in their whole existence have british people been known to express their feelings in an “enthusiastic” way
: no the publishers didn’t want the books (idiots, all of them) and sev doesn’t have the funds to publish them himself
: and u kinda trust him a lot bc he saved you bout 100 times just last week but u still can’t stand him bc he’s a dick
This is a shorter chapter, sorry about that. It's also not proof-read because I'm professional like that. As predicted, my work place has decided that days after days of 36+°C summer heat was the perfect opportunity to bury me in stuff to do. Great times.
“Ron? Hermione? I don’t want to know why there is a silencing charm around your room, but Mum said we should come downstairs. Something about Harry.”
Let's be real all of the memes belong to someone else and tumblr is a constant source of inspiration, but the "Say ‘I can’t do any of this shit… yeet’" joke i saw only recently, and i would link you the source but trying to find it via The Google only gets me a ton of links to Ten Steps To Overcome Depression and shit sooo....
So as you might have noticed, there is now a final number of chapters added. At the moment I'm pretty sure there'll only be 15 chapters, because those sum up the plot which holy fuck how did this fic even develop a plot???
: so me and Harry were texting last night bc we both couldn’t sleep and we can do that these days without u know insulting each other and that’s still kinda making me nervous bc I could easily fuck that up so… I might have started rambling
Ron was about to reassure her, though he wasn’t really sure how to do it. Therefore, he didn’t know if he was annoyed or relieved when a knock on his door interrupted their conversation.
Molly looked at her, feeling horribly helpless herself. “Well, I’m afraid I can’t tell you everything.” She held up her hands again to stop the immediate protests from the three children. “But I can tell you that he had been kidnapped by Death Eaters. They held him imprisoned in some kind of cell, but he was able to escape.”
: but we only just became friends and I really don’t want to fuck this up I wanted this since we were like eleven and I really like this being friends thing we have and if we start u know dating I would probably fuck that up because I’m me and then we wouldn’t date and we wouldn’t be friends anymore either because that’s awkward and I just really don’t want that to happen
Oh right. Well then, good thing you went to the meeting this morning. I am afraid I will also not make it to lunch, so cancel my appointment with Amelia. I will go to the 1pm meeting, as I have quite a few important things to discuss with Lord Wallory, but maybe you should go to the meeting at 3pm as I’m not sure how long the appointment with Lord Wallory will take.
As Ms. Granger’s Head of House, I am writing you in regards to her feedback for this school year. Hogwarts has decided to introduce this evaluation as a method to increase transparency of the education system and your daughter’s development.
Trembling with fear, the two Death Eater closed the cell again. They took their time returning to the main hall where the Dark Lord and the other Death Eaters were waiting. In their minds they were saying Goodbye to their families as they stepped into the hall and towards their death.
Unfortunately, Minister Fudge will not be able to attend today’s meeting, nor the meeting with the Hogwarts Governors. As I will attend in his stead, I have looked through your suggestions as well as the Governors’ proposal and I believe that the demands of the Governors are well-reasoned.
: big gay softie with latent murderous tendencies like FUCK YEAH sign me tHE FUCK UP mmmhHHHHMMMMM THAT’S SOME GOOD SHIT
If you feel like you need a vacation - take it. That's all I'm gonna say here, but if you are that overworked intern who gets guilted into doing overtime, or that employee who feels like the company is gonna crash if you take a week off - listen, if you need a vacation. Take it. Don't """power through""".
Immediately, the former silence was interrupted by angry and nervous shouts. Dumbledore himself closed his eyes for a few seconds. The white-haired wizard seemed to age a few years just sitting there. The tumult continued for a short amount of time until a loud growl silenced them all. Everyone stared at Lupin, who’s eyes appeared to gleam a little more yellow than normally. Obviously the usually so calm man was loosing his patience.
, interrupted Harry the animal. He could feel his blue magic, the emotional center of his power the snake had explained, perk up and felt its approval as he expressed his frustration freely.
Narcissa nodded, no sign of the pain she had endured noticeable in her face. She would do it again and again, endure all the pain her husband and his Lord had thrown at her and even more if it meant she was able to stay at her son’s side.
: Yes. My uncle got a bit freaked out by all the letters you know? After he burned the first few, they just kept coming and coming. Hundreds of them. Naturally, he lost it and took us all away to this tiny island. It didn’t even have electricity. Not sure what his plan was, exactly, to be honest.
10:15am: Meeting with Mrs. Wallory (Head of Dep. of Finances) regarding the cut of the Hogwarts budget
The silence in the large room was a strained and tired one. Several people were sitting around the large table, some staring at the wooden surface, some nervously looking at the others. Some men and women had chosen to stand instead of transfiguring something into a chair. It seemed as if they were all waiting for something, or someone. At the head of the table, the oldest of the present wizards and witches was sitting in a simple, wooden chair. Albus Dumbledore, one of the most powerful wizards in the world, looked older than ever. His eyes lacked the amused sparkle which had given them all a little bit of hope in other dark times. But today, Dumbledore seemed to be weary, as if he had lost a battle he hadn’t even known he was fighting.
: you can tell your mum that we wouldn’t invite you to an orgy anyway, so your name is safe and pure
I'm dead tired, I've had a team workshop the entire day, incl. dinner and drinks, so now it's almost 11pm and tomorrow I have work again and I really need my 8 hours of sleep but there's not enough time and I'm rambling.
Hermione Granger was frustrated. Her best friend had disappeared and nobody was telling her anything. Also, the book in front of her didn’t make any sense and she hated it when that happened. She was used to trust people with authority and to trust books, and in this moment both were letting her down.
: btw I might have have used a slightly darker hex to make absolutely sure that nothing you tell the aurors reaches the newspapers
: i mean fake moody kinda did try to kill me BUT I can acknowledge that I learned quite a lot in his lesson
: but thx to Lucius we KNOW that severus likes both of us and has done so for a long time. And he was receptive to our advances last year
Harry groaned and let himself fall backwards on the warm grass. Apparently he would have to find a way to walk around as many people as he could while trying to find the one person, who could see him.
: between him and Longbottom exploding cauldron’s all over the place, I kinda thought it’s a Gryffindor thing
SO the whole thing was basically a lucky accident and while Harry was somewhat responsible for Voldemort’s death he didn’t actually kill him (something which I believe he had neither the power or the mental ability to do at that point anyway). BTW as you surely noticed this means that Sirius and Remus are alive as well, and I promise, I didn’t forget them and they will appear at one point.
Dumbledore chuckled quietly at the obvious displeasure in the other man’s voice. At least some things would always be predictable for him.
Okay, enough of me, here's the chapter. If you need a reminder of the usernames pls look it up in the first few chapters bc I'm just lazy like that :)
“Thanks to Severus we know Voldemort thinks that Harry escaped. We need to believe the same and hope that we will find him as soon as possible. In the meantime, it is absolutely essential that nobody knows about Harry’s disappearance. Severus will tell Voldemort that Harry returned to us safely and that he is currently recovering at a safe house. Alastor –“, he looked at the former Auror, “I ask you and Kingsley to form a small group which observes and if possible prevents the Death Eater activity in the Ministry. Work silently as we can’t afford a direct confrontation right now.”
, we would like inform you that next month we will be doing a radio special on the topics of the education of muggleborns and their integration into our society.
The snake obviously hadn’t finished talking yet, but Harry was too overwhelmed by her words too care.
“It was indeed very powerful magic. I’m still unsure what could have caused it which is why I am glad you are accompanying me to the source of the power.”
how much this means to me. To see and hear that you reread this verse, that it makes you smile, means so much to me.
Harry contemplated shifting onto his back. It seemed like a huge task, too tiring to even consider. Most of the time he didn’t even open his eyes, because keeping them open would take to much energy. And if he closed his eyes he could pretend that it was all only a bad dream. He could dream himself away to Hogwarts, into the arms of his friends. He could dream himself on his loyal broom, flying upwards until his breath turned into ice and he could touch the clouds.
I'm sorry I can literally not promise anything regarding the next chapter. I'll try my best but yk...
Taking a deep breath, she let the letter fall down on the floor and grasped Draco’s hands in her own. “He wants us to return immediately. If I can’t convince you to join the Dark Lord’s side I am to leave you behind. If I don’t return until tomorrow night, he will use our Marriage Bond to force me to return to his side.”
In other news this fic is a disaster but I have never written a Golden Trio Dynamic which I liked more.
: I just… I don’t want to …. U know…. Steal snape from you. You know that, right? I mean he just adopted you and here I am wanting the same and I would totally undersdtand if you’d prefer to have snape to yourself so if you want me to u know back off that would be okay really I understand
Her partner’s face was expressionless, but he raised a single eyebrow, his wand still pointed at Remus. “Remus Lupin, isn’t it? Didn’t you teach at Hogwarts? No wonder that our children learn nothing at all when their teachers are stupid enough to trigger every single ward in the area.”
Narcissa looked at her son then, her eyes taking in the handsome young wizard sitting next to her. She wasn’t blind to Draco’s faults, not at all, but she believed that she could see his strengths better than anybody else. Behind the arrogance and sarcasm was a strong wizard, who was not always brave but would do everything to protect his family. And now she and Severus were the sole focus of all that protectiveness. She knew that her son would set the world on fire to protect her and in return she would destroy cities and countries to keep him safe. It probably made her a horrible person that she was willing to sacrifice everything and everyone for her son, but she didn’t care.
: those two girls won't sleep with him and he has bitched about it for 5 min now like they owe it to him or smth
: there’s no proven correlation between my admittedly three week long research blackout and my burning hatred for standardized testing
about the progressiveness of Britain and how we have such a young minister. I don’t think they’ve seen Fudge
: ok so I'm in front of the office but ur portrait is simply laughing at me instead of letting me in
: remember when all of our classes were cancelled in third year bc they managed to explode all of the cauldrons and like a quarter of the dungeons had to be rebuild
: also Harry will give his statement to the aurors as well so I guess he’ll need ur Emotional Support™ or whatever
: must be some kind of muggle currency bc they use it to show great worth?? Like flowers made out of gold or smth??
: various once. and individual interpretations. the most popular one is five books long, the next is in progress
I hereby confirm that the notes are accurate and complete, and that they can be given to the archive.
: harry im just waiting for the moment batdad truly realizes that he ended up with two sons and two husbands
: just stand up, stare him right in the eyes for a few seconds and then slowly give him the funeral nod
: you can tell Mr. Thomas that he has my permission to bring his pet turtle but only if I’m allowed to meet Mr. Bob
. Now, regarding the shipments of basilisk skin, Minister, I am quite willing to work with you on the re-drafting of paragraph 34, but surely you can see that –
: u trying to tell me u didn’t claim that poor boy in the middle of the great hall so everyone knows he’s off the market??
: so if we don’t want to look like shit on our first official day as boyfriends (!!!), maybe we should try to sleep?
: an older memer might have said smth like “it’s too early for nightblogging, the Australians are still asleep”
for criminal activities. That is true. However, there is the fact that most people on the Auror force and the hitwizard corps are former Gryffindors. A study – don’t look so surprised, I might have spent a lot of my school years being chased around by a madman, but I still
: first of all she memorized the textbook. And in the textbook it is explained very clearly how to cut something, or in which order to put the ingredients into the cauldron
In the beginning he had been so sure that somebody would soon arrive to safe him. He had waited for Dumbledore to suddenly appear in his cell, or for Ron and Hermione to tear down the walls of his prison. Then he had remembered that the summer had just begun. Everyone would simply think the Dursleys were keeping him busy with chores. It would take time for someone to realize that he had been kidnapped. And how would anybody find him?
“But Molly, if he was wounded we need to see him even more quickly. Harry hates to lie around, being helpless. It would be easier for him with us there.”
: if I maybe had the power to increase the Hogwarts budget, what do you believe needs the most additional funding?
Harry took a deep breath and started the search for his magic. The forest around him whispered, and the sun started to die at the end of another day. Animals and magical creatures alike started to join the whispers as they watched the young wizard who was neither really there amongst them, nor was he lost to the world behind the shadows just yet.
: do u just lie in the shadows of towers of books until one of us fucks up so u can come out and make fun of us???
, the poor boy was still out there, somewhere, probably all alone and hurt… It broke her heart. But everything was better than thinking about the possibility of Harry being dead.
: a dark lord tried to kill you since u were like a single year old and you didn't know about FES????
it, although his eyes were closed. It was a different kind of seeing than what he was used to… it was more like feeling the spark of power, sensing it. If he had to describe it, he would say that it was deep midnight blue and brilliant green. It was small enough to fit in his hand but it also spread through his whole body. Harry followed the spark through his right arm, watched it flow into every single finger. If he concentrated enough he could even feel his body tingle with the power surging through it. He had never been so aware of his magic. The only time he had felt that tingle of magic before had been in his third year, when he had cast the
I honestly do not know where the content of this chapter came from. I've never even watched the Bee Movie. All I know about it is from tumblr. I don't know if the woman qualifies as a furry. All I know about furries is also from tumblr. I try to avoid that part of tumblr though.
Draco tried to take a deep breath, but his throat was strung together with tears which he didn’t allow to fall. “You know I love you, mother. And my love for father died the day he told me to follow the Dark Lord’s order concerning you. My love for him turned into hate the day I learned how he had hurt you again and again.”
: Hagrid gave me my letter, but there was only the letter and the list of things I had to get and all that stuff
: Hiccups, I guess? Because while irritating, I think I could get used to it? But that falling feeling is literally horrifying and I don’t think I could like… even walk properly if I always felt like that
: and even IF it doesn’t work out between sirius, me and severus, you would still have all of us. We would still be on your side, no matter what. You are more important than our love life, Harry
: this casual display of favoritism is great and all but can we talk about the fact that Dean told us TWO (2) lies???
: About a month? Hagrid gave me my Hogwarts letter on my eleventh birthday, and he took me to Diagon Alley, so I learned a bit about magic then. I still wonder how my relatives managed to get back home – I’m pretty sure we stole the only boat on the island.
: but please give this a chance? Yes, it could go wrong, but I’m sure we would manage to still be friends. Even if we started dating, we would still be friends.
There’s a disturbing lack of memes in this chapter and a worrying amount of actual plot (how???), but it’s still one of my favorite chapters so far, so I hope you all will like it too. ^^ Also, I think it migth be the longest chap so far.
The snake on his chest leaned forward. Somehow her eyes expressed sympathy and Harry immediately felt less lonely. The young wizard was surprised by himself for a second – he hadn’t even been aware that he had been feeling lonely.
Draco Malfoy looked worn, but even with only his head being visible, it was clear that he was still holding his head high above everyone else. He looked surprised to see his Headmaster, but nodded respectfully.
: Well, I went back to my relatives, obviously. They were back home by that point. But my uncle locked away all my books and everything – so really, I started learning about magic at Hogwarts. The first lessons were a bit overwhelming, haha.
He didn’t feel cold or warm or… anything really. Everything that made him a thinking human being was focused on the small spark of pulsating power that he had managed to locate in his chest. It was nestled inside his body in about the same height as his heart, but on the right sight of his body. The snake, which was still winded around his eyes, had hissed excitedly in his ear when he had found the spark. Somehow he was able to actually
Draco stared at his mother in astonishment. What she had done… it was basically unheard of. Breaking a Bond like this, without the consent of the partner… it took a lot of magic to even perform the oath. But he couldn’t help but be incredibly proud to be the son of the strong witch in front of him. His smile turned into a wide grin as Narcissa Black raised her head and returned his smile with a new sense of freedom.
Also guys if you love Drarry (which seeing as you are reading this mess, I assume you do) and you love Queer Eye, read
: Theodore isn’t suddenly a helpless toddler simply because he now has a reliable, responsible father figure.
seamus u once climbed on top of the Gryff table, walked down to the end of it, and grabbed an apple from there to give it to dean, just bc he mentioned that those apples looked better than the ones close to us
The young Malfoy frowned, his mouth tightening in an unpleasant way. Nevertheless, he nodded shortly, turning away from the fire place to call for his godfather.
Nice try, but given the fact that I somehow continue to tolerate the presence of two Gryffindors in my bedroom, the fact that I have a Gryffindor son doesn’t faze me anymore.
: are we ignoring that Malfoy apparently thought Ron’s appearance was reason enough for me dating him
You can't believe how happy I am to share this chapter with you guys, because I LOVE THIS ONE. There is also one new character, but it is pretty much immediately said who she is. But if you want to know who will appear and what her username is, you can look it up in the notes at the end of the chapter.
I feel like the F.E.S. should be a thing. It makes so much sense, really. Like, if you were hurt really badly and can't apparate, how are you gonna get to St. Mungo's? Send an owl? Patronus messages are quite difficult as far as we know, and taking the Knight Bus would probably just kill you.
: Mr. Potter, I will be away on Sunday and while Theodore has assured me that he’ll be fine I would be grateful if you could keep an eye on him while I am out of the castle
Draco’s eyes filled with helpless anger as he listened to his mother’s words. “But that Bond is supposed to safe you when you were… kidnapped or in some other way forced to leave your partner’s side. It’s not supposed to be used to force you to go back to him when you left on your own will! How can he twist the Bond like that?”
: the muggles agreed to sign off Harry to me if we pay them the total of monthly payments they would have gotten until Harry’s eighteenth birthday
The universe may think it played me, but I changed the rules of the game and have become invincible.
She looked at a wizard in the far corner, dressed completely in black. Although he was part of the Order and on the same side in the war as they all were, he seemed to stand apart. Severus Snape returned her questioning look with cold eyes. “About one and a half months. This confirms the words of Calver and Korrham, the Death Eaters who were guarding Potter’s cell.”
I am delighted to inform you that there has been a vast improvement in your son’s behaviour. He has set his wand on fire only twice (2), has exploded only five (5) cauldrons, and has set fire only to one (1) giant bonfire (with permission of the Hogwarts staff).
: …. oh well, I am sure Minerva would agree that a pet turtle would be completely harmless and might bring some joy to the students
Working an adult job is the safest way to start hating people. like.... the pettiness in me is getting stronger and stronger because Adult is just a synonym for "Goddman Five Year Old In A Suit".
: To show that he’s dangerous, right? Well Remus Lupin is a werewolf, yes. But he also loves chocolate and chamomile tea.
: batdad: “umbitch’s stupid decree about female and male students staying away from each other is still active??”
Theo’s actual birthday is 2nd September 1979, but I like the idea of him being younger than Harry, and really, what about this fic is canon at this point except for Harry’s worrying lack of information about the wizarding world.
I am delighted to inform you that Ms. Granger continues to excel in her studies. Most notably, she has:
: even with father turning on the dark lord and all that, potter will never honestly think of me like that
: OKAY first off all why do you just assume //// I //// did something??? Something could have happened // to // me???
: I am sorry, Severus. I am so incredibly sorry. I am sorry for every insult and every prank, I am sorry for the loneliness and the desperation, for my part of the way you lost Lily. I am sorry for all the hatred. I am sorry for being a coward, and I am sorry for leaving Lily’s son in such a terrible place to grow up in.
“Harry had to endure horrible things because of Voldemort yet again. I am as shocked and angry as all of you are, but right now we need to focus on the only important task: we need to find Harry.”
: But I can’t change the past, I can’t change the fact that I wasn’t expelled for endangering another student’s life, when I should have. Aand therefore, I will concentrate on the present and the future. And I want to start with an apology. I said it before, but sometimes I didn’t mean it and sometimes, you didn’t believe me.
Sorry for the delay you people, I've had a super busy week (and it's gonna get worse, yay). But today is a public holiday in Germany, so I had time to format this whole thing and finally update :D
Her voice left no room to argue and so the three mumbled a short agreement before running up to their rooms again. They would probably all write letters, telling their friend how happy they were that he was safe, and how they wanted to see him no matter what everyone else said. Molly stared at the three untouched cups of chocolate and sighed again. Maybe, because of some miracle, those letters would find the Boy Who Lived, wherever he might be.
As usual, thank you for the quick completion of the protocol notes. Let’s hope the gents and ladies learn to talk less and listen more for the next one, but I’ve been hoping for that since I’ve started working for the ministry.
“Do you feel it, Severus?”, murmured Dumbledore, his face set in grave lines. “The magic is still in the air, still moving around us, though it’s getting weaker. Whoever released it was playing a very dangerous game. I wouldn’t be surprised if we found the person responsible for this at the edge of death.”
Sometimes Harry even dreamed about being with the Dursleys again. Everything was better than the cell he was currently lying in. At the Dursley’s he’d had a bed, a real bed. And he had been allowed to go outside where there was sunlight and people. He missed people so much. Sometimes he wished some of the Death Eaters who had kidnapped him right from that fucking stupid supermarket would come back. Harry would gladly let them torture him, as long as they would talk to him. He had never been happy around many people, because it usually ended with some kind of ambush upon him. But during his childhood at the Dursley’s, he had hated being alone. Alone meant a small, dark cupboard. Alone meant nobody to talk to him for hours or days.
Prof. McGonagall was correct when she said that this will help strengthen house unity, or at least it could, so everyone please give this a chance :) :)
Alarmed, Draco reached for his wand. “What did he write, mother?” the young man asked, forcing his voice to be steady.
I have read ALL of your comments and I almost cried like you guys love my shitty baby fic so much and I ????? can't handle that but THANK YOU. The amount of kudos and hits and comments is ridiculous but I love all of you. Like you could just comment "one (1) like" and I'd probably tell my grand-kids about it.
Dumbledore nodded. “Yes, thank you Mr. Malfoy. Please call him quickly, even if he is in the middle of brewing a particularly fascinating potion.”
- some more awesome percy (how did this character happen???? *looks at own hands* how are u this way?
Harry: Also, this isn’t only about muggleborns who are Slytherins and are suddenly confronted with the fact that they have two social disadvantages – being muggleborn and being a Slytherin – without having any idea why that’s the way it is. The magical world was a dream come true for me, and it probably is exactly that for many other muggleborns, so it’s quite a slap in the face to realize that you never even get the chance to be on the same level as your peers.
: the ones every muggleborn students or those growing up with muggles receive with their Hogwarts letter
Harry had never thought about how magic looked like. Sure, different spells had different colors, and you could see what magic could
“I wanted to check on you, but you weren’t in your bed. Why can’t you sleep, little dragon?” his mother asked, her worry obvious in her voice.
10 days until my exams and I'm doing literally anything other than studying. I started watching "Suits" a few days ago. I actually cleaned my room. I never clean my room. This is horrible.
: also Sirius and I would like to get to know you better. Harry has already adopted you as a little brother / kind-of-son, so we would like to officially invite you into our family as well. Maybe we could meet you and Harry in Hogsmeade?
: ok. I was texting Harry. And we were doing this 20 questions thing, right? And he might have asked me to go on a date him.
Harry Potter”, he said slowly, staring at it as if he wanted to force the spell to work with the glare of his eyes alone. The wand started to spin on his hand, trying to find its goal. But like all the times before, it simply stopped with the tip glowing red, showing that the spell didn’t succeed. Remus almost threw his wand down on the ground as frustration took over his mind for a second. He wanted to find Harry, would do everything to be at his side. But he simply didn’t know what more he could do. Magic couldn’t find the boy, his wolf was running in circles, and nobody had seen him since the beginning of summer. Well, except for those two Death Eaters that had caught him, but they were dead, killed by their Lord.
You better believe Severus is smiling SOFTLY at his phone as he writes those words, and somewhere else Harry is almost crying because fuck, no one ever dad-joked him, and he didn’t believe he would ever get that.
She held out her arm and Draco quickly stepped forward to take her hand. They walked towards the old but comfortable couch and set down, holding each other close. Like so many times before Draco felt a painful stab of guilt as he thought of everything his mother had given up for him. She had told him that it wasn’t his fault and that she would gladly follow him everywhere he had to go, but it was still difficult for him to see his mother like this.
: he has also grown???? Not, like, much, but he originally fit into one hand, and now I need two to hold him
Narcissa hold him closely for some more minutes before pulling out a letter from one of the pockets of her dressing gown. She glared at it for a second and Draco could once again understand why so many people feared his mother. It was not the same cold and calculated power like his father’s that was shining behind her eyes. It was the ruthless and hot fury of a mother that would do anything to protect her son. It was one of the reasons why Draco had never seen it as a sign of weakness that he felt safe in his mother’s arms.
Now, as for the sad news. My people, my folks, the next update will sadly be only in two weeks, so Wed. 4th of July (wait isn't that Murica Day. You know, the bday of Captn America?). I'm really sorry about that, but I've been drowing in work and I haven't been able to write up new chapters, so I have to give myself some time to stock up again.
, he asked. Now that he was thinking more clearly, the idea of being dead was terrifying. He didn’t want to be the only one able to safe the world from Voldemort, but nevertheless, it was his duty to do so. How would he fight Voldemort when he was already dead? He had never seen the Hogwarts ghosts fight, although he had to admit that Peeves could be quite destructive.
: Maybe? My mail, I mean both letters and emails, are looked through by my dads first. So maybe I get requests, but this is the first time someone wanted to talk to me about something else than myself, so I guess that’s why it was forwarded to me.
And so it went on. Harry’s real eyes were still closed while his inner eyes showed him the blue storm he was standing inside of.  It felt so good to let all that anger roam freely. Harry cried and laughed and the forest around him shook as his magic lashed out into the sky.
: You were the victim of my fear and my cowardice, and none of all the things I just told you makes that okay. It’s an explanation, but it’s not an excuse. What I did to you was wrong and if I could go back, I would change it in a heartbeat.
: I shall sign all my letters to fudge with “Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts and flaming gay chicken”
: batdad can get u a meeting with the same lawyer who managed my adoption and prepares the case against Nott-my-father-anymore, I guess
: Too afraid to ask the cute girl on a date? Stay positive, just yeet amorentia at her and hope it smells like u
it would slowly drain my will to be a teacher, so let’s make it a Sherry Thursday, what do you say, old friend?
: well you know he opens his mouth and swallows and then a few hours later he uses my bed as a loo which is honestly so rude
LISTEN UP Y’ALL if you give me a fucking miniature dragon which moves and breathes fire and shit you better believe im gonna adopt it. That’s my tiny dragon son now. Mine. I love him and he can do no wrong.
: at one point – we had already drunken quite a lot – severus called the woman in the movie a “damn furry”
: my mum lives for self-pity and drama, so she probably enjoyed the morning just as much as your mum
“I agree with you Albus, but… can we be sure that the boy is still alive? I like Potter and I would gladly turn over every damn stone to find him, but You-Know-Who is getting stronger every day. I’ve heard from several of my contacts at the Auror department that the Ministry isn’t clean anymore. We need to be prepared to fight back.”
I can’t describe how much I love your comments and how happy every single kudo makes me, so thank you so much!! Also if you want to cry about HP, BNHA, BTS or the current state of the economy u can always message me on
I love you all, you fill my heart with warmth and light with all your nice comments and kudos and aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh thank youuuuu!!!!! If you are like me and never know what to comment, sent me a quick "Drarry - dumb boyfriends since 1995" and I'll know that you liked it :D
Suddenly the male Death Eater disapperated, only to reappear directly behind Remus. Only because of the werewolf’s fast reflexes was he able to jump to the side and escape the curse flying at him from behind. Remus cursed, Bellatrix laughed and Rodolphus kept silent. But the wolf inside of the first man’s chest howled angrily and charged into the front of his human’s brain again. Together they guided their shared body, moving it almost too fast for a human eye to see. Remus grabbed his wand tighter, quietly raising a Shield Charm around himself. The wolf sharpened their eyes and ears, always aware of their enemies’ position. The werewolf was now standing at the edge of the small clearing, his back towards the trees. All three humans seemed to take a deep breath and then the fight started again.
Dumbledore looked up from where he was writing a letter when he heard Fawkes vanish in a high flame. He frowned lightly. The phoenix normally stayed by his side except for when he asked him to deliver an urgent message. This was the first time he could remember his familiar to simply disappear without even a short warning. The old wizard looked back at the letter and suppressed a sigh. The new school year was about to begin, and still there was no sign of Harry Potter to be found. The Order members had searched everywhere, and they where still searching, but it was difficult to keep believing. Although Dumbledore hated the thought, he had to start making plans for the eventuality that the foreseen savior of the wizarding world was dead.
He was about to pick up his quill again when some of the golden instruments in the shelf beside him suddenly started to vibrate. They were emitting a soft humming sound which rose up until the old wizard’s ears were ringing because of the noise. With a swift motion of his wand he silenced the instruments. Before he could try to find out what had caused them to react that way, he could feel it himself. There was a sudden chill in the air, and it seemed to call to him. Dumbledore felt a mixture of curiosity and fear rising inside of him. This was powerful magic, and it was being released uncontrolled into the world. It was very dangerous and from the feeling of it, it happened very closely to where he was. The thought of something dangerous happening close to Hogwarts set him on edge, even without the students being at the school.
: so even if grimmauld place blows up after five minutes bc malfoys and weasleys are forced to exist in the same space
: Parvati and I are visiting her parents and the rest of her family, and I have been called her “friend” only about 34 times till now.
For this special, we would like to offer you a slot in the show where you would (in form of a very casual interview) talk about your experience as a halfblood growing up without any knowledge of the magical world.
something and Harry wholeheartedly agreed. He wanted to move, to leave this forest and get to his friends as quickly as possible. He frowned slightly. Was his broom still at the Dursley’s? If yes, would he be able to summon it from here? He would have to find a way to make it work without his wand though… On the other hand – where exactly was
As usual, you can find all necessary information and notes for your meetings in a folder on your desk.
I'm sorry I'm so useless, my people. I'll get to it, I swear!!!! I'm currently on a work trip, but I'll go back home tomorrow by train, so I'll have time to answer your comments then! This isn't proofread at all (honestly, what do you expect at this point?? Time managment? Me? Don't make me laugh.)
: So any time in the first weeks at Hogwarts I could have accidently looked at the Slytherin’s emblem a bit too closely, and there was a chance of me starting to speak Parseltongue. And I would have had no idea why everyone would freak out. I also had no idea why Slytherins were basically shunned by the other students.
: never in their whole existence have british people been known to express their feelings in an “enthusiastic” way
ALSO!!! I realized I left out Millie in the last chapter??? So she’ll have a moment to shine in this one ^^
: also that sensitivity and emotional intelligence training mione forced us to do was actually helpful
: listen draco u could whine about the fact that ur parents are literally goals or u can stop being a little bitch
: I love you and the way you make absolutely certain that all our expenses are covered by 50% of my and 50% of your vault
P.S.: Regarding Harry’s powers – I’m trying, Minerva, I really am. Yesterday he apparated through the anti-apparation wards at Grimmauld Place (you know, the ones
: it’s a friend of my brother and hes super boring and has been talking about his carpet collection for an hour now
Your son is a menace, I don’t remember why I like him half of the time. He’ll succeed in everything he wants to succeed in, and the only reason he has the second best grades out of his whole year is because Ms. Granger is an outlier and shouldn’t be counted.
Hermione sighed and turned towards her boyfriend. “It’s okay, Ron. We will simply have to make a stop at a Muggle bank to get the money. It’s probably quicker than changing Galleons into pound anyway.”
Molly turned around to face Dumbledore again. “One and a half months! And you heard Severus – under which conditions they held him in that horrible prison. No food, no water, no light…”. She started crying again, with her husband rubbing her back helplessly.
The sudden bang of the front door being thrown shut and the portrait of Walburga Black coming alive as violently as always made them all sit up straighter. Anxious eyes stared at the door which connected the meeting room to the narrow hallway. The door flew open and a very angry looking Remus Lupin walked into the room. Some of the Order members had to control themselves not to grab their wands at the sight of the furious werewolf. Lupin stopped in front of the table, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore across the room.
, he answered calmly. He didn’t want to wake up yet. He hadn’t even been aware that he was sleeping, but waking up sounded exhausting. Wait, did that mean he was currently dreaming? Could one dream if he was dead?
I hope you enjoyed this, post a comment with your favourite shitpost or meme and maybe these children will have to suffer through them in future chapters.
there are over seventy students in slytherin, how am I supposed to find enough motivation in my dark, cold soul to write a feedback about all of them???
Harry couldn’t help but laugh a little, although he only did it in his mind. Trust his magic? When had he ever truly trust anything? He had been let down too often, had seen friends turn into enemies only for them to come back and lie into his face about always believing in him. Sure, he trusted his few close friends, but he still couldn’t tell them everything. He trusted Dumbledore but still couldn’t help resenting him every time the summer began. He had trusted Sirius but he had never been blind to the flaws of his godfather. And himself? He had never trusted himself. Too many times his accidental magic had betrayed him at the Dursley’s, leaving him alone in his cupboard, without any food or contact to other people. Too many times he had acted impulsively, and with doing so he had made everything so much worse. So with all that, how could he trust his magic?
Thank you for all your comments, I love reading them so much! Once again, if you liked this chapter and want to see more,
: but he lacked the necessary basic knowledge of potion making to make sure that those changes do not alter the potion itself
: he stayed up til three am with Remus and they talked about some of the most BORING stuff and then dad went to get them but they dragged him into the conversation but then Sirius got lonely and wanted to join them but he woke me up and forced me to join too because they were talking about BORING stuff
The young wizard stared up into the dark sky and tried to stop thinking. For the first time in many years he had been able to rest this summer. But now it was all coming back to him, with his last school year about to start. His thoughts were clashing in his mind, making it unable to find even a minute of sleep. Drinking a potion would be admitting his weakness to himself and he had long ago decided to stop being weak.
“Severus, my boy, thank you for answering my call so quickly. I wanted to ask you to accompany me to the forest. Surely you have felt the magical outburst a few minutes ago?”
Last chapter it was made clear that Harry would do a live radio show thing. This is this live radio thing. And it... it... escalated a bit. I don't know what happened. I love it, though. It's one of my favourite chapters. I hope you'll like it too.
The three children – they were still children in her eyes and it would probably never change – in front of her were still protesting. From somewhere inside her the witch took the strength to shake her head again.
Hi this is the ghost of Sky, she can’t post this in person cause her workplace had a fire drill exercise which means ‘nuhuh not taking the elevators pls’  and her team is on the 29th FUCKING FLOOR so yes.
Fact 2: Uploading this chapter was delayed by 30 min because I couldn’t find a song to listen to while proof-reading this mess.
: 3. Do not make any promises. Any at all. You can’t save the slowly diminishing population of Northern Pixies, nor do you want to become the youngest headmaster of Hogwarts ever
It is very important that he calls me, Mr. Weasley. We need to decide on the new colour for the kitchen by noon tomorrow, the design witch from Magical Makeover cannot make it on any other day.
: I mean u can’t even say that one of them is the best and call that a fact because its just your personal opinion
Harry tugged at his hair, leaving it in even more of a mess than its normal state. Just like his life. Why did stuff like this always happen to him?
The young wizard stood up and walked over to the tree Fawkes was sitting in. The phoenix stopped singing and tilted his head slightly, as if he was trying to listen to something. Harry called out the familiar’s name again, but the phoenix was still ignoring him. He was about to shout at the fire bird, something that he probably would have regretted immediately, but an amused hiss stopped him.
Okay, nerd rant over, I hope you liked the update (and the fact that there was one in the first place). Get excited for tomorrow, the next chapter is called “Family Affairs” and it’s another favorite of mine! :D Thank you for all the kudos and comments, I read them all and I love you guys!!!
: ok so would u rather forever have a hiccup or constantly experience that feeling when u lean back with your chair and you almost go too far and for a second u feel as if gravity doesn’t exist and you are falling right through the ground
“No.”, interrupted the werewolf the older wizard. “My first priority is to find Harry and to protect him. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing he’s out there all alone while I’m not doing everything I can to help him.” His voice was cold and didn’t leave any room for discussions. Dumbledore seemed to recognize this as well, and he nodded slowly.
: Remus Lupin. He’s great. Best DADA teacher we ever had. Well, to be honest, Moody was also great, but then there’s the fact that he was actually a Death Eater pretending to be Moody, so …
: you getting adopted by Severus makes perfect sense and we are happy with it. He’s proven to be able to protect you even in times when doing so openly would have gotten him killed instantly. And he has worked so hard on getting you away from the dursleys.
curse. The short expression of frustration in the Death Eater’s face was enough time for Remus to shoot a
Even the minister needs time to eat. It’s all Fudge does these days. Why don’t you ask your young man, hm? I’m sure he’ll be happy to eat lunch with you.
. Remus had to use all of his power to hold up his Shield, while his wolf guided them a few steps to the right to dodge the male Death Eater’s
One and a half month after capturing Potter, two figures in black cloaks conjured a door into one wall of the prison, which held the young boy. They had been ordered to bring the wizard to the main hall, for their Lord to see and for him to kill.
: both were banned by the ministry bc they are classified as dark soo…. We are trying to catch up but we are way behind
: how do you even get Flitwick to this point tho. Goblin man is one of the most wholesome teachers at this school
: and I was just like well fuck I guess my problems are not as dramatic as they first appeared to be
The blond man turned around and this time his smile was warm and honest. Quickly he stepped inside the small house again, closing the door and leaving the night sky behind him.
The white-haired wizard kept silent for a few moments while they were still walking quickly through the forest. “It wasn’t only the pure strength of the magic which surprised me, Severus. It was the emotion behind it.” He glanced at his friend. “It was very angry magic. With so much anger bottled up inside a person… I am afraid that we might have another powerful Dark wizard at our hands.”
: 1 or MAYBE I realized that the number of phone contacts only symbolize artificial affection but no honest companionship and so I deleted all of them except for a few??????
: I don’t think you would let me say this if we talked face to face, so I’m writing to you instead, and please, just read it. You don’t even have to say anything, but please, read it.
The wizard was desperately trying to think of another way to search for Harry when the wolf inside of him suddenly growled in alarm. Remus raised his wand, his eyes quickly scanning the area for threats. One moment he was alone and the next he was suddenly face to face with a woman and a man, both dressed completely in black. The werewolf cursed silently as he pointed his own wand towards the woman who was grinning madly at him. He wasn’t sure who the other Death Eater was, but he knew that Bellatrix Lestrange was completely crazy and very dangerous.
“Obviously it wasn’t safe at all!”, interrupted him the anxious voice of Molly Weasley. She had tears in her eyes, but her mouth was set in an angry line. “If those horrible people haven’t seen him since the beginning of summer, then Harry was in the hands of You-Know-Who for…”
I just booked my flight for my internship abroad and now I need to rent a flat and all in all I need to make way too many Important Decisions for someone who still needs a pep talk when calling their dentist. So the next update might take a bit longer buuuuuttttttt (hehe butt) it will be up on Friday at latest.
: Do you want to come over and get mad over reruns of Big Brother so you’ll rant over your feelings and at least ADMIT to liking them?
: but then //I// panicked and I said that u know I WANT to date him but what if I fuck it up so maybe we should just u know be friends
: let’s just eat lunch with your dads and theo, and I invite my parents and you invite the weasleys!!
AND I want to make sure that u know this isn’t some kind of OP!Harry story (which I’m not bashing at all bc sometimes u need those fics where people realize that Harry is actually fucking amazing like fight me right now). Just. It’s established in canon that he accomplishes things which are simply Not Normal for your average teen wizard (the patronus thing is just one example, remember how impressed the tester at the OWLs was after Harry showed him Prongs? That was in an exam setting, with no Dementors there and TWO YEARS after Harry had learned the spell. And yes, the other DA members learned the spell as well, but again, they were (mostly) fifth years and it was a classroom exercise. Harry managed the spell at a really young age while being emotionally distressed and in the presence of like a thousand dementors even though he reacts extremely bad to their presence.) I truly think Harry could be one of the most powerful wizards of Britain – he simply doesn’t really feel the need to push himself more than he has to. That’s why I don’t think Slytherin!Harry fics with Harry being much more powerful than in canon are extremely implausible – a Harry in Slytherin is ambitious and would push himself more, and the skills and the magical power were there all along.
: cause I feel like she would be the kind to just like leave me alone as long as I’m not doing smth really stupid
: Albus, please tell me you did NOT santion a gigantic bonfire to celebrate the students’ return from the winter holidays
I need to sleep now, tomorrow we have a quite big event at work and I'm like... organizing the whole thing so... yay.
: and in tonights episode of “harry potter has no respect for anyone” we can observe our protagonist running from hooch after being caught trying to juggle bludgers
: I recognize that y’all love spilling tea more than drinking it, but can we please refocus on the radio show?
: but u are smart too so you can drop those compliments at the end of a nerdy discussion. He wont actually accept them or whatever, but he’ll secretly like it
: I fixated on you so much, bullied you so much, because you were a mirror of everything I tried to escape during my time at Hogwarts. You were the me at home, the me getting scolded by my parents, the me who was so terrified. And I hated that part of me, and because I was too much of a coward to actually do something about the mess I was, I instead targeted you.
The evening brought with it a heavy, drowsy heat. Even the animals appeared to be apprehensive to stay awake as the hot air built walls between the trees. For hours now there hadn’t been even the slightest breeze to bring relief.
NOWWWW i'm off listening to the new BTS album on repeat (my current favs are Fake Love and 134340) and crying over the new MV. Seee youuuu
: im just saying, I already did my time for murder right??? But I hadn’t murdered anyone, so, logically speaking, I am allowed to murder a few people now and get off free
: in first year she set snape on fire, in second she ordered us to steal expensive potion ingredients and brew an illegal potion in a girls bathroom, in third she illegally used a time turner and broke draco’s nose, in fourth year she imprisoned a witch in a jar for several weeks, in fifth year she co-founded an illegal defense club, deliberately put a teacher in great danger and left the school grounds to fight in a battle against a dark lord
I promise I read all your comments (shoutout to @Doctor_Moo bc I'm a Raven as well, and @bellaphone for commenting about 10 times and burying me in memes!). I will reply to them when I feel less like I am MELTING bc fuck it is way too hot to think right now.
– anyway, a study has estimated that about 40% of minor delicts and 20% of serious criminal acts committed by Gryffindors are covered up. These people either face no charges at all, or they have to pay a ridiculously low fee and walk free. I’m talking about crimes which Slytherins would be thrown into Azkaban for, you know? I feel like we don’t talk about that enough.
Please do consider testing your son for Elemental magic abilities. I do not think it is necessary to mention which element affinity I believe he has.
Dumbledore sighed and forced himself to be patient while waiting for Severus. The situation of the young Malfoy was something else that he hadn’t been able to predict. He had been so sure, even at the end of the boy’s fifth year, that he was completely under the control of his father. Instead he had watched the boy become more and more miserable and frightened during his sixth year, spending the holidays with Severus in Hogwarts instead of returning home. He sighed. Of course he was pleased that the boy had found the braveness to choose the right side in the war, but he wasn’t easily controlled. Dumbledore preferred to be able to control even the small things. But right now that wasn’t important, and he allowed himself to tap his food once, showing his growing impatience.
Did I spend the whole weekend not opening my essay draft file even ONCe and instead spend it writing and reading fanfic (and going to see Infinity War holy fuck)???
a Tomarry Chaptered Story, and I'm looking for a beta reader. If you are interested in that, contact me on my
Voldemort appeared much earlier during the battle in the ministry and he was there when Bellatrix almost killed Sirius. In the books it’s clearly stated that Bellatrix fired a RED spell at Sirius which could have been a stunner. That means Sirius wasn’t dead when he fell into the veil – he died because of the veil. In this story however, Harry saw what was about to happen and apparated to Sirius’ side to push him away from the veil. By doing this he accidentally fell inside the veil (“the void”). In my theory, the veil traps souls, not bodies. However, because of the horcrux, Harry has TWO souls – or at least one whole soul and a tiny part of Voldemort’s soul. If we say the veil is somehow related to dementors, we can assume that it prefers souls with a lot of negative emotions (sorrow, hatred, fear etc.). And while Harry’s soul is definitely marred, it has nothing on Voldemort’s. So the veil decided to keep Voldemort’s soul and let Harry go again (since it only needs one soul). However, by keeping the part of Voldemort’s soul, it somehow dragged the other parts of Voldemort’s soul into the veil as well (because it requires a whole soul). Therefore, all parts of Voldemort’s soul have been dragged inside the veil and he’s officially dead.
