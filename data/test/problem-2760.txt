“Good dog,” he whispers. “
Draco yanked Potter’s head further back. “Okay?”
At one point, he was sure they had. They must have. Like before Potter arrived — it had been quiet then, he's reasonably certain.
of me again, so they could hold me up to some sort of standard.”
Harry chuckles; if they had a lifetime together, he doubts that’d be possible. He drags the blankets back up, covering them both to the hip.
“Ron.” Harry gently set Hermione aside. He wondered if the house knew how to slip its inhabitants into different dimensions. “It’s— it’s his home, too.”
“Oh.” Draco sags, grimacing at the dampness of the pillow under his back. He starts to sit up, but Potter’s hand on his chest stops him. He looks down; his robes and shirt have been removed, leaving him in nothing but his trousers and shoes. “What—?”
“What?”
He just missed them, Remus explained, escorting Harry back to his room, the stairs creaking ominously beneath their feet.
“Longer,” Draco finally says. “After Hogwarts, but I’ve known… longer than you.”
“What about him?”
“I only meant—” Malfoy licked his lips. Changed tacks. “If you hurt me, you’ll be hurting your people.”
A wrinkle formed between Potter’s brows. He started washing under his arms, hand moving in brisk circles over the hair there. Draco averted his eyes; for some reason, that felt too intimate.
“But— what he said about your face,” Ron said. His hands fisted, a visceral reaction to the memory. “And that thing on his arm.”
and Harry had gone.
) — the air between them had seemed to hum with anticipation. It was easier that way, an extremely pleasant… fallback, of sorts. “I’m not sure what to do here,” he said. “I didn’t sleep very well. Are you waiting for me to apologise for yesterday?”
“I don’t,” he finally settled on saying, irritated when Potter’s shoulders stiffened. “But I do need your help, and I’m fairly certain you’re required to give it.”
“Just the other.”
And looked.
“No, here.” Malfoy tsked and raised his wand to Summon his Transfigurations textbook. “Look. Metalwork transfiguration is more complicated — Conjurative Substitution laws apply. You can stretch most metals to cover damaged bits, a bit like smelting, but there’s a limit to how thin it will go before the metal itself starts to disintegrate. Your book is probably referencing how to mend a small hole, not something eaten through in so many places.”
“Oh,” Draco says faintly. “Lucky you’re with me then, I suppose.”
My tongue felt thick, my mouth dry. The words were always there,
Harry releases Malfoy's hands and Malfoy surges forward with a sob of relief. He wraps his arms around Harry like clinging vines and shudders against him, head falling limply to Harry's shoulder. Harry struggles briefly with the urge to push him away, all of his defensive instincts going on high alert — it's so strange to be
“Just once.” Draco held out his hand, flat, wavering it from side to side. “It was a bit like how I’d imagine you’d feel getting sucked off by Weasley.” He dropped his hand, voice cooling. “That is, Granger’s Weasley.”
“Your dad is still alive.”
“What? Oh. Yes,” Draco said with a preoccupied air, not meeting either of their eyes. He crossed to a high, shelved box on the side wall that Harry’d never seen before. “Of course. Of course I do.”
“We’re what, now?” Draco said, still blinking.
, do you like?” Draco’s hands on his back were hot; his stomach jumped against Harry’s. Rounding his spine, Harry created space between their bodies and looked down at him. Shifted so he wasn’t between Draco’s legs anymore. Draco stared up, dazed, blinking. He lifted his head to get at Harry’s mouth, growled with Harry pulled to the side to lick around the shell of his ear.
what I told you,” Draco hissed, and Blaise rolled his eyes.
, up the length of his forearm and over his Mark,
Potter shook  his head. “But let’s go somewhere private,” he said, absently Summoning their brooms. He laced his fingers through Draco’s and tugged on his hand. “Where we can talk.”
“Eventually,” Draco says. He cocks his head. “But was that a real attempt? If so, it was pathetic.”
was out of line — and ran his pinky down Harry's crack. Back up.
? Harry’d already been miserable. “I didn’t even know you had allergies like this,” he said. “That’s something I ought to have known, isn’t it?”
“Yes you are.” Longbottom blinked and sent him a curious frown as Potter exited the loo, still flushed and sporting sex-mussed hair and half-undone robes that really hadn’t needed to be undone in the first place; that was Draco’s fault, because seeing Potter rumpled in his Auror robes — which he never was — for some reason got Draco so hot he could probably come just thinking about it if he tried. Brows furrowing, Longbottom waved at someone over Draco’s shoulder. “Harry said so. Didn’t he? Say that he and Draco are dating,” he clarified to whoever had wandered up, and Draco, with a sense of impending doom, held his breath. “Or did I get that wrong?”
Harry eased the door open a little wider and caught a glimpse of Draco lounging on the sofa — felt funnelled by it, sick, as if Apparating a great distance. Draco’s eyes were flat; a cold twist pulled his upper lip. He looked like he had before they’d...
“He loved you.”
Harry fell onto him, or was pulled, slotting perfect between Draco’s spread thighs with a strangled laugh. Still fighting him — pressing Draco’s wrists to the mattress, releasing them to unwind Draco’s leg from around his waist. “Wait,
“So can we work this out tomorrow? I’m so tired they need a new name for it.”
“On what, then, have you based it?”
In Draco’s room, he sat in his chair watching the drift of snow around the garden, while Draco rifled through one of his trunks. Draco came up behind him and slid a hand over the back of the chair, his knuckles brushing Harry’s shoulder. Harry didn’t move.
at himself, closing his eyes at the cool spray that bursts forth. The soap has gotten tacky on him, and he clears it of his torso as quickly as he can, then takes another few minutes to wet his hair and scrub the oil from it, the grime from his scalp, to wash under his arms and everywhere else that’s likely to smell.
“Three,” Draco mutters, finishing his water. Sullen probably isn’t a very good look on a man his age, but surely not
do — would help, too.”
“Fine.” Searching his face, Draco took a step back. “I’m going to bed. We can—” he waved a hand, even the graceful swoop of his fingers through the air enticing, “—another time.” He turned and made for the door, but stopped and looked at Harry before stepping out. “I meant it, though. I appreciate what you did. Thank you.”
“Lucius added the diamonds from the Malfoy vaults,” she says. “The bands are… older.”
“It’s Harry’s home,” Ron muttered.
Draco’s parents exchanged a look. Then Narcissa rose from the sofa and arched an expectant brow at her husband. Lucius tossed back the rest of his drink before moving to her side and offering his arm. They followed Kreacher, a straight-backed flow of steps out of the room, apparently unaware the entire world had shifted under everyone’s feet.
* * *
Harry’s throat tightened, and he looked away when Hermione’s breath caught, her eyes growing damp. His fault. Every bit of it.
“What does it matter?” Malfoy said.
“You learn to spot them,” Potter says as they continue on. “In windows, hiding behind things. Muggles, mostly, I think. Probably inside when the cities were overrun, smart enough not to start looting as soon as the panic for resources took hold. That’s when most people....” He hesitates, and when he speaks again, his words are halting. Gentle. “We’re not the only ones alive, Malfoy.”
Hermione rubs at her chest to dispel the new ache growing and clears her throat. She plucks at Anthony’s sleeve and steps from the alcove before the Unspeakables can even get to the exhausted gargoyles at the base of the stairs. Anthony’s presence behind her and Ron’s voice in her head —
set off as early as they can, immediately perhaps; common though mobiles are now, there’s the chance it could take them too long to find one. But Harry can't shrug off how disquieting it is that Draco so effortlessly comprehended the pattern of Harry’s thoughts, and how, for a moment, satisfying that felt.
“He did,” Draco said.
“Uh, don’t tell him that part yet,” he said. Then he got the hell out of there, before Draco ripped the door off by its hinges.
“Master Phineas was being having ones,” Kreacher said, frowning, “and it is Vanishing when he is getting married and moving from Grimmauld Place, like many things do. Sir—”
to see if he could do to it what Draco had done to
Andromeda made a thoughtful noise in the back of her throat. “Perhaps,” she said. “I was.”
“Yeah?”
“It took us longer to get here than I thought, so we might as well stop for the night, but…” Potter gestures ahead, a grin breaking over his face, and Draco squints in the direction he’s pointing. The treeline is dense, but beyond it, he catches a faint sparkle, like—
Harry doesn’t laugh again, but he does glance at Draco with a lopsided little smile that almost exactly matches the tilt of his glasses before he absentmindedly straightens them. “Malfoy.”
, drowning with
Regaining himself in Draco’s arms, Harry gestured. Such a demented thing to fall apart over — the tear of golden threading between their names. Particularly because the brand around their wrists wasn’t going anywhere; it was a divorce, not a nullification of their history together, and surely that had to matter for something. “I just… I came down for a drink, and… hadn’t expected...”
,” he gritted out, so Harry went at him harder, lightheaded with his own rising climax, tingling pleasure pulling his balls tight. Draco’s hair was soft against his temple, his cock pulsing against Harry’s palm, his body a bow stretched tight as he came, and Harry yanked his hips back and came too, unable to hold out any longer. The force of his climax tore a moan from his throat, Draco’s inner muscles milking him with a hard, clamping rhythm that made him see stars.
“I wanted to join you all in the hall with the others,” Harry said, “but—”
“I don’t,” Potter said, pulling away. His lips were red and gleamed with saliva. “But maybe we shouldn’t— We’re in—”
“She is.” He closes his eyes briefly and his smile widens, fond and warm, and the pit in Hermione’s stomach
Eventually, Kreacher ushered everyone into the dining room. The table began to lengthen after the first eight people entered, duplicate chairs popping into existence. Startled, Harry stopped in the entryway near Draco, who was watching the display with a blandly patient expression. Harry opened his mouth to comment on it, but stopped, overwhelmed by the clean scent of Draco’s aftershave. Woozy from his nearness.
They’ll make better time today, be able to pick up the pace a bit, Harry thinks. His instincts haven’t let him down yet, at least, and he feels fairly confident about their relative safety. They might even have a chance to stop and clean off some of the grime they’ve accumulated — the map shows a lake near where Harry hopes to break later in the day.
Sliding his arm up, Harry rested his head on his bicep and wrapped his fingers around one of the slats of the headboard. He clung to it in place of his disconnect. One hand falling to Harry’s hip, Malfoy breached him almost delicately, his breath a feathered tickle along Harry’s cheek, tiny rolls of his hips pushing him deeper. Like their first time, it felt better than Harry expected; good enough that it clawed at him, and even more for the way his breath shortened, the way his cock jerked with stimulation at the burn. A foreign fullness, evoking an intimacy worse than Malfoy’s fingers in him. Harry’s skin was hot, his nipples budding into tight points. He heard a sound —  his own voice, low and aroused. Pressing his lips together, he arched the small of his back and took more of Malfoy’s cock.
When the craving grew too heavy, Harry got up and paced until the unpleasant crackle of magic around him receded, then sat down again, breathing as though he’d run a marathon.
“I did enough. And I can do it again, you already said,” Potter said. “It’s okay.” He lifted his hips and somehow Draco’s fingers sank a little deeper. “I want to. I really, really want to,” he said. And then Draco was climbing higher on his knees without thinking, curling Potter toward him with one hand holding the Slytherin tie around his neck. He kissed Potter because he wanted it so badly that he had to, and if Potter wouldn’t admit to the ruse of the gift exchange, if there was even still the smallest chance Potter was fucking with him, the smallest chance that Draco would look the fool in the morning after Potter revealed his identity, he would have at least got to have had
"But—" Potter pauses, the spatula held aloft.
“Yes. Yes.” Draco kissed him, wet, messy kisses, pressing them to Harry’s mouth and cheek and chin, then peeled his body from Harry’s. Tugging, when Harry forgot to let go of his hips, and lurching forward when he remembered. Standing beside his bed, he turned to face Harry. He was dishevelled — his shirt slipped from his shoulder, his breeches undone, cock bobbing out from them — and flushed — every scrap of skin Harry could see gold from the fire, pink from everything else — and beautiful.
“It’s too much,” Draco says again. “It’s overwhelming, and can be draining, and I’m not— I don’t know. I— can’t, right now. Like that.” His voice goes abruptly clipped. “And we
. God. Harry blames him more than Hermione for this, even though he knows it’s not fair. But until tonight, it had been days since he’d felt anything more than adrenaline-laced terror, more than a determined sort of numbness. He hadn’t even felt much when Whitney, the last of Harry’s team, had been grabbed and turned into one of those things before Harry’s eyes. A jolt of
Malfoy shot him a withering look. Sitting up straighter, he said, “I worked, for a time, doing... that.”
“Right. Well, you could come with us. If you wanted.”
Draco hissed through gritted teeth, his fingers clenching over Harry’s shoulders. “
“The jumper came with matching ones. You?”
"I…" Draco swallowed several times. "You'll do what you want, nothing I say will change…"
“If it bothers you that much, I’d suggest you be ready when I show up at yours tomorrow,” Malfoy said, face hardening. “As for what you do today— I don’t know. Find out how the other half lives? Go for a ride on the London Eye? I don’t really care; I’ll be having to close up at random times to cater to our bargain over the next few weeks, the least you could do is try not to be an utter arsehole about today, when it was all your fault. Oh, but I forgot,” he added with a sneery expression that he must’ve known would rile Harry up, “you’re either responsible for everything or nothing.”
, marginally better. But still not a solution, because Draco wasn’t Ron, and if they were starting to be friends, it was a friendship Harry didn’t know how to negotiate, yet. He dropped to his knees at Draco’s feet, his connect with the floor a slice of sensation that made him think of those dark nights in the Forest of Dean — the crackle of dead leaves near their tent; a footstep, carefully taken, and far too close — and tried to see something of Draco’s expression under his hands, and couldn’t. His hands fell to the outside of Draco’s thighs to rub, and he waited, for it to be over.
And his hair looked… looked...
“Yeah,” Malfoy said, and jerked him close, and kissed him. They shed their robes fumblingly on the way to the flat rock, and Malfoy didn’t seem to mind a bit when they tumbled too-hard onto it. That night Harry traced the fingerprint bruises Malfoy had left on his skin and touched himself, lost in the aching memories of how he got them.
“Yeah, we’re going to have so many opportunities to bathe, I’m sure,” Potter scoffs, and then his face suddenly goes still. Watchful. “What is it?”
Understanding something before her, for once, wasn’t quite the thrill Harry had assumed it would be. “It only says we have to be fertile,” he said, the back of his skull throbbing. “Not… I don’t think that they thought any of the rest would apply to two wizards.”
“The one where you’re—” But to Harry’s relief and disappointment, Draco cuts himself off again. He inhales through his nose for a measure. “There’s a part of you that isn’t happy about being attracted to me.”
“Po— Harry,” Draco said, and Harry stopped, nearly out. So close to privacy, and the reprieve of sleep. He waited, the brass knob cold in his palm, and Draco said, “Violet-honey apples.”
“No, the sign-up forms will Vanish tomorrow,” Pansy said. “As soon as the final gifts are given.”
?” he asked. “What have I accused you of, or denied your right to do?”
“What?” Harry pushes up onto his elbow.
Harry exhales, then gets to work.
“It's an organisational system that serves us well,” Draco says thoughtfully. “But each subsection uses a different formula.”
” Draco barked. Harry blinked, cock throbbing, and took a dazed step back. He dragged his gaze up to Draco’s with the petty thought that at least he wasn’t the only one who was irritated and turned on.
Harry’s arm explodes with a hot flare of pain that travels from his elbow to his collarbone, localised in his shoulder, when he lets go of Malfoy, who immediately starts rubbing circulation back into his own wrists. Harry tries to rotate his shoulder, hissing under his breath when he can’t. “I—”
“I was going to suggest that very thing,” she says approvingly. Hermione’s shoulders come down a little, but immediately tense again when Minerva leans forward, green gaze somber.
, Harry James.”
Malfoy paused again, his eyes running over Harry’s face. He pushed his fingers through his hair with a loud exhale. “Well, how am I supposed to know that?” he asked, a bit of bite to his tone. “Grimmauld Place is over four-hundred years old at the foundation, isn’t it? I couldn’t possibly begin to guess what sort of magic has been festering within its walls.”
“So, then, should I—”
“You’re fucking kidding.”
Harry pumped him, trying to get Draco’s trousers down one-handed, and Draco seemed to regain his bearings. Loosening his hold on Harry’s ribs, he yanked down the waistband of his boxers and shimmied his own hips to aid Harry’s efforts as Harry’s pants puddled around his ankles. Then he wrenched Harry’s hand from his prick and twirled him, his kiss hard against Harry’s mouth, copper-flavoured, hungry. Harry kissed him back and tasted Draco’s low moan, Draco’s tongue licking between his lips.
“We haven’t
” Draco’s head twitched with a weak nod, then dropped to hang down, hair messy and glinting gold at the nape. His shoulders came in, his back creasing in the centre and blushing bright. “Y-yes. Yeah, I— sometimes I—” He inhaled his words, sounding dismantled, “Harry, please, you’re— I—”
“Draco said something about how it might have been conserving energy, when it started,” Harry said.
“I know.” Harry hesitated, choosing his words with care. “But— you always said my private life was my own. When the Wizengamot expressed their disapproval to you over my preferences.”
Pansy was gone in the morning when he woke up, but she left a note on the dented pillow next to his that said,
“Listen,” Malfoy said hoarsely after a beat. “It’s— It’s not a problem.”
“So we won’t,” Harry said, the heat of his exhale against Draco’s skin warming his own lips.
“Like a Malfoy?” Draco asked, smile cold, the precision of his features looking as if they’d been cut from stone. But over the clench of his jaw, there was the wispy, pink splotch of a fading hive, and Harry faltered.
“I would prefer to hear it,” Narcissa says.
what you like best? Tell me how well I’ve done?”
“Requi—” Potter spun on his chair, a stupid, incredulous expression on his face. His cheeks were splashed with red and his nostrils were flaring, and for a second Draco wavered over taking it back, but
He didn’t give any further prompting, merely sat holding himself exposed to Harry’s view, the gentle current of his breath hypnotic in the lift of his pale stomach, in its fall. Harry tried to match his breaths, to control the wild beat of his own heart. He slipped his thumbs to the insides of Draco’s covered thighs and they parted; he shuffled closer on his knees. He’d seen Draco’s cock before but never like this, so near, shiny at the slit, the slenderness of Draco’s fingers offsetting the size, the length. His foreskin looked thinner than Harry’s and had retracted to hug the ridge of his cockhead, swollen and almost red. A flood of saliva filled Harry’s mouth, an odd crackle of uncertainty pitting in his belly.
Clearing his throat, Draco sits up a little straighter. Harry’s gaze dips to his groin, where he can just make out the swell of Draco’s cock and its lean toward his hip through the thick material of his gown.
“Yes,” Harry said, in danger of swallowing his own tongue. He nodded, his cock drooling out another generous pearl of precome as Draco draped a thigh over his hip, an arm around his waist. “Let’s— yeah. Okay.”
Malfoy stares at him. The glass at his side is shaking.
Draco is dead weight, shockingly heavy for someone so slender, and the cabin seems like it’s so far off, but that must be — or at least could be — an illusion. As it’s really the only option he has, he trudges forward, one foot in front of the other. Every few metres, Draco slides into a more precarious position, and Harry has to pause to sling him up back into his shoulder, but he manages to slog his way through the drifts, more than ankle deep, until the cabin looms before him. Smoke curls dark from a chimney and its windows glow with the promise of heat. Harry’s mind goes blank, survival instincts driving him closer, closer. Up the stairs. Through the door. The wind slams it shut behind them, and Harry leans his free side against it, panting.
“Try me,” Harry said through his teeth, hoarse. Draco rolled Harry’s balls in his palm, tugged them hard,
“You already thought so,” Harry says. “So now it’s confirmed.”
Stupid cock, so desperate to turn into Paris' main attraction.
The lines of tension around Draco’s mouth soften and his narrow chin comes down. He exhales and lowers himself steadily over Harry’s cock, the grip of his sphincter flexing and loosening until he’s seated firmly over Harry’s hips.
He was wearing nothing but a towel. Again.
“I wanted to speak to you about that,” she says at length.
“Teddy,” Harry blurts, and Malfoy’s teeth click closed. Harry steadies himself with a deep, relieved breath, and nods. “It’s Teddy.”
“We’re not permitted to—” Malfoy sighs and cards his fingers through his hair. He dries his hand off on the leg of his joggers. “No, it wasn’t. Just… I thought it was a—” He shakes his head with a strange, half-frowned smirk. “What food did you bring?”
“Tomorrow,” Draco said, setting his wand aside. He crawled over Harry, hands hot on his face, eyes twilight-dark. Then Draco kissed him, and deeper, and again. Urgent, hard kisses, until Harry was gasping with appreciation, his lips tingling, the taste of Draco in his mouth. Draco murmured, “Tell me tomorrow,” and pushed him down.
“I am not,” Draco lied. She filched one of the madelines from the box he’d brought — it was his present for that day, an arrangement of delicacies from his favorite patisserie in Paris — and made way for the door anyway. Draco leaned out of the way as she opened it.
"Yes." Harry's cock jerked, Draco's fingers stroking the bottom curve of his bum. He forced a smile and clamped a hand over Draco’s elbow. "I just need to discuss something with my boyfriend,” he said, and dragged Draco away before anyone could protest.
“Yes, Rose?” Hermione closes her book, extraneous reading at this point as she’s got most of it memorised, and waves her daughter over. Rose, still in her nightgown, hesitates under the arch that separates their parlour from Hermione’s office, then pads up to her in slippered feet. “What is it, darling?”
“I restore things,” Malfoy said, abruptly terse. He pushed himself up with a small grunt and righted his shirt on his shoulders; it had slipped to the side as he’d squirmed on that grand bed of his. “I like to— I’m good at it. You couldn’t possibly have a problem with that.”
“You’re welcome,” he said. He eyed Weasley. “Do you need to go to Pomfrey?”
A weird riot of flutters rock through Harry’s stomach — similar to the one he felt after Teddy’s birthday party last month, walking out of Andromeda’s kitchen to see Malfoy fast asleep on the sofa with a snoring Teddy sprawled over his chest. His throat tightens, and he forces himself not to look away.
He wondered briefly what had Pansy so flustered, but Potter was down to his undershirt, so Draco put that out of his mind, too.
” he yelled, storming up to Malfoy, who took a step back, then planted his feet as if realising he was ceding ground. Good. Fine.
“I’ve never seen any of the Weasleys in them.”
“For what,” Draco said, belligerent. He jerked his hand away again, and this time Harry let him, drawing a deep breath. He opened his eyes. Blinked them until they were no longer swimming.
“I just couldn’t,” she said. “Even that hypothetical I gave you was almost too much, and I was mainly answering questions.”
Harry headed to the shelf, so tightly packed, Hermione probably needed a charm to pull one down without starting an avalanche of the whole row. “I broke the wards on Draco’s studio,” he said, scanning the spines. They were all organised by either number or symbol, no help at all. “He really wasn’t there, and it was obvious he’d left in a hurry. None of these make sense!”
“Harry.”
Oh. Draco collected his thoughts. He should say something about the holidays, get Potter’s head in the game. “I thought about you in Slytherin robes,” he said.
But he can tell Malfoy's lost weight too; his madness must come from somewhere. His face is exquisitely thin, his narrow chin gone as pointy as it was before his teenaged growth spurts. His eyes are bright, glassy and blank, and they look huge in his skull. His robes are covered with blood.
Potter coughed, sputtered a little, and pulled back against Draco’s hold on his neck. But he drew off slowly, tongue working a lazy
“Make your own fucking food,” Draco said, drawing what must have been his first breath in minutes when Potter took another step away. He checked Potter’s face, surprised to find him still smiling.
Draco blinked. A smile crept over his face.
Harry ground his teeth together, a flare of resentment leaping in his chest. He set his hands on his knees so the rising scald of his magic couldn’t escape. “There’s no need to be deliberately offensive.”
being, don’t expect others to automatically subscribe to the same societal structures as you hold yourself to,” Malfoy said. He held up small box. Shook it. “What is this? Jewelry?”
“Or what?”
As that had become something of a nightly mantra for Harry since she’d referred him to Malfoy’s door, Harry could relate.
When she can bring herself to speak again, she says, "Thank you," giving it the proper weight it deserves. "I know." She returns his smile. "And, whatever comes of it— congratulations on your research, Neville, really.” Impulsively, she lifts on her toes and presses a swift, pleased kiss to his cheek. That she knew exactly to what degree she ought to rise only occurs to her as she comes back down to her heels.
“Yes.” Still, the question slips out, voice cracking. “Did you see—?”
“Get used to it.”
Draco squints as the shaft of sunlight coming in through his window takes on a warmer hue, spreading like honey over the foot of his bed. The thing is, he’s always been drawn to order. He
“It doesn’t bother me,” Harry said. “Being here.” He struggled to explain it; Merlin, he’d been struggling for weeks to explain it to
didn’t. He wasn’t going to ask. Absolutely not. Potter wouldn’t welcome the question anyway; he’d gone from formally cordial to decidedly chilly to downright cold in the last few weeks.
They got into an argument, ten minutes before Bill was due to arrive.
“Well, yeah, but Bill’s a
The look Harry levels at him is at once chastened and entertained. “Inferi aren’t going to be critiquing your form. But I— I suppose I—”  He hesitates, ruffles his hair with his fingers, and then, as though he doesn’t see Draco’s glower, sets Draco’s wand on the desk and gestures. “Move to the centre?”
Draco cracks one eye open. He smiles, tired and wry, and pauses for the length of a kiss — one that Harry takes.
After Pansy left and the buzz in his ears faded, he stared at the scroll some more. Looking it over was akin to being doused in boiling tar, but he couldn’t stop himself. The worst thing was that he couldn’t find fault with any of the items. He always had been overly-concerned with the disastrous state of Potter’s hair, after all; sinking his fingers into it was a singular pleasure he’d quite enjoyed over the last few days. And he’d been unable to stop thinking about seeing Potter in that towel, much to his infuriated embarrassment. All of it was… true.
“I don’t hear anyone talking,” he said. “I’m going to go.”
“Than this?” Draco asks, with another flex and a rather criminal smirk.
“That is our great Uncle Orion’s urn,” Draco was explaining when Harry could bring himself to look over. “He was ultimately interred in the family tomb, but it is indeed filled with ash, and I suppose that no one in our family has ever wanted to ask where it— Ah. That is a pendulum orchid, it only blooms when it’s exposed to very hot or very cold weather, but as you can see is lovely even when— Yes. Um, that is a linen serviette, I don’t know where we got it, but— My hair? Yes, I do know it’s uncommonly fair, but it’s not especially difficult to take care of…”
“Thank fuck,” Malfoy mumbles. They stop and he shrugs off his bag and removes the jacket, shoving the sleeves of the cream top he’s wearing up to his elbows. Harry looks ahead as they start walking again so he won’t be tempted to stare; the clothes suit Malfoy’s long, lanky frame almost too well. Harry never would have guessed. Malfoy fans himself and sighs, and Harry makes a mental note to look for sunblock.
“Something I want to try,” Malfoy said. He was stroking himself with one languid hand when Harry glanced down, and halfway to hard again. Harry’s body stirred at the sight, flushing warm. He put his legs together, eager not to think about it anymore, and suddenly desperate for whatever Malfoy had in mind — up to and including the things he alternated between fantasising over and worrying about in bed every night. Malfoy hummed approvingly and murmured a charm to slicken his hand, then smoothed his palm down over his belly, and lower too, glistening skin left in its wake. He rolled atop Harry, and guided himself between the press of Harry’s thighs, pushing between them, flattening against Harry, and “
“I’d never,” Harry says. “No, you’re right.”
amusing, but Malfoy had lost the plot and couldn’t draw a breath, was red-cheeked and watery-eyed, his shoulders shaking with each guffaw, and that
“I’m not going to bother Kreacher with this,” Harry said, directing a frown at Malfoy when he opened his mouth to object. “I’m a fair hand at taking care of myself. Or so I’ve been told.”
“No you wouldn’t,” Draco says. “You wouldn’t be able to tolerate it.”
Draco snorted, his dimple flickering in a lopsided grin, and Harry bit the tip of his pinky toe in retribution. Sucked it once more into his mouth.
“Fine, then. So— What now?” Harry asked, turning. He took a step back, jarred to realise Malfoy had come so close and he’d not sensed it.
his voice said, underneath.
By the time he got to the lobby, they were everywhere. Inferius, only a sort Draco had never seen before. They moved the same but faster, made the same sounds but louder, some ravaged by death and some so untouched they could pass for alive, and he watched, stunned, as two of them grabbed Lisel, a witch from his team. She had an astonishing amount of power for a Muggle-born — so much that he’d had to train her to pull back on her spells when she joined their floor — but she fell under them with barely a whimper. Her fingertips flared orange-gold with fire for a mere second before her magic was siphoned off by the Inferi touching her. It was graphic, appallingly so, her young face aging in a matter of seconds, blood gushing from her ears and expelling like vomit from her mouth. The Inferi left her for dead before she was, and she turned a look of such helpless misery at Draco that he felt a coward for not aiming an Avada Kedavra at her.
Draco is adept at masking his thoughts, but he’s
“Then you
“The House-Elves,” Draco finished. A small smile touched his lips. “Yes, I know. I apologise.”
He’s so cold, he’s almost… warm.
“Harry—”
please, Harry—”
“No more socks?”
ed under her breath and elbowed Blaise, who grunted. Draco continued impatiently. “I’m not even going to fill mine out, let alone turn it in. The whole thing reads like a psychological study. Or a way to let the professors know what areas we may need help in. I don’t need a lot of help. Or any, really. I’m—”
Harry rubbed at his face, a scorch of heat against his palm. “That’s not— That wasn’t what I was saying. I was just letting you know. In the interest of… being cordial. I don’t,” he took a breath, “think we should wait. In case.”
Potter hunches between them, and Draco’s mind goes blank as the slick heat of Potter’s mouth envelops him, surrounding him with a hard, sucking pressure that makes Draco’s balls tingle and eyes water. Potter bobs his head, saliva sliding cool down Draco’s shaft each time Potter draws back to lick hot over the crown, and the resultant contrasting sensations have Draco quivering. He grips Potter’s hair unthinkingly and forces his head down. Potter coughs, chokes for a moment, but makes a needy, aroused sound and opens his mouth wider, unresisting as Draco starts to fuck deeper into his constricting throat with fast, urgent thrusts. Potter’s hair is soft and curls around Draco’s fingers; the tiny sounds he makes vibrate around Draco’s cock, and the muscles in Draco’s legs go taut as his orgasm approaches. Then Potter reaches up and tugs at Draco’s balls, squirming a finger between Draco’s arse cheeks to rub over his hole, and Draco breaks, hips flying up. He comes so hard there’s a flare of pain behind his eyes that beats in time with the rhythm of his cock throbbing out his climax. Potter swallows again and again with a grateful little moan that shivers another twist of pleasure from Draco before it's finished.
him!” he wailed into them, throwing himself back against the sofa.
But there's a chance that something useful could have been left behind, too.
“What? What is it?” He slid off the bed and approached the desk, wand raised in case someone had set another boggart in one of the drawers, though no one had done that since the first week of term. They were probably afraid to now, after Potter had stormed out in a rage. He hadn’t done anything, really, other than pin up a signed letter saying he wanted a quiet year. But it couldn't have been fun to have incited a public notice — though, honestly, whomever had set the boggart in the drawer should have known better. Even Draco had been appalled by the amount of dead bodies the boggart had managed to change into before Potter’d spelled it away. Draco just felt fortunate that Potter had seen it first.
he thought.
Harry’s narrowed gaze searches his before slipping down to pause on Draco’s mouth for a fraction of a beat. Then he closes his eyes, his jaw knotting under Draco’s fingertips. He pulls away and curses softly. Looks to their clothes. “I don’t think I can dry them fully tonight without expending too much magic. If the storm keeps up, I’ll try to find something, find a way to cover you.”
“Don’t,” Draco said unevenly. “Just—” He gripped Harry’s wrists, led both his hands to the fall of his breeches. “Harry.”
Hermione glances at the clock, then at Rose, holding in a sigh. She’s been up for nearly twenty-four hours, attending to all of the loose threads that might jam the necessary flow of magic: scheduling the elves, allotting reserved food to be delivered to the dormitories and professors’ quarters, distributing orders for everyone to stay sequestered so as to not interfere with the spell, mapping out the route the call will take. That last had taken the longest and had been the most dangerous, a constant weave of movement outside the walls of the castle, the hungry eyes of the Inferi on her from behind the wards, their bodies tensing each time she allowed a slow, controlled seep of magic from her wand. She’s tired and too awake, impatient for and simultaneously dreading the minutes when Harry is supposed to call — because what if he doesn’t? Then it will all have been for nothing. The guilt that floods her at Rose’s voice is an unwelcome addition, and Hermione has to work at not snapping at her for interrupting.
Sometimes Malfoy would stay in his room for the majority of a day, for two, only coming down to dinner. Then, Harry thought he could tell — that Harry’s conflict wasn’t appeased by the things they were doing, and had done. Other times, it seemed like he didn’t care; Malfoy sought him out, slipping two fingers in the belt loops of Harry’s jeans and drawing him closer in the hallway when Harry was on his way to his room, snagging a handful of Harry’s t-shirt after dinner and bending him back over the table.
“Because it matters?” Harry asked. “It wasn’t a wish to land here with you. I didn’t want this. And yes, some of that was about you, and how we were, and the things you did, but a lot of it wasn’t, and—”
“Turquoise,” Harry manages to say, kind of, so quiet Malfoy leans in, “blond, red and brown and black.”
“All right,” he says. “We have some time. Tell me what you've been thinking.”
“Go on,” Potter said, resuming his stroke over Draco’s shaft. “It’s only fair, right?”
But then, still talking, Draco began stroking tiny circles over the small of Harry’s back.
She’s twenty-eight; she wasn’t meant to be a widow for at least hundred more years, if even then. They’ve been through childhood and a war together. They’ve laughed and fought, have made love and made children and made
“If that’s what you need to tell yourself to sleep at night, Potter.”
In the morning chill, the lake is colder than it was after having been sunwarmed all day before he’d bathed in it, but Draco has no plans to go in as deep. Joggers and socks discarded in the sand, he crouches on the shifting pebbles of the shallow waters and splashes his face. He doesn’t know what to think about what happened, and he tries not to let himself. But little flashes come anyway — the soft pads of Potter’s thumbs stroking under the hollows of his eyes as Draco washes away the tracks of his own tears; the sound of their breaths, ragged and anticipatory, as he cleans off his stomach and chest; the hard bulge of Potter’s cock through layers of denim and cotton and the roll of Potter’s hips against his, as Draco cleans off his cock. He remembers the feel of their pricks in his hand, the pulse of Potter’s as he came, his groan muffled against Draco’s neck, and Draco scrubs his hands with wet sand until they feel as raw as he does inside.
“So what on earth did Granger send you to me for?” Malfoy asked. “Or was she just having an off day?”
And somehow instead of trying to wrench himself out of Potter’s grip again, Draco realised he’d started kissing Potter back, all of Potter’s words quieting the Terrible Thing that had been raging through him. He wrapped his arms tight around Potter’s shoulders, parting his lips for Potter’s tongue. He slid his fingers into Potter’s windblown hair and held on, slanting his head for a deeper kiss.
“Go to Pomfrey if you’ve got a cold coming on,” he said, in a low, growly sort of way. “I don’t want to be kept up all night because you’re too used to having your mum fawn over you when you’ve got the sniffles.”
“But that would mean—” Draco stops, waking up a little to consider. Harry glances at him and hesitates, then lowers his wand and sits on his feet patiently. Slowly, Draco says, “If elf magic doesn’t draw Inferi, then it’s presumably unaffected by the— the drain,” he fumbles, finding no better way to describe it, “in the atmosphere. If they’re able to fight— That is, in the Battle ten years ago, they—”
“May I?”
“Ron really does love his broom. We’re supposed to have a bit of a game after dinner.”
Hermione stared, befuddled. Chewing, swallowing. She took another bite.
“I don’t,” he said, shakily. A confession; an admission of guilt. Something more.
Goyle stopped and looked at him, eyes widening for an awkward beat that left Harry feeling like he was witnessing a whole, unspoken conversation between them. Contritely he said, “Right, sorry. You said—”
Harry shrugged. “Cufflinks and tie pins and the like.”
“You’re going to want to
“Mal— Master Malfoy said something that—” Harry drew a breath, then said it bluntly. “Did I abandon you? When I left?”
“Mm.” Draco nodded. “So you did nothing."
“Granger’s been keeping something from you,” Draco says. “Obviously. But I’ve been thinking about it, and Weasley’s the one who brought my mother to Hogwarts, right?” He waits for Harry to nod, then says, pointedly, “
Potter frowns and looks up. His eyes are weary. “I know you’re a talented duellist,” he says evenly. "Being an Unspeakable attests to how gifted you must be as a wizard, god, at least to that much. And what I know of you from… before. But. Well, yes. Not of fighting or dying, or even of turning into one of those things. Just...”
I groaned and said, “Fucking Merlin,
, and, shaking as well, Harry mouthed at him and wondered when his last name had become an endearment.
Draco’s feet were long, elegantly boned. Harry felt a little smile claim his lips as he washed them, Draco’s heel, his long, high arch, between his toes. He couldn’t make it go away, a pinch around his mouth as he tried not to grin too broadly.
It was just a room. Cleaner than the last time Harry saw it, the mouldering furniture restored but otherwise unchanged, but… just a room, now.
Harry laughs. “Merlin, I missed you,” he says, and Draco’s smirk softens into something closer to a smile.
"That's true."
— but slowly winds his arms around Malfoy's waist and holds him close. His eyes sting and he closes them, breathing quietly.
“They don’t need to,” Draco says, a catch in his voice. He draws his legs up and spreads his knees, letting them fall to the sides. Harry groans. Draco’s knickers are split just behind the crotch panel, sections of lace swathing over each taut buttock up to his hips but leaving his cleft bare. His legs are so wide, Harry can see between his cheeks, the shadow of paler skin hidden there, and a darker, puckered pink that’s already greased. The contrast of white lace, such a delicate, virginal sort of thing, against Draco’s wanton position and the shine of oil over his arshole, plays hell on Harry’s nerves.
,” she ordered. Begged. Her chest hitched.
It’s not nothing, and the more he stews on it the more convinced he is that he’s right.
upon the mantelpiece.
” under his breath.
Harry knows by now to expect them, yet he can’t stop himself from crushing the newspaper in his hands after reading its headline. He can’t keep looking at it, has never seen one of its nature; the paps only ever allude to Harry’s anger and profanities, and dodge disappointingly around the snark they’re fed.
“I...” Draco shrugged. “It might have been nice to marry at my leisure,” he said, sardonic, "to someone I—”
“Out of line.” Everyone but Barnaby turned to Bill, who’d mostly been sitting there quietly, watching the proceedings. He took a breath and shook his head at Hermione, apologetically. “I— we all were. We were only able to find the original contract this morning; we’ve spent nearly two weeks working off a theory and an old copy we’d found. We came on a bit strong, too insistently, and then…”
"Some people," he murmurs, "are more productive in a less… structured environment."
Malfoy sniffs. “Don’t worry?”
For all Harry knew, he’d never stopped.

“So people keep telling me,” Harry said. A skitter of unease brought goosebumps to his arms; he valued Robards’ opinion — he, like Hermione, was seldom wrong. Even looking at the last few weeks, and being with Draco, through that lens, had the potential to change his perspective.
Then again, he's not sure how reliable his perception is anymore. The last few days… Or weeks… He's been looking at the door, just willing himself to have the courage to open it. The pangs of hunger that drove him so mad after awhile are completely gone. All of his conversations are with the dead girl who’d been his lifelong solace. And he's seeing
You’re in great danger, and Granger—”
‘Just rings’? Who the hell do you think you—”
, rumbling a moan that vibrated around the head of Draco’s prick. Draco gritted his teeth, trembling all over, and watched the seep of his own spunk leak out the sides of Potter’s mouth.
He’d never felt in want of things to do, or people to see.
“Thought of something.” Harry says, turning brusque. Passing Draco a protein bar, he snorts softly when Draco pulls a face, and then produces a chocolate bar from Merlin knows where; Draco’s been under the impression they’d eaten everything good.  “A complication, a bad one. We can probably fix it.”
dressed, as he hadn’t been in months, in richly-sheened, high-collared, navy robes, which had a multitude of tiny buttons snaking around his body, from the right side of his Adam’s apple down to his left calf. He’d brushed his hair back, had cufflinks at his wrists; he looked austere, dignified. Untouchable.
Everything comes rushing back, so fast and stark it takes his breath away: the door flying off its hinges, the spill of masked bodies, the hexes flying. Draco’s face as his
Harry resisted the impulse to tell her that he’d meant to eat it himself when he got home — it wouldn’t help his cause any — and gestured to the clock. “Dinner. Lunch was hours ago and Ron said you might not be home until late.” He shoved his hands into his pockets and came in from her doorway, looking around for a place to sit. The last time he’d been to her office, it had been nowhere near this cluttered, all of her files in various cabinets stacked against the walls, the pictures on her shelves unobscured by paperwork, actual seating available to visitors. “I guess you’ve been busier than I realised.”
, she’d said.
, then another, and that’s when he realises: the synced rhythm of Harry’s heartbeat is gone.
Wheezing, Draco shrugs his bag off and bends at the waist to catch his breath, his body reacclimating itself to the tingle of magic — for some reason tucked away, here, and undefiled. He lets it skitter over his skin and feels it petalling out from inside him, habitat and personal biology in perfect symmetry for the first time in weeks. He straightens, slowly, at Harry’s hand on his shoulder. Passes Harry’s wand over without being asked.
“Telling our own truths now?” Harry asks.
“I’ve got five weeks to learn the finer points of socialising with— everyone I’d be required to socialise with as Head Auror,” he said. “I’ve got to figure out how to charm the press — or at least not hex them to pieces when they approach — and politely turn aside stalkers, and dress in a way that the Wizengamot approves of and, I don’t know, hell, dance without breaking someone’s toes or ripping their clothes off—”
Harry took one, incensed step in Malfoy’s direction, shaking with rage, all of his hard work floating away before his eyes like sea kelp caught in a current. “
“It is being Kreacher’s privilege to die in the House of Black, for Master Harry.”
“We’ll get to it eventually,” he says. He skims his fingers down his dressing gown, parting it just enough to show a long, pale stripe of skin from his collarbone to his groin, where Harry sees—
* * *
Hermione takes a deep breath. Narcissa stands, watchful and silent, at her side. Her jaw is locked, her gaze clear but unyielding. The Inferi on the Quidditch pitch are clawing at the invisible buffer between them and their prey. Hermione avoids Minerva’s eyes.
“I meant it,” Draco muttered, breath hot on Harry’s jaw. He held himself stiffly in Harry’s arms as if poised to escape. Giving nothing back. “I don’t want to see you again.”
“I got that when you practically fainted after discovering I hadn’t cursed the presents,” Draco said. He cleared his throat. “I wasn’t going to. But then… Well, my form disappeared,” he said. He could so easily blame Pansy — Blaise, too, for that matter — but he’d already given them the silent treatment for two weeks and would much rather be the butt of a private joke than a public one. “Unexpectedly.”
Again: a zip of arousal, of awareness. Draco shakes it off and clears his throat. “No, I— No.”
“He never liked me, yeah,” Harry agreed, huffing a tired laugh and pulling Draco’s sheet a little lower to apply the salve to his collarbone, his throat. “He might not have anyway. But I’m, um, grateful, for everything he did. I understand better. Dumbledore used me for six years, and I practically worshipped him. I still do, a bit, sort of. And Ron left me, once,” he said, moving down Draco’s chest and onto a topic he felt less conflicted about, “that winter before the Battle. We had a fight, the worst we ever had, said unforgivable things to each other, and he left.” He scooped out a bit more salve. “I don’t know what I’d do without him in my life.”
“It might have more Muggle shops and the sort than any other township on our route within walking distance,” Draco argues.
“Then get one of each,” Malfoy said. “A Muggle instructor can carry you through the finer points of polite society, and any pureblood—”
“You’re sleeping here?”
“Whoa, hey.” Ron frowned. “What’s that about, with Shacklebolt? He’s done more for the Ministry than the last four Ministers combined. And he’s always been good to us, to you. Right?”
“I know,” Harry said. “It was, at first. Making the most out of a shit situation.”
I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. Probably should have done that from the start.
Mouth apparently entirely disconnected from his brain, what it supplied was, “Stripping?”
Malfoy’s throat worked, and he looked over Harry’s shoulder. Harry followed his gaze to Kreacher, whose ears had lifted from their perpetually flattened position against skull. Malfoy said, “Set me a place at the table.”

“Doesn’t work; my aunt tried once,” Potter said, tipping him an enigmatic sort of grin. He bent his neck, head falling forward, and oh fuck,
If you’ve hurt her, I’ll—”
At least Malfoy’s been cogent enough to not soil himself.
; he said it about all manner of possible things, the more feasible, the better. Startling Harry from behind in the library when Harry dropped a book, his fingers insinuating their way into Harry’s front pockets:
* * *
“We can be,” he says, then pauses. “She won’t be happy to find out I’m in love with a Muggle, but it’ll be out of concern for her.”
Every detail, except for how he was looking at Draco.
“I think it makes you feel superior to think that you can.” Granger pulls the sash of her ill-fitting dressing gown tighter and clutches its gaping collar closed with one hand with such force that her knuckles turn white.
I am about to come in my pants.
And then Malfoy’s mouth is on Harry’s, and it’s everything Harry hadn’t realised was missing from the last time, storms of evolution pulsing through Harry as Malfoy’s tongue slides hot into his mouth. Malfoy wrenches out of the kiss and shoves Harry again so he stumbles into Malfoy’s desk, stacks of files like a clap of thunder when they hit the floor. But this time Malfoy comes with him, covers him, pressing him down so Harry’s bent impossibly back, his shoulders against the smooth wood, his toes barely grazing the floor. Malfoy gives him another kiss, a rough, biting thing that races shivers straight to Harry’s cock, and knocks his way between Harry’s dangling legs with one knee, the other coming up to rest outside Harry’s hip. “Oh god,” Harry gasps into his mouth. “Draco.”
nearly as often, which was a bit of a revelation on its own. To be able to go to bed smiling, to see his friends and be interested in something, to make someone laugh even when they were irritated at you… they weren’t the things Harry had envisioned hanging his hat on, but they weren’t bad ones, either.
Harry released Draco’s hair to ring his fingers around the base of his cock — even that tight, stemming squeeze nearly too much — and gave a strangled wheeze trying to pull in enough oxygen, then said, “
Draco pauses. “Yes.” He glances over his shoulder and smiles, a bit wistfully. “But you knew that, then. That’s why you left.”
Stunned, he said it again, as though doing so might explain it to him: "You always tell me not to do things when… When you think I should."
He’s got to; he’d waited for Harry to leave the bathroom before undressing, still recovering from the shock of such a chill though he was. Harry’d known it, too, but the idea that they might be dry enough to put back on brings with it a brief wave of dizziness as most of the blood leaves his brain in favour of travelling to his fattening erection.
— for fuck’s sake, Draco! — and saw the gleam of white teeth behind a crooked smile before Potter suddenly swooped in, batting my hand away and replacing it with one of his own. He lifted my cock with a decidedly charming snort of laughter when I glared, and slid his lips over the head... and
It’s like a dance, this thing they do, a low-grade sort of Legilimency that comes from being attuned to one another. It was that very seamless teamwork in regards to their domestic habits and preferences that had been Harry’s deciding factor for asking Draco if he wanted to look for a place together when it came time to vacate the trainee dorms, not that he’d been too worried about a refusal. Draco had been dropping snide little hints he might be receptive to an offer for months anyway:
“Have we done enough of it yet?”
Harry wakes up to Draco’s slow kiss sometime before the sun’s risen, the sky pitch black beyond the snow on the windows. Draco straddles his face at Harry’s murmured request, wanking lazily as Harry eats him, fingers him, and comes all over Harry’s chest before rolling onto his stomach and letting Harry push his cock in deep. Harry rocks into him with tiny nudges of his hips, whispering endearments he’s never used before into Draco’s ear and sucking over his neck until Draco’s hard again. Then Harry pushes his hands under Draco’s chest and plucks at his nipples, smiling at every whimper and curse Draco issues when he comes apart, when they come apart together. They fall asleep again, Draco’s palm warm and possessive on the side of Harry’s neck.
“I think… two things,” Draco says cautiously after several minutes. The dirt road Harry’s led them to is dry, and sends up flurries of dust around them with each step they take; it doesn’t take long before Draco feels caked in the stuff. “The first is that, to study the Veil, you have to learn how to attune yourself with those who’ve crossed it. To intercept their… call,” he says, a little flustered by the flat, steady look Harry gives him. “They warn you that the skill might linger. As I understand it, those of us who continue our studies in the Death room, the ability to sense the dead becomes a constant thing. A fleeting sensation when they pass a graveyard, or when they touch a precious object belonging to someone recently dead. I’ve never felt it before, but it's possible I have some latent sensitivity to it?” he says, accidentally making it a question because he really can’t be sure.
Molly and Arthur were next. “I’m sorry,” Harry told Draco after they’d gone. “I would have asked you to eat with us, but Molly— after Bill and, and Fred—”
"Honestly, George," Ginny said in the background, "what if Mum had got trapped under there with Bill? Or
“Well spotted.” He gave Harry a thoughtful look. “Any more insightful observations you’d care to make?”
why.” It was desperate, the thing clawing at Harry's chest — the urge to move, to say it right. “I did it because—”
“Yeah,” Harry says. He drags his fingers through the trail of hair under Draco’s belly button, then splays them over Draco’s hip. “The story though. It was about… I suppose, how the world came to be.”
of them.” She displays it, turning it over for Narcissa’s perusal, then smiles slowly. “I’m going to use it to speak with Harry today. And then I’m going to speak to your son.”
“And Granger, as well,” Draco mutters. “How accurate, exactly,
“Draco, I—”
“Help?” Harry suggests, amused, and Draco flicks Harry’s earlobe, a small scowl knitting his brow.
“Good,” he murmured, keeping his touch maddeningly light. “I wanted to make you do it.”
~ ~ ~
“I know what it’s like,” she confesses quietly when he thanks her. “I spent months, after I turned seventeen, not knowing whether we’d suit once his birthday came around. And knowing that even if we did, there was no guarantee he’d want me to claim him. Wanting someone so deeply and not having them…” She sighs, and turns a page. “But even I can’t imagine how bad that uncertainty might have felt if he’d presented as an Omega. I just want you to be sure.”
“I liked you better the last time I saw you,” Harry informed her grimly.
And Draco felt possessed with it, that Potter wanted him close. He sealed his mouth over Potter’s and barely felt the sudden chill of sweat at his back when Potter nimbly stripped his nightshirt off and tossed it aside, barely felt the light brush of Potter’s hand against his left forearm — could feel nothing but the wet grip of Potter’s arse around his cock and the stab of Potter’s gaze as he kissed Draco back, eyes shadowed but open. Draco fucked into him, “slow” nothing but a waning idea of how he was supposed to do it now, made even less tolerable when Potter panted out, “More, Malfoy, fuck, you can go harder,” against his mouth.
the pulse of his come inside you, spurt after spurt, hot and generous and
“Should I call them zombies?” Potter asks, a humourless smile curling his lips. But his good arm arcs out before Draco can ask what he means, the flat of his hand slapping Draco in the middle of the chest. Under his breath, he says, “Don’t move.”
He will, Harry's sure.
Harry swallowed. “Is that when you—? How you—?”
“Just happened.”
“Don’t be cheeky,” Draco breathed, through barely-parted lips.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked.
“Come back to our room tonight,” Potter said. “We should talk.”
"What is he even doing in here?" Draco asked with a scowl.
He spent the next few hours researching whether it was possible to make an Unbreakable Vow with oneself, if it pertained to something simple like not fucking someone you were sort of sure you shouldn’t be, even if you hadn’t yet figured out the reason. Finding a spell that ought to work wasn’t precisely the relief Draco thought it would be, but he copied it down, regardless. He stared at it, poured himself three fingers of whiskey even though it disagreed with his system, and put the spell in a drawer when Potter finally arrived.
Draco pushes up on his elbow and reaches over Harry, flicking the lamp on. His brow is furrowed, his lips pursed tightly. A month ago, Harry would have thought he was scowling, but he knows better now, knows what faces Draco makes when he’s running on his last dregs of energy or when he’s about to come, and what he looks like when he’s working something out, and this is definitely the latter. They don’t ask questions about their confessions. It’s a small kindness, Harry supposes, but it feels like an important one. Any of the things he’s said under the cover of night, told to Ron and Hermione, would be promptly followed by reassurances, by sympathy or pity or both, all phrased cleverly to lead Harry to the conclusions they’ve drawn. But Draco seems to understand what a balm it can be to wallow in self-recrimination, to hate himself for things done and not done, just as Harry does. They talk and they fuck and, in the dark, they find a way to let the darkness go.
” Harry tightens his hand, taking in the sight of Draco’s cock, swollen and covered in white lace. Draco’s cockhead is flushed,
It comes in the form of a man, not entirely unlike The One Who Lived.
“I’m sorry,” he said, something complicated passing over his face as he walked up to Harry, “the article in the paper brought in a few—”
“Yeah.” Harry bobbed his head. “Sleep, eat. I can do that.”
“Huh.” They walk for a few more minutes, the heat of the midday sun battering down on the back of Draco’s neck. Then Harry says, “My team members were, yeah, also a mix. A few of them were turned, others just killed. It never occurred to me that their blood statuses might have some bearing on which.”
Malfoy returned his shrug, shifting around Harry’s unused accessories with his index finger. “If that’s a euphemism for wanking, I’m disappointed to have to inform you that it’s impolite to discuss those habits in front of guests.”
“I can’t tell you that,” she said. “Even if I knew all of it.”
“It doesn’t seem likely, no,” she said with a sly grin, and Harry laughed and led her deeper onto the dance floor.
“Seven.” Harry grimaces. “At the last count.”
“It implies the link was already there.”
Granger inhales sharply. “Do you— Are you saying Voldemort thought he might return as an Inferi? That he intended to
But this… This, Harry didn’t know how to navigate. Not his own savage desire to lay waste to someone, not how good the sudden caution in Malfoy’s eyes had felt when he'd got out of his chair.
“Potter, go,” Malfoy says a bit breathlessly, biceps bunching tighter against Harry’s ribcage. Harry blinks himself back into the moment, a little dizzy, and finds that they’re hovering in place, steady.
“Right.” Malfoy gave him a suspicious look, rubbing the back of his neck. The sleeve of his pyjamas slid down and Harry’s gaze wandered to the pale blue map of Malfoy’s veins visible under the creamy skin at the inside of his wrist. Exasperated with both of them, Harry wanted to lick him there, too. He took off his glasses entirely and dropped them on the side table, apparently too tired to deal with Malfoy in sharp focus, just as Malfoy said, “Well, that’s one of my conditions. Sleep. Eat properly. Consider letting me take care of that mess around your magical atmosphere, but if not— at least do me the consideration of not getting me arrested for being in your general vicinity when you can’t maintain your health any longer.”
And then Goyle said, uncomfortable and apologetic, “I won’t be able to properly measure his inseam if… If…”
Draco licked his lips, hesitating. Then he bent over Harry — slowly, giving him time to move away. His kiss was light, his eyes open but heavy-lidded, a smoulder that re-kindled the jumbled heat in Harry’s stomach.
“Just...curious, I guess,” Potter said, sounding a little drugged. He peeked at Draco and shut his eyes again. Draco resolutely trained his gaze at the wall above his bed and rubbed the shampoo through Potter’s hair, building the foam. Potter sighed. “‘ve always had trouble with… You know, styling it.”
“It should be of use to someone,” Harry said bitterly, reminded of the regretful edge to Robards’ voice as he broke the news. Malfoy frowned and looked so like he was about to say something scathing, Harry couldn’t stop a snicker from breaking free from his throat. “Besides, I’d be more worried about the Hippogriff population, really.”
Uneasy, Harry said, “What do you mean?”
“I’m not—” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, then moved to the window, looking out. “No,” he said, back to Harry. “Yes. I don’t know.”
“The best anesthetic spells cause a contradictory reaction to the potions in your system,” Draco murmured, “but that should help a little.” He fidgeted with his wand for a moment. Turned and set it aside. “You’re, um. Going to be fine, now that you— You’ll be fine,” he said, and with a laboured smile added, “though as your Healer, I want to unequivocally recommend that you find other ways to get your name in the papers; this was rather dramatic, even for you.”
“Was this on the map?” Draco can’t help but ask. For a few, blissful minutes, he doesn’t even think about the awkwardness of talking to Potter, too grateful for the taste of something fresh and bright on his palate. The berries are overripe, juicy and sweet, bursting with the mere effort it takes to press them to the roof of his mouth with his tongue. He doesn’t miss the irony; a month ago, he dined only on the finest ingredients and in the finest restaurants, when he had the chance to go out. Now, wild berries — from the middle of Nowhere, France, and scoured clean with a fast charm — taste like ambrosia.
“So take me off the bloody thing!” Harry croaked, setting down his drink with a thunking scrape. He’d fumbled at the clasp of the watch, fingers trembling and throat tight — aching. Bill’s hand covered his, stilling him.
” he said curtly. “They’ll both be here.”
disturbing the air.
He gave me a sheepish look. “No. But I thought we were working our way there. And I thought you were good with it!
“Then you’re not— We’re not—”
“Fine, then: Yes.”
that’s—”
“Why don’t you go through that one,” Harry says quietly. “I’ll take care of this.”
“Fine. Good lord, what have I got myself—” Malfoy’s chest deflated with an angry exhale, and he said, “I’m done with you for tonight. We’ll go over specifics tomorrow. Be at my studio at ten.”
Draco was shaking his head. The glassy fever in his eyes had brightened, the hectic colour of his face growing deeper. He said, “Well. You couldn’t possibly think I’d admit to everything I just did if I didn’t have a— a reasonable certainty of…”
“I will?” Harry asked.
“Perhaps,” Narcissa says agreeably, though the suggestion that she might
.” Harry huffs. “I’m just—” He squirms away from Malfoy’s hands. They take hold of him again immediately, stubbornly, straightening him and then running down, flat, against the backs of Harry’s tensed thighs. Corrective. And back up, an almost-clinical touch as they skim over Harry’s arse to pinch his hips again. Harry swallows. His voice comes out strangled, his excuse lame. “—uncomfortable.”
"You assume I'm not doing it because you'd be a step up from the arsehole currently in the position?"
Amused, Narcissa favours her with a small smile. “Well then, let me assure you how fully I plan on cooperating.” It's true. To a point, at least. Granger is already guarded; if she concludes Narcissa is no use to her, the repercussions might be extensive. “I did give you my word, which you may consider,” she widens her smile when Granger narrows her eyes, “near as reliable as an Unbreakable Vow. Although I do feel the need to point out,” she adds composedly, “that you didn’t live up to yours.”
“Not even that,” Harry says, frustration as insidious as a Devil’s Snare crawling through him. Draco barks a wry laugh and Harry pauses. “Are you saying you didn’t want me to? That you don’t?”
It didn’t sound boastful. Harry said, “She loves you.”
, as if it might stop anything. But to his surprise, it did: the ribbon tying his wrist to Malfoy’s dissolved; Malfoy fled to the shelter of his mother’s arms. Harry ground his teeth together, his hand dangling, numb and useless, by his side. He dragged his gaze from the window in time to be herded out by Ron and Hermione, by Molly and Arthur and Bill — their hands on his shoulders, his waist, his arms. Luna stayed behind, her big blue eyes following them.
“Thank you,” Bill said, gravely returning his nod, his gaze moving back and forth between them, “for the invitation.”
“I knew it,” he said. Draco opened his mouth to launch into an explanation about the finer points of sarcasm, but Weasley turned to Granger and added, “Didn’t I know it?”
“I told you yesterday,” Draco said, pulling the knot of his tie back to the base of his throat and quirking an eyebrow at him. “I saw gold sparks.”
Face colouring, Goyle nodded and turned back to his cabinet. “This’ll just take a second.”
Deliberately, Draco broke their gaze to look Harry over again, lingering here and there, and for each pause — on Harry’s arms, his chest, his fluttering stomach, the v leading into his pants — Harry took a second to thank the gods for the rigorous daily training that kept him in shape. Draco lifted both hands, resting one of them on Harry’s hip and stroking the air over the skinny trail of dark hair under Harry’s belly button with two fingers, frustratingly close but not touching, a faraway look on his face. Then he set his other hand to Harry’s opposite hip, curled his fingers into the loose waistband of his trousers, and shimmied them until they dropped to puddle between Harry’s knees. Harry shifted and let them fall to the floor, stepped out of them. He watched, mesmerised, as Draco bent and retrieved them, folding them over one arm before looking back up to Harry.
With an air of ‘you idiot’, Draco sniffed and said, “I was redeeming myself with Ms Martinez. I barely got a word in edgewise when we met because you inexplicably decided to grow an inner swot, and I refuse to let her believe you know more about foreign finance than I do. And then I was answering a question she posed, which you
Draco covers him again, his chest and torso sliding over Harry’s cock, until finally it’s the rasp of lace, and the slick, hard length of Draco’s cock pressing against his. Draco lies against him, propped on his forearms, their mouths a breath apart, and spreads his legs, knees coming down on either side of Harry.
Harry’s squirming stomach clenched. “Yeah,” he said, turning back to the crop of Leaping Toadstools. “Yeah, I’m almost done.”
He huddles in the corner of the cell. The walls glow white with the strength of the wards. Blinking against their brightness, Harry tunes into Ron's voice. He sounds unnerved — scared.
. “—something we, you know, made for um, all of you. So—”
“Don’t be ridiculous, the woman was a nightmare — but portrait magic is
“Then you have your answer.”
after seven years, inexplicably fond and tense with desire. Maybe that look was an answer on its own to all of Draco’s questions. Maybe Draco didn’t need to know what was going to happen, didn’t need to prepare for it. Just

Committed. You’ve heard what it can be like, but you opt to find your own Betas through pheromone match-casting. You prefer to be realistic — that sort of happiness is not for people like you.
This was preposterous. “It’s my bed! Go away!”
“I saw,” Harry said hoarsely, tasting the beach on his ragged inhale. “I— I would have.”
you think when he gives it to you a second time, a third, a fourth, filling you up. Wanking you, making you come, making feel better than ought to be humanly possible.
But Draco’s long wondered how things might have been different had Lucius not decided his priorities, his loyalties, so early in life. If he’d been willing to examine them more closely later on.
Potter didn’t budge, of course. “How did you reassess? He really will like the scarf, if I gave you the wrong idea.”
“Your arse, or the knickers?” Harry asks. The answer is the same either way, but the question is intriguing. Draco’s eyes are steady on him, and he nods. Harry shifts, pressing his thighs a little closer as his prick comes to the conclusion it might be useful to the conversation. “Do you have any here?”
She ended up telling her father regardless, and Bella as well, saying that the Hat hadn’t spoken at all, and asking if it wasn’t perhaps time they retired the thing? It seemed a quite Slytherin way of avoiding repercussions for the delay and she congratulated herself on it until Andromeda caught her complaining to Bella for the third time and gave her a look of such pained disapproval Narcissa had to look away.
Potter hesitates. “Survival, usually. Of one kind or another.” He breathes quietly, then scoots over to edge a little more of his bundled jacket-pillow towards Draco. “G’night, Malfoy.”
, I want your cock, please— I need—” He arched to take Harry’s mouth in another kiss, deep, ragged breaths tearing from his chest, then pushed off the wall with one hand and reached between them, stilled Harry’s wrist. He opened his eyes a slit. “
Draco Summoned his tie.
“I think you might’ve,” Harry says, drinking in the clean, haughty lines of Draco’s profile, the satin fall of his hair. Draco’s throat bobs, he shakes his head. Harry takes a breath. “Do you know how long we’ve been together?”
Not that Draco had done; he’d only ever used a bed, and not since a six-month streak with Theo well over two years ago. But Potter either took him at his word or was goaded by the challenge. The damp kiss on Draco’s neck became a hard nip, and Potter slid one hand down to Draco’s hip to pull him back, smearing precome over Draco’s arsecheek as Potter pushed against him again. He walked Draco forward, to a long bench between the showers and the sinks, his breath hot against the back of Draco’s ear.
“No, Hermione would have given us a cushion.” Harry hopes so, at least, given that neither he nor Draco can recall what time they left the hotel, to the minute. He shrugs off his jacket and pulls the bag of beads from his pocket, shaking one of them into his hand. “She asked if I still had these, so she meant for us to use them, but since the phone is charged I can’t think what we might need them for.”
For some reason, that clears away the embarrassment still shimmering on the edges of Harry’s mind, and startles him into a soft laugh. “Yeah, I... I forgot just how bad they felt. I’m, well. They used to be a lot worse,” he volunteers — carefully, quietly, feeling his way now that the encroaching darkness has receded. Curious how Malfoy will respond to information like that, when it’s given freely.
Harry frowned and said, “You do?”, only realising how insulting it sounded when Malfoy shot him a sharp look of dislike, as if he couldn’t help it, before dropping his gaze just as swiftly. Malfoy tossed the moss he’d collected into his own basket and stood up, wordless again, which was nothing Harry should have felt bothered by, but did. He said, “Only because Neville didn’t know what they were called until third year.”
“You should really stop listening to those.”
Narcissa lifts an eyebrow, studying her for a beat before turning to Hermione. “I should thank you for my new rooms,” she says.
“Right, but—” Harry sucked in a breath as Draco’s hand found his flaccid cock. He was more than a little sore but it felt nice, regardless; he supposed there was no help for it. “Of, of—” he managed.
"You should just run," Ron spat. "Hermione's been saying it, we'll organise a campaign--"
It was at least a partial truth, in more way than one: conversations and occasionally tea were responsible for our lengthening sessions, and considering I’d gotten up at five o’clock that morning, I wasn’t chuffed to be falling into my bed at eleven. Besides, the more time I spent around him, the more often the bastard was in my head.
“What's Harry?” Ron asked, shooting her a sheepish look. He lifted two of the plates from midair, passing one over to Harry. The salty grease of Ron’s selection — fish and chips — teased at Harry’s senses and he tried to recall when he ate last. Breakfast, probably.
“Call me that ever again, and I’ll kill you,” Harry said quietly. He sent a silent prayer of thanks to Draco for funnelling out so much of the pain storming through him, but it was still there, edging up to the boundaries of his self control. Robards’ cheeks went ashen as if he could sense how deeply his manipulations had cut, how serious Harry’s threat was. But he merely inhaled after a moment, then drained his drink and set it down.
was worse by far, Malfoy so quiet and unresponsive after the last of his tremors subsided, Harry haunted by the hollow rattle of Malfoy’s breathing and his own regret. Malfoy looked like a disaster victim, his creamy complexion violated by sores, his utter repose a gross underscore that, wherever his mind was, it could not be reached.
“Should be fine if you don’t make them hot.”
!” He turned from Draco and started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt with surprisingly nimble fingers, pausing briefly to check Harry’s face for permission when Harry stiffened, then continuing when he seemed to ascertain that Harry was uncomfortable but not about to draw his wand. Stripping the article off Harry’s back, Goyle brought it up close to his own face. “You Transfigured the
“I need to step down from the majority of my duties after today.”
“No.” Draco turned, shaking his head. Rueful. “I hadn’t planned for you to.”
“I was,” Draco said slowly. His face had gone expressionless and Harry thought of the way Draco’s invitation had landed on his desk, and what he’d said after. Had it been offhand, or merely… guarded?
Harry’s t-shirt is wet, rubbing unpleasantly against his torso as he paces back and forth with Teddy in his arms. And if he’s uncomfortable, Teddy’s got to be, as well. He wonders if he should forcibly unwind Teddy’s clinging limbs from around him and plunk him down to draw a bath. Some parents are able to make themselves do that — overlook their kid’s tears. Are supposed to, at least according to the books. For others it’s probably instinctive, and Merlin knows there are some who don’t even care. Apparently Harry fits none of those moulds, because he obviously doesn’t have the instincts he was sure would materialise when he needed them. Just the idea of pretending he doesn’t care closes his airways tight, makes him feel helpless. He hates feeling helpless.
is that Draco’s attempt to escape from the awkwardness of his own thoughts has dumped him directly into thoughts where his body feels the need to participate. Which is decidedly inconvenient, especially considering the guilt that still accompanies it, quadrupling as Draco hesitates. He shakes his head, busying himself with smoothing out the length of elastic fabric and searching through Potter’s bag for another, Potter’s body too exposed to Draco’s gaze. It’s not as if he hasn’t seen it, not as if he hasn’t slept next to it. That Potter’s training has blessed him with a lean, hard chest and lightly sculpted shoulders, that Potter’s stomach is taut with a trail of dark hair into his joggers, that his body is well-formed and pleasing to look upon, comes as no great shock. And it’s no new thing to be aware that Potter’s attractive, either. But it’s always been an abstract sort of knowledge, Draco’s jealousy of him in school obscuring anything deeper, his determination to move on afterward allowing for no room to examine any fleeting considerations he might have had.
Harry sat up straighter, gripping the arms of the chair. The fabric was soft under his palms, incongruous to the beat of tension pulsing between them. “Like Hermione can’t? But you can.”
“Visit? How kind,” Narcissa says. She slides over a little on her narrow bed and gestures to the bread pudding she still has on her plate from supper. “Would you like this while you keep me company? I must admit, it’s rather lonely in here. I’d so love to hear news of what’s going on outside.”
“Oh. No.” Harry remembered to look up at her again after a moment. He forced a smile. “Thanks. If I could have the bill, please?”
Harry studies Malfoy carefully and sees the tension leak from the line of him, the way his body moulds to the mattress, his head sinking into the pillow in a way it hadn’t been before. It takes several more minutes, but finally his breathing slows and steadies.
It’s Draco’s turn to hesitate. He doesn’t think Potter will like the reminder very much, and it’s not something he even likes talking about, merely something that had been required of him, to be put out of his mind as soon as he was able. But it’s relevant enough, so he takes a breath. “I did a two year study in the Death Chamber before transferring to Inventions.”
“No, I was just… It’s fine.” Draco snorts. Shakes his head. His cheeks have gone hot again, but perhaps it’s just the hiking. “What is it?”
and was able to return to his book. Others, he looked up in time to see the moment before Draco’s spell worked, the pleasure and anticipation on Draco’s face like a glow, wand twirling with confident skill — and Harry had to leave the room entirely, mind determinedly blank.
“I just do.” Draco gave him a bewildered, distracted look, then frowned as if only just realising Harry felt like splintering another one of his walls. “What? Why are you—? You can’t honestly be that upset that she’s here. Regardless, this isn’t up for negotiation; Pansy spent some time—”
“From who?” Harry removes his hand from his eyes and lifts his head from the pillow, glasses falling in place as he stares incredulously at Malfoy. His blurt feels like a confession squatting ugly between them, and one he didn’t mean to make. One he wouldn’t have, if he’d given it any thought, because it sounds like an excuse and isn’t one, and ultimately doesn’t matter anyway.
he? Sometimes I think he has to; sometimes he looks at me the way he just did, and I'm almost certain it clicks. He's such a brilliant Auror, I never know whether to be grateful or horrified that he can be so unobservant about other matters. That he doesn't realise I'm a fucking slag for him. That the lift of one of those dark brows makes my whole body throb. Fuck, it took me nearly a day to leave my room after seeing him emerge from the loo in just a towel for the first time, golden skin still beaded with clinging droplets water, the slender feathering of hair below his belly button damp.
Draco paused, his back to Harry, his hand clenching and unclenching on the doorknob. He pivoted back around on the ball of his polished Oxfords to look at Harry; his face was unreadable for what seemed like a long time, and then he lifted his hand to press his thumb and forefinger against his eyelids, and laughed, a little brokenly. Massaging his eyes, he said, “Potter, are you saying— That is, am I meant to understand that you’re— that you like, are attracted to—”
It seems to startle Harry; he whips his head sideways to study him. “Why?”
It sounded complimentary, so Draco pushed him back, just far enough that he could regain his senses for a moment. Interested, he said, “What about the way I fly?”
“After you planted them.”
Grudgingly, Harry holds himself in place as Malfoy pulls his good arm from its sleeve, then works the jacket down his dislocated arm. Harry glances down and immediately away, grinding his teeth against the bile threatening to rise in his throat. His shoulder joint juts out under the skin against the fabric of his t-shirt, a dark green-blue bruise discolouring his arm where Malfoy peels the material up to take a look.

Shitting fuck. Harry closes his eyes, a fresh wave of pain pulsing through him. Trust Malfoy to obliterate what tenuous hold Harry has over his control of it. “I’ll wrap it. I just need to wrap it. There’s something I can use for a sling in my bag,” he says. “We don’t have time for me to fix it, and we’re too exposed here.”
* * *
And there it was again, more a slither of a feeling than a thought: What if. What if he had, and Draco hadn’t written back? What if he was the only one who felt—
“Yeah. But it was mad, after the…” Harry hesitated. “After. I knew there was no way I’d ever be able to expect, well, anything approaching normal with a life like that, not after everything else. The Ministry said it would die down, left the offer open. It’s still open, I suppose. McGonagall said she’d welcome me in a teaching position and I considered that for a while but… I got offers from— you know, Quidditch scouts...”
been enough to set that off,” Malfoy said, not meeting his eye, “but there were some other factors at play that day and no, we aren’t going to talk about them, and if you need me to apologise for my behaviour before you tell me what the bloody fuck we’re doing here, I might as well ask them to wrap up my meal to take home.”
“Yes. Of course.” She reached up to pat Harry’s cheek. Went to pull away, and paused, her palm soft and slightly puffy, comforting against his cheek. Her voice softened. “Yes. And you’ve done a perfectly fine job of it, dear… the both of you.”
“By what measurement?” Hermione asks her.
“I don’t know,” Draco said, “but—”

He’d sunk at the time, too far away for Petunia to reach him quickly, only to find himself on the hot cement moments later, coughing water from his lungs, his body wracked with a sensation he wouldn’t recognise until he turned eleven. He spent the rest of his summer avoiding Vernon around water. Spent the whole following year learning how to navigate it, first in the bath, and then in the pool of a vacant house down the street.
“We’re in a hurry today, yes,” Draco said, more gently. He patted Goyle on the arm.
Hermione looks up at him; his eyes are dark, haunted, and she remembers: His mother was being treated for a broken limb at St Mungo’s when the world cracked in half. There’s scant space in the alcove, but he takes a tiny step back to lean against the stones of the castle, crooking one knee and propping his foot up below him.

Harry scoffed. “Obviously.”
“Good?” Harry asks breathlessly, after, when their clothes are back in order and the only evidence of sex left is the musky scent that permeates the tent.
Harry chooses the wider path. “I wonder if there’s a trigger,” he murmurs. But he doesn’t seem to expect an answer, so Draco shrugs and moves on.
Hogwarts had always been his home, anyway.

arousing, and Harry licked his lips, reaching down to shakily work his own flies open as he glided Draco’s foreskin back.
Even a
As though Granger can see the questions fighting for space on Narcissa’s tongue, she smiles and sits back once more. Studies her fingernails. Narcissa ruthlessly controls the base instinct to scratch her eyes out.
Draco blinked and, following a short, strange pause, said, “Well—” Then he paused again, opened his mouth to say more, closed it, and turned to his meal. Harry considered it a fitting response and lifted the cover from his own.
“What happens in the photograph, Hermione?” Narcissa asks again, and huffs a small, genuine laugh when Granger narrows her eyes.
He looked like an outraged albino peacock standing there, pale from head to toe, the feathers of his hair fanning as he shook his head, practically vibrating with impotent fury. Harry’s heart swooped and, euphoric, he struggled to contain the laugh in his chest.
Malfoy shoved past Harry, nearly knocking him into the wall. “‘What?’” he demanded, waving a crumpled ball of parchment in Harry’s face. “Did you really just ask me
He opened it.
“You realise this means I’ll have access to your magic.”
Harry trembles, chin resting upon his knee. "But I can feel— I can smell— He—" The words break off, a riptide yanking him back into the deep. A growl rumbles in his throat, thick with accusation:
“Right. No,” Malfoy said. Startled, Harry glanced at him. Found his cheeks as red as Harry’s felt to be. Malfoy sniffed and strode to Narcissa, tossing a clipped, “Best say your farewells,” over his shoulder before gathering her in his arms. He murmured quietly in her ear.
“Yeah.” Harry gulped at the removal of his fingers, repeating himself as the round head of Malfoy’s cock prodded him: “Yeah.”
The reason for Potter’s order becomes apparent about an hour after exiting the sanctuary of trees. At first, they travel through sleepy neighborhoods, so undisturbed Draco can almost convince himself they’ve gone entirely untouched if not for the occasional house door standing wide open, and eerily overgrown gardens. But their path gradually gives way to taller buildings built closer together... parking structures… dead bodies in the road. Draco is surprised how jarring it is, after what they left behind in Paris.
“Right. Thank you,” Draco said, as politely as he could. Potter grunted in reply, so Draco drew his bed hangings shut and Summoned the plain blue paper he’d chosen. He busied himself wrapping the chess set, industriously
Afterward, he showed them around Grimmauld Place — the expansive kitchens, the sets of stairs that went nowhere, the new doors that wouldn’t open yet — and was able to field Hermione’s multitude of questions about the wheres and whens he first noticed something different. But he had no answers for the whys.
Frankly, he’s a little unable to believe it’s happening even as he stares at Malfoy’s bent head in the mirror, a strand of distinctive hair falling over the front of Harry’s shoulder like it’s laying a claim there. Harry lets his own head fall forward, knocking against the image; he lets himself focus on the plunge of Malfoy’s long cock in and out of him, on the way Malfoy’s forearm presses too tight against Harry’s stomach to keep him in place.
“And Rose?”
“I remember,” Draco says. He sounds as tired as Harry feels, but slants him a wry smile. “You took us inside the seasonal globe.” He nods at Harry’s expression and jerks his chin at the door. “There will be supplies. I won’t be a minute. Go.”
“I’d have to understand what they are first,” Harry said resentfully. “I’m getting conversational whiplash.”
didn’t realise it — or
“Narcissa Malfoy has always been many things, but a fool is not one of them,” Minerva says, escorting her out of the door, one comforting hand on Hermione’s back. Her eyes are narrow when Hermione glances at her, and she lifts her eyebrow again. “I said that she
"I'm… yes," Hermione says. "You know you shouldn't be sneaking around places you've not been given permission to go. And we will be discussing it later, Rose. B-but for now, I need to talk to Narcissa, and you need to— Please go to Neville and Hannah's quarters."
“I’m going to make you fucking miserable,” he muttered.
“It’s called consideration,” Harry said, heartbeat a sharp staccato in his throat. “Look it up, it’s a fascinating concept.”
“Ugh, fuck off.” Draco pulled out, rolling to the side. He passed a hand over his face, then lower, running his fingers through Harry’s spunk on his stomach — thoughtfully, if such a thing could be considered thoughtful. He sighed, his jaw knotting.
“I know,” Harry said. “That’s my point.”
Draco’s smile grew. He looked wrung out, but… beautiful, almost ethereal, sat near the beams of sunlight coming in through the drifting curtains.
It took Harry a few moments to organise his thoughts in the face of that. Other than during the brief statement Malfoy had read at his sentencing, Harry had never seen him look so totally accountable for the damage he had inflicted — knowingly or unknowingly. Harry nodded again. “Okay. I— It’s not something most other people have to consider, I suppose, and I was mostly angry when I thought that you’d… When—”
He closed his eyes.
“Um. I wondered about your tattoo.”
Then he stopped, a wheeze exploding from his lungs. Draco twisted his head over his shoulder, curious, and Harry shook his head, his laugh cracking, breathless. There was no appropriate way to explain.
“You are
Harry heard it like the swift clip of the playing card Dudley had affixed to the spokes of his third bicycle — an insidious sound he’d learnt to identify for the few extra seconds of warning it gave him, whenever he’d been stupid enough to nearly get caught on the playground by himself:
And then, a hush fell. On the last night of Draco’s convalescence, the storm quieted to howling winds, to the graze of branches against a window, to a bated breath. As though the throb of the rain had sought a warmer place to live, next to a beating heart. They spoke quietly, in murmurs:
“Fuck. Yes,” Harry grits out, and it’s true. “You look so pretty taking my cock.” He pulls down the elastic of Draco’s waistband to halfway down his shaft, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s glans. Draco turns his head and presses his chin to his shoulder, arse clamping tight around Harry’s prick. The smooth shimmy of his hips turns into a bounce, up and down, and his hands move from Harry’s belly to Harry’s thighs; he leans back, gripping them for balance. He’s so hot inside, like his mouth but tighter, and the friction is nearly unbearable. Harry arches into him, Draco’s arse squeezing him tighter each time Hary teases him. “I want to be in you so often you forget what it’s like when I’m not.”
“And before Pansy’s room?” Draco asked, arching a brow. Potter frowned.
Draco’s eyes flare, and he gives a small nod, then sits up over Harry. “Yes.
“He’s a
Harry thought before he could catch himself. Warm face growing hotter, he glanced back at the table and blew out a breath. “Why haven’t I ever heard of it before?”
Her lips took on a sour twist. She continued after him but fell blessedly silent, only drawing in one sharp inhale when Harry twisted the knob of the third door and opened it: a bedroom, barren of furniture but for a small wash stand and narrow bed. But Draco was sound asleep in the bed, the covers drawn up to his armpits, a dark sleep mask affixed over his eyes. Harry’s breath left him with a
"Fuck, yes," Harry says, his growl more delighted than he ever knew it could be. He takes Draco's mouth in another kiss, and thinks of the sink of his teeth into Draco's neck, when Draco chooses it.
“Your timing is rubbish,” Harry said, not looking at his face. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
Harry removed his boots and, self conscious in his uniform and socked feet, headed to the reception desk. A book and quill stand had appeared, and he wrote out
already dead, Harry should at least be able to tell her that. If Malfoy's alive, Harry has to bring him out. He just... needs to figure out how to get past the thick press of bodies who will scent magic on him if he gets close enough. He studies the bottleneck of the glass doors for several seconds, breath coming light and quick as he runs several potential scenarios through his mind.
* * *
“Don’t even think about it,” Malfoy said. He turned his face to the side but didn’t loosen the grip of his leg around Harry, didn’t slow those tiny, rhythmic rolls of his hips.
“Do I smell coffee?”
“I rarely think about my tea when I wank,” Harry says.
“Runes?” Pansy suggested, damn her, voice going bright and perky. She was probably determined to pay him back in advance for her oncoming week of having to wear wigs.
They were as he’d last seen, Draco’s wardrobe standing wide open and missing his clothes and travel bag. Pansy pulled a face at the state of the bed, rumpled and unmade, but sat down at the foot of it anyway, looking far more comfortable amongst Draco’s things than Harry appreciated.
fucking. Harry’s cock throbbed a reminder, and as if he could feel it, Malfoy bit his lip, then let it go as though he didn’t want Harry to see.
“You like me cheeky.” Harry’s own flush spilled hot over his cheeks as he saw Draco process that, and realised what he’d said. The presumption of it, the confidence in his own voice. Unwarranted, maybe; Harry didn’t know what was, anymore. He’d made his own feelings clear enough, thought Draco’s were too, to some extent — that he could be so open like this, with Harry of all people.
a way in.
“But Greg—” Harry said. “Greg said some things about—”
Harry actually did recall all of that with Malfoy’s reminder, but he sent Malfoy a blank look anyway. “Sorry,” he said, “I guess I was a little busy defending my right to smell as badly as I want and raising Voldemort from the dead to remember very much.”
“Like this, if you’ll let me,” Harry says simply, and watches the curl of Draco’s smile return. “Exactly like this, for the rest of our lives — and if I’m able, even better, after.”
It might help that he’s got no choice, not with Harry riding his arse the way he is. After as full a breakfast Harry could shovel down Malfoy the first morning here, he’d given Malfoy no time to recover from the weakness of near-starvation, demanding that they do a full circuit of calisthenics almost immediately. Though it took Malfoy almost two hours to get through the first set, he’d gritted his teeth and
“You look like shit.” Draco hugged her back, exhaling when she huffed a shaky laugh against him. It was true enough, but she held onto him, familiar in his arms. It was calming to be able to comfort her in such a way. They seldom showed physical affection anymore, not since their ill-advised attempt at romance had almost ruined things a few years prior; it had been too terrifying to feel that sense of remoteness growing between them after the novelty of sex with his best friend had worn off.
“I— Yes, one moment.” The static increases briefly, disappears. “Still there?”
Draco moans around his cock, cutting the sound off with a sharp whine, the slide of his mouth increasing slightly in speed. His hips, arched high behind him, start a tiny, needy rock, and that’s pleasing too. Harry has to close his eyes against the sudden, blurred sting in them. While there’s still time, he says, “Enough,” the word broken in a strained laugh. Draco draws off his prick, wrapping his fingers around the base to squeeze it tight — thank fuck — and lifts his head, breathing hard. His gaze narrows, one eyebrow hooking up when Harry shoves his glasses to his forehead to rub the moisture from his eyes.
“Just! Potter—!”
Bill took a studying pause. Harry felt the assessment with a curl of shame — after everything his life had been, that anyone might wonder if he could cope. That Bill might, though he wasn’t necessarily wrong; Harry had done his best not to listen anytime someone tried to explain it to him. Then Bill had taken a breath and said, "It will be like a marriage, as far as I can tell. It was written to protect both parties—" he let Harry scoff, then continued, "—in the most general sense, so after you've fulfilled the initial requirements, you won’t have to… as often."
“Good or bad?”
“Because you’re a trendsetter. Whether you want to be or not,” Malfoy said, “and even though whatever’s happened to you in the last few years has turned you into an absolute wreck in front of people. They patronise the clubs you’re— you
Draco Summoned the bottle of whiskey from his cabinet. He tipped a bit more into Harry’s glass. But he didn’t pry and he didn’t answer, pivoting the subject neatly to Teddy’s upcoming birthday, his posture slowly straightening. By the time Harry went home, he’d relegated the conversation to the back of his mind as best he could, where it stayed for months—
"How many this time?"
“Did things too, yeah,” Harry says. “But you’ve—” Harry looks at the fire, feeling scoured raw by what he has to say. “You’ve never hurt me. You might have
Draco tipped him a measured smile. “Thank you.”
“I want to fuck you tonight,” he said, because he did, and because he couldn’t think of anything else to say. “Slow.”
“Thanks so much,” Harry said dourly. “I guess I should have found him a wife while I was at it, too.”

“Okay.”
for more than half his life with the sort of devotion that, fortunately, allowed for new dimensions. And when Draco stirs beside him, Harry finds his voice, rough with sleep though it is.
, a tumble of emotions knotting in his belly, so strong they rivalled terror. He shook his head and brought his hands to the ties at Draco’s waist, fumbling, wordless, and they came undone for him. Draco released Harry’s prick and brushed his hands away, and then divested of his bottoms and underwear on his own, leaving them in a pile next to Harry’s sheet. He was getting hard too, his cock hanging long and heavy over his balls and thickening as Harry watched it. He stepped in close to Harry, sliding an arm around his ribcage to pull their bodies together, his lips grazing Harry’s, then swivelled his hips; a slow grind of prick against prick. Against Harry’s mouth said, “Get in.”
,  how humiliating,” he said, looking delighted by the prospect.
“Whatever you say, Potter,” Malfoy said, the mattress shifting as he got behind Harry. "It's not as if I want your bumbling attentions, anyway. Understand, I'm willing enough to cope with them if it saves my family, but honestly, whoever taught you really ought to pay penance to me for what I'm left with."
“You’re making them want you nearly as much as I do,” Harry said, finally afforded the opportunity to bring Draco a drink when Kingsley got on stage to present his yearly speech.
The first was that it was a nice day, warm with a blue-skied backdrop, the flower stalls they were striding past a chaos of bright, blooming colours. While none of that was so unusual, it was hotter than normal for the start of June; the spicy-sweet scent of the flowers didn’t drift with a breeze but rather seemed to hang in place, confined by the humid lack of movement in the air. And yet Malfoy walked with the collar of his suit jacket flipped up, his shoulders around his ears and his hands shoved deep into his pockets. His face was guarded, eyes continually on the move. It was a look Harry’d recognised from taking victim statements from domestic calls or muggings that had turned violent, a jumpy, paranoid tension in the facial muscles, though Malfoy’s expression was mostly bland, if still a little pissed off.
But there wasn’t, and the days dragged onward. Everyone waited to see what would happen, the flurry of Owls between the Burrow and Malfoy Manor lapsing into eerie silence. The perversity of the contract’s existence was only matched by the penalties woven in for refusal to adhere to it — sharp, glowing runes that brightened the parchment and took days to translate when delinquency came into effect. Runes that threatened the leaching of each of their family’s magical cores.
, dammit.”
“Mm. That sounds right.” Harry’s hand is warm on him, and he squeezes Draco’s hip. “What happens?”
Narcissa ignores the question, directing her words at Hermione. "It's a powerful spell," she says, calm once more. "The magic required for it, however, is quite simple. Even the most base of magical children have been known to manage it, in more certain times. Although it's not," she adds lightly, "as though I don't have some to spare. Pobble, if you please?"
Alright, new plan.
“I don’t believe I ever indicated anything of the kind,” Draco said brusquely. “And you won’t be touching me; I’ll be touching you. Put your shoes down.”
“What the
“Ah.” Draco leaned back against the bed frame, dragging one knee up to his chest. Hooking an arm around his shin, he stared at the half-open window for a minute. A sparrow was peeping at them from the entrance of the bird house, bright-eyed and interested. “I can’t say I planned much beyond shagging every available man in London.”
“Yeah, but on my way to Paris, I saw more of them in populated areas. Some in surrounding suburbs, but… We tend to set up in cities.”
, his stomach smeared with the shiny mess of their climaxes. He levered himself upright, spine straightening. The positioning of his shirt should have made its removal difficult, but Malfoy made even that graceful: a small hook of his fingers, a tug over his head, the material slithering down his arms. He caught Harry’s eyes and bunched up the shirt, then used it to wipe off his stomach, his prick.
“Only—” Harry sighs. There can’t be any help for it; what is he supposed to do, leave Draco alone after what they might have figured out? That wouldn’t be an acceptable solution even if it turns out the Inferi
“Malfoy?”
“They generally stay out of the sunlight,” Potter reminds him quietly, gesturing Draco nearer to his side. “Not always, but…”
“No, you didn’t,” Draco said. She flinched.
* * *
“Fine,” Draco says, continuing to scowl but spreading his legs a little when Potter sneaks a hand under the covers to run it warm up Draco’s thigh.
Some raised, others spreading flat over his skin, a deeper red, weeping sticky fluid from their centres onto Harry’s palm as he pressed it to Malfoy’s chest and found his heartbeat — too fast, erratic. He touched Malfoy’s face and  leaned close. “Malfoy. Can you hear me? Malfoy?” Malfoy’s eyelashes fluttered but his eyes didn’t open. Harry turned back to Kreacher. “How long has he been unconscious?”
“No.” Harry shook his head, revolted at the thought of either of them being a party to what was about to happen. Ron and Hermione stayed blessedly silent.
When he opened his eyes again, he hurt
“Well, I had a question about—” Potter stopped as Pansy suddenly swung the door wide to reveal Draco, cross-legged on her bed. Potter’s eyes grew big, and Pansy really
“Good lord.” Malfoy snorted and pried Harry’s hand off him. “If this is how you behave in front of a few sex trinkets, I pity your spouse even more than I already did.”
It’s not a game, but Harry doesn’t argue. At least Draco is talking. Still, he’s never told anyone that — the papers frequently speculate on when he might have children and what they’ll be like — so he can’t resist asking,  “How did you know?”
Potter’s gaze slid past Draco’s shoulder for a long moment. Without turning, Draco could sense he was looking at his own bed. “Seriously?” Potter asked, voice cracking slightly. “You’d seriously—”
Potter hiccuped a strange laugh and arched his neck back, lifting his arms to dampen the strands of his hair that floated in the wide, rounded bowl like mysterious sea creatures. He scrubbed his scalp, stomach clenching, biceps and opened thighs clenching, neck so exposed that
Malfoy narrows his eyes but gives a stiff nod after a moment, then jerks his chin toward the tent flap. Harry backs out of it, inhaling deeply when the flap falls shut. He listens to the shuffle of movement behind the canvas before pushing up from the ground, brushing the dirt from the knees of his jeans, and makes his way back to the stove. As he stirs the porridge, Ron’s face comes to him, flushed and irritated from an argument that had erupted five years prior, after Harry’d gone off on his own and wound up in St Mungo’s with a shattered femur.
“Maybe I will, and maybe I won’t,” Draco said, hating how sullen he sounded. He cleared his throat and raised an eyebrow. “Maybe you can think of a way to persuade me.”
The whole thing had begun so
“Wasn’t,” Harry confirmed. “I thought, maybe… Kreacher didn’t know where it led, and I thought… Hogwarts has places like that. I thought maybe—” Harry cleared his throat, keeping his voice level. “—maybe the Manor did, too. Maybe you knew about this sort of thing.”
humbled, by life. And that someone like your solicitor friend was moved to help. If she was already helping others by, for instance, smoothing the way for business licenses and applications, and representing them against, well, things, it wouldn’t have to mean much more to include him in the process.” Her voice got increasingly strained as she spoke, and when she stopped, she was breathless.
“Wasn’t exactly warm when I got in,” Draco says. He sits down and drags each article of Potter’s clothing in the water.
Except: Draco only moved when it was over to lift his head and press a kiss against Harry’s sweat-damp temple. Except: Harry curled his fingers deeper into Draco’s hair, and twisted his head to meet that kiss with his mouth.
“Wow.”
"I'm sure that's not true," Draco says after a while. "In fact, I know it's not. Even if your continued existence wasn't a testament to it, I've seen at least five biographies on the market about you that go into unnecessary detail about how much your parents loved you. One of them even has
The first breach should hurt, shouldn't it? You've never been fucked before. Yet your body accepts him, your own, inexplicable slick easing the way, and all you can feel is that same relief his arms promised, his smell. You moan, finally filled, and reach back to grab his clenching arse as he pumps into you. He groans your given name and your dripping erection bounces under you, slaps against your belly and the hem of your shirt.
“So Hermione mentioned,” Harry said. “There’s something we could do about that.”
“You can’t mend most of these, the fabric has been consumed.”
Malfoy could make him laugh. Who would have thought?
“What would you do?” he murmurs to Ron through the gold-and-cream-striped wall in front of him.
have given her a voucher for a photo session, but it requires—”
“Don’t go more than waist deep anyway,” Potter says. “I’m going to check things out. Call me when it’s my turn — quietly, though. I’ll keep close enough to hear.” He sets down his pack and walks further down the shoreline.
“Do them, then,” Harry says.
Draco blinked at him, eyes wide and startled, cheeks still pink from his orgasm. He smiled crookedly, flashing his dimple, then rose with a small, frothy laugh, and turned to hunt for his wand. Finding it, he cast a casual cleaning charm over himself and another one at Harry, pleasant and mild, even as he tucked his prick away. He lifted the fall of his breeches, buttoning them one-handed and setting his shirt to rights, then dropped back into his chair. Harry fumbled his boxers up, his jeans, and stood, a reversal of their positions.
she’d said.
“From what I gathered on Diagon today, he’s to be heavily sanctioned for exploiting the other Aurors’ schedules, at least,” Draco said, the grimace of a smile pulling his mouth. “And yours above all. I did try to point out—”
Drunk with lust, he let Draco urge him back up before Draco had come, and pushed back into him, slower and harder, cracking the plaster of Draco’s wall with the headboard from the force of his thrusts. He curled his fist around Draco’s rigid, spit-wet cock and timed his pulls to the beat of their fuck, gasping when Draco finally came with long, messy spurts between them. Writhing and trembling, Draco cursed and locked his thighs desperately around Harry’s hips when Harry thought to slow. He panted out, “
“What?”
The room spiralled unsteadily around Harry, Malfoy’s words echoing in his head from far away and against the back of Harry’s ear. Harry looked at Malfoy and thought about what it might be like to have Malfoy again, in a bed with room to roll, to reposition, no rush in their give-and-take, Malfoy’s long limbs wrapped around Harry, clinging to him, his mouth hot and open. Not sweet, never that, but… different.
Outside, there was a haze over the morning sun that turned the sky bright. Harry hadn’t paid much attention to the people in the tea shop staring at them but, heading back down to High Street, he felt conspicuous — aware of each head turning to follow his and Malfoy’s progress. Malfoy strolled along looking like he didn’t have a care in the world, pushing Harry’s bike between them.
Harry put his wrist in it. Draco sighed, brow furrowing. He reached into Harry’s jacket and plucked Harry’s wand from the holster hugging his ribcage, giving Harry a distracted frown when Harry inhaled with surprise.
“I keep them in stock,” Draco said, elbowing Potter for the ‘not in love’ bit, even though a little tingle of something he
“It’s fine.” Draco sighed. “Come on, let’s dance before we head to yours.” He led Harry to the dance floor, his long frame invading Harry’s space as they began moving, and this time lowered his voice. “I did,” he said, his cheek against Harry’s. “Read this morning’s letter. Of course I did.”
There are more qualifications in Draco’s rejection than there is rejection itself, and Harry lets himself linger over them for a moment, not sure if he’s ready for the consequences of Draco’s opinion. He chews on his lip and sighs. He tips his head back to see that the sky’s gone shockingly clear; without clouds or electricity, the brilliant swirl of the Milky Way spreads out like a road above him, one close enough to travel on. It seems like something Harry should have noticed before now, but then — he's changed, hasn't he. He's fundamentally different from the man who was able to set himself so rigidly apart when his team started dropping like flies around him. That man never once had to think the most important person in his life could be gone, not really.
“I will
you. He ordered Kreacher not to wake you under any circumstances. He read the contract and ordered Mr Ecutor out! He was trying to— to—”
Draco warded him off with a palm lifted outward, his long fingers splayed. Harry glanced up, saw Draco’s throat work silently above the knot in his cherry red tie.
P.P.P.S. I’m not cleaning the parchment either.
“Twelve hours then,” Draco says, giving him a long, even look. Harry fights the urge to break their gaze. Fights the heat rising in his cheeks. But he doesn’t really regret deciding to retire early, no matter how unwise it may have been. They could have easily covered a few more kilometres before calling a halt, could have perhaps taken the time to find a shelter further off the beaten path. But the last few nights have been such a convenient escape from the press of his thoughts — something Harry hadn’t realised he’d needed so badly. And Draco’s touch that afternoon, sweetly, unconsciously proprietary, had felt like a
In the aftermath, still linked, you turn your head and kiss the line of his throat. Without thinking, you sink your teeth in until he bleeds. It tastes like metal, like seawater, like
* * *
“Mummy?” Rose steps closer, tilting her head, some of the anger fading from her expression. She chews on her lip. “Are you— are you okay?”
“No,” Granger says, her eyes trained rather desperately on the far wall when Narcissa glances up. “
is going on.”
Suddenly off-balance, Hermione gazes up at him blankly, smile frozen on her face. She sees the wash of pink over his cheeks and the widening of his bashful grin as if through a tunnel, and from a distance.
“Prove it,” Harry said, a crack to his voice. Draco chuckled, a sinister sound that had Harry’s erection bobbing, the tip brushing warm, wet tile. Draco’s mouth moved from his ear, teeth scraping over the heated skin on Harry’s jaw, his neck, and then he found the spot again that he seemed to so favour, right at the bend of Harry’s neck and shoulder, that settled ripples of pleasure in Harry’s balls. He worked the spot with his teeth, his tongue, sucking on it hard and then biting down on it, stroking his flannel down, down, a rough, soapy caress to the small of Harry’s back. Harry let his head fall to the side, his hips canting backwards of their own accord to seek the pressure of Draco’s prick.
“No.” Malfoy darts another glance at him. He clears his throat. “She did. Not often. When I was sick as a boy, she’d occasionally make breakfast for me. Fried eggs on toast. On my eleventh birthday she baked my cake.”
Harry knee-walked closer and pressed his cock to the back of Draco’s thigh; he pulled his finger out to the tip and added another. It went in easy with the first, the crinkles of Draco’s rim softening and smoothing around them. Settling his hand over the small of Draco’s back, Harry fucked against his leg and watched his fingers vanish into him, emerge. He was breathing hard, the world spinning around them, a tingle heating around his branded wrist. He twisted his fingers, turning his palm down, and fucked into Draco with short, shallow thrusts — skimming his fingers firmly against the smooth small swell of Draco’s prostate. Wanting to make him feel good, to make him go as mad as he’d sent Harry, humping the back of Draco’s thigh like he’d never fucked before, fumbling for more friction, dying with the need to come. And then coming like a virgin too, so focussed on the swing of Draco’s tightened balls between his thighs and shivering moans, that the first hard pulse of it caught him off guard.
Draco ran his tongue over his teeth, eyes searching Harry’s face. His fingers, having reached the back of Harry’s neck, curled into the strands of Harry’s hair. “We have to sleep sometime,” he said, though they had — several times, little cat naps taken curled around each other before waking to fuck some more. Sex drunk, delirious. Harry was about to point that out, but then, with a touch of regret, Draco said, “And— I’m getting rather sore.”
“So his expectations don’t keep rising. Huh.”
Scattered, bewildered agony rips into Draco as Harry pushes violently to his feet, his chair tipping to the ground behind him. He grabs the mobile and holds it up to his mouth. “
What was worse was how we’d been ending the meetings of late: Potter had taken to walking me back to my rooms and lingering at my door, a curious look to his face like he might say yes to an invitation for a nightcap, and there always seemed to come a tense moment before I closed the door. It was a far cry from the inscrutable glances he used to throw in my direction from his spot at the head table when I first got hired. Frankly, it was unnerving, and I thought it better to nip it in the bud before I did… anything— namely, anything inappropriate that might result in me getting hauled off to Azkaban.
He’d enjoyed it, until he realised exactly how dangerous that could be. Forgetting the world and all of its threats is something he shouldn’t allow, not even for a moment. The problem is, he’s already a different man than he was when he first went to fetch Malfoy at the hotel. Neither does he think he can ever go back to being the Harry he was before this all happened, but it's a worrisome thing to feel closer to that self than before. To feel connected to someone up close. He’s not sure being less able to disengage and look at things clinically is a good thing. Not where they are.
How long have you watched him? Almost longer than you can remember. You’ve never dared to call him a friend, though you’ve begun seeing him so often again over the last couple of years. But your knowledge of him predates that. And he's an Alpha to the core; of the many reasons he's made the papers, his designation status hardly made a blip in the news cycle. It’s Confunded you that you wanted anyway, you could never figure out why. You still only have the bare ghost of an idea as he tongue-fucks your arse and you cry out like a wanton Beta. As you splay and pull up your knees to aid his efforts, and he hums and sucks on your arsehole, massaging your jerking cock with a warm palm.
. Following the creases, Harry tried to remake the crane; failing that, he made a few attempts to fold the parchment into one of the simpler sculptures he’d seen Malfoy make. Defeated, Harry folded it into neat thirds and put it back in his trunk. He had nowhere to send it, anyway.
“What are you doing?” Draco breathed. Harry shrugged, moving away.
His gaze locks with Potter’s, whose face is grave. Urgent. He practically hears Potter’s voice in his head, and without questioning it, Draco runs.
Draco waits a beat, then scrambles after him. It seems to take only seconds before the bluster of wind knocks their tree cover aside to reveal thunderclouds weakly backlit by dawn. The rain soaks him down to the skin as he crashes through the underbrush, pulse kicking in his throat. He can make out the shapes of tree trunks, can vaguely hear Harry ahead of him, but in all other ways he feels lost, the early morning hours and unforgiving storm locking him in a menacing fog — which grows, second by second, as the putrid magics animating the Inferi close thick around him. Outside the tent, Draco can sense them more clearly, somehow knows there are a half-dozen of them, and that they’re stronger than the ones he and Harry have encountered since Paris. He feels the precise moment their lagging brain functions narrow in on the racket he and Harry are making, the precise moment they spot him. Their hunger sinks into Draco like a blade severing his spine; he stumbles, trips, falling to his hands and knees.
“I told you—”
Hermione grimaces with sympathy. The complexities of Pureblood families and their expectations still baffle her sometimes, married into one though she is. “Does she know yet? Your Muggle friend, I mean. That you’re a wizard?”
“Is just my job now,” Harry said, close to his ear. Over the course of the dance, Draco’s hand had slid around to Harry’s back, pressing their bodies together from thigh to chest, the hard length of his prick a tantalising rub against Harry’s hip. “I’d think you, of all people, might take whatever the
Previously tamed to the point of morbidity — a museum of flowers and hedges too frightened to flourish — it now tumbled wild and overgrown, purple foxglove twining amongst the thickets of thorny red roses that climbed the stone boundary wall, bowtruckles scampering along the shoots of the hawthorn tree in the quiet. Stars of jasmine bloomed around the slats of the portico, and honeysuckle up the trellises in the dwindling sunlight, turning the periwinkle air lush with floral spices. It was otherworldly in its beauty, in a way Sirius would have loved.
Harry swallowed the growl teasing the back of his throat. “I want to fuck you.”
“You should eat something more substantial,” Potter says, a bit gruffly.
Gravely, he said, “After everything I’ve done for you, Harry—”
Teddy, lower lip wobbling, nods. Then his damp purple gaze slides over Harry’s shoulder, and he takes a shuddering breath — and begins to cry again.
Malfoy nodded, exhaled. “Blaise, would you
No longer in the languid pose from before, Draco’s posture had straightened; as Harry watched, he uncrossed his legs and planted both feet flat on the floor, thighs parted, a soft flush stealing over his cheeks. Harry exhaled and slid the tail of the belt from the loops at his waist, slowly, one at a time, curling the supple leather back to slip the prong free of the notch. The buckle made a quiet, tinkling sound as Harry dropped the two sides to dangle and popped the button on his trousers. Draco’s gaze was wide, his pupils expanding, and Harry’s heart pounded painfully, an exhilarated drum against his breastbone. He eased down the zipper, let his trousers gape open to reveal his grey boxer-briefs.
Draco’s mouth twitches. Part of him wants to hate the helpless devotion he feels, but he can’t. Harry’s been impossible to resist since Draco looked over and saw him staring through the crowd of dancing bodies. In a lot of ways, since long before. Draco knows that much; he’s certainly tried.
Biology only temporarily hindered the resurgence of Harry’s arousal, the potent burn of it sitting heavy in his chest before the slow thickening of his cock. Wanting it to be about more than that, Harry ignored the latter as he worked his way lower on Draco’s body. Perfumed steam rose around them, smelling of waxy-crisp apples and faintly coloured with their same ripe, peachy blush. Draco twisted to accommodate Harry, spread his legs to let Harry run the soapy cloth between them — twitching a little. He tipped his head back and parted his lips, eyes closed, breathing deep as Harry carefully cleaned the crevice of his arse, his balls, his soft cock, and travelling once again to his arsehole: hidden, secret, warm. He pushed the very tip of his finger in, massaging Draco's rim, watching his lashes flutter, then moved to the creases of groin and thigh. There were flower-dark love bites on Draco’s neck, four of them, and one on his chest, a pretty violet bloom of a thing under his left nipple. Draco lifted his dripping arms from the water, stretched them out along the lip of the tub.
They stop for a few piss breaks, soft drinks running through them, and after the last, Potter points to a copse of thin trees about a kilometre off and says they’ll be setting up for the night. It looks to be a pathetic shelter from detection, but as they get nearer it turns out to have some depth, stretching out further than it seemed to from the road, and as an added bonus, is rife with thorny brambles, each one heavy with wild blackberries and raspberries. The vegetation is chaotic with colour, green and red and rich navy, and as soon as Potter’s sanitised them, Draco and Potter each sling their bags to the rocky floor to stand in place and gorge themselves.
Fuck.
“So can you,” Harry snarled, then added, “You’re not my bloody hostage, Draco, and if you keep trying to martyr yourself on this marriage, one of these days I’m going to let you,” and got up to dress.
“I live near here.” Potter lifted his beer again, his gaze steady on Draco’s face over the rim of his mug, his throat working with long, rhythmic swallows, and Draco said, “How near?”
“If I’m scared of you doing that to me,” Draco murmurs, watching him, “it’s only because you are, too.”
“You’ve got a look on your face.”
) — but Harry’s got no doubt Malfoy cares about Teddy. He’s seen proof of it too many times to pretend otherwise. Has unthinkingly responded to it himself, on more than one occasion; yet another reason he’s not looking forward to this.
It shouldn’t be. For either of them. Fidelity wasn’t a thing they owed one another, not like this, and perhaps neither was faith. But what Draco wasn’t saying felt more profound than the coil of their names etched on Harry’s wrist:
Curious about his own reaction, on one occasion he spent an hour unfolding the crane, fingers careful over parchment the same colour as Malfoy’s skin. He let himself wonder for the first time whether his interpretation of events had been wrong, whether it had been Malfoy taking his cues from Harry, rather than the reverse; he let himself wonder what Malfoy might have done if Harry
“Wilkins,” he barks. Morris Wilkins, the newest member of his team, straightens and tugs his robes into place, wide-eyed but otherwise impressively stoic in the face of Harry’s wrath. Harry glances at the clock and swiftly calculates the time difference; it’ll be almost eight a.m. in  England.
“I’m in it as long as you are,” Harry says. Rather than the relief he expected, he feels a click of certainty, something disjointed slotting into place. “We’ve got time.”
The silence was so lengthy Draco thought Potter might have fallen asleep. Then Potter said, “I still need to pick up a few things.”
“I left a protein bar out for you, too.” Harry turns away, studiously ignoring the baffled look on Malfoy’s face. He turns off the stove and, as it cools, clears the tent of their blanket and his jacket, then cleans out the pot and kettle as best he can with his wand. After a few minutes spent in silence, Malfoy excuses himself, presumably to go pee, and Harry ignores that as well. His shoulder is smarting terribly by the time he goes to fold up the tent, and a tap on his arm makes him grimace with the effort it takes not to say something he’d he'd have to apologise for later. He looks up to see Malfoy holding out three tablets of Paracetamol and shakes his head. “The ones I took last night should be the last. I can't use up our whole supply, we need to save them.”
,” Fearful said, as earnest as a snake could be. “
Harry’s admission makes Malfoy falter for a second, but then he flicks his fingers again. “Give me my damn wand.”
"Who?" Harry says, voice raspy. Cracking. His chest, god, it's sticky with come. His stomach. And there are other smells. All over his hands, all over the room. They tear a whine from his throat. "Who was—? Did I hurt—?"
soaked into something he’s recently touched stirs the beginnings of your own knot, uncomfortably, deep in your pelvis.
He wasn’t, but he seemed to relax at dinner, answering questions when asked, volunteering small asides that didn’t shift the conversation, which Harry and Hermione carried. Ron eyed him narrowly, with suspicion, and interjected with small, probing barbs that Draco either took as his due or had decided not to respond to. And then, midway through the meal, Harry growing more and more tense, Ron simply… stopped. He squinted at Draco, continued squinting through to the trifle Kreacher served, and muttered later to Harry, “Did you do that to him, or did he?” And, grudgingly following Hermione’s example, held out a hand to shake.
Draco leans forward and snaps his fingers in Harry’s line of vision and when Harry blinks and glances up, he’s got a wry slant to his upturned lips.
The fourth and fifth detonations come as the long-unused ladder locks up around the second floor. They’re the furthest away, where Harry left them on the ledge, so the muted effect of them makes sense but their discharge
"What're you waiting for?" Ron said. "I'd like to get my bride," he pointedly elbowed George in the stomach, lips quirking at George's guffaw, "home before New Year's."
It makes him feel like sicking up. Makes him want to stuff his fists against his burning eyes and weep. Makes him want to cut out his own heart so his body can reflect the gaping hole left by her death. But he finds himself nodding, instead — and that's perhaps the most sickening thing of all.
Harry laughed, low and strained, words failing him. He shook his head. “Let’s just… We can forget about it.” He shot Malfoy a weak smile. “But I’m not apologising for getting you up in the middle of the night again.”
“Of course it was a reaction to something else, Potter,” he says. “It was always going to be.” He locks eyes with Harry, his fingers digging into the muscles of Harry’s shoulders, fanned out and tight, his thumbs pressing hard enough against Harry’s collarbone to leave bruises. Despite that, his voice is gentle. “You fool.”
“Fuck me,” Draco said.
excuse for behaving as though I’m going to take away House Points?”
—” His protests were muffled by Draco’s kisses, distracted by the squirm of Draco’s body beneath him, like Draco wanted to climb him, and had decided to try to.
“Yes.” Hermione runs her hand through her hair and twists it up into a messy knot at her nape before realising she’s got nothing to hold it with. Then, to her surprise, Anthony pulls two slender, gold hairpins from the pocket of his robes and holds them out to her. Hermione takes them tentatively. They’re shaped like standard hairpins, only the prongs are a touch longer, and they have an intricate coil of wires resembling flowers at the end of each. “Are these your m—”
Draco tightens his fist experimentally — correctly. “I see,” he says, though, judging by the wary glance he throws Harry, he clearly doesn’t. "Next time I hit you, I'll be sure to remember your advice," he adds, then blinks and glances around them, seeming to remember where they are. He eyes Harry, gaze catching on Harry’s midsection. “You’re bleeding.”
to give you the benefit of the doubt,” she said. “But now you’re holding Harry hostage.”
Malfoy remained silent, stewing as they walked along Diagon Alley. Harry tried to calm down and didn’t push him further. Ever since he’d come out of the shower, Malfoy seemed to be vying for a spot in the World’s Biggest Dickhead Olympics. Gone was the back and forth conversation that Harry’d barely had a chance to acclimate to, the sort that occasionally held a hint of something friendlier, only to be replaced by such a massive reversion to form Harry was tempted to kick him in the shin. Malfoy bit off every word he spoke, openly, cruelly mocked Harry’s choice of attire and attempts to set his hair to rights, quizzed Harry on wizarding customs that only someone who had been raised in a family like his could possibly know, and derided Harry for every wrong answer and perceived transgression over lunch.
It was a phrase Malfoy was apparently fond of, Harry’d learned,
not the one bringing tea and sandwiches to our meetings!”
Every second Malfoy hesitates is another they can’t get back, and Harry’s on the verge of trying the broom again without him when Malfoy gives a tiny shake of his head and climbs the railing with graceful agility. His throat works silently, and he flinches when another scream issues from their room, accompanied by the slow creak of glass cracking, like ice over a frozen lake. Malfoy nods and inhales, lip caught between his teeth, then bends and jumps. His forward-momentum is decent, but the angle is off somehow, and Harry sees it the instant before realisation hits Malfoy’s face. He scrambles forward and reaches out even as Malfoy’s long torso hits the railing with a bone-jarring force. Malfoy falls, hands frantic as they slide against the iron, and Harry barely feels Malfoy’s straining forearms in his sweaty palms until he almost drops him. He adjusts and tightens his grip, the railing buckling slightly when Malfoy’s weight propels Harry into it and his fall jerks to a heavy stop, his wrists in Harry’s hands.
Wearing his glasses again.
The Betas you're paired with are fine. They enjoy the fuck and don't want anything serious; they can take your occasional knot with enough lube. It all works out nicely. You rotate through two or three a year and never even growl when you smell another Alpha on them. It's more satisfying than wanking, but not dissimilar. Sometimes you date other men, sometimes you shag them. Wizards outside type-coding.
"Wait," he mutters, "Draco,
,” Harry ordered. His lungs loosened when she snapped her mouth shut and slumped back into Ron’s chest, Ron’s arms coming around her torso to hold her close. They all inhaled simultaneously; the muscles in Harry’s legs felt weak. “God. I’m sorry. I didn’t— understand.”
Potter had come to
“Why did Draco leave?” Harry asked immediately.
* * *
weaker to Draco — inside. He gives up trying to force the ladder into submission and turns just in time for Harry’s approach. Harry’s complexion is pasty, his forehead damp.
Harry nodded, unsurprised. Barnaby was reading the bottom of his marriage contract, making swift little check-marks on a legal pad with his quill. Harry breathed in, out. He met Hermione’s eyes. “Did you think he had a way to keep me from you indefinitely? That I’d ever let him? We’ve got,
of course — and shushed her so loudly that several people glanced over. “What? No!”
“Oh,” Draco says. Because he’d known, of course, that it was, but not that Potter smiling that way and saying something so mundane would be the thing that made Draco realise he'd at some point fallen in love with the arsehole. He blinks. “Thanks.”
Draco’s voice ran a constant loop in Harry’s head, and he checked his watch. Technically, he was already twenty minutes late — though he was starting to wonder if it might be better to ignore Draco’s thirty-minute rule than be found hiding behind the embarrassing marble statue of himself at the age of seventeen outside the ministry’s atrium. He peeked inside once more, watching the Floo for any telltale glint of white-blond hair, but with each minute that passed, the ever-increasing crowd further blocked his line of sight until he could only make out the elegant arrangements of flutterby and baby’s breath that rested on the mantelpiece.
“That you’d deny it,” Pansy said.
Placing his hands flat on the sill on either side of him, Draco leaned forward. “What do I have to do to get you to leave?”
“No,” Harry says slowly. “We’ll figure it out eventually, and until then I think it’s about time we
Draco kissed the knobs at the top of Harry’s spine. Lifted his head again.
Malfoy pressed his lips together and finally nodded, but said, “You should put them in a trunk if you’ve no plans on wearing them.”
They kissed for a long time, so long that Draco’s lips started feeling swollen and chafed, the skin around his mouth over-sensitive from the stubble on Potter’s cheeks. His neck felt bruised and his cock ached, but he didn’t want to stop, didn’t even want to
Ron snorted. “Sorry, you’re on your own there. Too stressful.”
There
Ron made a disgruntled sound and folded his arms across his chest. “What’s the problem this time?”
“Which I know is true,” Draco agrees dumbly. He blinks, a quick flutter of pale lashes. “And now things have changed. All it took was five minutes.”
She outlines their discussion briefly, and Minerva nods with interest, drumming her fingertips contemplatively against her desktop when Hermione’s done. “I see. Would they be testing it on themselves?”
Breathing shallowly, Draco searched Harry’s face; his lips curved in a small, contained smile. He reached up and tweaked Harry’s glasses, the pad of his thumb guiding the bridge higher on Harry’s nose, and he said, “I might almost feel sorry for him, losing your regard, if he’d been remotely worthy of it. He wasn’t.”
feet.  He balled his hands up and leaned back further against his work station, his cock, already half-hard, lengthening a little more in his trousers.
” Her eyes were gentle. “Then just promise me you’ll be careful.”
“I know,” Draco said briefly, and swung the door inwards — smoothly, the parlour opening to them as though Harry had never put wards in place to keep them closed.
“Come
“I didn’t mind. I keep trying to talk to you at these things anyway,” Potter said, dropping
Draco’s voice cracked; he pulled away. Harry forced his eyes open and got to witness the storm of anxiety in Draco’s gaze, the deterioration of his ever-present composure, as Draco snapped off orders, then elbowed aside his supervisor when the man tried to replace Draco’s position at his shoulder.
Potter rushes inside, boots and other articles tumbling from his own grip. He twists and re-latches the lock, facing away from Draco and backing up until Draco is pinned against the wall.
“I know. I saw you see.” Bill’s fingertips brushed his knee, moved away. “I liked that you saw.” He sat back, at ease even with the flush that made his scars stand out in stark relief. Relaxed as he ever was, smile curving beautifully wider. “For what it’s worth, Harry— it’s not a surprise to me.”
I rolled onto my back, letting the soft pop of the fire and the tick of my antique clock calm me, and drowsiness returned. The creak of an elf tending to my laundry or the lamps in my room sounded, and I yawned. Other than the Manor, this was the only place where the ambient sounds had ever brought me such comfort.
“Hello,” Granger says calmly, taking a seat. “Comfortable?”
Opening his eyes, he says, “Ron pulled a face at all of them, making noises about how stupid it was, and then he grabbed me and sort of,” he makes an illustrative motion with his arms, “dipped me like we were dancing, and kissed me.”
“What did she mean by that?” Draco asked at dessert, not specifying as he dolloped his custard atop itself with his spoon.
Potter grunts. “Just enough time so I’m not tripping around in the dark. Find a place to put up the tent,” he says. He rubs his palms against his jeans, gathers a few things from his bag, and walks off. His gaze remains averted the whole time.
,” Potter says, a stutter of dawning horror to his expression, quick as a blink; there, then gone. “How have you been
“I wanked four times today,” Draco lied smoothly. Merlin to Christ, he’d been getting hard nine times a day since he was thirteen and, what, now he was
Reeling, Harry asked, “What would happen if you signed? Would you be able to get out?”
Malfoy snorted. Harry heard the rustle of papers, and then Malfoy was lowering himself next to Harry and trapping Harry’s wand against the metal frame of the bicycle with his own. “Well, I don’t want you to ruin my bicycle with your ineptitude.”
You're at work. You feel off, worse than you have all weekend, and your weekend was absolute shit. You're clammy, overheated, restless. Your skin seems to have shrunk two sizes, and you can smell
” Draco asks, a slight edge creeping into the question.
“It’s my turn,” Draco says. There’s something subtly different about his posture that Harry can’t quite put his finger on, but Draco’s face is completely at ease — the genuine sort he rarely displays — so Harry's not going to question his luck. Draco pushes his foot against Harry a little harder and says, “You think I’d end it while you have the advantage?”
“I don’t like them,” Harry said. He looked at Draco, at the mole on the back of his neck, his scar — little, tender things, in such a tender place — and ran his tongue over his teeth, thinking. “Or… I liked them too much, for the first few months. After.”
And then the air gets sucked out of the space between them, the buildings around them shaking and the ground pitching hard, as an explosion rocks them off their feet.
The splashes from Potter’s hopping little half-dance go quiet, and Draco looks up to find him staring at his clothing. “Thanks,” he repeats. “You didn’t have to, but…”
Potter sighs and stands up, dusting his knees off, and it occurs to Draco that Potter’s already got his jacket on, has already fit himself into his sling. He flicks Draco a slightly challenging glance when he sees him notice. Draco knows he should object — Potter’s shoulder will heal faster if it’s wrapped securely, hard to do one-handed — but the idea of being close enough to Potter to touch his skin makes his stomach lurch.
“I do.” Harry nudges his knee again, just because he likes touching him. “You don’t.”
“I…” Harry twisted slightly to look at him. The muscles of Draco’s face had gone subtly tense, and the last of Harry’s jangling nerves quieted inside him. “Yeah. Ron said something about… Yeah. I know.”
“Which you could have asked me to do,” he says pointedly. And, alright, that’s fair. To a point. Harry loads up the tray with their bowls and leftover coffee to gather his thoughts, but before they’re in enough order to respond, Draco clears his throat. “Although that’s not what I meant.”
“I need to be able to focus,” Potter says, taking a long pull of air. “If we’re—” His voice sounds odd. Muted. Like he’s both forcing himself to speak and trying not to. “I won’t be able to.”
“You didn’t really—”
Malfoy flicks his gaze to Harry and lets out a low, shuddering breath. He curls his lower body up from the waist, gripping Harry tight for leverage. It makes him swing slightly, hitting the bottom of the terrace with his hips, and weight pulling on Harry’s arms increases. Harry clamps his jaw shut and watches Malfoy edge one foot up, toe-ing it carefully onto the sculpted edge of stone, inch by inch. When all but the heel of his shoe is on it, he pushes up with his leg. Harry takes small steps back to haul him up, not loosening his hold even when Malfoy’s got both feet up, not until Malfoy slings his legs over the railing and slides to safety.
Harry looked down reflexively. Saw with astonishment that, as devastating and arousing as kissing Draco had been, his pants were no tighter than they’d been before he stripped; none of what he’d felt
“You were
Harry sighs and Summons the remote, passing it over. Draco hums with satisfaction and settles his head a little deeper into Harry’s lap, short locks of his blond-and-purple hair strewn over Harry’s flies. They’ve both gotten good at ignoring any accidental biological responses, and Draco gives no indication of even noticing Harry’s slowly hardening cock, except to push his skull back against it with a grunt as he blinks blearily at the telly and tries to get situated.
“Yeah, I—” Harry takes another breath. He shakes his head, a wan smile crossing his face. “Yeah.” He loosens the curl of the warm, gloved fingers biting too hard into Draco’s wrist, and guides him to the lip of the building, silent for a minute as Draco studies their route.
“Then
“You should see the prices on said specialty attire,” Draco said, shaking his head with a look of admiration. “Initially, that was all they were going to do, but then Greg had a customer ask for a new cloak for a ball, and another who asked if he knew anything about Muggle-wear. Blaise is fairly selective about the clients Greg gets, though, likes to assess them first.”
“Potter doesn’t like cauliflower, Kreacher, please remove that,” he said, with a dismissive glance at Harry’s plate. “Merlin, I miss flying, too,” he said, breathing heavy after his spend when he caught Harry looking out at the sky. “Not avoiding me, are you?” he asked with a smirk — when they both knew damned well Harry had been — before pushing Harry to the library chaise and necking with him for an hour.
Harry didn’t. He kissed Malfoy hard instead, breathing into it — committing to memory what little time they had left.
It made him smile around Draco's girth, and he peeked up to find Draco staring down at him with a look of such furious need on his face, Harry’s amusement vanished. He dropped his gaze and picked up the pace again, fisting his own dick roughly and bobbing his head over Draco’s cock, fucking his own throat with it, driven on by each of Draco’s breathless moans — and one of his own vibrating through him when Draco’s hands landed on Harry’s hair to clench there repetitively, hips faltering. Harry let Draco guide his head, losing rhythm but gaining speed, his saliva dripping down Draco’s shaft as Draco started moving with him again. And then Draco pushed Harry’s head down, holding him there with a tight, gusted, “
From his periphery, he saw the excessive dip of Malfoy’s Adam’s apple. Malfoy said, “Your, uh, charmwork isn’t totally worthless, but,” he took a breath and shook his head; his voice went cool, if a little strained, “unless you’ve got something metal to Transfigure, you should stop for today. Honestly, Potter; they taught the basic physics of fusion magics back in fourth year. Have you forgotten everything you learned?
Harry caught him around the ribs with his forearm and gripped one of Malfoy’s narrow hips, needing something to hold onto as he sank in. The pause of penetration, once he was back inside, seemed inconsequential; he was as near to climax as he’d been before. He rocked his hips, a clumsy, juddering fuck, and Malfoy’s back flexed against his chest, his undershirt bunching as he turned and lifted a hand to grab Harry’s hair, twisting his neck to fit his lips against Harry’s, twice as rough. Malfoy met him thrust for thrust, feeding gravelly, snapped-off grunts into Harry’s mouth, then grabbed Harry’s hand and guided it to his prick. Startled, Harry hesitated only a second before wrapping his fingers around it and stroking. Malfoy’s cock was hot against his palm, almost as wet as he was on the inside, foreskin gliding smoothly over the flare of the crown as Harry wanked him — still fucking him with fast, heavy rolls of his hips, the tension spiralling between them, about to break.
And if she doesn’t get the chance to rescind her instructions to Harry, neither will Rose.
Now, he just thanks gods he doesn't believe in for her natural preparedness.
Harry snorted and kissed his neck. He could hear the muted strains of music and chatter from down the hall, Kingsley’s speech having ended at some point. “Do you have any idea how little I care?”
Hermione had given Harry a hard, worried look when he told her about their plans, but refused to comment on their arrangement. Ron, however, had pulled him aside and shocked Harry by only saying, “You sure about this? Malfoy, 24/7?”
— to try anything like that. And it hadn’t been this bad in years; it had to be the working with him that was damaging my psyche. It had got to the point where I almost preferred the dreams where he slashed me to ribbons, or never returned for me in the Room of Hidden Things, the dreams where I was wasting away in Azkaban. Healthy, Draco.
“Northwest,” Harry whispers, lips brushing the shell of his ear. The contrast of warmth against the icy dread working its way through Draco’s chest makes him tremble. Harry presses his mouth even tighter, his words dropping to barely a breath. “Run northwest along the road, and don’t stop running.” He waits for Draco to nod. “If we get separated, stop outside the next town on our route. If I’m not there by sunset, assume I’m gone—” Draco jerks back, but Harry catches his hand uncompromisingly and pulls him close again, “—and call Hermione at the designated time. One of the phones is in your bag, and some of the beads too. Now get out your wand.”
But this time Harry’d been insistent over Draco's protestations, eyeing the dilapidated house — obviously deserted long before the siege — before declaring he wanted to check it out.
“And things would have been different,” Draco says, narrowing his eyes.
It was a dozen of them, really. Draco said, “Been with a lot of them, then?”
“He’s not the sort of arsehole he used to be,” Harry said.
is right here, and that’s all Harry needs, really.
Neither of them move for a moment.
She skirted around Potter in the doorway, then paused and turned with a small frown. “Actually, maybe you should let Draco use them on you, the first time. He had to show me,” she said, flicking her fingers distractedly when Draco and Potter sputtered at the same time. “There’s a whole… process. See you.”
Then Draco breaths,
“I got your wand,” Potter said quietly, still not looking at him. He turned around and dipped his hair under the blast from the shower nozzle to soak it. He reached up and ran his hands through it a few times, unconcerned that he was just standing there, naked, his cock thick and flushed though it was softening, his bollocks pink and smattered with dark hair. Potter opened his eyes and shot Draco a questioning look through his dripping glasses, then pointed down.
“Whatever,” Draco said. Potter was staring at him, eyes opening and closing with the unhurried speed of someone on the brink of sleep. Draco wanted to shake him awake and watch him go to sleep, wanted to make him confess about the gifts and wanted to live in the lie for as long as he could.
, and
Well muscled, lean, the outline of his calf plumping just enough under the material of his bottoms that Harry could make it out. Harry had the sudden urge to run his tongue along that arch, to mouth at Malfoy’s ankle, to follow up the line of his calf—
Alarmed, Draco jerks to his feet. “Harry. Harry, stop.” The room is spinning around him, but he ventures forward a step and, when he doesn't fall, tentatively reaches out. Rests his hand on Harry’s arm. “You’ve got to stop or they’ll feel it,” Draco murmurs. Harry twitches, jaw set, and shakes his head. Draco glances at the window, where the wails of the Inferi are growing louder. The floor of the room shakes. With a hard gulp of air, Draco says, "Please. They’ll kill us."
“I don’t suppose you mind if I cut in?” They broke apart at Audrina Shacklebolt’s voice, Draco taking a liberal step back and immediately relinquishing Harry’s hand over to her. Her wide, open smile turned a bit tentative, and she glanced back and forth between them. “If you were ready to—”
him," Hermione breathes.
Harry, as if to lay hands on a talisman that might bring them luck, he didn’t even try to convince Draco to come home with him, it left him so unsettled.
Draco truly hates his friends sometimes.
Draco nods. He’s got on a thick green, terry dressing gown, knotted securely at the waist. “A bit,” he says. He eases onto one of the stools at the small island in the middle of the kitchen, taking the coffee Harry slides across it in both hands, then hesitates before taking a sip. “How many were there?”
Malfoy’s lips parted, just barely. He was going to say no, of course; they’d used each other twice already over the course of the day. But Harry waited, a surge of something powerful ripping through his system at— at having
“Wandless,” Draco says tiredly. After his attempts at Apparition had knocked him unconscious and made those creatures scrape frantically at his door, he’d been forced to rely on the few small, wandless charms that he'd mastered to keep going — freshening charms when the room smelled too much of death,
, but there’s enough of a resemblance that he can’t make himself move, and her filmy eyes are locked on him as though Potter isn’t even there. Draco hears Potter say something at his side, and then the woman is moving, picking up speed, and Potter’s hand is gone from Draco’s chest. The woman rushes toward them, toward Draco, and the voice he’d thought might have vanished in the explosion speaks sharply in his ear, “
Malfoy went a deep, outraged red and, with a frustrated kick at a rock in his way, Harry started to turn back to the scrubby little bramble he’d been stripping of scurvy grass. But before he got half a step, Malfoy threw his basket to the ground and stalked over, grabbing Harry’s shirt to haul him into a deep, biting kiss. Tearing away when Harry began kissing him back, Malfoy stared at him, eyes burning, lips twisting into a scowl. “I
“Oh,” Harry said, bemused and aware he was utterly failing at not openly gaping. “If it was an accident, I guess—”
But he spied Weasley sitting with Granger on the large sofa near the fireplace, and with a sigh, Draco released Potter’s hand and said, “I need a second.”
you to—”
“Yeah.” Draco grinned; Pansy’s performance had been pretty splendid. “She meant her letter, though.”
Dumbly, Harry absorbs the proposition. There’s a line that exists between the urgent mingling of magic, for emergency’s sake, and doing it deliberately, to simplify things — there must be. Harry glances up from Draco’s closed hand, a ‘no’ on the tip of his tongue, but Draco’s expression stops him; he’s gone almost preternaturally still but for his bobbing Adam’s apple, his face set in cynical lines. It’s clear which answer he expects.
“Then why the look.”
“Draco!” I heard him blow out a breath. “Are you having a panic attack or just being a complete wanker?”
, but the truth is, he was just
“I’m not—” Harry breathed, trying to get his bearings. “Good. Yeah. Felt it in my cock.”
“I read about that one,” Malfoy said with a smirk. “Not one of your finer moments, but it did amuse.”
unasked questions, whether
“I can’t believe he signed it,” Hermione said again, for the dozenth time. Under her breath, dazed, not listening to Barnaby as he went over the contracts. “He just signed it.”
“Not like yourself,” he said evenly. “Is this making you feel better?”
A curious blush lit Malfoy’s cheeks, even as he scoffed. “For,” his fingers twitched dismissively, “standard activities.”
a big deal, and almost all kids
So Harry waited, like he sensed Draco was waiting too. He didn’t know what they waited for, but sometimes it was the only thing you could do, no matter how impatient you were.
Harry stared at him, gobsmacked. “Please come back to the department. I’ll pay you out of my own vaults.”
for awhile — Draco shrugged and turned to go. Pansy caught his arm.
“The problem,” Hermione said, taking her own plate and sitting between them. “It’s Harry.”
Malfoy glances from Harry’s face to Teddy’s and back, frowning just a touch. “I hope that’s alright, Potter.”
“Yes, okay,” Draco says, and willingly allows Potter to take him apart.
“I’m not sure. Some days we make more headway than others,” Harry says, ignoring the way Draco hovers at his side. “Another ten days. Maybe twelve. We have to be more circumspect than I'd like, even avoiding populated areas and cutting through the land.”
Harry closed he box and set it aside. After a moment, Ron cleared the roughness from his throat and Hermione discreetly wiped her eyes, and Harry stood.
“That’s the one thing you
.” Pansy’s deadpan was as loud as a shriek in Draco’s private room at St Mungo’s. “You and Potter— You two— Draco, you
“Indoors,” Draco says, glancing around. “I’d almost forgotten what that felt like.”
—” Draco couldn’t withhold a shiver, and Potter’s hands on him tightened, “—and… And for making you think I’d— I wouldn’t. The list only made me… It made me
“No,” Harry said, though Draco had stated Harry’s trust in Andromeda as a fact. “She won’t.”
to,” Hermione corrected with a little cry of frustration. She flew across the room, her cloud of hair whipping behind her, and hugged him. Harry patted her and looked at Ron over her shoulder.
Harry’s done well spiriting them through increasingly populated areas to Coquelles and finding them shelter every night; the office they’ve holed up in is the best place yet. Nine levels up, it's got a private, if dated, loo, as well as a heavy locking door between them and the empty, open office space beyond — which is also locked. Most importantly, the office has a fire escape ladder out each of the windows, their legs pulled well out of reach from the Inferi below, which he and Harry will use to escape via the roof when it’s time to go. But as grateful as Draco is for the walls surrounding them, their protections only go so far.
