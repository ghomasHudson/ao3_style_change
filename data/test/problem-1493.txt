‘The rain will have to stop eventually,’ Draco shrugged. It most likely wouldn’t.
‘At least there’d be straw on the floor,’ he said, toeing the cold stone.
‘I wasn’t aware there’d be so many answers, though,’ said Draco, ‘Who knew you were all so well versed in sex.’
‘Don’t be such a prude, then,’ Draco smirked, flicking one of the nubs again to make him hiss. ‘Say it.’
And he’d ruined it.
him - made Draco shudder. He did reckon, though, from a practical view, that any blowjob he’d give in that state would be subpar. Enthusiasm would only get him so far, after all. He set out to undo Harry’s jeans and tug them midtigh, then the same with his underwear. Harry’s dick bobbed up unceremoniously, flushed a lovely red, urgent and begging for attention. Draco very primly kept his hands on Harry’s hips.
‘No,’ Draco snorted. ‘I just thought you should know I bloody
‘Alright. We’ll come down.’
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
‘About time,’ Pansy rolled her eyes. She looked terribly bored.
'Yours too,' Harry said next. This time, Draco stilled his hand again.
Harry shook his head, biting away a smile. ‘It’s not that interesting a story. Besides, isn’t it my turn to ask a question?’
‘Malfoy,’ Harry moaned, clutching Draco’s shoulders.
‘Did you get it at the Great Hall?’
Simply the lingering tendrils of music and the wind.
They huddled at the bar and ordered a butterbeer to share, leaning against the dark wooden frame as they watched the group catch up with Hagrid. It was one of those moments where Draco didn't belong - one of those photographs that could never include him, could never hope to remember him in the future.
‘You’re fussing.’
‘You’re not serious.’
'Well, we did fuck on the table.'
'No. I simply think it was rude of him, is all.'
Then again, just like Harry had said, the last time he’d had such a thought Harry had ended up in the infirmary.
Harry’s gaze settled on him, curious, but Draco didn’t look away from Granger.
‘That’s the bloody stupidest question you’ve ever asked,’ he breathed out, pulling him into another kiss. Slower than before, no less firm. Harry giggled against his lips, trying to suppress the sound, and enlaced his neck. He felt euphoric, having Harry in his arms like this, gentle in the beginnings of heat, intimate and hushed and without the urgent worry of being interrupted - this, he thought, was how it would feel if they were in a real relationship.
‘Fuck off, Malfoy.’
‘Because it’s bloody awful,’ Draco drawled.
Offensive bright lights were reflected on the wet cobblestone in front of the Three Broomsticks. They faded and blended and changed from hues of green, to red, to yellow, to blue. It was dreadfully on the nose and ridiculously childish, as Draco knew it would be, and there were yells already audible from the street, and everyone would undoubtedly be drunk and
, that Harry
But Harry didn’t seem to agree. Instead, he drew one of those smirks of his, all irresistible darkness and ruthless tease, and asked:
Harry, on his part, had raised his eyebrows with a wry expression
to look ridiculous.’
'You shouldn't come,' Draco mused. He tapped his second finger against the red, puffy rim to watch it flutter.
He handed Harry the stupid bag, and started towards the door. Harry’s voice, somewhat rushed, as if he’d spoken on impulse, made him pause midway.
'Blaise,' Draco sighed, his fingers flexing on Harry's hip. 'You've never been one to ask stupid questions.'
‘Because it’d be a shame for us to get this far only for you to see me cry. We’d have to break it all off, then.’
‘Of course it is,’ Harry huffed a little laugh, though his concern didn’t ebb. ‘Can you walk? Maybe you ought to go back, Hermione and Neville are going anyway.’
‘A bit of a hassle to carry, no?’ he asked, leaning against the frame of the shelf.
‘You know, one would think they’d taste better as hearts.’
He tried to sound at least somewhat lighthearted in his next suggestion:
Not that he much minded it. There were fewer things lovelier to picture than his fingers sweetly wrapped around Harry’s pale throat.
,’ Draco huffed. He really did hate the word. Ron seemed to hate it more.
Harry’s eyes flashed darker, but it was Ron who spoke, ‘Don’t call her that, Malfoy.’
‘See, I want to make at least
‘What’d you say it was?’ Harry spoke at last.
Draco scoffed. ‘That’s for him to find out, isn’t it? That is, if you’ll actually let me pass before he’s discharged.’
'Ever gotten your cock sucked?' he asked as he worked on shrugging Harry's jeans and underwear down, just to make sure, just to hear Potter
Pansy gave him a look before turning to face the two Gryffindors.
‘Were you here for a shot? Make it two, then,’ Finnigan went on, placing his elbows on the bartop. He looked at Draco expectantly; his gaze caught almost disinterestedly on his bloodied hand and mouth.
‘And the nightmares?’ Draco frowned.
'I'm going to get some air,' he told Pansy, downing the rest of his drink before standing.
Draco hummed his agreement and then, emboldened, flicked his tongue into the hole, lips sucking at the rim. It was hot, insanely so, and the thought of how it would feel around his cock had him moaning into it. Harry's entire body shivered at the vibrations. Draco explored further, deeper, his tongue plunging inside repeatedly, getting Harry accustomed to it. It ought to feel strange, having a tongue be the first thing breaching his arsehole - wet, short and warm, twitching muscle licking into him. A finger would feel much different, a cock even more. Would Harry not like it? But he seemed to like it now, slowly rocking into it, his breath heavy and intoxicating,. He was
Really, he didn't know why he still shared anything with her.
time, mind you - not that I’m your house elf.’
His smile was slow and curious; he probably expected some mildly amusing truth, something quick to move on from. Draco wanted to provide him that. Wanted to make him laugh with something innocently awkward. But he thought about it, looked back at the moment they were all gathered in the Tapestry Corridor, and there’d been only one reason he’d gone, one reason that made him the one who’d spoken first, broken the circle and volunteered. He hadn’t wanted to do it - it was, like Harry had said, a fucking
Harry bucked helplessly against Draco, chasing the orgasm he'd been denied, that had left his eyes red and his entire body trembling. Draco pressed his hips further onto the wall, hoping his fingers would dig little bruises over the pelvic bone, something purple and red Harry could remember him by. It was difficult, however, to keep Harry relatively still - Draco had sped up his rhythm even more, turning it into something filthy and loud with the sounds of saliva, and Harry was thrashing, biting his lip, fingers twisted viciously in Draco's hair like he was half-decided to pull him off and escape the overwhelming stimulation.
Harry idly stirred his tea, the little spoon clinking against the mug.
‘I didn’t want to be obvious,’ she answered and, bringing her hand to her hair, pulling just slightly, with an utterly indifferent look on her face, she detached her head from her neck - not completely, no, a little inch of muscle connected chin to neck, but the rest was cut off bone and dark-blooded flesh, only the slightest glint betraying the Charm. ‘Nearly Headless Nick is as much Gryffindor as gold and scarlet.’
'Not a fan of pacing yourself?' he asked, shifting so he was with his back to the line of girls, a wall between them and Potter, so that only he could see the boy's smiles and rosy cheeks, because sometimes it was ridiculously too tempting to pretend like he had any right in doing things like that.
In front of the door to the infirmary, to his greatest displeasure, Granger was speaking to the nurse. He didn’t even consider going back, since it’d struck him now that his dear Harry was beyond that wall, and it maddened him not to know how injured he’d been, how serious it was, if he was still laughing, if he was in too much pain; but it made him stutter his pace, halt with a squid of his shoe on the stone, and Hermione’s eyes snapped from the woman to him, narrowing into the eeriest little slits.
‘That boring little Ravenclaw again?’ Draco scoffed. ‘That poor soul is the most unoriginal - oh, for Merlin’s sake, Blaise, help the poor boy out before he rips his sleeves off - anyway, she’s unoriginal, is what I meant to say. Just look at her bloody name.’
Draco gingerly placed the Bouncing Bulb back in the dirt. It burrowed down with a contented shiver.
Draco snorted. He had the preposterous urge to cry. ‘You bloody well could.’
‘Everyone.’
Harry left, robes swirling black and thick around them, walking out into the dark night. Draco followed as well, joining the little group - and it was the strangest thing, for a smile seemed to be lurking an atom away from his lips, resisting the urge to break free, hanging always behind his skin; like the moment he dared smile this hesitant happiness within him would be obvious, and the universe would notice and sweep it - and everything that had caused it - far from his reach.
‘What do you plan to do with it?’
- he sucked another one on Harry's other cheek, then trailed down the cleft with his tongue, steadying Harry's hip when he instinctively flinched away.
Harry had teased, after all. He ought to know Draco would have no problems embarrassing him a bit, if only to feel him writhe so endearingly against his side.
It still hurt, however. Especially now. Everyone else glowed with optimism for their new lives after the war. It was contagious, and Draco found himself unwittingly hoping for change in a fact that had been set in stone years ago: Potter didn't want anything to do with him, and never would.
Goyle grumbled, ‘Like the prick can die.’
‘See, was it so hard to guess?’ Finnigan taunted. The shots were poured. They handed some knuts to the bartender; someone to Draco’s right shoved him, and Draco was flattened against Finnigan’s side. He’d never been as close to the boy before - this boy with sticky arms and a loose tongue, dragging Harry to the dance floor, calling him ‘doll’ with that unashamed twinkle in his eye.
To his surprise, however, Harry simply laid his head back on Draco’s chest with a sigh.
then he didn’t see any objections. In truth, he found a dark sense of pride in having other people know he could turn fierce, glorious, perfect Harry Potter into putty under his touch.
‘When you do - if you do - tell them I’ll come along. Better yet, don’t tell them. I’ll come all the same.’
Harry rolled his eyes, though it was half-hearted and he was stretching his neck to try and inch closer to Draco. 'I could compliment you
Harry sighed, and Draco turned to pin Blaise with a heated stare.
The name - the first time he’d heard it from Harry, he believed - was enough to vanish his smile. In its place, open and reverent and so vulnerable that it trembled in the wind, remained only the purest form of love.
‘Oy!’ Neville shouted. His voice was ill-suited for that type of thing; too soft to properly cut through the tension. ‘Ease off, mates. Where’s this coming from?’

The tone - the bloody
Harry huffed while he searched for the right vial.
‘What? You’re not even playing.’
‘I like them.’
The table shook with laughter, and Weasley coloured from head to toe.
together - surely Harry ought to feel it too.
told anyone?’ Harry snapped back. The potion had gone neon pink - past its point. Draco didn’t feel much inclined to take it off the flame.
‘Absolutely.’
But her anger didn’t mean Draco was wrong - because Hermione was trying to lecture him about love like he was some inconvenient beginner, but he wasn’t; he’d loved faithfully and devotedly for over seven years, and he knew what he was talking about.
She walked away across the short grass. With a glare, Ron trailed after her.
‘I’d call it a lot of things before I called it smart.’
Ron, when he spotted them, contorted in his chair and raised his glass to Harry.
Harry bristled. He lowered his gaze back to the ground, as if looking for the Snitch again. He looked a lot less friendly, and something in Draco went tight and panicked.
‘Thanks for the tarts, mate,’ Harry called out before he reached the door.
‘How do you not like rum?’
The potion swished in the cauldron as Harry moved it away from the flame and back to the desk. A whiplash of sugar as he fluttered past - then, cold empty air. The moment dissolved. A second after, Draco followed.
‘Are you sure?’
‘Alright, love, just- just hold on another second.’
‘What was that for?’ Draco asked.
‘I love this desk,' Harry giggled as Draco kissed his nose.
‘Don’t be fucking dense, Malfoy.’
‘Yes, alright. Just… don’t make a scene, Malfoy.’
‘Playing?’
thought of Harry perched on that sink, legs spread so nicely to fit Draco between them, thighs trembling against Draco’s hips. He trailed a hand to Harry’s lower back, just an inch too low for innocent - two inches, maybe three, because he’d drunk too much, and control was already fickle in sobriety - and used it to start coaxing Harry through the crowd and towards the narrow stairs.
‘-how long I’ve wanted to be able to say I
Harry huffed a surprised laugh. They both primly ignored the pair of groans coming from the door.
’ Harry rolled his eyes, but he was suppressing a smile. ‘I have Quidditch practice, think fast.’
There was a chorus of grumbles, and Sue was smug as everyone except for Fletchley - how dreadfully boring of him - drank.
Harry laughed against his lips, a joyful little thing, arms winding around his neck to pull him closer.
Harry didn't - he sat at the foot of it, legs dangling, and looked up at him with ill-hidden impatience.
(See the end of the chapter for
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
Harry's gaze darkened a little at that, but he pushed the spike of arousal down, setting his jaw and stepping away.
They formed a small wave as they shrugged. Below them, in the pitch, the players were doing half-hearted lunges.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it any further. He finished his first tart and moved on to the second one with equal hunger. In the descending silence, Draco scrambled for words. He found himself speechless, this close to Harry, sitting in the same bed as him, like some fumbling preteen wanting to hold hands, which was just incomprehensible - hadn’t he had his fingers in Harry’s hair less than twelve hours ago? His moans in his mouth, his body shaking against his, he’d swallowed him unashamedly. How could this innocence - completely platonic, nothing at all - bother him now?
bed, amidst the covers he slept under, his head propped on
He couldn't even smile at Potter's friends.
‘Oh, you’re hilarious,’ Draco’s tone was dry, but he couldn’t suppress a chuckle. ‘Potter, will you do me a favour?’
‘He’ll live,’ Harry snorted. He finally went down that last step. ‘Come on, before someone interrupts us again.’
work,' Harry said after the brief, blissful silence. He chuckled, an erratic, disbelieving little thing, and his hands finally slipped from Draco's hair to run through his own. 'I don't know if I can walk.'
The shots were being poured in a row of shining glasses, countless elbows resting impatiently on the bartop. Ron scratched his nose, confused for a moment, before his eyes focused on Pansy.
Ron remembered, and now, with a punch of nausea deep inside him, so did Draco.
Harry huffed a laugh. ‘No. It’s just… Where the fuck is my desk?’
'So?' Harry asked, drawing a little smile like he was modeling the colour. 'How does it look?'
Harry gave him a pointed look, withdrawing his good arm from under the covers to wave a hand around absently. Draco was briefly distracted by the vision of smooth, pale skin - there were bruises there. One near his bony elbow had gone an obscene black. Draco thought back to the previous night, his fingers digging into Harry’s hips while he writhed so prettily... had he made bruises then? Small red circles to decorate the spots of skin he’d kissed so sweetly? Were Harry to undress now, would he be able to trace those marks, or would they now be lost under bigger, darker ones?
- Harry’s side was rigid now, tense, his arms crossed around himself as if to dispel the notion that one of them had once been linked with Draco’s, and his eyes surveyed the cramped bar from under furrowed brows.
how often Draco had dreamt of kissing him, the millions of times he'd envisioned it and architected it with the hopefulness of a child, like he could wish it into existence. And perhaps he had
‘Oh, sod off,’ Harry laughed. ‘We should talk about this better, shouldn’t we?’
‘I swear, Pansy, if you’re planning on dragging me to the infirmary…’ he gritted through clenched teeth, pointedly looking away from Longbottom and Finnigan, whose expressions were quite hostile as they followed him out the classroom with their still tired, still bloodshot gaze. Just the notion of seeing Harry’s fierce, restless spirit confined to the minimalistic antiseptic white of that place filled him with rage; and the thought of seeing the damage he’d caused, of then asking for forgiveness, the likely possibility that Harry would
Dean Thomas’s brain eventually catched up with his tongue. ‘Not that- you know. It was- odd, but he didn’t know. He’d have told us if he knew. Don’t tell Slughorn, is what I mean. He’ll get all suspicious for no reason.’
“Jamie Cadogan?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it, mate.”
“Let’s get back in there.”
It doesn’t take long to levitate the prisoners and let Hestia and Williamson know what’s happened, and that they’ll come home as soon as Draco’s up for it. A few minutes later, they’re alone.
“No, Ronald!”
He probably should. The whole day’s been a fucking disaster. Savage didn’t really shout, she just looked at him in a very disappointed way that made him squirm, and then asked some horrifyingly embarrassing questions. The meeting took about half an hour, but it felt more like decades.
Draco turns his arm over, careful to only touch the less-burned patches of skin, and starts undoing the cuff. Harry curses the stupid design of his shirt. All those buttons! What is it with wizard wear and buttons? He should have done what he usually does and thrown on a t-shirt, but this morning in front of the mirror, it had seemed like a good idea to look somewhat presentable.
“Do I need to wake up Hermione?”
“Yes. She’s in her office. She says it’s urgent.”
Hermione rolls her notes up and puts her quill down. “We should get back to Rosie, but I’ll keep working on the lists. Are you ready Ron?” She turns her far too knowing eyes on Harry.  “Do you want to walk with us, or are you going to Floo?”
The three of them are sitting in Ron and Hermione’s cosy kitchen, warming their hands on steaming mugs of tea and nibbling on Ron’s home baked biscuits. The photo is on the table between them, and Hermione is tracing the drawing with a finger.
“The Blood-Replenishing Potion worked wonders. And I’ll take something for the pain before we leave. I’d really rather just go home.”
“What do you want me to do?”
“Will there be anything else, Master Draco?” The elf looks at Draco through pale, bulbous eyes.
“Mr Nathaniel Brigg, are you related to John Brigg, also known as Bludger?”
“Right.”
Before he’s even considered what to do, he feels the sickening lurch of being Side-Along Apparated with no warning. They end up behind a rock formation just off the edge of the garden they just left.
Draco leads him past the quiet hall into a different wing. Things are darker here. The corridors are lit by torches that flare up when they come near them and die out behind them. As far as Harry can tell, it’s as pristine as the rest of the Manor, but the air is cold and clammy, and there’s a musty smell, like this part of the house isn’t in regular use. In fact, the atmosphere here is much more like he remembers Malfoy Manor from before. A portrait of a haughty looking blond, dressed in something that looks suspiciously like a less moth-eaten version of Ron’s old dress robes, is glaring at them as they pass. Harry can’t help a shiver running down his spine, and suddenly he’s very glad that Hermione isn’t here. Her memories of this place are even worse than his.
“Harry!” Ron’s eyes widen comically, when Harry steps closer. “Bloody hell, mate! You look like shit.”
“No trouble, Aurors. I hope you find my brother, before he causes any more harm.”
“You mean because I’m also slightly messy and not that big?”
“Shut up, Ron. He’s running the Stonehenge excavations. His thesis about the magical symbols of Henge monuments was published in both Muggle and magical journals, and he’s been with the Magical Heritage Foundation for three years now. Draco is really good at what he does.”
“I don’t think Apparating is a good idea right now,” Harry mumbles.
Voldemort stands up, and Nagini slithers to his side. Lucius remains kneeling, but bows his head almost to the ground.
“That sounds like a reasonable plan. I should stop by the Manor and let Mother know about our trip. You should be able to reach me there.” The look he gives Harry is half challenge, half resignation. “The password for the Floo wards is ‘Martin Miggs’.”
He’s barely landed in the huge fireplace in the reception, before the smell of hospital permeates the air and intensifies his post-Floo nausea. He’s hated the smell ever since the end of the war. It reminds him of too many visits at the bedsides of friends and Order members; some had made it out of here, and some hadn’t.
Malfoy chokes on his Firewhiskey, and Harry’s smile turns into a full blown grin that he hides in his drink. He drains his glass and smirks at Malfoy over the rim of his empty tumbler.
“How’s the Unspeakable thing going anyway?” He grins at Ron and raises his glass in a silent toast. “Can I ask her about it, or is she going to Obliviate me just for talking about it?”
Does he? Harry’s not really sure. Hermione’s Draco’s friend, and she’s probably more than willing to help… but she’s also really grumpy when she doesn’t get her sleep. Then again... perhaps a grumpy Unspeakabe is exactly what they need.
“Right…”
“They went inside.” He buries his head in his book again, but adds, “You’re welcome to wait here, if you want.”
"Fuck! Aguamenti!"
Hermione turns soft, brown eyes on him and holds his gaze. “Yes. He’s actually a very pleasant person to work with.” She turns back to Ron and her eyes go hard. “He has grown up since Hogwarts.” She collects the empty containers and gets up to throw them away.
“Still a wanker,” Ron mutters.
“Do you think you can do it on your own, or should I ask Savage to bring in a curse-breaker?” Harry asks.
His boots clatter so loudly on the stone floor that he wakes the snoring receptionist. She sends him a nasty scowl, but he hardly notices, as he walks past the fountain of the Magical Brethren. As soon as he’s out of the Atrium, he breaks into a full on run. He almost barrels into Donovan on the stairs.
Oh. Fucking Malfoy and his sharp tongue.
When he pops back into the cell a few minutes later, Brigg is obviously nervous. Ron, on the other hand, looks perfectly calm and collected, sitting back with his legs crossed, polishing an invisible speck from the shiny boot resting against his thigh. harry puts the vial of potion on the table in front of him. Ron grins.
“No, Ma’am. You don’t. Do I still have permission to have Hermione and Draco help me with the case? On an... erm… consulting level?”
Donovan smirks. “Going to gloat a bit at your old school rival? Can’t say I blame you. That Malfoy’s a stuck up little faggot.”
“You look so at home here,” Harry says. Fuck. Nervous chatting is not what they need right now. There must be something wrong with his head as well as his ankle. But Draco just smiles a little wistfully.
When Harry wakes, there’s a dull midday light spilling into his bedroom. He doesn’t usually sleep this late, but after yesterday, he was sort of expecting it. When he peeks at the alarm clock on the windowsill that doubles as a bedside table, there’s a very familiar barn owl perched on the ledge outside. Groaning, he swaddles himself in the duvet and lets it in.
Bludger laughs. “You do that. I’m not finding your bits for you, if you Splinch yourself by tripping in your shoelace.”
“Twin sister, yes. Adrienne Wright.”
“How can you say that?” he asks. “That last memory. He only put it there to remind Potter why he shouldn’t be working with me. And the rest of it? Completely trivial. What the fuck am I supposed to do with a memory of him reading books and being tortured?”
“Right. I’ll do that… I’ll stop by tomorrow, yeah?”
“Fine. He says he’ll be ready to go home soon.”
“Yes, Auror Potter. You may involve them in a strictly academic capacity. No field work. Do you understand?”
“I… Yes. Yes, I trust you with the information. And of course I can keep a secret! As long as it’s not something illegal. I don’t particularly want to be fired,” he adds.
Harry nods dumbly. That small smile is still playing around Draco’s lips, and his hair is falling into his eyes. He looks so open, and he really wants to say something profound. Something to acknowledge the gift Draco is giving him by sharing this bit of his past. But nothing comes to mind, except stupid things like ‘I want to kiss you’ and ‘I think I’m falling for you. Badly.’ So he keeps his mouth shut.
Three guards are waiting for them at the gate. Life in Azkaban is hard, even if you’re only there for an eight hour shift. The men look hardened and rough. They swipe Harry with a casual charm and when they don’t find anything suspicious, he’s allowed to step through. He takes a few steps towards the building, before he realises that Malfoy isn’t with him, and turns back. Malfoy is standing with his front against a wall, his palms resting on the bricks, and his his feet apart. Two guards are searching him manually, padding at his pockets and manhandling him into whichever position will give them better access. A third guard is casting a barrage of detection charms on him. Malfoy’s mouth is a grim line, and there are two angry red spots on his cheeks. It’s several minutes before they’re satisfied that Malfoy doesn’t pose a threat and let him pass the gate.
"The Dark Magic. Don't you feel it?"
“Hermione was brilliant! We thought we were going to need you to try and revive your Parseltongue skills for the snakey bits. But Hermione managed with a Translation Charm instead. The incantation was really complicated and it was written in some kind of code, so she had to translate it as she went along. But she did it! I can do magic again!”
“Yes. You should. I think I have to go home instead.”
“Potter and I are working together.”
“Oh. Right.”
Harry grins back, and a fraction of the weight that’s been lodged inside his chest these past few days lifts.
Ron narrows his eyes. He stands up, places his hands flat on the table and leans towards Howards. “Veritaserum!” he hisses.
“Tell me again, Mr. Howard,” Ron is saying. “Are you, or do you know anyone who is affiliated with an organisation called the New Dawn.”
Yes. What about the cup? He should hand it over to the Ministry, like he’s supposed to. The Department of Mysteries are probably itching to start examining it. But something makes him hesitate. Percy has been a good Minister for Magic in many ways, but still... He realises that he’s rubbing his thumb across the thin, white scars on the back of his hand, and stops. Giving an overbearing arse like Percy that much power is... unsettling.
“Hah! This time they almost had you,” Tall Bloke grins. Harry joins in, and gets a kick in the leg from Bludger for his trouble.
“Potter.”
A cold gust of air alerts him to the fact that he's alone. He opens his eyes, and finds Draco sitting at the edge of the bed, illuminated by a beam of light from the landing. A cold blanket of disappointment settles in his guts.
Harry looks up and finds Bludger staring at him, with his wand still in his hand.
Oh, great. He can feel a blush creeping into his cheeks at the mention of his mishap. Hopefully the club is too dark for it to be noticeable.
Ron holds out the open bag and Harry slowly levitates the note inside.
He turns back and looks into searching grey eyes.
“There were two toothbrushes by the sink, and I heard what he said, when I came back from the loo. A bit odd having a Tornadoes scarf lying about, if you don’t like Quidditch.”
Instead, Harry makes his way carefully across the wooden beams that support the stands, until he spots mainly blue jerseys above his head. He pauses for a moment, just long enough for an invisible hand to brush his shoulder to let him know that Draco and Hermione are behind him. Then he starts for the stairs. He makes it all the way up the stairs and into the stands, before Bludger and Tornadoes Shirt notice him. Harry looks around. That nickname won’t do for the extremely tall bloke anymore. Everyone around them is wearing Tornadoes shirts.
“I’m sorry. It wasn’t my decision to make.”
“Hermione hasn’t told you?”
“Good to see you up and about, mate!” He gives Ron a quick, one armed hug and a slap on the back.
“Yes. Sure.”
Malfoy’s surprise only shows for a fraction of a second. Then he schools his features back into a neutral expression and nods.
“What? The same place? Exactly how dense are they?”
“Have you considered that that might actually be the right thing to do?” Hermione asks. “Ron’s right, Harry. You can’t go alone.” She turns to Ron. “And don’t even think about going with him! Not without your magic!”
“We’re experienced enough to deal with something like this on our own. It's not like they're real Death Eaters!”
“I’m at work,” he says in place of a greeting, and Harry can’t really help smiling back.
“Oui.” The elf nods so vigorously, her ears flop against her bony head. “Fifi can do that.”
Tobby nods and flicks his hand, and the shirt disappears. A second later, so does the elf.
Malfoy doesn’t look like he’ll be fine. He looks more like he’ll crumble into a heap, if he’s left alone. Is that what he wants? To be left alone so Harry won’t see him falling apart? So no one sees him falling apart?
He’s dressed and Flooing to the Ministry by seven thirty the next morning, ready to dive back into the piles of background checks and follow-ups strewn across his desk. He hesitates in the lobby.  There’s an almost physical force pulling him towards the holding cells. But Savage made it clear yesterday that there is to be absolutely no ‘sullying the good name of the Auror department by fraternizing with a suspect’. His insides twist up painfully at the thought. It might be days–weeks even–before he sees Draco again. He forces his leaden legs to move towards the DMLE instead.
“Find it. Bring it to me. This is your last chance of earning my forgiveness. If you do not bring me the cup, your weakness and cowardice will be punished.”
“Yeah. D’you think Hermione would know? We need to ask her about the spell for the books anyway.”
Hermione puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes it lightly. “Please, Harry. Ron’s going to be fine! Just…” She turns to Draco. “Get his leg fixed and keep him from doing something stupid,” she adds. Then she’s gone and the door closes with a gentle click.
Draco puts a hand on her shoulder, and squeezes gently.
Ron is walking a little more securely in his heels this time, and Harry has to walk quickly under the cloak to keep up with him. When they slip into the Beheaded Goblin, and Bludger smiles and pats the empty stool next to him in invitation. He even goes as far as buying Ron a pint. Ron bats long black eyelashes at him, tosses back a curtain of dark hair and dimples prettily. He even puts a hand on Bludger’s shoulder and leans in to whisper something in his ear. Bludger’s eyes immediately drop to Ron’s cleavage. Harry shudders and flattens himself against the wall, waiting for Ron to get some useful information so they can get out of here. It takes forever. Or at least long enough for Harry’s foot to start cramping. But, finally, one of Bludger’s mates gets up from his seat and says goodbye.
“Prote-”
“Yeah, I remember.”
“Thanks, Hermione.”
“Damn it! Stay awake, Draco! Please!”
“At least Draco’s Weasley is quite handsome. Nice broad shoulders...” The witch sends Ron a rather lascivious look and a wink. Hermione grabs Ron’s hand.
Ron starts walking towards the Floo without another word, and Harry hurries to follow him.
“I’ll see if the Pensieve is available.Maybe we can save a trip back to the crime scene.”
“I… Look, I know I’ve said it before, and I know you don’t want to hear it, but I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have barged in there like that. It was such a stupid mistake to make.”
They gather around the basin and join hands. Ron makes sure to stand between Harry and Hermione. He’s getting along with Draco cordially enough, but apparently their ceasefire doesn’t extend to holding hands.
And fuck, that tone is enough to turn him into a puddle of goo. The answering smile tugs at his lips before he even makes a conscious effort. It’s ridiculous, really, the way he is falling so bloody hard for someone he used to… strongly dislike.
"Of course, no one can blame you if you just happen to be at the right place at the right time, while you scout out the premises..."
“I saw. Let’s get out of here. You think George will let us use the Floo?”
“Our house is on the east side of the village square, right next to the fountain.” He points at something behind the trees on the square.
“Don’t worry. We’ll sort it out. Can you seal the house, so they can’t Disapparate?”
He can hear Fifi letting Hestia and Williamson in. Draco’s words echo in his mind. It has too great a potential for evil. He makes sure Matt and Bludger aren’t watching. The he hurriedly shrinks the cup and  wraps it up in his handkerchief. It feels heavy in his hand, and he’s almost afraid to touch it, despite the protective fabric. He stuffs it deep into his pocket, and focusses on his colleagues, who are being shown into the dining room.
Draco laughs. Harry looks up at him, startled, and meets soft, happy, grey eyes.
Finally, Draco looks up.
Harry smiles.
If they’re bickering like this, things can’t be too bad, Harry thinks. It’s such a relief that Ron seems okay that he’s almost forgotten about Draco. Almost. There’s still a small knot of something lodged behind his solar plexus.
“Please!”
"Yeah. Sure."
“Never ‘eard of it.” Howard spits a piece of chewed nail onto the table in front of him. Ron is out of his chair and in his face in an instant.
“Thanks.” Hermione sends him a small smile. “Do you have the cloak?”
“Did you know about them after they took place?”
"For fucks sake, Potter! Your arm? I can't heal it through your shirt, you know!"
“We should try to track down Howard and have a chat with him.”
The notebook doesn't look like much. It's small, bound in smooth, black leather, with the initials LM stamped in gold in the bottom right corner. It's exactly the kind of thing Lucius Malfoy would own, Harry thinks. Tasteful, and yet obscenely expensive and obnoxiously in-your-face about it. He reaches out to take it from its hiding place.
to exclude him, but it didn’t mean he was special, or valued, or
He buckled his belt himself while Draco helped adjust his shirt into some sorry echo of appropriate.
‘How I love you, Potter.’
Pansy gave him a clear look of reproval.
‘I look like shit, Seamus.’
Harry bit his lip to stop from grinning, and stood himself so Draco could slide out. Draco turned, meaning to hand out some half-hearted complaint, but Harry had already plastered himself to Ron’s side, in Draco’s old seat, immersed in the game.
Pansy, when he risked a glance, seemed actually cross.
Draco huffed a laugh. ‘Do you mean that?’
His heart still clutched impossibly tight, however, when he remembered Harry crashing on the ground.
It was a mess of ghostly white shifting between the black velvet draperies that lined the tall walls. The glossy black candles on the chandelier bathed the dungeon in gentle light, dim like a dream, casting chilly shadows by the corners. They crossed the threshold - their presence rippled through the air, and dozens of ghostly eyes settled on them. Placid curiosity, a second of it, and then the chatting resumed, thick and unintelligible, the type of incomprehensible cacophony that brings about the feeling that a great party is going on, and that one is incredibly late for it, and that one now has no hopes of fitting in.
Harry's laugh sounded on the edge of delirious. 'I'll compliment you when you- fuck, when you let me-' he trailed off to try and buck his hips up again with a frustrated huff. It was as good as words, in any sense.
leave?’
that,' Draco snapped, batting her hand away from his hair. When he looked up at her, she was smirking.
A lovely plan, in theory. Lovely in practice too, except impossible. Because Draco had quickly discovered that acting regretful was difficult; sincere or not, it wounded his pride. It was unbearable, the thought of showing his remorse so meekly; and it was coded into his mind, being cold.
Draco snorted around a piece of fresh clementine. ‘We haven’t gotten there yet.’
He hadn't forgotten, but he'd convinced himself that maybe it would be alright - that Pansy herself might, amidst the whirlwind of her life, not have given it a second thought. That Friday would trudge along as uneventful as ever, and that he'd retire to the Slytherin's common room at dusk not to hear the excited laughter of all the students taking the night train to Hogsmeade. No distractions, no pathetic fantasies: he'd stay in and finish his Transfiguration homework before going to bed.
Harry breathed out, slipping one hand between them to try and unbutton Draco’s slacks. ‘Malfoy, please.’
Besides, there was something delicious in seeing Harry squirm with the same lust that had cursed him for years. In a sense, it was only fair.
‘D’you know I’ve been here before? For Nearly Headless Nick’s Deathday party.’
Harry snorted. ‘You could say that. But I haven’t been here in years. I didn’t even know they hosted other parties here. And this… at the Deathday party, the banquet tables were in the center. Now, they’re all pushed close to the walls. And our clothes… this is a dance, isn’t it?’
‘Then I’ll find it again.’
innocent. And, with that thought, how could Draco not smile?
? Love him, I mean.’
‘Oh, I can tell,’ Draco snorted. Harry’s skin was a whole new level of sickly pale, after all. ‘Perhaps we should stay clear of alcohol for a few nights.’
It would be incredibly easy now to say yes. So easy, so
‘We had a bloody door that night.’
twat had never required more than bravery and loyalty. But, should he ever want more, those eager, adoring eyes would be prompt to help.
'They've been in there a long time,' Harry said, almost a complaint, like they were extending their welcome, like those miserable minutes would have been enough to properly shag someone.
Harry went a little tense at that, kissed a little harder, stepped backwards to sit on the stained ceramic - lucky, that Harry had that reaction, since Draco had gone a little weak with it as well, a little breathless as the endearment spilled unbidden from his lips. But Harry
Draco laughed as well, exclusively because of the neon liquid. He felt sour inside. Shaken by danger that had never been. He ran a gentle hand up and down Harry’s back and tried to keep his voice some semblance of steady when he spoke.
Pansy was already standing, a little smirk in her lips. By the pinch he got on his neck, Draco figured he was meant to follow her.
Harry nodded a bit absently, let out a quickly fading chuckle and leaned down to lick experimentally along the length. He looked
’Didn’t Hermione show you the head thing? It’s wicked,’ Harry snapped the lid of the red glitter, sliding the bright flames across his skin. ‘Who do you think wins?'
, all the more because it was Harry bloody Potter, because Draco had loved him for years and now he was here, kneeling, drooling over his cock and unashamedly wanton for it, and the symbiosis of sight and sensation was making his legs shake, his orgasm near pathetically fast. ‘Fucking beautiful, Potter, fuck- Merlin, you’re perfect, I-’ I love you, he meant to say, but the sound was strangled at the top of his throat, pushed sourly down, leaving him painfully vulnerable - and Harry looked up at him, all questioning eyes, so soft and
'Stranger than that.'
Harry huffed a laugh. Over his shoulder, Draco could see Hermione’s and Ron’s spinning backs, their pace brisk as they exited the Great Hall - tired of waiting, Draco assumed; through the corner of his eye, still subtle and unsure, McGonagall’s eyes still seemed fixed on them; and closer, right where Draco could see them, a handful of students sitting at the tables had given up their lunch to gape at them instead. So many pairs of eyes deeming them true and solid - it really was for the best, since Draco, when he was the only one seeing, still had a hard time believing it.
It was incredibly infuriating, kissing Harry with a split lip. It brought to it an inherent sense of violence that clashed with the gentle moonbeams - it hurt independently of how he moved, pulsed whenever he tried to deepen it, threatened to reopen with each brush of skin. Draco did his best, in any sense. The pain, as petty and high-pitched as it was, didn’t drown the surge of joy at kissing Harry; that emotion controlled him, as did the instinctive wish to meet the rhythm Harry was setting up, all growing urgency and sure softness and thrilling
‘Is this your first House Party, Draco?’ Luna asked. She was feeding her ghost raven peanuts. They disappeared somewhere between its beak and the translucent line of its throat.
And Harry looked
‘Because I don’t
'Do we know if The Chosen One likes men?'
- except for the old Slytherins, it seemed. How disgraceful of the Chosen one to keep such a closed mind, honestly; to listen to stereotypes, to simply assume that none of them had changed, that none of them could be repentant, desperate to make amends, to shake his hand, to even hold it…
‘Do you think he likes her?’ came Neville’s voice, unmistakably pensive. He was standing behind the sofa, fiddling with the sleeves of his old coat. It was awfully similar to the way Pike had fussed with his robes back at the common room. For the first time that night, Harry wasn’t plastered to his side.
‘Malfoy, do you-’
And he hadn’t sat next to them. Under the bleak daylight, inside Hogwarts’s walls, it didn’t work like that. Hungover,
‘Well, given as we have broomsticks and everything, I’d wager we’re here to sweep the pitch,’ Ron said. Harry laughed - and that little sound, heard from up close now, was so telling in its insomniac hysteria. Draco pointedly ignored Ron, who was sniggering, and focused on him.
‘I don’t pay for everything,’ Harry huffed; but his features softened into something self-conscious when Draco just stared at him with an expectant gaze. Then, he frowned. ‘How’d you know, anyhow?’
‘When have I led you to believe that was an option?’
'How nice to see you,' she smiled, tone full of faux warmth.
Harry grumbled something, hopelessly adorable in his frustration - hadn’t Draco called him adorable last night? had Harry liked it? would he blush all pink and pretty if Draco told him again? - before heading for the smaller cauldrons. Draco took a steadying breath: he would have liked to forego all pretense of subtlety and push Harry against a wall - he had teased, after all -, but the prick did need to learn the bloody potion and, judging by his reluctant pace, Draco would clearly have to be responsible for the both of them.
‘He’s-’ Dean glanced back at the crowd. ‘We think he broke his arm. We’ll get him to the nurse. It’s fine, we- we had to wrap up the game before Potions anyway.’
again: did Finnigan call him that when they were alone? He’d never called him that before, when they were surrounded by friends - Draco had never
‘I think so.’
Everyone stared at the helmet still in Ron’s hand. Draco was beginning to regret his decision.
‘Will you say please then, too?’ he teased, tone pitched low with hunger. The vision formed before him so perfectly: Harry panting with his legs spread, burning and wet - so wet, because Draco would open him up slowly, carefully, memorizing every filthy sound from the lube on his fingers and Harry’s hole. Harry begging so sweetly, trusting him so completely, a lion choosing not to bite but to be bitten, to relish in the bruises, to wait until the pain spiralled into pleasure. And Harry convulsing around him; moaning in the crook of his neck, thighs shivering, hot and tight and all for him. Draco would make it so good, an unforgettable first time, the fucking best Harry would ever have. Years to come and they might be apart, but Harry would fuck and remember how he himself had taken it so sweetly; be fucked and remember Draco’s hips pistoning into him.
Harry’s smirk was wicked. ‘Oh yeah? Then show me.’
I can't believe that next Wednesday we finish the fic!
And Draco swung his head to stare at Pansy, and in her eyes - for but a millisecond - was the most telltale warmth of fondness.
him, then Draco would cherish it better than anyone else.
‘Fancy a chat, Granger?’
Harry shrugged. ‘You said we should kiss in front of the school once, remember?’
- seemed absurd. Draco’s laugh rose higher. A little after, Harry’s followed suit.
The question was curtly accusatory: there was no doubt there, only the frustration of something unconfirmed, and it’d be in his instinct to lie - always was, whenever questions sounded too much like interrogations, because that’s what he’d been
‘Yes. I reckon Ron isn’t, though.’
Draco turned to look at her. There was something in the way she was observing him that unsettled him. He looked away again. ‘I hardly think you should be chitchatting on the field.’

; but Harry liked him
Harry’s eyes went very round. The music began again - with it, he laughed.
'I'm sorry?'
They joined their teams. Draco summoned his broom and shedded his coat on the grass. Back with the others, Ron gave a surprised huff.
'You could have asked him out on a date.'
‘I’ve hardly seen you all day,’ Harry said as Draco led him away with a hand on his elbow.
Draco dug his heel sharply into Blaise’s lean thigh. ‘Unless you want me dead, you’ll be glad I’m choosing not to play. I’m not going to practice, Harper; you’re lead seeker.’
dull Ravenclaw friend.
Harry huffed. ‘You’re such a bloody child-’
It made it feel like the dancefloor was just for them. Like they were alone in the dark hall, swaying to the music.
They went, Draco primly resisting the urge to look back at Harry from over his shoulder as he headed to the bar. There was only one stool empty: Pansy took it, crossing her legs, and Draco leaned on the bartop to her left.
'What've you done with the young Weasley? I mean, I already know you're a virgin,' Draco saw Harry's little expression of embarrassment, and he went on with a smirk, 'Which is perfectly fine, but it makes me wonder how far you want to
‘Well,
‘Well, you don’t look half bad.’
‘I’m impressed,’ Draco said. He meant it - there was something horrifyingly fascinating about the little bloody fibers dangling from the ragged edges of her skin. She placed her head back atop her neck carefully, and the skin sutured seamlessly. ‘Granger. Hermione. I want to apologize.’
‘Get off, I was bloody waiting for those-’
And she was off through one of the stone archways, no doubt heading to the Great Hall to tell her friends what a beast Draco -
‘Would you get too smug,’ Harry started, ‘if I said that you feel bloody huge?’
It wasn’t red currant this time. Sweeter. Sue, who was half laying down, her short hair scattered across the armrest, chortled.
‘No. I mean, yes- I don’t care, is what I mean,’ Harry sighed. ‘Ginny and I - everyone knew. Everyone
‘You’re a cruel woman,’ he said, though his eyes were unwittingly fond, and he took two big sips of the crimson alcohol.
Pansy laughed, which Draco admitted was quite justified. He truly was pitiful in how predictable his concerns were.
‘Well, it ought to just be weaker now it’s burnt. Shall we taste it and see?’ Harry craned his neck to look up at him. The beginnings of a joke, devious and dangerous, were twinkling in his eyes.
The problem with Harry Potter was that he was always
e point.
‘You had
Draco smirked. ‘They’ve always been like that. You’ve always known that, so why are you here?’
Surprisingly enough, they didn’t head to any more bars. Instead, they went down a winding path that cut between the snow and stretched between the pine trees towards the black silhouette of the Shrieking Shack. The sounds of the village were replaced by the wisps of wind through thin branches and twigs and the occasional hoot of an owl.
'He's friends with all genders, yes.'
After he forced himself to drink a bit more of the wretched liquid, he turned the keys on the small lock. It opened with a smooth click, a straightforward swing of the door inwards. The space was small, cramped, lined with shelves from floor to ceiling. The smell, likely nauseating to some, of conserves and dust and old brews, felt comforting to Draco.
‘Good, because you’re the only one allowed to fuck it up.’
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
Because it felt more and more like a dream now, as the days went past. The first morning, yes, with an awful headache, a turbulent stomach and an eyesight that spun black each time he stood, he’d had no choice but to remember the previous night in each vivid, gruesome,
And he’d said it to tease, the twat, all lighthearted and wicked, like he genuinely didn’t know what those words would do, like he didn’t know Draco would melt at that. But Draco’s breath caught, so dreadfully obvious, so impossibly delirious, because Harry remembered - not just a drunken musing, nor a passing joke, not an idea regretted and discarded. It had lingered in his mind, maybe not a serious suggestion, nothing of the sort, but surely as something. A notion to be explored or teased or asked about - regardless, not to be forgotten. And wasn’t that so entirely hopeful? So ridiculously pink and sweet, conjuring all sorts of domestic dreams in Draco’s head? Wasn’t that perfect?’
Now, he sat in that booth.
It was difficult, in all truth. Worse, since Draco's mind kept drifting with the urge to push Harry - Harry, who was standing so obediently, hand still in the crook of his elbow, eyes steady and mouth parted for him - against one of the moth-eaten black curtains, covering his body with his, whispering in his ear just how fucking precious, how fucking irresistible he looked. He did finish, regardless, applying the scarlet just a little beyond the pink curves of Harry's lips to get smoother lines. When he finally inched away to look at his work, he felt hot all over, and Harry's lips looked obscenely plump.
hadn’t told him. He wanted this gap empty. Draco was hopeless to oblige.
‘You’re not the best at pretense, are you?’ Draco drawled. He shoved his hands in his pockets. Ron fiddled with the small pair of pruning shears he held in his.
him and want nothing more to do with him made him nauseous.
He considered changing shirts, was halfway through sliding off it before he changed his mind, sat in the common room until everyone had turned in and the flames had gone out and passed the time by watching the lazily swirling waters of the lake. When the hour approached, he gingerly walked out, making sure the entrance morphed to smooth stone once more before heading down to the Potions classroom.
'Because I couldn't very well tell him I loved him to his bloody face, could I?' Draco snapped - and when the shock paled Pansy's features, he very promptly ignored it. Moreover, he slid his hand from under her now limp fingers and fetched the glass.
'Your mouth can do much better things than drinking.’
don’t kiss and tell.’
‘Sorry, mate, came in through the Quidditch cave,’ he said. When he finally looked up at Draco, his eyes brightened. ‘Hey.’
Draco really did try not to smile. He didn’t want to seem lewd, wanted to preserve the warmth and intermittent sweetness of the night - but it hadn’t been intermittent, had it? Throughout the whole night there’d been something sugary in the air. Tenderness and a devoted notion of frailty. He’d cling to that in the innocence of the morning, and the filthier visions - Harry whimpering as he flicked his little nipples, the way his lips had glistened with his come, the desperate wet patch in his underwear - would be dug out in the privacy of his canopy bed.
'Then you know what I want you to say now, don't you, Harry? Come on, love, I've wanted you to for so long. Say my name.'
‘But what you told me in the infirmary. That was already true?’
if you were going to be an arse-’
There were spiderwebs everywhere; the moonlight was distilled through the cracked glass of the windows, bathing the dusty furniture in a gentle white. A chandelier hung perilously over the grand piano.
‘Honestly, I don’t know,’ Harry answered, looking up to give him a self-conscious smile, ‘Sorry, mate.’
‘Fuck, okay,’ he breathed, shifting a little on his feet before swallowing him as far as he could go, almost immediately starting to gag but holding him there all the same with little breaths through his nose, an edge to his gaze, stubborn and fierce and wanton. Every pretense of finesse abandoned, all hesitante foregone, just the sinful warmth of his mouth and the slick of spit running down his lips and an utterly unforgettable obscene expression.
in a promise of ecstasy. ‘That’s it, Potter. Fuck, you’re so good. I love- seeing you like this.
‘Took you long enough,’ he grumbled, leaning heavily against the bottom banister.
Harry drew a wicked smirk, leaning over Draco’s desk so he was tauntingly close.
Time went by slurred and sticky until Friday. Draco refused to disclose anything about their plans, and Harry soon gave up asking. Meanwhile, Draco made sure the 8th year Slytherins would be on their best behaviour - or a semblance of it, or an
Sue and Dean Thomas seemed fine with the situation; moreover, they spoke like it was a regular occurrence. Draco himself had no quandaries with the decrepit house. He did steal a look at Harry, though, over the heads of the others: he'd thought his godfather had taken residence in that place before he’d been killed. But Harry was still immersed in his conversation with Neville, and when they finally reached the house Ron forced the door open with a practiced gesture and they all filtered in, Harry included, without so much as a pause at the threshold.
‘Never have I ever been scarred in combat.’
Draco forced a shrug, aiming for nonchalant:
'Most definitely.'
Leanne. A whiny little girl, Katie Bell’s friend, an awkward face to see around the halls. The polar opposite of Ginny Weasley, all tame energy, crossed legs as she read in the grass, mediocre in every class, pretty smile but not
And what could Draco say to that, what words could he string along as a reply, when he knew his voice would falter so pathetically? No, he’d save Harry from hearing that - Harry who was looking at him with eyes so fond, so sure, so
Draco laughed; a surprised, quickly dying sound. He had no idea what to say. There was no
‘Yeah?’ Draco smirked. ‘I more than agree with that. We should do it everyday.’
‘So, we should go over there and tell him not to play.’
The Bludger came out of nowhere, launching itself against Harry’s arm. He went clashing against the Hufflepuff Tower in a blur of scarlet, disappearing between the wooden beams.
Harry shifted besides Draco. His smile, however, was prim charm.
Hermione huffed. ‘You’re awful interested in this, aren’t you?’
‘Yes?’
‘I am. Did it work?’
'You're unbearable.'
Draco hummed. Hermione and Ron were still staring; many others too, Draco reckoned. He wasn’t much inclined to let go of Harry’s wrist, however.
‘Where’s Potter?’
Draco frowned, cold fear coiling inside him.
Draco got nearer, peering at it over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry was clutching his arm. His glasses had slipped, hanging off one ear, and he wasn’t even holding onto the broom, swinging perilously as his thighs clenched around it. Draco’s heart constricted - why hadn’t the bloody twat listened to him and sat the game out?
‘Are you bloody daft, mate? It’s the
‘How’d it go for you? I reckon it was stellar, all you Slytherins are cracks at potions,’ Dean laughed. ‘Well, you won’t believe what happened to us. It was the strangest thing - Harry, you know, we were doing some cramming last night, and he comes in with this old book he got in the- well, nevermind where he got it, but he had it, yeah? And we were skimming through it, and it was all these outdated versions of potions - Amortentia, Mopsus,
it like this, loved knowing
He settled for a little taste of it instead.
He was pretty sure Harry Potter was the only person that could make him indifferent to how undignified he looked.
It didn't help that the students were so
Draco hummed. ‘She ought to keep her lipstick there.’
Draco - opened his legs just so, enough to fit Draco's body between them, and how could Draco resist that?
‘Are you serious?’ Harry said. Draco was very privately pleased with how
changed, then what’s to stop you from pestering him again? What’s to make me believe you’re not still that bloody bully that hurts the people he likes?’
‘Of course I do. I’m just not lucky enough to wake up from them.’
At the genuinity of his words, Draco’s smile grew as well - too fond, too vulnerable, his orgasm having rendered him tired and open. He kissed Harry’s forehead, right over his right eyebrow, then under his eye, then his mouth, slipping his tongue inside.
‘I’m a terrible dancer.’
Harry lightly kicked one of Draco's legs with an impatient huff. 'You know, it's not because we're in your dorm that you get to be demanding.'
‘Only been a couple of days, you forgotten already? Oy, hey! Mister, two red rum shots here! You heard me, mate?’
. Or maybe Draco was just biased - he didn’t think so, however. If there was such a thing as objective beauty, then Harry incarnated it.
'No?' he asked, and he could have said something else - would have, and it would have been unbearably sentimental, by the sickly sweet taste already on his tongue, but then there was a crash, a high-pitched laugh coming from the stalls.
‘Malfoy. Don’t go.’
Harry plunged down, all furious speed, straight towards the midst of the game - Draco’s eyes followed him in surprise, and there, below, trembling by Dean Thomas’s head, was the Golden Snitch.
‘Then that settles it,’ Harry’s smile was easy, fucking excited, and he jostled their entwined fingers.
‘Were you
'Would you get the hell out?'
. How could Harry not see that? How could he possibly be so reckless with his own life as to go into the game with the flimsy promise that his friends would watch over him?
‘Empathically,’ Draco hummed. ‘With threats.’
When Harry stared up at him, his lips twisted into something mocking. ‘Haven’t you heard? I’m the Boy Who Lived.’
Finnigan nodded, finally starting to frown. ‘Yeah, he was pretty far off.’
After a while of pointedly resisting the urge to look at the dancefloor, and considering having another shot of that american stuff he’d been introduced to, someone swung an arm over his hunched back.
Draco looked around, but he was nowhere to be seen.
‘Of course. I like to look good at parties.’
Draco, for one brief moment, was certain a cosmic hex had been placed on him.
And Draco was immediately moving, squeezing Ron quite violently to the side, making him huff a surprised groan. They were all incredibly compressed now, arms resting on the table to take as little space as possible, and Draco didn’t care in the slightest, because that was Potter’s side so warm against his, that was Potter’s knee digging into his thigh as he fiddled in the seat, those were Potter’s hands an inch away from his own on the table.
‘Sickles on the bar, mates!’ came Ron’s voice, loud and excited. The rest of the group was moving towards them, huddled together to take up as little space as possible. ‘We’re all having a shot before we go.’
Draco should buy him a better coat. He could owl it to him, an anonymous parcel. Potter would most likely think it was by one of his enamoured fans.
‘What do you want?’ Draco asked, because this was as close to a date as they’d ever be, and he planned to pay.
Draco stared at him, eyes wide; then, he broke into laughter.
Harry picked up their discarded robes and opened the door, head primly leaned down, eyes on the floor. There was a row of men around it, tall, clad in black and staring with drunken eyes.
‘Oh, yes,’ Harry’s small laugh was a surprised little thing. ‘It’s a recent friendship, I guess. We’re actually… heh....’ he waved a hand around, looking at Draco unsurely.
you off it?’
'We don't have
him, let him blow him in a bathroom, but perhaps Leanne and himself were rebounds. After all, Draco had been so caught up in his own ecstasy that night that he wouldn’t have noticed if Harry was gripping his hair and wishing it red.
At least that Draco wasn't too proud to admit.
'Yeah, I recall,' Harry snorted.  'It was…'
‘It’s no trouble, really. I love them.’
The matter was dropped altogether, despite Draco’s attempts to return to it. By the time they’d finished breakfast, Pansy was quite resolute in speaking only about class, and it was with a victorious smile that she stood at last to go to her Ancient Studies elective. Draco, on his part, hurried down to the greenhouses, his heart quickening with each step.
‘Is it what you had in mind?’
it, he was one for five hushed minutes in the night, he wouldn't explore, he wouldn't tease himself. No, that was Draco's role, and if only he had the
"Yes," Draco says, looking up at him with a hopeful smirk. "I suppose it is. Is it working?"
He yawns widely, since there's no one here to see him anyway. He should probably make a pot of tea and wait for Hermione to get back from the hospital, but his eyes are slipping shut on their own, and the sofa in front of the fireplace is really comfortable.
“You can come out now. I sent them off chasing cousin Dan.”
“You managed to snag one of his hairs, didn’t you?” Ron asks.
“Harry! What the hell happened to you?”
“Wait! His sleeve. See that cufflink? The engraving is charmed. Looks like some sort of cup or trophy with a snake slithering around on it.”
Harry groans and fumbles for his wand, before he’s even fully awake. His head is throbbing, and the dim, misty morning light seems more piercing than the fiercest sunlight. He finally manages to close his hand around his wand and Summon a hangover potion. The small vial comes zooming out of the bathroom, just in time for him to realise that his once-honed Seeker reflexes are not what they used to be. The vial hits him in the chest with a dull thump and lands safely in the bundled up duvet. He unstoppers it and gulps down the contents before the foul smell can make him change his mind. The vice-like grip on his temples eases up immediately, and the light seems to dim down to a bearable level. He throws the duvet off and pads into the kitchen. There’s some orange juice in the fridge and he gulps it down greedily. One of the perks of being single–Philippe always hated when he drank out of the bottle, even if he threw it away after.
“I’ll go with you, if you want me to…” Draco whispers, just loud enough for Harry to hear.
”That’s brilliant!”
Right on cue, Officer Davies bursts through the door with a vial in one hand and the signed permit in the other. Harry grins.
“One of my mates mentioned something about ‘em. Says they’re goin’ to rid us of all those Mudbloods running the place.”
“I used to hide behind the cypress over there.” He points at a huge tree on the other side of the small square.
“Erm…“
“Killing two people over a spell for nicking things? That’s a little extreme, isn’t it?” Ron says.
“And where do we go, if we want to have a chat with him?”
He raps on the door to Ron’s room, and waits for the muffled invitation, before he enters. Ron is sitting up in bed, wearing a pair of purple pyjamas with small snitches on them. Harry remembers his face, when he had seen him open the gag gift from George. That had been the first Christmas Harry had spent at Ron and Hermione’s after they’d moved into their cottage, and the first Christmas after the war that George’s smile had reached his eyes.
“That sounds reasonable,” Draco agrees. “I’ll try to identify the curses, and contact you if I need help.”
“I’m so sorry.” Malfoy gently puts a consoling hand on her shoulder. Harry has to make an effort to keep from gaping at them. Who is this new Malfoy?
“I wasn’t actually planning on asking. She’ll just take me off the case and hand it over to one of the more experienced teams.”
Malfoy stands up, the dismissal clear as day.
“It’s not a person, it’s a rock formation,” Ron says. “On Dartmoor. Like the High Willhays?”
Draco draws back enough to look at him.
“You shouldn’t go alone,” Ron says. “It’s too risky. Besides, there’s no way in hell Savage’ll allow it.”
“Thank God you’re here!” Draco jumps up from the wooden bench that doubles as a cot. He takes a few steps towards Harry, holding out his arms, and then stops. He lets his hands fall to his side, and something that can only be labelled as distrust passes over his face for a fraction of a second. “Are you on duty?”
"Where to?" Malfoy asks.
He Apparates to the corner behind the shed in the Grangers’ back garden ten minutes later, taking a few breaths of damp air and enjoying the smell of soil and pine. He’s still standing there, when he is startled by a high pitched squeal. He peers around the corner, and finds Hermione’s father pushing a laughing Rose on a swing, hung from a pine branch.
“This isn’t your fault. She’s just trying to avoid me fucking up the case even more.”
Ron huffs, and Harry turns towards Savage.
It’s not until he feels the relief surging through him that he realises how badly he’s been wanting to avoid going to hospital. He slumps down in the uncomfortable kitchen chair and takes a deep breath. “Thanks,” he says. “It’s just that… I really hate that place!”
“Very well then. I’ll give you my memory of the Chalice.”
He wakes up a while later, half hard and restless from a dream he can’t quite remember. All he can recall is flashes of white blond hair and broad shoulders. He wills the erection away. He’s been thinking far too much about Malfoy since he and Ron went to Stonehenge. Bloody Malfoy and his stupid ability to get under his skin.
“I’ll go and get the Skele-Gro. Do you want me to help you with anything before I go?”
Ron nods and hurries towards the corridor that leads to the second floor. Harry gets the water boiling and finds three mugs in the slightly lopsided cupboard. He usually drinks out of the slightly chipped one that Rose has decorated with finger paint, but that one is huge and thick, and keeps the tea warm for ages. He roams around for small, thin ones instead. They don’t have time for more than a quick cup while he explains what’s happened and Ron and Hermione wake up.
Hermione frowns at her empty mug. “There is another option,” she says slowly. “But I don’t know if Draco’ll agree to it.”
Harry has squeezed his chair into Ron’s cubicle so they can go over the books together. The dusty tome from the Department of Mysteries might be clear of Dark magic, but it’s still almost humming with an unpleasant energy which feels like bugs crawling all over his skin and makes him want to wipe his fingers clean every time he turns a page. He surreptitiously rubs his hand on his thigh, and instantly regrets it, when the warmth of his palm through the thin fabric of his trousers reminds him of last night. He quickly dismisses the thought of warm hands that aren’t his own, and shakes his hand to get rid of the tingling feeling.
“Your father? But he’s in Azkaban!” Harry blurts, and immediately wants to kick himself. Hard. Malfoy bloody well knows that his own father is in prison. Behaving like a bumbling idiot probably won’t exactly make him any more cooperative.
“I’m not turning you down, Harry,” Draco says softly. A curl of warmth spreads through him at the sound of his name, spoken in that familiar, sophisticated voice. He looks up. Grey eyes stare back at him.
He swallows the tablet and gulps down the water. Muggle painkillers are so much more pleasant to take than potions. Draco takes the empty glass from his hand.
“Oi! Harry, let me have one of those pints over here!”
“They must be hungry, if she’s been dead since yesterday.”
Mr Brigg–Mr Prick, Draco’s voice supplies inside his mind–nods. “Yeah? What’s he been up to now?”
“How’s your husband?” Draco asks. He actually sounds like he cares, if not about Ron, then about Hermione.
“Where, then?”
The Leaky Cauldron is full of happy, relaxed people celebrating the end of the work week. Harry nods at a few Hogwarts friends and coworkers from other departments, while carefully levitating a tray full of Butterbeer towards the huge splotch of red Auror robes at the back of the room. He’s met with a chorus of exclamations from his friends and colleagues.
He’s grateful that Ron and Hermione’ve set their wards to grant him access at all times. Otherwise, he might have ended up being bounced back onto the hard marble floor in the Ministry’s Atrium. Flooing into their kitchen at two a.m. might not be the brightest decision he’s ever made, though. He hasn’t even finished spinning, when he feels the tell-tale leaden sensation of a Stunning spell spreading through his limbs. Out of the corner of his unblinking eyes, he spots Ron peaking out from behind the fridge door where he’s taken shelter.
He closes the door to the study with a louder than necessary slam, and the portraits’ outraged protests fade into the background. Harry looks around. He didn’t notice last night, but the only paintings in here are landscapes and a few modern, abstract pieces. With the way the portraits behave, he certainly understands why.
He turns to Harry.
“Hello,” the blond says.
“Harry! Harry?” Ron nudges him with an elbow.
He looks around carefully, and then slips out from under the cloak, just as the whistle is blown and the match starts.
“The stupid gits went back to Kitty Tor!”
“Did you expect him to? Honestly! He’s the leader of a criminal organisation. Of course he’s not going to talk to outsiders.”
“I’ve set up the Pensieve in my study. It’s down there, to the left.” Draco indicates a corridor, and gestures for them to move first.
“Dense enough that I overheard their plans. Not dense enough to bring the Chalice.”
The Pensieve  looks ancient. The intricate runes are almost worn down by many generations of witches and wizards leaning over the edge of the stone basin. Harry shies away from thinking about what they’ve been seeing in here. Draco unstoppers the vial with his father’s memory and pours the silvery liquid into the dark Pensieve . They watch it swirl, and then the surface goes blank. They join hands before they dive in. Harry lets himself be grounded by the smooth pressure of Hermione’s small, warm hand, at the same time as Draco’s larger, cool palm resting against his own sends a surge of tingling energy through his body. He lowers his head into the basin and lets the curious sensation of not-wet water wash over him. And then he’s submerged in a shadowy world of memories.
“No it’s not. Everybody knows you have a complex about saving.people.” Draco’s smile is so smug, it really makes Harry want to punch him in the arm. He smiles back instead, and takes the chalice from his pocket. He holds it between gloved fingers, for Draco to see.
Ron frowns. “From the way you were just staring at his arse, I think ‘all right’ is a bit of an understatement.”
“Oi! What makes you think you have the right of way, Potter?”
“Thank you Mr Brigg. Please contact us, if you hear from your brother at all.” Ron offers him an Auror Department business card.
“That’s not true,” Draco says.
“No sign of the perpetrator. We locked the Floo for incoming traffic as soon as the medical team got here. Healer Chang and her team are just finishing up. We’ll escort them back through and lock for outgoing.”
Narcissa Malfoy
The two mediwizards obediently start walking towards the Floo, but Ron stops Cho with a hand on her shoulder.
“A pint would be fine. Thank you.”
Brigg scowls, but he’s looking a lot less sure of himself.
Draco stops in front of a door.
“Cutting curse. But not the usual kind. This one was directly aimed at his throat.”
“You won’t finish anything by sleeping at your desk. I promised to meet George for a pint after work. Come with us!”
Harry smirks. “Who, Ron?”
“I couldn’t help noticing you had a bit of trouble with your drink. Would you like me to buy you another one? I’m Adam, by the way.”
“It’s all right, Blimpy. We understand you were scared, and we’re not angry that you hid from us. But we need to know if you saw anything. When your mistress was killed, did you see who did it? Can you describe them to us?”
“No. It didn’t. We’re not even sure which murder was committed first, actually. It’s right this way.” He gestures towards the MLE Floo.
“Ibuprofen would probably be best, if you want it,” Draco offers. “It won’t interfere with the Skele-Gro.”
“It’s no trouble. I want to know about the memory too. How’s Weasley?”
Harry peeks around the door. The room is completely changed. The scraps of paper are gone, and the books have arranged themselves into neat stacks on the floor. A few tomes are glowing faintly, indicating that there are pages missing. He skims the titles; Sonnets of a Sorcerer, You & Your Owl, Secrets of the Darkest Arts… And a leather bound diary. He picks up Sonnets. The title page is partly ripped and glowing. He puts it back. Ron is thumbing through You & Your Owl. He holds it up for Harry to see. The glowing is concentrated on what looks like a beak mark on page 56. Which leaves the diary and Secrets of the Darkest Arts. Not exactly surprising. He reaches for Secrets, thinking that the diary is likely the one they want, but wanting to check anyway. Hermione stops him with a hand on his arm.
But Draco? In a Muggle home? That ought to be interesting! Harry looks at his comfortable but slightly lumpy jumper and jeans combination. A restless, squirmy feeling lodges deep in his guts. No. If he’s going to sit around and talk to Draco like nothing has happened, he should probably at least wear something that doesn’t look like it’s been in the back of his wardrobe since he left school. And maybe he should try to tame his hair just a bit.
“Hermione, it’s a crime scene!” Ron sounds scandalised, but Hermione is already reaching for the Floo powder.
When he reemerges, the first thing he does is look at Ron. He’s wearing that wet dog expression he always gets after a Pensieve  viewing, and shaking his head to clear his ears of liquid. But other than that, he seems to be fine. He notices Harry’s look and smiles.
“How’s Weasley?”
Lucius Malfoy is kneeling in front of Voldemort, who is rambling about how Mudbloods are polluting the magical bloodlines, and how the only way to stop them is to drain the magic from their filthy, unworthy bodies and leave them like the Muggles they were always supposed to be. Nagini is there too, slithering around behind him, creeping over his ankles and raising her head to hiss threateningly in his ear. Harry sees him shivering, small trembles that are only visible to someone paying close attention.
“I don’t know. And don’t start yelling about Veritaserum again, because that’s the truth!”
“That sounds more like something you’d kill people for. And the people who are interested in that sort of thing sound exactly like the sort that wouldn’t think twice about setting off a SDEA alarm.”
Touching a dead person is never going to be Harry’s favourite part of his job. But it is a part of being an Auror, and it has become easier over the years. When Ron unbuttons the cuff on the victim’s shirt, and slowly peels the fabric away from his forearm, Harry is almost disappointed to see that the parchment-thin, yellowish skin is unmarked. He’s placing the man’s arm back on the bed and turning around to cast a cleaning charm on his hands, when something catches his eye.
“Thanks Davies. See you back at Level Two, yeah?”
“You can wait in here. He will be with you shortly.” He turns and shuffles back down the corridor.
He must have been too preoccupied with Hermione’s fussing to hear the door opening, but all of a sudden Draco is there, smelling like fresh soil and wind, bending over to take off his muddied wellies next to the door. He bends over and lean muscles strain his thin, wooly jumper while heavy khakis pull tight over his arse and thighs. Harry has to look away to keep his mind from getting flooded by images of what he’d look like without the muddy cotton to obscure his view.
“Yeah, Percy is a wanker,” Ron mutters. “He can fuck right off, with his stupid election. But I think Harry’s broken his ankle. He should be in hospital.”
“I don’t know what this is, but it’s not a traditional crest. There are certain elements in all the old families crests, and they’re missing in this drawing. I have a copy of Nature’s Nobility if you want to look it up, but I think it’s more likely that it’s a symbol of sorts.”
“No one is going to poke around in my brain! This is my decision. Don’t try to change it!”
“Your Mummy is a very clever woman, Rose. Maybe she’s right.”
Ron goes bright red. Apparently even Polyjuice can’t counteract his tendency to blush. “Fuck you, you wanker,” he hisses.
Malfoy gestures to a couple of plastic chairs along one side of the table, and motions for them to sit down.
“What the hell?”
“Right. And what about the perpetrator? Do we have any idea about the motive?”
Hermione is leaning so close to the book that it’s almost completely obscured by a cascade of curls. She fumbles for her wand on the table without taking her eyes off the text, and nonchalantly configures a napkin into a piece of parchment, and a teaspoon into a quill.
Ron shrugs and picks up Rose and her discarded socks.
“Neither do I”, Draco says. “I’m not sure something like that should even exist… It has too great a potential for evil.”
“Please drink the potion,” he urges.
It feels like his head has only just hit the pillow, when something drags him back to consciousness. At first he thinks it’s just rain on the window, but then there’s a soft hoot, and the tapping picks back up. The cold floor under his feet wakes him up enough that he’s able to open the window without fumbling and let the owl in, together with a freezing gust of wind. It’s not one of the bedraggled Ministry birds that usually delivers the bad news when he has to go into the office during his time off. In fact, this owl reminds him painfully of Hedwig. It’s a little bigger and more angular looking, but just as majestic. It flies into the room, shakes a shower of icy water from it’s feathers, dumps a small envelope on his bed and flies back out, before he can even offer it a treat.
“We don’t know for certain if they set off the trace, but if they did, they must have used Dark magic in some way. But other than that, we don’t know anything about who they are. The state of the crime scene indicates that they were looking for something. Perhaps a book or letter… looks like they took a lot of interest in the books, with all the ripped pages laying around everywhere.” Harry looks at Ron, and finds him nodding thoughtfully. “We should take a closer look at the books. See if there’s a particular kind they were looking for. That might give us a clue.”
They school their expressions and nod.
He sighs and pokes his head around the wall. Ron startles and spits out a few bits of feather from the quill he’s been chewing on.
“This is what’s in it for you, Father,” Draco says. His voice is steady, but his tone is clipped, and his accent is sharper than ever before. “I have been doing my very best to rebuild this family’s name and reputation, but my efforts are thwarted every time someone reminds the public that the head of the family is rotting away in prison. Now, if it were to become public knowledge that you’d assisted Harry Potter with a very high profile case, then my efforts might finally start paying off.”
“Not at all!” George lifts an eyebrow and gives Ron his most winning smile. “Who’s your friend?”
“We need to find another copy of Secrets of the Darkest Arts. I want to read the page that has been ripped out.”
Draco glances at Hermione.
“Mind if we use your Floo?”
Draco hands it to her, together with a scroll of parchment.
“He apologised to you?” Harry has to ask. Just to be sure he heard right, because he can’t really imagine Malfoy apologising to anyone.
Tanned Bloke chooses a spot right next to them and unzips his baggy jeans. Oh, bloody fuck! Harry cringes. Having a baby Death Eater pissing on his shoes wasn’t a part of his plans for the weekend. He wants to look away, but something catches his eye. Tanned Bloke seems to have a problem with shedding. There are mousy brown hairs strewn down the back of his shirt. There’s a grunt and then he’s zipping up his jeans, and turning to go back inside. Before Harry even knows what he’s doing, his hand is reaching out, and he’s grasping a hair between his fingers. Tanned Bloke doesn’t notice, stomping right past him and back through the door.
“No.”
“Yeah. Those books were all huge and ancient. Not something you’d expect to find in a tip like that.” Ron wrinkles his nose.
“To Percy!” George raises his glass of Firewhiskey.
“Yeah. That’s a good idea. Wright doesn’t really strike me as the type of bloke who owns a lot of books, anyway. There could be something there…”
“My brother John, and his mates, Jamie and Matt.”
“Yeah. But we need to be quick about it, don’t we? That Wright business was too messy. The Aurors are goin’ to come snoopin’.” And that’s got to be Bludger.
Ron tries again. Nothing. He stares at his wand, completely at a loss, and Harry’s heart starts racing. The white light when Ron grabbed the cup and Bludger’s laugh just before he disapparated... He looks down. There’s a malicious glint in Smith’s eyes now. Fucking hell!
They’re early enough that there’s still a bit of weak twilight–enough to make out the general outline of their surroundings, but not enough to see any details. Ron nods at a square, hut-like building at the top of the hill, then turns and points at a large rock some ten metres away. Harry nods. They make their way there slowly, careful not to bend any shrubbery or disturb any birds or animals. Then they crouch down behind the rock and wait.
“Or I could just wait for you three,” Ron says, his voice uncharacteristically quiet. “I’m not sure I’ll be able to see anything anyway.”
“I’m so sorry.”
"I think it's this one. My old copy of Beedle the Bard." Draco smiles and points at the dark purple letters on the cover. "The title is written in charmed ink. It changes colour depending on the owner's mood."
“I don’t know… wait! I can call one of the elves. They’re bound to the family. They’ll answer me.”
“Thank you, Potter.” It’s nothing but a mumble, but it’s enough to make Harry’s lips twitch up into a tiny smile. He hurriedly hides it in a cough.
“The Chalice of Infinite Magic,” he says, once Harry has finished his explanation. His eyes are focussed somewhere in the middle distance, and he’s frowning slightly.
She scoots back and takes shelter behind Hermione.
Dear Harry,
Of course. Lucius Malfoy doesn’t do favours for anyone, not even his own son. When he chances a quick glance, Draco looks paler than before, and he’c clenching his jaw so hard the muscle is bouncing. That look is a bit too familiar, he realises. An image of a flooded bathroom, with water being tinted red by blood, is flashing through his mind in a split second. He takes a deep breath, intending to answer Lucius’ question, but before he can say anything, there’s a hand on his arm. He looks down in disbelief, and sees Draco’s fingers rest on his sleeve. The heat from his touch makes his skin tingle.
“Hiya, Harry. Ron!”
“You’re a good mate, Harry.”
Harry nods and lets it go.
“Harry, mate!”
“Draco.” Hermione reaches out and puts a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t think it was worthless,” she says quietly. Draco turns and looks at her tiredly.
Is that what Malfoy’s worried about? Being outed?
“Percy’s an overbearing wanker,” Ron supplies. “Always has been. But what can you expect from someone who was brainwashed by Umbridge?”
He clenches his teeth, and breathes deeply through his nose. The clammy skin against his fingertips, when he brushes them over Draco’s forehead makes him shiver. Draco forces a smile, but it looks more like a grimace.
A few minutes later, they’re seated in saggy armchairs, cradling chipped novelty mugs.
“Yeah, okay.”
It’s almost noon the next day, when they finally find themselves huddling under cloaks and Impervious Charms in a tiny boat on the North Sea. The forbidding rock that houses Azkaban looms on the horizon, and, as they get closer, the air seems to get even more icy, as if the Dementors are still here, lurking in the low, dark clouds that cover the island. Malfoy seems to sink even further into his warm cloak, his shoulders coming up around his ears, and his face almost as pale and grim as Harry remembers it from sixth year.
“Of course.” He walks over, still grateful to be able to move, and puts his arms around his neck, pulling him in for a brief kiss.
“The I suppose we’ll just have to trust each other, won’t we?”
Malfoy’s stupidly elegant eyebrow shoots up again.
“It does seem more relaxed here,” he offers, uncertain what to say.
The door to the kitchen is slammed open, and warm yellow light spills out into the grey winter afternoon.
Bludger hits the floor face first. Good, Harry thinks maliciously. Then he’s throwing himself down next to Draco, and tuning everything else out.
The room looks nothing like Draco's cozy, warm study. The atmosphere of disuse is even stronger in here, and the Dark Magic is so strong Harry can feel it thrumming through the air like a current of restless energy and jabbing at his skin like millions of tiny needles. Like it's trying to push him out of the room. He looks at Draco, and finds him looking just as uneasy as he feels.
She shrugs. “Sorry. No idea.”
“I think I’ve found a way to get into my father’s study.”
Malfoy’s skin is even paler than usual, and his jaw is clenched tight. Harry has a sudden urge to reach out and put a hand on his shoulder or back. But instead he matches his steps to Malfoy’s, trying to present a united front towards both the guards and the prisoners.
They apparate to the back entrance of Borgin and Burkes, and Harry spends a few seconds making sure that he’s completely covered by the cloak.
“Yes. Of course we can use my Pensieve. But I’ll have to Floo ahead. The elves will be startled if I bring guests without notice, and Mother might be having visitors.”
“Ha! He usually falls asleep before she does, when he puts her to bed.”
“No. No they didn’t, and I didn’t go alone either. Malfoy went with me.“
The bar is almost empty. There’s an old witch behind the bar, and two portly wizards discussing their gardens. When they enter, all eyes turn to them, and Harry momentarily regrets that he didn’t transfigure his Auror robes into something less conspicuous before they came in. But, just as quickly, everyone turns back to their own drinks and conversations. Apparently, this is a mind your own business sort of place. He only realises how tense he’s been when he feels his shoulders drop in relief.
“Yes, well. To be honest, I’m not so sure about that. It seems my presence was more of a provocation than I’d expected.”
Draco nods, and Harry slips under the Cloak again.
“Look, I’m not a bloody Blast-Ended Skrewt for you to experiment on! Just leave me alone, and work out how to perform the bloody ritual!”
“The notes. Do you think you can recognise the book he hid them in?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes. That is a yes.”
Bloody hell! A huge block of ice seems to have lodged itself somewhere around his solar plexus. Icy cold spreads through his entire body, and he sinks into the nearest chair, not trusting his legs anymore. A statement given under the influence of Veritaserum is almost as good as an actual confession.
“Come on. I’ll Apparate us.”
“I haven’t been able to get a Portkey made. The house is Unplottable, so you’ll have to go by broom.”
When he steps out from behind the shed for the second time that day, he almost runs into Draco. He looks a little paler than usual, and his mouth is set in a grim line, but when he sees Harry, his face lights up in a smile that makes Harry’s heart do an odd flip flop.
“Do you think we can get in without them noticing us?”
Malfoy.
“We should check him. See if he’s marked,” Ron says.
“Like hell I will! This is my house,” Draco hisses. He’s slipped the Cloak down, making his head float eerily in thin air.
“No she’s not. Remember that howler I told you about? The one Mum sent to Percy in the middle of a Cabinet meeting? This is all about me, mate.”
The kiss is gentle. Almost like a question–do you want this too–though Harry doesn’t really know if he’s the one asking. He fully expects Draco to wrench himself free, but God, he smells so good, like fresh cotton and man, and Harry can’t help himself. He leans forward on the chair and deepens the kiss, almost groaning at the first, intoxicating taste. Draco’s scent and taste blend together and invade his senses, making him light headed and giddy. And suddenly it’s not a matter of who is kissing whom, but something they are sharing. He runs a hand up Draco’s neck, enjoying the warm skin under his palm and the shiver his touch is inducing. He threads fingers through the short hair at his nape, marveling at the silky feel of it. Draco gasps and arches his head back into his hand. Harry pulls back from the kiss enough to take a deep breath. Draco rests his forehead against his.
Then Draco looks up, his expression set. “I need to get my wand before we go.”
"Alohomora."
They stand there for a few seconds, just looking at each other and catching their breath. Then Harry casts a set of standard crime scene wards on the hut, while Ron checks for hidden persons behind the few pieces of furniture. He can feel the relieved smile spreading on his face, and see it mirrored in Ron’s wide grin.
“That filthy bastard!” he grits out. “This was nothing but a fucking guilt trip. What a bloody waste of time! Fuck!” Draco’s fist collides with the wooden table, and the small vial tumbles to the floor and rolls toward the fireplace. Harry suspects that it takes a lot to make Draco snap these days. He’s obviously witnessing something that not many people get to see: Draco Malfoy being completely honest about how he feels.
Obviously he hasn’t, because he feels extremely out of the loop right now. “Heard what?”
Draco looks at him a little too knowingly. “Between the Unspeakables and the Curse-breakers, I’m sure the Ministry staff will be able to handle it without my input. Besides, the way you feel about St. Mungo’s? That’s more or less how I feel about the Ministry. I don’t exactly have fond memories about the place.”
"I don't think a simple healing spell will fix this. I have some salve and a pain potion, but if you'd rather see a healer..."
She sighs and detaches herself from his legs. “Okay. I’ll play with Granddad.”
“Bye, Draco. See you at the hearing.” He’s regretting his words, even as he slams the door shut. But he doesn’t go back.
“Good! I hope they make him spend the night in a holding cell. Bloody wanker.”
“Please do, Weasley.” Malfoy opens the door and holds it for them, and they have to squeeze by him to step outside. Malfoy smells like fresh air and expensive shampoo, and Harry can’t help a tiny shiver running down his back. He turns back and belatedly shouts a goodbye, just as the door is closed with a snap.
Damn it! He'd been counting on distracting Hermione by appealing to her swotty side.
With a last hoot, the bird takes flight, and he closes the window again. He turns around to find his clothes, and his eyes land on the shirt he borrowed from Draco. Reaching out, he runs his hand over the soft cotton, stroking it once. It’s such a pathetic, silly thing to do, but no one is here to see anyway, so he brings it to his face and nuzzles his nose into the fabric, inhaling the scent of clean cotton and Draco. He shakes his head and smiles to himself. Here he is, a grown man standing in the middle of his living room, in his underwear, sniffing a shirt. He knows it’s pathetic, especially since they’ve agreed that this isn’t going anywhere right now, which is the right decision, he reminds himself. Again. Mooning over a stupid, borrowed shirt isn’t helpful at all. He’s on his way into the bathroom to throw it in the hamper, but, at the last moment, he changes his mind and throws it on the bed instead. He probably won’t have time for laundry today anyway, and so what if he sleeps in it tonight? Snuggling with someone’s shirt is not completely creepy if they’re going to see where this mutual… thing they’ve discovered is going, is it? And Draco will never know, anyway.
“I’m so sorry to wake you up,” Harry says. He might as well apologise right away. “But Draco’s in trouble, and I need your help.”
The Death Eaters have some kind of leader with more brains than Bludger, and they are planning to strike at a time where many Muggleborns are in the same place at once. They’ve hidden the Chalice, and they’re going to hide the diary that holds the ritual that can release Ron’s magic back to him. And that’s where it stops. Without Ron there, he can’t form a plan of action. He eyes the vial. There is evidence of a crime in there, which means that technically speaking, it’s evidence. He shouldn’t take it outside of the Ministry. But Hermione and Ron both have the proper clearance, and Savage has authorised Draco as a consultant on the case… And if he hurries, he might still get a plate full of leftover lamb chops and possibly even some dessert. He pockets the vial and makes his way back to the atrium.
“Monsieur?”
“Maybe we should get some sleep first?” Hermione suggests. “Breaking curses and dismantling wards requires a lot of focus, and we’re not exactly well rested…”
“We went to the Quidditch match, and then followed the suspects. Unfortunately, my Polyjuice wore off, and we ended up duelling. I hurt my leg and dropped my wand, but got the pages. Then Hermione Apparated us away. My leg’s fine now, though. I was just about to go and relieve whoever is interviewing Cadogan.”
“Fifi?”
“Oui. There are two men there. They are in the dining room, and they are drinking Monsieur’s best wine. Fifi tried to stop them, but they said that Monsieur Lucius sent them here.” She wrings her hands. “Fifi knows that Monsieur Lucius is no longer a respectable wizard, but he is still a Malfoy and Fifi must do as he commands.”
“You might want to have a look inside the Beheaded Goblin.”
“Of course,” Draco says. I’ll Floo there now, and take care of the wards. Give me ten minutes.
“No. Lucius Malfoy did.”
"What'd you get?" he finally asks.
“What’s the status?” Ron asks.
“This is a signed release order for Mr Malfoy. You’re leaving for France in half an hour, Auror Potter. Take him with you. It’ll be easier to get through the wards on the Malfoy residence if he’s there.”
“Smith?”
"What do you want me to do?"
“It’s probably not dangerous! The Head of Department wouldn’t have let them do it if it was,” the young man says earnestly.
“Yes, Ma’am!” Ron scrambles to his feet. Harry hurries to follow him. They’re already at the door when Savage starts giving orders to the other teams about border monitoring and extra protection for the Muggle Prime Minister.
“He’s a leading expert in the field.”
As they approach the Apparition point, he has to make more and more of an effort to appear careless and happy. This is the point where their plan is most likely to fall apart. If Bludger doesn’t give clear instructions for where to Apparate, or if he somehow fails to Side-Along Hermione and Draco… He tries to shake it off, but by the time they reach the small stand of shrubs and bushes, he’s as pumped on adrenaline as before any other mission, and the loud singing is difficult to hear over the sound of his heartbeat in his ears. A strong, invisible hand catches his wrist for a brief moment, and brushes against his palm. It’s enough to snap him back into reality, and make him wish he could actually hold Draco’s hand. Then they step into the roughly circular path where the grass is worn away by the shoes of hundreds of witches and wizards turning to Disapparate.
“Yeah, right,” Matt says. He’s got his hand in his pocket, and Harry can see the outline of his fist as he grips his wand. “Did you nick her face too?”
Malfoy throws him a half hearted glare, and walks to the bar. Harry can’t help noticing a subtle sway in his hips that wasn’t there before.
“Figures.”
“Sorry to bother you, but Savage’s asking for you.”
He finds Ron and Hermione in the least classified area of the Department of Mysteries, where even lowly Aurors have access. Hermione is engrossed in the diary with a few of her colleagues. Ron is sitting in a chair, surrounded by a gaggle of Curse-breakers and Unspeakables. One look at him confirms that he’s trying–and failing–to control his temper. When one of the Unspeakables pokes him in the ribs with her wand while casting a charm on him, he jumps from the chair.
“Maybe it’s not that book after all,” Hermione points at the diary. “Maybe it’s this one.” She draws her wand and starts casting spells on it. She dismantles a few hexes and when she deems it safe, she opens the slim book. A bunch of pages have been ripped out, leaving only the first few letters of every word.
“We finally caught the illegal fireworks manufacturers.”
“What cell’s he in?”
Harry sinks into his chair and peeks around the screen at Ron’s desk. The mug of tea he left almost a week ago is still there, on top of a half finished pile of paperwork. Of course Ron’s desk looks the same. He’s stared at it every day for a week, not wanting to clean it, because that’d mean admitting that Ron isn’t coming back soon enough to do it himself. He doesn’t know why he’d expected it to be any different, but somehow, after all that’s happened, the normalcy of it is startling. He banishes the half empty mug to the kitchen with a sloppy flick of his wand, secretly hoping that it’ll hit Donovan in the face on its way there.
“No thank you, Tobby. I’ll fetch refreshments myself if we want them.”
Harry looks up from the file. “Did you know Bludger’s brother is an Azkaban guard?”
“You can start. We can always switch later if I’m not getting anywhere.”
“He told me that he’d pay me. He told me where I could find some things he’d hidden during the war, and he said I’d get more if I helped him.”
“We shouldn’t.”
There’s a clanking noise of metal and wood from inside the shed, as someone knocks over a gardening tool, and then Bludger steps out.
Ron’s frown turns into a smirk. Harry throws a biscuit at him and sinks into one of the kitchen chairs.
“Ron…calm down. He’s not worth it.”
“Hermione is planning to kidnap you.” Ron is leaning close enough for their conversation to remain private. “She says we need to take you out clubbing. To get your mind off things, she said. She’s taking Rose to spend the night at Ginny and Neville’s. Just thought I’d warn you.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think... Obviously.”
“Perfect.”
The elf puts her hands on Draco’s leg and closes her eyes. She starts humming to herself, and the air fills with a beautiful glowing light, almost like the gentle spring sun outside. When he risks a look at the wound, the flow of blood has stilled to a quiet oozing.
“I’ll ask if we can use the Floo.” Malfoy steps over to talk to the old witch behind the bar, and leaves Harry to the whirlwind of embarrassment and fatigue and pure want that is turning in his stomach. This is not good. This is not good for so many reasons! He takes a deep breath and wills himself to calm down. He’s revealed too much already. Enough that working with Malfoy is going to be pure agony. And he does still have to work with Malfoy if he wants to solve this case. Ron probably isn’t going to be able to do much without his magic. The churning in his stomach suddenly becomes a lot more physical, when he thinks about Ron, surrounded by healers, looking pale and determined and gritting his teeth, but unable to levitate a feather. Yeah. Apparating is definitely a bad idea right now.
As if on cue, Draco looks up again.
Ron smiles at him, and Harry has to stifle a laugh, when he hears him start talking about how he’s a passionate collector of dark amulets, and how he just loves going into the ‘cute and quaint’ little shops in Knockturn to look for dark items.
He tells them everything, from the moment the owl woke him up, to Ron stunning him. When he falls silent, his friends just sit there, looking at him for what feels like hours. Finally, Ron clears his throat.
“Why?”
When he looks at Draco, he’s startled to see a small, genuine smile, just like the one on his own lips. It’s good to know that Hermione has made a friend who is as hungry for knowledge as she is. It’s the one area where neither he nor Ron has ever been able to measure up.
He hears Malfoy hit the ground with a satisfying thump. And then the anti-Apparition charms are lifted. Bludger’s mate grabs the young man in the tattered cloak by the arm and Disapparates.
Draco’s cheeks are turning slightly pink. Harry shakes his head. He might be friends with Hermione these days, but apparently he doesn’t know her very well.
“A toast! To the man who saved the day!”
He makes his way over the well kept but winter brown lawn, and pushes the door open. Hermione and Ron are sitting at the small kitchen table with mugs of tea in front of them. They’d looked up as he entered, but their heads are still close together, and Hermione is clasping Ron’s hand. She still looks a bit stressed, Harry thinks, but Ron smiles at him and offers a nod in greeting. He gently extracts his hand from her hold and uses it to maneuver a huge pastry into his mouth.
Harry casts a glance at the parchment. The Magical Branch of the British Museum is located on the lawn to the right of the main entrance, it says in a neat cursive that he vaguely remembers from Malfoy’s hate-notes in school.
“Orkney. It’s a Neolithic settlement site,” Draco says. “I’ll Side-Along you.”
“Maybe it’s someone else’s crest.”
George’s face transform into a gleeful grin. “Oi! Ginny! Angelina! Come and say hello to Harry and his new girlfriend!”
Days? Fuck! They don’t have ‘days’. They need to get the Chalice before it causes any more harm.
“What about him?” Ron nods at Smith.
He nods, even though they’re so close under the Cloak, that he’s not sure if Draco and Hermione will see. Draco presses his hand against the small of his back, and he allows himself to lean into the touch for a few seconds. Then he slips away from the relative safety of the Cloak again, and makes his way towards the sound of voices.
"Well," she seems to think for a moment, tilting he head to the side as she studies Draco for a good few moments and smiles. "He's cute in a rat kind of way if you ask me."
"Hey, Malfoy!" He must have spoken too loud or too suddenly because Malfoy literally jumps and Harry has no clue why he finds it so endearing.
"You were, you prick," Draco shoves at his shoulder and Harry lets out a brilliant laugh, head thrown back and everything. He shoves back, with more force. And he doesn't let go, Draco realizes when Harry is guiding him down to lay on the grass.
a voice reminded him, strangely similar to his mothers.
"You were looking for this book, right?"
Draco looks the exact opposite of what he did in their 6th year, Harry knows how miserable he seemed back then.
When they're leaving though, Harry gives him an almost shy but undoubtedly genuine smile and Draco's stomach swoops at the sight of it.
He looks
Draco has been finished for minutes, but he wanted to wait for Potter to leave. He didn't want to walk with him to the common room in complete silence, after all, this last hour had been awkward enough, so Draco makes it look like he's still busy, moving pots and plants around uselessly.
Harry's chest goes tight again and he's the one picking up his wand this time, but he pays no mind to the Hufflepuffs who start to look bored now that Malfoy ignores the pumpkin juice.
that follows because of his nightmares? Even if that's strange to admit.
It helps that he always sits in the same spot, alone today, the few Slytherins that have returned after the war seemingly keep their distance from the blond too.
Oh, how he missed her when he was crying his eyes out, big, bitter tears because Potter didn't want to be his friend when Draco wanted it more than anything. And he couldn't understand back then, as a child who has gotten anything he ever wanted,
Malfoy scrunches up his nose in disgust and it's nearly enough to make Harry burst out laughing. Not to mention how flustered Harry gets all of a sudden by that simple gesture. He has never seen Malfoy act like this, it's a glance behind his perfectly emotionless mask and Harry would love to take more than a peek.
But then again, he's less of a bother and more of a nice company at this point, Draco had to admit.
"Mostly," Harry answers after some thinking.
It's just the guilt, isn't it? The images of his nightmares float in front of his eyes again, on queue. Draco on the bathroom floor, eyes lifeless, Draco being dragged down into the lake, disappearing under the surface of the water.
And Potter sliced up his chest with the Sectusempra, leaving ugly marks and Draco still thinks he deserved it to this day. He should be happy he got away with as little as those, actually.
"Oh, I did. Two times." Harry admits, knowing full well his face heats up slightly. "But they kept dissolving after I put the next ingredient in and I had to start over."
Luckily for the eight years, the curfew is not something they have to worry about this year so Harry can simply go and sit down next to him.
For now, though, Draco has to catch that bloody Snitch so he can show Potter.
, he thinks, despite Draco's glare.
"Mostly?"
Malfoy didn't even show any emotion when black inky vines crept out of the lake behind him to wrap themselves around him and pull him down into the deep, vanishing Malfoy without a trace, in a blink of an eye.
His room, the only safe space he had in the Manor when
But in turn, he helps Draco with his Charms assignments, well, they compare their homework because Draco is not so sure about some of his answers. That alone, him admitting that to Harry counted as huge progress!
In fact, he wants to do something about his misery, anything.
Harry swears he sees Malfoy roll his eyes.
"I am," Draco says quietly, frown in place and Harry's stomach tightens with embarrassment. That's fair.
It's not that Harry doesn't feel strange around Malfoy anymore, but it's almost like they're stepping into another world in these evenings.
"Where are you going?" Ron asks, just as confused as Hermione next to him.
Still, he mostly noticed Malfoy not being very Malfoy-like this year, for a lack of a better word. Entitled git comes close to the right term. He didn't seek out Harry once to mock him, he didn't shout at him three tables away and he didn't even spread weird rumors about him. None!
"It never occurred to me to do that when we were kids and it's a shame because things would've turned out very different if it did." He says and Draco could hit him.
"Oh, why are you surprised?" Harry plays along, with a hint of a smile on his lips.
Luna raises her eyebrows at him and Harry is secretly proud of himself for surprising her. It's not an easy thing to do, after all.
"We both need the book, so why not, Malfoy?"
"You don't have to!" He blurts because he panics. He doesn't want this delicate thing to break between them. They just started to be friends. Draco meets his eyes again, finally, startled he looks eerily similar to what he did in the bathroom a few years ago.
When their eyes meet Harry resists the urge to look away and only offers a smile and a small wave. Draco still has this bewildered and flustered look on his face when Harry does so, but he stopped scowling back at him, only giving Harry a polite nod.
Draco doesn't think he will ever forget how hot  Potter's lips felt pressed against his own.
No matter how many times he's been startled awake by the nightmares, his heart races the same and there are tear marks on his cheeks. He always lays there, head full of various images of the War, or lately, full of Draco Malfoy.
"Really? I could very well reject you. I can tell the wrong sort for myself, you know." He drawls, mimicking Potter's voice in an exasperated manner. Harry laughs, making Draco bristle further.
"Merlin's tits Potter, why do you feel the need to sneak up on people like that? If I wouldn't know better I'd say you're a Slytherin," Draco scoffs as he turns to face him, rather coldly.
"You could," He grins, shrugging and hand still out, he's not backing off. "But will you? I'm serious, Draco." Harry says, his grin softens into a smile and Draco could never say no to those unfairly disgustingly beautiful eyes of his, could he?
He never did get rid of those damn feelings he had for Potter.
Harry didn't mean to make that 6th year Gryffindor's ears and teeth massive, really, he didn't. Only, the guy was pointing his wand at Malfoy on one of the moving staircases, snarling at him. And that's not nice now, is it? He had to do something, to be an example of house solidarity and all that bullcrap.
Malfoy somehow morphs into
He doesn't see it, but he feels Harry's presence hesitate at the door, and Draco imagines him turning around, he feels Harry's eyes on the back of his neck. Why did that send a slight shiver down his spine? "I'll go then, good night, Malfoy."
"Are you offering me a truce, Potter?" He asks eventually and looks at Harry, eyebrows delicately raised. There is also a flush to his cheeks, and the tip of his ears Harry finds incredibly endearing.
Maybe a few other tries would do the trick.
"Yes, if I must," Draco sighs, but there is a spark in his eyes again, the dullness of them is more or less gone and that's exactly what Harry wanted. His heart is full when he goes to meet up with his friends at the entrance of the Great Hall.
"I need some help anyway and Hermione just lectures me if I ask for it." Harry rolls his eyes half-heartedly.
right, but it's still so cruel.
Harry hates these dreams just as much as the ones he has about Cedric. Both have him heaving for air that never reaches his lungs, the guilt pressing down on his chest like he has been trapped under a brick wall.
"Well, anyway, Professor Sprout already said we should be replanting these together, so..." Potter gestures at the various plants.
"At the Slytherin table." It's a weird, amusing mix between a question and a statement and Harry rolls his eyes with the dramaticness of one Draco Malfoy.
The first opportunity to Make Malfoy Feel Something as Harry had named it lovingly (only in his head, never out loud and maybe that's why he fails to realize the double meaning of it) shows itself in the following days. Harry is having dinner with Ron and Hermione like he always does. And he's looking at Draco. Like he always does lately, apparently. Two whole tables and six row of students separate them and yet he always finds the tall blonde in mere seconds into searching.
He noticed the most mundane details as he watched Draco work sometimes when the conversation died down and it was just silence, comfortable, and light.
"Excellent, I'll leave you to it then, I will check up on you later," she smiles at them both, even Malfoy.
Like Potter forgave him.
He shudders, feeling sick and Hermione gives him a slightly worried look but Harry dismisses it with a gentle shake of his head, probably looking slightly pale.
So he keeps his reasons to himself, even though there are very little things he doesn't share with Hermione or Ron these days. They're closer than ever after everything and Harry is so grateful for them, every single day. He's sure they would understand eventually, despite them having their personal problems with Malfoy, but not now. Harry himself isn't ready to have that conversation.
Somewhere he can rewind, turn his brain off, let all his frustration out on the soil, and pulling out weeds, also throwing out all his toxic thoughts in the process so the plant can thrive, and so can Draco.
Neither of them expected the slow but steady conversation that bloomed between them as the days passed and Harry found himself looking forward to every evening just as much as Draco worried when Potter was five, ten minutes late on occasion. He always arrived with an apology, and an explanation, like he would have to explain himself.
"I actually wanted to ask if you have any worms to spare? I'm all out."
They didn't talk up until Potter was finished, and Madame Pomfrey came to tell them they did a good job.
"Really, Harry, you wouldn't expect me to ignore you?" Malfoy raises a delicate eyebrow at him.
Harry has dreamt of Malfoy, on a sunny afternoon, and the Great Lake which would be confusing as it is. Why would Malfoy show up in his dreams after all? In almost a pleasant manner at that. He didn't look too peachy, though.
"No, you didn't. You're just an incredibly sore loser." Draco huffs, and he sits on the ground like they always do. He doesn't even whine much about getting grass stains on his clothes.
There is no one to please now, only himself and it's somehow even more difficult. There is guilt and high expectations, and the desire to do right,
"You're absolutely no fun to talk to today, Draco." His name rolls off his tongue easily, and Draco thinks he could get used to the sound of it.
Or well, straight one.
"What are you doing, Potter?" He asks and Harry piles roasted potatoes on his plate.
Malfoy only noticed that it was indeed Harry who had his wand out, and who most likely cast the spell. His eyes went slightly wide when the realization set in and the smile disappeared from his face, to be replaced by his usual scowl.
“Harry!” Rose runs at him and wraps her chubby arms around his legs, nearly tripping him. “Are you going to play with me?”
Hermione’s eyes narrow dangerously.
“Right.” Ron casts a quick glance at the window. “To summarise, you admit to taking bribes from a prisoner, conspiring to cause harm to innocent witches and wizards and housing a fugitive?”
Love,
A weak light is flickering behind the window, and there are shadows moving in the darkness. The door opens and casts a beam of lamplight on two cloaked and masked figures. When the door closes again and the light disappears, the darkness suddenly feels impenetrable. Harry blinks and tries to adjust his eyes, but in the end he gives up and tugs on Ron’s sleeve instead.
Harry is awake unusually early for a Sunday. A cold draft is seeping under the duvet where he’s stupidly kicked it off during the night. He gathers it closer around him, burrowing into the hot cocoon. He’s not really ready to leave his very nice dream of kisses and soft, blond hair and broad shoulders behind. A sound penetrates his lovely, worry-free state of half sleep. There’s an owl trying to get in. Again. A very stubborn owl, he decides, after ignoring it for about thirty seconds to no avail. He drapes the crumpled duvet around his body and goes to open the window. A gust of icy wind and Hermione’s barn owl sweeps into the room, and Harry slams the window shut. The owl drops a letter on the table, and perches on top of one of his chairs, staring disapprovingly at the closed window. He hurries to open it again, and the owl hoots at him, but stays where it is.
“No problem. Did you get hold of Hermione?”
“Oh, Harry! Let me fix it for you.” Hermione grabs his chin in one strong hand and tilts his head up.
“Is Savage here?”
Please report to Level Two as soon as you read this. There has been a development in the case you are working on. Auror Weasley has been informed and is instructed to meet you at the Ministry.
“Look!”
Oh. So Adam hasn’t recognised him yet. Harry relaxes a bit. Perhaps he should try to stay anonymous for a while longer. Just to postpone the moment where the conversation turns from awkward flirting to awkward remembrance of dead loved ones.
He sneaks up to the same window he and Ron were looking through. Everything looks the same, and he can’t really process the fact that it’s been less than two days. It feels more like a year, with everything that’s happened... He tries to shake away the thoughts that are racing through his mind. Thoughts of Ron’s missing magic and Draco’s passionate kiss aren’t really helpful at the moment. Besides, thinking about Ron and Draco at the same time is awkward, even if those thoughts are in really, really different contexts.
“Auror Potter! Just a moment, Sir. I’ll check for you!” He casts a charm on the scroll of parchment in front of him, and a line is highlighted by a blue glow. “Auror Weasley has been moved to the Spell Damage ward, Sir. Room 502. Would you like me to call for someone to escort you there?”
“Sounds like something Draco would say,” Harry mutters into his pint. He doesn’t stay for a second round.
"Yes, Master Draco?"
“Thank you.”
Harry sees the split second of emotions flickering across Draco’s face, before he schools it into a mask of indifference. Lucius doesn’t move a single muscle.
“What’s the most important question?” Harry asks. Malfoy sends him a look of pure disbelief.
“Yeah, that’s what the letter said. They didn’t tell you what Death Eater activity you were supposed to have committed?” On the one hand, he hopes not. It’s a tried and true tactic to keep the accusations as vague as possible, to maybe get the suspect to confess to more crimes that the Aurors know about. But on the other hand… If that fuckwit Donovan was the one doing the actual arrest, anything is possible.
The thought of Draco being worried makes him sort of dizzy. Apart from Ron and Hermione–and Molly, of cours– he’s not used to people worrying about him. It used to make him feel sort of claustrophobic, back when Philippe used to urge him not to go on assignments because it made him worry. He’s not feeling claustrophobic now. He leans in and brushes his lips over Draco’s cheek, inhaling that winter fresh scent again, and whispering into his ear.
Draco nods. “Of course. Since you’ve become pen pals with my mother, will you let her know that I’m all right?”
Draco runs the pad of his thumb over the inside of his wrist, and he gasps. The hand on his skin stills. Fuck! He shuts his eyes a little tighter. No. He has to look. Has to see what expression is on Draco’s face. He opens his eyes, and finds startled, grey eyes staring at him. Draco’s lips are slightly parted, and they look so soft and perfect. Before he really knows what he’s doing, he’s leaning towards them. The grip on his arm tightens almost to the point of pain, and then relaxes, as Draco leans in to close the distance.
“Good. We’ll go inside under this Cloak, and you’re going to guard the door. If they try to leave, please stun them. Nothing else. Just stun them. Do you understand?”
He finds Ron in the kitchen, watching Rose trying to pet Crookshanks. He’s smirking slightly behind his mug of tea. The ancient cat looks decidedly unenthusiastic about Rosie’s sticky little fingers in his fur, his tail swishing at his ears twitching. When Harry hesitates a moment in closing the door, he quickly makes his escape into the garden. Rose frowns, but is quickly distracted by pulling off her shoes and socks.
When he reaches Level Two, he’s relieved to see that the department is quiet. He starts for the Auror division, thinking that whoever called him in will probably have left a message at his desk.
“Incarcerous!” Ron shouts.
The street is busy at this time of the morning, but the area in front of the Museum is still blessedly free of tour groups and school children. As they walk towards the lawn, the air in front of them shimmers like a mirage and dissolves into a building. Hermione presses her wand against the door, and it opens. Harry hurries to do the same.
She tucks her wand back into her sleeve and nods primly.
Harry pauses to cast a Concealment Charm, and wishes that he’d brought his cloak with him.  He’s not really meant to use it at work, but Savage probably won’t mind. Maybe. Besides, the rules are a little more bendable, when they’re dealing with SDEA cases.
Malfoy is still an arrogant prick, Harry thinks. But he can’t help admiring the way his shoulders stretch the fabric of his wooly jumper, when he turns his back on them and starts putting his boots back on.
“Harry. And yes, please. But perhaps not Firewhiskey this time.”
“Malfoy!”
Draco turns slightly and looks at him. There’s something new in his eyes… something more honest than he’s ever seen from Draco.
“Nice to meet you Harry. A pint? Or something stronger?”
“Very well then, Ms. Granger.” He slowly gets to his feet and comes around the desk. “If you’d be so kind as to follow me.”
"Do your worst, Malfoy."
Since when are you on a first name basis with that wanker?”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry says.
Draco wrinkles his nose. “As if I’d ever be afraid of a Weasley!”
Draco raises his wand and starts casting. Then he lowers it again, and flattens himself against the wall, casting nervous glances at the windows. “Shit,” he whispers. “The wards are already down. Someone’s here.”
Ron fights his way free of the Cloak, and runs towards the shed, but before he gets there, the tell-tale sound of Apparition tells them that it’s too late.
“Right. Did it set the trace off?”
“This charming young lady is your baby brother.”
“Morning.”
“This is your Portkey, Auror Weasley. The Irish Aurors are waiting for you.“
Draco’s still limping slightly, but he refuses to use a cane, so Harry stays close enough that he’ll be able to grab his elbow if needed. He hasn’t told him why, but Harry secretly thinks it’s because he doesn’t want to look like his father. Not that he does. Harry looks at the man at his side. Draco is wearing his usual work attire of khakis and sturdy boots, insisting that they make a slight detour on the way to Malfoy Manor to take a look at his neglected excavation. Even Hermione’s constant reassurances and Martin and Catherine’s visit yesterday hasn’t been enough to reassure him that he can take a few more days to recuperate before going back.
