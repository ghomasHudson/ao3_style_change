Not usually one to be bribed, McGonagall looked at the treat and smirked.  “Thank you, Mr. Potter.  But next time, please be punctual.”
“Oh, I would love to go to Greece,” Hermione said.  She smoothed the light hair out of Rose’s eyes.  “Someday we’ll travel again.  But right now, we’re concentrating on our family.”
Theo grinned.  “All right.  It’s a date then.”  He turned and briskly walked back to his own seat.  He finished his meal, the smile never leaving his face.
Each thud of the bedpost was accompanied by a moan and a grunt.  And the sound of skin slapping skin.
Her skirt was hiked up all the way and her knickers flung off the bed somewhere, but Anthony didn’t attempt to touch her exposed quim yet.  Instead, he began to unbutton her blouse, slowly, one button at a time.  He pulled her to a sitting position and slipped the sleeves off her arms, then reached around to unclasp her bra.  She kept her eyes closed as he removed that as well, then gently lay her back down.  Next, he unzipped her skirt and pulled it off, leaving her completely nude.  He had rid himself of his own clothing the moment she first pulled the curtain.
As they made their way to the head table, students stared up at them.  Draco finally saw the newspapers and grabbed one off the Ravenclaw table.
Harry grabbed a blanket and hurried out of the tower, running all the way past the classrooms to the door to the courtyard.  It was dark out, as the sun had been setting so early these days.  But he could make out a shock of white blond hair by one of the trees.  Harry walked over to Draco and draped the blanket on him.  The boy was freezing.
Harry and Draco had been moving toward this moment slowly, but surely for the past couple of weeks.  Since Draco had introduced Harry to the joys of rimming, the pair had graduated from tongues to fingers.
“You’re not planning to start a family? Mum will never have it.  She expects grandchildren from all of us, you included,” Bill told him.
Before long, they were both caught up in the moment, nearly forgetting there was a purpose to jerking in a public lavatory.  Harry had returned the favor and was stroking Draco along with him.
“I was only wondering how that Fifth Year fellow was doing.  You know, the one I told you was failing Potions?”
Smirking, Draco said, “All right.  But you have to promise not to take any of it personally.  I don’t want it to cause any tension between us.”
blue rose, or a blue rose.  I’ll need to know.  I certainly don’t want to pick up the wrong person,” Draco snickered.
Draco didn’t suppose Blaise and Pansy would be as open to a friendship with Harry.  They would be curious, for certain.  However, it would take a great deal of effort on Draco’s part to bring them together.
“Of course not,” Draco replied.  “He’s been here for over three weeks now, though.  Why does he still need so much mentoring?  Is he daft or something?”
Taking the sandwiches out of the bag and putting them on plates, Draco reminded Harry, “I’ve good incentive to push myself. You promised to shag me for days on end, as I recall.”
It made sense.  Get the kiss over with so they could concentrate on the rest of the evening.  Harry nodded.
Draco took it and the pair shook.  Harry couldn’t help notice that the shake seemed to linger a bit longer than necessary.  He wasn’t at all certain which of the two of them was responsible for sustaining it. Not that Harry was complaining.
The words alone were enough to arouse Draco’s cock to its full potential.  The pair couldn’t remove their clothes fast enough, tossing them carelessly about.  Harry sifted through the pile to find his wand and performed a charm on himself.
“I only wanted to say before that I’m sorry,” Seamus said, surprising Harry.  “I’m sorry for teasing you about Malfoy. I wouldn’t have done it if I knew it was true.  At least I’m assuming it’s true, or you would have thumped him good.”
The pair walked in silence down to the Potions office.  Harry had taken a peek into Snape’s former quarters when he straightened up the classroom.  He remembered thinking it would take months to make it livable.
He pulled his jumper over his head while he walked into the bedroom.  He tossed it aside and stood over Draco, smiling.  After removing his shoes, he unbuttoned his trousers and let them fall to his ankles before stepping out of them.
The Healer walked in, holding out his hand. “Auror Potter.  Pleased to meet you.  I’m Healer Morgan.”
Ron laughed.  “Maybe you should pick some wildflowers, too.  What the bloody hell has happened to us? When did we become such saps?”
Harry blushed.  “I knew I shouldn’t have worn this.”  He tried to scoot behind the table but Draco blocked his way.  Harry backed up, feeling warm from Draco’s proximity.
“I don’t care.  You brought me dinner and chocolate roses,” Harry smiled.  “And you saved me from tearing my hair out tonight at Ron and Hermione’s.”
Not one to disappoint, Draco worshipped Harry, leisurely kissing him everywhere while his fingers loosened him up. The Gryffindor relaxed and allowed himself to be poked and prodded until Draco gently pushed his legs far apart.
He wasn’t planning on becoming emotional.  He didn’t even recognize his own voice in speaking to his mother.
“He hasn’t called me mudblood in years.  And, truthfully, I felt sort of sorry for him sixth year.  He was always brooding and miserable looking.  And then of course, he helped you in his family’s manor.  It seems as though he was never much of a willing participant in all the Dark Lord’s plans.”
Ignoring his embarrassment, Hermione pushed forward. “You have several options available to you.  It only depends on whether you want to adopt, or have a biological child.”
Glad that his classes were over for the day, he made his way to the Great Hall for supper.  He was a little early, but he brought a copy of the Prophet to read in peace before most of the students arrived.
“Oh, yes.  He’s been great.  I was so inexperienced, and he’s had to be so patient with me.”  Harry hesitated telling her the importance of the night before, but once they began talking about it, he wanted to tell her everything.  He lowered his voice and leaned forward a bit.  “Last night was the first time we . . . you know, actually shagged.”
“There are those that would disagree. I’ve heard that squibs are nature’s way of telling a wizard couple they shouldn’t procreate.”
“Well, there is nothing wrong with it,” Narcissa told him. “Did any of their homely daughters snag a prize like Harry Potter? No, only our Draco.  Only he is good enough for the Chosen One.”
Ron shook his head.  “I was just looking for a little . . . spice, you know?  But I was looking for it in the wrong place. I never should have gone to that bloody party.”
Harry looked at his pile of research papers. “Well, you’ve already distracted me.  I may as well take a proper break.”
But Harry knew, most likely, he would end up sleeping on the sofa again for fear of waking Draco if he got into bed.
Harry tried to clear his head but couldn’t.  The alcohol was making it impossible to resist the charm or to string together an honest, yet vague answer.
Ron shrugged.  “She was cleared years ago.  Now she’s an ordinary citizen in need of protection.”  Ron gave Harry a sideways glance. “Of course, it doesn’t hurt that her son is dating the Chosen One.”
Draco gently pushed the boy back and lifted his chin up. “You don’t look so bad.  Why don’t you go into the lavatory and splash some water on your face?  You need to pull yourself together.”
“It was just a thought,” Draco said.  “I didn’t mean to upset you.”  He rested his hand on Harry’s knee.
Draco blinked in disbelief. “Me?” Most wizards still saw him as the pureblood rich boy standing in Daddy’s shadow. Few knew him as Harry did. A man struggling to overcome his upbringing, rather than relying on it.
Draco continued on into his common room, wondering what on Earth Harry ever saw in her.  He found his dormitory door locked already and sighed.  Blaise and Harper didn’t waste any time.  Resigned to sleeping on a couch, Draco got ready for bed and settled on the one nearest the fire.  As he watched the flames dance, he thought back on the evening. Harry referred to him as the best-looking boy at Hogwarts.  He wondered if he really meant that.  Not that Draco was falsely modest.  He knew he was quite attractive.  He also knew that he had little to do with that.  His looks came from his exceptionally handsome father.  But Harry seemed truly surprised and embarrassed that Draco would say the same of him.
“I haven’t given it any thought,” Harry said.  “I only have a week to come up with a costume.  How are you dressing up?”
Saying nothing in reply, Harry resumed gazing out the window.  He said nothing more than a few words at a time the rest of the trip to King’s Cross Station.
As Greyback fell to the floor, a large section of the ceiling finally gave way, burying him in several feet of debris and furniture from the room above. Harry stood watching as the last bits settled on the pile.  Although he’d had permission to use deadly force, encouraged even, Harry felt empty.  After so much death and destruction during the Battle of Hogwarts, any loss of life was regrettable.
“You know, if Harry’s book is successful, neither one of you may need to go back to teaching,” Hermione said. “And muggle movies are big business.  You could become quite wealthy.”
“No,” she pouted.  She patted the bed beside her.  He shook his head.  “Aw, come on, Dra.  I won’t bite.  Unless you want me to,” Pansy grinned.
“You wish,” Harry retorted as he unbuttoned his own shirt. He gently turned Draco’s upper body toward him and pressed their chests together, making sure not to squeeze his side too much. He wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling Draco’s jumper on top of them to hold in the heat generated by Harry.
Harry blushed slightly and smiled.  “That’s good to know.  I hope I didn’t do anything else stupid.”
“I think I said tempestuous,” Harry breathed back, grinding his backside into Draco’s cock.  “Come on, do it.”
Looking up, Harry saw that Draco had the box open. Inside lay the tie pin from the second-hand shop.
Harry nodded.  He looked down at his tie and pointed to the gold tie pin in the middle. “Remember the tie pin I bought and the story behind it?”
“Can’t.  I have duty all this weekend.  The professors have been taking turns being available on weekends to students and heading up detentions.  This is my weekend.  Harry has next weekend.  How about then?”
“No, I need you to be there.  I’ll talk to Minerva.  I’m sure she’ll understand. She always has some long winded speech to make before the sorting begins anyway.”
“I know this isn’t the sort of place you would normally go. We don’t have to stay if you don’t want to.”
Grinning, the Slytherin pushed Harry onto his back and returned the favor.  In the back of Harry’s mind, he couldn’t help wondering how it would feel if Draco’s cock were inside him, rather than his fingers. He thought he should like to find out.  Perhaps not that night, but soon.
Trying to hide his gratification, Harry suggested they find Hermione and go to the Three Broomsticks for lunch.
Smiling tentatively, Harry said, “Still, perhaps it’s time to get rid of these.”  He picked up his glasses from where they had been tossed earlier.
Throughout the period, Draco walked about the room, peering into cauldrons, inspecting technique, and occasionally advising, in order to avoid disaster.  To his surprise, Montague’s potion didn’t explode or take on a life of its own.  It actually seemed to work.
“Let me put it this way.  If you do not cooperate, the Ministry will do everything in its power to retrieve Harry. That includes destroying the Manor if necessary.  And Draco’s safety will not be guaranteed.”
“Looks like Zabini’s not here.  Mind if I sit?  Ron’s partnering with Hermione today.”  Inside, Harry was a bowl of jelly.  Was he being too obvious?  He was screwed for partners if Draco turned him down for appearances sake.
The broad smile on Knox’s face faded as he took in Harry’s expression.  At first, he thought perhaps Draco and Harry had fought, and the object of his crush was coming to him for comfort.  But the thin-lipped frown on Harry’s face told him that was not the case.
“Don’t worry,” Stephen answered.  “I won’t come anywhere near you from now on.”  Mandy began to follow him into the Great Hall.
Harry let out a Sherry sweetened breath that Draco was close enough to feel on his face.  He felt pinned in place by Draco’s gaze and remained statue-like.
Meanwhile, Draco lay in the afterglow of their lovemaking.  He loved Harry so much his heart ached.  He decided then and there that nothing--not Rita Skeeter, not his or Harry’s friends, not even his insecurities--was going to keep them apart.
“It appears to be some sort of diary or love letters.  Something to that affect,” Draco answered.  “But I can’t open it.”
Being as observant as she was, Hermione noticed. However, she waited until they were comfortably settled in the library to bring up the subject.
Draco quickly covered his mouth with his hand to smother a gasp.  What the fuck was Knox talking about?
“Thank you, Poppy, but we’re fine,” Draco replied.  “I think it’s best if you let us tend to it.”  He urged the house elf to leave before his mother became too irate and took it out on her.
“Are you suggesting we not go out into the public?  Do you think we can live here in the shelter of the Manor the rest of our lives?”  Draco sipped his tea and took a small bite of scone.  “You know, Professor McGonagall told me the same thing once.  She told me there would always be people like Terry Boot out there.”
“Oi,” Ron called to the clerk.  “Can you tell me anything about this bracelet?  Do you know who owned it before?”
“What whole thing?” Ron was beginning to think he was better off back with an overly friendly Draco.
The butterflies in his stomach grew more persistent as he waited for Draco to arrive.  When at last the Potions room door opened, he could barely refrain from pouncing on Draco.
“I’m not Pansy,” Harry said, inferring that Draco was so hurt by his former girlfriend that he wasn’t going to let that happen to him again.
“That’s all well and good,” Ron interrupted.  “We all did things we regret.  But how can you forget?  He called Hermione mudblood for years.”
“But she would never find a better man, or someone who knows her the way you do.  The pair of you really do complement each other.”
Shaking his head, Draco answered, “Not specifically.  During his servitude among the Death Eaters, Father acquired many dangerous items.  But he kept them hidden from Mother and me.  At least he had the good sense to try and protect us.  In his own way.”
Writhing beneath Harry, Draco panted, “I’m gonna fucking cum.”  He held his breath for a moment, then called out Harry’s name as he exhaled.
Though Harry thought it unusual for Ginny to want to speak to him in secrecy, he wasn’t particularly concerned.
“Okay.”  Harry kissed Draco’s cheek.  “Only a few more days and the term will be over.  And we’ll have all summer with them.  Now go to bed.”
“And Mr. Malfoy, I hope there are no ill feelings between us,” Skeeter smirked.  “Coincidence that you are once again in the middle of a sex scandal?”
“They say there’s a thin line between love and hate,” Ron raised his glass to toast.  “I suppose you and Ma--, damn it, Draco, have proven that.”
“The Ministry never stops checking up,” Harry said.  “But as long as Lucius stays on the up and up, they’ll leave him alone.”
Blaise huffed.  “As if that’s not the whole point of the game.  Of course you’re supposed to have sex.”
She bit her lip.  She hadn’t actively planned to spend the night in Ron’s bed before.  It wasn’t as if they’d never had sex.  She and Ron booted Harry out of the room plenty of times.  But this was the first time she was thinking about spending the entire night with him.  And waking up with him.  It seemed a big step to her.  Even though Harry had already spent the night with Draco and they’d been seeing each other for a much shorter time.  And it appeared that Pansy was going stay, and she wasn’t even dating Seamus.
“I didn’t mean it like that.  I have a hard time understanding why you don’t believe me when I say I love you, and only you.”
“There’s no time to be coy when you have limited alone time,” Harry laughed. “Just put a little effort into it.  I promise you, it’ll pay off.”
“That should be interesting,” Harry said.  His hand moved from Draco’s shoulder to the small of his back.
Harry let out a whimper, then a loud grunt as he came, still pushing his hips steadily into Draco’s arse. The Potions professor soon followed, spilling himself onto the headboard in front of him, as well as Harry’s hand.  His legs gave out a moment later and he collapsed back into Harry.
“So, I appreciate you not making a fuss over Draco sitting with your daughter.  He really is a changed man.”
“I said, it’s a bit drafty in here, don’t you think?  Perhaps you ought to cover up.”  His eyes traveled down to Harry’s pants, which had gaped open a bit when he sat cross legged on the floor.  Right in front of the poor blushing girl.
“What did your father tell you?” Harry asked curiously.  When Draco hesitated, he continued.  “You don’t have to tell me.  That’s between you and Lucius.”
They walked onto a staircase that moved unexpectedly to the right and dropped them off in a dark corridor.
“Harry.  Is everything all right?” Knox asked, on the off-chance Draco was the reason for the scowl.
“Good.  Not much different from last year.  Except for the Potion’s professor, of course.”  He wanted to kick himself for opening up the conversation to a subject he was hoping to avoid with his friends.  He didn’t want to be in a position to defend his new friend for fear of revealing his true feelings.
“I want to shower with you. Now.” The vision of Draco dripping wet from the day before was still fresh in Harry’s mind.
Hours later, Liam, Harry’s fictional teen, was about to ask a certain blond to accompany him to a school dance.  Harry had written the blond in great detail--from the sparkling grey eyes and alabaster skin, to the full pink lips and willowy figure.  Deciding no one else would ever read the tome, Harry named the object of Liam’s desires Drake.  He went back into the story to fill in the spaces he had left blank to write ‘he’ or ‘she’.
Harry sat silently for a while, thinking about what McGonagall told him.  The letter seemed sincere.  And if the headmistress kept in touch with Malfoy all these years, perhaps he had changed.  But that didn’t necessarily mean that Harry wanted to see him every day or work with him.
Seamus made a face at Ron and left for breakfast.  Ron had grown into a strapping young man and Seamus was no match for him.
As the professor made his way around the room, Casper watched.  When Draco stopped at Penelope Pipshaw’s cauldron, he glanced over at the boy and smiled.  Blushing, Casper looked down and pretended to study his notes.
he want Daphne to tell anyone?  He was free to do as he pleased, after all. Who didn’t Harry want to know about it?  And he couldn’t keep the disturbing question out of his mind-- was it simply a coincidence of timing, or did he cum because he thought about Malfoy?
Draco cracked open the hard cookie and took out the small piece of paper.  He frowned a little, then read, “You cannot love the life you live until you live the life you love.”
While Draco magically locked the door and set a silencing charm, Harry conjured up a soft pad and a few pillows.  They set their things aside and sat down.
When class was dismissed, Draco got up to leave alone, and Harry walked back to Ron and Hermione’s table.
Ron sighed.  “Yes, rumors of him turning snitch is what seemed to prompt the letters and attack on your mother.  But the demands he’s made are too unreasonable for the Minister to come to an agreement.  I think the deal on the table is fair.”
“If I didn’t know better, Potter, I’d think you were trying to take advantage of me,” Draco joked, teeth chattering.
“All right then, if nobody here wants to speak to Harry Potter, then I suppose I can find another paper who’d like an exclusive.”
“I’ll miss you,” Draco said, reminded of their goodbyes at Christmastime. He hoped their time apart would be less eventful than before.
Harry eyes widened and his mouth dropped open.  For as subtle as Harry thought he had been, Draco picked up on everything.  And now he was calling him on it.
“Nah, I’m tired,” Ron said, stretching his arms over his head.  He wasn’t especially tired.  In fact, he was quite wound up from the games he played against Draco and he needed to burn off some of that adrenaline.  Preferably, with Hermione.
“Nothing has,” Ron told him.  “At least not from where I’m standing.  And frankly, Harry, I’ve sort of suspected it for a while.”
Harry laughed.  “I’ll give you that.  But we can avoid them.  Just come on a couple of rides with me.  If you hate them, I promise I won’t drag you on anymore.  There are a few shows you might enjoy, sort of like theater.”
When he came, he groaned into her mouth while clear spurts covered both their chests. Anthony collapsed on the bed, spent.
“Then perhaps I should be lying down,” the blond whispered. He leaned forward and brushed hips lips against Harry’s. The Auror closed his eyes and tilted his head slightly, deepening the kiss. He set the potion down and placed his hands on Draco’s hips.
“I will,” he swallowed.  The passion had begun to wane and he was forced to pull out.  “I need to, um, get back to, uh . . . just give me a minute.”  He stroked himself to get back to his earlier state while he gazed upon Tracey’s nude form.  She was rather curvy and appealing in the light of the Lumos spell he cast earlier.
Ron chuckled.  “It wasn’t repressed sexual tension for me.  I really hated the prat.  If what you said is true, it actually makes me feel better about things.  I’m not saying I trust him completely or anything.  But I suppose your theory sort of makes sense.”
Harry blushed.  “I don’t know.  I didn’t think you’d be interested.  And I was afraid.  So now what?”
“Hello Harry.  Malfoy,” Knox said, standing his ground after all, yet looking a bit beaten down.  His physical wounds were long healed.  But his emotional ones were still very much fresh.  Losing Harry, or rather not being able to win him over in the first place, was bad enough.  Finding out his parents were not the people he thought they were, had left him shellshocked.
The group finished their meal with light conversation. Harry marveled at the lack of tension among them. The other three, anyway. He was nervous about the four of them sitting together, certain that there would be nothing to talk about. Ron had dealt with Draco on a professional level several times, yet Harry was still surprised that they were able to get past the animosity that had been between them for so long. Five years of maturity went a long way.
He placed his hand in hers and watched in awe as she scrutinized every line and curve of his large, yet delicate hand.
Two weeks earlier than expected, Harry and Draco found themselves sitting in chairs at St. Mungo’s, anxiously awaiting the birth of Ron and Hermione’s first child, along with several members of the Weasley clan.
“Poppy,” Narcissa called out.  A small house elf appeared by her side, wearing what looked to be a lamp shade.  “Fetch us some tea, would you?”
The journal left it as it was.  Harry smiled to himself.  He knew why it didn’t matter to him.  The journal knew all along, but it took Harry a while.
The pair continued to nibble at the miniature feast before them as they talked. Every so often a breeze blew through the Tower, causing the candle to flicker.  Harry had begun to get a little chilly and cast a light warming spell on them.  After a short time, Draco, who had dressed properly for the occasion, was too warm, and rolled up his sleeves.  Subconsciously, as he went on about how much he disliked the new Dark Arts professor, Draco unbuttoned a few buttons on his shirt.  In the dim light, his navy shirt bloused open revealing his starkly contrasted pale chest, distracting Harry from the conversation.
Draco continued. “I volunteered, remember. You don’t have anything to feel guilty about. I’m glad you weren’t hurt. It wouldn’t do for both of us to be gimps,” he snickered.
Draco got up and walked to Harry, putting his hands on his shoulders.  “All right.  It’s just habit.  I’ll try.”  He bent down and hugged Harry.  “Are you upset with me?”
The men both looked at her.  “We haven’t narrowed it down yet,” Harry told her.  “We thought we had a bit more time,” he chuckled.
“It’s not as if it was your doing.  Don’t feel sorry for me, Potter,” Draco said bitterly.  He picked up the bottle and drank directly from it.  Harry snatched it out of his hand and did the same.
“She didn’t mention your interest in men, however,” Althea commented, taking a sip of her wine.  She continued in response to Harry’s blank expression. “Forgive me, but I couldn’t help notice the way you’ve been admiring the young man two tables away.”
“Uh,” Harry hesitated. “Just curious. Draco asked about it. He has his own place, but with his parents missing, the Manor is his responsibility.”
The color drained from Draco’s face.  It was bad enough what he’d said to her.  But she didn’t even hear it, and now he was in a position to have to say it to her again.  His mind raced, trying to come up with an alternative.  However, she already knew it must have been offensive enough for him to bring a gift in apology.
Harry’s moans urged Draco on, his hands wandering as much of Harry’s body as he could reach.  He felt Harry’s hand on his back, clutching at his shirt.  Draco turned his head enough to see the Gryffindor’s face as he groaned and grunted in time with Draco’s sucking.  Harry’s eyes were closed and his mouth agape.  He looked divinely blissful to the Slytherin prince.
“He’s been through a lot lately.  I don’t want to make waves. And we truly are happy.  I feel . . . never mind.” Harry gave an embarrassed little laugh.
Dean brushed Ginny’s cheek with his hand.  “I know I didn’t treat you that well when I had the chance.”
Harry laughed. “Nothing was going to be able to stop me.” He reached out for Draco’s shoulder. “But I would have been more careful. I didn’t mean to make you cry.”
“Oh, they’re quite nice.  And roomy.  Roomier than mine at any rate.  Perfect for entertaining . . . er, that is if you have someone, I mean . . .”  Harry rolled his eyes at his own inappropriateness, probing in to Malfoy’s personal life.
“She’s fully recovered now,” Draco said, not exactly accepting the apology but acknowledging it at least.
Draco shrugged his shoulders.  “I should liked to have been a Potions Master at the Apothecary.  But I doubt he would take on a former Death Eater as an apprentice.  Or a Healer. There’s a fair bit of potion making in that.”
“Oh, right.  Are you chaperoning the dance?” Harry asked, noticing that he was in dress robes, though, not haute couture, as Draco’s were.
“So,” Neville began after taking a large gulp of butter beer. “You and Tracey Davis?  What’s she like?”
“You do waddle a bit, love.” Dean kissed her cheek as she sat down at the table for lunch.  “But you look radiant.”
“I didn’t say that,” Harry cut him off and pulled him closer in order to kiss him.  “It would be so easy for us to shut ourselves off from everyone else.  I could spend the rest of my life locked in the bedroom with you.”
“Yes.  I’ve realized that you’re right.  I like our life the way it is.  You are all I need to be happy.”
“There’s plenty of time to get two more shags in.”  Harry glanced at the clock.  “It’s only half-seven.”
Olivia sat down at a small round table.  In front of her were a deck of Tarot cards, a pot of tea and two cups, and a crystal ball.
“Not them, you.  I’m quite certain Hermione noticed the tent my trousers have now become.” He blushed.  “You’re lucky our room is just down the hall, or I’d take you right here and now.”
sexual orientation is affecting his status in prison.  He’s in solitary for the time being.  For his
In moments, both were fast asleep, not knowing it would be the last time they would get to sleep together for quite a while.
Hermione picked up two fortune cookies and tossed them to Harry and Draco.  She handed one back to Ron.
Ron laughed.  “I don’t think so.  No way in hell you would ever let anyone win.  I don’t think you would even let Harry win.”
Harry was beginning to regret their position.  “I can’t reach you this way.  I want to touch you.”  He eased out, intending to roll Draco over onto his back.
Draco watched and listened from his place in the corner.  It seemed whenever his family brought up the subject, there was always a hint of disgust or disappointment, especially from his father. Rita Skeeter’s articles about him didn’t help any.  As he sat, apart from the others, he wondered if Harry’s adopted family had read those articles and had a good laugh at Draco’s expense.
“I think that was her way of letting me know I could, without actually telling me.  Come on.” Ron took Harry by the sleeve and dragged him until they caught up with Hermione.
“They want to make sure we can pay the fee, most likely.  It won’t be a problem.” Draco frowned, glancing down at the next question.  “Perhaps we should have gone with a muggle agency after all.”
“I don’t know about Harry, but Justin Finch-Fletchley is sporting a fine set,” Parvati laughed.  The girls turned toward the entrance as he walked in, literally with his tail between his legs.
The boys looked at one another and burst out laughing.  “Nothing, luv.  Just guy stuff,” Ron said and kissed her cheek.
“I wasn’t planning on it,” Harry smirked.  “Although, I know several spells I doubt the guards would even detect.  Being a former Auror does have its perks.”
“Well, four months is a long time, considering we used to see each other every weekend before you started at Hogwarts,” she pointed out.  “By the way, how is it going this year?”
“Mione, Harry and I broke up over three weeks ago.  I’m with Dean now.  If there was ever a person who deserved to be happy, it’s Harry. I just hope this girl is better than Daphne or Pansy.”
It occurred to Harry that he’d never really had much conversation with Pansy.  Of course, it could have been because she was more than willing to sacrifice him to Voldemort to save her own hide.  But he never took much notice of her.  She was always the girl by Malfoy’s side.  Nothing more. Just a girl. But he liked girls, didn’t he?  He could prove it.  Hermione didn’t know what she was talking about.
“I . . .” Harry let out a small chuckle.  “I kept expecting to hear a baby cry.  I had a hard time concentrating.” He turned to face Draco.  “How pathetic is that?”
However, Harry’s chief reason for staying was not to intrude on what promised to be a difficult Christmas break for the family.  Ron had been melancholy lately and Ginny appeared to have been crying several times.  Harry sometimes felt guilty for being happy when so many other families were going through such sad times.
Draco watched his chest rise and fall and fall slowly for a bit, then his gaze traveled up Harry’s body to his neck, which was sporting the blush of a love bite left by Draco.  Black stubble covered his upper neck and chin, as the DADA professor hadn’t bothered to shave since Friday morning.  Draco found the roughness a sexy contrast to Harry’s usual boy-next-door good looks.
Gently pushing Harry back onto the fluffy mattress, Draco continued to smooch his lover as he lay on top of him.  He felt Harry’s hand in his hair.  Although there were places more erotic to be touched, Draco enjoyed the intimate way Harry’s fingers twined around the baby fine strands. The blond wanted to do the same, but instead began to unbutton Harry’s shirt.  Halfway down, he noticed that Harry was kissing him with less enthusiasm.
Draco looked down at the outstretched hand and tentatively took it.  “Mr. Weasley,” he said contritely.
“Didn’t you notice?  Harry got all flustered at one point, then simply tossed his potion together and left,” she told him.  “He couldn’t wait to get out of here.”
Draco sighed and silently berated himself for his moony-eyed behavior.  Malfoys were the sort to be sought after, not the one to follow others like a puppy dog.  He couldn’t help himself around Harry.  Draco had never felt the need to reassure a lover before.  But he didn’t want to let this one get away.
A waitress holding menus stopped in front of Harry and smiled.  “Would you like your usual table? You can fit four.”
“For the whole weekend?  I don’t think so,” Draco chuckled.  “How about tea on Saturday?  An hour or two may be all we can take of Mother.”  Draco paused.  “Are you sure you want to do that?”
“Of course you could. You kept bugging me about the books,” Ron announced. “That’s all you talked about. How many books, what kinds, were they being cared for properly.”
A few more questions were asked and then, strangely enough, they began talking amongst themselves.  Seamus made his way closer to Pansy, who seemed to be back to her usual flirty self.  Ginny and Blaise talked academics, while Harper left Blaise’s side to offer his services to Hermione.  At first she was insulted, but when she found out that he was the one who did Parvati’s hair, she gave him a second listen.
Harry pulled back and smiled at her.  “You’re right, Gin.  You always were so smart.”  He stood upright.  “Dean, good luck.”
Harper nodded.  “I guess I shouldn’t have said anything.  He doesn’t feel the same way.  And now he’s trying to get as far away from me as possible.”
“I don’t know what your intentions were for attending the party, but now that we’ve been paired up again . . . I was thinking perhaps we could give it another go,” Ginny proposed.
don’t think anyone thought that before,” Parvati snickered, bringing Romilda’s honour into question.
Harry took a deep breath and smiled. “I would place a ring on your finger and talk about what it means to me, to give you a piece of my family history, and how proud I am to have you wear it.  But you refused to take it off once I gave it to you. So I guess I’ll skip that part.” He tapped his family ring on Draco’s finger.
Draco laughed out loud, and his mother, though she tried her best to refrain, could not help but join in.
“What about this?”  Harry asked, holding up an old, battered copy of poetry written by some obscure wizard.  He was ready to toss it into the trash pile before getting Malfoy’s answer.
She giggled again, still in the clouds from the wedding, and placed her hand over her belly. “No, I suppose not.”
The train pulled out of the station as Harry, Ron, Ginny and Hermione sat in a private compartment.  Molly Weasley was loathe to put her two youngest on the train, but they begged and whinged until she finally gave in.  Well, Ginny begged and whinged.  Ron had to be convinced by his girlfriend, Hermione.  The dynamics of the group had changed since they shared a kiss and finally acknowledged their feelings.  Their romance burned fast and furiously at first, the result of years of pent up attraction.  But now, months later, they bickered as much, if not more, than they used to and things they found endearing about each other were becoming annoying.  Hermione sensed the end of the courtship was imminent, but neither wanted to be the first to put it to words.  The four sat silently in the compartment, looking out the window.  Ginny put her hand on top of Harry’s.
Harry’s head snapped up.  “What?  No.  Ginny, I swear.  When we broke up, I didn’t even know . . .” He trailed off.  His shoulder slumped a bit.  “I’m gay, Gin.  But I was confused, and I didn’t realize it back then.  And I am seeing Draco.”
Once the room was sufficiently lit, Harry rummaged around in a desk drawer for the key to the room.  “Aha, here it is.  I think.”
“Do you feel up to making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside?” Draco leered. “But you have to promise to stop thinking about babies, and concentrate on me,” he smirked.
Harry waited for most of his House to leave before he began to get ready for the Halloween dance.  Earlier in the evening, Hermione helped him with his clothing and glasses.  It had been difficult for him to spend the past hour without them, but he didn’t want to wear his mask in front of anyone.
Ms. Singleton lined up several interviews with potential candidates within a few weeks. And Harry and Draco found themselves once again in the offices of Progeny by Proxy. They’d met several witches, all with similar physical and less tangible qualities that Harry and Draco were looking for.
Harry shook his head.  “If I have to choose between Draco and children, I choose Draco.  I know I’m happy with him.  I can’t say for certain I’d be happy as a parent.”
Arthur was already sitting at the head of the table, with Draco on his left.  He had been telling the Weasley patriarch about Slughorn’s dinner party.  Arthur was very interested in the new book Miranda Goshawk was putting together.
“Yes,” Harry grinned.  He wiggled the noodle and let it brush against Draco’s lower lip.  “Come on,” he teased, giving a pleading, puppy dog look.
“He’s not worth it Terry,” Cornfoot warned.  “You don’t want two months of detention.  It’s enough to break them up.”
“Well, I’ve heard stories of very powerful wizards performing it themselves, but it’s safer if done by a third party.  That way, it’s more controlled.”
At the moment, however, all of that melted away as he moved in sync with the man he loved.  He could feel, through their joined magic, all the love Draco was feeling.  The emotions were nearly overwhelming, and Harry knew that if he chose, he would never be truly alone again.
“I told you, it was my choice.  And stop trying to make this about my parents.  Your father is the one in question.  And your mother’s family-- blimey, the whole lot of them is Dark as they come. And so are you.  You’ll never be good enough for Harry.”
Sensing that Harry had a reason for wanting to switch, she agreed and sat down next to Ron.  Harry waited for someone else to sit next to Ginny, as he knew someone would.  She was very good in potions.  As soon as Hannah Abbott took the seat next to Ginny, Harry turned and pretended to look around for a partner.
Turning to Harry, Draco nodded.  Harry smiled at the way his nose and cheeks had become pink form the cold.  He kissed each cheek and the tip of his nose to warm them slightly, then kissed his lips.  They were cold as well, and Harry had more fun warming them up.
“It’s gold and platinum,” Harry said, smiling.  He debated telling Draco the story behind it but decided against it. He was pleased that Draco seemed to really like it.
That left Luna and Neville, Ginny and Dean, and Harry and Draco as the only real pairs remaining from the wand game.
Grinning, Blaise looked pleased to be able to hold something over Draco’s head. “Hm.  Let’s see. What
“Uh, huh,” Harry muttered.  There was no going back.  His intentions toward Draco were verbalized.  He had been thinking of Draco in the throes of passion and there was no other explanation.  Harry was, at the very least,
Harry was touched.  Most people were supportive of his decision to become an Auror.  It was almost a certainty, given who he was.  But deep within himself, he wasn’t sure of his motives.  Draco had questioned them the night they first met in the Astronomy Tower.  There were many decisions and paths Harry was taking because he thought he was supposed to.  Draco had caused him to question them all.
“You don’t owe me any explanation, Harry,” Cummins said. “So,” he looked at the chart.  “Is this what you were asking me about last week?  You want to find out which of you boys is the baby’s father?”
They sat in the Astronomy Tower with the stars above them on the unusually clear night. Ron had cast a warming spell around them as it had become quite chilly.
After supper, Harry walked alone back to the second floor attempting to convince himself that Draco wasn’t all that attractive.  There was no need for Harry to be behaving like a silly school boy.  He was almost to his quarters when he heard foot steps behind him.
“You’d think.  Like I said, price is a factor.  But you probably wouldn’t want a garish two carat blue diamond set in yellow gold.  Your hands are small and delicate.  A ring like that would overpower you.  A man asking for your hand should know what suits you.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Harry said instead.  “I don’t know them either. And if I’m going to spend any time in Slytherin . . .”
“Yes. I went up to your quarters but you weren’t there,” Harry explained.  “I wanted to see you so badly that I considered searching for you.”
The Gryffindor poured some lube on his fingers and got to work.  Though he knew part of the reason Draco squirmed was the initial discomfort, he enjoyed the way he writhed under his touch.  Soon, Draco was prepared as much as he would be.
“Don’t be discouraged.  It’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Tifft told him.  “It’s . . . somewhat fuzzy in the middle.  You see, down here, where it begins?”  Draco nodded.  “It’s quite clear.  Your fate seems written in stone, so to speak.”
Turning to Harry, Draco gave a smile.  “It’s not out of the blue.  My mother has been owling me.  I told you she wants me come back to live in the Manor when–” He cut himself short, realizing it was still a difficult subject for the pair of them.  “Anyway, I’ll be back tonight.”
“Do you truly want her back?” Ginny asked Ron.  “Because I wonder why you went to that party at all, if you genuinely love her.”
Unable to lie and stare at the ceiling any longer, Harry quietly got up, showered and dressed for the day.  Instead of regular clothing, Harry dressed in a fresh pair of flannel plaid pajamas. Christmas was definitely a day to lounge around.  He went to the common room and started a fire. By then, his stomach began to growl, and he wanted Draco to wake up so they could get to breakfast.  Only a handful of other students were in the castle, along with a few professors, and breakfast wouldn’t linger.
“Well, the amusement park for one, but probably not until he’s a bit older.  There’s always the zoo, and parks, and Quidditch matches.  Picnicking in the countryside, skiing in the Alps, and maybe we’ll even get to the Grand Canyon in America someday.”
“My back is killing me,” she stretched and yawned.  “I need to remember to bring pillows or something next time.”
Dominique startled awake, took one look at Draco and began to cry. Fat tears rolled down her cheeks as her eyes shut tightly. The look of panic on Draco’s face may have been funny under different circumstances.
The brunet slowly looked into the Slytherin’s eyes, certain he knew what Draco was going to ask him.
“Actually, I shrunk them onto myself,” Draco admitted.  “Don’t ask me to bend over.  I’m sure they’ll rip to shreds if I do,” he laughed.
“Did you really live under the stairs at your aunt and uncle’s house before you came to Hogwarts?” Draco chuckled quietly.  “Or is that just a rumor?”
Though she tried to pry Romilda’s hand from her arm, Padma couldn’t escape and had no choice but to follow her sister’s friend toward the boys.
When he got to Slytherin, he gave the password he’d given many times before.  Never had he been quite so anxious.  Draco had been so preoccupied with whether or not Harry would still want him, he never considered the real possibility that Draco himself would fall out of love without the game’s influence.  Harry had not only considered it, it had become his biggest fear.  He had no idea how Draco had spent the time since Harry had left him.
Draco grasped Harry’s hand and pulled him to a room at the top of the stairs.  He opened the door and before it even closed again, he had Harry’s trousers unzipped and halfway to the ground.
Standing, Harry shook his head. “No. Miss Gwilt made me promise to give you your potions. All of them.” He walked to the kitchenette and retrieved a bottle filled with light green liquid. When he turned around, Draco was standing right in front of him.
Draco shook his head. “It’s too early for another potion. Skelegro just hurts like the dickens. There’s no getting around it.”
Draco swallowed his mouthful.  “You seem to be under the impression that being unusually tidy makes me a girl.  Like most of what I do, I eat like any other man.”
“Neville and I just happened to be coming back from one of the greenhouses.  Professor Sprout said we could take some cuttings with us to start our own herb gardens,” Draco explained. “I’m going to set up a terrarium in our place so I can have fresh herbs for potion making,” he told Harry excitedly.
“I am.  I do,” Harry said, snapping out of his daze.  “You didn’t misread me.”  He figured the best way to convince Draco that he had been right about Harry was to kiss him back.
Harry suddenly realized that Draco didn’t know the tie pin’s history.  His question must have come across as forward and presumptuous.
Trying his hardest not to roll his eyes, Harry sighed.  He could see that Draco was hurt, but frankly, he thought Draco was being unreasonable.
Not bothering to answer, Harry got to work on his end.  The angle was a bit awkward at first.  But when he pushed Draco on to his side, they each had better leverage.
Draco pulled back.  “Sweet Merlin, you expect me to expose my pale bum to the sun? Not to mention my bits.”  He subconsciously covered the front of his trousers with his hand.
She smiled.  “You wouldn’t be. I want to.  It was my idea.”  She reached out her hand for his. “I like you.  Do you like me?”
Draco sighed heavily and reached out for his wand, next to him. “It’s damaged worse than Weasley’s, I’m afraid,” he joked.  In his outstretched hand were the pieces of his wand.
A few days after Ron and Hermione’s visit, Draco was feeling pretty good about the way things were going.  He felt he made real progress toward friendship with the pair.  Plus, he was able to relax knowing that the Ministry was taking the threats against his mother seriously.  He’d slept better in the past couple nights than he had since Knox became the Charms professor.
“No, I have actually changed in many ways.”  He laughed.  “But Harry can tell you, in some ways I am exactly the same. I’m still the jealous sort.”
Harry chuckled.  “I’m sure I would have done the same.  If Molly didn’t keep Ginny glued to her side after that.”
Throwing the paper across the table, Draco answered, “Someone told already.  I should have let you tell that Chittock woman after all.  At least she would have been objective.”
Walking up the narrow stairway, he nodded a greeting to one of their neighbors. He knocked on the door and waited. Hermione’s smile dropped when she opened the door.
With hands on hips, Hermione shook her head. “Ron are you purposely misunderstanding or are you really that thick?” She sighed and flopped into the chair Harry was previously occupying.
Draco was one flight up when he glanced down at the hallway from which he just came.  It was no surprise to see Knox making his way toward Harry’s room.
“McGonagall will never go for it, Harry.  She won’t want two heads of House gone.  Perhaps you should go alone.”
“Severus Snape?” Miranda echoed.  “Ooh, I bet it’s a nasty one,” she snickered.  “Harry, how is it you know of this?”
The witch looked around the room and down the hall. Only one Healer was in the reception area. “I’m really not supposed to let visitors in this late. But . . . I suppose I can make an exception for you.” She batted her eyelashes, not realizing that her charms were lost on him. Though he didn’t necessarily try to hide it, his sexual orientation was not common knowledge.
After Harry left, Hermione addressed Ron’s question.  “Malfoy’s been humiliated by the woman.  And now the attention is back on him, along with Harry.  Can’t you see how he’d be upset?”
“Fuck, yes,” Harry answered. Casting his inhibitions aside, he leaned forward and kissed Draco.  The blond tasted faintly of apple pie and Harry was eager to explore his mouth fully.
“No, Harry.  I wouldn’t have been able to do that.  Maybe in the beginning,” she confessed.  “But we would have told you. Eventually.”
She crossed her arms over her chest. “Your tumultuous history, for one.  Have you forgotten what he did to you Sixth Year?”
Harry slowly gained momentum, reaching between them to seize Draco’s cock. The discomfort was soon forgotten as pleasure washed over him. He allowed Harry whatever liberties he pleased, asserting himself only in the occasional kiss and to run his hands through Harry’s hair.
“Then what am I supposed to use?” Harry asked.  He knew Draco was right.  He meant to give the wand back, but he never got around to getting his own before school started.
“Well, your prank just might get Harry seriously injured.  Or worse.”  Draco began to walk toward the Headmistress’ chambers.
“I gave a false address to the post office.  Someone from the Ministry owlery picks up mail and sends it out to wizards’ real addresses.”
“Oh, Draco, I had no idea how affected you were.” Narcissa buried her face in her hands.  “I didn’t think you remembered.”
Draco nodded.  They both knew there was no point in wishing. After a brief silence, Draco got back to the original subject.
He stood in front of the Potions room, catching his breath after running the whole way.  Harry composed himself as best he could, then disengaged the charms on the door. Before stepping all the way in, Harry was seized by his tie and pulled against a firm body.
“Hmm.  Not a bad idea,” Terry agreed.  “Then we wouldn’t have to watch them slobber all over each other either.”
“Ron, I’m in love with him. Now, I know you’re not thrilled about it, but he loves me too.  You know that tie pin?  The one from the second-hand shop.  I gave it to him for Christmas.  I never expected it to open for him, but it did.  And, well, he said he loves me.  I know you don’t understand, and it seems like we’re moving incredibly fast.  But if I really think about it, I come to the conclusion that Draco and I have always been attracted to one another.  We could never leave each other alone.  If you truly hate someone, you avoid them, ignore them.  I think our repressed sexual tension came out as hate, because that was the only acceptable form for me at the time.”
“I think we’re going to have our food wrapped up and go back to Hogwarts, if you don’t mind,” Harry told his friends.
“Well, let’s see.  Blaise and Harper, Tracey and Goldstein, Looney-girl and Longbottom, Corner and one of the Patil sisters, Weasley and Granger.  Actually, they were already together.  But the game didn’t put pair them up.  And Dean Thomas and the Weasley girl.”  She almost mentioned Harry and Draco, and had to stop herself. “I think even Finnigan and Astoria are an item now. Maybe Daphne and Macmillan are together.  They got paired last time”
She harrumphed.  “So, now you’ve got Harry in on it?  I did come to apologize, but . . . are you even listening?”
Suddenly, Harry wasn’t so certain he wanted to continue the banter. “You wouldn’t dare.” He swiftly removed his hand from Draco’s leg.
Harry sat a moment, sending out his extra sensory magic link to Draco.  It was still there.  Closing his eyes, he could feel that Draco was down in the dungeons, most likely in his dormitory.
He froze in place as she took in a deep shuddered breath. He placed the toys on the floor in the corner and silently left the room.
Harry waited and watched the page. Nothing changed.  Well, it seemed the journal believed him or rather, Harry truly believed what he wrote.
“Mother will never find anyone good enough for her little boy,” Draco snickered.  “Not even the man who sacrificed his life and saved the entire wizarding world.  If anything, Mother, I’m not good enough for him.”  He paused and dropped his smile.  “Or is that what you were getting at?”
Harry was relieved in a way. One of them accidentally putting an arm around the other, or holding a hand, or kissing was the thing he feared most.  However, he thought it would be he himself that did it, not Draco.
“Ron!” Ginny scolded.  “You’re willing to spend the night with another girl?”  She saw the hurt on Hermione’s face.
The pair strolled through the gate, reset the wards and made their way into the castle.  It was a bit chilly outside, but Harry felt oddly warm.  The evening was perfectly lovely.  The Quidditch match was brilliant, conversation flowed smoothly, the food was enjoyable and the company was charming.  It was the best date Harry had ever been on.
Shaking his head, Draco smirked.  “Oh, grow some bollocks, would you.  You have a job prospect.  One that you got all on your own.”
name. Whether you like it or not, he’s under your skin.  Don’t wait too long to figure it out, Harry.”
Trying to sneak in, Harry skirted the perimeter of the room making his way to the refreshment table.  His plan was to stand behind the table for the majority of the night.
“Fuck, Daphne.  Why did you have to bring up Malfoy?” Harry grumbled.  “That’s the last thing I wanted to think about.”
“Oops,” Ron was shamefaced, but not enough to keep quiet.  “I was trying to figure out who she is, but he won’t tell.”  He glanced at a scowling Hermione.  “What?  They know already. What’s the harm in talking now?”
Draco added a third finger and pumped them in and out.  His other hand snaked around to Harry’s front, rubbing his torso from nipples to cock.
“No, you have to help me,” Harry pleaded. “What if I get too nervous or something and I can’t . . .”
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco sighed. “Even if she does retract it, people are going to believe what she wrote first.” He hung his head.
When the music slowed, Padma caught sight of her sister, still dancing with the same vampire.  She was pleased to see her having a good time and forgetting all about that stupid Michael Corner.
As he worked, Harry’s eyes often drifted to Malfoy.  He was busy working, but paused every so often, as if in deep thought.  Near the end of the class, Harry finally let go of his preoccupation with the events of Friday night.  He felt his potion was going well, but he was far behind many of the other students.
“Tomorrow morning for sure,” Harry said.  “Let’s hurry up and shower now, though.  I’m starving.  And besides, I want you good and randy so I can try that little trick on you tonight.”
As he watched the ginger boy walk with his friends, he smiled at the irony of fathering a redhead.  Growing up, he had despised the Weasleys and often made fun of their hair.  Having matured quite a bit since then, he found the colour to be rather like that of a summer sunset.  The woman who gave birth to the boy had similar hair, but Draco knew that Harry’s mother had auburn hair as well.
“You’re dismissed,” McGonagall told him.  She watched Draco as he scurried out of her chamber, a wide grin on his face.
“You’re brave to put yourself out there,” Duchess commented.  “There will be a lot of people who don’t understand.”
“Yes. Tomorrow, I’m supposed to go back to St. Mungo’s for a check up, where I presume they’ll give me the okay to go about my business.”
Some of the students gaped as they looked up, not necessarily believing the rumors that had spread.  Others had taken it in stride. Though Harry had come out publicly himself, he didn’t address his relationship with Draco to the student body at large. Regardless of the other students’ reactions, Harry and Draco decided it was best not to display too much affection in public.  Neither had done that with any of the girls they had been with and they weren’t going to start now.
“While you are entitled to your opinion, Mr. Goldstein, I do not condone violence at Hogwarts.”  The Headmistress turned to Draco, who was rubbing his hand.  “And
In hindsight, he thought he should have at least apologized for the misunderstanding.  He wasn’t sorry about doing the interview. Harry decided that once Draco read it, he would be more forgiving, and Harry would apologize then.
Since things had calmed down a bit, Harry, Draco and Blaise spent a few days lounging about the castle.  To be honest, it was becoming boring. Harry was anxious to talk to Ginny and needed something to take his mind off her condition and all the ‘what ifs’.
Harper looked away and slumped back down onto the bed.  Draco stood trying to decide if he really wanted to get involved in a conversation with Harper in his current state.  Clearly, he and Blaise had broken up.  He rolled his eyes and sighed heavily.  He was definitely hanging around the Gryffindors too much.
“It’s his good luck helmet, Hermione.  He’s not likely to trade in for a new one,” Harry informed her.
“Really,” she said skeptically.  “All you want is for Harry to be happy? You want nothing out of this for yourself?”
“Ron,” Harry chastised.  “It’s a wonder you and Hermione ever got together in the first place.”  He shook his head and walked to his next class.
“You really have changed a lot.”  Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco’s, deciding he was right.
“You were? Why didn’t you stop in? You’re always welcome back in the locker room.” Simon again glanced at Draco’s hand clutching Harry’s.
He readied Draco’s arse with his fingers to accommodate his cock eventually.  When he felt he was ready, he moved into position and began to push his way in.
“Oh, my, yes,” Madam Pomfrey added.  “The marriage of our hero is definitely something to celebrate.  The entire wizarding world will be interested.”
Pansy looked him in the eye. “You’re the only one that ever made me feel, you know.”  She couldn’t bring herself to say the word.
“It’s not past curfew yet,” Harry snickered.  “I meant, why are you wandering the classrooms alone?”
“We’re getting married.  You were all right about Knox.  And I did something stupid, or rather, I let something stupid happen.”
“But Harry doesn’t,” Romilda insisted.  “I wonder where he is anyway.”  She gasped.  “You don’t supposed Malfoy made a pass at him, do you?  Maybe Harry grew ears and a tail and is too ashamed to show up.”
Quickly, Harry took off his jumper and draped it over Draco. The injured feet needed to be elevated, but Harry knew it would be excruciating to move them. He cursed himself for not remembering to elevate his feet earlier.
Alone in the common room, Harry slouched down on the couch and closed his eyes for a moment.  He didn’t sleep well the night before.  He heard Romilda and Parvati talking as they walked in from their escapades.  Parvati was complaining about Michael.  Probably one of the few girls that complained about not going far enough.  Romilda said something about Ginny, but he didn’t catch what it was.
“She’s home,” Harry replied.  “Draco is going to take care of her for another week.  I believe he is planning to floo call you about it.”
Harry watched him.  It was immensely pleasing to Harry, knowing that he was the cause of the expression on Draco’s face. Any doubts he had at the beginning of their evening had long since vanished.
“Oh, no you don’t,” Ron spoke up.  “You said if we went to the library, I’d get to pick the restaurant. And I want to go to the Leaky Cauldron.”
“And I’m tired of the doubt,” Harry sighed.  “There’s only one thing to do then.  I’m going to talk to McGonagall.  You may as well start packing.”
The grasp on Draco’s shirt tightened and the blond knew Harry wasn’t going to last much longer.  He cradled Harry’s bollocks and used his other hand to stroke the lower half of Harry’s cock as he slurped the head.
The clerk went on to explain, “It’s a tie pin.  For a man. Actually, it’s two tie pins.  It’s for a man to give another man.”
“Dean, this benefits you as well.  If it’s not your baby, you won’t have to marry Ginny,” Harry explained.
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” she replied.  “I do know that Ron and I are planning to give Rose a baby brother or sister in the next couple of years.  I suppose every couple is different.”
“Actually, I was hoping you could tell me if Draco Malfoy checked in this evening,” he smiled. It was a practiced smiled, one he used in the business of being an Auror.
As Draco went for the treat, Slughorn removed the envelope and opened it.  His lips moved while he read the note inside.  He frowned, then smiled widely.
Terry Boot stood laughing uncontrollably, holding his sides. Cornfoot cast a disarming spell, but thanks to Harry’s quick thinking, it was deflected.
“Don’t be angry that I didn’t tell you earlier,” Harry continued to tackle Hermione’s questions.  “I wasn’t sure how you’d take it.  I can see that Ron is bothered.”
“Of course I’m sure.  Besides, Blaise isn’t much of a fan.  I thought maybe we could have a friendly wager.  I assume you’ll be rooting for the Harpies.”
“Darling, why didn’t you ever tell me that?” Narcissa asked.  “I would never have teased you about it.  Why do you think I wanted to remodel in the first place?  We’d all like to forget.”
“You heard Granger, uh, Hermione. I want to get my wand from Ollivander himself. And I’ll need time to practice with it before training starts.”
Wearing a mask.  The phrase reminded Harry of Trelawney’s reading.  He figured he was already in disguise.
“Then why didn’t you have more children?  Why didn’t you read to me when I was a child?  Why didn’t you and father play with me?  Eat with me?  Spend any damn time with me at all?”  His voice had risen with his anger.
Lowering his voice to almost a whisper, Draco continued. “I think maybe you want to get caught, Potter.  What if I just leaned over and nibbled on that ear of yours?”  He leaned over just slightly.
The same actions had been repeated over and over during the prior three days.  They started in the middle of the room and worked their way out.  Harry was thankful the job was nearly finished, as it was Saturday, and the last thing he wanted to do was clean on the weekend.  On the other hand, he and Draco had more constructive conversations in those three days than they had over the past thirteen years.
Monday morning brought a new sense of excitement for Harry.  It was literally the dawn of a new era for him.  One in which he no longer hid in the closet.  He made his way toward the Great Hall after several minutes of debating with himself over whether or not to go up to Draco’s room to get him.  He wasn’t sure how the Slytherin was feeling, and so decided to play it cool.  He was nearly at the bottom of the stairs when he spotted Draco out of the corner of his eye making his way down.
Hermione smiled shyly.  It was strange to hear Draco talk about ordinary, sweet things like first kisses.
He stood awkwardly, not knowing if he should put the envelope in his pocket or open it.  In his younger days, he would have eagerly torn into it to see his gift.
The sounds of Draco’s moans reverberated off the tiles in the room, amplifying them. He briefly wondered if his neighbors could hear him. That thought quickly disappeared as he felt Harry fingering his arse. He accommodated by spreading his legs a bit farther. Harry was gentle and only teased the hole, but the sensation was enough to put Draco over the edge.
“What?” Hermione asked.  “Is that true?” She raised her eyebrows at Harry.  “You didn’t even like her?”
“Harry Potter,” Rita Skeeter smiled.  She held out her hand to shake.  He simply looked at it. She chortled and withdrew her hand, giving a fake pout.  “Not happy to see me?”
Draco picked up the baby and gazed at her scrunched up little face.  Yes, he could also tell that she would have him wrapped around her little finger, much the same as the other two.  He never imagined he would embrace the role of father as tightly as he had.  He supposed no man did until he became a father.
Tears stung Harry’s eyes.  How could he possibly think those things of his parents?  He was ashamed of himself.  But sometimes we feel what we feel.
Harry rubbed his face, trying to erase the humiliation he felt.  Luckily, he had some fruit in his room, so he decided to skip breakfast and put off encountering Draco.  With any luck, he could avoid him all week.
“Why not?  There were enough men willing to spill their secrets.  At least some of it had to be true.”
“Yes,” Pansy agreed.  “And why would your father follow suggestions made by a couple of Ravenclaw students, anyway?”
Taking a huge breath and releasing it, Draco answered, in a slightly higher volume, “It was Harry.  He inadvertently started the whole thing.  Then my magic responded and completed the bond.”
Raising his eyebrows, Harry commented, “Why, Ron, are you actually encouraging my relationship with Draco?”
“Actually, Ron was pretty cool about the whole thing,” Harry told him. He furrowed his brow.  “He said he sort of knew about me.  He wasn’t surprised when I told him. What about your friends?”
“No,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “He was . . . in love with my mother.  But I assumed he must have had other romances. Not that he and my mother were ever romantically involved.”
She handed Harry a small plastic cup with a lid. “You can use that loo right there,” she pointed. “There are magazines and photos to help you.”
“Hm, I would have volunteered for rounds if I knew it would get me out of chaperoning,” Draco said, taking a sip of punch.
“It’s just a haircut,” Draco told him. He looked down.  “And new dress robes.  And a manicure.”  He held out his hands to show Harry, who took hold of one.
Draco snickered.  “I always wanted it that color.  It’s very soothing. But my father would never hear of it.”
“We’ve paid for the room until then, so we can stay close,” Draco explained.  “The woman who gave birth to them has been moved to a different wing.”
Hermione giggled.  “You do have awful bed head.”  She paused, thinking.  “So, is that what happened last night? Or rather, this morning?”
Ron leaned in for a closer look.  “Finally, someone’s had a boy in the family.  Poor little thing, he’ll be hen pecked for certain by his cousins,” he laughed.
adjusted the wards for him.  Perhaps because he was expected at the wedding.  Slowly, Draco stepped softly up to the door and turned the handle.  He listened for voices but heard none in close proximity.  Ron’s voice carried from the kitchen, along with another, but Draco couldn’t make out what either was saying.
“I suppose we ought to call it a night,” Draco said reluctantly.  “We’ve got the Hogsmeade trip early tomorrow.”
Soon enough, the preaching was over, and the vows began.  Ginny handed Hermione Ron’s ring, and Harry handed Hermione’s ring to Ron.  The pair exchanged rings and repeated the words spoken by the minister.  By the time Ron had managed to choke out the words “I do”, Molly had gone through several tissues.
“Don’t remind me,” Lucius groaned.  “Do you have any idea how many times I’ve had to endure comments about Draco’s sexual orientation.  Followed by, oh, but there’s nothing wrong with that, of course.” He sneered.
“Then you need to put her in the mood.  Light a few candles, put silky sheets on the bed, maybe a few toys . . .”
“So, that’s three of four dreams, that I know of, that have come true,” Draco said as he and Harry lay on the bed.
“You’ve been awfully quiet,” Hermione observed.  “It might help to talk.” She placed a glass of water on his desk and slid it toward him.
Ron and Jenkins closed the call, and Ron sat back on Harry’s sofa with Hermione.  He picked up a slice of pizza and took a bite nearly half the size of it.
“Well, then it’s not a total loss.”  Horace held up three small tickets.  “She’s sent the three of us tickets to the next match against Puddlemere United.”
“I didn’t mean to embarrass you, Mother.”  When she gave no response, he questioned, “What’s wrong?”
“It wasn’t like that.  She didn’t start seeing Dean until after we broke up, you know that.  Granted, it wasn’t very long after. And the timing is a bit iffy.”
“I’m so sorry.” Draco felt the sting of tears for a sister her never knew he had.  He steeled himself though, in order to hear the rest of the story.  “What happened when you woke up?”
“He’s in Azkaban.  What can he do?” Stephen questioned Draco. “Besides, we only suggested he get Potter out of your life.  We figured he’d threaten to disown you if you didn’t break up with him and find a girl to shack up with.”
On his way to the Great Hall, just about a month into the school year, Harry spotted Draco’s blond head above the rest.
As they snogged, Harry loosened Draco’s tie and unbuttoned his shirt.  He continued the undressing until Draco wore only the tie.  He undressed himself while Draco watched.
“Mm, so what shall we do for the rest of the weekend?”  Draco stroked Harry’s sweat soaked hair as they lay together.
He gave Harry a dazzling smile. “Are you just going to stare all day? Or did you come over for a reason?”
Ginny laughed.  “I’m best friends with the walking library.  Did you really think we wouldn’t be able to get that information without
“St. Mungo’s transferred me to the Janus Thickey Ward temporarily.  I hadn’t actually lost my mind, but they feared I would hurt myself, and kept a close watch on me.  Eventually, with counseling, and your father’s dedication, of course, I left the hospital and came home. Lucius doted on me and cared for me. If it weren’t for him, I don’t know if I would have ever truly recovered.”  She looked at Draco.  “But you paid the price, didn’t you?”
“He found it difficult to believe that I have left the past where it belongs.  And that, the person you are now, is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.  But I told him that I’ve changed too. And if I hadn’t, you probably wouldn’t want to be with me.”
After less than an hour, Harry was finished his essay for Advanced Herbology.  It took him much less time than he thought, and he was silently berating himself for putting it off.  He looked around the empty common room, bored.  Wishing that he had, in fact, gone to the party, Harry wondered whose wand Draco plucked from the cauldron.  Would fate have brought them together again if Harry had gone?  He figured he would never know.
Draco smirked and settled back into place.  Harry grinned and brought the book of parchment to the sofa and lay down.  He relaxed as Draco’s smooth voice brought his story to life.
Lucius stood a moment longer with the wand pointed at Harry, then turned away and raised his hands.  He recited an incantation under his breath and closed his eyes.  In a matter of minutes, the Manor was no longer protected.  They would be able to get Draco out, but then anyone would be able to get in.  It didn’t matter much to Lucius anymore.
“Something tells me if we don’t sit and let her serve us, she’ll get reinforcements to force us to sit,” Draco joked.
“Well, I’m here now.  I may as well enjoy myself.” Ron picked up a butter beer and took a big swig. He noticed Harry looking at him with concern.  “What?”
“I, I don’t . . . know,” Draco answered shakily.  “I felt like I was on fire.  Literally.  I’ve never had a more painful experience in my life,” he said, absentmindedly.  Then realizing what he’d said, he tried to back pedal.  “I mean, it wasn’t
“I beg your pardon?”  He gave her a stern look, causing her eyes to go wide, and Draco thought perhaps she was rethinking her request.
Lucius scoffed. “Poor man’s fare and a lopsided cake?  It’s hardly fitting for my son’s wedding reception.  And I wouldn’t at all be surprised if the trimmings were all knitted.”
“He needs to be alone with his son.”  Reluctantly, Hermione addressed Lucius.  “If you please . . . Ron’s wand?”
“Good afternoon gentlemen,” the wizard sitting down greeted them.  “Welcome to Azkaban.  I’m Virgil Treadway.”
Reluctantly, Harry returned to his earlier task. It felt like he had sifted through the wreckage for hours, making little headway. Intending to take just a short break, Harry checked on the sleeping blond. He was shivering.
“Did you mean everything you said when you were fifteen?” Draco questioned.  “My father told me I was to marry Pansy.  He and Parkinson were forming an alliance.  I don’t know if I really felt something for her, or I talked myself into it.  When I told her, she bolted.  She may have gone on with some romantic story about unrequited love, but I got over it quickly enough. I had to.  Shortly after that, I was informed that I was to take my father’s place among the Death Eaters.”
“Why didn’t you just tell me the truth?  You could have taken me to see her.  I would have understood that she was ill.”
Draco turned around to see Finch-Fletchley and Millicent Bulstrode snogging in a corner.  He couldn’t help the sneer his lips formed.  He didn’t find either one of them the least bit attractive.
Harry couldn’t necessarily disagree with the other professor. But he didn’t want to say anything to suggest that he wasn’t one hundred percent behind Draco.
Hermione’s conversations with Harry in the library and last night kept creeping into her thoughts.  She realized that Harry never actually referred to his crush as she or her.  In fact, she recalled him saying
“Did you know?” Ron questioned Hermione, giving her a small frown.  He witnessed the look exchanged between her and Harry.  “You told her, and not me?”
Narcissa smiled.  “That’s good to know.  But what I was really getting at was how the wizarding world is going to view the pair of you.  So far, knowledge of your relationship has largely been second-hand information in the Prophet written by Rita Skeeter.”
“Brilliant,” Ron said, tugging Harry off the dance floor with Draco in tow.  “Mione feels all right tonight so far, so we’d better hurry up.”
The trio decided to go the next day, as it was Saturday.  Classes wouldn’t resume until Monday and Ginny thought she would burst if she had to wait a whole week before finding out the truth.
“He’ll figure that out when the infatuation has worn off,” Knox said, ignoring Draco’s comment.  “When he’ll realize that you aren’t all that good looking after all.  When your Dark Mark reminds him constantly that you’re a Death Eater.  When you do something you shouldn’t do--something he doesn’t approve. And you will.”
Draco’s hand wandered to Harry’s chest and lightly raked his fingers across.  He pinched a nipple.  Harry made a steady stream of grunts and groans, urging Draco on.
“There’s more. Hornbeam is complex, for it also represents discipline and conscientiousness. Not to mention an emotional partner in the matters of love.” Ollivander winked.
Carrying a tray with a steeping pot of tea and four small handleless cups, Draco entered the drawing room.
Slowly, Harry met her eyes.  He was torn between keeping his privacy and getting his secret off his chest.  Not that he would mention Draco by name.
“It’s Arthur.  There was an accident at the Ministry today and he was injured.  I know Harry would want to know.”
Harry held out his hand to Dean.  “I hope you’re prepared for this.  Good luck mate.” He turned to Ginny. “My offer still stands.  Anything I can do to help.”
Penelope shrugged.  “I’ve been told by boys that I’m . . . unfriendly.  But really, I’m just a little shy.”
Draco made a noncommittal nod and took a sip of tea.  Suddenly, he looked over at his mother.  “You didn’t change my room, did you?”
“I was told that only my own property, or property owned jointly with my wife were subject to investigation,” Lucius said.
Hermione continued. “Anyway, they were smiling and talking and laughing together. It wasn’t the first time.”
Hermione casually wandered to his side as he nibbled on crisps by the buffet.  She addressed him without looking at him, so they wouldn’t appear to know one another.  She was dressed in a beautiful pale blue ball gown with a rather low neck and bodice that pushed her breasts up high, causing them to just about spill over the top.  Even Harry couldn’t help notice.  Her cleavage rivaled Pansy’s.
Neville picked up another butter beer.  “Maybe I will.”  He downed half the bottle in one chug.  “Are my teeth really that bad?”
As Greyback bounded down the stairs, he blasted the wall a few times, as well as the stairs themselves.  Large chunks of plaster and stone cascaded down on Draco hitting his right ankle, shattering it.  Through all the noise, Harry still heard his cry of pain.
The ginger stood watching for a moment.  Harry looked well rested and peaceful. Draco reminded him of a dog curled up by his master’s side.  That thought made him smile.
Ron nodded.  He made a mental note to make an effort to get to know the new Draco Malfoy and put aside their past.
A quick kiss, and Harry took off down the corridor in the opposite direction from Draco.  Draco stood watching long after he could no longer see Harry’s form in the darkness. For a moment, he thought he imagined the entire evening.  There was no way the Boy Who Lived could really want him.
The blond forced himself to look as they crested a hill.  He gasped at the sight.  Taller than any of the trees, the ride briefly offered a wide view of the park.
“It’s not as easy as for a bloke to figure out, you know.  It’s not like you’ve got a great big handle to grab onto.”
Millicent narrowed her eyes.  “Maybe.”  She thought a second. “Come on Finch-Fletchley, you’re going to clean my room.”  Justin garnered many a sympathetic look as Millicent dragged him up to her dormitory.
Keeping up his pace, Draco peeked over Harry’s shoulder to watch as Harry’s cock twitched and spurted out its load.
“Not a problem for wizards,” Draco smirked.  “And we can have a celebration afterward in the ballroom.”
Molly blinked and this time narrowed her eyes at Hermione.  “You’re full of questions.  Why so curious?”
“I can’t believe I’m siding with Malfoy on this,” Ron rolled his eyes.  “If you’re not careful, you could drive him away.  Jealousy is a relationship killer.”
“But not just the two of us, alone,” Ron complained.  “I need a buffer or something.  You know, ease into it.”
“Frankly, yes.  The faster we get a name, or names, the faster we can get them off the streets.  The sooner your mother is safe. And you.”
Waving the wand at Harry’s nether regions, Draco whispered an incantation.  He grinned at the results.
“Perfect.  I’ll let Minerva know we’ll be out in case she needs us.”  Harry almost leaned forward for a kiss, then caught himself.
“These questions are all geared toward heterosexual couples.  Which one of us is the mother?” he laughed.
Harry’s bedroom door opened suddenly, and Draco spilled out wearing the bed sheet wrapped around his waist.  He’d been trying to listen through the door and couldn’t hear everything clearly.  He could tell it wasn’t McGonagall, though, and decided the visitor had overstayed his welcome.
“The two of you appear to be smitten, but I’m having a hard time believing that Malfoy is sincere,” she said bluntly.
Composing himself, Draco replied, “I have an excellent sense of humor.  I wish I could have seen the look on your face, though.”  He began laughing again.
By the end of the evening, Draco had gotten word that his father had given his testimony and been taken back to Azkaban.  Ron remained tight-lipped about any name or names brought up in the inquiry. And Draco was told not to expect any other reports before the end of the week, while the Ministry investigated Lucius’ claims.  When pressed, Ron admitted he thought it was a long shot, but assured Draco that he would see to it personally that his father’s case received the same attention as any other.
“That’s part of it, yes,” Harry confessed. “But . . . we’ve hardly even talked about . . . us. Where is this going?”
“But I don’t have anything to hide,” Lucius snorted. He removed his wand from his pocket and handed it over.
“I had hoped she be here by now,” Horace frowned.  “Well, we shouldn’t let our food get cold.  Dig in.”
Draco could practically see the lightbulbs go on over the other Wizengamot’s heads as they murmured amongst themselves. He glanced over at the Interrogator for his father, who gave him a wink and a smile.
In that moment, Harry was very glad for Ron’s intervention earlier.  His friend was right.  Harry needed to stop leading Knox on, however unintentional it may have been.  His heart beat a little faster as Draco kissed his lips.  This was all he wanted.
Draco laughed. “To be honest, I didn’t know you were a professor here until two days ago.  I thought you were an Auror.”
Ravenously hungry, the boys cleaned their plates while they talked about plans for the night.  It had been decided that Blaise, Harper and Pansy would join the Gryffindors and Draco in the boys’ room.  Seamus offered up some butter beer and Dean told Ginny to come as well.  Molly Weasley had just sent some baked goods and Ginny said she would bring them.  It was shaping up to be a party, if only the guests could get along.
“Don’t worry.  The books won’t take priority over them,” assured Harry.  “Nothing is more important than our family.”
Ron, Hermione and Draco all laughed. It was still a sore subject for Harry and frankly, he didn’t see the humor in it. He was still plagued by the occasional nightmare of Draco’s ‘death’, which usually resulted in memories of countless others he had witnessed.
For what seemed like hours, Harry waited for Draco to say something. He wondered if perhaps he himself should. He was beginning to feel that this was going to be another one of those situations. A situation where, once the lust was satisfied, there was nothing substantial to sustain a relationship.
The ginger’s laughter faded. “Oh, fuck,” he said quietly.  Ron really wasn’t as stupid as he looked.
Pansy placed her palm on Draco’s forehead. “Are you feeling all right?  I think those Gryffindor sensibilities have rubbed off on you.”
“I don’t think that would go over so well with McGonagall,” Draco chuckled.  “As far as I know, no unmarried couple has ever shared quarters before.”
The guard rolled his eyes.  He was going to have to actually get up out of his chair and walk the six steps to access the floo network.
“Well, at least you’ve been handing in your own papers.  And they were quite good.”  Draco turned to him.  “They have been your own papers, haven’t they?  You’re not---”
“Potter, you and I have been at odds since the day we met.  And it didn’t get either one of us anywhere.  You certainly don’t have to be my friend, but I don’t want to have enemies anymore.”
Harry Potter was in love with Draco Malfoy.  It was there in black and white. Draco chuckled to himself as he thought perhaps he’d have that page of the Prophet framed.
“Oh, no, Harry would never do something like that.  He’d leave himself before he would put you out.”
He took his time, worshipping her body, massaging and caressing every part of her.  In time, she was soothed enough for him to enter her again.  Taking it very slowly, he inched further and further, distracting her with gentle touches elsewhere.
“Oh, I see,” Slughorn replied.  “Well, then, that would leave Miss Weasley and Mr. Potter without partners as well.”
Reaching for Harry’s crotch, Draco replied, “The large protuberance in your pants might have given me a hint.”
Even closed, Harry’s eyes were extraordinary.  The black fringe of lashes, slightly curled, were thick and shiny like his hair.  The bulge of his eyelids hinted at the large, green orbs that lay just beneath.
“He wasn’t really a Death Eater,” Harry said.  “Sure, he had the tattoo, but even Dumbledore didn’t believe his heart was in it. And he and his mum helped me when they didn’t have to.  In fact, they risked their lives to do it.”
Harry watched Draco’s face as he came and simultaneously felt the warm stickiness on his hand. The expression on the blond’s face could only be described as bliss. And Harry put it there. The Auror tenderly kissed the rosebud lips, extricated himself and lay down next to Draco on the bed.
After supper, the boys retired to Draco’s room.  Well, Draco did.  Harry stood uncomfortably outside the door.
As he sat at his desk, quill in hand, a new adventure came to mind.  Unlike the action he normally wrote about, Harry thought it was time his character had a romance.  And unlike Harry’s attempts at teenage romance, this boy’s relationship would be successful.  The only thing he wasn’t sure about was whether his character would fall for a girl, or a boy.
Draco opened his mouth to snap back, but he knew Harry was right.  He was jealous. And despite his apparent cockiness and somewhat confident manner, he couldn’t help wondering when the novelty would wear off.  For the time being, Harry was enjoying his rebellious streak, thumbing his nose at a society that simultaneously took him for granted and idolized him.  Announcing his homosexuality and relationship with one of the Dark Lord’s chosen peons was the ultimate ‘fuck you’.
Casper looked up at the Potions professor, then sighed.  “All right.  But it’s a secret.  You can’t tell anyone.”
“It’s not only you.  And besides, Draco had plenty of his own nightmares there.  I’ve asked him to move into Sirius’ old house with me.  But he feels compelled to live with his mother.  For a little while, at least.”
“We’ll simply conjure one up, along with a hat and bandana.  Just remember that they won’t last.  Anything else?” Hermione wanted to know.
Harry frowned.  He knew Draco had been a prat and a bully when they were young.  But he almost considered Malfoy a completely different person from the Draco he got to know and grew to love as an adult.
“You see, I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I’m afraid I’ll be wishing for the end of the evening just to get to that part,” Draco explained.  “But I don’t want to rush through.”
“I thought maybe you’d come live with me in Sirius’ old house.  Technically, it’s your family home as well,” Harry explained.
As he queued with the rest of the class, Harry grew anxious. His heart once again picked up its pace. He was close enough to catch Draco’s scent–clean and slightly musky.  Harry wondered if it was soap, cologne or just Malfoy’s natural scent.
Shaking his head, Draco simply said, “Pansy.” He sighed. “Anyway, at some point, I must have passed out and they brought me here.”
Draco seemed more relaxed getting on the second ride and even kept his eyes open the whole time.  He wore a grin as he stepped out of his seat.
Harry wasn’t sure what he was feeling.  On one hand, memories of his rivalry with Malfoy surfaced; memories he hadn’t pondered in years. On the other hand, he saw a possible ally, perhaps even a friend, in the man who showed up in the spoiled pureblood’s place.  As the youngest professors, and former classmates, it was easy to conceive that they would gravitate towards one another.  Their interaction earlier convinced Harry that they would be able to work together.
They had stayed at the Palazzo Cloisters the night before, after a week in Venice.  Draco decided not to take Harry to the place in Como, where he had gone with other lovers. Though he had visited the area of Italy in which they were currently, Draco had not stayed at this particular villa. There were only three more days of their official honeymoon.
Ron took out his timepiece and looked at it for what seemed to be the thousandth time.  “Coming up on five hours overdue. Still no signal from Harry.”
“Did you remember what happened at the party?” She continued to badger him. “For Godrick’s sake, Harry.  Just spit it out.” Hermione threw her hands up in exasperation.
“Ironic that having things handed to me on a silver platter has taught me the value and worth of making one’s own way.  Having to struggle seems to have taught you the opposite.” The snide remark left Draco’s mouth before he could sensor it.  Ron was clearly insulted as evidenced by the small tight line of his mouth.
As the girls drew nearer, Romilda put on her best smile.  “My friend and I are in need of dancing partners.  Would you be interested?”
Draco sighed.  “It’s not a choice.  I can’t help it.  I’ve been fighting it for a while now.  But at that ridiculous party, he was so charming and personable and funny and
Harry pushed his hood off his head and cast a Lumos charm so the man could get a good look at his scar.
“Ah.  Mm.”  The Slytherin released a healthy amount of cum onto Harry’s already cum-dribbled lower belly.  He slowed down the stroking and rubbed his penis in the mess, mixing both boys’ jizz together.
