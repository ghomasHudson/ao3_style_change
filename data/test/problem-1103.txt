Harry grins, the stoniness in his eyes softening into relief. Hands on Draco’s waist, he pulls him downwards. Draco catches himself on his elbows, breath hitching in his throat. Their bodies are flush with each other, nothing separating their warm skin but ruddy
But even with everyone’s efforts, it takes months to identify merely the objects Voldemort might use to make Horcruxes. What they know from the various memories Dumbledore has painstakingly assembled is that Voldemort is obsessed with his ancestry and the power of ever-lasting legacies. He, alpha descendent of the great Salazar Slytherin, looks to be the most gloriously powerful wizard in history.
Harry pushes the heavy door open, the bell chiming above his head loudly. Ollivander’s is dusty and silent as a tomb, its walls cramped with countless cubbyholes and shelves. Harry gawps, tilting his head back to see the crowded walls reaching out to a stamp-sized skylight; the shop is much taller than it appears on the outside.
‘Are you all right, Harry?’ the white-haired wizard asks, stooping down next to Harry on the floor. ‘You have seen something terrible.’
When Draco was closing up the shop that evening, Potter was particularly jittery. Draco decided to ignore him.
With so many people watching them, Draco had little choice but to trail after Snape. He set his jug of pumpkin juice down on a nearby table, looking up to see Zabini staring at him. Zabini’s gaze was glacial. Draco looked away and hurried after Snape.
‘So … I propose a little … experiment, shall we call it?’ Zabini leans forwards, his grin glittering like a dagger. ‘You aren’t asking me about how to get someone to sleep with you because you want an easy fuck. You’re asking me because something in your life is unsatisfactory, and you don’t know how to change it. I’m sure I can help you with that.’
‘You should go find him,’ Neville says, shrugging off his hand. ‘And don’t touch me—he can tell somehow, you know. Oh, he will get shirty with me.’
Harry is happy to report to Lizzy and their friends at home of Jane’s recovery. When he is not accompanying Kitty to parties and assembly rooms, he vists his old friends from Hogwarts and his time in the Auror Corps. He is particularly delighted to meet by coincidence Mr. Dean Thomas and Mr. Seamus Finnigan, who were in Gryffindor House with him, at the park, where he is taking a stroll before dinner. Thomas and Finnigan married at the end of the war, and now live in London, where they manage a tourist agency for wizards who wish to tour Muggle destinations.
‘Dinner at the Burrow tomorrow, remember! Mum will kill you if you don’t come,’ Ron shouted after him.
“You don’t mind, do you?” she said to him. “It’s just Luna has always called you Draco, and it feels strange calling you Malfoy again.”
Draco refused to look Potter in the eye. After a long moment of tensed silence, Potter muttered something about fetching a Healer, and left the room.
Draco starts moving, the sound of their skin slapping against each loud in the dark, still room. He is moaning, his mind blanked out by the sheer pleasure of being in Harry, so deep and so tight. There is nothing else, but Harry – that is his entire mind. All he can smell. All he can feel. All he can taste. And just like that, something crumbles between them, and they gasp in unison, because Draco is feeling
Harry manages a dry laugh, Summoning a mug for his tea when the tiny kettle shrills. Draco snickered at the sight of the one-cup kettle, sniping,
Harry turns to see Zabini bowing to him. Sir William has since begged Harry’s leave to attend to his other guests. Harry returns Zabini’s bow. Though Zabini, like the other Slytherins, was always willing to be amused by Malfoy’s jibes at Harry and his friends, Harry feels no real animosity towards the tall, dark man. He is also innocent of any war crime, save for a greater concern for saving one’s own skin. Harry could hardly hold that against anyone; he knows the primal instinct for survival very well.
‘What are you talking about?’ Harry asks brusquely. ‘What are you even doing here? Shouldn’t you be at home?’
, her face puckered in utter disgust. Minnie had explained that there are three sexes in the world: alpha, beta and omega. While the majority of living creatures is beta, twenty per cent of people are alpha, and an even smaller proportion—ten per cent—is omega.
The isolated figure turned when they entered. It was Lucius, his face swollen and bleeding. The Dark Lord was examining the second wand he held in his hand. Bellatrix led Draco and his mother to Lucius and they waited.
They came to the compartment Pansy was waiting in. She beamed at Draco, pulling him in for a hug. ‘I’ve missed you so much,’ she exclaimed, clinging to his left arm and refusing to let go.
It was a little more difficult finding a book on the potion the Dark Lord had used to create his new body. Difficult, but not impossible. After six months of searching every magical bookshop in the United Kingdom, Draco found a brief paragraph on it in a slender book the size of his hand trapped within the pages of a used Herbology text in a musty bookshop in Manchester.
want Draco there. Potter turned away. Draco swallowed the mouthful of suddenly tasteless omelette, and looked down at his plate.
His voice was a weak shattered thing in the enveloping darkness. Snape froze for a moment, but when Yaxley called again, he made his way to the doorway. He still wouldn’t look at Draco. Draco spat out a mouthful of blood.
Harry doesn’t want to see such anxiety in his godfathers’ eyes, so after that first month, he does his best to take the potion without flinching; to force himself to be patient because while he is weak the first few days, he does recover his strength. There are days he cannot sleep, kept awake by nightmares of his magic disappearing and having to go back to the Muggle world, but he hides those days from Minnie, Sirius and Moony.
It was as if he had been enclosed in a dome of foggy glass for the past year or so, and for the first time today, someone from the outside had scrubbed a tiny spot clean and Harry could see the cloying, sticky darkness threatening to swallow he and his dome whole. The darkness had risen nearly to the top and Harry was close to drowning.
‘Of course,’ Sirius smirks, patting his chest pocket. ‘Never failed me once. Brought me through the war.’
She had firmly attached herself to Draco’s trip to Diagon Alley. Of course, it would be perfectly fine if all he was planning on getting were books. Now, he would have to think of a way to shake her off.
Now it was Draco’s turn to sputter wordlessly. Pansy and Goyle laughed. Crabbe was ignoring the whole lot of them, buried in Goyle’s comic.
The world was such a wretched mess and Zabini and Luc Norton were right: Harry had helped to make it worse. He struggled to breathe through the bone-deep horror and despair.
Snape stood still, thin, straight and silent. A loud crack shot through the darkness from above Draco’s head and his arms were released. He collapsed, the chains clattering loudly. He lay there, his arms trembling, so close to the ground the smell of his piss and shit was acrid in his mouth.
“I know how Andromeda Tonks is related to me, Potter,” Draco said wryly. “You want me to go with you?”
The other boy swears under his breath, and glances around them to ensure no one is within earshot before snarling, ‘Would that be enough to get you to stay away? I know what he is, and I don’t care.’
Draco stretched luxuriantly, earning him a lingering look. He sat up and began to dress as well. ‘Who are you bringing then?’
‘Why, yes, you have heard about the soul-bonds between alpha and omega? You must have, my child, you are alpha after all—and an unreasonably powerful one at that. I see that you have already met your mate, and at such a prodigiously young age. I would be troubled, if I were your parents.
Zabini professes to be delighted to convey assistance to Harry by any means possible. He wears a bright smile that belies the nature of Harry’s request – a fairly alarming aspect.
‘What I can’t figure out,’ Sirius says, glaring at the newspapers, ‘is how they have caught wind of it.’
Weasley’s words were the light that poured over him when he had been in wretched pain from the Angel’s Trumpet. Draco thought he could have kissed Weasley. Some of his intention must have showed on his face, because Weasley suddenly looked nervous and stepped back.
? He pictures Harry holding hands with Ginny Weasley, walking arm in arm, laughing, leaning in to—he releases his grip on Harry’s hand, as Harry stirs, a glimmer of green eyes. ‘Draco?’ he mumbles, half-asleep, reaching out to put his other hand over Draco’s.
Draco doesn’t mind the stares, but he has to admit that entering the Great Hall behind Professor McGonagall and having the entire Hall of older students turn to look is terrifying enough to weaken his knees. Granger is staring fixedly ahead, while Longbottom whimpers and Weasleys is white beneath his freckles. Only Potter seems unaffected, striding along in McGonagall’s wake; he was delighted to see her.
Crabbe scowled. ‘None of your business, Zabini. Gimme that – I want to read it,’ he said, snatching Goyle’s comic.
Draco nods mutely, biting the insides of his cheeks. Mother glances up at Father, his parents having an inscrutable conversation, before she pulls back, keeping her hands on his shoulders and a wide smile on her face. ‘Well then, shall we go back to breakfast?’ she asks merrily. ‘Mittsy prepared pancakes today.’
‘Well, we don’t know. These are only rumours. Veelas aren’t human,’ Moony reminded him. ‘But neither am I. You needn’t be afraid. I doubt Dumbledore would have let him in, if he really is a danger.’
‘It’s different,’ he retorted with some asperity. At Minnie’s, the mountains are close by, and they feel like shelter. At Grimmauld Place, he can always hear the Muggles next door, even if they can’t know he exists.
‘Yes, I know that now, silly,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘But like I said, it’s weird that you talk like an adult. Are you
Harry is not the sexless prude Lizzy likes to tease him to be. He is aware of his inclination for gentlemen. However, the one thing he visited a brothel with his Auror mates, he discovered a distaste for meaningless fornication. He could very well experience the same release with his hand, and at no cost too. Couple this realisation with his natural wariness and reluctance to venture outside of familiar company, this leaves Harry very much like a monk.
He is Draco Malfoy. He is a Veela, better, faster, stronger than any wizard. Not to him, this cannot happen to
He is waiting with a rope-bound figure at his feet. Death Eaters surround him, wands raised towards Draco and Harry. Everywhere else, giants, werewolves, vampires and hags linger in the shadows. Jeers and bays echo off scorched walls, as they land in the middle of the ragged circle. The prisoner jerks, and light falls across Snape’s face bleeding from a cut above his eye.
He leans against the cool tiled wall, his eyes closed, taking deep gulping breaths. For fuck’s sake, it’s just like Potter to say such things without any thought of the consequences.
That drove Draco from half-asleep to complete wakefulness. He was lying on top of Harry on the sofa, one of Harry’s arms draped over him, the other trailing on the ground. Their hips were aligned, morning hard-ons pressed against each other. His lips were pressed against Harry’s neck.
Draco is furious with himself. How could he so thoughtless? He should have insisted on going over to the Muggle’s flat, instead of bringing him home. He had been too desperate, living so close to Harry as the effects of the suppression potion wear off over the month and Harry’s innate omega nature emerges. He could hardly focus on his work, growing hard merely from the lingering scent of Harry everywhere in the flat. If he doesn’t go out to fuck someone at least once a day, he is afraid of what he might do if he were alone with Harry.
His eyes snap open, gleaming silver in the darkness. His breathing rapid and uneven, he scrambles onto his hands and feet, sinking into soft moist soil. The statue straightens up, stone grinding stone with a rumbling groan.
Two years after the war and five months into Draco’s new job, he’d had to serve a Muggle-born child and his Muggle parents. The Ministry staff that had accompanied them had stood near Draco, watching him with narrowed eyes, daring him to curse the Muggles.
Theo had looked surprised at the change in Auror. He had commented, “Trouble in paradise, Draco?” and wriggled his eyebrows. Draco had given him a hard, black glare, and Theo had shut up. He got on surprisingly well with Weasley.
His friend entered then, and Draco jumped, feeling guilty for thinking poorly of his friend. He accepted the proffered Wizard’s Brew with a smile.
Harry seemed fine when he came home last night from dinner. Draco remained in his room, but he could feel a peculiar determination thrumming through the connection, which, after all these years, Draco alone seems to feel. Harry has made a decision. Draco doesn’t like to think what this decision could be.
Draco set his things down, took a deep breath and spoke the incantation that awoke the spells. The Cabinet’s wood began to glow with green and blue and pink. He rolled his sleeves up and got to work.
Darcy returns to his estate in Derbyshire, returning only for Draco’s and Bingley’s respective weddings. He and Lizzy manage to be civil with each other. There seems to be no animosity on the gentleman’s part for Lizzy’s actions. As for Lizzy, her dislike for the man has been softened by his explanation and her observation of his quiet support for Bingley. The gentleman returns to Pemberley, and Lizzy stays at Longbourn, and it seems like their paths might never cross again.
Draco hummed in agreement, watching her thin pinched face. Her parchment-coloured skin was stretched tight over a shiny bare skull and sharp cheekbones, deep lines at the corners of chapped lips and drooping eyes. Narcissa Malfoy had been the most beautiful girl in her year at Hogwarts; his father used to say it often, when Draco was much younger.
Harry’s face pales, and then flames. He puts his quill down, passing a hand over his face. ‘Besides the fact that I don’t particularly have anyone I want to have sex with, you know people will be able to tell I’m omega just by
Harry. The thought of losing Harry hurt more than the pain radiating through him. Somehow, Draco managed to uncurl himself, causing Theo to jerk back in shock.
me, something about the Ministry. I told her I would go to Dumbledore, who is Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, last time I checked. While I’m there, I would write a letter to Head of Magical Law, whom we all know supports Dumbledore. She shut up quickly after that, stupid bitch.
‘He must have thought to make amends, being Dumbledore’s spy,’ Voldemort continues. ‘But I had my suspicions all along … how was he able to become a professor at Hogwarts, when the old man turned
Draco’s chest was deep and hollow. He clenched his fists, drawing the blanket up his waist. ‘The Dark Lord gave me to you?’
Surprise jolted through Draco. The Unbreakable Vow? Snape would swear upon his life – his own life – to protect
‘Never mind, you don’t need to know this, and you would forget it when you go back. Who are you? What’s your name? How do you know my brother?’
His mouth floods with the taste of sun-warmed honey and orange blossoms drifting above a slow summer-lit river, and his chest fills with briny river water, his lungs water-logged. Emotions that are not his bloom like desert flowers after a rare storm, vivid and fantastic in the parched landscape.
‘Let’s say there is,’ Neville is stubborn. ‘Don’t you see that if you let Voldemort in, you are exposing Draco too? Do you want Voldemort in Draco’s head?’
Suddenly, the door flew open, sending Zabini flying backwards onto Crabbe’s lap. Crabbe reared up in anger, dumping Zabini onto the ground. Zabini leapt up, indignant, hurling abuse at Crabbe for being a boor. Crabbe bawled back. Goyle was on his feet too, stepping up between them, hands on Crabbe’s chest, pushing him back into his seat.
On his long walk up from the gates, he marvelled at the silhouette of Hogwarts Castle black against the night sky. There were no more massive holes torn into the castle’s sides, exposing its shattered innards. The towers were standing tall and straight again. The lawn was smooth as velvet. Hogwarts was healed. He was almost jealous of Hermione, Neville and the younger students who would be returning in September.
It abruptly occurs to Harry that Draco hadn’t thought he would be missed. He clenches his jaw, not trusting himself to speak. The blond tilts his head, eying Harry worriedly. The silences stretches, distends.
There is nothing remarkable about the slender, dark-skinned boy, both his looks and demeanour. He keeps his eyes cast downwards, and answers only when Draco asks something.
“How am I going to find your attacker if you won’t talk to me?” Potter snapped. “Trust me, Malfoy, I am
‘Oh, come on, mate. Are you bragging that people are looking at you all the time?’ Ron asked teasingly. ‘You’re
- Mother said everybody thought you didn’t really exist!’ Pansy sniggers, her face more pug-like than ever. ‘Blaise was so jealous to hear that I would be meeting you first, and Daphne says she will force her mother to have tea with your mother so she could meet you.’
It is a lucky thing that the old wizard is one of those half-mad academic sort, intrigued by a unique challenge to his expertise. He accepted the Malfoys’ commission on one condition: for a few strands of Draco’s hair.
The werewolf and a few other Death Eaters were assigned to aid Draco, much to their deepest displeasure.
Turning a finger into a claw, he cuts open Harry’s sweater from the front. Harry’s entire chest is covered in blood. Gritting his teeth, Draco pulls open the pieces of sweater, Harry swallowing a whimper as the cloth tugs at his wounds. Without looking up, Draco presses his palms flat against the puncture wounds in Harry’s shoulders. Harry exhales sharply, his body stiffening at the unexpected pressure.
we’re soulmates,’ he protests, his confusion transmuting into annoyance. ‘For Merlin’s sake, so much of what I do is because I’m your mate,
Potter did not look amused at his quip. “Yeah, well, this attack on your life is a very deliberate, very well-planned one. It isn’t a casual opportunistic attack. Ron and I think we need to start looking at these death threats. See if any of them have decided to take it beyond letters.”
Draco nodded. Yes, he knew Florean Fortescue, the kindly man who had always given Draco extra chocolate chips as a child. Fortescue, who was murdered by Death Eaters for refusing to give the Dark Lord the knowledge he wanted.
Draco feels something hard against his bare thigh. He pulls back for a while, rearing up on his knees. Harry growls, opening his eyes, looking bereft. Draco shivers. He’ll be a lying bastard if he doesn’t admit that he has fantasised about this moment since he was old enough for wet dreams, but not even his wildest dreams could have measured up to the reality of Harry writhing beneath him, his nipples peaking with arousal, his lips wet from kissing.
Looking at Draco through his lashes, his gaze dark, Potter lifted up his hand and licked it. Draco couldn’t breathe. He reached out and crushed Potter in his arms, his mouth already searching for Potter’s. Draco could taste himself on Potter’s tongue, could feel Potter’s erection pressing against his spent cock.
As the table burst into exaggerated outraged gasps, Sprout and Flitwick shooting the Headmistress mock scandalised expressions, Luna reached out and pulled Harry down onto the seat next to her. The small, scared man was on Luna’s other side. He was obviously trying to avoid looking at Harry, his nose deep in his teacup.
The group of them stared at her, Draco astonished by the cattiness in her voice. She flushed unattractively, but held Zabini’s gaze fearlessly.
‘How wonderful it must be for rich women and their lucky relations – to have the liberty to choose to be single for as long as one wishes,’ Lizzy remarked once.
‘Although you needn’t have said that about my parents,’ Draco says pointedly. ‘That would have been a good enough reason for me to feel offended.’
McGonagall strides forwards, taking the Hat from him, and says briskly: ‘Welcome to Gryffindor, Malfoy.’ She gestures him towards the Gryffindor table, smiling.
‘Ah! Ah, what’s this? Oh my, yes, you are a Veela, aren’t you? Well, your mind isn’t so different from a wizard’s, you know. Ah, and this soul-bond of yours –’
Draco’s eyes shot open. Snape was already in the doorway, the light from the corridor disappearing behind the dwindling gap.
Reflexively, he thought of the cursed silver necklace. Rosmerta had promised him its delivery today. Some of his realisation showed inadvertently on his face and Zabini snarled, jabbing his wand ineffectually at Draco.
The interior is larger than the outside suggests. The entryway is dominated by a pair of white Greek statues – satyrs, with their human torsos proudly naked. White marble walls accented by gleaming gold trimmings fall away after the statues to reveal a wide staircase, which splits into right and left at the landing. The entryway is crowded with people murmuring, some in awe. House elves clothed in little togas are darting around, requesting for cloaks and coats in their high-pitched voices.
He was holding Potter, an arm wrapped around him, trailing his hand up and down Potter’s upper arm absently. He blinked, realising that Potter had asked him a question.
of someone sitting down heavily. ‘I don’t think Draco realises what he’s doing,’ Remus says tersely.
‘No?’ Malfoy muses. ‘You do not consider marriage one of life’s greatest objectives? There are but millions of treatises and novels written on the bliss of matrimony.’
‘Shut up,’ Draco tells him succinctly. ‘Did you tell my father to go to the Ministry that night? Did you tell Voldemort to cast the Killing Curse? No?
But she was wrong: Draco goes out to Hogsmeade with Nolan and his friends every weekend. He sits with them at dinner once or twice a week. When he isn’t in the common room, he sits in the courtyard, telling his new friends amusing stories.
Draco bought a book on summoning rituals from a second-hand bookshop in Diagon Alley. He paid the bored cashier and walked out with the thin volume tucked into his pocket. He finished reading it in a single night, curled up by the fireplace, tired eyes scouring the yellowed pages. The previous owner had written a review of the book on the back end page:
The Map came in more useful than Draco could have imagined, because it helped him avoid Potter when he needed to be in the Room of Hidden Things. He knew Potter was still suspicious of him. When they weren’t snogging, they were fighting so it wasn’t much of an act the snippy way they behaved to each other in front of others.
Harry opens his mouth, and finds the words missing. What does he say? What does he want to say? He did not start the night expecting to see Draco, to touch Draco. His thinking and thinking and overthinking have not inspired any sort of grand course of action to set everything proper. He closes his eyes briefly.
‘Thought you might, being an alpha,’ she continues and shakes her head in dismay, spreading her hands open in a helpless gesture. ‘Oh sweet Helga, I do hate it when I have to break it to the parents, and it’s upsetting to think the life little baby Potter will have to live as an omega. It will –’
. He poured himself into the kiss the same way he had been pouring his magic into the broken Cabinet. It wouldn’t matter if there were gaps between Potter’s fingers and some of Draco disappeared forever; he only wanted Potter to hold him as he was, at least for a second.
‘Are you not going to tell him why he must hide the fact that he is omega?’ Minnie asked in a freezing tone.
Malfoy draws his hand away, as they turn and switch partners and turn back again. There is no change to that pale, dispassionate face. He merely nods and thanks Harry most courteously for his apology. When the music stops, he bows shortly, and walks away before Harry could stall him. Harry is left most disconcerted.
Harry’s sisters, even the stoic Mary, are clearly in a mood to enjoy themselves. They cajole Harry to spend a little on new ribbons and lace for their clothes, and refresh their dresses to devastating effect. Harry, their aunt and uncle exclaim with tremendous admiration at the sight of the three Bennet sisters on the night of the ball. Jane looks pretty as ever, her revitalised spirit shining on her face. Kitty, who is unfortunately the clumsy, gawky sister, manages to look almost graceful tonight. Mary is utterly transformed. Her protests that she has no need to dress up fell on death ears, for her sisters were determined, and the result is Mary lovely and fresh in a dusky pink gown, her cheeks glowing becomingly.
hadn’t known himself, and when he had written to his parents, they had said those were only rumours. Of course, the Malfoys would bury and deny any knowledge of non-purebloods in the family. At least they hadn’t disowned him yet.
Dumbledore nodded. ‘He likes the ceremony of it. It must be a ritualistic testament to his power. I am still trying to identify how many, and what these objects are, and where he has hidden them.’
Harry doesn’t want to rely on Draco’s healing powers, even if his friend has pointed out in exasperation,
The evacuees have come to the manor too, including Draco’s aunt, who is Tonks’ mother. There is tension between Mother and Aunt Andromeda, but that is only to be expected after decades of estrangement: the family had disapproved Andromeda marrying Ted Tonks, a Muggle-born. Unfortunate, because Uncle Ted is exceedingly likable, jovial and witty; he is the only one who can get the anxious, stern Andromeda to smile.
‘The Veelas told us that Draco is likely to have a soulmate,’ she cuts him off smoothly, her expression glacial. ‘The person for whom he has been decided at birth. When Draco first came to us, I foolishly thought that this person must be my rival. Draco is
He doesn’t know how they have come to this: having conversations over dinner. He thinks it might have something to do with him realising a month ago that he didn’t see Malfoy in the Great Hall at breakfast, lunch or dinner, and he wondered what his old schoolyard rival was getting up to. Nothing apparently, besides attending classes, studying in the library, and talking quietly with his friends in the eighth year common room.
They were waiting in the Formal Drawing Room, which Mother had only used once fifteen years ago to receive a visiting Italian countess. The Death Eaters stood against the panelled walls, cloaked in black robes and shadows. A single figure stood in the middle, in front of the Dark Lord sitting in a high-backed winged armchair.
‘Draco wouldn’t cheat,’ Harry interrupts. ‘If he’s together with anyone, he wouldn’t cheat. Draco doesn’t lie.’
He cast a quick Hot Air Spell and shouldered his bag. ‘I’ll see you tomorrow, Myrtle,’ he called over his shoulder.
‘No, I told you, he looks as scary as a hamster. It’s just … weird the way he tried not to look at me.’
‘I told you that you are not to fly without me,’ Minnie says harshly. ‘You disobeyed me. I have told you how dangerous flying can be. Many witches and wizards far older than you have suffered bad accidents. Do you want to get hurt, Harry?’
Harry feels Draco’s presence—awareness like a knot in his chest—before his friend whispers his name. He curls up tighter under the covers, squeezing his eyes shut. He manages to hold himself together most of the time, as his magic is sapped away by the suppressant, but once in a while, he lands himself in the hospital wing. He fainted during Transfiguration this time, Minnie’s horrified shout still echoing in his ears.
Draco pressed his knuckles at the top of Potter’s arse, slowly kneading his way down. He slapped it a few times, exulting in the way the cheeks wobbled and Potter gasped. Potter’s broken little gasps went straight to his cock. He squeezed Potter’s arse cheeks, the flesh soft in his hands. Merlin, he was falling behind in all his classes, but he could now write a hundred rolls of parchment on a treatise on why Potter’s arse was the most glorious thing in the world.
The joke was on Draco in the end though, wasn’t it? He was on the wrong side of the war, and the first few post-war years had been a roiling cauldron of abject misery. Highlights included a year in Azkaban, being pelted by Doxy eggs during his trial, and that awkward meeting where he had gotten his wand back from Potter.
Dumbledore was reluctant to explain further, but Minnie demanded it. ‘We are all in this fight together, Albus!’ she said heatedly. ‘Do you think we should be sending out teenagers with barely five years of experience in the wizarding world to defeat the Dark Lord by themselves? Yes, it might be prophesised, and there is no accounting for fate, but for Merlin’s sake, we do not send our children to die in our place!’
Zabini shakes his head, taking a sip of his wine. ‘Unfair of you to say that – where is your famous Gryffindor sense for justice? Your boyfriend is far wealthier than I am.’
She threw him a glare of mock outrage. ‘And to think Kingsley accelerated your Auror training! You’re an utter disgrace, Ron Weasley.’
Hermione and Ron agreed with Kingsley, of course, and they did not understand Harry’s rage. How could they? Harry had not told them about the kisses that tasted of iron and blood and soot: in the boys’ bathroom in sixth year before Harry panicked and sliced Malfoy’s chest open, and in the hallway outside of the Room of Requirement after Harry rescued him from the Fiendfyre. Harry had not even admitted to himself that he rather liked kissing blokes.
Mrs. Bennet is staring at him in consternation, ignorant of the ottoman twitching beneath Malfoy’s heels. Bingley and Darcy look nonplussed. This is clearly behaviour they have not observed from their friend. Harry intercedes before his mother could injure the service Malfoy has performed for them.
Potter was staring at him, wide-eyed. Draco was close enough to smell the sweat on Potter’s skin, to breathe in a scent that brought him back to Potions classroom for some reason, something wonderful he had smelled there before. Potter’s face was only a hand’s length away from his and Draco could feel the heat of his body.
Draco thinks Harry’s godfathers suspect something, judging from the way Remus’s looks gradually transformed from suspicion to pity over the years. Hermione probably does too. She could hardly miss the way Harry’s strength flags at a particular time of the month, his prodigious knowledge of potion-making and how he shunned any relationships at school, despite him being rather popular. And once she deduced that Harry is omega, it only takes following a logical line to understand why Draco, an alpha, behaves the way he does around Harry.
And Draco is whisked away from the stands, brought to Hagrid’s cottage, McGonagall following closely. The groundskeeper himself hovers by the door, nodding when Dumbledore tells him to keep watch. The Headmaster sits Draco down on a massive chair, and says without preamble: ‘Harry has been taken. We need you to bring us to him. Can you do that, Draco?’
Draco recoiled from Healer Mitra violently, shaking his head, raising his hands to clutch his head. “Nonononono – this is – no! Impossible – this cannot be happening –
The man was swearing profusely. Draco’s eyeballs were swollen and throbbing, a darkness stealing over his vision. Familiar green eyes behind black-framed glasses appeared, and just as quickly winked out of sight. He felt the squeezed, breathless press of Apparition, and slipped away from consciousness.
Jane is grateful to Harry for arranging affairs so thoughtfully for her sake. ‘You are too good to me – both of you,’ she says to Harry and Lizzy on the night before they are due to catch the Portkey to London. ‘My heart is full, and my words fail to express my gratitude accurately. Oh! I
Draco comes round, dropping to his knees in the dirt in front of him. He takes Harry’s hands, and presses his forehead against the back of his hands. His skin is cold as marble. Harry stares down at the pale head with a sense of unreality: those hands are not his, this moment is not his. If he casts
When she finally speaks, her voice is soft. ‘I’ve been neglecting you, my boy,’ she whispers. ‘I will
In a breath, he is on his feet, peeking through the curtains. The moonlight through the slit falls upon Harry curled up on his side, the blankets kicked off. His face is screwed up in agony, and as Draco reaches out, Harry’s eyes shoot open, startlingly green, as he screams, ‘
‘I did,’ Draco says, standing in the middle of the worn rug, trying to gather the courage to do what he must.
It was almost uncanny how like Potter he sounded. Draco suppressed a gurgle of hysterical laughter. ‘I’ll – I’ll think about it,’ he said.
‘Oh—uh—’ Harry looks up at Sirius, disconcerted by both Sirius’ expression and his increasingly hot wand. He claps a hand over his sleeve, pulling the wand away from his skin.
changed. It coiled in the tight space between their bodies, brooding and dangerous, exhilarating and nameless.
“All right, all right,” Harry held up his hands, eyes wide with concern. “Draco, will you calm down? What’s wrong?”
Draco frowned. It wasn’t his. His parchment was custom-made by Malfoy house-elves, creamy white and satin-smooth, with the Malfoy crest embossed on the right-hand corner. He picked it up, turning it over in his hands. It was blank on both sides.
Draco is watching Harry Potter’s face, his fingernails digging into his palms. His arms are trembling with the effort of holding himself together, but things are a little easier to bear when he knows what to expect. The other boy is watching him as well, but besides the wariness in his green eyes, there is no sign that he feels the same baffling link that Draco does. Draco swallows a growl of frustration: is he the only one feeling this way then?
“I keep to my room and the kitchen, and out of the way when you have friends over. I’m quite fastidious about cleanliness so don’t worry,” Draco said, avoiding looking at Potter by studying the spice wall.
‘Strong smell?’ Harry repeats worriedly. ‘Do you still smell it now? Is it very bad? Moony or Dumbledore never said anything—’
Theo looked sympathetic. Draco felt a surge of affection for his friend. He and Theodore Nott had never been close at Hogwarts; he had Crabbe and Goyle, and Theo was a bit of a loner. It was unexpected, but very welcome, when he had started turning up at Draco’s weekly drinking session with Blaise.
Parkinson’s eyes widened. She took a half step back, Zabini reaching out to steady her at the elbow. ‘I didn’t mean it like that,’ she shook her head. ‘I really am sorry, Potter. I wasn’t thinking, I was scared and I didn’t want to die. I’m sorry, Potter.’
what I’m doing and I reckon I am doing the world some good. Being an Auror is alright … you can’t expect everyone to love the work they do.’
Yaxley blasted the gargoyle apart. They clambered up the frozen staircase and burst onto – a silent empty office. Dumbledore clearly hadn’t been in his office in hours. The Carrows surged in, tearing into the back rooms. Dumbledore wasn’t in bed either. Swearing, Yaxley cast a Location spell.
Draco’s family is rotten on both sides—barring his parents of course—that must be why Harry doesn’t want to put his name in the family register. Draco suggested it, because well, it’s inevitable, and this will give Harry more protection on Malfoy Manor grounds. ‘No,’ Harry said, the distant look coming to his eyes again. ‘Not yet. I’d like for this to be an occasion for celebration, not forced out of necessity. We’ll talk about it when this ends, all right?’
‘I couldn’t bring myself to go back,’ he replies simply; Draco will make of his cowardice what he will.
,’ Potter snarled, about to charge Draco before Dumbledore held out a hand. ‘Professor, I can take him –’
Harry thinks of words to explain: surely, Sirius as another omega with a soulmate would understand, but his godfather had always been certain of his person, self-assurance that does not falter. Harry doesn’t have the words; what he has are fading dreams and fleeting impressions.
He had not known that Potter’s favourite food group was grains, and that he hated the smell of bacon, which was absurd.
An inexplicable fury rose up in Draco, obliterating his common sense and his mercy. Harry fucking Potter wouldn’t let himself take the Dark Mark even if he had been forced at wand point. He would make it clear to Lord Voldemort that he would fight him every step of the way. Fucking Harry Potter wouldn’t become the Dark Lord’s
? Draco couldn’t imagine why. The bugger was hopeless at school – well, except maybe at Herbology, Draco admitted to himself reluctantly. Still, Longbottom wasn’t exceptionally good at the subject.
Yaxley snarled, brandishing his wand. Draco put up a Shield Charm with a little wave of his hand. The brutal-faced Death Eater snapped his wand down again, casting another
The room bursts into hoots and shouts, and Hermione merely laughs, thinking it another of Fred’s jokes. She tells him she wants the quill by end of the week, to which he dramatically swears upon his turtle’s grave.
The elderly wizard is in his office at Hogwarts. He is at first surprised, then alarmed by Harry’s incoherent, panicked shouting for him to
‘You have sensed it,’ she says, her brown eyes dark with worry, absently casting a Cleaning Spell over her bloodied robes.
‘Mum’s talked about him before,’ Zabini replied. ‘An old wizard with many powerful connections. Apparently, he knows Gwenog Jones.’
‘Draco …’ Pansy stretched out her hand, and he took it, her fingers curling against his palm. ‘Draco, you are a brilliant Healer. You have saved so many lives … but there is a limit to what our magic can do. There is no going against the Unseen Gods, you know that.’
!’ Malfoy shouts, sitting up, spots of bright red on his cheeks. ‘Well, do you hate me now? We bonded the night we slept together. You don’t realise it, do you? Why do you think you find me so fucking enticing? Because you are my mate, and you can only find me attractive.’
‘Not at university, I’m afraid,’ Zabini says with a smirk. ‘Unlike our Draco, who chose to apply himself so industriously, I have been gadding about for my dear old mother.
Granger, who was wearing her well-honed hollow-cheeked look of disapproval and disgust, flicked her wand at the mess on the ground – their bags had split open in their fight – and sent the scattered things back into the bags. Draco grabbed his bag, scooping his wand up from where it had rolled on the ground.
Draco reached out, and ran his thumb along Harry’s jaw. Harry shuddered. Draco leaned in, and pressed his lips against Harry’s jaw. Harry placed a hand on the back of Draco’s head, and tilted his head back gently.
Draco blanches. Dumbledore is right: he doesn’t have to play by wizards’ rules when it comes to magic. ‘You think it’s You-Know-Who that took him,’ he says, and sees by their ashen looks that he guessed rightly. He swallows hard, closing his eyes briefly.
Draco imagined that underneath the Invisibility Cloak, Potter was staring, gawping stupidly, pale and agog, his piercing green eyes fixed on Draco’s pumping hand. He imagined Potter licking his lips, a pink tongue darting out to wet soft lips. He imagined Potter’s cock hardening, his pants growing tighter.
He laughed bitterly. ‘And? What do you want me to say, Parkinson? What do you expect? I don’t care for your apology – it means nothing to me. You don’t mean it. You’re only trying to get me to endorse your entry into proper society now, are you? Save your little lies, Parkinson, for those who care.’
Harry was abruptly gripped by the darkest self-loathing. How long had he been sleepwalking through his days? He had taken up Kingsley’s offer of a place in the Auror Office, working to bring down Death Eaters and other Dark wizards, all this while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to anything else happening because he didn’t want to know, didn’t want to feel.
‘Well done, Potter,’ he crowed, holding out a hand. ‘You win. Fine, you can help us. I’ll let you in.’
Kissing Harry was holding a roiling ocean in his hands. It was exciting and unbelievable and infinitely frightening. When they parted, Draco nuzzled his nose against Harry’s cheek, and kissed the corner of his jaw like he had always wanted to.
Draco looked at him incredulously. ‘No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man,’ he spat. ‘How would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.’
Albus Dumbledore tilts his head, listening, and soon enough, they hear Lily Potter’s laughter and the midwife’s soft murmuring response. Albus nods, and James flies across the small room and thunders up the stairs. The sound of the young father’s joyful and effusive greeting echoes throughout the house, joined by his wife’s teasing admonishment to
On Monday, Potter had gone to the Headmaster and spent over five hours there. Draco stood in the shadows of the corridor, cloaked in a strong Disillusionment Charm, and watched as Potter emerged from the moving gargoyle staircase. He needn’t have bothered with the Charm; Potter was deep in thought, frowning as he disappeared down the corridor. Draco didn’t follow him.
Soldiers, armed and armoured, are moving towards him, when the wind changes and the stench of iron and blood thickens in the air. It is the smell of the sea before a storm, the waves white-capped and implacable; of lightning and low dark clouds glowering with violence. It is a spear to the middle of Eltanin's chest, a blunt pounding awareness that
Potter drops the hand holding the wand, the light pooling at their feet. Shadows dip across the landscape of Potter’s face. He reaches out a hand. Draco turns his face away, closing his eyes.
Mathis raises his head, eyes calculative. ‘What purpose did killing them serve?’ he asks, voice low, measured.
‘No, I cannot,’ Harry confesses. ‘But I no longer find any excitement in pursuing schoolyard rivalries, Zabini, and I do not wish to expend too much energy questioning Malfoy’s motives.’
Harry pulls Draco in close, wrapping in the musky scent of storms and leather and steel, shivering with the promise of great, terrible violence. The green-eyed god smirks, hand cupping the back of Draco's head, the warmth bleeding into Draco's veins. "Is that a threat?"
She gripped the table’s edge, staring at the wizard with bright, green eyes. ‘Albus …’ she whispered hoarsely, and stopped, shaking her head. Without another word, she swept out of the kitchen, all the glasses in the room shattering in her wake. Harry ducked, throwing his arms around his head. When the clinking stopped, he lowered his arms and stared wide-eyed at Dumbledore.
‘Thank you,’ Draco retorted. ‘And I don’t need your sodding concern, Potter. You worry about your own affairs.’
The Veela Alena moves with effortless grace and strength, turning around occasionally to check that the Malfoys are still following her. They are, as they have been doing for the past three hours. They trail after her like foolish children lured in to the hag’s oven with the promise of candy.
“I thought you had become less of a prat, but I guess not,” Potter snapped, kicking his chair back as he rose to his feet. “Come on, ferret face.”
want me, but you … is it me? What am I doing wrong? Do you need me to say something? Do you need me to make it fucking explicit? Do you need me to tell you that I –’
a prophecy to drum up some sort of story pitting Harry against the Dark Lord. Lamb chops, Narcissa?’
Draco’s breath catches in his chest. Potter’s face is twisted in misery, his trembling lips pressed together, his throat convulsing as if he is swallowing all the vitriol he wishes he could hurl at Draco. A dagger twists in the middle of Draco’s chest, hard. He aches to reach out for Potter, to soothe away the frown on his face.
Narcissa and Lucius are barely listening. They are cooing over their new little boy. Adopting a Veela child was not their first choice – even if Lucius’ grandfather was himself an adopted Veela baby – and they took this alternative only after trying for years and years for a baby to no avail.
‘Did you think I wouldn’t?’ Draco asks. ‘The most difficult thing about the past year was that firstly, I physically couldn’t go after you, and I couldn’t ask my mother to look for you, because,’ – he makes a face – ‘nobody should know about how you were breaking the sodding law.
‘Let’s go,’ Father says. ‘It’s something in the shop, is it? Well, I cannot say the old wandmaker is the most hygienic of wizards …’
“I will come to fetch you tomorrow afternoon. Healer Mitra said you are well enough to be discharged,” Potter said, surging to his feet.
Walking away when every inch of his being screams out to claim Potter is like having his skin peeled off inch by torturous inch. Draco scrunches up his face, suppressing the swell of impotent rage, his palms jammed against his eyes.
Draco picked up his sandwich, and continued eating, ignoring with fatalistic determination Potter’s gaze.
He came, mewling, back arching. He clutched Jonas to him, riding the crest of his orgasm and slowly slipping into the deeply satisfying afterglow. Jonas began to laugh, a deep rumble vibrating through his thin body.
Voldemort’s forces have withdrawn, leaving behind an eerie silence underscored by the moans of the injured and dying. Tonks is dead, and so is Fred Weasley. Remus has been grievously injured by one of Voldemort’s werewolves, who also savaged Bill Weasley. Hermione was relentlessly subjected to the Cruciatus Curse by Bellatrix Lestrange, before Mother and Aunt Andromeda leapt into a duel against their own sister.
‘Can you fly me down?’ he asks, picking up the satchel of Basilisk fangs they were carrying around with them.
Pansy opened her mouth. He got to his feet, grabbing his things blindly. Hunching his shoulders against his friends’ eyes, he scurried out of the Great Hall. It took most of his self-control not to look over at the Gryffindor table, to check if Potter was looking at him, as it had become his habit to do these days.
Zabini was standing in the middle of the empty restaurant, staring in abject horror at Harry. ‘Draco. Get up.’
Mr. Bingley, good-looking and amiable, draws most of the praise. His sisters, Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, attract some admiration for their fine gowns and London-polished manners. Mr. Hurst shows himself to be a gentleman in name only with a rather boorish remark to his wife on the slowness of servants with the wine. Bingley’s friends capture the rest of the attention.
But Draco does not see himself from the outside: his shoulders bowed under the weight of wings he does not want; his face ashen and eyes dull; his embrace around Harry tight to the point of choking. Harry wants desperately to think this is okay, this is fine—
Potter has to stop looking at him like that. It simply isn’t fair. Potter shouldn’t be allowed to look at Draco as if … as if he likes what he sees.
The Dark Lord laughs like black glass shattering. ‘Will you still fight?’ he asks. ‘Why? You know you are a dead man.’
Potter rose up, bracing himself against Draco’s chest. ‘If all you want from me is blowjobs, why do you look at me like that?’ The words were poison-tipped barbs lodged in Draco’s lungs. He thought he could hear his breath rattling in his hollow rib cage.
Draco takes a deep breath to steady himself. He rolls his shoulders, trying to relax his tensed muscles. He can do this; he can spend some time alone with Potter without completely losing it. He has managed it well enough so far, hasn’t he?
Zabini watched him, his handsome face frozen and expressionless. When Draco stopped talking, breathless with the vehemence of his words, Zabini reached out. He grabbed Draco’s left forearm, his grip pressing hard against the Mark. Draco hissed in pain and tried to pull away; Zabini wouldn’t let him.
His cry, fraught with agitation and emotion, echoes through the silent forest. Harry feels a bead of sweat trickle down his back; it is too hot beneath his jacket, despite the chill of early autumn. The forest and its denizens, spying on this absurd little scene, must now be judging Harry for making a right terrible mess of everything. Draco’s arm is still twitching beneath his grasp. The other man is looking down, his teeth gritted, hair falling in his face.
Lizzy is a year younger than Harry, their closeness in age matched with a marked similarity in thinking. She has their father’s wit, tempered by an equal measure of self-deprecation, and has such a friendly, playful disposition her company is often sought by those who know her.
had organised this public debate in the ballroom of the ritzy Hotel Everton in the heart of Diagon Alley. Admission was free, but the tabloid would earn from its extensive coverage of the event over the next few days. The term “debate” was loosely applied. It was clear opinion weight on the side of Wesley – and nothing that had unfolded over the past hour helped to sway things to Kingsbury’s side.
He tamps down on the new fear that springs up: if Harry is no longer hiding that he’s omega, that would leave him free to seek an alpha partner. And he cannot, because he is bonded to Draco—and what if he doesn’t want to be? How does Draco set him free? Harry is looking at him in concern; some of his horror must have leaked across his face, so he forces a smile.
. I have never found omegas disgusting. It’s only my own insecurity. You already left me once for France. It’ll be so pathetic if the only way I can get you to stay is because we are soulmates. I … I wanted to be your
Alena flits towards the two Veela waiting in the middle of the clearing. Lit by the soft, golden light spilling through the gap in the canopy, the Veelas are ethereal: luminous skin, long blond hair, and bright sparkling eyes. Their smiles glitter like thin ice on a warm winter’s day. The woman next to Alena is holding a bundle of brown cloth.
‘That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,’ Slughorn said, waving his hand expansively. ‘It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.’
Draco’s eyes dropped, and settled on Potter’s lips. Why had he not noticed before how the bottom lip was just that little bit fuller than the top lip? He imagined catching it gently between his teeth and sucking on it.
The night air was freezing cold against Draco’s heated skin. For a moment, he was caught by the perfection of the night sky – the liberal swaths of stars, the completeness of the universe. His hand shaking, Draco pointed his wand into the sky and shouted, ‘
When Draco woke up, it was to the highly satisfying scene of Harry tucked up against his body. Harry’s head was on his chest, and when he bent his head, he could smell the citrusy shampoo his love used.
He is in Diagon Alley with his godfathers and Minnie to get Harry’s school supplies, his Hogwarts letter tucked safely in his pocket. It seems like the rest of wizarding Britain has the same idea. Harassed parents are herding overly excited children along, often failing to rein them in. The street is lined on both sides by many shops with marvellously magical windows. Harry’s eyes are jumping from shop front to shop front, as he gawps in awe at everything.
Harry sits up with a sigh. He might as well visit his godfathers; it has been a little over a week since he last saw them. They are happy to see him, Sirius accusing him of neglecting them. Harry grins, glad to be sitting at the dinner table with his godfathers, listening to them talk about their day and telling them about his. There were moments during the war, when he had constant nightmares about losing both Sirius and Moony, but they are here now: scarred, but contented with the life they have rebuilt with the end of the Second Wizarding War.
’ —Ron snarls viciously in the direction of an unconscious Professor Lockhart sprawled a distance away in the dirt— ‘tried to snatch my wand. It wasn’t working properly, remember, so the spell went wrong and there was an explosion. Harry managed to jump out of the way, and you pushed the rest of us. You saved us, including him,’ he glares at Lockhart. ‘He didn’t want to help us! He didn’t care about Ginny at all!’
Harry flings himself onto his back, removing his glasses and rubbing his fists across his face. He stares up at the blurry ceiling. He should have been prepared for this, when he moved in with Draco two years ago. Maybe he should be surprised that it has taken as long as it has for a situation like this to happen. Draco is, of course, always so careful and considerate about hiding his relationships from Harry.
The others turn to look at her, disconcerted. Ron understands first, his freckles stark against his white face, and he starts scrambling over the wall of dead bodies, not seeming to notice when his hand sinks into soft, torn flesh. ‘
He looks towards the stairs, and sighs once more. He shakes his head, straightens his robes, and makes his way upstairs.
Harry can only blink, taken aback. Chuckling, Sirius steps forward, saying: ‘Hullo, Mr Ollivander. It is good to see that you haven’t changed a bit.’
‘Malfoys – the Death Eaters! The bastards who sucked Voldemort’s dick! The murderous pieces of shit that deserve to rot in Azkaban! I know what people are saying about Draco
He shook his head; not the time to figure out Luna’s riddles at the moment. He turned around to face Parkinson and Zabini. They were alone on the lawn, the doors to the Great Hall creaking close as the teachers shut Hogwarts up for the night. The rapid cracks of Disapparition echoed from the gates.
‘Let us put it to Draco. He is turning seventeen soon, isn’t he? Almost a man,’ the Dark Lord was derisive. ‘Well, now, Draco, you have another chance to save your family. Will you assist Jackson in his experiments?’
But goblins are forgotten the moment the vault door opened and Harry saw the fortune his parents have left him. Minnie told him he needn’t take out too much, since she or his godfathers are more than capable and willing to buy his school supplies for him. So he took enough for treats and presents he can get for his guardians now that he has some money –
He kisses the other man, lips pressing hard and insistent, their hands tangled in each other’s hair. Harry scrapes one hand down Draco’s side, fingernails scratching lightly, stopping at his arse, cupping and squeezing an arse cheek. Their mouths fall open, Harry panting into Draco’s mouth, their tongues meeting. Draco chases the taste of Harry, sweeping his tongue in the hot wetness of his lover’s mouth.
‘Disgusting. The boy brought it here. I saw him.’ People are starting to stare at Harry too. ‘Wait, there’s something … queer about him,’ another hiss, ‘Do you … see it? He’s still attached to the living world! The boy is still half-alive!’
Harry took as much cock as he could into his mouth, a hand wrapped around the base of the shaft that pumped in time with the bobbing of his head. Malfoy was hissing incoherent vulgarities, his thighs trembling with the effort of staying still. Harry looked up. Malfoy hadn’t taken his eyes off him, eyes so intense they scorched against Harry’s skin.
Harry is coming too, his body jerking as his cum spills across his belly, warm and pearly. He whispers back: ‘I know.’
Harry is perturbed, but of course, there is nothing that can deter Hermione Granger when she’s certain she has the right plan. It doesn’t help that everyone else is so enthusiastic about it. The news even spreads to the other Houses—
‘It would be unwise for you to speak any further of it, Lizzy, for you have no proof of Darcy’s terrible behaviour,’ Jane cautions.
Watching him, Draco feels a great, unspeakable dread. Harry could not be so calm, knowing how many of his friends are dead. Draco may be the dramatic one, but Harry has always been more compassionate. He is taking the ruination around them far too sedately. It doesn’t make sense; Draco wants to reach out and shake his mate by the shoulders, demanding to know what he’s hiding.
sounds like a brilliant idea, Potter. Teach the convicted Death Eater how to gain entry into Hogwarts – why does that sound terribly familiar?’
‘Harry? Harry, what’s wrong?’ Sirius asks, craning his neck to look. ‘Harry, I’m here. I’m all right.’
‘That’s the only way!’ Harry exclaims, wrenching away from the man, whose grip is getting tighter on his shoulder. ‘I had to die.’
‘Yes, dear, you’ve said, but what does it matter now?’ she says irritably. ‘The woman’s dead; her son killed the Dark Lord.
Draco no longer smiles like he used to—like he is teasing a delicious secret—or laughs at all—the sound that would ignite liquid light in Harry’s chest—but it’s fine. Because they are still soulmates, soul-bonded; they still have each other. On the nights Draco crumbles into soundless weeping, it is Harry who will hold him, because this is his fault.
Something shifts in Draco’s eyes, and he blinks, coming back a little to himself. He stops, looking around at the living room littered with the broken things his wings have swept to the floor. He looks down at the bloodied tips of his claws. He inhales sharply. The wings recede and the claws shrink, leaving behind nothing but the smell of dusty feathers and burning garlic. Harry quickly extinguishes the stove top in the kitchen behind him with a jab of his wand.
He didn’t think it would be this difficult, saying good-bye to his parents, the sound of his heartbeat drowning out the
that he thinks about it, there is something perhaps in his impulse to dominate: in saving Malfoy from Azkaban, he clutches the other man within the hold of an obligation.
"The circumstances are not ideal," says the frazzled, brown-haired alpha to the king's left, speaking fluent Parseltongue. Potter snorts. She shoots him a warning glare. "We should have written before we came, of course," she continues, looking at Eltanin. "We do apologise for alarming you."
, not Potter in that slightly combative way that has always defined their relationship. Because he asked him a question he hasn’t really stopped to consider. Because Malfoy … has simply always been Malfoy. He may say the name and think it rather differently than before, but … he’s never thought to define the other boy by his name. What’s important has only ever been how he feels about Draco Malfoy. He sees now that Malfoy –
Draco was now dead to Zabini. He didn’t just ignore Draco; Draco simply didn’t exist. To his credit, he didn’t tell anybody why he had cut Draco so completely. Nott, Millie and Tracey Davis, whom they weren’t close to, thought it was only another tiff; they knew Draco pissed people so easily. Pansy worried.
His lack of understanding bothers him more than he likes to admit, which is probably what leads to him taking the empty spot next to Zabini during Herbology. Neville looks at him in surprise, shrugs, and turns around to join Harry, who glances over his shoulder to look at Draco. His gaze is merely curious, before he looks away to discuss the day’s assignment with Nev.
‘I don’t have a choice!’ Draco snarled, shaking out his sleeve. ‘He was going to kill Father and he would have killed Mother too! He – he had a thing about sons making up for fathers’ mistakes or something – I – I had to do it – I don’t have a choice! This is the only way I can save my family.’
‘There’s something I miss doing,’ Harry whispered and in a swift motion, flipped them over. ‘Scoot up,’ he commanded, hands on Malfoy’s hips, pushing him up to lean against the headboard. He sat between Malfoy’s legs, a hand hovering over the fly of his trousers as he checked Malfoy’s expression.
Footsteps clacked outside the room, and Draco looked up expectantly. Unfortunately, Potter accompanied the Healer, and the same disconcerting, obsessive
Zabini grins, rubbing his reddened thumb. ‘We’ll see after this weekend, shall we? And the experiment succeeds, I want you to introduce me to your friend Longbottom.’
“Well, he knew you had Veela ancestry. The potion we used –” At this point, Healer Mitra shifted uncomfortably, but apparently decided Draco deserved full disclosure and plugged on, “ – the potion we used is based on the one You-Know-Who used to create a rudimentary body for himself.
Draco’s eyes are flashing quicksilver. He leans in, smashing his fists against Harry’s chest, his knuckles digging in. Harry staggers, but does not let go. The light flickers uncertainly above their heads, shadows leaping around them.
Lizzy is quite certain she need not concern herself with the Muggle again; Harry and Jane too, considering the strength of Lizzy’s harsh rejection. By the next day, her rage and astonishment have worn away to amusement and annoyance. Yet she encounters Darcy on her walk to Netherfield, to which Harry and Jane have already Disapparated. He has plainly been waiting for her, and passes her a letter before walking away.
Harry wonders why the bloody hell his friends are trying to insinuate impossible things. He suspects they might have a bet going on, whatever ridiculous bollocks they choose to put good money on. It
Draco couldn’t get the words out, his mouth too raw and painful. He couldn’t be sure he even remembered how to talk. He managed a low grunting, the chains clinking as he moved with greater agitation.
Harry is frozen for a heartbeat. The room is silent, and Harry hears birds calling outside his window, as the world is slowly rousing from the night’s sleep. He stares at Malfoy, hunched over on himself, long hair spilling over his shoulders in a shining sheet. This man he has wanted and wanted and wanted for years, whom he tasted for a night, believing it was only for the once. The man he has been trying to resist wanting again.
‘There must be a way to make it taste better,’ Harry would mutter, scribbling down notes. ‘Or to reduce the side-effects on my magic.’ Once, he looked up and called Draco’s name with such joy, Draco had to take a moment to stop his wings from unfurling. ‘I’ve figured it out!’ he said, eyes shining, not realising what he had done to Draco.
Draco releases his hold on the sill, and drops into the bushes two storeys below, branches snapping beneath his weight. He rolls as he lands, spitting out leaves and twigs. Returned to his human form, he lies in the bushes, his arms and legs spread-eagled around him. He stares up at the grey, cloudy sky, his skin covered in goose pimples as the wind ripples through the quiet grounds of Malfoy Manor.
‘No, because none of us would be stupid enough to waste time pulling idiotic pranks,’ Draco retorted.
‘I know very well how best to get through a heat, and I've come to offer help, considering that you saved me,’ Malfoy says coolly. ‘In case you forget, I’m an omega.’
Narcissa Malfoy has never gone so deep into a forest, where the trees grow so closely together even the summer afternoon sunlight is filtered dark green. She keeps tripping over thick roots twisting like ropes over the forest floor. Lucius holds her arm tightly, pulling her up. The tall, thin man looks ahead towards their guide, eyes occasionally darting to flickers of shadows amongst the dark trees.
“Fine,” Potter said loudly, kicking his chair aside; Draco winced when the chair crashed into a bookshelf. “Fine, I don’t have to deal with your fucking shit! So much for saving your life a
Minnie ignores his pleading look, turning away to smile at a middle-aged couple that greet her excitedly when they see her.
Lizzy finds it impossible to continue resenting Darcy for this reason. After all, Jane and Bingley have found their way back together again, and Darcy has been nothing but supportive of his friend’s choices.
‘Do you think I encourage them, Potter?’ the prince snarls, running a hand through his long blonde hair as he does when he is distressed. ‘Salazar, I ignore their letters and Floo calls, and I tell the house elves to return their gifts, but the whole ruddy world seems to think I’m some sort of hedonistic
Harry ignores him, sweat rolling down his face. They are underground, and there aren’t any doors, so the Martyrs would have to Apparate or Disapparate to get around. They think Harry and Malfoy are trapped without their wands. They think they would be able to hurt Malfoy. Harry sneers. He has faced Voldemort several times and survived; he is not about to die by the hands of these fucking morons.
Harry does not think there is anything to his partiality for Malfoy’s company. It hardly means a thing that he finds Malfoy’s acerbic humour intriguing, the acid that characterised him in school neutralised – or that he enjoys hearing about Malfoy’s eye-opening adventures in the Muggle world. Never mind that his perception of the other gentleman is now shaded warmly by a close understanding of how courageous – and desperate – Malfoy was to take the path he had after the war. These changes to Harry’s feelings towards his former schoolyard enemy are but natural consequences of proximity, frequency and conversation.
‘He won’t intercede with Dumbledore on our behalf?’ Mother asks, and sighs. ‘Oh, perhaps I should have gone. He has always liked me better than you or Bella.’
‘How can I hate him, Luc?’ Harry wanted to know. ‘How can I when I still want him so fucking much it hurts to even breathe in a world without him?’
‘You don’t need to be such a bastard!’ Harry snarls. ‘I’m trying, and if you are going to be such a fucking asshole about it, I’m starting to forget why I’m even bothering in the first place.’
Draco cants his hips downwards, his semi hard-on brushing against Harry’s crotch. ‘What do you think, Potter?’ he asks deliberately.
The creature facing an insurmountable loss, and deciding to lose himself in the wordless joyful exultation of power in killing: he paints his anguish on the world in blood.
‘It’ll work to our advantage then, won’t it?’ Draco asks excitedly. ‘We only need to find him—after we have the diadem—and we could finish him all at once!’
In the bed next to Harry, Ron rolls over, peering blearily and asking what’s the matter. He sees Draco and jolts up with a glad cry. ‘Draco, you’re back!’ he exclaims, bounding across the room to tackle his friend into a bear hug.
Draco nodded. He was used to death threats by now, but to have somebody use the Angel’s Trumpet on him … whoever it was hated him almost as much as he hated himself.
Draco thinks Harry should be the princess, so that he has an excuse to take him and hide him in a tower away from the Dark Lord. There is a sort of stillness within Harry now, vastly different from his frenetic attitude last year. It’s as if watching You-Know-Who rise from the grave has given him an anchor that must end in a death.
‘Shopping in Diagon Alley,’ Luc shot him a flinty look of loathing. ‘Is that a crime, Auror Potter?’
It is easy enough to find Voldemort in the burned-out husks of Hogsmeade. His monsters are sleeping or fighting with each other; some of them try attacking, but Harry’s spells are dead-on, and Draco easily claws them aside. They slip through the night, leaving behind wails of pain and rage—heralding their arrival to the Dark Lord.
Draco relented because well, this was his mother after all, and he would spare her all the time he had in the world. They went out of the house, following the path through the gardens to the secret one hidden in plain sight. They went up to the Grecian-style gazebo in the western part of the gardens and after walking round it in a particular way, stepped out the other side and into Serpentina Malfoy’s Garden – or as Draco called it when he was a child, Serpent Garden.
Mother grabs his knee, stilling his leg, and gives him a slow, glittering smile that means trouble when they are at home. He looks at her sheepishly, tilting his head; if he looks adorable enough, Mother might just forget his transgression by the time they are home. Besides, this is
Snape knelt onto the cold hard stones beside Draco, his hands gentle and shaking as he murmured healing spells rapidly under his breath. Draco tried to tell to him that it was pointless, that he was too broken to be fixed but his words were still lost and he could only think of the pain twisting in his bones.
Harry’s lips pressed against his. He had pulled his hand out of Draco’s grasp, and placed it on Draco’s chin. Their eyes remained open and staring. It was excruciatingly embarrassing to be so
Dumbledore blinked, and smiled in assent. ‘I believe he has been weakened when he tried to kill you, but yes, I do think he is in hiding and in some form or another, very much alive.’
‘Thank you,’ Draco whispers, slipping in between him and Granger, his face flushed with embarrassment not because the Gryffindors didn’t cheer for him, but because of the wide grin on Potter’s face.
He leans in closer, his eyes dark and molten. Draco feels Potter’s breath on his lips, his heart thundering in his ears, his stomach clenched. Fear and longing twist in Draco’s chest, hard.
‘A lot of folks are in London at this time, it seems,’ Finnigan comments. ‘Ah, you will not be able to guess whom we saw at a
Harry dances willingly enough, not so much for sheer enjoyment of the act, but for the practical reason of replacing his memories of dancing with a certain blonde gentleman with more recent encounters with other partners. He does not wish to be reminded of that wizard in any shape or form – not in the glint of candlelight on light hair that causes him to turn unconsciously; not in the sight of gentlemen bearing similar figures; and certainly not in the lack of warmth in the hands of every partner he dances with now. He cannot bear to waste any effort in such meaningless thoughts, and undertakes the night’s dancing and other enjoyments with all sincerity.
Harry nods, but doesn’t look at him. Draco takes Harry’s fists in his hands, sliding closer to him on the seat. ‘Are you afraid?’ he asks quietly.
His elation from getting a wand has gone, and his heart is sinking rapidly. From the school robes on the other boy, he knows that this is a fellow first-year. He bites his bottom lip, somehow certain that the schooldays he has imagined of making new friends and doing homework in the library and playing Quidditch might not go the way he wants.
‘Harry was starving, so we started dinner earlier,’ Sirius explains, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who is on his second helping. ‘You’re lucky he left some roast for you.’
His hand brushes Draco’s cheek and that touch and Potter’s words are enough. The Veela magic sings in Draco’s blood, his body heating up with the stirring of his powers. The pain – the constant pain he has endured unfailingly for the past five years – is already fading away. He can feel it – the power coursing through his veins, raw and unrestrained, triggered by Potter’s unwitting confession.
It is called the Room of Requirement, and the house elves mostly use it to store bits and bobs of the castle they no longer need, but might want in the future. ‘Ah, but it has appeared for me once when I needed a new broom, and it came as a broom closet,’ the house elf says, as the little creature brings them through the darkened corridors.
Draco takes a few moments to gather his breath, although his vicious glare is eloquent enough to make up for his temporary silence. ‘I’m
Those soft, pink lips quirked into a smile. ‘That would explain the number of articles denouncing the Slytherin Registry. Some of them were even written by proper academics. I must say, I was rather impressed, Potter.’
Draco shakes his head. ‘Hermione wouldn’t wait around when there are other blokes interested in her. She shouldn’t.’
?’ Bellatrix screamed, her face still pale and starved from her days on Azkaban. ‘Your beloved sister? ‘Dromeda is weak, but I thought better of you, Cissy! Looks like being a mother has weakened you!’
Harry’s heart is beating faster, his skin heating up. He clenches his fists, his palms rather damp. He must not assume – he must not, but oh! He could hope, could not he? It is hope stirring in his breast.It is hope that trembles across his skin. He treads carefully so as not to spill the hope he gathers in his hands.
The Sorting Ceremony begins. Granger and Longbottom are Sorted into Gryffindor, although the Sorting Hat took rather a while for both of them. When it comes to Draco’s turn, instead of putting the Hat on, he asks McGonagall if he might go last.
Draco sighed. He was going to attract attention whether he wanted to or not. Well, at least this might help him get laid more easily. His eyes flicked to Potter to see him gaze back steadily and intently. Draco flushed.
Rationally, he knew he should let Potter go. Out of sight, out of mind, and this ridiculous Veela infatuation would disappear. Irrationally, the thought of not seeing Potter again was a terror as potent as the Dark Lord breathing down his neck. Draco was in a wretched state of confusion.
He turns away from Harry, wrapping his arms around his knees. ‘It is difficult for me to talk about the war, because I’ve done such stupid shit for an ideal I didn’t even believe in. I thought I was trapped. You keep saying that I’ve changed, that I’m different from before, and that’s because I
Snape stood between Draco and Dumbledore. The ancient wizard slouched against the rampart wall, his baggy robes snapping in the wind. Fierce blue eyes shone out of a pale, wrinkled face. Even cornered, defeated and betrayed, Albus Dumbledore had an indomitable force of will.
‘When we met in Diagon Alley before first year, do you remember—Madam Malkin’s? I sensed it then, Veela senses are sharper, and I’m alpha, so I could tell,’ he sees the alarm on Harry’s face and adds: ‘Most alphas can’t. I’m different, I’m stronger,’ —he says it without any self-consciousness— ‘But when you’re on the potion, I can’t tell at all, so you don’t need to worry.’
He only knew the searing heat that shook him at the sight of Potter, and the overwhelming desire to touch him, to hold him in his arms, to press his lips against his, to keep him from the world. He was desperately drawn to Potter.
Moony or Dumbledore hadn’t said they could sense omegas. Harry twists his sheets in his hands, wondering how else he might have accidentally revealed himself. But it is true that Draco is ridiculously powerful. He does magic differently from the rest of them, to Harry’s fascination and Hermione’s consternation: he often disparages the directions in spell books, using his magic in ways they cannot even imagine, to work the same effect. He has a wand, but leaves it in his satchel most of the time.
Zabini stormed out of the room, slamming the door shut, his magic shattering the lamps in Draco’s room. Draco sat in darkness for a few moments, gathering his breath. ‘
It’s a lucky thing Harry is short and dresses terribly; one of Malfoy’s favourite greetings in the morning is to disparage the jeans Harry wears.
And Snape completes this wretched picture: a black-robed spectre looming at the foot of the bed, face pale and bloodied, eyes cold and emotionless. He turns before Harry could decide to blame him, and strides over. He ignores the way Draco steps between them, thrusting his closed fist over the blond’s shoulder into Harry’s face.
He knows now what it means to be omega: to be omega is to be weak. That is why they must hide it from Voldemort and his followers. Minnie and the rest will deny it, but he knows it, and he understands why Dumbledore wants him to hide it: it is a flaw in Harry their enemies won’t hesitate to exploit. Harry has learned as much in his readings – even if he doesn’t understand much of the dense text – that sometimes, people will pound at the cracks to destroy anything to get what they want.
Jonas nodded, reaching out to pull Draco back in. ‘I see you and I want you. I say to your lord, “Give me pretty one and I will bring you the man you see.” So he give me you …’
want him gone, he has gone and told him they are soulmates in the worst possible way. Coercing Harry Potter, telling him he doesn’t have a choice—this will only make Harry run harder away from him.
the Sorting Hat nearly put me in Slytherin and perhaps I should have gone there – might have helped me kill Voldemort earlier.’
He was bewildered. What did she mean he wasn’t happy? The war was over, Voldemort vanquished, Wizarding Britain clambering back to her feet. He was in a pub surrounded by his friends, an ice-cold pint in his hand, laughter in the air.
‘Oh, I knew from the moment we met in the Entrance Hall at Hogwarts,’ Sirius says, passing Draco the dinner rolls.
Draco rents a poky flat in the Muggle neighbourhood nearest to Diagon Alley. He doesn’t ask Harry to Apparate them there; Harry doesn’t ask to do so. They walk up the stairs, the sound of shouting and blaring tellies echoing around them.
Dumbledore stood no chance against Minnie, when she was on such a rampage. You would obey her, even if you don’t understand how you have come to do it. That was how Harry learned why Voldemort killed his parents.
For a moment, Draco could not figure out what Snape was talking about. Then he remembered his aborted plan to kill Dumbledore using a cursed necklace. So much had happened since then: first and foremost, he was now snogging Harry Potter.
Harry tells Mary the unfortunate tale later, when Jane and Kitty are elsewhere in the Gardiner house. Mary is astonished that Jane might have fallen in love for a Muggle, indignant at the suggestion of Darcy’s role in turning Bingley away, and furious with Lydia for her errant selfishness. She is full of censure for their youngest sister, which is unsurprising for Mary and Lydia did not get along, and Harry barely manages to stop Mary’s tirade in time before Jane and Kitty join them in the drawing room.
Minnie doesn’t reproach him: she saves her rage for Dumbledore and Snape’s graves. She shakes her fists and thunders her fury in the empty air before the vaults in the deepest part of Hogwarts castle. ‘You will not take my son before me!’ she screams and wraps her arms around Harry, her face lined and ancient with grief.
‘Mother said your parents could not have babies, but one day, they came home from a holiday with you. Nobody knows where you came from, and nobody has really seen you until you were
The front door above slams open, and Harry perks up, expecting to hear Sirius’ footsteps thumping down the stairs into the kitchen, but there is only silence, and after a beat, Moony frowns, slowly rising to his feet and reaching for his wand on the table. A wretched scream tears through the house: ‘
She grins down at him, picking up the broom and holding his hand with the other. ‘Do you have another favourite pudding you haven’t told me?’
Draco paused in the midst of washing his face and examined himself in the mirror foggy with age. He had to admit he looked wretched: his pale skin had taken on a grey tinge, his usually shiny hair lank and greasy. The areas beneath his eyes were bruised from the lack of sleep.
The door banged open and Snape came running in. He looked murderous. He knelt down by Draco, shoving Potter aside roughly. Bending his head over Draco’s chest, he began murmuring an incantation. It was soft and soothing, almost like music. Draco could feel his wounds knitting themselves up, the fire dampening.
Draco’s head snapped up, and he fixed Potter with a glare. “I would rather not owe you anymore, thanks.”
He retreated to his bedroom with relief, thinking he was safe but Zabini barged in without knocking. The other wizard flicked his wand, locking the door, before Draco could protest.
A fog shrouds part of his memory—between facing Voldemort’s Killing Curse, and waking up in Draco’s blood-soaked arms. He thinks distinctly that it has something to do with Sirius, but when he sees his godfathers again, he can only say: ‘He is waiting for you. He wouldn’t leave you behind this time,’ which is nonsense, because Moony recovers quickly enough.
Next to Harry, Malfoy was stirring. Harry didn’t need his glasses to see that the Polyjuice Potion was slowly wearing off over the course of the night. Even as he watched, the dark hair was lightening, the round face lengthening. When Malfoy stretched, his body stayed stretched. He opened his eyes and Harry was looking into the familiar grey eyes he loved. He couldn’t help himself; he leaned in and dropped a peck on Malfoy’s lips.
She shakes her head, smiling wryly. ‘Well, Hermione did say you haven’t the slightest idea that I might fancy you’ —he is mortified at the thought that the girls have discussed him— ‘I should have known that you don’t see anyone but the prat Malfoy. You don’t have to look so guilty,’ she says with a laugh, ‘I knew this even before I decided to say something. I didn’t want to give up on my childhood crush without at least trying.’
Around Harry, the party spun on, the laughter elongating and dissipating into the smoky, beery air. His friends’ faces were bright and sparkling in the orange light, wreathed in smiles and soaked in booze.
Draco continues to sleep in Harry’s bed, holding his hand to soothe him—his heat is more difficult than usual this month—even though he has been given a room next door. He tries not to think,
‘A task, sir?’ Borgin’s face twisted momentarily, realising that he had just addressed a sixteen-year-old boy with the respect due a lord.
Harry sighed, munching on his cookie. He was staring unseeingly out of the window, the grey of the buildings and streets melding together. A small, hunched-over figure caught the corner of his eye and he turned quickly, just in time to catch the sight of Luc rounding the corner. He was on his feet and through the door before he had time to process the spilled tea down his front.
‘I’m not going to get you any other way,’ Malfoy hisses, wrenching his hands from Harry’s grip. ‘So, I will settle for having you like this. You detest me, but you cannot deny that your body wants me. Take me, Potter, you know you want to, and I will let you this time.’
Harry feels Malfoy’s eyes on him, but he is disinclined to give the other man any notice. Hermione is correct (as she so often is) in her assertion that Malfoy must be here for a purpose. It is singular that the gentleman thinks it proper for him to impose on Harry’s hospitality. Abruptly, Harry spots the ottoman scuttling behind the couch on which Bingley, Darcy and Malfoy are seated. He swallows his oath. Thank Godric the Muggles are sufficiently engaged by Mrs. Bennet’s descriptions of a ball she attended at Netherfield under its previous tenant. Before Harry could devise a ploy to stop the ottoman, it makes to dart around the couch, intent on dashing into shins as its favourite form of mischief.
‘Careful what you accuse me of there, Potter,’ Draco said silkily. ‘Mother knows people on the Wizengamot – and we know your experience with the law hasn’t been very good, has it.’
‘Ah, but you are most certainly not a gentleman who accepts justifications that are not at least four pages along, I suspect,’ Lizzy says with a smile.
Mr. Bennet is a self-professed scholar of the Fae and their magic long-disappeared from the world of men, and chooses to spend his days in his well-stocked library, moving himself only to tease his wife and children. He is so odd a mixture of sarcastic humour, selfishness and reserve that the experience of thirty years is insufficient for Mrs. Bennet in comprehending him. It is unfortunate that Mrs. Bennet is a woman of mean understanding and flighty temper, which ill enables her to exert any form of control or influence over her husband’s egocentrism.
he and Draco are soulmates; was it his backup plan to have a half-mad alpha kill Voldemort to avenge his mate?
‘And when I was finally released, and I thought I would look for you and hex you or jinx you or something for fucking toying with me – because I thought, you must be. Why would you have chosen
‘Don’t look at me like that,’ Draco said, furious. ‘I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work – I can stop you!’
Draco tensed. He was acutely aware of Potter’s arm around him, and wished he could lean back and put his head on Potter’s shoulder to better catch his delicious scent.
They hear a commotion then: people moving in a widening ripple away from the spot Harry came. Without a word, he turns away and begins running back, Regulus close on his heels. Lying in the sand, wriggling like a maggot, is a naked, white creature with red eyes and slit nostrils. It opens its mouth to wail, revealing a toothless mouth. Everyone is looking at it with morbid fascination.
"I might if he were mine to influence, but Blaise is his own person, and I am certainly not in possession of any omega," Eltanin retorts.
‘It’s all right, dear child,’ she says gently. ‘I’m fine. There is no need to be so scared. See?’ She moves her arm up and down. ‘There was no harm done.’
‘You silly little Muggle-lover,’ Draco said contemptuously. ‘In 1832, Benedict Weasley kidnapped and killed six Muggles. He took them into the woods and released them so he could hunt them down like animals. The one who stopped him was Erasmus Malfoy, who was an Auror and went on to become Minister for Magic.’
‘You don’t need wings to fly.’ Draco rolls onto his side, so he can see Harry’s outline in the dim light. The dark-haired boy is lying on his back.
The kiss was slow and warm and gentle, both of them scared of breaking this delicate balance. After a while, Draco pulled away, tucking his head under Harry’s chin, his heart pounding in his ears.
to see it as Malfoy asking Harry out for some reason. It wasn’t a date – not blooming likely. It was – it was – well, he hadn’t the foggiest idea why Malfoy would ask him to dinner, but the only way to find out was to turn up, wasn’t it?
There are also the paintings of Malfoy ancestors, heavy gilt frames hanging everywhere, but most of them are empty of their subjects. ‘Godric, I don’t know where they are,’ Draco shrugged. ‘A few left when Grandfather disowned us, and a few more after society cut us. The rest disappeared when I sorted Gryffindor.’
Healer Mitra had a brisk, professional manner, his words detached and clinical. Draco’s mind provided the remembered agony and deserved shrieking.
Remus’s fears about other alphas are unfounded. It is as if the alphas, even with their weak human senses, can taste the foulness around him—none of them ever tries to approach him. ‘We can tell, you know,’ a classmate tells him. ‘That you have a mate. It feels … dangerous to try anything on you, even though we know your alpha isn’t here.’
Seeing the consternation on Harry’s face, he continues: ‘It’s traditional for the mother-in-law to send a signet ring to the family’s new bride. This marks you as a Malfoy, and it’ll give you access to all Malfoy property.’
"I much prefer this anyway. This is impressive, what you have managed to achieve," Potter looks at him, expression sincere. "This only looks like a bunch of weeds to me."
Draco stared at him in disbelief. Quidditch? His friend thought he would buy a cursed necklace to win a
have the choice.’ Ollivander gestures to the two wands on the counter. ‘Which will it be, dear boy? Choose wisely, for I have a feeling it will determine the course of your future.’
It would have off-putting for Draco to think Harry fancies him, when he has always sneered at romantic relationships. ‘What a waste of bloody time!’ he said, when Dean Thomas started going out with Susan Bones. ‘They aren’t going to last a year.’ And he was right: they broke up after a month. He turned down everyone who asked him out, except Nolan.
They served their detention with Filch on Friday night. The bitter old Squib set them to the utterly meaningless task of smoothening the scratched surfaces of old desks. Draco thought it would be easy enough until Filch opened the door to the brightly lit storeroom and he saw the veritable mountain of desks.
People were staring at him, agog, in particular a small, pale man with thinning dark hair and an unfortunately egg-shaped head. He was staring at Harry in outright disbelief, his mouth actually hanging open. No, it was more than disbelief; it was horror. Harry’s alarm bells rang. There was usually only one type of person who would respond that way to him: a man who had done something wrong.
Like Draco, he has seen that the girl is only nervous, which is why she is attempting to cover it up with bluster. Harry invites the two of them to have lunch. Draco stares at him, a little impressed by easily Harry persuades all of them to do things his way.
It takes Albus a few more minutes to thoroughly Obliviate her, and when he is finished, he lets her go to sleep with a sigh. ‘I’m sorry I had to do that, Poppy,’ he says sombrely, standing over her unconscious form. ‘But this child could be important, and I will leave nothing to chance. It will be my unfortunate duty to tell the Potters their child is omega.’
Draco rolled his eyes, suppressing his grin. ‘Yeah, yeah. I suppose I do have you to thank for distracting Slughorn so I can steal the potions.’
Potter plopped himself down next to him, sprawling with his legs stretched out. Draco sank further into the cushions. Potter took a sip of his wine, and gave a hum of appreciation. Draco sipped as well. The wine was delicious, slipping down his throat lush as velvet.
When he starts taking unwilling forays into Voldemort’s mind, he is determined to turn this to his advantage, no matter Dumbledore’s warning that this is one of Voldemort’s ploys. ‘Don’t let him into your head,’ the old wizard urges. ‘That’s what he wants.’
Goyle managed to sit Crabbe back down. Zabini huffily slammed the door shut and threw himself onto his seat. Pansy was still stroking Draco’s hair comfortingly.
Laughter causes the two of them to look over. ‘Oh heavens, you will make quite a spoiled brat out of him, won’t you?’ the male Veela exclaims.
He groans. There is, of course, only one person enough of a wanker to do that. What in the name of Merlin’s balls is he doing
‘I am here with two of my sisters to take in the delights of the city. It has been a rather dull few months in the country,’ Harry says with some jest. ‘I am pleased to find the two of you so well! It has been a few years, has not it? Merlin, how time passes us by!’
‘You need to stop getting between me and Voldemort,’ Harry whispers, his hand shaking as he touches Draco’s face. ‘You keep getting hurt.’ He looks up, points his wand at the gravestone looming over them. ‘
‘Do you mock me, brother? Do you not invent reasons to fly to the farther reaches of our estate to escape our dear mother’s anxieties about the ball, and how she might endeavour to bring her lovely daughters before Mr. Bingley?’ Lizzy turns to Jane. ‘She would have you wedded to the gentleman by the end of the night, and the wizarding world would lose its greatest Herbologist.’
Harry is amused. ‘It should,’ he agrees. ‘But I often find myself concerned for their potential suitors instead. It would after all, fall on me as their brother to tidy any unfortunate messes they might leave behind.’
He is out of the side gate by the time Draco catches up with him, his unyielding grip yanking him back. He whirls around, incandescent with fury, jerking his arm away sharply. Out here in the moonless night, he cannot make out Draco’s face, but he feels the throb of the other boy’s panic—and fear.
Draco falls to the bed, his wings closing around the two of them. Their rapid breathing rasp in the abrupt silence of the room, no longer filled with the wanton slapping of naked bodies. Draco holds his mate close to him, still buried in Harry to the hilt, his ear pressed to the hot, damp chest.
‘I am afraid not. My mother does not like house elves,’ the dark man replies. ‘She has everything working by magic at home – quite a fascinating set-up, but my mother is creative with her magic, as you can imagine. But – house elves – it so happens that thanks to my
‘Why did you brag about it on the train then, you stupid little fool?’ Zabini said contemptuously. ‘You should have kept quiet, shut up about it. You are in
Potter pressed his fingertips against Draco’s left cheekbone, tracing the curve down. ‘Like this,’ he said and deliberately kissed Draco to the left of his mouth. ‘Nobody has looked at me like that before.’
The fight took four years: four years of tedious hunts, ferocious fights, and agonising losses. Harry prefers not to think of those four years. He has had little contact with his family in those years, though he knew the Knights have tried attacking Longbourn in an attempt to destroy him. They stood no chance against Jane’s carnivorous plants, Elizabeth’s rampaging beasts, and Mary’s virulent poisons.
Draco looked up, meeting Harry’s laughing, open eyes. “Because I love you so much. Because you make me so happy. And if I’m too happy …”
‘I know you’ve changed,’ Harry says quietly into the back of Draco’s neck; Draco shivers. ‘So have I. None of us emerged from the war untouched. But … I think that what makes you Draco Malfoy … that hasn’t changed. What I mean is … you’re still the you I knew before the war, and now there are new things about you that I see and like. It’s because you are now free to be who you want to be, and I know you better now – that’s why we are friends now, you see?
“All people see when they look at us is Slytherin,” Theo continued. “They wouldn’t give us a chance no matter what, just because of what a couple of insane Slytherins chose to do. They have damned us forever.”
Remus rolls his eyes, passing the chicken to Draco. ‘What he means is that we sensed some sort of connection,’ he explains with a warning look at Sirius. ‘He told your father on the train that he’s omega, so it was James really, who put two and two together. I couldn’t get rid of the two of them after that.’
“I know she is,” Potter waved a hand airily. “I wish she would stop writing about Ginny though. Merlin knows Skeeter wrote enough about her when we were dating. It’s bloody unfair that she should hound her even after we broke up.”
‘Why did you have to put a Tracking Charm on me then? Hardly something you would do to be friendly.’
Zabini levels him with a considering gaze, a finger tapping his chin. Harry looks down at his burger, uneasy with how Zabini is looking him up and down. Does Zabini understand why Harry is so slow to spot alphas? Does he see the secret Harry is keeping?
‘All right. We’ll go together,’ she says without hesitation. ‘You are still my son. I’ll take care of you.’
“Neville told us about how you apologised to him too, you know,” Harry said, thumb on Draco’s bottom lip. “You have been apologising to everybody you meet for the past five years. I’ve heard from my friends.”
Harry wonders what makes them different from Sirius and Moony, who met when they were eleven as well. Many things: the war that dominated their whole lives; Draco’s adoption and loss of belonging; Harry’s sex being a dirty little secret—
Potter was startled. “Look, it’s all right. I expect you’ll be gone by the end of the week, anyway. Once we have the ingredients list, we can track down the buyers. There can’t be many people buying Angel’s Trumpet.”
Sirius complained, until Moony quelled him with a warning look. The werewolf pressed a kiss to Harry’s forehead, and made him promise to come for lunch every Saturday. It isn’t about his godfathers, but that he has gotten used to the luxury of a place to himself over the past few years.
“They served their time,” Harry interrupted, hand moving back to Draco’s face in a very distracting manner. “For all their flaws and crimes, they are still your parents. They love you deeply, and you love them. Right?”
“Thank Merlin you have a strong will, and because you clung to life, we were able to construct a new body for you – with Mr Potter’s help.”
Lucius seized Draco’s arm, pulling him away from Mother, shoving him forward. ‘Well, Draco? Is it? Is it Harry Potter?’
“I shouldn’t have forced you to apologise or to thank me if you didn’t want to,” Potter clarified, not looking up at him; he waved his wand again and sent the dishes into the cupboards.
Draco is resting on the side lines—it takes him more effort to produce magic along in the wizard way—when he hears Katie Bell ask Alicia Spinnet: ‘When do you reckon Ginny’s going to ask him out?’ They are looking across the room at Harry helping Ginny with her Aqua Eructo Charm, the two of them laughing when the force of the water jet sends her off her feet and into his arms.
A streak of red-gold fire caught his eye. It was Ginny Weasley, her pretty face hard with determination and rage as she battled Amycus Carrow. Draco’s stomach twisted. He was tempted to reach out for her, to take her out of the fight. She had to be safe for Potter. A spell shot over his shoulder, blasting the wall behind him, and he knew he had to go.
‘The. Map,’ Potter said with deliberate slowness, his outstretched hand already curling into a fist.
“Anyway, Harry thinks he forced you to attach yourself to him, so he feels really bad about it. Even though I told him it’s for the best, really, since
!’ And instead of Snape’s wand, the spell rebounded off a Shield and hit Draco. Draco’s wand went flying and he could not muster the strength to care. Yaxley did, however. He cried out, ‘There’s someone here! Who’s here?’
Potter freezes, his eyes on Draco’s face, but he does not say a word. He pulls the robes over his head and clambers out of the cauldron clumsily. He winces a little when his bare feet touch the bristly grass, unease flashing across his face. He looks around, taking in the wizarding graveyard rising around them, the statues occasionally shifting with slow deliberate movements. They are in the heart of the graveyard, at the place of honour where the wizarding world buried Harry Potter.
