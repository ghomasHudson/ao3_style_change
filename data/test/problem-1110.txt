Draco walked a bit closer, just enough that Harry could feel the shocks between them.  He stared at Harry for a bit and then nodded.  “Can we talk after dinner?”
Can we say FINALLY!  I hate writer's block with a passion and this chapter proves it.  It's not my best work, and it's just a filler.  I am outlining the next part of the story and which parts of the pregnancy I want to actually put in.  Please keep being patient with me I will finish this story, I promise!
Both boys were slowly reaching boundaries again, and Draco didn’t really know how to approach it.  The notes from Severus had all been decoded, nothing new for them to look at, and the blonde was wanting to cross certain things with Harry.  He knew, and he knew his boyfriend did as well, that bottoming at first would be his position.  Draco was nervous about it given his punishment for Dumbledore.
“Of course.  If you and Mr. Malfoy wouldn’t mind getting on the pedestals, I’ll just get my tapes and fabric.”
Remus dared to touch his cub and smiled. "No. However, Potter's have a unique thing that helps them find their perfect...mate, I guess, their first year at Hogwarts. James was bisexual, that was one way we were able to pull it off. He really dated Lily, but by that time, we all understood that once a month, Moony needed him too. I was with Sirius except for the two days a month. Moony wouldn't let him touch me. Lily was your godmother, though. We wanted her to be as much a part of your life as Sirius. That was always a given and we wanted her to know she was just as important."
Hermione thought on something and they all turned in surprise at a noise.  They found Sirius and Remus walking up to them and waited.  Hermione explained what they were doing and what Harry just suggested.  The professors looked at the portrait, Sirius letting Remus think on it.  Remus was always the one to figure these things out, much like Hermione for Harry, he was sure.  Remus studied the portrait and then looked at Harry.  There was one way, one way he couldn’t be sure, but it just might work.
Draco did as he was told and took the green eyed boy in his arms.  Harry immediately calmed down and his body quit reacting to whatever was going on.  Poppy looked at James, who was making sure his mates were fine before addressing the issue of his son.  He turned back to the nurse.
“That what we thought, I’ve been digging since Remus is resting for next week.  One of our order members, Gideon Prewett went missing.  He was Molly’s brother, Fabian died, but Gideon was in St. Mungos and then disappeared the same night.  We’re thinking Albus took him.”
Remus looked at Narcissa, taking his eyes off the boys.  They were still huddled, not really noticing anyone else but the other.  The wolf shook his head.
“I is being Slinky, Master Harry, sirs.  I’s new here.  Blimpy brought me as my mistress died, Master Harry.”
She turned and watched them till Paloma brought the first years through.  She couldn’t deny it.  The two groups, so different, were talking and getting along.  Slytherins and Gryffindors talking like they’d been friends this whole time, that a war never happened.  All ten of those returning students looked to be getting along, not just those closest to the couple.  Attention went to Paloma as she sat the stool in place and began to call the first years up.  There wasn’t as many as usual and one that stood out was Annaliese Dumbledore.  She didn’t even know Albus had a daughter, but that wasn’t it.  Something about the girl seemed familiar.  She had dark hair, but so did Albus when he was younger.  Her eyes though, they weren’t Albus' blue, they were a deep brown.  Her face wasn’t Albus’ either.  The only person she knew the old Headmaster was in relations with was in Azkaban, long before a girl could be born.  She also didn’t get how that could happen unless the Dumbledore’s also had a secret.
They were looking into that first as those journals had more information in them.  Grabbing the shampoo, he lathered his hands and scrubbed the cleanser into his scalp, using it to thoroughly wash his dark hair.  After he leaned his head forward and watched the soap go down the drain till the water turned clear.  He washed his body and then turned the water off.  Wrapping a towel around his waist, he opened the door and made his way to his room, having left his jeans in the closet.  Harry shut the door and then dropped the towel, grabbing a pair of jeans and slipping them on.  Pulling on a white tee for the day, Harry made his way to the kitchen for some breakfast before Draco was expected at 10.
Harry nodded.  “He wants to.  Said he wants to be able to go out of the castle.  I don’t blame him, he’s been here since 1981.  Pansy and Theo know, by the way.  I accidentally mentioned something and then told them what it meant.”
The boys then laid down on their stomach to get comfortable so that they could do the parts they assigned to each other.  They spent the rest of the morning looking through notes after notes and referring to the book with the breaks in it, learning a vast amount.  They learned that James had leant some of his DNA to Severus to see if he could use it to make the contraceptive as well as the reversal potion.  Severus had more on the contraceptive potion, though, and it was looking promising.  The potions instructor had gotten everything researched for letting a male use it besides actually testing it.  James was going to, but had died before he could.  Severus, apparently didn’t know anyone else who could bear children so the research and development was halted.
Harry sighed as Draco flipped him over and proceeded to kiss down Harry’s chest, taking his pricking into his mouth.
Take care, Harry.  Lucius, yes Lucius, and I have come to see you as a second son and want the best for you and our Draco.
“You could take him.  He’s rubbish in a fight, love.  It’s the strategy he loves.  He would get you before we ever saw it.”  Draco explained.
The dark haired man turned and opened his green eyes to see the grey a bit softer than normal this morning.
Harry stood there, feeling the air leave him.  She would never be alright with a man, let alone Draco.  Harry could feel his heart constrict as the mere thought of the blonde man not being with him surrounded him.  He could feel the dizziness surround him.  He need to get out, get away.  He could see Molly’s concern, but Harry didn’t care, he apparated.
She shook her head. "Don't. I know what you're going to say. I feel the same Harry. During the last year, well...I was scared you guys weren't coming back. Neville helped with that."
Sirius turned so his full attention was on Harry.  “I get that, Harry.  At some point, you’re going to have to tell him what you feel though.  You won’t move forward, or have a chance, if you don’t.  Don’t wait too long, Harry.”
Hot, that’s all Harry could feel, hot.  He could feel his skin heat up as the Professor was lecturing on the horcruxes.  At least he didn’t need the notes.  Remus had let him know that he wanted to teach on it, show the dangers of it, show how Voldemort used them and they ended up his downfall.  Don’t get him wrong,  Harry thought the lecture was going great.  Harry blinked as the sweat started to build up on his forehead.  He wiped his head and bumped his glasses, which was slowly starting to slip down his nose.  His fingers went to his tie next, loosening it and unbuttoning the top button.  He could feel Draco’s eyes on him and just sighed.  He didn’t know what was going on.
Thank you once again if you left a comment!  I love reading them.  Due to both my jobs and family issues, the next update may be a tad bit longer than normal.  I have started writing again though and have the plot going again!  Please bare with me as my writer's block slowly goes away and I can write how the story needs to flow out of me.  Hope you like this chapter.
Harry just shook his head.  Remus could see the tears in his sons eyes and wished he could hug the boy.
“I get it.  Those that matter, they already know and are fine with it.  They understand it, love.  Those that don’t matter, well...fuck them.  As for rooms...maybe your papa can help.
Both boys looked at her and Draco took a breath.  She wasn’t going to budge, they both knew that.  Her patient needed rest and she didn’t care about the argument.  They could handle one night...hopefully.
Hermione looked at Harry and nodded, letting him know it’d be ok.  Harry ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
Sirius smiled.  “I’m not sure how many.  Charlus stayed here because he didn’t like all the flash the Potter Manor holds.  Godric’s Hollow was one and that’s one of the reason’s we hid you there.  It already had the magic of the family in it’s walls.  Also how it still stands.  We can go to Gringotts to see if you want.”
Draco took his boyfriend’s hand in reassurance and listened to what the older man had to say.  Annaleise was holding onto the words her professor was saying.
Draco and Harry both breathed sighs of relief.  Now that he knew things were in place, plans being made, Harry felt a bit more secure on the outcomes of this surprise heat.  Now he just hoped he and Draco could survive whatever comes at them and still be happy on the other side, only the future weeks would know that for sure.
Remus walked over to Harry and gave him a hug.  “I know, cub.  It’s alright.  I think you’ll have more questions when a relationship happens.  Your dad left me with a journal.  Details of what he went through and what most of the men in your family went through.  His line overruled the wolf so none of your children will have it, this we do know.  I’m not the first wolf to mate with a Potter.”
“You’re right.  That’s on me and Sirius, cub.  We knew you didn’t do anything with Ginny or Draco so we didn’t think it was an issue.  Given the fact that you never turned into a wolf upon puberty or before, we didn’t think you’d get one.  In all of our research, if a Potter was a mate for a wolf, Potter’s were the dominant trait.  We didn’t think you’d have one.  All research and belief were in the negative on it.”  Remus explained.
“What reasons?”  she asked.  “Surely not just because of you monthly problem, some women are worse.”
Harry finished and waited for Remus to comment.  The older of the two thought on what Harry explained.  It made sense.  Draco would probably be the only one to be able to read Severus’ notes.  He looked at his son, who was hoping he did the right thing, and smiled.
Harry sighed and felt Draco’s hand slide into his, silently telling him he had support.  Harry had told him about Molly and her advances.  It wasn’t going well, but he did miss his friends.
Harry moved his hand and wrapped his fingers between Draco’s.  “He’ll get there.  I overheard them the other day after you left.  He’s worried about how you grew up.  I’m not though.  I know we’ll fight and argue, but that’ll make the sex better anyway.”
Draco nodded.  “He’s staying overnight to make sure he gets the rest he needs.  One of the girls in our year did a spell and he flew against the wall.  The baby and he are fine.”
Draco and Harry waiting as the other two processed the biggest secret known to wizard kind.  It was a big step, telling them everything.  One was hoping his trust wasn’t misplaced, the other knew it wasn’t.  Pansy and Theo would kill for Draco, and Harry was now included in that.  They would also die for them.
Draco had quieted down, hoping his boyfriend would get the meaning.  Harry’s eyes widened at what he implied, and then he got angry...very angry.
“No, I’m going to help you.  Your house elf let us know where you were after Moony and Padfoot asked him.  They are coming for you.  Please hold on.”
“Finally, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, your tongue will not be able to confess and your magic will turn on you should you attempt to gossip, talk, or bring harm to Remus Lupin’s son, Harry Potter.  Do you swear it.”
“We don’t go to bed angry.  You and I are very stubborn men.  We both know this, but I think we need communication, and a lot, for this to work.”
“Remus, you go change.  I’ve been up for a while.  I’ll help Harry.”  Sirius stated, looking at his mate.
Hope everyone had a great holiday!  Mine were great but crazy busy.  Anyways, this has a lot of dialogue, but hope it set up for the next part of the story.  Hope you like it.
Theo nodded.  “Alright.  Pansy and I will help wherever you need us to.  About the Polyjuice, if McGonagall is alright with it, I’ll do it for you guys.”
Harry just nodded and let his friends lead him out.  No one talked as they went back into their room.  Harry shut the door and saw his friend’s still having looks of worry.  He explained the dream once again and then what he discussed with his father.
"Harry. Severus figured it out that year. My first moon, I made him bring you as close as he could to my room. I could smell that you already made the human change, but since no one knew you were mine, the wolf thing could have happened. I had to tell him. He promised not to tell Albus because of what it could mean to you. Hell, Potter's getting raped to have powerful children wasn't just that one time. We were both so scared Albus would find out. He was just as power greedy as Voldemort and I didn't trust him, none of us did. He just had the fact Voldemort was scared of him at his side." Remus explained.
Draco hummed a bit to do something different and Harry’s whole body almost came off the ground as a finger inserted into him.  Draco thrusted his finger a bit while sucking on Harry’s prick before adding another finger and searching for the button to make Harry scream.
Harry stopped Ginny from getting up by holding his hand out.  He then looked at the woman he held as a second mother and everyone could feel the tension.  Harry’s guardians knew this could be bad, but it was Harry’s fight and they had already warned the red head about it.  Harry stood up and looked the woman in the eye.
Everyone gasped as the words left her mouth.  Remus made a move, but Harry stopped him.  He walked in front of his father and closer to the woman.  Draco was watching him, but knew how important it was for Harry to fight this on his own; even if he wanted to tell that bint where to stuff her big nose.  Harry stood a foot from Molly Weasley and just stared for a moment.  He could see she wasn’t going to let up. Wasn’t going to let go of this, maybe ever, and that hurt him.
How to tell the girl that while Albus Dumbledore had good intentions, he always was out for himself and for the “greater good” everyone else be damned.  Remus looked at the girl and moved to hopefully offer comfort.
Draco pulled the savior to him, touching their lips together one more time before they separated to look through the journal in front of them.  They sat the new book between them where they both could see it and Draco explained how to use it.
The woman turned to Remus and smiled.  “I would like to apologize for the last time we spoke, Remus.  You must understand that Harry is like a son to us.”
They all turned to see the Potter-Lupin-Black trio standing against Molly.  Harry watched his father push his glasses up his nose and then take a deep breath.
She figured me out second year as well, she just didn't know till seventh that the boys went with me every month. We sent her an owl asking her to meet us on the train and then dove into every book we had. That's how I knew I put the mating mark on both of them. What I, we, didn't understand was why I did it to both of them. You see, Sirius had told us that same night that he thought he liked boys and not girls. Something in me snapped, that's the best way to describe it and the bites just happened."
They all turned to see the Weasley mother make her way through the crowd, a smile on her face.  Harry stayed close to Draco as Molly and the rest got to them, just nodding.
“Why, I don’t belong to you.  I have never kissed you.  That would give me a disease I don’t want or need.  Besides, my boyfriend wouldn’t like it.”  Draco commented, stating he was taken on purpose.
“No.  Draco please.  I was just worried I had changed more than I thought.  Prongs helped though.  He said the things I do with you, the things everyone gets to see, he did with papa and Lily.”  Harry whispered back.
When they walked in, everyone got quiet, making Harry hide a bit.  The four walked slowly into the room, knowing all eyes were watching Harry.  Hermione, smiled at Harry and Ron and then set in the floor, Ron taking the chair she was in front of.  Harry watched the two, knowing they knew what was being said and was grateful.  Draco took a seat on the couch next to the chair Ron sat in, letting Harry set next to Hermione.
Seeing Draco’s brow furrow, Harry went into the morning conversation with his papa and Sirius.  He explained how James got pregnant twice but they didn’t know.  Due to that information, Harry and his parentals thought he could carry more than once.  He also explained about the natural contraceptive theory.
Draco opened his eyes when he heard a moan from the other man and blushed a bit and the hunger in Harry’s eyes.  He was looking at Draco like he needed him to live, needed him like water in a desert.
“You have made that boy believe in things he shouldn’t believe in, James.  The three of you should be ashamed of yourselves.  I remember the first war.  I remember you and Lily going out together, her carrying Harry.  For you to stand there and say you carried her is barmy.  I know what I saw.”  the woman accused.
Draco nodded.  He used his hand that was coated in Harry and slicked his prick.  With a small smile from Harry for encouragement, Draco slowly pushed his way through the hole.  Tightness, tightness that was beyond anything Draco ever imagined.  He had to hold on, had to get Harry through the heat.  Damn if the heat wasn’t going to swallow him up and make this faster than either one wanted it.  Once he got all the way in, he stilled, for the both of them to adjust.
“First, do you and Sirius support this?  Truth would be appreciated.  If I go there, I’m going to need your help.  I thought you were both fine when you explained things to me, hell...even after.  But Sirius, you’re acting like you don’t want me to be with Draco.  This is going to get out, I don’t want a rift between us three when it does.”  Harry explained.
Everyone laughed and then talked about things going on beyond Harry, bearers, and Albus Dumbledore kidnapping James Potter.
“There’s plenty if you two are hungry, Hermione.”  Remus stated, pulling Sirius from his seat so they could get ready for a meeting in Hogsmeade with Minerva.  The younger four watched them leave and then went back to what they were doing.  Ron sat where Remus vacated and piled more food onto his plate.  Hermione grabbed some tea and sat next to Draco.
This didn't get beta'd as I have to do some studying, but I didn't want to wait to post it.  Sorry in advance for the mistakes if you find any.
“Harry.  I don’t want to be there.  I’m not anymore ready than you are.  When Severus got me out of the school, V-Voldemort was waiting for us.  I made Severus take me back.  I knew he was a spy and I couldn’t let him get punished for hiding me.  They body bound my parents and chained me to a bed they had conjured in that room.”
Harry chuckled.  “Yes,  I agree.  They still have a few days left.  At least you know Sirius doesn’t hate you.”
Remus reached his hand out and patted his son’s knee.  “He won’t.  In fact, if he is as much Slytherin as I expect, he’s going to ask his father and be very upset.  But, if what I’ve gathered in my time seeing you both, he’s going to use it to also get out of the contract.”
“I’m sure if Lucius wasn’t an ass and Voldemort wasn’t a thing; that would have happened sooner.”  Pansy stated.
Draco started wiping his thumbs on his love’s face and smiled.  “You killed one yourself.  Molly Weasley killed one, and the last was killed by my father at Hogwarts.”
"Please just be quiet till I get this out. I thought James would be here to help with it and he's not. I don't really know how to start. Padfoot suggested our third year." Remus spoke softly.
Harry was also the reason.  His abuse was quite different than Draco’s and longer.  Draco, of course, had all the information after Harry’s magic lashed out at him during a snog session that went too far.  Harry was saddened that they couldn’t be as physical as he wanted, and he really wanted to be.  Their connection though, had a way of letting the other know when not to push.  The darker man smiled as his pale counterpart opened his eyes.  The blond smiled and leaned closer to kiss his boyfriend.  Harry welcomed the kiss and pushed to deepen it, Draco letting him.  Draco pushed back and Harry laid on his back as they moved.  Draco hovered a tad over the man under him as hands begin to wonder.
Harry, feeling the need his companions were feeling, grabbed his plate and left the room.  He picked up the journal on the way to his room and sat on his bed.  Opening the book, the savior continued reading while finishing his plate of food.  The journal in question was from Ignotus, and he was the first to find out about the “abnormality” as he called it.  Harry figured out through reading some of the others during the last week that this was a birth defect magic brought on so that the lines could continue.  He also figured Peverell thought of it as abnormal because Sodomy was illegal at the time.  He was also the first homosexual that didn’t lean at all to women, from what was gathered from the journal anyway.
Draco watched as Harry’s smile widened and leaned to meet him halfway in a kiss.  It was a short kiss as they were both exhausted, the slightly younger one a tad sore from the many rounds they had over the last few days.
“Well, we’ll have to watch out for that.  Does it bother you?”  Harry whispered as he looked at the man beside him.
He looked up and saw his blonde boyfriend leaning against the frame, his legs crossed as well as his arms, smiling at Harry in the mirror.  He watched as Draco walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist, his hands over his on his abs.
“Please let them know we’re here, I know it’s early.”  Harry stated to the little girl in the painting, usually they just went in but if it was really early, they didn’t want to scare James.  A few moments of waiting had the frame opening and Sirius letting them in.
He; however, was hoping Harry would tell him on his own.  Having reached the bath, Draco quickly turned on the water, letting it heat up he used the toilet and brushed his teeth.  A sigh left his lips as the water started to wake him the second he entered the tub.  The blonde twisted his body a bit, letting the muscles stretch as he started to lather his skin.  Taking the shampoo he was sharing with the others in the house, Draco quickly washed his hair and then turned the water off.  Grabbing the towel off the hook, he wrapped it around his waist, stepping out of the tub.  He smiled into the mirror as he dried off and slipped his black slacks up.  For him, they were more comfortable when studying potions.  He never figured out why, but the jeans tended to bunch and make his legs cramp up after a bit.  He walked out, having forgotten his shirt and made his way back to the room he shared with Harry.
This is going to start getting into the part of the plot where they gene starts affecting both Harry and Draco.  Hope you like it.
Hermione sighed.  “Good.  I’m glad you trusted Draco’s friends.  Really, guys...It’s just you three seemed like us.  I know you’d never betray Draco and he’s with Harry, so…”
Harry got up from the couch, but before he could walk out, Lavender took his hand.  Harry turned to look at their hands and then into the face the other hand belonged to.  The hand didn’t feel right in his.  He tried to take his hand away, but she was stronger than she looked, probably from the wolf was his guess.
Remus studies Harry and sees stress on his son, something he was hoping Harry wouldn’t have.  Before he can answer, though, Sirius does.
Draco nodded as they stopped to look in a window.  “I agree.  I just wish they’d leave both of us alone.  We have a follower by the way.”
Harry laughed as Remus hit his godfather behind the head.  Sirius huffed and then they went to the floo, using it to get to the Malfoys.
“This is the only entrance to your common room.  There are desks and furniture for you to use as your discretion.  The password is unity and will not change so be careful who you share it with.”
As the sun made its way into the room, the boys tried to stay asleep just a tad bit longer.  Harry, always the first to wake, turned to look at the boy behind him.
Both men turned to see Sirius leaning against the archway.  The shaggy man walked the rest of the way in and sat next to Harry.
Most Potter’s who kept a journal for the future had wives, even Charlus.  His wife had passed while on vacation and that’s how he met John.  John was the Healer in charge of his wife, who had a potions accident and ended up in the hospital.  From what Harry had gathered, they had gotten drunk and it was the first time Charlus had ever considered a man.  He also read that the Peverell’s, Potter’s, and the other lines with bearers told their heirs, but also told them of the risks of exposure.  It was also the Malfoy’s who started the potions, invented the very one still used by pureblood families today.  The potion practically forced the heir to have a wife because of duty to continue the line.  Harry closed the book as he finished it.
“My daddy wouldn’t do anything bad though.  He was a good daddy.”  Annaleise stated for the first time since explaining the dreams.
Harry smiled and pushed Draco’s shorts down, letting the blond kick them the rest of the way off.  Draco’s head hit the pillow besides Harry’s head and the hand wrapped around him.  This is what he craved, this intimacy with Harry.  It was small yes, but he knew if they both waited, the sex would be worth it.
Harry opened the door to see his friends huddled around what looked to be a map, of what he wasn’t sure.  They both looked up and smiled.
Everyone nodded and followed the red heads out of the station.  The ministry had given cars to them again, causing everyone to split up.
Harry stayed standing tall and put his shirt down.  He kept a hold of Draco’s hand and looked at the person he used to see as someone who would love him no matter what.
"Second year was when they found out about me, my lycanthrophy. Third year was when my wolf hit puberty, I guess that's the easiest way to say it. I hit that twice, which sucks both times by the way. Anyways, I saw James and Sirius about three days before the train back to school. One night we were in James' room at this cottage, the one you picked actually. Well I bit both of them. Now, before you ask, it wasn't a full moon and we didn't understand it. Lily was already real close to us, even if we tell it differently.
Draco watched the wolf leave and wondered, not for the first time, how they would really feel about him being with their cub.  He hadn’t voiced the concerns with Harry, though.  He didn’t want Harry to think he didn’t want to face anything with him.  It was the complete opposite really.  While being able to be with the man he had wrapped in his arms and still uphold duty, that’s not what this was for the slytherin.  Harry was always something Draco had, he was a constant.  Someone who didn’t treat him different because of his father, didn’t care much for that really.  In fact, the most intriguing was that Harry didn’t give a rat’s ass about Lucius Malfoy.
“I heard a rumor that the old cottage had people in it last night.  What can I do for you Mr. Potter?”
“James and I knew how hard it was for you to see us growing, as a family.   We knew that you loved both of us, just differently.  But we also knew how much you wished to be the one I was having Harry with.  Especially when we all found out about the potions and what Walburga did to you.  We talked it over with Severus and Lily and they agreed to try to figure out a way to reverse the potion so that James wouldn’t have to carry anymore, that you could give me a child so that Moony wouldn’t need the other mate.  James and I hated what it was doing to you and Lily.  Having to be together once a month because my Lycanthropy demanded it.  We both loved you and her too much to continue doing it.”
They waited for the two on the couch to process the explanation, Sirius asking an elf to bring some breakfast to their room.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Thanks, Gin.  How’ve you been?  Haven’t gotten to talk to you for a while.”
She turned to see Sirius and Remus looking at the boys, but it was the former that whispered to her.  She turned back and watched as the Draco let Harry sit first and then sat next to him.  He leaned in to whisper something and Harry nodded, a small smile.  That boy looked like the world lifted off his shoulders.  The witch looked back at the two beside her, eyes wider than before.
Harry slipped on some trainers and then went to find his father, fathers, Moony and Padfoot.  He found them in the living room, both changed and talking quietly about something.
Draco let a small smile split his face and nodded.  “Yes, but I think your godfather isn’t as happy as the wolf.  He seems like it’s bothering him.”
“It wasn’t that bad.  We’re not sure how James and Lily handled theirs, but it was purely physical with us.  I think with you, how you were raised, you’re going to be different.  It’s for you and Draco to decide.  After time, you will figure out how to handle this Harry.”
She moved and looked at the two looking at her and smiling.  She has seen this portrait in a book and couldn’t believe it was that easy.  She looked at the boys with her to see they were just as confused.  She held up a finger for them to wait and started to go over what all she found out, whether through books or someone telling it to her.  She walked around and mumbled to herself, about what the others couldn’t figure out.  Harry looked back at the portrait, trying to figure out what she saw in it.  Something about these men seemed familiar to her and Harry couldn’t make it out.
Harry nodded and picked it up, grabbing a cuppa as well.  The young man sat next to his father and started to tuck in when Draco walked in for his own plate and some tea.  The Malfoys had come over yesterday to say their goodbyes as neither of Draco’s parents wanted to make today harder on the boys then it already would be.  No one really talked as the boys ate the breakfast Remus had made them.  When everyone was finished, the marauders helped the boys with their trunks and then they apparated to the station, not having to use the platform entrance this way.  The boys hugged both men and then went to find the compartment they wanted to wait on their friends.  Harry sighed as he sat down, not looking forward to the ride to the school, and slightly wishing his wolf and dog were joining like Remus did third year.
This one wasn’t about Harry being gay, but about him.  How dirty the Malfoy’s played to get what they wanted.  How Draco was using him, manipulating him into getting some status back with being accepted by the chosen one.  He couldn’t stand to read all of it and set it aflame.  Ron just shrugged, knowing his mother was about to lose Harry for good and no one was going to stop it.  He knew Lily would support him, given how the four of Harry’s parents were before that Halloween night.  They also knew that’s all Harry cared about at the moment.
It had been a week since the conversation between the Malfoys and the Lupin-Black-Potter family.  One week that felt like a lifetime.  Severus’ notes were taking a lot out of Draco, and Harry as well.  They couldn’t figure out what he had written.  Draco had expressed apologies more than once and Harry always waved it off like nothing.  He knew it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park, so to speak, and told Draco as much.  This morning, Harry woke to someone arguing with Remus in the kitchen.  Harry couldn’t make out who it was, or what was said.  He just knew it wasn’t Sirius, as the other voice was female.  He got up and pulled his pajamas up before heading out to see what was going on in the living room.
“This is true.  I just hope he doesn’t get hurt.  People are going to find out he’s more different eventually.”  Pansy commented.
They talked some more and smiled as they saw Remus and Sirius coming up the path from the village.  The two older men sat with them and they all started trading stories about Hogwarts, some good and some bad.  The younger two also asked more about after Hogwarts, and the older two gave plenty of stories about them with James and Lily in the three years before Harry up to that Halloween night.
Sorry it's been a while, but I'm teaching and was studying to take a different certification test for teaching as well.  I'm back now, so hopefully can post more often!
No one saw it come, but should’ve as Blaise was on the wall, held by magic.  There was a shield between Harry and everyone as he approached the man.  No one knows what was said, but Blaise’s eyes showed anger as Harry held him there.  Everyone watched as Harry kept the man on the wall and continued to whisper to him when they heard a crack.  Blaise had disappeared and Harry was smiling.
She turned to him and smiled.  “But Harry, now you need to find a nice woman, like Ginny.  Settle down, make a family.”
“It’s alright.  We’re at an impasse with the notes anyway.  How about we spend time with our families and meet in two days to relook.  Maybe it’ll clear our heads.”  Harry commented looking up at the man holding him.
Remus paused again and Harry was getting more confused. He sit back up and looked at the men in front of him.
Sirius made to get up and Harry grabbed his arm. Sirius looked at him as he got up and Harry let him go. "I'll ask Remus, dad, father?"
Remus looked back to his son and smiled.  “Let’s eat.  Then we can try to find a solution to this dream, son.”
Everyone looked at the youngest Malfoy and then back to the oldest, each holding their breath.  Lucius and Draco stared at each other, and Harry knew the look in Draco.  Draco wasn’t going to back down, not till his question was answered.  He also saw when Lucius noticed the same thing and sighed.
“It is important for Draco to be right next to Harry the next few months.  I lost a baby when Remus was gone and I will not let Harry and Draco suffer the same.  That baby needs both their magic, Poppy.  Draco has to be with Harry at all times to help Harry stay healthy.  It’s part of the defect and one reason the potion for the heir was made to begin with.  The Malfoy who created it hated his son for having a baby with a Potter, as ironic as this is.  You cannot separate them.”
Draco smiled and shook his head.  “I know as much as you as I didn’t want information to get my father.  Ok, a tad more than you, but not by choice.  I also don’t wish to discuss it yet, if you’re alright with that.  But I’d be willing to experiment with you when you’re ready.”
He watched as Draco’s eyes teared up a bit and he leaned forward.  Draco touched Harry’s cheek and smiled.  “I know.  I can’t just be friends either, Harry.  What will everyone say, though?”
Ron sighed.  “I know.  I’m supposed to talk him into it.  He’ll want to see everyone and so will probably go.  We will need to be careful though.  Mum doesn’t think he’s a bearer and will stress him.  James will need to be there so he can read the signs.  He knows what to look for better than we do.  Sirius won’t go, he’ll hex mum, and Remus will go because Harry wants to.”
The two men waited for the door to open and saw Kipper at the door.  The elf moved to let them in, letting them know his mistress was in the blue parlor.  Sirius led his husband since he knew the way, quietly hoping Remus would be able to calm down more than he was at this moment.  The wolf was always the softer of the marauders and to see him wound up like this weighed heavily on the dog.  Narcissa stood when she noticed who had knocked on the door, Lucius nodding as he stood with her.
The older two looked at Harry, Sirius, of course, not knowing why they had come early.  Harry kept his eyes on the matriarch of the family, hoping to avoid Draco a bit longer.
“Um...Your dad said three or four days for the heat, which started Thursday.  So...Saturday, Sunday maybe.  Why?”  Draco asked, entering the room and taking his choice of clothing out of his wardrobe.
The ginger haired man was staying with Hermione on pretense of his mother being a bitch.  They all knew he’d never tell his mother she was a bitch, but the woman knew where her son stood in regards to Harry and Draco.
Harry flinched, backing up a bit.  He felt a hand in his and looked to see Draco standing next him.  Harry nodded, backing up more to let Draco handle it since he was losing it again.  He really hated this part of the gene.
Harry followed the voice and found Remus standing to greet him.  He smiled and sent his things to his room, letting Blimpy, one of the elves put the things away.
They had wondered before, having long sense been comfortable with skin not covered by the boxers they wore to bed.  A sigh left Harry as Draco’s lips followed his fingers down his jaw and starting down his torso.  The feelings erupting within the Gryffindor had him wanting to try again.  He moved his hands and pushed a bit, Draco getting the hint and moving his body fully on top of him.  Harry’s legs spread just enough for Draco to settle comfortably over him and a moan came out as their lips danced once again.  Tongues started to dance as Draco’s hips pushed a tad downwards.  Harry’s moan gained altitude and he pushed his hips to meet his boyfriends.  They started a dance and Harry threw his head back as Draco’s hand palmed him through his shorts.
“I’m alright.  She ended up speeding up things with the bearer thing, but we’re working through it.”  Harry stated, pulling Draco next to him on the couch.
All the men around her nodded and took a seat.  She always knew how to read people; the three new men in her sitting room weren’t any different.  She looked at her husband, the age starting to make his leg worse than it was.  She looked at her son, trying her best not to let on what she knew, what a mother always knows.  She glances to her cousin, who’s looking at her, and smiles a bit.  They both knew.  Knew the young men in the room had a deeper connection that both hadn’t yet realized.  All the fights, the competition, it was foreplay.  Foreplay during a war neither had no control over because the adults gave the control to two greedy, powerful men who used that for their own gain.
“Ok, so what are the odds of us now having a baby?  How do we hide that inside this school?  From the papers?  From Molly?”  Draco asked while Harry was eating.
It was over, the one thing he knew was definite in his life. It was over, no more fighting. No more tears, no death. Who was Harry Potter now? Could he get to be normal? Could he dare to do things he always wanted without worry? He stood in the hall as he watched everyone hug their loved ones, mourning the losses they all had. Yes, they all had one. He watched as Remus was hugged by Sirius, who had faked his death with the help of Lucius Malfoy, of all people. Lucius, who had always known about Severus being a spy, had taken precautions to help Harry, when talk of Draco being made into a death eater by force started. As soon as that was known, the Malfoys apparently went to Dumbledore. That old fraud barely helped them. That kind of upset Harry and he didn't know why.
James had gotten lucky in them having Harry, or Potter could have as well.  Although, the prophecy wouldn’t have included Harry so who’s to say really on that.  Harry didn’t move his eyes from the arch that the two Malfoy’s went through, nor did he notice the stare of the other three in the room with him.  He was too concerned with Draco.  Would it be to much for him to follow, to make sure the blonde was alright?  Just as he was going to move, he felt a hand on his knee.  He jumped and looked down, then followed the hand to the arm to the face of the man beside him, Remus.  Remus had understanding in his eyes, but also caution.  Harry kept his eyes on his father, who was also silently asking if he was alright.  Harry nodded and his grip on the books loosened slightly.
Everyone turned to look at Harry.  They took a minute to study their friend/son before nodding and getting comfortable.
Before he could get further away, she grabbed him harder and said a spell he didn’t recognize, causing them both to fly to opposite ends of the room.
“That’s why your dad let you out of the contract?  Lucius knows, right?”  Theo asked.  He was Draco’s best friend, always had been.  He also knew that once upon a time Draco was scared to tell Lucius about being bent.
“He’s just shocked.  When that man invaded our home, things happened.  Things that Draco is still coming to terms with and Lucius and I couldn’t help him through it.  You asking what you have, and telling what you have, isn’t the issue.  The issue is that his choice was taken.  My son understands why things are done the way they are, why potions are admitted.  My husband has learned that Draco needs to have a say in certain things.  He had come a long way since the Dark Lord came and went again, but he still has a lot to learn about Draco as an adult.  Things he never considered are happening before.  He doesn’t know how to handle it.”
Remus nodded and felt Sirius squeeze his hand. "Lily came. She helped us read through some of the harder books. Hermione reminds me of her, actually. Anyway, Wolves tended to mate with one who could help them procreate. It's part of being in a pack, wanting family. What we didn't understand is why my wolf chose two men. Men can't have children, or so we thought."
The more he spoke, the quieter he gotten.  Ron had to lean in to hear him by the end.  They could see his face.  He didn’t quite hear what their friend had said.  Harry had to state the last part again and then they waited.  Waited for who knows how long before Ron nodded and leaned back, the quill he was still holding to fell on the map beside them.  They didn’t say anything for a few minutes and just let Ron process what that could mean for them, for Harry.  They watched as his eyes closed and then open again, revealing nothing.
"I did, but I had someone with me. Not being with him for a year, but knowing he was alive was hard."
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes got big and he tucked the books close to him, protecting them.  The blonde could see that whatever was going on, Harry didn’t want Lucius to know.  He also looked at his father to see the man calculating on how to get what he wanted and decided to intervene.
Harry smiled.  “I love you too.  I give you consent to do what we both have to, what I will beg for.  I want you know that.  I want that in your memory so that you can show me in case I don’t remember it.  Can I have a bath?  I feel really hot.”
“It’s a bearer thing, but one that shouldn’t be happening to you.  Your dad had a connection with Charlus.  It was how we knew when Charlus and John were attacked, we just didn’t get there in time.  Messed James up for weeks, it did.  With James not being here, you shouldn’t be having these visions if you will.  I will ask Sirius if his uncle’s journal has anything either.  We also have the Potter ones, if you want those.”
The blonde watched as green eyes widened and took in what was said to him.  A smile graced both faces and hands moved to Harry’s stomach.
“Mister Remus.  My Mistress and Masters are hoping to bring young Master Draco.  Something is wrong and they don’t know what to do.”
Draco leaned back a bit and sighed. “Makes sense.  All I would have to do is make sure I didn’t...y’know inside you?”
The wolf hated to see his son so shattered.  They still didn’t know why Harry all of a sudden called him papa, not that he wasn’t happy.  Harry just said it felt right and Remus was more than happy with that.  Remus gently leaned in and kiss his son over his scar, now a bit faded, and sighed.
“Okay, little one.  I know.”  He whispered as the baby reminded him why he woke up, his bladder was full.
Harry looked at Sirius. He explained how he came to terms with it, how Hermione helped him. Both men listened as Harry told his tale on that part of his hunt and they smiled.
James tried to get closer to his son, but stopped when Remus grabbed his wrist and Harry cuddled more into Draco.
Draco nodded.  “Yes, also took an oath on his magic with Remus to not hurt or abuse Harry.  Sirius recited it so it would be bad if he broke it.”
Everyone else in the room held their breath while they waited on the answer.  Harry could see the concern in his father and nodded.
Nothing was said as the door opened and the man in question walked in.  Draco smiled as his lover walked in and sat on the bed next to him.
Harry sat up, smiling.  “Thank Merlin, I really didn’t want anyone to know about those.  I wonder if Hermione and Ron got Head positions or if we’re not allowed since we’re repeating the year.”
They all watched as the girl stupidly walked further into the room, heading to the boys no one wanted on their bad side.  Draco let go of Harry and when he made to get up, Harry stopped him.  Everyone watched as the Slytherin and the Gryffindor debated silently.  They watched a smile, something they never seen before, grace the blonde’s face as he sat down.  Harry turned to the witch.
Harry watched as the flames engulfed the man he was quickly giving his heart to and sighed.  Two days would be a long time for him.  He missed his friends, and thought of them daily, but there was something about Draco.  Draco relaxed him, made him feel protected and safe.  Harry could relax and give up certain parts of himself when Draco was here; he liked that.  He didn’t understand it, not really as he never had any say in his life and thought he’d really want control.  Giving some of it to Draco was a feeling he couldn’t imagine.  He also knew Draco wouldn’t take advantage of it.  Shaking his head of those thoughts, Harry went to take a quick shower and change into some clean clothing.
“Please, continue to stay if you wish to do so.  For both lunch and tea as we have enough.  For now, I must tend to the garden and leave my husband to wallow in his own self pity.”
Draco gently laid his boyfriend on the bed and Harry started to take his robes off.  He was still hot.  Draco sat beside him, letting the older Potter sat in the chair at the desk.  They didn’t have to wait long for Remus to come through.
“I will marry when I want, to whomever I want.  It will also not be Ginny.  In fact, it won’t be a woman at all.”
They watched Hermione’s eyes light up.  “That’s a brilliant idea, Sirius.  Remus, could you imagine.  We should do it.  We could use our knowledge and skills on creatures and open to their needs as well.  St.  Mungos does tend to throw out those they don’t think are worthy of their care.  We could…”
Harry shook his head.  He didn’t say anything, just pushed Draco’s hand down to feel his hole.  He watched as Draco’s eyes widen at the feel of something a tad bit thicker than water.
Harry nodded.  That was good.  He knew Draco would need to continue his title, but Harry wanted to continue Potter as well.
He thanked the woman and after picking up some boxers and socks, paid for everything.  She also let him know where he could get a decent pair of trainers and boots so he made that his next stop.  He didn’t talk to this person, the man gave off uncomfortable vibes.  He did however find a pair of dragon hide boots and some muggle converse.  He paid for those and then made his way back to the cottage.
He let everyone process the bit of information He gave them, the three closest to him knowing he pretty much lied to all of them.  Not about everything, but he wasn’t almost put into Slytherin for any reason.  Harry had talked this part of his story over with James and Sirius earlier and knew they’d relay it to his papa.  He wanted to give something, but keep most of it.  This was a way he could explain his relationship with Draco and keep the biggest secret.  The rest of the room was silent.  The Gryffindors were trying to figure out if Harry was lying while the Slytherins were trying to find the meaning between the words.  The rest were just taking it at face value.  When Lavender didn’t say anything else,  Harry turned and held his hand out for his mate.  Draco smiled and took his hand, letting Harry lead him out of the common room and into their room for the rest of the night.
“He’s very malnourished and has been raped repeatedly.  He may need a mind healer to get past the emotional abuse, but physically he’s healed nicely.  Albus I guess wanted him to stay as healthy as possible.”
Harry sat next to his friend and turned so he was laying down with them, looking over what they had figured out so far.  Hermione let him know he was welcome to come with them, but Harry kindly declined the offer.  Spending time away, while appealing, didn’t suit him at the moment.  When Ron asked why, Harry sat up and leaned against the bed.  He told the two about their dinner with the Malfoys and then Hermione let out a smile and looked at her friend.
Draco smirked, they all saw it.  “Theo is straight, Zambini.  I cannot change that fact.  There is no need for you to know who I’m with.  What I want to know is why you’re here, at the school.”
“That’s actually, not a bad idea, cub.  The students wouldn’t question it because you taught some of them in your fifth year as well.”  Remus commented.
“Padfoot.”  Harry stated as he waved his wand to stop everything, the smoke clearing out.  After the smoke cleared, Harry laughed.  Sirius was covered in soot and coughing.
As the train came to a stop at the station in Hogsmeade, Draco nudged the boy who laid down, his dark haired head in his lap, and smiled.  Harry waking up was on of Draco’s favorite things to watch.  He didn’t think he’d ever get tired of it, and hoped he never would need to.  Learning everything about the man now moving to sit up and get his robe on just made the eighteen year old slytherin love him more.  He still couldn’t believe he had the love of his once rival, but he wasn’t about to take Harry for granted.  Harry smiled as Draco also moved to get his robes on.  Everyone watched the couple and then glanced to Ron and Hermione.  Two thirds of the trio just smiled back and led the way out.
Sirius sighed.  “That’s all any of us can do, really.  I swear, Moony, one wrong comment and I may hex the bitch.”
Everyone turned to look at the man still laying as close as he could to the men that loved him greatly.  The older women not knowing what he meant looked at his companions, Draco held Harry close glad the old man was already gone, and the two on the floor just watched.  Sirius started playing with the hair of the man in his lap and looked down.
He could hear that over and over, but Draco never came.  Never held him.  Never even stood where he could see him.  Harry was getting really worried and then a scream…
“That’s what I said then they explained it while you were in your room.  I didn’t know everything yet as we needed me to heal.  Once they told me, I was very upset you didn’t know about heats.  With the bearer gene, you should’ve been prepared.”  James stated, agreeing with his son.
He knew, as he traced the faint scaring where the lines came from.  He also couldn’t help the guilt as he felt lips on his head and whispers of “It’s alright.” falling from the man holding him.  Harry turned his head and started kissing the lines, showing the other just how sorry he was, but found them endearing, not repulsive.  Draco sighed as Harry showed affection to the scars he helped created.  Harry started moving towards Draco, going up till he could kiss the man under him.  Draco smiled into the kiss, happy to let Harry have a small bit of control as they welcomed the small time together.  Harry cupped his boyfriend’s face as Draco wrapped his arms around them, rolling till he was under the blonde, a small sigh leaving his lips.  Draco trailed his lips across Harry’s jaw to his lobe, nibbling just enough to get a reaction out of the man under him.
“So you and Ginny looked to be doing better.  But Harry, I’m over that.  I’m sorry it took a few weeks.  I did invite Luna, she’s a sweet girl and I do remember you mentioning blondes.”
Draco pulled back so Harry could tie the tie, reaching for his own set of robes.  Harry hadn’t asked that question before, but Draco had thought it.  Should Remus and Sirius know about the dream?  Was it something they could help with or just some fear Harry had about babies.  They were both scared of babies right now, which is why they hadn’t gotten to penetration of any kind yet.  Not that they weren’t close.  They were getting there.  It was just listening to his boyfriend talk of a son they had lost and a daughter that was taken from him, it was a lot to take in.  What Draco wanted to know more though, was why Harry was having the dream in the first place.  He noticed Harry watching him and remembered the question.
Remus could see the worry on the woman and nodded for her to sit.  Both couples sat and Lucius ordered Kipper to get tea.  The Malfoy’s waited patiently for their guests to answer the Mistress of the house and Sirius brought Remus’ knuckle to his lip, kissing them to calm him.  Remus closed his eyes and then opened them.
Mum wanted me to let you guys know she wants to see you tomorrow.  She has more or less demanded it.  Like the owl, Hermione bought him for my parents.  It was the only one she had coins for at the moment since we’ve been on the run, but he’s known to be loyal.  Anyways, hope today was good for you guys and see you tomorrow.
“Damn.  So the only way to see if it works is for me to use it and hope for the best?”  Harry asked when they sit up to take a break.
Harry nodded and then started to make his way to his own family. He wanted to give the Weasley's time to celebrate the fact Fred didn't die, not that it wasn't close. Pomfrey almost couldn't save him. He nods to the red heads, Hermione standing with them as he passes. When he gets to the two men that weren't blood, but may as well be, they both pulled him into their embrace. All three men started crying for the joy of having the others with them. Harry didn't know about Sirius until the battle when the three of them showed up and told Neville to alert the order. He squeezed Sirius and Sirius wrapped both arms around their cub, just happy to be there. Harry could feel himself break, finally able to breathe and let go of the pain, the stress of the last year.
“School.  We’re in different parts of the school.  How will that work?  Our studies, everyone looking at me because no matter what we say, I am different.  Not much, but enough it’ll get noticed.”
Harry moved his arms to where they curled under Draco’s arms, his fingers curling and cutting into the blades of the man’s shoulders above him.  Draco smiled as he nipped Harry’s neck before moving his lips back to Harry’s.  Harry sucked Draco’s tongue back into his mouth, causing the other man to buck harder into him and Harry threw his head back.  His eyes rolled into the back of his head as he let himself go, the feeling of Draco rolling harder causing him to orgasm.  Draco watched as the man he was falling for let go, causing him to follow him to oblivion.  Harry wrapped Draco to him, holding him as they both came down from their high.  He loved these moments with Draco, where it was just them.
Harry watched as the dog than got up and put his dish in the sink.  He watched as he pulled Remus to him as the wolf entered the kitchen and gave him a kiss before walking by.  Harry smiled as the soft blush his father had on his cheeks and realized Sirius was right.  He needed to talk to Draco, and soon.  With Draco’s new found confidence to do what he wants, Harry knew he’d probably find someone soon if he didn’t.  The blonde knew how good looking he was and Harry didn’t want to lose a chance to be happy.  He watched his friends almost lose that chance while on the run the last year.  He saw what Ron’s separation did to Hermione when she tried to hide it.  Harry didn’t want that.
Remus studied his son, knowing Harry wanted to be accepted by the woman he held close and pulled him in a side hug.  “I think so.  She wants you happy just as much, Harry.  Just give her time.  How’d Ron and Hermione take it?”
Harry nodded and a smile came to his face.  “Being the ‘boy who lived’ wasn’t a piece of cake.  Being whatever they will call me now will be worse, I imagine.  Having people that see me as Harry will always be welcome.  Draco, you never treated me like I would break and I actually admired that about you.  Everyone else, even most Slytherins, in school treated me like some fucking, I don’t even know what, answer or something.  The point is, you didn’t.  You have nothing to apologize for because there’s nothing that needs forgiving.  Through this last year, I let it all go, all the hate, the anger.  It felt good.  I’m sure Hermione and Ron will be alright with you apologizing, but Ron may take longer to forgive.”
"You have hazel eyes. We can take it off at anytime. Severus told us the counter to it in case he didn't make it and you wanted to. As for who you look like, we're not sure. The glamour was on before any of us saw you but Lily and Severus. With Sirius' eyes just as brown as James' we never had a question asked about it."
“Lucius Malfoy, do you swear an oath on your magic to hold your tongue about the information given today?”
“She said it was very confusing.  He was trying to reverse some potion that purebloods forced on the heir, but she didn’t know what.  They have your father’s name in them, a lot.  Something about modifying the contraceptive potions as well.  I think he was trying to find a way to help bearers, mostly James and Lily so another baby wouldn’t be unannounced while war was going on.”
Sorry for the small hiatus but my cat knocked my computer off it's space and the screen broke.  I now have a new computer so yeah!!! Here's an update
Draco nodded and stood back up.  He helped Harry out of his button up and tie, lifting the tank top over his head after.  Harry stood and Draco helped unbutton his pants and push them down while Harry held onto his shoulder, his knees still weak.  Harry smiled once he was naked, already loving the slight cool breeze on his skin.  Draco helped him lower into the tub and then kept his eyes on Harry’s as he undressed.  The Gryffindor leaned forward so his lover could get behind him and sighed when the slytherin pulled him back to rest on his chest.  They sat in the water, letting Harry cool off, Draco running his finger tips over the heated skin lightly.
Harry held out his hand and Remus pricked his finger.  They all watched as Remus took the finger and touched it to the cloud.  After they pulled back, they waited.  If Albus used hallow magic, Harry’s blood may work.  It might take Annaliese's though, Remus was hoping not.  For a bit nothing happened, and they could see some of the other eighth years making there way out for the day.  They weren’t seen though as Sirius put a barrier up as soon as he heard the entrance open.
Draco continued to run his fingers through his boyfriend’s hair, watching Harry’s chest slow in breathing till he was finally relaxed and sleeping.  He knew the nurse was talking to Harry’s family, but he didn’t care what was being said.  He also knew their friend’s were in the room and the smiled softly when Hermione gently touched Harry’s hand.
Harry nodded.  “As much as I know they would, I couldn’t ask Hermione or Ginny.  They are the closest me.  Are their other glamours for this?”
“No.  Padfoot and your papa have told me a bit about the people you lived with.  That is why you’re like that.  I was like that a bit.  When I was with Lily or your papa, I always sat in the floor.  I was most comfortable there.  My father said it was the submissive part to the gene and Remus’ alpha tendencies.”
Harry turned to Molly, who was at the backdoor, and nodded.  He got up and went into the kitchen to help bring out some bowls of food.  Some of the others followed him.  As he was putting the last bowl on the table, Molly pulled him over.
Harry looked back at Draco, letting the man beside him see the concern over Lucius knowing and the desire to know why he’s acting the way he is.  Draco looked at Sirius and then to Remus.  “Make him take an oath.  Harry comes first, or my father won’t know.  Harry’s safety is more important.”
“You have an hour if you need to shower.  Narcissa had Kipper bring over a trunk of clothing for you Draco.”
kind of want to know it’s not just because I can give powerful babies.  It’s going to be hard enough with killing Voldemort.”
Harry blushed a bit and turned his head.  Draco moved his hand and touch Harry’s face, bring those eyes he loved back to his.  “It’s ok.”  he whispered.
Draco nodded.  “Yes, but he had to leave these with Mother and didn’t want Lucius to figure it out.  He would have been just as big a threat as Voldemort and Dumbledore, Harry.”
Remus nodded. “I figured that was why you were asking.  You both need an heir, so to speak.  If it only happens once though, you could just give that baby all of it.”
Harry blushed a bit and nodded.  “We’re getting to know each other, yes.  Nothing else though.  I know what you want to happen, Sirius.  I don’t want to rush him, or me for that matter.”
He smiled and nodded, looking at his best friend's sister. "Good. Hermione helped me figure it out, Ginny. It's not you, it's girls in general."
The sun starting to rise, both knowing they had to get up for class.  Harry used the shower first since Draco tended to take a bit longer in the bathroom.  The dark haired man took a quick shower and brushed his teeth before wrapping a towel around his waist.  He opened the door to see his love sitting on the bed, patiently waiting.  Harry smiled and kissed his blonde before the door could be shut once more.  Walking to their shared wardrobe, Harry pulled out his robes for the day.  He had gotten everything but the tie in place when the door opened.  He watched through the mirror as Draco walked toward him, nothing but a towel.  Boundaries started getting pushed again and seeing that pale skin did many naughty things to Harry’s insides.  Draco smirked at the reflection looking him as he stopped behind his boyfriend.
Harry went first and found Narcissa sitting on a lounge, Lucius behind her.  He couldn’t see Draco, but nodded in greeting.  He moved just in time for Sirius and Remus to have their turn through.
She smiled and something about the expression on her face made Draco question it.  She had this familiarity about her and he couldn’t figure it out.  Harry helped the girl up and they they continued their way to the professor’s quarters.  Draco knocked on the door and then they waited.  The two boys had walked in on the older men more than once and neither wanted to see that again, especially with the girl with them.  The door opened to Sirius looking out at them, only wearing a pair of pajama pants.
Harry watched as a hand came out again, remembering what Sirius told him.  It was true, he didn’t know Draco and some things wizards and witches kept close to them.  He must have taken too long because Draco was starting to move his hand back.  Harry took his hand and heard a gasp.  Looking up, he saw Draco and smiled.  “Friends.”
Harry smiled.  “Just walking about ma’am.  I was wanting to inquire about some robes for Hogwarts?  School is in a few weeks and we're needing some new ones.”
As soon as she left to get food on the way, Remus and Sirius walked into the room.  James scooted on his bed to make sure both men could sit and they all discussed what to do now.  Harry couldn’t do potions because of the fumes, which they would have to hide him somehow.  He also couldn’t do the practical in DA as they could harm the baby.  Draco; however, had those classes at the same time so they had to figure it out.  The other classes weren’t a problem as they didn’t involve anything dangerous unless someone lost control, which for eighth years shouldn’t be a problem.
The tension in the room grew as they watch the red headed woman get as red as her hair.  The ones that were used to her knew it could end badly.  Draco wrapped his arm around his boyfriend, letting Harry shield himself from whatever she was going to say.  The children of the woman just leaned back, knowing the marauders had it taken care of.  Poor Arthur had a feeling they were losing Harry today because of Molly wanting Harry and Ginny to marry; he could see what the Harry and Draco meant to each other.
“No, you’re really not, Harry.  You love Ginny, you wouldn’t have dated her if you didn’t feel anything.”
“He will penetrate you, son.  I know I’m your father, but you need to know that.  You’re heat, it’s instinct and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you both.  We really didn’t think you’d have it since you don’t transform.”
Draco nodded and took a deep breath, letting his body slide till he was almost out before pushing back in.  They both kept their eyes on each other and smiles started as the rythum turned the adjustment in a pleasure neither known before.  Nothing could be heard but moans and pleas and cries.  Their bodies moved on instinct and hands moved till Harry’s wrapped around the headboard to anchor as he started moving his hips with Draco.  Draco could tell Harry was getting close and wrapped a hand around his love, helping him get to the finish line.
Remus watched the whole exchange and when Harry popped way, he lost it.  He got up, not noticing Sirius watching him.  He walked over to Molly and stopped.
She held up her index finger, letting him know she’d be counting.  He turned to the boy next to him to see the anxiety.  He smiled, trying to ease the boy into sleeping alone.  They both knew the underlining problem with Draco not sleeping in the infirmary.  He leaned down and kissed Harry’s forehead.
“Oh, Merlin, Harry.”  Draco sighed as Harry’s fingers found the button of Draco’s pants and slowly kisses his way down the chest under him as the button opened.  Draco fisted his hands in the blanket and arched into Harry’s kisses loving the attention his lover always gave when they got intimate.
“Class you may leave to continue in the library for you research.  Quiz next time to see what you learned.”
Both men shook hands, Harry also shaking them with Lucius while Draco did the same to Sirius and Remus.  Narcissa pulled Harry to him and thanked him again, causing Harry to blush before going through to the floo.  Upon arriving home, there was a letter on the table with a small white owl.  Harry felt his heart pull a bit at seeing the white owl, remembering Hedwig.  Remus took the letter and gave the owl a piece of bacon left from earlier.  He took the letter, addressed to all of them and read it out loud.
She smiled, just a small one, but a smile.  “Alright as can be.  His grandfather passed, so I’ve been helping him anyway I can.  He’s taking over for him and I’m joining him after graduation.”
The boys got up and slipped on some jeans and tees before walking through the halls to the marauder’s quarters.  Neither said anything, just held hands as they walked.  They turned the corner and found Annaleise Dumbledore crying in the hallway.  Harry turned to Draco before letting his hand go and walking slowly to the eleven year old.
“This will be awesome. I also have some money put back from what the ministry gave us for our part in the war, so the building should be a piece of cake.”
“We found her on the way to papa’s.  She has been having dreams about Padfoot and Moony too, she just didn’t know who they were.”
“It’s the bearer defect, gene, honor, what the hell ever.  I found it this morning in Uncle Alphard’s journal of all places.”
Harry leaned a bit to see what Draco had brought and  smiled a bit.  It was the decipher they needed.  It showed the way to read the five different codes the potions master put into each journal at different times, mixing it up so the wrong person couldn’t read it.  It was masterful really, but at least he left it for Draco.
“You got up to leave and dropped, just fainted.  I couldn’t wake you so had Draco get your godfather.”  Remus explained.
Draco chuckled as he closed the door to shower.  Harry watch the door close and then pulled out some lounge pants and a tee, glad it was the weekend.  He wanted to ask James about what he did to Blaise and how it would affect him.  He hoped he didn’t hurt the little one before with whatever magic he used.   He was slipping on his shoes when Draco came out and found a clean pair of pants, slipping them on.  The blonde pulled a jumper out and pulled it over his head before sitting to put his shoes on.  Harry smiled as a hand was held out and he took it, letting the other one lead him down the corridors to his parent’s living quarters for some questions and answers about things only they could help with.
He had already told Draco as much and the blonde agreed.  Having Ginny and Neville on their side would help because everyone thought their Savior would marry the only daughter of Molly and Arthur Weasley.
Draco didn’t hear anything else as he watched Harry open his eyes.  When green met grey, Harry smiled and Draco leaned down, kissing his forehead.  No one said anything.  They all slowly left the couple, knowing they could see their friend and son later; Sirius putting the curtain around them again on the way out.  Harry could see tears in his love’s eyes and tried to remember why he’d be in the hospital bed.
The two men looked at the dog, who just shrugged.  “We talked about things.  She had questions and I answered.  A lot about how I was coping with Remus given how I was raised.”
The other’s agreed and then left to let Harry rest.  Draco leaned back against the headboard, careful not to move his boyfriend.  He kept his hand in Harry’s hair and just watched him sleep.  He still couldn’t believe he was this lucky to have the boy he wanted.  The love they shared wasn’t like anything he fantasized about it...it was better.  He made a vow while watching Harry.  He vowed he would protect them both even if that meant he had to sacrifice himself.  He didn’t think he ever would because Harry was that powerful; however, Draco could almost match him and that meant something.
She also listened.  Listened as Draco, her only son, gave apologies to all three men for his part in the war.  For letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, for Dumbledore.  She heard Harry Potter let her son know that he was there and knew exactly what happened the night of the Astronomy Tower.  Narcissa also listened as Harry Potter, the one person who probably knew her dragon as well as she did, tell her son that it was in the past; that he wanted to get to know the person Draco was now.  Narcissa also listened as her son agreed, hearing the hope in his voice that he was trying to hide.
Harry had a feeling he knew where this was going, but was kind of hoping Lily was his mother. And if she wasn't, why wait till now to say anything? The other two could see the questions forming in Harry and Sirius moved. He sat on the table in front of Harry and put his hands on his godson's knee.
Harry turned his head to look at the small girl to see her looking at him.  If that was true then Albus had found out about his dad; used him, tortured him, raped him.
Sirius nodded. "Yes that, she was fine with it. I won't go into details, but we all took care of her and she didn't go without. She was also barren, which meant no wizard would likely marry her anyway. Our society is all about continuing the line no matter the status. When James found out you were coming, Voldemort was at a height you didn't get to witness. It was bad pup, real bad. Lily convinced us to have help because we had to hide you and really didn't know how to do that. Charlus had convinced Albus that James wasn't a bearer, it died with his grandfather. The Potter's had hid that part of themselves due to the power hungry people, your great grandfather was raped, which is how your grandfather came to be."
"You. It was you. Why hide it? Why not tell me? You helped me during third year, knew me just as long. All I wanted, and you…"
No one said anything, but they knew by the tone in the blonde’s voice, he and his beloved were done with the rumors...the lies.  Draco stared with the mask his father instilled in him and waited.  He knew who would say something, knew that bloody bint wanted to sink her teeth into the chosen one, and knew she couldn’t get them there.  Ron and Hermione stayed still, letting Draco control the situation.  They were quite aware of the rumors and what Lavender and her buddies were saying about Harry.  They also knew Draco wouldn’t really hurt them, mostly because Harry doesn’t want them hurt.  He just wanted the rumors to stop.  Harry, well, he knew Draco was just as fed up and he was.  They just wanted to be happy, which they were.  Harry was hoping tonight would make them extremely happy when they left this morning.  He also knew they’d need to talk about it. For them to move to the next level, Harry was going to have to top till they wanted the risk of a baby. Draco didn’t have good experiences with being on bottom.
Harry couldn’t focus, all he could feel was what it was like to be in that dark room, chained to the wall.  He closes his eyes and then opened them trying to focus.  It wasn’t working and he knew that the young man beside him knew as well.  Harry sat back and closed his book, laying his quill on top of it.
“Draco has been just as bad.  Says while he’s sleeping  Harry is calling to him, but he can’t find him.”
Harry leaned forward and patted his leg.  “She knew.  I remember hearing her and Vernon talk about how mum had some accident and wasn’t able to carry a baby.  She just didn’t know how it happened and figured the freaks figured out how to do it.  I don’t remember how old I was when they argued about it.  I just know the next day I had my cupboard and was treated like a house elf.”
“You’re my mate Harry.  You have to know this.  We’re both wolves.  We mate together.  Malfoy is just using you.  He doesn’t love you.  Wolves only mate with other wolves.”
Harry nodded and sat at the table.  “Molly’s going to ask questions.  Ginny is with Neville, she told me.  I gave their blessing, but Molly always wanted me married to her.”
Harry turned to look at his boyfriend.  “I’m alright,  I still feel the need to be filled, but I’m tired as well.  I may wake you up.”
He pulled back and looked at them both. "I'm just so happy you both are here. Even if I can't have my parents, I have you guys."
Ron nodded.  “Makes sense.  We can go by and ask them.  Freddie’s still recovering from almost dying so they haven’t set up shop yet.”
“Papa.”  he whispered.  He was trying to call him professor with the other students, but he was out of options.
All three men in the room looked at Harry.  Harry took a breath, trying to control the urge now that he knew what it was.  He didn’t want to attack and plead with Draco with his parents in the room.  The one time was enough.
Harry nodded and smiled at his godfather, letting the older man help him up.  They walked quietly to where his three parents were living and sighed as the portrait swung open.  The people within looked at who walked in and a woman stood.
Draco thought on that a bit and then got up, grabbing Harry’s hand.   “Let’s go see if anyone’s hungry.”
The young men stayed in that position for a few moments before deciding to head to breakfast since they were up.  Draco pulled back just enough to grab Harry’s hand and lead him out of the now unlocked door of the classroom.  There weren’t very many up, but given it was Saturday, they weren’t surprised.  Draco let Harry sit first before taking a seat across from him so they could talk easier.  They didn’t discuss what happened in Remus and Sirius’ quarters because anyone could hear that.  Harry smiled and nodded to someone behind Draco.  The blond turned to see the little girl who was most likely a Potter and smiled as well.  She blushed and waved, walking beside another first year student.
“I wish I knew.  I just wanted him gone and he was gone.  Lied about some of the things we do together, it upset him.”
Harry got up when it was time to get ready and took another quick shower.  When he got to his room, he decided to wear robes to dinner since it was with the Malfoys.  Looking through his new things, Harry decided to pick the purple/blue ones and pulled them out.  He took out a pair of black slacks and a white button up for under the robes.  After getting dressed, and slipping into his boots, he went to find the other two.  He found them in the kitchen, having a small moment.  He knocked on the doorframe to let them know they weren’t alone.  The two looked back at him and Sirius whistled.
He slowly crept out of the bed, not wanting to wake Draco and made his way to the bathroom.  He did his business and looked at his reflection.  He raised his tee shirt and touched his stomach.  It was still flat, but he noticed the tough parts where the baby was growing.  He smiled and continued to caress the lower part of his abdomen, whispering his thoughts to the baby.  “You dad and I love you already, little one.  No one is going to hurt you, we won’t let them.  You have so many people who are going to give you love like you will never know.  I will be better than Lily’s family were to me, I promise you.”
Remus knew what he was asking and took his hand.  Remus let the other man pull him in an embrace before apparating them away.  Sirius looked up and saw the front lawn of Malfoy’s home.
Draco looked down at Harry and replied.  “That’s why we now have control of the paper.  Ron, Ginny said your mum is going to try to get Harry over for Christmas.  I will have to be there as well.”
Everyone looked at Harry and he sighed.  “Papa and Padfoot are going to the ministry tomorrow and will not be here for classes.  Sirius only has one class till after lunch anyway and was going to see if Draco could oversee the one first year class at 10. Minerva approved it.  Papa asked me to do an answer type class about the war and things we did to defeat Voldemort so they could go.  Prongs is coming out of hiding.”
Harry nodded.  “Yes, please.  All of them that specifically talk about secrets we don’t want out and some money please.  Just a bag full of galleons will do.”
They nodded as he said the password and then led the students inside.  The common room was done in creams and purples, not wanting to choose one house over the other.  There was an area by the fire with couches and chairs, an area where the desks were set up much like the library.  There was also bookshelves and a place with a chess set already set up for them to use.  Sirius stopped in front of the fireplace, motioning for the students to stop and sit.  After they did, he continued with the information they needed.
They all watched as the man started to cry, turning into his friends, one time lovers.  It was breaking Harry’s heart to see his dad like that.  They had conjured a blanket to put over the stag, but Harry didn’t care.  He moved from the lap he was on and kneeled at the couch, taking his father’s hand.  James jumped a bit and then turned, looking at the young man.  Harry could see the confusion as the hurt man looked into the green of Harry’s eyes, Lily’s eyes.
Both boys leaned forward and their lips met with a smile on their face.  It was just a small kiss, but it held so much promise as they pulled back.  Harry couldn’t help the smile and was happy when Draco’s grew as well.
Harry nodded.  “Yes.  I don’t like what had to happen for that, and what probably happened after that, but I’m alright with her.  It wasn’t her fault, Draco.”
“Hold on Hermione.  How would we do that?  The money alone would be needed and I would have to get my license renewed; I highly doubt that would happen.”
“Why can’t you accept me?  I know Remus told you he’s my papa, James was my dad.  Lily Potter was just my godmother.  I’m a bearer, Draco is who I’m going to be with.  If you can’t accept that, accept me, then you need to leave.  I don’t want to see you.”
Harry just nodded to Theo’s question.  The young men watched as the girl in the room finally sat down in a chair, speechless.  No one said anything for a few minutes.  Everyone in the room knew why the man did what he did; he was power hungry just like Voldemort.  He just knew how to influence the right people.  A knock on the door interrupted the quiet and Pansy opened it as she was the closest.  Ron and Hermione walked into the room and looked at everyone.
“Salazar, Harry, so good...oh fuck...Right there.”  Draco moaned as Harry scissored his fingers, finding a walnut size button in his lover.
Harry woke up to the sound of some alarm and one of the elves yelling at the crazy man who tried to cook.  “Probably Sirius.”  Harry thought as he got out of bed.  He pulled on a pair of jeans since he slept naked.  Something he was glad to be able to do again.  Living at Hogwarts, he only got to indulge in this sleeping pattern during the summer.  Walking into the kitchen, he encountered a cloud of smoke and profanities that let him know it was in fact, Sirius who had tried to burn the house down.
“Love, that would make the children comment valid.  The person in your dream thinks his son is gone and his daughter’s in danger.  You and Annaleise could fit that.  Also explained why the house elves called you Mr. Potter and Harry Potter at the same time.”
“They pulled you into the delusions.  Oh, Harry, you don’t need to change for them to love you.  I know your relatives were down right nasty, but we love you.  You don’t have to do what they want, that’s not love, hun.”
Harry smiled and met Draco half way in a kiss.  Harry’s hands went into Draco’s hair and tangled in it, climbing into his lover’s lap.  Draco smiled into the kiss and let his tongue graze Harry’s bottom lip, slowly caressing them open and entering to tangle with Harry tongue.  A moan came from both men as the kiss deepened.  Draco fell back slowly as they got into it, bringing Harry to lay on him.  When air was needed, Harry trialed his lips down Draco’s jaw line, his hands running down to the hem of Draco’s shirt.  Draco’s own hands were slowly bringing up the shirt of his beloved, who took his mouth away long enough to get the damn thing off, taking Draco’s with him.  Both men sighed as their skin touched.  Harry moved just a tad to stretch his leg, bringing his hip to meet the man under him.  Draco arched into it and they started a dance they have long since perfected.
“There are things I’m still learning are fine.  It affects my father, which is why he was hoping to keep the contract with the Greengrasses.  He’s talking to Astoria's father right now, so we have a few minutes to talk freely.”
Harry was sleeping, which he did a lot due to the hormonal changes and the baby.  Draco smiled as he ran his fingers though the smooth curls, hoping their child had the same hair.  Yes it was messy, but he loved it.  Besides curls would be cute on either a boy or a girl.  He glanced up when he saw movement in the corner of his eye and caught Hermione smiling at him.  He nodded and turned to look back out the window.  No one in the compartment felt like talking, two of them sleeping.  Draco also knew that Harry was nervous about going to the burrow for a late lunch, early dinner tonight.
“One, Severus was gay.  That’s why you didn’t need to worry, that’s why he didn’t have an heir, that’s why I insisted he make Draco his hair, and we, his godfather.  There wasn’t going to be another choice.  Second, not everything is about you, Lucius Malfoy.  This is about our son, Harry Potter, and the notes that actually needed to be given back to him.  If you so much as touch, or influence, a hair on Draco’s head in anyway, you will be in your own wing.  I mean it.  I love you, always have.  I have followed you blindly and it almost cost us everything, including our son.  I will not stand for it anymore.  Either you learn to deal with the changes in Draco, or not.  But I will not listen to your nonsense anymore.”
He stood, waiting for her.  The young man and his companions watched as the woman took in what Harry had told her.  Harry could feel his resolve breaking, but refused to let the woman see it.  She stepped closer and looked into his eyes, for what he wasn’t sure.
"From Dumbledore and Severus. Explains everything from the night at the ministry to Dumbledore's death. I'm so mad at the old man right now. However, I now know why Severus told me where to find them. It was to keep this family together, something Dumbledore promised Lucius if he turned spy. I will not let that promise die."
Draco smiled and nodded, looking up when Poppy came back in.  He whispered his love and then walked out towards the dorm.  He was going to have to figure out how to get past the nurse.  She knew about the cloak, he’d bet his fortune on it.  That’s how smart the woman is.  He was still thinking on it when he reached the dorm entrance.  He walked through and ignored everyone, not wanting to talk.  He made it to their room and walked in to find the four best friends they had.  The four just waited for him to figure out his move and he sighed, sitting on the one chair in the room since they were on the bed.  No one said anything, but Draco was alright with that.  It was quiet for a few moments and then someone knocked on the door.  Pansy got up to get it and Anna walked in, going straight for the blonde.
She nodded and he watched as she swished her wand, running tests to see how he was after the episode.  Draco silently walked out and sat next to Harry as she was finishing up and James sat up in his bed.
Harry nodded and Draco watched him gather his clothes and head to the bathroom.  Draco let out a sigh and laid back down.  He really wanted to give the ginger that did this a piece of his mind.  Harry wasn’t one to act this way, not really.  Draco also knew that if given time, and progress at a normal pace, he wouldn’t have been.
Draco just smirked and took Harry’s knees, placing them on his shoulders, letting him get just a tad deeper, causing Harry to scream.  Draco didn’t let up till Harry came, untouched, before finally letting go.  He made sure to fall next to the boy in bed with him and then took said boy into his arms.  Harry sighed and laid his head on the other’s chest, sleep claiming them in a matter of moments with smiles on their faces.
Draco knew Harry was wanting his reaction and so he held his finger up so his lover knew he wanted to process before reacting.  It made sense.  They were both overthinking some things because of their experiences.  Could it really be that simple?  Could they relax enough to let the instinct out more?
Harry kissed his boyfriend before grabbing a tee and mentioning food.  Both men walked out and made their way to the food, seeing Remus and Sirius already sitting there.
Green eyes closed and a sigh left the slightly younger one as the arousal slowly took over the heat his skin felt.  Turning his head, lips found the lips he loved kissing and sighed as the more dominant of the two deepened the kiss.  Harry’s hand raised and cupped the back of Draco’s neck, holding him in place.
“You still can.  Draco, it’s going to be hard, but I meant what I said a week ago.  I can’t be just friends, not when I feel the way I do.”
"This is a cottage belonging to the Potter's. We figured since the order knew about my house, we would bring you here for privacy and rest."
“Mother’s right, father.  You need to come to terms with what he have discussed.  I will apologize if no heir comes to this, but I will get to marry as I see fit.  I deserve happiness, father, don’t I?”
The students nodded and then followed their teacher, Harry taking Draco’s hand again.  They all walked in silence, wanting to remember how to get back to the dorm.  Sirius was leading the students to a part of the school not used in a while, but was the only place for them to be housed for the year.  They stopped at a portrait of the founders, Sirius turning to look at the ten that followed him.
They all watched as the blonde led his boyfriend out of the room and to another part of the house to help him calm down from yet another run in with the ginger woman who invade their home.
The older men sighed and Sirius turned to his godson.  “I had to help with that.  I believe the muggle phrase is pulling out.  Moony, during the moon, can’t be controlled, or touched.  After a bit, we learned to tell signs on each other.  Well, when Moony was reaching that point, I helped James get out of the way.  Only twice didn’t it work.  Once before you and then you.”
“He’s fine.  Nothing’s broken or gone, thank goodness.  What happened?”  She asked, looking at the students and walking to Lavender to check her as well.
Harry looked at Draco, taking his hand under the table.  “Yes.  With what’s happening in me, I think that’s why I’m the submissive one.  My grandfather stayed home, taught my dad before Hogwarts.  Hell, in my journal, I think he would’ve if the war wasn’t happening.”
Draco let out a breath and then the two men walked around.  They spent the time asking questions.  They avoided questions on the last year, wanting to keep the topics light.  They talked about the differences between Slytherin and Gryffindor and how they both felt about it.  Harry did let Draco know that he convinced the hat to put him in the house he was in.  Draco demanded the story and then felt bad he played a part in it.  The green eyed man let him know it was ok, and Ron had already spooked him about the house because Voldemort was in it.  Draco did feel a bit better about that.
Draco just smiled and lifted the comforter, inviting his boyfriend into the bed.  Harry smiled, still in boxers, and climbed next to the blond.  Neither said anything, just cuddled to into each other.  They hadn’t done much in the last week, but kiss and hold hands.  Harry wasn’t up for it, nor was Draco for that matter.  It was like they took two steps back from where they were when these dreams started taking a toll on the bespeckled man.  Draco started running his hand through Harry’s hair and smiled as he heard a sigh from the man now laying on his chest.
Draco nodded, sitting his journal beside him.  “Seems like it.  Sorry there isn’t much more.  Just the ingredients for it and then the times and stirs and things like that.  I guess you should wait till sex is an issue for it.  Also, the partner you decide on will need to know it may happen the first time you bottom.”
The Malfoy’s stayed and visited some more with the other two for a bit, coming up with how to coexist between houses while their son’s slept in Harry’s room down the hall.
It was the first time he referred to Remus that way, but if Draco noticed, he didn’t comment.  Draco just nodded and walked in, sitting in the floor and opening a book he brought with him.
“Molly, what my dad says is true.”  He raised his sweater before continuing, showing his bump. “I know I’m not that far along, but Poppy says my small body makes me show more.  We’re about two months.  My little bump is enough that people would see the weight gain.”
As they walked in, Harry was greeted by the other Weasleys and then sat on a loveseat with Draco next to him.  The blonde kept their hands intertwined and the dark haired man was happy for it.  Draco had taken to make sure they were touching all the time so his magic would help with the baby.  No one had found out yet; however, Harry wasn’t giving his hopes up to it staying that way.  His private life always had a way of coming into the rumor mill; something he hated.  The twins sat in a couch by the boys and they engaged in conversation about the joke shop and how they were in general.  Fred was recovering nicely, but George had taken over the parts of the inventing that were still a bit dangerous for him to help.  Fred, in return, took to running the front of the shop with Verity.  Bill and Fleur were also at the burrow for the dinner and she looked at Harry with a smile while talking to Hermione
“The dreams. We figured it out.  Talked with the mutts this morning.  Your theory is probably spot on.”  Draco informed them.
“Alright, I get that.  But with the defect, I should’ve been informed.  I’m Harry Potter, things that should not happen tend to happen.”
He was going to have to ask Narcissa Malfoy for Snape’s journals.  He was going to have to let her know he needed them.  The biggest thing, though...he was going to have to ask Draco to help with them.  If anyone knew how to decipher Snape’s words, it was his godson.  Severus had taught Draco everything he knew.  He got out of the tub and dried off before putting on the shorts and walking back to his room.  Grabbing a pair of jeans, he pulled them on and then called for Slinky.
“Mother had this one in her safe.  I guess the house elf forgot this one.  Severus left a way for me to read his notes.  I know it was for me; he taught me this code when he started teaching me potions.”
Draco didn’t take his time, he pounded into the prostate and sucked Harry’s prick, getting his lover there and fast since Harry was almost there anyway.  Draco took his lover’s cum as Harry came and them moved to kiss his lover’s lips.  Harry moaned, tasting himself on Draco.
“Mr. Potter.  The vault you have had access too was set up for your schooling.  It was for anything you needed while at Hogwarts as well as extra for things you wished to have during that time.  Your father and mother set it up for you when they went into hiding encase they weren’t here.  You have another vault, which you now have access too since you are seventeen.  This vault was set up for you to use until you married so that you could have any career you wished and still be able to have some money to help.  This vault also has some heirlooms in it, including the wedding sets your parents wore.
Draco left his hand on Harry’s hip as tongues started to dance with the kiss till air was needed.  He slowly kissed his way down the man’s jaw and smiled as a breathy moan left Harry’s lips.  Draco loved he could make the savior let go, even just a tiny bit.  A moan left his own lips as Harry kissed and bit on his pulse point, causing Draco to buck his hips into the other man.  Hips started to roll back and forth as both men gotten into the snog session.  They had been here before, but both not yet ready to venture past the waist line.  Harry’s legs spread out more as they got into it, rutting against the man over him.  Both men moaned as they were able to feel more of the other, quickening their pace as the race to the finish line was quickly approaching.
“You won’t believe me but know you will see me soon. Oh, and your daughter is safe as the old man is dead now.”
“Molly came over last night.  Worried about us being around you.  Good thing she doesn’t know Draco’s here, Harry.  She’s gone mental.”  Hermione stated.
He then turned back to the men and watched as the blond was the first to show signs of life.  He felt the dog stop next to him and sigh.
The group looked at the man who had spoken. Harry didn't look at the Malfoys, just kept his eyes on Kingsley.
Darkness, all around him.  Harry kept trying to find his way through it, but it seemed useless.  He couldn’t see, couldn’t feel him.  He had lost him somehow.  Everywhere he turned.  Draco was there one minute and gone the next, all that remained was the darkness.
“Me too, Harry.  If you say he’s different than I can get behind it.  Try to help with Molly as well.”
Draco sighed.  “Not really.  We’ve gotten close, but no one’s prick has gone anywhere you think it has.”
Draco pulled a pair of slacks and a jumper over his head.  “Remus asked us to go back to their quarters when you were ready.  Do you remember?”
Sirius squeezed his mate’s hand and smiled a bit.  “If what I read is understood correctly, just holding each other and sharing a bed will work.  No certain activities needed.  While we all know where you two are headed, no babies till you think you’re ready.  Now, Hermione and Ron will be over tonight for dinner, so I think you both should get a chance to sleep a few hours today.”
They let Harry process how it was needed and talked about small things.  James was interested in some of the things that went on while he was in the room.  Remus and Sirius left the real important changes for while they were alone so that James could freely break.  Harry stayed with the Marauder’s for the rest of the free period, listening to stories.  None of them realized how much time actually went by till the door opened and the final Marauder led in three very distraught students.  Draco went right to Harry, who let him pull him into his arms.  The blonde knew something was wrong the minute he knew Harry wasn’t in their room.  It was where he usually waited for Draco before going to dinner with Ron and Hermione following.  The three of them had found Remus on his way to the professor’s rooms and asked if he’d seen the missing quarter of their group.  The other’s in the room watched as Draco and Harry whispered to each other, the blonde making sure the other was alright.
Harry looked over at Remus. It all clicked, everything they told him. The bearer thing, the two marks, why Moony chose him. Sirius and Remus watch as Harry figured it out and while one was hoping he'd be alright, the other was worried he wouldn't be.
Yes, Draco knew the bearer thing made a lot of Harry’s feelings show in ways he never thought; however, being Harry’s rock...Harry’s confidante in ways the others couldn’t wasn’t something the blonde was taking lightly.  He loved Harry’s fire, the passion the dark haired wizard showed in everything he did, it was mostly what drew Draco to him in the first place.  The way Harry’s eyes swirled with the green, all different colors of green, when his emotions got crazy was beautiful.  What Draco loved about this boy, this man, the most was his ability to love in spite of everything he had been through.  His ability to forgive those that wronged him.  When he heard about Remus and Sirius, hell even James and Lily Potter, and seeing that Harry wasn’t as upset as he would probably be if the role was reversed was just part of it.
Smiling, Harry reaches in and pulls out the eggs and potatoes to get started, letting the meat continue to thaw before it’s needed.  Deciding on making some omelets, he reaches back in for the other things he wants to add, picking up some ham as well, before shutting it.  He sits everything on the counter and then grabs a skillet out of the cabinet.  Turning on the stove, Harry sets about making breakfast the muggle way.
He watched as Narcissa’s brows furrowed a bit before her face cleared of emotion the way he had seen Draco’s before the war.  She calmly sat her cup on the saucer and then placed it on the table.  Her hands went to her lap and then she looked back at the young man that held a spot for her dragon, and he in return if she had a say.
Harry smiled at the writing.  He’s have to write them back to let is new friend know any day would be fine as Remus sat down.
I mention where Hermione lives, but didn't actually remember if it has been stated so picked a place.  Has no relevance to HP or JKR, but the first place that popped in my head that wasn't mentioned in the books.  *small lemon* for you wonderful people!
The journals may not have had the information he wanted, but at least now he knew why this had happened.  He sighed and left the empty plate for Slinky while he grabbed some boxers and went for his shower.  He turned the water on and brushed his teeth while waiting on it to warm up.  Sighing, he tilted his head forward, letting the water cascade down his body as the muscles loosened from sleeping on the couch.  The couch was comfortable, but his neck wasn’t used to being bent the way it was when he woke up.  Grabbing the cloth, he made quick work of cleaning himself and then washing his hair before getting out.  His thoughts were jumbled, both with the journals and what Sirius revealed.
Sirius had explained and then watched as everyone processed what was happening.  If he was right, those boys will have to share a bed sooner than they were ready.  Not intimately, but physically.  Neither was going to be able to sleep without the other thanks to Molly fucking Weasley speeding up the process.  Draco caught on first, as did his parents and Remus.  They all watched as Harry was still processing what it meant.  Sirius and Remus knew when their cub figured it out.  Harry started shaking his head and looking down.  He was going to blame himself, the marauder’s knew this.
Draco smiled and ran his fingers closer to the part of his lover that needed him.  A loud moan came for the savior as his prick was gripped in a light touch and sighed as the touch started to move up and down his shaft.  Harry never got tired of Draco’s hands, his mouth was just as good as well.  Draco pulled back and traced his lips over the heated skin in front of him as Harry started to buck his hips into his hand.  He loved giving pleasure to Harry, watching him let go.
Two days, that’s how long it’s been since the lunch with the Weasley’s.  Harry sighs as the sun hits his face, waking him up.  Ron and Hermione were leaving today, and the green eyed wizard was happy for them, really.  He was hoping Hermione’s parents would understand why their daughter did what she did.  Stretching, Harry’s back bends and cracks earning a sigh to leave the man before he sits up.  After grabbing his glasses, he finds his shorts and pulls them up as he stands up, heading to the kitchen.  He finds the room empty and so looks in the fridge to figure out breakfast.
Harry moved his hand and touched Draco on the knee, causing the man to look down at it.  Harry waited for Draco to look back at him and then smiled a bit.
The young Potter and his boyfriend had talked more about things in their pasts; wanting to have a strong, healthy relationship based on honesty and trust.  Draco agreed with Harry that full disclosure was best.  This also included things about the war, things that happened to both boys in the last few years.  Draco had it just as hard, maybe more, according to Harry anyway.  Draco didn’t see it that way on some things.  The young men also, with Hermione, were starting to slowly figure out the reversal to the Malfoy birth defect potion most heirs use.  Not that Severus made it easy.  Quite the opposite, actually, as they couldn’t figure out if it would actually work.  Severus had stopped this research after James and Lily died as well.  Harry sighed as the thoughts he had in his head came to turn.  Draco, the potions, school, all of it.  He knew he should talk with his other half, but really didn’t know how to.
Hey everyone!  I am so very sorry about the delay in writing.  A lot has happened this year.  My dad passed in February and then losing two more members to this awful pandemic, I didn't feel like writing.  I am glad my creative juices are flowing once more though.  This is the beginning of the next part of the story.  Hope you like it.
Draco runs his fingers through the other mans hair.  He didn’t say anything, knowing what Harry was feeling was big.  He also knew Harry just needed to be held.  The news of yesterday caught them both by surprise.  James Potter was dead to the world.  Draco knew his love was beating himself up for not figuring it out sooner.
Harry had just finished folding the letter as he heard to common room portrait open.  He started to smile, thinking Draco and Hermione may have gotten out of Runes early.  The smile left; however, when he noticed Lavender Brown approaching him.  She sat next to him on the couch and he rolled his eyes as she turned to him.
Harry watched Draco, whose face went blank...The Malfoy Mask.  Pansy and Theo made sure to get between Harry and Blaise, knowing the man wouldn’t like what he was going to hear.  Draco; however, was livid.  He hadn’t had a chance to tell Harry about the man that just walked in.  The Zambini’s may have ran to Italy for the war, but Blaise had made Draco’s life hell and almost had Draco to the point of being brainwashed during sixth year.  He was good at manipulation and things were going to get really bad now that he was back.
Draco watched the trees fly by in a blur as the train made the long trek from the school to King’s Cross.  Thinking over the last few weeks of the term, he smiles fondly.  Harry’s bump was progressing nicely and the sweaters worked wonders for the young man’s torso.  No one suspected anything, which they were quite proud of.  Lucius, did however, suggest an article of their choosing so that they could beat the rumor mill.  Sadly, Harry and Draco agreed due to the popularity Harry still had.  He glanced down and the dark haired boy in his thoughts moved a bit, touching the head lovingly.
Harry woke up to the warmth associated with Draco and smiled.  Oh how he loved the boy he was wrapped in.  He looked down and noticed their hands had both landed on his stomach, holding their baby as they slept. A baby, he knew it was coming.  He was also scared of what his reaction would be at hearing the news.  The amount of joy and happiness that filled him yesterday was overflowing and he couldn’t contain it.  That was till the blood last night.  He was so freaking scared of what happened, that he was still trying to wrap his head around it.  He looked back to the wall and sighed.  His dad, thank Merlin, James knew what to do and how to help.  He would always be grateful to him for that.
“Alright.  You and your mother are correct, Draco.  If you don’t want a wife, I will come to terms with that.”
“Of course, Hermione.  This is a big deal.  I would watch some of the others though.  If Blaise gets wind of this, he won’t be on your side.  His family may have fled to Italy, but he’s just as power hungry as Lucius.”  Theo stated.
Harry turned his head and gave Draco a quick kiss before leaving to let him do his business.  He got back to the bed and was sitting down when he noticed a person in the bed next to theirs.  James had stayed the night with them.  The care Harry felt at the gesture was surreal.  Sometimes he was in awe that his father was there, that he was able to talk to him, hug him, see him.  Never in his wildest, ok maybe that’s a stretch, in his normal dreams did Harry think he’d get to talk to his dad.
James cuddled closer to Sirius and Remus led them out and to their rooms.  McGonagall was waiting with Harry and Draco when they got there, not really knowing why they asked for her to come to their rooms.  Remus opened the door and held it for his mate, nodding for them to follow.  Harry kept close to Draco, who wrapped him in his arms as soon as they were in a chair, Harry in his lap.
That man was something else, but he also knew Ron was right.  Draco was drilled in having kids, keeping the money in the family,  not letting their name die out.  Harry was also the last of the Potter’s, which led to his dad.  Could he only bear one child, or did his father just not have more because he died?  Why did his grandfather only have one while others had many?  Was he the only line with bearers, or were there more?  The last question, well...Hermione could probably answer.  The rest, Remus probably could, or Sirius.  Remus wasn’t a pureblood, he was half.  Sirius; however, being a Black, may know more.  He’d ask them tomorrow, or when the need arose.  “When I want kids, that’s when those need to be asked.”  Harry mumbled out loud.
Harry turned to see Sirius and smiled, moving to let him sit. Sirius didn't say anything, but handed him the sandwich he brought out for him. Harry ate it silently, trying to figure out all the thoughts in his head. One question popped up and he turned to Sirius.
“Your father helped me out a lot when I went to school here.  It if wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have met the people that led to my mate and my son.  However, no one really knew him.  He was just as power hungry as Voldemort and was willing to do anything for that power.  I’m sorry honey, and I know you won’t believe.  That’s ok because he’s your daddy.  If I find Harry’s daddy though, I will not like your daddy anymore.”
“Yes, baby.  There was a reason for that oath you stupid bint.  Harry can press charges on that alone.  He wont because he’s Harry, but he can.”  Ron stated.
A lemon will take the last part of the chapter.  You have been warned.  It's not my best as I'm really tired so I hope you like it.  I wanted to get it up for you guys.  Thanks as always for the reviews and kudos, I love you all!
Draco got up and then helped Harry up as well.  “I say, of course, but I don’t share you.  You’re mine and I’m very possessive of my things.”
“Padfoot, what did I tell you about cooking?  I swear, you and James could burn the house down.  I can remember Lily yelling at you both constantly.”
The moment was interrupted by Sirius asking if they were ready to head to a great afternoon with Molly.  Harry and Remus just shook their heads, knowing the man wasn’t ever going to get along with the monarch of the Weasley clan.
“I love you and your papa so much, sweet thing.  You will never have to wonder because I’m going to tell you all day every day if I have to.”  the blonde whispered, closing his eyes in a silent thought.
“He is not yours you stupid bitch.  Don’t start that crap about werewolves and whatnot either.  Remus Lupin had a human mate, they produced a human child.  Harry may be his son, but he’s not a werewolf.  They don’t get to choose their mates and it’s hard to live without them.  You have no idea what Remus has been through without Lily here and you almost took his whole reason for living without her.  If Harry never wakes up, you will be in Azkaban.  If he wakes and we find out some things, you will still be in Azkaban.  I will make sure of it.  Be glad I don’t kill you.”
Remus nodded at his mate, sitting next to him.  “Because of the bearer gene, you will tend to be submissive to Draco.  You both probably already kind of feel it as you progress in the relationship.  James was to a degree.  With me, I’m alpha, so it was a given for both him and Sirius.  However, he also was with Lily.”
After hearing this, Harry found Neville.  That poor man was sitting outside with the twins and didn’t look too happy.  Harry approached with caution and his friend looked up, attempting to smile.  The yelling went on, but Harry and the others were just grateful they learned to tune the monarch out long ago.  Harry let out a breath and gave his friend an apologetic look.
Harry nodded and gave a small smile to Sirius.  Sirius nodded and mentioned Slinky had made breakfast.
He then went into what he heard.  It was like second year all over again.  Harry just wanted to be normal.  Sometimes being a Potter sucked, but what was he to do.  At least he had his friends.
“Hush, you know damn well Harry isn’t going to marry a Weasley.  Now Harry, how did tonight go?  After assuming, and being correct, Sirius let me know.”
They all watch as the lady of the house walked out with grace, her robe flowing out like a river behind her.
Remus summoned the cloak as the others left to do what was asked.  After getting the cloak in hand, Remus walked slowly to his mate and friend.  James looked like he was just bone.  He was naked and dirty and his eyes held no life in them.
“I have already told you and Remus that Arthur and I will deal with Harry.  He needs a mother, not some gay dog and his pet werewolf.”
Hermione’s eyes widened a bit and Ron just look confused.  After they were all finished, two of the trio followed their friend and his boyfriend back the rooms.  No one said anything till they were Harry and Draco’s room, glad no other “eighth year” was up yet.  Hermione and Ron sat on the bed, while Draco took a chair and Harry just stood up.  The blond sat quietly while he let Harry explain everything from what they found out just hours ago.
“Papa, your son is Harry Potter.  Harry Potter knows, and is close friends to the new Minister of Magic.  He also happens to know that the new minister would see the benefit in showing all creatures and status’ that the ministry doesn’t support the same values as the Dark Lord Harry Potter just defeated.”
Harry furrowed his brow when nothing more was said, confused about the last comment.  He didn’t understand while Draco would use it to get out of the contract if he needed the heir in the first place.  Before it could be elaborated upon, Slinky popped back.
Harry nodded.  He felt bad for the man he was becoming friends with.  Seeing the look in Sirius’ eyes, he was sure Sirius wished he was enough for Remus once upon a time.  If he didn’t take that potion James Potter wouldn’t have been needed by the werewolf.  He also saw it was something Remus knew as well.  He watched as the wolf took his godfather into his arms and held him.  Harry sensed it was something they don’t talk about, like at all.
Harry sat up and watched as he stroked the prostate, watching as Draco started to pull at his hair, moaning and crying in ecstasy.  Hips started to thrust as Draco started to fuck himself on Harry’s fingers, cries of “don’t stop, I’m almost there” caused Harry to add to what he was doing and took his other hand, wrapping it around Draco’s prick.  His lips were next and he slowly took Draco into his mouth and hummed around him, taking ever drop of cum that squirted into his mouth as soon as the humming started.
Harry nodded. "Can you give me time? To think about all this. What I am, who I am. I never thought passed Voldemort anyway."
Ron and Hermione didn’t add input, but quickly followed their friends to the Defense lesson.  They got there to see Harry with his head down and Draco running his fingers through his hair.  They took their desk in front of the boys and turned to silently ask what was up.  Draco just smiled and leaned down to whisper in Harry’s ear.  The young man sat up and fixed his glasses, making sure they were straight.  The rest of the class started to make their way in, Remus closing the door behind himself.  Remus glanced at Harry, noticing he didn’t sleep well again.  He knew his son enough to know he wouldn’t talk till he was ready.  He was like James in that way, and no one was going to make him.  The wolf just hoped Harry was at least talking to Draco.
Remus smiled.  “Not as fast as your thinking.  I was up at two for some water and they were still discussing things in the books.  Could you floo Narcissa so she knows he’s here...again.”
Lucius looked at his wife, who just stared, daring him to deny it.  He looked at the three on the couch, each with the same daring stare.  He then looked back at his son.
Hermione came back and looked at the portrait.  “Harry, if he used hallow magic, you broke the wand.  It’ll have to be opened another way.”
Sorry about the updating schedule.  Been working and moving this summer, shouldn't be too long between them from now on.
Both older men shrugged.  “We didn’t get a chance to ask Charlus that, cub.  The fact that James got pregnant twice makes us think you can have more than one though.”
Draco, glancing as his love, knew they’d be doing that tradition with their little bundle soon enough.  He was fine with that as it was something his family did as well.  Draco talked about how they did Christmas morning and how they waited till after brunch to open presents as friends often stayed and their parents came for the brunch, which was around lunchtime.  Sirius and James remembered that one as well since most pureblooded families did that.  Remus had a different tradition where they celebrated for eight days.  He explained his mother’s family was Jewish and so he got both holidays.  Draco didn’t understand, so they told him and Hanukkah and the Jewish tradition.
“Maybe she should treat you with respect.  Honestly Harry, I know I am very stubborn and set in ways, but this isn’t right.  Telling you who to love isn’t right.  Gin also told me that’s why Charlie hasn’t been home.  Apparently he has a husband as well.”
Since they were at an impasse, Harry and Draco took Annaleise back to the Gryffindor tower before going back to their own room.  All three were quiet, but that was to be expected with the news they found out.  The girl couldn’t believe her daddy would do that to Harry’s daddy, but hopeful that everything would turn out alright in the end.  All she knew was when her daddy visited at the cottage was how special he kept saying she was, that her papa would be proud if he was still alive to see how much she had learned.  If James Potter was her papa, well...she didn’t really know what to think.  When they reached the tower, she said her thanks and the boys watched her go through the portrait before heading back to their own corridor.
Harry took that in and stood up.  He hugged his papa to him and sighed.  As he pulled back he looked at the man.  “What about after I born?  How did dad not get pregnant right on?”
They watched as Lavender looked at the people in the room.  She shrunk back a bit as she met the Werewolf’s eyes.
Harry just nodded, happy to be leaving. They were able to sneak out quietly and then as soon as they could, apparated to a cottage. Harry didn't know about it and so Sirius took him side along. He looked up at the dog and furrowed his brow.
“What we are about to tell you is to stay in this family.  Your son and ours are special, and will be part of something bigger than you and me and the war.  Harry has to be hidden.  The only people who know alive are those in this room, bar you.  Severus trusted your wife and your son, but not you.  Harry needs your help, Lucius.  Are you willing to by oath to give it?”
Everyone then watched as Draco learned of what Harry Potter really needed his help with.  There was no way for Draco to think the dark haired man would be straight if he wanted to know if he could prevent unwanted pregnancy.  Why would that be an issue if he wanted a woman?  They saw when he figured out Harry Potter wasn’t only a bearer, but gay as well.  Harry watched as the blonde’s eyes found his, they were wider than normal.  The savior kept his green eyes on the grey ones and they held a silent conversation.  Neither really knew what to say, but Harry was hoping Draco would be alright with what had been said.  He felt Remus and Sirius shift, each touching him in a way to let him know they were there.
“We think your body has a natural contraceptive.  It’s why Severus was using James’ blood in his work.  His body never developed a fetus from the times I couldn’t let him go, not
“Master Moony, Master James Potters is here.  He’s in a locked room and the magics is hards to figures out.”
“Can you two please let me in on it? Ever since we got out of the damned place, something’s been up.”
Draco nodded.  “It could help.  I may need Hermione.  Don’t tell her I said that though.  I’m just getting stuck and she’ll understand it better than you, babe.”
They were sitting on the couch, just enjoying each other in the down time.  Harry sighed and pushed tighter into Draco’s embrace.  The blonde sighed and Harry felt lips kiss his head.
Everyone chuckled and finished their lunch before leaving the restaurant.  Each couple decided to spend time with their significant others, as alone time was hard to come by with all the research they were doing.  Draco and Harry walked down the small main street, just being together and window shopping.  Neither had discussed how they would come out to, well...everyone.  Knowing Harry would be front page no matter what, they were trying to play their relationship down.
Harry shook his head.  “No, thank you Mandlshank.  However, I would like to see if one of the vaults has any journals on the history of our line?  There are some things I’m curious on.”
“Don’t give a shite.  Pansy and Theo know, I sent them owls a few weeks ago.  They weren’t surprised I finally grew some balls and let Lucius have it.  Quoting Pansy mind you.”
“James, you know how things are.  You know what Harry needs to know.  You and Sirius both are letting him run away with things not right.”
Draco pulled Harry into a classroom and locked the door behind, pulling the slightly younger man to him.  He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to.  Harry knew what he was doing and welcomed the comfort greatly.  James Potter was alive, he was here in this castle somewhere.  Harry couldn’t believe it.  His family was here, always been here.  He really hated the ex-headmaster at the thought he had to endure all that pain and abuse when his father was here being raped and tortured by that man.  Harry pulled back so he could look at his boyfriend and smiled when Draco offered a smile himself.  Harry nodded, letting the other man know he was alright and just processing.  Draco moved his hands to cup his boyfriend’s face and leaned in to give a small kiss of assurance.  Harry smiled into the kiss and welcomed it greatly, realizing how much he missed the man holding him, and told him as much.
Remus nodded and smiled a little.  “I can explain, Harry.  Lucius will also need to know.  The Malfoy’s need to know how to act with you and Draco.  Are you alright with it?”
Thank you all for the kind words before this chapter!  I started my new job and since we're short staffed I am working 6 days each week.  This leaves no time to write, which sucks!  I am working on the next chapter, but wanted to give you lovely people a heads up that it may be longer than normal.  Hope you like the new chapter.
“No, it’s beyond that.  He looks at that snake for everything.  It’s like he can’t make decisions on his own. He always sits in the floor, or lower than Malfoy.  They hated each other for years and now it’s like Harry’s Malfoy’s puppy.”
“Please, Draco please.  I need you in me, please.”  Harry panted, bringing Draco’s lips back to his.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at the gray staring back, more like the silver, of his boyfriend’s eyes.  “I trust you, Draco.”
“Alright class.  Today we are covering shields.  I know this was covered before, but there are ways to make them stronger.  Today, you will be making notes on the chapter beginning on page 202.  The ways to make your shields stronger are very complex, the more you know, the stronger the shield.  This also helps in things like occlumency, which will be studied starting next week.  This is very important and I know note taking isn’t fun.  This is why I won’t be assigning your essay till we have discussed and practiced the techniques.”
Draco moved his hand and placed it under his boyfriend’s face, tilting it up so he could see his yes.
“Something my dad said today.  He heard me asking Sirius a question about boundaries.  While James Potter is my father, he didn’t raise me.  Was kinda weird though.”  Harry whispered.
“I asked Slinky to go to Narcissa about speaking with her and Draco today, before tea.  I don’t want Lucius to know, but I think her and Draco need to.  She’s guarded this for years and I’m going to need Draco to decipher it.”
He had whispered that part, hoping she got the meaning. He was trying not to be too loud because they were still in the Great Hall and the press would be even more up his ass if they heard their conversation. He watched her face as her brown eyes widened in realization. He just smiled, a small smile, and looked at her. She smiled back and nodded, not saying anything. She kissed his cheek and the smile that appeared when Neville walked up made telling her loads better. Harry pulled his friend into his arms and hugged him.
The rest, but Hermione, took that at face value, digging into the meal.  She didn’t say anything though, to which Harry was grateful.  He didn’t know how to word the dream and the feeling behind it.  Feeling eyes on him, he turned and saw Remus and Sirius looking at him.  The gryffindor smiled, letting them know silently he’d talk later.  They nodded and went back to their own meal.  Harry didn’t know how they could know something was off, but Remus probably could through his wolf sense.  Due to that, he’s probably talked to Sirius, who was just as intuitive due to being a dog animagus.  While he know they meant well, Harry wasn’t used to so many caring about why he wasn’t sleeping.
They all watched at Blaise looked over everyone, trying to figure it out.  Harry and Draco stood close, but not close enough to show they were together.  That was something Draco did on purpose and Pansy was almost between them in front of Harry.  This made Theo closer to Draco.  They saw the smirk on Blaise’s face and Pansy leaned more to Harry, silently telling him not to do anything.  Harry's nod was short to show he understood.  He knew the Slytherins he came to know where glad this one wasn’t back and that there had to be a good reason.  He was hoping to know it soon.
Moving his head, he saw his hands were chained to the wall above him, his ankles to the floor below him.  He couldn’t see anything but darkness, always darkness.  He had no sense of time, of place, of anything really.  Where was he?  Why wasn’t anyone looking for him?  Why did the old man leave him here?  Why hadn’t the same man been back for his daily bout of abuse and rape?  His daughter.  Most of all, he hoped his daughter was alright, that she wasn’t getting hurt by the old man as well.  He’d already lost one child, a son, and he really hoped the baby girl was alive.
Harry walked over to his boyfriend and looked in.  The bathroom was nice.  It had a seperate bath and shower, both looking like three or four could fit at once.  The savior blushed at the thought and turned back to their room.
The two looked at the eighth years in green and the older nodded.  They told the two some about Harry’s father and the time he really spent in captivity and with who.  He could see the upset it caused his friends and he smiled, knowing Pansy and Theo hated what the Potter family went through.  They did promise to keep it a secret and then Anna left to meet her friends in her common room.
Harry just nodded and Draco smiled.  “Go shower, love.  I’ll sent a patronus to Remus to see if he’s up for a visit.”
They then sat back and talked about non-serious things, Remus making sure the boys had all their things packed and ready to go.  As time went by, the boys headed into bed to make sure they got enough sleep.  Harry pulled his shirt over his head and changed into some boxers as Draco went to change in the bathroom.  Draco came back in as Harry was climbing into the bed.  He smiled and climbed in next to him, pulling Harry to him so his back was to Draco’s chest.  This was their favorite way to sleep, Harry wrapped in Draco.  Harry always felt so safe, protected, when Draco wrapped his body around his.  Kissing the back of Harry’s head, Draco whispered, “Goodnight” and they drifted to sleep.
“Yes, but your son and Hermione killed as many pieces of him as I did.  Neville took out the piece that let me finish him.  Voldemort made seven horcruxes, Molly.  I didn’t do this alone.  I was also one and almost died because of it.  I’m not speaking, I just want to be left alone.”
The adults look from their son to the girl experiencing the same thing to the blond next to their cub.  Remus looked at Sirius and nodded before turning to the two people that needed reassurance about something.
Draco nodded and let Harry kiss him once more before getting up, helping Harry up as well.  Both boys walked into the kitchen, holding hands, and took a seat at the table.  No one talked as they ate the breakfast Remus cooked since Harry was occupied.  Harry could feel the tension between the two older men in the room and hoped he was right about Sirius.  He knew his father was alright with Draco, and he thought the same of his godfather.  He just hoped he could count on these two when the wizarding world found out about his choice of partner.  He knew Molly would freak, but he also knew a talk with Ginny was needed first.
Sirius was taking over in Potions as Horace decided to go back into retirement.  He was third in the class, tied with Severus under Lily, so Minerva knew he’d be able to teach the students what was needed.  He’d also be there to help with the Defense classes and Remus.  She smiled as she saw the students starting to walk in and saw Harry and Draco.  The blonde was leading and Harry had the biggest smile on his face.  She could tell their relationship was going to cause problems and you could almost see some of the children whose parents were now in Azkaban getting up.
“I’ve been having dreams where someone is asking me to find Padfoot and Moony.  The voice says he’s in the lost room.  Do you know the lost room?”
“Sirius leave him alone.  Let him figure out what to do.  If you didn’t have someone mark you, you’d probably still be trying to figure out why you like men.”
The slytherin shrugged.  “I think she wouldn’t have been able to keep it a secret if she got it.  We saw her two days ago, Harry.”
Harry was nervous, as he should be.  The last three times he was at this place he used to think of as home, he was cornered into what he should do and how he should do it.  Dealing with Molly Weasley was all fine and dandy, but he wasn’t going to jeopardize the baby just to hear her nag about his relationships.  His dad already told him not to worry, he would take care of it.  Harry was slowly learning the pureblood way of things, so to speak.  He was grateful as he knew his dad just wanted to be with his mates and leave everything to Harry and the baby.  Draco, Harry knew was also learning, but that had been pretty much their whole lives.  That’s also why Draco’s Christmas present was nestled safely in Harry’s chest.  It was something the head of the house normally got for the heir, but Lucius gave Harry permission to give it to Draco instead.
Remus nodded.  “Now, they haven’t progressed that fast.  Sirius, you saw James with Lily the whole time at Hogwarts.  He was always different with her.  Always the more submissive one.  It the gene.  I know because he found it in a journal.  I didn’t think Harry would be though, not with the way he grew up.  But, seeing that look.  He’s already that dependent on Draco, Draco will be as well if I’m right.”
They all waited and watched the death eater contemplating what was asked.  An oath was serious, almost as much as the vow.  Whatever his wife and son knew, it was huge, and most likely a danger to the defeater of the dark lord.  Lucius knew Sirius would be stating the vow, as a pureblood, he would know what to say to make the breaking of it worse than death.  He looked at his son, and Harry, trying to figure out how it would benefit him, as any slytherin does.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Not Luna, she’s with Rolf Scamander, Molly.  I also happened to mention blokes in that argument.”
Remus smiled.  “That’s quite alright, Harry.  While there are still Death Eaters out, I wouldn’t want you too anyway.  I would be too scared for you.  We were all so frightened something would happen to James that we didn’t consider how you would take it.  Then James and I wanted to wait till you were old enough to understand.  When he died, I...well, the ministry wouldn’t let me have you.  Sirius got locked away, Lily was gone.  James and I didn’t setup any precautions for if he died and I didn’t.  I’m sorry for that, cub.  So fucking sorry you had to live with that awful woman.”
Draco smiled.  “Not a bit.  You have been without them for quite a while, your whole life.  They being here is fine and makes sense.  They were personal with your parents, especially James.  They know more than us, or even my parents, let alone Hermione Granger.  I think they’ve warmed up to us being together, anyhow.”
Ron and Harry nodded at the information and then sighed.  It was a lot, but it made sense to Harry.  His body wasn’t made to carry babies, not really.  It must be really hard on a bearer to have even one child.  He looked back up to his papa.  “So I can only have one?”
Harry pulled back and looked at her. "What about his parents? Lucius helped hide Sirius, helped Severus. Narcissa lied to the bastard for me, telling him I was dead. They helped our side as much as their son."
Harry slouched a bit in his seat, knowing why they were still rebuilding.  They didn’t have to wait long for the journals or the bag of gold.  All three thanked the goblins once more before returning home so that Harry could learn a bit more on just what it was to be a bearer, hoping on good news about family and maybe even a chance with a certain blonde wizard who is apparently under a contract for a wife.
Draco let out a breath.  “Sleeping.  He’s not sure what happened.  He said he just wished the boy left and he left.  We may go see his dad to see if they know.”
He watched Ginny’s brows furrow in concern then pulled her friend and boyfriend into a secluded corner, throwing a muffliato on the way.  The youngest Weasley and the Longbottom listened as Harry told them about Draco and their progressing relationship.
“Don’t be.  We knew I was coming back.  I had to talk to Anna first.  She came to make sure you were alright.  Pansy and Theo know about your connection with her now, though.”  He whispered.
Harry trudged up the stairs, looking for his friends, while the older men found Arthur in the living room.  Harry was hoping to talk to Hermione and Ron about his conversation with Malfoy.  He wanted them to know the blonde was hoping to make amends with them as well.  He knew warning Ron would be beneficial to him, especially if he would actually get something he wanted.  He still wasn’t quite sure about that, but couldn’t help but have a little bit of hope.  Some of the tiny signals Draco was giving, Harry couldn’t help but hope.  Narcissa and Sirius’ cryptic talk didn’t help that either.  He knocked on Ron’s door once he came upon it, not wanting to disturb anything he’d rather not see.
“They’ve been like this all summer.  Molly kicked it out of them, not that we all know what exactly that means.  Harry will be quieter and looking to Draco for guidance.  It has to do with what we discussed when making housing arrangements, Minerva.  However, if you watch, they both bring out the best in the other.”
Ron watched Harry’s face as it lit up.  “Good.  I don’t really understand a lot about what’s going on.  Hermione’s tried to explain what she found out, but it’s hard.  She did let me know that the submissive part of you depends on the abuse.  She talked it over with that specialist while we were away.  Apparently you being abused the way you have is one of the reasons why you’re so submissive with him.  Not that is much, but it was enough I was worried.”
Draco smiled and stood up.  He stepped out and grabbed two towels before turning to help Harry out.  The dark haired boy smiled and let his lover wrap him up before carrying him to the bed.  Draco gently laid Harry down and crawled on top of him, rubbing their pricks together.  Harry grabbed him and pulled him down, tongues dancing as they started to grind against each other.  Harry was in heaven, feeling Draco all over, the heat, the sensation, the wetness.  Wait, wetness.  Harry pulled back a bit and looked at Draco, who was trying to make sure he was alright.
There was no asking in the statement and Sirius knew it.  He also knew that Remus knew where Harry was, and it wasn’t the cottage.  They had only seen this situation once, well Harry’s reaction, and it was on James.  It was also something that Remus and he were going to have to tell the Malfoys, well Draco.  Remus would be better at it.
Remus nodded. “Yes, your godfather also let it known James would have helped with that.  Molly wasn’t too happy.”
He sat up and wrapped his arms around the green eyed man, resting his chin on the other’s shoulder.  He felt Harry take a few breaths before his body turned to look at him.
Harry woke up feeling a tad overwhelmed.  Yesterday, they had found his dad.  A man everyone thought was dead.  He had so much he wanted to ask his dad; he just didn’t know how.  James Potter had been through hell and back, just as his son; however, it was different.  Harry didn’t need a mind healer, not to the extinct that his dad did; at all really.  He smiled as he felt his boyfriend pulling him closer, a breath on his neck letting him know Draco wasn’t quite awake yet.  Harry slowly turned around to see the peaceful look Draco wore in his sleep.  Harry loved seeing him this way, not a care in the world.  While awake, they had a lot to worry about.  Lines they hadn’t crossed because they were both scared as hell a baby would come of it.
Harry moved the books, giving them to Remus, who sat them on his lap.  He then got up and walked a bit to Draco.
Draco smiled and ran his fingers down Harry’s jaw.  “I have questions as well.  Why didn’t they ask us about anything?  Why not tell about the heat just encase?  As for the baby, I still stand where I did when we started Severus’ notes, Harry.  I would be honored to have a baby with you.”
The old Dark Arts teacher and his beloved’s godfather kept this from him, knowing how much he would have needed it.  Draco also understood why they did that.  Voldemort, hell even Lucius before taking that vow, probably would’ve loved “loving” a bearer.  Knowing James Potter was kept safe because of Dumbledore was new, but Draco also understood that.  Feeling movement within his arms took Draco out of his musings and to pull his head back just a tad.
Harry, Remus, Sirius, and Narcissa watched as the young heir marched out of the room with his father trailing like a wounded animal after him.
Harry’s smile had gotten bigger at the suggestion and leaned to kiss Draco, deepening the kiss.  Both men moaned at the feeling of tongues dancing, the blonde’s arms tightening around Harry’s waist.  Not that Harry minded, not even a little.  He moved his hands to where his arms were around the blonde’s neck, holding him place as the kiss continued.  They both missed this too much and soon, they found themselves with Harry’s back against a wall.  Harry moaned as Draco’s hands wondered under his shirt, loving the feel of his boyfriend’s hands on his skin.  Draco didn’t wonder too far, but the snogging was worth it till air was needed.  Draco rested his forehead against the other, both panting and trying to gain some oxygen.
She shook her head.  “I’m trying to find Professor Lupin’s rooms.  I think I got lost.  It’s just I haven’t been sleeping and having strange dreams.  I was hoping he and Professor Black could help.”
“It means you get to be happy, Harry.  You’ve always wanted a family.  Not mine, not anyone else's, one to call your...just yours.  If what you said about last night, with Sirius and his mum, maybe you can have some happy.”
"Your mother knew. She took care of you like you were her own, but it was James that saved you that night. James' blood. Charlus told us not to let anyone know because people, especially Albus, would want a bearer. They are rare and more powerful than anything. After school, the four of us moved to Godric's Hollow. Peter told us he couldn't because of his mother. James and Lily were using her as, oh what's it called?"
“It isn’t Harry.  The journals don’t say how not to get pregnant because there isn’t a way around it other than you topping.  It sucks, but there you have it.  The wolf wouldn’t let James and so I had to try real hard not to get him pregnant sooner.  You were not planned, not while Voldemort was as large as he was at the time, but you were welcomed.  You were, are, loved every bit of every day since we knew about you.  Severus was working on some things to help with it after learning our biggest secret.  We don’t know if he managed anything though, he was never able to let us see his notes.”
Nothing was said for a long time.  Both young men really didn’t understand the dream Harry had been having since the first night back.
Harry blushed a bit, but a huge smile appeared.  He could be touched, by his love.  He could be touched, and not go into panic.  He put his hands on Draco’s neck and pulled him closer, kissing him.
Later that day, Harry took Draco to a clearing he had found by the lake.  You could still see the castle, but no one would be able to see them.  Harry had told him he would come to the spot during fifth and sixth year when all the rumors about him were all over the school.  As they sat down, on a transfigured blanket, Draco pulled Harry to him.  The night was bright with stars and the moon was almost full.  He knew from learning about Harry that even though he didn’t change, the moon still affected him.  Harry let Draco pull him close and sighed.  He never thought he’d be as happy as he was in this moment.  There were things James had told him today, things that may help Harry.  Of course, details didn’t come into play; however, his father was slowly learning how to be intimate and wanted to help Harry.
The last vault is the family vault.  In this vault is the rest of the heirlooms generations of Potter’s felt needed protection as well as the rest of the family money.  You are to gain this vault upon marriage.  Your children also have vaults, a total of three.  These are for them to use till you can set up their own vaults.  Altogether, the vaults hold multi millions in galleons, Mr. Potter.”
“Theys being at the Manor, sirs.  Theys weren’t sure what Master Harry woulds wants to go there so they be cleaning it for you.”
Draco let out a breath.  He was telling them today, Harry and he had talked about it.  Draco hated not telling his friends, but knew Harry had to get to know them as more than they being slytherin.
Sirius just looked at her and moved the cloak.  The two women gasped and the nurse went into work mode.  They watched as she took her wand out and started working on the man.  The man still hadn’t said anything, but they watched as he kept his eyes closed.  They did watch as he turned his head into Sirius’ stomach and kept a hold of Remus’ hand, clutching onto it like a lifeline.
“Up, love.”  Harry whispered and Draco obeyed, lifting his hips for Harry to take his pants and boxers off.
He felt the spell go up and noticed Theo lay his wand back down.  His friends silently waited for more information.  Pansy and Theo knew what being a bearer meant, just why their friend was nervous about intimacy with Harry, his boyfriend would probably get pregnant the first time.  It was Harry Potter after all, nothing went the normal way for him, or Draco Malfoy for that matter.
“Why not ask Poppy?  She helped me.  I didn’t renew for obvious reasons.  You; however, would be a great Healer, Hermione.”
Draco stood to his full height.  “No, Her family doesn’t want me anymore anyway, not with a mark on me.  You will get out of the contract, you will not make another, and I will marry whomever I want.”  He then turned to Harry.  “I will help you.  I know there’s more, but as we were interrupted, we can discuss it later.  Father and I have business to deal with.  Come Lucius, we need to deal with this now.”
Everyone jumped as Lucius broke the silent exchange the adults were watching the younger ones engage in.
The two turned to see everyone looking at them.  Harry reached out to his partner, the blonde taking his hand in assurance.  Harry stood as tall as he was able and looked the older woman in the face.
The guests followed the Malfoys into the dining room, but one stopped another.  Harry looked at Draco, who was holding his wrist.
Draco then spent the next two hours answering questions and telling of his summer with his boyfriend, his beloved.  Both Slytherins listened, knowing now why Harry had to trust them first.  It was a great risk of people knowing his secret.  When Draco told his two friends about Molly Weasley’s reaction, Pansy stood up.  The two young men watched as their female friend paced the room for a bit.  They both knew how protective she was over those she was close to and for her to hear the things that woman said about Harry and Draco was going to piss her off.
Everyone felt the magic consider and put the oath in place.  She was toast if she went against it, they all knew that.  McGonagall then turn to Pomfrey.
“Yes.  I remember.  You do know we’re going to be stopped in the common room though right?  We don’t know where everyone is or what time it is.”
He nodded.  “The same for us and Harry.  This will work.  I’m just glad I thought to look in Alphard’s journal.”
Harry nodded, and Draco answered.  “I understand.  Lucius raised me to believe in the same things he was taught.  But when I figured out I was one of the things he was against, it was hard for me.  I was ready to do the family duty, marry a witch.  After the war, I didn’t want to.  Mother knew I didn’t.  That was why she was trying to help me break the contract before I was able to.  I won’t hurt him, I’m not capable of it.”
Remus stood in the doorway and watched the two young men sleeping in the floor.  It had been about three days since they had a break in the notes from the late Potions Master and the wolf knew his son was getting a bit overwhelmed with everything Severus had researched.  He had heard them talking, just last night about the effects of the contraceptive and the only way to really see if it would work.  He also knew they only spoke of it twice because of the blossoming relationship.  He had yet to tell Sirius that his cousin and godson were starting to push the boundary of friendship into something better, something each of them needed.  While Sirius was happy for Harry, he was also worried.  Worried that Draco would use him due to Lucius’ teachings when growing into the man that was currently laying next to their cub.
Harry nodded, at least happy one of his father’s understood.  He wasn't angry at them for not telling him, just upset they couldn’t have been prepared.
“Harry, our society...let me finish.”  Ron stated, before continuing. “Well, it’s about procreating.  Yes, some don’t want children, which makes your sexuality easier to deal with.  Some can’t have children, so they tend to find those like them.  If what Hermione said is true, it’s going to be hard.  He’s been drilled to have kids since birth.  Most purebloods have.  Also to find the best match, which is probably why mum’s gone ballistic on Gin.  You’re Harry Potter, and even if she loves you, she really does, you’re better in society than Neville.”
“My papa mated with my mother, who wasn’t a wolf.  That is a lie you built for yourself, Lavender.  Please let me go.”
“Go to the village.  The have a lovely little pub and most of the townsfolk are nice, hardly anyone too clingy.”
Harry pulled back and sat in a chair on the other side of the professor’s desk.  The wolf patiently waited for his cub to say what was bothering him.  After a bit, Harry let it out.  He told him about the dream and the confusing thoughts he was now having.  Draco not really knowing what it could mean either.  Both boys were at a loss, and the marauder listened.  He had an idea, but it couldn’t be possible.  It was something Charlus had with James, but with James being dead, there was no way Harry could do it.  He saw Harry looking at him, wanting his father to tell him he wasn’t crazy.
He smiled because of the anger in the darker man’s eyes and how Harry described Draco in bed.  Most was lies, of course, because it wasn’t really anyone’s business.  However, he made Draco sound good.  Harry could feel himself getting tired now that his body was aware of the little one growing inside him, so he leaned on his boyfriend.  Draco smiled, keeping conversation with Theo about potions, and wrapped Harry up in him.  He helped Harry lay down, the Gryffindor’s head in his lap, and started playing with his hair as Harry drifted off.
Harry looked at his friend, hoping she’d help them.  Hermione sat for a moment, taking in what the man was asking her.  She was a little surprised he used her first name and made a compliment about her intelligence.  She glanced at Ron, who was gaping at the Slytherin, obviously just as surprised.  She then glanced back at Harry and Draco.  She noticed Harry smiling encouragingly and smiled back.
Harry looked and sure enough it was the hallows symbol in the cloud.  He looked back to the men, one winking this time and figured it out.
Harry watched as Draco thought on his suggestion, hoping he’d listen to what Harry was trying to say.  Harry watched as Draco smiled, just a small smile, and kissed Harry’s lips.
Harry took in a deep breath and let it out.  “Yes.  A part of the bearer thing led us to a hidden room here at Hogwarts.  Our headmaster kept my father chained and raped him repeatedly for the last 16 years.  Hermione, of course, figured out where the room was.  Papa and Padfoot were close behind her though.  They used the room when they were here for things pertaining to the moon cycle.”
Remus turned his head, watching his mate pad his way down the hall, almost silent in the waking hours of the morning.
“I can’t tell everything, not yet.  However, you told me something personal, so I can as well.  My life wasn’t sunshine and roses, Draco.  Vernon Dursley was very abusive.  Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Remus, well...they don’t even know all of it.  Dudley, my cousin, was a bully.  That was part of why I didn’t shake your hand in first year, you reminded of him.”
They both laid down and just rested.  Draco didn’t fall asleep as Harry’s heat wouldn’t let him, but eventually they both wore out and sleep finally came to both of them.
“I think you both should just go with the flow.  Draco, you are both very powerful. No, hear me out, ok.  Just get in the moment, make it special.  I’m not saying flowers and candles if that’s not for you, but just get into it.  It’ll happen when it’s right and you both will know.  I get you’re nervous, but you know he’s more so, right?  I mean the last time, someone hurt you.  Why doesn’t he bottom, though?”  Pansy asked as they sat in Draco and Harry’s room.
They all looked at the werewolf, trying to see how he would respond to the help he wasn’t used to getting.  Remus was a bit speechless.  He had always joked with Sirius and James about a clinic, but having Hermione wanting to do one with him...well, he didn’t really know what to say.  He looked at each individual sitting at the table with him and they him, and smiled.
"Mother's we know. That's where Severus comes in. He didn't know which one was the other father, I assume he had a guess, but never asked. He had his healer license and was just as good as Lily in Potions. He delivered you and then he and Lily put a heavy glamour on you so that everyone would think she was your mum." Sirius explained, hoping Harry could process it alright.
Sorry about the delay.  I just haven't been into it, to tell you the truth.  I have never abandoned a story though and I am trying to get through this one!  I don't think there is much left since Harry's pregnant now though!  Thanks for sticking with me!
Everyone turned around to see Lavender standing in the archway to the dorm rooms.  Draco kept his fingers in his boyfriend’s hair and simply raised his left eyebrow in question, not giving her the satisfaction of answering her.  The rest of the room looked from the boys at the end of the couch to the girl on the other side of the room.  They had all heard her talking about the two, knew she was going to be on the receiving end of one, if not both of them.  Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter alone were powerful, put them together and they were unstoppable.  Pansy and Theo knew the rumors were false; they didn’t know what had made the relationship escalate as fast as it did, but they knew when Harry trusted them enough, Draco would tell them.
As they stepped through the floo, they noticed Narcissa and Draco standing up to greet them.  Harry for one, noticed his new friend wearing a pair of muggle jeans and had to hide the sounds he wanted to make.  The denim definitely worked for the young blonde and Harry hid a bit behind his father to hide just how much he liked them.  The older two smiled to themselves as they greeted the Malfoy’s.  Narcissa gestured for them to take seats, sitting on the loveseat herself.  Draco took to a chair while their guests all sat on the slightly larger couch.
Draco nodded and gave Harry a small kiss.  “Thank you for telling me.  I think we should make a rule or two.  The dominant part of me is reaching out to the part Wea-Ron’s mum opened.  What do you think?”
Sirius kept his eye on Harry, and Harry furrowed his brow.  He knew there was a meaning in that, but didn’t quite know what it meant.
Harry looked at everyone, seeing the worry and concern on everyone’s face.  He didn’t know what just happened, but wanted to discuss with Hermione, Draco, and Ron first.
Harry nodded.  “Yes.  And not just because of my feelings.  Besides, Hermione would be the only other who would probably be able to do this, and I don’t want to ask her.  I know she’d come back to help me, but she’s helped enough.  She needs to do what she’s doing for herself, and her parents.  I couldn’t ask her to abandon it.”
Draco woke up to the sound of the shower and glanced at the clock on their nightstand.  He sighed as it read 6:00 am, on a Saturday.  These dreams were really getting to Harry.  Whatever it was, was now trying to get a message to Sirius and Remus.  Draco couldn’t help but worry.  Especially since Harry had told him the messages used his parent’s nicknames from school.  He and Hermione had stayed in the library researching while Ron took Harry to fly last night and the only thing they came up with was what they already knew.  One- they were using the unused area of the school, which may be why Harry’s having these strange dreams, and two-the only person Harry should have this kind of connection to was his father.
His son looked at him with his emerald eyes begging him to agree with him.  Remus sighed and turned off the stove, knowing Harry needed his attention.  He leaned on the counter and folded his arms to help keep him in place.
Holding himself on one arm, Draco slowly ran his fingers over the chest under him, letting Harry get used to him.  The body under him was moving beautifully and Draco was hoping to take it up a notch.  He moved his lips, tailing kisses down his mate’s jaw.
He opened the closet and saw some denim. He pulled them out and smiled, "Bellbottoms." He chuckled a bit and found an old band shirt with the name of some band he didn't know. He then went to the dresser and found some socks, no shorts or any type of underwear, but he was fine with that. Sometimes he didn't wear it anyway, especially if these fit like they did on the guys from those old shows Petunia watched, he thought as he walked out to find the shower. He found it in the room next to his and sighed. He started the water and did his business before walking under the spray. The water felt so good after being used to cold water of whatever river they found while on the run. He didn't know how long he stayed in the water, but his hair was washed twice, his body three times. He could practically feel the dirt and grime wash away. Harry turned the water off and found a towel in the small cabinet above the toilet. Wrapping it around his waist, he swiped the condensation off the mirror and picked up his wand, wanting to get some of the stubble off his face. He smiled when he started to look like himself, well a cleaner Harry anyway. He finished drying off and pulled the jeans up before pulling the tee over his head.
Harry turned to look at her.  “I have the cloak in my trunk.  If my dad is in there, shouldn’t our family magic be enough?  We were descended from Ignotus.”
The sound of the door bursting open caused the men to jump and see Ginny storm out of the house.  She stopped when she saw the new guests with her brothers and Neville.  She gave each new man a hug and then grabbed her boyfriend, taking off with him.  The others sighed and decided to head in before they got yelled yet for not alerting Molly to their presence.  Harry walked in behind his guardians, wanting to prolong his presence due to the argument they overheard.  Molly noticed them, giving each man a hug, she let them know lunch was almost ready and the others were somewhere in the house.  She didn’t mention the argument and the three men didn’t say they heard it.
“Sirius said the same thing, but red hair’s not my type.  Not to mention I don’t want to leave England.”  Harry stated.
Harry smiled.  “Yes.  There’s things he still needs to know, but yes.  I’m falling in love with him, Ron.  I think he loves me too.  We just haven’t said anything.”
A breath left her as she looked at the young man in front of her. "A son being forced to do his father's will is a lot more innocent apparently, Harry."
Remus felt helpless, not knowing how to help his son.  He also knew Sirius was right, he wasn’t sleeping much better with Harry not sleeping and so nodded, getting up to take a quick shower.  Sirius pulled Harry up and took him to his room.
The rest of the year came in as they saw Harry Potter hit a wall by a bookshelf and fall unconscious.  Draco saw nothing but Harry as he ran to the boy he loved.  He got down and heard someone say something about someone else, not that he cared.
Draco chuckled and leaned down to touch his lips to Harry’s.  Harry kissed the blond man back, letting him dominate the kiss.  Draco rolled them till he was laying half his body on the man under him.  Harry moved his arms so his fingers could tangle in the blond hair of his boyfriend, a small moan leaving his mouth as Draco moved in, deepening the kiss with his tongue.  Harry couldn’t believe how it took this long to get to this point.  It seemed both were fighting this for so long because of duty, and the stress of that leaving let them be who they were meant to.  Both boys moved till the slightly older one was being cradled in the younger's hips, Harry’s legs spread just enough for it to be comfortable. Just as both boys were getting into it, someone cleared their throat, making Draco jump and cover Harry.
He found both men sitting on the couch, their hair also wet from a shower. Harry just didn't care to know how they both got finished so fast. Remus gestured to the chair across from them and he sat down. The three sat in silence, two not knowing how to say what needed to be said. Harry watched as Sirius took Remus' hand and leaned a bit to whisper something. Remus turned his head and closed his eyes, letting the other man release the tension in his muscles. Harry watched, hoping he could find something like that one day. Someone who could just calm him with a touch, a smile, anything. Remus and Sirius looked back at Harry and the younger of the three waited patiently.
Draco just held Harry as James gave the explanation.  He already knew he wasn’t able to stay away, it’s why he was going to sneak back in.  What he didn’t know was more family history.  His father had a lot to tell him about the reason the Malfoy’s were the way they were.  Draco also knew he was going to find a retraction of the potion, letting the heir choose to carry or not.  It may take his whole life, but he felt like he was the one who was meant to.
Harry shifted as a smell of something delicious invaded his senses. He blinked his eyes open and it took him a second to realize where he was. He sat up and found that someone had pulled his shoes off and pulled the comforter over him. He ran his hand over the green material, feeling the softness of it. He looked around and saw the light maple furniture that completed the green quite nicely. He liked this room. The floor was a darker wood, but he couldn't tell what kind it was, but it flowed to match the hallway. He got up and decided to figure out where the smell was. The sunlight was glistening in the room between ivory curtains that matched the accents of the rooms and Harry smiled. He pulled his glasses back on, finding them on the table next to him, and made his way out of the room. He retraced his steps and found Remus in the kitchen.
Harry finds out another part of the family secret and a once enemy finds out some truths about himself
“He isn’t yours, Remus.  You and Sirius need to teach him.  He’s not yours.  He’s James and Lily’s.  They are gone and a mother needs to show him, a father needs to guide him.  Arthur and I can do that.”
Everyone looked at Fleur and got up to congratulate the couple.  When Fleur hugged Harry, she whispered.  “You will make a great daddy, Draco as well.”
Harry sighed.  “I need you to decipher them.  Hermione’s out of the country with Ron, but I would have asked for you to help anyway.  Severus taught you everything, and I really need to know what’s in his notes and if you think it can be accomplished.”
Harry looked at the man sitting next to him and then at the plate Remus sat in front of him.  Narcissa Malfoy had the family secret all this time.  Severus must have trusted her a lot to know she would keep them safe, but not understand them to the point Voldemort would figure them out.  He looked back at Sirius.  “What was in them?”
Draco nodded and turned to Remus.  “So with what the muggles did to Harry, he’s going to be more submissive.  Will he not be Harry?”
The blonde nodded and looked over at Harry.  “What I said earlier, I meant it.  I’m sorry.  I want to apologize to Granger and Weasley as well.  Growing up as I did, learning things, feeling things, well...it was hard to come to terms with some of it.  I took it out on you three, thinking you had it so much easier.  Learning that wasn’t the case, seeing you at that battle, well...it didn’t set with me that if you died. I couldn’t apologize to you.  Is there anyway, anyway at all, we can start over?”
Harry could see this was scaring Draco just as much.  He pulled the blonde into his hands and wrapped his arms around him.  The slytherin let out a breath and wrapped his arms around Harry, kissing his forehead.  Neither boy said anything, just content to be close to each other.  A knock sounded on the door, Hermione’s voice letting them know they were heading to the hall for breakfast.  Both boys pulled back, kissing lightly, before Draco took Harry’s hand, leading them both out for breakfast with their bags on their shoulder.
Harry smiled, not having thought of that.  “Do you think he’d get Minerva to let us share?  I don’t know if we could be apart, even if in the same building.”
