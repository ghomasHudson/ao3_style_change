Harry had no sense of time, though. He didn’t know what time of day it was. He heard the door open but didn’t let it bother him, turning to lie on his side. He had been on the bed for about sixteen hours. But he hadn’t had even an ounce of sleep.
Draco bit his lip, his eyebrows furrowed. It took a lot for him to not stand up and go after Harry, but he knew that would make things worse. It would make everything so much harder.
“Harry, it’s not that bad-”
“Harry!” Hermione hissed when several people turned to Harry at the mention of Death Eaters. “Besides, he’s only sixteen! He’s underage. Surely You-Know-Who would think he’s too young. I really think you should let it go, Harry.”
“Don’t worry about what everyone thinks,” Hermione told him. “You’ll always have us. Oh, by the way, the package from my parents finally arrived.” She handed Harry a small package. Ron watched in disappointment.
Harry turned around and rolled his eyes at Draco. “Shut up Malfoy, it was an accident.”
“Seriously? So I finally agree to a dog and you push the limit that way? I might just go out and, I dunno, buy a ferret?”
“Oh,” Draco cleared his throat awkwardly. “I… didn’t think you would care. I’ve just been sick. Besides, haven’t I written you enough poems already?”
“Honestly, Parkinson, the difference between you and your family really appalls me. What in Merlin’s beard is that supposed to mean?” He folded his arms.
“Please. Take your time with your answer. But… don’t say no yet. Please.”
Ginny came running down from the kitchen. “Mum, I mucked up the dessert- Harry!”
“Did you two break up?”
“Harry…”
“No, I’m telling you, it’s blue!”
“I understand. I’ll owl you?”
“We need you to see if the person we just caught is Harry Potter or not.”
Draco picked up the other one and took Harry’s left hand, putting it on his ring finger, lifting his hand to his face and kissing it gently. “I love you, Harry,” He whispered, starting to play with Harry’s fingers as he started to feel slightly embarrassed.
“You mean cons of not shaking my hand in first year,” Draco said with an eye roll.
broke up with me when things got too complicated. How can I forgive that? The way he left me in the dust, making me think that I was the problem?”
Draco opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
“Draco,” Harry said calmly, “Is he always like that?”
Draco undid the spell for the locked door and finally opened it. As Harry heard the door swing open behind him, he turned to face Draco, a slight smile on his face, standing up so he could face him properly. “You finally opened the goddamn-”
“She’s right. You’re not. We’re just worried about you,” she answered.
The room expanded and Harry got his wand ready. It had been two months since he had been practicing duelling without his hearing aids, and he felt more comfortable already, but that was because he knew Draco was deliberately trying to take it easy on him. Well, that was the price for being taught by your boyfriend.
“It seemed pretty
Completely against each other.
“You’re being stupid,” Draco scolded. “How hard is it to remember the ingredients? Tell me. What ingredients do you need for a Wit-Sharpening potion?”

“Did you talk to Malfoy?” she asked.
“Alright, if you say so…” she said. “Sorry for prying. I’m-”
be worse, right? I’m the one with dead parents.”
“Are you kidding? With Ron and Hermione as friends, I don’t know why I didn’t go sooner. All they did was treat me like glass. Besides…” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “at least in America I don’t have to see your face on the newspaper.”
“When was the last time you used the medicine?” Harry asked, eyeing the jar. Draco sighed.
“Yes, Mother knows, but uh, Father doesn’t quite know-”
“This is the only place we can hang out freely without people catching us,” Harry said with an eye roll. “I mean, we could use the Room of Requirement but I haven’t been able to get the room in a while.”
Hermione entered Harry’s room,  eyebrows creased when she noticed him in bed, staring at the letter. “Harry, it’s noon! Today is…” she stopped when she saw the owl.
“Got another Muggle game for you to cheat on?”
“You know what?” Draco stopped narrating suddenly, shutting the book. “I think I became the one thing I swore not to.”
p.s. thank you all for the love and support. It really boosts my confidence and gives me inspiration to write.
No one said anything, which just made Harry feel even worse. Draco gently squeezed Harry’s hand again, giving him a reassuring look as he pulled Harry close to him, wrapping his arms around him. Harry slowly crawled onto Draco’s lap, resting his head on his chest.
“Potter,” Draco said as he passed him just outside the Great Hall. “Ready for another year of being behind everyone else?”
Draco, who had been trying to avoid this very situation, embarrassedly pulled his hand away, taking off his robe and putting it to the side. He cleared his throat then nodded. “...right, the next ingredient?” he asked, lowering his hand and trying to hide it.
“Hey,” Harry greeted as he entered the living room, seeing Molly and Draco talking.
“Hey, I told you what I think it is. Not my fault that you think it’s bloody stupid.”
Harry didn’t recall hearing anyone calling him earlier in the day. But then again, he wasn’t exactly paying attention to what was around him.
Harry flinched at the mention of his name. “Nothing.”
“Well, then, rule seven: you need to start actually combing your hair. I mean, what the hell is this, Potter?”
Harry was Draco’s. Draco was Harry’s.
Okay, it was normal for Harry to move on, so why did Draco feel like the walls were closing in on him?
“You literally show up in the Daily Prophet every week. You’re not a topic of conversation because of me,” he said quickly, rolling his eyes.
“We’re fine if we keep a distance, Weasley!”
“It went really well, didn’t it?” Pansy asked with a smirk.
He stood up slightly, leaning forward and smacking Harry lightly with his book, trying to hold back a smile. “I know,” he sat back down. “Here,” he handed Harry the quill. “Writing helps you remember better. Write down the ingredients needed at least five times.”
“N-no, it’s just… today’s…” Harry chewed on his bottom lip - he felt stupid for feeling this way. But he had a right to, didn’t he? They were his parents, after all. He had a right to feel sad over their death. “Today’s… today’s my parent’s-”
“You are?” Draco asked, turning his head so he was staring up at the ceiling, too afraid to look into his eyes now. His heart was thumping.
“Yes.” Draco and Harry said at the same time, cutting Ron off, before turning back to each other. “I don’t know… I do think it’s a good idea to go home for Christmas, but I don’t think I can stay at Malfoy Manor for the whole-”
********
Draco tried not to let his irritation get the best of him. “Would you like me to demonstrate, then?”
“Then why did you even kiss her back?” Ron asked.
, better, and no, not
“Shut up, Potter! As if yours looks any better!”
“Worth the risk,” Harry echoed, nodding, as if he understood now. He reached into his pocket, taking out a small box and slamming it on the desk forcefully. “No, I suppose it’s not.”
“Draco-”
“Okay. I’m sorry for pushing you. Rule five: don’t ask me about my family or any Death Eater stuff.”
Hermione nodded. “Okay. Try them whenever you feel ready.”
“No, no. no. Draco, stop. You’re spiralling.”
“Same, mate, same,” Ron called out from his bed as he slowly sat up too. Harry and Ron turned to face each other, both massaging their temples in an attempt to get rid of the pounding headache the two were getting.
“I mean, do you honestly believe he’s
“Very funny,” Harry folded his arms, pushing his glasses into place. He had slowed his pace. The sun was starting to set and they were making their way back to the train station. Their last date was coming to an end.
“And I’m trying really hard not to punch you in the face right now,” Harry replied. Both Ron and Hermione tugged at him. Gulping, he looked over to Draco, who seemed to be apologetically staring at him.
Harry Potter.” He added in an attempt to slightly lighten the mood.
“Don’t go-”
“Harry? We’re going to eat dinner now.”
********
It was now only two of them in a room, and she was crying. He frowned. “Are you alright?”
hope you enjoy this chapter. happy reading!
“We both know I have too much pride for that.” pointed out Draco, to which Harry nodded at, agreeing.
, sending Harry flying against the bookshelf behind him.
Because though meant it, he knew he wasn’t being loyal. He had no choice but to lie to the one person he trusted the most.
Draco would mostly stay in his room or go drinking with Pansy, but even the bitter taste of the alcohol couldn’t drown out his feelings. She would place a comforting, gentle hand on his shoulder, offer him more alcohol, drop him off at home when he got too drunk.
Draco let out a laugh. “You and me?”
“You’re perfectly good at getting on my nerves.”
“There are only three ingredients,” he folded his arms. “Come on! What about the Invigoration Draught?”
“Shh,” Draco put a finger to her lips, keeping his eyes on the jewelry in front of him. “I need to get him something special. I want him to know how I feel. So I need it to be perfect.”
“Harry, look,” Hermione said. “Harry. Look at me,” she said sharply. Harry slowly turned to face her.
“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” Lucius was saying.
“We don’t know if it’d work for me, and I don’t want to try. I don’t want to for sure that I can never hear again. That I can’t hear your voice.”
“Fuck you,” he set his cards down, folding his arms. “This is the fifth time in a row you’ve won. You’re definitely cheating!” he exclaimed.
“Luna, not you too!” Harry groaned. His face was flushed as he lifted his legs, wailing slightly in embarrassment, leaning on Draco.

Draco slowed down his quick scribbling, then nodded. “Yes, I remember. We can… do a late lunch? Here?”
“Oh, Astoria, we better get going to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner,” Pansy said, turning to Draco, a concerned look on her face. It was rare for her to show it so clearly, but seemed that as the months passed, she was too worried about him to care. “Are you sure you don’t want to join us, Draco?”
He threw his hands in the air, shaking his head. “Back to my dorm. I don’t want to be around you right now.”
?” Pansy said, cutting him off, staring at him intently.
“The part where you said you liked me in spite of that. The part where you told me I was worth risking all of that. The part where I thought you
“Medicine?” Snape asked questioningly. “Is he still not recovered?”
“You weren’t following Draco, were you?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron. Harry choked on his bite of food, having to cough it all out, loudly too.
“How do you know?” Harry blurted, he couldn’t keep in his nervousness inside.
“We have tried to the best of our capabilities to make all of your classes easier for you,” Professor McGonagall said. Harry looked over to Hermione who was signing what McGonagall was saying. “Most of the teachers will write down anything important on the board for you. If you are having any difficulty with keeping up with the classes, please come to Dumbledore or myself.”
Why did his heart beat abnormally fast every time they touched, why did he find himself aching for more? He was Draco Malfoy and he was Harry Potter. They weren’t supposed to be friends, let alone…
On Friday morning, Harry woke up after a rough night. He hadn’t been able to fall asleep. There were too many thoughts circling in his mind. It was hard to do anything this past week.
“Harry,” Draco said breathlessly, panting heavily. Draco's silver eyes were glistening with tears, the brown streak in his hair shining, pushing his trunk to the side and practically running to Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
Somewhere along the tangents in his mind, he had managed to leave the windowsill and snuggled into bed, eventually falling asleep. His thoughts had been racing more than ever lately, and he wondered if it was the stress from Voldemort or his incapability of trusting his own boyfriend. Well, that was a relative term now.
“It’s not like I’d be walking into anything spicy,” she snorted.
But nothing helped Harry’s fever. Not even a strong potion that Madame Pomfrey requested Slughorn to make for him.
Draco nodded slowly. His mother turned and left. Then he lied back down on his bed and turned over, scoffing at the idea of sending Harry a letter.
He was absolutely worried sick, and he completely blamed himself. After all, it was his fault. His fault for lying, betraying, and breaking Harry.
“What did you say?” Ron called out.
Putting it closer to his ear, he quickly put it back in its case, shaking his head. “Maybe later…”
But I'm back, and with more drarry stuff to write ;)
Harry blinked in confusion. “Why?”
“Harry!” Draco whined with an eye roll as he balanced himself and wrapped his arms around Harry so he wouldn’t fall. “Give me a warning next time!”
When Harry woke the next day, it was his turn to be frantic. He sat on the bed as Draco entered the room, handing Harry a cup of coffee.
Needless to say, Draco was beyond frantic.
Merry (late, I know) Christmas! And Happy New Year's Eve - it's literally 2 in the morning as I post this, I hope you guys are grateful for how late I stay up to finish chapters :(
“We’re like… acquaintances, but not quite, you know?” Draco answered absentmindedly. Harry looked at him a bit strangely and he gulped. “I just mean… I wouldn’t treat you like an enemy anymore. It’d be like going back to square one. And while I don’t think you’d ever want to be friends with me, I’d like to think that we’re on neutral terms now.”
“Harry, don’t take me for a fool,” Hermione assured him. “When you wake up tomorrow morning, you’re letting me know what happened.”
When Dobby had Apparated Harry and Ron out of the cellar, Harry went running towards Draco, tackling him to the ground.
By this time Draco had rolled up his shirt sleeve, so the two stood up hastily. Draco realized that he better pass a snarky comment to make it seem normal, as Hermione and Ron was glancing over at him with surprise on their faces.
“Yeah, sure,” he nodded. “She’s still worried about you, you know. Maybe if you tell her you have a girlfriend, it’ll ease her up a bit.”
“I’m sure you did,” he mumbled, taking in a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. “I’m sorry. I’ve been holding back a lot of emotions. It’s not you. It’s just… everything.”
“You can’t just… say that and expect me to behave normally!”
lying. If you can’t accept that, please whine about it to someone who actually cares. Seriously, learning sign language? You’re such a pathetic git.”
“Ah yes,” Draco said as he quickly got out his quill and ink, “dinner with the Dark Lord and the Greengrass’s. Quite fun. It’s for sure going to be a party in here!”
“I’m sorry for calling you a ‘stupid rich daddy’s little boy’ earlier this morning…”
Someone lightly knocked on the door to Draco’s room. “Draco? I need to talk to you,” said Narcissa as she slowly entered. She was holding a book. She carefully shut the door behind her, frowning at Draco. “Why are you sitting on the floor when you’ve got a perfectly good chair over there?” She asked, gesturing to the chair beside him.
Walking over, Harry tapped him on the shoulder, then signed, ‘what are you doing?’. Draco stared at him for a few moments, hiding whatever was in his hands under the table. Harry stared at him expectantly.
“Yes, I know. But Draco, why is it still hurting? Is it hurting right now?”
“Hey, so,” Draco said as Harry was gathering his stuff, “Do you want me to help you with Potions or something tomorrow?”
“Hey, hey,” Draco whispered, removing Harry’s glasses and wiping his tears away, cupping his cheeks, “I forgive you, okay? Besides, it was mostly my fault-”
“Draco, your idea of being mean is jumping down a tree and telling people how you bet on them with your father.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, snapping him out of his thoughts. “Did you hear me?”
“Blaise is right, you know,” he spoke finally. “I don’t know how I expected to get by this year. I’m already falling behind in Potions. I feel like Snape is purposely going faster than usual this year, just to see me suffer.”
“A wonderful anniversary, isn’t it?” Harry said. Draco gave him a blank expression. “Oh, come on. Don’t be like that. I know none of this is your fault.”
Harry gently pressed his index finger against Draco’s nose. “You should’ve seen the look on your face!”
A confused Harry turned to look at Draco who seemed just as confused as he was. Harry quickly gathered his stuff and made his way to Pansy.
“Yeah, I’m sure. Let me just not finish my education, that’s doing what’s best for me,” said Draco sarcastically.
Harry took in a deep breath, swallowing what felt like a rock in his throat. “I just want to help you,” He whispered softly, his eyes getting welled up as he got more frustrated. “Please, Draco, just let me.”
She looked over to Ron, who seemed just as confused. “Okay, so,” she moved away from the door, “there’s this legend in the Wizarding World that… some people have soulmates… and it can be found in different ways… like… the hair,” she pointed to his faded streak.
Harry slowly stepped closer to Draco. “You do realize, that if you had just told me from the beginning, everything would have been okay?”
“You’re right,” he answered. “I’m not. I don’t really intend to be one tonight, either.”
They stood there for a moment, Harry clinging gently to Draco’s shirt, digging his feet into the ground as if something would root him in his spot.
********
“Tired,” Harry mumbled, walking straight ahead.
“Harry, Harry,” Draco whispered when he noticed Harry groaning slightly in his sleep, sitting up. “Harry, wake up, it’s just a dream-”
“I know but… I couldn’t bring myself to it.” Draco said with a sigh, placing his head on Harry’s chest. “I’m on your side okay? Even if I have to lie about which side I’m on. I’m always on your side, the good side.”
“You won’t leave me, right?”
“Of course. Anyway,” she fumed, continuing to sign, “what is the reason behind this? This is the third time this week I have heard of a commotion between you two. It has come to my attention that it has been because of you, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry watched him leave, finding himself almost mesmerized by his every move. Draco moved so effortlessly. Even if he wasn’t, with his confidence, you’d think he’s the most handsome person in the room. Well, it was hard to be in a room where someone was more attractive than Draco.
Draco felt his Dark Mark sting. He looked away from Harry, biting his lip. Draco knew very well that it was his fault. And that it was his fault for getting him worked up now. But let’s face it, once Harry’s worked up, there’s no point in trying to calm him until he’s said what he’s needed to.
(See the end of the chapter for
Snape knew.
“I understand if you’re upset, or even if you hate me. I just… I wanted one last date with you. We don’t have to talk ever again if that’s what you want. But today I’m asking for one last time.”
Draco looked over to Astoria, who simply just laughed, taking a sip from her champagne, amused by his panicked expression. “Will she ever stop teasing you about him?”
“I wanted to see you,” Harry mumbled, “I never get to see you anymore.”
“Oh, should I have knocked?” Narcissa asked.
“N-no,” Harry whispered, “I didn’t- I… Fuck, I…” Harry looked away, unable to stare at the scars anymore, his eyes glistening with tears. “No, I…”
“What?”
“I did!”
She smiled at him, the exhaustion in her eyes clear. “I’m alright. I’m sure you got the letter from your father… that I can’t hear at all anymore.”
“I’ll think about it,” Draco sighed, chewing on his lip. “I know I wasn’t exactly the nicest either, but… I need to think about it.”
In the depths of the Slytherin dorm rooms, Draco was, despite his best attempts, unable to sleep. Checking the watch on his bedside table, he stared in disbelief. It was only midnight - he had been trying to sleep for what felt like hours. Removing the covers off of him, he picked up a sweater that he knew belonged to Harry, but made no effort to think back to when he could have possibly taken it by accident, perhaps on one of their Saturdays (or Saturdates as Harry called it once, and was given the silent treatment for the next twenty minutes).
“Great. Take them off.”
“The silk ones?” Hermione asked carefully, knowing fully that the silk ones belonged to Draco.
But they, of course, had to be cautious about it.
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hands, surprised to see no ring on his finger. “Uh… you said no? Even though he wants you back?”
Harry stopped right in front of the doors of the Great Hall. “You know, I’m not all that hungry-”
“Just enter,” Harry said. He looked around before quickly opening the door and entering. Draco hesitantly followed, looking around to see a somewhat empty room. “This is the Room of Requirement.”
“You know what I think, Draco?” Harry said against Draco’s lips. “I think you secretly wanted the sappy romantic things.”
Sometime in January, Draco was writing what may have been his thirtieth letter. He had forced himself to stop during October and November and started again on the first of January.
Harry blinked in confusion, adjusting his glasses. “So there’s no old relative that came to stay with you?” he asked. Draco shook his head. “Oh, Draco,” his voice was soft. He put his arm around Draco, who leaned his head on his shoulder.
"By rendering you mute, yes," Draco said wryly, nodding his head in mock-understanding.
Harry noted that Draco and Severus seemed to have that in common, a penchant for threats of physical incapacitation.
Draco felt a chill run down his body. He had already thought of a similar idea. He could still remember Voldemort's words.
Draco winced. "Is he… Is he mad?"
Harry grinned. “Don’t have to.”
He hurried his swimming. A part of him was ecstatic at the feeling of gliding through the water effortlessly and breathing as if he was above ground. Maybe he could steal some gillyweed from Snape's stocks in the Manor during the summer. But another part of him wanted this over with, because there were dubious creatures all around him, creatures that he was pretty sure would attack if he came near enough –
He had thrown the words out without caution to the wind, but if he really sat down and think about it… he knew that the option was still open within him. In his head, he had a plan—trying everything else. Try everything possible under the sun, but if… If nothing worked and
All around him were kids wearing the same robes as he was and parents who fussed about the imaginary speck of dust on their children’s faces. Suddenly, he felt a spike of anxiety course through him, fear of this big new adventure ahead of him. What if the other kids didn’t like him? What if studying in Hogwarts was hard? What if the things about magic that Remus taught him wasn’t enough?
“Severus! Why didn’t you tell me that you’ve been keeping that
Did he perhaps ask an unnecessary question?
He looked tired.
Draco stepped aside for Harry to push the door open and leaned against the wall beside the door frame. He slid down to the floor and curled his knees to his chest, pouting petulantly at the floor.
Cheers erupted from the whole household.
Draco opened his mouth to say something more, but then seemed to think better of it and simply closed it, reaching for one of the glasses of pumpkin juice. "Good luck then, Potter," he said instead, returning to his book.
Harry hurriedly walked away.
He glanced at Malfoy’s face carefully. “Will you be alright?”
But Draco knew that Potter was here somewhere.
“Bad dream again?” Theodore asked, his voice going soft.
Draco's eyes were open, staring at him in shock. Blood seeped through his fingers and his lips, and as he spoke, blood splattered all over Harry's cloak and face. "
Malfoy nodded in satisfaction. Then, he turned his eyes back forward, pointed his wand, and said:
He'd think about just kissing Malfoy to get it over
This was
When they reached the clearing, Harry felt his breath stop as the memory came back to him.
Almost as soon as she walked away, Draco lay back on his bed, pulled the covers up to his shoulders and turned on the bed so that his back was facing Harry.
"Has Pomfrey already checked on you?" his mother asked, but did not let him go.
of all people.) had.
Harry rolled his eyes at Theodore’s sarcasm and then winced because the movement caused his head to throb again. “I’ll finish it tonight.”
Then, curiosity piqued, he ran out of the living room and straight upstairs to his room.
And then the man was making that shocked face again that quickly transformed into a scary one. The same thing happened last night when they first arrived in this place and Snape had shown him to his room.
Lucius' voice rose behind her warningly. "Narcissa, we've talked about this."
And he will.
“We’re giving you food and shelter, boy!” Her husband had snarled at the cowering five-year-old boy. “Least you could do is weed the garden!”
is staring at the floor and he’s just looking through their eyes. And then after that, it goes black all over, and he doesn’t know how much time passes until the next time he sees the floor again, but it’s darker now, and in one corner of his mind, it registers that oh, it’s already night time.
Harry's throat constricted painfully. He wasn't sure if it was at the thought of Pansy and Draco being

he’s really Sirius, Remus.”
Harry feels victorious.
"The cat's a male," Harry muttered defensively.
Draco scowled, and let out the tantrum that he had been suppressing for the past days. He stomped forward, each stomp punctuated with a word, until he was close enough to reach Potter's collar and pull him close.
look awful.
Harry laughs then, a sudden, surprised bark of laughter. There is warmth spreading in his belly at the thought of Draco thinking of him. “That’s because you don’t eat them. It’s a waste.”
Harry threw a galleon at Theodore's way before he had the chance to gloat.
“Come on, kiddo,” Sirius said three days later as he emerged from the Floo of Snape Manor. “Moony’s already in Diagon Alley waiting for us. Snivellus isn’t here?”
Draco’s voice is light and amused. "Did you think that I was going to throw a fit because you missed Christmas Eve with me?"
And now Draco Malfoy losing his mind in Azkaban.
“Do you miss him?” Harry asked.
The thing was, how was he supposed to get the blasted Jinx off him? Ginny was still back in the Great Hall and Harry really didn't want to entertain the thought of begging her. Kissing Malfoy was, of course, not a choice. There
he didn't get detention for ruining the castle or endangering a mystical creature.

Beside the mess, the cat, with its shoulders tucked in and its eyes closed with a pleased expression, was sitting on a photograph – one that Harry recognized immediately, even if one edge of it was all that he saw.

“Reading?”
But those are the moments that Harry looks forward to the most, humbled by the trust he’s being given.
"Alright, now that I've apologized and stuff," Ron said, grinning widely with mischief. "Who's the lucky girl?"
he reminded himself. This is it. This is what they were here for, to get rid of Voldemort
But this meant there was only one horcrux left.

thanked the heavens for Voldemort’s hubris.
Draco matches his glare with his own. “I’m not lying.”
“There’s been some research in the healing industry about magic extraction,” Hermione said. “It’s different from magic nullification or magic reversal or even magic destruction. It started in the underworld, I believe, because of the frequency that Dark Wizards used curses on each other. These curses were often body-debilitating curses or magic-sapping curses, very potent ones that had dire consequences on the body the moment it even touched you. That’s why
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, his back straight and stiff. Once in a while he'd shift, always with a wince.
This time, it was Potter who was surprised.
"Thank you, Severus," he murmured earnestly, pretty sure even his ears were red now. "I'll do my best."
He never could remember that part properly, but mostly, he just remembered the blood.
Harry grins. He missed this—this light, easy banter. He pulls up Draco’s chair and sits himself down comfortably.
Harry grins at him. “See? I would have been a great Slytherin.”
Harry couldn't help looking back at Draco in incredulity. "We're only talking about
Harry subtly sneaked a glance behind his shoulder and was surprised to see Astoria by the edge of the dance floor, loyally tracking him and Pansy as they moved from one place to another. Astoria had the face of a predator seeking out her prey. Her soft brown hair arranged into ringlets were also very, very pretty.
Again, Harry's body was moving before his mind knew what he was doing.
As for him, he spent the hours away in front of the fireplace, biting his nails, pacing, keeping his hands from trembling. He was
Harry yearned with all his heart that Draco would look at
Was this perhaps the cause of Potter’s lack of sleep? His recent sullen disposition? The way he would sometimes get lost in thought?
Satisfied, Snape nodded at the two boys. “Harry, show Draco around. I have work to do. Be ready for dinner at six o’clock sharp.”
he probably meant just him and his band of sentimental Gryffindors.
Ron gave him a sympathetic look, before standing up to open the door, but it burst open before he could even take a step and in came Hermione, eyebrow raised and arms akimbo.
As soon as he reached the almost empty Gryffindor common room, he was met with Hermione's raised eyebrow.
Sirius laughed so much that tears sprang to his eyes and he hugged Harry in pretty much the same way he did during the first time they met in Snape Manor.
Draco peers at him and then his book, trying to make sense of what he’s seeing. He tilts his head. Swallows. It takes a while before he talks. “What are you doing in my house again?”
"Sulking," Remus replied, chuckling. "A grown man whining about why it had to be Severus and not him under the Great Lake. I keep telling him he's a wanted fugitive in hiding for the past decade, but I suppose I'll have to try harder."
Severus shrugged. "Quite the contrary. He wanted to know if the bludger hit you, too."
“Kingsley has informed me of what needs to be done,” McGonagall said as they all walked towards the staircase leading to the castle. “Rest assured I’m keeping the students occupied, and there should be no one to bother you in the Entrance Courtyard for the next hour. And should there be a need…” She glanced at them, at Harry, and then at Malfoy.
, Harry thought, narrowing his eyes to get his vision to steady. The cat was
space. The bed was a double-sized one, although it only had one pillow. Draco kept it for himself, because he didn’t think Potter would appreciate a pillow with three days’ worth of sweat.
Harry nodded. “Aunt Petunia never let me use Dudley’s pencils, so I wanted to try drawing…” he trailed off, flushing.
Draco's quiet voice made Harry jump, both in surprise and anticipation, and he quickly moved in his chair to look behind him.
And yet there was still that nagging thought at the back of his head that told him that maybe, Mrs. Malfoy said something to Draco that made him not want to be friends with Harry anymore? What if Draco thought that he really was a monster? Even though Harry told him a lot of times that he didn’t want to suck his blood.
"You're not doing a very good job, you see," came Draco's bored drawl but Harry wasn't listening, not anymore, because his feet were taking him forward, and he rounded the corner just in time to see a burly seventh-year raise his wand in agitation and press the tip of it deep against the bruising welt on Draco's neck and Harry saw Draco's wince and heard Draco's sharp hiss and thought –
Potter peers at the letters, but they’re all folded, and so Draco hands him the nearest one, the very first one.
, but damn if he’s going to keep hanging off of Potter forever. “
His stomach growled in complaint, but he was scared to go out of the room. Scared that if he went out now, he would face the reality that Potter got his head hit by a bludger and it was all because Draco was being immature and venting out his anger on him and now Potter may not even be –
Harry grinned, feeling warmth bloom in his chest and across his cheeks. He could actually imagine Draco throwing a tantrum with his friends and demanding things.
“Extra? You stole a
He turned to Potter and grabbed his arm suddenly. "Do you also think my father is still working for the Dark Lord?"
When he arrived at the library, it was empty once again, except for a few Ravenclaw second years. They gave him no trouble though and even slinked away hurriedly when he came near. He quickly walked towards the 'J' aisle, reminding himself firmly not to be so excited.
they were still young.
Pansy articulated with a sing-song voice as she twirled them around, making sure her dress swayed with her movements. "Back to the topic. What are the chances Draco won't hex me if I snog him?"
So the boy knew.
Of course, it would be weird. That definitely had the wrong tone and context for we're-not-really-friends housemates. He turned his back to Draco, faced the shelves, and made a show of getting another jar to clean. He willed his heart down his throat and his fingers to stop shaking. "I don't know how Blaise and Pansy can handle it," he said with forced exasperation, trying to pass it off as sarcasm, hoping that Draco wouldn't think anything of it, please, please, please –
So he leaves the room, as quietly as he can, and stumbles his way to where Narcissa said the master room was.
“Wipe that snot off your face, Potter,” came a soft voice across from him.
but his friends were never very nice to Harry. Draco was the first and only person his age that he really enjoyed being around with, and Draco said they were
"I'm not a fucking charity case," he said, and it sounded broken even to his own ears.
When he arrived at the Gryffindor Table, he promptly ignored the grinning faces of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team and sat next to a sympathetic Ron and Hermione.
, was his reply.
Voldemort ignored him and turned his chilling smile to Lucius. "Is that why you have brought me your son, Lucius? To appease me?"
He shifted in his seat and extended his hand around Draco’s body towards Harry.
Once in position a good distance away from Malfoy and the staircase, Harry cast a Protego around himself and waited.
Potter’s gaze felt heavy and Draco couldn’t bring himself to meet it.
When Hermione read it, her eyes grew wide and amazed. "Harry, this is –"
It was the same sound that Draco had heard back in the Hospital Wing, when he had snuck behind Severus' back to enter Potter's hidden room.
Harry looked rather affronted.
Well, at least Ron had a good time.
“No. Absolutely not.” Draco glared, leaning forward with his hands gripping the edge of his bed. “He will turn his wand on you the moment he gets a chance.”
"Hullo, Harry," Ginny greeted him innocently as she sat down on the couch beside him in the Gryffindor Common Room.
Harry can’t stop the soft smile forming on his face then. Molly Weasley baking a pie for the Malfoy family. Draco Malfoy saying that Molly Weasley’s blueberry pie is delicious. There is warmth in his chest and it’s threatening to spill out. He thinks he might visit the Burrow tomorrow.
“So it
But still, Harry couldn't bring himself to lie.
Harry merely flashed him a goofy smile, mouthed 'good night', and hurriedly turned tail towards the Gryffindor Tower.
Severus scowled at him. "And what would you have done after you had seen him?"
Hermione and Ginny shared a curious glance, before Hermione sat down on the carpet as well, lending comfort. Even Ron gave Harry a worried look.
Maybe it was okay to be friends. It's been three years – or was it four if you count the extra year Harry spent rewriting, it was confusing – since the incident that happened in the Forbidden Forest, and Draco was alive, and Draco After the Time Turner didn't even know what Narcissa Before the Time Turner said.
Dumbledore, along with Igor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, inched closer with hands in their pockets, ready to take out their wands at a moment's notice.
When dinner rolled in, Ron proved once again why he was Harry's best mate by bringing him a tray of food in the dorms.
would have been his fourth had the Gryffindor Quidditch Team not suddenly flocked around him and proceeded to drag him towards the Hospital Wing in panic that they had done permanent damage to the Savior of the Wizarding World.
Harry wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment that Fred and George bought him during fifth year.
Draco's eyes widened in realization. So that was what Potter was vomiting. Blood had been dripping from his mouth and nose…
He didn't exactly expect them to trap him in a Full Body Bind though.
Dumbledore's voice, amplified by a Sonorus Charm, echoed around the Hall. Voices of the students grew in excitement, before settling into a hushed murmur.
Severus sneered, his lips parting to reveal gritted teeth. "Are you doing here,
Harry flushes, but enters the room, anyway. “Excuse me, then.”
if I get sick and die with all this dust, Potter, I'm blaming
"I do not think that Voldemort will occupy himself with young Draco here," Dumbledore mused, his calm and light voice cutting through the tension. He looked at Draco from above his glasses. "I ask that you not worry about that, my boy, but we must still exercise utmost caution. Also," he continued. "I believe it's best if we settle this argument elsewhere. Draco must be tired."
“You’re off the mission.”
Harry was used to attention but somehow, this felt heavier than usual. He swallowed thickly. “I can talk to George to charm the mistletoe away…”
Now he knew what Dumbledore had meant when he said “six years too long.”
Harry was disturbed at that. Draco Malfoy had always looked prim and proper, and Harry was no stranger to seeing him in fancy clothes since they always attended the same parties, but what right did Draco have to look so stunning in an all-white ensemble and his white-blonde hair gelled back?
of class and still persists to this day, and be confused at how could anyone listen so aptly to Snape with such dedication.
I am not
Because of this, Harry had no qualms about staring openly at him. Err. His back.
“So,” Draco said after loudly clearing his throat. He peered at the clear, red liquid in his wine glass, eyes narrowing because his vision blurred. “This is some strong stuff. If I hadn’t kissed you, I wouldn’t have gotten this wine?”
Harry flushes with shame, because he knows that that’s exactly what he’s feeling right now. He shoves a piece of toast in his mouth. “Sorry. I just want to do it, okay? Isn’t that reason enough?”
The two of them are both quieter now, more introspective. It’s more obvious in Ron, who’s usually the first to blow up or give in to his more explosive emotions. They’ve fought over so many things during the war, that any of their remaining differences now just aren’t important enough to fight over anymore.
from Kingsley, and Potter’s sour expression confirmed that that had probably been what their argument was about. He nodded in acknowledgement.
Ron also frowned, but only because of the sudden downturn of his friend's mood. He grabbed the parchment from him and tried again.
That wasn't so bad. It wasn't bad at all. Now what would his mother think if she knew that Draco had willingly given his blood to a vampire?
He needed to be
"So, Harry," Pansy started conversationally as they danced, her arms around his neck and his around her waist. "What are the chances that Draco won't hex me if I snog him?"
Voldemort's voice was as disgusting as his smell. It was like hundreds of snakes hissing, spluttering words of venom at each other. And it sounded pleased at what he saw.
“What happened to eye-fucking?” Pansy asked as soon as they left, turning to look at him, concerned. “Did you guys talk during the holidays?”
Harry’s insides lurched. And they lurched, and they lurched until a dark feeling dawned inside his chest.
Draco watched him leave and got up himself, leaving without a backwards glance at the Hall. Pansy simply rolled her eyes.
“Potter!”
“Oh, don’t worry about it, dear,” she smiled, but there was pain behind those eyes, and Harry knew she would never be the same again after Fred’s death. “Come in, come in!” She shut the door after him, and he placed all of his gifts under the tree, smiling as he sat down beside Ron and Hermione.
“We… things are shaky between us…” Harry finally said, letting out a sigh. “Long story short, he stormed out of the room three days ago, and we haven’t talked properly since.”
“Leave it? All you’ve done the past five years is go on about Potter, and you’re telling me three weeks of detention with him has convinced you to leave him alone?”
“Your idiot, always,” he whispered. “Listen to me. For now - you’re his follower first, my boyfriend second. Remember that.”
“He isn’t here,” Harry finally spoke up, shaking his head.
“It seems to me there’d have to be some love,” Harry shrugged, sitting down beside Draco. “Why spend so much time together if all they’re doing is arguing? There has to be more to it than that. Besides, you already wrote here that they want to spend time together forever.”
“I don’t know why you’re so adamant about it…” He rolled his eyes and shrugged. “I don’t know. You seem apologetic, but seriously, why do you care if I forgive you or not? You didn’t seem to care when you threw my hearing aids into the lake.”
? More like trying to make me throw up.”
Blaise seemed complacent, pushing Draco’s hand off of him. “He must have his dick deep inside you to do-”
“You guys go ahead, I’ll get myself a drink,” Harry said. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, but nodded, making their way towards Draco’s group, greeting each other with hugs (but giving Draco an awkward handshake each). Harry’s eyes moved to the Firewhisky, but instead opted for a glass of champagne as it seemed no one was going to touch it.
“Of course. It’s not like I like facing Voldemort every year, you know.” Harry said with a small smile.
“I know, I just… yeah, I like the bracelet okay? It’s not as if… this is the first time I’ve received a meaningful gift or anything,” he replied, wiping his hand against the towel. “We should get back.”
Harry slowly leaned forward and Draco did the same. Before they knew it, their lips were locked, roughly and with lust. Soon enough, their tongues were dancing. Draco pushed Harry against the door and kissed him passionately and roughly.
“Yes, it’s not like Voldemort’s trying to kill me or anything. And it’s not as if you’re helping him do so.”
Harry had never heard a tone so malicious come out of Draco’s mouth, nor had he seen this cold expression in a while. It had to be a facade - his silver eyes were a dead giveaway. Moreover, Harry hoped Draco wouldn’t have the heart to kill Dumbledore. He couldn’t.
“I better start calling you Granger instead of Weasley,” Draco rolled his eyes, but nodded. “Yeah. Just don't make it too awkward.”
“Please? It’ll be fun!”
Draco gulped, avoiding his eyes. “I just… it feels quite horrible to be on the side that wants your boyfriend killed. And I can’t do much to stop it. I feel useless. Please, Harry, whatever happens, I didn’t have much of a choice, okay?”
“It’s nothing, Harry.”
He looked down at his feet, unsure of what to say, but when he looked up again, it seemed that his heart had started speaking for him. “I’m in love with you, Harry. Madly. Deeply. Unwaveringly.”
“Am I sure I want to eat this?” asked Harry truthfully, frowning at Draco who gasped in response.
“Mr. Malfoy, late as well. Come to sit beside Mr. Potter, will you?” Snape said with an eye roll. Draco made his way to the front of the class. Both Harry and Draco scoffed when they made eye contact with each other. “This is the seating arrangement for the rest of the year,” Snape said, especially glancing over to Harry when he finished his last sentence. Usually, professors don’t give out seating arrangements, but Harry guessed that Snape just hated him so much he made him sit next to Malfoy.
what you’re worried about, Harry? When Dumbledore’s life was at stake?’
“Why?”
“Yeah?” he smiled sheepishly. “I wanted to do something a little memorable.”
“Sorry for pushing your limit today, I just think it’s better than to wait around. Since I’m at school now, I won’t be informed of anything.”
Pansy smirked, but she had no time to say anything in reply because Slughorn started off the lesson.
Till next time,
“I said that was a trash pick up line.” Harry covered up, embarrassed. Draco smirked.
“Merlin, I’m actually going to Crucio you!”
“Thanks,” he said, unsure of why she was staying here, talking to him like this.
“How long have you been feeling this way?”
Harry gulped. “Okay, I suppose you’re right. Can we at least start with one-” he paused to dodge another spell, “hearing aid on? I’ve… gotten used to having them on all the time and- it’s- hard- oh, fuck off!” He whipped his wand out and threw an Expelliarmus spell at Draco, who countered it with
“Bit harder, but okay. Rule three: when the worst comes, I’m on your side.”
Harry felt Draco shaking - he had still been holding Draco - and he turned to face him, slightly worried, but was relieved to see that Draco was laughing. “You all are so lame.”
“I’ll figure it out.”
“We can learn about each other.”
They made their way to the Room of Requirement, where the atmosphere was sour, cold and tense.
He sat down at the foot of her bed, trying to center himself, taking a few deep breaths.
“Romilda Vane, for Christ’s sake!” Harry cried out, annoyed.
After a moment of awkward silence, Draco decided it was better to just pretend nothing happened. “Um… alright,” He started to sign. “I’ll brew the potion. You tell me the ingredients.”
“Did you-- Harry--
“It’s just refreshing to see you like this. Not fueled by hatred for Potter, for whatever it is. You know you haven’t ranted about him - or anyone from that friend group - for two weeks now? It’s a record, really.”
Harry had found out about Horcruxes, and Draco was finishing off his job for Voldemort. The two of them were moving on with their lives, in completely opposite directions.
“I’m actually going to fucking-”
“Wait, please,” Draco said, realizing he would have to put aside his ego to get any help from Harry. Standing up, he quickly grabbed the others hand, stopping him from walking away. He turned around, staring down at their hands, confused. “Just… hear me out, please?”
“No. Yes. No-” he let out a groan. “I don’t… I don’t want to change my mind now. He’s married. The best option is to let him go, isn’t it?”
Draco gulped, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t… well…”
,” he said rather loudly, mispronouncing the spell, in return, failing the spell he was trying to do on the rat in front of him. Flitwick had given out animals to practice the pell on.
Harry thought to himself as Madame Pomfrey practically glared at him as he entered.
That was, until, Harry saw the actual Draco Malfoy standing in the hallway. Harry dropped the books in his hand, stopped walking, and almost fell over. The books had hit the floor with a huge
“Now?” Harry asked.
Love,
Draco gently used his hand to tilt Harry’s head upwards, his platinum hair falling into his eyes. “Nothing has to change,” he shook his head.
“I sure as hell hope so, Draco,” Harry replied, biting his lip as he frowned. Draco slowly opened the large doors of Malfoy Manor, entering the mansion.
“No, it wasn’t. I already told you, I don’t like her anymore. If I ever did, I mean…” he trailed off into silence, thinking about Cedric again, then shook his head. “Listen, don’t tell Hermione I have a… girlfriend.”
“I’ll just go check on Ginny and her baking,” Molly said, smiling, standing up and quickly leaving the room. Surely it wasn’t bad enough that she wanted to leave, was it? Who was Harry kidding - the atmosphere was so tense that he wasn’t sure if he wanted to make out with Draco or slap him in the face.
“Would you ever… tell me if you were asked to do Death Eater work? Because… you know that I’m here for you, right?”
“I just…” Harry said in a soft whisper, slowly sitting down on the bed.
“I didn’t, I just have
“You think mine isn’t? Do you have any idea what would happen to me if my father found out, let alone the Dark Lord?” he raised his voice. “I go to bed every night thinking about how sooner or later I’m going to become one of them, and it’s painful, because I don’t want to hurt you. But turns out…”
“A poem for Harry,” he replied.
Pansy’s eyes widened. “Is the poem about him?”
“No, of course not. How could you even ask me that?”
“That’s better,” he nodded, a small smirk on his face, as if he knew just how much power he had over his son. “Your mother is in her room. The doctor was just in for a check-up. Go see how she is.”
“With what?”
“I trust that it’ll work out,” Harry said, referring to the war. “And if it doesn’t… well, we’ll just have to see.”
“Last year,” Draco replied, looking up again as he continued to write furiously.
“Do you want to know how I found out about your and Potter’s little…
Draco’s hand trembled slightly as Harry held it. Harry noticed, but didn’t say anything, his green eyes sparkling as he stared into glistening silver ones. “You could never understand,” He said slowly and in a quiet voice.
This summer was different than most. Harry had spent all his summer at The Burrow with Ron, and even Hermione joined after a few weeks. It was rough to not see Draco, but they always sent letters back and forth.
Harry picked up the quill, dipping it in ink, putting an arm over Draco’s shoulder, trying to reach the paper and quickly writing. “Hmm?” he hummed, showing the blond, who was trying to keep his breathing steady as his heart beat sped up.
“Yes, but-”
“Hey, kids, I got some tea for you-”
“Draco, they think you’re a girl,” Harry said through laughter. “Which you are, I suppose.”
Harry had to numb it out. He had to, he couldn’t let himself be torn. He turned and started to walk away.
“Was it a… dream, or…” his tone was careful, almost as if he was afraid to say the wrong thing.
She waved him off. “I’ll tell them you went to bed and ask Ron to cover for you. Go, dumbass.”
On nights where Draco had nightmares, Harry would turn on the dim lamplight at the bedside table, grab a book and hold Draco close, reading out stories to him, mostly ones from Draco’s childhood. The mornings after, you’d find them sleeping in odd positions, either curled up together or completely apart from each other, the book somehow on the other side of the room.
Narcissa nodded in understanding, “I can understand. Draco always loved playing Quidditch… Though he would always come every winter and complain about how he lost to Potter once again… and how annoying Potter was, and how he just wished that you could have been friends-”
It was as if what Harry had been dreading was finally approaching. Draco had been set an awful task, and this was going to drive a wedge between them. It was certain. Despite their stupid rules and deals and how much they wanted to reassure each other that they were okay, this wasn’t something up for debate.
“You didn’t see the message, did you?” Ron rolled his eyes. “Malfoy wants to see you in the Astronomy Tower at midnight.”
There was a pause, as if Draco was thinking of the right words to say. Now that he was here, in this moment, it was much harder to push him away. Maybe it was the way Harry looked like his heart was breaking, or maybe because he looked close to tears. Or maybe it was because Draco had never felt so strongly for someone before, and didn’t want to push away someone who made him want to be a better person.
“We will be brewing the Draught of Peace today,” Snape announced. “I expect you all to know the ingredients already, as we covered it last lesson. Get into pairs before I do it myself.”
“Draco, come on, this is getting ridiculous, please,
“Merry Christmas, my love,” Draco replied, running his hands through Harry’s hair, turning to face the fireplace that was in front of them. “I got you something.” He slowly picked up Harry and put him down on the sofa, going to the Christmas tree and picking up the small box, walking back to Harry, smiling slightly as he handed it to him.
“I’m researching,” Harry moaned into his mouth.
“Do you think this is easy for me?” Harry stormed.
“Well, there was less malice, but we were worse,” he replied, but inhaled sharply. “I was really hoping things would be better with me and your friends, though. I mean, it’s a poor choice of friends, but-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry! The hell are you doing without your Invisibility Cloak? If someone saw you-”
“Hermione, could you not?” Harry folded his arms, tilting his head as she stood in front of the TV. “You know, this isn’t making me like you any better right now.”
“No, Harry, how do you
“...Yes. Thanks, Harry.”
“That’s absurd!”
Harry took out his wand from his pocket, slowly stepping out of the kitchen. As he did so, he bumped into someone, but instinctively took a step back, putting his wand to their neck. His eyes filled with recognition when a pair of silver eyes looked back at him.
“Yeah, well, that’s understandable. And do you also feel like an idiot for giving up on the relationship so easily?”
“Remind me why I’m here again?” Pansy folded her arms. She had rolled the sleeves of her white shirt up as she clutched her wand, looking back and forth between Draco and Harry. “I gave up a date for this.”
How could they not believe him? Harry scoffed and entered the classroom.
Harry facepalmed, watching as the two entered the living room. Everyone stood in silence before he cleared his throat awkwardly. “Bye,” he said, making his way to the door.
“I don’t need-”
“Can’t remember,” Ron said, getting up and quickly running to the bathroom before Harry even had a chance to stand up. Harry groaned but laid back down on his bed, realizing it was probably better that he got to relax a bit more while waiting for Ron to get out of the shower. Harry felt around for his glasses and slowly placed them on, surprised to see a glass with a little water left in it on his bedside table.
“Draco, you made it,” Luna grinned, pulling him into a hug. “It’s so good to see you again. And you too, Astoria.”
The book instantly opened up again, to page 154. The chapter’s name was ‘Love’.
“Oh, I’m sure we can come up with something better,” Harry said, picking up the apple pie. “Do we have enough time to remake it?”
“Well, this may come as a surprise to you, but it’s not exactly something I’d like to broadcast to the world,” Draco snapped.
“Yes, Harry?” Pansy asked suddenly without looking up, making Harry jump slightly.
“Yeah, but something tells me that it is,” Harry said, frowning as he looked among the Slytherins that were conversing in the distance, most of them making their way back up to the castle.
,” Hermione said with a huge sigh as she flopped herself down on the seat of the train compartment, “I thought we’d never be able to escape.” Harry nodded in agreement, but didn’t say anything.
“I did,” Harry nodded, putting on a serious expression. “The things I do for you.”
Harry didn’t mind, he knew that they had to get by like this, faking the hate. He slowly took his bag and joined Hermione and Ron who were waiting for him at the door of the classroom.
“What was?” she asked, frowning, edging closer to him. “Did something happen, Draco? I heard your mother was sick-”
There were a few low whistles and Draco’s eyes widened for a moment, before gulping, glaring at Harry. “You’re not fooling anyone with this,” he hissed in a low voice, almost as if he was trying to control himself.
September flew by quickly and things were eerily calm. Draco entered the Slytherin Common Room and sat down beside Pansy, who turned to him with a smile. It was a late Friday evening and he had just finished up a WSL lesson with Harry. Though, if they were being honest, it wasn’t much learning and more… making out on the couch, amongst other things.
“Maybe I shouldn’t have pushed him, but… for fuck’s sake,” he quickly wiped his tears away, avoiding her gaze. “I thought Harry could trust me. He… thinks I’d go off telling my father if he says anything.”
“Harry, dear, it’s so great to see you!” Molly said as she gushed, hugging him tightly before slowly pulling away, smiling softly as she turned to see Draco awkwardly standing there.
“That’s literally not for another forty-five minutes,” Ron said, frowning at the sight.
“Um… ‘Harry, you’re doing it again’?”
Harry found himself crying too.
“Are you going to visit? To say sorry.”
It would, undoubtedly, end their relationship, sooner or later.
“Oh, yes but, just wait! I’ve got gifts for the two of you,” Molly said, rushing up to the two of them and each handing them a box.
“I think,” Draco narrowed his eyes, “we are dangerously close to breaking our rules.”
“Can you stop?” Harry asked. “You don’t need to tread carefully around me. I’m not made of glass. Just treat me like you normally would. I hate that you think you need to tread carefully and be extra nice to me. Just leave me be. I’ll figure things out on my own.”
Looking around, he quickly opened the door and entered, surprised to see the room he and Harry had asked for, which had turned into their own. There were scattered coffee cups on the table, some robes on the couch, a few books on the table, and Harry sat at the table, one knee propped up as he wrote furiously on a piece of paper.
Harry stood up. “This is stupid,” he sighed, looking away from Draco’s eyes, that by each day, were becoming easier and easier to fall into. “Maybe I should just ask Ron and Hermione for help instead.”
“I’m surprised you’d even want to talk about me to your relatives,” Harry raised an eyebrow, leaning forward, a small smirk on his face. “Am I that important in your life, hmm?”
“For the record, it’s dark blue,” Harry said as he opened up his book again to continue reading.
“Harry, we should switch now,” Hermione said as she walked out of the tent. She took in a deep breath, sitting down beside Harry who was staring into the blazing flames in front of him. “You okay?” asked Hermione.
“Harry, we have class in five minutes,” Draco whispered as Harry kissed his neck, unbuttoning the first few buttons of his shirt. “Harry…”
But that didn’t stop him from being a complete jerk. Harry couldn’t approach Draco now. Harry had been a dick towards him. Draco had every right to be upset - even though he had said some things about him too, Harry knew that he took it too far.
?” she raised her voice, outraged.
“I’ve been better,” he nodded, adjusting his glasses and folding his arms. “Why aren’t you eating with the others?”
“Like I said, you don’t have to come with me.”
Sorry it took me so long to update! It's been a busy week. I have loads of school work and my birthday was a few days ago too ^^
Harry didn’t quite know where he stood with Draco. If they stood anywhere at all, even. But as each day passed, each poem seemed to be deeper, more real. It was a raw version of Draco, and Harry liked being the only one to see his poetic side, as weird as it sounded.
Harry couldn’t speak. He had to be wrong. He
When you expect the chapter to go one way but then your fingers start typing for you...
What if Draco was dying?
“Yes.” Draco felt like he was overreacting; being dramatic, even. So what if his father was a little strict? All parents are strict. That didn’t make it…
“You’re a dick, you know that?”
For the rest of the time, while they waited, it was just playful bickering and eating some more waffles and drinking hot chocolate. Even Blaise and Theo had shown up; as well as Dean, Seamus, and Neville.
Harry heard the echo of Draco calling after him, he felt the tears spilling down his cheeks, he felt his legs walking away and away, far away from Draco.
“What?” Harry asked. His smile had faded and his eyes had stopped sparkling. He could feel his heart beating loudly. Only one thought was circling Harry in that moment:
Harry paused for a second, confused too. He never thought about
“...together,” Pansy added, winking again. Harry felt himself go red and Draco facepalmed, rolling his eyes. “I just hope you’ve been using prote-”
Draco was up and about a few days later. He was still very weak.
“A bit,” Draco said with a grin. “Do you want to go to the lake?”
********
It was a kiss they both enjoyed.
“So June 30th?” Draco ran a hand through his hair, raising an eyebrow, shutting his book altogether. “I suppose that makes sense.”
But that’s not how Harry’s luck works.
He stumbled towards the doors of the Hospital Wing, ready to yank it open and demand for his father – when the doors opened on their own and his father stepped through, tired, thinner, but
When Madame Pomfrey was satisfied that he had drank the very last drop, she took his and Malfoy's glass with her and left them stern instructions to
“Draco doesn’t like me,” Harry muttered pitifully.
Harry blinked at it. This was it. The book that Draco had talked about once or twice.
Potter actually had the nerve to skip their flying time together. Just had Kreacher pop up in Draco's room to tell him without even having the courage to say it himself. Kreacher had muttered something about filthy blood, but Draco waved it off as those moments that Kreacher would go into those fits of his and start sounding like Walburga Black.
Or maybe that was just because all the dogs were all shaded rather darkly.
But they weren't back in the Quidditch Pitch.
"Why?"
He looked at his father straight in the eyes and made sure his voice didn't tremble.
Draco laughed.
When Potter spoke, gone was the irritability that he had brought with him since the morning. When he spoke, it was almost soft.
Malfoy covered his arm again and whipped out his wand with a huff. “Are
She hooted quietly and nuzzled closer to his touch.
Draco leaned back, relaxing, letting himself slump (just a bit!) against the hard backrest of his chair. He really was too far gone with Potter.
Harry was dumbfounded. He had been ready for a variety of replies, but he wasn't expecting
He was thankful to be alive, but he didn't realize just how much he had been hoping that he
Severus spoke again. “Harry and Draco have gotten along famously well since day one and have, in fact, been inseparable. Let me be the one to inform you that Draco has enjoyed himself a great deal being with Harry – a fact that you may have realized on your own earlier

“I… don’t understand what you’re getting at, Astoria.”
was the one who was supposed to pout petulantly. He closed the door and plopped down beside Draco. “Have you been crying?”
Harry shrugs. “You know, I’m not really sure myself,” he says honestly.
. “—should be easily compensated for. Muggles compensate for trifle disabilities all the time, do they not?”
"But that's why you're here, I think," Potter said instead, quietly. The mood in the room had dimmed. Maybe this was why they didn't talk about this. "I think Voldemort is looking for your parents, because they betrayed him. He'll use you against them if he can. That's why you need to hide."
Beside him, Malfoy sighed dramatically.
"But… W-Why
“Shouldn’t it?”
Draco cleared his throat and said loudly, "Finally decided to grace us with your presence, O Great Vampire Dark Lord?"
“No, not just for that.”
And now the man was telling him to eat all these delicious food and wasn’t
Harry nodded in brotherly understanding.
However, an hour into Diagon Alley, he found that the outside world wasn’t quite bad. In fact, it was
We don’t know what’s going to happen.
Potter turns his head, looks at him from the corner of his eye. “Can you walk?”
Harry woke up five hours later with a horrible hangover and the thought that he should talk to the old lady upstairs about feeding the cat too much because the cat was
Draco let out a humorless laugh. "Why not? Potter, I'm a Death Eater!"
Harry frowned again, shoulders drooping.
"You're a thick pillock."
"I've had enough of attention for the past few years, thank you very much." Harry then had this funnily ironic thought:
They didn't talk for the next three days. Potter was
He hoped she would.
Harry visits the next morning.
They even called up Professor McGonagall through the Floo network. “Horcruxes are made from powerful, vengeful magic, further corrupted by hatred and blood. Something as powerful as that can only be reversed by an equally powerful magic, like
Potter swallowed, and then shook his head. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Severus doesn't tell me anything. He never does."
But it’s such a blow to the chest every time he comes across something like this, these moments that make his cheeks warm and makes it hard to breathe and even harder to look away.
This both surprised and not surprised Harry, because Draco did spend most of his time nowadays in the library but he was so rattled earlier, that Harry wondered why he didn't retreat to the dungeons. Harry was glad he didn't though – made it so much easier to get to him.
It occurred to him to run after Draco, but the boy had already turned the corner and was nowhere to be seen and Harry thought that he really needed his Self-Erasing Parchment.
Harry's eyes are suspiciously damp. "Did you... last night..." And his voice, embarrassingly, trails off, and Draco smiles warmly at it.
He looked back at the table and another book caught his eye. It was a thick one that had a black cover and a striking resemblance to one of his books in sixth year: the Half-Blood Prince’s Potions book.
Harry and Ron are worried. Her letters talk about things that are okay (her parents are in good health, they know who she is now), but avoids talking about the things that are not (why they haven’t come back to England yet, and how much do her parents
Harry gives a small, unrepentant grin.
Harry very stubbornly shook his head no.
"The Dark Lord will also be looking for you, Severus," Narcissa said. "Only the wards of Hogwarts is keeping him from spelling us all dead."
"Thank you," he breathed out, looking uncomfortable as he did so but determined anyway.
that Draco would have been able to help him. That Draco would have
Draco was looking at the library entrance.
“I mean, like Goyle. Or Nott.”
He was going to get Severus and Fleur Delacour's sister to safety.
"Finite Incantatem!" a voice rose from the other side of the hall.
His face cleared when he saw Draco, which Draco found to be terribly endearing, the
It will probably still be.
"Ah, but that's the thing, Harry," Ron said wisely. "For them, you already are."
Harry, who was sitting on the armchair beside the couch, wisely kept mum about his cat (who was nowhere to be found right now, which wasn’t a surprise because the cat never stayed the night in his flat anyway) making a mess of Draco’s desk. He also wisely ignored the bit of skin that was exposed by the loosening of Draco’s tie.
Harry paused, arm raised halfway in the middle of pointing to the fountain where water flowed from a statue of Panacea, goddess of universal remedy. He didn’t know why Draco was so curious. Severus, Sirius and Remus never made a big fuss out of it, so he supposed all wizards didn’t think much of vampires, not like how the Muggles did.
again.
and –
The discomfort increased. His father and Severus were friends,
Draco's mouth formed an 'o'. A few seconds passed, and he quickly shut his mouth, because it was unbecoming of a Malfoy to be seen with such an expression. However, when he composed himself, he was looking at Potter in a new light. "Very impressive. I don't know if I can call that very brave or very suicidal."
Finally, the door opened – just narrow enough for Petunia to push the boy through.
And Harry laughs, thinks that the secluded life of peace and gluttony doesn’t sound that bad, and wipes his tears away.
Harry picked up his Self-Inking Quill and wrote.
Harry tried very hard to think of any rebuttals for that, tried very hard to recall his past lessons on Magical Reactions. He frowned. “Okay, but.” He paused, looking back at the spot where the locket once lay with its broken shards and broken chain. He tried to imagine all the possible scenarios that could happen once Draco said the spell.
Even Remus was laughing alongside Sirius, waving cheerfully at Harry.
"Gorgeous, isn't he?" Harry had said.
, didn't he?
Harry hopes Malfoy remembers who he is.
Potter must not be one for physical proximity, Draoc thought, but he was surprised at how tight the grip on his shoulders was.
“You might want to come back in the afternoon. He’s more… present then.”
He stood up from his crouching position and brushed his knees although they hardly touched the ground at all. When he took a step forward though, his foot got caught on a wayward vine and he lost his balance.
Draco jumps and stands up from his bed when he enters, and Harry remembers that
“Yeah. We would have.”
He glanced at the crowd again, this time searching for another familiar person to seek comfort in. Instead of searching for Severus' all-black ensemble, now he was searching for something brighter. White blond.
“No, I just figured he’d be somewhere around here, though,” Pansy said, her eyebrows slanting into a frown as she slowly shut her book. “How do you feel?”
********
“I’m good too. You know, I think Dumbledore’s Army was a good idea. It’s nice to see you’re able to help others. You’ve certainly been helping me,” she smiled.
Meanwhile, in Malfoy Manor, Draco was in his room, frowning as he stared down at his notebook. He looked up to see his mother entering the room, smiling at him sympathetically. He absentmindedly rolled down his sleeves. It was the peak of summer, yet he still knew better than to wear short sleeves now.
A few months passed. The last of winter had left and spring passed, yet even the beautiful summertime couldn’t help the horrible feeling in Harry’s chest. It lingered in the daytime and worsened in the dark. The guilt for Cedric. The fear for his own life. The stupidity of thinking hurting Draco would be better than putting him in danger. The price of his backwards, disgraceful ‘bravery’.
,” he yelped dramatically. “What was that for?”
He pulled his sleeve down. “Fuck. Okay. I won’t forget.”
“Are we going to talk?” Harry finally spoke, hesitantly and awkwardly.
“What did you do?” Draco said after a few moments, realizing that he was not in pain, nor did he feel any different.
Draco made his way to the owlery as per his new daily morning routine, clutching two pieces of paper in his hand. One was a silly poem, the other one was… something he shouldn’t have even considered sending to Harry. It was stupid, yet perfectly described Draco’s thoughts throughout this whole mishap. Only he knew how horrible the burning feeling in his chest felt, yet no one seemed to believe how sorry he actually was.
“A bit hypocritical of you, don’t you think?” Blaise laughed bitterly. “Come on, don’t be such a wuss. Crabbe and Goyle will help too.”
*******
“Harry…” he whispered as he let the other pull him into a kiss, wrapping his arms around his waist. “What about the factors? Our mistakes?”
Ginny was grinning from ear to ear. She slowly leaned up, to kiss Harry on the lips. Harry, who was daydreaming while staring at her, didn’t notice.
“No way,” Harry whispered. “No fucking way.”
*******
Opportunities? Or time in Azkaban? Draco kept his thoughts to himself, nodding. His expression was unreadable, and he hoped he seemed at least somewhat composed in front of him.
“Stop blaming yourself for the Sectumsempra spell,” he mumbled. “Seriously. It was my fault. It clearly said ‘for enemies’. And at that moment… I thought you were my enemy.”
.” She flicked her hair behind, smirking.
“Uh, anyway, what’s the purpose of this? Do you expect me to just forgive you and date you again? Because… I get where you’re coming from with all of this but… I don’t think I can move past it."
He rolled his eyes. “No one said anything about a Gryffindor,” he pointed out, then instantly regretted it. “Forget it. You’re not going to be able to guess.”
It took a lot for Harry to not smile. “No, but I’m ready for another of you being an absolute pain in the arse,” he retorted. They exchanged a look and Hermione rolled her eyes, grabbing his arm.
“Well, of course, dear! Why wouldn’t I be?” Molly asked with a smile. “Well, you know, I always had a sort of hunch. Why did it take so long for you to tell us? You should know we’d all accept you.”
“I’m exhausted. How are you feeling?” she asked, running a hand through her hair.
“And Harry, what good will that do?” Pansy asked with an eye roll.
“You’re my boyfriend, Harry, of course it’s my place,” he stated with a soft cry, trying to hide his face.
“Ask Dean! Or Seamus! Literally anyone has more dating experience than me!”
All of a sudden, Draco stood up and exited the Great Hall. Harry stood up, startling Ron and Hermione.
“Still thinking about it, aren’t you? I told you; I’m fine. It was nearly two years ago. I’m all healed.”
“Hmm? Oh yeah, sure.” Harry replied dazedly. “Just this medicine makes me a bit forgetful and unfocused.”
“I’m guessing you don’t want to tell me, then?” she said playfully, handing the shirt that she had folded to Harry. He gratefully put it into his trunk neatly. She moved on to the next shirt. The two of them were now just folding Harry’s clothes. “Is she pretty?”
“Why did you put so many drops in the first place?” Harry retaliated. “I said seven!”
“What was with the sitting down? Why didn’t you just stand up?” Hermione pestered.
Draco quickly turned to face Harry. “Are you sure? Do you need some time before we start?”
Harry had tears streaming down his face as he slowly got his wand out, pointing at the Draco in front of him. “
“As I was saying…” he gulped, looking up at Draco. “Slughorn gave us this mead to drink. I wasn’t really into it but I’m supposed to gain his trust - um forget I said that. Anyway, he was still toasting so neither of us took a sip, but Ron did, and guess what, it was poisoned. I had to save his life.”
He gave her an unsure look, but nodded.
He groaned. “Shut up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Listen, you-”
“Good. Now get to your classes,” she ordered. Draco stood up at once, quickly leaving. Harry lingered for a moment, and she sighed, placing the hearing aids on the table. “I managed to get it from the lake, but I’m uncertain how well they would work… are they Muggle hearing aids?”
Harry felt tears well up in his eyes, then stood up, picking up a letter from the counter. “I don’t want to make a fool of myself.”
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s hips. “I’ve missed you too,” he replied. “I was on patrol duty. Just had to check areas not to find you per se, but at least those on your side. I genuinely didn’t think you’d be here. And don’t worry, I’m sure no one else would think to look here. I won’t tell them I was here. I’ve been looking in places I thought you wouldn’t be, but… here we are.”
“Just getting to know her,” Harry said honestly. “I didn’t know that I would ever go on a date with her. I never even dreamed of it.”
“And I was just starting to change, so uh-”
“I’m not going to leech off of my boyfriend’s money,” he shook his head. “Thanks for your concerns, guys, but it’s okay.”
The three heard a muffled yell below them. Draco glanced over his shoulder, trying to listen to more of the fight. He found himself hoping that Harry wasn’t in the middle of it.
He picked up a pen, quickly scribbling a letter back to Ron and Hermione, since it seemed the owl they had sent would not stop following him until he sent a response to them.
“You…” Harry’s eyes were widened, his green eyes glinting with tears ever so slightly.
“Yeah, it’s not every day I willingly go near someone who could potentially kill me,” he shrugged, looking over at Draco. “Listen, I... I’m trying to think of this from perspective, but… it’s just hard for me. I went two years thinking that I had done something wrong, all because my biggest fear was…”
“Are you now?” Draco asked, a pure smirk on his face as he stared at Harry. Sure, he was upset with him, but it was hilarious to see what drunk Harry was like. Harry let out a loud whine as he punched the cushion beside him, frowning deeply as he nodded.
“Okay, really, that’s more than enough,” Hermione said after a few moments. The two pulled apart, their hair messy, grinning.
“I shouldn’t have come,” Harry said, feeling guilty. He should have respected what Draco wanted, and he should have left him alone. He stood up, and turned to leave.
“Better, better. He’ll be there for classes tomorrow.” Hermione told Harry, who nodded.
She glared at him. “Is that
“Never,” Draco whispered as Harry slowly shut his eyes, almost instantly falling asleep - Draco’s warmth, his scent, and the way he held him, it was perfect for Harry. It was comfortable.
Harry and Draco exchanged glances. "Well... perhaps... uh... more than friends," Harry managed to say, feeling embarrassed.
“Quite reckless of me to come back, isn’t it?” Draco laughed nervously. “I’m laughing because I think I’ll cry if I don’t. By the way, your spell and wand work is so much better. You did really well back there against everyone, thanks to me."
“Coming,” Harry checked his wrist where his watch was, “two minutes after the time we had planned to meet is not late, Draco.”
Harry had expected Draco to open the door by then, or at least say something. But all there was, was silence.
“Thanks, Pansy,” Harry whispered as the Gryffindors started talking to the Slytherins.
talk?” Ginny, beside him, snapped. She turned to Harry sweetly. “You’re not a burden, Harry.”
Draco slowly entered the room.
“My God!” Harry cried out in annoyance. “Why does it matter to you if I do or not? Do you like Cho?”
Draco blinked, before cracking a smile. “Well, it’s two seconds to midnight, so… ditto,” He said. Suddenly everyone was shouting ‘Happy New Year’, and the fireworks had begun. “Happy New Year, love.”
“No no, I’m waiting for you. You stupid git,” said Draco, but he was grinning at Harry, his silver eyes glistening as he stared at him, who rolled his eyes and walked into the bathroom.
“I figured. That’s how I feel about Pansy, too,” he stated, staring down at the book in front of him.
Draco couldn’t think of anything, anything at all. He hung his head low and tried to think.
“Um…”
And now, as he felt Harry snuggling up close to him, opening up his book again and occasionally just leaning forwards and pecking him on the cheek…
They had no time to say anything else. The rest of the Death Eaters arrived. Harry wished he hadn’t been wearing his hearing aids for this. Draco kept his wand up and was mostly silent, but had a sneer on his face. Harry had to admit, he was good at pretending. It almost fooled him. But between the rough exchanges between everyone, as Snape raised his wand, Draco dropped his hand almost immediately, as if he was relieved. But he couldn’t hide his frown as Snape killed Dumbledore right before him.
“Oh, right, you can’t hear her crying,” she rolled her eyes, then subtly nudged her chin in Lavender’s direction. She was several seats down at the Gryffindor table, crying while being comforted by her friends, who gave Hermione a dirty look when they caught them staring. “They’re done.”
“I like your nails.”
“Harry, I’ve realized that we’re too different. My father wants me to marry a woman.”
“Draco, I need you to send a letter for me,” said Narcissa as she entered his room.
“Nothing. I just think it’s funny how you like a Ravenclaw girl,” he shrugged, sitting up properly.
It hadn’t been a good dream.
“Ginny, I… I’m sorry, I…” Harry started to apologize but noticed that Ginny was staring at someone behind him. Harry turned to see a white-haired boy turning and walking away swiftly. “Fuck…”
“The- the Dark Mark, Albus.”
”Trust me, he’ll say yes soon.”
“Rude.” Draco huffed.
This wasn’t the end.
Fuming, Hermione nodded. “Fine. But if anyone asks you why you were being so loud in your bedroom, I’m not covering for you. Hopefully I won’t see you until Hogwarts, Malfoy.”
“I have no idea what you just said,” Hermione told him. Harry laughed slightly before quickly wiping his tears away.
“Harry.” Hermione cut him off, giving him a demeaning look with a glare, making Harry immediately run into the bathroom to get ready. He changed into random clothes that he found in his trunk and met Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room right on time for dinner.
Harry glanced at his ex-arch nemesis. “I have a few things to say,” he announced. “One, isn’t your dad a Deatheater? Doesn’t that make you automatically on Voldemort’s side?”
to take his eyes off of Draco, who awkwardly stood there, wondering why Harry was looking at him like that.
“Accept? Merlin, I accepted that long ago. I was talking about how I accepted that I’m mad at Draco and I don’t think we’re going to get back together,” Harry muttered with another sigh.
Draco tilted his head, eyes filled with concern. “It’s not yours either, okay? Like you said before, this is all bigger than us,” he brought Harry into his arms, who had tears streaming down his face again.
The two were making out for what seemed like forever, which to them, wasn’t something they were complaining about. Harry’s heart was almost leaping out of his chest, as if this was their first kiss, as if they had just confessed their feelings for each other.
Groaning into his pillow, he jumped when he heard Pansy laugh. “What are you doing here?” he asked, watching as she shut the door behind her. Harry and Draco had met up earlier in the morning so they would be able to sneak out easier.
He put a hand to his neck. “Uh… yeah, I was with him. And no, I don’t need concealer. And don’t refer to me as ‘honey’.”
“I think we should break up.” Draco blurted. He didn’t mean to say that. Originally, he was going to tell Harry how Snape found out. Harry quickly sat up and put the book aside. Just by looking at Harry’s face, Draco could see what he had said was a huge mistake.
She was left speechless. “I… I just thought I was doing the right thing, Harry.”
“I suppose we all need our safe space,” Harry nodded. Draco nodded, smiling slightly.
“Bullshit! You used it pretty much all throughout sixth year. Don’t try bullshitting me!” Harry said, scoffing at Draco’s lame excuse. “You know very well how to use it!”
Snape’s eyes widened a bit before he went back to his normal blank expression.
He chewed his lip, then nodded. “Okay, I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try. But you can’t be short with me. I’m going to be slow.”
“Hey!” Harry snapped, snatching the letter back. “No one said you could read it.”
“Oh shut up, Draco.” Harry’s arms were now wrapped around Draco’s neck and he pushed their lips together. Harry had jumped on Draco’s front. The kiss lasted long again, the two knew that they probably wouldn’t be able to freely make out until Saturday.
Harry jumped right on Draco, wrapping his arms around him tightly and his legs around his waist.
Without thinking, Draco reached across the table, using his hand to gently lift up Harry’s chin, grinning as if he felt like the smartest person on Earth. “Can’t it be a little bit of both, Potter?”
Harry sat on the bed of the Room of Requirement, quickly wiping away the tears on his face and turning to Draco, “How’d you know I’d be here?” He asked in a soft tone, biting his lip, sniffling slightly.
“Er… I need to use the bathroom. I’ll be back,” he said, then quickly left. When he went out to the hallway, he frowned when he saw Draco by the door of the Great Hall. He turned around, his bloodshot meeting Harry’s. There were tears rolling down his face and he was struggling to catch his breath. “Draco,” Harry said softly, taking a step towards him.
“Malfoy, Potter!” Professor McGonagall practically shouted, running towards the two. Draco, who was pale and clutching his cheek, seemed to have guilt written all over his face. Harry turned to see the professor, cursing under his breath, letting go of him. “Both of you, my office.
Harry’s heart sank. His mind immediately went to…
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Harry sighed.
“Oh, come on. It has to be you. I mean, you have more experience with the Cloak than me!” Draco pointed out, shutting the door so that no one would see them. “I don’t really have much experience!”
“I wasn’t expecting you to lounge around my room,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Anyway… uhh… He said maybe. I’m not entirely sure what that means, but...”
just do that,” Pansy stated, leaning down and quickly making a snowball and throwing at Draco, who instead of throwing a snowball back, turned away, burying his face into Harry’s chest.
I know I posted a chapter just yesterday but... oops
“No, don’t say that; it was mine-”
“Where’s mother?” he asked, watching as Lucius Malfoy looked up from his newspaper, raising an eyebrow. For a moment, they stared at each other in silence, until he curled his lip.
And suddenly, it hit him.
use my Invisibility Cloak.” Harry patted his bag which had his Cloak inside it.
“I’m also sorry for blocking you out instead of telling you that I’m just missing my parents…”
“Don’t you dare fucking say that. No sentence ends well if it starts like that,” Draco’s voice shaky, but firm at the same time. He was now stroking Harry’s hair holding him close.
Harry smiled and pocketed the note, suddenly finding himself desperately waiting (and feeling quite nervous) for lunch.
Sorry for the short chapter but I wanted something to be out before my school starts. I hope I'll be able to make enough time to write! I have finals coming up in June so quite stressful. Especially stressful when the only time I'm inspired to write drarry is when I'm supposed to be doing homework hahah
sorry if it's a mess idk i just wanted some cute drarry oof
“Yeah, me too.”
“Don’t, Harry, because then I’ll tell you everything. And if he finds out, you know how ugly things would get. I can’t let anyone down with this. Especially my father.”
Draco rolled his eyes, feeling himself grow impatient. “You can’t do that anymore. You’re already so behind on your studies. Am I supposed to help you with homework or help you understand the concepts?"
Harry, who had his back to Hermione, now quickly turned, glaring at her. “Oh, really, are you now?”
Hermione chuckled bitterly, “Believing or not believing, they will still
“Well, I’m glad to hear that. But it seems to me you’re more than just dating…” She glanced down to Harry’s left hand.
caught you.”
“Hey.” A voice spoke behind Harry. He turned to see silver eyes staring at him, a smile on the blond’s face but quickly fading when he noticed Harry wasn’t smiling. He looked around and then dragged Harry to a nearby broom closet. “Everything okay?”
He continued to walk, holding the tears of frustration back until he reached his dorm, collapsing on the bed at once, not bothering to take his shoes off or changing into more comfortable clothes.
Thirty minutes later, Harry managed to slip out of the party, and quickly went to his dorm and got into bed, falling asleep almost immediately.
Harry kissed his nose quickly. “And I’m all yours.”
“Oh, that’s awesome, Hermione. Show me what it is when you get back.” Harry replied with a smile. He was in a good mood today. Obviously, because he got to hang out with Draco.
“At least tell me,” Harry was saying, hot tears running down his face, his vision slightly blurry, “is it because of the Boggart?”
“Okay, that was…” Harry said as he re-entered the room, Draco behind. They had just cut the cake for Luna, quickly eaten, then excused themselves, one to the bathroom and the other complaining that his head was still hurting. The two stared at each other as he shut the door behind them, locking it quickly. “Did we… break the curse there for a second?”
“Because I never want to forget you.”
“It’s a Muggle device, Ron,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “It usually helps people hear, but… since this was the result of some sort of dark magic, I’m not sure if it will work,” she explained, watching Harry stare down at them.
He made his way to Potions, unsure of what to do anymore. On top of these feelings he had to get rid of, he was worried about Voldemort. Maybe in that sense, Draco was right. As a Malfoy, he would be expected to be a Death Eater.
Standing up, Draco walked over to his closet, searching underneath his clothes and finally getting out the iPhone Harry had bought for him two years ago. Switching it on, he went to the Photos app and stared down at the selfie they had taken, smiling at the fear in his eyes. The phone had freaked him out so much that they had to keep it in another room for a few days.
“Since when?”
“Draco?” Blaise asked.
******
“You don’t understand. I can’t tell you about anything that’s going to happen. I can’t stand to-”
“Yeah?” Hermione urged gently.
Short chapter, but as I wrote it, it felt right to stop with Draco and Harry in each other's arms <3
Draco rubbed his eyes, groaning gently when he reached around for the alarm clock on his bedside table that was, in his opinion, much louder than it needed to be. A smile crept up his lips when he saw the time on the clock, the bright moonlight falling into the dorm. Luckily, it seemed that none of his roommates had heard the alarm.
As he kept his eyes on Harry, the aggression melted away and the concern he was feeling before overwhelmed him like a nauseous sensation in his throat. “Hey, what’s wrong?” he asked, sitting down beside him.
His hands trembled, almost aching to reach out to the brown-haired man in front of him. His heart heavy, he gulped, looking straight ahead. “Whoever you end up with is lucky.”
“Oh, that’s great,” Harry said, in more of a blank tone, and a slight smile. “Sorry I couldn’t make it.”
Draco looked at him, and for a moment, Harry was afraid he was going to get mad, but instead he leaned down and kissed him quickly. “You’re so sentimental,” he said, but he was smiling. “Can I read it?”
,” Lucius snapped. “You told me you’re over you… Potter phase.”
“So, Draco, are you really going to America for a case?” Hermione spoke up, giving her two friends the side eye as they reached for the glasses of milk to have with the cookies Molly left for them as a snack.
“Hi,” Draco replied.
“Okay,” he nodded, putting his hand to the other’s cheek. “One month.”
“Well…” Ron and Hermione exchanged glances.
“Mr. Potter, that is not your seat.” He stated loudly. This time, it was Harry who almost fell over at the sudden mention of his name. He slowly looked up and gazed questioningly at Snape.
“Of course,” he replied. “I had to. For you. How are you feeling?”
Draco's fake smile dropped. “I need you to know that I didn’t intend to kill him-”
“Harry!” Hermione said, jumping out of her seat and running over to pull him into a hug. Laughing, Ron stood up and joined the hug, both exchanging some quiet words. Everyone at the table was happy to see him, all letting out murmurs of excitement.
“You don’t need to,” his voice was shaky, following Harry’s gaze. “It’s pretty obvious.” He rolled up both of his sleeves. “No Dark Mark here, but do you want to inspect the rest of my body, too?”
“Do you know anything about me at all, Malfoy?”
Astoria Greengrass was kissing Draco Malfoy roughly, her tongue dancing in his, smirking as she did so. No, that wasn’t the worst part.
He had been betrayed again. It shouldn’t have hurt this much. Harry found it abnormal that he was just in so much pain.
Hermione completely let go of Harry, causing him to trip over his own foot, not expecting for her to do that. She rolled her eyes and sat down at the Gryffindor table and Harry clenched his fists in annoyance, turning to the Slytherin table, sighing at the Slytherins who were now laughing at him as he joined Hermione at the table.
Gulping, he reread the poem a few times, trying to understand what he had just read. Since when did Draco add hidden meanings to his poems? Hell, since when did Draco become so good at writing one?
“It was a bad idea,” he said.
“Oh, I really have to thank you. Draco was so unhappy until you came along, and now that you’re here, he really does seem happier-”
“I could never.”
Ron rolled his eyes in response. They entered the Great Hall and Harry walked straight ahead. Hermione had just started talking to Harry and Ron about a certain assignment they had for Potions.
“How could you possibly help?” Draco whispered, before biting his lip. “I don’t need your help. You would never understand.”
“That’s not what I asked,” he folded his arms, looking down at his lap. “How are you?”
charm…”
“Have
There was a sort of party going on today since it was a Professor’s birthday, so that’s where everyone was going to be for the rest of the night.
She wrapped an arm around him. “You’re right, I’m sorry. You’re not obligated to say yes to him. Let’s go up. I’ll make some hot cocoa for us while we talk.”They went upstairs in silence. Harry watched her make the hot cocoa. He offered to help, but she just told him to sit down and relax. “Well, now that you’ve said no, are you going to move on from him?”
“I’m fine, but thank you,” he signed, too busy eating to speak this time.
“See you on the other side, love.”
“I don’t think you have anything to be embarrassed about, as Pansy already sort of knew. Me, I had to make up a story so that Hermione wouldn't ask so many questions.”
“I’m so sorry, I’m not good at comforting,” Draco whispered, pulling Harry in close. Even this was a bit different now, but neither of them tried to think about that. “I better go soon.”
“You’re that close with your cousin?” Draco questioned.
“Nevertheless, eat slowly.”
“What are you girls whispering about?!” Draco snapped at the two. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I was showing Harry this bruise and-”
*******
Draco, by now, had taken the bottle from Harry’s hands and put it aside, staring intently at him, curious about what he had to say. “What do you mean you knew the pain he was going through?” He asked questioningly.
On that dull, Monday morning, Harry instinctively reached to put on his hearing aids, then quickly kept them back on his bedside table. He didn’t want to hear anything today. He wanted some peace.
“From… hearing? What about classes?”
The first thing Harry saw was someone in the corner of his eye. No, not just someone. He looked back down from the ceiling and at Draco, who was looking at him, a frown on his face. “Hey,” he said finally, while signing.
“I’m telling you, Malfoy’s behaving very strangely!” Harry started up again. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. “I was sitting next to him throughout the whole class! He’s got to be a Death Eater-”
“Harry-”
Harry and Draco pulled apart. “Let’s go, shall we?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand, who nodded. “Come on, Hermione, Ron.”
“I know it’s not my place, but…” he started, looking down at the pack of plasters that appeared on the table beside the couch. Picking it up, he shook the box slightly. Draco waved his hand as if to say no, and Harry found himself taking out a plaster, carefully putting it over the cut, carefully tracing his thumb over the swollen part of his face.
***EDIT: I CHANGED HARRY’S ANSWER PLEASE REREAD THE PROPOSAL SCENE IF YOU READ IT BEFORE! I decided things were moving too fast so they’re gonna take some time***
“But apple pie was Fred’s favorite,” she whimpered.
“I feel like you’re worrying for me too much and not letting me breathe,” he responded. “I get it. I’m deaf. But please don’t treat me any differently. You know I hate feeling like an outcast.”
Harry had given Draco another charm to add to his bracelet on his birthday, and dark green nail polish. Hermione had told him to give him the nail polish as a joke. Draco insulted it and protested that he wasn’t going to wear a ‘girl’s product’, however, thanked him and kissed him. It was cute, that amidst the chaos, sneaking around, and lying to each other for the sake of their conscience, lives, and relationship, they still had their moments together that made it all so worth it.
“Yes, Harry, I am. So please just tell me. This seems more like just a fight that happened,” Hermione said. She was now feeling nervous. If looks could kill, Hermione would have been long dead by now. But she contained eye contact with Harry.
He paused, rubbing his stubble. He hadn’t shaved in a few days nor even gone for Hermione and Ron’s New Year’s party two weeks ago.
“I’m not going into bed with you! Didn’t I just tell you? I have a boyfriend!” Harry protested loudly, which instantly made Draco actually feel relieved that there was loud Muggle music playing and people couldn’t hear him.
“Hey, Draco, you never told me. Why weren’t you on the train to Hogwarts in the first place?”
was a good idea--”
Draco Malfoy sat in his room in Malfoy Manor, sitting at his desk, reading a book.
“Well, why would you send me a poem meant for your mother?” he asked.
“I hate dancing."
“Do you have any idea how it feels? To see her disgusting, dry lips on yours. Her arms around your neck. And worst of all, to see you, your beautiful, soft lips, kissing her back, pulling her closer, even. I know I have no right to tell you who you can kiss and who you can’t, but fuck, it just…” Draco trailed off into silence, wiping his tears away, only to have more fall down. “...it
He put it on his left wrist, staring down at the tiny bird. It was a thoughtful, meaningful present. The bracelet actually suited him. He decided to keep it. It was too pretty to throw away.
“Very well,” Snape decided. “Mr. Zabini, please switch seats with Mr. Potter.”
“Christ?” Draco asking, blinking in confusion. “Well, whatever. Romilda Vane, that bitch better watch the fuck-”
“I’d rather not,” he groaned, but knew this was coming sooner or later. He looked around the common room, glad to see it was practically empty, then gestured for them to sit down. “We uh… we’ve been dating for two months now. Or were."
She gave Blaise a knowing look, following after Draco. “Whatever you say…”
Harry sat up in his bed, smiling weakly at Molly who handed him some soup and left him to be alone. They were all going to continue the dinner downstairs (Harry insisted that they didn’t need to wait for him). Hearing a knock on the door, Harry said a quick ‘come in’ and continued sipping the tasty mushroom soup.
Draco rolled his eyes, staring down at the ring on his finger, wondering why he was suddenly so close to tears.
“I would prefer to, you know,” Draco pushed his lips against Harry’s, “just do it again.”
is a good idea?” Draco asked outrageously.
“Your task was to kill Dumbledore,” he said at once. “You were set to kill Dumbledore?” Silver eyes met green ones. Dumbledore took a step back; almost as if he had been waiting for Harry to break out of the bind.
to be a Death Eater?
“Watch me,” Harry said with a grin, standing up and walking to the door. He turned and smirked slightly at Hermione. “Tell Pansy and Draco to leave my Invisibility Cloak on their way out.”
“Would you have left me for your health?”
“You can use this room for whatever you need. It can change depending on who’s asking for it. I said I needed a place to talk to you privately, so this room came. Not sure what the books are for,” Harry explained, sitting down on the chair.
Harry shook his head. “No, you’ve gotten me enough,” he said as Draco tried handing him another box. “I’m serious, Draco, the watch was more than-” he looked down as Draco opened the box, a pair of hearing aids inside.
“I’ve been studying with someone the past few weeks,” he blurted, holding his gaze to the ceiling, too embarrassed to even look at Pansy. “And my whole opinion on them is changing.”
“Yes,” Draco whispered hotly, which made Harry practically pounce back on Draco, carefully unbuttoning his silk shirt, then he slowly slipped off Draco’s pants, slowly trailing his hand on his inner thighs, teasing him slightly, before touching-
Harry found himself during his free period running to the Hospital Wing. Harry couldn’t help himself. He saw that Draco was asleep. He sat down on the chair beside the bed, slowly reaching and taking Draco’s hand, clutching it tightly. Harry studied him as he slept, breathing heavily.
Harry hurried over to the door to leave when he heard footsteps on the other side. He turned to Dumbledore who waved his arm as if to tell Harry to come back. Harry did so. He stood a little far from Dumbledore.
Every time they stopped for air, their eyes met, only for them to go back for another. It was as if they were the only two people in the world. Draco kept his hands on Harry’s face, too nervous to touch him anywhere else. His whole body was tingling and he felt Harry smile, which only made his heart leap more.
“Please stand up. Someone switch seats with Mr. Potter.” Snape looked around the classroom. Harry, confused, slowly stood up.
. Can’t you just undo the curse?”
“So, Draco,” said Lucius, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. “You haven’t been staying at Malfoy Manor for a while.” Draco could already see this conversation going in a bad direction - it was probably a record; they had gone five minutes into the meal without starting an unpleasant conversation. Lucius raised an eyebrow, waiting for Draco’s reply.
“Can’t be as slow as me trying to learn sign language,” he shrugged, and the two shared a small smile. “Just have a list of things you need help with ready.”
“I like it better like this,” Harry said, reaching out and running his hands through Draco’s hair. “It’s not nice when it’s gelled up. It looks better when it’s like this.”
But Draco was not smiling as their eyes met.
“How does my voice sound?”
“When do you ever?” Draco asked in an unsurprised, bitter tone. “Move out of the way.”
“I’m fine, just… God, I didn’t expect to see him today. I didn’t… mentally prepare for that,” he said, drinking the last of his champagne, setting the glass down to the side. Taking in a deep breath, he centered himself, then nodded. “Okay, let’s just… pretend we haven’t seen him yet. You know, he might not even come here.”
Hermione and Ron went into their usual bickering session and Harry only half-listened, finishing off his breakfast faster than them as usual and standing up to get to class. He had fifteen minutes till class started.
gosh who am i!! two updates in one week?? anyway, a bit of a shorter chapter, but y'know, it felt right, so here ya go! lemme know thoughts and stuff, i love seeing all of your comments!
Harry stared down at the letter from Ron and Hermione, pursing his lips together. He looked over at the person in bed beside him. He had already forgotten the man’s name. Sighing, he pulled a sweater over him, walking to the window, staring down at the streets of New York City.
He had to think about everything.
Although Harry had said it in even less than a whisper, those words still echoed in Draco’s mind as loud as possible.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy?”
“What? Why?”
Harry slowly looked down and saw Draco’s pale hand with a piece of paper. Harry looked up at Draco, but Draco wasn’t looking at him. He was pretending to take notes. Harry slowly reached down at took the note, propping up his textbook so he could read it properly. Harry hesitantly and shakily unfolded it.
“Oh, yeah, I do. It’s in fifteen minutes.” Harry lied smoothly. Hermione, who was staring at Harry, opened her mouth to speak. Harry gave her a pleading look to not say anything.
“Why?” he asked, and in response, Harry grabbed his hand and tugged him until he stood up. “What are you doing?”
“Everything okay?” came a voice from the doorway. Harry slowly looked up and turned around to see who the voice belonged to - it was Ginny. She was smiling softly, “I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation with Ron and Hermione.”
“Go. You’ll see me again before you know it.”
“Alright, alright,” he said, standing up, pushing his hair out of his eyes. Pansy quietened almost immediately, eyes slightly wide. “What is it? Captivated by my beauty?”
too soft. I can be really mean if I want to.”
!” Draco hissed. “Come on Pansy, I need help. I have no idea what to wear. No idea what snacks to take. I told him I’d bring food.”
Draco snickered, pushing his hair out of his eyes as his stony eyes finally met Harry’s. “You could say that again,” he murmured, then waved almost menacingly. “Can’t hear me, can you, Potter?” He raised his voice.
and Snape still took points away from Gryffindor,” he folded his arms.
- you know what? Forget it,” he held his head up high. “I’m just going to read from the textbook. You better get started with your Potions essay. I know you haven’t done it. It’s due on Monday.”
Pansy and Draco stopped short when they noticed Harry, who had a guilty look on his face. She gave her best friend a knowing look before walking off. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, then sighed. Better to address it, he thought to himself.
“I just didn’t see the point in anything for a while,” Harry mumbled. “Right, the coffee shop is just here.”
Pansy cleared her throat loudly, “Hey, Potters, maybe try not to be gay in the middle of the hallway?”
His stare was heavy, it was intoxicating, it was somewhat tense, but it made Harry feel at ease. He thought of his lips on Draco’s and felt his face heat up. There was no denying it now. The blond had definitely been listening to their conversation. Harry looked down, shaking his head, his face pink.
She was grinning from ear to ear. “Yes way!”
Hope you enjoyed!
“I’m sorry I let you stay there,” Harry answered, pulling Draco close to him, “I’m sorry I left you to stay there. I’m sorry I pushed you to tell me something you didn’t want to tell me.”
“I don’t see how it’s your business, but she’s fine,” he said firmly, expression hardening.
His lower lip quivered. “Harry, if this is too much for you-”
“Well, it’s pretty importa-” Draco was cut off by another kiss. Not that he minded.
Harry, still a bit disoriented, opened the letter, realizing it was from Dumbledore, asking him to meet him in his office immediately. He stood up, his senses coming back to him suddenly.
“Um… okay?”
“I got worried.”
With that, she left, shutting the door to her office behind her. Hermione and Ron both turned to Harry, who looked extremely frustrated. “How did she find out about this?” Hermione asked in a low voice, shooting a glare at Draco who was looking at her, frowning.
“It’s doing well, yeah,” he nodded, taking a sip from his drink, his eyes moving to Astoria. “I don’t think we’ve actually formally met, Astoria. I’m Harry.” He leaned forward to shake her hand.
“Just stop. Don’t you think you’re forcing yourself on him a little too much? Stop confusing him. Maybe you should focus on your wedding which is in one month,” Ron snapped, folding his arms. Draco gulped, looking away. “You know I’m right. Stop botherin-”
“Well… don’t.”
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Words of comfort.”
Harry mockingly waved his hand, as if to say ‘go ahead’. Draco stood up and slowly took a few steps towards Harry, who, with each step, started to feel more nauseous. By the time Draco reached him, Harry was struggling to keep his consciousness. Reaching forward, he gently touched Harry’s cheek, bringing it back as soon as they both felt it burn.
He sat down on one of the chairs, starting to cough, noticing there was blood. “Hermione, I-”
“Hey Potter, still deaf?” Draco asked as they both entered the Great Hall the next morning.
“I’ve been studying,” he said. “I really have.”
The sunlight shone on Harry’s face. Squinting, he got up to draw the curtains, only to stare out the window, his mind wandering back to Draco. It had already been a month since their “goodbye” date, but Draco was anything but away from his mind. Technically, he said he needed time, but still. Was it normal to think about him this much?
“Can’t argue with that. However, he’s treating me the same, so… I can’t say much,” he said, turning around and catching Draco’s eye, who rolled his eyes at him, then looked away and smiled to himself. “He’s… intolerable in the most tolerable way.”
“Shut up, Harry!”
The green-eyed boy slowly turned Draco around so he was facing him, raking his eyes over the other’s chest before stopping short, noticing the scars all over his chest. Harry slowly took a step back, laughing slightly as he put his hand out and traced one finger over one of the scars, jumping slightly when a memory hit him as soon as he touched the scar.
“The fact that you said it doesn’t make me look unattractive makes me think that it precisely does.”
“Beautiful eyes,” Harry murmured, still in a daze. “You have beautiful eyes.”
ruined absolutely everything!” Harry screamed, turning, getting out his wand and pointing it at Draco. Draco now sensed that Harry was about to do something. He lowered his wand.
“No, it was your scar,” he pursed his lips.
“You think I can?” Ron whined. “I can’t get rid of Lavender and this whole thing with Hermione… it’s just all a mess!”
Harry wolfed down his lunch.
“Ron! Ron, come here.” Harry called out. Ron, who had just finished putting on his school uniform, walked over to Harry.
“What?” Draco asked obliviously, “is there something on my face? Why are you staring at me like that?” Harry chuckled slightly.
Harry took in a sharp breath and slowly turned back to the table, sitting down and starting to eat. Around ten minutes later, Harry was almost done with his meal when he turned again, just to check if Draco was there. Sure enough, by now, Draco was sat in between Blaise and Pansy, picking at his food. He seemed to be listening to what Pansy was saying.
“Hey, Draco.”
He smirked. “Good.”
He must’ve fallen asleep, because he was suddenly being woken by Draco.
“You cursed Katie Bell…”
“No! No, it’s perfect, Draco. That’ll be awesome.”
“...it was stupid to let myself start liking him, wasn’t it? I was stupid,” he mumbled, resting his head against the window as he watched the mountains. “Of all the people, I had to go for the person that I’m supposed to hate the most. It was dumb.”
“Like what?”
“Now our robes are all tangled!”
What Harry didn’t hear was Draco’s silent sobs as he couldn’t bear to hear the sound of Harry’s voice breaking every time he came and talked through the door.
“Are you okay?” he asked, instinctively moving forward, pushing Harry’s messy hair out of the way and stroking his scar gently. Harry held onto his free hand, both calming down before screaming in surprise. “Why does it work like this?!”
“You find it hard to sleep?” Draco asked quietly, his silver eyes glinting with an emotion that Harry couldn’t decipher. Harry studied Draco’s white hair before slowly nodding.
“Focus on your own feelings,” she shook her head. “Allow yourself to feel everything. If it doesn’t work out, then it wasn’t meant to be. You don’t have to, but wouldn’t you beat yourself up not knowing what could’ve been?”
Harry quickly put an arm forward to stop Draco from walking any closer to Hermione. “Oookay, while this conversation has been fun, I only have a few hours left with Draco, so let’s just leave it, alright?” Harry interjected.
“Hey,” he said finally, and Harry stared down at his lap, unsure if he should answer or not.
“Do you think you can- oh!” he gasped as Draco lifted him up carefully then placed him down, just like the Yule Ball dance. “You did that quite well, I must say. Parvati wasn’t pleased with my skills as a date
“Did you mean it?” Harry whispered. “I’m the bottom line?”
Harry groaned but did as Draco said, crawling onto his lap in his new comfortable pajamas, giving Draco a very sloppy and wet peck on his lips.
Folding up the silly poem, he reached for his owl, who grabbed it and quickly flew away. Draco sighed, taking out the other one from his pocket, opening it, his heart dropping to his stomach. “No.
“Yeah…” he looked away, trailing off into silence, unsure of how to tell her that being a Death Eater would end their relationship on the spot.
Pulling his t-shirt down, he made his way to the kitchen, craving some tea. As he turned on the kettle, he leaned against the table, trying to ease his throbbing head by massaging his temples.
“Draco, it’s one in the morning. Don’t you think we’ve studied enough for today?” Harry asked, looking up at Draco, who looked aggravated that Harry was speaking again.
“Yeah, me too…”
“Thanks for the tip,” Draco sarcastically replied, giving him a mocking smile. The two sat in silence for the next five minutes, but Harry was too busy watching the blond in front of him scribbling onto a piece of paper to be reading. “Got it?” he asked, looking up.
Draco stood in silence, before nodding. “Yeah… yeah, okay.”
Harry cut Draco off by pressing their lips together, leaning forward only slightly, (after all, their lips were already quite close) tilting his head. Unlike the kiss before, this one was far more gentle; more sweet, and definitely calmer. Draco was surprised by the sudden change in emotion, but didn’t say anything; happy to kiss Harry back without questioning it.
“So you’re a bad liar
“Hello, Father,” he spoke, trying to speak evenly.
“When are you going to get it into your head that it’s impossible for me to hate you?” Harry took a step closer, his eyes threatening to let more tears fall. “When are you going to understand that every fucking time I see your face all I get reminded of is how I’ve only ever been happy with
He just about made it back up the stairs when he noticed Draco, who was shakily making his way up, quickly shouting
“Would you… stop being friends with me if I was gay?” he asked, voice shaky as he sat up slowly, wondering if she would hit him. She was the type to smack people if she disagreed with them.
“That’s… more of a rule for yourself, Draco. Rule four: you have to understand that sometimes I don’t want to talk about my dreams.”
“I was only curious of what you were up to! I knew you had changed when I saw you on the train. I had to see.” Harry explained without thinking. Their eyes locked for a few moments before Draco cleared his throat.
“You ruined everything.”
“Tell him to stop looking, then,” he responded, picking up the fork with his left hand, wincing slightly. It was hard for him to write or do anything, but surprisingly, the professors had not been informed of the fight, nor were they too concerned to find out. “I don’t want to look at his stupid emerald eyes.”
His eyes widened slightly. “Friends? I didn’t think you two were that close,” he commented. Harry watched him as he continued to write, mildly disgusted.
“You learn to tune them out,” he laughed, taking a sip from his drink. “Besides, I think every couple bickers. By the way, what made you have a party this year?”
a good idea!”
“The guilt, the pain, the hurting?”
He could only dream.
A knock on the door shot him out of his thoughts. He said ‘come in’, knowing it wasn’t his father, thankfully. Lucius usually knocked more sharply and loudly, the authority behind it clear. He smiled slightly at his mother, who shut the door behind her gently.
Draco stared down at the book in disbelief, shutting it before he could read any further. This had to be a practical joke or something of the sort. Everything was so specific, so… detailed. Draco quickly ran over to the mirror in his room, staring at the streak in his hair.
“But I didn’t even-” Harry started, but was cut off by Snape.
“Harry, calm down,” Draco whispered, seemingly unbothered by Harry’s outburst, “deep breaths, remember? Calm down, love.”
Harry woke up to the sunlight hitting his face - he had clearly remembered closing the curtains the night before, but Ron must’ve opened them. Harry looked around the blurry room, reaching for his glasses on the bedside table, getting a hold of his glasses and slowly putting them on.
Draco was wide awake, staring at the ceiling. His skin seemed dry, his lips were chapped. His chest was covered with the blanket, so Harry couldn’t see how he had been treated or anything. Harry stayed at the foot of the bed, simply staring at Draco.
He groaned rather loudly when she pulled the duvet off of him. “Come on! It’s eight a.m! We need to get you ready in time, alright? Faster, faster!”
“So… d’you forgive me?”
It was only natural that he was asked to be a Death Eater. Practically his whole family was. It was the most logical thing, and he knew it was bound to happen. This wasn’t something to mope over, or to be hurt by.
He scoffed in disbelief. “It was stupid coming to you. Crush? As if,” he stood up. “I’m going to bed. Goodnight.”
“You should’ve seen the look on Malfoy’s face. He looked so smug. I bet he’s boasting about it now,” he chewed on his lip anxiously, then stood up. “I’m going to bed.”
“Okay, are we done bickering for the day?” Draco asked as he took Harry’s hand, starting to walk into the forest.
“No, no, I’ll go get some myself,” Harry said with a slight sniffle, “Just… I don’t have any night clot-”
Hermione looked over to Harry, who was continuing to walk, unfazed. She finally nudged him when Draco said his name a third time. He stopped walking, confused, following her gaze.
“I knew that, of course. So I came up with a little something…” Lucius slowly got out his wand.  “I’m sure you know all about your little…
Draco stared at his father in disbelief. How unlucky did his fate have to be to be fucking related to someone like Lucius Malfoy? And the fucking nerve that his father had to look ever so proud of himself; as if he was doing such a great thing. In that moment, Draco wanted nothing more than to be stripped of his family name and be able to find a way to not be related to his father.
“Well, because I’m much better at Potions than you,” he said with a small shrug. Harry scoffed in response, but didn’t say anything, flipping over to the page. “How much of this powdered moonstone is-”
“Shut up,” Harry said, but he was grinning as he moved over and sat down on Draco’s lap. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
“You’re only fifteen, Harry, you can’t expect yourself to be fully equipped to fight a bunch of dangerous adults part of a cult,” he answered, then gasped. “Shit fucking fuck, it’s a cult, and I have to join it soon!”
“I would hex you.”
“I don’t know, actually,” Harry said, turning his head to face Draco. “Are you going home?”
“You know, there is one reason I’m glad I’m deaf, Malfoy,” Harry took a step forward, sizing him up. He was unsure of how loud his voice was or if his speech was comprehensible, but at that moment, he didn’t seem to care. “I don’t need to listen to any of your bullshit anymore. Though, four years was enough for your God-awful voice to come in my nightmares.”
Lucius Malfoy grabbed Draco by the collar of his shirt, pulling him closer.
He got out of bed, quickly getting ready, putting on the first pair of jeans and a sweater that he could find, brushing his teeth and sneaking out the door.
“Did it? Because all I remember is knowing you were supposed to kill Dumbledore, and not being able to do anything about it,” he snapped, guilt creeping up his chest when he saw the look in Draco's eyes. “I’m sorry. I'm sorry. It’s not your fault. It really isn't.”
“Yes?"
Gulping, Harry turned back around and tried to regain his composure, suddenly feeling lightheaded.
Harry felt as if someone had smashed his head against a window. He nodded, turning, putting the Cloak over him and leaving.
“Just seems like an ego issue to me,” Harry shrugged, smirking. “Did I hurt your ego, love? It’s okay. I can shake your hand now if you like,” he said, holding out his hand, letting out a laugh when Draco, defeated, simply smacked his arm away.
“You ready to pay, Draco?” Pansy asked as she ran a hand through her hair, looking over at him. “Come on, can’t you choose one thing for him? Don’t you know what he would like? You’ve been dating for like, three weeks now?”
,” Harry stood up too, tears streaming down his face. He reached out for Draco’s hand, who moved away. It stung him, but he stepped closer. “Please. Just-”
He got up and quickly got ready, going to breakfast with Ron, meeting Hermione at the Gryffindor as usual. He finished his breakfast quickly, then stood up and left, sneakily signaling for Draco to leave the Hall too.
The holidays for Harry were rather depressing, if not lonely. They had gone to visit Arthur Weasley who had been attacked, and he barely talked to anyone the whole time. The whole mood had been ruined by the visions that had been bothering him. Their first night back at home, Harry had gotten a ‘dream’ about Arthur through the eyes of the snake, and they had all rushed to the hospital.
Draco looked at him, a confused expression on her face, then cursed under his breath. “Pansy told me that you wanted to talk to me,” he shook his head in disbelief. “I did think it was strange that you asked her instead of just sending me a letter, but… whatever."
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t seem like something stupid,” he muttered, grabbing Draco’s hand. The two watched as a gauze bandage appeared. Harry picked it up and started wrapping it around Draco’s left hand, where the wounds were. “Hermione said my name was mentioned. I don’t want to assume, but…”
“H-Harry, don’t.” Draco was now on the verge of tears, and so was Harry.
Harry’s smirk faded, and his eyes turned to where Draco was standing. “No idea, actually.”
p.s CAN WE JUST PRETEND IPHONES EXIST IN THEIR TIME PLS THANKS
Harry stood up. “Do you think, my
Draco said nothing.
“You kept count?” Harry said as they exited the arcade. They had played almost every game, from gun games to air hockey, anything which didn’t require them to be too close to each other.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
So when he entered the DADA lesson, he slowly walked up to the front of the class, throwing his textbooks on the table and sat right beside Draco, using his hands as a pillow and placing his head on it, closing his eyes drowsily.
“Of course I have,” Harry said with a slight chuckle. “You’re my best friend’s-”
“You’ve been set to some work, Draco,” said Lucius Malfoy as he entered Draco’s room. “You were not there for the meeting last night. The Dark Lord was not pleased.”
The door opened and Draco entered. Harry let out a sigh of relief, sitting up. There was now a couch in their study room that was conjured up every time they entered the Room of Requirement.
“No, you did, Draco!
Draco, on the other hand, was freaking out.
Draco glared at him. “You’ll regret this, Potter.”
He gulped, then looked down, chuckling slightly. “Just because I said it that day doesn’t mean you have to say it too.”
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly, turning to Pansy. “Cho Chang,” he said in a somewhat disappointed tone, picking up the quill on his table.
“Harry, please. Go.”
“I’m sorry. I know I should’ve been honest with you, but… it was the only choice I had. I was already supposed to be mad at you, so... I just used that as the reason.”
Harry slowly turned and saw Draco standing there, who was slowly lowering his wand. Harry bit his lip and took Draco’s wand out of his back pocket, to show Draco.
“You say that with such a gloom on your face. Is it another Death Eater meeting?” Draco asked quietly. Narcissa slowly nodded, her blue eyes sparkling, with an emotion that Draco couldn’t read. Then, she turned and left, leaving her son to his thoughts.
“Hmm? Oh!” Harry snapped out of his dream, feeling a little embarrassed. “Sorry. Lost myself for a second. What were you saying?” Harry asked, turning a little pink as he sheepishly smiled at Draco.
“I prefer Scarface, Ferret.” Harry cut him off, winking and smirking. For the rest of the walk, they occasionally bickered but it was mostly silence and a lot of staring into each other’s eyes.
Draco looked up as his mother entered the room. He then turned back to the book he was reading.
“I don’t know, Hermione… I’m engaged. I don’t want my feelings for him to resurface.”
this is a bit of a long chapter.
Harry could feel something was wrong; right as the Hogwarts train started up. He frowned, biting his lip, staring out the window as he leaned his head on the glass.
“Why not?” asked Draco, starting to grow impatient. When Harry didn’t answer, he scoffed slightly, following his gaze to his arm. “Do you think I’m going to run off to tell my father about the dreams and visions you’re having? Is that it? You think I’m a Death Eater?”
He smiled at them gratefully. If there was one thing he could take away from all of this, it was that Ron and Hermione really did care for him. While it was disappointing to see not many others did, he decided he had to get over it and focus on the bigger issue - Voldemort.
“I think you’re better than most poets out there. You know, you kinda get straight to the point while still managing to have some hidden meanings in there.”
“...about how you’re feeling right now?” she raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you think he’d take it the wrong way? You know, maybe think it’s about him? Besides, I thought each poem had to be about how sorry you are.”
“What is it with you and ferrets?” Harry questioned, shaking his head. “It always comes back to ferrets one way or another.”
Harry was finding it hard to register what was going on.
“I think it’s a good idea to be with you despite all of that,” Draco shook his head. “Don’t you understand, Harry? With every mishap, argument, or fight, I never… I never truly stopped loving you. Even when you used that spell on me. Hell, it made me want you even more. Because I knew that it was my mistake-”
He opened his mouth to answer, but something had grabbed everyone’s attention. He followed their gaze.
“Thank you, Astoria,” Pansy said.
” Draco was at a loss for words. Harry simply nodded.
Pansy and Astoria nodded, watching as he left the store. He stared the shops around, but instead entered a new bar. He sat down after ordering a whiskey, staring out the window. Everyone else there seemed to be on a date. He tried to ignore the stinging in his chest.
“I wasn’t talking about me,” she stood up.
“What was that for?” Draco asked when Harry slowly pulled out of the kiss.
His smile faded. He set down his half-finished glass of lemonade, cracking his knuckles as he frowned. “I think… I should write to him.”
Draco and Harry were supposed to meet at noon by the lake.
“Very well, then,” Bellatrix said. “Send the prisoners down to the cellars. Except for the Mudblood.”
“It is,” he whispered.
It had been two weeks since Draco was practically captured to stay at Malfoy Manor.
“Did you just agree?”
The only way Harry knew this was because he found himself trying not to have tears down his face too.
They slowly reached the plain grass area where they had their first date the previous Saturday. Already feeling cold, Harry quickly got his wand out and started a fire. He slowly sat on the ground a bit further away from the fire and patted the empty spot beside him.
,” he cried out in anger, slapping him in the face, tugging at his shirt. “What did I ever do to you? What did I ever…” he felt tears stinging in his eyes, chest aching. “What did I ever do to…”
“Well, have you discussed anything with him yet?”
The aftermath was probably the worst for Harry. It was what gave him the most time to think. As he sat in the hospital wing, he stared into space while everyone was speaking to each other quietly. The atmosphere was tense. Hermione sat down beside him.
“I’m sorry, Draco, I really am,” Harry was chewing on the inside of his cheek, “I was friends with Cedric, and what happened to him… I don’t think I can ever forgive myself for not realizing sooner. Besides, it would hurt more with you because I love…” he quickly stopped talking.
“Right. And you aren’t throwing bricks at me yet?” Harry asked, turning to face Draco, slowly taking his hand and holding it again.
“Shh!” she put a finger to her lips, adjusting her dress as she stood outside the bathroom door. Even Ron seemed a bit excited to be eavesdropping on their conversation.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Not usually. Right now, a little bit. But I mostly feel regret for not doing anything. He had me immobilized. Maybe if I could’ve defended him if I wasn’t…”
“...would this be a bad time to ask you
the ending is a bit cringe but I'm gonna go with it. hope you like it! This is a long chapter lol
Draco wasn’t listening. He was too focused on Harry to be thinking or listening to anything else.
*******
telling myself that it was for the better. That we were better off not together. But… last month, our date… you felt it too, right? The warmth. I felt like I could…”
“If I could, I think I’d have punched you both by now,” he sighed, sitting down across from the two. “I thought the first five times we tested it would be enough for you to process, though.”
Harry looked at Draco who was still not looking at him.
“Oh, yeah, I understand,” Narcissa said with a nod. She awkwardly turned to leave. Just as she was at the door, she quickly turned to Draco. “Hey, Draco, please remember to use some sort of protection. I know it’s impossible for you to-”
The red-haired boy fumed, but nodded. “Fine. But keep your distance.”
“I’m full,” Harry said after taking a bite out of the food. Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry entered clumsily, pushing past the curtains.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, come play Truth or Dare with us!” Ron called out as Harry entered the Eighth Year Common Room. He looked up, seeing Draco sitting in the corner, reading a book, his white hair falling into his eyes - and suddenly, he looked up. Harry quickly looked down at his feet.
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“Stop signing,” the other said. Draco followed his gaze, which was to Hermione and Ron, who were both staring at him suspiciously. “Just talk to me normally. I can lip-read.”
“This is not a gift exchange sort of thing. I don’t want anything, nor do I expect you to give me something in return. I gave this to you because you’re my boyfriend and you deserve to be treated with love at random times by me.” Draco cut him off. All Harry could do was giggle slightly. “What? Did I say something funny?”
“Have I?” Harry asked, a smile still on his face, clutching his bag. “I’m just glad to be going home, you know, seeing everyone.”
- ash <3
Harry was about to say no - he didn’t need to associate himself with Draco on top of everything that was going on. But he had a moment of weakness staring into his eyes. Draco, for once, seemed vulnerable - helpless, even. Harry knew exactly how that felt. He turned, making his way to the door, but at the last second, he turned, shaking his head in disbelief, almost as if he didn’t believe what he was about to say.
“I think we’d end up on the first page of the Daily Prophet if we don’t. Besides, it’s safer for both him and me to not tell anyone. I think you’re the only one who knows about us, so…”
That night, Harry got out his map. He had searched the hallways before dinner but couldn’t find Draco. He hadn’t shown up to dinner.
, open up,” Harry had said on the fourth day.
Harry looked around. Mostly everyone had gone to Hogsmeade, and the younger years were keeping to themselves in secluded parts of the common room.
The two spent Draco’s wedding day very differently, but if there was one thing that was similar, it was the empty feeling in both of their chests, knowing that it was now there to stay.
“Then why don’t you, for once?” Harry asked.
A part of Harry felt really bad as he thought that.
“Hey, hey,” Harry cut him off in a gentle tone. “Calm down. You were talking too fast for me to lip-read, but I think I got the gist of it.”
“Whom to?”
“I tried fixing your hearing aids,” he sighed, bringing them up on the table. “I still feel horrible about what happened. I tried every spell I could, but…”
Draco nodded, his eyes cold. Harry knew that look all too well, and he couldn’t help but wonder if they had just reversed what had been six months of development in their relationship as Draco left the room of requirement.
Harry nodded eagerly. “Yes, thank you.”
And while he hadn’t even said yes, the two shared a smile before parting ways, because they felt alive again.
“Where’s Ron?” Harry asked.
He stared at him for a moment. “Okay.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Talent, my ass,” he fumed, standing up from the car race game, looking around the arcade. “Well, given that I’ve won most games today, I guess you sort of need this win for your self-esteem.”
“You would be too if you fought with your best friend,” he answered, yanking his hand away from Harry. His touch burnt, but unlike a scalding, sizzling wound, he found himself desperate for more. His fingers were soft, warm, gentle - caring. “Thanks, but you don’t need to worry about me.”
“Uh, yeah, so I’m going to go get ready,” Harry said after awkwardly clearing his throat, having to practically tear his gaze off of Draco, scratching the back of his neck.
Judging by the look on his face, Ron and Hermione both decided it was better to leave him be for the moment.
“Are you sure? I’m sorry, I’ve just been talking about myself, haven’t I. What’s up with you?” Harry asked. “Any Death Eater work I can help out with?” he joked.
“Don’t die,” Harry whispered, “not while I’m mad at you.”
“Well, uh, Arthur,” Harry gulped down the food he was chewing, setting his knife and fork down, clearing his throat awkwardly, “Draco and I are um… sort of, kinda, in… a relationship.”
It wasn’t that simple, not for Draco. He couldn’t just open the door, especially with Harry so close. Draco made sure that he was as far as possible from the door, not wanting to take any chances. ‘Too close’ for Lucius Malfoy probably meant being within the same room.
Hermione and Ron sat on either side of Harry, faces close to each of his ears. Harry, frowning, nodded slowly as the two started screaming at the top of their lungs. After a few moments of silence, he rolled his eyes.
“Mhm,” he hummed in response, turning back to his essay.
“We can get through it, can’t we?” his voice cracked as he took a step forward. “We always make it through. I don’t… I don’t want to marry her, Harry. I want you. Only you. If we could try this again, we could…”
“No. I don’t know,” he responded, feeling his eyes well up again. He hated crying; once he started, he just wouldn’t be able to stop. “We both said awful things. But the bottom line is, I wanted to be there for him, and he didn’t let me because he can’t trust me.”
“Tell me if you need help,” Draco said.
“Draco,” Harry said in a warning tone.
He looked up at his silver eyes, unsure of what to make of the emotions they held. “Today was fun.”
“It’s easier to hurt myself than see others get hurt because of me,” he said before he could stop himself. He shook his head. “Forget it. I won’t say this again. Just leave the issue alone. I’m fine.”
Draco thought of just leaving the book, but his curiosity got the better of him. After all, it had been roughly five months of wondering why the book could possibly be so important that Snape had to leave it for him.
“Nothing, you’re just… completely right,” she responded.
“What work?” Harry asked nosily, looking up at Draco. Harry was practically lying on top of Draco. The two were on Draco’s bed and so tangled up in each other that they didn’t even bother to move. “Like a job?”
The three hung out in the Gryffindor Common Room for most of the day. Thankfully for Harry, Hermione and Ron stopped bickering after the color incident, as he wished. But, he thought maybe he was better off when they were bickering because now he felt like an immense third wheel.
Harry slowly got off Draco, wiping his tears away as he sniffled slightly, looking up at the taller male. “Draco, let me be there for you,” Harry whispered softly, taking a hold of Draco’s hand.
, and how I’m making you sacrifice-”
They gazed at each other, smiling.
“You can’t control your father, and Sirius… it’s not your fault.”
Draco looked up, raising an eyebrow when he saw Blaise and Pansy approaching him. He stared down at the faded wounds on his knuckles, trying not to think about how gently Harry had wrapped the bandage around his hand. With an icy expression, he folded his arms.
“Draco! That’s horrible! Why didn’t you tell me?”
Harry looked over at Draco in disgust. “I hope you’re happy with yourself.”
“You know it isn’t,” Draco replied. “Harry. It just slipped, okay? I didn’t mean it like that.” Draco looked down at his left arm - he still didn’t have the courage to wear short-sleeved clothes. It was still full-length shirts, his Dark Mark tucked away neatly. People knew to not bring it up; to leave it be. Most just steered clear of Draco.
Draco didn’t even look at her, picking up the Daily Prophet. “Don’t look at me like that, Pansy, it’s terrifying.”
“Just… just give him five minutes,” Harry said. “Could you guys go get some food? Draco and I haven’t eaten in a long time.”
“Draco, I want you to forget about your father, okay? I used to try and distract myself with other things until I was able to address the issue without it upsetting me. I know that isn’t quite a helpful or the right way to go about things, but… it’s New Year’s Eve, and the rest are also going to start asking what’s wrong, and… and I don’t want you feeling like this, especially today…”
Pansy placed a hand on both of their shoulders. “I’ll be in the other room. Holler if you need anything.”
“Harry, I’ve got no choice!” Draco cried out. His wand was now pointing at Harry.
“Harry? You think you’ll be able to stay awake during this lesson?” Pansy asked quietly as she helped him sit down.
“I was just in the shower and forgot about the time, and-” she groaned. The three of them were too distressed to notice the doorbell ringing. “I ruined the Christmas dessert!”
I'm so, so sorry that this took super long to come out, but I had the absolute worst block that lasted for 2 weeks straight.
“Draco, it’s Monday,” she raised an eyebrow. Just as she was about to ask what had happened, he quickly left, practically running down the hallway. Too hungry by now, she entered the Great Hall, deciding she had more pressing matters to get to.
I can think about,” Harry snapped, standing up and towering over her. “Can’t you just leave us alone? Haven’t you done enough?”
“Ah, nice,” he said awkwardly. The two exchanged an uncomfortable nod.
“It’s your first date!” Pansy squealed.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco replied with an eye roll. “You know that I’m on your side, right?”
“How it’s possible to be so attracted to someone’s face when their personality is so shitty,” he responded. Draco pushed him back a little, and they stared at each other in silence until they burst into laughter, moving to kiss each other again.
“I mean, I kind of
He turned to look at her. “Knew what?”
“It can’t hurt to try, right?” Hermione asked.
“I’d prefer not to,” Draco said, grabbing Harry by his vest and pulling him closer.
His warmth was back, but still, Harry knew it wasn’t right. He knew Draco was safer listening to his father.
The two sat in silence as Draco took out his WSL book, trying to sign a few more words. He stared down at the book in confusion when he got to the phrase ‘can I help you’. Holding his hands up, he flinched when Harry reached out, then relaxed a bit. “What are you doing?” he asked.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were learning sign language to communicate better with Harry,” she smirked. “Look at all these notes! You’d think you were taking this as a second language.”
The corners of Draco’s mouth twitched. “What are
Draco felt his insides lurch. Watching Harry was breaking him.
“They say a good way to relieve stress is to dance,” he said, leading Draco to the open space near the tables. “So I think we should dance.”
Happy reading!
With everything in him, Draco took a step back from Harry. “Go, darling. Before I change my mind. Because it’ll be bad for both of us if I do.”
Ginny Weasley was running up to Harry, her long red hair flying behind her, as she slowly came to a halt right in front of him.
“Looking for you. Why aren’t you coming to lunch?” she asked, folding her arms. “Seriously, you’ve been acting weird lately. I’m a little worried about you. You disappear on Friday evenings, and you were gone today too.”
“I was just asking how you and Malfoy are going to be dating this year,” she asked, running a hand through her hair. “Are you going to be using the Room of Requirement?”
The two, their faces streaked with tears, locked eyes.
“But what if
Was loving someone a choice, or was it this dread that crept up on you while you slept? Loving Draco wasn’t dreadful. It was something Harry was afraid of. He was afraid of what he’d do if he lost him. But love wasn’t supposed to make you feel afraid, was it? It was relieving to realize that he wasn't the only one afraid. And maybe that's what made him tap his watch three times as a confirmation.
“Don’t these strands of my hair look white to you?” Harry asked, turning to Ron, keeping his hair pushed back to show him.
“Then let’s test it. This has got to be at least six,” he replied, motioning towards the distance between them as they started walking. He stepped a little closer to Draco. “That’s about five. I don’t feel nauseous, nor do I see any blood, so I guess that’s good.”
Pfft.. hey, guys... it's been a while... There's probably not many of you left, but I hope you all are safe and well! Here's another chapter (good luck remembering what this fanfic was even about)! Happy reading!
“Shh,” Harry whispered. “For now, just stay with me.”
“No, it’s no big deal,” Draco said though the tears were already spilling down his face.
“Listen, Harry,” Draco said, “I don’t think you should be taking out your anger at others.”
“What was that all about?” Pansy whispered to Harry, who shrugged.
He stared at his best friend, then sighed. “Okay. Fine.”
She rolled her eyes. “So only Harry can call you honey?”
Harry held up the necklace. “Help me put it on?”
Draco shrugged, and the other started walking, leading him up the stairs. They made their way to the Room of Requirement. He could feel tears threatening his eyes again, but tried to hold them back as Harry sat him down on the couch, rubbing his hand up and down Draco’s back.
“Yeah, um… she fell sick last year and lost her hearing a few months ago,” he spoke, chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. “That’s why I was asking you for lessons. Anyway, uh… now that she lost her hearing, I thought she would get better, but… my father said it comes and goes. I’m just… worried.”
