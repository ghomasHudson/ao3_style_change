Harry stepped inside, trying to keep his movements slow. These fucking bastards… He heard some movement beside them that caught their attention, and in the next second the taller one shot Harry a relieved grin.
Please don’t pity me, you know
. The choking feeling was back with new force, and after a few seconds of silent gaping he felt like he was suffocating. Hermione was looking at him hopefully and it was torture. He really could, he could do it, they meant so much to him and…
“No. I will stay here.”
“That was mutual.”
“Yes, okay, saved me some more, are you waiting for a medal, Potter?” Malfoy grimaced in irritation, maybe a genuine time, Harry couldn’t quite tell.
Harry heard steps behind him. He opened his eyes but didn’t turn. The steps hesitated and then moved to him confidently. As they reached Harry’s side, Harry looked to his right and up.
Harry watched him go several steps further in the snow. It was beginning to darken as the evening was close and the snow intensified. Harry shivered from the cold. Maybe he should ask Hermione for good warming charms, the ones he knew weren’t that strong.
“Well, yes,” she told him, unsure. “I saw him a few times. Why?”
Harry frowned.
Something hit Harry in the chest, leaving him sharply exhaling. And he remembered with a somehow familiar shock of recognition. This is a dream. The excitement shot through him and Harry shivered. Their meeting. Harry wiped away the last shock (he would never get used to the feeling of sharp transition from the dream to the realisation of that dream) and new hungrily inspected Malfoy (no,
“Mr Potter, she won’t be arriving just on your behalf, you have to understand. We had a chat with Headmistress McGonagall and she decided it would be good to have therapy available for any student in light of recent events… You just made us notice and act on it.” She smiled.
It was a feeling strangely welcoming, in a way that was never fully understood. Nonetheless, it kept coming.
The Hufflepuff guy, Wayne, seemed nice. He had dark blond hair, a big nose, and heavy glasses. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, not saying anything to him, and Harry was thankful for that. Neville was familiar and great to talk to, or, rather, listen to as he told Harry all about his new fascination with a species of plants they we’re going to learn about this year. Harry smiled and nodded along, grateful Neville didn’t expect him to say anything.
They sat in silence for a bit, but Harry didn’t think Malfoy was waiting for an answer. It didn’t feel like it, and Harry liked the feeling. The last light of the settled sun was starting to dissolve and he felt a chilly wind through the warming charm.
Madam Pomfrey was telling Hermione something.
And that makes me all the angrier seeing you
Draco just grimaced and averted his eyes, looking into the forest around them, even more dark and unfriendly. It was getting cool, the ozone cracked in the air, the sounds around died down again, giving way to heavy silence before the rain. The clock pounded louder with every passing second, painfully pressing into the head. Harry felt that he would wake up soon, everything began to slowly blur along the edges. He stubbornly looked at Draco, absorbing every detail, swearing this time to remember everything, but he knew this was doomed to failure.
You draw away after a bit. We look at each other. I don’t know what you see but I see everything I ever wanted. I huff out a laugh.
“Wanna fight, Ferret?” Ron’s face was red with anger. Harry grabbed him by the elbow as Malfoy brushed past.
“Harry— Harry, where are you going? Harry!”
"What did you do?" Harry scowled, he felt like there was something and he probably wouldn't like it.
.’ Which wasn’t true.
“I would give anything to remember what happens in reality when I'm here,” Draco said bitterly, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them.
Harry got up quickly, hid the map and hurried out. His uniform was in the changing rooms (he asked Ginny, who was the captain of the team, for a place to keep them and she agreed). He broke into a slight jog when he was in the last couple of corridors. There weren’t a lot of people in the halls and that was good because Harry didn’t want to imagine how ridiculous he looked right now.
Harry opened his mouth to say that yeah, he was fine, but something caught in his throat. He cleared it and tried again, but nothing came. He wasn’t fine, he realised. And he couldn’t get his bloody throat to work to say that he was iI was an easy thing to say, so easy. Pomfrey was looking at him.
“Anyway, so I actually like the night sky now, I’m not afraid of it.” Malfoy looked away from Harry and started talking again. “I mean, what idiot would be scared of that? I’m actually taking Astronomy as a NEWT this year, I could draw a map of all the constellations in my sleep for fuck’s sake. Did you know the brightest star in my constellation is called Eltanin? A nice name if you ask me. Also…”
When they were out of the warm Hall, Draco hadn't stopped, turning towards the dungeons, not looking at Harry... After a minute of the fast pace, Harry started to feel confused.
Then Malfoy was near and holding Harry’s face. His hands shook and eyes burned.
‘Again’ hung in the air but Harry was quite sure both of them heard it. He felt embarrassment crawl up his skin.
“I’m terribly sorry, Potter, I had an impression your attention was reserved for people well above my rank, all this lovely crowd around your shining frame?” I have no idea what I’m talking about. “Just lovely, this evening, isn’t it?”
,’ Harry wanted to say, to object, to whisper, but he couldn’t. ‘
She smiled reassuringly and knocked at the door. Harry took a breath and after a bit the door opened. The woman standing there looked about the age of Madam Pomfrey, with light hair collected in a tight bun and big round glasses. She looked at Harry and smiled, wrinkles appearing around her light blue eyes. She had a nice smile, Harry decided.
It was so quiet in here. His mind jumped feverishly from the dark entrance of the passage to the ‘it’s my fault’ and then… Harry remembered shaking hands on his face and an accidental embrace and a tingling feeling of someone else’s magic under his fingers, flaming stubborn eyes and a trace of blood from the lip.
He often saw it in the nightmares, with its haunting shadows, quiet but always-present hum, which one doesn’t notice before they left the forest. Harry shivered, he didn't like the place the whole lot. But now for some unknown reason, the thick atmosphere was causing not fear but strange heavy calm. Before now Harry didn’t know it was possible to feel that way at all. This calm pushed all thoughts and concerns away and Harry made a step forward. He realised that he was supposed to find something -
After a bit Malfoy shrugged. “I always found you talking annoying though, so it’s fine.”
“I wrote that Valentine song,” unexpectedly comes out of my mouth. Shit.
Harry felt nervous all of a sudden. Would he have to speak? They would probably talk about the war. Harry felt slightly dizzy.
Malfoy crossed the hall to one of the empty beds in a few strides and crouched over the bedside table. Harry heard glass bottles clinking.
Hermione seemed satisfied and Ron quickly switched his attention to the breakfast that appeared on the table. Harry looked up to the enchanted ceiling just to find slow, fresh snowflakes shimmering from the grey clouds. It hadn’t been snowing since the last time Harry went flying. He glanced at Malfoy. And found him looking up as well, a strange expression on his face. Harry swallowed. Yeah, it was the same Malfoy he saw last time in the snow after all.
Harry simply couldn’t stand his friends.
Harry looked at the lake, so light still with the reflection of the sky.
“I don’t see how it’s any of your business,” he barked. It was surprising how spiteful he could be barely standing on his own. Or not at all surprising, when Harry thought about it. Harry tilted his head to the side, not feeling the desire to snap back. He had a feeling he didn’t have to say anything.
Hermione grew serious and started a tirade about how they needed to keep together, how the house system wasn’t really great and how they needed something new after all that everyone had been through. Ron looked more regretful with every minute, which was probably because he started the argument in the first place.
“Yeah.”
“This is pathetic” Draco smirked but his eyes were dangerously shining.
Mrs Wright seemed to sense his confusion and smiled again.
Harry nodded, feeling weary again.
Harry woke up on the hospital bed some time later. He didn’t open his eyes because he wasn’t sure there was something out there beyond his head, just existing. He felt lost in a wrong time.
Harry nodded, not at all listening to what Hermione was talking about on their way to the castle in the carriages. His mind was dizzyingly empty, flitting from one thought to another. Some trees were damaged. The blue twilight looked cold and beautiful. The thestrals looked the same as ever — a little bit dead, a little bit mournful. The sound of the squeaking carriages soothed his raw nerves. Harry was almost certain Hermione’s voice was part of it.
They kept finding each other. Harry had no idea how Malfoy was doing it, because Harry was simply looking for the most isolated places. Maybe they had the same idea. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy beaten again but he saw once how some students were whispering as he walked down the corridor with telling scowls on their faces. And so they kept spending time either walking on the grounds or in the abandoned classrooms.
“But it’s
Her shoulders lowered and her gaze turned away from Harry’s. Yes, it was the wrong subject to bring up. The silence stretched on, obviously agreeing with him, mockingly filling his ears and pushing in with sickening thickness.
The water licked the shore hesitantly, swaying back and forth, back and forth with the smallest of waves. It was cool and dark.
He grabbed a handful of wet snow, made it into a messy ball, and threw at the git. It hit him right in the face.
Harry shook his head, retrieved his wand and wrote two words in the air.
His head wasn’t thrown back as the previous time and Harry couldn’t see his face which caused a bit of disappointment prickle at the back of his mind. Well, he always could fly a bit to the side without being noticed…
They reached their room just as Malfoy was leaving it, the look on his face full of challenge when he caught the sight of them. Harry and Ron stopped. Ron stiffened and opened his mouth to say something but hesitated when Malfoy slipped his eyes to Harry.
I walk out to the cool September night, the noise of the ballroom dying out considerably. You don’t turn to see who I am.
“You—!” Malfoy sounded so shocked from an assault that Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
After a minute or so, Harry finally saw the figure. His stomach gave an excited surge as he lowered his broom further to Malfoy, who stood with his back to Harry.
"You are right Luna. Now everyone will get to know about you-know-who. But they will also get to know about DA. What are we going to do about that?" Ginny asked.
"If you don't mind I can explain you all the things we know. And then you can add."
We know you are dumb as a dodo which is like insulting the dodo but anyways. This is a letter, I'm sure you can guess that. This letter is sent to help you. If by any chance you have some self prevention, you'll go to Hogwarts and announce them that you will be reading some books. Leave rest to us we will handle it .
The Slytherin blushed again and tried to get away from him, but Harry was faster and soon Draco was caged between a wall and a sturdy chest. His escape was blocked by a pair of hands that hugged him from both sides.
"Mr. Potter, care to explain what's going on here?" Professor Flitwick asked. He too was surprised to see the unusual group but as there was a Ravenclaw present, it was his responsibility as the head of house and he intended to do that properly.
"Don't worry mate. We will get out of this. We always do, don't we?" Ron said smiling. "Oh,come on! This light is being the most irritating thing now," he exclaimed as there was again the same light and again a new note carried with it.
"I swear Harry I'll never want to do this to you. I'm really sorry." Harry hugged her. "I know Gin. I believe you."
Sitting beside him was Harry who couldn’t be more excited. His Godfather was free and his parents were with him. His day had started bittersweet. Waking up with his family but then having to share the situation at the Dursley's... Oh, he knew, he had to go through it again and this time his parents would be there. Also, there was the addition of the Malfoy's and Snape. And then there was Draco. His family had said it was true, and how he hoped it was! If it were to be true, then he and Draco... Well, let’s not think about it, for now. But if you ask him, he'd not change this for World.
"So…"
Around the wizarding world many changes were occurring by the said blue light. But no one would notice that till the next day.
"What? Sevvie boy?"
Ron and Harry avoided looking at each other, Hermione had her face in her hands and Neville burst out laughing.Ginny looked at him compassionately.
Hey guys,
“No”.
About the guest: they are who they say they are. You can confirm it by the truth serum.
"Figures your children will be the cause of chaos."
"Of course, anyone would be better than you… A Malfoy. And Harry needs someone who is studious and smart. Not a Slytherin…"
It was getting late and Draco was the only one who had yet to return. His parents and Godfathers had gone to bed. So were all the children from the future. The Slytherin head couldn't be with them as he had his work. Soon, Harry assured the Malfoys that he'd go to search for Draco and sent them to bed too.
It's our vow and so we swear,
All the people around them kept looking dumbstruck. Teddy smiled at them mischievously .
Finally they moved, entering the great hall together and shutting everyone up quite effectively. Harry looked around, noticing the new people arrived. Present were with Hogwarts' professors, Minister, Madam Bones, Percy Weasley, Andromeda Tonks, Ted Tonks, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-eye, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall who was now recovered, Hagrid, Weasleys, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy and to everyone's amusement very scared Umbridge.
There was a sudden hush in the great hall after the arrival of this group. After all 7 new people were with them and their ex professor and a dog. Every eye was solely fixed on them. Scorpius stepped forward .
other than that- Stay safe people!
Next update will be slow
Thank you for your patience.
"Come on Moony, after everything you have heard, you ask this?" Sirius laughed.
“I haven’t done anything!”
" Ok. I'll go first. I'm Theodore Remus Lupin , son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks , godson of Harry potter, Ravenclaw. And no dad, I'm not a werewolf."
"It's OK Theo, you don't have to sing. Just come up here, for me," Luna whispered as if talking to a frightened animal.
„Oh God, Draco,“ Harry‘s voice was a broken whisper.
Harry whirled around and reflexively pressed a tip on his wand against Draco's pale throat. Harry breathed out in exasperation and forced himself to relax. Draco would surely drive him mental one day with his jokes and stunts. He lowered his wand and cast a mild Stinging Hex inconspicuously on Draco's bum.
I need your help. I have created a form and I would like you guys to fill it out. This is for the story.
" I'll take it from now if you don't mind, Scorp." Teddy said. Then looking at Madam Bones he added, "We would first like to prove ourselves So can you please arrange veritaserum..."
~○~○~○~○~○~
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm Albus Severus Potter
"Oh but you are going to. Remember the books,  Padfoot?" Remus reminded him.
Thanks for the help:)
Lily interrupted their goofing, “Focus guys. And do your work properly.  Can't you be serious once? And I'm warning you, Sirius, don't you dare...”
As unspeakables will prove that the books are true so everyone will have to agree about Voldemort.
Neville placed hand on his shoulder and gave a brotherly squeeze, trying to calm him down.
He just turned to look at the Malfoys " Hey Luc, why are you just standing there? Come on join us" Sirius and Remus gaped at him.
"Blimey, Harry, what did Sirius give you? "
As he was sure there were people who knew the truth, the ones who would protect him with everything, Sirius calmly went with Kingsley, allowing him to guide him towards the make-shift custody at the main table. He sat there without a fuss and let the Auror give him the truth serum. Everyone held their breath while they waited for the serum to take effect.
It was a sweet promise between both of them. Promising a future, a bond and something more. But for now, they were happy having each other.
"Hello hogwarts! And students of Hogwarts of course. "
Don't worry about your adventures as you can say about them. You won't be punished. So many things are going to come in light that they won't even have time to think about it.
Sirius and Remus sat there being as supportive as they could. Twins had stopped all their jokes choosing to sit beside Hermione and listening silently.
Ginny broke down again after hearing this.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione ,"See, I told you. It's not me. It's the potter genes."
The said mad man was fully enjoying himself. He was sitting with his favourite godson (being the only one didn't count) and his best mates. Though one was supposed to be dead and one turned furry each month, he would not want to change them for the world.
After gasping, Neville said, "I know what that is, Harry. They are two way mirrors. If you say the name of a person in it, you can speak with him with the help of these", He said. Not sure of himself, Harry held the mirror and clearly spoke 'Sirius Black' in it. After a second or two he was able to see his godfather's cheerful face and everyone visibly relaxed.
Harry and company stood there gaping as Sirius went to kneel beside Lucius.
Here everyone present shared a smile . Luna serenely looked at Harry, "It must be nice to have friends, don't you think Harry? I've always imagined how it would be. No one liked to be friends with Loony you see."
“I see a boy who is used to suffering, who isn’t afraid to risk anything for the ones he loves, who is brave and honest and loyal. But most of all, I see my kiddo, my son whom I left, who I want to be loved and cherished, who I want to protect with all my strength. I see the baby that loved to ride my bike, who happily squealed when he got his first broom or his stuffed dog. He is my baby whom I love.”  Sirius said all this in a soulless voice, but that didn’t mean it lacked the emotions that were being said. All the time while Sirius was speaking Harry had covered his mouth to avoid sobbing loudly. He felt as if a big burden was being lift-up from his shoulders. Though he had not said anything but Harry was also being affected by the opinion that Sirius saw him just a replacement for his father. But here was the proof that this was not true at all. All this time, he was seeing him as his son, jut as Harry saw him as a father-figure.
Draco felt a wave of warmth spreading through him, accompanied by a pleasant tingling sensation. It must have been really hot inside the club, Draco thought, for him to feel as if he was subjected to a heatwave tearing through his body.
"I saw you at the bar yesterday," Smith said slyly. "It seemed you were having a good time, groping the bloke. I was worried you would choke him with your tongue for a bit there. Had a good fuck?"
"Voldemort?" Harry asks without thinking.
"Pretty, pretty please," Potter moved closer to Draco and blinked those ridiculously long eyelashes several times.
"Harry, please," Kingsley Shacklebolt reached out a hand and placed it soothingly on Harry's shoulder. "If we assembled a full team of Aurors, the investigation would move faster."
They had returned from the hospital two hours ago. Narcissa joined them for dinner in Grimmauld Place, then politely excused herself when Harry started yawning. He caught barely an hour of sleep last night and spent the whole day watching over Draco. Narcissa tried to persuade Harry to go home and have a nap but he wouldn't hear of it. He stayed by Draco's side, fussing over him and generally annoying Draco with hundreds of questions. Are you comfortable? Does anything hurt? Would you like anything? I will just quickly go to the toilet and be right back. Will you be OK alone for a bit? Are you thirsty? Do you want me to fluff up your pillows a bit?
"We broke up," Harry shrugged. He couldn't care less about another failed fling. Harry was starting to realize that no one but Draco would ever be good enough for him. "Why are you asking? Are you jealous?" Please be jealous, please be jealous, Harry thought to himself.
The house itself was an old Victorian mansion, some of its windows were boarded shut, others broken. The glass gleamed in the moonlight threateningly, like sharp teeth of a basilisk. The front patio seemed deserted, except for an old rocking chair moving soundlessly in the wind. The building appeared to be deserted too but Harry couldn't shake the feeling someone was watching him. It made goosebumps run across his arms and spine. Davis Apparated beside him and touched his arm to let him know she was there. Tracey was the last Auror scheduled to appear on the scene, which meant they were ready for action.
"You're falling apart and you've ruined my best silk blouse. All of that because you don't love him, my arse! So what you don't remember spending time with him, you are obviously still head over heels for him. You wouldn't be sitting here, sobbing like a bloody Hufflepuff if you didn't love him. You've had a crush on him since the fourth year, I'm pretty sure that it didn't go away! Now, did it?" she pushed him toward the fireplace.
"Fuck," Harry cursed under his breath. Colin's brother, Dennis Creevey, meant well but his emotions got in the way of his job sometimes. Especially when dealing with escaped Death Eaters, who were directly or indirectly responsible for his brother's death. In Harry's opinion, Dennis should have been demoted to a desk job after the botched kidnapping case.
Harry considered him thoroughly. He was confused by Malfoy's contradictory behaviour. On one hand, he was acting prickly as usual, on the other, Harry could feel an underlying concern in the tension of his body. Malfoy didn't seem to be refusing Harry out of spite or old rivalry. He seemed to be genuinely sincere if Harry looked deep enough. He felt as though he could see the real Draco peeking through, a person he always wanted to get to know for some odd, masochistic reason if only Malfoy let him. Harry decided honesty was his best policy at the moment.
"Come on, who would want to touch a little shit Death Eater like him?" Smith snickered.
"Let's see what the ghost does. I would prefer to find out where the Source is first. Once we locate it, we'll draw the ectoplasm into the vial Hermione had provided us with. Then we'll disable the Source."
Draco gaped at him incredulously. "Oh my God, Potter, you truly are thick. I've always thought playing stupid must have been part of your strategy but you really are bloody thick. Let me spell it out for you, you lamebrain twat. We can't use magic. How are you going to see in a dark cellar, if you can't cast Lumos?"
"It's not my fault the floor here is practically a battlefield. You try walking across it without making a noise, moron," Harry shot back.
The presence of the darkness seemed infuriated, it felt more oppressive, and pushed forcefully against Harry's Lumos, trying to douse the light completely. He felt as if the darkness was suffocating him, its cold grip reaching for his throat, trying to restrict his airways. Harry focused his mind, wrapping himself in a protective blanket of concentration. He needed to push through. The first step toward McLaggen was the most difficult one, the next one easier, and the next easier still. The darkness raged around him, desperately trying to devour Harry, like waves in a raging, stormy sea would try to swallow up a meager barge. The silence was penetrated by a cracking sound. Harry tried to calm his breathing, to hear the noise better. His free hand reached for the second adrenaline shot at his belt while his eyes and ears desperately tried to locate the source of the sound. He crouched next to McLaggen's unmoving body, his eyes still fixed on the darkness around him. The cracking sounds were growing louder now, they were coming from directly above him. Harry couldn't see the ceiling but suddenly, he felt something fall down onto his shoulder. He yelped and jerked away. He could see bits of plaster falling on top of him and all around him.
"I want you to shadow me, Pans," Draco ignored her question and instructed her in his firm
„See you later,“ Harry pouted at Draco. He already missed him and Draco hadn't even left yet. Harry knew he was fucked but rather enjoyed the feeling. Finally, his life was turning out for the better. Finally, he was getting what he‘d always secretly wanted from life. He loved his job, he had his own house with no irritating Muggle relatives in it and most of all, he had an amazing partner who loved him with every breath he took. Harry thought that maybe, just maybe, life really was about balance. He‘d spent the first eighteen years of his life stressed out, being despised by the Dursleys, Voldemort trying to kill him on several occasions, chasing Horcruxes. Maybe now, his reward was eighteen years full of love, happiness, and excitement with Draco by his side. Harry certainly hoped they would last for more than eighteen years.
"Why not?" the corners of Potter's mouth turned downwards.
Draco stared at their joined hands incredulously. He allowed himself a second to enjoy the warmth of Potter's skin against his. There weren't many opportunities like these and he meant to savour every single one of them.
"Haha, very funny. I told you before I left not to let him go alone. I know you hate going out at night but if something happens to him and neither of us is there…" Theo left the sentence unfinished.
"Ten degrees," Harry checked his thermometer and looked at Draco anxiously. "What does it mean?"
„I have no secrets from Harry,“ Draco sneered in Harry‘s direction. He couldn‘t resist the jibe.
„Come on, Malfoy, what‘s the matter?“ Harry started slowly riding him. He leaned back and rested his elbows on the desk behind him. He propped his feet on the leg rest of the chair and started bouncing up and down on Draco‘s prick. His own cock was hard and glistening with precome. It was making obnoxious sounds as it slapped against Harry‘s stomach. „Don‘t you like it when I touch your wand?“
The Aurors had learnt the hard way over the past months that the newly risen ghosts could not be destroyed by magic. Spells passed through them easily, potions didn't seem to affect them in the slightest and all the curses and hexes in the world couldn't save you when you faced a spectre. They also found out that when a ghost touched you, you died a painful death within minutes. So far, there was no cure. Many good Aurors died in vain and the Ministry of Magic seemed to be in a state of upheaval. Harry tried to force them to take action, to make the Unspeakables research ways to kill the ghosts, if they could be killed, or find means to combat them. However, all the Ministry seemed to be doing was debating and discussing the Problem, as it was now called.
"Auror Malfoy," Robards said, surprise evident in his face. "May I help you?"
I got back together with Ginny because I felt like I was supposed to. Everyone expected it of me and I was lost. It seemed reasonable at that time. I loved her as a sister and thought that was how one was supposed to love their girlfriend. There was never any passion between us and the relationship felt dead. It took me a long time to realize that I would never love any woman in any other way but platonic. Even after I admitted to myself I liked men, it took me a long time to break up with her. I was too scared to lose one of the few people I had left in my life after the war.
"Who's the negotiator on shift, Sir?" Draco asked.
"Potter," Draco sneered.
"You went first the last time," Draco said lightly, even though his heart was pounding in his chest rapidly. "It's my turn now. Can't have you steal all the glory, can I?"
"What the fuck, Draco," Pansy shouted and glared at him as she
"That is amazing, Hermione! You really are the smartest person I know," Harry beamed at her proudly. "I can't wait to tell Draco."
Harry could feel the fabric of his T-Shirt getting soaked with her tears. He rubbed her back with his palm in soft, slow circles.
„Your wish is my command,“ Draco moved lower and scraped his teeth across Harry‘s collarbone. He let his tongue follow the bone up to Harry‘s shoulder, then trailed feather-light kisses down his pectorals. His hands caressed Harry‘s ribs up and down. He took a nipple in his mouth and sucked at it, traced it with his tongue, then pulled back and blew air over it. It earned him a loud gasp and he felt Harry‘s spine bow under him. How he loved Harry‘s gasps and the soft shuddering sighs he made when aroused. Draco focused again and kissed along Harry‘s flank, replacing his hand with his mouth. He came to a halt at the secret spot he had discovered on Harry‘s body, just under his right hipbone, where it almost met the thigh. He licked the skin there in a single, long line, repeating the movement several times. His cock jumped when Harry moaned out loud and his hand sneaked its way into Draco‘s hair.
„Eleven? What are you talking about?“ Draco asked, blinking rapidly as if confused.
Harry smiled at him gratefully and stroke his cheek with his thumb in a familiar gesture. "That's not the whole truth," Harry sighed. "Before Draco got home, my ex-girlfriend, Ginny Weasley stopped by. She told me she saw Draco cheating on me three weeks prior. I honestly lost it, I trashed the whole place, I went mad for a bit there. Draco got home around eleven. I was already calmer by then but then when Draco said he was too tired to talk to me and he didn't even know it was so late… well, I thought he was lying to me and I exploded."
The flames flared bright green and Draco stumbled out of the fireplace. Harry jumped up from his position on the floor. It was nearly 11 PM, he‘d been waiting for hours for Draco and his temper was starting to flare again.
„I was an arsehole back then, I‘m sorry,“ Draco fidgeted sheepishly in his seat.
A bottle of lube landed in Potter's hand who opened it and passed it to Draco wordlessly. Draco dipped his fingers in the oily substance and smeared a generous amount around Potter's puckered hole. Potter hissed at the sensation and shoved his arse against Draco's fingers, silently begging for more.
"You're insufferable," Draco rolled his eyes, trying to cover the fact that his heart started beating faster. "We have rapier practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from four to six. You can join us, I'll give you the address later. Then, only then, if I deem your fencing skills sufficient, I'll lend you a rapier."
"It's gone now," Draco said after a while.
He was old, Draco guessed around seventy. His remaining hair was gray and fell limply down to his shoulders, the skin on his face and hands covered in liver spots. He smelled of tobacco. Not the sharp, acidic stink of cigarette smoke that got stuck in the back of one's throat but the sweet scent of a freshly lit pipe.
When Malfoy didn't say a word for a while, Harry looked up. Malfoy was staring at him, his mouth agape, eyes wide.
"Bloody hell, are you serious right now?" Harry's wand appeared in his hand. He wasn't aware of drawing it.
"Oh, I'm going to top you, you smug bastard," Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco playfully.
Another thing she would never admit out loud was that she was grateful to Potter for joining their agency, even temporarily. It meant she could stay at home instead of going out at night with Draco. Draco, who acted like a bloody Gryffindor these days, with his heroic deeds like throwing himself into danger or more recently saving Scarheads from some of the most haunted mansions they'd ever encountered. She understood why Draco changed, what events had lead to him becoming the person he was now. However, that didn't mean she wanted to change too. She was satisfied being cowardly, sequestered in the safety of her iron-and-lavender-protected flat.
Harry grinned. "I already am in paradise."
"Thank you, Brook," he managed to say and stalked away.
"What look? I have no idea what you're babbling about," Potter huffed.
"For fuck's sake, Malfoy, just sit down, will you?" Weasley the best mate rolled his eyes.
"We already picked out names, you know? Before…," her voice broke but she carried on in a harsh whisper. "Rose for a girl and Hugo for a boy."
„Mr. Malfoy, not only were you Obliviated but your body was repeatedly subjected to a Cruciatus curse. That is why you experienced the pain, vomiting, and blacking out. Your muscles contracted to the point where the fibers broke from the strain of suffering under the curse. It is similar to working out regularly, the fibers in the muscles break and one feels sharp pain over the course of time when the muscles heal,“ the medi-wizard explained gently.
Harry pushed a pillow under Draco's hips without breaking the kiss and lubed his cock quickly. Draco felt the tip of it press against his quivering hole and reveled in the sensation. He would finally feel Harry inside him, he couldn't wait. Harry breached him gently and slid fully inside Draco in one long, slow glide. They found a slow, steady rhythm together, their bodies sweating and quivering, their hearts swelling with love.
. I told you to memorize all the rules, haven't I?" Draco whispered back.
"Niffler. Affirmative," Harry could hear footsteps running toward them from the dining room. Derrick and Hopkins must have moved there while Harry and Tracey were investigating the cellar.
„Clean up later?“ Harry broke the kiss and tipped up his head to look at Draco. He smiled deviously, biting his lip.
“Sure, I’ll be here to save your pretty little arse if you mess up,” Draco’s hot breath tickled Harry’s ear.
Harry didn't have an answer to that. Instead, he crossed the room and sat down next to Ron. He threw his arm around his best friend's shoulders and they stayed like that, each lost in their own thoughts.
"I wish you would," Potter mumbled under his breath so quietly, Draco thought he must have imagined it. Out loud Potter said, "sorry, force of habit."
"They see through the Disillusionment Charm for fuck's sake. I don't think he will be fine for that long," Harry sighed. He surveyed the door again and sent out a tentative tendril of magic. The wards were indeed powerful, more than anything Harry had ever come into contact with. He thought hard. There were always weak places in the wardwork. There were hitches and loopholes one could exploit to their advantage, given enough time. However, time was not on Harry's side. Think Harry, he reprimanded himself. The door was protected with the strongest type of magic. But noone would surely spend that much time and magic on the walls. Harry's heart leaped. He walked over to the wall next to the door and pointed his wand at a section of it.
Draco has been behaving strangely in the past week. He's been coming home late from work, complaining about being tired all the time. Which means no sex. Harry can survive that, really, he can but he can't help but feel suspicious and decides to find out what's his boyfriend up to.
"I…" Harry trailed off. He couldn't let Hermione down now. "No, of course not, I'm not that childish. Malfoy and I are going out in the evening. I'll be over at yours as soon as we finish."
"I can hear the creaking again," Harry exhaled shudderingly.
A bolt of lightning flashed in the sky followed by a rumble of distant thunder. The white, bright light illuminated the attic briefly. Harry could see the slopes of the gable roof, supported by sturdy wooden beams. There were several skylights above him and behind him, providing at least some source of light from the streetlamps, if not from the overcast sky. Harry stepped carefully onto the attic floor and wiped his dusty hands on his jeans.
„I‘ll leave you two alone for a bit. Harry, would you like something from the canteen?“ she offered.
"You have that look on your face," Draco frowned at him.
They Apparated back to the temporary base, that had been erected close by. A section of Diagon Alley had been partitioned off to allow the Aurors to set up a tent of operations within a close range of the bank. A table with blueprints was set up in the centre of the tent, surrounded by Aurors. A goblin Harry didn't know was standing to the side, fidgeting nervously with his clothes.
„What is it, Gin,“ Harry asked her gently.
Malfoy snickered. "Very funny, Potter."
"Am I what?" Draco asked, confused. He shook his head, trying to clear it. They were on their fifth pint and the three shots of Firewhiskey in between definitely didn't help him think straight.
Suddenly, he was wrapped in a warm embrace. He inhaled deeply and the heady smell of Draco's perfume and his skin underneath wafted into Harry's nostrils.
"Did you? That is so sweet," Harry replied mockingly, even though he was being serious. His stomach fluttered as Malfoy's blush deepened even more.
"I asked to be partnered with him permanently. I thought you understood that from my letter," Malfoy said slowly as if speaking to a particularly dim-witted child.
"You're such a twat," Harry snorted and batted away Draco's hand which was still resting on his shoulder.
"Yes, you're partners again," Robards glowered at him. "Just get out of here before I change my mind."
Draco rolled Harry over and slithered down Harry‘s body to comfortably rest between his legs. He noticed that Harry‘s erection had wilted during his rant but he knew it wouldn‘t stay that way for long. He gently took Harry‘s prick in his mouth, rolled his tongue over the soft flesh, and felt heat pool in his stomach as it quickly grew against his palate and tongue. Draco lifted his gaze and met Harry‘s eyes. They were still hurt and a single tear streaked down his cheek. Lust was beginning to darken Harry‘s expression but the tear nearly broke Draco‘s heart. He released Harry‘s cock and crawled back up to kiss Harry gently on the lips.
"I would set them up somewhere closer to the possible location of the Source, maybe the corridor upstairs?" Harry shrugged.
"No way, I won't let you endanger yourself like that," Harry protested loudly.
Harry noticed Malfoy was biting his lip, trying not to smile. Harry couldn't help but notice that his teeth were perfectly straight and bright white.
Harry snorted. Malfoy got up and turned away, tossing the dirty, bloodied washcloth onto the edge of his desk. Harry felt the absence of Malfoy's body like a blow, his warmth, his musky scent, the softness of his skin, his breath tickling Harry's face, suddenly gone. Harry didn't know why or even how his crush on Malfoy reached epic proportions in less than one day. He only knew it now coursed through his veins, feeling as vital to life as blood.
"Is that it? Did I hit the nail on the head?" Smith snickered. "Are you still a virgin?"
„I think he would actually be upset if I didn‘t praise his divine skills,“ Harry chuckled. „Anyway, I think it‘s time you finally met him. How about dinner? Tomorrow at seven, my place?“
Harry snickered. „You‘re such a git, Draco.“
„How would you proceed?“ Draco asked him in a similar, hushed tone.
He couldn't stay in the office a moment longer with the picture haunting him. He needed to breathe, he needed fresh air. He jumped out of his chair, restless. He staggered out of the office and locked the door behind him hurriedly, his hands shaking.
"OK, I'm in," Draco breathed out slowly. "You convinced me, I'm going to help you."
Draco had to agree with him. The last time Creevey had been summoned to a scene, a young girl and three Muggles died. A rogue Death Eater kidnapped the little girl, demanding ransom. Due to his hate for Death Eaters, Creevey didn't handle the situation by the book. He started threatening the Death Eater and escalated the tension even further. The resulting massacre made headlines of all the main newspapers in Britain. He was suspended for six months without pay and this was to be his first task since his return.
„Please, please,“ Harry was chanting, his eyes fixed intently on Draco‘s every movement.
It felt strange, waking up in his flat. He couldn't even remember when was the last time he'd slept here. A month ago? Two? Draco turned around in his bed, his hand automatically reaching for something… someone who was not there. The bed felt uncomfortable, cold, and empty. He sighed, got up, and padded to the kitchen. He made scrambled eggs for breakfast but as he ate them, he couldn't shake the feeling they tasted wrong, even though he'd prepared them the same way he always had in the past. Later, as he stood in front of his wardrobe staring into it, trying to assemble a decent outfit, he realized that all his favourite shirts were gone. Draco felt as if he didn't know himself anymore. He felt strange in his own skin. He kept waiting for something to happen but he couldn't figure out what.
„I really do love you,“ Harry pulled back. „I have to ask you something,“ Harry said and suddenly turned serious. Looking Draco in the eyes, Harry exhaled slowly, trying to gather his courage to go on with his carefully prepared speech.
„You shifty bastard,“ Blaise grinned at Draco. Then he turned his attention to Harry and whispered seductively. „Say, Harry, if you ever get tired of Draco, owl me,“ he winked at him for a good measure.
Pansy gave him a look, saying quite the opposite.
"Yeah. Yeah, I do," Draco smiled.
„Yes, yes,“ Harry writhed above him.
"Make me," Harry breathed out, invading Draco's personal space.
Harry stops immediately. "Do you want me to stop?" Harry asks carefully.
Pansy's shrill laughter carried in from the reception area. "Draco spent hours over the weekend coming up with it."
"What's not true?" Draco turned around, a crease forming between his eyebrows.
Before Pansy could reply, a loud bang resonated through the foyer. It had come from upstairs. The whole house shook with the force of it, and the oppressive atmosphere that had been pushing against their senses suddenly gleamed triumphantly. Without waiting for Pansy's answer, Draco whipped around and rushed upstairs, hand gripping the hilt of his rapier tightly.
"So, will you…," Potter breathed out. "Be there?"
„No centaur stories, I mean it!“ Draco eyed him threateningly.
That one sentence made Harry feel lighter and more hopeful than he had felt in a long time.
Draco blinks huge eyes at him and nods.
All fight seemed to evaporate from Harry and he sighed, feeling sick. "I'm sorry Hermione." He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand and plopped himself in the armchair by the fire.
„I do, I feel like the shock factor is the best way to go about this. This way, they won‘t have any chance to try and talk me out of it. As if they could. Besides, I think some of your wickedness is contagious because I can‘t wait to see Ron‘s face when he realizes I‘m dating you,“ Harry snickered. „And then again when Pansy and Blaise arrive,“ he added quietly, suddenly not so certain it was a good idea after all.
"Nothing," Harry, still chuckling, wiped his eyes. "You're amazing, you know that?"
Harry could see that Draco was lying, pretending that he couldn't care less. Harry knew, however, by the slight downward turn of Draco's mouth and his stiff shoulders, that Draco did care about what people thought of him. Harry refrained from commenting on it, knowing their relationship didn't run that deep yet. He realized he loved getting to know Draco better and every day he spent with him, he liked the person he'd become more and more. He hoped Draco would open up to him soon and let Harry see the insecurities and pain he was hiding from the world.
They'd agreed they would enter one by one so that they accidentally didn't bump the door and alert the robbers to their presence. Draco was to go first with Harry at his back, then Smith, and lastly Nott.
"I admit it might sound a bit crazy. OK, it definitely sounds crazy but that's what happened, you have to believe me," Harry insisted.
"Oh," Harry couldn't think of anything else to say. He opened his eyes only to startle when he noticed how close Malfoy had leaned in.
"It's not true," Harry said suddenly, lifting his head up.
Draco inhaled and exhaled slowly. „Please go on.“
"Come on, Malfoy, don't tell me you're afraid of tentacles," Potter poked him in the ribs with his index finger.
„Mr. Malfoy, glad to see you awake,“ the medi-wizard said. He was tall, blonde, and quite handsome, Draco noticed. He was holding a clipboard with notes written across it.
"Hey, Hermione, how was work?" Harry grinned at her from the stove where he was frying a chicken.
Draco picked up a neatly folded net made of thin iron chains. "Once you throw the net over the Source, it renders it inert, effectively dismissing the ghost."
"They are dead anyway," Robards shook Harry's arm forcefully. "Do you hear me? They are dead and you could have died too! It was all for nothing!"
He steeled himself and crept a little closer still. He breathed in and out and sprung into action from his hiding spot.
"We'll figure it out. Together," Potter offered him a small, reassuring smile. Draco didn't want to feel as grateful for it as he did. He couldn't help it but he was starting to like Potter's presence in his life. He could easily get used to it if he was honest with himself.
„Fuck you,“ Draco whispered. He felt too week to stand up. He swallowed his dignity and crawled into the flames. Then he was gone.
"Let me show you what I think about that," Draco patted his thighs in an invitation for Harry to sit on top of him. He was biting his lip seductively.
"Through here, Mr. Gladstone. Would you like tea or coffee?" Pansy's voice was dripping with politeness.
"You're such a berk when you're drunk," Harry shook his head. His shoulders slumped. He swept the bottle of cider off the bar and stalked toward the table occupied by their friends. Draco watched him go and wanted nothing more than to run after him and hug him. He'd caught a glimpse of Harry's hurt expression and he wished he could wipe it off his face. Harry reached the table and collapsed onto a chair next to Pansy. Draco watched him mumble something and lower his head on the table in what seemed a defeat. Pansy patted his back, comforting him, whispering something in his ear. She lifted her head and scowled at Ron.
Potter looked put out for a moment but nodded his agreement anyway. Draco wanted nothing more than to capture Potter's lips with his but he didn't think he could survive the pain of never being able to do so again.
The foyer had been grand in its day from what Harry could see by the pale light of the full moon, illuminating the room in places. Dark wooden paneling decorated the walls. There was a broken glass chandelier hanging from the two-storey-high ceiling. Spiderwebs were strewn across it and all over the broken remains of furniture that used to adorn the room. Everything was covered by a thick layer of dust.
Draco saw red. His breathing was ragged and he only dully took in his surroundings. The other Aurors were standing still, observing the exchange, an uncomfortable silence stretching around them. Only the last vestiges of Draco's reason saved him from punching Smith in the face. He turned around on his heel and stomped into the relative safety of his office. Smith was an arsehole and Draco would not get fired over an argument with him.
Weasley three and Thomas stood up and let Draco pass to his reserved seat next to the party boy.
Harry jumped out of his (not his anymore, was it?) seat and shouted, feeling hurt and betrayed. "You finally found an excuse to get rid of me, didn't you?"
Draco punched him.
„Why haven‘t we told your friends yet, then?“ Harry asked.
"I've never said they had to be failures, embarrassing stories will do nicely. I'll start as you seem to be a bit shy," Draco snickered. "Mine was back at Hogwarts with Pansy. She fancied me and at that time I was still in denial about my sexual preferences. Anyway, long story short, I couldn't even get it up for her. She was so determined and wouldn't give up for two hours, even when I tried to push her off. In the end, she hurt her jaw while giving me a blow job and had to go to Madame Pomfrey to get a pain-relieving potion."
„Why don‘t we play over there, in that corner?“ Ron proposed.
"He's Potter, he's going to be just fine. He's too stubborn to die. Now, think of the most idiotic thing he could come up with. The stupidest, most dangerous, ghost-ridden place he could be at. I'm pretty sure that's where I'll find him," Draco sneered. Potter had always been predictable in that sense.
"Off with this," he tugged at Potter's braces. "We'll have fun with these later."
"I don't know what you expected but I never asked you to be here," Draco shot back venomously.
"What is it?"
Some of the tightness seemed to leave Malfoy's body and his face relaxed slightly. He looked handsome again, his sharp cheekbones appeared less threatening, less savage, and more statuesque.
"Harry, please, be reasonable," Robards said calmly.
"As soon as I catch a breath," Harry panted, "I'm going to torture you."
„I‘ve forgotten to check on my test potion I was brewing at work. I never leave the potions unattended but suddenly, I was in my office without remembering walking there. I thought it was just the fatigue I‘d been feeling,“ Draco replied matter-of-factly.
"Good morning," Harry beamed at Malfoy as he opened the door to their office.
"I'm ready, Harry," Draco whispers.
„I‘m going to,“ Harry rasped, his voice hoarse from moaning and gasping.
"How's boyfriend number seventy-three?" Draco snarled with contempt the moment Potter stepped through the door to their office.
Kingsley and Robards shared a contemplative look. Some kind of silent communication seemed to pass between them. Finally, Robards turned back to Harry and nodded. "You have one week, not a minute more."
"You're worse than my eighty-year-old grandmother. She knows how to have fun. You're actually worse than a blushing virgin," Smith taunted Draco, a sneer plastered to his face.
"Me too," Theo gently pushed her away.
Draco tried hard not to blush. "How would I know? I have better things to do than ogle Potty's bum!"
Draco caught his bottom lip with his teeth, letting a languid, predatory smile slowly spread across his features. He stalked toward Harry, stopping just inches from him. He leaned close and let his lips hover just above Harry's ear. He felt Harry shudder and heard him take in a sharp breath.
Draco elbowed Potter's ribs and took pity on him. "Come on, Potty, time for me, of all people, to teach you some Muggle stuff."
"Ickle Ronniekins," Pansy's voice was pure ice as she grabbed Ron by the ear to drag him away. Pansy only used Ron's childhood nickname when she was angry with her boyfriend.
„I know that now, Harry. I love you too. I‘ve come to terms with it already,“ Ginny smiled at him sadly. „But this is important. I keep thinking about it since Monday since Ron told me you and Malfoy...“ she trailed off.
"Tracey, we have to go," Harry tugged at her arm.
"We're heading inside," Harry signaled Davis to stand back. He pointed his wand at the doorknob and turned it slowly, using magic. The hinges creaked loudly, the sound echoing through the large foyer coming to view behind it. A wide corridor connected the front and rear of the mansion. Harry could faintly see the outlines of two people standing just through the main entrance across the hall. One of them waved at him and Harry recognized Montague.
"Okay," Harry breathed out. He seemed solely concentrated on the job at hand.
Draco took a sip of his warm beer. He hated beer. He would never understand why people willingly drank it. However, tonight he didn't have any other choice as he didn't want to risk ordering wine in such a piss-poor establishment such as the one he was currently at. Even more, he hated Pansy's today's choice of a Muggle karaoke bar for their Friday pub crawl night. What he hated the most, were the sleazy men staring in his direction, whom he tried to ignore profoundly. Their gang met up every two weeks, ever since they finished their eighth year at Hogwarts, where he, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo struck a surprising friendship with the Gryffindors. It had all started when the eighth-year students were assigned a separate Common Room and dorms. Draco had been forced to share a room with Weasley of all people. Yet somehow, after numerous hexing and shouting matches, they became friends. A year later, their whole Slytherin-Gryffindor group was inseparable.
"You need to get the fuck here, right now," Ron bellowed through the Floo.
"What did the moron do?" Draco growled. "Can you feel how agitated the house is? It's angry, furious actually."
, Draco thought. It had nothing to do with wanting to be close to the speccy git again.
„Mrs. Malfoy. Yes, Draco will be alright, I‘m sure he will be happy to see you,“ Harry‘s voice was choked.
"The dining room is this way then," Narcissa led them over to a newly reconstructed part of the Manor. Harry knew all the rooms were stripped bare after Narcissa and Draco had returned to the Manor after the Trials. He knew they wanted to erase all the bad memories connected with their home due to the unwanted stay of Voldemort in it and all the horrors that happened under its roof.
The ghosts surged toward him, faster than he'd ever seen them move. He instinctively threw a handful of salt at them, only for them to appear seconds later, advancing toward him hastily. Harry could feel hate emanating from them towards him in waves. He shuddered. The ghosts hadn't been this angry the last time he was here. What had changed since last week? He ducked again, throwing more salt in their direction, and started backing toward the staircase.
"What are you babbling about, Potter?" Draco snarled.
Harry visibly flinched but seemed relieved he was allowed to stay all the same.
"I'm sorry, I'm afraid not," Mr. Gladstone shook his head.
a plonker and he scowled at him. "Blaise, piss off. Why am I a plonker? The arsehole who doesn't see how bloody amazing Harry is, is the one who deserves to be called a plonker, not me!"
"Oh, really? I'm positive I wouldn't even recognize it if you were trying to flirt with me," Harry stuck his chin out in a challenge.
Harry ignored him, mounted his broom, and started off towards Malfoy, shouting something about proper broom grips. Ron shook his head and headed back toward the castle. Fucking Malfoy and fucking Harry.
"I don't even know why I'm surprised. Of course, you would be the only person in the whole world to hear and be able to speak to the ghosts. The miraculous Harry Potter," Draco sneered.
"Wow, Potter," Draco drawled. "Who would have thought you had a knack for interior design, what with your atrocious fashion sense." Draco was a bit apprehensive about making fun of Harry, but at the same time, he couldn't pretend he was anyone other than himself. He hoped Harry would take the jest for what it was and wouldn't get angry.
„You know I am right. Granger will give you a stern lecturing, the Weasel is probably going to throw a fit and possibly even stop talking to you for a while and the Weaslette will hex my bits off. I don‘t want to put you in a position where you might have to choose between me and your friends. Imagine the articles in the Daily Prophet. HARRY POTTER UNDER THE IMPERIUS CURSE?. THE SAVIOUR CONSORTING WITH A KNOWN DEATH EATER! I would love nothing more than to stop hiding from the world but I am scared of the outcome.“ It was a relief to get it off his chest. Draco traced his fingers over Harry‘s spine in an absent-minded gesture. Harry shivered under his touch.
"Sorry," Granger muttered and blushed as she pulled away. "It's the hormones."
"Is that so?" Potter lifted an eyebrow, smirking.
"At first I thought I was going down with the flu, except the Pepper-Up potion didn't work. I was tired all the time and my muscles hurt as if I'd been exercising," Draco shuddered as he remembered the feeling. "It was much worse on Friday though, I came to Grimmauld Place and I was barely able to stand, my vision was swimming and I felt like throwing up." Draco glanced at Harry warily and noticed the shame and regret reflected in his face.
Ginny's eyes darkened and an expression of hate crossed her face. She shoved Draco out of the way and disappeared through the flames.
Harry hadn't slept much last night, he had no idea how to convince Draco his feelings for him were genuine. Hell, he had no idea how to tell Draco he even had feelings for him. In the end, Harry decided he would try to be a friend to Draco first, and maybe Draco would start trusting him. Harry also decided he would stop being such a slut. He would stop having sex with random blokes and wait for Draco, hoping one day, Draco would allow him to hold him in his arms.
„Draco,“ Harry breathed out. He closed his eyes as the sensation of his prick rubbing against the coarse material of the upholstery sent a wave of pleasure through his whole body. Harry loved sex with Draco. It was never boring, never dull, never the same. Sometimes they would make love at dawn, looking into each other‘s eyes, kissing softly, professing their love through the gentle rocking motion of their bodies. Other times Draco would shove Harry against the nearest surface and give them both a rough hand job, both of their pricks squeezed tightly in his palm. And then, there were times like these, when Draco did whatever he wanted to Harry. These were the times when Harry was able to completely let go of himself and ride on the wave of pleasure Draco would provide.
That's when the wall next to the main door exploded inwards, pieces of stone and masonry showering the ground. As the dust started to settle, rays of sunshine illuminated the hole in the wall. One very angry Harry Potter started climbing in. He looked like an angel of revenge, with his wild, untamed black hair and halo of sunshine above his head. Draco's head spun and he toppled forward, hitting his head on the marble floor. Then, there was only blackness.
"Perfect. What about the chains?"
"Did I hurt you?" there was concern in Draco's voice.
On the night Harry had broken up with Ginny, finally admitting to himself that he was not interested in women that way, he went out drinking alone to a gay muggle bar. To his surprise, he met Draco there. One thing led to another and they ended up in Harry‘s bedroom in No. 12 Grimmauld Place. Over the course of that night, to Harry's utter surprise, he came to realize that Draco was not only hilarious and witty but considerate and sweet as well. What started as a one-night stand turned into a week-long affair and from there it gradually grew into a loving relationship.
The next time Harry and Ron saw Malfoy was at the Quidditch pitch. The students in the eighth year were not allowed to participate in Quidditch as such but the pitch was assigned to them for two hours a week where they could train if they wanted to. Harry was always there. As was Malfoy.
"That's your fight, I get enough grief about my lack of fashion sense at home," Harry laughed and bumped his knee against Draco's thigh under the table.
Draco replied by thrusting his tongue inside Harry‘s opening and was rewarded by the sexiest moan he‘d ever heard Harry utter. He doubled his efforts, pinning Harry against the sofa with his arms, effectively stilling any movement. Harry was meowling, there was no other word for it, and Draco's cock jumped appreciatively. Harry's whole body was shuddering and spasming with want.
„When I‘m with you,“ Draco inhaled deeply and carried on rather bravely. Maybe some of the Gryffindor characteristics were rubbing off on him, he thought to himself. „When I‘m with you it‘s like the whole world around me is lit up with a thousand suns. When you're not around, all I can think of is when I will get to see you again. I can‘t imagine not having you in my life. I don‘t think I could have a life you‘re not part of,“ he whispered. Draco suddenly felt as if he‘d said more than he wanted to, but the look in Harry‘s eyes of pure love was worth it.
Draco would have started laughing if his heart wasn‘t breaking at seeing Harry so distressed. Sometimes Harry was hopeless, he often misread Draco‘s words and actions, expected to be hurt. Draco knew all of Harry‘s past by now and knew that being loved was the most important thing to Harry. He knew Harry lost too many people he cared about and he seldom let anyone new into his life. Draco felt honored that Harry decided to trust him enough to open himself up for possible pain. Harry often worried that his actions would cause other people to stop loving him. It was a gruesome remnant of his awful childhood and post-war stress. As a result, Harry often suffered panic attacks and Draco did everything in his power to help him through them.
Harry paced around his house like a caged lion. Malfoy always managed to get under his skin easily, sometimes without even trying. One minute he seemed to genuinely care about Harry not getting hurt, the other he was the same sneering prat he'd always been. Harry didn't understand this version of his childhood rival at all. Forcefully, Harry decided to stop thinking about the dolt and concentrate instead on the problem (or rather the Problem) at hand.
Draco paled, as a sense of foreboding crept upon him. "What asylum?"
The goblin sneered at him. "After a certain break-in a few years back, we were forced to increase the security measures. You might remember the accident, Auror Potter."
"Oh God, Harry! I want you so much," Draco babbled. He was out of his mind as Harry's finger kept pushing inside him and pulling out again. The speed changed, one moment hard and fast, the next barely moving at all. Harry brushed Draco's prostate with every drag of his fingers and Draco could only gasp and squirm on the bed. He could barely take in his surroundings, there was only the feel of Harry's finger inside him and the tongue that was now circling his rim, accompanying the finger. There was only pleasure and the sounds they both made, their sighs and groans, the meowl Draco knew must have made, the whimpering and cursing. And then he came. The orgasm raged through him, he could barely breathe, he was drowning. Draco let his legs fall shakily on each side of Harry's beautiful body.
„What is it?“ Ginny asked tentatively.
"Oh God, yes," Harry moaned. He shed his clothes quickly and pulled Draco's pants off.
"I'm not going to make a fool out of myself again," Harry's voice broke and Draco's heart almost broke with it.
Harry pulled away and looked Draco in the eye. He seemed to be searching for something. A range of emotions crossed his face and settled on serious.
"Yes, Sir?" Harry wanted nothing more than to run out of the door and follow Draco. He forced himself to stay calm and composed.
"It makes sense, that the residue the ghosts sometimes leave behind would be formed of the same substance they are made of," Harry hummed.
Draco forced himself to breathe in and out slowly. He needed to find Potter as soon as possible but at the same time he knew staying cautious was his top priority if he wanted to survive the night and get out of here alive. He stopped moving and signaled Pansy to do the same. He let his eyes roam across the corridor, its end barely visible in the darkness. No ghosts so far. He listened to the house, hoping to hear Potter moving around. Instead, he could hear the faint whisper of the wind outside and an occasional creak of the floorboard in one of the rooms. There was no sign of Potter, as far as Draco could tell. No footsteps, no banging sounds. Nothing. He knew that back in school, Potter could never stay quiet. He was always moving, fidgeting with his robes, humming softly, or shuffling his feet across the floor. Maybe Potter changed during the Auror training program and had learnt how to stay still while waiting for criminals in dark alleys or abandoned warehouses.
"What are our orders, Sir?" Potter asked, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
Harry couldn't hold back the giggle that escaped his throat. He looked at the real Malfoy in disbelief. Malfoy's gaze didn't waver from the parchment but Harry could swear the smirk on his face was almost fond. It was the first time Malfoy's signature expression warmed Harry's heart pleasantly. Harry smiled to himself and flicked to page one.
"I miss him too, all the bloody time. I'm so sorry, here I go all about Malfoy while you suffer. I won't mention him again," Harry cursed himself for being so self-centered and inconsiderate.
Draco rolled again, aiming his wand at the second wizard. The robber was faster than Draco had counted on. He swung around the moment he heard Draco's shout and fired a well-aimed Diffindo at Draco's stomach. The roll Draco had executed should have moved him out of harm's way but he felt the spell hit him in the shoulder. Hot blood spilled out of the wound over his chest. Draco fell on one knee which saved his life as another Severing Charm narrowly missed his head.
"Exactly," Draco confirmed. "We usually observe the ghosts first before taking any action to learn the patterns of their movement. We try not to engage them or make them agitated. Hence the no magic rule. All the equipment I'm going to show you now is for emergency use only. First, there are the salt bombs. Just aim it at a ghost, throw it, and poof, the ghost's gone. Some until the next night, some only for a brief moment. The next one is a magnesium flare, which I think you have been acquainted with rather in detail."
He turned around to see Ron who had apparently finished his awful performance, managed to disentangle himself from his partner in crime, and joined them. Seamus was nowhere to be seen.
"Tosser," Harry grinned at him, inwardly pleased with how well Draco could read his moods. Harry grabbed the picture frame from the desk and snorted as the picture-Harry ruffled Draco's blond locks.
"Thank you for meeting me on such short notice," Draco said and took a sip of his coffee. It was a plain cafe latte, no sugar, just the way he liked it.
"Of course," Granger nodded. "I sort of expected it. However, I wanted to tell you first how much I appreciate that you agreed to take Harry with you on a case. It's really good of you to put the old grudge behind you."
"I don't want your pity fuck! Or are you that desperate to get laid tonight? Don't let me keep you from it then," he snatched his hand away regretfully.
“I stumbled on something,” Harry replied. He cursed his own clumsiness.
"Is that it? Did I hit the nail on the head?" Smith snickered. "Are you still a virgin?"
Draco's suspicion that all of his friends were acting crazy only grew. He frowned and observed the silent communication - Blaise's glare and Harry's desperate, wide, pleading eyes. In the end, Harry cleared his throat and stepped closer to Draco.
"Other than seeing the ghost once, as you mentioned, have you or your wife observed any other," Draco paused, searching for the right words. "Unnatural occurrences lately?"
"Don't I fucking know that," Harry retorted without malice. Suddenly he flinched and rose up quickly. "It's coming back and it seems angry."
"That's not possible, you can't hear the ghosts talking," Draco stared at him.
Once Harry relatively calmed down, he decided to fire-call Hermione. He caught her at her office in St Mungo's, in between patients.
They sat down to a large round table set with silverware and white cloth napkins. Cut roses decorated the room, and a large chandelier illuminated it with soft warm light. Their appetizers appeared on the plates in front of them minutes later. The marinated goat cheese served with grilled asparagus only served to irritate Harry's stomach. He was starving and wolfed down his portion to chuckles coming from Draco's seat.
"I don't know," Draco whispered. Why did it hurt so much, hearing his friends speak about Harry this way? How could Draco not remember what Harry sounded like during sex, how he felt in Draco's arms when he'd been supposedly madly in love with him mere days ago?
"Say yes, Harry," Draco bit Harry's jawline. "Pretty, pretty please." He accentuated every word with another bite and lick along Harry's jaw. The last time they had sex was in Harry's office when Harry had bent Draco over his desk and fucked him senseless. Draco was mad with want, he needed Harry inside him ever since he woke up in the hospital.
He didn't see Harry in the library but found an envelope on the coffee table with his name on it written in Harry's scrawl. He eyed it warily. Why would Harry write him a letter? Did he leave? Did he want some time away from Draco? His stomach twisted. He opened the envelope gingerly and started reading.
He placed the flashlight between his teeth and braced one foot against the wall next to the doorframe. He pulled with all his strength but the door wouldn't budge. He could see the coils of darkness coming closer, rolling and swirling toward them.
"Anyway, you were right about the Sources," Harry smiled at her gently. He could see Hermione's expression transforming immediately. Gone was the sadness and anger, replaced with excitement and hope. He would try hard to keep the hope lighting up her face. He repeated what Malfoy had explained to him earlier.
"I wish you could, though," Malfoy whispers, and the pain in his voice is back. He lifts his head slightly and Harry sees rivulets of tears falling out of Malfoy's eyes, streaking down his cheeks, running down his neck, drying in long lines on his grubby skin.
„Why didn‘t you tell me?“ Harry asked him quietly. He couldn‘t look Draco in the eye, instead, he opted for looking at the floor.
"Now, throw that piss you're drinking away, and let me introduce you to a Muggle secret," Ron draped his arm around Draco's shoulder again. "It's called Long Island. Drink three and you'll be lying under the table."
„Mate, good to see you,“ Ron clapped him on the shoulder, simultaneously pushing a bottle of wine into Harry‘s hand.
"I've already requested the authorization from my superiors, but it's going to take at least an hour to be granted it," the goblin stated, his expression passive once again.
"Do you like him then, for real?" Hermione asked after a while, breaking the silence that had settled over them.
„Don‘t flatter yourself, Ferret,“ Ron deadpanned.
"Not really, he said it took him a year to come up with the defenses they use against the ghosts but he didn't go over the specifics," Harry pondered. "I guess I'll see it tonight."
"Two," Draco loosened the snap fastener and pointed the container, filled with a mixture of iron, magnesium, and salt, toward the centre of the room.
"I'm just trying to establish the pattern, Mr. Gladstone," Draco shrugged casually. The less he revealed about the ghosts' behavioral patterns, the better. At least for the moment.
„You seem very stressed, Mr. Malfoy. If you‘d like, I could help you relieve the stress,“ she batted her eyelashes at Draco.
„Can you give us some examples?“ the medi-wizard inquired while running a series of basic diagnostic charms Harry was familiar with.
Draco moaned under him. He grabbed Harry‘s hips and started slamming Harry harder and faster onto himself.
"Mr. Malfoy," Robards coughed politely after swallowing the first bite of the fish. "What can you tell us about last week? Any small detail you might find insignificant could prove useful."
I need to get better for myself so that I can be better for you. You deserve the best and I hope one day I can be good enough.
"You should have tried harder," Ron pointed at him accusingly. He was visibly shaking.
Harry felt oddly hurt by Malfoy's words. The tone with which he said it sounded too much like when they were back at Hogwarts, sniping at each other, hating each other, trying to rile each other up. It was not a direction he wanted their newly-found, brittle partnership to go. He had to make Draco believe him. Why would Harry be the only person that could hear the ghosts' voices? What made him different from everyone else? Harry sucked in a sharp breath as a bone-chilling thought crossed his mind.
„That‘s the idea!“ Malfoy snickered.
"God, I never thought I would say this but I love bickering with you," Harry's voice was still tinged with laughter. "It's quickly become the favourite part of my day."
"How many times do I have to tell you…," she stopped abruptly and squealed. The figure outside her flat wasn't Draco. "Theo, you're back!"
"Pansy's fault and piss off," Draco coughed. "Anyway, I think it's good you can hear the ghosts. Sometimes you can't choose your abilities but you have to accept them and learn to live with them."
"I have to admit, it is quite a sight, isn't it, Draco?" Pansy wiggled her eyebrows.
, Draco thought. He'd dreamed of Potter kissing him but he realized he wasn't ready, not yet. He panicked. He pushed hard at Harry's chest, who clearly hadn't expected it, and landed on his arse on the hard wooden floor. Draco silently cursed when he noticed a flash of hurt flicker in those beautiful eyes.
„Well, I wanted to tell you something but this might not be the best time. And well, I‘m sorry,“ Ginny hugged him tightly.
Draco thought about it. He had been convinced that Potter wouldn't want Draco to attend the party but now that he was almost begging, how could Draco refuse?
„What‘s up with you, you seem grumpy,“ Ron asked Harry after their morning meeting with the rest of their Auror division.
Harry‘s eyes widened. He flinched as if Draco had slapped him across the face. He started backing away from the bed, towards the door. „I‘m so sorry, Draco,“ he was shaking his heard, his voice barely a whisper. He suddenly turned around, threw the door open, and bolted out of the room.
"Fucking finally," Ron's bellow reached Draco's ears.
The door clicked shut behind him.
Draco's heart stopped. It felt as if a clawed hand ripped his chest apart and tore his heart out of his chest. "Get the fuck out," Draco hissed and tried to push Potter away. "I knew you didn't give a shit about people you fucked but laughing at me right now is a bit too cruel, don't you think? Just get the fuck out!"
"Sorry, I'm just so… I wanted this to work so badly," Harry replied sadly.
"As I said before, we're both idiots. Now, you have years of sex to catch up on and you have to figure out if you prefer topping or bottoming. Are you up for it?" Potter quirked an eyebrow at Draco wickedly. The gesture was rather Malfoyish in nature.
"Iron filings or chains?" Pansy asked matter-of-factly.
Smith backed off and sent a Patronus to Robards, briefly describing their situation and requesting the Head Auror's presence at once.
Draco turned around sharply. "I don't want your pity, Potter."
My deepest love,
"Shut up, Smith," Harry said quietly, trying his best not to punch Smith in the face. His hands formed fists and he tried to unclench them.
Harry smiled into his lips. "Come on then." He grabbed Draco's hand, intertwined their fingers, and led him up the stairs.
Draco followed Harry, excitement building in his chest. Harry's joggers were loose on him and Draco couldn't see much of his body underneath them but he couldn't wait to see Harry naked. He wanted to run his tongue across the planes of Harry's chest, bite and mark the soft skin of his neck. He wanted to unwrap Harry like a present and run his fingers over every bit of him.
"Of course it's your fault! If you had stayed with her, none of this would have happened," Ron shouted.
„No, I could never hate him,“ Harry replied vehemently, another guttural sob escaping him.
„Fuck you, Malfoy!“
Draco seemed to search his face for something. Apparently, he found what he was looking for and replied quietly. „OK, take me to the hospital."
„Can we talk tomorrow? I‘m not feeling well,“ Draco said.
Draco didn't ask again and started snapping his hips up and down, drawing his whole length out of Harry and slamming himself deep inside Harry's hole over and over again. Harry held himself still, drinking in the feeling of Draco's prick inside him. The sensation was overwhelming. It burned and hurt but Harry knew the pain would turn to pleasure soon enough. He pushed his arse up so that every time Draco slammed into him, Harry's cock would brush against the silk bedsheets.
Draco shot a glance in Ron‘s direction. Ron was sitting at his desk, pointedly ignoring their conversation by having pushed his index fingers inside his ears. Draco shook his head exasperatedly and turned back to Harry.
"You knew I was meeting Malfoy and you omitted to tell me in advance," Harry accused her.
„Yeah,“ Harry winced. Kissing Ginny after the war had never felt right. Their relationship was dead inside and never picked up when they left Hogwarts. Harry kept persuading himself he was ruined by the constant battles, loss, and pain. It had made him sick, thinking he would never lead a normal life, he would never feel what it was like to be consumed by love for someone and being loved unconditionally in return. He'd started to realize that the problem might lie elsewhere during his Auror training. He remembered the excitement of training, being pressed against the other trainees during the simulated raids and arrests. He recalled his cock thickening afterward in the showers, when he sneaked brief, shameful glances at the other trainees, naked under the spray of water, soaping their wet bodies. Yet, he never pursued his fantasies. He was dating Ginny and would never cheat on her. He never wanted to hurt her feelings. He had loved Ginny but slowly he came to realize it was more of a sibling love than a love that would make his heart pound in his chest and give him butterflies in the stomach.
„Evening, Granger, Weasley,“ Draco appeared in the room, gliding in as smoothly as a ghost. He was dressed in black cashmere turtleneck hugging his figure tightly, and skinny black muggle jeans with fashionable rips at the knees and thighs. Draco didn‘t wear any shoes, opting to leave his feet bare. Harry had an unhealthy obsession with Draco‘s feet and seeing them bare, in all their glory, never failed to turn him on. It made him think of undressing the rest of Draco and leaving him as bare as his feet. Harry knew Draco looked like sex on legs in his black outfit. He had watched him get dressed just an hour ago only to rip the clothes off seconds later to give him a quick but rather spectacular blowjob. He didn‘t dare look in Draco‘s direction presently as he didn‘t want to miss seeing the expression on his friends‘ faces.
They looked around the room, noting the position of the single bed pushed against the far wall. To the side, there was a rocking chair, situated so that anyone who would sit in it could gaze out to the garden through the double window. There was a fireplace on the wall behind the chair. Draco couldn't see the dust covering the mantel, the bed, the sheets, the carefully folded blanket draped over the back of the rocking chair but he could smell it. Trinkets, carved boxes, and framed pictures decorated the mantel, making the room look rather homely and lived in, even in the dark.
"Why do you think, Potter?" Malfoy sneers.
Harry wakes up in what looks like a black-and-white version of the King's Cross Station. He has a choice to make. Harry knows what to do. What greater reason is there to live than love?
Fuck, Draco thought. He should not be visible, he still had the Disillusionment Charm around him. It must be those strange lenses the wizard was wearing, he thought. Draco bolstered his Protego spell and prepared to spring. He feigned a jump to the left, rolling into a crouch to his right instead, and fired a Stupefy on the wizard. The spell hit the robber straight in the chest and the wizard tumbled to the floor, unconscious. Draco breathed out and secured the offender with an additional Incarcerous to bind him in place. He conjured a Patronus and sent a message to Potter: STILL ALIVE. DON'T SEND PATRONUS BACK. CAREFUL, THEY SEE THROUGH DISILLUSIONMENT.
He could hear voices from the corridor. One voice belonged to Harry and the other one sounded like Draco‘s mother. The voices were muffled but Draco was able to distinguish the words nonetheless.
Ron never got a chance to answer as at that precise moment the door opened and Draco sauntered in airily.
"Just, fuck me already, forget the fingers," Harry growled impatiently. "Split me open with your cock already!"
Harry pressed closer to Draco, and tilted his head up, smiling radiantly. "I mean it Draco, you are rather overwhelmingly wonderful."
"Harry?" her face turned from sleepy to panicked within a second. "What's wrong?
„Who knew Ferret-sex could be so addictive,“ Ron smirked at him.
Harry's heart faltered and he swallowed over the smothering heaviness in his chest. Draco was jealous and hurt. Could it mean that Draco harboured deep feelings for Harry too? How could Harry not have noticed before? Why was Harry so bloody daft when it came to reading people's feelings? Where were Harry's instincts, infallible in the field, when it came to the matters of the heart?
"Well, yeah," Harry rubbed the back of his neck and had the decency to blush. "She's the one who said you were cheating on me."
"I'm here," Harry presses his palm against Draco's cheek. Draco's eyelids flutter closed. His body starts shaking, the trembling growing until his movements rattle the metal frame against the stone walls and floor.
Draco allowed himself to smile, a corner of his mouth tilting up. "Yes, I thought so too. Maybe working with you will not be such a catastrophe I originally expected."
"Oh, bloody buggering…" Ron cursed. "You'll see him on Monday then."
Harry's eyes fluttered shut expectantly and Draco took his time to admire the long black lashes that fell on his cheeks. He leaned in slowly and flicked his tongue across Harry's lips gently. Harry whimpered and Draco's heart jumped in his chest. It was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. Draco's whole body was thrumming with rightness. He felt as if a piece of himself that was missing slotted itself back into place. He deepened the kiss, suddenly desperate to taste Harry, to know what it felt like to force his tongue inside Harry's mouth. Draco felt like flying. His body was weightless as Harry's hands pulled him in firmly, their chests finally touching. Their movements became frantic, desperate and Harry's sighs and moans drove Draco crazy with need.
He looked around, tuning out the clinking of the chains coming from Harry's direction. He concentrated both on the feel inside the house and on trying to spot the ghost's whereabouts. He felt his side for his rapier, making sure it was still there. He knew it was a nervous habit but feeling the cold metal hilt against his palm reassured him, made him feel safer.
"My arms still hurt a little," he breathed against Harry's neck. "I think you will have to undress and wash me."
Draco allowed himself to pretend there was sadness in Potter's eyes. Don't be ridiculous, he thought to himself.
Harry felt Draco‘s hands tearing at his jeans, fiddling with the button and zipper. He quickly rid himself of the impeding T-Shirt he was wearing, throwing it on the floor where it joined Draco‘s sweater.
Harry cast a heating charm on the only large fluffy towel he owned and wrapped it tightly around Draco's body.
"You went first the last time," Draco said carelessly, waving his arm dismissively. "It's my turn now. Can't have you steal all the glory, can I?"
Draco nearly choked on his words, anger welling inside him. How could he have hoped Potter cared about him when he went to pull some unknown bloke while Draco was still lying in a hospital bed?
They were both sweaty and sticky, both panting hard. Harry pressed his forehead against Draco‘s, waiting for his breathing to slow.
„You‘re dating the Ferret,“ Ron added with a gagging noise.
"Are you OK?" Harry asked him instead.
Draco placed his hand on top of Potter's thigh under the table, to keep him quiet without jumping too far ahead in the client's retelling of the events that had driven him to seek out the help of the agency. His heart skipped a beat when he heard Potter's sharp intake of breath.
„You sound like Hermione. Speaking of Hermione, don‘t tell her anything, please. Don‘t tell anyone anything,“ Harry ended the conversation decisively. „Cover for me, will you?“ he added over his shoulder, already on his way to the Ministry Atrium.
"Smith certainly would," Draco replied sullenly.
"Scoot over," Harry whispered into Draco's ear. "I'm going to sit behind you."
"Don't you fucking die, you wanker," Draco felt his head loll against Potter's chest. It was a nice chest, firm and warm. He wished he could lick it and tried to snuggle closer. Pain enveloped him.
"You love it," Harry smiled against Draco's skin.
„It‘s pretty epic, actually,“ Harry sighed loudly. „But that‘s not my point. I could go without sex a lot longer than a week. I mean, I lived without it for eighteen years. Sex is the last thing I‘m worried about right now. I miss it a lot, but it‘s all those other small things. He won‘t tell me where he‘s been and every time I ask him, he looks at me with this strangely confused expression that seems to say
Draco‘s head nearly fell onto his plate. Harry glanced at him fondly. Draco was so cute when he was unguarded, not hiding behind his mask of arrogance and pureblood upbringing. Harry loved these moments the most, when he could observe Draco, take in the beautiful line of his nose, the slender, pale throat Harry loved to kiss, lick and nuzzle so much. He adored that Draco held the knife and fork properly, even half-asleep.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing, Potter?" Draco pulled away, frowning angrily.
"Well, this is quite a delicate matter. It's about what I told you on Friday," Ginny widened her eyes slightly and tried to motion Harry toward the kitchen.
"But I don't know what to say to him," Draco wailed, suddenly nervous, while Pansy started dragging him again toward the fireplace.
The Floo in the library chimed and Harry nearly broke his neck on the stairs as he ran up from the kitchen, hoping it was Draco, finally ready to talk. Harry had spent the last few days holed up in his flat, bawling his eyes out. He missed Draco so fucking much. He missed his laughter, his secret smiles, his touches, the stupid jokes he always made. Harry missed the teasing and constant complaints about the state of Harry's hair and wardrobe. Harry wanted nothing more than to wrap Draco in his arms. He couldn't breathe without Draco, he couldn't…
Malfoy dumbly accepted the bag and stared at Harry some more.
They crossed the Atrium purposefully. As they neared the Apparition point, Robards stopped Harry once more with a hand on his shoulder.
Harry watched Ron's, Seamus's, and Dean's heated argument about which Quidditch team would win the league this year. He raised from his chair and started heading toward his bedroom inconspicuously. It was quarter to 9 and if he wanted to be on time for his meeting with Malfoy, he had to grab the Invisibility Cloak and head out.
"Harry, calm down," Draco gripped Harry's shoulder tightly, digging his fingers deep. "Don't feed the ghost your emotions. Don't fuck this up."
"It seems like we're going to have fun," Draco quipped, trying to keep his voice light, even though his heart was hammering in his chest. Ghosts fed off of strong, negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, or even jealousy. Bad things happened when you started a screaming match with a Poltergeist in the room.
"Pathetic," Draco snorted with a bravado he was not feeling. "I wonder where they studied battle tactics."
Eventually, Harry stilled and asked somberly. „Do you think you will ever be able to forgive me?“
"How come?" she asked, smirking.
He would have to ask Draco out later.
"I can ask her in the evening when I get home. By the way, she said she's really close to figuring out the spell to extract the ectoplasm. A few more days at most and we should be ready to test it in the field," Harry said.
Harry knew this was his chance to show Draco the truth. Show him how much he wanted him, how much Draco meant to Harry.
„Is Draco here?“ Harry asked, ignoring the venomous look Kreacher was giving him.
Harry blushed and was grateful for the darkness surrounding him. He took a deep breath and started slowly climbing up the stairs, his gaze flickering between the digital display of his thermometer and the landing. The staircase continued behind a bend to his right. He moved closer to the banister, copying it on his ascend. His position would give him an advantage, increasing his field of view behind the bend. When he reached the landing, he let out a breath he'd been holding. So far, the temperature was stable, seventeen degrees. He looked up, toward the waiting darkness of the first floor. He couldn’t see much. It appeared that the corridor ran perpendicularly to the stairs, meaning he could barely see anything from his position. He would have to climb the remainder of the steps to be able to survey either side of the corridor. He hated these kinds of house layouts; too many corners only made it easier for the culprits to hide behind them. Culprits being ghosts now, his mind supplied.
To Draco's surprise, Potter giggled. Draco wasn't sure how to react to that and decided to continue his lecture instead. "Anyway, then there's rapiers, silver-tipped. We use them to fend the ghosts off."
"Nice to see you too, Potter," Malfoy smiled at him mockingly.
The offending piece of clothing was thrown across the room, where a shirt, trousers, and pants joined it soon afterward. Potter dragged him toward the bed and they both fell on it in a heap.
„I don‘t want to go to the hospital,“ Draco choked out. „Just take me to bed.“
Harry looked up at Malfoy who was staring at him with a strange expression on his face that Harry couldn't decipher.
"I know, I just…," Harry sighed and closed his eyes. "How am I supposed to stand by and watch you get tortured?"
"As if you could ever manage to get close enough to bite me," Draco scoffed in a challenge and jumped behind a chair, keeping it as an obstacle between them. Potter laughed merrily and tried wrestling the chair from Draco. Draco feigned a movement to the left but sprang to the right. However, Potter was fast, his Quidditch-honed reflexes as incredible as ever. He tackled Draco, landing in a heap on top of him on a sofa. Potter's leg was tangled between Draco's thighs and his elbow was painfully digging into Draco's solar plexus. Draco huffed and tried to push him off but Potter held himself in place above him.
"Niffler squad, ready," came Derrick's affirmation.
you might be surprised to find this letter. Well, you shouldn't be. You know I'm bollocks at speeches. I'm bollocks at many things but speeches and talking about my feelings are among the ones I'm really shit at. I wanted to explain why I reacted the way I did and I know I would never be able to do so properly face to face. I would never be able to get out the words that would make the most sense (and not piss you off in the process). Hence the letter.
"Come on, let's have some tea," Draco smiled at him softly.
Draco chuckled and continued. "I remember I went to my office after that and worked as usual. I finished as always at four, went to the Atrium, and took a Floo home. To Harry's I mean."
"Stop lying to me. I know you Imperiused him!" Ginny shouted.
Harry thought to himself.
They reached the back door of the mansion and Harry motioned Tracey to take the left side. He stood on the right side of the door and swept his wand around the door frame and handle, searching for any hexes and curses that might have been placed there. He couldn't find any. A feeling of unease settled in his stomach. It seemed too easy and Harry desperately tried to shake off the fear slowly building in his stomach. Ever since Ron's accident, the fear of losing another person to the ghosts was almost a permanent inhabitant of Harry's body.
Malfoy flinches but nods slowly all the same. "You really are a saviour, aren't you, Potter?" the laugh is mirthless but and flicker of the arrogance Harry always detested is back. For some reason it makes Harry feel better, seeing a sliver of the old Malfoy beneath this broken exterior.
"The police?" Draco frowned. "Mr. Gladstone, are your guests Muggles or wizards if you don't mind me asking?"
Harry fell to his knees. He could barely breathe. Deep down he knew he was in shock but his mind couldn't seem to comprehend what was happening. They couldn't be gone, he gave them the adrenaline shots. They had to be alive, the medi-wizards were wrong. He started crawling toward McLaggen and Montague. He could still save them. He didn't care how many people watched him or what they thought of him. He was going to save them.
Harry finally opened his eyes and they immediately landed on Draco. They never moved, never wavered. Draco was rooted to the spot, unable to move.
„Yeah, I am, Harry, just a bit longer,“ Draco whined pleadingly. His voice was strained with effort, his face contorted in a grimace of pleasure.
"Yeah, I know," Harry laughed in spite of the growing dread in his stomach. "Run!"
„You‘ve been staring at him since you got here,“ Hermione replied accusingly.
"Don't wreck the house, Mr. Malfoy, I would hate to have to send you a repair bill," the woman waved her hand dismissively. "And don't you dare perform some dark rituals or whatever you Death Eaters do nowadays."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Arsehole," Harry muttered under his breath.
Harry was furious, all the pain, anger, and frustration he'd been feeling, swam to the surface. He lifted himself up on his elbows but stayed on the ground. Part of him wanted Ron to hurt him. Part of him wanted to get hurt so badly it would drown the horrible pain of losing Draco. He knew that Ron needed this too. He needed to punch some, hurt someone to get all the rage out of his system, even for a few moments. He needed someone to blame for his family's suffering and Harry was the easiest target.
“Stand back. No one is going to capture anyone until I say so”, Madam Bones roared, “Kingsley, bring Mr. Black here. We will administer the serum now and if I find him guilty, then the actions will be taken accordingly”.
“My plans can’t go wrong this way. They are not supposed to be. Slytherins and Gryffindors can’t be together, especially this group. I have to stop them. Why can’t they learn that I am doing this for the greater good? Don’t they know I am the leader? Why is no one asking my opinion? Why?”
"Aunty Luna " was all the warning she got and she was attacked in hug by bushy red head. she caught her anyways .
In the great hall :
Teddy cleared his throat, "About that Mr. Potter, as I was going to explain... their memories are changed. They don't remember. I mean they do but their memories are similar to your 5th year's OWL memories. Including Remus and Sirius's. I was going to explain this in the time that you were supposed to take to recover, but you didn't give me a chance." He shrugged his shoulders apologetically.
"Go on. I know what comes next."
Teddy stepped forward and helped the Potters on their feet and then turned to McGonagall, "I would like to explain them the situation in person, mam. And I need Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, the Malfoys, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville with me. So if I could take them in the chamber besides the great hall..."
"Yes Lily”
Here Hermione blushed as she was going to ask the same thing. Ron and Harry smirked at each other earning playful slaps from her. The letter continued
Where was I? Right, Voldemort is dead so why send the books? Actually defeating Voldemort solved nothing. There was so prejudice among the people that no death eater was spared. Not even those who were forced. And many truths came out later. Let's just say that it wasn't pretty.
"I don't remember any such person Harry " Sirius said after thinking hard. Everyone was the same. " But whoever they are, they are helping us, aren't they?" Neville asked timidly.
The next day would certainly be a special one. Whether it’ll be good or bad was yet to be seen.
Not mine:)
The dinner time in the Great hall was noisy as usual, but there were more than a few curious whispers that travelled through the students. After all, the mass murderer that everyone believed to be cruel and mad was sitting on the Gryffindor. If you ask anyone in the hall if Sirius Black was mad, the answer would probably be yes. It was just that the reasons why he was mad were different for each one.
“They are Potters”.
"So this letter is checked for its authenticity by the unspeakables who will be joining us. So this note says that when some people will join us, we are going to receive some books for reading and that will sure help us for the truth. Now I hope you all will cooperate and arrive here at 9 o'clock in the morning. Thank you."
Rose sighed, “Oh, here I was thinking that I'll be needed to help you, you know…  To explain things. But now Mr. Potter is the one explaining so I guess we all can hear it. From the actual source this time.”
"Whenever you are ready Harry."
Not mine
"It's a very dark magic pup . It is horcrux . I have just listened about them . But I think we can destroy it ." A pair of eyes who were seeing all this silently decided now was the time to act . So Harry was suddenly grabbed and popped in front of Sirius . " Kreacher requests you to destroy it , master . " and he stood there waiting . " A little warning could be nice next time kreacher . Harry said grumbling . " kreacher is sorry little master . I is keeping in mind next time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius and Remus were eying the whole chanting tearfully. Both had realised the mention of guests and why was it again and again. Severus Snape was staring hungrily at the form of his secret love and only friend. For the first time in years his cold mask was on the verge of breaking. No one noticed this, as each and every eye in the hall was stuck to the future and past arrivals.
"Yeah. This git here has never cared for himself," Ron told him. "Don't give me the look mate, you know I'm right," he added noticing Harry poking his tongue out.
Everyone in the hall blanched at this. Well listening that you are going to die is not the grate start of introduction. But it caught every person's attention for sure .
He told them about being given a cupboard as room, his starvations, how they neglected him, him wishing for a relative to pick him from there, having no friends, all his chores, anything and everything he could talk about; of course Harry being Harry many of the things were underestimated or left unsaid.
„You were, but in this case, it actually worked out well for me,“ Hermione laughed out loud. „Madame Pomfrey used a charm to shrink my teeth back to normal. I might have forgotten to stop her on time and she shrunk them a bit more than their original size.“
Draco cleared his throat. "You can sit in on this one, if you want, Potter. Leave the questioning to me, I don't want you to spook our client more than he already is."
"Missed you, as you missed me?" Malfoy's gaze was cold and piercing.
"Of course not, don't be absurd. I just thought you missed me a little bit more, that's all," Harry said sullenly.
Theo only shook his head. Some people in the club chuckled.
Harry's head whipped up. "Are you sure?"
"Hmmpf, see that you do," she glided haughtily back inside the foyer, grabbed her handbag, and departed without another word.
„He‘s been in severe pain for the last half an hour at least. I found him on the floor where he‘d fainted. There was some vomit too. He‘s been complaining about being tired since Monday but it was never this serious,“ Harry said in one breath.
"Come on, Weasley, tell me what you have in store for me today," Draco taunted her. "Give me all the gory details."
Potter seemed to soak in every bit of information Draco provided him with, his eyes wide and startlingly green. "That is amazing, I can't believe you figured all of this out on your own. So basically, there is salt, I knew about that one actually. Hermione read in a book somewhere that in the past, salt was used as a protection against ghosts. Then there's iron. It blocks the ghost's abilities, correct?"
The hand movement stopped abruptly.
"We keep checking the temperature all the way up the stairs. According to Pansy's research and Mrs. Emsworth's statement, her mother committed suicide in the attic. We can presume that the manifestation point is therefore going to be the attic, however, we should keep our eyes open in case the object, the Source, that keeps the ghost tied to this place is hidden elsewhere in the house," Harry said.
"Come here," he stepped forward and wrapped Harry tightly in his arms. Draco snuck one arm around Harry's back and let the other settle in the mop of messy black hair. He carded his fingers through the surprisingly soft, silky strands.
"More?" Draco whispered in his ear.
. But Malfoy wasn't here. Malfoy, with his sexy smirk and fit body and expressive eyes that had lost all of their arrogance and pride of his youth. Grey eyes full of concern, empathy, and sadness. Harry sighed and forced himself to focus on the task at hand and locked all Malfoy-related thoughts away for the time being. He was going to clear this mansion out of ghosts. For Montague. For McLaggen. And most of all for himself.
"What's the plan then?" Harry sighed and shook his head fondly when he noticed the radiant grin that spread across Draco's face.
Harry had turned the food on his plate into mush while narrating his part of the story. He pushed his plate away, disgusted with himself, unable to swallow anything as a wave of nausea rolled in his stomach.
Potter looked at him like a lost puppy, his eyes wide and sad. He was pouting and frowning slightly.
He stood up and stepped away from Potter, and leaning his hip against the desk he crossed his arms over his chest. He saw Potter out of the corner of his eye move over and a seat on the sofa.
"What do you mean you don't know?" Pansy frowned.
„You look like shit,“ Ginny smiled at him. She hugged him and kissed him on the cheek.
"How about we go shopping today?" Draco suggested. "I was thinking Muggle London. I need some new shoes and the Louis Vuitton ones are so much better than anything you can get in Diagon."
„Draco, you need medical attention,“ Harry begged.
The ghost closest to them stalked forward. Its skin looked rotten off in places. Its shriveled eyes were bulging out of a bare, bloodied skull, meaty tongue lolling out of its mouth. It was nearly upon them. Draco pulled out his rapier and attacked the Raw-bones, as he and Blaise had named this awful type of ghost. They'd only encountered it a few times but all those times were memorable in a gruesome way. Silver flashed in the faint glow of the moon shining in through the broken windows and ruined shutters, Draco's rapier but a blur of movement in the air. The Raw-bones's eyes bulged out even more, its mouth opening and closing in a silent scream as the silvered tip of Draco's rapier sliced at it, successfully slowing the ghost's advance. It hovered far out of Draco's reach, staying clear of the silver. It seemed to be waiting for an opening in Draco's defenses.
„God, Harry I need a hug right now,“ Draco whispered quietly.
He didn't mean to say that out loud but it escaped his lips. Draco felt as if an invisible hand was squeezing his heart and his chest hurt. He turned his face away from Potter and curled on his side.
"Actually, I'm rather curious myself. Why don't you give me the memory of you seeing Draco cheating on me?" Harry Accioed an empty vial from the Auror robes. He kept it there for emergency memory extractions. He offered Ginny the vial.
"Fuck this shit," a chant in a familiar voice resonated in the foyer and a loud banging noise reached Draco's ears. It sounded like footsteps running on a wooden floor.
"What do you mean by
Both of them cast the spell at once and sneaked through the door into the looming darkness of the warehouse. They stopped shorty to adjust their eyes to the dimness and found themselves in a large hall, two stories high. The ceiling was supported by thick metal beams and pillars, anchored in the bare cement floor. Harry's breath quickened as he took in the single metal chair placed in the middle of the large space. Draco was tied to the chair, his back to the entrance. Harry could see ropes cutting and chaffing the soft skin of Draco's wrists. He forced himself to stay still, even though his whole body was trembling with the need to free Draco and Apparate him to safety.
Harry
"I… I don't know what to say to that," Harry's mind went blank for a second. He hadn't expected that answer, not really.
"Very well then," Draco sighed. "Would it be convenient for you if Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. conducted an observation of the ghost on your property on Friday?"
"Are you then?" Potter asked him curiously.
Malfoy's eyes were half-lidded and he was chewing the inside of his cheek. "No, it's the same one I've worn since… well, since forever."
"Yeah, I have it," Tracey nodded solemnly.
Draco lay silently without moving. He would not cry over Harry Potter. That would be pathetic. Draco was many things but pathetic was not one of them. Mostly. A tear escaped a corner of his eye and he wiped it away angrily.
Harry turned on his heel and followed Draco into their office. He was breathing hard and wanted to punch the wall. Instead, he stepped into the office gingerly, wanting to assure Draco he was none of the things Smith had thrown in his face. The sight of Draco, hunched over his desk, his shoulders slumped in defeat, almost broke his heart.
"Took you long enough. What were you doing there, Potter? Wanking?" Malfoy smirked at him from his seat behind the desk.
"Potter," Robards stood next to him.
"I didn't…" Harry gasped. "Oh, right. Well, thank you, Kreacher, that will be all."
„Oh my God, you‘re brilliant,“ Harry exclaimed.
"Wow, that was epic," Potter breathed out and coughed. His eyes were lit up partially with amazement and partially by the reflection of the flames, quickly engulfing the mansion.
„Hi Hermione,“ he said, grinning.
„I saw him kiss some guy in an alley. I‘m so sorry Harry, it was so awful, they were grinding against each other and… That was three weeks ago. I‘ve honestly forgotten about it until Ron told us you're together,“ Ginny‘s eyes glistened with unshed tears. „I‘m so sorry Harry, you don‘t deserve that.“
"Wait," he held Harry at arm's length. His head was spinning. "I want to take it slow."
Suddenly, a hand pulled Draco's glass out of his own grip. Draco scowled at the hand and followed its movement up to where the glass was brought to a set full lips.
"You're killing me, Draco," he whimpered.
"Alpha entering the front door," came a whisper in Harry's ear and he jumped a bit. He couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiousness and he forced himself to breathe in and out calmly. He looked around carefully, trying to find any traces of recent human activity. He couldn't see anything, the windows were dark, and the long, dry blades of grass seemed to be unbroken, as much as he could see by the moonlight.
"Hermione!" Harry squeaked. "For fuck's sake, don't say things like that, you sound just like Ron."
Harry looked at him in disbelief. The corners of his mouth twitched. All of a sudden, Harry burst out laughing.
Harry grabbed his hand and intertwined their fingers together. He pulled him out of the toilet and back into the noise of the club.
"Understood," Potter nodded.
„Thanks, Dr-, eh, my boyfriend will love this,“ Harry stuttered, examining the label on the bottle.
„Please, Ron, Hermione,“ Harry said calmly. „Don‘t call Draco Ferret, just call him Draco. It means a lot to me.“ He waved his arm about. „This means a lot to me. My two best friends and my boyfriend having a civilized dinner. Please?“
"Why are you smiling?" Malfoy sounded exasperated. "Are you even listening to me?"
"Harry," Draco breaths out, his voice ragged, coarse.
„Three months? But you broke up with Ginny three months ago!“ Ron shouted. „Don‘t tell me you broke my sister‘s heart because of the pointy Ferret!“ He was pointing the doughnut in Harry‘s direction threateningly.
Harry forced himself to stay silent, wand poised to strike the moment Ginny uttered the first curse. He understood what Draco was trying to do. If Ginny confessed, if she told him in detail how she planned to hurt Draco, Harry could disarm her before she actually cast any of the spells.
At that moment, the house-elves carried in a large tray with a whole cooked monkfish placed on top of a bed of fresh rocket. Harry gulped and stared into the dead eyes of the fish. The sight made him sick and he wanted to stab the eyes out with his fork.
"That's right," Draco nodded. "You seem to actually pay attention for once."
"I said moron first, come up with your own insults, dolt!"
"OK, I think will be better this way," Harry nodded, a sad smile playing on his lips.
"He's not breathing, there must be internal damage," the medi-wizard reported and drew a Portkey out of his green robes. "We have to risk transporting him now or we'll lose him!"
"I know this is going to sound weird but…" Harry paused for a minute, then carried on, looking Draco in the eyes intently. "Can I kiss you? I need to kiss you one last time. I understand if you don't…"
Draco chuckled and wrapped himself against Harry's back. He pressed his soft cock between Harry's buttcheeks and pulled him closer.
He felt a slick finger push inside him forcibly and he welcomed the intrusion. Harry loved the feeling of the slow burn, of being stretched by one finger, then two, then three but not tonight. Tonight he wanted to be roughed up by Draco, he wanted to be fucked so hard he wouldn't be able to walk tomorrow.
Draco caught his wrist and replied to Harry‘s questioning gaze. „Later, now come here.“
"Of course I missed you, you twat! You know what, just forget it," Harry dismissed him with a wave and went to his desk. He sat down in his chair. It was good to be back home even though Malfoy was being a bigger nuisance than usual. Harry was happy to see him again and he sneaked a peek at him from under his lashes. He had either forgotten just how stunning Malfoy was or he was even more gorgeous than usual today.
"So did I!" Harry shouted. "I don't want a new partner. I want Malfoy back! We work well together."
"Type Twos are the ones we should focus on primarily," Draco said out loud. "They retain more of their personality and in general are smarter than Type Ones. Type Twos will follow you around, some of them will even try to hurt you on purpose."
Harry stared at the last point for a long while. Pansy said that Malfoy spent hours making the brochure for Harry. Which meant Malfoy actually cared about Harry and didn't want him to die. Harry recalled the feel of Malfoy's fingers against his forehead as Malfoy wiped off the blood from Harry's face. Malfoy's gaze had been gentle and caring, and Harry hadn't felt that safe in a long while. Harry's heart skipped a beat and he felt a pleasant heat spread through his whole body. Malfoy cared about him. He slammed the booklet shut just as Malfoy entered the room with two mugs of coffee. He handed one to Harry, a simple white mug with a drawing of a barn owl on it. Malfoy's mug was one of those awful ones with "Saviour Harry Potter" photograph on it that you could buy in Diagon Alley for a galleon. Malfoy smirked and took a sip of his coffee.
„Why can‘t I tell that story, Draco? You‘re such a prude!“ Blaise complained loudly.
Harry didn't wait for an answer and stalked out of Robards's office. He knew he was pushing his luck but he couldn't help it. He would do anything to protect Draco and the fewer people knew about what was happening, the better.
"Get your dirty arse off my desk, Potter," Draco sneered at him.
, he corrected himself. From the wooden floor and the vintage metal filing cabinets, to the carved wooden chairs and the dark-haired secretary, who was turned sideways from Harry filing her nails, the reception couldn't be any more cliche. A lit cigarette was placed in a glass ashtray, the smoke trailing from it in a thin stripe toward the ceiling. The secretary ignored him completely, studiously examining her cuticles.
"Twat," Draco shot back.
„Shut up or I‘ll leave you here,“ Harry grinned back.
"Stop laughing, you tosser! It's not funny," Harry's face burned bright red but he chuckled anyway.
"Potter," Malfoy sounded exasperated. "I believe you. I'm sure you are more than capable of taking care of yourself in a fight against Dark wizards and criminals, with hexes flying all around you. I'm certain your Shield Charm is nearly impenetrable. But you have no idea how to fight off a Spectre or a Poltergeist. It took me and Theo nearly a year of research to come up with the defenses we use now. All of it through trial and error," Malfoy turned around and looked at Harry. Something like pain crossed his eyes. It was gone in a second but Harry knew he didn't imagine it. "I'm not taking you, that's my final word."
„Did it bother you?“ Harry raised his head and smirked at him.
„Harry, why are you obsessing over Malfoy‘s hair?“ Ron asked dubiously.
Greyback pats Draco's cheek. "What a pity you have to die. I will have to find someone else to use."
Harry jumped over to a table and poured Draco a glass of water. Harry‘s eyes were glassy, the green of his irises brighter than ever, the whites of his eyes shot through with red veins. He must have been crying for hours, Draco thought with a pang. Draco gratefully accepted the glass of water and took a gulp that immediately soothed his throat.
"Stop, Harry," Hermione interrupted him abruptly. "I meant what I said. I want you to be happy. And if giving it a shot with Draco is what it takes for you to be happy, go for it."
During their briefing earlier that day, they had memorized the blueprints of the mansion. The house was built in the 1850s as a residence of a wealthy lord. Later on, when the noble died with no heir, the mansion was auctioned and sold off. It changed its owner many times until it last served as a sanatorium for mentally ill patients during World War II. Since then it had been left to lie idle.
Draco's grey eyes shot up to meet Harry's emerald ones.
Dearest Draco,
Harry looked at him plaintively, trying to convey through his eyes and facial expression how much he wanted to be Draco's friend. He realized with a start he would rather be Draco's friend and watch Draco fall in love with someone else, than not have Draco in his life at all.
"Harry, wait. I think I know why the spell didn't work," Draco's heart rate sped up. He took a deep breath, hoping his deduction was correct. "I'm so stupid for not realizing sooner. The iron prevents ghosts from entering the protective circle. It blocks off the ectoplasm entirely. It means we can't cast the spell from inside the circle."
„Treacle tart, Malfoy? Really?“ Harry choked out. His eyes were locked on Malfoy‘s lips.
Harry hung the wet towel across a back of a chair and grabbed a spare blanket from the wardrobe. He didn't want to risk waking Draco up by trying to drag the bedsheet from underneath him. Harry gently lay beside Draco and curled into his side. Draco sighed contentedly in his sleep. Harry tucked them both in and drifted off to sleep.
"Oh God, I wanted to do that for hours," Potter babbled. "You're so beautiful. I missed you in Chicago so much."
The staircase unfolded with a loud creaking sound that echoed through the otherwise silent house. A dog barked outside. Harry coughed as a layer of dust fell down through the unused opening. He steeled himself and placed one foot on the first stair. The staircase was more of a ladder, it was old, wooden, and rather wobbly. Harry hoped it would hold both him and Draco without collapsing under their combined weight. He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans one by one and checked the temperature displayed on his thermometer. Thirteen degrees. It was getting colder. He took another step, using one hand to steady himself on the flimsy railing, while still gripping the thermometer tightly in the other hand. He could feel the air getting chillier with each step he took as if the attic was drafty. It was hard to tell, in these old houses, when the coldness was caused by a deteriorated insulation and when the presence of ghosts was at play. Harry was in the middle of the staircase when he realized there was a strange sound coming from above him. Almost like… he stopped and frowned, trying to place the origin of the sound.
"I think I can hear it again," Harry gulped. "There are footsteps below us. What do we do now?"
"Not really, it wasn't the same without you," Malfoy smirked. Then, as if he realized what he had inadvertently admitted, he looked away and took a long sip of his Firewhiskey.
"Where are my things?" Harry asked suddenly. "And why is there a picture of… I don't even know what that is on my desk?"
Draco inserted a bookmark between the pages of the book and closed it. He grabbed Harry's hand and let himself be pulled up into Harry's embrace.
"Alright, Potter, what's your most embarrassing sexual experience?" Draco asked shamelessly. He needed to break the oppressive sadness that had settled over them. They needed to think positively so that their feelings wouldn't make the ghost awaiting them stronger. He'd found that jokes worked the best and the fastest to improve the mood.
"Sure," Harry nodded and smirked at him in return. Based on Pansy's quips, Malfoy was attracted to Harry too. Harry decided he wouldn't hide what he wanted anymore. He longed to wipe the smirk off of Malfoy's face with his tongue and he let it show in his eyes.
Draco knew that people thought he was still the same person he used to be; an arrogant and selfish prat. He wanted to make them understand he was different now, that he truly cared. After seeing the atrocities Voldemort had committed, after being forced to commit some of those atrocities himself, Draco never wanted to cause such pain to anyone again. Sometimes, however, it was too difficult to try and persuade others about the change of heart he'd had. He didn't have time to argue now. He needed to find Potter. He would let his actions speak for himself.
"Nope, I just said it to get rid of that bothersome hag," came the reply as Draco started off through the corridor, presumably in search of the kitchen, leaving Harry behind.
I see you, was what Harry desperately wanted to say but his courage left him before he could utter those words.
„At least you didn‘t get the full story, with all the gory details,“ Draco shuddered.
"Take Cold Maiden, for example. They radiate powerful feelings of melancholy and malaise, but they rarely draw close to the living. We've only encountered one or two on our cases so far. Another one would be a Grey Haze. Those manifest as shapeless patches of faintly glinting mist. We don't know why but even if you walk directly through a Grey Haze, you can't get ghost-touched by them. It must have something to do with the ectoplasm, most possibly it being spread over such a wide area. It must be less concentrated, at least that's my theory. In all honesty, I haven't had a chance to investigate it in detail yet but maybe Granger can help us there?"
"What are you thinking, Harry?" Nott asked curiously.
„You‘re the best thing that‘s ever happened to me, Harry. And this is the only time I‘m saying it. I am not some sappy Hufflepuff!“ Draco smirked, torn between hiding behind his safety blanket of pretend arrogance and showing Harry how much he truly cared about him. Remembering Harry‘s near panic attack just minutes ago, he realized that making Harry feel safe and loved was more important to him than staying in his comfort zone.
„Nothing,“ Harry snarled at him.
He pressed his ear to the door and listened for any tell-tale screams and stray hexes.
Harry closed the bathroom door shut behind him and leaned heavily against it. He breathed out. He knew Draco was supposed to rest so it wasn't fair that he tried to coerce Harry into having sex with him. Especially when all Harry wanted was to nuzzle, kiss, and lick every bit of Draco's skin he could possibly reach. His prick was hard and straining against his jeans. Harry didn't know how he was going to survive the rest of the weekend without pouncing on Draco now that he got him back. Harry thought he'd lost him forever and therefore was ecstatic (and hard) ever since Draco let him cuddle him in the hospital bed.
For the first five days of his suspension, Harry stalked around his flat, grumbling at the injustice he had been subjected to. He re-organized his kitchen cupboards and sorted the food ingredients by alphabet. He cleared out his wardrobe, throwing out clothes he no longer wore. He went through his stores of emergency potions and stocked up on Hangover and Pepper-Up potions. Once his flat gleamed with cleanliness, he packed his bag and moved to Hermione's flat for a few days, where he proceeded with his bout of cleaning and managed to reorganize all her bookcases in one day, while Hermione was at work. When she returned, she screamed at him for what seemed like an eternity and forced him to put the books back to their original place. That was easier said than done as Harry couldn't remember the books' former placement on the shelves and he spent another four days on that task until Hermione was satisfied.
"I might or might not have visited her yesterday when you weren't there," Harry blushed slightly. "Do you still love me then?"
"Shhh, it's in the past. I'm alive, I'm here," Harry whispered. "I'm not going anywhere."
"Don't even think about it," Draco warned him.
He pronounced every word deliberately slowly, exaggerating every syllable in his posh accent. "There are two basic types of ghosts you can encounter. Type One and Type Two. Theo, Blaise, and I classified the relatively harmless ones under Type One. However, that doesn't mean you can let your guard down around them. A Type One can easily off you if you don't pay attention at all times to its location."
"You've changed," Malfoy cocked his head to the side, studying Harry intently.
It was just after six in the afternoon when Harry heard the tell-tale whoosh of the Floo from the living room.
Draco's eyebrows shot up before he could stop himself. He growled when the realization hit him. "I didn't agree to anything. What did Potter tell you?"
Harry subtly stepped into the path of a likely coming hex and held out his hands in supplication.
"I'm sorry Ron, I'm really sorry about Ginny," Harry whispered hoarsely. "But I couldn't have stayed with her. It wouldn't have been right. I couldn't keep lying to her and to myself. I just wish she understood that. I've never wanted to hurt her, I promise."
"I'm not going to…," Potter was interrupted by Pansy's smooth voice.
"Are you OK, baby?" Harry took Draco's face in his hands and looked into those beautiful grey eyes. Draco looked confused and uncomprehending for a moment. Tears of relief and happiness streamed down Harry's cheeks. It was over. Draco was safe.
"You look happy!"
Harry bit his lips and stared at Draco as if trying to gain strength for something. He bunched his hands in fists and straightened his spine, sticking out his chin in the process. Draco recalled the numerous times he'd seen Harry like this back at Hogwarts. Harry looked as if he would start a fight any second now, at least that was what Draco's mind related with the posture. However, the sentence that left Harry's lips was the complete opposite of what Draco had been expecting.
Draco woke up in the hospital. Again. He was quite familiar with his surroundings and wasn't surprised at all to see the white ceiling above him. What was new, however, was the feeling of something warm curled in his palm. Draco moved his head. It was a hand. Harry Potter was sitting in a chair next to the bed, fast asleep, holding Draco's hand.
"Pansy," Draco repeated forcefully. When she didn't even bat an eyelash in his direction, he crumpled the note he'd written to Potter in his fist and threw it at her. To his utter delight, it hit her straight in the face.
"You're no fun, Harry," Draco complained playfully. "But I meant it, I need some help in the bathroom."
„Get the fuck out,“ Harry shouted again. He grabbed Draco‘s book that was lying on a coffee table and threw it into the fireplace.
Harry still couldn't see what that had got to do with anything and why anyone would be jumping up in their seat because of a homonym.
"It could mean the ghost is tied to this place somehow but it's not the manifestation point," Draco answered after giving it a thought. "Or the insulation on the window is not done properly and the owner turned off the heating because she doesn't use the room anymore," he grinned.
"Good morning, Mr. Malfoy," Ms. Huntley's irritating voice grated at Harry's nerves.
A few moments later, he pried Hermione away gently and rested his palms on her arms. "Promise me you'll leave work on time today. I'll come to yours once I get back from the raid Robards had planned for tonight."
"Pleasant lady, that one, isn't she?" Draco asked cheerfully.
Harry grinned at her. "This is going to be right up your alley then."
"I'm glad you approve of my vicious, sneaky ways. You were a Slytherin, after all," Draco replied offhandedly. He couldn't help the jibe.
„Hi Harry, thank you for inviting us,“ Hermione greeted him with a kiss on the cheek.
"I would rather not parade Draco around the Headquarters. Not while I still have a say in it," Harry reasoned. "I would prefer if you stopped by in the evening. We're having dinner over at the Malfoy Manor tonight. You're welcome to join us at seven."
"Yeah, a right hag she is. Anyway, we might have to come back here. The Source might be hidden somewhere in this room but we have to let the ghost lead us to it."
"Draco, you're such a git, you scared me," Harry breathed out in relief. "Well, you're not supposed to exert yourself this weekend. Doctor's orders."
Harry smiled broadly, ignoring Malfoy's jibes. His heart was beating fast against his ribs. "That's brilliant, Malfoy! I can't wait to see you locate a Source," Harry jumped up from his chair in excitement and moved around the table to place his hands enthusiastically on Malfoy's biceps. "Do you see how amazing that is? We can actually help people!"
It seemed to work as Harry shook off the beginnings of the malaise that had been creeping on him, lifted his wand, and shouted the incantation out loud. "
„Sorry mate,“ Ron had the decency to look sheepish.
"Draco, please, please breathe." Potter's voice was desperate. In these moments, Draco could pretend Potter actually cared about him.
"Everyone, back to Apparition site," Robards shouted over the Listening Spell.
"Negative," Hopkins answered almost immediately. "Nothing recent. The door was unlocked, clear of any traces of magic."
Harry shifted over so that he was spooning Draco. He hugged him with one arm and pulled him close. Life could be amazing, Harry thought to himself as he inhaled the smell of Draco‘s shampoo and listened to his soft breaths. The last thought that crossed Harry‘s mind before he drifted off to sleep was how perfectly he and Draco fit together.
As soon as the bell rang, Malfoy stepped in front of the desk where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting.
„Harry, what is it, is Draco alright?“ Narcissa‘s voice sounded panicked.
"You do?" Harry sniffed.
Harry did as he was told without really meaning to. Why would Hermione not tell him that the supposedly best ghost-hunting agency was owned by the Slytherins? Or at least co-ran by a Slytherin. Surely, Harry thought, it couldn't get any worse.
Draco narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "That's OK, I'll just get a chair from some other table."
"Now I'll hate myself forever for believing anything my father has ever told me. I hate myself for acting the way I did. I want out Harry," Malfoy's voice is broken and pleading. It tugs at Harry's heart in a way he never thought possible.
„Are you going to stand there and annoy me with your breathing or are you going to come in?“ Draco called out. He ignored his mother‘s pointed glare.
„Shut up, Potter,“ Draco growled and kissed Harry hard on the mouth. Harry‘s mouth was unmoving under Draco‘s lips. He nipped and softly bit Harry‘s lower lip, then licked it in apology with his tongue. Draco could feel Harry relax almost imperceptibly under his ministrations. Suddenly Harry tensed again and pushed Draco away.
"Will you stop fidgeting, already!" Ron hissed in Harry's ear from his seat next to him.
"Harry I know you are trying to protect me. And I know you are still feeling guilty and it influences your actions and decisions. But this is my life, you have to let me live it," Draco whispered against the soft skin, just under Harry's ear.
Harry had to admit that the years had treated Malfoy kindly. He was wearing a crisp white shirt with the top two buttons undone, revealing a stretch of pale skin and jutting collarbones. His cornflower-blue trousers were adorned with a black, presumably designer, belt. Black lacquered shoes completed the outfit. The most interesting part of Malfoy's clothing, however, was a brown leather shoulder holster. Malfoy had always been taller than Harry but now his height was accompanied by a set of broad shoulders and a thin waist. If Harry didn't know any better, he would have thought that Malfoy lifted weights in his free time. Hard, lean muscles were visible where the sleeves of his shirt had been rolled up. His hair was as pale as ever, short on the sides, longer on top. Malfoy must have spent ages in the bathroom that morning styling his hair because the longer strands were arranged in artful waves. His face was smoothly shaved. From afar his skin looked baby-smooth and Harry felt a sudden compulsion to touch Malfoy's cheek to see for himself.
Potter obeyed without question. It didn't escape Draco's lust-addled brain that this was the first time Potter did as instructed without arguing. Draco filed that information for later.
"Now that's a first," Draco chuckled good-naturedly. He wrapped his arms around Harry, settled himself snuggly on the sofa, and closed his eyes with a content sigh.
"Like," Harry's breathing was ragged in Draco's ear as he slipped his hand to the front of Draco's trousers and palmed his hard cock through the fabric. The touch was electric and Draco felt his balls draw up.
"Tell him yourself," Smith snarled.
Harry smiled to himself. He loved their banter and taunts. He couldn‘t imagine having a relationship where he wouldn‘t be able to tease his partner mercilessly and his partner wouldn't tease him in return. Hell, who was he kidding, he couldn‘t imagine having a partner who wasn‘t Draco Malfoy. Harry stood up and offered Draco his hand.
"Like what?" Harry perched himself on the corner of Malfoy's desk.
"Right, and you want me to believe you're doing this out of the goodness of your heart? That you genuinely want to help people?" Tracey snorted derisively.
"It's always you two," Robards shook his head tiredly. "You're going to drive me to the Janus Thickey ward. I think a week there would seem like a holiday compared to what I have to go through with you." He sat down and closed his eyes. He groaned loudly. "You're dismissed. And send Goldstein in, will you?"
"Hey, you," an arm landed on Draco's shoulder and someone pressed close to his side.
Potter smiled at him and Draco's stomach fluttered at the sight of Potter's magnificent smile directed at him.
Harry stared at Malfoy's hand for a second. It was pale, the fingers thin and long. Malfoy's grip was surprisingly strong. Harry pushed his hand off and stepped hastily through to Grimmauld Place.
look," Draco pointedly raised his eyebrow to bolster his statement.
„I know but I still missed you. Today was such a strange day, I feel like I haven‘t seen you in weeks, not just a few hours,“ Draco slurred, his voice heavy with sleep.
All of a sudden, there was a knock on the door. Pansy marked her spot in the book and with a grunt, she untangled herself from her cocoon. Bloody Draco, how many times did she tell him to come in through the Floo? His reply was always the same; the Floo powder was hard to wash off completely and he didn't want to risk leaving a trace of it on himself when going out to hunt ghosts. On one hand Pansy understood his reluctance to use magic. On the other hand, the restrictions Draco had put in place still made her want to claw his eyes out sometimes. Especially when she was forced to cook the Muggle way.
The ghastly faces became clearer, contorted in a grimace of rage as they started advancing toward Harry as one. Their lips were moving, eyes bulging out, hands reaching out.
"I don't know, Harry," she whispered and drew him into a motherly embrace.
"I'm going to run you the bath," Harry squeaked and fled the room.
„Mr. Malfoy, I'm doctor Hayhurst and I will be your primary doctor during your stay here. Are you OK with Mr. Potter hearing your diagnosis or would you prefer him to wait outside?“ the medi-wizard asked formally.
„OK, OK, I‘m coming,“ Harry growled.
"As soon as this is over, let's take a week off, let's go somewhere you've never been to but always wanted to visit. I'll follow you anywhere you want me to," Harry whispered and stole a kiss from Draco. Their tongues immediately started dancing against each other in an exciting, yet comforting manner. Draco felt he could get drunk on the sweet taste that was purely Harry and groaned as his cock started to fill in.
"I'm so tired I don't even want to have sex," Harry yawned as if to stress his words.
"Three in the span of a month," Mr. Gladstone's hand was shaking as he took a sip of his tea. The cup rattled against the saucer as he put it down again. "The police is running their own investigation into the deaths. Of course, they were not able to find any reason why our guests died. Our establishment is closed until the case is solved. I don't have much money left and I cannot afford the business to be closed for more than a few months at best. You have to help me, Mr. Malfoy. I can't sell the place, it is my whole life."
He felt spells being fired at the Shield but so far it held. Draco almost made it. He was nearly through the door to the Entrance Hall when he felt a curse slash through his Shield. It hit him straight between his shoulder blades. Draco fell to his knees, the pain lacing through his whole body. He tried to breathe in but started choking on his own blood. The spell must have slashed through his lung. Panic seized him.
None of them said anything and they stayed like that for long minutes.
He was patted on the shoulder by Weasley one. "See you at work, mate." With that, he eyed Draco wearily and nodded at him. Draco nodded back. Weasley disappeared in a flash of bright green flames.
"Robards benched us. We're off the field for the rest of the week. What have you done this time?" Ron asked him slowly.
"Set up the chains, now," Draco told Harry, trusting him he would follow his instructions. "I'll keep an eye out for Mrs. Emsworth's mother. Well, her ghost, anyway. What type do you reckon it is?"
"I want you inside me," Draco mumbled and pulled Harry into a languid kiss.
"Hey, my arse is exquisite, I'll have you know," Potter shot back indignantly.
"I'm sorry, Harry, but Auror Malfoy specifically requested to be partnered with Auror Goldstein," Robards looked compassionately at Harry. "I thought you were getting along these days."
"The thermometer, Potter! I have no idea what you thought I was talking about," Draco pretended to be offended. "You're such a pervert."
Guilt coiled in his stomach. He wasn't able to look Hermione in the eyes as he said it and was thankful for having the conversation over Floo. He wouldn't have been able to pull off lying to her like this in person. "I have to go now, I'm going to take a nap so that I'm rested for the evening."
There was a plush, beige carpet on the floor and a flower-patterned wallpaper decorated the walls of the corridor. Other than that, it was empty, bare, void of furniture. Several paintings hung from the walls to each side. There were two doors on the right and two on the left.
Harry's voice was deep and sultry. Every word he sang resonated deep down in Draco's chest. For a second he hated the guy Harry was surely thinking about while pronouncing those syllables. Why had Harry insisted on Draco seeing this?
Harry groaned and buried his face in his palms in frustration. Why did Draco always have to take Harry's teasing the wrong way? Harry wanted to take Draco's hand in his and never let go. Now that Draco almost died in his arms, Harry never wanted to part from Draco, he wanted to keep him safe every bloody minute of every bloody day. Draco didn't seem to share Harry's sentiment.
"Of course not, don't be ridiculous, Potter. I am worried about the reputation of my agency," Malfoy's body tensed, his tone mocking.
"Why were you so angry?" Pansy asked.
"Smith certainly would," Draco closed his eyes.
„Good, that‘s good,“ Draco whispered against Harry‘s lips. „I‘m still loose from our morning fuck and I want you to take me right here, right now, on your desk. I want you to remember shagging me here every single time you're sitting at your desk.“
„Don‘t speak with your mouth full, Ron,“ Hermione admonished him. Then she turned her attention back to Harry. „What‘s his name?“ she asked, successfully ignoring all prior mentions of blowjobs as well as the wet crumbs stuck to the top of the coffee table.
An oppressive silence enveloped the table. Harry felt sick again. He got up from the chair, nearly toppling it over. "Excuse me for a minute," he swallowed hard and ran out of the room.
"I wasn't screaming," Harry scowled. "I was…"
"Tortured," Harry repeated, steeling himself. "Not that many people knew about us. It hasn't even hit the Daily Prophet yet."
"That would be a Changer. A very rare but powerful Type Two. Changer, not very original, is it? Theo came up with that name and let's just say he's never been the poetic sort. Anyway, as the name suggests, they can alter their appearance during a manifestation. Imagine a ghost with octopus-like tentacles. Ugh," Draco shuddered at an unpleasant memory. Potter chuckled.
He was surprised to see Ginny‘s face in the flames.
"Yeah, I know how that sounds," Harry let out a breath. "The thing is, I can't help it but be attracted to him."
"How did it go?" Nott asked Harry carefully.
„Right, you‘re not feeling well. Yet you stayed out till eleven? Are you fucking serious right now?“ Harry asked furiously, trying hard not to shout. There goes being calm, the surpressed rational part of his mind supplied.
Harry couldn't believe it, Malfoy came to save him. He wasn't the indifferent bastard Harry thought him to be. In fact, Malfoy looked positively Gryffindorish back in the asylum. The way he commanded him and Pansy, his natural leadership shining through, the way he almost recklessly disregarded his own safety measures and rules regarding the magnesium flares. Malfoy seemed in his element, rushing to save the day. To save Harry. Harry beamed at him, excited and a little giddy. He couldn't wait to do this again, with Malfoy of all people.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's thigh under to table to keep him calm. "No, I have not been in contact with any Death Eaters since the end of the war. Excluding my father of course. I and Mother visit him every two weeks, on Sundays, in Azkaban," Draco replied calmly.
Harry nearly strangled him there and then. He saw Draco flee into their office, the door slamming shut behind him. Harry turned slowly toward Smith, his eyes blazing dangerously.
Harry stood back and watched the medi-wizards Vanish Draco's clothes, baring his chest. It was covered with drying blood, scarlet contrasting with Draco's pale body. Harry's stomach lurched and he felt bile rise up his throat. The medi-wizards worked on Draco, trying to stabilize him enough with a set of basic first aid spells to make sure he survived the Portkey travel.
„No, did you cast Muffiato?“ Harry retorted.
"Oh God, he wouldn't," Granger suddenly gasped almost inaudibly.
Harry slowly crossed the space and opened the door on the left gingerly, revealing a children’s bedroom. Nineteen degrees, he noted with relief. Dark shapes littered the polished wooden floor that gleamed in the dim moonlight coming in through the window. The room was darker than the corridor, meaning it was likely situated toward the back garden. Harry discerned the shapes on the floor as toys, books, and clothing. Two beds with patchwork bedding were placed in each corner of the room. A desk was situated under the window opposite the doorway he was standing in. An armoire occupied the space to his right. Harry inhaled the scent of baby powder mixed with fresh laundry and what he could only describe as happy childhood. As he moved inside to investigate the bedroom closer, he stumbled on a box he didn't notice lying on the floor. It toppled over and several round objects rolled out of it. The sound was too loud in the silence of the house. It reverberated through the room, the rumble of rolling balls echoing in Harry's ears. His heart was hammering against his ribs and he could almost taste his pulse in his throat.
„Please, Mr. Potter, let me finish,“ the doctor asked politely. He seemed to expect a similar reaction and appeared capable to deal with potential outbursts.
Harry lowers himself carefully next to Draco and wraps his arms tightly around him. Draco curls into his embrace and cries. They stay like that for what feels like hours.
Harry slid the remains of the ripped shirt off Draco's arms and let it fall to the floor. He let the tips of his fingers caress Draco's wrists, up his arms to his shoulders. Harry's head was buried in the crook of Draco's neck and he was breathing hard. Draco couldn't believe that such a simple touch could make him that turned on. He felt goosebumps rise on his arms and on his sides. His nipples hardened and his cock jumped in his come-stained trousers. Harry took a step back and Draco's breath caught in his throat at the look of pure love in Harry's eyes. Their gazes locked as Harry ran his palms across Draco's pectorals, while his thumbs caressed Draco's nipples. He stared into the emerald green eyes, while Harry's hands roamed lower, and Draco felt his body quiver as Harry undid the buttons of his trousers teasingly, one by one, taking his time. Harry's gaze held more hunger now, as he dragged Draco's trousers down his thighs, taking the pants with it. Draco felt free as he kicked the trousers off and they both finally stood stark naked in front of each other.
it could get worse. "Oh fuck, hell no," he breathed out.
"What is it? What happened?" she asked, concerned. Theo was always full of energy these days. His changed demeanor worried her.
More and more ghosts sprung into existence to his right and left. The room was freezing now and Harry's limbs were starting to grow heavy. Soon he wouldn't be able to move and the ghosts would kill him.
Draco jumped off the table and kissed Harry gently on the lips. He giggled when he heard Ron give a sigh that sounded suspiciously like retching.
"Not bad," he said. "Now will you tell me what it is?"
„Why are we meeting here?“ Draco asked dubiously.
„Harry,“ Draco said louder. He tried to place his fingers against Harry‘s lips to quiet the downpour of desperation that was leaving Harry‘s mouth.
"Of course I didn't tell you. Would you have gone if I told you the best ghost-hunting agency was owned by none other than Draco Malfoy?" Hermione looked at him, her eyes boring into Harry's soul.
"Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix," Harry asks suddenly his eyes trained on Malfoy's face. "You knew it was me. You didn't say anything."
"I would like to hire you," Harry shrugged uncomfortably. Not in a million years would he have thought that one day he would come to ask Malfoy for help.
"Stop staring at me, Malfoy. It's not my fault you can't keep your eyes off of me," Potter growled, his smile changing into a scowl.
Draco eyed him suspiciously. He would have to try to fix it anyway. What if Harry was just pulling his leg?
Harry left Hermione's office and hastily crossed the St Mungo's Spell Damage floor to the closest Floo. He didn't look left or right, he couldn't stand being in this corridor for longer than strictly necessary. Not after what had happened to Ron. He didn't know how Hermione did it, coming to work every day, knowing that… Harry stopped that trail of thoughts immediately. He couldn't think of it, not yet, anyway.
„There‘s nothing like a bit of accidental underage magic, is there?“ Draco shook his head.
Harry stared after her, not daring to get his hopes up. He knew Hermione most possibly forgot to eat at work. He decided to make her tea and pulled a plate of sandwiches he'd prepared earlier that day out of the cooling cupboard. He arranged the cups of tea, the sandwiches, and a plate of cookies on a tray and carried it to the library. Meanwhile, Hermione had spread out several tomes on the coffee table before her. She kept consulting the index pages and flipping through several books seemingly at once. Harry knew better than to ask her any questions right then. Instead, he started slowly nibbling on a cookie. He wasn't hungry but at least it kept him busy while he waited for Hermione to tell him what was going on.
"Pans?" his stomach lurched painfully and his hand started trembling. "I don't know where he lives."
„You‘re going to be the death of me Harry,“ Draco sighed happily.
"Please, don't stop," Draco whimpers.
„Good for you mate, but why couldn‘t have been anyone else?“ Ron crossed his arms stubbornly, having finished his morning snack.
"Falcon?" Harry wheezed. "There's fucking ghosts in here. We have to get out!"
"That's it? I've been gone for two months and you just Potter me?" Harry crossed his arms. He was not able to keep the hurt entirely from his voice.
"Do you need my help with it?" Harry asked hopefully. He was bored to death and longed for something useful to do. He usually hated research but anything was better than another day of cleaning up.
„It wasn‘t a compliment,“ Harry squeaked and blushed. „He‘s so arrogant he can‘t even grab a fork like a normal person!“
"Be careful, I don't like this," Potter squeezed Draco's arm, his touch was there and gone in an instant.
"I will do something really stupid now. Promise me you'll do the right thing, promise me you'll do what needs to be done," he whispers against Draco's lips.
"Three," Draco released the canister and watched it disappear in the darkness. A second later, there were two bright flashes of light as his and Pansy's flares hit the centre of the room. Bright sparks of hot iron filings splattered everywhere. The good thing about magnesium flares was that they spread iron and salt in their vicinity, effectively ridding the area of any ghosts. The bad thing about them was that the Greek fire they created in the process was basically a Muggle version of Fiendfyre. Draco watched in astonishment as the flames spread quickly across the dry wooden floor in a
Harry smiled softly at him. Malfoy smiled back.
"Stop it, you dolt!" Draco snorted and batted the offending hand away.
Draco opened his equipment bag and started taking out various vials and containers, iron chains, and twigs of lavender. He arranged everything on top of his desk and glanced at Potter, who was perched on the edge of the desk, rummaging through the spread-out gear.
"Was there?" Robards growled.
"I promise, Draco, I won't. Come for me. Pretty, pretty please?" Harry repeated Draco's words from earlier. He tightened his arm across Draco's chest and pulled them even closer. Draco was shaking against him, his head was thrown back, his throat stretched in an invitation Harry could not refuse. He bit the side of Draco's neck and ran his tongue along the skin he held between his teeth. Draco's body arched and the loud moan that tumbled out of his throat as he came was music to Harry's ears. God, he'd missed this. He missed this Draco, so vulnerable, yet fearless man, baring his body to Harry's eyes, offering him his soul.
"Don't remember that we what, Potter? Please try to talk sensibly for once in your life," Draco shifted in his seat uncomfortably. "And untie me, would you, you pervert?"
Harry laughed the most beautiful laugh that almost had Draco melting through the floor. He lurched for him again and dragged him into another heart-stopping kiss.
They left the canteen a few minutes later and Harry said his goodbyes to Draco in the lift. There was too much tongue and groping, judging by the gagging sounds that were coming from the corner where Ron was standing. Harry couldn't care less.
Draco's wand lands in Harry's hand and he presses it into Draco's palm. Harry knows Draco understands now. He trusts him. That's when the streak of green light hits him in the back and Harry crumbles to the floor, unseeing, lifeless.
Tracey didn't move. A chill started creeping up Harry's spine again and he looked around briefly. The ghosts had reformed again in the corners of the room and were floating toward him, faster this time. The slight movements of their limbs seemed eager as if they longed to reach him at once. Harry whipped around again and slapped Tracey across the cheek.
Ron tried to retaliate and kick him back but wobbled on his unsteady legs and nearly toppled over. He saved himself by wrapping both of his arms around Draco.
"Harry, for fuck's sake, could you be any clumsier!" Hermione snapped at him when Harry inadvertently dropped a bottle of Skele-Gro potion on the floor. It shattered and splashed all over the room.
"Kreacher," he croaked.
"I don't know, it seems awfully tailored to me, don't you think?" Harry quipped. "All those snide remarks and one picture even represents me running away from the ghosts back in the mansion."
With that, he disappeared back through the door. Draco waited until the door clicked shut behind him. After the noise of the club, the toilet felt oddly quiet, even though Draco could still faintly hear the music and feel the beat juddering under his feet.
"OK," Draco nodded. "But not the Leaky."
„OK, hand me a wand will you?“ Harry commanded him.
„Seriously Potter, if you were any slower, you would walk backwards,“ Malfoy‘s voice drawled.
Harry breathed in and out, desperately praying that McLaggen or Montague would respond. Nothing.
Draco took in a deep breath and grabbed a handful of the Floo powder. He was going to see Harry and Harry would know what to do, where to go from here. He didn't know why but he was sure of it. Excitement bubbled in his chest. He was going to see Harry. Harry, with his beautiful green eyes and rosy lips and maybe, just maybe Draco would get to kiss him. Again. For the first time.
Harry watched her leave apprehensively. "I'm sorry," he sighed the moment she was out of earshot.
Inside his office, Draco lounged in his chair and quirked an eyebrow at Harry. "Jealous much?"
The whole morning passed by quickly in comfortable silence. Both Harry and Ron hated paperwork but Harry would happily stay behind the desk for the rest of his life if it meant Draco's safety. Draco joined them for lunch in the Ministry canteen, and Ron even managed a relatively polite conversation with him about Quidditch. Harry lounged comfortably in his seat and a wave of happiness washed over him. Once they caught whoever was hurting Draco, he would be truly happy. He wouldn't need anything else, he would have everything he ever wanted in life. Draco and his friends, together. Draco caught him looking and smiled at him gently, before returning his attention back to Ron's rant about the Cannons' chances this year.
"I thought you would be happy, you can be partnered with your precious Weasley now!" Malfoy shouted back. He jumped up as well.
"Do you think they will try to kidnap me today?" Draco asked, suddenly turning serious.
„Don‘t worry about them. Pansy knows I‘ve had a crush on you since the fifth year,“ Draco smirked at Harry.
"Working with you might actually be the best thing that happened to me in a very long time," Potter turned serious and leaned tentatively closer in his chair.
"What have you done now?" came Ron's chuckle the moment Harry opened the door of their office.
"What's wrong with you, mate?" Ron finally righted himself and let go of Draco, albeit after two unsuccessful tries.
Seeing Draco so distressed made his heart clench painfully but at the same time, it warmed him more than a hundred warming charms ever could. After a moment, Draco drew in a shuddering breath.
Harry opened his eyes and fixed his gaze at Draco. "Like this?" he asked.
"Why would you go out to a club on Friday night, if not to get drunk?" Ron stared at him in disbelief.
"Draco has just gone to the Atrium. I think this is it. We had lunch together and he didn't mention leaving the Ministry early. We were supposed to meet at home, as usual. He said he was going to leave around 4 PM by Floo," Harry related the details as fast as he could.
"It's not about the money, Potter," Malfoy frowned and shook his head resolutely.
"Malfoy," Harry looked at him plaintively. "I'm not sure how much you are aware of what's going on at the Ministry. They are a bunch of idiots, scared old plonkers who won't acknowledge there even is a Problem. Supposedly they are discussing the best course of action to deal with it. That's bollocks! They are hiding and hoping it will go away, just like they did when Voldemort came back! I can't just sit by and do nothing. And honestly, I think neither can you, otherwise you wouldn't have chosen this job."
