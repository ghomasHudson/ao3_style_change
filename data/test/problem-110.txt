"That doesn't matter. You were a child and you helped too when we were taken here. That took guts, even though you were beyond scared."
"Yes, I suggested to Ginny that I leave the Aurors and take up politics. She was delighted at the idea and suggested taking back my seats herself, just like you predicted, Draco. I'm going to discuss it with Arthur tonight, so it shouldn't be long."
"Harry Potter! How dare you take that awful woman into your house! Under the  same roof as my grandchildren! You bring shame upon us and on your own wife!  That woman is trying to leave my poor Ronnikins, who has never done a wrong  in his life! Who for years has only been slaving away at work to provide  everything for his family! Such a foul woman deserves to be out on the  streets! If you don't throw her out right this minute, you are no longer  welcome in my house!" As those last words came out through the magical  mouth, the Howler burned to ashes.
"Ginny, I've been thinking. Maybe I should move on from law enforcement," Harry started up The Conversation. They had drawn up discussion points with Draco, but he still had to improvise most of it.
As always, I want to thank my wonderful betas. I first want to thank Icicle, who stuck with me. I know I've been bad with updates, but she's much better at them. Then I also want to thank my new beta, the brilliant Faye. She is a constant source of inspiration and encouragement on Facebook. Go like the Drarry Shippers page too, which is admined in part by her. It's a great place to discuss Drarry fanfics. A bit of warning though, because the rating of the page is above 18, just like my story's and also my own page's.
As the fire in the fireplace changed back to its normal colour, Harry sighed in relief. He quickly penned a letter to Hermione and Draco, and then sent it through the Floo. After that, he climbed back up to his bedroom, hoping to get a few more hours of sleep.
"All right, Hermione. I guess you are right. That does sound like a great man. Who would have thought back at Hogwarts, eh?" He tried to laugh it off, but was clearly a bit miffed. Draco even sounded like he had finally bested him.
"I remember you well, too.... I'd better go and sleep this off." Harry got up, wondering which way his room was.
There was a knock on the door and Draco called out to the person to enter. It was Scorpius, who upon seeing Harry, greeted him enthusiastically.
"Oh, Draco! Good morning," Harry greeted the other teen and bounded over to give him a quick peck on the lips. "I made breakfast."
"Oh, let me think now." Hermione paused, gathering her thoughts "It was some time ago. We really got together after he returned and saved Harry during that year. We were together during the supplementary year at school and it was all going well. I was thinking about what sort of an apprenticeship I should apply for. I had my eye on a healer, or perhaps some sort of a research position. It was at that time that Ron started pushing me about marrying straight out of school. I loved him, of course, but wasn't so sure about that. We had been through so much, but we were still so young. Rationally, it didn't seem wise. I also thought of living on my own for a while. I was so dependent on the Weasleys. If I got a job, I didn't have to move to the Burrow after school."
On his way there, he had to pass the interrogation rooms. Just as he was  passing one of the doors, he heard some shouting in spite of the silencing  charms and the door banged open just in front of him. Malfoy hurried out of  the room, or rather tried to, but bumped into Potter and knocked him over.
He heard footsteps and turned to see Draco walking towards him. He sat down next to his head and put a hand on his shoulder as Harry made to get up.
"Yes! You've been an Auror. You went to and fro, waving your wand about and taking down criminals. I'm not saying that's easy work, but not exactly taxing on the mind. Also, I am aware that you defeated Voldemort, but that didn't take a lot of brains either."
After breakfast all the children got sorted out. Draco spoke to the tutor, and Harry got the other two to their respective schools. Upon returning, he was instructed to join Hermione and Draco in the office. He knew that it was time to tell her that she had been under the influence of a potion.
"Sure, it's going to be amusing! We can pay him back for all the shit he  gave us in school," Jimmy said, joining his partner.
They entered the bookshop together and a jolly Christmas tune was playing. Harry looked around and noticed that above the entrance instead of a chime they had a fir tree with a face that animated itself upon their arrival and sang Jingle Bells. The proprietor behind the counter greeted them with a smile on his face.
His phase two began an hour later, so he sat down to have an actual lunch. He did not enjoy it. He realised that he had not eaten so alone like that for a long time. He missed the kids. Ginny too, of course. She was his wife, of course he missed her. Once he finished, he went upstairs to continue reading his book. However, he stopped once he heard the Floo flare downstairs and the voice of his wife and of Ron could be heard calling for him.
“I loved you, Ron, but you destroyed that with your actions.” Hermione looked down on the table, saddened by what she had heard. “You should have trusted that, and me, and us. You didn’t give us a chance. Now here we are, and it all ended, and I can’t trust you anymore. Maybe someday. Sign it, and at least save yourself some of the dignity you have left after everything that has appeared in the papers.”
The dark-haired man thought about it for all of two seconds, until he stuck his hand out. Malfoy eyed it warily, but then took the offered limb all the same. Once they shook on it, they knew that nothing would ever be the same. Now that Harry knew what it was really like to be a Light Wizard, he had no doubt that he would rather be a Dark Wizard.
Harry blushed a bit as what he was going to say wasn't so important as to warrant a visit, but he had no one else to visit on his free day. Besides, he found that he enjoyed Draco's company.
Harry decided not to push for more details and just accepted what he was told. He closed his eyes once more.
"I’m telling him tonight. I'm just not happy, Harry. Ever since the war I feel like I've only been existing, just going along with things. I do everything the way Ron wants it done. We had kids when he wanted them. I stay at home like he wants me to. I can't go on like this. I have to separate myself from him. It's like I'm trapped. Don't get me wrong, I love my children. But I had such plans." She sighed, remembering those days. "I wanted to work in something where I could do a lot of research. Maybe in mediwizardry, or some other science. I wanted to travel, see the world. After the war it seemed like I lost all my passion. I just went along with what Ron said. I lost myself." She was babbling and she knew it, but it was like a dam breaking. Everything was just pouring out of her.
"That is quite enough, Ron. You'd better go home," Ginny injected and quickly helped her intoxicated brother into the Floo. It was a good thing the kids stayed with their grandmother that night.
"That is why I'm trying to push through an educational reform. It would integrate the ones like you both, better to our society. Our generation knows that we can't remain purebloods for long, so we're finding alternatives."
They walked along the Alley arm-in-arm. A chilly wind swept through the street and Ginny cuddled closer. Harry looked down at her face and could see that she was still a bit cross with him. She wasn't paying attention to him, as instead, she was eyeing the package in Harry's hand.
"Alright, Harry. Like before, if you don't like it, then you can still push me away." Draco broke him out of his thoughts, got up from the sofa opposite Harry, and walked over, just like the night before.
The pool room was a lot like the greenhouses he had previously visited. The ground wasn't stone or wood but actual warm sand. It wasn't as white as in Thailand but rather beige. There were palm trees surrounding a large pool that apparently got deeper the further someone went in from the entrance. The pool itself was tiled with blue tiles that had the pattern of waves on them. Harry also spotted a large Jacuzzi off to the side. His children along with Hermione and Scorpius were playing in the shallower part of the pool, throwing a beach ball around. Harry laughed as Lily squealed when her ball went so high, Scorpius had a hard time catching it. Hermione spotted Harry first, as she was standing in the deepest part and was facing the entrance.
"No!" He purposefully downed another glass and almost broke the glass as he smacked it against the table. "Another one!"
"The Nile, the Danube, the Ganges and the Río de la Plata. They are the major rivers on four continents that they knew about at the time. Each side of the fountain represents one of them."
At that remark, Draco turned his face a bit towards his companion and grinned, his pearly white teeth showing.
"Well, you know what they say... the easiest way to learn a language is in bed." Draco smiled wistfully.
The first flecks of snow arrived, signalling the approach of winter. Harry invited Draco for a stroll, and the blond was surprised to find a snowball in his face. For a moment he almost seemed angry, but then hurled a ball of his own towards Harry. They had fun building a snowman, which of course led to a make-out session in the snow.
The children squealed at the sight of their gifts and dived straight in. Harry stood watching the ruckus with a wide grin. In these moments, he sometimes remembered the time when he was heading towards the Forbidden Forest, ready to die. He thought it was all over, and he would never get a taste of real happiness. How wrong he had been. He looked over to Ginny, who had made it all possible and wanted to thank her. However, he was stopped by the frown on her face, and then he recalled how she always grumbled about the wrapping papers beings thrown about the room. She was always so afraid that her expensive furniture would get damaged in the commotion. He was about to wrap his arms around her to make sure that she would not interrupt them, when Dinky appeared and gave them both a cup of hot chocolate. Harry smiled down gratefully at the little elf.
"Kids, this is the Malfoy family." He walked to Lucius as he was the eldest. "This is Lucius Malfoy." The tall man leaned down and kissed Lily's hand, who giggled at the gesture. Then he shook hands with the boys, exchanging introductions.
"No. I have set myself on this path, and I'm going to walk down on it. I have made peace with my decision. What the light families are doing is just not right."
“No, James. It’s not because of Draco. It’s because it doesn’t work anymore. If it did, then I wouldn’t have looked Draco’s way." Harry wanted the boy to see his reasons. "Please understand, I’m not that kind of a man. I’ve been faithful to your mother for all these years, but I realised that even when she’s here, it’s like being with a stranger. We don’t make each other happy. Therefore, I’ve decided to get a divorce. That I found my happiness with Draco is not connected. Maybe, the two are connected just in that when I closed that chapter of my life, I realised that there was a new chapter waiting for me.” Harry smiled at the blond. “I will never stop loving the three of you. I also want us all to be happy here. I think you have been this past week, and I would like to continue this way.”
"But Harry!" she whined and he felt a bit better for dragging her away. He couldn't stand it when she used that tone of voice.
Harry first visited the bathroom, as it had been a while and he had to toast a couple of times with his champagne to the Wizengamot. He gaped at the gold faucets he had found and remembered the elegant white ceramic ones at Malfoy Manor. He always held a sort of fascination of bathrooms, probably because so many things had happened in the ones at Hogwarts. Therefore, he often only remembered the bathrooms of some of the places he had visited and couldn't recall much of the other rooms.
She just nodded and they exited the shop. Outside, the clear signs of a large storm were gathering. The sky had darkened to almost night and the wind threatened to blow them away. At the first sign of thunder, Ginny almost jumped into his arms.
Apparently, this was another problem. Harry realised that he was being tested and probably not just the man before him was asking the questions, but the whole fraction as well. He felt the butterflies take off in his stomach, but forced them on the ground again to be able to concentrate on giving the best answer possible. He couldn't think properly if he let his nerves take over.
"Ron, what on earth are you doing?" he asked in a whisper. "We were sleeping. Go down to the sitting room and I'll put on a dressing gown."
Harry thought about what to do. He didn't want the children to go, but they  would be with Ginny. Since their mother had started to travel, they had seen  very little of her. Perhaps, this would be a good thing. The children could  be with their mother, they had been missing her anyway, and once everything  blew over, they could return home. He went up to find Ginny and tell her. He  discovered her in James' room, putting his things into a bottomless bag.  Thankfully James wasn't around.
“We all know that you and Ginny had been dosing us with a complacency potion for all these years, but no longer. We could go to court now, and I’d have house-elf testimony for that. Thank you for that, by the way.” She paused for the dramatic effect. “If the Light side wouldn’t have made the law of Magical Creatures being equal in front of the law, then we wouldn’t be able to use it now. But you had to have that, to allow the house-elves to testify against their former masters.”
Harry understood the security measure. Still, he wanted to change and leave his trunk there. After that, he planned to look for her on the beach and maybe get into the water while he was doing that.
“That’s not easily done.” He shook his head at the crazy notion. “Ever since the end of the war the Dark Families, well, what remained of them anyway, have been trying to bring about changes in many laws. We have realised that brute force will not save our culture from Muggles, so now we are trying to change the education system in order to better integrate the Muggle-borns into our culture. It’s my project, but I’m not getting anywhere with it. The Light Families are in majority and they are opposed to any sort of change. They claim that things are fine the way they are.”
if you do. I don’t care if you’re friends or if you hate each other’s bloody guts. But I expect you to behave like professionals. This job is literally life or death. If you can’t manage to get along with your colleagues well enough to trust they won’t hex you when your back is turned, then you have no business being here. We have to be a team. We have to trust each other. And I would expect the two of you, who are among the best in your class, to model that for the rest of the trainees.”
A Patronus suddenly appeared in the kitchen, and Harry recognized it as Draco’s, mostly because it looked so much like his.
“What do you want, Draco?” The voice was suddenly close to his ear, Harry’s warm breath ticking the back of his jaw. “Shall I make it fuck you? Shall I suck you until you come? What do you want?”
“Oh, here we go!" Draco shouted, throwing up his hands. "I’m supposed to just fall at your feet, then, unworthy as I am, since you were so
Malfoy didn’t hesitate to take it, which Harry thought was a good sign. Still, as he thanked Harry and expressed his happiness in being at Hogwarts, his gray eyes searched Harry’s face as if trying to catch something in his expression. Harry kept his smile in place as best he could as he mentally scoured for some harmless topic of conversation he could breach, hoping this would end the uncomfortable scrutiny.
Clint didn’t argue with that, nor agree either. He was quiet, staring into his drink again in thought. “I wanted to. Merlin, I wanted to ask you out. I thought about it. But then there was that pub night, early on, when Hannah mentioned her breakup, and you responded by mentioning yours, and how rough it had been. Your voice shook, you know, when you talked about Evan. I could see how much he had hurt you. And it was so new. The breakup, I mean. It had ended so recently. So I told myself that you wouldn’t be emotionally available anyway, and I let myself off the hook. I told myself that I would ask you out eventually, once you’d had more time to get over your ex, once we’d had more time together to get to know each other. But I was having a hard time getting to know you. You didn’t seem to like me as much as you liked Angelina or Hannah.”
“It’s all right,” Draco said gently to her. “If you need some time alone, I can wait outside as well. There’s no hurry. You can take all the time-“
“Anytime. Do you need help with the question?” he pointed to the Ravenclaw entrance, and the statue that was waiting to give Marissa a riddle to let her inside.
Most of the staff tittered and nodded, giving Sprout, who had announced her retirement before the end of last term, wistful smiles.
Harry did, and the ball filled with purple smoke. Looking more closely, Draco saw that there were also little puffs of yellow here are there, as well as the slightest hint of orange.
“About… switching,” Draco said. When Harry didn’t immediately reply he cleared his throat and continued. “Positions. Or maybe ‘roles’ is the better word. I mean…”
“Draco,” the man said, impatience turning his tone a bit icy, as it often did, “It has been over a year. You are shockingly brilliant, unexpectedly generous, and obnoxiously handsome. It’s about time you found yourself a partner who is worthy of you. Your time is not infinite. So I would think you’d want to stop wasting it.”
him. And he’s not himself. He avoids meals whenever he doesn’t have to be there, he’s closed off, he rarely smiles, and he keeps making excuses not to spend time with me. I think he’s been leaving the grounds a lot, actually. Most nights he doesn’t have patrol.”
to enjoy him as well, at least at the time. But that, he later learned, had been an elaborate ruse. She’d been sleeping with Blaise the whole time.
She put a hand on either side of his face and felt the steamy moisture cling to his auburn stubble. She rubbed her thumbs across his cheeks.
“I also may have outright said that we would be fine if the case went to court, since Fawley always threatens that as a last-ditch effort to intimidate us.”
“I have considered that,” she said with another sigh, looking through the book some more with a distracted air. “But I have yet to find a solution that satisfies me.”
“It appears that Astoria, for the time being, has rather…” The blond swallowed and took a deep breath. “… ruined women for me. I can’t seem to… I have no interest in women, not even gorgeous pureblood Slytherins like Francesca Bianchi, who incidentally I
“I think it would be best if you stayed home from school today and got some rest.” It wasn’t an ideal situation. Harry really needed to be at work, particularly for an important meeting that morning with the PR team, to deal with the Rowle case. But Teddy was more important and, if Harry was honest with himself, he knew he needed the rest too.
Harry went boneless atop him, and Draco rolled them both over while still inside so he was on top. He wasn’t quite finished yet, and he thrust deeply and slowly a few more times into Harry, getting all the pleasure he could, wringing out every last drop. Though worn out, Harry still lifted his arms and wrapped them around Draco, holding him as the blond trembled and moaned, his face pressed against Harry’s sweaty neck.
An elf brought them finger sandwiches and pumpkin juice, and Harry ate and drank while Narcissa flipped through her sample book some more, showing him various possibilities and occasionally asking for his input. He found himself saying “Whatever you think is best” quite a lot, though Narcissa did push him to make an actual choice once or twice. And he did feel strongly about the music.
“I appreciate everything you did, Gerald. Ron and I both owe you a lot. But please, never defend Robards’ decision to me. There is no argument you could make that would make me accept it.”
“Yes,” Harry insisted. “You’re more articulate than I am. You can help me get my point across. And I’ll be braver if you’re there.”
, loved you, and you him, I would have refused to marry you. I would even have avoided telling our parents
student. If you want to teach it to your own students, be my guest. You can build your entire defensive curriculum around the Impediment Jinx, if you like. But you won’t teach it here.”
It had struck her then, what an awful thing memory modification was. It was a cruel practice, really, stealing truths from people's minds and replacing them with falsehoods. Magical people should probably find more humane ways to fix their mistakes, even if they were less convenient.
Francesca put a hand gently on his arm and said, her tone softened now, “It is because you two are my closest friends at Hogwarts, and I want to see you happy.”
Draco opened the book on his desk, and Harry watched over the blond’s shoulder as he rifled through it, turning to a section titled “Oils and Extracts.” There was information on Agama there was well, and Draco read it quickly, his finger sailing down the page. “Yes,” he said finally. “Yes, this will work.”
Draco nodded. “I do believe you. But you’re torn between Harry and your father, understandably. And I… I’m just here for Harry.”
Luckily, Ron seemed to sense this, as he clutched her around the waist with one arm and flipped her onto her back in one fluid motion. She shrieked in surprise and then giggled in excitement, before thinking, suddenly of his injury.
Harry huffed in response, then grabbed another book off the stack, determined to put that uncomfortable interlude behind him. And though he refused to look up, though he tried to convince himself that he was imagining it, he could have sworn he heard another soft chuckle coming from Malfoy’s direction, and he couldn’t help a small smile himself.
He half expected Draco to laugh – Harry was aware he was being a bit awkward – but the blond did nothing of the sort. He merely smiled softly at Harry and held the white box out to him.
Hermione didn’t reply, unsure of how to. About many of the guests, Hermione was sure the other witch was right. But she could also recognize a slight tone of bitterness tainting Andromeda’s words, implying her observation was perhaps a bit skewed. Not that Hermione could blame her.
Harry had nearly finished the essay when the portrait hole swung open and Malfoy emerged through it. He had clearly come from another late-night shower. The words from Harry’s essay may have been swimming in front of his face by that point, but Harry was still awake enough to take in Malfoy’s still-wet hair, thin white t-shirt, and gray Muggle pajama bottoms that hung off of his slim hips. Malfoy looked delicious all relaxed and casual, and Harry couldn’t help staring, or the physical response that came with it.
“In that case, I think I saw a couple of Hufflepuffs sneak off in the direction of the astronomy tower. Surely they’re up to something. I think we ought to go investigate.”
Harry felt fire flare behind his eyes. “You don’t know a fucking thing about it. Yeah, a few times, over the course of eight years or so, we’ve had our rough patches. But he has followed me into more dangerous shit… He has put his life on the line for me more times than I can count. You have no idea. He’s been there for me a lot more than he’s failed me, and when he has been a shitty friend he’s always made it right. And what were you doing for those seven years, huh?” Draco’s face went white, and Harry knew he was wading into dangerous waters, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself. The rage was still burning in him. “Being a snobby, cruel, blood supremacist bastard, that’s what. And yet I forgave
“Hey Hermione, Molly.” It had taken a while to get used to calling Molly Weasley by her first name, but she had drilled it into him unrelentingly after the war, and he was finally in the habit of it.
Harry turned around to face Draco, and the blond caught a glimpse of the unmistakably carnal glow in the other man’s eyes before his mouth was captured in a sensual kiss. Their tongues battled for a moment before Harry pulled away, walking backwards towards the bed. He climbed onto it.
Harry sat up. “He can consider all he likes, but it won’t make a bit of difference. Hermione and Ron are very serious about each other.”
They found themselves in a darkened bedroom in the middle of the night. Vesper could just make out two figures asleep in the bed. She longed to cast
“She doesn’t want to talk to you,” a still-angry Ron told him in the common room that night. “You totally blindsided her with this. She’s devastated, she’s furious, and she will hex you into oblivion if you come near her right now. So just leave it.”
“That’s good to hear,” Longbottom replied. “I don’t think I would want to teach in the same climate I was educated in.” A shadow passed over his face momentarily, and Draco found himself struck with some actual sympathy for the man. It couldn’t have been easy to be the adolescent Neville Longbottom, the screw-up, the victim of bullies, living in the shadow of heroes like Harry Potter and the rest of the Golden Trio. And yet he had found his own way, had become a war hero in his own right. It was… impressive, Draco had to begrudgingly admit.
“Sorry you’re stuck with me, mate,” Ron said as Harry unshrunk his luggage and put it at the foot of his bed. “Only so many rooms, you know.”
Inside was a large owl with distinctive feathers speckled black, white, and gray. It stared at Harry with piercing, intelligent light green eyes.
“Cheers. That’s mighty generous,” said David. “I’m sure you’ll want to give that to Jack in person. As for the wine,” he turned to Draco, “I can take that, mate. In fact, that’s open that up and get you a glass, yeah? Unless you’d rather have something else.”
Harry ran a hand lightly up and down Draco’s abdomen. “I wouldn’t know about the actual mechanics of doing it with two other men, as I’ve never done that before. But there are ways to experience something similar with just one partner and the right toys.”
He looked up into Draco’s face and saw unmistakable guilt written there. “You did what you thought was best, love. You shouldn’t feel guilty about it.”
“Well, there you have it. And frankly, even if he had, he probably would have been lying to hurt you anyway.”
“A top box,” she said proudly. It had taken some finagling to get her hands on it, even for a Cannons match. Luckily she had learned, back in August, that a coworker of hers knew a guy who knew a guy, and she had managed to procure a ticket. “All to yourself. It seats a dozen, so you can bring whoever you like. Harry, Theo, Dean, all of them, and more.”
That made Vesper laugh. “That sounds fun. I’m not dating right now, but I could use a friend too.” He smiled. “I can’t do it tonight, though. I have plans.” This was sort of true. She had promised Harry and Draco she would floo call them in the evening to tell them about her first day at the Academy, and she found she was really looking forward to it. That, and getting to be home on her own for a few hours. “Maybe later in the week?” she offered.
The gates opened for him, and he stepped through them, making his way down the hedge-lined walk to the manor’s immense front doors. To his left he heard the rhythmic wail of a peacock, and he turned to see a whole group of them, white as the snow, waddling about with their large tails trailing behind them like the lacy trains of wedding gowns. He smiled. He had forgotten about the peacocks. They were a leftover from Lucius' legacy, Draco had explained.
sure of myself then than I am now. Like I’ve moved backwards, almost. I can’t look at myself from six years ago and say, ‘Look how far I’ve come.’ All I can think about is, ‘Look how far I still have to go.’”
Draco gasped as Harry’s hand brushed lightly along his hardening cock. Even now, after four years of marriage, Harry knew exactly how to get Draco going. “Bloody tease,” he growled, nipping at Harry’s bottom lip.
She looked up and gave him a small smile. “He’ll never be my favorite person,” she said reasonably. “Our family hasn’t gotten on with the Malfoys in generations. Not to mention that his father was indirectly responsible for nearly getting me killed.”
“I can’t complain, of course,” Draco went on, his voice getting darker and huskier by the second as he began to undo Harry’s belt and zipper. “I love the way you fuck me.” He dropped to his knees in front of Harry. “I love it when you come inside me.”
“True,” she replied. “Which goes for you as well, and your pureblood upbringing. I didn’t think about it much at the time, of course, but now it’s not hard to imagine how
have something to work from. Guensler’s description could at least give her a sense of what kind of magic they were dealing with, and that alone might be a help.
“Is your goal prevention?” he asked. “Because I imagine that would be rather difficult, given that the magic is, by nature, accidental.”
And then he thought of Potter’s face, smirking and smirking, before the pleasure became too much and he cried out, just as the Potter in his mind was doing.
“We’d share credit down the middle, of course,” Clint said, perhaps trying to guess Kyle’s concern, though he was off the mark. “50-50 in everything.”
He expected a lascivious grin from Draco, but what he got was silence. “Draco?” he asked. “Did I say something wrong?”
“For now,” said Harry. “He’s a Metamorphmagus, like his mum. For the first few months, he was changing his hair and eye color at random. Now he’s older, he automatically matches his looks to who he’s closest to at the time. Eventually, he’ll learn to control it, and change his appearance at will.”
Draco’s entire body clenched in pleasure at those words, and he knew they were in dangerous territory. If they didn’t stop now, they wouldn’t be able to stop at all. He slowed down the pace, getting in a few more light kisses before pulling away.
“He was a brilliant teacher for those he favored,” Draco replied. “But for those he didn’t… there were a lot of missed opportunities, I think. To give
. “At least I can confirm, without a doubt, that you definitely shouldn’t feel guilty about not visiting your uncle on his deathbed. Frankly, you simply ignoring him is far more than he deserves.”
“That’s all I ask,” Pansy said, adjusting in such a way that Draco could tell she was getting comfortable, ready to listen.
“Hmm,” Draco said, considering that. “I suppose you have a point.” The truth was, he’d hardly thought of that, because he’d been dropping his walls unconsciously this whole time, in response to Harry and his complete lack of self-consciousness.
Draco watched the star anise pod bob around in his mulled wine, hearing only vaguely the way his mother cooed temperately over whatever box of jewelry she’d just opened. Considering there were five she’d already opened, and at least another two or three to go, Draco had to wonder how she mustered the enthusiasm for even that.
Narcissa had been involved with the man for over two years already. They had met, interestingly enough, through Aurelian Kemp, Vesper’s uncle, who had been married to Philippe’s sister Chloe. Friends from their days in Slytherin house together, the two men had stayed in touch throughout the years, even after Chloe had passed away from cancer. When Vesper and Aurelian had attended a birthday party for Draco at Malfoy Manor, they had brought Philippe along, and the French-born Slytherin had fallen hard and fast for Draco’s mother. Narcissa, for her part, was taken with his genteel manner and inherent warmth, and after only a few weeks came to love his quirky intellectualism as well.
Oh, how Harry wanted so desperately to believe that. But he couldn’t, not with his recent revelations. “I want that to be true, Draco,” he said. “But that’s not how it works. That’s not how life works. Life takes things from us. Life shatters us all the time.”
“But I don’t want to,” said Harry. “I like the way I am.” This was followed by more silence. “You don’t agree?” he asked with the arch of an eyebrow. “You think I should become a politician?”
That shut Draco up, but Harry immediately felt guilty for bringing it up. It wasn’t Draco’s fault he’d had a shitty childhood.
“The Malfoys have had a hidden estate in the Loire Valley for centuries,” the blond replied, his voice now a drawl that Harry found almost comfortingly familiar.
“I know they can. But this is how you like to have fun. And that’s great for you. But I don’t like this all that much. I’d rather stay in. I’d rather do things just the two of us. And I think, in the end, one of us would just get bored or frustrated.”
“You should take a look at Blaise and Vesper,” Draco said without preamble as he plopped down next to Harry. “They may as well be shagging.”
“Recently, yes. Mostly because he’s right in that Petunia can slip into some old habits about Harry’s… you know…”
And, of course, I have to mention my immense love and gratitude for all who have been following this regularly and leaving comments. Your last response meant so much to me!!
They stayed pressed together for a little while, Harry resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder. They didn’t speak, only breathed and sighed, and Draco found himself relishing how such a simple thing could feel so good.
“It was… difficult,” Draco said. “But many things at that time were difficult. And I’ve taken some comfort in knowing he died a hero, and that he got a proper sendoff.”
But only a few pages in she was interrupted by an owl tapping at her window, and as she looked up at it her heart sank. She recognized the gray eagle owl immediately.
“I appreciated that you came along with Lindsey to my parties, you know,” she said. “even though it wasn’t your scene. You always made a nice addition, and Theo especially enjoyed your conversations.” She met his eyes with a sudden, surprisingly melancholy expression, and Kyle couldn’t shake the uncanny feeling that he had unwittingly been drawn into a trap. “We both feel it would be a shame to lose the connection, just because Lindsey has left. We like you very much, and we would like to continue spending time with you.”
. It was proof, tangible, physical proof, that Draco loved him. Which he supposed was Draco’s point in giving it to him. But it was also so much
He’d come shouting Draco’s name to the ceiling, slept beside him in a blissful, post-coital haze, and then spent the entirety of the following morning in a state of semi-arousal as he remembered it: the pleasure, but also the look on Draco’s face as he swallowed Harry’s cum.
He was about to ask Angelina her thoughts when there was a knock at the door, and Clint Monarch opened it without any prompting.
, he reminded himself. Harry likely had something specific in mind that he wanted. But that was fine too. Whatever Harry wanted, Draco was happy to do it.
“True enough,” Harry conceded before taking the final sip of his drink. “What do you think? Stay for a bit, or are you ready to head home?”
“You are so full of shit, Harry Potter. I can’t wait for the day my uncle lets me kick your skinny ass all over the training floor.” She shoved him playfully, and he shoved her back.
“If you don’t come now, if you don’t talk to him now, then there probably won’t be another chance. This is it.”
Harry awoke the morning of Halloween with visions of Draco still lingering behind his eyes. Dreams about the Slytherin happened almost nightly, although surprisingly they had departed from the realm of the sexual for the most part. Instead Draco was simply always present, like a shadow, or a familiar, or a part of Harry himself.
“You’re still stuck on that, are you? The expectations of your parents that you’ll marry a pureblood woman? I thought you’d let go of that, after all your talk of being out from under your father’s thumb now you’re lord of the manor. You were quite giddy about it when we returned from the Christmas holidays. I suppose that was all talk, though, in the end.”
“I think your argument has a great deal of merit. And you’re not alone in your thinking. Moreau has been skeptical from the beginning, and her reasons are only getting stronger.”
“Doing all right,” Hermione said. “Dad still goes a bit wonky in the afternoons. Forgets he doesn’t live in Australia anymore. But Ron’s really wonderful with him, actually. Half past three rolls around and they have the same conversation, where Ron reminds him where he is and who we are and what happened, and then he remembers again. You would think it would drive Ron mental, answering the same questions over and over. But he’s quite patient.”
Hannah’s lips twitched in a smile before she went very still, her posture suddenly rigid. She tilted her head just so, then, and with her eyes in slits and her mouth twisted like she smelled something horrible, she really did look uncannily like their boss. Kyle heard Clint chuckle softly beside him.
people at all. But they thought I should be content to live the same life they lived, and I wasn’t. So I went off on my own. I shouldn’t have expected them to pay for any of my education, I suppose. But I did hope they would believe in me.”
He lifted Draco’s feet off him and made to stand, ignoring his boyfriend’s bleats of protest at being abandoned mid-massage. Harry opened the window, letting the large black and white owl in and accepting the small note that was tied to his leg.
But the letter could not be ignored. It lived in her already; she could feel it settling into the space between her ribs. She could feel it with every inhale and exhale of her breath.
He looked down at the parchment in his hand, wondering where to begin. He always came to the apothecary with a list; otherwise he was in danger of buying a bit of everything. His stores were quite low on Asphodel, thanks to McNeal’s research, so he decided to begin in the “plant roots” section and go from there.
This time, many more hands shot up, obviously wanting to prove that they weren’t complete dunces, as Ron seemed to think they were at the moment.
“Unlicensed and Experimental Magic,” he replied. “I think because of my cursebreaker background. I did have to deal with some experimental stuff in my old job.”
“It’s all right. Just think about it. And when you’ve decided, and when you’re ready, we’ll go, yeah?”
of it, though. I’m tired of having hang-ups. I know they won’t all go away overnight, I know I have to work on them. But I
“There are a few upsides,” Ron was saying now, bringing Vesper’s attention back to the present. “I’m home pretty much every night, nowadays. Sometimes I even get there before Hermione, which never used to happen.”
At least the Rosemary sweet-talking worked out. Early the following week, Kyle finally accepted the inevitable and went to talk to her about next month’s lab hours, since the project depended on getting enough of them. He wasn’t sure if it was putting Clint’s “foolproof” script to good use, or if it was the fact that Rosemary knew these hours were for Clint’s benefits as much as Kyle’s, but she was very reasonable about the whole thing. Kyle left her office intact and actually a little cheerful – rather than with a feeling he had been put through a meat grinder as usual – and he counted that as a win.
let him have whatever he wants. He’s done so much for the Corps already, so they owe him. But that stuff’s more based on politics than merit, and… I don’t know. It’s a lot of paperwork, and Ron never much liked paperwork.”
“Probably got caught up with a guest inside who wants to talk his ear off about something or other,” said Ginny. “There are a surprising number of Ministry workers here and they all think their work is
Harry nodded so vigorously his neck popped. Smiling, Draco took more into his mouth, getting about halfway down the shaft, appreciating the sounds of desperation being ripped from Harry’s throat.
“I’m making it up right now.” The Gryffindor chewed on his lip in thought for a moment. “All right, here’s how it works: I give you a blowjob…”
It was Malfoy’s turn to blink and stare. “Yes. That is exactly what we should do,” he said finally, his voice full of genuine surprise. Then he gave Harry a wicked grin. “Nice to know you’re not completely useless after all.”
Was Malfoy serious? Had he honestly forgotten that Harry only liked men? “It’s not that. It’s just… you know… she’s a
“Or everyone knows, and we’ve just been fooling ourselves.” He was watching Draco warily now. “Are you… does it bother you? That she knows?”
Harry leaned forwards, wondering what it was that was even harder to say than what had already been said. He didn’t prod, though. Malfoy’s face was twisting further, in pain, or embarrassment, or something else, and Harry felt his heart clench in sympathy. He waited.
The glamours had lasted over three hours, giving her all the time she needed. And it had been even easier to put them in place the following day.
“So I have pointed out to him, many times,” Draco said with a sigh. “But Blaise is a stubborn bastard.”
He knew why the Slytherins had employed this strategy, though. In many ways, the success of the game rested on Harry’s shoulders. The Slytherins had a seventy point margin against Gryffindor, meaning that if Harry caught the Snitch when Slytherin was over eighty points up, Gryffindor would still lose. The best thing Harry could do for his team was catch the Snitch early, before Slytherin had had too many chances to score.
Draco’s first instinct was to resist, but he didn’t even know why anymore. Perhaps Pansy was right. Perhaps he’d tried too hard to be independent and self-contained these past months, to the point where it was hurting his friends and even himself.
Draco muttered a cleansing spell and Harry felt that strange scrubbing sensation inside him that he was just starting to get used to. But this time he welcomed it, because it meant that Draco was about to focus some of his attention there.
“Exactly,” Ron said, pointing his fork in Ginny’s direction. “And like father, like son, I say. Arrogant, rotten Death Eaters, the both of them.”
When dinner was finished the two visitors quickly took their leave. Draco was due home that evening and Teddy was allowed to stay up and wait for him so long as he was bathed and ready for bed at the usual time. Teddy had agreed readily to that, obviously anxious to see his “other dad,” who had been working hard at the hospital recently so he could have Christmas off plus take a week for their honeymoon.
The tech merely grumbled and got to work, taking the vial with Mila’s sample out of the envelope and adding a few drops of a blue potion to it. He placed it on a rack to rest and process and returned his attention to the more complex test he had been running when Draco interrupted him.
Harry hummed, and Draco found himself smiling. No, he didn’t have any words, but he had this to give, and this, he thought, was enough. He rested his chin on Harry’s shoulder and they stood that way for long minutes, both staring out now into the overgrown garden that was dusted with the frost of winter and glinting as thin icicles refracted the afternoon light.
He’d been visiting and exploring it for years, since he was a boy. Sometimes it was with a rather reluctant Emilia in tow, but often it was on his own. With each new foray he’d widen the radius just a fraction, go in just a little deeper, and at this point he was familiar with all that was within bounds for students and a good portion of what was strictly out of bounds as well. The boundary line, as far as he could tell, was fairly arbitrary, though the professors and the other students did not treat it as such. They seemed to think it distinguished the safe from the dangerous, the realm of the human from the realm of… “other creatures.” Scorpius had never put much stock in this kind of segregation. He learned long ago that if he walked softly, if he showed respect to the inhabitants of the forest, and if he did not take things that didn’t belong to him, then he could walk freely in most places without fear of disturbance. He was mindful to always practice this etiquette, and by now he was an almost expected visitor in the forest, the creatures and plants having grown quite used to his presence.
“So that’s what you’re worried about?” she said, sounding suddenly relieved. “That you’re not good enough to be an Auror? Harry, that’s mental.”
And the desires he had to go find the Dursleys and rip out their throats with his bare hands, well… those feelings didn’t do him much good either.
“I was afraid I would say something stupid, even more stupid than what I had already said. I was afraid I would say something really damaging, even though I wouldn’t have meant it. I didn’t want to say something I couldn’t take back.”
“Uh-huh,” she said drily as she started limbering up. “If you say so. Me, I like the rules. They push you to your limits. They make you work for it.”
Draco sighed. “It most likely will not. A witch’s magical core creates a barrier around the uterus to protect the fetus from harmful magic during her pregnancy, and yours appears to have created one successfully. That barrier could fail, though that is very rare. As of right now, the baby is protected. I’m more concerned about you and how you will be affected. It's possible that not much will change, but it's also very possible for things to change drastically as the pregnancy progresses. You might find your magic even harder to control than it is now. Your body may have a hard time managing the changes, which could have some challenging, even painful, physical effects.”
Scorpius had to take a minute to understand the issue at hand. Emilia was always getting asked out by boys. Sometimes she said yes, a lot of times she didn’t, and these dates never seemed to amount to much. But Emilia, being dark, curvy, and very pretty, had been getting male attention since third year. It was hardly new.
The dishes were done and Harry dried his hands. Then he turned to Draco and wrapped arms around his waist.
The moment he entered the bathroom he realized he wasn’t alone. He could hear the sound of the shower at the far end of the room, feel the steam on his skin even through his cloak, and smell the pleasant tang of soap, subtle but undeniable.
Because that had been the goal, Draco was sure of it. Potter had intended for Draco to feel desired, sexy, wanted. The Gryffindor had hardly tried to hide his own interest or arousal; he hadn’t laughed arrogantly at the sounds Draco had made. If anything, he seemed to only get more turned on, more intoxicated, the more Draco reacted to him.
Draco opened his mouth so their tongues could collide, spurred on by Potter’s enthusiasm for him. One of his hands gripped into the softness of Potter’s jumper while the other roamed the solid muscles of Potter’s back. He groaned at the thought of how much he wanted to feel that skin for himself, and at the realization that he
Ron smiled. “An excellent point,” he said, and Vesper suppressed a pleased smile. “And one that leads to our next set of notes, in fact. Yes, sometimes you may receive pensieve memories that have been tampered with. There are many ways to try and alter a memory, but there are also signs that point to such a thing being done. Some are obvious, some more subtle. Write this down.” He waved his wand and a set of notes appeared on the chalk board behind him, detailing the ways to determine if a pensieve memory is genuine or if it has been tampered with. The trainees scrambled for ink and parchment and began scribbling notes furiously.
“All right,” said Harry. “Well, I’ll relay that to Draco. That, and the fact that Blaise should obviously make a move before you get snapped up by someone else, if he’s really and truly interested.”
“I’ll get it!” Draco proclaimed cheerfully, removing the hand from Harry’s pants and jumping up from the sofa.
McGonagall broke through the awkward silence by making her way over to Harry, cooing at Teddy resting on his hip.
“Thank you.” Hermione took another deep breath and she followed him into the house, which was laid out much like her parents’ own. Guensler led her to a sitting room to the right off the foyer and invited her to sit.
“We were never exclusive. Harry was very clear about that from the beginning. He doesn’t do monogamy.”
He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “I imagine that’s frustrating,” he said. If there was one thing he had learned in the past year and a half, it was to stay on the good side of the people that worked in the lab full time. They could really make things difficult for you, if they didn’t like you. “I’m sure you must be exhausted, given that you appear to be stuck here alone.” He looked around, confirming that. “Mortimer was in here earlier, though, wasn’t she? She was the one who told me she would have my results ready for me.”
Confused but curious, Hermione made her way into the kitchen. Everything looked normal until she came around the island and found that there was soup all over the floor and shards of a broken bowl scattered around.
“It wasn’t even really a date,” Harry went on. “I thought he just wanted to be friends, and I was going along with that. He was just spending the day with me to make me feel better. But then he kissed me, and-“
Robards’ mouth was twisted like he’d swallowed something vile, but he nodded. “I believe we understand each other.”
“Oh, you would love it. We can relax, eat delicious food, enjoy the countryside. We can go into Florence and see the sights too, if you like.”
Kyle felt his cheeks heat, thinking it was a bit extreme for them to “celebrate” just because he had finally shown up to a pub night for the first time in weeks.
She turned and he was there, even closer than she realized, looking down at her with a softness that was liquefying and unnerving all at once. He had removed his shoes, she could see as she glanced down, and had even undone a couple of the buttons of his shirt. It left a beautiful triangular wedge of earth-dark skin exposed to the air, and she bent her head to place her lips on it.
“Dessert, then,” said Harry. “Everyone wanted a chance to spend some time with you. I hope you don’t mind.”
Harry curled up to him, wanting to wrap them up together as usual. He knew that sleep would find him easily; he could already feel it coming on, though Draco hadn’t even doused the lamps yet.
“I forgive you,” he said. “I forgive you for all that you’ve done. I don’t want you in my life, but I do wish you well. Please know that.”
On the one hand, I couldn’t see how it was possible for me to be completely in love with Ron and have feelings for someone else at the same time. On the other hand, I also couldn’t see how I could justify ending things with Ron, who I knew I was in love with, for Blaise, who I could have fallen in love with but was not guaranteed to. It was when I stopped thinking in those terms and started thinking about who each of us were as people, and how I would fit with each of them, and what kind of person I was with each of them, that I started to find clarity about it.”
That night, he had simply wanted to avoid a fight, irony of ironies. That had been the goal. He agreed to go out with the group, have a few drinks, and be content to be ignored. Just stay quiet, that was all he had to do.
“I don’t love her, Draco. There was nothing sexual about the way I comforted her. It was the same way I would have comforted Hermione. Like comforting a sister.”
“This food really is lovely,” Draco told him as they finished up the last of the paella, licking their lips. “Good choice.”
“What made you decide you wanted to become an Auror after the war?” he asked out of the silence. He’d always wondered about that, about why, after spending all those years running from and fighting the Dark Lord, Potter would want to go and do it some more with other evil wizards. The idea seemed exhausting to him.
“They made you cook for them?” Draco had that tone in his voice he got when he was simultaneously amazed and incensed. Harry nodded. “And yet you still enjoy cooking, after all that?”
were coming to pub night this week, and I said I didn’t know. And then I asked you if you were coming to pub night, and you ignored me.”
Another cycle begins. We're starting with an update on Hermione this chapter. In the next couple of weeks we'll have a good chunk of Drarry before checking in with Vesper again :)
Perhaps it was the fact that Potter walked around Hogwarts like he owned the place. Draco remembered (with wistful fondness) Severus accusing Potter of the same thing when they were in school. But Draco had to admit that compared to now, the younger Potter hadn’t strutted very much at all. He’d actually been rather timid and reserved, at least in the early years. And then in the later years Draco remembered him being unreasonably angry and self-righteous. But he hadn’t done much strutting.
“Speaking your mind?” Kyle said, before clearing his throat when he realized his voice sounded a bit… rough.
She pushed against the carriage, bringing both herself and the still swinging legs of little Octavian closer. Draco fought the urge to take a step back. “It’s been a long time, and I thought it might be nice to talk.”
Draco nodded, then took a breath to ask the next difficult question. “Has it gotten worse in the past few weeks, that sort of reserved behavior? Or is it the same?”
“Yes, but she’s a little bit in love with you,” said Harry. “So she gives you a lot of leeway. Not that I blame her.” He gave Draco a wink and took another sip of his drink.
Harry slid closer to Draco, to find that they were now face to face. Draco kissed him, then let his lips travel down Harry’s neck and then back up again. “Now,” he said softly, once his mouth had reached Harry’s ear. “What are you going to do to show me how much you love me?”
“Pretty good?” Draco said incredulously. “They have Sabrina Warton. She’s the best Chaser in England.”
She immediately sprang into action, obviously wanting to make up for lost time. Draco continued his marking while she composed her brewing station and organized her notes.
“Yes, I know. It’s a bit hard to wrap your head around, and I have sympathy for that.” And Draco honestly did. From the outside it would seem sudden, to those who had no idea what had occurred in the past year. But to Draco, it was hardly sudden at all, and in his certainty he had very little interest in quibbling about it. “But might I remind you that it was you yourself that said I ought to find a partner worthy of me. And I cannot think of a person more worthy than Harry. And, before you protest…” he said, seeing his godfather open his mouth to interrupt, “know that I’m not talking about his role in the second war or his defeat of Voldemort. I’m talking about who he is as a person. Who he is with his friends, his godson, with
Hermione heard a shriek behind her and turned sharply to look. But it was only Vesper, having been attacked by a band of children that included Teddy, Victoire, and Esme as she ran barefoot about the room, calling “You’ll never catch me!” and laughing without restraint.
“I wasn’t thinking,” said Harry. “It makes sense that you would… I understand why you wouldn’t want to go out somewhere alone, when you’re not familiar with the place, or the people. Of course you’d want someone to have your back, to give you advice. That makes complete sense.”
No matter, he would just hole up in his room for the next few hours and work on homework. As a sixth year, there was
“I’ve got to agree with Ange,” said Rico. “What’s the point, anyway? I’d never get so upset over a girl.”
But he wasn’t going to dwell on that. He still had a whole life, a whole future he could build with someone else someday. And in the meantime, he could maintain his sanity by enjoying himself with men.
Hannah giggled again. “I’ll grant you that,” she said. “Though Quidditch leathers are actually pretty tight, you know, so there are benefits there as well.”
She opened her eyes to see that Declan was staring at her, his face a terrible mix of hurt and disbelief.
Blaise gave him a betrayed look as Draco smiled widely. “Excellent,” the blond said. “I’ve been telling him he needs to get it together and ask her out.”
The dragon on his desk was moving. He felt his stomach flip, as he always did when he received a message from Harry. But it wouldn’t do to answer the message now. He’d have to wait until McNeal had gone.
They emerged onto a narrow outcropping that looked out over the lake. They were not very high up, but one slip would land them in the water, which Scorpius knew from experience was still quite cold, even now into spring.
year days. This was the way they used to do things at the start of their relationship: heavy snogs, lots of teasing, and getting off with their clothes still on. Since Teddy had moved in there had been some sex, but it was mostly hands and mouths, hurried, paranoid that Teddy would come in and catch them.
That evening Draco sat him down on the red couch that Harry had cleaned, thoroughly, and stood before him with the instrument. He coaxed a beautiful melody out of the battered thing, and Harry marvelled at his skill. He rewarded the blond with a make-out session that ended up in the bedroom. He really didn’t want to clean the couch again.
. He cares about a lot of things. And he cares about me. He would never keep me from my work on purpose or keep me from doing what matters to me. He
“It’s not a birthday present,” the blond said quickly. “That’s…” He bit his lip. “I have a different present for your birthday.”
He stood, giving both Hugo and Noor a wave. Noor waved back distractedly, her eyes still half on her book, and Hugo responded simply by keeping that knowing grin plastered on his face. Scorpius rolled his eyes at him, then turned to go.
“Harry,” the stag said in Draco’s voice. “I’m going to grab a quick drink with Hannah and Pansy. I’m sorry it’s so last minute, but I’ll be home by ten, I promise. I love you. Say goodnight to Teddy for me.” And then it vanished.
“That would make it even bigger than the master, though. Do you think that’s odd, or does it not matter?”
Draco shrugged. “I don’t really know the man well, though he was quite civil to my family during the trials. But from what I heard he felt his place was with the Aurors. They invited him to run the department, and it seems he thought he was better suited to that than the Minister job.”
He glanced over towards the shower stalls as he prepared to take off his cloak when he recognized the blond head of one Draco Malfoy, and he paused in his movements, momentarily frozen.
“Oh, Gods,” said Kyle, laughing. He took a seat behind his desk and Pansy took the other chair. “This doesn’t bode well.”
“That’s right,” said Harry. “And this one is very special, because Draco was the one who gave it to me.”
He could hardly bring himself to mind, though, not with the way Harry looked on his knees, how clearly he was enjoying this. Harry knew pleasure, and he knew Draco; he understood both thoroughly.
Which made perfect sense, considering what he had let Harry do to him for the first time the night before. What he had
“It was hard to reconcile that knowledge of Petunia and Vernon, though,” she went on. “They were so kind to me, welcoming. I felt like part of the family immediately. Knowing that they’d done… all that, to a child…” She sighed. “But then Harry told me that I shouldn’t let that history cloud my relationship with them. He wanted me to be able to be close to my future in-laws. He didn’t want to drive a wedge between us.” She shook her head. “Can you believe that?”
“I’m not blaming you,” she said, misreading his silence. “I wouldn’t have expected you to tell me when you’ve hardly told anyone else. I’m only saying… well, it doesn’t matter.”
Harry turned back to Draco to find that the shocked expression had been replaced by one of pure wonder. Harry smiled and pressed his lips to Draco’s chastely. He was enjoying the fact that he had rendered Draco practically speechless. That alone was quite a feat. “Come on, then,” he said. “It won’t do to keep your mother waiting, will it?” He grabbed Narcissa’s gift from the table and put it into his pocket, then made for the door. He could hear Draco following behind him, and his smile widened.
“That’s not true,” Draco insisted to her. “I was just good at hiding it, because I’d been coping with it for a while. But you have no idea what toll my divorce took on me, how badly it messed me up. I was an absolute mess.”
“That’s ok,” Harry said quickly. “I just wasn’t sure… I’m not really… well, you know I’m not experienced-“
Draco rolled over onto his back, giving Harry a view of his flushed cheeks and glowing gray eyes. Harry continued to finger him, but leaned over Draco for a kiss.
Dursley nodded. “That’s the new Save the Date card. Mum thought I ought to hand-deliver it, as she never trusts the postman to be able to deliver here.”
“Oh.” He took the box from Draco and their fingers brushed, sending sparks all the way up Draco’s arms to the top of his spine. “Thank you. But my birthday’s not for another three days.”
Draco took another sip of wine. “I saw her this summer. We ran into each other in Diagon while I was out shopping.”
And when the series in the conservatory was done, they did it all over again in the ballroom, followed by the arboretum. By the end, Draco thought it was a true miracle that he hadn’t pulled his hair out. The only thing stopping him, really, was knowing he would face Pansy’s wrath if he so much as touched a single strand.
Harry sighed. Was that it? He wasn’t sure. “He’s a good teacher in many ways,” he countered. “I’ve learned a lot. He knows so much, and he has a good eye, and he’s good at explaining things. But it just isn’t… I just think a relationship between a mentor and a student has to be one of mutual respect. And I don’t feel any respect from him.”
“Of course.” Her smile turned grateful as he signed the document with a flourish. She handed him the redacted file. “These are photos of the victims.” she explained. “You’ll be able to see the wounds quite clearly.”
“Please, Sir!” he cried, knowing it would drive Draco wild. “Please let me come! Let me come around your cock like a good boy.”
Harry seemed to understand, and to trust Draco to know himself, because before the blond knew it there was a third finger seeking entrance. It slipped inside slowly, stretching him, making him feel so full it hurt a little.
She shrugged. “I think you might. And I certainly think he will like you. At the very least you could end up friends, and what would be the harm in that?”
“Well, if Uncle Ron said it, it must be true,” Draco replied with a sly look at Harry, who rolled his eyes.
“What would you like?” Draco said, turning to Kyle. “Nixie can get you whatever you want. Wine, whiskey, tea?”
“Hurts the relationship?” Draco echoed, not understanding. “I’ll grant you the former, but all relationships require
And, all the while, Kyle avoided dating. He actually found this incredibly fulfilling, which surprised him. Deepening friendships were what he had really needed all along, it turned out, and he had no desire to break his temporary celibacy just yet. He occasionally got chatted up at the Leaky or out and about in London, by wizards and Muggles alike, but he found he was so focused on learning to be single and happy that no one ever sparked his interest. He did, occasionally, slip into old narratives about missed chances and fear that he would end up alone, but he felt much more equipped to handle that than before. All he needed to do, he was learning, was mention his thoughts to Angelina or Hannah and they would give him a little pep talk and remind him of the things he was trying to do for himself. And it always worked.
“To replace the Compacta Gloria leaves. It has the same properties but remains stable when exposed to heat. That was the danger with the leaves, right?”

A tangled mix of emotions churned in his gut at the thought of the late Potions master, and he quickly drove it from his mind as he sat down between Ron and Susan Bones in Slughorn’s classroom. Most of the other students had already arrived. The two Ravenclaws, who always showed up early, sat poised and attentive at their respective cauldrons, while the four Slytherins occupied their own little corner of the classroom, well away from the others.
For another, Harry was positively beaming at him all morning, as the staff gathered in the teacher’s lounge to greet him before breakfast, and Longbottom was beaming right back. Harry had quickly pulled him into a full embrace upon seeing him, and the two men kept smiling at each other as they talked and chatted with the other teachers, occasionally patting each other on the back or clapping each other on the shoulder in a way that hinted at a long and deep-rooted intimacy.
Kyle felt his cheeks go red, immediately regretting opening his big mouth. But he was in it now, and he thought he knew what he was talking about. “Didn’t he design that really famous cathedral in Barcelona?”
“No,” Malfoy said. “They don’t have to abandon it. But magic is a part of their heritage, too, and they need to understand that just as thoroughly, even if they didn’t grow up in it. Pureblood ideology, in some ways, comes from a fear of being diluted, not in literal blood, but in tradition. There are distinctions between the Muggles and magic people in terms of the way they live their lives that must be preserved. The more Muggleborns enter the population, the more Muggle culture begins to seep into wizarding culture, and the lines blur.”
Draco didn’t know what he meant at first. But then he thought about the words and did as he was told. He felt the resistance his muscles were giving, and then he clenched them inward and-
Vesper glanced at Declan, who had just finished up a discussion with his own partner. “I’ll be right there. Just give me a minute.”
A stream of white cum splashed onto the tile walls of the shower and dripped slowly down as Malfoy wrung the last bit of pleasure from his orgasm and finally released himself, panting. He stayed there, under the spray, not really moving, letting his breath return to normal. Then he reached for the taps and the cascade of water waned into a trickle.
“Oh, don’t give me that shit,” Harry said, and Ron paused. “Don’t tell me you want to be an Auror just because I wanted to be one. That’s sure as hell no reason to go through all that training, to put your life at risk. It’s a tough job. One of the toughest. But you can do it, and you can certainly do it without me. If you want to be an Auror, bloody do it. Or don’t. I honestly don’t care, as long as you’re happy.” Ron turned back to him, blinking, and let that sink in. “That’s the point, Ron, don’t you see? We’re free. We did it. Voldemort’s dead, we survived, and we have our whole lives in front of us. I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to do, and neither do you. And I don’t want to be an Auror. I’m tired of making my life about being a hero, and hunting dark wizards, and risking my life. I’m bloody
I was so thrilled to get the response to the last chapter and how much you care about Draco :) This is a continuation of that plot line. It's short and sweet, but hopefully satisfying anyway.
“Incredible,” said Millicent. “An entire year gone by and she hasn’t yet figured out how to get along with Marianna. I had Greg’s mother wrapped around my little finger before we even tied the knot.”
It was a stark admission, one Harry’s mouth had drawn out of him. Harry hummed against the base of his shaft as he continued moving up and down, his expert tongue and lips taking Draco to new heights.
“Not at all,” Draco replied softly, coming further into the room to join Harry at the stove. He slid his arms around Harry’s waist, pressing Harry’s back to his front, and smiled when he heard the brunet give an appreciative hum. Harry was solid and warm, and Draco pressed closer to him, nuzzling into his neck, his hands exploring the hard muscles of Harry’s stomach and chest. He rested one of those hands over Harry’s heart for a moment, and the steady beat of it against his palm calmed him. Finally, he was home.
Draco and Harry both had a little bit of everything as they asked Teddy about what he did on the playground and the kids he had met. When they’d exhausted that topic, Teddy asked Draco about his parents, wondering why he had never met them if Narcissa and Andromeda were sisters.
There were closer sounds, too. The ticking of a clock, and the deep, even rhythm of someone breathing.
“Never mind.” He leaned in for another kiss, and Draco obliged. “I’m well done with the study for the day, and I want to give it a few hours before I talk to Kreacher. So, do you want to play chess or something before I start dinner?”
Harry grinned widely, looking both pleased and surprised. “Neville went to visit her? I had no idea. Well,
Draco started and looked up from his desk. Raisie McNeal was standing in the doorway of his classroom, watching him with a timid curiosity.
“Madam Lorenz brought a group from the orphanage for their pre-Hogwarts check-ups, and this came up in one of the exams.”
“Yeah, this party was a lot bigger than I expected,” said Harry. “And not really what I imagined a one-year-old’s party to be.” He glanced over at the group of small children kicking around a football and riding on toy brooms, the only indication that this was a child’s party at all. The rest of the guests were all grown, milling about with drinks in their hands, talking and laughing.
There was silence for a minute or two, in which Pansy looked actually rather distressed that she had upset him. He reached across the table and put a hand on hers.
This is basically a self-indulgent character study. There is a sprinkling of angst for plot purposes, but mostly I saw it as my chance to get to know Scorpius and explore his world a little bit. And I love thinking and writing about relationships, so of course I had to delve into the other people in Scorp's life as well. It may not have enough plot to be your cup of tea, but if you like this AU I've created and want to find out what is going on for many of the characters fifteen(ish) years after the epilogue, then this may very well be the story for you!
“Shacklebolt’s replied?” Draco asked him as Harry seated himself again, already undoing the seal and opening the letter.
“That’s part of it, yes,” Draco said. “And I do the sort of things that a parent would do for you. Like what Toby’s mum and dad do for him.”
She narrowed her eyes at him. “If you even try, I will destroy you in the press. Gloves off, no holds barred. You think since the public loves you now that you’re safe from them. But there’s nothing they love more than watching a celebrity crash and burn. Trust me, I make my living off of it.”
“I don’t,” said Blaise. “That doesn’t mean I don’t notice. But I’m not even talking about looks. I’m talking about…” He sighed. “Do you know what I liked so much about Hermione, besides her obvious intellect and work ethic?”
“I’m not even sure why I went today. I guess because Dudley asked me, and I did believe it would help to have me there for a little while. But I also think I went for myself. I guess I thought maybe when I saw him I could find some way to forgive him. Or at least get closure, something. But I don’t feel any closure. I just feel… sad, and I don’t even know
Harry was doing the maths in his head, realizing that Kemp had left England around the same time that Voldemort had regained his power.
The biggest issue was that she couldn’t find magic that quite matched his description. As she methodically explored each category of magic, she always found one or two common elements but nothing that incorporated
Harry smiled. “Draco’s coming to mine for the week. I have a house that I’m almost done renovating. We’ll go to my godson’s birthday party on Thursday, but other than that, I think we’re just going to stay in and relax.”
“Oh,” Harry said, forgetting he had never really told his Muggle friends this story. “They’re… dead, unfortunately. They both died in a… in an accident, when Teddy was only a few weeks old. So he is being raised by his grandmother, with my help.”
Gerald thanked Kemp and moved off the floor, and Kemp immediately turned to Harry. “Now, Potter, show me what you’ve got. I hope you’ve been working on those jinxes we were going over last week.”
“The whole wedding sounds like a real rush job,” Hermione commented to Ron. Hugs and goodbyes had already been exchanged with Harry and Teddy, and the couple was alone. They were doing the dishes together, Ron washing while Hermione dried. “I understand why they wouldn’t want to wait, but it seems more stressful than it’s worth.”
“He threw something fragile… a figurine perhaps? Porcelain or glass or something. I was small, maybe only six or seven, and I remember ducking my head and throwing up my arms, but then… nothing hit me. I opened my eyes and there was the figurine, in a bunch of pieces on the floor. Like it had shattered without hitting me. I didn’t think much about it at the time. I remember my aunt and uncle both being furious and making me clean it up. They blamed me for breaking it. So maybe it
It didn’t. A few months in, Draco knew something had to be done. Malfoys did not dwell on unpleasant things. Malfoys did not wallow in self-pity. And so Draco went looking for something to distract, to get him out of his house and his memories and the void his wife had left in her wake.
He hadn’t felt like that since his years back at Ilvermorny, with his small but loyal group of friends there. It was nice to feel that again.
“What shall we do?” he wondered aloud, knowing full well his cat wouldn’t have the answer. “Collect a few samples, or tell Neville where to find them?” They were very valuable, the blossoms, due to their rarity and their usefulness in various potions. Neville would certainly want to cultivate some, and Dad-Draco would be very interested in them as well. The only issue was that they were well out of bounds, and to give either professor their location would be outright admitting that he was breaking the rules.
The house-elf appeared with a pop and Harry stared at Draco, not wanting to consider where he was going.
As Harry took in their garden, and their children as they played in it, he slipped an arm around Draco's waist. They were a family. Not perfect, and not the one he imagined having as he tried to imagine his future after Voldemort, when he attempted to convince himself that he would have one. However, it was the family that made his heart expand, with the man that made it beat faster, and he wouldn't have changed it for anything. He knew that the ring in his pocket was going a bit fast, but he was sure that it would be accepted. When he looked into the blue-gray eyes of his partner, he saw his own emotions reflected in them, and knew that they both wanted their relationship to last as long as they both shall live.
In the evening, once everyone under ten was in bed, Harry and the Malfoys filled Hermione in on their plan of action. She gave her own input and some more strategising ensued. However, soon everyone was dropping off, only Harry and Draco were left awake in the house.
“I don’t see a point in staying married,” the blond explained. “Besides, I’d feel weird, carrying this around, while I was with you,” Draco said, pulling down his wedding ring. He placed it in Harry’s palm, who just stared at it. “It never meant much to me. It was just a way to produce a legitimate heir. I do have that. I just didn’t get a divorce earlier, because it didn’t seem important.”
"If I kiss you again, I may not be able to stop. As much as you enjoy it, Harry, I'm not sure if you want to do more." He let his hand drop into his lap, but his eyes didn't leave Harry's.
"Like you're going to find someone as pretty as me!" Draco said rather arrogantly, but even Harry couldn't deny that it was the truth.
"Not so fast," Malfoy said, holding up a perfectly manicured hand which was impossibly dainty, particularly since it belonged to a man. Harry wondered why he just couldn't barge in and take care of everything, then he realised that politics was a positively Slytherin territory, therefore dealing with it as a Gryffindor would probably not be productive.
Harry sighed. He really didn't want to fight. He was tired of it. He just wanted to be happy. He took up her place next to the fireplace, gazing into the flames deep in thought.
He just held his friend, knowing that she had to have a good cry about it,  then she would square her shoulders and be ready to fight. He knew that it  would probably be easier for her to just give up and return to Ron, but she  didn't even mention it. From that he knew that everything would be all  right. If she was not happy with her husband, no one should force her to  remain with him. She would eventually win, she always did.
"How about I have lunch with Arthur and discuss it with him? I could owl him right now," Harry suggested.
“I didn’t need to. We were kids ourselves, Harry. But now I am a man, a husband, the head of a household. As a Light Wizard it is my duty to protect and provide for those in my care. A wife’s duty is to serve her husband, provide a good home for him and the children, and to produce as many heirs as the husband wants. Her needs should only come after all of that. My family lives by this creed. None of my brothers’ wives are working, for the same reason. For Herm to suggest that is abnormal,” he rambled on, not aware of Harry’s discomfort at what he was hearing. “She’s being selfish. But she’ll wise up once I put her out on the street and then come begging me to take her back.”
"Yes. It would be highly inconvenient to take glasses from trays that are scurrying about your ankles."
Harry looked into Draco's eyes. They were full of some soft emotion, and then it hit him. It was the same look he saw in the memory that Bill and Fleur shared. He was momentarily startled by the discovery. Draco loved him. Perhaps he knew it, perhaps not, but the emotion was there. He wasn't sure what to do with the information. He was afraid that the previous evening he had toyed with those emotions and hurt Draco. The blond has done so much for him. He was confused as to how to go on. He wanted to experiment further, but if it hurt the other man, he wouldn't forgive himself.
Draco was as busy as ever when the holiday season arrived, as his band was invited to many holiday parties. So much so, he kind of forgot when Christmas rolled around. Harry was busy with writing holiday edition content for the paper. Luckily, he interviewed a man who sold Christmas trees, and the generous man offered a beautiful one for free once he heard about the two boys having run away together. He thought it was very romantic.
"I can assure you, that it was not the case. Ginny just wanted to see the world as she couldn't before and since my job kept me here, I volunteered to take care of the children while she was away."
Phase three went into action the next morning. Harry was having his usual breakfast and Ginny was still glaring at the plate. The kids were there as well, but they were a lot happier about their diet than they had been on the first few occasions.
So the time came for it for Draco, but though Harry's first instinct was to accept readily, he stopped to consider it for a moment.
"What?! I don't feel nauseous," he protested, giving up sugar and flour just sounded awful. "I don't want to diet!"
"That's so fascinating, Harry. I can't believe I never looked this up!" She was clearly miffed about Harry being more knowledgeable than her on a subject.
He couldn’t understand Ron’s attitude. Yes, he had always been quick-tempered and fast to fly off the handle, but underneath it all he had the rational mind of a chess player. When had he become the irrational, judgemental person that had just left? Harry tried to think the sudden personality change through, but as he was about to wrap his mind around it, he felt a strange calm come over him. His heart slowed down and his mind, which had been in turmoil settled to an ease. In a moment, all his worries were gone. His heart remained a bit heavy though and even the pleasant feelings he was experiencing could not chase away the sense that Ron was no longer his friend.
"Harry, we came down together, you sat next to me all the time, and she couldn't have missed the way you were ogling me in the pool."
"Well, I can't let my children be in the same house as that whore. I'm  taking them with me to Mother," she stated a bit too calmly and went back  upstairs, probably to get the kids.
"Yes. He's conversing with Draco now. He is going to start working based on the new law tomorrow. Now we can proceed to the divorce court. He's very hopeful that I'll get Rose and Hugo and even some money. Lucius said that I can bring them here and live in the Manor until I get myself sorted." Hermione sighed.
Harry was excited that Draco was planning family vacations together as well. Perhaps it was a bit fast-paced, but once he opened himself up to the blond, he just wanted to be with him every moment of the day. As if it was what he had been waiting for all this time, and the feeling appeared to be returned. He locked eyes with the man before him, and all he saw was happiness.
As they sat there, Harry could feel their connection. These were the eyes that he had looked into so many times, looking for a plot, a ploy, his own demise. He knew the man before him so well, but then again, so little. The Draco he had come to learn about in the past months was not the boy from school. He wondered if that boy ever truly existed, or his own prejudices encouraged by Ron, had clouded his vision. Then again, they had both changed. They grew up, became fathers. The world changed too. Harry smiled at Draco and the other man let go of his wrist. The touch was immediately missed. Yes, their relationship was not only about scheming. He had come to see his friend.
The children were located in Scorpius' rooms, as he had a whole suite for himself. Harry had never been inside and when he entered the playroom, he thought that it was exactly the kind of room he had dreamt about in his cupboard under the stairs. All sorts of toys were located on shelves around the room from toy brooms to building blocks. Among them were also so many books; it was a miniature library. The room had a swing in the middle, on which Lily was swaying back and forth, carefully pushed by Narcissa. The woman had a smile of delight on her face. James was on a trampoline. He was trying to jump as high as he could go, but safety charms prevented him from reaching great heights and also from falling off of it. Scorpius and Albus were thick as thieves on a rug, Nocer Picard books around them, clearly in an argument over something in one of them. Hermione was also with them, and she was pointing out a passage, trying to explain to the others something. Lucius sat in a rocking chair at the back, his full attention on James.
"Of course they were!" she cried in indignation. "Everyone at school talked about it all the time. They had the perfect partnership. I just can't understand why they never got married."
The ninth of January couldn't roll around fast enough for Harry. He didn't have a spare minute to sneak away to see his friends and Ginny was being especially demanding. Harry hoped that his wife got the urge to travel again soon. Then he chided himself for thinking like that. Ginny was his wife, but things weren't the same as they had been before she decided to take on the world. However, deep down, he knew that he wasn't ready to face just what that meant, and therefore, refused to go there in his thoughts. Thus, his days seemed to consist of at least 36 hours, and he was getting very restless.
"That's only because it's old. I got it when I was playing for the Harpies. Harry, I promise I won't take the kids up." She was trying to be persuasive but failing.
"Finally, this is Scorpius Malfoy. He is looking forward to playing with you all," he said finally, as he reached the end of the line.
"Piazza Navona," Draco said, as they stepped onto the pavement. "It's shaped like a horse racing ring, because that's what it used to be. It has three beautiful fountains on it, the most well known is the Fountain of the Four Rivers, designed by my favourite sculptor, Bernini."
They stood kissing for some time, just enjoying each other. Draco took first turn in the bathroom, since he took longer anyway. While he was there, Harry tried to figure the camera out. He was getting nowhere with it, until one of the maids looked in on him. She was more familiar with the gadget, and could show him how to use it much more easily than the manual did. She promised to also help with the computer the following day. Draco was surprised when he entered in the nude, and Harry snapped a picture of him.
thought of. What happened when he learned a detail of Healing history that pertained to a friend? The community of wizarding Britain was in fact not a very large one, and basically everyone he knew would come to St. Mungo’s if they required treatment, which meant that Draco was constantly learning things about his friends that he couldn’t share with other people, things he didn’t really want to know himself.
“I just thought that kissing him would be like… gathering data.” She cringed. “Gods, that’s really awful, isn't it? I wasn’t that cold or indifferent at the time. It’s just that… I had to
“I bought it for you,” Harry said, swallowing. “It was for you all along. Just… just take it. Please.”
Draco reminded himself. It was what they had agreed to. In fact, it was for the best, really. Things had gotten a bit intense between them. This holiday would help create some distance, and that was a good thing.
“Maybe, but you can head yourself off at the pass,” countered Paul. “You can get out before it gets serious. Those blokes you just listed chose not to and ended up falling hard for Harry because they convinced themselves they were somehow special even when they knew deep down they weren’t. That’s on them, not Harry.”
More guests started pouring in, and Hermione had a hard time keeping track of them all. She did at least have a chance to say hello to Percy and a very pregnant Audrey when they came through the door, as well as to Blaise, Pansy, and Theo, who all arrived together. They’d even brought Esmerelda with them, who was pretty as a picture in her blue dress, with dark hair and a solemn little expression, much like her mother, though she had her father’s bronze-hazel eyes.
“Well, doesn’t everybody?” Draco smirked at Harry, and Harry rolled his eyes. “He looks quite good blond.”
"When it suits you," Harry said. "You do everything you already know how to do, when it suits you. But the moment it's a little bit confusing, or unfamiliar, or, Merlin forbid, as
She was quite still, sitting in a chair against the wall, blinking slowly. Her mouth, almost always tilted upward in a warm smile, sagged with disuse, and her normally bright cheeks were pallid and limp, like they had been deflated.
Draco nodded slowly. Right. He could see how that would be difficult. What did Harry have to say to his uncle, at this point?
Potter chewed on his bottom lip, his green eyes glinting behind those delicate spectacles. “I don’t have…
“I’m not concerned that you won’t be successful here,” she went on. “I know that you are, that you will continue to be. But I do wonder…” She sighed. “I cannot speak for anyone else, but it is difficult for me to be here, some days. Everything is still so fresh. Even though we’ve rebuilt Hogwarts, and it looks even better than it did before, the memories are there, as are the ghosts of the people we’ve lost, both figurative and literal.”
Harry froze. He hadn’t realized that. Of course, that was because Draco hadn’t told him. Harry had just assumed, based on the way Draco had seemed experienced on all other matters with gay sex, that he would be experienced with this also.
Draco scooted closer, lifting Harry’s legs to wrap around him. Draco leaned down so he was on his elbows, hovering above Harry by only a couple of inches. His mouth closed the distance and he kissed Harry tenderly. Harry’s chest constricted almost painfully as he kissed Draco back, his tongue flitting out to taste him. It was such a simple, gentle thing, but for some reason, it had a stronger effect than anything else had that night, and Harry almost felt like weeping.
The two departments had been encouraged to convene after the presentation was finished, in order to develop a plan action to begin the assignment Robards had just handed them. But everyone seemed to have a different opinion on the approach, not to mention a need to complain a bit about the impossibility of the task in the first place, now that Robards was no longer listening in.
Eventually both Babbling and Gibbs called it a night, leaving the younger staff members to enjoy the waning evening. To Draco’s surprise, Longbottom then situated himself next to Draco and asked him what he thought about the latest research on venomous tentacula. Draco, who’d just read an article about it in
The only thing that made it better was going to visit Ron, Hermione, and (especially) Rose. They were patient with him; they didn’t force him to talk, but they always listened when he did. Their little cottage was a safe place, and holding a tiny human in his arms helped give him some perspective.
Draco looked at him. “I don’t need you to do anything. I just told you because I thought you ought to know.”
When he went down to the Great Hall for breakfast that morning Potter was already there, sitting next to Vector and across from Francesca. Draco vacillated about what to do. It would be bad form to try and avoid Potter after what had happened; it just didn’t feel right. On the other hand, he wasn’t entirely ready to seek the other man out in any obvious way. He was still figuring out
He thought he caught a small smirk from Parkinson, and wondered what that meant. However, it was Zabini who answered.
“I… well…” He hadn’t been expecting this. It was true that it went against their original agreement, technically. Though Harry also made a good point. If they knew they weren’t going to run into any mutual acquaintances, if Harry was just going to be thought of as a normal fellow Muggle and Draco the same by everyone present, then what was the harm?
Harry sighed. “You know full well you’re antagonizing your sister and making it worse, Lils,” he said. “Maybe you should go in your room for a bit. I think you have some maths homework you have to finish up, don’t you?”
Harry smiled to himself as he remembered, but then made himself focus, as the Patronus was now speaking in Draco’s voice.
When said mousy-haired bloke had to excuse himself to answer a device beeping in his pocket which he referred to as his “mobile,” Draco found himself alone and looked about the room, wondering where Harry had got to. He didn’t spot him right away, though, and wondered if he had stepped out to the balcony for some fresh air. No matter. Draco would top off his glass of wine and join him there.
As she went through the routine of drying her hair, picking out her outfit, and putting on a touch of makeup, visions of her relationship with Blaise continued to course through her, blending together but still punctuated with brief little snapshots in which she remembered just about every detail: seeking out Blaise’s face in the audience after her first major victory in the British National Dueling Competition, taking him to the movies for the first time, cooking with him in his kitchen while they listened to Frank Sinatra and drank marsala wine right out of the bottle, salsa dancing at a Muggle club until sweat dripped down their backs and their feet ached, and the first time they slept together. That night also happened to be the first time she’d truly made him laugh. Not just a soft chuckle or a single, dry bark, but a real laugh, rolling and delighted that came all the way from his gut. She’d never heard a more enchanting sound in her life, and only half an hour later had invited him into her bed.
This particular story involved him getting into his father’s pantry of potion ingredients and trying to brew a potion that would make him able to fly without a broom. No such potion existed, so where Draco had gotten the idea in the first place was beyond him. But he’d ruined one of his father’s best cauldrons in the attempt. He was seven at the time.
"My mother always taught me that if you ask for something from someone, you always have to make sure to get on their good side first. He spoke in his letter about my appearance and I'm just afraid that if he doesn't see me make an effort, then he'll just turn around and Floo right back. I'm also worried about what he'll want in return for his help."
Harry just nodded and cast about for something to say. Hermione laughed again, though rather loudly and the redhead glared daggers in her direction. Harry was saved from further conversation by the arrival of their main course. It was a large piece of salmon under a glass dome sitting on top of something that looked like rice. The colours were strange again, as the fish was magenta and what was under it was bright lemon. As they took the domes off, the air around them filled with the scent of saffron. As he took a bite out of the food before him, Harry was transported to a warm and cosy place. The garnish turned out to be some sort of pastry, but had a nutty flavour. As they put down their forks, finished with the meal, both seemed to be in a better mood.
“So, apparently you also got a new gig from it,” Harry said, sitting down on the bed, getting ready to undress.
The following day passed quickly. The Wizengamot had a short session, and afterwards Harry expected to return home with Draco, but the blond had other plans. Therefore, Harry enjoyed a nice afternoon at the Manor, first with Hermione, then the children joined them. In the evening, Draco arrived home with a large grin on his face, and asked Harry to join him in his study. He sat the other wizard down on his usual place on the sofa. Harry had very fond memories of the sofa, since they kissed on it the first time.
When they did finally reach the entrance, they had to stand in a line. It didn't look very long, and was actually going rather fast. Harry stepped out to take some more pictures. He was enjoying photography a lot. At least from behind the camera he wasn't the subject.
Harry returned the kiss, spurred on by what they were going to do. The thought excited him beyond measure, but also frightened him a little. However, he trusted Draco's experience to lead him.
He arrived to the Floo office in Patong, Thailand. The room where his seat jumped out of the Floo, after about half an hour of dizzying ride, was hot but not very humid. Coming from the cold winter it was a shock to his system, even though he had prepared by dressing in tropical clothing. He just had a loose shirt, shorts, and sandals on. His luggage was in his pocket, the big trunk shrunk down as much as he could manage.
"I'll be right down!" he shouted back. It was time for his phase two. He stilled his heart, that hammered from nerves, for what he needed to do.
Still, he was glad when six o’clock rolled around and he could bid goodbye. He hurried to Floo to the school and pick up the boys, and then they went on to gather Lily. She took his mind off of Ron for a while as she told her father everything of a story about a brave man saving a dragon only to be rescued later on by the aforementioned dragon, which she heard that day at pre-school. Even the boys seemed to be interested as they stayed to listen to the end even when they arrived to their living room.
"Oh, well, it was for my benefit as well. Besides, talking to her is great fun now that I don't have to compete with her."
"Yes. I have studied the positions of both sides on key issues and discovered that I agreed with the viewpoint of the Dark families. Therefore, I decided to join them." He gave the answer that they had discussed in preparation. They didn't expect to have to give them so soon, but they didn't rule the possibility out.
"That's the San Teodoro Church," Draco spoke up as the taxi pulled away. "It's one of the oldest churches in Rome. It had been renovated not long ago. Pretty place. We can have a look tomorrow when we go sightseeing. If you look up at those trees," he pointed above the build in front of them, "that's the Palatinus. It has some of the oldest ruins in Rome. We'll need a full day for it. The Colosseum is just on the other side. I have so much to show you, these few days probably won't be enough."
Harry realised that the boy in front of him was probably Malfoy's son. He looked so much like his father with his large grey eyes and white blond hair that he was mentally thrown back into the robe shop where he and Draco had first met. Although obviously, the boy was a lot younger than Draco had been back then. He estimated him to be about Albus' age.
"Yes, well, the lighter trousers make you look taller and leaner. The blue complements your hair well. You should wear more colours, Harry."
"I can assure you Albus is Harry's," came Ginny's voice as she stepped out from among the paperbacks. In her hand, she held a book with the title
It had been some days since Harry had become a Dark Wizard. The Weasleys had not spoken to him since, which Harry had expected, but it still hurt. He wanted to pretend that it wasn't so, but in the evenings he would look at old photo albums and reminisce. The sweetest memories were the ones not found among the moving photographs - the first time he entered the Burrow, the first time he felt home, there were no pictures taken then. That first morning sitting down at a family table that actually welcomed him - was it even real? Could they truly discard him so easily? He just couldn't believe it. He hoped that some day they would look past his alliances and take him back. Draco had promised him that he would not be alone, but in the evening, in his sitting room with the kids upstairs in bed, he felt abandoned.
Harry saw that the news surprised Draco. Albus was rather remarkable, and Harry knew he had a little genius on his hands. He sometimes worried that he could not cultivate said genius well enough -as while he wasn't stupid, he still used his intellect for practical things. Al, on the other hand, would probably become a great Potions master one day to rival the likes of Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore. It was quite fascinating how the boy got his name from the two men he was probably destined to suppress.
After he finished reciting the oath, the Scribe stepped behind him and helped him take off his green outer robe to reveal a black shirt and black trousers underneath. Then he helped Harry put on the official plum coloured robes of his new station. The Chief Warlock left his seat to stand before him and pinned the silver W onto his breast.
"Oh, I just wanted to see what you were made of, young man, without Mr. Weasley. You want to enter politics and that is a big step. I know you are a very reliable man." He fixed his gaze on Harry. "However, politics is a lot more complicated than the wand-waving you've been doing."
Harry grinned as he read the letter. He had been afraid as to what Teddy would say. He spent so much time playing with the Weasleys as a child, Harry feared that he would see them more as a family than him. Without even bothering to put on clothes, he went to the desk in the small drawing room to compose a long letter.
Practically everyone was outside and as he sipped his hot drink, he observed the extended Weasley family. If everything went according to plan, this would be the last time his children got to play with most of their cousins. He was sad for them, but he hoped that in school they would still meet, or that the rift that his decision was going to cause would heal over time. He wondered if it was worth it. The people outside had been through so much with him over the years. They lived through a war together, shared their losses. His heart clenched at the memory of the dead, and for a moment, he doubted that he could actually go through with the plan. Then he remembered all that Draco had said about what the Light Families were doing, of Hermione, of all the reasons why he started on the path in the first place. Still, he knew that the Weasleys were his family, and they would leave a hole in his life that he doubted anyone could fill. He was going to lose his family again, but at least he would not be left alone. It still hurt, but Hermione's absence hurt as well. It should have hurt the Weasleys too, but it didn't appear to. They seemed to dismiss her, close their doors in front of her and not care anymore. That didn't feel right to him and he considered that perhaps to all those people she once called family she didn't matter as much as they let her to believe. Were they the same with him? Only time would tell. With a sigh, he let it all drift away from him in the wind and made peace with the situation. He was ready to face whatever came his way.
"There used to be a lot more Malfoys. They have a tapestry room just like the Blacks but in a better condition. I studied it a bit and had Lucius tell me about the family history. He doesn't have a lot to do, so we talk sometimes. It's strange how many mutual interests we have." Her voice trailed off and Harry wondered about how strange that statement would have sounded a year before. "He's great at story-telling. He explained that there were times when 20 or even more people would live in the Manor. I think he sometimes wishes the family were that big again."
"No. I'm going to train to become a healer," Hermione said with a smile. "It'll take some time and I'll have to rely on the Malfoys for a bit longer, but they make me feel at home. At first I thought I was imposing, but they seem to enjoy having more people in the house."
The waiter came by with some menus, and they were in Italian as well. Harry was a bit frustrated, and could understand the couple that had left.
The following day after breakfast Harry, Draco and Hermione went into one of the smaller drawing rooms, and she was told about their relationship. She was very happy for them, and confirmed their suspicion that she had seen the signs the day before. Afterwards, she retreated to the library to leave the men alone until the children arrive. They wasted no time in returning to what was quickly becoming their rooms.
A few days later Harry found himself in Malfoy Manor once more. Hermione, Draco, and him were sitting in Draco's study. Harry looked around, observing the many pictures of Scorpius. He had pictures of his children all over the house as well, along with Ginny. Though the more recent pictures were just of the kids.
Harry and Draco didn't use magical transportation to reach Rome. They used a Muggle aeroplane, to Harry's surprise. Draco told him to leave all the organising to him, so when he was presented with an aeroplane ticket, and asked if he had a passport, he was gobsmacked. Luckily, he did own a passport.
I know I said of the previous chapter that it was a big one, but this is a major turning point. You'll see ... (snicker). This chapter had to be cut towards the end on fanfiction net, because they are enforcing their M limits again. Frankly, I always thought that much is okay on an M, but since it says anything explicit...
Like in most of them, the place was packed. Almost naked bodies gyrated to loud techno music, neon lights flashed, illuminating them and revealing that some of them were making out, or practically having sex standing up. Harry was amazed by what he was seeing. His wife loved Patong as she went there a lot. He couldn't understand it as he didn't imagine her loving the party atmosphere, which the city seemed to be all about.
Harry guessed that there was something unpleasant in the rag and scoffed at it before finally locating the first page among the bits of paper. There was an unflattering picture of Ron right under the headline: "Weasley Goes Insane". It depicted him trying to attack Malfoy the previous night. Harry read the article and saw that it did not only describe Ron's actions as unsound, but his choice of attire as well. Harry tried not to laugh aloud at how true that happened to be. He did have to think about an appropriate way to handle the article that would be along the lines of his actions so far. Therefore, as he got up and put on a robe to go down for lunch, he put a scowl on his face.
"I'm finished with my studies, Dad. I wondered if we could go flying." He was rather shy about his inquiry, probably due to seeing that his father had guests.
Although the blond did flinch at what she said, she only had to look at him to know that he knew a lot about being inbred. "If people in a closed community intermarry too often, like cousins with cousins, then there's a good chance of them producing unhealthy offspring. Unfortunately, even the wizards and witches who appear healthy often have problems with having children themselves."
"Why? Why did you want to be my friend so badly? Because I was famous?" He opened his eyes to stare straight into the blond's grey orbs.
Draco appeared! Finally! I know, slow progress. Though we can't expect Harry  to wake up one day and just say "oh, I'm gay", now can we?
Once they finally emerged from their room, fully clothed, they were greeted by their children in the garden. Hermione and her children were scheduled to make an appearance at around lunch time. The three of them had moved out a few months after the divorce, to the place where they lived before, and Ron had moved out. Once the red-head calmed down, he became a bit more reasonable. He still ignored Harry and Draco being a couple, but the public didn't.
Scorpius was a delightful boy. Cute and approachable, still smart and obviously intelligent, Harry was sure that he would get along with Albus famously. He wasn't so sure about James though. Sadly, his oldest seemed to like rough games, which he was trying to discourage, but Ron, as his uncle, was all the more keen to encourage the behaviour. Harry feared that since his relationship with Ron was only going to get worse, his eldest would suffer the most. He would not take well to the environment in Malfoy Manor, Harry was sure of it. Still, if he managed to support the gentler side of his son, perhaps he would calm down a bit. Not that there was anything wrong with boys being boys, but James sometimes seemed to try to ignite fear in the hearts of his younger siblings and his playmates. Harry wondered what would happen once Scorpius and James met. He was bound to see soon enough.
“I was scared. You’re so smart and so beautiful, you were going to become someone important, and soon you would realise I wasn’t good enough for you,” Ron admitted. “Mum said that I wouldn’t be able to hold onto you if I let you live on your own. She was probably right.”
When the arms of the chair opened, he fell forwards, his head still swimming from the combination of the trip and temperature change. He sprawled out on a light-green tiled floor and lost all of his remaining breakfast. At that moment, he sincerely wished he hadn't eaten those eggs. Just as he was done, someone Vanished his puddle with an amused chuckle. He looked up from his position on the floor to find a short, middle-aged, and dark-skinned Thai wizard standing near him with a big grin. Harry frowned and slowly gathered himself up. He supposed it was a regular occurrence that guests arrived in such a state.
"So you need to kick Hermione out and get your wife and kids back here. Then, you need to publicly renounce her and tell everyone that you want her back in her proper place," he finished.
Lucius got back on his horse and held an arm down for the younger man. Harry wasn't sure how to mount a horse, so Lucius instructed him to put his foot into the stirrup and hoist himself behind the blond with his help. He placed his arm around the slim hips of Lucius Malfoy and held on as the horse went into a gallop. At first, Harry was scared of the speed and being jostled about, but he soon started to enjoy himself even though he got a face full of silky blond strands.
"You don't mind us moving here? I should have asked for your permission first." Harry hung his head.
Harry laughed, and let himself be dragged to a nearby restaurant. Draco pouted a bit at it being too cold to sit outside, but was assured that it wouldn't be their last trip to the ancient city.
"Well, the walk is a lot more pleasant now," Harry concluded as they just reached a pair of beautiful French doors and through them arrived to their destination.
"I did, before the war. I was deeply disappointed in him when he left us in the tent though. Sure, he came back, but I was still bitter about it. I actually didn't want to get together with him after that. But then the war ended, I moved in with the Weasleys and it just seemed so natural..." her voice carried off. "Harry, I think you may have the same problem!"
into our relationship before we decided to start having sex. A hell of a lot longer than you and I have been together.”
“Yes,” she said, accepting the invitation with a nod of her head. Kyle followed behind her. “I have an invitation for you. Usually I would send such things by owl, of course, but I thought it better to deliver this one in person. I’m aware you might need some persuasion.”
Harry blinked at her a moment, thinking that the bags under his eyes likely looked as dark as hers. But she hadn’t seemed to notice that. “Good then,” he said finally. “I’ll give you my address. What time will you come to collect him?”
Vesper waved a hand dismissively. “It’s no big deal. He’s harmless. I showed him up pretty thoroughly during physical training today, and he even got to see me duel, so I think I’ve intimidated him into submission for now. But I do look forward to the day I get to duel him myself.”
"You are right, Ron, what she is doing is shameful." He tried to acknowledge the cause of Ron's anger. "She is not acting as a proper wife should. Hermione, how dare you show your face in this crowd?" he addressed the woman in front of him. He tried to be just mildly hurtful, but still maintain the facade of a good Light Wizard. He hoped he wasn't sweating too much because he was deathly afraid of saying the wrong thing.
"Dinky, please, gather my things and the children's, then bring everything here. You can also stay here with the other house-elves. I won't be returning to the house," Harry instructed quietly and the elf popped away.
As always, I thank my two betas for all their work. Faye, because she bares my moaning about my insecurities and keeps telling me that my chapters are good. Icicle, because she ruthlessly edits my mistakes and lets me know when something is weird. I need someone to tell me when I could improve.
He still had the feeling that he had forgotten an important piece of his past. He followed the feeling and found himself sitting in the living room in the Burrow. Ginny was beside him and he had his arms around her as she leaned into him. Bill and Fleur were also in front of him in a similar position, but they kept glancing at each other even as they talked. Their eyes. They bothered him. He couldn't name what it was exactly at first, but then he realised that it was true love. They seemed to shine with an inner light. He looked down at Ginny and he couldn't see it. Then he thought of himself and he couldn't feel it. Not that love.
"Yeah, well, what you don't know is that he intends to put a body slave tattoo on me and then use my little white arse for his own pleasure," he cringed at the thought in disgust.
"I can do something! I'm going to go and speed up the divorce process." There was conviction in his voice in spite of all the alcohol. "I can do it. I just haven't because I hoped I could get her back. Well, not anymore!"
"Of course not! He turned out to be a good friend that's all. We do spend a lot of time together talking, debating, but it's an intellectual friendship. He is great though. He's a really talented politician with very good ideas on how to make Our World a better place and not just for purebloods. He's a wonderful father to his son. He makes sure he studies well, but also plays with him a lot. However, he does punish rule breaking while still remaining a loving dad. He is nice to his wife, even though it's obvious that they are nothing more than friends. If he does have affairs, then even I don't notice and you know how observant I am. To me, he is a gracious and attentive host. With such qualities, he fulfils the requirements of a 'great man' in my book," she finished and looked at Harry with a challenge in her eyes.
Meanwhile, Harry tried to think through what he was going to actually say to Arthur that evening and tried to make himself comfortable on the sofa in the living room. However, his thoughts kept returning to the little boy had had met. Scorpius looked a lot like his father, but he was much nicer than Draco was as a boy. He was younger than when they first met, so maybe Draco was like that at one time. Harry shook his head, dismissing the idea of Draco ever being so sweet as his son. It must have come from somewhere though. The dark-haired man tried to recall Astoria Malfoy, wondering if she influenced her son. They had not met often, just a few times during Ministry balls. She hadn't seemed like a particularly warm person, a lot like Narcissa. Of course, the older Malfoy woman had only displayed her warmth in a time of crisis, so perhaps Astoria was like that as well.
Dinky laid out their breakfast. Harry ate ham and eggs with toast, James cereals, Albus a sandwich and Lily porridge. The tea was served and doctored to their tastes as well and their fruit juice was poured. Ginny insisted on them having fruit juice even when she was not there. Just as every morning.
"Draco, how come you know your way around the airport so well?" he asked, as they waited for their call to board.
As they waited for their main course, Harry looked around the place. Ginny was chattering about some restaurant she had been to during her travels, but he wasn't paying much attention to her. His eyes wondered to the very centre of the establishment, where a table was situated in the most prominent position. He assumed it was for people who actually wanted to be seen at the Alchemist. When he recognised who was actually sitting there, he stared for a moment, then blinked, then realised that he actually stepped in the middle of a scheme. For there she was, Hermione dressed in a most strikingly elegant dress, her hair tumbling down her shoulders in carefully sculptured waves, and as she laughed and flipped her hair, a diamond twinkled in her ear.
"Of course." Harry signed with great practice as he had given his autograph for many people before. He used another way to sign his name on official papers to distinguish the two.
"But ... but," she choked, holding back her tears. "I got you involved in all  of this. First Ron is angry with you, now Ginny is taking away your kids.  And there was that awful Howler from Mrs. Weasley. She's been my mum since I  couldn't make my own remember me! How could she say those dreadful things to  me?" She couldn't hold them in anymore, the tears came pouring out of her.
She smiled, and went on eating her food. While eating the rest of their meal, she explained to him the diet in greater detail, making Harry dread the coming months. It was not going to be easy. For a second he wondered why he went along with it, then remembered that nowadays, he always went along with everything.
They parted at the door and Ginny headed to the clothes section in the back. They mostly sold costumes, but children often enjoyed dressing up in their everyday lives. Harry loved picking something out for his little girl and looked around in a loss as to what he should get Lily. He spotted a section above which said 'Dragons' in glittering letters. Lily had a fascination for dragons of late and he was sure to find something there.
Now, time to thank my lovely beta. Faye, you’re always such a big help. I’d lack some serious amount of commas and capital letters without her. Also, for the life of me I can’t learn that it’s Floo, not Flo.
"This is the famous Circus Maximus." Draco had decided to play the tour guide. "They used to hold the carriage competitions here."
"Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Potter! Welcome to the Alchemist." She was extremely pleasant, but not in an annoying way. "I'll get a table for you right away," she said as she looked at the book in front of her. She seemed to nod to herself and gestured to her guests: "Right this way."
“It’s going to be all right, Hermione. We’ll figure it out,” he tried to calm her down a bit. “Go upstairs and make yourself comfortable. Lie down a bit.”
Harry got up. Ginny had got the papers then. They had timed it so that she got them after they returned from Rome.
"She's a disgrace, that's what she is!" Ron remarked after he consumed enough alcohol to drown a goldfish.
I know that Ron seems weird at this point, but I have a reason for that. Also, remember that this is 14 years after the end of Book 7 before the Epilogue and a lot has changed since then.
"No buts," he said, trying to be more determined with his wife just as he promised the night before. "Now, how about some lunch? I know the kids are away with your mum, but we should still eat."
On Boxing Day everyone in the Potter family was busy outside the home. The children all had play-dates, even Albus, who was not the most popular boy in his class. Ginny had lunch that would take all afternoon with some of the wives she met in the homes of the Wizengamot members. Harry, therefore, was free to visit Malfoy Manor once more. He could once again enjoy the walk up to the house, and he took great delight in the Malfoy gardens shrouded in white snow. Among the trees, he spotted a filled feeder for the deer. The warming charms did a great service to him once more as the sun was hiding behind a thick layer of clouds. To his amazement, he saw a white horse approaching from among the woods, with a rider clad in black sitting on top. It came at a trot, and as it neared him, he could see Lucius Malfoy on the steed. His long hair rose and fell behind him and he wore an uncharacteristic smile on his face. Harry hadn't talked to the elder Malfoy for a long time as he seemed to stay away whenever Harry visited. The horse stopped next to the dark-haired man and the blond got off the saddle.
"So you think that Malfoy would have a different attitude towards my divorce because he's a Dark Wizard?"
"No. I just wanted to prepare you for a fight." She smiled and marched out of the room, her high-heeled boots clapping on the marble.
"I don't understand." Draco looked confused at the remark and the other man seemed to regret saying it right away.

Both men got ready, and even Draco took less time than usual. He was obviously keen to show the city to Harry.
Once the story ended, they all went on their way. James ran up to his room to do his homework quickly. Al went after him, but slowly enough to keep on reading his book from that morning. He had very little homework and what he did have, he usually did during the breaks between classes. Lily skipped upstairs, proclaiming loudly that she would draw pictures based on the story. Harry called after her to make sure that she would show them to him later. Dinky appeared in front of Harry, asking him about dinner, so he gave the elf the parchment with the list and asked him to prepare something light with the remaining food.
Harry woke up to the sound of the alarm clock going off. Like every other morning, he reached over to hit the snooze button. Just ten more minutes. Again, just as always, ten more minutes were not enough, but he got up anyway and headed to the bathroom to take care of his morning routine. After that he went down to the kitchen to find Dinky preparing breakfast and sat down at the head of the table. The same as every morning.
"Don't frown, Potter. I know you didn't know about your seats, but I still can't help my frustration over that. You have no idea how much pain Weasley has been giving me over the years," he said, misinterpreting the other man's expression. Harry was silently glad for that.
“It’s perfectly all right sirs,” the manager replied. “In fact, we have been looking for a pianist and wondered if you would be available,” he turned to Draco.
When his spurts ceased, and he was once again flaccid, Draco let him go and crawled up to his face. He was grinning like the proverbial cat. Harry's breathing was still rapid. The blond caressed his face tenderly.
The next day Draco moved through Heathrow with ease, guiding them straight to the check-in. Once inside the duty-free area, they still had an hour before their flight. They checked out the many stores, and ate some Muggle food at Gordon Ramsay Plane Food. Harry had no idea that they served such food at airports. He always supposed it was more McDonalds than fine dining, even though they were only eating breakfast. Harry had a bracing glass of whisky there, in spite of the early hour. He had never flown on a plane before, and he needed the Dutch courage.
By the time they got to the Forum Romanum, Harry was tired. He never thought the hill had so many interesting ruins besides the Forum. However, that part was clearly the most fascinating one, and in spite of his exhaustion, he still kept walking. The lure of the ancient stones was too great to stop. At the end they got to a very decorated Arch.
He had flown high up before, but not so high. He couldn't believe that in such a short time they had already flown so far. Below them there was water, and the great landmass of Europe rolling under them. Still, they were going up and up, towards space. However, he didn't feel the thrust of the engines anymore, and if he wasn't hearing them, he would have been afraid that they had stopped. After that, the window was swallowed up by the clouds, and finally, they broke above the cloud cover. At that moment, Harry felt like he had arrived to another world. The clouds below him made out hills and valleys, all shining in the sunlight.
Harry couldn't hear what he was saying for a few moments as his heart was thumping too loudly in his chest, drowning out all sounds. Then he felt a hand take his and looked down to see pale fingers wrapped around his darker ones. He turned his head to look at Draco, who was smiling. No, that was an understatement. Positively grinning from ear to ear. Harry couldn't help but grin back and for the first time that day, he was calm. He knew that with the other man beside him, he could face the whole Weasley clan with the kind of determination that he needed.
This is a new fic I’m working on. I’m planning on putting up one chapter every week. I’m also looking for a new beta who can help me with styling issues and encouragement. Please email me if you’d like to help. Also, reviews keep my muse fed and happy.
Draco elegantly sat down in front of the grand piano, his long fingers caressed the keys for a moment. Then he began a beautiful ballad that enchanted Harry. As he watched his hands play the piano, he remembered them playing other things and had to fight the urge to drag the man away from the restaurant.
"We always used Muggle transportation to go abroad. Father never liked having his movements monitored."
He was followed by Albus, who found his chair with only a glance away from his book. Harry let out a sigh at the title
"Well, perhaps not in the Wizarding World, but in the Muggle World they do. I saw some ads for musicians in small bands," Harry informed him. "Why don't you have a look?"
He looked around the living-room and dropped the books on the coffee table.  He gave an exhausted sigh and looked around. It seemed awfully quiet.
Harry found his glasses on the table beside the bed and after he put them on he could observe the blond. To his alarm, the other man was in his boxers as well.
Just as they were sitting down in the dining-room and getting ready to eat according to their new meal plan, the Floo chimed for the second time that night, signalling a new arrival. Harry motioned for the kids to go ahead and eat their salads. He noted that James made a face, obviously missing his peanut butter sandwich.
After they had watched the owl quickly disappear through an open window, Harry smiled reassuringly at Hermione and suggested she lie down for a bit. She looked somewhat relieved that they had the beginning of a plan, so she was optimistic about getting a small nap. Harry decided to continue reading the book he had purchased, in order to prepare for his meeting with Malfoy. If the blond would meet him, that is. So, Harry went to his own room and lay down on the top of the covers, pillows fluffed up behind him and started to read.
"My turn. Now...I've never done this before. I don't know what you like, so if I do anything wrong, just tell me."
"You were a kid and Voldemort was living in your house. It must have been hard to think clearly at the time." Harry tried to lighten the load.
They both enjoyed their meal silently for a while, but the breakfast table was too quiet without any children around.
Afterwards, he was strapped into a seat that the girl levitated out of an adjoining room. She performed the spell and soon he was whizzing through the International Floo Network towards home. As he sprawled out the floor of the office in the UK and dry vomited, he was glad to be home. All he could think about was having a good cry on Draco's shoulder.
“Let her in, and take her to the green parlour,” he instructed. “Excuse me.” He left the table to wait for Ginny.
The two men looked up at the sound and Harry recognised the man occupying  his seat. He was Jimmy Peaks, who had taken over one of the
The International Floo was a difficult ride. It wasn't exactly like a regular Flo, but rather like the carts at Gringotts. Harry had to sit in a seat-like contraption and have a spell cast on him that would guide him to his chosen destination. It started from an office that was situated on a side street off of Diagon Alley. Harry seriously loathed that mode of transportation and would have rather flown. However, the thought of sitting on a plane for about seventeen hours put him off.
He moved his right hand lower to find Draco's anus. He felt a bit weird about putting his finger in there, but he supposed soon enough another part of his anatomy would also be inside the man. As his fingertip encountered the opening, he circled it, partly to tease, partly to actually find the entrance, as he was keeping his eye on the beautiful face above him. Draco's eyes were closed, his head periodically turned from side to side, he moaned, keened, and sighed. Harry couldn't believe the variety of voices he was making. As he inserted a finger into its destination, he saw the blond jerk and let out an even louder moan. Harry almost forgot to pull out his finger, he was so transfixed by what the man was doing. Then he noticed that he needed to lubricate his finger, as it was dry down there. He should have realised that before, but it was just one of those things that was so different from a woman's body. So he put his middle finger into his mouth to spread his saliva over it, and put it back in. He returned to sucking the gorgeous cock before him, and timed his finger to synchronise with the movements of his mouth.
"I know that. I wasn’t going to whip out my violin either. Mind you, what I want to take out is long and lean," Draco chuckled at his own bad pun, as things boiled between them.
“It was arranged when she was only a few months old. We both knew that and had such expectations of each other. She has her wing in the manor and I have mine. That’s how these things work in our world,” he informed her.
The Thai witch looked up. She was very young and pretty. Harry wondered if there were any ugly Thai people, or they hid them somewhere.
"No. Though I'm going to prove to you just how proficient I am at playing an instrument," the other said, wiggling his brow.
"No." He kissed a pale shoulder. "Never. I'm just...not sure if I can do that to the children. She's still their mother. The divorce will surely be in the papers, and what I do will reflect on them as well."
"Really, Ron, what were you thinking?" He no longer whispered, but still didn't shout like he wanted to.
Happy Holidays everyone! Good news is that there are only a few more chapters to go. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I rewrote the ending. When I started the story I wrote out a detailed summary of what is going to happen. However, as I wrote this chapter, I realised a few things about the kind of man my Harry was. Maybe he doesn't seem all that cannon sometimes, but we do have to take into account that it's 15 years after the War, and he's the father of three children. Above all, he's a good father, and when I rewrote the ending, I was thinking like he would.
They got to a point where there was a great view of the city, and Draco pointed out that they could see the house from there.
"Yes. I know that among Dark wizards who have arranged marriages such a thing would not be a reason for divorce, but I can't live like that."
The next day they filed the papers and Harry was officially divorced. He was glad that it was over, and that it was done without all the drama that Hermione was going through, who also had a big day in court the following day. However, the Slythendor trio decided to ask for a little private time with Ron before it, and he agreed to the surprise of everyone.
"We will stand together, Harry. Frankly, I can't wait to see their eyes when you take your place next to me in the Wizengamot. I'll save you a seat." He smirked.
"That's right. It figures that you would name one of your kids after the old man," he said and the ambivalent feelings towards the great wizard could be heard in his voice.
Harry blushed. It was very obvious that he had enjoyed it, as his erection pressed into the flaccid member of the pale man.
Harry made short work of his clothes, he was so eager to get on with it. When they were both down to their underwear, they crashed together, lips locking. However, there was nothing gentle about it. It felt like a battle as to who could consume the other one. When Harry kissed Ginny before, he never felt the tension. She was the passive one, but there wasn't anything passive about Draco. Either of them could win the battle for dominance and it was a challenge. The fight thrilled Harry.
"Later, Harry. Once we are in the open, we could get all the kids together and have them play together."
“Isn’t that a surprise. I though with his temper he would let loose a few punches now and then. If he’s so great, why are you divorcing him anyway?” Malfoy gave her a smirk, making it obvious to her that she had made a mistake in marrying the man in the first place.
"Yes, but it has more details and actual science in it. The stories are in fact detective stories where his main character, Eileen Prince, a brilliant private detective uses innovative methods in Potions to solve cases."
"I most certainly do. I also like what I see and sometimes feel." He poked a teasing tongue out a bit.
Harry stepped out the door and found himself on a busy wide street. Cars and bicycles of all shapes and sizes were hurrying about. All around there were restaurants, massage parlours, and small hotels trying to attract tourists with colourful signs. He tried to remember what the man had said. He went down one street to his right, then turned left and started walking on that street. He was glad that there was a sidewalk as the cars zooming past him were going fast and honking a lot. It did hurt his ears as such sounds rarely reached the wizarding world. He was quickly tiring, the walk making him hotter than it actually was, and he was sweating a lot. He cursed himself for not thinking to pack a bottle of water. He had been walking for some time when it occurred to him that perhaps he had gone the wrong way, or the hotel wasn't as near as he thought. He saw a small food-stand on a corner and tried to get directions, but the man just wanted to sell him the food. His stomach still churned at the thought of eating and he hurried off, a little bit green. He kept on walking, hoping to spot the building as he had seen it on a picture Ginny had taken on her previous trip. Still, no luck.
"Therefore, you need to gather support for yourself first, my boy," he explained further. "The other members need to see that you are indeed a reliable young man worthy of such a position.
