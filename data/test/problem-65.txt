Blaise had started laughing quietly. Hermione was letting out small chuckles as i stared at them.
Draco POV
I sighed and leaned back on the chair. I picked up a photo of Blaise, Pansy and Draco all together in 8th year, after the war. Next to it was a picture of Blaise and his boy friend, presumably on vacation. On the shelf behind his desk was a photo of what i assumed was his family. I saw Mrs. Zabini holding a bundle with a tall dark skin man kissing her cheek, smiling. I smiled at the happy family photo.
Draco loved seeing him cook. He would sit in the kitchen barstool while harry cooked for hours, just observing everything he did. He memorized the recipes he used and this time he recognized that harry was making fettuccine Alfredo.
" yeah how did you guys even know where the party was? And when?" Hermione questioned. All three went quiet.
"What the hell blaise? You scared the living shit out of me..." he looked up and saw me. His face of nuisance shifted to one of worry. He went around his desk to me and grabbed my shoulders. I let out a shuddered breathe and immediately fell into his embrace. He hugged me tightly and rubbed my back.
" is hermione telling you not to do this?"
" no actually, I swallow." He retorted.
Harry POV
" its going to be okay."
The words blurted out if my mouth like it was trapped and trying to escape. Draco and Pansy's jaws were on the floor. Then all of a sudden pansy stood up and started jumping. Draco was trying to hide a smile.
Ron realised the position harry and draco were in.
" i dont believe it!"
" pretend? Theres nothing to pretend, i already do." It slips out before i could even stop it. Harry's face falls into one of shock.
" dad! Lilly wont give me my wand back!"
He looked at me with a sad look and looked up at the ceiling.
" why are you so breathless anyway?"
" i was born ready. Are you ready to be completely babied by my mom and tortured by my brothers? I have 5 of them." i teased back. He chuckled and nodded.
Ron frantically weaved through the crowd, trying to find blaise. At the same time blaise was doing the same thing. They finally met each other in the center of a full crowd. This engagement party was more of a ball than a party. Well what were they expecting? A Zabini threw it.
" yes it is. You are dismissed." He nodded. We both stood up and went for the door. The other 4 followed us, pansy grabbing onto Hermione, trying not to fall. Hermione was blushing but she somehow managed to hide it. I turned towards Zabini.
" ummm Adam, what are you doing in my apartment?" He pulled away from me, still holding onto my waist.
" al right. For what may i ask? "
" it was wonderful seeing you dear." She says, kissing my cheek.
I turn my head and checked the large grandfather clock hanging off my wall. Usually i wouldn't wake up so late but i got home at nearly 4 in the morning and didn't sleep for another hour, so i let it go this time. Thank god it was a sunday and i didnt have work. It was now around 2 pm. I woke up at 12 and the letter took about 2 hours so it was well into the day. The dinner was in 6 hours so i thought i would get ready soon.
Draco looked around his office.
" i dont know. There isnt a point in living i guess."
Ron winced as he rubbed the place draco had punched.
" yes."
Fuck.
" i needed to see you. You didnt go home and i was worried." Adam reached for Blaise. Blaise flinched and stepped away.
" we're 18."
Ron was cheering as a hufflepuff seeker grabbed the golden snitch. I wasn't paying much attention because draco was too busy shivering. The boy never brings a damn scarf.
" ive entered stage 3."
" names?" She asks once she looks up.
" alright then, lets get your measurements honey." She motioned ron to follow her to the corner with mirrors.
“Are you familiar with nightshade?”
“Sara and I think you’re catching on to the arithmancy material quick enough to start meeting with her more regularly. We’ll start having these weekly meetings in her office so she can stay looped in. Shall we head over?”
“I guess so,” Harry said. “I was in a pretty good rhythm honestly; didn’t realize what time it was until my stomach started growling in the library. I think I must have disturbed the entire floor when it did.” Harry blushed as soon as the words were out of his mouth. “Besides, you’re always working. I don’t know how you do it.”
“It’s just, well, fall term starts tomorrow and I really need somewhere to stay…”
“A temporary basis will suffice, Malfoy,” Harry responded.
“This smells amazing, Potter,” Draco said.
“Sorry, I haven’t been to the store yet,” Harry told him. “I’ll replace it, and you can help yourself, of course.”
“This smells great, Ron. The salad looks great too,”
Harry picked up his trunk and took a deep breath. He'd been planning on apparating, but he was hit with a wave of nostalgia. Instead, Harry made his way to King’s Cross. At the counter he asked for one ticket to Paris, France.
Draco led Harry to a booth in the corner of the pub.
Harry’s eyes narrowed slightly. Draco took a large drink of his wine. Had he gone too far, quoting Snape on their very first day of potions class? Would Harry even remember?
“Well, they’re not exactly wrong there,” Harry mused.
Hours later, Harry went to bed. But sleep eluded him. He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling above him, thoughts bouncing around in his mind.
Harry rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
He looked down. Draco had left the newspaper under the letter. His eyes grew wide as they fell upon the front page.
Once again, they found themselves face to face.
“Arithmancy?” Hermione asked.
Since when?”
“Maybe you’ll make it in alchemy after all, Potter,” he teased. “You’re right, it’s infused with some magic lavender.”
Draco didn’t acknowledge this, but he didn’t tell Harry to leave either, which Harry considered to be a good sign.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “Would you stop calling me that?” he asked, the annoyance in his voice clear.
Harry’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“Me too,” Draco replied. They both spoke in hushed tones, as if they were afraid to be heard. Draco turned to face Harry.
As the kissed, Draco’s hands made their way up Harry’s torso. He began unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, then his own. He threw both to the ground.
Draco’s pale face was now flush with excitement.
Draco finally looked at Harry. “Ah, that’s it. Much better.”
Harry was sitting on his bed, flipping through
“Fajitas,” Harry told him. “You’re welcome to have some, but it will be at least half an hour before anything is ready.”
Harry thought to himself. He followed the man.
Hermione drew her head back to look him in the eyes. “I know. I just want you to know I’m really proud of you for trying something new, something you care about.”
Internally, Harry cringed.
Harry chuckled at that. Draco paused for a moment, deciding whether or not to be offended. He decided to ignore it and raised his wine glass.
Harry nodded.
Or maybe, he’d wanted to kiss Harry.
“They’re actually engaged,” Harry told her.
“The check would be great,” Harry said.
Harry didn’t have time to react. One minute, Draco was sitting across the table from him, the next he was grabbing his hand.
Draco gave Harry a warm smile.
“Alright,
“No, in fact, we have some exciting news.”
“It’s going well,” Harry said.
“Oh, Draco,” he said, leaning over to give him a kiss.
“We’ve actually decided not to get a new roommate,” Hermione told him.
he wondered.
Draco was stunned. He had only had one inquiry so far, and he hadn’t been able to respond.
thought Draco.
Draco leading them on a walk.
to say the least. The walls were plastered with quidditch posters, but only of the Harpies. Harry was stunned to see Ginny Weasley do a quick maneuver on her broom before turning to wink at him. Stranger though, there was no furniture in the room. Instead,
“No, but we could work something out, right girls?” Jeanine looked to Cindy and Cassie, who continued to nod.
Finally, Harry’s legs remembered how to move, and he backed out of the doorway.
“Harry Potter,” Pansy gushed.
“If you insist, Potter,” Draco said with a slight grin.
“What is it?”
Harry’s mind continued to wander, and he remembered catching a sight of Draco in the lab. Draco had looked intense as he worked over the cauldron. The mental image sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
Harry had just taken a bite of his sandwich when he heard someone else arrive. He was surprised. Draco was rarely home before eight.
enough concentration to distract him from school or work or whatever else he might have going on.
Harry thought wistfully.
Harry could have sworn Draco winked at him. He had to have imagined it though. In no sane world would Draco Malfoy wink at him.
Ron shook his head. “Doesn’t matter,” he told her. “What matters now is that Harry finds something that makes him happy.” He turned back to Harry. “Any ideas what you’re going to do next.”
Eventually, Harry let out a sigh.
Yet here they were. Roommates. Roommates who hung out sometimes. And maybe roommates who kissed?
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry called out.
“And are you happy with that decision?” Hermione asked carefully.
“Come on then.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hand once more. This time, their fingers interlaced.
“Harry? Harry Potter?”
Draco cocked his head. “Maybe. What would I know? I was going to say they’re stunning.”
On the way, he ran into Vivian.
Harry took a breath and stepped into the doorway. Draco didn’t budge.
Harry arrived outside his old flat via apparition. It felt odd apparating to the hallway instead of directly into the flat that he’d lived in for years. He faltered for a moment, trying to decide if he should knock on the door or just enter. Before he had made a decision, the door opened. It was Hermione.
Harry turned his head to see Madame Rosmerta behind the counter.
“That sounds fascinating,” Hermione raved. “Honestly, Harry, we’re so proud of you.”
His eyes wandered, and he saw the small whisk he had just cleaned sitting on the counter.
“Oh?” asked Harry. He supposed it made sense, they didn’t
“What do you need, Potter,” asked Draco, never breaking gaze from the cauldron.
Harry continued sucking, the sound of Draco moaning his name ringing in his ear. He felt his own erection growing even harder in his pants.
“Truth be told, I’m lousy at cooking, but I’m sure I can figure it out.”
“So, you brought me here for a butterbeer?” Harry asked.
“I think that sounds wonderful, Harry,” Hermione said. “I just wish I’d known in Hogwarts that you would have such an interest in arithmancy, we could have studied together!”
Draco shook his head and walked back to his room to finish getting ready for the day.
Draco didn’t have to be told twice. He loaded up his plate, eager to dig in.
“Just fine, how are you settling in?”
Draco stood over a smoking pot. Harry slowed for a moment to take in the sight of Draco sharp features. He looked intense, stirring the pot, and muttering some incantation under his breath. After a moment, Harry sped back up realizing that Vivian hadn’t slowed at the sound.
“God, Harry,” Draco moaned, running his fingers through Harry’s hair. “That feels amazing.”
“That’s quite alright,” Harry told Jeanine. “I’m sure you’re quite full already, you don’t need a messy man taking up space.”
Harry nodded, unable to form a coherent sentence.
Draco let out another laugh. “No, she certainly wasn’t.”
“What?” Harry asked. “What are you up to.”
“No, they’re together. Happier than ever, actually, I imagine they’ll get engaged soon. I was surprised to see Pansy here though, didn’t realize you two were still an item.”
“Um, yeah, I’m living with another grad student… they aren’t in my program though.”
Sighing, Draco read the letter again. It read:
Harry followed Vivian into an old, stone building and followed her through a series of hallways that felt like a labyrinth. As they passed one room, a loud bang emerged and Harry turned to look. Through a small window, Harry saw a familiar figure.
Draco, gin and tonic in hand, made his way to the door, but Harry didn’t budge.
Draco stared at him, in shock. After a beat, he snapped out of it. “Yes, I have an extra room.”
“It’s my initial,” Harry cut in defensively. “Didn’t want to sign my full name, obviously.”
When they entered his room, Draco pulled back again. “You’re okay with this?” he asked.
Harry spun around.
“Of course, there’s no return correspondence address,” Draco muttered to himself. Just then, he heard the distinctive crack of a person apparating in his living room. His bedroom door flew open.
Pansy’s eyebrows shot up. “Harry? I didn’t realize you two were on a first name basis.”
Per usual, Draco woke up on Sunday to the telltale crack of someone arriving by apparition in the living room. Unusually, the crack was followed by a piercing scream.
“Relax,” Harry teased, “I’ve hardly been gone for two weeks.”
Harry found Draco in the kitchen, surrounded by Chinese takeout boxes. Draco raised his eyes.
Pansy sat down on the couch and faced Harry.
Harry bristled. “I’ll keep looking,” he said. Sure, beyond skimming the advertisements in the
“I just thought we were becoming friends. At least.”
he thought.
“Rumor has it you like men too, Potter.”
A moment later she reappeared with the check.
Harry certainly felt like an outsider, with no previous classes or work experience in arithmancy. Still, when Professor Norwood began lecturing, he was entranced. He felt like Hermione, taking more notes than he, in all honesty, ever had taken in Hogwarts.
“Hang on,” Draco said abruptly. He strode to his room and came back a minute later wearing a light green v-neck tee. Harry didn’t know if he’d ever seen Draco in casual attire.
Drinks, out, with Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, looking at his drink. “Right, I’m actually being coadvised on my research by an alchemy professor.”
“But Potter, how could you understand this if you didn’t first learn what happens when you add the powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
He looked down at his lap. I stared at him for a bit. The boy i had liked for so long was dying, because he liked someone else. No, not liked...
" oh fuck no. Your not getting away with it that easily pretty boy." Hermione came up to him and sat next to him, arms wrapped around his neck.
" its a dog!"
Eventually i closed my eyes and put my head down. I grabbed Harry's hand tight, never letting go. He didnt even look at me. He adverted his eyes down to his lap and stared at it.
" because blaise was sleeping in my room." I take a sip from my coffee. Hermione slams her hand on the table and stares at me.
" ron , you are marrying him." Harry said. I rolled my eyes and Hermione smacked him with her spoon. Harry grimaces and grabs the back of his head where Hermione hit him.
Ron walked towards me with each and every word. I was stunned. I missed out on so much. It was all true, the clues...
" Call the ambulance, its too dangerous to floo and we definitely cant apparate again." I yell as i put pressure on his abdomen, where the wound was the worst.
" tell me what?"
" alright then. Lets get lunch, then lets head over to the manor." We agree.
" yep. Did u get your dresses?" Harry responded. Hermione lifted up the bags and nodded.
" OUT! And get Ms.Granger in here."
Rons POV
" well i just-"
" thank you for saving him."
———————————————————————-
" you motherfucker, you did it!" He hugged me first. He engulfed me in a bear hug and turned towards harry that looked confused.
I finally stepped out of the shower, shivering from the sudden coldness. I used a drying spell and quickly dried myself. I was halfway through dressing when it came. A cough attack.
I nodded reluctantly as she called for ron. He came in a few seconds later, she grabbed both our arms and we vanished.
" thanks."
" no its not. I got........jealous of you and ron while you were planning such a nice gesture and i ruined it." Harry said disappointedly.
" wait time for what?" Ron looked confused. Poor thing, dont know whats going to hit him.
" you haven't even started on your own office." Harry gestured towards the still unorganized pile of papers sitting in the box.
" so what do i do?" I ask, jumping from one foot to the other.
We were finally at Zabini Manor. After an hour of trying to pick out what i wear we were finally here.
" i have him LEGALLY, but, i dont have him. Like his heart. His love." I sigh. Hermione nods and harry makes an 'O' face.
—————
At first it was just a few petals, then it was a handful, until it was a full flower and now i was practically throwing up bouquets. The gallons of blood i had coughed up washed away as i turned on the sink faucet, taking the petals with it.
" hey dad. Sorry we're late. Orion and Tobi were taking WAY too long i swear."
" so it is him. Finally. You've been obsessed with him since 1st year." She chuckled.
A/n: thats it. Hope you enjoyed.
" ENOUGH! I don't want a platonic relationship, i don't want to just call him my fiancé as a joke or pet name, i don't want to be just his friend." I snapped. Harry and Hermione looked at me in worry.
" of course mate. We'll get him. I promise."
" well then. Its time for me to go. I hope to see you and your boyfriend soon my dear. And make sure to write." She kissed my cheek and turned around to open the door but before she walked out she turned back one last time.
" harry you're speaking parseltongue." Hermione explained.
" you were gonna propose again." Harry said through his hands, thoroughly embarrassed by his own behavior.
" im gonna love seeing him whipped." Harry explains. I raise and eyebrow and let out a sigh.
" excuse me? No. Im not going to leave everyone i love for you. They are my life, you realise that?" I say. I pull his arms off me and walk into the living room.
" ron. Outside. A word." I stood up and grabbed him by his ear. I dragged him outside and into the hallway so we were out of earshot from the great hall.
" im ready, what?" Harry said flustered. They all laughed as harry blushed.
" you are the one who is in love with him but too much of a pussy to say it. And now he is dying because you wouldn't tell him you're true feelings and now he thinks you've rejected him!"
" no no Madam pomfrey, i can help-"
After the party ended, we went back home. We all ended up staying at Grimmauld in case Adam or the other two came to pester us some more. We stayed up all night, talking, playing board games and drinking. It was the perfect end to a not so perfect day.
"Are you dating anyone?" Blaise pulled me out of my thoughts. I remembered the ring and turned a little red.
" your marrying me darling. I love you too." I whisper.
" WHAT?" Harry immediately jumps up. Their tired faces were completely gone. They shared a look of confusion and interest.
" because harry, draco has had a tough life. His father is dead, his mother is in jail forever, he had to do unimaginable things to get in his fathers and the dark lords favor. And by some miracle, for the first time in over 2 years, im finally seeing my best friend smile. And that is thanks to you. So i will not let my best friends only happiness slip away, it is my duty as his best mate. And also pansy has gotten a liking to you and im already in too deep. If she knows i let you give up she will murder me into oblivion."
Harry spoke in parseltongue. The words sent shivers down dracos spine, making him more flustered.
" mark my words"
" alright. Engagement party it is." Mrs.Zabini jumped in her chair in delight.
" and?"
Blaise POV
With shaking fists i walked out on my best friend. I heard them call out for me but i couldnt hear them. I didnt want to. If he was gonna do this, i couldn't be there.
" trust me harry. As his best friend, i can tell he does. It isnt a matter of whether your silly high school crush likes you, its a matter of life or death. And for the first fucking time in your life, put your own life before someone else's, please for the love of god."
" no adam. No. we are not doing that and i sure as hell am not marrying YOU!" I yelled back. He lunged forward and grabbed my forearm forcefully. I yanked back and before i knew it i had apparated. I apparated to the only place i could think of, Ron. I landed in his office to see ron sitting at his desk. He gasped and fell off the swivel desk chair. He got up and dusted off his pants.
" hes my fiance." I said quickly, my head in my hands.
" do you think i should tell them?" Harry asked out of the blue. I shrugged and moved my knight.
" will you marry me?"
" okay, so i gotta meet with Kingsley at 10. Hermione has work, and im hoping if draco and pansy are there you too wont make a mess of yourselves?" I asked pointing at Harry. Pansy and Draco were healers at St. Mungos meanwhile Hermione was an unspeakable and Harry was an Auror with me. He nodded and we walked over to the fire place. We each grabbed a handful of floo powder. I stepped into the fire place first.
“This isn’t just a gin and tonic, is it?”
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” Harry called out. He buried into the living room with one shoe on and his tie undone.
“I’m almost impressed, Potter,” Draco said, in a tone that almost sounded genuine.
Harry closed his eyes in another fruitless attempt to find sleep. Instead, memories of his night out with Draco came back in pieces.
The library clock sounded seven times. Harry looked up from his book and rubbed his eyes.
“Erm, I just came to say hi,” Harry told him.
Harry took a breath but said nothing.
Harry looked stunned. “Um, what do you have in mind?”
“I’m sure you were,” Draco replied.
" yeah. You knew. Just get on with it." I snapped. It was extremely exhausted but also annoyed he was in the room with me. Our relationship didnt end on good terms, in fact on VERY bad terms. When he had found out i started dating lavender after 3 months, he went ballistic. So after that i decided to cut ties with him, until this one unlucky day. Where the hell is blaise?
" shit." He cursed as he was bent over the bucket, throwing up flowers. When he was done he looked up at me and smiled.
I chuckled. Real, genuine laughs escaped from my mouth.
" oh on the contrary, you were his biggest fan." She said.
" stop laughing!" Draco huffed.
Harry POV
Harry paused. He looked down and then back up at me.
I knew i had grown fond of the boy but i didnt think i was in love. And I thought i was ready to start phase 2 of my plan; only it ended up with me coughing up my lungs filled with flowers. So i asked him on a date, and he refused. That sent me into a coughing fit and i ran out the room. From my mouth i pulled out a single petal, covered in saliva and blood.
" what? I thought you loved me! You dont love that good for nothing redhead! You should be with me! He doesn't deserve you!" He yelled in fury. I managed to escape from his grasp when he let go of me. I've only seen him angry once before and it ended up with me getting hit. Of course he apologized a thousand times over and i forgave him but the feeling never quite went away.
" a jack russel terrier."
" WHERE IS HE!"
" what the actual hell is wrong with you three? You, pick a fight at the hospital about something that happened 6 YEARS AGO. I mean who the hell does that, you are like the most unprofessional healer in the enter bloody world! And you, you propose to the man who broke up with you, told you no and who is marrying someone else! And you, lavender if you ever call him a snake again i will never speak to you again! Got it?" I bellowed, pointing at all three.
" there was a kiss cam"
" lavender shut up!" Hermione whisper yelled.
" what ya thinking?"
" h-harry?" Draco asked as harry leaned closed to dracos ear.
He was finally, truly, happy.
" okay. I can see how this would be weird, but lets not make it that. We're just engaged, it can be totally platonical." I started. Blaise just nodded and sipped on his tea.
" harry! Can you get that box for me?" Draco yelled as he struggled to carry the already high stack of boxes in his arms.
Draco nodded a response and continued his book. I listened to his heart beat, allowing myself to drift off.
" thats true. Okay try on the other one."
Ron leaned in closer to draco.
" -cuddling?" Ron finished.
" so the surgery went well. There was some bleeding in your liver but i got it fixed. Im here because some of the information on his sign up sheet was missing."
" BLAISE FUCKING ZABINI!"
" is it money? Ill lend it to you."
" i was supposed to have 3 months. Three . Now i have less than half a month." I whimpered. She reached over and hugged me. Tighter than ever. Like i was breaking to pieces and she had to keep them together. I muzzled my face into the crook of her neck, sobbing silent tears. She and i cried for what felt like hours, keeping the same position.
Suddenly draco scoots closer to me and wrapped the scarf around me too. He rested his head on my shoulder so it was more comfortable for us to share the scarf.
Harry scoffed and walked through the archway that led to harry's office. Both their offices had an open floor plan, one huge office with a arch way in the middle. Draco's was a little bit bigger as harry had a bigger office at hogwarts. There was a glass sliding door in the arch way so that they would get some peace and quiet, but still be able to see eachother.
" oh? And with whom?"
I examined the flower buds from my mouth. White petals with yellow buds covered the sink. Narcissus flowers.
" you can start by putting a healing charm around his  body. The cuts haven't fully recovered as i thought it might be too dangerous to heal it with magic but we have no time now. If those cuts open then he won't have much chance."
She raised her eyebrows and smiled softly.
" oh you petty, petty, tall giant." We chuckle and kiss once more.
" now fucking leave my engagement party because you're obviously not wanted!" I yell one last time before running out the door to Blaise.
" thank you." He whispered into my shoulder. My confusion broke out into a smile and i hugged him back.
I just couldnt
I shook my head and looked forward.
Blaise POV
" truth."
" really? You didnt know? After all the clues?! How he would only let YOU borrow his clothes, how he would constantly try to be around you, how he could never sleep properly knowing you weren't safe. Or how he loved to tease you and was constantly trying to make you feel better and how he would only let YOU stay behind in the infirmary? He wouldn't even let me stay the night and yet you got "hes dying because he loves me too much" privileges. For gods sake his flowers were NARCISSUS'!"
I watched as my knight dragged harry's pawn off the board.
Pomfrey came rushing in and stopped mid step when she saw me. Her eyes widened as big as dinner plates and she immediately went to work.
" do you like it?"
" no need to trample me as your doing it!" She shrieked. Blaise rolled his eyes and grabbed the book from rons hand.
The small Jack russel terrior ran off with his message a few seconds after being conjured. Ron turned back to the velvet couch, which held a now asleep Blaise Zabini. Ron smiled fondly at the picture before him. He grabbed the glass out of the unconscious boy's hand and set it back on the tray table. He found a blanket nearby and covered blaise with it. He looked at the picture once more.
" but you have me! What more could you want?" He asked. I stared at him in a mix of anger and sadness. This was going to be a long fight.
" nah, it isnt a big deal. it was bound to happen. She called you stuck up. I had to protect my fiancé." I smiled. Blaise let out a small chuckle and smiled as well. I dont know why but this make my stomach flutter, making him smile like that. We sat like that for a little more until i looked over at the clock. It was nearly 11 pm. I decided it was time to go home so i stood up from the couch. Before i could walk away, someone grabbed my wrist and held me back.
" im sorry, you're the one who bear trapped my friend in your arms." He gestured to them.
I was so focused on the photos i didnt even hear the fact that the yelling had stopped. I looked over the office more and more until i heard a door slam shut downstairs. Seconds later blaise entered the office, obviously frustrated. He sighed and grabbed a bottle of firewhiskey from the little tray table beside the door. He poured the ember liquid into a glass and took a big swig. I stared in his direction, my hands in my pockets.
" harry."
" im sorry mate. Im the one who gave you the dare, im the one who pushed you into this. Im so sorry, i-"
" yeah, It is. I love him. So will you leave me the fuck alone? Im not going to marry you!" Blaise yelled at adam. He then turned to me and bit his lip. I was so shocked all i could do was blink. He looked down and nodded.
At least they had each other.
" what are you doing here?" I yelled.
" i knew it." I fist bumped harry.
" i told you!"
I shifted away from him, trying not to wake him up. I got off my bed and walked over to the window. I sighed and opened the curtains more.
" oh you suck." I said sitting back up on my chair, face to face with him.
" we should talk, shall we?"
I sat opposite of her in a dark room. An auror was standing by the door, waiting for us to finish. I know i wasn't getting married right away, but in 5 years, my mother may not be here. Or at least her mind wont.
Blaise turned around to draco.
Harry potter, the boy who famously cheated death twice, and two more times at the hands of the person he loved most. Who saved the wizarding world and managed to contract hanahaki in his 8th year. The boy who lived under the stairs for 11 years, the boy who lost most everyone he loved in his life, the boy...... who lived, was finally happy.
Hermione shook her head at him.
Sighing, Draco placed the letter on his desk. “Let me shower, will you? Then we can get brunch.”
“I had fun tonight,” Harry said.
The man, who had signed the advertisement and correspondence “J. R.” didn’t even look back at Harry. “Here’s the common space, and the kitchen,” he said, pointing.
“Yeah, no one in my class had a spare room but I found an advertisement in the
“And does your research require you to stare at me?”
“All worn out from our first week of grad school, are we?” Draco cooed.
“Well, you cook great food, yet you never leave a mess in the kitchen. Plus, you let me eat tons of your food. And you’re quiet, you pay rent on time.”
The two locked eyes.
“Try it,” Draco said, clinking the glass in Harry’s hand with his own.
ONE YEAR LATER
Harry continued to nod, thoughtfully. He didn’t want to live with Malfoy, of course, but he sure as hell didn’t want to receive a lecture from Hermione about how he ended up without a room to rent, the night before the start of his graduate program.
Harry raised his glass as a reply and took a sip. There was something he couldn’t identify.
Harry snorted. “God, remember when we had to buy that entire set for class? That was ridiculous.”
“That was fast,” she said. “Didn’t Jason just move out?”
“Let’s take those off,” Draco commanded, reaching towards Harry’s trousers.
“Erm, do you want to help?”
He took one of the notes, scrawled a quick “help yourself” on it, and stuck the note on one of the containers.
“Of course! You weren’t happy so you made a change! And I’m sure you’re learning so much now.”
“What is it?” he asked, not opening his eyes.
Harry blinked. “Well, yeah, she wasn’t getting around that one.”
The temperature had dropped significantly since they’d gone into the pub and the sun had set.
Finally, Draco pushed Harry back slightly. “Better stop there,” he said. “I’m close, and I haven’t even gotten to be inside you yet.”
“I was just going to live with another student,” he told her, defensively. “But then I thought about it and, I mean, we’ve been out of Hogwarts for years, I don’t want to go back to a dorm and living with students. So, um, now I’m looking for a roommate.”
“About ten,” the man told him.
Harry nearly spat out his drink. “What? No, I was just thirsty.”
Draco shrugged. He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t walk away either.
A few blocks from the flat, he came upon a farmer’s market. Harry slowly walked up and down the rows, admiring the produce. He had perused nearly every stall, and was trying to decide where to head next, when he heard someone calling out his name.
“Consider it a loan then,” she told him. “We’ll miss living with you, Harry. Are you sure you don’t need any help moving?”
“Potter, is it true, that you were living with Weasley and Granger?
As they worked together, Harry got to know his new classmates a bit better. He spent most of time with Hannah, an American who had just graduated from Ilvermorny at the top of her class, and David, who had gone back to school in order to better his chances of becoming a master arithmancer at work.
Harry groggily opened his eyes. He thought he heard water running.
“What do you want, Potter?”
“What, are you not The Chosen One?” Draco asked. “Do you prefer ‘The Boy Who Lived’ or ‘Savior of the Wizarding World?’”
Draco, on the other hand seemed oblivious to this fact. “Never mind, Potter, just leave me some will you?”
work out?”
“Do you even have to move?” asked Ron? “Can’t you just apparate every day?”
Puzzled, Harry walked to the kitchen. There was mail on the usually tidy table. Harry picked up the letter, addressed to him. Draco must have let the owl in as he slept. He opened it and found a cryptic message in Hermione’s distinctive scrawl across the page.
“Pansy, leave Potter alone, let’s just go hang out,” Draco said. Pansy ignored him.
“Right, nice to meet you, Vivian,” Harry said, extending a hand.
“I’m sorry, Harry, Kinglsey told me. Your boss wanted to make sure you were doing alright, and I guess he asked Kingsley and Kingsley asked me… Oh, I hope you aren’t upset, I didn’t want to pry until you were ready to tell us,” Hermione said.
“Let’s go to my room,” Draco murmured.
Harry stirred. Had he fallen asleep on the couch?
Draco walked into the kitchen.
“Well, should we head back?” Draco asked. “I suppose it’s a bit late, after all.”
From what he could tell, Draco didn’t spend very much time in his own flat. Most mornings, Draco had gone for a run, or to the gym, and showered before Harry woke up, and he usually returned home around eight p.m.
Harry rolled over, hoping sleep would take him back. As he drifted off, bits of the night before came to him sporadically. Harry had to admit, it had been a fun night.
Draco grabbing his hand, taking them to Hogsmeade.
Harry decided she was more than just a little tipsy.
Hermione knocked on the door to Harry’s room, waking him up.
Stunned, Harry followed Draco into the pub. He hadn’t been back to Hogsmeade since his sixth year, other than the brief moment with Aberforth when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were preparing to re-enter Harry during what would have been their seventh year. It felt strange to be back as an adult.
Harry wondered how long he had been standing there. Broken from his spell, he quickly averted his eyes and followed Vivian.
“What is it, Potter? Cat got your tongue?” Draco teased.
“Harry, did you request a French newspaper? There’s an owl here,” Hermione said through the door.
Ron and Hermione looked at him, not as surprised as he expected them to be. There was a pause before Ron asked, “Is that all?”
“You’ve seriously never made your own pasta before?” Draco asked.
Harry shook his head. “Of course not. Let’s go.”
Hermione followed his gaze and let out a giggle. “Honestly, Harry, I don’t know how you were a seeker. You can be so oblivious.”
Harry heard the shower running when he woke up, so he headed to the kitchen. After a few tries, he managed to turn the stove on and put a pot of tea on. Humming to himself, he didn’t notice when the shower turned off.
“Draco, I- wait a minute, off limits? What does that even mean?”
“How so?” Draco asked.
Vivian jumped up from her seat.
He stood up and packed up his books and notes. He decided to walk home so he could stretch his legs. On the way, he stopped by the store to pick up ingredients for dinner.
“What about you?” Draco asked Harry. “Did you get back together with Weasley’s sister after it all went down?”
Before class began, Harry had been eavesdropping on other students’ conversations. From what he could tell, about two thirds of students had come straight from Hogwarts, or the wizarding school of their country. Harry was surprised by the number of American students present. The other third of students seemed to be adults who had worked for several years as arithmancers and had returned for further education.
“What? Oh, sorry ‘Mione,” Harry said.
“Perhaps,” he began. “What’s the rush, do you want someone else to move in? Aren’t you glad to have someone to split the rent with?”
“Not a chance,” Harry scoffed.
“Harry!”
Draco jumped and turned to face Harry. “I was, Potter. So, I’m going to pour myself a drink and go to my room, unless you have any further questions about my whereabouts.”
Harry glanced at the table to make sure Draco had thrown enough money on the table (he’d thrown more than enough down), transferred his drink as well, and followed Draco out the door.
Living with Draco, to his surprise, was actually quite tolerable. Draco was rarely home, and when he was home, he kept to himself. He was also quite tidy, something Harry couldn’t always say about Ron, and the flat was quite nice. Plus, Harry never walked in on Draco having sex with anyone, something else he couldn’t say about Ron and Hermione.
“She’s not a man.” Draco met Harry’s eyes.
At this, Draco sped up the thrusting and the stroking.
“Well, I’ll let you be on your way then,” she told him with a sly grin.
Dinner with Draco Malfoy.
“You alright, mate?” asked Ron. “Been a bit preoccupied lately, haven’t you been?”
“You know, I’m almost done, but another time maybe you can help.”
Draco stepped back hurriedly. “Of course, come in,’ he said with a wave.
He held up the book then went to his room. He closed the door behind him and laid down on his bed.
“Oh, really?” asked Harry.
After class, Harry made his way to the hallway with the arithmancy faculty members’ offices. He found the door labeled “Vivian Vixen.” It was partially open, and a short witch sat at the desk, reading over an ancient looking scroll.
Harry looked Draco, then back at the display. “Well, that apartment tour I went on the other day didn’t exactly go great,” he admitted.
“That’s a plant, right? Toxic, isn’t it?”
“You’re quite the tenant, Potter. I almost think I should be discounting your rent, I’ve had so many of your dinners.”
Harry cocked his head. “You know, I never really got the hang of needlepoint,” he said thoughtfully.
“Yeah, no worries, mate,” Ron said.
“What are you doing here?” she asked incredulously.
Harry held his breath. He liked where this was going, and he didn’t want to do anything that could interfere with Draco’s line of thinking.
Harry wondered.
“You’ve lived with them since Hogwarts then?” asked Draco.
“Well put on some clothes and let’s go to brunch,” she told him. “Is that mail?”
“Yes,” Harry confirmed.
“Well, if you want any tomorrow, I’m sure there will at least be some pizza.”
But Draco ignored him. The door closed loudly behind him.
Harry looked over and took in the sight of the smallest kitchen he had ever seen. There was a refrigerator, a sink, and an oven with virtually no counterspace.
Not knowing exactly what to say, Harry hugged her tighter.
Harry let out a sigh of relief as the vaguely familiar woman moved towards him. Two other witches, both blonde, followed her.
If Harry was being honest with himself, he hadn’t processed a word since Draco had come out of his room in just his pants. In fact, Harry had been trying to ignore a certain feeling in his own pants since Draco had walked out. A feeling that had only intensified since Draco had returned to his room, wet from the shower, only a towel wrapped around his waste.
Harry knocked on the doorframe. “Professor Vixen?” he asked, hesitantly.
Harry sat on the couch, book in hand, looking equally surprised.
“Pansy and I stopped in once. Anything more than five years old is considered an antique. I think I saw the complete collection of Lockhart’s writing in here.”
“I put some food in the pantry where there was room,” Harry said, “I hope you don’t mind.”
From the drawer he pulled out a small bottle of lube. As he applied the lube, he leaned over Harry’s back and bit his ear again.
Harry looked up at her. She seemed a little tipsy.
“Don’t gaslight me,” she drawled. “We know what we heard, don’t we,
The trio sat in silence for a moment.
Harry suddenly realized that he was blocking Draco’s path. And that Draco was standing rather close to him. In fact, if either of them took a step forward, they’d hit the other person. Harry locked eyes with Draco. For a moment, they were both frozen in place. Harry would have sworn that neither of them were breathing.
Draco considered the offer. “Well, I suppose it beats takeout...”
“An inquiry about my vacant room,” he told her.
Cindy and Cassie ogled Harry before looking back to Jeanine for leadership.
Harry sighed.
Harry spent the afternoon walking around the neighborhood. He made mental notes of each café, wanting to revisit each one for breakfast to try their croissants and other pastries.
“Keeping tabs on me, eh?” Draco asked. “I thought you gave that up in our sixth year.”
At the end of the street, there was a pet store that had opened within the last few years. The cat tree display was covered in plush cats. “Oh god,” said Harry when he saw them.
Maybe kissing Draco Malfoy wasn’t quite right. But ‘being kissed by Draco Malfoy’ felt accurate. Right?
Per usual, Harry was home before Draco that Friday night. Worn out from the week and wanting to unwind, Harry decided to try something new in the kitchen. He set to work measuring, kneading, cutting, and pinching. An hour later, he had covered all of the free counter space in homemade bowtie noodles.
“Of course,” she said with a nod.
Harry grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment and wrote out a quick response, asking if the room was still available and what the rent would be. He started to sign his name, but considered Hermione’s warning. To be safe, he signed it with just the letter H before sending it off with Ron’s owl.
Harry could tell it was no use trying to talk to Draco. “Fine. I’ll see you at the flat,” he said. He turned to go. He took one step towards the door then stopped at the sound of Draco’s voice.
They walked side-by-side in silence for a while, hands brushing occasionally. The shops were all closed, but under the light from the streetlamps they could still admire the displays in the storefront windows.
Harry knew he shouldn’t have been surprised that everyone he met already had established their living situation. They hadn’t applied to the program as late as him. In fact, they had probably all accepted their spots in the program before Harry had even sent in his application. Still, he was becoming more and more desperate to move out.
“Shove it, Malfoy,” Harry spat.
Holding hands with Draco Malfoy.
Harry rolled over, feeling dejected. It seemed that Draco didn’t feel the same way about Harry.
Harry had to admit to himself, he’d been struck by Draco. Not just physically. He’d realized eating his leftovers alone today just how much he had gotten used to their evening conversations.
“Um, I met with one person last week…” Harry trailed off.
There were really only two problems with living with Draco. The more obvious being that Draco wanted him to leave as soon as possible. He seemed to still think of Harry as his nemesis from their days at Hogwarts.
“What are you doing with a paper you can’t read?” asked Ron while he buttered a piece of toast.
“Is that so?”
“Um, I saw an advertisement for a roommate…” Harry trailed off. “That was… you?”
Having not taken a lunch to campus, Harry was starving by the time he arrived home. He unloaded his groceries and immediately set to work making dinner.
“Of course,” Hermione said, releasing Harry from her grip. “Come in! I want to hear all about your graduate program.”
“You can say that again.”
Draco furrowed his brow. “What’s that?”
He asked himself.
“A Slytherin never lets a door creak,” he replied.
“I’m fine, Potter, not that it’s any of your concern.”
he had really only asked Jeanine. But her reaction made him nervous to ask any of the other members of his class.
“As a matter of fact, my current flat is fairly close, but my situation is a bit temporary,” Harry admitted. “I’ve been meaning to ask around before class, but you wouldn’t happen to know if anyone in our program is still looking for a roommate, would you?” he asked her.
On Thursday, Harry left campus a bit earlier than normal to visit the apartment he had seen an advertisement for. Right at 5:00 pm, he knocked on the door of apartment 13D.
This time, Jeanine’s grin faltered.
“Whatever,” Harry muttered. He picked up his plate and headed to his room.
“I didn’t think it was nothing,” Harry replied.
Malfoy cocked his head, mulling it over. It would be nice to split rent, after all. “Well, what if you move in here, on a temporary basis. Once you make a different arrangement, you will leave.”
" really Zabini? The fucking Kitchen?" He yelled, flailing his other arm.
" what?" I asked, a little shocked.
3rd person POV
" alright then, malkins?" Draco suggests and we start to walk in that direction. When we walked in Madam Malkin swept over to us, her own robes flowing behind her.
" well.... lets run away." He told me. I looked at him, my face constricted in confusion.
" you're here." He breathed out. His voice was small and coarse. I felt my breath hitch and i could barely move.
" hey me and harry arent-"
" welcome home Master Zabini, and welcome Mr.Weasley."
" hey guys. Did you get your suits?" Hermione asked while pansy was looking at some new type of firecracker george had created.
" pffft."
" well n-no, b-but ye-" i was stammering, it was a little hard to explain.
Draco shivered and squirmed. Ron stifled a laugh which got a fuming glare from draco.
" what are you waiting for? Chop chop, we dont have all day." I clap my hands twice and motion for him to go change. Without hesitation he runs towards the stairs up to his room.
" dinner is served."
" WHAT?" Adam yelled loudly. I looked up at ron who shrugged.
" i dont believe it."
" all is good mother. Ronald and i are actually getting along quite nicely." I say as we sit down at the wooden table.
" i fell asleep here after you did. Guess you didnt want to let go."
" how did you know i drink tea?" Blaise asked me as he sat down next to harry
He pulled on his shirt and stuck out his hand. I nodded and left with him, heading to the great hall.
" wait i though it only teleported us if we you know... did it." I said confused.
" yes of course. And what do i have to do?"
" h-harry?"
" okay what the FUCK are you three doing here?" Blaise questioned again.
" of course blaise. Its my job." She chuckles lightly. We seperate and she gives a small smile to hermione before joining her on the bench.
" he doesn't like me-"
" oh hey. " ron said with a large smile, motioning us to come in. I returned it to him and walked into the apartment. Unlike the corridors and the outside, the inside was warm and cozy. Almost like it was wrapped in a blanket. There were floating candles all over the ceiling, book shelves filled one of the back walls, and the yellow light reflected off the gold detailing on the walls.
" promise?"
It was 9 pm. We were 4 hours into the party and the worst thing that could have ever happened to me just walked in through the door. Adam.
" come on loverboy. Why so salty?" Harry coos. I scoff and keep walking. When we enter we see pansy and hermione in an arm wrestling competition and blaise keeping rep.
I clear my throat and finally look back to see ron looking scared and blaise looking sympathetic.
" a few more minutes. I promise i'll let you go then" he mumbled in a low voice. I nodded and laid my head back down on his chest. If i could, i would live this moment forever.
" pine cones." I interupt.
" you dont have much time left."
He looked pale and sickly. His face was sunken in and he looked so drained. He looked like he was just sucked by a dementor.
" no draco tonight ?"
Harry's POV
I was in the shower. My muscles tensed at the warm water running down my body. It soothed me, and after the chaotic weeks ive been having, it was exactly what i needed. I let the warm water run through my hair and exhaled. Im gonna die from this. Im gonna die trying or im gonna die quitting. Either way i knew i didnt have much left. I had 3 months. Thats how much my healer gave me.
" i love you." He whispered.
———————————————————————
" nothing much dumbass, whats up with you?"
Now their manor looked like a home, replenished, renewed, reborn. They were finally moving in after a full year. They both had fulfilling careers. Draco as a healer and the director at the new hospital he opened just last year and harry was the defense against dark arts professor for the 2nd year now. After his first year, the curse of the D.A.D.A teacher only being able to last one year came in, but harry whined so much about losing the position that he forced hermione and blaise to work for weeks trying to find the counter-curse. Eventually they did, and now harry was going back this fall.
" what?"
I pulled away and nodded. Hermione sniffled and looked back at her.
" of course. What are friends/former enemies/fiancés for?" I chuckled. He laughed too before letting me go. Again, that feeling in my stomach started to bubble up again. I smiled and turned towards the door to send the patronus.
" i know."
" it leaves out his hair though. Makes it stick out." Harry commented from behind them. Draco nods in agreement.
" uhh how about now? I dont think they will really miss us at the moment." Zabini said turning back at me.  Shrugged and walked off.
" hello Buddy. Where is my mother?" Blaise asks him.
" 11 am."
I sobbed into his shoulder and grabbed the back of his shirt.
" okay. Ill stay. I'll just send a patronus real quick." I said turning back. He pulled onto my wrist and stood up. I looked back at him in confusion before he pulled me into a hug.
When he opened the door, hermione was holding a bottle of wine and pansy was holding a bottle of fire whiskey, smiling cheekily at her best friend.
" oh hes at work. Apparently he couldn't get the day off but he will be here to pick you guys up for Christmas." She nodded. Draco smiled at her and started a conversation.
Draco took a step closer.
" did it not work?" I asked madam Pomfrey. She shook her head.
" yeah, lavender." I muttered.
" i believe you have something to do?"
" in parseltongue."
" i have been kind of looking for a reason to break up with lav. Believe it or not she and i aren't really the best couple." I say the last sentence sarcastically. Blaise chuckled softly and looks back at me. We stare at each other for a short moment before i broke it.
" should we?"
We sat in comfortable silence as harry smoothed out his sheets, constantly blushing the entire time.
" okay okay, what happened?" Harry stared at me in a sleepy haze from the couch. It was 2 am in the morning and i was currently in the living room with harry and hermione. Hermione was trying to keep up and harry looked more confused than ever.
" hey, i got a letter from your mum. She wants us to have dinner with her. Thought you should know. Also come to grimmauld today before dinner. Bring draco with you, harry is whining.
" yeah, it sounds better than Zabini-Weasley."
Ron POV
" hold up. WHAT."
" you ruined my makeup and now my eyes are puffy."
" you know what, why dont you just get the surgery?"
I cleaned up and walked back into the library. Draco was still sitting there even after most everyone left. I sat next to him and rest my head on his shoulder.
" i do like him like that. Ive had a massive crush on him ever since 1st year. I rejected him last month because astoria kept following me around and my father was still alive. If i started dating a bloke then all of the pureblood families would know and i would be done for. I needed their support. At least until i was head of house and i became that. So now there is nothing stopping us from being together. Only him and his stupid ass not liking me back."
" i dont believe it. Your lying"
" why are you doing this?"
" hello. My my how big you have all gotten. I remember measuring you for your first year at hogwarts! Now how may i help you?" She clapped her hands and smiled.
" no. I did not." I said.
" i wont die pansy. Relax."
We had just finished dinner and were now eating dessert which was an elegant english trifle. We talked all night about various things. We even mentioned the wedding a few times but it was never a big discussion.
A few moments later hermione came rushing in.
The crack in his voice broke my heart. I shut my eyes as tight as i can and tightened my grip on his hand. He tightened it too.
I could have watched him sleep forever. The way his chest rose when he slept, the way his hands laid in his lap, the way his head fell back when he was tired or stressed. The way he smiled every time he saw his mother, as if he was a two year old. All these things i noticed as i fell harder and harder for him. I know he doesn't love me, i don't think he ever will. I'll always be a friend, then a husband. Platonic.
In the early stages of my disease, even a whiff of his cologne could send me choking. But now i learned to control it and it wasn't so often. Even if my condition worsened, my control increased. Its the only way i could keep it hidden for so long.
" kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!" The arena chants like they did for all the rest. Ron looks over to me, his face matching his hair.
Ron pulled out a black velvet box from the inside of his coat jacket. He opened it to reveal two wedding bands, one silver and one gold. They were engraved with the dates 26.02.1999, for obvious reasons.
" are you jealous?"
" oh! Thats called a kiss cam. Its magicked so that they only point towards people with chemistry between them. Normal muggle ones don't have those enchantments tho." He answers.
" morning"
I rested my hand on hers. She gave me a sad smile before nodding and walking off.
" well i dont see it that way Malfoy! Im doing you a favor by not gettting the surgery believe me. I dont know who i would be without them okay?"
" ok but just for now, lets not..... consummate as kingsley put it. But i think we should tell our partners about the agreement, see how they react." I said.
The infirmary was cold today. Ron and draco stopped visiting since last week. I heard that draco knew what happened to me and still chose not to come. I felt heartbroken, but you cant break something that is already broken.
" Malfoy harry-"
" how........ how did he get it?"
" i wouldnt mind that." Blaise whispered.
" how have you and ronald been doing? Are you two getting on well?" She said as we walked to the patio, where we always had lunch on Saturday afternoons. Some called us boujee, we say classy. I smiled softly at the thought of ron. Wait when had i started doing that?
" ronald! Tell us!" Harry demands. I laugh and look at them.
" yeah?" Blaise asks. Ron purses his lips and sighs.
The announcer yells. The arena chants even louder. Ron nervously rubs the back of his neck.
" fine."
" ready?" Blaise turned to me.
" so......... aren't you going to say it?" Harry asked. Draco was taken aback.
" why are you sad about that? You said you wanted a platonic-"
" dont worry blaise, i know you'll get him. I mean you already got him legally but, i know you will get his heart too. Just give it time." Pansy said, patting my chest.
" I understand perfectly well that you are concerned for your friend but Mr.Malfoy you need to get out-"
" so? he works there too."I asked, pulling my shoes on.
" huh. We are one lucky trio arent we?" Ron asked, swinging his arm around harry's shoulders.
Me, draco, blaise and ron were sitting in the bleachers, watching ravenclaw and hufflepuff practice. Unfortunately 8th years couldnt play quidditch anymore as it was an unfair advantage. So instead we would often watch the other houses play.
———————————————————————
" okay, i need to sit on you lovesac." Draco said before jumping towards it and landing in the bundle. Me and ron started bursting out laughing when harry walked in from the kitchen. He was too shirtless, and from the corner of my eye i could see draco squirm a little.
" he was supposed to be here. He was supposed to be the boy who lived." He said in a small voice. I shut my eyes closed.
" harry-"
" huh. New flowers."
" it wasnt your fault. Im just dying. There is nothing you can do."
I turned back at blaise who looked up at me with furrowed eyebrows.
Blaise POV
" hey!" Harry threw the pillow right back.
" we're getting married." He confirmed.
" okay i got you ice chips, juice, coffee, chocolate milk because you're a big baby, and also because i didnt know what to get. I also got you a breakfast sandwich. Sorry i took so long, the line in the cafeteria was horrendous, like 40 people in front of me-" blaise stopped his rambling when he set eyes on Cormac. He set down the coffee on the nightstand along with the other drinks and the sandwich. Blaise blinked twice, then put out a hand in front of him.
" im so sorry. Y-you're vulnerable right now. I shouldn't have done that, im so sorry."
I hummed a response and looked at her. She was in azkaban for about 3 months now.
" oh don't talk none sense. Call me Lorelei. " she brushes off the shoulders of my robes, much like Blaise.
My eyes widened as i jerked my head forward. She had a satisfied smile on her face.
" wait, you've got to wear your family crest, see?"  He points down to his own robes. There was a cobra snaked around a bold letter Z with gold ribbon banners that said 'Zabini'. I nodded and turned my body to him.
" oh just for you to try on a few robes is all." I said pushing the bag i was holding to his chest. He stumbled back a little and stared at me in confusion.
I waited in Blaises office. I sat on his office chair and looked over his desk. Blaise was an auror in my department so I recognized a lot of the cases laid out all over the large oak table. From downstairs i could hear yelling and i couldn't help but feel sorry. I am the reason why they are fighting.
I went to left, but he grabbed onto my wrist, spinning me back towards him. He connected our lips again and i closed my eyes. This one was sweeter, and longer. We pulled back and i stared into his eyes.
Draco just smiled fondly and brought the ring up to harrys face.
" ron?" Blaise waves his hand in front of my face.
A moment of silence.
Without thinking i slid into bed with him, bringing his blanket up to cover us both. I snaked my arms around his torso and dug my head into his shoulder, taking in his scent. He tensed at my touch, but relaxed soon enough.
Draco closed his eyes. He didnt know what he was saying, and at this moment he wanted nothing more than to know.
" i dont know. What do you want to do?" I ask in return. He looks away like he is thinking, then he turns back to be and smirks.
I picked up my razor that i use for shaving, popping out the blade. I stared at the shiny metal piece in my hand and stopped. For a second i hesitated, but thats all it was......... a second.
" ENOUGH!" Harry yelled. Draco and blaise froze, along with everyone else in the room.
" of course. What are friends for."
———————————————————————-
" same here mother." I say as we separate.
He looked at me like he was thinking. He turned around and faced the window, grabbing the edge of the window sill.
" thats still for minds you dense idiot! My body cant use occlumency!."
They stopped by the slytherin dorms for something and that something was 2 bottles of muggle whiskey pansy had managed to smuggle into her room. They were 1 bottle in and Blaise was asking draco now.
It was starting again. The coughing fits, the tiredness. After last night when i spoke to draco, i ended up coughing so violently i almost threw up a full flower.
" im afraid this still isnt enough. Does anyone by chance have the same blood type as him?"
" nothing. You go on like u used to. If anything develops, so let it be." Hermione stated, being the voice of reason. I sat down on the ottoman opposite of the couch. I have been having this feeling, like butterflies in my stomach every time i think of blaise, for a while now. Maybe i....
I sighed and threw the letter on my desk. Eris cooed and stepped closer to me. I handed her a treat from the little dish sitting on the corner of my desk and scratched under her wing. She made a little happy 'hoot' and left to do what i presume , is hunting.
" oh no its fine." I walked over to the cabinet to get another mug and filled it with tea, sliding it over to blaise.
I turn back to see rons horrified face...... and blaises behind him.
" a dog is a perfectly good patronus!"
" no no no. Lets just have a day full of fun things. It'll be a nice way of relaxing. It will be like our first little platonic fiancé date." He explains. As i grab a water bottle from the fridge i think about it. It would be a nice way to wind down.
" thank you buddy."
I started choking on the flowers again, and still nothing came up. I could barely breathe and the few times i managed to get a wiff of air wasn't enough.
" i told you!"
" you truly love him? If you dont there is an even bigger risk of him dying you know that?"
" dont fucking say that. We may still have a chance-"
A key memory was me and blaise. Our quidditch games, us helping harry, me waking up in his room, chess matches, and our first kiss.
" no Ms.Pomfrey. Its alright. You didnt know so how could you have helped me? Im okay. No need to apologize."
" ron!"
I came back home after Ron and I's little coffee date. Adam was sitting on the settee as always when i come home and he looked up at me in delight. I sat down next to him and rested my head on his shoulder. I relaxed into his warmth as he encircled his arms around my waist. I breathed in his cologne and sighed. I would miss him, i really do like him. Too bad i cant truly be with him.
" are you all packed?"
" yes."
" what? Oh no! No no. Me and her were never really..... a thing." I say awkwardly. She just nods and sighs
" umm okay. But i have my money bet on pansy." I said and sat down across them.
" fine fine. I got the rings."
" ok. Ill marry you." He turned around and faced me. A big smile broke out on my face and i ran over to him, picking him up in a hug. He laughed as i spun him around and dropped him back on the ground. I kissed him again and kept smiling.
" goodnight, blaise." He whispered before turning off the light and walking out. What he didnt see was Blaise Zabini's eyes opening a few monents after ron closed the door.
" so ready to be the happy engaged couple in front of my entire family?" He teased. I laughed and looked right at him.
" and you want me to marry you?"
He flipped a page. I groaned again and fell back onto my bed.
" you fucking asshole."
He pressed his forehead against mine and we smiled.
" you know. To such a horrible day, you made it better. You always do."
" i love you. Im glad i finally got you." Blaise turned to me, as harry and Pansy argue about whether Hermione cheated at monopoly.
What did he mean by that? Does he like me? Does he love me- No. dont get carried away.
Making draco malfoy his.
" draco what is it- woah WOAH."
" hey. What are you thinking about?" Ron snapped harry out of his thoughts.
" you didn't do this. It was our stupid family, over a century ago." He whispered.
" morning."
" its okay."
" oh. Sorry." I said in english.draco finally calmed down and sat still.
" okay?"
" now stand on the stage and ill take your measurements, it will only be a minute." She flicked her wand and a measuring tape flew towards ron. He lifted his arms while the tape started measuring his waist and chest. I took a seat opposite if him, watching the tape flow around his body.
" awwwww." She says before hugging us both, hermione soon joining. Harry and Draco give each other a peck and look at us. When they step away from us we stay still. Our foreheads connected.
I didnt want to know the answer. I couldn't bare the thought of a world without harry. But i knew that if i didnt ask, i would regret it for the rest of my life.
" 5 pm to midnight. We need to arrive at the manor an hour early to get ready there. Its just easier." Blaise shrugs.
" he slept in my room."He balled his fists.
—————
" thats for minds you dumb fuck."
Harry looked around them for a second. He was surrounded by the people he loved, going to the place he called a second home. He had children with the love of his life when just 20 years ago, he was dying because he thought draco would never love him back. His friends were all also happy and had children of their own.
3rd person~
" im sorry."
" yes."
Draco just looked at him and smiled. Harry looked down and saw the little box draco was holding. Suddenly a wave of guilt washed over him.
" i dont know. But........ we're happy. Thats all that counts." She sad quietly.
I need to find Ron
" nowhere. Why do you ask?"
" MADAM POMFREY!"
" ugh im tired. Must we study?" Pansy whined.
" there ALWAYS IS! "
My throat closed up and blood came from my nose. I fell to the floor, coughing up air. The petals weren't coming out. They were blocked and i couldn't breathe.
With blaise...
" hey ron. How you doing?"
Dracos POV
" him." I look back at Draco and blink. He nods in confirmation.
" okay. Have fun. Ill get you later." I say and wave goodbye. He kisses my cheek and pulls away. I feel heat rising to my face and i quickly run off to find Hermione.
I stood up, careful to not make any noise. I walked to the bathroom and turned on the lights. I squinted at the sudden brightness of the room and proceeded to walk towards the sink. I kept most of my things here now, since I'm gonna be here literally until the day i die.
Draco flinched violently as he jerked away from the books and fell down from surprise.
" you're awake!" She smiled and hugged me tight. I smiled and waved at ron who waved back sadly.
" its the crest of the Weasley Viking clan. A large 'W' with gold vines and thorns wrapped around it. A sword and axe in the background creating an 'X'" Blaise nods and with the flick of a wrist, my family crest is imprinted in the black satin fabric.
" of course. Lets go." Draco kissed his cheek and grabbed his arm. All four of them apparated to platform 9 3/4.
" stay. Please. Just... its the first time ill be alone in a while and i dont want to bother Pansy or Draco." He said solemnly. I stared at him for a moment before nodding.
" what? Why? This could save harry!"
" ah so you admit you are blocking the veritaserum?"
She looked up at me. I could see the sadness swirling in her eyes. I could see how she didnt want to answer, how she didnt want to believe it. She looked up at the ceiling and swallowed hard.
" you three, out."
We arrive at the leaky cauldron. We see the golden trio sitting in a corner booth with 6 pints of butterbeer. We walk on over and pansy gives hermione a soft kiss. Wish i could do that.
I hesitated on telling her.
" i love you. You love me. Marry me." I said simply. His eyes widened even more and he stood up, pacing around the room.
" oh."
There was silence again.
Ive been beside harrys bed for three days now. I sleep in the infirmary on a bed next to him, i wake up before him so he doesnt have to feel lonely, and after school i bring his homework. It was our routine.
Ron POV
I looked up and faced draco who just looked frozen.
" you should take better care of yourself. I don't know who i would sit on the couch with in the library every Friday without you." He whispered. I felt the petals come up again.
" s-shh. It will be f-fine." My voice betrayed my words. Sobs escaped my mouth involuntarily.
" hey dray. You coming?"
" fine then. Your just good at defending. Now. What is it?"
" how do you know so much about muggle technology?"
Nevilles voice rung into the room.
" i should take her to the dungeons." Blaise stumbled over to her. He almost fell but ron caught him before he did.
I flinched. I turned around and saw draco leaning against the wall and looking at me. I exhaled in relief and closed my eyes, leaning against the window sill for support.
" are you trying to like court me or something? Because im like a potter? Or because you almost killed me, because i have also almost killed you too."
" draco i almost just died!"
" oh shut up, you know you will end up together." Pansy spat. Draco nodded and looked down at his shoes, a small smile still evident on his face.
" so what were you and ron talking about?" Harry asked as they were washing the dishes. Harry handed draco a plate which draco took and started to dry.
I waited until his breathing evened. I waited until his eyes fluttered closed and i was absolutely sure he wasn't awake.
" of course ill marry you."
" shh ron. Its alright. Im going to be okay." Harry hugged his best friend, the tears still evident on his face.
" stop ronald, you obviously dont feel the same. Dont act like you do because you-"
" oh nothing. Just stuff."
" dont you have classes?"
" and what do you suggest we do in the meantime? Besides your little pillow fight?" Blaise asked.
I know if i asked you, you would refuse or ask why. So i thought, why don't i just ask Ronald? Im sorry if this discomforts you, but i must say, Ronald is a very nice boy from the letters we've sent each other. I definitely like him better than Adam. Any whoo, ill see you at dinner in the Zabini Manor at 8 dear. Have a good afternoon.
" okay WHY ARE ALL THREE OF YOU HERE?" Blaise yelled.  Cormac and lavender behind me, adam ready to throw punches again.
A/N: sorry its short
" just answer the question Harry."
Hermione pulled back and faced me, tears in her eyes. She sat down on the chair next to the bed, looking down at her hands. I knew what she was gonna say. I know why she was so sad. I looked up at the ceiling and let out a shaky breath.
" thank you mother." I whispered. There was a moment of silence before it was broken.
" guess what-" he started but it seemed like he ran out of air.
" and i said no. When i did he became furious. He grabbed m-my a-arm and..." i drifted into sobs. He hugged me and rubbed circles on my bad.
" why are you here?"
" we went to the game."
" okay, on your mark. 1....2.....3....go!" Blaise slapped the table and the the girls started arm wrestling. In the end, as I predicted, pansy won.
" wow, you sure like having a place to sit dont you?" I turn to ron who was drying his hair.
Ron POV
" umm what is happening?" Adam said. Poor thing looked so confused.
" so you're smitten for me?"
" would you stop that." I snapped at ron who immediately stopped his leg.
" THIS IS SO GREAT! The golden trio and the slytherin trio get together!" Pansy squealed.
" well. Astoria greengrass will never get dracos love. He isnt into girls."
I stood in front of the door for a few seconds before opening it and making my way to harry.
" yes. I did. My cold still hasn't quite gone away. The doctor thinks its strep throat." I lied through my teeth. Draco brought a hand to my face, caressing my cheek gently. Heat started to rise up my neck and my ears.
" if this is your way if asking me out, it is lousy."
" anyway, are you dating anyone?" I ask. He nods yet again after taking another sip of his tea.
He shoved me off and stalked up to gryffindor tower.
" A-adam dont do this-"
I gestured towards out entangled hands. He blushed and jerked his hand back but i grabbed onto it. He looked up at me in surprise but i just kept a straight face, tracing circles on the back of his hand.
" The minister of magic. My family made it over a century ago." I said. He let out a frustrated sigh, obviously stressed.
" this is bloody horrible." I groaned.
" i know."
" how is this going to work? Are we going to break up with them? Do we move in together? Do we start a relationship?" I ask. Blaise furrows his eyebrows and shrugs.
" yes right now. Come on lets go!" He says yanking me towards the door. I sigh in defeat and grab my keys before being rushed out the door.
" WHAT? You are getting married to that SNAKE? Hes a DEATH EATER RON! This wont work out. He will break your heart and you will come crawling back to me. They ALWAYS do." Cormac paced around the room in anger. Blaise stood up and towered over Cormac. Cormac was 5'7, Blaise was 6'2.
A/N: i know this is super short but i rlly wanted to end it on this adorable note so yeah. I will write more next chapter.
" fuck off." Draco pushed blaise away and brought his knees to his chest.
" you too dear. Well it was great having dinner with you darlings. Ill see you at the engagement party next week." She moves over to blaise and kisses his cheek.
" ow!" He complained.
" so. How is Blaise?" Adam asked me, holding a champagne flute.
" oh right. Sorry haha." Blaise laughed. The four walked out the room, leaving harry and draco alone.
———————————————————————
" there isnt a point ron."
" and ill escort you there. Mione?"
" okay. Just out of curiosity, are you gay?" Blaise asked. I shook my head.
" how is this my fault!?"
I glared at him as he smirked condescendingly.
" of course, your brothers. It will be fun meeting my fiancé's 5 completely overprotective older brothers huh?" He jokes and turns to have a conversation with pansy. Harry stood up and tapped me on the shoulder, signaling me to follow. I followed him out of the kitchen and into the corridor.
Harry stopped as he was past the doorway.
" oh shut it weasley. We all know you are smitten for him. I can see it in your face."
I heard madam Pomfrey start to yell again before i went unconscious.
" no you don't understand-"
I ran to his side and looked down at my best friend. His shaggy black hair was a mess and his face and chest had trails of blood on them. But other than the horrible condition he was in, he looked almost.... peaceful. Like he was dreaming something nice.
" ok but if we are doing it id rather not do it in the middle of the library." Draco sighed.
" hold on a second."
" you can use legilimency to see if im lying if you'd like."
" ron. We're here." Blaise tapped my shoulder. I snapped my head towards the door and burst through it. I ran towards harrys section and came face to face with Harry...... still unconscious.
" no. I promised him 5 years. No more, no less. I cant break that." Draco responded. Ron nodded understandingly and walked with him to the dining room where harry was plating dinner.
" at least they stayed the night together."
Blaise and draco bickered back and forth.
She came over and hugged us both. After her everyone got a turn. Harry got a punch from ginny, a plant from neville and i got a very proud stare from blaise.
" sorry love. Got to help out my friend." And he walked away from both of them, ron still leaning his entire side against pansy who was looking very annoyed. Ron blushed deeply by the nickname blaise gave him and pansy snorted.
I was wearing a maroon robe with black panels and gold detailing. I liked this one quite a bit.
" please. There must be something to stop the pain."
" okay then."
" ron." I check, to make sure he is really asleep. I look up at his face, his ginger lashes curled up perfectly in place. I lean up to his forehead and place a soft kiss on it. I lean back into his chest and rest my head on it.
Rons shuddered breath brought me back. My friend, my BEST friend, Who ive never seen so vulnerable, was weeping at the thought of me dying.
" oh um... no its nothing. Ill tell you later." I force a smile. He shrugs and nods.
My condition was getting worse. The more i stayed with draco, the more painful the coughs became. My throat was constantly hurting and my lungs burned. But the time i spent with him gave me so much joy i couldn't leave.
" splinched. I didn't even know until he fell down." I grab my scarf and tie it around his arm to stop the bleeding.
Blaise POV
Draco looked confused as hell. I reached for ron to tell him but it was too late.
Blaise POV
" wait no. Not exactly. Well not legally or technically. Its complicated." I stammered out. anyone in our situation would have agreed, it was difficult to explain.
" um no. No we broke up." Cormac raised and eyebrow at this and nodded.
" the red looks quite good."
He laughed and walked over to me. He wrapped his arms around my waist and sighed while resting his chin on my head. A light pink dusted my cheeks while he continued to hug me. He swayed from side to side, taking me along with him. It was peaceful, until we were interrupted.
Blaise POV
" then tell me your real kink!"
" awww did i hurt malfoys feelings?" Harry pouted then broke into laughter. He gave dracos arm a little push and knocked on the door. Draco shook his head but he had a wide grin on his face.
" to get you breakfast you moron!" He yelled from the hallway. Draco was doubled over, leaning on the footboard if my hospital bed while i was still wheezing. Draco wiles a tear from his face and turns to me.
" why are you smiling?" I asked. He shook his head and look down before turning back up again.
" i told you!"
" HARRY!"
Harry stood up and pinned draco to the wall.
" hmm, those robes are a little short on you. No problem." Blaise said before taking out his wand and flicking his wrist. The robes extended and tailored themselves to fit me perfectly. I noticed the suit had done the same and  it was a lot more comfortable than before.
I blurted out. Hermione dropped the bottle of potion she was holding and gasped. Madam Pomfrey looked at me in shock and then turned to hermione.
When i heard the news my blood ran cold. I knew harry was having a tough time but i never thought he would.....
Draco smiled and nodded while taking both bottles.
" actually no. Apparently we are going to study tomorrow." Hermione explained.
" we are looking for new suits for Ronald here." Draco told her, looking around the store.
" anyway. You were splinched. You had some internal bleeding but we got it covered before you lost too much blood." I nod as he explains the procedures and what i was treated with.
He didn't think much of it, i told him i got a cold. I avoided him best i could for the next two days, because any time i saw him do anything, my beloved lungs would throw a tantrum.
"Pffft. Of who? Ron? Just because he has a caring fiance and he is talking to MY boyfriend about stuff I apparently cant know about? No, of course not." Harry passive aggressively walked away to start wiping the table.
" expecto patronum!"
16 years later
The rest of the time we mostly just sat around harry, playing board games, talking, everything. We didn't tell them yet but we would tell them later. After all, we still had 5 years.
He turned around and faced me, looking into my eyes.
" what the hell Adam!?!" Blaise yelled, wide eyed and mad. I turned back, ready to connect my fist to his face when harry held me back.
" ive missed you." He whispered into my ear. It sent a shiver down my spine, and not in the good kind.
After McGonagal was informed of my condition, she allowed me to stay in a private room with ron rather than out normal 5 person dorm. My condition was worsening, and the only relief i got was when i was with draco.
I was too busy smiling at the "love" part to even realize what the rest of the letter said. My mother sent a letter to him? Why didnt she just send me one? I got a piece of parchment and a quill from my nightstand. I quickly wrote a letter to her asking why she invited ron over. I ran to my office to get a wax seal and to give it to my eagle-owl , Eris. I attached it to her leg and sent her off. It wasnt until 2 hours later when i got a response.
I was running to the infirmary. I heard from neville that harry went to the hospital. I rushed down there as fast as i can, but i stopped when ron came running out of the doors.
When i got down blaise looked me up and down, then smiled. My heart was doing summersaults.
" so, what is the agenda for today?" He asks.
" harry if this will save your life-"
" i never knew." He chuckles.
" if looks good, but too gryffindor. I mean we are meeting my mother, not going to a class reunion." Blaise dusts off the imaginary dust off my shoulders and fixes some of the buttons.
" shut up there isnt any cuts there. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why did you think doing that was fine?"
" okay hun. Ive got your measurements, now choose a design and i will create a suit for you." Madam malkins stated and ron walked off the stage.
" a mixture of Motherly love and a strong hand. Thats all." I answer, going to the kitchen to get a glass of water.
" ready to apparate?" Blaise turned to me. I nod in confirmation. He holds on tighter, i glanced over to him and for a second, just one moment, seeing his face lit by the moonlight, seeing him smile at me, I forgot everything. This only lasts for a second until  we were being warped to our destination. His face was gone, but i felt his touch. Suddenly, a sharp pain went through my stomach.
" okay but otters are cute!"
" i like Ronald weasley."
Ron sighed and looked at me. He paused at my question.
" ok now you are just doing it to embarrass me."
" horned serpent huh?" Hermione asked after pomfrey left and we were all sitting down by harrys bed. Blaise and i were holding hands, one in his and the other in harrys.
" hmmm. What do you think about the blue?" Blaise asks once again.
" im not sure it would be a good idea."
I was wearing black robes with small gold detailing. This one actually looked pretty good.
" what?" He finally squeaks out. I dont wait to respond. Instead i pull him closer and connect our lips. He gasps slightly before closing his eyes and kissing me back. The people around us gasp and 'awwww'. We finally pull away to see Draco, Hermione, Pansy, harry and the three heathens standing there.
" we are here because of a contract we found, it was made between the Zabini family and Weasley family a century ago. As for those 4, well i don't know what they are doing here as it doesn't concern them." Kingsley said looking over at the couches. Harry and draco nervously laughed while Pansy and Hermione seemed to be having quite an interesting conversation as they didn't even look up. Kingsley cleared his throat and put his attention back to us. I was still waiting for an answer and blaise was fidgeting with his fingers.
" im going to leave you two be." Draco waves me goodbye and slides out the door before i could even protest. Cormac nods and sits down on the chair that once was occupied by Blaise.
" wha- why-?"
I woke up to a patronus from Ron. His little terrier danced around my room before giving me the message.
Draco POV
Adam had trapped me, the smart git. I was talking to fred and then he approached me. Fred the idiot just tapped my shoulder and said ' talk to your friend' and left to go talk to bill.
" no worries. Like you said, today was just a platonic fiancé date.... right?" I cut him off, rather sad. He visibly gulps and smiles.
" no. You'll just block it!"
" because, harry was being whiny." I turned to him and gave him a smirk. I could see slight redness moving up to his cheeks but i decided not to pest him today.
" is this a weird pureblood tradition or something?"
" you wanna see how great a jack russel can be? Here ill show you."
" its ok. But i will say, i am glad i am not sharing a cell with your auntie bella. She was a nightmare to room with."
———————————————————————
" it will keep you from dying!"
" i got the goods." He whispered into draco's ear. Draco cringed and punched his arm.
" zabini"
I flinched at the the mention of my last name. Harry hasn't called me that in months.
" i love you too Weasley." He whispers back. Lavender runs off in a huff. Pansy comes up to me.
" and harry would make an excellent son-in-law. You've got a good one."
" so this could be the only way to save you."
" wow." Hermione sat back down on the couch. Harry followed pursuit.
" no. I cant. Im afraid of what will happen if i see him. Hes the reason why my best friend is dying. Him and his cowardliness is killing my best friend."
Draco was extremely happy now. Even though they were young, just barely 24, they had been able to work their life together. Draco turned 24 2 months ago and Harry's birthday was just last month.
" Hello dear,
" My lord harry! Get him on the bed now!"
He turned towards the table. I laughed and did the same.
" are they?"
" do you want to know what we were talking about?" Draco asked calmly, rather amused of his boyfriend's jealousy over such a trivial thing.
" it means we get married, you idiot" blaise snarled. I scowled at this and put the piece of paper back.
" yeah......... yeah he would."
I huddled up in my pile of blankets and tried to get warm. But nothing i was doing seemed to help.
__________________________________________
" just a few more moments."
" hey mom."
" no. No im not. Im really in love with him." I say, looking over Harry's shoulder and over to blaise.
Rons POV
" oh and tell Ronald i want to meet him!" She yells right as i apparate. I apparated into my living room and almost jumped out of my skin when i saw Weasley standing by the kitchen island.
" ok." Blaise nodded and pulled out his wand. He muttered the spell and a wisp of blue came out. It morphed into a horned serpent and soon slid out of the room after blaise gave it its message.
" lavender? Lavender as in the lavender who was obsessed with you lavender?" Blaise asked in shocked amusement. I blushed a little harder.
" what?" He looked up at me with confusion.
She nodded and was escorted back to her cell. I stood in that room for about 30 more minutes just thinking.
I shook his shoulders but he sat emotionless.
We soon arrived at the little muggle shop i always got my morning coffee from.
" if there is a chance it will save you, then yes"
When he pulled back, the sudden realization hit me. I had just kissed him, and his best friend was dying.
" street knowledge." I corrected.
" language Mister Zabini. Now, we have special rings you must wear, if you two are to..... ummm... consummate.... with anyone else. You will immediately be teleported to eachother. So i suggest you be.... careful." Kingsley said, very obviously uncomfortable. I let out a sigh and leaned back in my chair.
Eventually it stopped and he motioned to the potion beside his bed. I quickly grabbed it, uncorking it and helping harry drink it. He must have felt better because he immediately sighed in relieve after.
Harry shook his head. “No, just looking for someone.”
“I suppose it is,” Harry managed to say.
Just thinking it made Harry feel silly. Of course, Draco wasn’t interest in him. They had been enemies. They’d fought on opposite side of a war.
“Are you lost, Harry?” Vivian called.
Draco continue speaking. “You know, Potter, you can keep living with me for a while, if you’d like. So long as you keep paying rent on time and all that.”
" shit. You werent lying." Blaise suddenly muttered.
" piss off." I walk off back into the kitchen.
" oh shove off. Stupid smitten redhead." Pansy muttered under her breathe as she walked off and laid next to hermione, putting her head in her lap just like she did for Draco.
" yes now shove off weasley. Im trying to sleep." Draco grumbled.
He brought his hands up and ran them through my hair as i leaned forward and deepened the kiss. He pulled back and smiled at me wide.
I proceeded to walk away from harry. I opened the infirmary curtains when he grabbed my wrist.
His arms lounged on my body while he rested his head on my arm. He looked so peaceful when asleep.
" oh im sorry, harry, Hermione and i were exhausted when we filled it out. I'll fill it out now-"
" piss off."
" what are you doing?"
A pause.
Me, hermione and blaise were running down to the infirmary. Pomfrey called McGonagal this morning, informing her that she had found harry in the bathroom unconscious and bleeding.
" what's happening?" Harry and i ask simultaneously.
" yes." I whispered before we both got up and walked to the kitchen. He had already made dinner which was always a nice surprise to come back to. We sat down at the kitchen island and ate our dinner. We talked while eating and in no time we were both done. I grabbed our plates and set them in the sink to wash them. I started running the tap and grabbed the sponge.
" okay then, single."
" ronald, sweetie. What are you saying?" Hermione asks cautiously.
" what?" He blinked.
" send him a patronus. See if he is willing to give his blood."
" why do you think i dont mind sitting with him? Sharing a scarf? Cuddling, sleeping, spending the night in his room. Helping him in potions, hanging out with his friends. Its all because of him. It doesn't help that i get aroused by the secret language he speaks too." Draco laid his head on the table.
" thank you." I whisper into her ear.
" um yeah but also because some of his personal info was missing." Mclaggen had reached out and shook his hand.
After I broke up with Adam, me and ron started spending a lot of time together. It may have had to do with the fact that Hermione and Pansy were now officially dating but still. This made the whole fiancé thing so much easier and it was a lot more fun this way.
I mouth the words  ' i win' and kiss blaises cheek. Blaise turns to me and smiles.
" i agree. You arent going to die from this. We will make draco realise how much he likes you."
" tsk tsk tsk. You dumbasses. Anyway, we might need some help. Lavender, cormac and Adam are here . "
I woke up in a hospital room. I felt disoriented, then i realized someone was holding my hand. I turn my head over, wincing as doing so. There Blaise was, holding my hand in both of his. He was asleep, he looked exhausted. His dress shirt was unbuttoned and disheveled, his shoulders slumped down but his grip on my hand was surprisingly firm. I smile at the scene before me, rubbing small circles on the back of his hand.
" okay." I swallow as he takes out a pen and starts writing. I really hipe blaise cones quicker. Please come back soon.
It was faint, but i could still hear it so clearly. He reached for my hand and grasped it tight and smiled.
He placed his face in his hands and just stood there.
" this is a disaster." Ron grunts. Blaise whips around and puts up his index fingers.
" yeah. And when i left the doorstep, he kissed my cheek." I say. My hands were on my hips and i was jumping on my feet. I couldnt stay still, how could i? Blaise KISSED ME!
" it would be fun, wouldn't it honey?" I teased. He blinked a few times before turning back to his mother and smiling.
" dont worry ron, you'll get him. Just like harry will get Draco." Hermione smiles. I chuckle as harry gets so red it would put my hair to shame.
He heard draco groan out in annoyance. Harry smiled and let out a chuckle
" i broke up with him." Blaise broke the silence.
" you know, i think i can really fall for you blaise zabini. Really." Ron said before walking to the door. He turned back one last time.
" so, transfiguration. Anyone got their notes?" Draco asked as he grabbed a book and handed it to harry who was practically falling asleep.
" YES!"
" 1 week."
" okay ambulance will be here-" there was a pop.
" anything?"
" Blaise-"
Orchid was 16, a year above them and james was 15.
" yes please." Draco said and dropped the book back onto the desk, effectively waking up harry with a start.
The room fell silent. I stood up to interact with my new patronus. I touched the tip of its nose and it snaked itself around me, reminding me of happy memories.
Draco scoffed and smirked.
the couch was a large white 'L' shaped settee with what looked like a million different throw pillows, 4 blankets and a book which i am assuming is Hermione's. The was really big, considering only 3 people live here. There was a glass and gold coffee table resting on a red rug in the center of the room. The living room was huge, way bigger than you would think. There were bean bags, ottomans and other places to sit littering all over the sides of the room.
" wha- no. Just because i am getting married doesn't mean i am going to run away and leave my family, my friends. My FIANCE? You know the other person in this situation." I said flailing my arms much like the redhead.
We stayed like that for a solid minute before madam Pomfrey cleared her throat.
I woke up with a jolt from my alarm clock. I turned towards the nightstand to see the device flashing 9 o'clock in bright bold numbers. I remembered i had to meet Kingsley today so I groaned and sat up on my bed, propping myself on my elbows. I stood up and looked out the window of Grimmauld place. Harry ,Hermione and i had moved in together after school ended, about 5 years ago.
" won won, you dont love him do you? I mean, there is no way you can love a snake like him!" Lavender shrieked.
Doubled over, trying to catch their breathe. I figured what this would probably be about so i shook my head and continued to pull the shirt i was holding over my head. Harry finally stopped panting and looked up at me.
" what does this mean?" I asked, even though i knew the answer.
" if you haven't noticed, he already is. Now, put on a shirt before dear Draco here dies of a heart attack." I wave my hand to him. Harry looked back at me like he was going to say something but when i stared back at him, he quickly shut up.
" YES!" I yelled. He sighed and looked up at me.
" yes father." Lilly said and accio'd her and everyone's bags from upstairs.
" time to go back." The guard said from behind my mother. She looked back at the door and sighed.
1 hour ago~
" do not DARE tell him." I yelled.
I slid down the sink and laid my head down on my knees. I felt the blood from my arms trickle down my hand and past my fingertips. Droplets of blood turned to pools and eventually i could barely see. I reached for my wand, already regretting what i had done but realized i left it by my night stand. My blood loss made me dizzy and i collapsed to the floor.
" an engagement party? Mother i dont think-"
" what?" I ask, shaking my head.
" yeah. He spent the night at my house, be appeared in my office late at night." His anger continued
We spent the entire day at the arcade, movie theater, the park, roller coasters and so much more. We finished off the night by going to a quidditch game that happen to be playing that night. Chudley canons vs. Holyhead Harpies. We got pretty good tickets for being so last minute. As we sat down i saw a rather large screen propped up above the arena.
" WHAT!"
" GO GET HERMIONE!"
" arent you going to ask me?" Harry asked a little more shy this time.
" im scared. I cant live without him. Hes my best friend. He was supposed to be my best man at my wedding. He was supposed to teach my kids how to fly, he was supposed to help me when i became an auror. He was supposed to-"
I woke up to the sun shining in my face. The curtains were pulled back a little and a beam of light was passing through.
" anything of interest happen today?" He asked. I hesitated before answering.
" oh hermione thinks that she can beat pansy because she has better upper body and core muscles and also because she has been fighting with you two since she was 11, but pansy thinks she can beat her because she is determined." Blaise nods and goes back to the two girls.
Harry walked off from them, turning to hermione and ron.
Glowing wisps of magic flowed around me, engulfing me in it.
Thats when it started. The coughing. Harry started hacking up petals and blood. I quickly went to Pomfrey's station and grabbed a clean bucket. I held it to Harry's mouth as the petals fell in and rubbed circles in his back to soothe him.
We stayed there for a few seconds, our foreheads together.
She gestured towards harry who was sprawled out on the hospital bed. I walked over to him and sat down on his bed. He was unconscious, like most times i did this. I took off his ventilator mask and hesitated.
" i agree." Blaise said nodding in agreement. We talked for quite a bit before departing. We talked about little things like quidditch, work, friends, coworkers, school. And soon it was dark outside and it was time for us to go home. I waved him goodbye as we left in different directions. I walked back home in peace. Maybe this wont be so bad. I mean it could be worse. I could be engaged to someone like, i dont know, Mclaggen.
“It seems your pants are in my way,” Harry uttered in a low voice.
“He does, I think he’s a genius.”
Harry turned away from Draco to fix up the dinner and, in all honesty, hide the blush on his face.
While Ron finished making dinner (his signature pasta bake), Hermione bombarded Harry with questions about school. She demanded to know everything about his courses, the faculty, his classmates, and the type of work he was starting in his practical studies.
Harry nodded along. “What are the compounds?”
“Yes, actually,” he admitted.
After Harry’s meeting with Vivian and Sara, he attended his second lecture of the day before heading home. With his, or rather Draco’s flat, being fairly close to campus, he decided to walk home. On his way, he passed a café which reminded him he still needed to go to the store. He made a small detour to pick up some pantry staples before heading home.
The thought of combining his practical studies in arithmancy with potions was a bit daunting. Harry didn’t feel that he had very much from Snape or Slughorn, and whatever he had known at the time he had surely forgotten. Still, the point of the practical component of his studies was to learn something new, and push the boundaries of what was already known, and this project would certainly do that.
“That she’s not my type.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. Harry shrugged.
It was nearly seven when he pulled the cake from the oven. He let it sit on the counter for an hour, the rich chocolatey aroma filling the kitchen, before he moved it to the refrigerator. While the cake chilled, Harry ate his dinner then began pacing around the flat.
“Draco, I don’t know how to make it clearer. Every day I spend living with your drives me crazy. And if you want me to leave, I will, but I bloody hope you reconsider.”
It was almost nine when Draco got home on Monday night. Harry was in his room, reading an arithmancy book Hermione had recommended after dinner the other night. He got up and headed to the kitchen to get himself a glass of water.
“Harry, nice to see you,” she smiled warmly.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t mind. I like to cook.”
“Speaking of which. You should keep looking for a more suitable housing arrangement for yourself.”
“You can have some if you’d like,” Harry offered.
“I know, I was actually flipping through your old textbook, the one you had on the bookcase in the den. It intrigued me, so I ended up reading the entire thing.”
“I had leftovers again tonight, they’re in the refrigerator if you want any. It’s nothing fancy, just some pizza and salad.”
Harry tried to put it nicely. “Well, for starters, the man was… not at all socially adept.”
Harry laughed. “Right you are. Now come on, the best man can’t be late.”
“Thought I’d head to one of the cafes on the next block before I do some homework.” He hesitated. “Er, would you care to join me?”
Harry turned to look at Draco.
“Wake up, Potter,” a voice murmured in Harry’s ear.
Harry had been expecting more of a reaction.
The sleepless night set Harry up for a groggy morning, which faded into an unproductive afternoon. Around five, Harry accepted he wasn’t getting any work done for the day and packed his bag. He was about the apparate home, when he decided he fancied a walk. He thought he’d like to stop by a store on the way home so he could bake something that evening.
“Yes, thank you again for considering me even though I was past the deadline,” Harry said.
Harry couldn't believe it. All week, Draco had barely said two words to him, and now they were sitting together talking about relationships? Harry wondered if he was dreaming again. The entire thing seemed surreal.
“That’s nice,” Hermione nodded. Harry waited for a follow up question; Hermione was usually one to press him for all details. But she simply started drying the dishes Harry had already washed.
Hermione chattered on excitedly about the proposal and wedding plans throughout dinner. “You should let Harry and I do the dishes, since you cooked,” Hermione told Ron when they finished eating.
Harry began sucking slowly, then gradually he started picking up speed. Somehow, he felt himself grow harder as he did.
When her eyes landed on Harry here brows shot up and her mouth formed a small circle.
Draco stabbed one of the noodles with his fork and took a bite. “Oh my god, Potter,” he said, “This is actually great.”
“I’m investigating the properties of a new class of compounds that was discovered in the last decade. They seem to have a lot of interesting uses, but we don’t really understand how they work. My advisor and I are trying to develop a more mechanistic understanding of how they work. Then, maybe in the future, we’ll be able to implement rationale design when we use them. Right now it’s a bit of guess-and-check.”
Harry turned around and scanned the crowd. A tall brunette woman was waving at him. “Harry! It’s Jeanine, from Professor Orwell’s class!”
Draco POV
" i did something."
" wait so what does that mean? Are you two dating?" He points at me and blaise with his pen. I swallowed the lump in my throat. Blaise held my hand tighter.
