“Malfoy I wanted to talk to you actually.” Harry says, setting his fork down. He watches as several emotions cross Malfoys features before a neutral expression lands.
“I know… but to be fair, his work was excellent, and he apologized to me, several times really.” Hermione says defensively.
“We both want to know and Harrys not dumb.” Hermione rolls her eyes back at him and crosses her arms.
“I’ll try and get a hold of him, but I don't think I’ll tell him about Lily. To be safe.” Harry says nodding
“Well in that case, you’d better go learn how to be a dad, Harry.” Arthur smiles happily, nodding toward the kitchen where they can hear Molly cooing happily at the baby.
Harry hesitates briefly in the fireplace before stepping out and dusting them both off with a quick swish of his wand. Lily bristles at the movement, wiggling in her blankets.
“I got the vibe that you weren’t ready for that and I understand. I don't want to make you uncomfortable and I don't want to make her uncomfortable so….another time.” Harry says, plating himself some food.
"Oh my god….Oh my god….Oh my god." Ginny bends over with her hands on her knees, heaving for breath. "I was gonna leave. Harry I'm packed up, I was going to leave tonight. I hate it here, all we do is fight and cry and yell."
“Probably since you brought...Lily...the house will really start snowballing on the effort to keep you here.” Malfoy turns to Harry. “Shall we move on to the next room?”
“Well lucky you that I'm not either!” Harry says. “Good, I really didn't want to have to start over cause you have an allergy or something.”
“Well not like...recently. It was like...a few months ago, almost a year now actually.” Harry rubs at the back of his neck.
“Well that's for you to find out, though I’ve certainly begun to notice some things.” Malfoy laughs gently and Harry wishes it didn't make his heart skip. He wishes he didn't notice that Malfoy was back into perfectly tailored clothes that hugs his stronger looking body perfectly. That his hair is gleaming softly in the warm morning light coming from the windows. That the smell of lemons and smoky vanilla has been making Harry's knees weak. He's embarrassed to notice any of it. To desire it. He had hoped, all those months ago, that his desires would change. That he would change. He wanted to fit the mold given to him by his friends and families expectations and just once he had wanted to be what they wanted. Harry purses his lips.  “For one I’ve noticed the house likes when you cook instead of having Kreacher do it. The kitchen gets brighter and little things change. “
“I didn't think it’d be so much work. I’ll bring some old clothes I was gonna throw out for us to wear so we don't ruin our everyday clothes.” Harry says, letting his eyes shut casually as well, in case Malfoy tried to read his body language.
Harry suddenly remembers their moment. The moment Malfoy and him have been dutifully ignoring. When Malfoy had kissed him against the brick wall of a slim alley way. Harry kissing him back. Harry apparating them back here, to Grimmauld, where they spent the night together only for Harry to panic and yell at him to leave once he woke from the afterglow.
He walks quietly to the kitchen deciding to make some breakfast while he waits. He absentmindedly hums a tune from Lily’s charmed mobile and starts gathering the ingredients. Thanking the powerful stasis charms on the pantry and fridge. He tries to remember the way Molly had bustled around when she cooked but he still fumbles his way around looking for the pans. He finally finds what he's looking for and starts on the eggs. He debates a full fry-up but if Malfoy’s been starving he doesn't want to make him sick so he settles on some fresh fruit and some scrambled eggs with some veggies. He’s just started on the fruit while the veggies and eggs cook when Malfoy walks in. He’s showered and combed his hair back. He looks significantly better. Harry shoots him a quick smile then focuses back on cutting the fruit.
“I want to disclose to you before anything happens that I have a daughter now so the house needs to be repaired and safe.” Harry says, emphasizing the safe. Malfoy closes his eyes and falls back against the brick. Harry knits his eyebrows and purses his lips.
“Okay, good. I'm going to head out then. See ya tomorrow.” Harry makes his way to the floo then goes back to the burrow. He feels oddly sad about just how sick and tired Malfoy seemed. Hopefully tomorrow he’d be a little better.
“Good luck, Harry.” Molly says as he walks back to the floo. “ If you have any problems or need help, you know where I am!”
“Oh Merlin! That's really a baby, Harry!” Ron exclaims in a baby voice. Harry gently hands the baby to Hermione who coos softly.
“It was left on our doorstep with this note.” Harry hands the note to Arthur who reads it as Molly studies the baby. “Horrible timing seeing as Ginny and I broke up right after we found it.”
Harry respects that Malfoy is letting him choose the price, and had honestly kind of been expecting it. Hermione had told him that Gringotts was all volunteer work. Malfoy probably didn't even know what it was worth.
“Well...not really but I did while working at Gringotts after the war.” Hermione looks to her lap. “But you're not gonna like it.”
"I….the fertility line." Draco sobs harder against his hands, his face a bright red beneath his palms.
“Yeah the health of the magic core.” Malfoy continues. “Every magical building has a core that the magic stems from and Grimmaulds' seems very strong albeit frayed and maybe...tired? It's sort of hard to describe since it's just feelings. This house has obviously been very empty for a long time and isn't anywhere close to its full potential so all the magic that was once spread out is now condensed? Almost? Basically our ultimate goal is going to be to spread the magic back out. Rooms that have existed here don't anymore, so we need to work on getting the house opened back up.”
Harry thinks for a moment. “ Your name is the name on the lease, you can have the apartment. I'll go back to Grimmauld.”
Lily and I are staying at the burrow until it's safe here, so if need me floo-call there. Okay?” Harry asks, stepping away from Malfoy who looks pale.
"Okay we can talk about that in a second, right now I'd like to address the baby in our hallway with your name on it." Harry cards a hand through his hair, his fingers catching on the knots that always seem to form in the fringe.
“So it's been alright?” Hermione asks, breaking the quiet tension that seems to surround their little booth in the corner. She shifts her eyes between Ron and Harry, stirring her drink with the silicone straw she keeps her bag.
“I'll help you pack.” Ginny says quietly, walking toward their room. Harry sends his Patronus to the burrow to warn them of his arrival with some shocking news, then helps Ginny with casting his sickeningly few possessions into boxes that they shrink and lighten before Harry tucks them into his pockets. He will never get over the marvel of what magic is capable of. It takes less than 20 minutes for him to be ready to go. Ginny gives him an awkward wave from the hallway as he stands in the fireplace with a fistful of floo powder. He casts one last look around the room while his heart pangs with an emptiness that makes his throat dry.
“I don't want to add to your stress, Harry. But, do you have a plan?” Hermione asks, joining Ron on the couch.
“I've set up a little something in the guest room near our room. I'll help as best I can when she wakes up. I love you Harry, sleep well okay?” She says, heading up the stairs with Harry in tow. She nods to his room and continues to her own. As he sets Lily in the transfigured crib the weight of what this means for him settles onto his shoulders. Yet the smile on his lips doesn't fade, even after he finally falls asleep.
“Oh my god, this is really happening.” Harry puts a hand to his chest where his heart feels like it's trying to leap from his ribcage. “ A baby girl.”
“Okay, I've been looking for you actually.” Harry says, he goes to continue but stops when Malfoys head snaps up and his eyes widen, shifting from side to side.
Malfoy pauses for a minute then opens his eyes then raises his hand, “I can help. We can discuss payment once I’ve walked through and assessed the house.”
“Are you going to talk to him about it? I imagine you're feeling a lot of complicated emotions about it.” Hermione folds one hand over the other and leans forward. Harry prepares to be grilled alive.
"You can't mean that, Harry. Im...I had a baby ! How fucking weird is that?!" Draco puts his head in his hands again.
“Right?” Harry says. “ Petunia used to tell me about how I was left in a basket on their doorstep. I couldn't say no, especially after reading the bit about Tom Riddle.”
“ Let him say it on his own time, Ron, honestly.” Hermione looks cross at him then turns to Harry, “ We’re proud of you Harry. And we love you.”
“Yeah, it makes me nauseous too.” Harry attempts to sound reassuring. It takes Malfoy a full minute of being hunched over retching up nothing for Harry to confirm that Malfoy is definitely not okay. He Accios a glass from the kitchen then casts an Aguamenti. He hands the cup to Malfoy who takes it with shaky hands, he swallows a small sip. They stand together awkwardly while he slowly finishes the water.
Harry smiles back, a softness in his heart that he's never felt before blossoming into his bones. “Let's get to work.”
"No you blithering idiot! Obviously your child isn't a problem. I'm just not a kid person is all." Malfoy rubs at his arms, seeming to finally notice the precarious string their business together is balancing on.
Harry stood to answer the quiet knocking that echoed through the whole apartment. Running a hand through his hair and gathering himself, he starts the walk through the hall. Pausing at the door he takes one last breath preparing himself for the inevitable recognition and rejection that always leaves him sour. The last thing he needs after another fight with Ginny. When he opens the door to an empty hallway he feels an odd mixture of relief and annoyance that has him pressing his teeth together with a harsh clack. He checks down the empty halls in both directions before sighing and making to close the door. A garbled whine has him stopping and kneeling. A small basket with an envelope tucked into the fabric sits on his doorstep. His face pales and his heart leaps to his throat. A baby. A newborn baby lay idly in the throws of fabric wrapped gently around its body. Harry's mind flashes through several briefly debilitating thoughts that this mirrors his own childhood far to accurately. He reads the card "Ginevra Weasley" written in a beautiful sprawling script. Harry's breath leaves him in one long exhale.
"Stop. It's fine. You can bring her." Malfoy rubs at his face. "I think I'm done for the day, actually. Today can be 50 galleons."
"Malfoy….Draco….please stay. At least till we are done with the house but...hopefully after as well." Harry leans back against the stiff wood of the chair and feels it get comfier as he adjusts.
“See you sap, you do like kids.” Harry whispers, not wanting to break this moment. His heart feels stupidly full.
“I understand. Next question, do you want me to only go over spellwork and remove dangerous objects or are hoping for more of an entire overhaul? Because to be frank, Potter, this house is a little….outdated...and ehem….dingy.” Malfoy says, scratching at his hair. Harry notices how unkempt it is, dirty and scraggly. Falling loose and longer than he'd ever seen it.
He lets them finish cooking on the cooling pan while he grabs plates and forks, setting them on the table. Then he sets the bowl of fruit down and grabs his pot holders to place the cast iron on.
“Harry, I'm still leaving. I won't stay even if you choose to keep this baby.” Ginny whispers through her tears. Harry feels his own eyes fill up too. He hasn't been happy here for a while. The empty apartment while Ginny’s away only to fight and cry when she's around.
Harry just stares dumbly with a slack jaw for a long long moment, running the thought through his mind over and over and over again.
"Well then…I'll leave you to it for the night. Same time tomorrow, Malfoy?" Harry sets his stack of gold onto the coffee table. Malfoy nods softly, staring at the gold from his spot on the dusty sofa.
“Good, I’m hoping you’ll do what you need to be comfortable here.” Harry nods before getting up and refilling his glass just for something to do.
Harry nods and shakes his hand. He hates how bony and thin it is. Malfoys skin seems papery. So unlike the soft rosy skin he remembers against his lips. He drops his hand and takes a small step back. He clears his throat. “That sounds fair. When can you start?”
Harry fills both glasses then settles back down, scarfing up his food then downing his water. He's finished before Malfoy even scoops his fruit onto his plate. All at once the awkwardness of their past catches up to him. He shuffles awkwardly, trying not to notice the way Malfoy's hair is bright and clean and the way it curls along to bottoms with its new length.
He waves awkwardly before hiking the bag up onto his shoulder. He holds Lily close to his chest, supporting her head as she looks up at him quietly. He smiles at her then floos back to Grimmauld.
“I made a lot of stuff, coffee indeed being one of them.” Harry sets the French press onto the table along with a mug. “You want any cream, sugar, milk….?”
“Well…..it's Malfoy. But I don't even know if he’s still doing that, it's been a year and some odd months since he was working with Gringotts to fix vaults in exchange for the funds to fix Malfoy Manor.” Hermione rubs at her jaw uncomfortably.
“ Not a bad idea. Once we start going through objects we’ll most likely get quite dusty.” Malfoy agrees after a poignant moment of pause.
Harry looks at Draco and tries to read his body language. He doesn't like what he sees. Draco sits straight with a pale face and a clenched jaw.
Harry sighs and rubs at his face. So much for that. He makes his way back to the first floor and sets 100 galleons on the counter top. He looks at it for a little while, wondering how that went so wrong.
Harry supposes Draco had made up his mind about the after part as well because when they stand up from the table, the room expands triumphantly into double its size, if not larger. Harry watches in awe as the room fizzles with magic. The life lines are exposed and contracting as they expand over the new surfaces. The magic integrating into the new space with ease and comfort.
"Harry we can't keep this baby, it won't fix our relationship, just like we discussed. We aren't the same people. I...I..I have my harpies career! I just signed the four year contract! I'll be out of the country for months! You can't keep this baby!"
"Alrighty then….goodnight." Harry says lamely, scratching at the back of his neck. He waves awkwardly then steps through the floo. Hoping the image of a lone tear rolling down Malfoys cheek won't be seared into his brain forever.
“I...made a lot because I started then suddenly couldn't remember anything we’ve eaten over the last few weeks.” Malfoy gestures to the plates of food. “But there's no pineapple or peppers!”
“I thought you weren't ready for a baby.” Ron asks, craning his neck around the room trying to spot the baby.
“ Well… there's really no other way to say it so I’m just gonna come out with it.” Harry says, sighing.
“I...kind of… well so… I'm..not straight?” Harry says, cursing himself as it comes out posed as a question. “I mean. I slept with Malfoy.”
“Harry, oh my god, I’m gonna cry.” Hermione hands the baby to Ron who's beaming brightly. She wipes at her eyes then hugs Harry tightly. “I love it. If you need anything you let us know, okay?”
“Excellent. I wanted to get explicit permission before we began. I have to go through every room and all belongings to detect any hexes, curses, and potentially frayed spellwork. That means going through Sirius’ stuff. Obviously I'll be gentle and mindful for everything but I wanted you to know that.”
“Lily. Definitely Lily. Maybe Lily Jean? After Hermione?” Harry says. “Oh god, Ron and Hermione. I need to tell them!”
“I knew it.” Hermione says softly smiling behind her hand. “In sixth year...I wont say stalking cause I know you don't like it but you were...I mean Harry, you were obsessed with Malfoy.”
“This room wasn’t here before. It’s existed in this home before but it's new again, see how the color of the walls are the same cream we put in the parlor?” Malfoy plucks at the only string of red in the room. “The house is not only accepting our changes, it's integrating them. We should start seeing more light colors, windows, things like that in the next few work days. The house might even start giving us stuff.”
"Jesus Christ. Were we actually just given a newborn fucking baby?" Harry breathes in disbelief, his finger runs circles along the baby's tiny rosy cheek as it begins snoozing.
“Well today is going to be mostly surveying. Seeing what state the house is in, how cooperative it's going to be, and what kind of magic is woven into the core. Since this is a traditional pureblood home, I imagine a lot of nasty spellwork will be woven into the house. So today will be identifying and cataloging that kind of stuff so that I can work on unweaving it from the fabric of the core to make the house more welcoming. I imagine it’ll be some rough work. By the end of the day, if we have our basework done, I should be able to give you a time and money estimate.”
Harry shakes his head gently to expel his train of thought. He forces himself to focus. “That's nice, I like that the house is coming around. That it wants me here.”
“ Harry, Lily is mine.” Draco says after a long moment of strained silence. Harry mulls the sentence over and tries to make it make sense.
“Are you gonna be sick again?” Harry asks standing up, casting an Accio to summon the waste basket from the bathroom. Malfoy shakes his head but screws his fist tighter against his lips. Harry sets the wastebasket down in front of Malfoy.
“You think so?” Harry asks, hoping his voice doesn't sound weird. He’s not ready for that conversation. He probably won't ever be.
“Thanks. I would have you come after you were better if I'd known.” Harry says knowing that this was definitely the best option for Malfoy. He was only going to get worse on his own. His cheeks heat up a little at the praise.
“I think I'd like to leave some sort of legacy for Sirius...but I don't want to leave it the same.” Harry says, running a hand through his fringe.
“And… you’re keeping it?” Arthur asks gently, looking between Molly and Harry. Molly purses her lips in distaste at the question but looks nervously at Harry as they wait for the answer.
“ I did some diagnostics on the bedroom I slept in last night just to see where it was health wise and-”
“It's okay, Harry. This is a lot happening very fast.” Hermione pats his back in the way she knows grounds him.
“Yeah, I can pay of course.” He says, taking in Malfoys…..homely state. Malfoy seems to think it over for a minute before nodding slowly.
A long room with a wall of mirrors sits empty and grand. Malfoy stands against the far side of the room, a low stage glowing beneath the golden fabric of magic. The spell work is loose and barren here. The walls echo Harry's footsteps as he makes his way to Malfoy. He doesn't remember this room.
“I think we should wait until tomorrow to do the walkthrough.” Harry says shuffling awkwardly from foot to foot. “You can stay here tonight and we can start early tomorrow, if you're feeling better?”
“I'm not about to walk around this huge house on an empty stomach first thing in the morning, Malfoy.” Harry shakes his head.
“That's what the colored lines are called, as stuff happens in the house it adds life lines or lines of magic that alter or influence the room. So...for example the first blue line you worked on. That was a fertility line. Someone was having a hard time conceiving a child and was obviously very upset by that so the house wove a fertility line into the spellwork, to help them have a child, most likely an heir. Possibly it was me even.” Malfoy shrugs.
“Molly will be more than happy to watch the baby while I fix it up. How hard can it be?” Harry is nodding and forming plans already. “I’ll stay at the burrow tonight, so Molly can help.”
“Thank you, Potter.” Malfoy says quietly, turning quickly to walk down the alley. Harry catches sight of his face and grabs Malfoys wrist suddenly, stopping him.
“Could you come now?” Harry asks gently, nodding away from where a couple of men were gathering to no doubt wait for Harry to leave to jump Malfoy again. Malfoy seems to notice them too and nods, pulling up his hood and following Harry out into Diagon Alley.
“It's a baby girl.” Harry says, beaming at his friends' support. “ I was thinking of Lily Jean, after my mum and you, Hermione.”
“No! No, I'm not gay, guys.” Harry says defensively, “That's not the news at all! Gin and I broke up and well…I have a baby now.”
“How do you know all this, it's brilliant really.” Harry asks, pushing away from the kitchen island he was leaning on.
“On your own? There's some very old magic there, Harry. It might be best to find someone with some experience with stuff like that.” Hermione replies
"Is Lily going to be a problem? Because if so then I'm not sure I trust that this place will be safe enough for us." Harry says defensively.
“ I knew it, your gay.” Ron says beaming. Harrys jaw drops and his cheeks flame up hotly. Hermione smacks his shoulder.
“I’ve...thought about it but I….I kind of panicked and tossed him out afterward and now I’m worried that’ll taint any potential I might have.” Harry sighs and deflates against his seat.
Harry smiles gently at them and wonders if this might be the moment. He nods gently to let them know he's going to respond but hesitates a moment around his words. Should he just get it over with and tell them? Or should he give them the information piece by piece so as to not overwhelm them. Or should he shove these feelings deep into the pits of his heart and pretend they were never even here. He briefly remembers Ginny and decides it might be worth telling them, if it means he can find someone to be actually happy with. He hates that Malfoy flashes through his thoughts again.
Hermione's eyes bug and Ron coughs, spitting bits of chip everywhere. He chokes around them for a second before swallowing a big gulp of his pint to wash down the fragments.
“Stuff?” Harry spins, looking at the ceiling. He tries to picture what he'd want from the house and a nursery pops into his mind. An enchanted ceiling of stars at night that dims into a morning light. Light creamy colors and billowy curtains. A window overlooking the garden that's blooming with fresh spring fragrance as a soft breeze comes in through the cracked window. Lily, happy and content, laying amongst soft satiny blankets in a sturdy safe wooden bed. A room that could become her own as she grows and changes. He smiles and closes his eyes. Taking a deep breath he pictures what kind of life he'd like to live in this home. He pictures lily and him picking fresh vegetables from the garden, laughing around the kitchen as he fries them in too much butter. His eyes shoot open and he stops his train of thought in his tracks when Draco Malfoy pops into the image. Arms around Harry's waist and lily smiling from the table, laughing about something Malfoy said. A thick sweat breaks from Harry's forehead.
“Okay, before we start the walkthrough, I’d like to ask some questions to start the profile.” Malfoy rubs his stomach with a frown. “Is there somewhere we can sit?”
“Okay. So first let me show you the diagnostic spells. We’ll be done a lot faster if we both cast.” Malfoy shows Harry the sweeping movement of his wand and teaches him the incantations necessary to detect and identify the spell work.
"And why exactly is that something you think I'd want, Potter?" Malfoy stands back up right with crossed arms and a straight back. Harry recognizes it as defiance.
Harry is sweating and dead on his feet by the time they call it a night. He feels bad for pushing Malfoy that hard. If he's this tired no doubt Malfoy is near collapsing. But they had gotten through the whole house, even the cellar and attic. Harry collapses onto the sofa and Malfoy follows suit across from him.
“Harry...you’re being serious?” Ginny shakes her head in disbelief. “ Where will it go? There's no room here.”
“I...didn't give birth at mungos, I...I was too scared. I didn't start healing from it until Kreacher started getting me potions. It wasn't pepper up. It was nutrient and healing potions. I'm sorry I lied to you…” Draco scrapes his chair back from the table. He paces around the kitchen, scrubbing at his eyes.
"You just said it yourself, Harry! You weren't ready to admit anything and I couldn't be the one to force you...not like that. Not then." Malfoy puffs out a watery sigh then slumps back into his chair.
“I want to say I'm proud of you. This is a pretty big decision but you seem to be sure and excited about it. I love you, Harry. If you need anything, and I mean anything. You let us know, alright?” He hugs Harry tightly then steps into the floo. Hermione hugs him too.
Malfoys face drops a little. “ I was mostly alone in the Manor growing up so I did a lot of reading. I enjoyed watching the spellwork once I learnt how to see it.”
He stops in the doorway and watches as Malfoy paces the length of the table, a hand clasped over his heart. Harry frowns briefly.
“Yeah I'm not explaining it well but someone left a baby at our doorstep. And you guys know how we have been arguing for a while about exactly that… a baby.”
“Sorry. I've been unwell for a little while. That was the most refreshing Aguamenti I've ever tasted.” Malfoy says handing the cup back to Harry. He vanishes the cup back to the kitchen then helps Malfoy stand upright.
“ I know I know. I think maybe...it was just Ginny...It felt like she only wanted to have a baby to keep us together… but neither of us was happy together...I didn't want to raise a baby in that.” Harry rings his hands tightly together. “We broke up right after I found the baby...It felt like maybe destiny. Like fate knew I did want a baby….just not with Ginny. No offense of course.”
I want to apologize firstly for the surprise but the truth is I had a baby that I can't take care of. I don't have the money, the space, the support. It's just me and I can't do it on my own. But you… you have a big family and money and a roof and….so much that I can't give them. They aren't named and….I didn't let anyone tell me anything about the baby. It had to be a clean break or I'd never be able to let go. It's so important to me that this baby gets a good life and that they are raised well. Better than I was. I cant taint this baby with my past or I'll never forgive myself. Please please please keep them and love them and don't ever let them know that they aren't yours. Because if it ever found out who I was….it'd hate itself. I know you guys will do right by them….and that Harry will learn to love them. After all, he should see some of himself in them. If you choose to not keep them...I understand. This is a burden I’ve thrusted on to you guys with no warning. I considered an orphanage myself but ultimately I couldn't get the image of the situation being the choice between raising a Harry Potter or a Tom Riddle. And I chose Harry, I always will.
Harry awkwardly rubs at his neck. “ I don't have any real...budget. It's sort of just however much it takes to make this place safe for Lily and I.”
“Well...it's um...to be honest it's going great. The house is really coming along and I'm learning a lot. Malfoy knows what he's doing that's for sure.” Harry rubs at the stubble that's growing in and sighs. “I have to tell you guys something though.”
"I was hoping you'd tell me." Harry turns and picks up the basket gently. He turns back to Ginny who begins reading.
“Whenever, honestly.”  Malfoy tucks his hands away into the folds of his cloak, like he could hear what Harry had thought about them.
“Yeah, I'm surprisingly okay with it. I don't think either of us has been very happy for a while.” Harry sighs and pulls at his fringe.
“I suppose not.” Malfoy says, grabbing a helping of the eggs first. Harry scoops a bit of each onto his plate. He stands up and grabs two glasses.
“This was the note that the mom left with her.” Harry says handing it to Hermione who reads it out loud.
“Well, maybe you should consider it. Try picturing your future, your life, even Lily’s future and see if there's a place in it for him. Does it fill you with happiness and excitement?” Hermione cards her fingers through the hair at the crown of Harry's head. He pictures the same scene from before, cooking with Malfoy and Lily. He fleshes out the image, picturing the conversation, the tone, the feelings. He tries to imagine a swift image of a dream day. Breakfast, a walk in the garden, picking fresh produce for lunch, maybe a couple of hens for eggs and hives for honey and pollination. He pictures it all with Malfoy holding his hand and laughing in the sun with him, lily on Malfoys hip, smiling up at the sky, and his heart feels too full. Before he really has a grasp on what's happening he sobs against the table top. He lifts his arm and folds in front of his face, cocooning his face against the wood.
“Yeah, you can say that again.” Malfoy says, his eyes slipping closed. Harry takes the brief opportunity to run his eyes across Malfoys form. No doubt he was horribly hot in the baggy robes. He sees the bright flush on Malfoys cheeks and the ways his chest seems to heave under the cloak and decides he probably ought to get Malfoy something else to wear. He debates how to approach the topic without highlighting the distinct lack of things Malfoy has. He doesn't want to offend him after such a nice day of progress.
"Don't be daft, Harry." Ginny rolls her eyes and leans around Harry, her eyes bugging as she spots the basket. "Oh god!"
Harry pauses and sighs. “I’m not being very clear but basically when I’ve been picturing my future, you’re a part of it and I don't want to be presumptive, like...this isn't a proposal or anything but...i don't know. I'm just trying to say I like like you but I'm horrible at words and feelings I guess.”
"Why didn't you tell me, I could have helped!" Harry feels confusion and anger bubble up over the bone deep awe. Lily is actually his daughter. He has a daughter. A real blood relative. Lily was as much his daughter before as she is now...but, a blood relative. With Malfoy.
“Oh..” Malfoy trails off, seeming to mull over his options as he finally digs into the food. He chews his bite then swallows. “ Today, I suppose.”
Harry watches him walk to the room he's been occupying. He watches him shut the door behind him and feels in the wards when Malfoy casts Locking charm after locking charm against the door.
“ Obviously help yourself to anything you want or need. Kreacher can get you just about anything, even some medicine if you need it.” Harry gestures around the space then points up the stairs. You can take any room on the first floor; they should be mostly empty guest rooms.
“After you kicked me out I got really sick, and my mother made a comment that freaked me out. She said she looked the same when she was pregnant with me. Pale and clammy and she couldn't eat without potions and she was sick. I...cast a spell to see...just cause….I was scared. Imagine my surprise when it lit up green. I kept it secret until I couldn't anymore and mother kicked me out...that was ...god I was 7 months before it showed. I didn't have any money, a home, anything. I couldn't...I couldn't bring myself to tell you. I was so scared and ashamed and and...you were with Ginny. I didn't want to….I didn't want to make you mad again. So when she came I...I gave her to you. I couldn't...I can't taint her. I can't give her a home like you can.” Draco explains through soft watery sobs.
Quick to listen, Ron dropped his elbows from the table, his foot knocking against Harry’s. A flash of a smile was shone in his direction. Like he was sharing in some joke with the other boy. The aura of slight inclusion was enough to make Harry’s heart leap in his chest, rampant and untamed. Harry knocked his foot back, and the two shared a smile, one bright with enthusiasm, the other timid.
“Now we aren’t strangers. It’s nice to meet you, Harry.” As Sirius spoke, his head bobbed along with his words. His cheeks seemed hollowed, skin a heavy sallow shade, his eyes dark. There was a dusting of fuzz covering his face, a shabby excuse for a beard, that would have made even the nicest of faces appear frightening - but Harry only noticed the smile on the man’s lips, the gentle way he spoke. It felt nice to be regarded as human.
He neared the tree, a minefield of purple flowers falling prey to his bare feet. Their bowed heads touched the ground in an act of dying worship, with Harry paying them little attention as he reached out to touch the moss. Midair, his searching hand paused. A blurred grumble sounded from somewhere in the forest, the noise so faint that it could be mistaken for the congregation of animals, but it broke into the muffled sound of voices. Footsteps neared, the far-away shuffle becoming the heavy punctuation of boots sweeping aside leaves and flowers.
i really had fun building hermione and ron up this chapter, i'm trying to get them fully fleshed out in my mind's eye, and they were being quite lovely to my writing this time around! i think they're very sweet, honestly.
“I’m going to drive for as long as this car holds up, and you’re welcome to join me. You can leave whenever you want, or you can stay with me. I wouldn’t mind a bit of company. The radio doesn’t work in this old thing.” A pause hung in the air. The singing wind snatched at tree branches, an unearthly howl unleashed as it twisted through the air. “Or I could leave right now, and I won’t tell anyone about the strange boy in the woods.”
The shelves were bursting with snacks. Packets of crisps appeared fluffy and filled, pressing against the steel bars that covered the bottom halves of the shelves, primed for greedy hands to snatch at. Popcorn sat on the lower shelves, advertising a range of flavours, from sweet to salty to toffee to butter. Chocolate bars were neat and ordered to the left of him, a thousand choices he had never tried, their packaging purple and shiny and advertising the sweetest, smoothest, milkiest promises.
“Harry, you don’t have to be a stranger to be strange. You just have to be out in the middle of the night without shoes on.” The laughter that fell from Harry’s lips was timid, unused to the way it made his chest bounce and his shoulders shake. His hands folded his blanket against his chest, eyeing the passenger seat. “So, will you be joining me?”
Though it didn’t spark much confidence in Harry to listen to the warbling tone of Ron;s voice, excitement coursed through him. A car! With a boy who wasn’t a murderer!
The kitchen was the coolest part of the house. Even in the void-like darkness that had blanketed each room, every curtain squeezed shut to block out the prying eyes of the neighbours, Harry navigated it without trouble. Every step was taken with precision, avoiding any place that could make too much noise, any spot that would summon the wrath of the sleeping dragons upstairs.
Holding his breath, Harry’s mind searched the house for signs of life. The floorboards in Dudley’s room creaked and settled, a familiar tune of an old house. Snores filled the stagnant air, intercut with faint snorts, but it was a symphony of the sleeping. A few more seconds were wasted, Harry refusing to breathe, listening for any tricks. Vernon was a heavy sleeper, but Petunia could awaken with ferocious speed, descending on the house with hushed screams at being disturbed so late into the night. Everything was quiet. Everything was touched with a burning warmth.
Lifting his fingers, Sirius clicked off the radio, the little speakers making a whirring noise with their death. The silence in the car persisted as he placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder, trying to tempt him awake with calls of his name. Feeling the other’s shoulder, Sirius winced at the sparrow-bones arching against his hand, desperate to escape from a body that hadn’t been treated right. Realising how harshly he was pressing against the other, he loosened his grip, scared Harry would snap from his touch.
Admittedly, though the core of the circumstances were similar, Harry had also never done anything like this before. Still, he hoarded what experience he had, and kept his cool.
A rumble struck the ground, alerting the focused boy to the sudden change. Light had flooded his dark world, illuminating the cover of trees that he had shuffled under, a small boy with a blanket wrapped around his muddy feet, staring with wide eyes at the car. Breath gathered in his chest until his heart felt heavy, pounding furiously, as if it wanted to break free and escape. His fear only diminished marginally when he realised it wasn’t the Dursleys’ family car.
Propping himself up on his elbows, Harry curled his legs away from Ron, dangling them off the side of the bed. Perhaps he should prove Ron right and make a dash for it.
Any escape from the circle of trees could make him too visible, exposing himself to the predators lurking in the open, but staying near the oak could prove dangerous if the strangers wandered into his safe haven. All his options were only half-solutions. Eyes closing, his head fell forward, forehead cooling against the moss of the tree. His breaths were still ragged, heart rattling in his chest. The buzzing of voices grew.
Disappearing down the sleep incline of grass, Harry’s feet caught on branches, the tangles of weeds, stray rocks cutting into his exposed skin. Bruises had bloomed in crisp purples and yellows, the tangy colour of infection rising over his ankle in a steady red, his skin browning with mud. His toenails were so entirely covered that the dirt could be mistaken for nail polish. The buzz of cars bled into the forest, causing Harry to walk a little faster into the safe hiding of bushes and trees. Without a map, he tried to navigate the unknown with something like common sense, but his movements were haphazard and desperate. He swerved and twisted throughout the thick underbrush, knowing little of the flowers around him, so he tried to avoid all of them. His feet were aching enough without being scratched and irritated by stinging nettles or thorns.
The stranger laid a tattooed arm against the open window, trying to peer closer at the boy’s face. Harry lowered his head to avoid his gaze, listening to the lull of the forest behind him, encased in silence. He’d be quicker than the man, malnourished and maltreated, but younger and agile. A natural instinct to run.
“Yes, Ron. I’m going to leave.” There was little else he could say. He couldn’t stay in this house forever. His thoughts were filled with a man with a kind smile and wild eyes, shaggy locks and dishevelled clothes, stalking ever closer to the house to capture his prey. No, this was no place for him to stay.
“How would I tell a trustworthy stranger from an untrustworthy stranger?” Three fingers had joined Sirius’ tapping, the beat slow and untimed, before a rhythm of middle-left-right was established.
“Of course. We always make enough for an extra plate for situations like this. Well, not situations like this, we don’t usually find boys immobile in the woods.” Warm laughter left Molly’s lips. He felt strangely absent from the situation, like he was certain something like this could happen, just not to him. “But, do you think you could make it?”
Harry stared at her. She might have been his height, but her presence filled the room, bathing it in soft light. A hand was held towards him, but Harry couldn’t move his gaze or his body.
Sandwiches safe in the crook of his elbow, he held out the two notes. His mind felt heavy with a daze, a flurry of half-thoughts passing through. The money, of course she’d need the money - the money he had taken from Sirius Black. The sandwiches he had bought for Sirius Black. The car he had spent the night in, enjoying the freedom of summer air, with an escaped murderer. His name had turned sinister, etched with all the horrors it implied.
“Yes,” Harry replied, fiddling with the money between his fingers. “That, and the petrol, for the car. Just - just the one outside.” Thumb jerked behind his ear to point at it, but her gaze remained on his thumb until he dropped it. The digit suddenly seemed dirty to him, offensive in some intangible way.
“Turning back is always an option. You just have to decide if the unknown is worth the chance,” Sirius said. The boy was skeletal, each breath revealing the brush of clearly defined ribs outlined by his shirt, his eyes sunken, his hair an overgrown mess. For a boy like him, the unknown was the only safety. For a man like Sirius, the unknown was the only place to hide. “Do you want to open a window? That little knob down there, just turn it and the windows open.”
He couldn’t take much from the kitchen. A few biscuits, no more than four at any one time, would be a small enough ration that Vernon would silently accuse Petunia, and Petunia would worry about Vernon’s health, but never speak a word on it. Some milk or juice could be taken if Dudley had some with his dinner. Water could always be taken, but the glass would have to be kept under the cupboard with him, until he could sneak it out to clean with the morning dishes. Anything else would cause suspicion.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Harry murmured, but he stayed in the halo of light coming from the car. If he had been more perceptive, he’d note that the licence plates had been pried away from the vehicle, that there were slight scratches over the rear. “We don’t know each other.”
“To the kitchen?” He supposed it was time for him to leave. He had woken up, and he seemed to be in a coherent state.
read the headline; two frightening words that crashed together to form a sentence riddled with torment, fear-mongering and prediction. Below the words, a picture stood, a mugshot of said monster. It had been reduced to black and white, pale skin that bled into the paper, darkness filling his hair and eyes, lips icy and thin.
Shifting to his side, Harry rested his hand on the handle of the door and waited. The rise and fall of snores were still lifting the air, but there was nothing else. He pushed his door open, wincing at every delicate creak and groan, rickety and worn from age. Once it was open just enough to fit a body, he slipped from the small cupboard, breathing in the freshness of cooling air.
“What are you running away from?” Though Harry hadn’t be raised to understand the social clues of his peers, the little smiles and titters and wide-eyed glances that made up a child’s language, he knew how to read adults. They were open books with crumpled pages, a little ruined, a little entertaining.
“Not a hospital, sadly,” Molly murmured, hands lifting to span across the length of the room. Harry’s back laid against one wall, and his feet almost touched the other side; it was a shrunken house. Watching his toe peek out from beneath the blanket, Harry waggled it a little, and committed himself to his fake alias. As nice as she seemed, he had trusted smiling strangers before, and it had led to him getting into a car with a - murderer. A murderer. “Fred and George brought you back, they found you lying by yourself in the forest, looking a little pale. You’re at my house now. Well, the Weasley house.”
Eyes flung open, a startled green that ran in quick succession over the car, from Sirius’ hand to his face, before zipping over the landscape. His lips were parted slightly in a half-pant, and Sirius removed his hand, unable to stand the tenseness of the boy’s body. There was no hazy honey-warm bliss of a relaxing sleep; everything about Harry seemed alarmed and alert as soon as he was touched, an ingrained fear seeping into him. It disappeared in a flash, his mind catching up with his body, but Sirius had seen it. He looked like a trapped animal who had never learned to bite.
“I don’t know where I’m going, either. Would you like to come with me?” The stranger’s friendless had been touched by something foreign, the sound of pity, for the child sat alone in the darkness, his clothes ratty and ridden with holes, his feet smeared with mud. He must have been homeless, or desperate, and the stranger felt an attachment to the hopeless strength in his eyes.
“You can,” Harry conceded. A stray string peeking from beneath his shirt caught his attention, his thumb dropping to stroke over it. Twisting his fingers, the string wrapped around his skin, tightening until the bone beneath was starkly visible. Sirius’ laughter was a soft barking noise, caught in his throat, loud against the silent night. Pulling his fingers away from the loose string, Harry considered Sirius with a smile. His dark eyes were mapping out the roads. “I didn’t think to take any.”
“Gotcha, Harry.” A twenty was pulled from Sirius’ wallet, a walnut brown that looked darker against the man’s paling skin. Fingers lifted in a dance of hesitation, before another twenty was plucked from the sparse bouquet of money. As Harry watched, he folded away his blanket, placing it on his seat. “Just in case they have any shoes in there.”
Draco huffed. Sadly, Harry was right. Pub night had become a tradition that no one missed. And now that they were together, everyone seemed to be watching them closely. Evidently Pansy and Granger felt invested in their happiness together. Who could have predicted that? “I just had to go and fall in love with the Chosen One.” He shook his head.
Seth nodded and took Granger's order, too. "Pansy and I talk a lot, now. We gossip sometimes, about the boys in our lives that are a bit too stupid for their own good."
“And you believe that standing in front of the Minister for Magic’s door is the proper place to fix that?”
Drawing back, Harry stared at him. “Are you mad? Of course they would miss us. And we’d have Hermione, Pansy, and probably Neville banging on the door demanding to know what’s wrong.”
Potter finally started eating his cake. "I like doing it, though. Chasing down leads, putting the people who break the law behind bars."
Draco swallowed hard, resisting the urge to move his hand and link his fingers with Harry's. “Why do you say that?”
Harry closed his eyes, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “Damn, now that you mention it, so do I.” He sighed. “Tomorrow night? Dinner at mine? That way if things get...interesting again we can let it take its course.”
Potter shrugged. "I thought that you wanted to be friends. After earlier. You know, the coffee." He smiled. "Sorry, tea."
Draco chuckled darkly. "She's locked us in, you know. I mean, I should have known this was coming. She usually eats outside because of the garden, but instead, she wants to see me in the family parlour?"
Mother raised an eyebrow. "If you had been in your right mind, Draco, you wouldn't have walked into such an obvious trap."
Harry chuckled and Draco sharply nudged Harry's shoulder with his own. "Just you wait. She'll be plotting ways to trick you now and teach you how to avoid them in the future."
Seth finally got down to their end of the bar and reached out for a glass. Draco smiled at Seth. "Whisky, neat. And another gin and tonic."
Releasing him, Pansy crossed her arms, and Hermione looked between them. "Who wants to tell me what's going on?"
"I asked her not to. The thing is, as soon as he decided that Harry would become evil, he decided that he would be the one to
Draco bit his tongue to keep from saying something witty—goodness knew, Potter would probably take it badly and that would keep Potter from spilling his secrets. "And your coffee?"
Potter shrugged. "Sort of? He said he remembered a lot of meetings when he was an Auror, but when I explained how many meetings we have been having and the paperwork—I mean, I get it. A lot of it was created in the days after Voldemort to stop things from getting that bad, but paperwork can be forged.
"Better," she said. "If you'd rather call me Narcissa, though, until you're more comfortable saying Mum, that's okay, too."
Now that Narcissa understood her son's reasoning, she was left to question the reasoning of the young women before her.
Potter sat back and raised his eyebrows playfully. "Is that why you decided to chat me up as it were? Because I'm a mystery you want to solve?"
"And Harry's chart shows he will become a Dark Lord?" Narcissa tried to hide her amusement. She did not know the Potter boy as well as the others, but she had seen enough of him to know that he was the least likely wizard to take up the Dark Arts. If the chart claimed he would, then the chart was rubbish.
But if he'd messed up the input, then … There at the bottom was a completely different result. Harry was destined to be a defender of justice. An Auror. Draco wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.
Oops. Draco eyed Potter, looking for signs that he was on the breaking point, about to pull out his wand and start hexing people. He seemed calm, however. Draco exhaled. “So it’s back to your reports now, I presume?”
"Salazar!" Pansy shook her head. "This Unspeakable project has clearly driven you around the twist. You really think you’re going to be able to use this entirely new and unique Arithmancy system to save the world? Don't you think you're being a bit dramatic, even for you?”
More? Well, fuck him sideways. Draco wanted to hit his head on the table. Nervously, he answered, "Maybe. We'll see, Potter."
Potter smiled sheepishly. "I just wanted to apologise. I left a bit abruptly, I know. A lot on my mind."
And as Draco began unbuttoning Harry’s robes to get to the warm muscles beneath, he completely forgot that he was in his family’s sitting room.
But no. Draco vaguely remembered from the bar—his memories were hazy, okay, one too many gin and tonics because of his nerves—that Weasley and Potter were joking about one of their co-workers getting busted for using an illegal hex during an interrogation. Draco couldn't remember why, but he did recall that the Auror had been caught because, to comply with new regulations, all Aurors had their wands checked at the end of the day.
"Sorry I'm late," Potter said, jostling Draco into flipping his spoon out of his tea. "Shite. My fault. Let me get you a new one."
Draco huffed, but left the table. He leaned against the bar and waved his glass. Seth, the bartender, nodded, but continued working down the line of the bar to fill other drinks. Draco propped his arms up and rolled his glass between his hands.
Sitting back, Draco stretched, wincing as he heard his neck pop. Before him, spread out on the table, were his Arithmancy calculations, his final thesis, required before he could finally join the Unspeakables. It was supposed to be his masterpiece, his way back to legitimacy.
That was the crux of the matter. Draco had always been obsessed with the Potter boy, but he had never found a functional way of expressing it. He terrorised the boy, always making himself more miserable as Harry grew more antagonistic. Narcissa looked at Hermione. "And what does Harry think of all this?"
She glanced to the other girl sitting opposite her on the floral sofa. Hermione Granger had also been a surprise. Narcissa had once been sure the upstart Mud--
“Neville met all the criteria I did, but for one thing.” Harry tapped the faint scar on his forehead. “Voldemort didn’t mark him his equal.” His eyes went distant. “I sometimes wonder what would have happened if it had been Neville--”
Potter's laugh was unexpected and bright. Draco smiled, unable to stop himself. "Am I really that funny? No, seriously. No one ever laughs when I say things like that."
And it gives me time to figure out what to do about this, about you, Draco thought. He nodded. “Sounds like a plan.”
, but it would show that someone will be a professional Quidditch player or a politician subservient to the Minister."
"They're my numbers," she pointed out. “And if I hadn’t suggested you think outside the box, it would never have occurred to you to go back to something so old.”
"Oh, I don’t know, I’ve had some pretty stellar--” Draco paused, his breath hitching despite himself as Harry fluttered his tongue against the sensitive skin of his neck even as he skillfully undid his flies. And just when had Harry learned how to do that? He moaned as Harry’s hand closed around his erection.
But when Harry would clasp his arm and squeeze for emphasis, or nudge his shoulder playfully as they walked, it felt like something else. Something more.
Draco raised his eyebrows at her and then smiled at Neville. "Sorry. I didn't know you two were going to try for a quiet moment during our little gathering."
Draco spun when the door to the parlour closed and locked. He turned around, glaring. "You've been talking to Pansy and Granger, haven't you? I've told you before that—"
Draco's heart fell to his feet at the sound of the single word spoken with such confusion and anger. He was afraid to turn and see Harry's face, but he couldn't resist. He only had a moment to take in the hurt in Harry's eyes before he was gone, and Draco heard the same whooshing sound from a few moments before.
Potter rolled his eyes, but smiled. It was the smile Draco often saw aimed at his friends, and it was rather pleasant being the recipient for once. "I think we can get both from the same place."
Except that their prize Auror is going to be the most corrupt of all. But Draco was working on that. That's why the Ministry needed Unspeakables: to solve the problems no one else could handle.
Draco crossed his arms and winced when he heard the lock again. Harry moved his chair an inch away. Draco bit his lip. "She'll notice when she gets back."
They chose a small table in the corner and Draco wished he could cast a cleaning spell on it and the chair, but he knew better than to risk it in a Muggle place in front of Potter. Besides, he had more pressing matters.
“You were saying?” Harry whispered, stroking him. Drawing back, he smiled into Draco’s eyes. “Hang on.” And dipping his head, he teased the head of Draco’s cock with his tongue.
Draco bit his lip. “There are rather a lot of tedious calculations,” he said at last. “It’s one thing when you’re doing the first few sets, but you have to check and recheck results because others base their research on your findings, so you can ruin large projects if you’re not accurate. It’s rather a lot of pressure.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “It’s just where I happened to be when I noticed it, Weasley. There’s no need to get your knickers in a twist.”
Draco bit his lips. "What if you got out? I mean, maybe working for the Ministry isn't a good fit for you."
Draco allowed himself to be dragged to a Muggle establishment full of beat-up books on even shabbier bookshelves. There were odd paintings on the wall and the Muggles serving the drinks had unnaturally bright hair and more earrings than one ear should hold. But Potter seemed happy there, and it suited Draco's purposes to have Potter's guard down.
"Not much," Potter said quietly. "He said he'd listen to my ideas and see what he could do about reducing the paperwork, the meetings. Maybe crowd source some ideas from the department."
"Mm, now that's better," Harry said as he pulled back. "No more secrets. You were holding back last time."
." Her dramatic impression of Draco was rather accurate. "I think he's hoping to talk Harry out of it. In any event, they are spending more and more time together." She gave Narcissa a meaningful look. "Getting along."
Draco felt a prickle of irritation. What was that supposed to mean? Of course just the two of them. Sure they had never had drinks alone despite having several mutual friends. Sure they didn't even speak to each other when they were out for drinks as a group. But that was no reason to question Draco's perfectly normal and polite invitation. He gave his best indignant look and was pleased to see Potter's suspicion melt away.
Pansy snorted inelegantly. "Please. Harry is almost as smitten as Draco is." Hermione gave her a look Narcissa couldn't decipher, but Pansy waved her off. "It's not a betrayal of trust. Anyone with eyes knows that Harry wants him. He brings him chocolate!"
Potter pursed his lips as he nodded. "Good. Let's find out if we can be friends, eh, Malfoy?" He smirked. "With an opening for more later on?"
The thought of Potter rotting away in Azkaban made Draco's stomach twist far more than the thought of him turning evil. Not that it had anything to do with Draco never seeing him again were he to be imprisoned. Nothing at all.
He looked over at Hermione, wishing he could be angry with her for not telling him sooner, for being better at his own chart than he was, or for not having an elf like a proper witch. Instead, he found himself wishing she would tell him it would be all right.
Harry cared if he was happy? Draco quashed the surge of triumph. Perhaps it was time to make it clear that he would only remain happy if Harry didn’t become a megalomaniac Dark Lord. But how to say it?
Harry shrugged. “If it’s any consolation, Neville could have been the Chosen One but for sheer luck.”
They arrived at the lifts and evidently his hesitation had been off-putting because Potter’s expression was indecipherable. The lift came moments later and, as usual, was crowded. Draco and Potter managed to squeeze in, however.
Harry surged forward, his tongue probing at Draco’s lips, urging them open. Draco readily complied, shivering as Harry’s hand slid under his robes and shirt to caress his skin.
"I'm serious! Aurors are too expensive to have their time wasted. All the training you go through is funded by the government. The Minister doesn't want all that funding to be spent training paper pushers. He had a task force that was rooting out corruption after the war. Now that a few years have passed, I'll bet they are in need of new projects. Making better use of Auror time would help
Turning to stare into his eyes, Draco relaxed. So what if Longbottom could become a Dark Lord? He wasn’t one yet, and Harry was there to save them all if necessary. He’d saved Draco, after all. “Yes,” he said smiling. “I think it is.”
She didn't. She simply ran from the room and made her own whooshing sound as she presumably went in search of Harry.
Draco rubbed his face and growled. "I didn't...I was just...I wanted to make sure you weren't going to turn into a Dark Lord and instead...instead I was dating you and I realised I liked it, dating you and...I might, I might be falling in love with you."
After three days of Harry ignoring his owls and avoiding him at the Ministry, Draco had been grateful for the distraction his mother's invitation for tea offered. It wouldn't be an exciting afternoon, but it would pass faster than staring morosely out the window and silently cursing every bird that flew by for not bringing word from Harry.
Sighing, she perched on the edge, crossing her legs and letting her ridiculously high-heeled shoe dangle from her toe. “I came because I’m worried about you, actually.”
Draco blushed and busied himself with sipping his tea. He could swear that the room still smelled like sex despite the three air cleansing charms he and Harry had cast. But they had at least not stained the ancient fabric on the sofa cushions or the Persian rug. Their hands clasped on Draco's thigh, Harry squeezed Draco's hand and smiled. "So am I."
"It's all ancient," Draco muttered. He pulled toward the sofa because it would be more comfortable. "But no...just a blow job, okay? I don't trust my mother."
By the time Draco sat, Pansy had regained her aplomb. “Every time I think I have him figured out, he surprises me,” she said.
Draco leaned close to Potter. “Potter, if you need to talk more we can go back to that coffee place—”
She half smiled and settled back into her chair, angled toward said Gryffindor. Longbottom was greeting everyone, having just come in, but he was eyeing their table. "He's nice, Draco. And for all that he prefers to spend his days communing with plants, he's got a solid future. And he...likes me."
Uh oh. That didn't sound good. Was Potter going to turn evil simply because he was bored with bureaucratic monotony? He had always been digging around for trouble and attention at school, so it was possible.
Just then, as if summoned, Longbottom approached. Handing Pansy a drink, he slid into the booth beside her. “Here you are,” he said to her. He smiled at Draco. “Hullo, Malfoy.”
Stepping closer, he saw that Granger had scratched out his numbers in several places and substituted her own. The women silently stepped aside as he pored over the chart. The chart was completely different. He looked to the top and saw his mistake in an instant. The name. He had fucked up the name. He felt his cheeks heat and was sure he was blushing an unattractive shade of pink.
When Draco got back to his office, he collapsed in his chair and sighed. He had more calculations to do, but— Eyeing his work, he resolutely scooped it up into a neat pile for the next day before rising to go home and get ready for the pub. I should be there to keep him distracted, Draco decided. Keeping Potter off his Dark path was worth a bit of extra work later on.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to give me details,” he said. “But surely you can talk about things that generally dissatisfy you. There must be something about the Unspeakables you would change if you could. Or are you trying to say that you’ve found the perfect job?”
“Was there something you wanted, Malfoy?” Weasley’s arms were crossed, his lips pursed disapprovingly.
Pansy tapped her finger against her glass, eyes narrowed. "This distinctly feels like school. I thought you and Harry had moved past all that."
"Here. I'll start. I'm working hard to become an Unspeakable. It's a lot of research and calculations, which can be very time-consuming, but it's worth it whenever I discover something new. There. Now, your turn."
"There is no spell for seeing who used a person's wand. None. I've looked. After the final battle, I researched wandlore. It's confusing, but fascinating."
Maybe Potter had followed up on the Minister’s invitation to see him at any time. He could be putting the Minister under Imperius right then, manipulating the government from the top down. It'd be easy to do for Potter. After the war with You-Know—no, Draco corrected himself. After the war with
Draco wanted to keep Potter talking, but he suspected if he pressed, Potter would leave and Draco wouldn't see him for weeks, if again. "What about the Falcons’ chances this weekend?"
There had to be some way around it, Draco thought as he took the lift to Potter's floor. Maybe instead of killing and torturing, Potter could just levy heavy taxes and squander public funds. That was still evil, right? Maybe Gryffindor Dark Lords were inherently different.
Harry smiled, pulling him into the alleyway behind the restaurant. “You just seemed hesitant, is all.” Gently tucking a lock of hair behind Draco’s ear, Harry leaned close. “Although I think I may have to insist on a kiss or I may go mad—”
"It can't be all that bad," Draco argued. "Clearly some of the new regulations are helping, like with Byrnes."
Both girls looked solemn, but Pansy still managed to grab another biscuit. "Yes, well, there is that."
Draco pursed his lips together and thought. He couldn't just haul Potter off for a private interrogation, either. He knew better than to get on the bad side of a Dark Lord—even if Potter wasn't one yet—and interrogating him would be perceived as threatening. No, Draco had to take a subtle approach. He would tease out the information without Potter suspecting a thing.
"Let's go get a pint. I'm sure that report can wait until tomorrow." Theo was always leaving reports half-done when Draco needed entertaining and Pansy was being particularly bitchy.
Harry stood abruptly and stormed from the room. She followed the noise up the stairs and down the hall to his bedroom where he slammed the door in her face. She could undo any locking charm he could cast, but she respected his wishes and left the door closed.
He stepped out of the lift onto the second floor and came to a halt. It was after hours, but the Auror Office was never empty. Did Draco really want to be questioning Potter in front of witnesses? Witnesses that would surely arrest him if it came to light that Potter intended to take over the Ministry and possibly the world.
Wiping the sneer off his lips, he followed the voice to a hallway and down to a study where Pansy and Granger were bent over some parchment. Draco looked further down the hallway toward the kitchen. Was Weasley in his favourite room?
Harry hummed in what had to be encouragement, and with a gasp and a shudder, Draco’s orgasm welled up, making him arch his back and spill down Harry’s throat.
Harry was waiting for him just outside the bathroom, and the moment Draco came though, Harry drew him close, kissing him. “You’re gorgeous. Shall we go?”
Hermione stepped out of the flames into Grimmauld Place and found Harry collapsed on the sofa with his head in his hands.
Draco shifted in his seat as Potter kept looking at him. Had Draco done something wrong earlier? He thought it had gone...well, it hadn't been all good, but he hadn't said anything really bad either. Had he? Or maybe he should have offered right away to go back to Potter's coffee place after the meeting instead of waiting like he had.
That was Draco: too clever to be careful and constantly hampered by the mistakes of his own impatience.
Potter shrugged. "Being an Auror isn't quite what I expected. Tonnes more paperwork and endless meetings that don't seem to accomplish anything. It can be pretty frustrating at times. I thought there would be more field time and that the field time would be more interesting."
Harry, looking just as nervous as Draco, nodded, but didn't say anything. Mother tutted. "Now, Harry. Draco has taken quite the liking to you and that means you might be my son-in-law in the future—" Draco dropped the cup he had just picked up, eyes wide, "—so don't feel intimidated at all."
“Excellent.” Shacklebolt turned back to Potter. “And I’m serious about what I said in my office, Harry. Come to me any time with suggestions.”
"You said 'one thing' and then you'd leave," Harry barked. The angry words stung, but it was the crack in his voice at the end that made her want to sink to the floor and cry for him.
Pansy nodded. "For months, they wouldn't even speak to each other on pub night, and now they are all but courting."
