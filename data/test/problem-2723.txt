"H-hey!" Harriet sputtered but Malfoy just lifted a graceful hand up in interruption, but then just as gracefully folded it into a bow, bowing one time in the direction of each of the Gryffindor girls.
Lavender scoffed, "Oh, like I haven't seen you enjoy arguing with Miss Malfoy. She'd be fuming to find out you got in the quidditch team thanks to her efforts."
Hermione sighed with weariness odd in an eleven year old, "I asked my parents to send this when the prank was planned. I figured there wasn't much that could go wrong with something as harmless as a bucket of beets," and she waved her arm around at the damaged bathroom, "obviously I was wrong about
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry finally released her piercing gaze to roll her eyes to the ceiling, "Are you ready to tell me what happened yesterday? When your mum shunted me away?"
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"How big is this place?" Harriet said with awe.
Albus grinned widely, "Thank you, old friend."
She needed to say something. She needed to
Pansy's exasperated sigh brought Draco back to the present as the girl slid in next to her with a small bounce on the green velvet settee, "You're not spending time overthinking Harry not being in Slytherin again."
Hermione was still lying on the floor and said a little dismissively, "You do realize we have chests full of all sorts of potions ingredients. Many of the plants can also make natural dyes."
Draco frowned and curled her finger in her hair, "You're right. I didn't think of it that way. I can't help but agree…but what would that mean for Harry? That the Dark Lord isn't dead? He'll obviously target her."
Parvati rolled her eyes and leaned over to whisper something to Draco, which Harriet could not hear. Draco turned and hissed back to Parvati, "You better," and Parvati just grinned a little wickedly.
I tried my best with British slang, though I apologize if I have a hard time escaping Americaisms. This will be quite canon divergent if you can tell, and there will be a trans character because fuck you Jo.
Parvati squeezed her hand and smiled kindly, "Thank you for sharing with us."
Parvati argued back, "They told her her parents died drunk driving! They never told her she was magical at all! She had no idea she was even Indian!"
Harriet changed the subject, "Did you put the cloth on my face?"
Also for those who don't know flowers: the Narcissus family of flowers contain daffodils and their relatives. Our dearly departed author likes flower names for some reason.
them."
Parvati's grandmother, who insisted Harriet call her Dadi, closed her hands on top of Harriet's own on the cloth, "A beautiful girl should have beautiful clothes."
Thanks to Anra7777 for helping me out and reading all my iterations, and Zaharya on the Drarry discord for giving good advice.
Nicolas nodded, and they continued their walk up to the third floor. He smiled in thought and looked out at the forest in the window. Hogwarts did have beautiful grounds, "Ah. So she loves. Good, good."
"Oh, Sweet Hecate. Nicolas Flamel wants to meet you!"
Draco just gave her usual smug look. Ugh.
The girls snuck away from Melody leading all the Gryffindors back up the dorm. She was thankfully pretty laissez-faire for being in charge, or at least she was constantly distracted by the Weasley twins to not pay much mind to sweet little first year girls, so they figured they wouldn't be missed much anyways.
Harriet tilted her head, "What happened to the scarred boy in the last photo? He was a prefect, right?"
Hermione looked up at the staff table, "So does that mean Professor Dumbledore is gay?"
"I was an odd ball and my first was that I just knew what my 6th birthday present was before I opened it, and I've had premonitions mostly in terms of dreams. But you know, seers blood, good intuition," Lavender said.
Lavender whispered, "Did it work?"
Hermione put her hand on top of Harriet's and said gently, "Maybe he is just interested in the game?"
Weasley looked a little conspiratorial and said in an exaggerated whisper, "Don't you think talking about Gryffindor taking the cup is a little dangerous here?"
Draco grumbled and glared.
"Yes. Transgender. It's nice to see muggles use a little Latin at least. Anyways. Transgender. It's rare, sure, but not unheard of. My great-great aunt Octavius Malfoy Lovegood was one. She was a properly respectable charms inventor and had three children who went on to notable careers. All perfectly respectable."
Pansy grinned and kissed Draco's cheek, "Ta ever so."
Harry shrugged, "Does Jiaolong count as one?"
and actually
"Right, Lucius? Draco had made a terrible mistake, but she is in a position to make things better. It is wonderful having Harry here. Isn't it, Lucius?"
Hope you all are being safe out there. Happy Hanukkah to those that observe it!
Harriet thought she might have seen one of the black pawns wink at her. She decided instead of asking about that, to speak about her original goal, "Were you able to find anything?"
Nicholas tutted, "Now now. You can't be that upset about Miss Potter's drive. This has given you a perfect opportunity to show off to me. What could possibly upset you?"
"Oh my god. That was amazing!" Harriet grinned widely.
Draco was forced to go stumbling out from behind Harry with an internal groan and reminder about how Harry was such a terrible influence, before she saw her father turn his head to look at them, and then that same thought of Harry's bad influence had less affection attached and more pain instead. She bit her lip and looked away.
"Uh huh. And you're definitely not kicking yourself for fancying her again."
"Huh…"
still ringing in her head.
Bathilda Bagshot?" Hermione who was looking quite skeptical earlier, seemed to warm up with that.
Harriet pulled out a bottle of rose petals in liquid, "Would this work?"
It had been about half a century since Nicholas Flamel had last visited Hogwarts. With the startling speed of the world shifting around him, it appeared that the view of the castle had remained relatively unchanged. It was oddly refreshing. He spotted his student, the once fresh faced boy with bright blue eyes, who absorbed his lessons with rapt attention, now standing at the open gates in expectation was an old man. Though he was still just as flamboyant, dramatic, and a touch mischievous.
Oh god. Pity.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "Yes yes. Because the magical world doesn't have its own set of prejudices."
Seamus crowed, "Well good! Snape can't totally destroy our chance of winning!"
He unlocked the door with a click and opened his palm to let the key join back with the rest of flock before they entered the next room.
Harriet hummed, "Too easy. We need something that lasts a little longer."
Whatever denial Neville tried to make was lost by Pomfrey spinning away. Harriet heard the clinking of bottles a bit aways.
"I could have continued feeling terrible in my own body, and I would have been safe from violence or criticism or rejection from everyone I love. In the muggle world, people like me have been kicked out of their homes, or locked in the muggle equivalent of St. Mungo's Permanent Spell Damage wards, and many are beaten and murdered. For people like me, living genuinely is dangerous."
Now, back to the topic of Slytherin and pureblood supremacy. There was probably nothing wrong with making powerful friends and allies per se. There is certainly merit to her parents wishing her to make friends with those destined for Slytherin, as it can't hurt to have talented allies and Slytherins seemed to sport more. But then her new friends in Gryffindor were talented in their own right, and she couldn't exactly call Greg or Vince the cream of the crop exactly.
Harriet and Hermione both laid back down and properly placed the cucumber slices back over their eyes. Hermione explained, "They help to moisturize the delicate skin around the eyes and remove swelling." She added, "plus it's tradition for face masks."
Draco breathed out in relief. Her mother had always been a true Slytherin. She knew exactly how to get the outcome she desired, and would do what needed to be done to do it. She saw how important Harry was to Draco, and with Harry's ultimatum about visiting the Flamels in place, she was sure her mother would keep it a secret, even to Father. With as much confidence as she could muster, she answered, "Yes. She would."
Madam Pomfrey took the smallest of gasps, and asked with great concern, "Your killing curse scar?"
Draco was still frowning, but was reasonably mollified, "Fine. Fine! But I'm holding you to it.
I can't wait until this election business is over. Thankfully me and my family are use to covid standards and not leaving the house. Yay for not leaving the house!
Hermione shook her head, "No. Nothing. There's just a great deal of prejudice when it comes to gender and sexuality. Anything out of the arbitrary rules of normality is punished. Nothing to do with magic."
Albus hummed non-committally.
"You'll stay here for the remainder of the day and will most likely be released to your room this evening."
"Queen of Snakes? Is there such a thing?"
"I actually don't think your chances are all that terrible. She's so stuck in heteronormality that she doesn't even think it's a possibility, but that doesn't mean she's not potentially bent. Plus she has a bit of a weird fixation with you, even further a bit odd as she doesn't really pay much attention to anyone outside of a small handful of people. Just give her time. She's young, coming from an abusive and repressive home. She's going to need time to heal and figure herself out. But personally I think your chances are good that it eventually becomes mutual between the two of you."
Melody replied, "Oh. You'll all fit in one."
"Snape is going to be reffing the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff game."
The other girls started pulling nightgowns out of their trunks and pulling them on, and Harriet did the same.
"Hmm?" Harriet bit into her sandwich.
Why did Draco have to be so smitten! She hated it!
Draco bristled, pulled automatically into defensive positioning, "Why are you asking?"
During their teas, Draco so wished to speak to Mother all about Jiaolong and therefore all her conclusions about Slytherin house's origins and pureblood superiority. She also couldn't speak about her worries and fear of the Dark Lord at Hogwarts. As much as she felt it would be best to get some form of adult attention, she also knew how difficult it was to gain Harry's trust in the first place. Draco didn't want to risk that trust in even the slightest.
Hermione and Milly both seemed a little hesitant to answer, and Harriet said to them, "You don't need to tell me."
Harriet remembered the spray of all the bits of objects littering Dumbledore's desk and back, but none came close to them. It did seem odd. She knew deep down that she would feel terrible if Draco or Hermione had ever gotten hurt because of her. Harriet felt happy she was the one to protect them, that even at her worst, she still kept them safe, accidental magic or not. There was still an insidious voice that repeated that Harriet was a worthless freak that would amount to nothing, but as she was starting to recognize that voice sounded more and more like Aunt Petunia, Harriet chose to believe in her friends. Maybe there was something there. That she was special and important, even if it was only to these girls, and that in itself felt pretty damn good.
Ron shrugged, still smiling, "Well if they're out there, they deserve an award. Special services to society at large."
Draco lifted her hand to check absent-mindedly and when she discovered the moisture, blushed furiously and scrubbed at her face vigorously. "S-shut up!" she stammered, glaring much more forcefully.
Draco threw her hands up in exasperation, "She looked like a crazed homeless person the first time I met her! Do you even remember what she wore on the train?! I know I'm not usually up on muggle fashion trends, but I'm pretty sure clothing from 15 years ago and four sizes too big isn't the trend."
Warnings for Harriet having anxiety attacks over canon abuse and neglect and Dumbledore being an massive asshole.
Hermione huffed with a great deal of exasperation, "Pull yourself together. Since you like Harriet so much, you need to do what you can to protect her. And since you're ever so clever, that means you've got to pull your head out of the dark crevasse you put it in and think!"
Harriet was left a touch bemused at Hermione's firm show of support along with her appearance, "What was that about? Has she been crying?"
Parvati placed her hand on Harriet's and said fiercely, "It's not as well publicized among the general magical population, but at least among the magical Indian community we're quite proud of you. When we get settled I'll tell you everything I know."
Harry laughed, "Not really. Though there was that one time they put itching powder in all the Quidditch uniforms. But it was terrible flying weather and I don't think Oliver would have let us skip practice otherwise. Oliver made them polish the locker room with toothbrushes as punishment, but rumor was they used Percy's to do it."
"What do you want," Draco snapped.
Pansy filed her nails and hummed distractedly.
The three were silent, but Draco finally said, much subdued, "I've heard people say my family sided with him, but my parents don't really talk about it. Mother told me once that the Dark Lord was terrifyingly powerful. That you had to make a choice to either align with him or die. But she only said that once. Most of the time I get things like 'you're too young for such talk,' and 'that's better discussed when you're older.' My father has never told me anything. I heard he was imperioused from outside sources, but he has never spoken on it. Never."
Harriet shrugged and asked again, "So did he?"
"Anytime, Miss Potter. Anytime."
What was more interesting, at least to Harriet, was the different perspectives on the whole experience of that evening.
There was no sound coming from the office outside of the scratch of quill on parchment, so Harriet felt safe to knock.
Harriet winced a bit. Maybe she should check up on Neville once in a while. He seemed to have been having a bad go at Hogwarts so far.
And the mystery of the cursed broom, Harry scar pain were incredibly worrying, and now Jiaolong's not quite direct assertions of the Dark Lord's continued existence threw things over the edge.
Hermione continued seriously, "In terms of You-Know-Who's existence, I have been thinking more about the meeting with Dumbledore."
After Draco gave what had to be another undignified squeak, and then growled deeply, "Oh. It's on."
With a nod from Albus, Nicolas approached the table and read the puzzle and the bottles. It took him a few minutes to narrow down the options but picked up the particular potion in question.
Harry asserted, "No. I don't want to tell your dad."
(See the end of the chapter for
Lavender grinned widely, excited to add to the gossip, "My brother told me about that, too. They say the DADA position is cursed. A student got such poor grades in it, their dark witch mother cursed the position so that the teacher at the time wouldn't last the year. And since then, no teacher has been able to last more than one year."
(See the end of the chapter for
Mother did pull her aside at one point, while Harry was absorbed into one of her books, not to discuss the muggleborn in front of her father.
Ron sniped, "Of course you'd say that, you snake."
Draco said flippantly, "Yes yes. We know you're a Gryffindor."
Draco was a bit of a sight once she had finally found some focus. Her pointy aristocratic face was pushed and distorted by the pillow, and her mouth was open, a puddle of drool pooling on the fabric. All of the pompous arrogance had been replaced by such ridiculous and rather disgusting vulnerablity. It was cute.
"Indeed."
“Why didn’t you tell me?”  Draco’s voice was so soft and uncertain that the tone caught Harry’s attention as much as his words.  Looking up, he found Draco’s eyes bright and guarded.  His body was so tense it almost vibrated.  Was he just trying to understand, or was there even a chance that Draco might be interested in him, might want him, too?
He has come.
He replayed Parkinson's words carefully and realised that everything rested on one issue. 'How does he feel?'
If Sothman were Draco's boss, Draco would find it far harder to slip away or use work as an excuse.  Even worse, Sothman would have direct control over Draco's career.  A fact that Sothman was sure to use to his advantage.
plan. Obviously. One doesn't just fuck a virginal Harry Potter. There are phases! Infiltration, Development of Trust, Romance, and Seduction." He ticked each phase off on a finger to help her understand. "I'm in Phase One: Education."
"Give him space."
Draco's eyes were still wary as he searched Harry's face. 'Have you been drinking?'
Harry chided himself as he forced his thoughts to the flowerbed beside him.  The daffodils had finally bloomed, and he fondly recalled his friends arguing as Hermione had planted the bulbs last autumn. Ron had mocked the flowers for not doing anything, but Hermione had insisted on having Muggle flowers among Ron’s twinkling Fairieflowers and his gently purring Calilillies.
Harry was elated.  He'd arrived in Bramblethorn just in time to join Ron and Neville as they tailed the assistant out of the small village's central pub.  The man had inadvertently led them straight to a  derelict house set among the trees on Loch nam Fear's eastern side.
Draco considered Granger's bushy hair and Weasley's garish red hair.  Even Longbottom's sandy blonde hair never seemed to sit quite right.  “Do you simply collect unusual hair?” he drawled.
Harry was nervous about visiting Luna, but it was long overdue.  She had attended his house warming party, his Christmas party, and been over for dinner several times, yet he had never even
And why did Draco feel disappointed?  Wasn't his interest just the same?
A short chat with Reggie not only provided Harry with a delicious raisin scone, it confirmed that the controlled ingredients not going to St Mungo's were going to Slug and Jigger in Diagon Alley. The shops on Knockturn couldn’t get the Ministry license to carry them, and the little shops scattered around the countryside tended to stick to the most conventional ingredients. Harry sent a Patronus with his findings to Ron.
Draco was surprised into a laugh.
They had a huge manor house and only one hotel guest to avoid. Draco gestured Merryn over and instructed her to set up dessert in the library. She looked surprised at first, probably since the library was part of his rooms in the North Wing and not technically part of the hotel. It was also rarely used by anyone but Draco—Gwenna preferred to send Totty to collect books for her and Draco’s mother rarely left her own floor—so they were guaranteed privacy.
“Oh, I know who you are, Mr Malfoy. And you, Mr Potter.” She winked at Potter, who had only stood for a moment when Draco had and then immediately sat again.
The knife clattered to the counter before Potter span around to stare at Draco with dark eyes and pink cheeks. His lips were wet and slightly parted leaving Draco no choice but to kiss him. Potter's hands grabbed at his shirt, pulling him close with a desperation Draco hadn't expected.
Malfoy waved his hand as if ridding them of bad Quidditch teams. “Anyway, I just wanted to get a sense of your colouring. Now we can talk about the types of clothing you need. I assume you are here for a complete wardrobe overhaul and not just a pair of jeans to wear with your collection of oversized t-shirts and home-knit jumpers.”
"So is everything set for Friday? Your party. He
creepy. He shrugged awkwardly instead.
"Two weeks left," Potter said in his ear. When Draco twisted around, Potter was smiling at him. "Buy you a drink?"
to hurt Potter, even if he couldn't deny the thrill his new-found power gave him.  His mother had once said something about knowing which powers to use and which to hold, and he wished he'd paid more attention.
Draco shook his head at the idea of the cleverest witch of their age with anyone less than brilliant, but he supposed Hermione was never going to find anyone to match her intellect. And it must be rather flattering to be the one person who could distract Oliver Wood from Quidditch. And Oliver was rather fit, especially in those tight leather—
Malfoy paused for only an instant before he pressed back eagerly. Soon they were grabbing at each other, pulling each other closer and closer as their mouths met again and again. The smell of lilacs was gone, replaced by the overwhelming awareness of Malfoy. Harry could taste Malfoy's breath, the very air within him, and it left him craving more. He wanted to
. . . with me?' He struggled to make sense of the sentence. He knew all of the words, and yet couldn't understand that particular arrangement.
Potter’s eyes widened a moment later as he finally caught on. “Right.”
And with that, Harry Apparated away.
tea?”
“Meh.  They don't care what we wear, just so long as we get the job done.”
In any event, it was Monday morning and Draco had a new boss to earn favour with, so he slipped from bed and headed for the shower.  He certainly needed it.
past. I thought the worst because of mine." Harry waited until Draco met his gaze, grey eyes full of confusion. "Since Ginny and I broke up, I haven’t had a single good relationship. People want gold or fame or to satisfy their curiosity. They think I’m some sort of god, so they either live in delusion or are sorely disappointed when they begin to get to know me." He begged with his eyes for Draco to understand. "You’ve never thought I was special."
Fucking hell. These people needed a house elf.
Harry smiled and nodded as Hermione went on about the layout of the grounds and architecture of the building that had probably been a grand private residence at some point but now made a charming hotel just a ten minute stroll from the beach.
As the weeks ticked by, more people came out of the woodwork. There was a woman who had been working at Flourish and Blotts for two decades, always hoping her vast knowledge of magical fiction and history would disguise her lack of magical ability. There was the witch who wrote about her worry for her ten-year-old son who had shown no sign of magic and probably wouldn’t get a letter from Hogwarts the next year. She told Gabby the interviews with Merryn and Jowan had given her hope for her son’s future for the first time.
get dressed. Or we could test your concentration.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Yes. You owe Neville for that, so no more grief about walking in on us."
When they finally pulled apart enough to breathe—their hands still holding each other tight and their mouths still close enough to share air—Harry felt cold touches on his cheeks and forehead. Pulling back slightly more, he realised it was snowing. Fat, wet flakes were falling down on them through the clearing of branches overhead, melting on their skin like ice cold kisses.
Draco couldn't ask Potter to clarify with a mouth full of cock.
“You okay?”
* * *
Draco told him to fuck off, but he didn't mean it.
* * *
Draco wanted to make Harry wait. He wanted him to squirm and suffer in payment for the months of confusion and hurt he’d put Draco through. Yes, Draco had matured, but he hadn’t changed completely. He still had his pride.
Draco could have pointed out that he had been ignoring Potter as much as Potter had ignored him, but he really just wanted the conversation over with. He directed Potter to the jazz station and then ignored the look Potter gave him that suggested he had more to say.
Potter dropped his gaze to the floor and ran a hand up the back of his neck. “Maybe it should have mattered two days ago,” he murmured.
On the wall
He eagerly opened his mouth and wrapped it around Draco's cock. It was hot and rested heavily against his tongue, filling his mouth and stretching his lips. Draco's hands threaded into his hair and tugged at him almost painfully. His cock twitched at the discomfort, and he decided that he definitely had a kinky side to discover.
"Can we stop talking about Hermione's career and do more kissing?"
“I’m not sure what to make of that.” Malfoy was clearly trying for disinterested, but his voice betrayed how much he cared. “Are you mocking me or attempting”—his cheeks turned a deeper pink and his eyes darted away before meeting Harry’s again—“to flirt.”
like a whole other lifetime. "Besides, he spoke for me at my trial, so he's clearly over all that. Age and circumstance, remember?"
Harry arrived at the ball immediately after work. If he didn't come right from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he wouldn't come at all. He didn't care if his uniform robes looked shoddy next to the latest designer robes from Paris or Milan. He never promised Kingsley he'd be fashionable, only that he'd be present.
“Vienna.  With Edwards’ mother, Fiona.”
Then Potter fell ill.
Maybe it wasn't enough? He quickly added a second finger and Potter clamped down on him.
Draco just laughed. "Now I know how to keep you in line." He composed his face in all it’s haughty glory. "My mother will hear about this!" With a cackle and a wink, he was gone, leaving Harry hoping he was kidding.
Sometimes it is hard to bear witness, but sometimes it fills her heart with joy.
"Come back to England with me," he pleaded into her hair. "They are so dreadful. Don’t make me go back alone."
Oh, for god's sake! "Potter, I took a girl—a childhood friend—to a ball when I was fourteen. That does not a heterosexual make."
“I was wondering if...I’m hoping...will you be my date?”
With his eyes closed, Draco gave himself over to the heat and firmness of the body in his arms. Potter made tiny gasps whenever Draco squeezed his arse or thrust their groins together. When they closed their lips in their kiss, they made a smacking sound that sent a shiver down Draco's spine.
"Look up."
The first few weeks, Draco had foolishly believed that he might hear from Potter. The Boy-Who-Wouldn't-Die had visited Draco at the Manor just after the war to return his wand and warn him that the Aurors were considering arresting him. Draco's father had been arrested while they were still at Hogwarts, but Draco and his mother had been permitted to return to the Manor.
Thuban glanced at Harry, who gave a startled bow. The dragon huffed at him before turning and stalking back to his cave. Both wizards stood stock-still for long moments before Draco returned to Harry’s side and led him away.
Having left the girls with two elves to help them to their temporary room, Pomfrey turned her attention to Draco and Potter. She handed Draco a case of potions. “As I told the girls, these are only to help with the symptoms. Death’s Mask cures itself once it’s run its course.”
on the lights. Two more days of sleepy smiles, sitting close, and quiet conversation. Worst of all, two more days of Potter stepping out of the bathroom with nothing on but a towel and smiling that little smile of his from underneath damp black hair.
her. Right away!
He felt his heart pounding in his chest and worried about the effect the night was having his health. Working as an Auror in the field wasn't usually this stressful.
“What? No ‘Harry’, Draco?” Harry cooed.
* * *
Draco's hearing's was near the end of June, three weeks after his birthday, and Draco hated himself for the rush of relief he had felt as Potter had marched into the courtroom with his careless grace and declared himself to be a witness for the defence. Draco wanted to feel embarrassed to be seen shackled to the chair as if he were any threat without a wand. Or any threat at all. He wanted to still have enough pride that he would rather be sentenced  to life in Azkaban than be helped by his former rival. Instead, he could only try to keep his face impassive when Potter turned to nod at him.
Harry to find him adorable?
Malfoy looked smug as he asked for Harry’s opinion.
”  Draco scowled as he crossed his arms protectively across himself.  Harry wished they were his arms instead.
." This was all too much to process. Death was quite a lot to process just on its own without Harry Potter fucking kissing him. Willingly. Twice!
“Fine.  I accept.”
It was surprisingly thoughtful question. Perhaps Potter realised that close quarters required best behaviour.
"From his virginity."
The door swung open and Harry found himself looking up into the sharp grey eyes of Draco Malfoy.
The drink must have aggravated his temper.  “Let's get you home, Potter,” he said as he led Potter to the Floo.  He sent Potter through first and followed immediately after repeating, “Buddleia Cottage,” in a much clearer voice than Potter had.  He stepped out of the Floo to find Potter face down on a rather nice looking rug.
What the fuck had Harry been up to that day? Draco had only been out of the house for a standard eight hour workday. Harry was meant to be at work as well, fighting Dark wizards and making the wizarding world feel safe. When had he found the time to collect this...this...was it a common cat? Surely if Harry insisted on bringing some shedding, pooping, needy pet into his home he would chose something highly intelligent and completely magical. Even as Draco thought it, he knew that Harry would
Draco started to fight again.  “Put me down, Blaise!  Get your hands off me!”
The photograph on the front of the brochure showed grassy crags dropping down to a sandy beach and bright blue water. The photographs inside the brochure were all of food: full English fry up, a platter of fluffy scones with clotted cream and pots of jam, a meat pie with flaky pastry, a plate piled with shellfish, and a close-up of the chocolate cake Ron was probably still fantasising about. It was only on the back that Harry finally found an image of the hotel itself: a side view showing a large stone building that opened onto a patio and then a well-manicured lawn framed with flowering trees and shrubs. Beyond the garden, over a low stone wall that looked as old as Hogwarts, the sea shone in the sunshine.
Harry could barely hear Draco’s murmured chants over the rush of the shower, but he felt Draco’s pleasure building in the way his fingers tightened in Harry’s hair and his hips lost their perfect rhythm. Harry tasted Draco’s skin and the water and, finally, Draco’s release. He gripped Draco’s hips to hold him steady as Draco panted against the wall of the shower.
“Do you usually feed the birds?”
him.”
He had been in the middle of his weekly,
"You seem fairly certain that he'll be receptive to your advances." Pansy was looking at the sugar cubes she was adding to her tea, but Draco knew she was faking her nonchalance. She'd become almost as fond of discussing Potter as Draco was.
Draco’s hands were smooth but his touch was firm. Harry found himself rocking his hips in time with each stroke, wanting to match Draco’s rhythm and follow his lead. Draco seemed pleased, mumbling fond words and making appreciative sounds.
The rest of the table smiled at him kindly and went about making their own conversation. Harry felt happy to no longer be the centre of attention and made his excuses as soon as he'd finished eating. “Long day and all that.” He was dismissed with a nod and a smile from Charlie and headed for the door.
Draco walked up to the large wooden door of the old manor house. Either side of it, warm lights glowed from the windows promising loved ones waiting within. He knew it was silly, but Draco couldn’t resist. He rapped his knuckles smartly on the solid wood. Soon the silent evening was interrupted by quick footsteps and muffled talking.
"One too many?" Draco teased.
"I'll keep fighting," Potter promised, and Draco didn't know why he cared. Draco cared—more than he should—by why did Potter? And maybe he really didn't. Maybe that is why Draco is still in his cell.
he thought as he dug through his trunk for his wash bag and clean clothes.
He considered discussing the Shaw case, but it wasn't safe to discuss an open case in public, even in a Muggle establishment.  In the end, he brought up Quidditch, and they discussed the British club teams until their pies were brought out.  He was nervous about whether Draco would like such common Muggle food, but a comment about the tenderness of the lamb and the delicacy of the sauce calmed Harry immensely.
He knew it would be midday by that point and that he ought to eat before he started his long flight up into the mountains. His stomach, which felt like it was up in his throat, did not support that idea, and he doubted he could keep anything down. He staggered away from the fireplace and made his way along the wall to a wooden table that felt cool and stable against his cheek. He was almost asleep when he heard a woman’s voice above him.
. You hear me? If the
“Thank you, Draco.  You're so sweet!”  She hastily signed each form without glancing at what they were.  “Here you are!  After you file those, why don't you take a long lunch?”
He pushed open the door to their flat and looked around for his flatmate.  “Draco?”  No reply.  He walked through the flat to the hallway that led to their rooms.  Draco’s door was open.  “Draco?”  Lonely silence was all that replied.  Harry tried to tell himself he was too tired to feel disappointed.  He stumbled to his room, emptied his Shrunken trunk and wand from his pocket and threw himself on the bed.  Despite his fatigue, he felt too frustrated to sleep.
Harry wrinkled his brow. 'I did have the florist send a new centrepiece, but it's mainly irises, peonies—' Ron waved him off again. He did that a lot lately.
Merryn crossed her arms across her chest in complement to her smug grin. She reminded Harry of a young Hermione being praised by a professor. Her hair was just as wild, although darker, more like Harry’s own hair. The plump woman had lighter hair than Merryn, but stood side by side, Harry could see a family resemblance.
“I’ve come to buy some clothes.”
"It’s signed! They signed it! It’s passed!" Draco and Hermione shared a very bouncy hug before they ran over to hug Harry and Oliver.
Harry supposed that Ron saw another man with his hands on Harry's boyfriend, their bodies close and moving to intimate music. But Harry just saw Draco being happy. Harry couldn't dance like that, and he had no desire to try. He could do a simple two-step, and that was the only dance he needed. It worked for a slow song, and the last song was always slow.
“I’ve been busy.  We all have been.”
Harry did his best not to remember The Orphans’ Ball. He didn’t want to remember Malfoy’s earnest eyes or his warm skin. Malfoy had seemed sincere about helping Hermione, but he had also seemed sincere about Harry. And maybe he had been. Maybe he intended to keep Harry as a bit of fun on the side. Harry pushed aside thoughts of Malfoy naked and smiling down at him through pale strands of messy hair. This was about whether Malfoy wanted to help pass legislation regarding magical beasts. "I guess he does."
to be here. The house-elves would probably
had vilified him and he’d wished anyone would speak up for him. But in that moment, he wanted this bride to keep her wedding at Draco’s hotel.
So it was
hadn’t lied to anyone.
“Shut up, Potter.”
"Fuck. I didn't say—"
Potter took in a deep breath and set his fork down. “Malfoy. Draco.”
Three Fire-calls later, the little cottage was bustling with caterers and deliveries, and Harry was grateful for Ron's assistance. By the time the guests began to arrive, Harry's rustic home looked like a French château and two caterers were carrying around trays of champagne and canapés. Harry knew it was still a far cry from the opulence of Malfoy Manor, but he hoped it would provide a taste of the sumptuous lifestyle Draco was giving up by living in a cottage without house-elves.
“Yeah, I guess Rosie and I have a similar affliction.”
Harry shrugged. “You can put a mark on anyone. My godson has put on my Auror robes. It doesn’t make him an Auror.”
And it had to be
Harry glanced at Draco, who was frowning at the map. Then Draco shook his head. “No. Wales. Definitely Wales. Probably.” He muttered something about assuming all the plants were grown in the same place, but Harry decided to ignore it.
Harry feigned a pout. 'Is that all I am to you? A house-elf without the grief from Hermione?'
'Harry?'
Draco propped his head up on his hand to look over at him.  “I didn’t think you were interested in anything more.”
He was a virgin. Not just a
Draco’s head shot up at the use of his given name.
Harry’s mind was more than happy to continue the thought. Malfoy used charms on his trousers so his cock could hang free. Or get stiff. And no one would ever know. What was Malfoy’s cock doing at that moment? Hanging free? Filling up? He realised he was still staring at Malfoy’s crotch and pulled his eyes up to find grey ones full of mirth.
Draco bristled at being grouped with Weasley, but his curiosity spurred him on. "What are you—"
Okay, maybe it hadn't been phrased quite that way, but it was close enough.  Clearly Potter felt that he had made a sufficient show of being nice to satisfy his chivalrous need to buy dinner before a shag, and now he could stop pretending about what he really wanted Draco for.  Hadn't that been clear enough last night?
"You did it. I had a chat with Robards yesterday about how Ron was so great with tactics and people, and today, Robards named Ron his Deputy Head and successor!"
Malfoy turned heel and walked out of the room. “We leave for dinner in twenty minutes, Potter,” came drifting down the hall before there was the click of a door closing.
When his fingers were completely numb with cold, he stepped back into the cottage to see that the party in full swing without him.
Potter snorted. “Careful or you’ll turn into Hermione.”
Draco picked up the Curse quill report and pretended to read. "Goodbye, Vane. Some of us have work to do." Now wasn't the time to reflect on whether he and Potter were actually friends, and he certainly wasn't doing it with Vane around.
Harry laughed and shook his head.  “Someone’s barmy, but he wasn’t in Gryffindor.”  He kissed Draco’s furrowed brow and then his pouting lip.  “I love you, you know.”
the duvet. He felt pure relief with not even a tinge of disappointment. Really.
and call it a night. We can take it from here.”
It was still Draco's fault. If he had more experience he would know how to help Potter relax. He'd make it feel good. "I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm sorry."
Firm arms wrapped around his waist and Draco's low voice spoke in his ear. "The next dance is yours."
Ginger
“My hero,” Draco dead-panned.  It was lost on Potter, who turned to him with intense green eyes that spoke of outrage.
Harry was getting ready to argue when a woman’s voice spoke up. “You shouldn’t have to hide.”
“What?  You mean since she was held prisoner in my basement?  No.  I’m afraid we don’t exchange Christmas cards.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “You work for the Ministry?”
Despite his nerves, Harry's cock was hardening just from the intensity of Draco's leer. Why was he so nervous anyway? This was
“So it is.”  Harry looked happier and perhaps a bit smug as he turned to Draco.  “Have lunch with me?”  Draco wasn't sure whether Harry meant an actual meal or Apparating home for a quick shag.  Either sounded good, so he nodded.  “Excellent.  See you then.”  And then he leant forward and kissed Draco square on the lips in the middle of Substances and in front of Draco's boss.  Draco could already hear the murmur of gossip spreading in the distance.
Potter's kisses and rubs slowed along with his breathing until Draco realised he'd fallen asleep.  He carefully extricated himself from the tangle of limbs, removed Potter's shoes, and tucked the man into bed.  Lying fast asleep, Potter looked peaceful and surprisingly sweet.  Draco had never seen him look so young and vulnerable.
Malfoy's eyes widened and his hands came up in a gesture of submission. "I mean no harm. I don't exactly agree with her about house-elves, but I’ve come to see she has the right of it with werewolves. What I don't agree with is her approach. She isn't going to get things past the old establishment by harping on about how they should free their house-elves and how their children should play with werewolves."
Pansy patted her cheek fondly, "Don't worry, darling. I'm sure you'll continue to overthink things, and then react in the most awkward way possible."
into our house, no matter how infamous they might be. The Potter child will stay for tonight and tomorrow, but she will not return for this summer."
"N-no! I do not! I don't care about some Hufflepuff! As if!" Draco stammered and it took a bit, but the blush formed across her nose and on her ears.
Pansy laughed, mostly affectionately, "Thank Merlin you're such a swot. Our own bushy haired library." She continued with a bit more seriousness, biting her lip in a rare show of nervousness, "My immediate family stayed out of the war, though I had a few cousins on both sides. The ones fighting for the muggleborn side didn't make it. There was quite a bit of infighting and my parents told me it was actually quite difficult to remain neutral, but we're Slytherins. We're dedicated to survival. The side with the cousins that died don't talk to us much, but then neither do the ones that sided with the Dark Lord."
gave them a front page article complete with photograph. Draco had it framed on his desk.
Well two could play at that game.  Harry could ogle Malfoy's broad shoulders and pale skin.  He could run his eyes over his flat stomach and—Harry's thoughts were interrupted as his eyes fell between Draco's legs.
* * *
on Draco every time.
Potter wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, just as he had done so many time in the past three weeks, but this time there was a tenderness and familiarity that made Draco's stomach clench. The race would be over in minutes, but the possessive hand on his hip assured him that Potter would at least bring him tea at work on Monday, if he didn't simply beg Draco to stay over on Sunday night.
Albus called out, "Machintosh's Tooty Minties!" One of the keys, larger and of a slightly different color and wing pattern separated from the group and flew down into his waiting palm.
Oddly Harry had taken most well to the various tales of
go by Harry… but then it's associated with fame I had no real means of earning. My parents died and I'm famous for that? But I kind of hate my relatives and they would hate if I went by Harry, which I'd be all for… I find out I'm a witch, and I have a new name. It feels connected, you know? Maybe I could go by Harry."
Hermione laughed a bit.
"That's a load of shite."
There was breakfast and classes and Harriet got pulled into some afternoon quidditch practice: all the trappings of an average day in a magical boarding school. Once the girls got some private free time, they also converged on their room in the Gryffindor dorms, Draco and Hermione filled them in about the events of the previous evening. It was fun having the others swoon over the invisibility cloak as it was supposedly unusual and unique. Invisibility cloaks were already rare and special but typically lasted only a few years, much less decades. Parvati theorized Harriet's cloak was so long lasting based on some family secret from her grandmother's family, the Rubabs, as they were magical cloth dealers. Their cloth dealing was what brought them to Britain in the first place, so it was most likely the case. Harriet really didn't want to thank Dumbledore for such a valuable family momento, so she wouldn't, even though it was lovely and gave her even more of a connection with her lost kin.
Draco snorted and opened her text as well, all her questions answered and then some. She was rather grateful for the feeling of security her potions work brought, as school had always been straightforward and easy. At least she knew one part of her life would be a guaranteed success, because managing to save Harry from herself or others was definitely not a sure thing, now or in the future.
Malfoy turned to argue with the Gryffindors, "You're serious?! There's no way that's true! The famous Harry Potter
Harry frowned, indignant, "He just wants to meet me for the same reason everyone else does."
"I never quite believed the stories my boys brought home that Harry Potter was spending time with a bunch of Slytherins, but it seems it was true. Yes, those are all my children. I have two more boys that have already graduated and my only girl is one year under you and will be joining Hogwarts next year."
Nicolas nodded in approval, "Good. The only unforgivable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit afterall. So she survived her upbringing with the ability to love? Good. Good." Nicolas shook his head at his occasionally foolish student before he said, "You put too much into biological imperative, my young friend."
"Shameful. Disgusting. What sort of heir are you? Dragging the Malfoy name with mudbloods. Maybe it would have been different if you had been a proper heir. But Eostre didn't wish to bless us with a boy and we're left to make due with you. Obviously I have failed in teaching you properly. I will hear nothing of you associating with
Hermione nodded, "But this has been going on since the day her parents were murdered. Who would know she'd grow into the sort of person she is? Don't magical cores take time to develop? Certainly not in a toddler. He'd have no way of knowing."
"No. You did. Yes, biological imperative is the basis of much of eusocial magic. It's the root of racism and nationalism and considered an intrinsic part of human nature, but humans are also more than that. The saying is not 'blood is thicker than water.' It is 'the blood pact of brothers is thicker than the water of the womb.' Her mother chose to love Miss Potter, just as others will also choose to love her, and she them. The blood sacrifice will endure. That sort of love never leaves you."
"Hey, Potter!"
Bang! The door was struck again.
Despite worrying about all of that, she felt freer than she had in forever. She had never truly had support in her life, and with all her secrets out, all the suffering and pressure and people seeing her at her worst, she still had people who cared about her and stood beside her. She turned her head to take in Draco in all her drooling glory again. Whatever bad fortune she might have had, it seems it was rewarded with what had to be the best friends in the world. They were odd, all distinctive individuals, and sometimes rough around the edges, but they were brilliant and loyal and she couldn't help but think that she must have been Mother Teresa in a past life or something to deserve them.
Hermione sighed, "They're muggle hair potions. This one is a cleanser that will remove the color. This one is a shampoo that should be used to remove the cleanser. And this one is a conditioner that will make your hair strong and shiny, which would be helpful considering all your hair has been through. Directions are written on the bottle."
Bang!
Draco crossed her arms more tightly, she could feel her hands starting to dig into armpits painfully, "I just am, okay?"
"Have you played chess before, Miss Potter?"
Harriet tried to say something. Anything! But pity was something she couldn't take. She just couldn't take that, no matter what.
"Curse?" Harriet asked.
"What exactly are these supposed to be?"
Professor McGonagall nodded, "Remus Lupin, yes. Not that Remus wouldn't have made a fine head boy, but as I told you, James Potter was very charismatic. In a way he was already the leader of the entire school. Putting him in official capacity tied him down. He was a bit of a troublemaker if I say so myself. But being placed in a position of leadership forced him to grow up a bit. It did him a world of good. One of my better choices in recommending him to the position."
Harry herself shifted around nervously, and asked, with her big green eyes gazing up at her, "Is tea already ready, Mrs. Malfoy?"
Weasley seemed pleased to get back on Harry's good side, "She was definitely notable, because both Ron and Percy speak of her as if she's the next Minister of Magic. And Fred and George agreeing with anything their other brothers say is...well, extremely rare."
Parvati had to ask, "Wait, are you?"
Harriet stifled another laugh. Why hadn't she paid more attention at the last sleepover with the Slytherins? Draco was absolutely hilarious in the morning.
Harry sniffed, doing her best to mirror Draco's demeanor, even pulling her voice up an octave, "Oh, maybe I will. And not invite you along."
"See what?"
"Yes, actually. A young boy, Han-ki. Fortunately his cousin was a deserter so it was simple enough to pull him and his family out of the camps."
Something inside Draco screamed that this was connected to everything she was thinking about. Every alarm inside her told her to run and run as far away as possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
I love Badass Narcissa. That's a trope I can always get behind.
Draco had been half listening to most of the exchange before this point, but that made her sit up and pay closer attention, "Killing unicorns?"
At this Albus brightened, "Yes. She does. Magnanimously in fact."
Draco gasped. Harry was forbidden from the Manor!? Was he going to forbid her from being her friend, too?
"Cheers!"
I want to try and have as much of Draco's POV for this fic as possible. Not only is she more fun to write, but she's already undergone more changes in her worldview and it's only going to get more and more difficult to hold previously held worldviews.
The girls were all silent in the presence of all this revelation. Parvati eventually spoke up, with a certain concerned determination, "You were raised by your muggle relatives on your mother's side, right?"
Draco nodded, "They should be at my desk. Just be sure to enunciate the
"I don't sound like that!"
And poor Hagrid. His hut is going to burn down because no one will help him with the Norbert situation.
"Zacharias Smith. Can you do me a favor and not stick me with him?"
Albus conjured a flame in his hand and swung it towards their feet, and the plant skittered away and they dropped further, Albus casting a quick cushioning spell.
Draco breathed deeply, the air was clean, smelling faintly of new grass and hyachins catching in the wind. It was easy to believe it was just her and Harry alone, sheltered by the white blossomed canopy. Eostre herself granting them her blessing.
Hermione retorted calmly, nearly rolling her eyes, "He tried to kill her when she was one and a half. I don't think he much cares that she's a child."
Lavender asked gently to Hermione, "I heard muggles hate anyone bent."
miss lugging around two full suitcases worth of presents to give to all their relatives when they visit.
Though I'm safe and my family is safe and we're all okay.
Parvati didn't tell anyone what they observed outside McGonagall's office, and neither did Harriet. She was thankful Parvati kept her tongue, especially with someone so interested in gossip as Lavender and she really didn't want anyone knowing such things.
"God, I'm so glad I'm in Gryffindor rather than Slytherin, or else I'd have to deal with you 24/7."
Hermione shook her head, "Not really a dye, but it'd make her smell like flowers for a while. Not the goal you're trying to achieve."
Nicolas hummed his approval before Albus called out, "Fizzy Spangles!" and the royal family and each of the two pawns saluted and moved aside to open a path to the far door.
Harriet grinned wickedly, "I could find other ways to make her angry."
Harry glare immediately turned into something bemused. She clarified in her usual articulate manner, "What?"
Thanks to Anra7777 for being her amazing self and reading through all this and letting me bounce ideas off her.
When they arrived Neville explained what happened and Madam Pomfrey flew into action, directing Neville to guide Harriet to what felt like a cot of some kind.
Harriet dropped her mouth in shock and disgust, "What?!"
"What? Really? The Queen of Snakes lives here?"
"Er…" there was no real use denying it.
A few weeks later, Pansy arrived a little late to breakfast, and plopped down at the Gryffindor table exclaiming with a determined look, "Good morning, girls. I have some news."
Harriet chuckled a little, her heart felt warm at her friend's concern, "Yeah, I'm alright. Are you okay, Hermione? I couldn't tell if you got hit or not. I closed my eyes just in time."
They dropped their brooms off at the shed and cleaned up in Draco's room, as it wouldn't do to attend tea with all of their organic detritus. Just as Draco had finished pulling the last twig out of the birdnest, they heard the bell ring.
"A Smith, eh? I'm guessing he'll be sorting after you, but if he's anything like most Smiths I get, he'll probably be in Hufflepuff. However I absolutely love to send students to houses their families didn't sort into. I'd love to get a Bones out of Hufflepuff, a Weasley out of Gryffindor, a Cornwall out of Ravenclaw, a Malfoy out of Slytherin, but alas. They all choose to follow their families. Speaking of, you would do well in Slytherin."
Thank to the amazing Anra7777! Who gave me great advice and is magic at grammar!
Though if you enjoyed Narcissa's POV, I'm sorry but I only forsee one more chapter that works from her perspective.
Even Quirrell, despite not looking her in the face, would respond to her answers. DADA had its own set of problems, however, and Harriet was really pondering if she might need to go to Madam Pomfrey's for some treatment for the garlic smell. The headaches that happened during class were really irritating and borderline invasive.
They took the Hogwarts Express back to King's Cross, and had a cabin to the seven of them, giggling and gagging over nasty flavored Bertie Botts. Parvati's parents were there to pick them up, and Harriet got to experience her first side-along apparation. The tight squeeze was less than enjoyable, but she couldn't complain too much at the convenience.
"Thank you, Mrs. Patil," Harriet hoped that she read more into her words than just the compliment.
“That’s just envy talking,” Draco replied as he retrieved his book. He didn’t open it in time to hide the smile that curled his lips.
He mentioned it to Malfoy and was rewarded with more delicately articulated Latin names as Malfoy suggested plants that would grow well in the West Country. Harry’s fuzzy mind filled with images of Malfoy in his yard with bulbs and seedlings. Malfoy wouldn’t be in his nice robes for gardening. Would be wear casual robes or had he discovered Muggle fashion in Paris? Muggle styles were certainly more popular in London these days, at least among their generation.
Kauko on his knees using all the words Antero taught him to stop the bleeding of a stranger. Kauko is a good pupil, and they are good words, but there is so much blood. Mehiläinen is there beside him, but Kauko doesn’t understand yet. He uses the words. He uses the power within him, but he does not use the power beside him.
Draco grabbed Potter’s arse cheeks and pulled them aside so he could see Potter's pink hole. He ran his thumb over it and smiled as Potter squirmed and moaned beneath him. Right then. First the cleansing spell. Draco ran back to his trousers on the floor and pulled out his wand. He mispronounced the Charm on the first try but Potter's gasp assured him that the second attempt had managed something.
Harry felt his mouth fall open in horror. He had tried to improve the conversation and had inadvertently made it much worse.
Well he wasn’t going to spend the rest of the week moping around his flat waiting for Charlie and Pavel to have time to train him or for Draco to come crawling back from his vacation.  Harry went to his room and dug out Hermione's mobile number from his trunk.  He pulled on his boots and headed out to see if Jens could point him in the direction of the nearest Muggle village.
Draco felt the hope rise up in his chest and tried his best to stomp it back down. So Potter liked men. It didn’t mean he wanted Draco. He had shown clear interest in Draco’s own admission, but maybe that was just because he had thought Draco was a homophobic bigot. Maybe he wanted a gay buddy to talk shop with.
“The food was really good.” Hermione agreed as she set down the parchment she’d been fussing with and came to join Harry on her couch. No doubt she was already throwing herself back into work after her long weekend away. “And ethical! You know the hens are free range when you can actually see them walking around the grounds. They have their own cows, geese, and pigs as well, and they are all well treated as far as I can tell. There was an extensive vegetable garden, too. I’ve told Neville to visit if he can get a reservation. I think they must be using cultivating charms that would interest him.”
Harry felt his cheeks heat, and Draco must have seen it because his posture tightened and his eyes darkened.  He leaned in close so that Harry could almost taste the wine on his breath when he spoke in a low growl.  "I can make you chant my name."
He crept to the greenhouse, torn between going inside to search for Draco and standing guard at the door. Best to stand in the doorway and let Draco find him than risk fumbling about and missing him. It would take more patience than he usually had, but it was the plan that kept Draco safest.
idea how he feels. In fact, you are such a dullard you probably have no idea how
While they ate, Harry watched Aida returned to her work. She pulled baskets of fruits and vegetables, carefully inspecting and sorting them into different places.
Mother ignored her as she pushed a piece of okra onto her fork to better examine. “What is this, even?” She sniffed it warily. “I smell peanuts.”
get blood on my trousers,” he warned, but Potter didn’t seem to hear him. Potter didn’t seem to be with him at all.
"Harry? What’s going on? Who’s that?"
"Not really my thing." Draco kept his tone casual but his pronunciation clear. It was essential that Potter realise Draco was interested in men if he were to have any hope of picking up on Draco's flirtations when they entered Phase Four. Potter wasn't good at subtlety.
Of course, the real dessert occurred in Draco’s bed after they Apparated home.
* * *
Next to the young witch’s dark skin and striking features, Draco should have looked sickly and ordinary. There was no change to his usual pallid complexion despite three years in Greece. An image of Snape came to mind, and Harry supposed Potioneers didn’t have many opportunities to tan.
So it was that he found himself minutes later strolling through a rose garden as Draco rattled off technical names for the various flowers. Harry wasn’t listening to the Latin words, but rather to the way each sound was formed by Draco’s mouth: clear and crisp as the sea air blowing up and across the hotel’s grounds.
Potter smiled a sweet, awkward smile that made him look like a child again. “I don’t need anything much. Just a bed and a place to put my things. It seems silly to have me use two rooms and have twice the linen to clean and all that.”
He was hungrier than he’d usually be midday, having had only toast for breakfast. He simply couldn't justify making his usual fry-up for one after weeks of cooking for two. He grabbed a roll of bread from the breadbox and took a bite. It was a bit stale—Draco would have thrown it out two days before—but it was sustenance.
“Malfoy?”
, you'd stop to ask yourself if you love him, too.' She stepped so close their noses nearly touched. 'And if not, have the decency to let him go, because it will only hurt him more if you wait until you fall for someone else.' With that she pushed by him and returned to the party.
Merryn called ahead of them down the hall. “Mum! ’e’s here! ’e
waste your chance?" Her voice was sickeningly sweet. "I'm so glad." She leaned forward to whisper in his ear. "I want all the details." With a flick of her wild hair, she was gone.
* * *
“Looking for a place to nest,” Draco murmured.  “You can tell from the way she’s circling and the swell of her belly.”  Even Pavel looked impressed, and they all listened quietly as Draco told them what he knew of the Ridgeback.
She stepped back, beaming up at him. “You knocked, you daft fool. You live ‘ere. Now come in. Mum’s got supper ready and she won’t take the Statis off ‘til you’re at the table.” She pulled him into the warmth of the house and he greedily soaked up the familiar paintings on the walls and the smell of old stone and wood.
He leant forward and pressed his lips to Draco's. A catcall sounded from across the room, but Harry ignored everything but the feel of Draco's lips pressing back against his and the dig of fingertips against his hip.
them distract him from bloody annoying gits who only pretend to believe in forgiveness.
Harry fell in step beside Malfoy, ignoring the thumping in his chest as they moved so close together. They walked in silence, but it was easy and light, allowing Harry to hear the occasional chirp and skitter of the more mundane woodland creatures that inhabited the outskirts of the forest.  He did hope that they wouldn’t be going too far in. There were other creatures he hoped never to meet again.
Draco laughed. A crumb of encouragement.
When she let him go, it was with an order to find Potter and make nice. Draco may have forgotten that Potter could make or break the hotel, but Merryn had not.
And speaking of Hermione. Draco set down the article and leaned forward in his armchair. Yes, there was bushy hair in his fireplace calling for him. He moved to the chair by the fire and saw Hermione’s agitated face in flames. He felt a flash of worry. She had said she was going to the Leaky to see some friends before leaving on her trip to Romania in the morning. Why was she fire-calling him?
Draco chuckled against Potter's chest and felt it rumble in reply. "I suppose you wouldn't believe me if I denied it."
* * *
Harry nodded. It pleased him to think Hermione’s reputation was making it across the Atlantic while Draco’s was not. “I think it’s her favourite hotel. Very restful.” Leah was definitely considering his words, but Kensa still looked suspicious. Harry’s mind raced with a way to convince her. He wasn’t sure why he cared, but suddenly he did. Maybe it was because he wanted to preserve Ron’s anniversary plans, or maybe it was the thought of a place which allowed Hermione to relax, or maybe he was remembering all the times the
“Fine! I want to go!” Harry called, hoping to bring back the fevered look in Draco’s eyes. Draco ignored him and continued walking. “Please? Please, Draco?” At the first sound of begging, Draco froze. He looked far too pleased when he turned to face Harry.
Harry nodded, a little smile pulling at his lips. Draco was in his element: he was the centre of attention, and he soaked up the limelight like a plant did sunlight.
not good at subtlety. "I don't like them at all, Potter." He resisted growling at Potter's confused expression. "I'm gay!"
"You know, there are only two answers to that. Either Draco Malfoy isn't as bad as you think he is, or I'm not the good person you think I am." Harmony stated impassively. "So which is it?"
Harmony could not look away as a spell hit Sirius's stomach, making him gasp in pain and fall back. Mr. Malfoy walked to Sirius and bent to grab the man's hair.
"So that is why he is acting so rashly," Severus said, trying not imagine Voldemort as a woman. "But why did he break into the Ministry of Magic?"
Ron hesitated before bobbing his head, in the fashion of a yes. "Yes, sir," he squeaked.
"What, killing a man for me? That sure helps us all!" Draco glared into the other man's frown.
"Er. What exactly is SMEX?"
Harmony asked, "Ginny, can you fly up and get us brooms?"
The Prophet (also known as The Scrap of Rubbish):
Harmony had been worried about how she was going to access her gold, until Draco explained how the goblins operated. They had an innate sense for who the gold belonged to, even being able to see through magical transformations like polyjuice potions and the like. Which was why the wizarding world trusted them as caretakers of their money.
"Look Ginny, I swear that I won't run away," Harmony practically pleaded for the tenth time, "I can sit still and proper." She had gone through the most unimaginable torture. She had been pricked with tweezers, smeared with glitter, sprayed with womanly smells, and even her nails were painted.
After that, it was probably the first time she went through the halls after class as Harmony. She wasn't going to hide in the dorms, or the library. She was getting mightily annoyed from their antics, but otherwise it helped her in a way. When Draco told her that he tried to stop them, she told him that she could handle it. She could fight her own battles.
There was an outbreak of applause as piles of food materialized on all the long tables. Children laughed in delight as their favorite foods were scrapped onto their plates. Potatoes, meat pies, vegetables, chicken legs, a whole roast pig, creamy soups, spaghetti, pumpkin juice, and an assortment of fruits weighed the table down.
As Harry continued to approach Malfoy, he decided he didn’t mind being caught in that piercing grey stare. Other than the intensity in his eyes, Malfoy’s face gave nothing away as Harry approached. Malfoy didn’t speak or move until Harry was nearly to him, and then his voice was flat.
It was months later when Granger and Draco found themselves alone together at a Ministry ball. They weren't quite friends, but she and Weasley had been surprisingly accepting of his and Harry's relationship.
Malfoy and Harry were dancing. Harry couldn't remember exactly how that came to pass, but he was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s strong arm around his waist and the long fingers of his other hand tangled with Harry's. Malfoy was light on his feet and seemed to lead Harry effortlessly around the room in time with the strings playing from somewhere.
“No. You don’t get to make my decisions. I’m almost seventeen. I’m almost of age.” She took a deep breath and then met his eyes with a seriousness Draco hadn’t seen in someone her age since the war. She suddenly looked just like her mother, and Draco felt compelled to listen the way he always did to Rosamund, even when he disagreed. “You don’t get to be the only one to suffer. We are a family ‘ere and we protect each other, but we also suffer together. You can’t take every ‘ex for me. You ‘ave to let me take one for you.”
* * *
has gone on far too long. It isn't healthy!'
Harry was rewarded with the sight of Draco Malfoy falling apart in his hand.  He was flushed and gasping beneath him as his cock spurted across his chest.  His legs, still jutting up in the air, were trembling and slick with sweat.  Harry knew he wouldn't last long with that sight burned into his eyes.  He let go of himself and thrust hard and deep as his balls tightened and his whole body tensed into an explosion.
They stood at the crag looking out over the sea until Draco broke the silence and said he needed to return to the hotel to prepare for dinner. Harry wondered how much there could be to do to required Draco starting midday. Wasn’t Harry the only guest? He suddenly imagined himself sitting alone in a large dining room with portraits staring at him as he ate in silence. This was why he never took holidays. He had no one to enjoy them with.
"No idea," Hermione interrupted. "But I think you should find out. I come back from my trip just in time for my birthday, and I know Oliver is throwing a surprise party for me." She held up her hand to forestall Draco’s attempt to object. "I know how to feign surprise, Draco. I love Oliver, but he thinks I won’t find things in his sock drawer when I do the laundry."
as inexperienced as Potter!"
Harry met Draco’s eye over Merryn’s head. “I was hoping for a tour maybe?” He hadn’t meant to ask. He hadn’t known he wanted Draco to show him around until that moment. But having said it, he found himself desperately hoping Draco would agree.
A small, sleek barn owl was perched outside his bedroom window when Draco returned from his shower.  Tightening the towel wrapped around his waist, he used both hands to fight with the temperamental window latch.   This was why magic was so essential.  He strode to the bureau and snatched up his wand.  With a flick of his wrist, both bird and early autumn air were rushing into his previously toasty apartment.
“Sure beats being on the teams that keep the Muggles away,” Okello replied.  “Way too much Charm work to modify memories properly.”  He wrinkled his nose at the thought.
“Did you mean it?” They had been walking for about twenty minutes in complete silence, and Harry couldn’t take it anymore.
It was boring and required careful guard of his tongue, but it was far more peaceful than sharing a home with the Dark Lord.
Potter flopped into the matching armchair and ran his hands through his hair. "I can't believe we are stuck here for two weeks. Two weeks!"
Of course that was what he took from the story. “Well, it was easy to call you Malfoy when it was just you at school, but when the news about the attack…” Harry realised perhaps bringing up the gruesome murder of Draco’s father was not the right choice for a walk in the country. They had crossed the field to where it tumbled down to the sea. Best not to upset Draco when there was a convenient cliff to be shoved off.
"Are you the Malfoy boy?" Harry asked.
"So much."  Why not admit it when it was clear Draco was as affected.  "I want you in me."
“Was not,” he had protested.  “I was pale and slim.”
“ I'll be the last!” Potter growled.  “No one else is touching you!”
“Please stop looking so panicked,” Potter pleaded. “I get that you don’t want people to know, but I’m not going to say anything. No one will hear it from me. I’m not sure why it has to be a secret, but if it needs to be I’ll keep it.”
“You 'kay?  Did he hurt you?”
As soon as Harry was back in his room, he opened his bag and sifted through it. He’d brought a couple of jumpers just for warmth, and the green one was rather smart. He’d also brought some corduroys—again just for the warmth—that would look alright. He supposed he could wear the shoes he’d brought for the wedding. They weren’t called “morning shoes” afterall. They were called...he actually had no idea what they were called. He just knew the shop clerk had said they went with a morning suit, and a morning suit was what to wear to a morning wedding. Harry hadn’t asked further questions.
Harry didn't remember moving, but he found himself pressed against Draco's back with his lips near Draco's ear. 'Having fun?' He was relieved to hear his voice come out lightly despite the possessive grip he wrapped around Draco's waist. He reluctantly let go when Draco turned to face him, but his heart swelled when he saw the huge grin that made Draco's eyes sparkle. He realised that he often noticed the effect of Draco's expressions on his eyes; perhaps he had a bit of a thing for Draco's eyes.
Draco did feel sorry for the man. It was dreadful weather.
“New group in the morning,” Charlie said tiredly as they trudged along the trail that would lead their group back to the safety of Bârlog.  After two long days in the field, they were all exhausted.  The Italian tourists they were escorting had been an easy group, except for a belligerent witch who failed to appreciate the dangers of wearing flashy jewellery around dragons.  She seemed convinced that their insistence on her leaving her jewels behind in the village was part of a plan to rob her, and even now she quickened her steps to return to the inn first.
“I'm getting my own drink, thank you , so you are of no use to me.”
Draco pulled his wand and touched it to the delicate fabric. Instantly there was a full-length robe of finest silk in a pale silver. Long green cords hung from the side that were meant to tie the bodice and provide a slim fit through the chest and hips. It was a look Draco knew flattered his lean figure.
Potter didn’t smile. He looked rather tense. “Yeah, well we talked a lot about who we don’t like. But um … what about who you do?”
Hot fluid filled his mouth, and Harry tried to swallow without tasting with limited success. Draco was right: definitely not sweet, but not too bad.
“I think about you all day and then I Floo to your house and love the fact that you allow me in at all , let alone when you're not there.  I browse your books and your photos and try to glean little details about you from where you live because I can't know enough about you.  Fuck, Draco.  I'm completely smitten and falling for you, and you’re not sure if you consider yourself my boyfriend?”
Harry was expecting some surprise when he mentioned Draco, but Neville just nodded.
Harry paced his desk waiting for Draco's reply.  He could easily walk across the floor to the other man's department, but he really wanted to shower and change before he let Draco near him.  He and Ron had been tailing their Scottish apothecary assistant since Tuesday morning, and Harry was filthy.  It was only Ron's indulgence that was allowing Harry the evening off to keep his date with Draco.
"Morning," Draco whispered. "What time is it?" He would need time to go home and clean up before the fair. Their race wasn't until half two in the afternoon, but he should be seen partaking in Muggle culture and supporting the Ministry. Perhaps Potter could recommend a Muggle food that wouldn't offend his sensitive palate.
“He’s pining for Zhi, but she either doesn’t know or doesn’t care,” came Draco’s commentary, this time with the pretence of looking past Harry at something on the wall.
"Enough!"
Potter's head shot up to look at him. "No! Not that much time. I mean like a minute or two."
Harry. So if you want to give me a birthday present, find out what Harry’s problem is and fix it."
It was a good size area, but Harry could sweep it on his broom in a couple of days.
