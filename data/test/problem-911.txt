He was still wondering if this was the moment where it would be polite to leave them alone when Draco addressed him: “I really hope you like dumplings. This is a dumpling house.” With a charming half smile, the pink haired man patted the cushions next to him, offering Harry a seat.
” below before sending.
“I would not drink that before you have something in your stomach. That stuff can really twist your guts,” she murmured while pushing her feet under Harry’s blanket. With a dramatic gesture she leaned back onto the cushions and declared: “I would literarily kill for a slice of cheese pizza right now. Does your phone still have battery?”
As soon as he had sent the message, he knew how stupid he must have sounded.
Draco studied his confused expression and was almost about to ask what was up when Harry remembered his manners and asked his guest for his jacket before thanking him for the pizza and mentioning he had also prepared a few tiny sides. Draco leant in and their shoulders touched ever so slightly, Harry was not sure if it was per accident or not.
“How did you get this table?” he managed to scream against the loud, leaning towards the other guy once again. Draco’s answer was a smug smile and he gestured Harry to come closer, so he could whisper or should I better say shout into his ear:
Hermione smiled at him and touched his shoulder.
Harry nestled at the collar of his shirt, nervously watching the clock tick. Draco should be here soon. He took a deep breath. He had double and triple checked everything, the food was fine, the house looked nice and so did he. Believe me when I tell you that our favourite Gryffindor felt a bit awkward, being this dressed up for a casual meeting at his place. Wearing fitting jeans, a brand new soft long sleeve shirt and his best pair of socks was dressed up, considering Harry normally hung around at home in his oldest pair of sweatpants. Which were way more comfortable but not stylish at all. He had discussed the option of shoes for a solid 15 minutes at least, deciding it would be ridiculous and then went on the search for the best socks. Have you ever lost your head because of the fact that you do not own serious stockings? No? Well, maybe that is because you have never tried to impress Draco Malfoy with everything you have and are.
“So, does it always look the same?” he asked in a low voice, cautiously watching Draco’s face, looking for any change of expression, any sign his question went too far. He was met by a coy and beautiful smile, which for the first time reached both sides of Draco’s lips, while the other man’s caught his own and slowly lead it to his lips, softly kissing the palm of Harry’s hand.
Harry chuckled and ruffled through his godson’s hear one again. They were still purple and he suddenly had to think about Draco. How interesting that both had decided to go with a colour on the red spectrum. He only knew about spectrums and stuff because Astoria had told him, being quite a fashion critic herself. Maybe it was reasonable Teddy had chosen a similar colour as he and Draco were related. Harry wondered if those two would get along and if Draco was also so disgusted by the thought of kissing girls.
The awfully messy black strands did whatever they liked on his head as they had always done. There was no use trying to get them in any kind of shape, he knew that from experience. It was his hair structure which simply refused to obey the very basic laws of physics. Pressing them down flat on his head he wondered if maybe he could pull of a drastic cut, let’s say only a quarter of an inch left. But wouldn’t that make him smaller than he already was?
The first time they do a road trip together is at the beginning of spring after the first warm days. Astoria has eagerly been waiting for the sun to come out behind the clouds of the London sky and as soon as the temperature has risen above 12 degree, she seems to spend every waking hour in the sun.  Harry particularly enjoys this because it means they often hang out in in his garden now, drinking sparkly things and enjoying life.
While typing in his own number (oh what a lucky coincidence Hermione had forced him to learn it by heart just in case only this week!) he wondered whether Draco actually owned a smart phone as well and if he should dare to ask the blond man for his number – now that they considered each other friends this was not a weird request, wasn’t it? Unfortunately, we will never find out if the Saviour of our beloved Wizard World would have had the guts to do so as Astoria was forced to leave by a very pushy Draco, who now seemed self-aware of his hair as well as he nervously checked it in the bar mirrors. They left behind a smiling Harry who wondered if he had ever assumed Draco was sharing a flat with someone like that girl.
“I’m an idiot, right?”
He is not surprised when Astoria instantly starts singing loud and wrong. What gets him is Daphne drumming to the beat and joining her with a very rough but beautiful voice. He looks at Draco and sees him moving his lips without a sound, flickering his eyes from the road to the mirror and towards him. Maybe he thinks he will blame himself.
“I mean, I can simply eat the main course, it is not that of a drama!”
“Of course, there is something. For me there has always been something. But this is the reason I cannot do this. Even if you were willing to be with me, this would not end up well for me.”
It all had started quiet innocent with a text from Astoria, asking him how to cook Ratatouille. Thinking back, he realized, he should have wondered why she was attempting to create a dish on her own. She had already admitted she was a horrible cook weeks before. He could undoubtedly have known things would not turn out well. He should most certainly have realized he would have to run for her rescue the moment she had asked the recipe. In the aftermath he clearly should have been able to predict he was going to end in Draco’s kitchen, cooking dinner for Daphne while Astoria despairingly tried to be of any help. Which she was not.
“And you, my son Harry, I am so glad that tonight has once again proven family means more than being bound by blood. I am so happy you managed to step out of the shadow of your name this year and finally find your place in this world.”
Harry smiled when he had finished reading the letter. Truly, when it came to writing, Draco must have learnt more than one or two things from his mother. He genuinely felt happy for her as well as Teddy as they obviously seemed to like each other very much. Maybe Draco would feel the same. It took him quite a while to find a clean, fresh piece of parchment and a quilt to write back but he decided to keep his answer short and simple. The Malfoys might be a family of big words, he certainly was not.
Over their presumable second or third cup of Weasley Punch they had settled on a topic and were eagerly fighting over it for half an hour by now.
Maybe his message was the problem. Maybe he sounded as if he wanted to scold Draco, to tell him off for kissing and liking him? Maybe he had given the complete wrong impression.
“Isn’t it lovely to see Hogwarts being alive once again, Mr. Potter?”, she asked while taking place opposite of him. It was nothing unusual for her to join his lonely evenings at that time. And lonely they had been. During the first months he was kept busy by all the work that needed to be done at the castle first and then with the people suffering under what had happened to them, what they had to see. But day by day everyone managed to return to their normal lives step by step. It was a slow process, still he noticed the changes. Ron and Hermione rather spending time together than as the three of them, students getting hyped for Quidditch matches once again, a Ravenclaw girl crying over her homework instead of the victims of war. Together with the castle its inhabitants managed to heal.
About an hour after they had exchanged gifts Harry was sitting in the living room with the other Weasleys while Arthur was fast asleep in his beloved chair. 15 was definitely not only one too many. Our favourite Gryffindor started to wonder where his boyfriend had gone to about ten minutes ago. Had the merry spirit of Christmas in the end become too much for Draco to handle after all?
“Oh, Saint Potter, are you here to help me with my miserable existence as well or does our great saviour think he has gifted me enough with his name?”, Ron snarled at him, little Hugo in in his arm. His tone was anything between amused, sarcastic and frustrated. He nodded towards the living room, gesturing Harry to follow him while he went on: “Hermione is at the Prophet as a delegate from the Ministry, trying to do damage control but I am afraid the news of Malfoy manipulating you with his charms have already spread.”
In his mind he repeated the first name over and over again. It sounded strange, unusual. He would need some time to get used to it. But the look on the other man’s face showed him, this was a step into the right direction. A Harry Potter who might be gay might also be friends with Draco Malfoy, he thought to himself and grinned a bit. His life seemed to finally be changing again after ages, finally the world seemed to be spinning again.
And that was is. As simple as that. At the age of 25 Harry Potter was left by his fiancée and girlfriend of seven years because she thought he was gay. Shocking isn't it? How would the press have reacted to this part of the story, he often wondered. And more so, what would the Weekly Witch write about him knowing that not for one second he tried to argue with Ginny. Actually, he wasn't sure if she was wrong at all.
But this story would not go anywhere if it only was about Harry staring at someone's back, lost in his own thoughts. The blond man turned his head for the approximately fifth time this day to notice him still staring. Dark eyebrows twitched and a smug smile conquered his lips. With what could only be described as pure elegance the other wizard got up from his chair and made his way towards Harry.
Draco helped her gather Hugo’s blanket and softly explained: “I think I will make an exception for your boy, he is quite special.”
“Most of us are hiding something, a secret they do not want the public to know. Maybe because they are ashamed, scared, they do not want to feel vulnerable. Maybe because they think their voice is not important or that they are alone. That they are different and not important. That there are things one does not talk about. Maybe they are simply insecure.
“Oh no, how would I dare, that one you are obviously right with. Care for another cup?”
Harry closed his eyes and leant into the touch of their lips, pushing his face upwards, trying to get closer to the other body. He could feel his own erection rubbing against his pants and his legs touching Draco’s. Still there was too much space between them and he did the only thing his brain still seemed to be capable of ordering his body to do: He grabbed the soft strands of pink hair at the back of the other man’s head and forced the sinfully lips closer to his own, pushing their mouths open.
"Maybe it is not a woman you are looking for..."
Feared he had gotten it all wrong.
Well I would most certainly lie if I told you all of my former flings – I would definitely not call them relationships – were rather problematic. You of course will understand that I cannot and absolutely am not willing to give away any names but there have been man, who were officially in very happy relationships, making efforts to hook up with me not only once. As I am a man of – even very doubtful – moral standards I of course refused such invitations. But even I have to admit to have been fooled not only once but twice by men who secretly dated me and also had a relationship with a woman at the same time.
With a reassuring smile she turned towards him, waiting for his reaction. Harry still didn’t know what to say or how to proceed with this new information. Why did she tell him?
He had always felt like a member of the Weasley family. This was where he belonged and therefore dating Ginny was - well it was the obvious thing to do. And it seemed to work out pretty well until one day Ron made this terrible joke about Harry dating even him if there had been no female Weasley he could court.
This was the moment Harry truly realized this date was not going that well at all.
He cleared his throat and managed to ask: “What is it?” His voice sounded terrible, rough and scratchy. What was wrong with him? He was not supposed to act like this around Draco. They were friends! The other man left his position and walked behind the counter so that the were now facing each other over the stove. A faint reminder of what was once a half smile still lingered on his lips when he put a finger into his glass and swirled it around, He had the nerve to lick the liquid off of said finger while still staring at Harry who was now sure, Draco was playing his usual game with him.
Malfoy quickly looked at him, silently asking for help and an answer himself and Harry remembered that they were bound by a contract not to reveal the actual topic of their meetings. Even though it had started rather rough until Harry managed to ease up in Malfoy’s company there was no logical reason to not assume, they were friends now.
Why did you split up?
Movement Towards the Rising Sun
“Harry! There is nothing to be ashamed of! Sex is the most natural thing in the world and a beautiful way to express your feelings towards each other! Also, it is really important to use protection. But tell me first, did you already do it? Did you top or bottom?”
“Hey there handsome, are you looking for some fun?”, he asked and Harry could smell the alcohol in his breath. The guy was not bad looking but because of the loud music he had shouted his question into Harry’s ear, his lips almost touching the sensitive skin. Once again, he took another step backwards which unfortunately was interpreted as an invitation. Harry could feel the stranger’s hands on his hips, his butt, gripping firmly. For a few seconds he was to shocked to react at all but as soon as he was capable of pushing the guy away, Draco had already stepped close.
Sirius nodded, sniffling a sharp breath in.
“… I mean, I think it went alright. Could have gone worse, honestly.”
“Remus was invited as well, and he said he could come, but if you don’t want him there, I can call and cancel-”
“Who’s the meeting with?”
“You want me to...” She paused, frowning. “You want to watch the movie with me?”
“Oh, hey Harry,” Sirius said with a smile. “Want to watch with us?”
“To hang out?”
“I was wondering if I could ask a favour of you, Black. And you, Mr. Potter.”
“Apparently, my parents left me some money when they died.” Potter scrubbed his face. “I only found out when Sirius came around because the Dursleys never told me. When I turn sixteen my legal guardian has access to the accounts. The Dursleys don’t want to give up custody because if they do, they lose access to the money.”
“Don’t look so tortured, Black. It isn’t that kind of favour.”
Harry sat forward.
The next morning Harry was filled with dread. The moment he woke up he was exhausted and the thought of spending the day with Malfoy felt like a nightmare spilt over into the real world. Yesterday afternoon, Sirius had checked Harry was alright with the arrangement. He assured Harry he would call Mr. Malfoy and tell him they had changed their minds if Harry wasn’t comfortable, but Harry wouldn’t let him. It felt too much like cowering away and Harry wouldn’t let Malfoy have the satisfaction of scaring him.
Lucius Malfoy spent most days at their home that week, running over Harry’s case. The days were spent gathered by the kitchen table preparing Harry’s statement. Each afternoon, after Malfoy had left, Harry would go to his room with his shoulders slumped and his feet shuffling. He would collapse on his bed the second he reached it. Most times Snuffles followed him, jumping up on the bed and rubbing his wet nose along Harry’s face. Those nights Sirius bought dinner up to him, and they ate together in Harry’s bed. Some nights he stayed, Sirius and Snuffles both falling asleep with Harry, staying with him until morning.
Malfoy held up his hand, halting the woman’s rant.
At the question, Luna looked at him like he had asked her if she would like a brand-new puppy, the way her eyes lit up with delightful surprise.
The hound bit his pants, roughly tugging him forward. When he heard a sharp rip, Malfoy swore. He picked up the rope attached to Potter's dog, and immediately the beast pulled him forward, just about jerking his arm from its socket.
Sure enough, it worked.
There was something within Harry that wanted to refuse telling Malfoy anything. It was a deep fear that was sunk within him after too many of his Uncles threats. How could he tell this man all the moments of pain he endured? How could he be trusted not to let Harry get hurt by them again? But, Harry knew his life with Sirius was depending on him and the truth of his life with the Dursleys. He knew, if he didn’t speak up, then this was just another victory his Uncle had over him, and the thought of that infuriated Harry.
“So, do your friends know Saint Potter has fallen from grace?”
“For god sakes, Potter, go and sit,” Draco pointed to the couch with a firm look.
“You want to sit with me?”
The Judge hummed. He began ruffling through papers scattered on his podium.
Everyone quickly agreed. Harry shoved the letters into the pocket of his dress pants.
“What sparked this change in attitude?”
“Are we actually?” He asked in disbelief.
The two walked a few steps away from the boy and dog.  Harry stood with the rope in his hand. Snuffles was sticking low to the ground and it wasn’t long before he was planted to the grass like he had been the concrete indoors.
“Sirius! Sack up and call the man! For Christ sake,” Harry exclaimed.
Harry couldn’t do much more than nod as Sirius gently guided him from his seat. His godfather opened the back door to let snuffles in, clipping the leash onto his collar before leading them out the front door.
Remus pulled the car to a stop, putting the gear stick into neutral, pulling the handbrake. They were parked outside Harry and Sirius’s house. Remus cut the ignition, before turning to face Harry.
Harry didn’t want to admit that he struggled to read things from afar. The glasses his Aunt had picked up from the store had helped his sight, but he had to sit up the front in most classes if he wanted to be able to read from the board. He wasn’t about to tell Draco that though.
“It’s not that simple, Malfoy.”
There was something in the other man’s tone. A softness Remus used whenever he knew Sirius had been up to something. It left Sirius wanting to both scream his head off and curl up into a ball in the other man’s arms, holding him as tightly as he could.
“Please say something Harry.”
“My Uncle used to say things about it. That’s all.”
“However,” Harry’s heart sank. “It would require you to make a statement about the abuse you suffered at the hands of you Uncle and Aunt, which, if necessary, we will use to press
Harry nodded at the answer. He looked at Draco and raised his eyebrow. Draco, in response, shook his head slightly as his eyes widened. Harry gestured with his head to Luna, who was still staring vacantly at the movie posters. Draco threw his head back and let out a silent but deep sigh.
Sirius nodded. He scrubbed his beard, the scratching audible.
Draco thought over the words. He wasn’t sure how to respond to something that sounded so serious.
They all turned to look at him, Sirius looking relieved as he glanced over Harry. The gaze of all the Malfoys had Harry shrinking his neck into his shoulders. His wide eyes shifted
Harry blushed. He shrugged his shoulders, sinking low into the seat despite the spring digging into his back.
Harry nodded. He became aware of how little he was talking and berated himself. Surely Melissa and Sirius must have wondered if something was wrong with him. But as he tried to come up with something to say, he ran blank.
Harry thought about when it had all started, but as he thought, he couldn’t be sure there ever truly was a point that things began. It had just always been. So, he started with his first memory.
“Oh yeah?”
He was coming to accept the though of his own death when a hand gripped his forearm tight enough to bruise and pulled him up. He felt strong arms grip his midsection, and panic overwhelmed him. He was being pulled to the side of the footpath near a building when the ringing in his ears gave way to words.
“I mean…” He trailed off, not knowing how to answer.
“She seems nice,” Harry watched as the car drove off.
“Just start at the beginning. Tell me when it started, what they would do, anything,” Mr. Malfoy said in what was the most comforting way he possibly could. It still came out stiff.
The same warm chuckle, and then Remus Lupin was sitting in front of him.
“Can we do that?”
Harry ran a hand over his face and sighed deeply.
“Has something happened to upset you, Harry?” Luna asked, her wide, unblinking eyes were boring into Harry’s soul.
The Dursleys nodded on the other side of the room. Harry sat facing The Judge, wedged between Sirius and Mr. Malfoy. The Dursleys sat at the desk on the right of them, without a lawyer, looking as though their time was being wasted. Vernon kept checking his watch, while his Petunia leaned back in her chair with her arms crossed. Harry thought they appeared rather confident, considering. The thought made his heart rate accelerate.
Sirius licked his lips.
“Humour me,” he said.
“Well, what about Harry then? Surely, he doesn’t feel the same,” Remus shifted in his seat. “I mean he’s straight. Just this year he had a crush on an older girl…Cho Chang.”
So, as 10:30 rolled around, Harry was a tight ball of stress and Sirius was no better. The only thing keeping them from both snapping was Snuffles pawing at them for attention. They waited in silence, sitting across from each other at the kitchen table.
They walked across the street and set themselves on a table outside the small shop. Snuffles flopped to the ground when Harry sat down, his tail slowly wagging whenever he brushed his hands over the hound’s head. His fur was scraggly, and it felt like he had rolled in sand.
“What the fuck, Potter? What is wrong with you?”
“Really?”
“I don’t care that you haven’t told your friends, Potter.”
“Hello Harry.”
“Do you really thing that I would do that?” His voice was quiet. “Draco, you’re my friend. I haven’t been acting for the past few weeks.”
“Oh, come on Moony!” Sirius exclaimed. “Just then, when Harry asked to borrow my clothes? Did you not pick up on that?!”
Once the panic and fear subsided, it took a moment for Harry to recognize the man in front of him.
Draco cleared his throat.
Hi! Thank you everyone who has left kudos and comments. I haven't been able to reply to everyone but I want to thank you for all the support you have given my story, I love reading your thoughts!
Sirius placed the cup of tea in front of Remus, filled with milk and two sugars.
Remus shot Sirius the look he always did when the other man spoke about his parents, sad and knowing.
“I bet Malfoy’s going to be a right dick about that,” Ron muttered.
“Then why didn’t you call?” Remus’s voice trembled. “Why didn’t you come and see me after you got out?”
“I suppose Lupin could come too.”
“She probably cursed you, or something mate! Don’t you know she is psycho!”
“Alright, lets get to it!” Sirius said, sharply clapping his hands together.
“Fine. It’s true,” she rolled her eyes. “It’s not as though the boy left an address-”
Malfoy practically growled, refusing to respond to Sirius’s question. He checked his watch, then turned away.
“I am not! And you were definitely being weird about yesterday. You've never asked how I am,” Harry walked into the living room, turning his back to Malfoy. The other boy followed.
“I didn’t mean it. I was just looking for a fight.”
Harry shrugged, crossing his arms over his chest. He looked away from his Godfather, and his disappointed stare.
“Hazelnut it is!”
“Do you remember that time we were playing football against each other and I broke your nose?”
Draco slowly turned around. He looked at Harry with guarded eyes. They stayed like that, staring at each other until Harry looked away.
“What time will you be coming around tomorrow, Lucius?” Sirius pushed the chairs into the kitchen table.
Upon Harry’s intrusion, Draco had ripped the headphones off his head but did nothing more than shoot the other boy a seething glare.
“Alright, enough emotional talk. Tell me about your first day back?”
“Ok,” Draco opened the lobby door, letting Luna and Harry walk out before him. “We will walk you to the car.”
“Boys,” Lucius didn’t even raise his voice. The two stopped talking immediately. “If we want to get any work done today, you need to make yourself scarce. I cannot concentrate with you jabbering at each other all day.”
“Don’t tell me you’re going to start being fake nice to me just because I have a shitty situation right now, Malfoy.”
Harry knew if he asked him to, Ron would have stayed behind. He was just that sort of friend. One time when they were 13, Harry had run over to his farm after a major argument with Uncle Vernon. Ron hadn’t even questioned what had happened, simply taking Harry’s teary eyes and bruised cheek for what they were. He let him stay as long as Harry needed, and Harry stayed as long as he could let himself.
The judge smiled encouragingly at Harry.
again, Malfoy tried again.
“Alright, then. Do you want to watch some telly? This bloke isn’t far of winning and I want to see if he gets the money.”
“Nothing!” Harry quickly assured him. “I was just wondering if you were busy, or if you wanted to hang out, or something?”
The blonde rolled his eyes but refrained from responding. He followed Harry and Snuffles out the door.
His voice was quite but strong. Immediately, Sirius paused. His eyes zeroed in on his godson, filled with panic and worry. He hovered in the centre of the room, swaying slightly towards Harry with his hands on his hips.
“I do not wish to listen to your silly chatter about whatever meaningless teenage drama is happening in your life’s. You are here to learn, and you will pay attention to this lesson, or you will find yourself in detention for the remainder of the month.”
Harry’s ears were ringing. He didn’t notice as Malfoy slowly approached him, and he certainly didn’t see the concern alight on the other boy’s face. He didn’t react to the other boy’s presence. Not until Malfoy reached his hand to tap Harry’s shoulder.
Harry leaned against his head rest, knees tucked up to his chest while Malfoy sprawled belly down across his bed.
Thanks for all the kudos and comments!
Nightmares plagued Harry the whole night. He dreamt of returning to the rancid, decaying house of Number 4 private drive, his Uncle and Aunts zombie figures attacking him as he entered the door, the walls turning to a black empty void, closing in to suffocate him.
Lucius smirked at him, his eyes cruel and disinterested.
He never believed Harry when he said that, but as far as Ron knew, it really wasn’t that bad. He and Hermione had only ever seen what Harry wanted them to. A split lip here, a black eye there. They didn’t know that was only the surface of it.
“Do you mind if I sit with you?” Harry shifted his bag higher on his shoulder.
Harry was silently thankful for that. He was surprised Mr. Malfoy had managed to get in touch with his old babysitter. He had no idea she had paid that much attention to him, or that anyone on Private Drive cared enough to go against the Dursleys for Harry.
“What do you mean? I just told you my morning was fine.”
“Wonderful,” The Judge threw Vernon a displeased look.
“Kiddo, you gotta eat quicker. Your ice cream is melting!”
Sirius walked up to the lady behind the desk, who gave him a beaming smile. She was beautiful, her blonde hair shining with each movement and her white teeth displayed in her perfect smile. She managed to make the red and black vet scrubs fashionable. She didn’t look much older than Harry, and her badge said trainee.
“Mr. Dursley, have you ever physically or verbally assaulted Mr. Potter while he was in your care?”
The floor dropped out from under Sirius. He stumbled into a particularly large stack of papers, causing them to topple over, sending papers flying everywhere.
“May I hug you?” Sirius asked, his arms reaching out, stopping before touching him.
His bedsheet covered up to his waist and one of his legs remained uncovered. He glasses were off, and he stared blankly at the dark ceiling. He could hear Sirius snoring down the corridor. It had become a habit for Harry to wait until the other man went to sleep before opening his bedroom door a crack. The door being shut caused him to think of locked rooms and bruises. Harry slept better knowing the door was open.
“They do this a lot, then?”
Harry shrugged.
“I’m going to talk to Sirius about it when I get home.”
“No, really. I need to head home,” Remus looked to Sirius. “Good luck tomorrow. Call me if you need anything.”
Harry simply sent his Godfather another knowing look.
The three of them sat out the front of a quiet corner café, Sirius and Remus across from each other with Harry between them. Snuffles had flopped to the floor, his tongue lolling outside of his grinning mouth as he sniffed the air around him. The morning had turned overcast, the sky a dull grey that refused to clear or rain. The square table they sat at was wooden, and the cutlery was already set out for them.
“Hey Sirius,” Harry’s ice-cream was dripping down its cone towards his hand. “How do you know Professor Lupin?”
“It was fine.”
Professor Lupin bent down to pat Snuffles, who was now holding his paw up for the man to shake. Harry waited for Sirius to say more. When he continued staring gaped mouth, Harry sent a sharp jab with his elbow into his godfathers’ side.
“Morning,” Malfoy grumbled. He barely spared a glance Harry’s way, instead throwing disgusted looks around the house.
“Yeah,” he scratched the back of his head. “Me and Remus.”
“Of course, Potter. She’s my best friend.”
“Harry, meet Sirius, your godfather,” Melissa said.
“But I don’t know French.”
Beneath them, Snuffles jumped up, shaking the table, causing cutlery to clatter. He let out a sharp bark in Harry’s direction.
“It’s fine,” Harry chewed on his lip, thinking over what he had just been told. “I don’t really know what you want me to say.”
“Keep your mouth shut and let father do the talking. No emotional outburst. No disagreeing with father in front of the judge. You go along with everything he says, even if you don’t agree. He is going to win this, Harry. You have to trust us,” Draco’s voice whispered into Harry’s ears, making the hair on his neck stand up.
“I promise you I wasn’t. I want you to understand why I suggested that. So, can we try talking about this again?”
“I don’t think so.”
“I never said that, Potter.”
He waited until they were both out of view before slipping into the crowd. He heard buses start to pull out, the heavy engines booming in his ears. Sweat started beading on his forehead as he walked out of the crowd and away from the school.
“This is simply RIDICULOUS!”
Lucius was staring at his son with a raised eyebrow and a small smirk on his face. Draco felt his cheeks heat up as a small blush painted his cheeks. He looked to the floor, inspecting the dirt that covered his shoes.
Sorry this chapter was a bit rushed. I kind of imagined that as much as he is a bad dude, Lucius Malfoy does not condone child abuse, and so when he found out about Harry's relatives and saw him his 'Cut Throat Dad Mode'TM kicked in.
Draco hummed.
This chapter is not the best but I wanted to give you another update, so I apologise if its terrible.
Why wasn’t Harry letting go?
“No wonder you were acting so awkward this morning,” the words were still timid, but they held a hint of amusement.
(See the end of the chapter for
Let me know what you thought!
“That would be an ethical violation on his part, Potter. My Father is not an idiot.”
“Oh, Draco darling, calm down. I’m just chatting.”
“Hmm,” Sirius looked up. “Oh yeah, fine.”
“How are you getting home, Luna?” Draco asked when she finally finished.
“Oh, yes please.”
“I was just wondering if your friends knew you were a criminal. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why someone might need a lawyer, but you must have been truly desperate to go to my Father for help. Was your case too impossible for anyone else to consider taking you on?”
“Didn’t you ever notice anything weird with him and his relatives Remus?” Sirius leant forward, placing his elbows on the table.
“Uh, yeah. I moved back a couple of years ago,” Professor Lupin answered, rubbing the back of his neck. “I got a job teaching at Hogwarts, actually. It’s how I recognised Harry.”
“Yes, your Honour.”
On his birthday, Sirius went above anything Harry could have expected, pulling off a surprise birthday party. He had invited the Malfoys and Remus, whom Harry now called Moony, to attend the small barbeque Sirius had whipped up. The entire night had been overwhelming, but not in the way that dinner with the Weasleys usually was. Rather than the loud rambunctious crowd the Weasleys were, the party was small and intimate, full of birthday wishes, sincere chatter, and presents. When it came to dinner, Sirius and Moony were both thrilled watching Mr. Malfoy suffer as he attempted to eat a hamburger with a knife and fork, sitting and giggling like schoolgirls as they snuck glances at the struggling man.
“Watch me.”
When Harry had lived with the Dursleys, he had needed to catch a bus to school. It was always quick, but none of Harry’s friends travelled the same way as him.
“Ok then?”
When the manor finally came into view, Harry’s jaw dropped. The building looked at least five stories high. It was like a castle, smaller than Hogwarts, but only just. Its white walls were pristine, and colour stained windows lined the stories. He couldn’t imagine ever growing up in a house so remarkably large.
Harry tried to smile, but it came out as more of a grimace.
Harry was sitting on the edge of his bed when heard Sirius walk up the stairs, the footsteps approaching his bedroom door.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
A blush crossed across Draco’s face. He coughed.
“I couldn’t!”
Potter responded with a dark, dry laugh that melted into a sombre expression.
Harry nodded. His appetite was gone.
“Seriously, that’s all you got?”
So, yeah, Snuffles is a little homage to Sirius Animagus's form, because how could I not put that in, so I hope you like that.
Uncertain how to proceed in this mess of a date he stayed seated, waiting for Draco to return which took longer than he would have expected. Sadly, he realized, this would probably be the last chance they had at dating and that hurt. He really wanted to – well – get involved with beautiful, proud, cunning Draco but obviously he was simply not capable of handling this guy. Not because Draco was too much, maybe Harry was just not enough.
And then reality hit back in. There had been this guy hitting at him, getting too close and then there was Draco protecting him and then there was the kiss. Was is possible to kiss someone like that just to make sure other people believed they were here together? Maybe after all Draco was just a brilliant kisser and this meant nothing.
He could see the relief in the other man’s face and Harry wondered if this matter might be of higher importance to Mal- Draco as he himself would have thought. He still remembered the terrible eleven-year-old boy that wanted to be his friend in order to show him how the world spun. Harry smiled to himself. Somehow the situation was not that different. This time however it had been him who came to Draco for help. To Draco. Draco. Draco.
This year it were 15 people he toasted to. He started with his wife as he always did. He thanked her because she was the reason they all were here today.
Quite naturally, Daphne occupied her “throne” and Draco sat opposite of her, leaving the small but comfortable couch for Harry and Astoria. The latter chose to sit closely to her sister and go on chattering about the two guys kissing in the corner. That left Harry no choice but sit next to Draco. The pink-haired man had immediately been attacked by not only one but three bartenders who obviously seemed more interested in fulfilling his ever wish than in reacting to the crowd of people who had been waiting for their drinks a considering longer time than their group had. Harry was just about to turn around to the two girls and ask them what all that fuss was about when Draco had managed to get rid of the barkeepers and leaned very closely to asked him a simple question that in that moment meant quite a lot:
“Thank you for telling me, that was very brave of you. Thank you, I think I needed this for closure.”
She gave him a mixture of her “know-it-all” smile and a reassuring expression to validate the obviousness for her. Carefully caressing her cup of tea while glimpsing at little Hugo from the corner of her eyes she then explained: “Well, you have certainly spent a lot of time together in the last few months as well as whenever I see you, you have to tell me something amazing Draco did.”
Turning towards the blond, she finally acknowledged his presence once again.
He could not help but smile at the comparison of the Malfoy family manor to a literal snake pit. A few years ago, he would have definitely agreed with her but now things tended to be different. He was different, the world indeed was different, not so much black and white, god and evil.
With a loud groan Draco managed to break free only to rest his forehead against Harry’s, their lips millimetres apart. “Fuck, you are killing me,” he managed to whisper whilst our favourite Gryffindor tried to catch those lips again with his own, not willing to let go already.
For the at least twelfth time in a row, Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, fixing yet another stubborn strand of hair and practicing a serious look. To call his emotional status nervous would have been more than an underestimation. He was shaken to the bones, but let me be clear not because of what he was going to do. It was more the way he planned this to go down that scared him. Maybe this was why he had decided to spent such a huge amount of time on his looks. He was dressed to kill from his brand-new dress shoes over to his for once well-fitting pair of dark jeans paired with a simple white-collar shirt and a matching grey vest. Even his socks and belt were hand selected (not by himself but by the stylist he had asked for help, the one also responsible for his new haircut and styling).
Luckily Draco seemed able to read his mind and raised both eyebrows as if he was thinking hard.
Still, Harry was signalizing he had never, however, he was not so sure about the last question if he was being honest. In fourth grade he had been obsessed with Cedric Diggory and thinking about it now he wasn’t quite sure anymore if a part of him did not somehow consider the Hufflepuff quite attractive. Also, when Harry thought back to early Quidditch practice, the first thing that came to his mind was indeed Oliver Woods naked back in the showers. He slowed the head shaking down and managed to look at Malfoy once again, expecting the blond git to make fun of him. But he did not, instead he made himself comfortable, took another sip from his drink and leaned back.
This one cryptic phrase kept spinning in his mind the whole next day when they had their hangover tradition watching telly and ordering huge amounts of food. He really wanted to ask Draco what he meant with that. If he thought about Harry in – in a sexual way. If he liked him or if he was simply too much to stand. What was the purpose of explaining who he had been, of reminding Harry they once stood on opposite sides? Making clear it was already enough work to be friends? Suggesting they did something wrong? Admitting he wanted more?
After the movie had ended, they looked at each other in confusion and did not really know how to continue. Harry felt as if the distance between them had grown into a giant void which he was not capable of overcoming. The other man seemed so far away as in another version of this reality; one Harry could not enter.
There would be enough to talk about for the world in a few minutes, his outer appearance should not be one of them he had decided beforehand. With a last glance to his mirror-self (whom he could have sworn was winking back!) he turned around.
Harry looked up into her loving face and wondered if she already knew.
He still asked himself how they ended up sitting so far apart. Maybe it was because Draco had lounged himself on the couch so carelessly as if he owned the place. Maybe it was because the other man took so much space Harry could not have helped it and would have had to touch the other one automatically when trying to fit on the couch as well. Or maybe it was this whole atmosphere of expectation revolving around them that made it so unbelievably hard to actually do anything.
Draco suggested a small muggle café just outside Diagon Alley where they would not be recognized so easily which Harry happily agreed on as he grew annoyed with the stares the moment, they left the Ministry. Interestingly he got most of the attention and not the pink-haired man next to him. When he turned to Draco, sharing his thoughts, the other man giggled in the maybe cutest way Harry had ever seen someone do and our favourite Gryffindor once again noticed how hard he had already fallen for the former Slytherin. Mischief blinking in his eyes Draco carelessly explained to Harry that not wearing a Glamour anymore did not automatically mean people would recognize him. Harry watched him in astonishment.
“Sorry, I am not really a huge kisser, Harry,” he explained loudly with what sounded almost like hurt in his voice. For the next part he looked up again: “And you don’t seem to be much of a drinker either, huh?” If our Golden Boy had not really been quite drunk, he might have noticed the vulnerability in Draco’s eyes. But in his current state he just managed to nod when Draco offered him some water and later on did not resist the offered couch to crush on for the night. It had been a long day form him and a lot of things had changed. Maybe he should apologize to Draco for kissing him, he thought right before he fell asleep. ‘Although, isn’t it weird to apologize for something I liked?’
“Oh dear, innocent Harry. For Draco the Night Life is ‘nothing more than a giant buffet of chances to flirt and hook up with beautiful strangers to fall in love for only one night to then become a distant memory.’”  From the concentrated look on her face he could tell that she actually seemed to be quoting someone. Had Draco really said such a thing at any time, he wondered. Of course, Harry had noticed the continuous attempts at flirting but all of them were directed onto him and no one else. Was he currently functioning as a wild card for the other man who tried so hard to be his friend and maybe had changed his behaviour patterns because of that? Was flirting with Harry Draco’s way of avoiding flirting with anyone else? The insecurity concerning the other man came straight back and once again our favourite Gryffindor had a hard time remembering what Hermione had just told him. He needed to take his time and find out whether he really was interested in Draco as a person before starting to overthink every move the other might make or not.
Sometimes Harry wondered, how Draco would even get to know potential partners. As his first and only relationship had developed out of a long friendship and all his friends in relationships (which were Hermione and Ron, to be honest) had known their partners from back at school, he had absolutely no clue as where one could go to meet new people, though this would certainly change after the night that lay before or Hero.
“You know, Hermione told me you have been hanging around with Malfoy for a while now and I kept wondering if you pitied him or something. It never struck me that it could have anything to do with why you left Ginny, but it has, hasn’t it? You hate it when you get something free just because of your name, you never use your fame for other people. Unless you like them. Like
Harry patiently waited for him to finish as he knew how much Draco hated to be interrupted before answering: “This is not what I meant, and you very well know that! And just for your information my wanking fantasies and wet dreams in the weeks since we were hanging around clearly indicate that I am indeed very gay!”
“Yes, we started talking recently and, well Malf – I mean Draco – and I somehow became somethings like friends you could say,” he managed to answer after having taken one or two seconds to long. While talking about friendship he had stumbled about calling the other guy by his last name. If they actually wanted to become friends, they should use their first names, shouldn’t they? The name Malfoy reminded him of the git back in school who made their lives miserable. It was only logical to call him Draco now, wasn’t it? It sounded like a new start.
If Harry was one thing then it was absolutely sure that he wanted to trick Draco into sending more pictures. Even more than that he would have loved to touch that delicious part of skin temptingly peeking out of the pulled down towel. The sharp hipbones were clearly visible, the muscles leading downwards well defined and Harry could definitely tell now that Draco might be lean but in excellent shape. He wondered how it would feel to run his fingers over the sensitive skin, his tongue following.
Therefore, it was quite a shock when he publicly announced a press conference in which he wanted to finally state his reasons behind the breakup with his former girlfriend and “put an end to the rumours concerning my sexuality” as he had written to all the large papers. That was Hermione’s wording by the way.
Before clicking on the play button, the dark-haired man realized how much he actually was looking forward to hearing Draco’s voice and grinned sheepishly. There was no way he could even tell himself he was not crazy about the other bloke. And right now, maybe this was not one sided at all. I mean, he immediately responded.
Harry had tried his best to prepare himself mentally to see Draco without his Glamour. The blond man obviously wore one as well, our Golden Boy had successfully concluded. He had tried to imagine what his former rival was hiding under the enchantment. He had considered a tiny but tasteful tattoo, maybe even an earring but by Merlin was he not prepared for what he was actually seeing right now.
From time to time he glimpsed at the telly, but rather because he felt like he should instead of actually paying any interest until suddenly he noticed something. There was a very handsome Asian man with a rather huge amount of glitter around his eyes making a drink for a not an inch less handsome other guy. There was a lot on tension built up in the scene and clearly the characters were drawn to each other but this was not the thing that made him look more closely. It was the clothes the first man was wearing. He knew them.
“Malfoy,” Harry answered.
[...] the excitement was great in the village, for the day of the spell casting had finally come. From her room, Theodesia watched the young people gather in front of the town hall. The girls had adorned their hair in ribbons and stood to one side, huddled together like a flock of geese, while the boys stood opposite, waiting anxiously in their Sunday’s best. When the elder walked through the doors, the chatter ceased and silence fell on the congregation. Theodesia felt that she should have been out there with them, but she knew the marks of her skin would only seal her fate, for she was doomed to love him who she could not have. She held back her tears as she watched the elder cast the spell on the crowd. Then, each young person came forward to write their full name in the sacred book of the town, as the others surveyed their skin with anticipation or fear, in case the name appeared. One by one, the young people were paired off, some taking each other in their arms with unmasked glee and others approaching their designated soulmate with careful glances. Soon, they were all paired off and Theodesia was left alone in her room to consider the cruel trick fate had played on her.
, there were dark, dangerous, powerful people back then who would have done horrible things with those artifacts. And this, in essence, is why grandad asked for my help: to find those objects, to destroy them, to ensure that peace remained.
I hope it helps you find happiness,
Harry almost let himself think,
He collapses down onto the bed, and you’re still for a while, the both of you. He’s stretched out with his arms above his head, all long, graceful limbs and glorious expanses of ivory skin, and you try to commit the intimate softness of him to memory. You want to hold him. You want to kiss him. You move your hand to caress his skin but you think better of it before you touch him—he’s not in love, you remember. He’ll remind you often enough, with knife blade words and throw-away comments that feel like blows to the teeth. It’s just sex for him, you remember. You’re just a pretty face to fuck, just a schoolboy fantasy to have and to discard.
I’m still not entirely sure why I agreed. I had sins to atone for, of course - I didn’t do everything right, during the war,
He tosses and he turns for several hours before he gives up and gets up and gets dressed. Then, he sits at the desk. Stands up. Paces around the room. Runs his hand through his hair. Sits again. There is a hole in the middle of his chest, shaped like Draco, and the anticipation is turning his blood into ants (running in his veins and burrowing chambers into his lungs.) He decides he might as well walk to the lighthouse
Try as he might, Harry cannot find sleep.
My body springs into action of its own volition and I chase after him. “Kiss me, you coward,” I yell, startling a small herd of old ladies on a guided tour. It does not make him stop and by the time I make it into room 41, I have to admit I’ve lost all trace of him.
I love you, Draco. I’ve loved you for longer than I’ve known. I’m fairly sure I was in love with you in sixth-year when I followed you around all the time. I might have been in love with you before that.
“Might as well be,” Draco answers in a voice that sounds like someone cut him open and hollowed him out entirely (scooped out the heart of him, the blood of him, the lungs and the breath of him.) “It’s not living, is it? Being trapped here, alone.”
You are no longer welcome here, and there is no amount of degnoming that will make me forget what you did.
) When Harry finally felt the cresting waves of orgasm wash over him like a tsunami, and shudder-moaned Draco’s name, Draco would hold him tight, telling him all the while that
And she is not wrong, reader, but this is not where this story should begin, is it? No, if you are to share her anger, if you are to partake in her righteous outrage, we ought to start at the beginning. We ought to start with Harry Potter.
The facade is bright orange and gaudy yellow, and it is a stark contrast to the sleek dark wood of the “Patrician Potions.” There is a large sign, running the full length of the building. It says “Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes.” If we were to go inside, reader, we’d find children, excitedly holding up novelty objects, and teenagers, looking for the next prank to play on unsuspecting friends or authority figures. If we stayed there long enough, carefully covering our ears every time someone came too close to the display of screaming yo-yos, we’d spot a redhead, too, frantically running around with armfuls of boxes and toys.
Someone must have cast the spell on me, I realise. I push myself to my feet. And the people who love meddling with my life, I know only too well, also love informing me that they have. I walk to the pile of unopened letters sitting on the small wooden table in the kitchen and I take a deep breath. This is going to take a while.
The black-haired nuisance is back! He caught aunt Gnomina and swung her around before chucking her over the garden wall. An entertaining sight. Tried to catch me but failed. Noticed he was wearing gloves, this time.
I end up promising Pansy that I’ll look into that apothecary if nothing else. I know I shouldn’t because new cases should be run by my boss, but thinking about Draco’s death has never caused me to make a single good decision in my life so I tell her I’ll see what I can do. She stands up brisk and businesslike, wiping the smudged traces of wet mascara from her cheeks, and she shakes my hand.
I read it’s easy to break. Do you know anything about that?
“I’m pretty certain the ghosts are why the house won’t bond with you,” Draco tells Harry as he stands in the middle of his room, mere metres away from his bed. (Harry thinks he’ll burst with the thought.) “They’ve lived there for years. The house has to be protective of them. After all, it failed them, hasn’t it? It was a sanatorium, it was meant to be a place of healing, not a place of death. I think it feels guilty still and it’s trying to protect the ghosts in any way it can.”
Iris is smiling as she floats towards them, her arm around the waist of a pretty girl with bright lipstick, several piercings and outrageously pink coloured hair.
“Harry, you said you bought a house,” Draco repeats as Harry turns the key in the lock of one of the French doors. “Why on earth did you acquire this giant mess of a thing?”
Harry lifts his head and stares at Iris. She’s hovering in the air and staring right back, an eyebrow cocked up in obvious confusion.
And yet, this is exactly what he does. I find myself alone in room 50, staring confusedly into a piece of embellished bronze.
The moment stretches for an eternity. You try not to breathe, and you try not to think because Draco’s skin is touching your skin, because Draco’s breath is caressing your cheek, because Draco’s eyes are gazing into yours, and they’re bright as stars and hot as molten metal, and you could drown in those eyes, you think. You could die for those eyes.
Sometimes, after Draco leaves, you forget how to be alive, because everything’s brighter when he’s around. Everything’s warmer and more beautiful. And those nights? They’re the worst. You stay awake for hours, you stare at the white-grey walls of your room and you realise that you’ve gone and fallen head over heels in love with another man. A man you can’t have. A man you shouldn’t want. A man who will never love you back.
“I want you to fuck me,” you whisper into the shell of his ear. He freezes.
And when you finally push the door of your flat open, you undress in calm, deliberate motions, and you take a shower. The water does not burn you. You do not punch the tiled wall. You do not even scream or cry. You decide you’ll never see Draco again and you don’t feel a thing.
Harry does not want to step inside Malfoy Manor. He does not want to use Draco’s Floo. (Does not want to remember what Draco’s face looked like in the soft flicker candlelight, does not want to remember the scent of Draco’s skin and how soft it felt under his fingers.)
“You can’t deny that you are gay, Mr Potter. We have pictures proving the fact. But we would appreciate confirmation, perhaps an interview? It would be a shame if we had to publish those pictures without your approval, now, wouldn’t it?”
He rolls around without so much as looking at you.
“When I saw you, I figured there was no way you’d stay. Not you. Not for me.”
You turn away from him, cradling the bottle in your arms like a petulant child. He crouches beside you, tries to pry it out of your hands. You won’t let go, and the amber liquid sloshes dangerously behind the cold glass. You give the bottle a sharp tug, and then, all of a sudden, you’re flat on your back and Draco’s lying on top of you. The bottle rolls away from you, the liquid slowly spilling on the floor in small, sticky puddles. Neither of you notices.
Draco is standing in the corridor outside your office and every minute detail of the night before comes rushing back to you—the fear and the want, the shame and the recklessness, too.
“I ran almost every diagnostic spell I know,” he says, vanishing the glowing lines with his wand, “I don’t have the first idea of what’s wrong with this place.”
“Can you tell me why you think that?” I ask, shuffling the case files on my desk in search of a quill.
The second time the exploding extension explodes, Harry Potter has been sitting at his desk and thinking about Draco Malfoy for longer than he cares to admit. In fact, Harry hasn’t been able to think about anything but Draco since the first explosion, seventy-four hours, fifty-one minutes and twelve seconds ago. And all the while, the blinds to the office of “Patrician Potions” have been closed, and Harry thinks he’ll go entirely mad if they stay closed any longer.
You have three questions. I reserve the right to not answer them if I think they give away too much.
“I didn’t tell anyone,” Harry replies. The words are fragile and quiet between them, now. Their voices careful, their bodies still. Neither dares to move or breathe or speak too loud, afraid that it might break the spell, this blissful island of calm and warmth among the infinite ocean of pain and grief that somehow became their lives. “I couldn’t, you know? It hurt too much, coming back. I couldn’t bear to even think about it. I couldn’t bear to think I got to come back when Remus and Tonks and Fred didn’t get the chance, not when I wasn’t sure I even wanted to live.”
Harry feels strong hands at his shoulders, guiding him gently towards the ground. Under his naked back: Draco’s heavy wool robes. Scattered in his hair: yellow-crackle leaves. Hanging about his head: the fog-cotton skies. And all around him, oh, all around him: Draco. Draco. Draco.
Soft wind blows through Harry’s hair, and waves crash all around him, and still, he walks. His face is wet and salt seeps into his mouth as the sea spray kisses his skin (as tears escape from the dam that has been building across his throat ever since he set foot on the island, earlier still, since he took a portkey to Romania, perhaps. Ever since he ran and never looked back.)
Harry walks back towards the house.
Much has been speculated on how much the rise of the sacred twenty-eight influenced its falling out of favour, and it is the subject of heated debate in academic circles. One thing we do know, however, know, is that in 1726, a young man by the name of Thaddeus Syrenus Travers, who was engaged to be married to a well-born young lady, found himself under the influence of the spell. His family went to great lengths to keep condition quiet but scandal broke out when it turned out the family’s milkmaid had his handwriting all over her skin. Thaddeus’ uncle, Perseus Travers gives the following account of the incident in his personal diary:
There is an entire rainforest under your skin, filled with a million tiny lives and a million tiny deaths, and you’re not sure how to deal with it.
“You remember me, right? Aaron Woodbridge? Used to play chaser for Ravenclaw when you were in Second Year?”
You must think your
Sometimes, what everyone sees in you is not who you are. Sometimes, you live your entire life thinking you know yourself and then, you realise that you really don’t. Sometimes, you think you have your entire life all figured out and then everything you thought you wanted turns out to be everything you hate and you don’t even know what to do anymore.
The house refused to be loved.
“I can’t really explain in a way that doesn’t make me sound crazy.” She pauses and laughs, dry and hollow. It sounds like nerves and exhaustion. “And Merlin forbid I sound crazy in front of an Auror, lest he dismisses my case entirely.”
“Oh, of course not,” Malfoy spits, his grey eyes unreadable and cold. “How would it look to the wizarding world, their saviour liking to be fucked by other men? You’re supposed to marry your childhood sweetheart and breed little hero sprogs to keep up morale, isn’t that right?”
Draco isn’t anywhere to be found on the ground floor. The paint strips are still sitting in sad little heaps along the walls. Harry breathes.
“Det verkar vara något fel på din magiska kvintessens. Jag hade kollat upp det om jag var du, men tills dess så kan jag kasta en översättningsformel åt dig om du vill?” he adds, lazily waving and whispering a spell under his breath.
It wasn’t a conscious decision, breaking up with Draco; it was one Harry only realised he’d taken once it was over with, and by then, he was already too far gone to do anything about it.
“I, oh, I love you—oh Harry, oh love, oh love, oh,” Draco cries under him, grabbing the mattress with both hands as he lifts his hips to meet Harry’s thrust. “You feel so good, oh you feel so good, oh Harry, you make me feel so good. Oh, Harry, I’d forgotten. Oh don’t stop, don’t stop...”
“As I was saying,” Draco continues with a frown, “there are many ghosts in this place, and they’re very anxious about what you intend to do with the building. It’s been home to them for several decades now, and they’re not keen on being banished or having to share their space with rude hotel guests or businessmen on fancy seminars.”
“Instead, I decided to come back and found myself alone on a battlefield and every single cell in my body screamed for days. Instead, I came back and so many people died all the same and now I have to carry that grief everywhere I go and I have no idea how to do it. It was the right thing to do, I know, but I regret it, somedays.”
“Or what, you’ll continue burning things down?” Draco replies because he doesn’t know how to express all the things that live in his chest.
Pansy softens a bit at your words. She uncrosses her arms and rests them gently in her lap.
When you don’t hear from Malfoy for the next two weeks, you pretend it doesn’t bother you. And why would it? All there ever was between you was a drunken fuck because you were desperate and heartbroken. It happens, you tell yourself. It happens.
Mrs Malfoy takes a sip of her drink. When she speaks again, her voice is clear and perfectly controlled:
Were Harry Potter a different person, reader, a more emotionally healthy person, perhaps, he’d simply resolve the issue by knocking on Draco’s door. By inviting him for a drink, maybe. By ringing the bell on the counter and requesting a potion, even. But you must understand: things are not that simple for Harry Potter.
“I know he’s an idiot, Potter, I’ve met him. Everyone knows that he loves you, and if you can’t see that, then you might just be the one person in the entire world who’s even more of an idiot than he is.”
I smile at both of them. We’ll be okay, the three of us. We’ll be okay. We’ve always been okay, haven’t we? We’ve lived through so much and made it through to the other side, and we’ll just do it once again. We’ll do it as many times as we need to.
Finished digging my new burrow. Great-uncle Gnomer went on a three-hour tangent about how they used to dig burrows back in his day. Bit his arm to make him stop. Did not see blond nuisance today.
Then, when I’ve quite finished feeling sorry for myself, I resolve not to let him run away from me. I take my journal out of my pocket and decisively walk back to room 50, sheepishly smiling at the old ladies as I walk past them again.
As the world fades to black around me, Aaron’s smile is the last thing I see, and it makes me want to be sick.
In the rare moments that you’re not feeling too much or nothing at all, in the rare moments when you can remember how to function in this world, you think about Draco.
You bring your pint to your lips, draining the amber liquid in one swallow. The alcohol sets fire to your bloodstream. It doesn’t make anything better. Ron is still laughing, and Draco is still looking at you with his metal-heavy gaze, and your chest is still about to burst from the firework explosion of every human feeling at once.
And when Harry grows too still and too quiet, with no waves at all, and when algae creeps into his airways and threatens to smother him entirely, Draco slips outside of the castle at night, and picks a single water lily bloom from the waters of the lake and leaves it outside the door to Harry’s common room in hopes he’ll realise that water creates  life, always (in the waters of the lake, were thirteen silver fish, long and straight like arrows)
“I have to use your bathroom quickly, I will be right back,” he heard Draco say.
Harry could be so sure of this because in another picture he was facing the taller man, bearing the same exact expression on his face. It was uncanny. Not only did he fancy Draco, this was true the other way around as well. Draco liked him and therefore kissing was hard for him. It was not a game to him.
I don’t know if anyone did not witness my breakup with Ginny Weasley or that I never addressed the matter publicly – I honestly have never addressed anything concerning my private life in front of so many people to be honest. However, I decided now is the time.
And so, he did tell her about what he was planning on doing and why he wanted her to know beforehand. She nodded and instead of telling him off like Hermione even encouraged him to do so, telling him this sounded so much like something her children (and maybe she not only meant Tonks but Remus and Sirius as well) would have done. When he started to explain to her how much Draco had changed however, she cut him off.
The last few lines made his heart jump a bit. If arguing with Draco always went like this, he would be glad. Not that he intended on hurting the other man any further. And in the side note he was ‘Harry’. He went to work eagerly thinking about what to send to Draco next to please the disgruntled dragon.
Well, every story needs a start. Let's see, what Witch Weekly thinks about Draco
Introducing Daphne Greengrass to Harry and Harry to Draco's private life.
With that thought came the anger. An evil feeling that started deep down in his bowls and fought his way up through his stomach into his chest where it grew into an unidentified mess that felt dark and under pressure. Something that definitely wanted out.
“Actually, I gave up smoking when I started tattooing my arm. I decided it would be a waste of money and time if I kept hurting my body with this shit when I was willing to suffer through this pain to create something that would last.”
“I never had a boyfriend.”
Blowing a frustrated big breath out of his nose Harry looked around in Grimmauld Place. Before hanging around his new group of friends he had never realized how huge an empty house could feel like, how lonely indeed it was. He had tried more than once to envision this dark place as a home, at least for some people in the past. Looking at the heavy tapestry on the walls, it was hard to imagine this had even been a home to a family. Still he knew for a long time the black family used to meet up here regularly.
He did not expect an answer at all and therefore the carefully folded letter appearing on his doorstep without the trace of any owl took him by surprise. The thick parchment felt heavy in his hands and he would have wondered who sent it were it not for the dark green wax seal closing it. The intricate design featured the letters
Later, Harry explained to himself that it was the fact he got such a compliment from another man – a very fashionable one – that made his heart skip a bit. It had nothing to do with the fact that it came from a very pink haired man with very grey eyes and a very nice smile.
Nervously turning the small business card over and over again, Harry had of course arrived at the address way to early. Instead of 5 p.m. he had been sitting there since four, eagerly waiting for whatever evil surprise Malfoy had planned for him. If he was going to be fast enough to notice the malevolent plan, maybe he could still escape the worst.
“Oh no, I am not hiding anymore. I really thought hard about how to top your entrance and outing to the whole Wizarding world yesterday and could not come up with anything as genius therefore I came to the conclusion to simply let the public do what they always do: Gossip.”
“Yeah, imagine Teddy telling you how he told your mother what happened in the series. It’s ridiculous!”
Harry, who got a hang on how much of the sugary cocktail stuff was good for him pretty soon decided it was time to take a break from little Miss Dancing Queen and sit next to Astoria. She was casually nipping on her beer when he joined her. Quickly she drew his attention towards the other end of the bar where Draco was having a rather lively conversation with a tall brown-haired guy who – Harry had to admit that being only the tiniest bit envious – looked stunning with his scruffy chin and the tight shirt. The bloke was obviously flirting with Draco who neither seemed to mind it nor react positively towards the efforts.
It took Harry a moment to realize Draco meant him and he just looked confused. He was really insecure about what to say next, luckily Draco seemed to notice that and continued.
Draco gave him a crooked smile, in between actually being proud of himself really knowing his cartoons and certainly having found something to mock Harry with.
“You really want to make this work, do you?”
Now it was Draco’s time to blankly stare at the other man unable to react in any other manner. He pulled his eyebrows so far together that they almost met at the top of his head and pushed back his chin making him look rather stupid. This was clearly not a direction he suspected the conversation to go at all.
on it, Harry noticed. Maybe they all had it.
“You can have your own, if you don’t feel like sharing”, Harry offered, hoping to have hit the nail on the head. His counterpart could not stop his own mouth from twitching towards the bottom left corner of his face, obviously trying to hide the disgust in his expression before shaking his head.
This brings us back to the day 17 days after the breakup. Harry was still sitting in said coffee shop, staring at the back of a well-known, blond haired man and wondering if he was actually checking out the other man.
Nothing on that piece of carton pointed towards Draco being connected to healing or anything but indeed it explained a lot about why the other man might struggle finding clients. A lot of the old wizarding families had kept their heirlooms through and after the war, secretly storing them in mansions on the countryside. Not all of them used to be connected to Voldemort, not all were Death Eaters, some just had a fable for old magic things. He would know, his department had to investigate in those cases from time to time.
“I grew up without knowing about my family and it would have meant the world to me if I had a living relative. Any you are refusing him this chance?”
He had asked himself those questions constantly after they had actually broken up three months ago. It was Ginny's idea to keep it a secret until Ball season would start again. She told him like this the press would have other stories to cover and therefore less capacity to focus on him. She was right about that. After one week, his face disappeared from the covers, after two weeks, the double features became rare and today was the first day he hadn't spotted his own face on any newspaper except the Witch Weekly feature of him being the most wanted bachelor of the Wizarding World.
Harry Potter is brilliant at a lot of things. The most important examples for that would be defeating evil Dark Lords and constantly getting into a lot of trouble. Lesser known talents include cooking, being lazy on Sundays and having the ability to instantly charm any toddler. Small talk is not mentioned on this list for a good reason.
Harry could see from here that the material was rather scratchy but Draco did not complain. Instead he thoughtlessly caressed the knitted fabric on his arms, turning towards his boyfriend as if he had just noticed him.
She frowned and crossed her arms, pulling together her eyebrows furiously. Her voice sounded a bit offended even though her answer was challenging.
For the very first time in his life Harry James Potter had willingly decided to dress up to go out. Is was not the Ministry nor his friends telling him to put on some nice clothes but his very own desire to look good (and maybe impress one particular other male). He went with nothing too bold but already something way out of his comfort zone. The black jeans were tighter than he was used to wear them which did not mean they clung to his skin at all or anything like that, they simply gave away the idea that in fact Harry Potter had a rather decent bum. At least he thought so but let’s not start on that matter again. He had paired the pants with a form fitting black and white button up featuring a choker neckline which he hoped would make him seem taller.
Harry was definitely not sure what he meant by that phrase. The girls? The party? The club? Their seats? Or maybe he was referring to the whole evening? Or did he actually mean the two kissing guys Daniel and whomever? Harry noticed himself grinning at his counterpart wildly. He kept looking through the room where people of all skin colour and sexual orientation were dancing. He could spot some adorable Drag Queens as well as a few other kissing couples and he really, really felt comfortable. It was way too loud and overcrowded. The air was full of different smells – not all of them pleasant - and still: He loved it.
Blue was a colour that actually suited Draco Malfoy very well. It made the grey in his eyes pop out even more than usually and it emphasized the cool undertones of his skin, giving the impression of Veela blood running through his family. The soft edge of the expensive looking cashmere wool pullover caressed his throat and chin, surrounding him with an aura of luxury. His long pale fingers tended to touch his sleeves whenever he was nervous but trying his best to hide it. He looked gorgeous.
After reading through the short text two more times, checking every word carefully for a second, secret meaning he signed the parchment. If he had looked up during his studies, he would have noticed Malfoy who could not hold back an amused grin when he noticed Harry’s mistrust.
The latter looked up from the phone and turned around to the kitchen, but not without shouting back: “Well, she is not wrong about me obviously liking you and I can’t believe you were taking showers just to impress me, that is kind of sweet and disturbing. But now listen to Parkinson, put away that phone and help me with that pizza. We have a ton of food in here and a lot of stupid stuff to watch on the telly as an excuse to snog even more.”
“As much as I would love to devour each and every millimetre of your delicious body right now, starting from your neck down you chest, sucking your dick until you beg me to let you cum only to fuck you senseless and repeat all of that all over again for the next three days until you are incapable of even sitting up, let’s not rush things, ok?”
It was worse than he could have imagined.
Afterwards he was not sure who started it but their tongues were touching, exploring fighting and he wondered if this was indeed the equivalent of their encounters at school but put onto a whole new level of physical excitement. His knees feel like he would collapse any second and the only thing capable of stabilizing him would be leaning in even more. This was everything. He could not decide what was the best part of that. The feeling of kissing someone, the knowledge that the other person wanted to touch him as much, the sturdiness of another man’s body pressed against his own or the unbelievable smell of his counterpart.
“Are you free this weekend?”, he asks playfully even though he very well knows Harry always tries to keep his weekends free so they could spend time together and do things.
Harry lifted his eyebrows in utter surprise. This was clearly not a moment where he would have expected to hear Pansy Parkinson’s name mentioned. He looked at Draco puzzled who in return leant forward to let their foreheads touch. Draco had to lean down quite a bit which to Harry seemed to be uncomfortable but the former Slytherin seemed rather happy with the new position. The feeling of being so close to someone you so desperately want to touch was both new and intoxicating at once to Harry and he wondered if he might actually feel physical pain when their touch ended. Perhaps it would be better if it did not end at all. Nevertheless, he was curious about why Pansy Parkinson would get any credit for their current situation.
There were certain things that had always defined Harry. His name, the famous scar, him belonging to Gryffindor, the prophecy. None of them he had chosen himself. Not for the first time he wondered what kind of person he would have become if he was not born Harry Potter. It had taken him a lot of effort to overcome the fact he would never know his born family. Losing Sirius and then Remus had reopened that scarcely healed wound once more, something the outside world somehow did not seem to realise.
Draco brought out into laughter and Harry almost died.
When everyone else was busy continuing their life, moving on after the war, he somehow felt like he was starting a new one. A life where he could choose the direction it should go to. A chance for a restart with all possibilities lying open in front of him, the world waiting for him to make his choice. Holding their breath.
Holding two bags of takeaways food in his left hand, Draco Malfoy had just entered the room and noticed it was Harry sitting on the couch. The former Slytherin seemed to momentarily be frozen into place, the sleeveless white shirt hanging loosely from his body while his right hand was carelessly brushing through his hair. Which was not neatly combed back but messy. And in a bun. And bright pink. The colour automatically reminded Harry of fluffy stuffed animals and cotton candy. If that alone had not been confusing enough, Draco’s arms were full on covered in black and white tattoos. His bottom lip was pierced on the left side, a tiny silver ring curved around it.
While speaking, he looked Harry dead into the eyes, his voice sounding something between mildly offended and amused at the same time. Our beloved golden boy had to swallow hard before answering. Still, he was scared of insulting the other man and therefore giving him a reason not to meet up and talk anymore. Harry quite enjoyed these small encounters quite much.
Harry figured telling him the straight forward truth like a true Gryffindor would maybe not succeed. So, going like ‘I have more than a crush on you and I think you fancy the shit out of me as well, so I thought this would be a great way to get to know you better’ was out of question. Coming up with a stupid reason would only make him look suspicious as he knew from his personal history, he was a more than bad liar.
It was Daphne who got her countenance back together first and managed to grin in Draco’s direction, making it clear they were talking about him right now. A raised eyebrow was the only answer she got but Harry noted in his mind that in fact the other man seemed to be rather curious.
Charlie was out to his family and friends but not publicly. It felt more like a not so secret secret shared by a larger number of people. He had never been seen dating a bloke nor had he brought someone home yet. If he had a partner, nobody in the family knew. Malfoy had approached the matter differently. Harry estimated that the number of people knowing about Charlie being gay must equal the amount of witches and wizards not being aware that the sole heir to the Malfoy family was riding his broom the other way around.
Staring at him blankly without blinking even once, Draco Malfoy, the undeniable eloquent aristocrat who never seems to be short of a sharp but thrillingly entertaining response, finally looked shaken. He seemed very unsure as what to make out of this question, but honestly, who wouldn't?
“Alright, I think we are good to go”, Draco explains while winking at Harry who again is staring at his boyfriend. Most of the time his partner tries to present himself in a very masculine way as if he had to prove he was still a man even though he was gay. Seeing him with the pink and feminine glasses on was something different. Not that they did not suit him but at this point in their relationship Harry was almost absolutely sure there was nothing Draco could not make work.
All of the former courage had left the Gryffindor and he could barely stand to even look into Malfoys direction anymore. Instead he focused on his neglected coffee mug and desperately wished he had never asked this stupid question. Not Malfoy. Not after the blond git had already let shine through, he was very well aware of the constant starring. How stupid could one single person be, Harry wondered. There was absolutely no reason for Malfoy to not simply get up and straight forward tell the press about this weird conversation. Harry could already read the new headlines: “Malfoy heir molested by the Chosen One” “The third wheel in the Potter relationship was in fact a man – Harry’s man!”
Which was silly because it was not the first time Molly ever hear such a thing.
“And then the part of you marrying Harry! As if Dad was in a rush to finally get his Golden Boy to settle down. I still can’t believe you could keep a straight face!”
Draco’s left eyebrow rose by at least one inch before he replied, obviously trying everything to make sense out of Harry’s behaviour before he replied.
Meanwhile the bathroom door opened and Harry could hear footsteps once again. This time it was Draco who made his way to the couch, hair still damp, rubbing his face with a towel. He also was wearing comfortable clothes, something Harry would have never imagined him in. It was a plain white shirt and some joggers hanging loose around his waist and still Draco managed to look stylish. Not that Harry dared to look for too long. He was way too embarrassed because of what he had done the night before and therefore starred at the black screen of the telly on the opposite wall.
For all the wizards and witches out there, he was The Man Who Lived Twice, the born hero, Auror and pride of the community. But maybe, just maybe the time had come to reinvent himself. But was it to early for an outing? Was being in love – because this had to be love, the feelings were way to strong for a simple crush – enough to make such an announcement?
”, Draco mumbled to himself, following Harry’s gaze with his eyes, “I will face my fears. A promise to never again let someone else determine what I want to do with my life and who I have to be.”
“That’s the Flower of Life,” she had explained after noticing his look, carefully applying sunscreen to every tattoo except the skull and the snake. Her arm also featured the banner with
“So that means you came like this because you are hidden in plain sight and nobody knows who you are?”
“Is it really that apparent?”, he asked in a quiet voice, making sure Ron would not overhear them by accident. There would be a place and time when he felt it was right to inform his best friend about his sexual preferences but today was not that day.
“And maybe you are playing for the same team as me.”
Harry took another sip of his ice-cold coffee and blankly stared in front of him. He had already been sitting in the small coffee shop for at least an hour. While the people around him were either engaged in conversations or just simply playing with their phones, he just sat there quietly and stared at the table on the other side of the tiny terrace.
Three shots later he found himself not at the outer corner anymore but in the middle of the crowd, moving his body carelessly to the music, hands linked with Astoria who was obviously enjoying herself. Again, it was her who helped him ease up. First, he had only followed her movements and felt a bit weird but the light intoxication had helped him with the overthinking and now he quite enjoyed it. Astoria’s dancing reminded him of a snake winding in between obstacles. She managed to not really touch anyone but gave the impression as if she almost would.
“What do you mean with that?”, Harry asked, wonder as well as a little hurt swinging in his voice.
By 18:40 he was completely and utterly sure he had screwed up big times and every possible chance of getting closer to Draco now was out of his reach once again. How was it possible for one person to so much suck at texting? How could he be so bad at something so very basic?
He returned to the kitchen to once again be shook to the ground. Draco and Molly were still in there even though the Punch seemed to be finished by now. This could have been a normal scenery considering how awkward this evening was in total except for one little detail:
“I am trying to save whatever your roommate has left over and turn it into something edible for a guest I don’t know! Don’t worry, I will be gone long before your little party starts!”, he snarled back at the other man. If his help was not wanted, why did they ask for him! There were a lot of things, Harry was capable of being made fun of for. His cooking was not one of them.
“You can’t be serious! It is so pretentious to insist on such an outdated opinion on a matter of this political scale,” Hermione was repeating herself once again, disbelieve in her eyes. Draco, sitting opposite of her leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and stared at her, ready to start the argument all over again.
to do. However, he had a favour to ask his best friend before fulfilling his plan. A big one. One, Harry knew he should have come up with without having to be told to. He had almost forgotten a conversation he definitely owed someone.
He stood up from his chair and leaned towards an unmoving Harry, his arms so close our golden boy was forced to look at the Dark Mark, study the intricate lines of the tattoo revolving around it. In the centre, everything was dark and his eyes had a hard time finding a path to follow which would lead to the light.
His hair was still combed back and as longish as it had been for the past months, however, now it was held back by a very elegant ribbon instead of a more masculine piece of jewellery. His pants fit just this tiny bit too well around his buttocks to make absolutely sure everyone could get a perfect glimpse at his behind. His gestures lacked the forced edge, he moved more like a Veela than ever before. All in all he seemed more comfortable in his own skin than ever without having given up his masculinity at all but still more emphasising his delicate feature.
Harry knows by now that Draco still often tries to impress him and only shows his best behaviour. He is still obsessed with what people think of him – well certain people. Harry and his family to be precise. But Harry prefers Draco with his guards down.
But tonight felt different. Tonight, he was missing someone he could actually have. Someone alive. Someone who made his heart race. A man he had to constantly think about, even when he was asleep and for the first time Harry Potter felt like a normal person.
Draco seemed to have noticed his sudden hesitance as he broke away from the kiss to look into Harry’s eyes. Something our favourite Gryffindor would have appreciated any other moment in his life but right now he could not stand the thought of doing anything else but kiss the gorgeous man in front of him. His lips reached forward to at least catch another peck before realizing how hard his heart was pounding and how desperately his lungs cried out for some air.
After a few initial difficulties to get their conversation going (which Astoria was not the reason for, just to let you know) they were engaged in a vivid chat about how annoying ball season at the Minister was and how much they hated the gross food people there considered fancy. So, no wonder, they did not hear the key turning in the lock nor notice the noises made by someone getting rid of their shoes and coat. Only when a familiar voice from the hall shouted, they stopped talking.
When she told him that, he could hardly imagine ever feeling that way for anyone. There had never been a girl he looked at in that way. Sure, he could enjoy a woman's beauty but that was about it. What she told him next was what really shook him to the ground.
We could stop our little story here and simply leave our two boys in that tiny bar, slowly becoming friends but that somehow would leave some questions open, such as why Draco does have pink hair or why Harry did not mention the ear rings and tunnels so far, let alone the tattoos covering the blond guys body up onto the back of his hands. To get to this part of the story we have to fast forward a bit into the boys regularly meeting until the day Harry gets to meet Astoria and Daphne Greengrass or as Draco prefers to call them ‘The two-headed demon who will once cause my death by liver failure or a heart attack’.
With a smile he turned the card in his hands. Working with Draco, knowing about the real Draco hidden beneath all those glamours, could be the most fun he had had at his job in the last few months.
“You mean Clive? I do not know. Somewhere around. Why, do you want to meet him?
That revelation had hit Harry so hard, he needed to talk to someone and usually this someone was Hermione. Without wasting a thought, he had shown up at her doorstep hoping she would have some encouraging words assuring him he did nothing wrong. But life does not always go as you intend it to. Therefore, neither was Hermione the one greeting him at the front door nor was he meet with reassuring words.
It showed a close up of Draco’s lower torso, clearly emphasizing the defined muscles running down towards his thighs and indeed how loose the towel was hanging around his hips. Harry’s mouth went dry as he imagined what was hidden underneath the soft fabric and how much he wanted to see more. His fingers moved automatically and this time he did not think twice before hitting the ‘send’-button.
Sitting up he tried to remember where he was and why his glasses were missing. Oh right, he went out with the Greengrass sisters and Draco. To that club. He was drinking quite a lot of those fancy pinkish drinks he would have never dared to order by himself as the definitely looked very gay. There was kissing as well. Two blokes in the corner, Astoria. They were dancing. He never danced. Oh, and he was kissing another man. As far as he could remember, he did not hate it. And then there was Draco in his button down with the tight pants. Harry wondered if he could also pull off such a look. Draco with the pink hair. Draco smelling like sandalwood and spices. Draco whom he had drunkenly kissed.
Unmoving they stayed like this for a few more moments, foreheads pressed against each other, panting, most of their bodies still touching, before Draco managed to spit out “you are making this so hard for me” in a very rough voice, arousal swinging in every syllable as well as the tiny breaks in between the words.
Twelve thirty they had agreed on an he was counting any minute, trying his hardest not to stress out. This was just friends meeting up. It was the ministry, what could possibly happen at all?
Harry nodded, still visibly confused and only managed to mumble “you look fine” which was met with something behind Draco’s eyes softening as if he was relieved Harry did not question the reasons behind him coming without any Glamour but approving of it.
One has to know two things about Harry’s choice of profession: First, for him one possibility was as good as the other, he did not really care which one it would become. Second, writing his memoires was certainly none of them. He was nineteen years old when he finished school, going on twenty. There were decades of his life still lying in front of him, why should he start with his memoires when he had just started living.
“I know what you are thinking. And no, Remus was not gay, he was simply in love with Sirius and they both were fine with it. They were gorgeous together and it took Remus ages to get over him. In the end he managed to fall in love with my beloved Nymphodora and I could not have been happier with the partner she chose. You know, Remus has always been dear to me.”
“Wait, how long have you been talking about
He started crying and would not stop until Hermione picked him up which lead to the end of her conversation with Draco as the toddler demanded immediate and total attention. Harry already feared Draco might feel lost now he had nobody to talk to but then another Christmas miracle happened.
“I know, but as long as you two are okay if I joined your little escape party, I will survive it!”
He used to have these dreams a lot after the war. Often, they were very bloody, visually reminding him of the ones he lost. Sometimes he dreamt of searching for people long gone. His parents, his godfather. But waking up meant he would not find them so Harry decided to stay in the state of uncertainty for as long as possible. As long as he was neither asleep nor awake those people were like Schroedinger’s Cat, somehow both dead and alive – but missing – in his dreams.
He brushed his left hand over the tattoo and Harry understood that it was meant as a symbol to show there were ways out of that darkness. Then Draco said something that almost broke him into pieces.
Harry starred at him blankly. What?
He turned around again to face Draco who assured him as soon as they came back everyone would know who Harry’s lunch companion was.
Harry most certainly did not know how to move on from there. He had never been good with words. Actions were his thing but…he had already made his move and now something had to come. Something to diffuse the situation. Something like Draco telling him he liked him. Our favourite Gryffindor had his hopes high for a happy ending to happen there on the spot.
“It’s Draco,” he simply told her, not letting go of her hand. He felt the twitch, the short moment of struggling when the weight of this information reached her brain. He saw so many thoughts running through her head; anger, disbelieve, sadness, wonder, fear, understanding but in the end, it was a soft expression that settled.
After what felt like ages in which he mentally kicked himself for being so insanely stupid, the other man finally reacted once again. Dragging his chair closer to the table and sitting upright Malfoy changed his posture from arrogance into what seemed to be real interest.
Harry grabs his bag and follows them onto the street where the next surprise awaits them.
Even though, they still talked about the sexuality thing from time to time, the matter somehow had lost its urgency for Harry. He still was not sure what his actual preferences were but he was not questioning himself all of the time anymore. Maybe it was because of something Draco had told him.
Draco smirked at her and reached for her cup.
This time Harry nodded and managed to almost look the other man straight into the eyes. Actually, it was more staring at a point between Malfoy’s ears and eyes instead of his actual eyes. He can feel himself blushing, asking himself once again when exactly this had sounded like a good idea and why?
For a long time, Harry Potter just simply accepted he was born to be different and lived with it. He had gotten used to not being able to feel the same emotions as his friends. He grew used to always missing something that did not exist anymore.
I am not willing to speak on behalf of Mister Potter concerning his relationship status with any person on this planet but I would like to kindly remind you of my statement on this manner that I have given your newspaper before: I am not now or ever in the future willing to again date someone who is not out. This does not mean I am implying anything about Harry Potter’s sexuality – this is none of my business! However, my previous experiences with closeted man have taught me that this is not a way I see myself leading anything interpersonal relationship with someone who is not willing to be seen with me in public.
Correctly interpreting his thoughts, the other man looked down at himself with a knowing grin.
“Oh, Harry Potter! It has been ages since I last saw you!”, she exclaimed enthusiastically while grabbing an empty chair behind her. Sitting down, she held out her right hand in order to introduce herself to him.
He ended up launching himself on one of the gigantic couches in the living room, expecting to be on his own for while as the other Weasleys all seemed to be busy with their annual Christmas chores. Again, he was wrong. Charlie seemed to have only been waiting for his chance. He appeared out of nowhere and seated himself on the chair opposite of Harry, looking at him with a sincere expression.
With this he looked Harry straight into the eye which made the other man swallow hard. Once again, he could read so much in them. There was fear of rejection as well a lot of hurt and darkness but also a warm longing, a desire. And then he hid these emotions again, as if Draco did not dare to feel.
It was a dull, rather boring job and he could not have been happier. Finally, he was nothing special anymore. However, from time to time an assignment struck his curiosity and no one would have dared to speak up against him. Maybe the Algherion case nobody at their office wanted to deal with as the family was considered to be ‘difficult’ was actually a blessing for him.
Indeed, the brunette was wearing a blue shimmering top leaving her navel free, combined with a pink tutu and very bright very orange tights. She had even gone a step further and added a red belt which somehow managed to pull the outfit together. Her hair was curled at the ends to make it resemble snakes- with a lot of fantasy of course.
“So, this is how you look without Glamours,” he began, not knowing how to go on. Luckily, she seemed to have regained her confidence, nipping at her tea before grinning at him.
“I think I am not interested in girl, you know, and now I was wondering what guys think is attractive.”
This time Harry turned so quickly that their noses actually bumped which he did not care about. Instead of answering, he leaned in and his lips brushed Draco’s wanting more of that tingling sensation that made his head spin in circles. This time his lips felt electric, as if there was a spark and he tried to get more. More of the softness of the pink-haired man’s lips, more of the smell, more of the sensation of being not only close to a man but beautiful Draco out of all of them. Draco however had other plans. After what had felt like him opening his lips and kissing Harry back, he had quickly withdrawn, currently starring at the ground.
Again, they looked at each other without knowing what to do next. Harry sighted deeply before asking Draco in defeat: “Maybe we should leave and go somewhere else?”
In contrast to her sibling and Draco, her outfit was more casual, a lose fitting, black crop top and some high waits hot pants with dark tights that were just see through enough to let the viewer be certain, her legs were almost covered in tattoos. Needless to say, she was pretty with her rather sharp nose and the two piercings in her lip, one on the outer right corner, one in the centre of the bottom lip.
“No, no, this wasn’t what I meant. Of course, you have changed, I mean, you are not a total git anymore. Since everyone knows…you…you did not turn totally…gay” He whispered the last word, not sure if it was okay to say it out loud which lead to Malfoy responding with a crooked smile and taking another sip from his drink.
His gaze locked upon the chest area and he suddenly very clearly remembered that one awful night during sixth year when they met in the bathroom. The blood, the horror. But nothing of it could be seen as a large tattoo covered up most of Draco’s chest. Again, the colours were held in black and white with only a very small percentage of red in the centre. It was loosely connected to the piece on the right arm but this linework was not as clear, rather smudgy, reminding him of vermin and other crawling creatures, all running together around that red spot, wrapping around it. Protecting it. Or suffocating.
Draco let out a deep sight somewhere in the middle of the movie. Merlin knows what it was about, Harry was way to busy asking himself how to improve the situation as to follow the shallow plot. What he definitely noticed was the moment Draco quietly drew out his phone and started texting. This was not going well at all and he had no clue what to do!
Which left him just with the problem of what to write. A part of him really wished he would be better at this. Another part considered asking his godson Teddy for help. Which was absurd. If a five-year old could do this, why was he hesitating at all? Maybe he was just simply overthinking it once again.
Thank you for coming straight to the point. Indeed, Harry Potter and I have been meeting up regularly over the past months. It was him who after the war generously offered to make peace, something I gladfully accepted.
“I think dear Harry looks just fine exactly as he is,” Draco explained without looking away.
Taking in a deep breath and finally able to see clear again, he took a look around. This was Draco’s living room. He was at the apartment. Someone had brought him here last night. That was a good sign, wasn’t it? Maybe Draco was not mad at him.
Draco turned towards her with an annoyed expression.
How do you deal with the heartbreak?
“Yes, I think so. It is not that we are a thing. He told me we could never be – not when I was not out, not when it meant hiding. And I still don’t know if we can ever be but I think I am – no, I am certain I am in love with him.”
Imagine just having stopped snogging the person you desired the most, uncertain how to move on from there. Thousands of unspoken words in the air, promises, excuses, stupid jokes but none of them leaves your dry mouth as you just look into those grey eyes opposite of you, an open question in them.
It is the growing band between them that seems to become stronger with every day they spend together or missing each other. It is still to early for Harry to give this feeling a name but in the last few days the urge has become stronger and stronger to tell Draco what he feels when they are close. Until now, he has not found the right words to express how much this other man means to him but a voice inside his head tells him it won’t be long until the moment comes where he will want nothing more than to shout it from the rooftop.
Draco could do nothing else but give away something that sounded like a mixture of surprise and a tiny bit of a moan. He had to open his mouth for the sound to escape and Harry used his chance, conquering the unknown territory with his own tongue, exploring the sweet sensation of the other man’s mouth. He was not instantly rewarded with a reaction but he could feel, Draco had shifted his upper body back a bit, now supporting both of them with his elbows on the couch. Trusting his instincts, Harry shifted his bodyweight as well and he could sense Draco below himself.
They had never been somewhere where they stayed the night together. Of course, from time to time – let’s be honest: almost every day! – one of them was sleeping over at the other’s place but this somehow feels a little bit different. And he is looking forward to it.
Harry was so intrigued by the picture that it took him quite a while to respond. Obviously too long for Draco’s taste.
Without stepping a millimetre away, he loosened his grip and looked up into grey eyes and a very reddened face. Draco was painting as well, his hand still resting on Harry’s collar but there was no trace of insecurity left in his gaze. Instead the left side of his mouth twitched upwards into a playful half-smile while he bit down on his lower lip, mumbling to himself “I should listen to Pansy more often” while slowly tracing a line up and down Harry’s upper body with his fingers.
It only took until the early afternoon until the more than flattering letter from the lady of the house arrived. Now Draco would definitely get the job and they could maybe hang out around the office as well. Maybe he would notice there that Harry really cared for him. Our favourite Gryffindor was just about to text the other man about his accomplishment when it arrived.
With surprise he noticed Draco already sitting at a table all by himself without any menu, looking around with a rather critical expression on his face which luckily lit up the second he saw Harry.
Luckily our favourite Gryffindor actually loved dumplings. The taste of the different vegetables mixed with the hot sauce made his mouth tingle. The fact, that Astoria constantly tried to steal from Draco’s plate on the other hand made him giggle quite a lot. The other man defended his food as if it was the most precious thing on earth, climbing onto the cushions and eating while squatting on the couch. Harry wondered to himself, if secretively the Slytherins had always been like that when they were by themselves.
She was everything Harry had expected her to be and so much more. Daphne Greengrass was definitely Astoria’s sister, that one was for sure. Let alone the way she talked and used the same little gestures to show excitement was so much alike her younger sibling there couldn’t be any doubt. However, she was quite different to her bubbly, always high energy sister.
The birthday party was everything Harry had expected it to be. Obviously, he again was totally underdressed. It turned out Astoria’s fashion choice was totally appropriate for the occasion as everyone else looked like walking rainbow flags as well. They were having colourful shots and had conquered the dance floor once again after a rather small amount of time when Harry noticed something different that day. It was not only Draco who got a lot of attention. Of course, he once again looked stunning with a well fitting and obviously expensive pair of grey pants paired with a form fitting shirt, this time with a collar just wide enough to suggest there was more ink in his chest, and a tight black vest over it. Even though having tried to do his very best at preparing himself he still had gotten the faintest sunburn on his cheeks which made him look even more radiant than he already did. If he had not fallen for the other man, he totally would have today, Harry thought to himself.
“Harry, do you really want this? I mean I am the first guy you have ever been with.”
Part of Harry meant this as a joke, part of him actually discussed being angry at Draco for asking other people for advice. But on the other hand, he had run to his friends as well. Gosh, they both really sucked at this. Draco looked at him, still wearing this stupid, adorable, kissable half-smile Harry mentally noted down to never tell him how good it worked on him and started imitating Pansy Parkinson’s voice a tiny bit too well for his taste.
And there he stood, Harry Potter, hero of the Wizarding World, heartthrob of hundreds of young witches and wizards looking maybe the best he had ever done, all by himself while dozens of eyes were watching him, curious of what he was going to say.
Hearing these words Molly turned around and pushed her fist into her sides hard, getting really close to Draco who looked very confused. Even thought he was at least two heads taller than her, his boyfriend seemed to be pretty intimidated by the small woman coming even closer.
“So, this is where Mr. Too-Good-to-Be-on-Time-to-Meet-his-Best-Friend prefers to spent his afternoons, shagging cute boys he didn’t tell her about.”, she snarls at him. It was obvious that she was having a hard time not breaking out into laughter while talking, therefore her face looked quite tense, attempting to stay serious. While Malfoy only let out an annoyed sigh she turned towards Harry and for a moment lost all her cool attitude when she recognised him.
After what felt like an eternity of uncomfortable silence Draco suggested to order and Harry had to explain he had already pre-ordered. Draco’s head tilted slightly to the left when he quietly explained: “I wished you had rather not done that.”
The latter was hiding behind his boyfriend as much as he could without being too obvious about it. Of course, this was another level of family harmony and love he had not been prepared for. Harry had tried his best to warn Draco about sappy Arthur but he wouldn't believe it.
This was his chance to get out of this unbelievable stupid idea! Harry just had to tell Malfoy that of course this was a joke and he just tried to insult the git. Call him a faggot. A Sissi and this was it. But somehow, he did not want to do that either. Under the expectant gaze of the blond man he managed to very slowly nod once and after that quickly shut his eyes.
He wondered if she was going to be as loud and chirpy as her little sister when he heard Draco entering the apartment. The pink-haired man went straight for the kitchen, carrying two stuffed bags full of what seemed to be bottles and still wearing his coat. With a raised eyebrow he nodded at Harry.
“Harry at least gets it”, she explained to her sister while winking at him conspicuously. After hugging him – a mannerism he had taken a while to get used to as way of greeting – she whispered in his ear: “Do you think my little boyfriend would like that?”
“I see no difference to what you did. You basically decided he was not to meet the rest od his family. You did not let him choose either!”
He still thought about that when he touched himself in the shower that evening. Something which he did not have felt the desire to for a long time. Of course, it was the hang over and the sensation of kissing a bloke but his thought tended to include a hint of pink hair.
When Draco got up and went towards Harry to kiss him, he thought to himself that indeed Draco was the perfect boyfriend to bring home for Christmas. All polite and friendly but still the witty, clever man he fell in love with who would try his best to make Harry’s family accept him. And he was eternally grateful to have found someone willing to be part of his world.
“Oh gosh, I am really sorry. See, this happens when I try to do emotional gestures. I ruin your meal.”
Stowing the signed document back into his pockets, the blond man once again looked at Harry and started another attempt for a conversation.
Draco was not wearing his expensive cashmere pullover anymore. The luxurious blue piece of clothing was currently in the kitchen sink where Molly carefully tried to get rid of a dark red stain whilst Draco kept on telling her it was no big deal.
Curiously whom might have a reason and the guts to send him something like this, Harry carefully reached for the red parchment. This alone was enough for the magic to be triggered. Quickly, the letter folded itself into a face-like structure, interestingly enough resembling a snake kind of and a very distinctive voice started shouting at him.
The piercing in the bottom lip was located rather on the outer half and currently the tattooed man was chewing on it, clearly expecting some sort of reaction. ‘His hair colour makes his grey eyes stand out more’, Harry thought to himself while still staring at the other guy. Somehow the lack of controlled style suited Draco more than the slick back hair our beloved Gryffindor was used to. The messy bun managed to soften the sharp and pointy features a bit, giving the former Slytherin more of an edgy but approachable vibe.
In order to understand what genius Draco did that day we have to get next to Harry right at the breakfast table where an issue of “Witch Weekly” seemed to appear out of nowhere, attached to it a little post-it.
With a tired smile Harry got up to go to the kitchen sink and gulp a glass of water. He definitely was lost.
“Harry and I were just about to say goodbye before you interrupted us with matters that clearly could have waited,” Draco told Astoria in a voice that should sound annoyed but actually carried an amused tone. His eyes were focused on our favourite Gryffindor and Harry had to admit that the spark of mischief that lit them actually suited the blond man very well. It made his grey eyes just a notch warmer and felt like they were sharing a secret, not even Draco’s best friends knew about.
“You were right, the boy needs every bit of family he can get. And so does my sister. I cannot believe what I’m about to say but thank you for forcing me into that. Maybe it was time to let the past finally become the past.”
“Fancied?”
When he woke up again the afternoon most certainly had turned into early evening. Daphne was having her second serving of cheese pizza and Astoria was vast asleep.  Draco was the only one halfway paying attention to the telly where some heavily tattooed teenagers obviously were hunting monsters while suffering under substantial and love crises. Interesting choice. He carefully stretched a bit and shrugged the blanket from his feet, ready to get up. Draco turned to him and rose an eyebrow. “Everything ok?”
“Would you mind telling me why you are thinking about Pansy right now of all times?”
“I don’t get it,” Daphne shrugged, “there were times Draco would have dragged this cute guy out of the club and snogged him senseless half an hour ago. But since we came back to London, I never saw him taking anyone home and that one,” She pointed at the man with her pint, “is definitely his type. The hell, he even let Astoria move in permanently. Not even I would do that and she is my bloody sister!”
Harry looks surprised for a second but then quickly follows Draco inside who refuses to tell him where they are going, only hinting that they will be gone the whole weekend. He nervously packs the sweater which is still most presentable together with way too much clean underwear and a ton of new shirts he has recently bought to impress Draco.
With the knowledge that this whole crush thing was not one-sided at all, Harry found his famous Gryffindor courage and decided it was high time to do something which would show Draco he indeed had intentions towards getting closer. Luckily for him, modern technology makes it way easier to get in contact with your special someone and now finally he had his number.
Draco, who was loud and colourful and out and extravagant and seeking attention and everything Harry had avoided to be. Draco, who tried his best to make Harry feel welcome, who had changed so much over the years, who held a confidence Harry was envious about deep down. Draco, who flirted with him all the time, who told him to ask before he kissed him again. Draco, who did not tell Harry off for kissing him. Draco, who had been through the same war as he, who had also survived and searched for a new identity. Draco, who had become a close friend and who always joked around with him but never made clear if he could even imagine being more than friends.
It has become sort of a Christmas tradition that Arthur Weasley drinks one too many after dinner. It all had started very innocently when he had decided to raise his glass for every member of his family. Unfortunately for his alcohol consumption his family had steadily grown from very to year. And when I mean every member this of course includes spouses as well. Whoever is at the Burrow on Christmas Eve is a member of the Weasley family.
Harry realized how empty his kitchen had always been. For a long time, he was really glad to finally have a place on his own, a house where he could live by himself without anyone telling him off or sending him into his room. He had always liked the quiet. But now he started realizing there was something missing. Someone. Maybe it was because Draco acted so naturally, maybe it was because the image indeed was just perfectly right and Draco was meant to be in his kitchen, now inspecting what was cooking inside the oven.
He ended up buying way too much (maybe because he had taken Teddy alongside) and did not know how to proceed from there. Should he send a giant basket with all the nippit in it or was sending daily tiny things better? Was this whole present-thing a sarcastic joke from Draco he didn’t get? This whole flirting thing was way too confusing for his brain. With Ginny he just simply bought what she wished for and gave it to her. Most of the time she even got him directions to where to buy what exactly. Anyhow, his feelings for Ginny had been very different, he had realized by now.
Draco, who had a lot of experience. In bed. With men. Probably a lot of them.
Waking up without your glasses in a different place than your own home is a strange experience, even if you are used to it. It is even worse when you are hung over. You are confused as where exactly you are, how you got there and what actually has happened. Your mouth feels kind of gross, your head hurts, the lights are too bright and everything smells wrong. If you now imagine how scary this would be if it was your first time ever waking up at someone else’s place after having one drink to many you can imagine how frightened Harry felt the day after.
Another shake of his head was the only answer Harry was able to produce.
Then and only then would it be reasonable to even waste some time questioning himself if Draco might be interested and why.
She smiled and removed her hand from his head, placing it under her chin, waiting for him to continue. When he did not, she simply asked: “There is a special someone, right?” and Harry nodded.
Harry managed to nod and simply replied: “Yeah, but I think I should better head home.”
To make a point, the pink haired grabbed Harry’s waist and pulled him close enough so he could smell the scent of herbs and something sweet once again. Draco’s smell. Until that very moment Harry had not noticed how much he had missed this distinctive little feature, how he desperately had to get more of this smell, of how the perfume fused with the other man’s very own smell into a fragrance that went from his nose straight to his groin. Unconsciously he had been moving closer, almost nuzzling his head into Draco’s neck. This made the latter turn his head and look at him.
we are only a few chapters away from the ending, time to finally get Harry going! You go boy, fight for your Draco!
When he looked up from the small card in his hands, he noticed that Malfoy had entered the pub, starring at him from a distance as if he had been waiting for Harry to notice him first before getting any closer. He was wearing a mixture of black robes and a suit, emphasizing his slender frame and very fashionable this season. The long hair was held back by the elegant and simply hairband. The actual robes part of his outfit was carefully draped over his left arm. The grey vest nicely contrasted with the darker trousers and the black shirt. He looked flawless as always. The tiny half smile returned to the blond man’s face when he finally caught Harry’s eyes. Slowly he came closer to the table, his own drink already in one hand, and sat down.
Rubbing his eyes, he shook his head. What the hell was he thinking. Did the conclusion that he might be having a crush on Draco really have to result in him questioning everything about his body? He breathed out loudly. There was only one person clear enough in their mind to help him stop overthinking.
“Why are you telling me this?” Harry quietly asked, letting his gaze trail from Draco’s arm towards the sky. Draco chuckled audible and ran a finger through his hair in disbelieve.
“Well, you remember the stupid article about you being undatable and how you told me you could never be with someone in the closet? I thought to myself I had to do something spectacular – Malfoy style - to show you I am not afraid of other people’s opinions so that you would go out with me and date me!”
I am almost proud of the collection of angry letters calling me the worst of names. Not only from girlfriend but also mothers, close family friends and even concerned siblings. This might be the reason I decided to stop dating at all.
“Love, don’t treat yourself too harsh. Charlie could not talk to me about it for a year because he was so scared, I would refuse him. I don’t want any member of my family to ever feel like they could not tell me something so important, ever again.”
If Astoria Greengrass is famous for one thing then it is her more than impressive ability to be just in time. Exactly 15 minutes later there was a knock on the front door.
“Do you like it?”
“The only one not feeling alive is you, Mr. Potter, I sadly have to admit. These days I see you walking through the halls like a ghost burdened with unfinished business,” she told him in her sincere voice and Harry’s reaction proved her right. He just looked her in the eyes, a tiredness in his own which did not suit a boy of only eighteen years. He looked at her with the expression of someone who had lived a life and now was ready to step back and let the next generation take over.
“Well Potter,” he slowly and very quietly said, “if you really want to talk about this subject, we should meet at a less public place.” Out of the inner pocket of his jacket he pulled a business card and a pen that could only be described as decadent. Dark mahogany wood together with what looked like actual marble held a thin fountain-pen nib made out of platinum. The ink of course had a deep green colour. He took his very time to note down an address. Harry immediately noticed that the capital letters were written obnoxiously large and contained more than one unnecessary extra swirl.
There was so much asking and carefulness in everything Draco said, that Harry managed to forget how badly he wanted that body and felt nothing more than an intense, warm and happy feeling in his entire body. Yes, he was definitely certain, he wanted this. As slow as they managed to go. This feeling taking over his body when looking at the other man reassured him that he really cared and he really wanted to be with Draco, as in every second they spent together he was falling more for this pretty, extravagant, confident, shy, sexy, innocent, beautiful, strong man.
About an hour into the drive Draco decides it is his turn and they completely switch places. Harry is in the passenger seat now. Somehow Draco insisted and from time to time our favourite Gryffindor feels the soft touch of a hand on his upper thigh. He likes is quite much when Draco is in the mood for such gestures. Most of the time it happens when he thinks nobody can see him. Not because he is ashamed of their relationship, he has reassured Harry a thousand times. It is rather because he was raised to not show his emotions in public.
“But I always tell other people how proud I am of my friends!” he insisted which was met by a knowing smile.
“Well,” she started, touching his hair with a confused expression, “I was having some difficulties renewing my Glamour, so I was wondering if you would be so kind as to do me the favour of helping me, Prince Draco.” Harry wondered if it was normal to be able to hear eyes rolling instead of even seeing them, because he clearly just now had. Also, the girl had mentioned Glamours, what was that supposed to mean?
And here they were now, actually celebrating Christmas together like a happy little family. He was almost freaking out. Until Draco had arrived at his front door an hour ago Harry still had been convinced, he would not turn up after all. But he did and he was really, really nervous, double checking if his clothes were alright, if his hair looked decent combed back to give the impression of a well-behaved son in law. He had even covered up all of his tattoos, explaining to Harry that his pink hair was already extravagant enough to deal with for a first introduction. For Draco this seemed to be a great deal. He wanted to be liked by the Weasley. He even got them presents.
“Well, it has been quite a journey,” Draco started what already sounded like a rather longish lecture once again. He actually still loved to talk about himself Harry noted in the back of his mind. “The first step was to try something different, something definitely not me.”
After needing several moments to find the right words, Draco attempted a crooked smile and managed to say: “Well, maybe I have changed a bit more than you had expected?”
Therefore, he did the only logical thing. He did nothing.
And then she was gone, only the sweet scent of her hair lingering around for a few more moments and in the end, it was him crying. Maybe he had needed to tell her to find closure, too -  to start something new.
“I used to work here from time to time. Helped with the recipes for the cocktails. You know, great potions student makes a great barkeeper, that’s for sure!”
Harry clenched his shoulders together just for a moment before deciding to not even try and deny what was so obvious to her. Instead he ruffled through his hair and grinned at her sheepishly, looking at her over his glasses.
At this time his words were already a bit slurry and he had started hugging his family members a bit too long but Arthur continued telling Ginny how proud he was of her deciding to become a professional Quidditch player before he turned to Harry.
With a light heart Harry left this conversation, reassured on what he was planning on doing the next day. An entrance worthy and dramatic enough to convince Draco Malfoy himself, he, Harry Potter, was not hiding anymore.
This was harder than he imagined. He had been searching for words for a good five minutes before finally being pleased with his message. Former drafts had included quite a few phrases that could easily be interpreted as being rude such as “you were only annoying at the beginning which freaked me out a bit. But I like that you always make fun of Draco” or “I thought that you were quite impolite at the beginning so Draco was right” or “Isn’t it terribly thoughtless to call your best friend a git?” So, you see, the message he settled with was the tamest he could come up with.
“Obviously, I could not stick to that colour,” the explanation went on. The next Draco still looked stressed out but he already had the first earrings. His hair was shorter but had a deep petrol colour. He was again very pale, however. The next one had him feature dark blue hair, then lighter, then soft green, purple and finally pink. With every picture the number of piercings and tattoos grew the same way the black circles under his eyes got lighter. Harry noticed that only the first two pictures had featured Draco by himself in the black clothes he had been wearing during their last school years. After that his wardrobe had become less formal and brighter. Astoria was in many of the latter ones as well as Pansy Parkinson, stylish as ever, and another girl around the same age which had bleach blonde hair in most of the pictures and bore a distinctive similarity to Astoria.
Draco’s eyebrows once again twitched and Harry was almost sure the other man pondered whether it would be better to waste only half of the food and watch Harry eat (which he obviously would not be capable of. Harry knew, he was a rather messy eater, this was why he chose steaks in first place. They kind of were always a messy thing to eat. Both of them being occupied with how to cut their meat would have maybe led to Draco not noticing how clumsy Harry was. Now he would be watched.) or actually leaving.
Starring at himself in the mirror blankly he wondered if Draco was a morning person. He tried to remember their time back in Hogwarts when breakfast was spent glaring at each other from across the Great Hall. He could not even remember if Malfoy took tea or coffee. An amused smirk hushed over his face. How strange that he was thinking about their breakfast habits back then. As if he would have ever paid attention to such a detail back then. Now he would love to know. Maybe because this would imply Draco had stayed the night.
“I know it is kind of corny and melodramatic but after all of what happened when we were only children I felt the need to get a protective layer over my-“ he stopped for a moment, pointing at his chest whereabout his heart was, unable to say the word. “This one is the only magical tattoo I have. Normally I keep it under glamour in order not to freak people out but actually it is some sort of therapeutic thing. Pansy often told me I would swallow my feelings and never tell anyone about how I actually was, hiding any weakness from myself. And I did not want to be this coward person anymore therefore I got this one” – he pointed at the insect-like heart once again – “to confront myself with how I was.”
The blond man sitting opposite of him burst out in laughter. He put down his drink to instead touch his forehead with three fingers while placing his elbow on the table. Eyes closed he could do nothing else than to keep on laughing. A tiny dimple appeared on his left cheek. It stayed there even after the laughter had settled for a deep smile whose mischievous aftermath even reached the storm grey eyes which starred at Harry from between his fingers.
"I really wish you will someday find someone you really can desire. Someone whose touch makes your knees weak. Someone you want to be with every second."
All the other customers he had seen while waiting for Draco (whom had explained to him that being on time was so not Malfoy style) were around his age and dressed way more fashionable than he would ever be able to. He himself stood out with his comfortable clothes which fulfilled no other purpose than to cover his body, as well as the blond man, who always seemed to wear formal clothing, be it a button down and dress pants or even a whole suit. Harry guessed that this was because they always met directly after work. He could not imagine that even Malfoy would find this type of fashion comfortable in his leisure time.
“My eyes do not get dreamy! And you make it sound as if I was in love with him! This might just be a phase! I mean, he is the first gay guy I really spent time with.
“Haha, you are right. By the way how did you get here?”
Harry Potter had been growing up fulfilling expectations. For the Dursleys he had been a varmint. A boy who did not know his place and therefore he behaved as such. For his classmates he had been the Golden Boy who did not have to follow the same rules as them, so he did not. For his housemates he was their mischievous idol, so he let them idolize him. For the Slytherins he was the untouchable enemy, so he let none of them close and dehumanized them. For Dumbledore he was a stupid child, who had to be led onto the righteous path, so he let himself be controlled. For Sirius he had been a lost chance, so he accepted to give him hope. During the war he served many as a beacon of light and he let the flame burn him down. His purpose ended with the death of Voldemort.
“Or do you have any other plans for tonight, master cook?”, Draco playfully asked. As soon as Harry shook his head, the pink haired man turned on his heels into the living room, four platters in his hands and explaining that they had to hurry up a bit as Daphne should be arriving is about an hour and he for sure had to get dressed up a bit to celebrate the occasion.
It needed Professor McGonagall’s insight to make him realize staying at Hogwarts would be nothing more than him trying to escape the burden of growing out of your destiny, overcoming every expectation and having to face a life in which he was responsible for only himself and nothing more.
She stopped at their table, her arms crossed in front of her chest and starred at Malfoy expectantly, completely ignoring Harry. He still wondered if he had seen her before. Something seemed to be familiar about her.
Maybe he should start a notch smaller and use his name for something he really cared about. Like re-establishing another man’s reputation. A grin with a hint of mischief stole itself on his face while he lighted the fire in his chimney and firecalled a good old friend to ask for a favour.
They settled on the couch in the living room and desperately looked at anything else but each other. The tension in the air had almost become unbearable when Harry finally managed to start a conversation.
That look between pity and actually feeling sorry for him told Harry that Draco really tried hard to make this work, too, but somehow this evening seemed to be cursed or something like that.
Three months and 17 days and still Draco Malfoy out of all people seemed to be his only chance. Not only because Harry could be absolutely sure, the blonde aristocrat would never address the matter in a conversation with the Weasley family (as if Malfoy would even talk to them!) but also because he never made a deal out of his sexual preferences.
“Yeah, I mean, I would prefer to not wear them at all but could you imagine the gossip? ‘Astoria Greengrass turning into a muggle hipster’ What is happening to the traditional wizarding families’. Oh dear, it would break my mother’s heart if once again the wizarding world would viciously gossip about me.”
It was crowded with books, all of them neatly arranged next to children’s toys made by hand. The whole furniture was comfortable and old, yet well put together. On the table books about raising children, the history of potions brewing in Europe and magazines on Quidditch results could be found and the soft humming of Ron from the kitchen was clearly audible. Everything logical Hermione brought into their relationship was cherished with a lovely gesture from Ron. There were tons of pictures of the happy couple together with tiny gifts his best friend had given to his wife over the years as well as snippets of every newspaper article featuring her, carelessly pinned to the wall by a more than proud husband.
When Draco Malfoy came out he did it with style. Of course, a simple announcement or an interview would not do. He instead reacted to the various rumours in a way only he could. It was a feast for the media.
“Are we not?”
Two days later, this voice had become very silent and had been replaced by a rather hysteric train of thought that constantly told Harry to leave as soon as possible before Malfoy arrived and had the chance to embarrass the Golden Boy by unleashing the press onto him like a pack of wild bloodhounds. The blond git would definitely try to humiliate him. He would stage this meeting as some sort of date where he could act as the suffering victim who had been stalked by the mad Potter, a lovesick maniac. Maybe Malfoy would not even show up. Maybe he would just send a callboy. A stripper. Someone who would make Harry feel utterly ashamed while the former Slytherin Prince could get a fair share of laughs from his Potter-stinks-fan-club.
Harry was certain, Teddy had not stopped to breath once while telling him all of this. He wanted to start a reply when the little boy turned to someone obviously sitting to his right and said “I am done, I’ll brush my teeth now Granny” and went out of the frame.
With an excusing smile Draco got up from his chair and said his goodbye to Harry, explaining that he actually had to leave, which – and while he was telling the next part he was viciously staring at Astoria – had nothing to do with the interruption caused by his annoying roommate. It was Harry’s time to pay so he did not feel in a hurry to get up at all. He could as well stay a moment longer and finish whatever this shake Draco had insisted, he had to try, was.
Her happiness was contagious, Harry thought, as he smiled with her.
Hiya!
The next morning came, and Harry was a mess of anxious energy. Today was different to the other mornings he had waited around for Mr. Malfoy, because this time, it wasn’t the court case he was worried about. It was Malfoy. The thought that yesterday was a fluke was rushing through Harry’s mind. Just because he and Malfoy had gotten on once didn’t mean it would become a regular thing. Right?
Harry watched as the other boy stayed frozen at the door. His back was still turned to Harry and he made no movement except for the rise and fall of his chest.
Harry groaned.
Then, he began striding down the hallway once again, leaving Sirius, once again, emotionally drained from such a wild conversation.
“Yes, Black. I’m sure even you know what that means.”
“You’re still going to be my friends, Draco. I don’t just forget when people help me, and you have been the only thing keeping me sane this summer.”
Harry blushed as she let go of him. He could feel Sirius waiting to tease him as they left the store, a sly smirk across his face.
“How do you know that?”
“It was mentioned in our last chat,” Remus confessed, his voice still calm, soothing. “I promise it wasn’t a conversation about you though, Harry. It merely came up that you were both having trouble sleeping.”
“Shut up,” Harry said without any heat. “Luna already told me that. I gotta go home and talk to him about it, anyway. I said some pretty shitty stuff last night.”
Remus stared at him. His hand no longer twitched, and a stillness overcome him.
“Oh, that was one time! Every other time, I have fought you myself.”
The answer was sharp. It practically screamed ‘Drop it!’.
Harry went to sleep thinking about the other boy’s laughter, unsure what the uneasy feeling building inside him meant.
Sirius had bought the small apartment for Harry and him a few months back. It had been a year since he had been acquitted of the crimes he had been sent to prison for, and he was finally able to unlock his bank accounts to buy the home. He wasted no time moving in, and it was only a few weeks after buying the home that Harry moved in with him.
“No, I just meant I didn’t expect you to get it for me. I had money,” Draco looked ready to snap at him again. “But thank you for getting it for me. I don’t think I’ve ever actually had popcorn from the cinemas. It always smells so nice though.”
“Well, obviously Potter. What did you expect?”
“I guess we will have to wait and see.”
“Moony?”
“So, it is bad! You would have told them if it wasn’t,” Malfoy looked delighted. “How far off prison are you? Oh, how many years are you going away for?”
Harry picked at the sandwich Sirius had made for him, unwrapped it again, noted it was plain peanut butter, and felt pain stab at his stomach. He didn’t take a bite.
“Yeah, have fun! My wallet is on the cupboard by the door. Take however much money you need.”
“Whatever do you mean, cousin?” Mrs. Malfoy smirked, glancing sideways at Sirius. “Now Harry, Draco is in his room if you would like to head up. Sirius and Mr. Lupin will be joining Lucius and I in the parlour before dinner.”
“Why wouldn’t we?” Harry scrunched his eyebrows.
“Mr. Potter,” she called to Harry before he was about to slip from the room. “I understand it is the first day back in session, but please try to focus in my next class. I will not be as lenient as I was today.”
And Draco meant it. He stayed quite as he watched Potter think over what he said.
“You tried to bake something? I don’t think I would have ever imagined you in a kitchen, Malfoy.”
“Guess that’s what we are watching then,” Draco sighed. “I’ll go buy the tickets.”
Harry took a deep breath. His hands clenched at his sides.
“He is my best friend, Draco.”
“Alright then, we can talk about something else. But this isn’t a conversation you can keep putting off.”
He slurped his coffee as he moved to sit across from Harry at the small wooden table.
“Listen to me Harry. That is never going to happen. I love you and I love Snuffles, and I am never letting either of you go, alright. I promise you.”
“We are not about to go back to the way things were! The fighting and bitching, I’m sick of it. Why are you trying to fight me right now?”
“Come and stay with us. Mum won’t care, hell she would have taken you in ages ago if you had let her.”
Sirius looked stricken and close to tears, but Harry kept eye contact with Mr. Malfoy. The man stared back with a blank expression. Eventually, he lifted his chin and gave one short
“Get over yourself, Potter,” Malfoy said, looking offended. “I was merely being polite. Not everything I say is intended to piss you off. You’re just sensitive.”
An old lady with a fur coat had strutted in, walking up to the receptionist with a rather demanding presence. She started yelling at the poor lady behind the desk the moment she reached it. Harry couldn’t make out the words, but he watched the woman behind the desk floundering for the phone. After her, a man with a large round belly and a handlebar moustache bounced in, his booming footsteps enough to shake the floor. He stopped to talk to a man heading out, his jovial laugh echoing throughout the first floor.
“I still have no idea how I passed last year’s Ancient Location project,” Harry said.
“I didn’t say anything!” Harry yelped.
Without waiting for confirmation, Mr. Malfoy walked to the front door and let himself out.
Neville jerked his head up, eyes bulging out of his head, until he focused on Harry.
They walked down the corridor into a small room lined with metal fences. Inside the fences, blocked off from each other’s cages, were several dogs of varying sizes. The majority looked to be a mixture of breeds with no definite features of only one type of dog.
The drive would be a rather quick one, which Harry could easily have walked, but still it was nice to recline and be driven home by someone. Harry stared out the window, watching the landscape pass by, noticing a few students walking into town from Hogwarts.
“Just tell me whatever you want to say, Harry. I want to know what you’re thinking.”
“I think it best we call it a day, Black.”
Draco scowled as he looked up at Potter. He was ready to snap off some quick-witted remark about Potter’s lack of parents when he saw how the other boy looked. Sitting slumped against such a large tree accentuated how small Potter was. The bags under his eyes were deep and he looked like he hadn’t slept in months. Dirt covered his clothes and scratch marks marred the boy’s arms and face, likely caused when he ran off blindly into the forest.
Harry was bright fucking red, is what he was.
“What, and you believed him? My father only cares about himself and his family. Don’t delude yourself Potter, he doesn’t care if he wins your case.”
Harry frowned.
She hummed.
“That’s good! And how has Sirius been? Not spoiling you too badly, I hope.”
“I visited you,” the words were barely above a whisper. Remus sniffed.
Sirius mulled over Lucius’s words, thinking about the interactions he had with Draco. Then he realised what the other man was implying. He barked out a laugh.
“He probably told you some awful things about people like me.”
“Would you like to talk about it?”
“Potter?”
“Don’t worry about it, Potter.”
All the lights in the house were off. The only thing lighting the room was the faint glow of the television. Gently closing the door, Harry crept through the hallway, intent to head straight to his room. However, when he got to the base of the staircase, his creep was interrupted by a long, breathy moan coming from the living room.
The woman looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Because I still love you,” he finally looked to Remus, staring into his amber eyes. “Because I still want you in my life. Because I wake up every morning wishing you were there next to me.”
Harry shuffled to the edge of the bed, placing his feet on the floor. He watched as Malfoy finished putting one shoe on and started on the other.
Fleur’s gaze fell on Harry and she gave him a kind smile. He shot back what was meant to be a smile but better resembled a grimace.
She reached her hand out and Sirius shook it. Her nails were painted red.
“Actually, speaking of the Malfoy’s,” Sirius segued the topic. “They have invited us over to dinner Friday night.”
Sure enough, in the window was Sirius, waving frantically, smirking at them. Harry couldn’t help snort at the sight. Taking a deep breath, Harry nodded, bidding goodbye to Moony before exiting the car. The door creaked as it shut, the metallic ring sounding through the air.
“Goodnight Harry. I am sorry about-” Lupin gestured around them. “Good luck tomorrow.”
To the side, Draco heard the rustle of leaves. It sounded like a large creature scuffling along the forest floor and Draco let out a small ‘eep’ as he jumped violently, dropping the rope attaching him to Potter’s dog. Snuffles took that opportunity to sprint in the direction of the noise, leaving Draco behind to the dangers of the imposing forest. Draco couldn’t do more than watch as the beast galloped into the forest out of his view.
“Five, actually.”
“Is he ok? Is there something wrong him?” Harry asked, glancing away from the dog to Fleur.
“You’re not crazy, Harry,” his eyes narrowed in on Harry, near pleading for the boy to believe him.
Sirius looked over to Melissa.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, startled.
“Right,” Ginny’s frown deepened. “Well, I just wanted to come over to let you know you can come and sit with me and my friends if you like, Harry.”
“Its fine, Ron. It’s not that bad.”
“So… how long have you two been dating?”
“What were you thinking of doing?” Draco asked.
Harry scrunched his eyebrows.
“I didn’t say that you were.”
“James is Harry’s father! I can’t just take that away from him. And adoption… it’s just… I can’t!”
“Black.”
“I have provided the relevant documents providing information regarding Mr. Black’s mental health assessment. He has been cleared by no less than two therapists,” Mr. Malfoy glanced back at Sirius. “I will argue, he should no longer be punished for a crime he has been acquitted of, Your Honour.”
“That isn’t the only option available to us, but there are many things you need to be considering. My recommendation, it that you decide your next move quickly before the Dursleys wise up and get a lawyer.”
Harry nodded into his godfather’s chest. He took a few deep breaths and settled himself.
“Um, we met this summer and she was really nice to talk to so I figured I would just sit with her. Kind of weird that she is Malfoys cousin, hey?”
Sirius frowned.
Harry chuckled. Sirius wiped his wet hands along Harry’s face, causing him to yelp.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Chill Sirius,” Harry muttered. “It’s fine.”
From,
Hi Guys!
“Thank you,” the words were quiet, but they held deep emotion in them.
“Oh, like Ginny Weasley.”
“Very well,” Mr. Malfoy sighed. “Mr. Potter, this meeting will not require your presence. Draco, you won’t need to be here either. I suggest you both find something to do while Black and I sort things out.”
When the song fizzled out, Harry stopped his movements awkwardly, still smiling a smile that shone through his eyes. Sirius heaved in exaggerated breaths. He held his hands on his hips.
“Black.”
Sirius closed his eyes.
When they got to the crowd, they hung together for a few seconds. Usually, they would all convene near the fence, standing there for the last few moments of the school day before heading off to their separate buses. Today, however, Hermione was being picked up by her parents and Ron was under strict instructions not to miss his bus, which had happened more than a few times when he had chosen to stay behind and hang with Harry, who preferred to wait for the late bus.
Harry stood still, his heart beating loudly in his ears. Then a bubble of relieved laughter escaped his chest. He couldn’t stop the smile spreading across his face as he shook his head. His eyes felt damp, and for reasons he couldn’t understand, he felt like crying.
“We just wished you had of told us, mate,” Ron picked at the hole ripped in the knees of his pants. They had gathered at the Weasleys for the reunion, sitting under the shade of an old oak tree.
“That’s probably the car Lucius sent.”
“No thank you, Luna,” Draco said. “Father will be sending someone for us.”
“I don’t mind doing the housework. Besides, Ron and Hermione are both away.”
They both tried to speak, stopping for the other.
“Do you not want me to?”
I really hope you don’t hate me for not telling you. I didn’t want to ruin your holiday, which I know is a shit excuse but it’s true. I’m so sorry for making you worry.
“I may have found a lawyer, actually,” he smiled as he said it, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“What about the Weaslette?” He snorted. “God, I will never forget second year, when she sent you that valentine…”
It drew a laugh out of Potter, a short huff that turned into deep laughter. Seeing Potter throw his head back, eyes closed caused Draco to smile. The situation felt so surreal there wasn’t much more Draco could to than join in laughing.
Harry told him all about school, his best friends Hermione and Ron and all the adventure they had. He told Sirius about the time he and Ron had skipped school to visit Hermione when she had been sick in hospital when they were 12. Harry talked about everything, except the Dursleys.
Harry nodded, his stomach doing flips despite the car being stopped. He was unsure why the man’s words were making him nervous. There was something in the way that he was checking in with Harry, making sure he was comfortable with Sirius and his relationship that was so strange yet so reassuring at the same time. Never had the Dursleys thought to check if he was comfortable. Not even when he was a child, sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs in the middle of winter with only a thin blanket. He had merely been expected to adapt. Which he did. Now though, he had a say in what happened in his own home.
“What about that one?” Draco pointed to a poster of a man holding a bunch of balloons. Harry couldn’t read the title.
“You have a meeting.”
Harry noticed he had stopped halfway down the stairs, head quirked as he inspected the other boy. Shaking his head, he shot Mr. Malfoy a small smile and made his way to the bottom of the stairs. Harry noticed there was something different about Malfoy today. Rather than wearing what Harry had dubbed his miniature lawyer clothes, the other boy was dressed in a pair of black jeans and a dark green shirt. The shirt was well fitted, and accentuated any muscles on Malfoy’s biceps. It made Harry conscious of his own wardrobe, a pair of baggy blue jeans and oversized white shirt.
“What crawled up your ass today?” Malfoy sniped.
“Father’s waiting, Black.”
“What is wrong with you?”
The day had turned grey, the clouds overhead blocking the sunlight from reaching the earth. Their driver finally pulled to a stop. Harry peaked out the tinted windows to see a large white building, and a white concrete staircase leading to the wide doors. It was only when Sirius nudged his shoulder, that Harry realised he had stopped breathing.
“Oh, Harry,” Sirius stood up. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were back.”
Walking down the hallway, Sirius couldn’t deny the unrelenting relief clawing its way through his chest, but there was worry building in him too. He hadn’t let himself think about a life with Harry without any threat of the Dursleys. Now, he was responsible for Lily and James’s son. Fuck, he thought. He knew, without a shadow of a doubt, he would never be enough. He could never care for Harry as well as he knew Lily and James would have.
“Really?” Ginny asked, her expression turning to disbelief.
“I, um,” Sirius turned to face him, looked away, looked back, and then settled on the present sitting on the table. “I got you a birthday present.”
“Mr. Potter attends school with my boy, Draco. I believe they are in the same year.”
“I don’t know,” Sirius scratched his forehead. “I got so caught up in seeing Harry and then officially getting custody of him. I just kept thinking next week I’ll call Moony, and then that week came and I though next week for sure and… I just couldn’t make that call Remus.”
Harry’s felt his face heat up at his godfathers’ comment. Remus chuckled his low, gentle laugh.
“I think your house is haunted.”
“Um, hello. This is Harry. Uh, Harry Potter. I was wondering if Draco was there?”
“Oh.”
“I’ll be back. I’m going to take him to the park we crossed a few streets back.”
“I guess, I just didn’t know you were like that,” the words were whispered.
Sirius was panting by the end of the tirade. His throat was sore from his hoarse shouts and he was unable to control the shaking of his hands. He closed his eyes and disappointment washed over him. He was upset with the situation, and with Malfoy, but mostly himself and his outburst. He wanted to punch Malfoy and keep screaming at him.
