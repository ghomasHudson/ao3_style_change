Remus then gave them his certificate from Gringotts to be analysed. He trust them. They apparently good people. He tried to be rational and stay positive. He didn't want to face the same mistakes like in the past. He wanted to change to be a better person. For him, for Harry and for everyone.
Severus was frozen by the fact that his late husband was burned alive. He remembered they're being held as hostages and somehow Dark Lord rescued him and he never looked at James after that. He didn't remember James and Harry at all. He spent his life at Malfoy Manor and Hogwarts. He almost never stepped on his childhood place. Maybe Dark Lord knew the real truth. Dark Lord knew many things he didn't know. His adoptive father told him that he would be risen again and he did but they killed him again as for his suggestion. His adoptive father asked to be killed by his son and they did that and the war finally over like really over.
"Anyway, I have to go back to ministry. I need to help Kingsley with something and it needs much energy. Tell Sev and Remus my leaving and please do watch them for me. I can smell mating trait from them."
"Uhm I think never. But I don't know if I do that in my dreams." He almost shrank in his seat. This was too embarrassing.
"Because Hogwarts has too many ears and eyes. We don't want someone eavesdropping us. Haven't you noticed that in Headmistress office, there are our late headmasters and headmistress painting all over the walls. But there's no Dumbledore's painting. We had the frame but not the picture. It always been an empty canvas. We guessed he didn't perish or he already died but have his painting somewhere else. So we take precautions and never talk about important matter in there. My chamber was protected by Salazar itself cause it's his office back then and my spells creation make the protection doubled." Explained Severus.
"I am sorry for your pain Harry. I should gave you the higher doses. I am sorry you had to through that situation. " He said while caressing Harry's knuckles.
Harry. Was that the reason he's with Malfoy? Did Harry trust Malfoy that much? Could Malfoy be trusted? Could the invitation from Malfoy means he's a good wizard and knew the truth? Could it be that Harry and the young Malfoy together? Maybe. Maybe he should go there tomorrow. Maybe he could trust them. Maybe he could have the answer and maybe he could have revenge. Maybe he could make them paid what they've done to his true family. Maybe. He just need to wait until he met Malfoys and maybe they could helped him. Maybe.
"Maybe we could tell the truth to only McGonagall and Kingsley. I need to tell them the real reason so I can take legal action on Phoenix Order. The public will have fabricated story. How about that?" Lucius added.
"Let's tell our parents. We need to tell them about Remus. I want all of us will be here tomorrow. " mumbled Harry. He's still high but didn't want to continue. He needed to control himself. It's not the time to enjoy the pleasure. They had more important matters.
Harry thought Draco was hiding something from him. He tried to talk about this matter to Severus but his mother declined his idea. Narcissa was the same. She told him that Draco was tired and his job needed him a full concentration. Narcissa suggested Harry to take Draco on date. This was one reason they went to Diagon Alley just the two of them. Apart from school supplies, they would go shopping a few muggle formal attire, a more than few formal wizard robes, a full wardrobe with both combinations of muggle and wizard casual clothes. Harry still not fond of wizard robes but he was soon to be half Malfoy so he had to adapt with their traditions. So they compromised. Harry had to wears wizard robes every day except weekend when he allowed to wear muggle clothes. Draco had to follow the deal. He had to wear muggle fashion in the weekend when he had no gala invitation. Then after that they will have a simple lunch in one of muggle restaurants not far from Leaky Cauldron.
They purchased everything including new extra books for their courses. They went to apothecary to bought potions ingredients plus
Draco then told Griphook to checked on Potter's vault. He's worried Dumbledore took something important from there.
Minerva read it carefully and shocked after finishing it. How could the lightest light wizard did something that evil. He was more cruel than the dark wizards. He looked at Severus with her eyes widen.
"Heat usually occurs in about same time every month. First heat usually happens a month or two after the awakening. The body need to adjust with some changes. Like you need to adapt to have a birth carnal, it will grown fully in few weeks, your chest too, you will have ability to breastfeeding. Your hormones need to be adjust too. That's why it took longer from the awakening. First heat will last longer than the regular heat. First heat will last seven to ten days while regular heat will last five days a month. In your case maybe your first heat will take longer than common Omega. You aren't ordinary wizard. You are powerful. Your magic is stronger than most powerful wizards. Your heat maybe will last longer than ten days. The more powerful a wizard or a witch the longer the heat and the chance to get pregnant is higher too. Same goes with Alpha. The more powerful the Alpha the longer their rut will last, the chance to knotting is higher. If my calculations right, you will get your first heat maybe on mid September or early October. "
"May I? Draco asked Severus before he talk to Harry in gentle voice. Draco knew Severus looked so broken-hearted when Harry avoided his mother.
"And here's his wand." Tipsy gave Remus's wand to Draco who placed it in the wand holster inside his robes and disappeared.
Harry was laying on Draco's lap, he had massive headache because of his father's letter. He should be with his own mother. Not with that muggles. He was sure the arrangements was to make Harry weak so he would be depended on Dumbledore. That Old Coot wanted to make Harry his pawn. Harry was relieved he was freed now. He was grateful to Draco and his family. He was grateful he's with Draco since sixth year. That's the first time he could be himself. His past life never be his life. He was a puppet. He played his role as golden boy perfectly, now he was free from that title. The war was over. He laid his head on Draco's lap and closed his eyes to ease his headache.
Both finally calmed down. They decided to have a cold shower to refresh their mind. After showered Draco owled his father about Remus and their meeting with the werewolf tomorrow. He then owled Severus about the same matter. He asked both of them to finished their business soon and be in the Manor before ten tomorrow morning. They then looking for Narcissa. But before they went to her room, the house elf said dinner was ready and Narcissa was already sitting there waiting for them. Draco and Harry went to the dining room.
"Where were you for these past months. I asked order but they didn't know where you are. I asked Weasley and they said you never stepped on their house since third year. What happened Harry? Why are you here with him and why you didn't come to the Burrow? What happened between you and Ron and Hermione?" Remus bombarded him with un-answered questions.
" But suppressant is not good for heat or rut cycle if it consumed regularly. Many healer or medi witch don't recommend suppressant to unmated wizards or witches. Birth control potions can be used a three days before heat cycle until three days after heat for Omega who doesn't want to be pregnant or even Alpha and Beta who don't want to be pregnant also although the chance for them to be pregnant lower than Omega. Hospital wings also provide rooms for Alpha to rut without Omega or partner. "
" Is there something you want to talk with me Dragon?" She asked without moved her eyes from her sketching.
They parted away. Draco and Harry flooed to Gringotts to withdraws some galeons and purchased a black muggle card.
"Okay, Okay, sorry." He kissed Harry's eyes and down to the cheek then to his lips. When Harry looked at him with dreamy eyes, Draco slipped himself behind Harry and started to devouring him again.
"How about you went to blood adoptions with Sev? But Sev need to told about his Prince Lordship." Mumbled Draco.
Remus couldn't believe his friend, his brother being burned alive. He was failed as friend. He should've known that Dumbledore had ulterior motive when he asked Remus to stay in his werewolf form telling him he would be safer if he stayed in the woods. And Sirius's case he wondered how the old coot framed them. He wanted to asked about Peter too to Lucius. He had vague memories about that rat.
"Father, don't be too excited. There are several problems. First, Harry needs to be ready for Hogwart as Prince - Potter soon to be Malfoy. We need to tell headmistress about the situation. Should we talked about the truth or should we lied and fabricated fake story to her?" Stated Draco.
Draco looks at Harry with sorrowful eyes. He could feel Harry's pain, he reach out the younger boy, embrace him tight. He let Harry cried until he feels better. He kissed his temples. Draco run his hand up and down on Harry's back in calming motion. He shed a tear but quickly weeped out. He had to be strong for Harry. He released his pheromones. He tried to make Harry relaxed. He determined to make Harry's happy. He swore he will take his revenge to Dumbledore (even in his grave Draco will revenge to that old coot), The Weasleys and that Phoenix Order for Harry. He promised he would make his enemy suffered. But first, he had to tell Severus and his parents about this as soon as possible.
Their friends talked about few things and nothing important although they wanted to know the weds story. How they fell in love and how they finally get married. But before they had a chance to asked them the story, the minister walked towards them and hugged them while congratulate them. He talked few important things to them before he apparated back to the minister.
" Do not be worry Harry. If you forget your vow then you can say anything what's in your mind. If you don't know what to say just say I love Draco to the eternity and beyond. And bla bla bla." Severus hugged his son and calmed down him.
The families had a great dinner and moved to the family living room for a chit chat. Lucius asked Draco about his preparation.
Everyone laughed at this. Severus blushed hard. James loved to tease him about his stubbornness. They continued to read it.
"Lucius is right. I didn't believe my Dark Lord gone just like that. We wil find the answers but we now we should think how we handle the truth. Do we need to tell our allies or should we solve the problem by ourselves." Severus looked grim.
"I'm sorry Harry. I wasn't in my right mind. Sirius and I was a mate. I was grieving too much and abandoned you. I am sorry for making you felt alone. I wouldn't never let you feel unloved. You are loved Harry. I love you Cub. I love you." Remus walked toward Harry and squat in front of him.
Whilst Draco and Harry enjoyed their holiday in France, Lucius, Severus, and Remus spent their days looking for any information about old magic. They read so many books about ancient dark magic. They needed to know if their Lord was still alive or not. Lucius still had his Lord's wand. They tried to traces his magic and found that the wand somehow indicated that he's alive. They couldn't think why The Dark Lord who was mastered in wandless magic used a wand to face Harry in the last battle. Sounds strange for them. He could kill anyone without his wand. Why he used his wand in the battle, why he didn't cast a wandless protection spell, why he let Harry finished him without any force. There were so many whys and hows but they couldn't find the answers. Even Lucius who knew more secrets didn't have any answer for these questions.
"Harry Love, I understand. I know you're worried. But believe me. If he intend to harm us, I will make sure he failed. You have your mother, my father and my mother. They're great duelists. They're powerful wizard Babe. You know it Harry. They fought with us. And won the battle. A lone Remus Lupin won't have a chance. " He kissed Harry's forehead.
" I want to ask Harry to be my mate. I want us to be official. I hope you are okay with it. " Draco said with little confident. His godfather sometimes bit too intimidating.
"Sirius gave me pocket money in summer before my fourth year, and I received a thousand Galeons after I won Triwizard tournament in the end of fourth year. I still have a few in me now. So I never withdrew any galeons since my summer in third year. " explained Harry.
He arrived in the chamber when he found Severus and Remus sat too closely with Remus's hand on Severus's. He raised his eyebrows but saying nothing. His Alpha instinct told him there's something between them but he didn't want to know more. He respected their privacy. He just strolled in and sat in front of them, startled them. Interesting, He said in his mind.
"Yes. I did. But that time was full moon and I couldn't go anywhere so Dumbledore was the one who came to Gringotts for me. He got the Lupin vault's key and gave it to me without saying anything more." Remus answered in low voice. He had money, much money and Dumbledore only gave him a few galeons. He could live nice and enjoy his fortune without worry. He had to live in wood and ate raw foods because he had no money to had a proper meal. He gripped his arm seat tight made his knuckles became white and pale.
Draco who hadn't fully cooling down after their heated snogging looked at his mate with lust. Harry provoking his patience with his cuteness. His mate trying to seduced him.
"But sweetheart we need more. You still haven't had your wedding suit. And some for your honeymoon." Shushed Narcissa.
"Dray" Harry looks at him nervously and after earning an encourage nod from Draco, he looked at Severus with wary look.
Draco understood him well. He too needed to control himself. He didn't want their first time be in this such situations.
"Mr. Lupin, My name is Gornnuk, Mr. Malfoy's vaults manager. I have been instructed to assist you to do blood test. I need you to drop three drops of your blood on this parchment. I will explain more after you done." He told Remus while show him the dagger. He was hesitant but his wolf side reassuring him that this test so important. He warned him not to act recklessly. His wolf usually knew the best for Remus. So Remus without second thought slashed his finger and dropped three drops of his blood on the parchment. The parchment buzzed quietly and now it fulled with words. Gornnuk read and showed them to Remus.
"Dragon, what happened. You were said you will celebrate Harry's birthday together. Why are you and Harry here? Are you two hurt? Did something happened with Harry's inheritance?"
They all shocked at the new truth. They knew James wasn't killed by Dark Lord since Lucius already told his version to them. And Remus already knew from James and Sirius's letters. But his death was beyond their imagination. Poisoned and burned alive. How cruel. That man was evil. He killed James because he was going to Dark Lord's side. So cruel and evil.
Cissa was so happy to see her son after few days stayed in the ministry. She then summoned her husband and Remus to join the dinner. She also invited Minerva to come but was declined. Minerva couldn't be seen with them outside Hogwarts to minimise the suspicions.
Harry seemed unnoticed the effects of him to Draco. He continued making that voice and Draco almost got rut on the spot. Their parents trying to act normal which was hard until Severus couldn't handle it. He snorted loudly then Narcissa laughed and Lucius looked like being choked. Draco was so embarrassed. Merlin, he needed to solve this problem or he will be tortured every time harry let out that sound in public. Draco rub his temples and let out heavy sigh. Harry being Harry Potter the most oblivious wizard in Britain looked at them in confusion.
"Harry, son, you can call me anything. I am indeed your mother but if you want to call me Papa then Papa it is, or if you prefer mother then mother it is. Whatever you want." Severus smiled at Harry. The first genuine smile Severus gave to Harry. Harry beamed. He thought Severus would be as stern as in Hogwarts. He smiled back at Severus. He felt so warm inside. Severus was kind and the smile made Harry felt amazing. The man who bear him was alive. Sat besides him, talked to him with so much love radiating from his body. His eyes maybe teary but he looked happy.
"Yes. I did. I just have a litte problem with fawkes. He refused to leave so I just let him stay here."
"Of course Harry. They will get their karma. We will have our revenged but now first we need to think about how to tell Severus and my parents about all of this, then removed all your blocks and compulsions. After you are free from Blocks and claimed your inheritance, we can make a plan to make their life like hell. Okay?" Said Draco in firm but warm tone. He too feel upset but he try to stay rational for Harry.
"Okay Dragon. You are the head of the house when Lucius not in presence." Narcissa knew that in this kind of situation Draco wouldn't be like if she talked too much. She respected his son's decision. "Thank you for letting me know. I will have Tipsy and Dety to prepare the meal and maybe guest room too." She smiled at Draco.
Severus gave Harry to Draco at the altar and then he sat down beside Remus and the Malfoy on the first row seats.
Draco quicken his grinded speed and sucked Harry's buds. He growled and shot his cum on Harry's bum. Harry followed his lead in instant.
Friday came, Harry woke up with happy thoughts. They would go on date. Harry had a smile on his face, he didn't realize the other party was awake and looked at his silly smile. Draco kissed his cheeks, his neck and his lips before he climbed down from bed and heading to the bathroom to had a shower. Harry's left with not only his cheek but his ears were red. The place Draco was kissed felt warms. He could combusted in happiness.
He sipped his drinks again, he tried to be sober but his mind hit him with his past memories. He remembered his school life, James, Sirius, Peter, and Severus. Ah Severus, that man. Remus shaked his mind trying to remembered his Hogwart time. The most happiest time in his life. His seven years of happiness.
"Harry, dear, please don't be angry. I did that for your own best. Your magic gone wild, it will drained your magic too. Please try to relax. Look at Griphook. Look at this room. Everything is messy, even Griphook knocked out. Now stop glaring at me. I'm blaming you Harry. I just want you to stayed calm and composed. We need to solve this solution with cool head. Stay open mind please." Plead Draco.
His godson! Harry! He almost forgot about their meeting. He cast tempus and it's ten minutes before their meeting time. He straightened his robes, placed the letters for Harry inside his pocket, he took a deep breath and readied himself to apparated to Malfoy Manor.
He remembered what Draco said in his letter. Mild sedative will make his transformations easier but somehow he wqs still in so much pain. Seems liked his transformations different to what Draco been through.
When he finished reading the letter, and looked at the desk, there's a package on it. How could he didn't notice there's a package on the desk when he entered this room. He assumed the package was hidden with spell and the spell off when he opened the letter.
Draco dragged Harry and Remus Florean's store room. The shop owner kindly lent them his store room so they could talk privately.
"Done. Now come on. We need to go out and be ready to walking down the aisle. Stay calm and clear your muddy minds. There's Draco waiting for you outside." Severus held Harry's cold and sweaty hands. His son was too nervous. He patted his head and released comfortable pheromones to ease his son.
Harry re-told him about his transformations. Draco explained to him about why he felt pain in his lower stomach. It's because his body adjusting with new development. He's a male Omega so he started to grow some new part like lactation glands, birth carnal and womb. His body readjust to make him ready to bear children. While Alpha liked him only suffered a few changes like knotting gland inside his groin, a pair of sharp canines which able to bite his partner especially Omega who had mating gland on their neck, a growing bones and muscles. Draco apologize for the pain had to endure. He couldn't imagine Harry's pain. It made him sad and worry but Harry told him it's okay since Alpha and Omega was different.
He suspected there're more stories in Harry. Its not just key vault who in Molly Weasley. The Weasleys were poor and famous for its stealing habits. Like old Muriel. Claiming priceless tiara as hers when in fact it was stolen. And the original owner was dead a day after Muriel had tiara which she said she found it near her house. Goblin couldn't do anything since it was difficult to expose the the truth outside Gringotts. Since then many Weasley's vaults were frozen. They couldn't access their family vaults until Muriel gave the tiara to the owner. Griphook need to made sure The Weasley didn't steal anything from Harry.
Few hours later the morning came. Harry Potter finally opened his eyes blinded by the sun light. He forgot to closed the curtains last night. He heard tapping sounds and saw an owl outside his window. He opened it to let the owl in. The owl dropped a sealed letter and fly away with loud hoot.
Draco showed Severus Harry's certificate and told him not to ask many questions to Harry. He asked him to be open minded and let Harry warm up before he told his past. Harry had dark past which he never told anyone except Draco and maybe his friends but not as detailed as he told Draco. Harry needed someone he can trust and love. He needed his family beside Draco. He's been hurt so many times, lied and abused. It's not easy to make him open up. He had trust issues. Draco learned that from his experience.
"I believe we can continue our conversation far from too sensitive ears and hungry eyes. Tsk. What a degrading people. "He glared at his surroundings. They made a little scene and many people look at their side and some even stop and gather around to watch.
They currently talked randomly with Harry on Draco's lap, Severus sat beside Draco and Narcissa and Lucius in front of them.
Remus chant the binding magical contract and finished it quickly. He's not fond with this. But it's necessary so he shut his mouth and silently binding them.
Both goblins nodded and proceeded everything in hurry. Draco and Harry waited inside Griphook's room. Draco was bit anxious but he gave Harry reassuring smile. Harry looked at Draco with awe expression. Draco was so reliable. He was so cool. Like king when gave his decrees. His Omega side released a content pheromones. He wanted his Alpha knew he was so grateful to him and made his Alpha knew how much he wanted to be with him. He felt so comfortable and almost sleep in the Alpha's embrace.
"Draco, Love, thank you. You're too spoiling me. Anyway dear, will you teach me about traditions and etiquette? I want to learn more about Malfoy's traditions and common pureblood etiquette. I am a pureblood too. I have Potter, Black, and Prince bloods in my veins. I want to be a proper wizard who can understand their history and traditions." He looked at Draco with determination.
Harry nods in agreement. Draco had good points. He remembered his past. How people looked down of him because of his ragged clothes. How people felt intimidated by him because Dursley told their neighbors about his odd behavior. He used to not care about all of that. He was ignorant boy who didn't fit in any level. Pureblood looked down at him because he had no manners, half blood looked down at him because his lack of sense, mud blood looked down at him because he had powers and money but he never used it. They thought he was being fake.
"Thank you Lucius, may I ask you to contact Lady Longbottom to once again sit as school governoor's member. I need her help with some old traditions." Said Minerva.
Harry was in jumbled thoughts for few days. After few thoughts, Harry decided he would asked his mother about it later. He was Draco's godfather. He must knew Draco's better than himself.
"Tipsy is sorry to disturb Master Lucius. The dinner is ready in the family dining room. " he said in timid voice.
After the satisfying lunch, Draco once again grabbed his hand and kissed his knuckles. He finally could talked without interruption.
Draco snapped his head fast looking at his omega with unreadable expression. This is the first time his omega called him Alpha. This is like a mating call. Draco blinked few times to erase his arousal. No one deny being called Alpha by his omega with that such tone make them aroused.
"But how Sev. This is beyond my imagination. How could. Oh, Merlin. I.. you.. oh my. Oh my. I am sorry. I.. "She couldn't finish her sentence.
They moved inside their house and did the same. The walls glowing with vivid magic radiating the manor. They felt giddy in good ways.
"Actually Father, Harry's story about his childhood life gave me this idea. It's combination of muggle and wizard thing. I just need to twist this and that." Draco said confidently. He was so happy his father praised him with his idea.
"It's okay. We've been discussing about this matter. Lucius will give us twice a week to teach seventh and eighth year. Same with Cissa. She will teach twice a week. I believe it's enough for extra curricular classes."
Maybe he could have new start and the first thing was accepting his fate. Believed in this parchment.
you to handle everything." Harry said in soft voice. Draco nods and rub Harry's hair softly. He then moved his gaze to Griphook.
Draco left the manor and went to the ministry after lunch. He already sent all the invitations for their friends with encryption to protect the information inside the invitations.
Draco moved his head to near Harry who still in his lap. He mumbled " Love, would you like to allow me handle this matter? Or do you want to do it yourself?"
"Mother, that hurt." He said jokingly. "I got the first place with my draught of living death potion. You surely remember that mother. I won felix felicis from Slughorn." Retorted Harry half heart.
"Thank you Severus for letting me near my godson. I know you're his mother. James explained that to me on his letter. I know the truth. And I am sorry for everything I've done. Sorry." He gave Severus sad thin smile.
"Let's stop our discussion now. Let's have a dinner and rest. We still have time tomorrow." Groaned Draco. He had a massive headache because of Severus's sentence. He was thinking the same. He needed his rest.
At nine fifty, Harry is ready with his journey. He muttered pack with a swish and all his belonging come into his trunk. In unorganised manner. He re-read his letter from Gringotts
"Cissa, Draco you should get your rest. Tomorrow we will do Blood Ritual, cleasing the manor impurities. We could start after breakfast. We've lost too many bloods today. I need to regain my magic as well. That's all gentlemen. Good night." Lucius ended his speech and retired to his room.
The cleansing rituals of The Malfoys was different. They didn't need much time to complete the rituals. The blocks and compulsions not many but there're few deathly potions inside their systems. The goblins
"I will answer your questions but not here. Let's talk in more relaxed times. I invite you to come to Malfoy Manor. I will expect your presence at ten am tomorrow. And for the start. Harry is my fiancé. He lives with me and our parents. That's all the answers I can give you now. Tomorrow you will get more information but before you go to Malfoy Manor, I suggest you to go to Gringotts and meet Gornnuk. He is my vaults manager. Give this notes to him and he will know what he's going to do. I ask you to be open minded and don't do anything reckless. Don't ask any questions. Just do what I ask and I promise I will explain everything tomorrow in manor."
"It was splendid. I will tell you later. Now come to the dining room with me, I have many gifts for you."
With that, the other members of family went to their own rooms. Narcissa went to followed his husband to their master bedroom. Severus would stayed in his usual room whenever he visited the manor. Draco and Harry would stayed in Draco's bedroom. Draco slipped his hand on Harry's waist and led them to Draco's room. Today was long day. They needed their beauty sleeps.
"Bye Moony, see you tomorrow. Trust me and do what Draco ask you. Please. For me. You will get your answers tomorrow. I promise." He waved at his former teacher.
After that turning point, both mother and son acted like they used to be. Harry was so used to be spoiled, always wanted Severus's attention and Severus gladly giving him what he wanted. Full attention and full of love. Their interactions became more natural. The awkwardness was gone and the atmosphere became warm.
After their breakfast, The Malfoys and The Prince-Potter moved to the living room. They discussed the strategy to face Remus Lupin. Although they knew he wouldn't do anything reckless they still needed to prepared the precautions. Just in case Remus tried to hex them.
"Excellent. Now we proceed. It's good for now. I can go to Kingsley and discuss the next step." Lucius rose from his seat and walked toward the fireplace where he will floo to ministry. "I will have my dinner with minister." Then he gone.
Harry and Draco were going to go to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They will go on Weekend after Draco finished his paperworks. Draco still had to go back and forth from manor to ministry almost everyday. Draco still busy with his international quidditch game event plans. He was more busy than Bagman whom the head of game and sports department. Seemed like Kingsley would replaced Bagman soon. He's useless after all.
"What a pleasant surprise. Congratulations darling. Do you want to have a grand party or just a simple party? Or do you have any other plan?" She literally squealed.
Remus patted his hand and squeezed it gently. Severus looked at him and muttered soft thank you. They became closer after Remus moved to Malfoy manor. Remus kept his hand on Severus's. Minerva noticed it but it's not her business so she kept her eyes on the walls behind the soon to be pair.
Lucius with his charming in political influences and Narcissa with her talent in business made them the perfect combo. Both were from respectable families and still holding their traditions made them so powerful. Many foreign investors wanted to be their business partners.
"Mother, I haven't told Harry about this. I am not sure he will agree and I haven't prepared everything." Draco said in slightly panic tone.
"Continue what you did, I just want to inform you that Lucius came back to the ministry so he couldn't stay here with us. Good evening gentlemen."
Draco groaned while looked at Severus. Really Sev? Wand? He looked at him unamused. Narcissa cuckled. Lucius gulped his wine.
The officiant make them exchanged the rings and the ceremony finally finished and Draco and Harry officially married.
He couldn't control himself. His mate looked so adorable with his pouting face. Draco licked Harry's lips trying to opened it wider. He slitted his tongue inside and invade his cavities. Harry turned his body and faced Draco deepening their kisses. Draco pulled Harry closer and their lengths met in the centre. Draco pulled Harry's bum so he now sat on Draco's lap. They continued their snogging. Harry moaned, he clawed Draco's back when his bum met Draco's length. The friction was intolerable. He couldn't handle the pleasure. He grinded his hole on Draco's length. Draco gripped his hips tight. He tried to stop Harry. He couldn't continue this or he would snapped and rammed his length into Harry's sweet hole.
"Please come inside mister Lupin. They're waiting for you already." Tipsy led him through the huge front yards.
Draco who confused with his sudden burst could only nod and kissed his temples before he piling up Harry's plate.
After a bit heated snogging in the dark alley beside Everyone's Knitting, an old store sell knitting and yarn materials. They walked to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour to have ice creams and calmed down their needed before they went back home.
"Sure, son. Sure. You won that. You just got lucky that time and did you forget who's book you borrowed in your sixth year? If you don't remember then I shall tell you once again. That book Harry is property of Half Blood Prince. The Half Prince and half Snape. My book. I knew you "stole" my book. The sudden flying score in potion and by how high Horace praise you with your perfect concoction nearly got me heart attack. You can tricked old Horace but not me. The first time Horace told me your perfect concoction, I knew you're cheating. I went to potion classroom and found my book wasn't in there. Lucky I'm not your teacher at that year or you will have a year detention with me." Severus ruffled his son's hair.
back to manor for further discussion. I need to inform minister about this. I hope he's smart enough to do the blood test too. Kingsley used to be the one of Dumbledore's pawn. "
Harry looked at the sender. The letter is from Draco. He was curious why his fiancé send this to him and not talked to him by firecall. He opened it and started to read it.
didn't make them drank some potion but they had to pour their bloods on the rune symbol in the centre back of the room. Their ancient and noble blood needed to be activated to help the goblins to cleansed their impurities. The process was less painful still tiresome. They finished not long after Severus and Harry regained their consciousness. The Malfoys needed to do blood ritual inside Malfoy Manor to renewed the wards. Too many impurities inside their Manor. Since the war, the Manor magic was depleted. The Lord and heirs need to feed their magic into the Manor.
Harry and Draco needed five sets formal robes, four sets semi formal robes, five sets casual robes, in green, blue, grey, black, deep red and burgundy colors. They didn't wait for the robes to be ready. They would send it to Malfoy Manor. They then bought shoes, undies and everything. When Harry protests on Draco's excessive shopping, Draco shushed him with a peck on the lips.
Harry smiles at Draco's letter. He chuckle reading Draco's story. Harry knew he will be a good politician. He has unique way to charms his peoples. He's a great strategist, strong and witty. During battle of Hogwart, Draco was the real hero. He's the mastermind behind their winning. He contributed more than Harry. Harry just kill Voldemort because he is the only one who can kill him, thanks to prophecy. But everything else was Draco's hard works. Harry rather biased when it comes to Draco but well, who wouldn't.
"And this book will teach you all you need to know. Use it well. You can share it with Draco or you can read it alone."
Lucius acted like nothing happened but he took a note in his mind to checked Remus and Severus later. He was curious about their awkward situation. He refocus his mind and talked to them.
continued. "There are few thing I need you to do. First, send a notice to my parents and Severus. Tell them to come here as soon as possible, tell them I need their helps with property. Do not spill any words about Harry. Second, I want you to take a blood test on me. I know we already done with my vaults inheritance and lordships / heirships but we didn't take blocks and compulsions test. I am afraid I am under some spells and blocks just like my Omega here. Third, I want you to take the same blood test on my parents and Severus when they're arrived. I will give you a note to my parents and Severus if they made a fuss about the blood test." Draco gave him order with firm yet warm tone.
Draco and Harry arrived at Exquis restaurant at one pm. Draco gave the host his name and they were led into a semi private area. They sat in the corner and looked at the menu. While Draco was choosing the menu, Harry looking around enjoying the view. The place was stunning. It was semi contemporary dining hall. The decor was chic and cozy with beautiful flowers arrangement around the tables. Harry could feel the nice ambiance. He smiled at Draco and muttered soft thank you. Draco had a nice taste. He liked this restaurant. Draco grabbed Harry's hand and kissed his knuckles. Harry blushed at Draco's actions. Draco wasn't this bold in the past. Harry liked this new side of Draco. They were looking at each other fondly. Draco wanted to talked about their bonding when the food was served. They paused their conversation and started to eat. They would continue the conversation later. They were hungry and started to enjoy the food. The food was delicious. Harry liked his Braised Turbot. And the Truffled Macaroni and Cheese was superb. Harry was happy with his date. Draco spoiled him so much. He knew what Harry's like.
Lucius was shocked. He was there and he remembered there's fire but he didn't realize that James was still alive when they're apparated back to Manor. Dark Lord and he casted few protections charm to them. Dark Lord wasn't gone. He just in hiding to protect Sev. He used too much his power to saved Sev. He never told anyone about this matter. It's a secret between him and his Lord. They tried to tracked Harry's whereabouts but Dumbledore was smarter. Who would guess that man hide Harry in muggle world. He remembered his Lord saying that Harry Potter would be the one who killed him. He thought he was his Lord enemy who would bring his Lord downfall. He just knew that his Lord did that to protect that boy. Sighing, he shaked his unanswered questions. He would know the answers later when the time right.
"Oh dear, I'm so happy. I can die in happiness. My heart almost combust by the warm feeling inside my heart. You are so perfect Love. This proposal is so perfect. I wouldn't take no for answers too. I will always say yes to you Darling. Oh Draco, you are so perfect for me. Have I told you how much I love you? I love you too much, I love you more than anything, I love you to infinity. "
Harry was startled when he received the books. Where did he buy this kind of book. He knew his mother bought it for him but he didn't know that his mother prepared this books so early. Was his mother that excited to help him? Wow. He never realized his mother was that kind of wizard. He cuckled at his mother's antic. His own mother was so cute when he acted shy. He left him in rush before he said thank you. Seemed like his mother more embarrassed than him. Smiling, he started to opened the first book. He needed to study about his self. He was clueless about Omega thingy. As the second book, he would read it later when he was alone in his room. He needed to prepared his heart and maybe his gutter too.
"I didn't blame you Remus. I know we have a bad relationship in past, but I hope we can have a good relationship in the future. May I know how you believe in ud? And Uhm, sorry for your loss." Severus smile at him which so rare for Severus to smile not smirked.
"Son, don't be nervous. You will doing great. Draco won't let you fail. Stay still. I'm making your bird nest like hair a bit tamer. I want you to look more beautiful and be the most gorgeous person in the world. Okay honey? Now stay still. Take a deep breath and exhaled slowly." Severus style his son's hair that make him perfect.
"it's about seventy percent done Father. We have a good deal about the tournament with teams. I propose few friendly competitions too for those who don't play quidditch. I can give the list to you." Draco gave his Father his parchment. Lucius read it and his eyes smile brightly. His son is smart. He could come with this genius idea and Kingsley definitely couldn't refuse this brilliant proposal.
Harry and Severus spent few hours a day just the two of them. Draco gave them time as much as they need and offer his study room as their meeting place. Just like today. Draco went to ministry with his father. They were having a meeting with Kingsley. Draco told him he would go back and forth to Ministry for few weeks. Harry didn't understand politics so he didn't ask much about Draco's job.
"Nice idea son. What about if Harry was blood adopted by Severus before his second gender revealed. Since you two have a good relationship for two years it's normal for Severus to blood adopt you. And when your gender revealed Draco asked Severus to court you and now you're mate. How about that?" Piped Cissa.
"Hm, Dray. Thank you for everything. Thank you for being with me and help me with your rational thoughts. Thank you for calming me down. Thank you for taking me. I can't think properly but you handle it well. You are the best Alpha. Thank you. " He snuggled more into Draco.
"Mr. Malfoy, yes we've met when I teached you Defense in your third years. Now can you answer my questions? And why Harry is with you?"
"Harry, I will teach you some spell. I know you will get your heat cycle calendar when we reached Hogwarts but I want you learn it in case you are forget. First spell is heat check. You can check if you are in heat or not. Second spell is cleansing spell. Not like usual cleansing spell, this spell is specially to clean your carnal. You need to clean it before copulating. Third spell is protection spell. In case you are forget about your birth control. It will give you 24 hours protection. You need to take your birth control after 24 hours. If not you will get pregnant. Condoms can be used but it's not popular among wizards an witches. We usually use protection spell. And fourth, I will give you camouflage scents potion. It will give you camouflage your scents during suddenly heat when
"Enough. Behave. Continue your meal. No more conversation while eating." Lucius tried to be stern but failed. He smiled at them before continued his meals. Finally they finished their dinner with peace.
Draco rested his head on the back rest. He closed his eyes. He face the wrong enemy. He killed the wrong person. He felt remorsed. He wished he could back the time and killed Dumbledore and let Dark Lord alive. But the reality was cruel. He killed his Lord and his supporters. He killed Dumbledore but he's not sure about this. Actually he wasn't sure about both. He had weird feeling that those two didn't dead. No that couldn't be. He killed them himself. Sighing, he shaked his thoughts and focused his attention on his family.
"Good morning father, mother, Severus. Today is a lovely day isn't it?" Draco sat on his father's right.
The trio stayed in France for few days. They had their suits done, their rings already designed and would be done in two days and many gifts were already bought for Lucius, Severus, Remus and some for their friends and the teachers.
They then proceed the cleansing rituals. Harry and Severus would be the first who will be cleansed. The Malfoys was after them.
Finally he got the answer he needed. Lily was the one who separated them. And he guessed she's the one who created a rumor about James and her. Remus sighing for the nth times this morning. Everything was so complicated. He felt so sorry to James and Severus. He also felt so sorry to his godson. If Dumbledore didn't do the evil and cruel thing's they would have a peaceful life. He looked at his letter in somber.
" I hope you can read it with calm and civil. I do not want any unnecessary action and no wild magic. I've had enough." Gornnuk showed him the parchment and waiting for his response.
"It's okay. Now let's take a rest. It's been a long day. Go sleep. You two need that." Narcissa released her hugged and went to her own room.
"Not now Sev. We can talk later in the manor." She patted his shoulder. "Harry need to rest. He needs time. You will have plenty time after  this matter settled"
" You are so brilliant Baby. " Harry kissed Draco's cheek. He felt so proud of his alpha. He knew Draco was genius. He's actually the real genius in Hogwarts but the last Headmaster never announced the real number one student in their year and only praise that muggleborn witch about how a muggleborn can be so smart. Even Harry had same OWL with his old so called friend. He just never intended to show off. Harry got ten OWL, same with Hermione just different in she got nine Outstandings and Harry got eight Outstandings, while Draco got thirteen OWL with thirteen Outstandings.
"Come gentlemen and my dear wife. We can continue our unfinished business later. We need our energy back." Lucius led them to the dining room. The other two Malfoys and The Prince-Potter followed him behind. There was a small dining table for six people. Lucius sat on the head table, Narcissa was on his left, with Severus beside her, Draco sat on Lucius's right with Harry beside him. There were simple dishes on the table like fresh salads, roasted chickens, mashed potatoes, mushrooms soups and shepherd's pie, Chocolate mousses, treacle tart, cherries jubile, and some fresh fruits. Draco was piling up Harry's plate with litte amount of various dishes. Harry gaped at him.
There were too many withdrawals not only from Dumbledore and Molly Weasley. There were transferring galeons into Granger vault, two youngest Weasley vaults, The Dursleys vault, and even to Mundungus Fletcher. That dung not only got free galeons but he also stole few artifacts and sell them in black market. Draco almost cursing loudly. Almost. He would definitely scaring Harry. He took few deep breath and command Griphook.
"And for sex education as in real sex based on my experience. I want to tell you how male wizards copulating." Severus said in shy tone.
"Mm. I'll try. Thanks Dray." Harry started to scoop his pie. He let out a soft moan at the delicious dishes he taste that made Draco shifted in his chair. The blond Alpha was blushed hearing Harry's voice. He shaked his head and tried to adjust his sitting position.
"Dray. I didn't do anything." He pinched Draco's hard nub make him halted his step. He smirked at Harry. His eyes gleam in mischievous.
Remus closed his eyes. How could he forget about James and Severus's love. How could he never question him why he was with Lily and not Severus. Maybe there's a story between them. Maybe James was like him, being manipulated by Dumbledore too. Maybe. Maybe he could asked the Malfoy tomorrow and if he was lucky he could asked apologise to Severus. He believed he's there too.
Draco thrusts his tounge inside Harry's mouth, explored his cavities, sucking his tounge, bite his lips, sucked his bottom lip.
Parents always wanted the best for their children. Even sometimes they didn't show it or even when they had different opinions, parents would always wanted the best for theid children. Sometimes protected them from behind without notice, sometimes they could be their opponent so their children would stay in line. Severus and The Malfoys were that kind of parents. They respected their children's choise but still guided them and helped them when in needed. Well, being a parent never be easy.
The two arrived in Lucius's chamber when he's teaching in Hogwarts. Minerva gave him short tour of the chamber. The place was spacious and elegant, the interior was nice and he liked it. It's similar to his room when he was younger.
Remus Lupin was a wizard who lost his family when he was biten by werewolf when he's five years old and gradually devoted himself into the Dumbledore's legacy since he joined Order of Phoenix after he graduated could only looked in agony at the parchment he received from Gornnuk. The family he thought he had was betrayed him. The man he thought he could trust did something more cruel than the Dark Lord. He couldn't believe that his so called friends and mentors actually darker than dark wizards. He was furious. His body shaking in anger, almost lost his mind and let Moony took the control. He was outraged, devastated, and miserable. He let out low pitch whined voice like he's in pain. He felt like something inside him broken in pieces. It's like more anguished than when he lost Sirius.
Lucius decided to visit his vaults in Gringotts to looked for some books from his ancestors. Severus and Remus went to Hogwarts and meet Minerva. Severus, as deputy headteacher asked Headmistress to employed Remus as defense teacher. The werewolf needed a place to stay and being a teacher was a plus. He could be a teacher in Hogwarts, have a nice place to stay and protect Harry in the same time.
"I won't make any excuses. I abandoned Harry. That's true, tho it's not intentional. I broke my promise to James. Sirius was the same. We're too focused on our problems hence made Harry unloved and unprotected. I won't hurt you Cub. I am sorry." Remus looked at Harry gloomily.
"Oh dear you are sweet. Have you prepared the rings? I can throw a simple bonding party where you can marry him. It will be good opportunity to invite our relation to the party and introduce him as your mate. It would be good for publication too so no one will make any mess with you two and us." She rose up from her seating, pacing in the room thinking about the plan.
Draco left Severus and looking for his mother. He went to Art room where his mother spent her afternoon, painting. Narcissa was busy with her sketching when Draco knocking the opened door. He let himself came in and sat in the sofa near the easel.
"Moony, I am okay now. I was hurt by your absence. You were like a different person after Sirius's death. I was in my worst and no one was there for me. I didn't blame you though. It was my own fault. I was just too accustomed have Sirius on my side so I was bit to be too dependent on someone. I just lost and couldn't know how I function without Sirius. But like I said, I am okay now. I met Draco and I'm so grateful to be with him." Harry walked to Draco's side and entwined their hands. Draco rubbed his thumb on his knuckles. Draco gave him reassuring smile.
Severus sat in his chair reading some books. Draco walked closer and sat in the chair in front of him.
Finally after knowing his second gender, He continued writing his letter to Draco, told him about his transformations, he also told him about his letter from Gringotts. He told Draco to meet him at ten o'clock inside Gringotts.
Lucius, Draco and Severus read the letter with frowning face. Severus looked at Remus and letter few times. He wanted to ask him but he didn't find any words.
"I am okay with it. Thank you for asking my opinion. As your godfather you already have my blessings. As Harry's mother I am bit worried about him but I am glad he is in good hand. Treat him well Draco. I want him to be happy and I think you can give him that. Protect him all cost and never hurt him or I will hex your bollocks. " Severus threatened Draco with smile.
Harry clenched his fist on Draco's chest. He gasped. Trying to catch his breath, they separated, their salive made a long silky thread. Their hot and short breathing made the room warmer. Draco put his head on Harry's shoulder, snuggling into his neck. He tried to control his boner. He sighed few times to made his length calmed down. He kissed Harry's gland. Smelling his omega scents. This was the first time they lost control. Draco didn't want to move closer. He put a safe distance between them so he could made his hard boner soft.
Few times later, Griphook back with Severus who looked distressed. Draco assumed he already took his blood test and he's looking for his family. Griphook explained to Draco that he needed a more time to convince Severus to take blood test. He didn't let Griphook near him without telling him the truth, so Griphook put a binding spell on him, then pricked his finger and let the blood dropped onto the parchment. He denied everything at first but after long explanation, Severus acknowledged this facts. He swallowed his tears back when he run in rush into Griphook's room and found not only Harry but The Malfoys also sat on the couches. Severus looked at Harry who now was sitting beside Draco with longing eyes. Harry who were splitting image of James except his eyes which he hate him for that, became beautiful Omega who now have mixed feature, he could see his resemblance on him. He no longer had that wrench eyes. He was always in hurt whenever he looked at Harry's eyes. His subconscious mind told him to treat Harry with kind and love but his pride too high. That eyes remembered him of his hurtful past. Shaked his head, Severus continued to examine his son. His beautiful Omega son now looked happy and content under the protection of Alpha Draco.
I am sorry I made a mistake with Harry's age. He should be eighteen this summer. I wrote seventeen on my summary.
"I don't do anything Dray." Harry's voice near Draco's ear. He looked at Draco with innocent eyes. He tried to act cute.
"Mother, Father, please do not tell Sev about this matter before he is being himself. He needs to take blood test first. I'm afraid he wouldn't belive us if you told him before the truth revealed. " Draco asked his parents with worry eyes.
Severus and Narcissa spent their time together to catch up about everything when he's not with Harry. Severus maybe Lucius friend at first but he's closer to Narcissa. Maybe because he could be more relax around her or maybe because of both were mother or maybe even if Narcissa was an Alpha, she never made Severus uncomfortable around her. Narcissa was gentle and regal not like typical Alpha with dominant and suppressing aura. His Omega side wouldn't feel intimidated by her Alpha side's dominance because Narcissa never used her power to suppressed others. Except maybe when she's angry. Not that she used it so often. Severus and Narcissa had tacit understanding between them which sometimes make Lucius jealous during their Hogwarts's year. Lucius was possessive Alpha and didn't like sharing. He would be very territorial with what was his. But after years together and spent the time with both of Alpha, Severus knew how to behave around them. He was so used with Lucius possessiveness. He would put a good distance with Narcissa. But now they three were more like family so Lucius wouldn't get jealous over Severus. Moreover Severus was Draco's godfather. There's nothing to be jealous about. They had harmonious friendship. Severus was sitting on the west balcony reading potion book with Narcissa knitting next to him. It was just early August, but the weather felt nice. Less hot than usual. Severus already informed Headmistress McGonagall about Harry being his lost son and about Harry and Draco possible mate. Technically they haven't mated yet but Severus one hundred percent sure they will mate soon. Both spend twenty four seven together. Inseparable. Draco and Harry would like to be in same room and Severus opted for good room which was a bit secluded. He told her about possible dangers if someone knew about Harry as his son and as Draco's mate. As an Omega and a mother he was afraid that Harry would be hurt or being target harassment by young Alphas when he's in Hogwarts. He had something in his mind and it made him agitated. He talked at Narcissa.
Harry was trying to free himself but Draco gripped him tight not allowing him to escape. Draco still grinding his hard length on Harry's back. Harry moved his legs intended to wake up but it made hard monster behind him found his companion. Draco somehow slipped his bare length through Harry's thighs and met Harry's length. The friction make Harry buckled his head. He unconsciously clenched his thighs and trapped Draco's length making more frictions for both lengths. Harry felt his mate grinned from his kisses on his neck and he realized that was intentional.
"Okay. But I want revenge. I want my rights. They are cruel Draco. They lied to me. They who I thought my family lied to me. I hope they rotten in Hell." He almost yelled at Draco.
Harry, dear. Don't worry. I won't let mister Lupin hurt you. I believe he would accept you for who you are." Narcissa hugged him.
"Harry, dear. Come face your audiences. We have to talk about it dear. Your mother, my parents want to help you. We aren't going anywhere. We need to hear your opinion Harry. No need to be afraid. You can talk to me, to us. We won't be angry or against your opinions. We won't do anything you don't want."
"I know. I know. It hurts so much when I knew the truth but it's too late. I determined to tell the world the truth about Dumbledore. But I still need more evidence. Lucius and I have few theories and I need your help for that." Severus talked quietly. He still felt hurt whenever he remembered James. He sighed few times to ease his pain.
" You will come home tonight? We can spend the time together? Really Love? " Harry's eyes shone so brightly knowing his fiancé will come home with him and accompany him.
Lucius, Narcissa, and Severus already sitting on their seat in the family dining room. Lucius and Severus both buried their head at Daily Prophet while Narcissa is cutting few apples for
The Malfoys had few nice buildings in Paris. They would stay in their manor in Paris. Draco and Harry spent their day following Narcissa in and out shopping places. They already had their suits and robes from Fabio, and Twilfitt and Tatting's but Narcissa wanted them to have few more.
"No need. I want to finish this as fast as you can. I want all the blocks removed and I will claimed my Lordship and Heirship except Black. I need to talk to the new Lord of Black. I don't want that house. Too many bad memories in there." He shaked his head. He wanted to removed the burden quickly.
After an hour or so, The Malfoys was done with their blood ritual. The manor now full with magic which made the ward much stronger. The was dull and somber manor now looked lavish and extravagant.
"Cissa, What should I do about Harry and Draco? I want Draco mark Harry before Hogwarts but seems like Harry's first heat will be in two month. He would be in heat when in Hogwarts which is dangerous for him. And Draco will face too many rivals. I am anxious thinking about the worst possibilities. Help me." He sounded distressed.
Harry knew that Severus had kind heart. Behind his stoic facade he's warm and nice. During his sixth and seven years he's the one who teached Harry, took care of him when everyone abandoned him because he choosed Draco over their so called friends. Severus often nagged at him even scolded him if he did something danger and reckless. Severus was his mentor, his protector, his friend, he was like a parent figure in Harry's life and he enjoyed every minutes he spent with the man. Severus always be there for him even before they knew they're mother and son. The pull already there but they didn't know it yet. Draco often jealous at their closeness, he said that Harry stole his Godfather. He laughed at Draco's childishness but he liked to teasing him and sometimes Harry and Severus put a show to acted like father and son. Draco would sulked and after that they made up and laughed at their jokes. But now he can express his feeling more to Severus without made Draco felt jealous. He could pour all his heart out to him, loving him, protect him too without made his Alpha jealous.
"I will read it with you all. I want you to hear it too. Mother is that okay with you?" Severus give him a firm nod. Severus still a bit uncomfortable with Remus. That Alpha werewolf make his Omega side uneasy.
"Moony?! A rather loud voice came out from Harry's mouth. Draco gasped at Remus. They couldn't believe their eyes. Moony or Remus Lupin, a tall lanky man with chestnut brown hair, few scars on his face make him rougher than he should be, stood there few feet in front of them with mouth wide open. He walked closer in flash and pulled Harry into his hug.
he days went smoothly without any disruption. Draco still went back and forth between Ministry and home. Harry spent his days with his mother and Cissa planning his wedding with Draco. He actually didn't want to participate but Cissa dragged him in. Same with Sev. Lucius and Remus were lucky. They went to Hogwarts and spent the days in there helping Minerva. That was actually a lame excuses.
