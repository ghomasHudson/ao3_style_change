"Fuck," Potter muttered again.
But the kitchen was empty and it was past ten already, so it seemed like Draco didn't have a lot of choice where to go and what to do.
"We should hurry," he said placing potion phials on the nightstand. "He's talking to Snape right now, but I don't think Snape could distract him any longer," Potter was dragging a coffee table with water and towels on it to the bed.
tell you something," Harry said in a cold voice, standing up from the table. "And you will listen and won't interrupt. Do you understand me?"
"Hey! It was me who was brewing this shit, you, ungrateful oaf!" Draco raised himself on his elbow and smacked Potter's shoulder with his free hand.
"Tell me what is going on."
Draco scowled at Potter's grin when he handed Draco his red Gryffindor t-shirt and a pair of pale grey pyjama bottoms he brought for him to sleep in.
"He's coming here to pick me up," Draco explained, blushing.
Suddenly Harry let go of his hand and Draco panicked at first, but then Harry kneeled down and Draco saw a motorbike near one of the walls, and Harry was unlocking the chain from around the lamppost with a broken lamp.
And now was the moment when he wanted to say them the most, but his throat didn't seem to work properly.
"Are you sure, baby?" he asked, pulling back and looking into Draco's eyes.
"I'll take care of it," Theo said solemnly.
He fucking loved the way Harry's breath hitched during that moment when Draco was above him.
But Harry still had work and was quite busy sometimes, and though Draco was usually with him in the pub, most of the times he was actually hanging out with Pansy (when it was Ginny's shifts at the bar) and occasionally with Blaise, and even Millie and Theo. To Draco's great irritation Liza was quite often there too, and she was always absolutely shamelessly flirting with Harry. That was driving Draco mad, but Harry never paid her much attention, especially if Draco was nearby.
"Hermione, you just almost killed the fucking snake but you can't bloody
It was the third night of waiting for Kreacher and they were sitting on the sofa in front of the kitchen's fireplace in silence and with mugs of peppermint tea floating nearby.
Of course it was Hermione – Harry's rather annoying best friend and also a manager in his bar – who woke them up next morning. It wasn't the first time she barged in Harry's flat like this while Draco was there too and while both, he and Harry, were completely naked.
"You can," Severus said and continued to drink his coffee.
"It's burning," he heard Harry muttered. "It's fucking burning everywhere."
"Do you need help?" Draco realized that Weasley and even Granger spoke at the same time with him and they all stared at each other.
"YOU! FILTH! MUDBLOOD'S INBRED! YOU WILL NEVER BE A TRUE MASTER OF THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK!"
"There is no need to remind him of Black now, don't you think?"
"He could not," Severus growled gazing at Potter.
Thank you for reading and sorry for any mistakes ❤
"Harry, are you in some danger?" Granger asked anxiously.
Draco's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the sound of the front door opening then closing quietly. He froze and turned to look at Granger, but she already was out of the kitchen, running up the stairs and yelling:
large warm palm was almost overwhelming. Harry didn't let go right away and was smiling at him warmly.
Draco swallowed and nodded. He didn't know why he couldn't say Harry about the way he felt here. Merlin, and he was supposed to sleep in here too...
But Draco clutched his hands in the front of Harry's t-shirt, tugging him closer to himself. It was just two bloody fucking hours without him and Draco already missed Harry's touches so badly, he almost whimpered with relief when he pressed his face into Harry's neck and inhaled deeply.
Potter's cheeks were bright red too and he was staring at his elf with slightly wide eyes looking absolutely gobsmacked. It made Draco felt a little more confident and he cleared his throat and squeezed Potter's hand.
"You will see."
Draco wasn't sure he even noticed appearance of his friends, considering the way he jerked a little when Granger started speaking.
She jerked awake and sat up blinking rapidly and looking around nervously, and almost jumped off the bed when she saw Severus. She moved to the armchair with snoring Weasley in it and kicked him rather hard in his calf.
Draco scowled at his cup and ignored the question.
, waving her hands weirdly, but Harry smiled at her too, and after a few moments joined in the singing.
Draco had no idea what was going on, but apparently they knew something about original locket that was Dark Lord's Horcrux, seemed like they even saw it, but didn't know where it was now.
Potter turned his head to look at Draco. "Truth is that I actually care, Malfoy. I don't hate you, don't think I really ever have. And it's not my home, it's just the place I owe."
Both Harry and Draco liked it so much, they ended up drinking nearly the whole menu and by the time they were back to their apartment and lying naked on the bed, all they were able to do was some lazy snogging.
Severus almost spilled his evening tea all over himself when Draco asked him for dittany that day. He didn't want to tell Severus about Potter, so he had lied that he needed an essence for his experiment with a Wiggenweld potion.
"I had two, almost three months to know Draco and to learn to trust him. All I ask from you, guys, is to trust my judgment," Harry said quietly and sat back into his chair.
Almost two hours flew by and Draco was even a little disappointed to step on the solid ground again.
was in charge of everything – he could touch whenever he wanted and wherever he wanted, he could move in a pace he had set himself. He even went so far as saying Harry not to thrust up, and surprisingly Harry listened to him, though he gave him a rather weird look.
But Draco was looking only at Harry, who looked a little shy with slightly flushed cheeks and sheepish smile. He moved his gaze on Draco again and his smile became warm and gentle. He caressed down Draco's cheek with his fingertips slowly.
"Oh, come in, honey! I'm in the freezer!"
"How are you feeling?" Draco asked.
When Harry laid his hand on the back on Draco's chair, Draco moved closer to him and leaned against his side. Harry wrapped his arm around his shoulders and Draco felt warm, safe and strangely happy. Sickened expression on Weasley's face only made him feel better and he hid his smirk behind his goblet of pumpkin juice.
Harry growled into his mouth and slid his hands up Draco's thighs, then gripped Draco's hips, forcing him to grind down on his lap. Draco moaned and ran his hands through Harry's hair (
"I can't really believe it, Harry," Draco breath out. "And of course I like it, nobody ever did something like this for me," he blushed.
"He needs Severus," Draco muttered nervously when Harry's screams grew even louder.
Draco jumped on the sound of the loud creaking voice and almost drew his wand out of his sleeve, but it was just ugly wrinkled house elf, bowing in front of Severus and muttering something under his breath.
"I'm not sure if Draco asked him, but in a few minutes you can ask him yoursef," Millie said happily.
Harry...
Draco got up from the bed and looked around the room. He spotted a trunk with his clothes under the window near his –
"It's half past six already," Harry murmured quietly in Draco's hair. "I think I should cook something for us to eat for dinner, I'm not sure Kreacher will be back today."
"I'm Harry," the man smiled and held out his hand for Draco to shake.
He leaned against Potter's chest and buried his face in Potter's neck and let himself cry, clutching with both hands at the front of Potter's t-shirt. Potter just hugged him tightly and held him, stroking his hair and rocking him a little.
Harry hid his face in Draco's hair and was laughing softly, his hands still around Draco's waist, squeezing tightly.
Harry locked his bike to the post and stood up, turning to look at Draco.
After the breakfast Draco spent some time in his lab, checking on a draught of Peace that he started brewing yesterday morning when Potter sent him a bunch of hellebores.
"Hey," Draco said quietly into his phone. Everyone was still staring and Draco was blushing again.
2019/11/22
– bed. Potter went after him, but he wasn't grinning anymore and his expression became rather painful again.
"Great!" Harry grinned at him, then turned to look at Draco. "Can I take you home now, baby? We can grab some Chinese on our way, if you're hungry."
"Well, Parkinson at least. She still doesn't know where you are and if you're even alive."
"I know," he mumbled. "Thank you."
– him in front of his friends. Did it mean their relationship was serious? Was there even any relationship between them?
Draco came to stood next to him. "You were right, I've liked it."
"Not everything is about you, Malfoy," Potter smirked and nudged him a little with his shoulder. "I'm okay, it is not a big deal."
"I said go back to your room."
"When are we going to do that? And how?" he asked after a while.
"I was safe," Draco said still standing awkwardly in the middle of the room.
It was past 4 in the morning now and Harry was snoring softly on the sofa, his head on the armrest and one of his feet on the floor. Draco was lying between his parted legs with his arms around Harry's torso and his cheek pressed to Harry's chest. He was watching the fire in the large kitchen fireplace, that they lit with Harry earlier in the beginning of the night, and wondering if it all was just a dream and in the morning he would wake up in his bed alone.
"Do you have a Sleeping drought?" he didn't hear Granger came to stand next to him. "I healed what I could, he wasn't wounded much. But I think we should put him into sleep before casting a Stasis charm."
"I don't want anything in return, Malfoy, I wanted to help you, not to make a bargain with you!" Potter said a little angrily.
"She is not my girl, her name is Hermione, and you can call her that or rather Miss Granger," Potter said angrily while Severus was trying to unbutton his shirt.
Thank you for reading and sorry for any mistakes ❤
"Sirius wasn't," Potter said immediately.
He was nodding so enthusiastically, he didn't even notice when Harry had time to reach for lube again, he only gasped loudly in surprise when Harry slipped his two lubed fingers in Draco's still loose hole.
Harry moved a little closer and Draco's breath hitched–
"It's actually none of your business, Malfoy."
"I suppose I could tell you someday, but not now," the man told him after a rather long pause. "Due to that mistake and its consequences the only chance I had left was to go to Albus Dumbledore and ask, or more accurately beg, for his help. But instead I managed to make myself his servant for the rest of my life; I did make an Unbreakable Vow with him and became his secret spy in the ranks of Death Eaters. And maybe I never was the Dark Lord's pawn, but I used to be Dumbledore's for almost half of my life."
"Hey," he greeted her. "No... What? Why the hell are you asking?... Gin... Okay... No, he's fine... Why, are you his mother?... Okay, okay, calm down, bloody hell... What? Pansy!... Well, I'm not asking you if you and Gin... Okay, fine... Alright... Bye." he ended the call and looked at Draco. "Well, she's furious you didn't tell her anything, she was really worried until Gin said to her that I left with, er, a very posh and very cute blonde guy–"
Harry came home looking tired and not in a very good mood, he said he was irritated with Hermione, who always wanted to know Harry's opinion before doing something, though Harry told her that he wouldn't be very available and she would need to do everything herself. They ended up having a little fight and Harry felt really bad for that.
"You don't want to talk to her?" Harry leaned over to look at the screen. "May I?" he asked with a smirk.
"Sorry it took me so long, but I was so angry and irritated with Snape and it just caught me off guard. And he managed to feel me, so he just–"
Severus himself stood near the bed and was glaring at Kreacher who was glaring right back at him.
Kreacher said him that Potter called for an elf early that morning and told him to take a basket and a note to Draco but not waking him up if he'd be still asleep, so Kreacher left it on his nightstand.
"It's not– I didn't mean it like that, I just can't understand why are you helping me."
"Don't say that name, you stupid Half-blood! Didn't you listen to what Kreacher was saying to you?" Potter's elf cried out loudly, interrupting him. Potter stared at his elf. "This name is forbidden! Kreacher was told to warn his stupid Master not to use it anymore. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named placed a Taboo Curse on his name! Say it and his Death Eaters will know your location immediately and all the protective charms will be ruined at once!"
Potter's face was handsome as always and so open, the stubble really suited him well, his eyes were so extraordinary green, and his lips were so... Draco looked away quickly but he felt himself blushing already.
Now Draco was standing in front of the mirror in Harry's bedroom and fidgeting nervously with the collar of his blue button up shirt, that he knew his mother liked seeing him in.
He became very aware of their height difference in this position, Draco's eyes were right at the level of a little hollow between Potter's collarbones, and it took almost all of his self-control to look away.
Draco hurried to take it and then hurried to Harry who already started choking on his devil's laughter. He stroked Harry's sweaty hair from his face, calming himself while he tried to feel all the magic boiling inside of him and trying to take control of it.
Draco spent the most of the following day packing his and Harry's things, while Harry was working at the pub.
Potter just stood up with a sigh and walked out of the kitchen, Draco followed him.
Draco happily lost himself in the deep green, but Kreacher decided to ruin the moment with loud coughing.
Potter just laughed and said he found some nice place where Draco could have his 'fancy breakfast'. And they started to walk through the forest in comfortable silence.
But Harry was already kissing him passionately, fisting one of his hands in Draco's hair and gripping his hip with the other.
"I believe it will be like this."
"Is that all now?" Severus asked him again.
Well, that for sure was the most bizarre thing that ever happened to Draco in his whole 21 years, so all he could do was just stare at the ice-cream cake (
"Well, maybe you're a Secret fucking Keeper–"
"Harry, please, don't die!" Draco suddenly blurted out and buried his face in the pillow near Harry's neck.
Draco also couldn't understand in what kind of relationship Severus and Potter were, and when and how they started to cooperate with each other.
3:19 pm
Draco heard the noise from the kitchen while he was reading in the dawning room, but when he finally decided to check what was going on, there was only angrily pacing Granger in here.
What Draco wasn't expected in the slightest was both of his parents' reaction to Harry's last name. They both stilled and held their breaths looking at Harry strangely.
The helmet was new, Harry bought it specially for Draco, and Draco loved it. It was black too, like Harry's, but it had a painting of curled up Chinese dragon in green and silver on the back of it.
"Potter was saying that Dark Lord told to my father he's going to torture me to death through my Mark. Can he really do this?" Draco asked nervously, watching Severus who was carefully wiping his arm with a wet clean towel. Draco's Dark Mark looked bright red against his slightly pink burned skin.
When did he come and why Draco didn't notice? Was he asking him something? Why Draco didn't hear?
Well, he actually was nervous, almost as much as he was excited, he was also a little drunk, and it was really difficult to think properly when Harry was still holding his hand.
"Pack your things, now," he said throwing a little trunk in front of him. Draco stared at it for a moment and then lifted his gaze up only to see an irritable impatience on the other man's face. "Did someone stun you? Or have you recently become fond of pretending to be a member of the Crabbe family?" the man sneered.
Potter slowly lifted his hand to Draco's face and carefully brushed some tears from Draco's cheeks with his thumb.
"Yes, it is," Severus started to walk up the stairs. "Try to be quiet in the hall," he told him before he pushed the large wooden door and came into the house, Draco quickly followed him in.
"Dumbledore left him some task too," Potter said in a strange quiet voice. "It's about me, this task I mean. It's really complicated, Malfoy... But– I am really grateful for what he's doing for me. I mean, I've never could imagine he would. Dumbledore didn't even think about it, and here I am, believing he did care for me, believing he lo– but he just..." Potter laughed sadly. "Snape knows something about me even Ron and Hermione don't know, and I think I'd like to tell them, I think I'd like to tell you, really, but– It's not so simple to say. And it was hard enough for me to accept that information, but... I really don't know what to say, Malfoy. I wish I wouldn't know this till the end, really. But I actually believe in Snape," he snorted. "I'm sorry for telling you all this nonsensical shit, I just can't stop babbling sometimes."
"Okay, I'm going," he stood up from the table and clapped Harry's shoulder. "It's getting more and more sweetly disgusting with every second," he added, wincing.
“British?” she asked (without accent) smiling up at them.
"Draco," Harry looked at him pleadingly and took his hand in both of his. "You should go and have some dinner too–"
Potter placed Draco's hand in the palm of his other hand, and the hand which was earlier holding Draco's found its way around Draco's shoulders, drawing Draco even closer to Potter's body.
"What thing?"
"Also Dumbledore knew he was dying and he planned his own death with Snape. He made Snape promise him that he would be the one who will kill him, not Draco."
“Yes, we’re from London,” Harry answered, smiling politely at her.
"Draco–"
"I'm not sure what you're trying to say, Potter, but pudding was indeed more than fine," Draco smiled to him too and looked away quickly before he blushed or said something stupid. "But what's with this place? It's a nice view, but not that special in my opinion."
This time Draco wasn't able to suppress his whimper, and it made Harry pull Draco even closer to him.
They walked to the big staircase in the end of the hall and Draco followed Severus down the stairs and found himself in surprisingly clean, bright and warm large kitchen.
"Nothing's funny about this situation, Snape," Potter said.
Harry cupped Draco's ass in his big palms, and was kneading it rather roughly. Draco threw his hands around Harry's neck and tried to climb him, but failed miserably with his legs tangled in his own lowered pants.
"That's enough, Draco. Out of the room, now." Draco didn't notice when Severus became so angry.
"I am afraid I made him miss the dinner," Severus said, answering for him.
He whimpered more loudly, when Harry's fingers left his ass, but then he was turned to face Harry and the next second his mouth was thoroughly devoured by Harry's, and he was almost crying from all the sensations he felt at that moment.
"Bloody hell, you're even talking like him now!" Weasley yelled while Draco's smirk grew wider.
They hadn't actually done something more than just snogging. Draco was afraid of the next move and Harry wasn't pushing him, but today Draco was feeling suddenly bold.
"Yeah, let's go back to the kitchen," Harry said and took Draco's hand to lead him out of the room.
"You're so fucking hot, baby," Harry whispered into his ear. "So gorgeous," he licked Draco's earlobe, and Draco shuddered, whimpering quietly.
"Yes, it is, Master."
Harry liked the idea, but Draco was anxious about letting him out of the house even under his Cloak, when Death Eaters were still around. But he couldn't object much after Granger handed Harry a phial of Polyjuice Potion with a hair of some old muggle man, as she said.
"Books about Horcruxes? But what information he can possibly look for if not how to destroy them? Harry?"
"I'm going to blindfold you and tie you up," Harry whispered, leaning over Draco and moving his lips against the skin behind Draco's ear. "Will you let me, baby?" he asked, grinding his hips to Draco's.
"Let's just sleep, Harry," Draco said quietly and tugged on his hand to make him lay. "Do you need one more dose of Blood-Replenishing potion?"
Harry, on the other hand, was not amused at all. There was such a guilty expression on his so handsome face that Draco started to feel guilty himself. And when Harry sat down on the chair looking so tired and somehow defeated, Draco came to him to stroke his hair.
Draco watched how Severus stood up from his chair and came to Potter. He made him sit on one of the chairs and take his robe off, and then he was waving his wand over all of Potter's body, murmuring some diagnostic and healing spells.
When, after a couple of minutes, Harry pulled away and sat up, straddling Draco's hips, Draco was able to manage a breathless "Yes, yes, Harry!" and was rewarded with Harry's gorgeous smile.
"We're meeting almost every morning a little more than a month. We've been exchanging notes with Kreacher's help and I once wrote him how hard I was coughing from dust the other day and he just ordered Kreacher to bring me to him if I'm okay with it, so... Granger and Weasley don't know by the way. He's not sure they'd react well, I think. And he is walking rather far from their camp to meet with me."
"Why do I help? Because I can and because it's the right thing to do. Malfoy, you're not a stranger to me."
And now Draco suddenly realized that Harry looked older than twenty or twenty one. Was he really much older than all of them, or did he just look older?
Draco panicked for a moment and almost ran to his room to change, but then decided he didn't care. He loved to wear Harry's clothes. And if it made Weasley that mad he would do that more often.
"I asked if you don't mind me joining you?" that perfect voice again. Draco could listen to it forever and never get tired of it, he was sure.
"I want to tell Draco," he said firmly.
Draco read the note again and smiled to himself on the thought or Potter trying to sneaked out under Granger's nose to bring Draco berries one last time.
"Because, Draco, I love you, but I wouldn't be able to give it to you very often. It's kind of hard for me to not have all the control."
"Oh, Merlin, not you too," Potter snorted. "I have it under control now. I can actually Occlude, but I want to know what's going on there. Kreacher! Kreacher, take Malfoy's things to my old room. Bring clean towels, some big bowl and a jar with cold water as well. And don't go anywhere." Potter walked to where Draco stood and was taking potions from the shelf while he was talking; he put one phial into his pocket, and held others in his hands.
If Sirius Black was truly disowned, he wouldn't be able to make Harry his Heir. Formally, Harry was Lord Black now, though he couldn't feel and control Blacks' magic as good as Potters'. Someone who was disowned couldn't transfer the title and the powers to someone who even wasn't Black by blood. And if Andromeda Black, now Tonks, was truly disowned, Harry wouldn't be able to feel her or her daughter's magic in the ritual room.
"What the hell, Ron? Of course not!"
(See the end of the chapter for
She wasn't in any hurry to stand up and go away, and Draco didn't want her here any longer, so he laid his head on Harry's shoulder and started kissing his neck.
Severus looked straight at Draco's face and was searching his eyes intently for a long moment. Draco didn't know what exactly he wanted to find there, but it seemed like finally he found something.
"And why is that? I think I can do whatever the hell I want and you of all people have nothing to say about it."
Yes, Harry was nice and gentle to him, but did someone like Harry really need someone like Draco?
Draco smirked and leaned a little forward. Harry's smile grew wider while he moved his hand closer to Draco. Draco thought Harry's eyes became even greener when he watched Draco leaning some more and taking a pie from the fork he was holding.
"Draco," Harry was looking at him with concern. "Why are you not eating? You don't like it? Eat at least mashed potatoes, okay?" he laid his hand on Draco's thigh and was rubbing it with his thumb.
"He was not happy about this situation, obviously. But you are here, aren't you?"
"You're not a Master of this elf, are you?" Draco asked.
Draco had never got ready so fast in his life before and only five minutes later he was already standing among tall great oaks holding Kreacher's hand. He closed his eyes and inhaled slowly and deeply.
"Kreacher's Master was saying that if young Master Black will agree, Kreacher must be bringing him to Kreacher's Master for a little walk. And if young Master Black hasn't had his breakfast yet, Kreacher should pack some toasts while young Master Black will be getting ready."
Draco was alone in the house most of the time that last month he lived here but that was different. He knew Severus would be in a library all afternoon and would stay for dinner almost each day.
"Yeah," was all Draco was able to produce.
, and I have a planned program on the
At the same time a silver otter appeared and said: "Be in the place where you left us in a five, Ron will come to fetch you," in Granger's voice.
"But what about Weaselette?"
"Are father and mother alright?"
Draco nodded, then realized that Harry couldn't see him and uttered a breathless "Yeah", then hung up after Harry promised he would be there in twenty minutes. Draco wasn't sure why he asked Harry to meet him here in front of his entire Eco class, and he started panicking, though he didn't really know why.
In the whole his live Draco had never wanted something more than to reach out for Potter that moment, hold his hand or hug him as tight as he could and tell him that everything will be alright.
Draco didn't have any idea what Potter was talking about and wanted to say him to stop his stupid bubbling, as he was cut off by someone's dog Patronus appearance.
Just two days! He should make sure they wouldn't forget to pack all the things they would need!
came into his mind, but he liked it more and more with every second that passed.
Then familiar warm hands were gently stroking his hair from his forehead and carefully pressing a cool towel there too.
"Um, yes, I– it's warm," Draco whispered feeling himself blushing for hundredth time this night.
"But maybe that'll be alright," Harry whispered against Draco's slightly panting mouth, then covered it with his own.
"I believe you and your friends should stop using Patronuses for communication," Severus said and stood up when Potter started walking to the door. "Yours is too recognizable. And don't send any Patronuses into and out of this house, they can be traced very easily."
"I think so," Harry laughed and kissed the tip of his nose.
"You're absolutely incredible," Harry whispered in Draco's ear and Draco was barely able to suppress a whimper. "Shut the fuck up, Ron," Harry said cheerfully to stupidly gaping Weasley, and took Draco's hand leading him down the stairs and into the kitchen.
He felt dreadful fear slowly enveloping all his insides the more Harry was talking. He felt cold dripping all over his body when Granger was explaining about the dairy and how the first of seven Horcruxes was destroyed by Harry in their second year.
"Do you mind if I ask why you've been sitting here alone for more than an hour?" Harry asked him, letting go of his hand.
"Drop the act, Potter," Severus sneered at him walking to a table with a plate of toasts and a cup of black coffee floating in front of him.
"Not as much as I thought, actually," Draco looked up at him too. "Why were you asking about tomorrow?"
"Don't see any problem here."
"You need to heal yourself," Harry said worriedly, but he took a glass and drank. "I saw you fell from the stairs, Ron, and I think I remember Nagini was trying to attack Hermione. How we were able to escape?"
"What? You know her?"
And fuck, all of this was so good, so perfect, Draco had never thought that something like this could bring so much pleasure. He was so close already, but he wanted it to last as long as possible, and he didn't want to come that much earlier than Harry.
The sound of the book that Draco was reading falling on the floor made Weasley turned towards him sharply and Draco gasped loudly in horror on the sight of Potter in Weasley's arms who was unconscious, terribly pale and covered in great amount of blood.
"Luna, it's me!" Harry called back.
"Snape!" Potter greeted him cheerfully. "It's good you're back, I was meaning to ask you something."
Then Potter came to him and placed a small tube on the bedside table. He was saying something but Draco couldn't catch his words, he was just staring into his green worried eyes helplessly.
Draco felt himself grinning like a loon, but he didn't actually care and almost ran out of the bathroom to change his clothes, shouting to Kreacher to pack the fucking toasts.
Kreacher disappeared and Potter looked at Draco with these bright beautiful green eyes and for a moment Draco forgot how to breathe.
"There is no me and Harry, Granger," he interrupted her.
Draco smiled to himself imagining Potter wandering through the forest with a large potion book in his hand.
He felt like he might cry from everything he was feeling. He remembered Pansy was telling him that her previous girlfriend always cried during orgasms, and they both thought it was kind of weird. Draco didn't remember the name of the girl, but he thought that now she would be able to understand him more than anyone.
So with Potter's help Draco finally was able to brew more useful potions and droughts.
Draco thought he was scared when he learned about Potter being an
"Er– yeah, it supposed to be a Hungarian Horntail in fact," Potter said smiling sheepishly. "Mrs. Weasley made it for me on Christmas in our fourth year, after–"
"Yeah, I'm fine, 'Mione," he turned to smile at her too. "How are you?"
"Too many questions, Granger," Draco said in bored voice. "And your precious Potter is pretty able to answer all of them, so I advise you to ask him if you're so interested."
A few days later Draco was standing by the open window and gazing at the dark starry sky. Even nights in Venice were too hot in Draco's opinion, though Harry rather liked it.
"I saw you. Through his eyes. I saw what he made you do and I saw how terrified and helpless you were. You had no choice in all this fucking shit so I wanted to give you one. That's why I asked Snape to take you out of there."
Draco opened his eyes (when did he close them?) and looked at him nervously but Harry seemed to be still asleep and Severus was already muttering some spells again.
He heard Harry calling his name and then three pairs of footsteps were following him up the stairs on the second floor and into the first room to the right.
Draco heard Harry unzipping his trousers and felt himself starting to tremble.
"I suppose," Harry snorted still looking around. "I don't really know when exactly Walburga died but I think this house was uninhabited for about ten years. You should've seen the state it was in, when– Er, two years ago."
Harry just laughed and hugged Draco closer to himself.
"Do you want some help?" Harry asked unexpectedly.
They moved to one of the couches in the far corner of the room and were half-lying there and talking about everything. And it was so easy, Draco had never felt so comfortable with anyone before, even with Pansy, really. And he'd known Harry for how long? Three hours?
Harry indeed was older than Draco, he was 24, but would turn 25 the next month. Draco found it thrilling and already was imagining himself talking about his
"Would you two stop snogging? I'm starving here!" Weasley said loudly enough for Granger to look up from two books in front of her.
Draco didn't come while Harry was sucking and biting the skin of the inner sides of his thighs, though all Draco's body was trembling uncontrollably. Draco didn't come when Harry started licking around his hole, though he was a sobbing incoherent mess by that time. Draco didn't come when Harry started fucking him with his tongue, though his throat was already hurting from moaning and crying out loud.
"It was about fifteen minutes between Nagini's attack and our appearance here," Weasley answered to him. He stood at the end of the bed clutching the footboard with white knuckles.
"Hermione, why are you listening to him?" the Weasel yelled grabbing Granger's hand when she was about to cast a spell.
shouting and several people were already watching them.
"Are you really going to let these pathetic nitwits turn your nice pub into ruins?" Blaise asked, raising his eyebrow at the slightly confused expression on Harry’s face.
"What do you want to hear?" Potter finally said after a couple of minutes of a heavy silence.
The trio in front of him stared at him with wide eyes and dropped jaws.
"Harry, I'm not sure– Wouldn't it be better to actually talk alone about it first?" Granger was looking in Harry's eyes intently.
"And you must be Harry," she smiled at Harry too and Draco watched his boyfriend kissing his mother's hand and for whatever reason felt himself the happiest person in the world.
"I love stars," Draco said to him quietly. "Mother used to tell me a lot about them when I was little."
All he knew was Harry. Harry's warm and gentle lips, tenderly caressing Draco's own for long sweet torturous minutes. Harry's hot tongue sliding along Draco's lower lip. Harry's whisper "Open your mouth, Draco". Then the feel of Harry's tongue against his.
Draco's phone rang loudly right at that moment. He took it from his pocket and laid it on the coffee table in front of them when he saw who was calling.
"You are not going there, Potter."
"And by 'he' you mean...?" Severus raised an eyebrow.
"Yeah," Potter smiled shyly. "I've remembered you used to like it back at Hogwarts."
"Harry," they heard Granger's worried voice. "Harry, what's going on?"
"Fuck!" Draco cried out in frustration.
Draco came up to them wearing just his boxers and Harry's big t-shirt, so all his love bites – on his neck and collarbones as well as on his thighs – were on full display. He noticed Hermione glancing at them and blushing slightly.
"Oh, shut up, Weasley," Harry rolled his eyes, grinning, and stood up too, so he could walk his friend to the front door.
"Malfoy, why are you here?" Weasley asked when Kreacher disappeared with a crack.
"I take it you managed to escape?" Severus asked in a very soft voice which was very unusual for him. Draco turned to look at him; he was watching Potter very intently too.
He didn't see Harry come in and jumped up a little by surprise when he felt strong arms circling his waist. Harry was smiling at him at the mirror and Draco knew that he was quite nervous too, but tried to look calm for Draco's sake.
"Are you alright?" Harry moved closer, putting his hands on Draco’s shoulders.
"Come all over my face, Harry," Draco didn't know how a thought
Yes, with his exams finished a couple of weeks ago, they had much more time to spend together and Draco practically was living in Harry's flat by now.
"We'll talk later, guys, I need to go to Snape," Harry said standing up from the table. "You'll be in your room?" he asked turning to Draco and brushing Draco's hair from the side of his face.
Loud snoring belonged to Weasley who was sprawled in Severus' armchair near the window.
"Why are you wearing Harry's clothes, Malfoy?" Weasley started again. He had an idiotically perfect ability to ask the most stupid questions.
"But why was he trying to convince us that Malfoy is a Death Eater if he had relationship with him? It's illogical!"
"Lay him on the bed," Draco said hurriedly and moved out of the Weasley's way who obeyed him, probably too scared to realize who he was listening to. "Kreacher!" Draco looked at the elf who was still standing in the middle of the room. "Bring essences of Dittany and Murtlap, Blood-Replenishing and Pain-Relieving potions from my lab." Elf didn't move. "Now!" Draco shouted at him.
Everyone laughed and started shouting something, but it wasn't really easy to understand, not that Draco was trying to, anyway. Harry was laughing too, but then he leaned his forehead against Draco's and tightened his arm around Draco's waist.
"So may I ask something?" Draco said after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
Finally, Harry kissed him, hard and demanding, and it was so perfect, Draco was on the edge again. The feeling of complete surrender and the knowledge that he was absolutely at Harry's mercy were slowly driving him mad with need, desire and arousal.
Draco was sure he was blushing furiously so he didn't even try to glare at the Weasel like he very much wanted to; he just pressed his face into Harry's chest and wished for his friends to disappear, forever if possible.
"Go to the bathroom, heal and clean yourself. Do you have all the necessary potions, 'Mione?" Granger nodded. "Are you okay with sleeping on that bed for now?" Harry gestured to the bed at the opposite wall with his head. "I'm not sure any other room is clean enough for living, but I can ask Kre–"
Kreacher appeared in the late morning after that fantastic night when nobody was really waiting for him to.
"I'll go. But don't expect me to be polite to these idiotic excuses of human beings you're calling your friends."
The woman started shrieking even more hysterically when she spotted Potter, who walked across the hall and irritably shut down portrait curtains, silencing her.
Luna had been with them for half an hour maybe, then she said that she was tired and her parents were waiting for her at home.
"I really need to talk to Snape first," he muttered.
There were gagging sounds from the direction of the group of Draco's classmates, and he was sure it was Theo, so he flipped him off without looking and Harry laughed again and kissed his cheeks.
"Seriously?" Harry pulled away again to stare at him with clear surprise in his beautiful green eyes. "Seriously? I– But you're so fucking gorgeous, Draco! You– you're– Really?"
"You can go, I think," Draco told him and crouched down to take his brush from the floor.
Though he didn't say anything to Harry, Draco didn't like Regulus' old room from the very first sight. It was large and green and Slytherin from floor to ceiling. It wasn't a bad thing. But it was too much like Draco's bedroom back at the Manor, and it immediately made him feel sick and he remembered a lot of things he wanted to forget.
Once they were up, Potter started making a fuss of spreading a blanket under the shadow of the big tree while Draco stood near the edge of a bank and watched the forest and hills in front of him. He had never thought he could appreciate the beauty of wild nature, but after a month and a week in a dark and dusty creepy house, he really found the view appealing enough.
It was hard to convince Potter that Black's death wasn't his fault and Draco wasn't sure he really succeeded in this.
"Harry, why didn't you tell anything?" Granger continued her interrogation, looming above them. "This is serious, Harry. There was a reason Professor Dumbledore wanted you to learn how to block th–"
"Say bye to your friends and go sit behind me, baby," Harry whispered into Draco's ear, after kissing behind it.
Millie, Theo and some of others were openly laughing and Draco walked a little further from them.
"I love my Godfather," Draco said smiling into Harry's neck. Severus was a fucking genius! He managed to help Harry right in front of Dark Lord's eyes! Literally. "When do you think I should cast these spells on you?" he asked looking up at Harry.
tongue in Draco's mouth and
"It's Black," he announced looking at the three Gryffindors who were staring at him in confusion. "The locket is Black family's heirloom, and this your R.A.B. might be some Black as well," he explained and smirked proud of himself.
"Calm down, Ron," Harry interrupted him. "There are enough bathrooms for everyone in this house," he said calmly and gave Draco his cup when he came to him.
Thank you for reading and sorry for any mistakes ❤
"I really need to go now," he said when Potter looked at him. "Thank you for breakfast, Potter, and– thank you," Draco smiled at him feeling nervous and awkward again.
"You know very well that I don't have any friends, Potter," Draco snapped at him absolutely unnecessary.
"Sometimes you talk too much, Potter," Draco said smirking at him. "And I'm okay with the new room."
Draco just stood in a complete shock near the kitchen door and was gaping at his Godfather who was visibly annoyed with Draco's presence.
"Of course I'm not joking," Harry was saying. "You’re Draco's friends and you need a place to celebrate a very important event. You’ill just need to pay for the drinks, and I can give you a discount for that," he smiled at them. "And yeah, I'll close the pub for tomorrow night. When were you planning to start? Eight? Nine?"
"I don't have all day," Draco's Godfather growled impatiently.
Draco walked to the table and sat down next to Potter, reasoning that if Potter was an actual owner of this dark creepy house, it'd be rude to reject his invitation.
"From torturing you."
"I did." Severus said quietly.
"Still..." Draco didn't know what else he could say and he suddenly felt very awkward. He looked at Potter.
"Happy birthday, darling," he whispered against Harry's lips before kissing him gently.
Draco read what happened to be an address and then watched how an old massive gloomy house was slowly appearing between two muggle ones.
"Draco, aren't you going to try, at least?" Harry asked, turning to him again.
Now when he knew it he wanted it to last as long as possible and he still couldn't fully realize that all of this was really happening to him.
"And this mistake is not becoming a Death Eater as you might have thought," Severus added in a sad quiet voice, staring at the floor unblinkingly.
"Are you hungry, Malfoy?" Potter asked frowning.
At the end, they went out to the bar at around nine o’clock, but fortunately almost everything was't closing till midnight or even longer. They chose the one that called
"I've never done anything with anyone before you," he whispered, hiding his face in Harry's neck. "Not even– no cuddling, no actual touching, no kisses of course, and obviously nothing more..."
"Are you trying to say that I am not?!"
– room and read a book which he wisely took from home with him. It was a romance novel that Pansy gave him in the end of their school year, and reading it had helped him to keep his thoughts away for a while.
Harry leaned down to kiss his lips softly, then told him to close his eyes. Draco caught a glimpse of a dark-green blindfold which Harry bought for him a couple of weeks ago, and he knew what was coming, so he obeyed eagerly.
Harry didn't say anything else, and was just holding Draco close to himself with his nose buried in Draco's fair hair.
"You know what I mean, Harry," Draco said, tightening his hands around Harry’s neck and his legs around Harry’s hips, when Harry wanted to turn away from him. "Severus' news were good, I guess? So now will you tell me what all that was about?"
Oh! He must not forget to pack Harry's birthday present too! He spent a good amount of time thinking about it, and a rather good amount of money buying it a few days ago – Harry wasn't the only one in this relationship who was rich, okay.
He looked up at him when Harry growled again, and felt the first spray of hot come hitting his cheek. He opened his mouth and the next spray hit him across his lower lip and his chin. He licked it, looking right into Harry's beautiful eyes, then looked down at Harry's still pulsing cock and took the head in his mouth, sucking on it lightly.
"I asked you a question, Malfoy," apparently Weasley wasn't the one with the patience. Not that this was news for Draco, he just hoped Harry's friends were exhausted enough to leave him alone.
Ron, unlike Hermione, was very funny and really easy to get along with. He was also Ginny's brother, who not long ago became Pansy's official girlfriend, so somehow Draco considered them both as a family, sort of.
"I did not have time and I was busy with Draco."
Potter gave it to him when they were meeting the third time for Draco's breakfast in the woods. That day was a little cold and rainy, so Potter being Potter pulled his ridiculous sweater off the moment he saw Draco shivered at the wind. He didn't ask to give it back and Draco was more than happy about it.
"Severus, what were you saying about Dark Lord's transparent actions?" Draco decided to speak.
Draco was so overwhelmed with his feelings and emotions, he was able to finally fall asleep much later after Harry's hand in his hair stilled and Harry's snores filled the room.
Draco was breathing heavily and looking between Harry and Severus with challenge and determination in his gaze.
"Potter, you're an idiot."
"Yes. So you'll tell them?"
He looked up again and forgot how to breathe. The man was looking directly at his face and only now did Draco see his eyes. They were so fucking green and enchanting and so easy to get lost in, it was all Draco could do to reply.
Harry leaned back a little and took Draco's face in his hands, watching him closely. He gently brushed Draco's hair back and Draco smiled at him.
"Well, you don't know a lot of things about me, Malfoy," Harry drawled, clearly trying to imitate Draco's voice.
Draco, who started to turn, froze in the place on the sound of this voice; his heart began to beat faster and an odd mixed feeling of fear, relief and excitement ran through him.
Harry suddenly laughed and Draco frowned at him.
"I think it's better for Kreacher to be here all the time," he said in a serious tone.
To his own surprise Draco had told Potter a lot about himself, about his childhood and even his parents.
Draco moaned and nodded a few times, barely conscious from the excitement and all the sensations.
"There are Pain-Relieving Potions in the last cabinet, Severus sent a Patronus–" Draco fell silent when he remembered words Potter was saying before he started screaming. He said 'he knows'. How was Potter aware of it even before Severus knew? And why in hell was he screaming so hard?
"Hey, are you okay?" Harry put both his arms around him.
Draco was already beyond the point when he was able to talk and even think properly. He was just staring at Harry helplessly with wide eyes and was trying not to get overwhelmed by all these sensations.
"Don't get angry again, but I wish you could tell me about this thing that driving you that mad," Draco said quietly. "I know you can't. I just want to be able to help you, want to be useful somehow."
"Don't say I do not trust you, 'Mione, you know perfectly well that it's not true," Harry interrupted her, leaning on her shoulder for support. "You're tired and exhausted and Malfoy's very good at Healing. It'll be alright, I promise," he tried to smile at her.
He tried to sit up in bed and saw Severus sitting in the big armchair in the middle of the room.
Potter also told Draco about his own childhood and life with his muggle relatives. Draco was shocked to learn that Potter didn't know anything about magic and didn't realize he was a wizard until he was eleven.
The next moment he became aware of the fact that Potter wasn't screaming anymore and glanced at his direction. Potter was trying to sit up while his stupid elf was standing next to him muttering something again. But Potter waved him away, his green eyes running over the kitchen.
It was when his mum asked how they had met, when the awkward tension was back, after Draco mentioned the name of Harry's pub. He had no idea what all of that meant, and it made him felt rather uncomfortable, so he hurried to change the subject and told his parents about their trip to Venice.
"What?" he snapped at the elf.
"This is good."
"Enough, Ron!" Granger interrupted loudly. She laid her fork near her plate at looked at Draco thoroughly.
Seriously, what in hell could be in common between a boring and nerdy bookworm (Hermione), a dorky football fan (Ron), a shy and awkward biology teacher (Neville), a computer games lover (Seamus), and a very talented artist, who managed to impregnate his girlfriend, so was in need of some regular job (Dean, the bartender)?
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had never seen so much strong emotions on his Godfather's always impassive face. There was mostly shock, but Draco also could see some kind of sadness and even anger in the man's eyes. He didn't understand what was wrong with this situation, but he really did like Potter's attention and he really got used to exchanging notes with him, not that he would ever admit it out loud to anyone, especially not to Severus with his odd reactions on all Potter-related conversations.
"Pansy?" Harry asked and Draco looked at him again. "Like Pansy Parkinson?"
"I'm fine."
"New room for me?" Draco looked up at him confused.
But Harry was laughing, actually laughing, throwing his head back and putting an arm over his eyes while his other hand continued squeezing Draco's thigh. And Draco couldn't help himself, he smiled. Because it was impossible to look at Harry and didn't smile.
Draco was wondering what Potter wanted him to show so badly that he made Draco got off the bad at fucking 6 in the morning. Maybe it was some rare plant? Then it might be really interesting.
"I'm sorry," he mumbled weakly.
Harry turned him around and then Harry's lips were on his and he felt like he was losing his mind; Harry's kisses were overwhelmingly hot and passionate. Harry's hands were hot too and also very impatient, squeezing Draco's hips and pressing them to his, palming Draco's ass, stroking Draco's sides, cupping the back of Draco's head and tugging on his hair.
"Do you want me to...?" He didn't really have the energy for that, but he'd manage if Harry wanted him to.
Draco went to sit in front of Weasley who glanced at him with annoyance, muttering something about disgusting behavior and suffering from it.
, I think you are very aware of it. And Narcissa refused to leave your father, so they both stay–"
Draco hadn't even noticed for a while that one of his hands was in Harry's hair, tugging on them and making them messier than they had already been.
"Are you feeling any better, Potter? Is it still burning?" he asked, frowning on the diagram above the bed.
"So, I see you liked my idea?" Potter grinned.
"Was it that bad?" Harry smiled at him sadly.
Millie leaned her head on his shoulder to look at the screen and giggled when she saw the black-and-white picture of a shirtless smiling Harry with three emoji-hearts on top of the screen instead of the name.
"Really?" Potter grinned at him managing to look stupid and adorable at the same time.
"Language, Draco," Severus glared at him. "How long has this been going on?"
They just looked at each other for a few seconds before Draco swallowed nervously and awkwardly cleared his throat.
"No, but–"
He heard his mother started talking about the Marciana Library in Venice, trying to change the subject and erase the tension again, and he smiled gratefully at her, while squeezing Harry's hand.
Draco knew he was trembling – from pain, from fear, from shock – but he couldn't help himself and tried to force back his tears and tried to find his voice to ask Kreacher to get Severus.
"And what are they thinking about you making a chocolate pudding and disappearing with it into the woods before dawn?" Draco had never asked Potter what explanations he gave to his friends, but it didn't mean he wasn't interested to know this.
"He did," Harry grinned. "I might have said something like 'hey loser, I'm still not dead'."
"Ask what, babe?" Harry smiled at him and put his arm around Draco's hips, drawing him closer to himself.
He spent a few hours working on his potions, even had Kreacher coming to him with a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits. The elf happily informed him that his Master told him that "from now he may listen to young Master Black's orders, but still not letting him out of the house, Kreacher is very sorry but Kreacher wants young Master Black to be safe too".
"Change a towel, Kreacher, quickly! Make water as cold as possible!" Draco heard Potter's voice. He felt small elf's hands on his own hand, and then a feeling of a frosty towel on his Mark made the pain go away a little.
Draco suddenly realized that he needed to tell his parents that he would be out of the country, but he still hadn't really told them about Harry.
Though it was really hard, Draco was finally able to collect himself too and quickly stood up next to Potter, drawing his own wand from his sleeve and looking around nervously.
"Has someone ever told you, that you're cute when you're pouting?" Potter looked at him still smiling.
"Were you somewhere near the Ministry or did it happen on the wedding?" he heard Severus asked Potter and look at them in time to see his Godfather gently wiping away traces of blood from Potter's neck and shoulder with some wet cloth.
Harry told him to climb off the bike, then helped him to take off the helmet. Draco hurriedly ran his hands through his hair to make sure it was alright. Yes, he wasn't a teenage girl, but it didn't mean that his hair shouldn't always look good.
Draco was slowly waking up to the sound of loud snoring and some grumbled muttering.
Draco jumped on the sound of the voice behind them and Potter turned around sharply aiming his wand and ready to shout the next spell, but then they both froze in shock.
"So, what do you say about having the most delicious birthday cake you've ever had?" Harry asked with a smile on his lips.
"Can I have my present right now?" Harry muttered, pressing Draco's body even closer to his own and kissing Draco's neck.
"Oh bloody hell, do I really need to hear this?" Weasley groaned from the other side of the room.
– bed, and walked to it to take some fresh shirt and trousers. He suddenly realized that he didn't take any pyjamas from home and wondered what in the name of Merlin he would be sleeping in.
"Are you sure you're doing it right, Malfoy?" Blaise shouted and everyone laughed.
"I do. I can see through his eyes."
Recently he was thinking of Harry's place as theirs more and more, and he didn't really know if Harry was actually ready to share his flat with someone, with Draco. They were dating just a little more than a month, but already most of Draco's things and clothes were here, he spent here almost every night, and Harry even bought some things especially for Draco (like a large fluffy comforter, because Draco was always cold; a little shelf for Draco's books, because Draco was studying for his exams here more than at home; a fucking coffee-machine even, because Draco drank loads of coffee while Harry was absolutely a tea person), so Draco liked to think that maybe Harry liked having him here. But still, wasn't it all too fast?
"Be patient a little, Malfoy," Potter said squeezing Draco's hand and turning to look at him, smiling. "And why is this hill idiotic? I think it's rather nice, actually."
Granger and Weasley started talking to each other the moment Draco stepped out of the room.
"Yes!" Granger screeched. "Where might it be now?" she asked in her normal voice again, frowning on the floor.
"Will you come again soon?" Draco's mouth said before he could stop the words.
Draco fell on his knees too, and gritted his teeth trying to stop himself from screaming out loud, but he wasn't able to stop some tears falling down his cheeks.
"Um, what is 'pepperoni'?" the name sounded interesting.
"Stop calling him bloody 'Draco', for fuck's sake!" Draco startled at the shouting in Weasel's voice. "Do you even realize how fucking creepy you're sounding?"
Surprisingly, Draco liked her a lot, she was very funny and smart, and her weird behavior was actually kind of cute. He learned that she was like a little sister to Harry, and they knew each other their whole lives; apparently their mothers were best friends or something like that.
"I don't understand you," Draco said watching the side of Potter's face. "You're helping me, hiding me in your home and don't throw me out, you're making your elf cook for me, you're talking to me like you don't hate me, you're showing me something I might like. You even made sandwiches for me last night! It's almost– It's like you care... about– about me..."
"But it's insane, Harry!" she exclaimed while Draco was making himself comfortable on Harry's lap. "We can't close the bar on Saturday night, we will lose too much money!"
"Kreacher! Kreacher, where are you hiding peppermint leaves, you evil creature?" Potter was rummaging through the kitchen cabinets frustratedly. "Why the fuck everything is in the fucking disorder?" he muttered to himself.
"Because the Master of this elf gave it an order to obey me, obviously."
Somehow, it happened that he and Harry didn't really talk about their families. But Draco thought that introduction was in order now, but he had no idea how to tell it to Harry and if Harry even would be okay with it.
"So I want to tell Draco," Harry repeated himself after a few moments of intense silence.
"No, it's okay," Draco said to him, but Potter closed his eyes and turned away.
Then he took out his wand and Draco closed his eyes and prepared for the worst. But all he heard in a few moments was a soft murmur: "To Hermione Granger. How can I find you?"
"Of course I love you, baby," Harry said softly, smiling and hugging Draco close. "Were you doubting it?" he asked, brushing Draco's hair from his forehead.
Harry sounded surprised but also very excited.
"I don't know," Draco said into Harry's chest.
Then he went back to his room and was reading a book about Ancient Runes and their role in some blood rituals, when Severus appeared in the doorway a few hours later.
They just climbed up the stairs and Draco was about to knock, when the door opened and his mother was standing in front of them, smiling brightly.
"Ask Hermione to bring me some food please, if you'd suddenly decide she's worth enough for you to talk to," Potter said him coolly and Draco already regretted a little the way he talked about Harry's friends. But just a little.
After a few moments Harry opened his eyes and stared at the selling unfocussed. Draco watched how Severus was helping him to sit up and drink the antidote.
Severus ignored him, but Potter opened his enormously green eyes and stared at him. Draco tried to look away but Severus' hands found their way into Potter's black hair and were running through them carefully tilting Potter's head to the side for a better access to his injury.
He stepped back to Harry and looked up at him in defeat.
"HARRY JAMES POTTER, WHERE IN THE MERLIN'S NAME ARE YOU? ANSWER ME RIGHT THIS INSTANT!" They both jumped of the sound of Granger's loud and frightening voice, coming from her small silver otter.
"W-what?" Harry stared at him with wide eyes, gripping the base of his cock tightly.
"You're so fucking hot, baby," Harry growled into his ear, brushing his fingers over Draco's prostate. "I haven't fucked you for three days but you're so fucking tight already. Do you know how much I love this perfect tight arse of yours, Draco?"
And Harry was just perfect himself, much more perfect than Draco had ever imagined him to be, and he had imagined a lot. He just never really believed he would have a chance to know what it's like to be with Harry that close.
"I can't control myself any longer," he said hoarsely, lifting Draco's legs, nearly bending him a half, and starting fucking him hard and fast.
When Draco opened his eyes it took him a few moments to remember what had happened and where he was. He lifted his left hand and saw that his Mark was covered with some sort of a cloth soaked in a strong-smelling orange salve. He didn't feel the burning anymore, but he thought he still could feel small echoes of a previous pain.
"Behave yourself," Harry growled when Draco tried to hook one of his legs over Harry's waist, and Draco immediately stilled.
"You are right in much more ways than you can imagine yourself, Draco," Severus' voice was low and so full of emotions, it made Draco shiver. He closed his eyes and tried not to think about this, it was too terrifying.
Harry took the book from him and looked through it briefly then laid it away and turned to Draco again.
Draco just scowled at him and sat in one of the chairs. A moment later a plate with French omelet with melted cheese appeared on the table in front of him.
They were silent for a few minutes. Draco still couldn't understand Potter and his motives and still couldn't believe that it was not his mother's or Severus' but bloody Potter's
"Kreacher can feel his Master is near, but Kreacher can't see or hear him and young Master Black, because Master's magic is very strong and protects young Master Black very well..."
Draco was still a little in shock of his –
"Is young Master Black wanting something?" Kreacher appeared next to him. "Kreacher made a kidney pie with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables."
He started to regret he had said something at all, but for some odd reasons, when Severus thought berries were Kreacher's thing, Draco immediately wanted him to know that it was actually Potter who was 'spoiling him almost as bad as his mother'.
Draco apparently looked disgusted and miserable enough for Harry to take pity of him, and he wandlessly
"I know, Harry," Draco's Godfather said softly and so unusually gently, it made even Draco as well as Granger and Weasley stared at the man in shock. "I'm afraid it will be going like this for a while."
To be honest, Draco had expected Potter to look like some kind of vagrant, but his clothes and hair were surprisingly fresh and clean, his trainers were worn more than a little, but generally he looked like himself except for a not so light stubble on his face.
"So how do you know about these rumors then?"
"Don't you think we should not talk about it when we are not the only people in the room, Potter?"
"–and making young Master Black so happy!" Kreacher paid no attention to his Master's words and was looking very happy himself. "Do Masters want a cake for the dinner? Kreacher can bake very good chocolate cakes, Master Regulus did like them a lot."
Draco leaned on the wall near the door, trying to calm himself and not to dive into panic in front of Granger of all people.
"Not much," he answered still not looking at Draco.
One of Harry's hands was around Draco's waist, holding him close, and the other was on Draco's thigh, holding his leg, while Harry was thrusting into him, bringing their hard cocks together with every thrust and making Draco moan so loud that he was sure even bloody Death Eaters in the square could hear him if it wasn't for Fidelius Charms on the house.
"I asked Kreacher to make this tray for you," he was unable to not to point that out. Harry smiled at him warmly and Draco sat on the edge of his bed forgetting all about his irritation.
He smiled and looked up at Harry again, and Harry was grinning happily at him too, squeezing Draco's fingers and rubbing his thumb over Draco's knuckles.
"Severus," Harry said very softly and Severus' eyes were immediately on him, Draco watched in amused shock how his Godfather's cheeks became a light shade of pink. "Is Draco talking about what I think he is talking?" Harry asked with something that Draco thought was hope in his voice.
Draco didn't know what to say and they fell silent watching the river valley in front of them. It was awfully nice and comfortable to sit here with Potter on some hill in the middle of nowhere, inhaling fresh air and Potter's scent, feeling warm and safe from his touch.
“I already gave up on earning money for today, so I can take you two for the half-price,” Hannah added.
"No, no, it's not burning, Potter," Draco interrupted him. "I've just realized that I'm not under protection of your house here, and if– and he can find me here... I– I think I just got scared."
Draco walked to the far wall of the kitchen where was a door leading to the small dark hall with a few rooms – one of which was his potions lab – and a staircase to the cellars.
"She is not. And you better don't know anything about her whereabouts as well as she won't know anything about yours. It will be more save for both of you."
"I– I just– I didn't know," Draco couldn't take his eyes off Harry who was smiling at him brightly and looking absolutely gorgeous in Italian moonlight.
Draco blushed and looked away with embarrassment.
Draco nodded.
"But I want to touch you, Harry," he then blurted out rather suddenly even for himself.
Harry stilled for a moment.
Both of them knew very little of Italian, but fortunately almost everyone did understand and speak English well enough, and if they didn't, Draco suspected they did it on purpose – like a fish seller at the market near their apartment, who was chattering insistently in Italian, until Harry handed him 30 euros for some fresh fish, which they had grilled later for their first Italy dinner.
"Maybe it'd be nice if there weren’t such a lot of stupid pebbles under my feet and if it wasn't bloody six in the morning."
"Severus, what–" Draco began.
Also it was quite a surprise for Draco, who never liked being around people more than it was absolutely necessary, that he didn't mind loud Italians and the noisy tourists groups that were everywhere around the city. He was just enjoying being here with Harry too much to care about them.
Harry didn't answer, he just wrapped his perfect lips around the head of Draco's cock. Draco cried out loudly and buried his hands in Harry's hair.
"Yeah, Luna, this is Draco," Harry said, blushing a little. He laid his big hand on Draco's lower back and drew him a little closer. "It's Draco's birthday today and he hasn't had his birthday cake yet!"
"You went to Godrik's Hollow, didn't you?" Draco asked.
"What?" Draco repeated himself. "You– you cooked it? But– How?"
Draco looked up at Potter who waved his wand and a tray with sugar and milk on it appeared on the table.
"Better than being alone here," Potter told him and looked back at Severus. "How's your research?" he asked him.
The first thing he saw was sleeping Granger half-sitting on the bed and half-laying on top of Harry. Harry's chest and Draco's hand were covered in Granger's curly bushy hair. Draco noticed the wet spot on the pillow near her face, seemed like she was crying a lot before finally falling asleep.
It was just a portrait on the wall; a portrait of a tall and dark haired woman who Draco mentally associated with some weird combination of Minerva McGonagall and Bellatrix Lestrange.
"The locket, Ron," Harry cried out too, eyes wide. "You're great too, 'Mione," they were staring at each other, clasping each other's hands.
They almost didn’t go anywhere, because for the next hour or so Harry was stressing out about the fact that Draco spent so much money for him, while Harry gave Draco nothing on Draco’s birthday – and that was the most ridiculous lie Draco had ever heard. Then he couldn’t stop kissing Draco, then stressing out again, then more kissing, then video chat with Ron to show him off Draco’s incredible present. Ron, to Draco’s great amusement, literally choked on his chicken sandwich, and ended the call when Harry started kissing Draco again while Ron was trying to stop coughing.
They were walking a lot, Potter called it 'hiking' or something like that and laughed every time Draco was complaining he had never walked so much in his life.
"Language, Potter!"
"How are you going to explain them everything?" Severus asked him slowly and quietly and Draco knew he was angry and irritated too. "How do you think they will be reacting on Draco, on me? Do you really think they will believe you? Will believe me or Draco?"
Draco and Weasley sat in silence for several long awkward minutes staring in opposite directions.
"Potter, it's half past nine," Draco interrupted him. "I had my dinner before your pompous appearance."
Draco couldn't stop hot tears from falling down his cheeks when Harry told him about the ring and the real reason Dumbledore was dying and about what they did that night before they showed up on the top of the Astronomy Tower. All Draco's body tensed and froze and he wished to disappear when he realized that Harry was there, on that bloody Tower, under his Cloak all along.
"Ask him something only he knows."
Draco started laughing a little hysterically while Kreacher continued his mumbling and Potter muttered counter-spells for his own protective charms he had placed around them.
"Kreacher is very sorry to interrupt, but Kreacher is so happy to see his Half-blood Master finally finding his courage and–"
"Who? Your older boyfriend?" Liza, the girl with pink hair came up to them, sitting on Millie's lap. She was a little bit boring in Draco's opinion, but she was Millie's best friend, so sometimes they hung out together.
He was vaguely aware of Harry rutting against his hip, kissing his face and whispering something in his ear.
"The last I remember he was there and he was helping me," he mumbled trying not to sound so embarrassed.
Draco stopped Harry's nervous rambling by flinging himself across the table and kissing Harry hard in the lips.
Draco himself was shaking uncontrollably and did his best not to dive into panic that was rising inside of him. He ignored everyone in the room and concentrated on Harry.
Draco didn't know why he was crying like this. He knew he was scared for Harry, really scared. And it seemed like it was the first time he actually realized it, and it scared him too.
Draco stood up from the bed the moment he saw Harry and realized how weakened he actually was. But Weasley was faster and when Harry finished talking he was in Weasley's arms already and was dragged by the redhead to the bed. Draco stepped aside and noticed that sheets on his bed were clean from Harry's blood and wondered how Kreacher had managed to change them so fast.
"He needs Severus," he whispered.
Well, his mother knew that he was dating someone and Draco thought his father suspected that too. And he never told them, but he thought they both were well aware that it wasn't a girl.
"Well, well, isn't that my dear son," Draco heard his father's voice. "It is very nice of you to finally remember of our existence after two weeks of complete absence, Draco."
"What?" Draco stared up at him with wide eyes. He didn't really think about it this way.
Draco had already forgotten that Harry and Pansy knew each other. They weren't really friends, he thought, or Pansy would've mentioned Harry before.
"You're not alone here anymore, Malfoy," Weasley said glaring at him. "You can't just use a bathroom for a whole fucking hour in the morning!"
Harry did it again, harder this time, and Draco shut his eyes and felt his hands tighten in Harry's hair. When Harry did it the next time, Draco tried to cry out again, but Harry's lips were on his, and his moan of pure pleasure was swallowed by Harry's perfect mouth.
wordlessly summoned a plate with a fork and a knife from kitchen cabinets for him.
At that moment Draco's phone rang, and everyone stared at him while he was trying to get it out from his pocket.
Draco smiled and nodded to Harry and turned to Luna to say that candles would be too much, but Harry had already tossed her a box, saying "We'll be needing twenty one".
After eight days without someone to talk to, except for Kreacher and Potter's notes, Draco began to feel he's about to lose his mind. He became very aware of Death Eaters' presence in the square in front of the house, so he became afraid to look out of the windows. He jumped on every single sound and always leaved the doors open, so he could hear everything.
"Er– yeah, a little. Snape gave me a lot of lessons this summer, wandless magic was one of them. And I've been practicing by myself for a while too, it's actually not that hard."
Draco didn't like the sappy look on her idiotic face. He leaned more heavily into Harry's side, then decided it wasn't enough and sat on the edge of the bike's seat between Harry's spread legs. Harry immediately put his arms around Draco's torso and kissed Draco on the corner of his mouth. Of course Draco blushed. But he ignored that and leaned his head against Harry's shoulder, looking at Liza triumphantly, who quickly looked away and surprisingly was blushing too.
"I am very capable of being unnoticed without any useless cloaks, Potter," Severus sneered at him.  "And what does this have to do with your elf being here all the time?"
He liked Luna's small cafe too; it was a special place for them now and Harry made it a regular thing to take Draco there for a small romantic date at least once a week.
"Can I eat now?" Draco asked in a slight irritation.
Draco shrugged.
Draco didn't want to go anywhere, so they decided to stay in Luna's cafe a little longer.
Potter talked about Sirius Black a lot actually. Draco thought he had never talked about him with anyone since the man's death and he hoped Potter felt better now, finally allowing himself to let go a little.
There was another minute of silence and Draco thought that he got more questions than answers out of Severus' story. But he didn't dare to ask anything.
for this afternoon, so–”
"I need you to tell me what's going on."
Draco concentrated on his magic once more and cast a spell to stop the bleeding from Harry's neck, then he cast quick
"Carrows, both of them? Why?"
It was pure misery for Draco why Potter had helped him. As far as Draco knew Potter was very aware of Draco's task at Hogwarts and about Draco's weak actions and unsuccessful attempts to achieve this task.
Draco tensed and felt himself shivering like in the cold; he didn't know why the mention of his father caused such an idiotic reaction from him. He tugged at the sleeves of Potter's sweater he was still wearing and tried to control his breathing.
When Draco came back to his senses, the blindfold was off and his wrists were free, and Harry's arms were securely around him. And if this wasn't heaven, then he didn't know what else could be.
They all were silent for a few moments.
He blew out the candles when he saw that the cake was really starting to melt, and Harry cut him a huge piece of it while Luna was clapping enthusiastically.
Draco did a mistake looking up at him from his work, because he immediately blushed like a complete idiot he was, and Harry's smirk became playful and very beautiful smile.
Two seconds later Harry's head with that adorably messy hair appeared in a doorway. He grinned widely and stepped into the room looking around curiously.
"He's a bit dramatic sometimes, don't you think?" Potter asked looking at Draco with a nice smirk on his lips.
Severus handed him two phials next evening and fortunately didn't ask him any questions, but Draco was sure the man didn't believe him.
They hadn’t really planned something special for today (they hadn’t even chosen a specific restaurant for Harry’s birthday’s dinner), so when they left their apartment a little before noon, they just decided to walk to the opposite side of the center of the city and explore more.
Draco smirked and leaned back on the couch, watching Harry tucking himself away and zipping up his jeans.
"Calm down," Draco said to him quietly. "Kreacher, did something happen?" he asked the elf who looked unusually anxious.
"What do you mean?" Granger looked at him.
The rest of their evening went rather uneventful, except for the fact that Draco's mother embarrassed him by showing his childhood photos to Harry, while he was busy telling his father about his exams. But the photos made Harry laugh, so Draco let his mum get away with it.
"Why it is you and not me who thinks about my Mark and my protection?" Draco mused out loud staring at Potter in disbelief. "So you're saying you are concentrated on the Dark Lord's thoughts right now?"
"Nah, don't think I would do that even if I was some serial killer. You're too pretty, would be a shame," Harry winked at him and now Draco was glad that they were in the dark alley, because he was sure his face became redder, if it was even possible.
"I'm not leaving mother! Severus, you don't understand, he'll kill her!" he cried hysterically. He pulled his arm away, turned around and hurried back into his room, but Severus managed to hold him firmly by the wrist.
"Why on earth did you make him a breakfast?" Severus sounded very amused, and Draco couldn't understand why, it was just an elf's job after all.
He hesitated for a few moments before saying that the name of the person he was dating was Harry and he was a little older.
"Yeah, now I see it too. All these disappearances–"
"I assume Mister Potter is not in here right now," Draco heard the words and nearly collapsed with relief of the sound of Severus' voice. "Is Draco with him?"
eating our lunch, Ronald," Draco said smirking, watching Ron blushing and Harry laughing. "Or tell your friend not to engage in such activities when we're around other people," this time Harry blushed slightly while Ron was smiling at his plate.
Blaise raised an eyebrow.
Somehow, they ended up near Venice’s railway station – Santa Lucia.
Later, when Harry returned to the kitchen and they finished their lunch and snogged a little against the kitchen counter, Draco was gathering his thoughts to try to approach the subject while Harry was doing the dishes.
"Is everything alright?" Draco wasn't about to give up easily. "I saw the diagram, Harry is healthy and very much alive. But I also saw that some part of him, something in his core, was ruined by Nagini's venom somehow, but it's very strange, it didn't actually make him weaker or–"
But Kreacher was sent to search for the thief of the original locket and when Harry said he was going to cook something for them, Granger came up with idea of that muggle ready food.
"I think I'm alright, no pain and no burning. Why did Potter help me?" Draco asked thinking about how Potter managed to deal with his hysterical friends after staying here almost for three hours instead of a couple of minutes he had promised to them.
Potter dropped his backpack on the floor and fell on his knees beside it, grasping his forehead. "He knows," he whispered through gritted teeth and then he started to scream.
"It's not– I mean–" Draco cut himself off when a new wave of burning pain passed through his left forearm again. He gritted his teeth and closed his eyes trying not to scream.
"I have some news," Severus said after a couple of quiet minutes of drinking tea. Draco felt Potter straightened next to him. "Dark Lord decided to act rather transparently. He's growing up more and more frustrated without any opportunity to detect your location, Potter, over these two months. He hasn't talked to me a lot about his plans, but I know for sure that he called back Rowle with his group, who were on their watch at Godrik's Hollow. I don't know if Travers is back from where he's watching the Burrow, but as I can see it Macnair, Dolohov and Rouge are still here."
"Mother?" Draco blinked stupidly. "Will she go with us? And what about father? And will you finally tell me where are we going and why?"
Draco paused in texting his reply to his supposed best friend and looked up from his phone at the sound of a deep voice that was apparently addressing him and his breath hitched. The gorgeous man that he had noticed earlier near the bar was standing in front of him, smiling hesitantly. Draco had really no idea why a man with a face and body like that would ever be hesitant, surely he could get literally everything he'd ever want just with a smile and an eyebrow raise or something like that.
And then Draco jumped and nervously drew his wand out from his sleeve at the sound of the hysterical shrieks coming from the hall.
Potter rolled his eyes but didn't try to argue and stopped grinning, remaining silent.
"Of course not, Malfoy. I hate lying to them, but I care about you a lot, we've talked about this."
"How do you know what's going on? And you're talking about the Dark Lord, aren't you?"
"You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen, Draco," Harry whispered and pulled Draco's trousers and underwear down a bit at the same time.
"Choose the bed, you're better be lying," Potter said.
It was absolutely horrible watching Harry like this and being so helpless to do something to help him when his wand was in Granger's pocket and Weasley didn't let him even stand near Harry let alone trying to touch him.
When Harry finally seated himself on the chair beside Draco's, he winked at him playfully before he started eating, and Draco thought maybe they still were okay and Draco didn't ruin everything between them completely.
It was Ron, one of Harry's close friends, who invited himself in for a late Monday lunch at Harry's place and was now looking at them in mocking shock.
Potter wanted him to come to the forest? For a walk with him? Draco didn't understand what was going on, and it made him a little uncomfortable that Kreacher was still staring at him strangely.
2019/12/02
"It's nearly midnight and your birthday would be over soon, and unfortunately I don't have a present for you," Harry said, leaning closer to Draco. "But I really want to give you one."
She stopped abruptly and stared at him.
But now Draco was relaxed, sitting back in his chair, drinking pumpkin juice and listening to Harry talking to his friends about what they would be doing if the thief – Fletcher or something like that – had already sold the locket to someone.
He was wearing a black leather jacket over a plain white t-shirt that hugged his torso in all the right places; his dark blue jeans were tucked into black leather boots and were doing a great job showing off his muscular thighs (and the rest of his legs, as well as his ass, though unfortunately Draco couldn't see it properly right now). His jet black hair looked messy, like it had never seen a comb in its life, but somehow it made him look even sexier.
Draco noticed Hannah’s eyes widening in shock for a second, but there wasn’t any disgust on her face and she never stopped smiling. He looked up at Harry and nodded. Harry grinned at him and kissed the tip of his nose.
"I can't– Draco– Ron and Herm–" he grasped Draco's hand in his and was trying to sit up, but then froze when he saw his friends standing near the bed. "What's going on?" he half whispered.
"Did you know about the Ministry?"
"Harry," Draco whispered back, one of his hands was clutching Harry's shoulder near Nagini's bite and the other flew to cup the side of Harry's face.
"Well, that one that was part of me but was destroyed by Nagini's venom. Though Snape is still not sure, I think it's gone," he grinned again. "Sorry, Draco, I can't tell you much," he added a little sadly.
"Hey, Blaise," Harry grinned at him too and stood up from his bike a little to shake his outstretched hand.
Draco paused in his eating because it was hard to look at Potter when he was like this, so open and so handsome, smiling at Draco so... fondly.
"But even if he'd ever do that for real, you can always be a Black, you know," he said and Draco felt him smiling against his hair.
"I'm in Law School."
The three of them shared the cake and chatted idly while eating.
"This is the breakfast for young Master Black," the elf answered bowing to Draco and muttering something under his breath.
