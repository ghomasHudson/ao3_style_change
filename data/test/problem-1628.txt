Despite the chill, Harry still manages to sweat in his hero costume waiting out on the stoop after ringing the bell. He had debated with himself whether he should dress more conspicuously to avoid drawing attention to Finch-Fletchley, but then figured that would be pointless since any enemies Justin had would already know his easily-found address.
Alpha Bee grabs onto her shoulders and spins her to face him. “I know you’re upset, but you need to get a hold of yourself.”
“So, Blaise,” Voldemort starts, a chilling grin stretching his features. “The young villains have decided to send you along? Quite generous of them to give you another chance to redeem your disgraceful capture.”
“And did you catch any?” Hermione’s eyelids keep fluttering behind her mask like they want to remain closed. “Of the villains, I mean. They did end up running away.”
Groaning, Paper Dracon rolls over and struggles to his hands and knees. He goes to lift his mask up—probably to spit out whatever blood’s collected in his mouth—when his head suddenly whips around to face Harry. “Motherfucker.”
When they had finished, Narcissa looked at him from the corner of her eyes. “Do you plan to turn me into the Ministry for what I’ve done?”
“Ah, yes! In the basement. But they’re kept under lock and key, so I suggest grabbing the key-ring from the lowest drawer in the loo.”
“Ahah, ‘course not, silly Ronnie-bonnie.” She lets go of Harry to tap Ron’s nose and giggles when he goes red. “Next week. Big release. Been wanting it for ages.”
“Huh. What could my friends and I—or any of the other hostages—have that people like that would want?”
But Harry couldn’t just leave him out here to succumb to his wounds and still call himself a hero. Villain or not, pain-in-the-arse or not, Paper Dracon needs help.
Draco’s forte has always been making people cry, not getting them to stop. So, it’s a relief when Potter finally moves from his perch against the armchair to crouch down before Ms. Adams.
He jots that down. Then he rolls his quill back and forth between his forefinger and thumb, almost hating himself for what he has to ask next. “What can you... tell me about, well, about the attack itself?”
For the first time in their exchange, Draco appeared struck—his outer edges flickered and some of the light in his eyes faded.
“Ah.” He puts his teacup down and stares into it for a moment before looking up at Draco. “I’m afraid I was mistaken.”
Ron, being the best of mates, recognized a battle long lost with a sigh and an “I’ll handle the questions from here” when they handed over the evidence and a swarm of Aurors gathered around them. Grateful, Harry snuck away to the main atrium and Flooed over to Hermione. In another testament to Harry’s bonds with his friends, Hermione understood the slew of garbled words that rushed out of Harry, and, together, they Apparated to the Manor’s wrought gates.
They spend a half an hour more there while Mr. Park explains meeting his future date at a local bar, and, being a single, divorced parent, getting taken in by the person’s charm. Partway through, he takes the noodles off the stove and sets them aside for later but leaves the Kimchi-paste base still boiling away. He then goes on to tell Draco and Potter about how wonderful the date had been up to the point of the attack. While the vampire hadn’t gotten very far since a bystander had heard Mr. Park’s shouts and intervened, the attack followed the perp’s pattern of pinning the victim’s hands to a wall while going for the back of the neck.
The challenge hung there, Harry surprised Malfoy would make it so soon. Instead of taking the bait, Harry said, “And no more... unexpected visitors.”
Harry would feel the sting of the insults had Dracon’s laboured breathing not tipped Harry off to how much the Supervillain probably isn’t up to fighting right now. Instead, with more measured grace than Harry thought he’d have this close to an enemy, Harry says, “You’re going to tell me what you’re plotting with those hero identities.”
“Got scared—likely. ‘nd I get it—scary, goin’ ‘gainst someone who’s hurt you, someone who still could. Hap-pens sometimes. Figured th’news could use a pick-me-up—‘membered Ms. Wheeze-ley offered after Wheeze-el punched me, likely outta polite-ness.”
With a shake of his head, Potter takes several hesitant steps into the shop, the door creaking closed behind him. “But, it’s the dead of
This close, Harry can hear his ragged pants of breath, and he wonders what kind of torture Voldemort meant. But he can’t think on it. The more time he wastes, the more likely he is to be discovered by the wrong people and blow the whole operation. Plus, being in the same room with the evil robot invention sets his skin crawling.
“Been better.” Ron has a long cut on his back that seeps blood, and he appears scuffed in other places besides the hands and knees. “You?”
“Our understanding of vampires and vampire attacks—and what was considered the Old, Indisputable Knowledge on the subject—continues to evolve the longer our Department works on these cases. All it really took was looking at a different angle,” Draco says as Potter’s finger-tips touch the glass over his reflection’s chest. “Still you there, Potter. Still you.”
. What stands out the most are several of the Supervillains in the crowd. The more his eyes adjust, the more villains he can see, and the more he realizes that the heroes fighting are sorely outnumbered.
When they were alive, Lily and James Potter had been top tier Superheroes despite jumping into it later than most people who typically start in their mid-teens—at least according to their scant files in the Hero Order. Lily and James had started their hero careers when they were almost in their twenties and after they became a couple. As a result, they were able to design their hero aliases as a crime-fighting pair.
“You’ll have to go to the Coyle Ward. The area for trauma patients. That’s where they’d be after getting done at the Emergency Department.”
Closing his eyes, Harry hears a rustling noise, and then feels something being placed over his head.
Still uncertain as to how Dracon would react when he finally sees Harry, he decides to power down again so as to appear as innocuous as possible.
“No, I—” Both Harry and Draco gave startled cries as a blinding light emanated from Draco’s chest cavity. “What in Merlin’s name?”
, this should be of particular interest to you. You were the one involved with that kidnapping-turned-murder incident, correct?”
Part of its middle collapse in on itself in a soggy mess, and a section of the back of its head breaks off. As this occurs, the rest of the snake loses its green coloring, fading to an ashen color.
Even so, Harry does not quite know how to word his misgivings about law enforcement without starting down a different long discussion. Instead, Harry says, “Yeah, probably. But here’s the other part of the whole hero instinct thing. I mean, from the beginning, I guess I sensed something was off. And today, when I let him go on purpose, I think I finally know.”
Harry pulls back, rage concentrating sparks to his fingertips, even through gloves not made for him. “Will you quit whatever game you’re playing at? People are counting on me to come through with this, and you’re not helping!”
She shakes her head and continues, “It had seemed like a regular call. Some trouble with thieves down by the Wharf. When we arrived, C-Ced said the place was too quiet.” Thievery by the docks always sounds like a loud scuffle, Harry knows all too well. “But I just brushed it off. We were by the water, I had reasoned. My power had an advantage in that setting. So, we entered several dock sheds and warehouses until we found the right one."
As much as it’s sure to pain him, Harry powers up. He swallows down his agony and turns his head as much as he can until Paper Dracon is within his sights. “Then why didn’t you?”
Dracon snorts—and some of his cohorts join in, startling Harry who’d forgotten they were there. “Then I guess you c-can s-s-
Mad-Eye had been the only casualty in the battle, which in itself was some kind of miracle with how outnumbered the heroes had been. He had leapt in front of
“Hah! Not yet, you aren’t.” But neither would Harry if he didn’t spot the Silver Snitch soon, and the gauzy haze from running through the trees had not yet left his eyesight, causing everything to appear fuzzy at the edges. Or maybe he needed ghost glasses.
“My nephew did stay here while he attended school.” Her eyes haven’t lost their misty look. “I’m sure you could find something up in his room.”
“Hmm, well . . . . Its mast is made from some rare metal.” She thinks a moment. “Acromium, I believe.”
Excitement thrums in Harry’s veins as he dons Blaizing Fire’s costume once more. However, he hesitates before putting on the two masks and looks to the villain lying prone on the floor. Feeling determination drive him, Harry picks up the pen and notepaper. He scribbles out a note that reads
Staring down the fearsome beast, Voldemort whips out from the pocket of his black pantsuit a remote control. He fiddles with it a bit.
flings an open pair of scissors at them as they enter. They find two Members of Parliament and a guard there.
“Yeah, pretty neat, all things considered. Didn’t get a look at his face, though. He had another mask on beneath that one. Can you believe that?”
“Probably why he turned you down, then,” Hermione says. “You have to plan ahead for these types of things.”
Potter breathes in deep and shakes against Draco. His free hand fists the front of Draco’s robes. “I don’t—I don’t want to.”
When Potter’s turned head indicates that he’s looking at Draco, Draco motions at him to come closer. After a few seconds pass where Potter doesn’t, Draco sighs and shifts over several steps, leaving Potter enough room for him to step into the view of the peephole. Potter does so, gloved hands clasped out in front of him.
Delighted triumph floods Harry. He spins on his heel to go back the way he came and to try entering the fight still raging below.
He can hear Blaizing Fire pursuing them and knows exactly when Ron’s focus shifts. Seamlessly, Harry’s grip slides down Ron’s arm until they’re holding hands. He tries to focus on what lies in front of them and reaching Westminster Palace without running into more problems. After all, Ron’s counting on him to safely guide them through the crowd of people rushing the opposite direction while Ron focuses on deadening Blaizing Fire’s powers.
Since Harry has managed to identify most of the Supers on the battleground, that just leaves two conspicuous figures having at it on the last crumbling staircase. He leads Dracon towards the two people having the strangest battle—one keeps flopping to the ground or against the railing, while the other will occasionally claw at his own throat.
After spending some minutes regrouping, the three of them re-enter the building, searching all floors for people not yet evacuated. With Harry using his power to locate any sparks of life in the building, they find the remaining people relatively quickly. In the public tourist section, they find a roomful of people who had barricaded the door; they took some serious coaxing before believing it was safe to leave. Other than that, only two other people were found in their entire sweep of the Palace, all relatively unharmed.
“Cho?” Hermione taps a finger against her cheek. “Oh! Yes, I’ve read about you! Didn’t you disappear almost three years ago?”
“Okay.” He doesn’t remember any recent, open cases with a vampire not using hypnosis. Though, it’s not unheard of. He has dealt with his handful of sick fucks that forego that element altogether.
Now Ron’s snorting into his shoulder. “Okay, yeah, a Supervillain. But they’ve stripped him of his suit.” His mouth takes a serious turn. “Though, I suppose, depending on who it is . . . he may still be dangerous.”
“Yes, I know.” While Harry may be too out of sorts to know what’s going on, the crack in Dracon’s voice tells him it’s important. “I’ve fought you enough times to know. But like I said, that’s not what I aimed to imply.”
Four heroes break off from the group and pair off to heft Harry and Dracon to their feet. Their respective pairs lift Harry and Dracon’s arms across their backs.
“Ah, I do, do I?” Harry taps at his chin. “Then to repay her ladyship and her lovely comrades, please,” he ducks his head again, “allow me to walk you home.”
“You’re going to be like this the whole time, aren’t you?” Draco asked as they floated towards the Veil.
The kids visibly consider the offer before they all agree to it. On the walk home to their two houses, the children badger Harry about his most recent adventures, and Harry tells them about the old lady who misplaced her boat. (“How could she misplace a
Suddenly, Dracon’s arms wrap around Harry, and his chin rests where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder.
“Wait, I really did inspire you to become a hero?” Cho seems mystified. “I thought you’d just said that first time we met to make me feel welcomed back at the Order.”
“Thought I’d have removed it?” Dracon hums lightly under his breath. “I suppose that would have been the thing to do.”
Regardless, Harry can feel his suit beginning to give way under the barrage—not to mention the little bits scraping along inside his mouth.
Hermione sways excitedly, swinging her hands in front of her one minute, only to send them clasped behind her the next. “Oh, I’m so
He finds the two of them in the kitchen, chatting with Mrs. Weasley about the good news and what Molly plans to make in celebration. Greeting Mrs. Weasley, he makes some excuses to her before dragging Ron and Hermione to the basement.
“It’s fine. Harry and I’ve got this. You’ve waited all week, and probably longer, for this book,” Ron says.
At the sound of Harry’s wheezing breath and the tail end of his shout, Dracon turns around with his under-mask back in place. “Please! Can you save returning the gift until after I see you again? That way, whatever happens tomorrow, I’ll have something to look forward to.”
“How ‘bout we call it quits if we continue wandering around without finding anything after another half hour?”
“So,” Alpha Bee says, steepling his fingers below his chin, “would you care to tell us what your favorite brand of tea is?”
“No. Yes? Kind of.” Hermione sighs and pulls her hands from her face. “She lost her partner on a failed mission.”
The breeze turns sharp, and a drop of water splashes onto one of Harry’s eye lenses. Harry curses under his breath. He doesn’t have great control over his powers in the rain.
“But at what price,” Harry says before he can stop himself. Since he’s already put his foot into it, he decides to forge ahead. “We’re supposed to be heroes. And while I know there’s some grey area involved where we’ll harm criminals to protect the public or stop their crime, that grey area has to end somewhere before treading into bad territory.”
Molten lava moves through Draco’s veins and burns him from the inside out at the sensation of Potter’s hand wrapping around his wrist. Eyes probably fever-bright, Draco can’t help but to egg him on. “Come on, Potter. You’re going to have to try harder than that. I can have my wand in my other hand and you Petrified in a second.”
Harry winces when he thinks about Ron and Hermione, suddenly realizing the stress he must have put them under.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles for the eightieth time as well. He doesn’t move his gaze from the shadowed ceiling of the medical ward.
In the loo, they lock themselves in after checking that it’s empty. Then they strip off their outer clothes, consisting of jackets, jeans, and hoodies, revealing their Supersuits underneath—Ron’s orange and black spandex, and Harry’s red and gold.
“Izulu. A Superhero.” Harry taps at the mask where the nurse’s line of sight is. “Helped out those folks. Before the emergency vehicles arrived.”
Ron’s tackled to the ground, the monster bird’s beak lunging towards his face. He dodges and the creature bashes its paper beak into the cement, scrunching it up almost immediately.
“I’m fine walking to my own house!” Her finger jabs at his chest. “It’s only next door. I’m not that old yet.”
“Everybody wants something. Everybody’s after something. Everybody has a price. Even people like you.”
Harry finally brought his hands up before his face, his breath catching at the iridescence of his cerulean skin and the way it bled over into the silvery robes that now covered him. Wasting no more time, he jumped through the window, mildly surprised at the way the haze coating it tried to catch at him like an echo from true defenestration.
“Dunno,” Ron says. “But it’d be worth a shot, wouldn’t it? Rather than sit here arguing about what could have happened?”
“Do you want to come back to the observation room with me? You can . . . get used to being back while
After a while, the life residue started affecting Harry’s eyesight, and, by the retching coming from further ahead, it was affecting Draco in a similarly detrimental way. Fighting off the cloying sense of claustrophobia, Harry floated back above the trees again, trying to search out his prey.
“Draco,” Hermione returned. “You should probably back up. Just because you’re a ghost doesn’t mean you’ll be safe from crossfire-magic. You have enough problems to worry about already, yes?”
They must glance at it because it’s suddenly knocked from his fingers by the villain Harry does not know. “Bullshit you work here! You wouldn’t have tried to run from us if you did.”
Hermione’s tapping stops.  “There was another attack today. Though, it was outside the London area. Further up north.
Sighing, he tugs on his beard. “Yes, the more experienced heroes haven’t been in lately. But, really, it wouldn’t be right for me, or anyone else, to place the sole responsibility of learning the Villain Agency’s plans on the younger generation. And especially considering the heroes who had their true identities stolen by the Agency are most at risk, it’s only fair that they should receive the comfort of knowing the Hero Order is doing its best to thwart the plot by having those same heroes be the top officials working the case.
Regardless, Harry felt more than ready to leave once their main goal had been accomplished. However, a new alarming dilemma became apparent as Ron and Harry prepared to Disapparate.
A day before the court comes to a decision, Harry gets a knock on his bedroom door in the Weasley household.
Once he finishes showering, Harry puts his pajamas on, tosses his regular clothes into the hamper, and heads downstairs to the kitchen.
Hardly believing his luck, Harry falls into step with Dracon. Their walk is mostly silent, and Harry finds himself having to slow down a few times to keep pace with the villain’s limping speed.
. I know you have a good heart, but you need to know when best to listen to its whims. And while your theory may be interesting, I don’t see how it connects with your actions over these encounters.”
“Well, Mrs. Figg?” Harry asks, gripping her sleeve in case she falls over, “Would you have given your nephew the boat? If not to keep, maybe to use for a bit?”
“You had quite an unfriendly acquaintance with my son, but I suppose I can imagine the... effect finding him in such a state would have.” She stopped before him, the added thinness in her face accentuating the unpleasant scrunch of her nose. Or maybe she thought Harry smelt fouler than when they’d met before.
Boldly, Draco maintains what he suspects is eye contact. He really did do a good job on those shades.
“That’s an older villain, isn’t he?” Ron asks. “Sounds more likely that Paper Dracon was the accomplice in the situation.”
. Harry suspects the red tint to his eyes comes from permanent damage similar to the rest of his scars.
The long cut on his arm and the scratches from Vice-Net’s knives did sting severely; an indescribable ache creeps into Harry’s bones. He sits down on the cobblestone but refuses to acknowledge Hermione’s right. She knows she’s right regardless.
Mr. Park nods and wrings his hands until the kettle sounds off, making him jump again. As he serves them all tea, Mr. Park regains control of himself—so much so, that his hands don’t shake when he picks his teacup up from its saucer. He chose the seat directly across from Potter, leaving Draco off to his left across the table.
The two of them have a staring contest, and Draco breaks first. “The Kimchi paste. Garlic is a main component.”
Harry loves being a superhero. He enjoys saving people in wreckages, rescuing cats stuck in trees, and defeating evil. The joy on the faces of the people he helps are worth whatever comes beforehand, or even after. But as Big Ben chimes for nine o’clock, Harry can’t wait to head home.
He only wears his under-mask; the identification mask clearly having been stripped from him. Also stripped from him is his costume—swapped out for plain white clothes.
. However, he collects himself as best he can and does his best to assure her. Yes, the escape on the heroes’ end might be more difficult without their powers to help them, but the way Harry and the rest of the free Hero Order planned it out, the captured heroes wouldn’t necessarily need their powers to succeed.
The children spend the next ten minutes arguing who gets to have Harry on their team. Charlie Jenkins ends up settling the matter when he says that whoever has Harry on their team would be at an unfair advantage because Harry is a Superhero. The other three agree with him. So that’s how it ends up being a game of four against one.
“You’re saying that as if you haven’t been haunting Harry for months.” Ron crossed his arms. “Or as if we’re not going to get you some justice, despite you being a giant wanker.”
In the second it takes for Harry to be swarmed in white, he realizes he should have said something smarter, like
uncomfortable in the worst way imaginable. So... so now with this, I’m making myself uncomfortable in ways I can actually
He looks back to the forms in the distance and can make out Ron’s body lying atop his sister’s. Further away, Harry notes a black-clad figure that must be the villain they’d faced. Fire licks all around.
Harry taps his foot. He hadn’t exactly counted on law enforcement crawling around this place too. He’d figured they would've already finished investigating and gathering their evidence earlier in the day—preferably before anything could be messed with or knocked askew from the exposure to the elements.
Harry has to power down for the bats to be willing to touch him. He shouts back, “Paper Dracon helped me get out. We have to go back for him!”
“Well, yeah! People without powers do that job all the time. You’ll just have to put a little more dedication into it.” Harry grasps both of Justin’s shoulders and smiles. “Then you’ll be back at it in no time!”
Something twists in Harry’s gut, but he should have learned by now that distraction this close to an enemy is a deadly mistake. He’s not prepared for the flurry of little paper cranes Dracon sends his way, and Harry’s close enough that when they catch on fire, he still has to work to dodge the flames.
The three of them follow Alpha Bee to the chamber adjacent to the interrogation room. This room has a one-way stretch of glass, and they can see into the interrogation room where the prisoner sits immobile at a table.
“Yeah. I think I can handle it now.” He’s powered up, after all. And with that comes more energy in his limbs. Though, he’ll probably pay for it later once he powers down again and can’t move for a week and a half.
He is still contemplating an answer when his eyes, still adjusting, catch a flash of white as it leaves Dracon’s uncurling right hand. Harry has a moment to shield his head as a giant paper swan catapults into him, knocking him down.
Once Ginny’s collected herself, she puts her arms underneath her brother’s body and works to pull him up.
“What? And you lot didn’t even bother to look at the person standing next to you?” Ron’s arms are crossed, nose tilted in the air. “What if someone needed your help?”
“Yes, I thought so.” Alpha Bee pushes himself onto the counter and folds his hands into his lap. “And if you look through, you’ll notice most of the people listed are new heroes. The younger generation.”
, I suppose anyone would get desperate enough after having their friend cut off all contact for months on end, refusing to see them when they come calling, and
“I send you a paper swan to give you a lift, and you go and destroy it?” Paper Dracon calls from above. “Fine. Find your own way up, then.”
Still, following the theory that it had been a fight to the death, Paper Dracon could've fled from his attacker, just like he had fled from Harry.
By the time Harry arrives at the Weasley home in Shoreditch, it’s past midnight. He had to take a bus since reaching for his electricity felt like touching the frayed end of a wire. Probably what he gets for powering up and down so much in such a small time-frame.
“I—No. No, I wasn’t going to—” Harry suddenly remembers his plan to appear innocuous. Biting the inside of his cheek, he powers down.
“Never mind.” Several more minutes pass before another thought occurs to Harry. “Wait, then why are you hanging around me?”
As Harry waits in a darkened room while the hours tic by, he thinks over how he could have behaved differently. Whether he should have taken aim at Prancing Peacock’s group when he had been on the roof. Or whether he should have let the building burn since most of the other heroes had gotten everything important out while the place had still been on fire. A thousand different paths not taken lay themselves at Harry’s feet in the dark, and Harry wonders which ones a good hero would have trod.
But now, the mutilation the mask has suffered threatens the identity of its wearer; one of the white eye patches is completely gone, and a long gash slices diagonally through the fabric covering Dracon’s cheek. It’s barely noticeable with the dark red blood encrusting it. There’s even a large enough tear at the top of his head that a tuft of hair threatens to bust through. But it also must be matted with blood for it to stay in place with the wind snatching at the loose fabric ends.
The Coyle Ward remains relatively quiet as Harry passes through its entrance doors; two nurses are stationed at its reception desk.
This time, rushing footsteps are heard on the other side of the door. “When?” Prancing Peacock demands. “When did this happen, Draco?” The sounds of rattling chains come from the direction of Peacock’s voice. “What did that bastard hero do to ruin my son?”
When Harry reaches the door to the interrogation room, Ron’s got his hand on the handle and is staring it down in frustration. Harry cocks a brow. “Forgot how to turn a knob?”
His eyes flick back to Ginny, who’s still struggling with her brother’s weight, and the villain, whose aid would arrive any second to carry him off.
Hermione hops off her bar stool and hovers in front of Harry and Ron. “Do you want us to pass the information along to the other heroes involved in the case?”
to try to start something with him now? Part of Harry thinks it’s unfair that Draco came to him today to do this; though, in a way he understands it’s his way of building up courage for tomorrow.
Fisting both hands into the front of Harry’s silver robes, Draco shoved him up, bright eyes scanning Harry’s face with growing panic. “Wha—Harry? What
heroes. I’m sure after I spend my life sentence, my ghost will make an excellent do-gooder haunting my cell.”
Paper Dracon doesn’t apologize, and Harry didn’t expect him to. But he does still his movements. “I’m not weak.”
Smoke billows from the gaping hole blown into the side of a dilapidated block of flats. Residents crowd outside as sirens blare in the distance, still several street corners down.
Alpha Bee chuckles. “There’s that youthful spirit. I was worried the long day knocked it out of you.” He tugs on his beard again. “Hmm . . . Well, you’ll have to help file the police report—telling the officers all you know about the incident today. Then, I imagine, the three of you will want to get some rest after your hard work.”
He places his hands behind his head and walks a few streets before he sees several small figures. Barely holding off his grin, Harry powers down and sticks to the shadows of the buildings lining the road until he’s nearly upon the people. Then he brings his power back full force until he glows like a florescent light in the drizzling rain. “Now what have
Harry doesn’t like how deflated Dracon sounds, but he has a job to do as well. He sits cross-legged before the villain, hands propping him up as he leans backward and sends his electricity flowing through his system again. “Yeah, I suppose. But I doubt the Villain Agency stealing a bunch of files on England’s heroes was a mistake. That seemed quite deliberate to me.”
appears most affected out of all the villains by the quake as he collapses onto all fours to steady himself.
“Yes, and I imagine some villain’s always at the root of those people experiencing that sadness to begin with.”
“I say, since they’re all so keen to know our identities, we might as well get our shot at knowing theirs.”
The woman that accepted Harry’s note leads them.  She takes a few seconds to glance around—ostensibly for any guards—and spots the two of the them collapsed on the floor. Snapping her fingers twice, she then points at Harry and Dracon.
Now comes the tricky part. With great care, they work the loo window open and spring it from its hinges. Being the smaller one, Harry accepts Ron’s help lifting him through the window first. Outside, he uses his leverage to pull Ron through as well after he’s tossed their civilian clothes out to Harry. Then Harry takes the screwdriver stuffed in his jacket pocket, and he and Ron reconnect the window back into its place.
She walks around him and pushes on the door handle. It jiggles uselessly. Frustrated, she kicks at the door.
Harry waves off her concern. “What happened after? I mean after I passed out? To the arm and our ongoing cases.”
As Harry readies himself for bed, having bid Ron goodnight, he finds his mind drifting to Paper Dracon after having to remove the duffel bag containing his ruined suit from atop his bedspread.
“Oh, ‘of course.’” Dracon stuffs his hands into the pockets at his hips. “How could I expect anything else?” He pulls his hands from the pockets and out flies a pair of paper hummingbirds.
“I don’t know, it moved too fast for me to see. But it made the figure who attacked it cry out and hunch over. Then the two of them entered a fight in earnest. They knocked furniture over, broke the light in the other room, and scraped the flooring. After they got one of the hostages good with an attack, we all did our best to slide flat to the floor.”
Harry goes to follow him but stops just outside when he hears Hermione ask Alpha Bee what will be done with the file they’ve recovered.
claps his hands. “Well, I suppose that’s enough for today. I don’t think we’ll be getting anything more from this session. How do you all feel about fish and chips for lunch?”
The childish urge to call out “it’s mine!” died on Harry’s lips as he locked eyes with Draco’s overbright ones.
Blaizing Fire’s head turns as he follows Harry’s walk from the entrance to the seat across from him.
Alpha Bee claps his hands to gain everyone’s attention after using his Control over Fabric to pull Harry and Cho back to their seats. “Settle down, everyone. No throwing accusations at one another, please.” He tosses a glance Cho’s way. Then rubs a hand down his face. “Though, what you’re saying is a bit troubling,
For Paper Dracon, unfortunately, it comes to light that he had been an accomplice in involuntary manslaughter, paired with the abduction of at least six individuals the previous Autumn.
Delicately, Potter grasps the frame, arm stretched out and body far from Draco. His movements are calculated and deliberate, and their fingers do not brush. “Crowded, Diagon Alley.”
“If it's an ambush, we’re best off having the best kind of stealth possible. Me shining like a lighthouse will hardly provide that.”
Harry nearly jumps out of his skin when a voice comes from the rooftop of the deli next to him. “Where’ve you been, Blaise? Been looking for you for nearly forty-five minutes.”
Harry knows that’s what has to be done for this injury; he just never expected Dracon to want him to do it. “You sure?”
In the following sullen silence from Harry, Hermione pressed the importance of Draco’s spirit finding peace. That Harry was being selfish for keeping him in a world he no longer belonged.
Alpha Bee frowns. “Unfortunately, the detectives are still treating witness testimony as confidential.”
Blaizing Fire’s odd behavioral shifts suddenly come into perspective for Harry. When he’d found out that Harry had let Paper Dracon go, he’d thought Dracon would inform the Agency of his loose lips. Maybe he thought that clamming up on further information would be some kind of saving grace, but from what Dracon says, the more hardened villains that run the Agency don’t know mercy. Perhaps Blaizing Fire realized that himself and that’s why he readily gave up his identity.
Even with his powers blocked out by Ron, Vice-Net still throws the objects in Ron’s direction. They’re not as accurate as they would be if he still had his powers, but they come close enough to Ron that he has to dodge and drop his hand.
Ron’s eyes flick past the villain and catch onto Harry’s through his mask; then they flit in the direction of Harry’s sparking hand. He lifts the hand not holding off the villain’s powers in Harry’s direction. The second Ron drops the arm locked on the villain, Harry’s world explodes.
After breakfast, Harry'd opened his duffel and took stock of the damage. The puddle water had stained the red fabric and was particularly noticeable on the light gold lightning pattern that spiderwebs its way across the suit. Additionally, He could see many more rips on the uniform in the sunlight than he could in a back alleyway. He’d tossed it in the washer, making a mental note to purchase red and gold thread on his way home so Madam Malkin could fix it when he drops it off. His mask hadn’t been in as bad a shape as the rest of the outfit, despite it needing its own mending; it could still be worn.
“Look out!” Ron shoves Harry to the side as the Thatcher statue dives from the upper level of the room.
They’ve Apparated separately to Diagon, and it’s thankfully less crowded than normal due to the cold.
Still, Harry lowers his hand cautiously until it’s at his side. He tilts his head and walks around the ditch for a better angle.
The elf snaps his fingers, and Draco finds himself in the outside square, alone but for the rain and his thoughts.
“No.” Harry felt bad for the way he laughed, but not enough to stop. “No. It’s an Astral Projection potion. I got Hermione to research it for me. She’s really great, actually, at looking up and concocting illegal things if you ask nicely enough.”
pulled it off. He snorts and gives Harry a sidelong look. “Don’t fret your pretty head about it. Now, piss off before I lose my bet.”
Harry huffs a breath into his hands to try to warm them up a little, and he can see it rise through the cracks between his fingers. Flexing them to get the warmed blood flowing, Harry says, “To be fair, this is the first time you’ve asked us to come. Outside of academic work.”
He’s sprinting when the building comes into view. The inconspicuous office building is ablaze even in the pouring rain, which tells Harry that it’s being kept alive through unnatural means.
Harry waves his hand about dismissively at Paper Dracon. “You literally went from stealing important documents from Westminster to common thievery. That’s not cliché; that’s embarrassing.”
The dwindling pulses of life that came from his unconscious body definitely told Harry that had Paper Dracon stayed in that ditch overnight, he would have succumbed to his wounds.
“Okay, okay. Easy. Stop shouting.” He knows he should feel more fear with the angry villain so close, but, Lord, if his head wouldn’t split open from more of that shouting. “That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
Laughing lightly at Harry’s grimace, Dracon pulls out the desk chair and sits down. “Now, would you mind closing your eyes for me?”
Finch-Fletchley stuffs his hands into his jeans pockets and purses his lips. “All right.” He steps aside and motions with his head. “Come on in.”
What Harry’s looking for is relatively easy and quick for him to spot—a giant, gaping hole in the wall located a few meters down the corridor from the staircase they’d just ascended. Despite having his two arms braced across the shoulders of two different heroes, he manages to convey his point to the heroine in charge by loudly clearing his throat to get her attention and gesturing with his head in the hole’s direction.
Little wonder such a beautiful place had not been suspected for harboring some of the most dangerous criminals Britain has ever seen.
Like it sensed Harry’s dismay, the Snitch took another sharp turn downwards and into the trees. Harry and Draco followed suit, the resulting chase leading to what felt like facefulls of cobwebs as they both ignored the existence of trees and bolted right through them.
. They’ve been going at it for upwards of three years against London’s villains; yet they’re supposed to believe that their enemies have just now realized the heroes have had to have gone on record to be in accordance with the law? Unlikely.
and the young heroes comes to the forefront of Harry’s mind. But as he stares at Dracon’s white mask and his shaking hands, he can’t honestly say it’s to extort information out of him. The odd feeling fluttering in Harry’s chest that’s so familiar brings the truth to his lips. “I care.”
Harry is just glad that he had been prepared for Dracon to brush his cheek with his hand, otherwise, Harry would have accidentally sent a mightier shock through him when he embraced Harry. The smaller voltage of electricity coursing through him since being drained by the
—I took some advice that was given to me by a friend. Basically, I didn’t push it when someone said they didn’t want my help.” He glances down at his hands. “As someone who tries every day to be a good hero, it was hard—not rushing right in and aiding someone. But it was necessary.” Harry lifts his head again. “After I started to leave, I guess he had second thoughts—or maybe realized I meant it? —and called me back.”
“Could have been to both.” Finch-Fletchley lifts his shoulders in an unaffected shrug. “But regardless of who that was aimed at, the robot kept coming closer to the figure. I think the colleague had been laughing while this was happening—so, it must not have been a good argument the two were having.”
Finally, though, the room comes into focus. It’s a wide space with pillars scattered throughout. Harry spots some chains attached to the walls. As he looks around, movement catches his eye, and he realizes how many
Harry lets his electricity go, too. The glowing hum of the graphite quickly eats away at what energy is left from the current, and the ethereal glow stops.
“Or desperate.” Blaizing Fire’s tone takes on that wicked lilt that Harry so associates with Paper Dracon that Harry just blinks beneath his mask’s tinted lenses, hand with the cards stalled.
Blaizing Fire, unmasked and smirking at them all, flicks open and closed one of his lighters. “Yeah. I’d say it’s pretty destroyed.”
In the hospital’s atrium, he finds the front desk. Rapping on the synthetic wood gains the secretary’s attention. “Uh, hullo. I’m here to see some folks that were brought in last night? At the big explosion site several streets down.”
suffered a vampire attack.” He gestures at Potter, a sad smile crossing his features. “A truly frightening ordeal, that must have been. How could I even compare—begin to
Hermione says, “Try asking him what he wanted you to do, if you were really set on helping him. Or maybe asked him how you could have helped, if you wanted to lead the conversation in that direction.”
, as I was saying, breaking into a federal building and causing harm and damage there is much more serious a crime than anything I know you’ve done in the past.”
model. While I’d heard about it, I never really saw one in person. Once Fear-Near started to explain to me what it was after he turned it on and focused its attention on the people I captured . . . I got into an argument with him.”
“Granger.” Draco looks to Weasley who gives a brief nod and flashes a close-lipped smile. “What, no overly-friendly greeting this time?”
On their way to the next victim on the list, Potter continues to follow him in that same manner he’d used before—behind Draco but not out of Draco’s line of sight. He keeps watch over Potter out of the corner of his eye while his mind whirls, unlocking the box of thoughts he’s shoved down deep. With what he’s observed today and over their last few interactions, Draco can tell something's clearly eating at Potter, only Draco can't discern if that something has to do with
While Harry worked his way over, he had been aware of Paper Dracon’s gaze tracking him, even through Dracon’s two layers of masks. His head had followed Harry as he moved.
Harry frowns and watches Dracon stagger a bit before his legs remain steady under him. “Hey, my voice is much lower pitched than that.”
“Sorry,” Draco says, taking a step back. In the dim light of the attic, he watches the wand stay trained on him for the next long stretch of silence before finally lowering.
standing right beside the door to the interrogation room. As he walks closer, he catches bits of their conversation.
He toys with the lock, turning it this way and that, while the henchmen finish loading the troublesome crate onto the boat. Just when he hears a satisfying
you cooperate. So, I’ll ask you again. Would you be willing to help us track down the vampire that bit you?”
“Why? Because he was involved in the kind of activity he has participated in for the entirety of your acquaintanceship?” Ron flops down onto his back. “Look. Hermione and I have been talking this whole thing over—”
Harry’s eyes flutter open, and, at first, they don’t recognize what they’re seeing. But after a moment or two adjusting, he realizes he’s looking through what must be eye slits in a mask. And just what his eyes see on the other side of the mask takes his breath away.
“Yeah, see, the only reading I do for a hobby consists of sports mags, and we already get those in the post.”
Ron makes to rush the table, but Harry catches hold of his sleeve, remembering to lower his voltage upon doing so to prevent Ron from shocked.
steps forward, head held high. She looks down her nose at Harry in a way that makes him feel guilty—despite the fact that he’s a hero come to help. In a Scottish brogue, she says, “I’ll go with you.”
“Hmmm, okay. I had been taking a walk in the local park with some friends—Hannah and Ernie.” He looks at Harry for recognition. “You know, the other two you pulled out of the building that night?”
and the other on their escape route to the door, Harry guides Dracon along in shuffling steps. The robot doesn’t advance towards them—it wouldn’t need to, considering it stopped in the center of the cell—but it does rotate to follow their progress towards the exit and keep its palms trained on them.
Ron doesn’t miss it either as he smirks. “Don’t like it much when the shoe’s on the other foot, huh?”
She floods one robot’s internal circuits after another with water spouting from a burst pipe. Against the mechanical monsters that seem to be playing tug-of-war with her over control of the water, she takes them down next. One by one, she causes them to explode. Evidently, whatever upgrades the Agency gave the robots, they certainly didn’t make them Cho-proof.
Giving her a weak smile, Harry lets her go, and she heads up the stairs—probably to see Luna before their night patrol.
His heartbeat spikes, and his breath catches in his throat as he envisions finally seeing the face attached to the voice that’s antagonized him for so long. But then his traitorous mind pictures the opposite—a situation where Harry’s the one lying defenseless on the ground, and Dracon’s lifting Harry’s mask away.
brought in. I know the Hero Order has been mainly leaving him to you younger heroes since he appears quite young himself, but this attack was a breaking point, I think.”
Dracon grumbles a bit, and the way his shoulders roll forward warn Harry he’s starting to clam up again.
Harry’s lips press together while he watches Ron raise his hand again. He doesn’t offer a protest this time. Having his power shut off from such a high point of use feels a lot like coming to a sudden stop in a car after flooring the gas pedal.
He scribbles a meeting place and time on the back and sends it off to Potter before he can regret it.
He could just try opening different doors and see what happens. While that tactic would increase his likelihood of running into villains, this had been why he’d come in his disguise. And even if his under-mask were to be ripped away, he might still be in the clear. Without his electricity running through him, he hardly looks like the Superhero Izulu. His hair is down, and only the scar on his forehead remains after not powering up all day.
“Eh-heh-heh.” He uses his free hand to rub at the back of his head. “It’s just . . . . The first time I ever saw you was when I was roughly ten. I was riding a bus with my . . . aunt, uncle, and cousin. It had turned over after a villain dodged an attack from Ced, and the rock struck its side. I don’t remember who you were fighting, but I do recall clearly, you helping everyone climb out safely, even though your powerset would have been better off aiding Ced in the fight.” Harry closes his eyes as he pictures it. “There . . . . there was a gas leak, wasn’t there? That’s why you had to get everyone out? In case it caught fire and exploded.”
“Go after . . . ?” Mrs. Figg leans back in the wooden rocker she sat on, arm across her eyes. A cat weaves itself between her legs to curl beneath her chair. “Dear, he was
“But again, he wasn’t home at the time. Why ambush an empty house? It could very well have been a hit and run or coincidental robbery attempt.”
“You know, now that you say that, Ron, I think something else makes some sense.” Harry starts pacing again while he thinks it through. “Yes. I probably should have seen it sooner. You two remember when I tried to charge the mechanical arm back to life?”
He starts to tug Harry in the direction of another crate pile when Harry digs in his heels. “What—?”
Lastly, they clean up the drinks. Ron calls dibs on the shot glasses; Harry grabs the quarter empty bottle of wine and places it on the shelf. Hermione’s always been a lightweight.
’s star-covered coat. “Please, don’t interrogate him without us.” He sucks in a breath. “Whoever he is, we worked just as hard to bring about his capture. We’re owed an explanation for why we had to fight all those villains today.”
But the hand of one of the cops landing heavily on Harry’s shoulder and his dismissive “We’ll handle it from here” causes Harry to straighten. The tightening of the man’s grip after the unwitting zap he gets for touching Harry when he’s unaware sets Harry’s teeth on edge. “We’ll also have to ask you some questions, of course.”
When Harry is about to put the lid back on, his eyes catch another type of debris mixed in with the wiring and metal. It’s the little white bits he remembers seeing before, embedded inside the arm’s plating. Now that he’s much closer, he can see them better, and a sinking feeling appears in his stomach.
,” Ron says. “I gave that to you because, for whatever reason, the relationship between you and that villain has been changing over the month since the incident. While finding out his involvement in that case has affected how you perceive him now, he doesn’t have the same kind of shift on his end. For him, he always knew of his involvement, and the trajectory of your changing relationship has stayed the same for him.”
“Luckily, I figured out it was vulnerable under the metal plating. So, I sent small pieces into the spacing at the joints, cutting the internal wiring. Unfortunately . . . doing so made it explode. I was blown out of the building, and, as hurt as I was, I knew I couldn’t stay there. Fear-Near was nowhere in sight. So, I decided to try for the nearest base up north.”
All of the older heroes have had to deal with their identities being stolen. For Harry to put his on the line for this mission? Not ideal, but a risk he’s willing to take to rescue the missing heroes and Dracon.
back at it, using her Control over Form to change the size of the costumes the villains wear—either making it small enough to constrain movement or large enough to impede movement. Additionally, he sees her shifting the remaining pieces of roof above them into stalactites with nowhere to hold on to and nowhere to head but downward.
Between the time it took Harry and Ron to Apparate to the Ministry and actually deliver evidence of Draco Malfoy’s death to the Auror Department, Ron had tried nineteen times to convince Harry that Malfoy no longer being able to haunt his flat was a good thing. His reasoning included such gems as “he’s a prat, mate” and “have you
“Been working for this Department for a fair amount of time. While I may still need to smooth out how I handle clients—” Draco says while Potter draws in a sharp breath “—that doesn’t mean I’m not a professional in my field.”
The weariness rises again inside him, along with a headache, threatening to pull Harry under. He powers through the urge by sheer will. “So many people have been hurt. Who knows who could have died? Why did you leave us on our
Ron still has his hand trained on GarGoyle, even as the villain and Paper Dracon descend from the rooftop on a large paper swan.
as he goes to throw whatever knives he’d managed to collect from the scuffle inside the Palace, deadening his powers. Then Ron lifts his other hand in Hermione’s direction, just as the last millimeter of space gets used up on the page.
pretty good. Must be all the metal he’s got stuffed away. Attracted a good amount of that electricity you sent out.” Ron huffs a sudden laugh. “You also managed to blast off that pointing finger from the Iron Lady.”
Harry can’t tell whether Cho’s furious or just shocked. “I mean, he didn’t. Not at first.” His tongue is thick in his mouth. “When I first asked if I could, he told me 'no'.”
A heavy feeling settling inside him, Harry heads off in the direction of the glow. He’s well outside his patrol route of Shoreditch when he realizes he is heading in toward the Hero Order’s headquarters. The dread inside him grows as he picks up his pace.
Draco stops when his back brushes against a wall, and he stares defiantly into Potter’s brilliant green eyes. “All right... You willing to be a little uncomfortable with me, Potter?”
“But what hero lets their partner die? What heroine is so useless, she can’t even use her Control over Water by a
“Even though it likely is.” Her hands twist in her lap. “They’ve been really interrogating him. That villain
. I don’t think I could take—” He sighs, then straightens. “I also had Kreacher try to find the—the v-vampire. At the places I used to see ‘em. The old workplace. A bar…different bars most of the time. Things like that. But it’s like they vanished, or never even existed.”
A lot to hedge his bets on, but the Agency seems to not be expecting the Hero Order to have located their main hideout. Worse comes to worse, he could always pretend to be an ordinary thief so as not to give away his fellow heroes. Although, what villains would do to someone committing a crime against
’s in the middle of saying something to the Supervillain. “—and I know you’re probably very concerned. Being at the mercy of one’s enemy is hardly a comfortable position for anyone. So, it’s best you just tell us what you know.”
And Draco can feel a wetness against his neck, though he’s certain it’s not blood. He lifts his free hand and lays it gently against Potter’s shuddering back. “I know. And now you do too.”
“Thank you, Weasley. I’m glad your Auror Training has sharpened your observation skills to a dull point,” Malfoy snapped.
Logically, Harry knows if he were to look at Dracon right now, he wouldn’t see his expression. Yet for all his bravery, he doesn’t have the strength to turn his head. “Not . . . always.”
Voldemort lies motionless on the stairway, surrounded by the dying emberous glow of over a thousand paper cranes.
“Yes, I’m very captivating. Thank you for noticing.” He pushes off from the wall. “However, I’m here for whatever plea deal he’ll be getting.” Fire points a finger at Paper Dracon.
While “Mellow Malfoy” meant that he could safely bring his items back into the flat without fear of repercussion, there was still one small—actually very big—problem. Mellowed-out Malfoy offered far more a depressing sight than Malicious Malfoy did, what with his aimless, listless floating about the rooms and the constant twitching of his hands—a tick not around when he had lived. Hell, the way Draco’s eyes would glance over Harry like he didn’t even see him chilled Harry worse than when Draco had been actively haunting him.
Once he knows that he’s regained his composure, Harry dashes around the current floor until he finds the stairs again, using the glow from his power to light the way. Before reaching the roof, he cuts off his electricity, fully aware that he’s been powering up and down too much consecutively tonight to be healthy.
“Kind of reminiscent of when we first met, eh, hero?” The voice comes from a stack of boxes further up ahead to Harry’s right.
He ushers her back inside the spacious cell, assuming she’ll pass the news around to everyone in there.
Richard and his horse stop where they are and fall over, pieces breaking off as the statue strikes the ground.
Hermione claps twice, her eyes shining. “I’m glad to hear it! I loved Galbraith’s first novel, and I’ll probably swipe the sequel off of you when you’re done with it.”
“A mother never asks a question she doesn’t already know the answer to.” She gave him a wan smile. “Despite your belief to the contrary, I was a good mother.”
“No, I’m only about halfway. But I think this author is good enough so far that I might pick up the sequel while we’re here.”
The confidence he’s been lacking since first appearing in the square outside Grimmauld Place returns to him then.
Taking a breath, Harry works to calm the adrenaline rush so that he can properly power down. Sneaking around while being lit up by his power would be like tailing someone with headlights on.
Harry shakes his head, shifts to face Paper Dracon—who’s slumped against the wall—and tugs him back to a standing position.
She turns her head away and presses her hands against her eyes. “I just wanted to have a good time. Th-that’s all. And then that—that
says as he places a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “We knew some heroes had responded to the situation. Seeing as it was a Supervillain attack, the emergency vehicles had thought it best to leave the fight to those that could match the enemy’s power. Instead, they hung back, and formed a wide perimeter around the outskirts of the Palace to intercept any of the people who managed to flee or were freed by the heroes who took action.”
Blaizing Fire slumps back in his chair, and Harry sees for the first time that his ankles are bound together too. The villain sits there, huffing like he’d been forced to lift a car—without the help of explosives.
All of them appear too caught up in their individual struggles not to fall completely to the ground.
He’s almost at the interrogation room before he realizes he’s in a hospital-style gown, the layers thin enough that it’s doubtful it would hold up against his electricity should he power up—but Harry’s too arsed to care at the moment. He has his mask, and that’s all he needs to protect his identity.
She gasps and points at the gentleman second to last on the right—a tall fellow, muscular in build, with a certain sharpness about his features. “Him. That one.”
Justin swings the door open, wearing a yellow pullover and blue jeans. He double-takes on seeing Harry—meaning to Harry that the guy had been so incautious as to open the door without checking through the peephole first. “I-
Letting the electric whip disperse, Harry’s about to bolt for the door when he remembers he had just gotten that lock undone.  No way in hell he’d leave without accomplishing
“I can’t believe you let him get away!” Hermione paces in front of Harry in the observation room. “After Blaizing Fire actually gave you a lead!”
With shaking fingers, Harry locates the pocket Dracon mentioned and withdraws a tiny paper swallow. He places it in Dracon’s waiting hand, then steps back to watch him work.
Gathering Fire’s coat tighter around him, Harry walks back out into the hallway, whips out the notepad and pen in his pocket, and, against the wall, scribbles:
While Harry had figured that that crime would end up being one best handled by heroes, he’s still shocked that the police handed over evidence knowing that he’s particularly invested in the case. But the surprise swiftly shifts to a budding dread that blooms in his stomach like an infecting fungus. The case must either not be going well, or the situation is worse than he—or the cops—had originally imagined.
Now that Harry stands on equal footing with the villain, he can read his stance as trying to be casual, but the tension in his frame belies that.
Harry coughs when he goes to answer, throat stinging from all the smoke he inhaled. Even so, having someone thank him for his help is a new feeling, and he doesn’t know quite how to handle it.
They shuffle down the hallway until they’re both certain they’re out of the robot’s range. Then the two of them collapse, huffing for breath. Harry and Dracon stay like that until the pained exhaustion leaves their limbs and starts to lift from their minds.
“Hermione, I’ve lived most of my life with ‘the worst case scenario’ hanging over my head. Honestly, with Voldemort gone, this feels like a homecoming.”
signed on it between his index and middle fingers. Five more minutes pass before he tears his eyes away from the faded inscription and focuses them on the open book.
“NO!” Harry’s movements are swift and somewhat jerky as he makes an aborted attempt to approach Hermione.
Malfoy’s eyes had been scoping out the nooks and crannies of the kitchen, and he did not notice at first when Harry’s form darkened the kitchen threshold. However when he did see him, his shock took the form of the widening of his eyes and the uncrossing of his arms, resulting in the revelation of a third ghostly peachick nestled securely in the center of his chest. With a
While not an uncomfortable silence, the two of them finish off their ice cream in silence nonetheless.
Harry hangs back from the group, both trying to mull over his thoughts as well as give everyone else their space, after the stressful scene in the conference room. However, his attention gets caught by Alpha Bee bringing up his name.
that?! New Boy—” he points at Harry then to himself “—Professional. The difference between you and me,
Ron stares at him a moment, hands on his hips. “I don’t think that’s all there is to it, mate, but—”
Completely aware time is not on his side, he vaults himself atop the crate anyway. He dives for the lock at the same time a miniature paper crane lands delicately on his hand. Harry pauses.
The two of them set off for the place Ginny had told Harry she’d have the bats drop his change of clothing.
They sit beside one another on her couch, piping tea placed on the little table before them. After adding two lumps of sugar to his cup, he turns back to Tracey who continues to eye him warily.
Draco rubbed at where his gaping wound had been like the spot pained him now. “It’s time for me to go,” he rasped. “I don’t want to go.”
Harry turns his head back toward the room as Hermione speaks. “Isn’t it obvious why they wanted them? Heroes and Villains are enemies. Knowing the true identities of your enemy is an advantage anyone would want.”
the condescending look Potter’s giving him. No, that’s what seven plus years of shared history is for. “Of course he’d be in. Our department sent an owl out to everyone letting them know we’d stop by today.”
As he adjusted to a new weightlessness about him, he glanced around the ballroom, taking in the pale haze that coated every wall and piece of furniture and the hollow shadows that lurked in crevices he hadn’t noticed earlier. Harry blinked against the golden hue radiating off Ron and Hermione as they adjusted Harry’s prone body on the lounge. At first, he hadn’t recognized it as his body because of the dark shadows swirling around it, as though death was shocked to find a body empty of its host without express permission.
Centering himself, Harry amps up the electrical charge coursing through his body, then channels it into the knives pressed tight against his skin.
Her expression remains contemplative. “I…I don’t know. But I must have. I mean, he wouldn’t have stolen it from me. He could’ve just asked, and I’d have said yes.”
He can feel Ron’s gaze on him, even with Ron’s mask shielding his eyes. Harry doesn’t miss the subtle shift where Ron starts to raise his hand in Harry’s direction. Feeling a spike of panic, Harry subtly shakes his head.
. But saying it now would be to admit he was aware of the innuendo, and therefore would admit to Potter on some level where his thoughts slide sometimes.
“I just mean... there are probably other jobs for you out there, ones where you’re not—” Potter gestures at Draco’s whole self— “uncomfortable a good portion of the time.”
In the following months, the Hero Order is given a hefty fine for having thoroughly ravaged a “perfectly lovely house in Kensington.” Considering the group of heroes are struggling to pay for a new headquarters and that they already serve the community well, they get the fine cut in half in exchange for double the service hours in Kensington.
to look up to and something to strive towards. And keeping track of all your adventures, it really made me want to become a hero—which is odd, considering I should probably have been inspired by my parents. But it’s hard to be inspired by people you don’t truly know and feel like you should. Too many complicated emotions there.”
“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what you said. How Justin’s not been able to really use his power since the incident and that the Villain Agency’s likely behind it.”
And he was ‘getting on it’ when the explosion from outside the West End shopping district of London shook the very street he stood upon at precisely 7:30 pm. After making his excuses to the
Sighing, Harry ran a hand through his hair and moved to sit on his bed. “Sorry,” he mumbled into his lap. “I’m being a prat about all this, but that’s because I don’t really know how to take it. Tell me—what would you do if your childhood rival showed up in your home with the news that he died?” And painfully, from the looks of it.
Cho has made it to Voldemort, already checked for his pulse, and is trying to get him to wake up again.
“Are you implying they sure as hell recognised me?” The new wolfish smile he flashes at the Auror shows off the largest and sharpest incisor Draco has seen in a year. It certainly makes Ms. Adams and Potter’s fangs look like mere baby teeth.
With caution, Harry deftly had followed two men inside a bustling kitchen as they returned from dropping the rubbish outside. Just as reported, the chaos in the kitchen afforded Harry the cover he needed to slip into the main section of the large house.
The smoke from the flames Blaizing Fire created mixes with the last vestiges of Hermione’s haze barrier, making it impossible to see. But they can hear the scrambling footsteps on the other side of the fire wall.
“You’d like me to try that again?” The hissing voice makes a humming sound. “Will it be more flashes with this hero smiling, glowing in back alleyways, and having sunlight shine on his raven hair?”
“But, Hermione! We don’t know what they’ll do to him. They could very well kill him for helping me escape.”
Potter winces, showing off a fang. “Sorry, Mr. Park. I hadn’t—I didn’t come along to make you feel like your experience should somehow be compared to mine. Not like that. And I—I just thought being upfront about my—er—
rises from his position behind the pew again, pulling more sharp objects from hooks inside his cloak.
As she vaults herself over the rail and runs up the steps, Harry realizes how quiet it’s gotten. He does a slow three-hundred and sixty degree turn and takes in the sight of Superheroes having finished their battles with their villain opponents and the remaining villains surrendering. Harry catches sight of Alpha Bee’s body again as he does, an indescribable ache rising from his stomach and up to his throat to choke him. He tamps down the urge to feel for an electrical pulse of life from Alpha Bee's prone form that Harry knows does not exist.
Knowing that he can’t speak since Voldemort would know his voice does not belong to Fire, Harry opts to bow and prays that would be enough.
Grasping hold of Dracon’s wrist right before the manacle encircles it, Harry brings it closer to his face for inspection. He rubs his thumb along the fault line where the two sides of the cylinder connect.
“Well, we could no longer see its lights, so it wasn’t facing us anymore. The only other options were that it turned around or shifted to face one of the people standing on either side of it.”
“If that’s really what you want to do, why not just learn how to work the tech box? That way, you can do what you enjoy regardless of your power's state.”
According to Ron, she’s been like this with most of the recovering heroes in her house when she runs into them. Hermione seems to believe Mrs. Weasley is relieved that at least some of her guests are getting better—the luck with healing the poison victims has been dicey at best. Though, both admit that Harry has always been a favourite of Mrs. Weasley.
Feeling some of the awkwardness fade away, Harry smiles brightly at her. “You sure did! My Control over Electricity at the time had been erratic at best, but you helping out in situations where you didn’t even use your Control over Water made me feel like anyone could become a Superhero. So long as you persistently work towards it and believe in helping people in need.” He sighs. He sighs. “To make one other person believe—like you did for me . . . I'd have made it, then. As the kind of hero I strive to be.”
“I don’t know.” Hermione’s hands squeeze together in her lap atop her book. “We’ll have to wait and see what kind of counter plan Alpha Bee or the other older heroes come up with.”
Fortunately, Narcissa’s return meant that vultures at the Ministry could no longer descend on the corpse of the Manor and divy it up to any interested party. Unfortunately, her return heralded a new challenge for Harry and Draco as she took up residence back at the Manor. Harry’s Felix Felicis-level luck ran out on his eighth secret visit since her coming home.
Seeming to shake himself, Alpha Bee strides forward and clasps Harry by the shoulders. “My boy, I’m delighted you’re back with us. You certainly had everyone deeply concerned. I hope you’ve alleviated
He rolls back on his heels, a choked noise coming from his throat. Swiftly, Dracon stands back up and walks back to his previous perch.
Many more heroes, including Nix-Nymph, are put up in the make-shift medical ward Poppy Petal set up in the Weasley’s house—the only place with enough room to momentarily act as headquarters thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s Control over Space. Even with most of their identities in the hands of their enemies, placing them in actual hospitals is considered too much a risk to their privacy and safety. Poppy Petal is the only hero at the Order to know every hero’s secret identity since she handles all injuries.
Unsurprisingly, Harry and Draco’s fists closed over the Snitch at the same time, their fingers sliding together in an awkward embrace. Their combined momentum from opposite directions sent them spinning like a merry-go-round with their joint hands acting as the grounding point for motion.
He waited until the swish of her robes against the underbrush had all but vanished in the distance before speaking again into the silence. “It’s rude, you know, hiding from your mother like that.”
However, he did feel the roiling dizziness he associated with falling off a broom and plunging hundreds of feet to the Earth. Slamming into the ground, in this scenario, felt a lot like bursting out of an ocean for air after having been drowning for so long. This resurrection from the depths of life had Harry bolting up out of his skin. He gasped in air that no longer felt real in the most freeing of ways.
Saturday comes faster than Harry had anticipated—which is odd since the week felt like it had also dragged out for longer than necessary. He stands before the warehouse doors of an old steel plant, his invitation clutched in his gloved hand and his electricity buzzing around him. The paper had shifted its lettering to flash the number of the warehouse Harry was expected to go to when he entered the yard.
Picking up his glasses and putting them on, Harry looks at Ron as he stares at the ceiling. “Is something else the matter?”
“Oh.” She flattens the part of her robe that covers her lap. “I don’t know. But it’s probably not remotely the same kind of tactics you kids used on him. Hopefully they can get the information they need.”
“I wish we could play one out with an actual Golden Snitch, but I suppose you didn’t get one to astral project along with you?”
“I don’t know, the cornered person continued to sound more and more desperate. Finally, the trapped figure shoved his hands into his pockets and flung something at the outstretched arm. It made a weird clunky sound, and it must have dropped down to the machine’s side since it disappeared from view but didn’t make a sound like it hit the floor or anything.”
However, upon trying to end the life of a hero before it could begin, dear old Moldy Wart had been in for a shock.
Taking him back to the Weasley household is out of the question. His friends and partners would never forgive Harry for unwittingly revealing the location of their base to a villain in the Agency’s pocket.
“Well,” Draco finally says. “This is the most boring fight I’ve ever had with you. Don’t tell me you’ve turned
“Well, you can’t—” Harry was saying. And then he blinked and found himself standing in a lush, overgrown garden, Ron and Draco by his side. “What the—”
Beneath the anger bringing new life to Malfoy’s features, Harry saw the roiling fear lurking in his eyes. He shut his own eyes against the sight, regretting that decision immediately as the memory of Malfoy staring at him through a bathroom mirror with the same expression etched itself on the back of his eyelids. Bloody buggering bastard.
Pounded at by the beaks and claws of the stone beasts freed from the parapets, Harry starts sending useless shocks at the ones attacking him while he tries to glimpse Ron dealing with his own swarm. Harry knows that without being able to pinpoint GarGoyle, Ron is defenseless with his power set against the stone beasts.
Suddenly, the noise of stone bashing against stone permeates the air a thousand times over. Harry darts a glance toward the Palace again to see the last of the stone gargoyles crash into the concrete as the source of their flight loses its power. He relaxes. “Great job, De—”
“I don’t know what you could possibly have to say that’s so urgent.” He rests his hands at his hips and lets out a long breath as he looks through the window into the interrogation room. “But it seems like they’re just ending things in there; so, I suppose it won’t hurt. We’ll see what the heroes say when they come in.”
the mould on your walls” and “just saying, you look way thinner than when Voldemort was hunting us like a niffler after gold.” Surprisingly, none of these arguments moved Harry’s heart from the path he’d found himself on.
Draco’s never really enjoyed this part of the job, which is why, he imagines, the higher ups in his department continue to give it to him.
concerned. But he doesn’t kid himself about the dangers of revealing that to an enemy. “We’d never send one of ours out in your condition.”
Harry shrugs. “Dunno.” They pass under a streetlamp, the orange stripes of Ron’s suit looking faded and the red tint on the mask Harry wears dimly dancing like fire in the dull lighting. “But that’s why I brought you. And in case it’s the latter, that’s why Hermione and the others are on standby.”
When the people Harry has been keeping an eye on turn away from the building, get knocked out, or turn out to be heroes he hadn’t recognized, he convinces himself he’s overthinking everything.
Alpha Bee hums and casts his eyes toward a light above them. “Before we head in to talk with our guest, I believe I should show you what we confiscated off his person.”
“Great, a ghost that’s managed to retain some magical abilities? Only you, Harry,” Ron said. “And just ‘cause you’re soft on him doesn’t mean—”
She clucks her tongue when she realizes he’s opened his eyes. “One of these days, you’ll choose not to behave so recklessly.”
One time, Harry had volunteered at a local fair to sit in the dunk tank; the people throwing only got him once. But once in the icy water was enough to nearly send him into shock as he was suddenly submerged. As Harry stands there in the interrogation room, looking at his best friend, he feels just as he did when the water closed over the top of his head. What makes this time all the worse is that Alpha Bee and Hermione seem to consider it.
Harry knows the villain’s trying to convey something by the way his tone dropped and wonders if it's hints about the current case.
“S-sorry.” He ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck. He stepped right into this one. “I didn’t mean to follow you-er-well. I mean, I meant to follow the person who left, but I didn’t know it was you. I wouldn’t have. Uh, if I did, that is.”
“Let me finish, will you?” Harry’s tongue feels heavy in his mouth. “If I win, you tell me what you know, and if you win . . . we’ll let you go.”
Small embers dot one of Fire’s sleeves as he beckons to his comrades. “C’mon! More heroes are on the way!”
“You struck out some of our key pieces in this battle. I would be remiss to just let you go for that.”
They sit side by side in silence for awhile. A single cloud drifts from the right and passes over the moon before continuing to the left horizon.
“Er, right.” Harry tugs at the thin piece of his mask that runs along the part of the back of his neck where his hair starts on his head and tries not to wonder what the hell he thinks he’s doing having such a casual conversation with an enemy. “I suppose a lot of it pertains to protecting people, helping them out where we can. And, I guess the joy we often get in return from the people we’ve saved goes a long way in bringing us back to help again and again.”
“No!” Her frame shakes with her conviction. “No, I-I’m not . . . .” She sinks back down into the couch, head in her hands.
“All right, sure. I’m Harry Potter, but I’m not sure you’re Draco Malfoy. Draco’s been missing for a month.”
was saying—can you tell us what’s going on? We want to know what we’re getting into. You know, so we can do our jobs—
Draco’s eyes have adjusted enough to the minimal lighting that he sees Potter bite down hard on his bottom lip, the smallest pair of fangs protruding. Before the War, Draco may have been enough of a bastard to take that kind of opening, a cheap shot right at Potter’s emotional jugular. He likes to think himself a different man than he was, so he pretends to have not noticed Potter’s slip of the tongue.
“Oh, they certainly threatened to. If I didn’t give them the information they wanted, they told me right out that they were going to do so. And, yeah,” Blaizing Fire shrugs, “I understand that. Tit for tat, and all that. I just got so tired of those
Nibbling at his thumb, he considers his options. Then, with purpose in his step, he walks alongside the CAUTION tape until he’s in one of the side alleyways. Once there, he slows down, scanning the ground with his eyes.
An image of Paper Dracon with his fractured leg submitting to the offered help of his enemy flashes through Harry’s mind. He starts getting out of bed. “Just what are they doing to him?”
“Oh, you want to jump right to it, then? Bit boring, but all right.” He runs his tongue along his front teeth. “What’s it like—that’s what you’re asking, right?”
He tamps down the urge to defend his heroic impulses. “I was getting to that. See, I think that there’s an opportunity for us to, uhm, for lack of a better word . . .
cried. And he’s—he’s his own monster now and still...he—” Potter’s baleful eyes search Draco’s face. “What does that make me?”
With the stress grating on him from both the Dracon situation and the overall case of stolen hero identities, Harry feels his mood going steadily downhill. After the seventh dead end, Harry decides he needs to separate himself from the other heroes before he snaps and does something else he’ll regret.
“Hope not. Lavender had said she’d try to get her to come out. She needs all the emotional support she can get with her powers acting out of control.”
Harry sighs and picks the note back up again before letting it fall to his lap. “So, what do you reckon we should do about this . . . invitation?”
Even as Harry finds himself drawing closer to the hospital, he knows by the tight pull at the seams of the suit that he can’t travel by rooftop on the way home. Or get into any fights. He’s already pressing it, being powered up in the compact fabric; he’ll have to dowse it in anti-static spray once he’s finished for the day.
Everyone in the room appears thoughtful now—except for Cho who rests her head atop her raised hand, elbow planted on the table. “So, what you’re saying is that the villains don’t take care of their own? That shouldn’t really be a surprise.”
Potter comes in alone, the bags under his eyes prominent in the bright lighting. As he walks closer to Draco, Draco hazily remembers how malnourished Potter had looked at the beginning of every school year and how that had paled in comparison to the gaunt lines in his face the first time Draco’d seen it post-vampire attack. But now, stuffed full of Mrs. Weasley’s cooking and his friends’ unconditional love, Potter mostly looks tired.
Picking himself off the floor, Harry walks up to Alpha Bee. “Do you really think me going back in there’s a good idea? I mean, I did let everyone down by not getting anything useful from Paper Dracon.”
“Can I come in?” Draco asks, feeling ridiculous. As if their entire relationship in the past has ever consisted of asking
“Oh, you know, Hermione. When hero duty calls . . .” Harry says.  Shoving his hands into his pockets and shuffling past her inside the house, he tells himself there’s no reason to feel guilty.
. Eager, Harry angles his head left, then right, until he makes out two other letters—one on either side of the
Hermione starts lightly twisting a dark curl with her index finger.  “Well, to be fair, you are his enemy.”
“All right, all right. I get it.” Paper Dracon waves Harry off. As he heads toward the alley mouth, hand digging in his pocket no doubt for a swan, he says, “Doubt you’d appreciate me jumping any more old women for the funding, though.”
Harry nods and powers up. He grits his teeth and bears through it when it feels like all his nerve endings are on fire. Perhaps the both of them had taken on more villains than they could manage.
“I didn’t force him to do anything! He seemed hell-bent on ignoring his state and insisting he didn’t need my help.”
“Well, I see you’re still getting over the last one. Not seen a Healer for it, then?” Weasley taps at his own eye that mirrors the one on Draco’s face with the nearly vanished bruise.
Harry knows he’s preserving the electricity he has left in his system to go against Voldemort. He doubts, though, that if he had planned to assist in these other battles taking place that he would want to get in Cho’s way.
Harry drops the bit back into the box, puts the lid back on, and replaces it in the drawer. Exhaustion hits as he reaches the top of the stairs. But as he re-enters the home full of wounded heroes, Harry remembers exactly what’s at stake.
She brings him into the sitting room, cats crawling on every piece of furniture. Mrs. Figg hefts one off a stuffed chair and waves her hands for Harry to sit.
After a while longer, Malfoy dropped his stare back to the work he pretended his fingers were doing. “I could never do this when I was alive. Mother hated the idea that I was marring a piece of history. She said restorative charms could only do so much work for so long before the wood was ruined beyond repair.” His nails worked faster at their incorporeal scraping.
Just as suddenly as the panicked feeling came, it flees him. Harry gasps for breath. He has a vague sense of the other people around him doing the same.
“Let me guess. You pulled your little stunt when snarking me earlier, thinking I wouldn’t notice what you’d done.”
As Mr. Eeylops leads them through the shop, some of the patrons reach out to touch Draco on the shoulder with whispered “Hello”s and “Good to see you, Mr. Malfoy”s. With each one, Draco manages a curt nod but doesn’t stop for conversation. He can feel Potter’s curious gaze burning into his back, and, just like in Sixth Year, Draco can’t even enjoy it.
is the one who arrived on the scene first, saved the people still alive, and fully cooperated with the officer’s demands for information, he’s at least due for some attempt at being treated as an equal. His teeth grind together. It’s his case too. He deserves to learn what happened to the people he’d been unable to save.
Blaizing Fire taps the fingers of one hand against the tabletop. “Like I said, villains know how to handle themselves in a bad situation.”
Turning to look at the new arrival, Harry sees the stone statue of Margaret Thatcher charge into the room with her finger threateningly pointing at them just as Ron shouts his hero name. Too late, Harry feels Vice-Net’s latest attack graze his skin as a flurry of knives, this time, pins him effectively to the wall. Try as he might to tug himself free—even if it means all new tears in his costume—Harry’s as ineffective as a butterfly in an insect collection. Still, he shouts, “
“Doesn’t mean we have to!” Harry didn’t mean to shout; it just came out that way. In a quieter voice, he says, “We’re heroes, right? We follow what’s right, even when it’s not easy.”
Harry just stops himself from shrugging. Thinking back to Fire’s mannerisms from the interrogation room, Harry tilts his chin in that challenging way. Too late does he realize Fire probably acts much differently around his mates. Hell, Fire acts differently with Harry, Ron, and Hermione when they face off in battle. And he speaks
“Come now, Potter. We both know this won’t be the first time you’ve held my wand.” The second the words leave his mouth, Draco knows he should correct them. Say,
As the days drag on with no hint of where Paper Dracon might be, and several attempts to scout and raid assumed Villain Agency bases that turn up dead ends for both the young villain and the missing heroes, Harry can’t help but think of those final moments before Dracon let him go. The subtle shaking of his hand as he gripped Harry’s arm; the limping gait of his tread as he moved as fast as he could to get Harry to the exit; the way he pulled Harry so close that Harry could count the smallest flecks of silver dotting the white of his dragon skull mask; the whispered words soft as a kiss . . . .
Harry and Ron peek over her shoulder as she sifts through the contents. But the first page they see tells them all they need to know. All three of them draw in sharp breaths.
Gaining a second wind, Alpha Bee bounces on the balls of his feet and steeples his fingers below his chin. “I’m glad you asked,
The car Fire had attacked them with truly explodes, sending the Supervillain flying forward several meters and well over the heads of the two heroes still on the ground.
The other MP glances at her colleague. “Please. If they were of any use in this situation, why would they be hiding out behind here with us?”
When she attempts to ask him a flurry of follow-up questions, Harry flips the note over so that it reads:
“You... could’ve done that the whole time?” Malfoy’s voice was small, his jaw still slack. Or maybe it was unhinged a bit where that ghost-bruise brushed his jawline.
Despite Harry vaguely knowing where this was headed, he still feels dread curling inside him at what is yet to come.
“Then how’d you break your leg?” When Harry glances back up at the dragon skull mask, it’s turned away from him.
like a vampire!” He turns a charming, normal smile on one of the Aurors. “Surely you can see that, sir.” Then he places his gaze back on the window as if pleading with those on the other side to see the absurdity as well.
“We were out on a date. A night Quidditch match. It’d been fun. Invited my date home—not here, a flat, my flat—for drinks. Guess they had another drink in mind.” Potter lets out a humorless chuckle.
For a while, neither of them move, sizing one another up. Draco imagines Potter to be having a better time of it than he is. He can probably hear the pounding of Draco's heart from across the room.
Potter shakes his head when Draco twists his neck to look at him. “Probably less scary like this, honestly.”
“I thought you wouldn’t come. Why did you?” The dead tone in which Paper Dracon speaks spooks Harry.
“I’d like to do you one better.” Harry reaches up and removes his own mask from his face, placing it on the balcony railing beside his drink.
His gut twists. Before he can stop himself, Harry says, “We’ve been fighting one another for almost three years, and you don’t even know my alias?”
Quickly, Draco finishes up with Mr. Park by obtaining a sketch of the vampire, hardly looking at it before shoving it into his robes and trotting out after Potter.
“An utterly stupid, reckless idea,” Hermione muttered a week later as she toiled over her broiling cauldron. “Are you
Blaizing Fire falls back into his chair, leaving Harry to wonder when he’d started leaning forward in the first place.
As Harry stumbles backwards, an explosion echoes outside the barrier. He pulls some of the lightning Hermione created to himself, sending a small shock to Dracon’s hand when he goes to release more paper puppets.
Harry and Ron shift to block Hermione from the villains’ view as she brandishes a leather-bound book and a worn blue pen. She places the tip onto the page and begins to write where she left off.
“Are—Are you certain you’re able to fight right now?” She no doubt recalls how the group of escaping heroes had to drag him outside.
“Yeah, but you didn’t leave me here to fight elsewhere.” At least Harry doubts he did since the rain would limit Dracon’s ability for movement.
“Don’t forget,” Harry says. “It’s not really us who faces the most danger here. The Agency doesn’t have our identities. Maybe the burden of patrolling the city should go to us younger heroes while the older ones lie low.”
With care, Harry turns around, studiously keeping his gaze averted from Paper Dracon pinned to the far wall.
Draco stands on the stoop of Grimmauld. While he knows Potter would probably invite him inside, part of him figures they’d get caught up in conversation or get offered tea and cake by Potter’s elf. It’s truly best to not get held up. One loses both time and nerve that way.
you, Potty.” Ghost-Malfoy clapped his hands in delight, though only a whisper of sound reached Harry. As he floated there, the three little peachicks fluttered up through the floorboards as well, with one circling Draco’s ankles, the second traveling unwillingly towards the ceiling, and the third bopping about the room.
“Hey, just because I’m a Supervillain doesn’t mean I lie about everything. If I did, it would make it that much harder to trick my enemies, right?”
Draco cocks his head and fixes his gaze on a point in the dark, his best guess for where Potter’s eyes would be. “Well,
“I know you didn’t mean to, Harry, but you mentioning his hero name to her probably left her really upset. I mean, she must have taken it hard to have been gone for almost three years.”
Instead of an acerbic reply like Harry expected, Malfoy just gave her a tight nod and moved back against a hedge that lined the drive. By the flush in her cheeks, Harry surmised that Hermione was surprised too.
Harry didn’t have a cold enough heart to tell her the truth, so he pointed a little off to her left. “Around there.”
Ron jolts backwards from where he’s glaring a hole into the villain’s under-mask. “What? I thought we were going to ask him what the hell he and his mates were doing yesterday?!”
“Yeah, pretty much figured that!” Ron shouts as he dodges the Thatcher statue’s attempt to tackle him. “He’s bloody well trying to poke out my eye.”
Shaking himself a little, Justin plasters a smile on his face. “Oh, yeah. Thanks, again. For helping me out.”
The dust from the debris is so thick—and so many of the lights knocked out—that they can’t distinguish between friend and foe in the chaotic fray before them.
Spinning on his heel, Harry heads the opposite direction. He’s nearly at the mouth of the alleyway when a shout comes from behind him.
Quick as he can manage, Harry picks back up Dracon’s costume pile and shoves it as his face when Harry turns back to face him.
When Harry opens the door after that one, he comes across a large drawing room more elaborate in decor than the dining hall. Yet he is not afforded time to take in many details as his eyes focus on several cloaked figures sitting throughout the room.
A hero off to the side rushes up and hits him in the head with a food dish. “Off with you, villain! Haven’t you lot done enough?”
After twenty minutes of Malfoy skirting their questions and the three peachicks growing steadily more agitated, Ron huffed out, “How about you just tell us where your body is, and we’ll puzzle out the rest?”
“I said, I doubt whether you’d actually trust the outcome of an official match, wherein we’re both equals, to the Snidgets I so easily bribed before.”
Blaizing Fire has a curious tilt to his head, and Harry pushes away the sensation that he’s being studied.
“Like you have room to judge! I saw you save a cat from a tree two weeks ago!” Paper Dracon leans on a rubbish bin for support. How he thought he could get away with that limp—hell, how he’s already managed to get away with that limp—Harry will never know. “Talk about cliché, hero!”
Harry blinks and suffers from an immediate lightheadedness. He doesn’t think that he sways. But he must have, for Dracon steadies him.
“Tsk! Potter, do you really know nothing about ghosts? You’ve only lived with one as a House mascot for seven years.” At Harry’s blank look, Draco continued, “It takes time, after death, for a ghost to pull enough energy from the world around us to develop visibility to the living. For the first several weeks, we are nothing but a mere gust of wind, a cold draft of thought, clinging to a world no longer ours.”
“I mean, I know you said before that it’s not good to be useless with your lot, but—it’s just.” Well, since he already opened his mouth, best to finish the thought. “Why would you come to a battle knowing you’d be deadweight?”
“How about you tell me how you came to be in that building that night?” Harry flips open the notepad and holds his pen at the ready.
Although, with how long he’s been waiting for the host to show, he may just only never see Potter again.
They stop just outside the viewing range of the mirror hanging on the wall, Potter halting their progress. “What’re you doing, Malfoy?”
Exhaustion starts creeping into Harry’s bones, but he knows that to fall asleep right now would be tantamount to falling asleep in subzero weather. Dracon’s body starts to weigh more on his as he starts to succumb, too.
Harry sets his utensils down. “Well, for the most part it was regular patrol stuff. Helped out at some robbery scenes, stopped a Tube derailment, saved some folks.” Harry shrugs. “The usual.”
Draco also gives him a world of Gryffindor credit for meeting him after dark. As he approaches Potter, his hands sweat in his gloves despite the sharp chill in the air. Even now, uncertainty causes his steps to falter. “Potter, good to see you.” He flashes him a smile and hopes his nerves don’t show.
Dracon’s voice cracks as he tries to speak. He clears his throat and tries again. “Yeah, I hadn’t deluded myself with a future with that hero—never even got to see what color his eyes were. Still . . . .” His voice turns wistful. “It made for such a nice dream. I suppose I should have known I was ruined then.”
The fact that his mother had gotten away should have cheered Draco up, however, the benefits of such news were offset by the disappearance of yet another one of Draco’s peachicks. Together, he and Harry scrounged the garden for it, while the last peachick dozed in Draco’s chest. Failing to uncover where the little thing could have wandered off too, a despondent Draco demanded Harry leave for home and allow him his solitary sulk.
work as intended and even if it does, Astral Projection carries risks.” She stopped stirring and turned fully to face Harry. “I think it’s lovely, what you’re trying to do for Draco, but you need to ask yourself whether the worst case scenario is worth it all.”
Out of the corner of Harry’s eye as he twists slightly to look towards him, he sees Ron raise himself up as if pushing toward the surface from underwater. His hand lifts a second later, aiming for something beyond the pew, seemingly as equally as slow to Harry.
“Yeah, I find that nearly impossible to believe. You’ve always jumped at the chance to see me miserable. Hell, you’re like a bloodhound—”
“Excellent.” Alpha Bee ushers Hermione and Ron out the door. “Some other heroes will come in a little later to return you to your holding cell, Mr. Fire.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked as they began their long freefall back to Earth. “This was supposed to be your last regret. Should I have let you win? Did I do this all wrong?”
“Fair and—!” Harry whipped his head around to face Draco, bringing them nose to nose. Almost like old times. “They’re
“O-oh.” Harry doesn’t quite succeed in muffling his laugh and pays for it with a glare from Ron. “Yeah, they’d probably have it locked, considering who we’ve got in there.”
has been so forgiving of Harry’s recent odd behavior, Harry decides to let Paper Dracon, Blazing Fire, and the case of stolen hero identities slide to the back of his mind. He shifts full attention to the mechanical arm before them and scans his memories of that night to see if its presence clicks into place. Unfortunately, he’s left feeling uncertain about whether he had seen any kind of robot that night, the suggestive image threatening to distort the integrity of his recollection.
Apart from being in multiple pieces now, what Harry had observed about the mechanical arm remains true. Now, the wiring is in smaller pieces and completely ripped apart in others. Smaller bits of the grey metal litter a good portion of the box’s inside.
“Now,” he throws a glance at Harry, “that isn’t to say we should leave everything up to them. We, too, are required to put our best efforts forth. But that said, we can’t fret over what has yet to pass while the present stares us directly in the face.” He pats Cho on the back.
, all powers have their limits.” Her head turns away from him, showing off the long sharpness of her mask’s beak. No doubt her mind strays to the many failed incidents where she’s tried and failed to heal his scar—before it could stretch down his whole body when powering up.
Through a determined effort, Harry’s hands don’t falter. “I was only asking. You’re not obligated to answer.”
Nails biting into his hands through the gloves, Harry starts marching in the direction he thinks they would have headed. “They can’t have got that far! Come on, guys.”
Drawing herself up, she says, “This had better not be one of your nasty deceits, villain.” Still, the hope of freedom is too much for her and wins out over her caution.
. We’ll hold off on that until the three of you are well rested.” The ease comes back into his mouth and eyes. “Now go tell the police what you know.”
He leaves before he hears any more. The point of the matter isn’t why the villains want the heroes’ identities, but rather
Harry’s not really sure who’s doing the avoiding here, but he’s not about to self-reflect. “Well, I was raised in my aunt’s house on my mother’s side; while they weren’t all that flattering about her, they were even less so about my father—when they even bothered to bring him up that is. I’d found some of my Mum’s memorabilia stored away, so I feel like I have a way to hold onto her. But I wanted something that connected me to my father, and “ sort of found that in a postcard in my Mum’s collection—sent to her when he was away from the United Kingdom visiting family.”
“I was mistaken. Or at least exaggerated it a little.” He looks down again while his right hand rubs at the back of his neck. “The vampire—it only really grazed me. So it’s not—that’s not really an
From the moment he met him, Harry knew that Draco Malfoy had terminally caught pretension from an early age. As it stood, judging by the ghost sitting at his kitchen table with the ankle of one leg resting on the knee of the other, arms crossed against his chest, and two ghostly baby peacocks fluttering around him, death had not managed to disinfect him of this affliction. All Harry had wanted was a glass of milk from the fridge to pretend it would keep the nightmares from the War at bay, tricking himself into finally falling asleep, but like peace and solitude, rest was apparently too much to ask for.
Feeling light-headed, Harry goes to speak but catches himself at the last second. He may have revealed his face to Blaizing Fire, but that doesn’t mean he needs his voice too. Instead, Harry takes back up the pen and notepad in shaking hands. He writes:
robot. But the real treasure he finds are the letters demanding Kevin report to specific Villain Agency bases. One, they so helpfully name, the Mother Base, and it’s located in Kensington.
Sneaking into the Villain Agency’s main base goes without a hitch. Considering they had two pro heroes scope out the place for a few days, the success shouldn’t come as a surprise. But the Hero Order has gotten used to being out-maneuvered by the Villain Agency over the past few weeks.
Harry hates how gentle her voice sounds. “Yeah, I’m sure. I’m also sure that I now know why he looked so banged up that night I found him.”
Once he’s near, Harry lifts the sheet enough to get a glimpse of a full mechanical form before he drops it again. A shudder passes through him.
“For you, of course! We’ve covered mostly all your final regrets, except we’ve never managed to get that Seekers’ game right. I mean, what, with you bribing the Snidgets and all. Now, though, them cheating for you is going to be just a bit harder.”
it yet.” Draco sucks in a breath and tries not to think how much easier it is to say this to someone he can’t look in the eye. “I’ve always reacted negatively to what makes me uncomfortable—other magical beings, Muggle-borns,
Sitting bolt upright with a gasp—a move that severely agitates his head injury—Harry’s hands fly to his face. The tension leaves his back and shoulders upon finding his mask still in place.
Draco starts walking before he realises Potter isn’t beside him. Turning around he spots him standing in the shade of a shop overhang. He clucks his tongue on the roof of his mouth, waves his wand, and casts an umbrella charm. Another whispered spell and the translucent shield sprouting from his wand tip becomes opaque.
“Oh, I see.” Dracon tries to situate his body in a more dignified pose while still stuck to the bin. “You got tired of me always getting away, and now you decide to try your hand at being a
The villain remains silent for so long that Harry suspects he hadn’t heard. Just as Harry is about to ask again, he says, “Basically over. After you knocked out Blaise and his squad, most of the Agency felt no need to stay. The rain put the fire out, though it’s much harder to say whether the charred parts will continue holding up.”
“You might want to sit down for this.” Harry helps guide Dracon as he slides down the wall until he’s seated on the ground.
Nodding to one another, he and Ron dart completely out from behind the pew. They both have their arms raised but come up short upon seeing the empty House of Lords.
I didn't apply hover text to every single alias every time it appears. However, a good bet on whether an alias has hover text would be when it appears for the first time in the narrative or chapter (beyond Chapter 2), it hasn't appeared in awhile, or there aren't sufficient enough context clues for the reader to infer who it is. For more obvious aliases (Like Paper Dracon, for example), hover text is applied only once—the first time their alias appears in the text beyond this point.

Once he grows calm enough that his skin and hair stop sparking, and the jagged lines on the body of his suit that follow the pattern of the scars that lay underneath cease glowing, Harry creeps out from behind the building. He sneaks across the empty street until the ditch where he’d seen the flash of white comes back into view. At this point, he’s approaching on his hands and knees, forcing away thoughts of what the police could accuse him of now if they ever catch him like this.
