He’d just said it plainly, out of the blue. He’d looked sideways at Harry as they walked and said, “I love you.”
Fuck, this was not the way to start a day. Harry looked quite troubled, just sitting with his elbows on his thighs, staring at that chair. And Draco was under the covers prattling on about how much he enjoyed telling Harry's ex off—wasn't altogether sensitive, was it? When clearly Harry was still hurting over the twat.
Draco leaned over to kiss his mouth, just for a bit. But the film interrupted with a proper song—a bloke singing some sort of background information, so Draco broke away from the kiss so they could watch. Harry didn’t want them to miss this, after all.
'You need to buy some souvenirs,' Harry announced, setting off for the shop they'd just nearly passed.
Harry pulled away from his mouth to get a look at his face—which just made Malfoy frown. “What! No you don’t!”
Buildings were passing them by, but it didn't necessarily feel like they were moving fast. Draco was … was feeling safe, despite what he might've predicted otherwise.
,’ Draco hissed, his cheeks looked a bit pink. He turned to Harry, and said, seriously, ‘Harry, I like you, but you should never have come here.’
They walked out, past their fellow Gryffindors playing Exploding Snap, reading, studying, or just talking in the common room, and climbed out.
As usual, Harry and Hermione had settled into a couple stuffed chairs in the back corner, a bit away from everyone else. It felt private. But this time Harry had trouble concentrating on what Hermione was saying. He was trying not to stare across the room at Draco Malfoy, who was very quietly reading a thick book by the hearth. Malfoy tucked a strand of white-blond hair behind an ear, and turned a page.
“Yeah, yeah,” Malfoy interrupted, rolling his eyes. “I don’t need to hear it.” And then he smiled. Properly smiled. With eyes going all soft.
So, Draco did as he was told, and shuffled over so that he had Harry’s cock right in his face, and his own in Harry’s. He propped his head up with one hand so that he was properly aligned. Harry took his cock by the hand first, and tentatively licked at the tip. Draco involuntarily let out a guttural noise, and thrust his hips out, just a bit. Harry’s tongue... Fuck.
Malfoy cast a glance at him over his shoulder. ‘Well, your appointment is at eleven, mine’s at half-eleven. After that ... lunch? Then I suppose we figure it out from there.’
Weasley looked around and, seeing that they were alone, breathed in deep. “Okay, so, don’t hurt Harry, alright? He’s more fragile than he lets on. He’s lost a lot of people over the years... and his childhood wasn’t great.”
'Everyone needs vacation photos,' he said, most decidedly, and took long strides to catch up to him.
‘I couldn’t get work, couldn’t get an apprenticeship anywhere. I looked everywhere for something, even minding a shop, but all I found were closed doors.’
“Alright, everyone! Follow me!” said Professor Flitwick, holding his now-dormant umbrella Portkey high in the air.
He stepped around his desk, and made for the door. He paused with his hand on the handle. 'Will you come? Please?'
Harry put his quill down for a moment, and switched hands. He wanked himself hard and fast, with mind full of Draco’s arse, his nakedness, his body underneath him. Fuck, this was … this was so good. But …
Draco took a breath, and then descended into the thing. A metal box on wheels. The seat was comfortable enough, and the inside smelled of vanilla. Harry shut the door gently and walked around the other side.
Molly and Arthur greeted everyone as they came in. Harry hovered over to the side near a tree, just watching the goings-on. He wasn’t feeling terribly social, and knew that Ron and Hermione were busy in the kitchen, and Ginny was at the food table. The others were probably talking to guests already, or going around inviting people to the Quidditch game.
And then it was just the two of them, again. Okay, this was all a bit weird, just standing in Luna’s front room, alone. And apparently there were Muggles somewhere.
Harry was turned on his side, facing Draco’s profile. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he could just make out Draco’s features, from scraps of moonlight that had escaped past the curtains. His chest felt warm—like ... like his heart was full. ‘When did you figure out you were gay?’ he asked softly.
Harry laid his head down on top of hers. ‘Thank you.’ He meant it. Then, he straightened up and went back to his eggs.
Draco raised his eyebrows, as he simultaneously realised Pansy was rocking side to side a bit. “I’ve been with you the whole time. Pansy...” he lowered his voice. “Are you drunk? Off two drinks?”
He fiddled with the knobs of the shower until it was the right temperature, then he shucked his clothes and climbed in. The water poured over him from head to toe, and he swiped a hand over his face, to flip his hair out of his eyes.
'Besides, you're clearly exhausted and not thinking straight.' She stood up and looked between them, raising her voice to normal volume as she said, 'I'm dismissing you. You're unfit to work. Go back to your flat and have a rest.' She turned on Harry. 'Harry, where are you staying while you're in London?'
Harry shot him an amused look, and arranged himself under the covers, with his head against the pillow.
'Okay,' Harry said gently. 'I don't think I snore or anything. Sometimes I have nightmares, but they've become more rare lately. After therapy.' He shot Draco a smile.
Smiling wistfully, Draco did not turn his face away from the water. ‘I hope they can. Though I’ve never seen it.’
“Candelabra,” Draco repeated, deadpan, and Harry had to suppress a laugh. He gave his head a little shake, then said, “Can I meet her?”
‘You haven’t changed at all, then! Is that it?’ Harry continued. ‘Despite everything? Despite the war—despite what it did to your family? Despite everyone else making an effort to be decent to each other? No … you’re still the same bully you always were.’ He searched those cold grey eyes, and found nothing. No remorse. No reaction. They just stared back at him.
“Here,” Ron said, coming up beside Harry and grabbing the bottle away from him, giving a few solid twists and getting farther than Harry had.
‘Draco was just teaching him a lesson. He didn’t hurt him though! Draco just wanted to stick up for me, you know?’
After letting out a long-suffering sigh, Draco said, “No. Thank you. I’ll just take off the sock.” He sighed again. “Come here, I need your shoulder for balance.”
'I've received your vacation photos.' She put a hand over her mouth, and her eyes seemed to sparkle, even in the flames. 'They are so bloody precious.'
Malfoy dropped the sphere like it’d burned him, and it rolled down the table, past Harry. It was a pearly-pink and much larger than any pearl he’d ever seen, Harry noted, wide-eyed as it rolled past.
Harry shut his eyes, took a breath, then opened them. ‘What could you do?’ he asked quietly. ‘Fight a whole room of Death Eaters, along with your parents, and Voldemort?’ He shook his head slowly.
Weasley sauntered over with a bunch of metal sticks in one hand, and a big plastic bag in the other. He seemed to eye the lack of space in between them with a frown, but handed them both a stick anyhow.
'Mm,' Draco uttered again, opening his mouth and letting that pink tongue out to swipe across Harry's bottom lip.
, you know? You could cure the uncurable, or create better ways of doing things. I don’t know, there’s loads of possibilities.”
And then, Draco was crying out, with his mouth open, and hands grasping onto Harry’s skin. His body pulsated with orgasm, shooting hot ejaculate inside of Harry’s body.
That blush deepened. Merlin, it was … cute. Harry didn’t say that though—it'd probably make the situation much more awkward.
Well … he liked her, certainly, didn’t he? Sometimes, anyhow. She worked a lot, and talked a lot about work, and petty work drama that didn’t interest Harry in the least. They hardly seemed to speak about anything else, lately. But that wasn’t really Ginny’s fault entirely … with being confined to desk duty at work meant there wasn’t really much for Harry to talk about anyhow.
Harry swirled his tongue around, feeling him, savouring him. He sucked Malfoy in deeper. Letting the cock graze against the ridges of the roof of his mouth. Merlin … Malfoy’s cock in his mouth … It was amazing. He sucked him deeper, right to the back of his throat.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He looked out at the treeline. The moment felt charged, felt strange. He could hear his own heartbeat, he could hear the wind rustling in the trees above his head.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to picture 11-year-old Draco secretly looking up homosexuality in the Hogwarts library. It was … a surprisingly cute image, it made him smile. He opened his eyes. ‘Hang on, what did your father and Blaise say?’
This place was outdoors, so they had a refreshing breeze to go along with the music, and Draco could glance up anytime to admire the moon and a spattering of stars. It was lovely. They probably didn’t have anything like this back in London.
illegal in this country—and I don’t fancy getting arrested. Though the chances of anyone barging in are—’
you. And I don't expect everything to be, like, mind-blowing at first or anything. There's always a period of learning, I think, when you're getting to know each other's bodies and what you each like—because everyone's a bit different in that department. You know?'
He palmed himself through his pyjama bottoms. He thought of her again, perched on a desk, in a long black dress with a slit between the legs, her long legs crossed, hanging off the edge.
‘Mmhmm,’ Harry answered. Draco was going to be there, and Pansy. Dean. Seamus. Luna. All the same people, presumably.
Draco suppressed a ‘thank you’, thinking it might not go over well. Silence was safest—that was usually his personal motto these days.
Without lifting his face off the pillow, Draco picked up the plastic head/mouth bit and brought it near his face, scowling.
Right. Harry turned and strode a few steps forward. Ah, and he should fish out those tickets from his coat pocket before they get to the front.
This was a bit strange, wasn’t it? It’d all felt like a whirlwind. A lovely, very fun whirlwind, sure. But Harry was still hurting, and Draco didn’t know if there was anything more he should say on it. Or … or if it was better to keep quiet and let Harry bring it up, if he wanted.
So Harry enlisted Robert Singh, Third Year Ravenclaw, to knock on Malfoy’s door the next day, during office hours.
Seriously, she wasn’t even going to follow him? She’d only have to stand there while he did the talking. Harry looked at her a beat, realising she was very serious, so he pulled himself up and went to find Malfoy.
Sure, Malfoy had been annoyed and tight-lipped with him. But that was just normal for them, wasn’t it?
“It is,” Draco answered, fidgeting with his hands on his lap. “I find it fascinating to read what Muggles can dream up about magic. It’s always so unique and inventive.”
They sat out in chairs by the lake; Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron together. It was a beautiful summer’s day: the sun was shining bright amidst fluffy clouds and blue sky, it shone over the vibrant green grass, and sparkling, still lake. The merpeople sang. Someone Harry didn’t know spoke a eulogy. Dumbledore’s body was entombed, and arrows were fired into the air.
‘Moira says we can space out our sessions by two weeks now. She thinks I don’t need weekly anymore,’ Draco said with a soft smile, before bringing his cup up to his lips.
‘Can we … hug? It’s … it’s a Hufflepuff thing.’ She wrinkled her nose. ‘They’re rubbing off on me, you see.’
Harry yawned, squinting at the weather report on his mobile. Nice. It’d be 14 degrees and sunny around mid-day. He could have a good long sit on his balcony, enjoy some sun.
This Draco Malfoy certainly did not love him. Harry had been so stupid to come here. Draco had probably sent him those things to tease him, or trick him, or drive him mad. And it’d worked.
She barked out a laugh. 'Fat chance, there. I imagine after an hour we'd both be ripping our hair out. No, I'm signing you up for a class—one of those classes full of grannies. You'll love it.'
Harry’s mind reeled. Which blokes in Slytherin were gay? He couldn’t think of a single one. It wasn’t Malfoy, Malfoy had dated Pansy. And he was pretty sure it wasn’t Blaise Zabini, with all the flirting with females Harry’d witnessed. Theo Nott maybe? Or a Seventh Year?
'Right, yeah. Well ... before I got the pamphlet, I met Nils at a club next to the place I'd been staying at. I thought he was handsome, smooth, confident and … and I ended up back at his.'
Potter blinked at him. “Why should I believe you?” He asked like he really needed to know the answer.
His Mind Healer over the summer had urged him to keep a diary, a journal, but he hadn't wanted to. After all, what happened, had ... happened. There was nothing left to say about it. And he didn't want to dwell on the past. He didn't really want to dwell on the present much either. Or the future, while we're at it. But she had insisted, said it was good to get his thoughts out and acknowledge them. Now the summer was coming to a close, and here was his chance to purchase one before the days got too busy with schoolwork and friends and things. If he waited any longer, he’d never buy one at all.
He felt so connected … so in love with the Earth at that very moment … So profoundly blessed to be there, in the moment, with the man that he … well, had loved for a very long time.
‘Okay, bye Harry!’ She said, releasing him and spinning around to run off with her braid flapping behind herself.
He took a sip of Firewhisky, staring at the flames. And then he went to lower the cup to rest on his lap, but Potter intercepted it midway, prying it out of Draco’s hands—brushing their fingers together in the process. It gave him goose bumps on the back of his neck.
He sighed and looked around, rubbing absently at the centre of his chest. Luckily, he spotted Pansy and Blaise at a four-person table. He made his way over to sit with them.
That’d been his immediate reaction. Just, no. He searched her eyes, finding no hint of a joke there.
She reached out to grab it, and at the moment the paper would’ve touched her hand (had she been alive), she and the noted disappeared.
A waiter came by, and Draco ordered, but could barely concentrate. Weasley? And Blaise? What exactly did ‘getting along’ mean? And when did that start?
Harry, on the other hand, was fiddling with his hands in his lap and not knowing what to do with himself.
Malfoy leaned down to kiss him. It was lazy, slow, and soft. Gentle. God … Malfoy had such lovely lips. Afterwards, he pulled back to fumble around for his wand, and then he cast Scourgify on them both.
Harry tried to right himself, his eyes began to adjust to the darkness. He could see the soft cotton curtains. A mahogany bedpost. He’s in his bed. ‘I’m okay, Ron, just a nightmare,’ he managed to utter. ‘Go back to sleep.’
‘Girls,’ Harry emphasized. ‘I will let you know if I find out who the sender is, alright? In the meantime, you can stop ambushing me.’
To distract himself from thinking about that disturbing thought any longer, he read what his journal-mate had wrote. But his mind was a half-drunk confused cloud of post-ejaculation haze; it was hard to concentrate on anything.
Then he settled onto his laptop, and did a bit of work. He wanted to get better at this whole "power point" thing that everyone was talking about. He had a presentation with senior staff next week, and he wanted to make some jazzy for them to look at while he talked.
The gum-cracker leaned on the shelf beside him. Draco closed his eyes for a beat, took a breath, then turned to look at her.
Draco’s tattoo really was lovely. And he deserved to be freed from all that darkness—the fear, the impossible burdens placed on his shoulders, the knowledge that if he failed in his task his family could be killed. Now … now his arm was something beautiful. It told a story, not of inservitude to a deranged fascist any longer, but of rebirth and renewal. Change … for the better, and by choice.
He nodded. ‘So you think marrying a woman first …' He hated it. But it wasn’t his place to, he reminded himself. Again.
Draco didn’t know her. But she’d clearly been a student, she was still wearing her uniform. Fourth or fifth year, he’d guess, with long hair pulled up in a knot atop her head.
Memories of the Manor from last year threatened to surface, pushing against his mind. But he wasn’t ready to let them through, not now, or he might end up hyperventilating on the floor.
Potter led them down the hunter-green carpeted hallway towards their room, not saying anything. Not complaining or tossing insults out loud, yet, thankfully. Though maybe he was so pissed off he couldn’t find the words.
So, Draco got up and made his way to the drink table. Weasley was stood there, speaking with MacMillan now. He eyed Draco with obvious wariness, but it was better than outright disdain, Draco figured.
Harry shrugged as he turned a corner to head for the stairs going down into the square. “Not really.”
Sighing softly to himself, he climbed out the bed. He needed to get ready, and make sure all of his things were packed, after all.
The next day, Harry went shopping to one of those expensive specialty chocolate shops. He picked out a box that had an assortment—one the saleswoman said was a popular gift.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, and, not knowing what else to do, rubbed gently in an up/down motion.
Harry smiled, a bit sadly, and scratched absently at his beard. “Nah. Ginny and I just broke up. I’m … going through it.”
“Yeah, I think it’s much more than that.” He spun around to face her, feeling his heart pound in his chest. Was this it? Was this possibly going to be the end?
'Ah. Well don't let anyone pressure you. Ruben can get a bit pushy about taking shots with him,' he said as they turned right, and walked past a small supermarket, displaying baskets of colourful fruits out front.
‘Oh. Thank you,’ Harry said, blinking rapidly as his body relaxed. ‘So, yeah. I may’ve fought. And it probably wouldn’t have been the smartest move. So … so don’t compare yourself to me. I’m sure that most seventeen-year-olds wouldn’t be able to do anything in a room full of Death Eaters, a room with Voldemort in it.’
A group of Fourth Years walked in, through the door that Malfoy was still holding open. They tossed Harry and Malfoy curious looks, on their way to their desks.
Harry sighed heavily, and then resumed his marking. He had better things to think about than one professor’s conspiracy theories. And better things to think about than what Draco Malfoy chooses to do with his own property.
Harry tucked his chin in, and danced close—rocking and contracting in time to the music. Draco could feel the heat off his body, the warm breath ghosting over his cheek.
Oddly, there was a video posted about a week or so after Draco left Ibiza, and the videos previously posted were roughly eight months earlier. He'd taken a long break, then.
'Yeah, um, the Phoenicians were here first—building a city on the hill, making a port out of it. In 7th century B.C.E., that is. Then the Romans came in, er, 2nd century B.C.E., or was it C.E.? I think B.C.E. The Byzantines came later. And then, in—ah the 13th century,
about it. Even though that was terribly selfish of him, wasn’t it? Sure, Harry wanted Draco to be happy. He just didn’t want to have to
“I’m not worried, Draco.” She stood up and walked over to him, sitting on the arm of his chair. “You’re just talking to a straight man who is engaged, right?”
The dam finally burst and he began to cry. His whole body shook with it, like the grief was being ripped right out of him. He cried from loss, but it was also for freedom.
Malfoy looked over his shoulder at Harry’s approaching friends, then back at Harry. ‘I just wanted to remind you,’ he said hurriedly, ‘not to die.’
Malfoy nodded slowly, still staring at Harry. He cleared his throat, and tore his eyes away. “Ah, well, best get back to work.”
Emails, texts, voicemails, Muggle letters, can all wait. Until it’s convenient. Until you’ve slept the required number of hours after a night out.
She frowned at him. "Swear to me that you don't have any feelings for Malfoy. And then swear you won't speak to him again. No more contact, no more
Shrugging, Harry relented, 'I just don't like it. The attention, the expectations. I don't want them.' He sighed and kneaded the dough a little more gently. 'Anyway, I hate to bring up tea towels again but have you got any clean ones?'
Harry let out a shaky breath, and studied Hermione’s face. She looked well. She looked healthy. “I was worried about you.” And then his face crumpled. Fuck.
‘Harry … you work full-time at Hogwarts. I work … in places like this. In very dangerous places, at times. For months on end. So, what, we can write letters that take weeks to be received? That’d be it, at best.’
'No,' Harry said quickly. 'Well, kind of. I guess I'd forgotten some mates and I had plans to go out tonight. But we do this every Saturday, so it's not really a big deal to skip one, really. I'll see them next week.'
'The naan is lovely,' Draco said, as he sopped up some vindaloo sauce. 'Nothing like fresh, warm bread, is there?'
Astoria and Draco were having a nice lunch of tomato soup and cheese sandwiches, when an owl arrived at their window, rapping its talon against the pane. Draco brushed crumbs off onto his trousers, and got up to receive the mail.
“I guess,” Harry said, nonchalantly, sitting on the bed a few feet away from Draco and the cat. He watched them for a bit. The cat flopped over on her back.
There she was; he sat up on the edge of the bed to look at her. Tiny and only wearing a strapless white bra, and white knickers. Draco swallowed. He loved her, he knew this to be true in his very soul. He could do this.
“I fell asleep on you?” Potter added. “I lent you my hoodie? I sat with you by the fire? We had a whole conversation about how Ron was afraid you might hurt me if you were my boyfriend and you assured me you would not?”
Shaking his head, Draco followed. He wasn't aware vacationing came with set rules—photographs and souvenirs. It wasn't as if he were here for Ibiza itself, no matter how nice it’d ended up being.
He looked so different from when Draco had last seen him—he dressed like a London businessman, not an Ibizan DJ.
Draco turned to look at Harry over his shoulder, his eyes dropping to the package in Harry’s hand. ‘Dried white mulberries.’
Harry bit his lip, saying simply, “Okay.” And he did—he wrapped his fingers around him properly, and he stroked, thumbing over the tip.
. ‘Thank you … for saying those things. I do feel more at peace, I think. The most at-peace I’ve ever been, really. And the most myself I know how to be.’
It was time to undress—God, it was time to undress. He tugged at Malfoy’s clothes, and he had too much of them, too many layers. He fumbled with buttons, tugged off the Quidditch scarf and the blue tie, pushed articles of clothing to the floor as he went along, until they were both shirtless, and Malfoy was pressing his incredible skin against Harry’s chest.
He shook his head, looking off to the side, silently asking the blank wall beside them for answers. He shrugged.
Harry nodded. His eyes seemed so big, so green in this light. 'Yeah, I can send them to you through her.'
He untied his mail from the owl—this time it was a parcel. His mind raced at wondering what it might contain.
“Yeah, I tested it out after dinner. I mean... it’s not pure Muggle, there’s definitely some magic going on to allow it to work.” Harry reached for Draco’s hand, which had been resting on his lap. “So...” he started, moving their joined hands onto Harry’s lap instead. “Remember how we couldn’t pay attention to the movie last time?”
With hands shoved in his shorts’ pockets, Potter asked, ‘What have you been up to?’ And he’d asked it rather casually, Draco thought. As if they hadn’t seen each other for a month, at most.
. It was a name he turned over and over in his head but hadn’t yet said out loud. And now he knew Draco was alive and safe.
He looked around the room, and hummed thoughtfully. Taking his wand out of his pocket, he spelled his table and chairs flush against the wall. He moved the sofa to the side too.
When he got back to the common room, his eyes were drawn to Potter. He was leaning forward, head resting on his hands, staring into the fire. Strangely, Draco’s eyes wandered past Potter, and locked with Granger, who was sending him a death-glare. Weasley, beside her, had a similar expression. Draco frowned. That seemed uncalled-for.
He had nothing to say. He and Draco were just friends. He had no way of explaining to Draco the actual truth—it'd ruin their friendship. And they’d only really just started it.
—any of what you’re worrying about right now happens,” Harry said, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Then I’ll tell you, okay? We’ll communicate and we’ll work it out. Together.”
Harry was beginning to feel rather foolish, expecting to get chewed out at any moment. Possibly shoved. Or worse.
He guided Malfoy out of the deserted row in a rush, and caught eye contact with a worker—a young girl with heaps of brown curly hair and a red and blue stadium uniform.
, and he smiled all lopsided and cute through his singing, '—I keep coming back for more. Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later, I get what I'm asking for.' You could hardly hear him over the music, but what Draco could hear sounded so
He couldn’t lose what they had. He wanted to get to have mental health weekends at Draco’s flat. He wanted to watch Kung Fu films and drink red wine. He wanted to get to cook for Draco, and write back and forth in their diaries.
“Didn’t that last one have something to do with a pickled toad?” she asked, wrinkling her nose. “Gross. As if I’d ever write something like that. I’m a bit offended you’d thought it was me.”
Harry wondered what Malfoy and Astoria were up to. Maybe they’d honeymooned someplace warm. Maybe Malfoy had gotten a sunburn. The thought made Harry snort out loud. Picturing Draco Malfoy on a beach was probably one of the oddest things he could imagine. Could Malfoy tan? Harry doubted it. Could Malfoy
Malfoy stared at him for a beat, his expression betraying nothing. But there was an intensity to him. “Alright.” He held out his hand.
Draco woke up with images of bare knees and sleepy smiles fresh in his mind. He remembered soft breath on his neck and curls on his jaw, and the echoes of
Draco had approached Harry afterwards, looking worn out, drained, sickly and much-too-thin. He’d extended a hand out, mirroring that first day on the Hogwarts Express. And, again, Harry had refused it. Because 4 words spoken out of uncertainty in the Manor, and an extended hand after a trial, could not possibly make up for everything else.
Draco's hand fumbled around in the sheets until it found its target—Harry's crotch. Draco held Harry's cock and balls through the pyjama fabric, just held him there in his palm.
Merlin. Maybe Pansy’s scheme had been a gift, in a sense. He and Potter would’ve never spoken like this otherwise. It’d been... well,
Pansy was well in her rights, as was Harry. But it still made him feel like he'd been left out of something. Ah well. Best not to dwell.
Draco began to notice that Harry was sliding lower and lower, becoming more horizontal as the movie went on.
Anyway! Feel free to yell at me about how I lured you in with the "party games" and "spin the bottle" tags, only to spectacularly let you down lol
‘Feeling sentimental, I s’pose. Romance is in the air, and all that.’ He huffed a dry laugh at himself. ‘And if you’d said “no” to the dance, I would’ve dropped it.’
Just the memory of that night, brought an aching nostalgia he felt in his chest. Little fourteen-year-old Harry, in his little black and white robes, his hair a shaggy mess, and his longing glances at Cedric and Cho. Why couldn't Draco have just been … well, more aware of himself?
“Mother cried, father yelled,” Draco said, waving his fork around, and grimacing. “I told them a couple weeks ago.”
Right, the letter. Harry eyed the envelope in his hands, really seeing it now. It was addressed to ‘Harry Potter and guest’ in small, elegant cursive. He turned it over in his hands, and his eyes widened. The return sender, evidently, was ‘Malfoy’. Whether Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, or some other Malfoy—he did not know. Below the name was a carefully written address, one Harry didn’t recognize. It wasn’t the Manor.
‘What’s that?’ asked Neville, leaning closer to take a look, with dirty-blond waves partially obstructing Harry’s view.
. So what? Is that really a big deal? I don’t think so! People love each other all the time. It doesn’t matter. It just means I have eyes, you know, and ears, and … I don’t know. Who isn’t in love with you, anyway? I’m sure there’s a whole queue of people. Ugh. Okay, I’m going to my room. I hope you’re really fucking pleased with yourself now.’
Merlin, marriage was … marriage was not what he’d ever expected it to be. But, he wouldn’t change his for the world.
Wordlessly, Draco sat on his own bed. He fidgeted his hands for bit, before deciding to pick up his book.
Harry reached out and touched Draco’s arm through some kind of dark and fuzzy dressing robe. It felt like a real arm underneath the fabric. ‘Hmm.’ He began to blink a little faster. Was it possible that Draco was really on his bed?
He exhaled, slow. ‘No, you’re here now. Might as well lay it all out.’ He leaned over, and rubbed at his forehead. ‘I only wanted to talk. To apologise for every shitty thing I’d ever said and done. That’s all.’
“Just lie down, with your head over there,” Harry said, biting on his lip to keep from smiling too much. Merlin, he was perfect.
Harry had to laugh. He was watching Malfoy more than anyone else, then. And Malfoy seemed … genuinely happy his team won. He was all bouncy on his feet.
He was surprised to find that he’d already read the last entry. Where was the rest? What had happened
Harry drank the rest of his glass, and set it down on the table. He watched the film—or tried to, anyway.
Ah yes, he was in his Ibizan hotel room. And the offending noise-maker was that sodding Muggle telephone again.
He trembled in bed, his mind screaming at him that it might be true. Malfoy’s wounds could be reopening—they had no idea of what that spell truly did, after all. Malfoy could be dying, alone, at that very moment. Harry could still be
Frowning slightly, Draco didn’t say anything for a moment, as he stared straight out into the night. ‘I can learn from it, I s’pose.’
Of course it didn’t help any that, in addition to dealing with his mental illness, people—strangers mostly—wanted to talk to him, to touch him, to hug him, to ask him questions, to tell him
Harry sped up his movements, rocking his hips, while Draco’s grip on Harry’s thighs tightened. Draco moved a hand to Harry’s cock, ghosting over the sensitive skin there with his palm. His grip tightened on Harry’s shaft, causing a moan to escape from Harry’s mouth. It was bliss … that was the only way Harry could describe it. Then, Draco began pumping his hand in time to Harry’s movements.
Harry broke away from the kiss and knelt down. “Here, let me help you, darling,” Harry said, smirking good-naturedly, and then tied up Draco’s laces into a bow. “Alright?” he asked straightening up again.
The rapping got louder. Harry groaned again, and slid out of bed, groggily stumbling over to his bedroom window. He felt a bit dizzy, stood up too fast probably.
He thumbed one of the fuzzy leaves, lost in thought, when a knock on his door interrupted his musings. He walked the few lengths over to the door to open it.
Harry smiled, but it didn't have any joy in it. 'I think I'm just tired now. I was pretty broken up for a while, then I was angry, and now I … I just want to forget.'
'Sure,' Draco said, leaning forward in his seat to eye the little shops with canvas awnings, the display of colourfully beaded bracelets at one place, the hanging weaved bags at the next.
But, this year, focusing on this year. Harry sighed, and rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses. He didn’t quite believe it yet himself, but he told her, ‘We’ve been chatting, anonymously, in a magically-linked journal all this year so far. I found out this afternoon it’d been him on the other end, when I saw him with the other journal.’
“No problem. We’ll figure out the perfect date for you and Malfoy together.” He paused. “Never thought I’d say those words.”
“Well, kindly get on with it. Someplace else,” Malfoy said, waving his hand roughly in the direction of the Forbidden Forest.
Swallowing, Draco kept watching, and tried hard not to ogle. He was sure Harry Potter wouldn’t appreciate him ogling.
For someone with such hard edges, such hidden depths and a history of hurting and being hurt, Malfoy was surprisingly
. “We would’ve figured it out eventually, Ginny and I. But I’m glad it was now, that we didn’t waste any more time being unhappy.”
He got to see the un-gelled hair up close. It was even lighter in colour without hair gel, nearly white. It seemed soft.
Their eyes met, and there was something there, between them. A feeling of hope, perhaps ... of possibility—where hope and possibility had never existed before.
“The ghost couldn’t be the writer, you got that first poem—your valentine—in second year. Your ghost is too young. She wasn’t here yet.”
Draco broke away from the kiss, looking mildly annoyed. Harry turned to catch Ginny smirking at him. And then she winked.
Draco frowned. There it was again—computers. Were they really so bloody important? Civilisation had survived a very long time without them.
The door gave, and they tumbled inside. Malfoy maneuvered Harry’s back to be pressed up against the closed door. He lent in to him, pressed all of himself to all of Harry, working his hands up Harry’s shirt to feel bare skin.
So Harry scribbled in Moira’s details, then they said goodnight. He sincerely hoped that what he said had helped, even if only slightly. Harry wanted to be able to help, just as his journal-mate had already helped him.
Harry took one look at Ron and Ginny with their arms around a crying Molly, looked at Hermione and Arthur staring blankly into the fire, before turning to Draco.
. Do you know what it’s like to be afraid to love someone because you’re sure you’re just going to lose them?” Oh God.
“What.” Potter frowned with a furrowed brow. Merlin, he was cute when he was drunk and a bit pouty...
Next Harry dabbed lavender oil on the back of his neck, and onto each wrist. (“It’ll help calm you,” Hermione had said when she handed it to him). He took a deep sniff from his wrist. She was right, it was a calming smell.
Draco took a deep breath, and released it. ‘Well … I’ve been quite busy myself, and homosexuality is illegal in most countries I visit. Including this one.’
He climbed off the couch, mug in hand, and sat cross-legged on the floor by the tree. The DVD played on, but he didn't bother to pause it since he'd seen the film before, a bunch of times. Plus it was comforting to hear human voices even if they weren’t really around. God, he was pathetic, wasn’t he?
?” Malfoy demanded, interrupting their work in the third-floor corridor. He marched up to Harry, looking like he was nearing the end of his rope. “
Harry was thoughtful. ‘And … and are you going to do what your father wants? For you to, um, marry a woman?’
Draco conceded with a sigh. ‘I suppose that’s true. They have ready-made meals though, and crisps and biscuits. Milk for my tea. I came here in the summer, when I wasn’t ordering take-away.’
Draco started to walk towards the lifts. 'Wait. Sod it, I'm too tired to walk.' He whirled on Harry and asked, 'Side-Along?'
For a wild moment, he considered storming off and going back to Gryffindor. Like he’d done last time.
Draco laughed, and laughed. Tears welled up in his eyes. “Your love is an inspiration,” he repeated, breathlessly, making himself laugh again.
On the next video, Draco just moved how he wanted to move, and kept an eye on Potter’s dances. In a way … it was like they were dancing with each other.
‘I’ll miss you, I think.’ Draco blushed, though it was harder to make out in the blue early-morning light.
Draco exhaled. Fine. Time for a little honesty, then. ‘All right, Pansy figured it out. She has a laptap—lap
'You can sit on the bed if you want,' Draco said, sitting up to make room and eyeing the whole vacant half. 'It's quite large.'
He looked up to find Morgan looking down at him with an uncharacteristic fondness. Normally she was a bit exasperated with him.
When he got waist-deep, Draco dove under, wetting his face and hair. It did feel fucking brilliant on his tired muscles, on his skin—all of his skin. Refreshing, really; washing away all the dried sweat he’d likely accumulated from dancing so much.
He lifted his head, looking around the empty room, as memories returned to him. Gentle touches. The words, “I’ll miss you, I think.”
Potter pointed it at Draco’s head, surprising him. He caught Potter’s face in the mirror, he looked... mischievous. Not... not unkind.
He scrolled down further, and found heaps of comments—from Harry's many admirers, evidently. There were little yellow cartoon faces with hearts for eyes, people commenting that they'd danced along with Harry (so Draco wasn't special, there), people saying they'd missed him (same, Draco thought), people commenting on his energy, his wholesomeness.
He unfolded the paper to reveal a note from Minerva, telling him to come to her office immediately after his class finished. That was odd. Whatever it was couldn’t wait until after dinner?
‘The war hasn’t been easy on any of us.’ Malfoy turned his head, but not before Harry noticed him grimace.
'Well, hello all,' he looked from face to face, still uncertain. 'You all look lovely.' And they did—dressed in form-fitting short dresses, high heels, hair glossy and straightened, make-up done to the nines. 'Thank you all for letting me join you, that is … assuming Morgan even told you at all.'
They walked right on past a display of those hideous Christmas jumpers. “Er, just a moment,” he said to her.
Potter wasn’t very good at finishing his sentences, Draco thought. But he understood the meaning. “Part of my probation is seeing a Mind Healer once a week.”
Harry moved a hand to tuck a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. Like they were that familiar with each other. Tender...
He turned a corner and kept going. Every hall looked the same—white walls, white floors, closed doors with labels on each one that Harry couldn’t bother to read.
A fierce battle raged, which migrated into the Great Hall. Harry followed, finally revealing himself to Voldemort, and watching as Voldemort’s
So, rather bewilderedly, Harry sank back down into the chair, and he did—he told her. He explained Vector’s paranoia, and his unwillingness to go along with all of it. How it’d so quickly gone off the rails—and he hadn’t expected to Malfoy to react like that.
Hermione laughed—breathy and surprised and pleased. “Well. I’m glad.” She leant over and laid a hand on Harry’s arm. “I hope you have a wonderful time.”
Well, he wanted to taste Harry too. So Draco mirrored the movement, gripping by the base and letting out a tentative lick to the very tip. It was a little bitter, but, he liked it. Harry let out a little squeak.
Harry tilted his head, leaning it against Malfoy’s, and kept watching. Rose and the Doctor had travelled five billion year into the future.
Harry felt a rush of … pride? ‘That’s really quite brave of you, Malfoy ... are you sure you shouldn’t be in Gryffindor?’ he teased.
Those hateful words, the words about Ron and Hermione. Lupin, Neville, Hagrid. All the people Harry loves. Harry almost felt … sorry for Draco Malfoy. Holding that much hate inside of him. It had to have been miserable.
Draco grabbed Harry’s head, burying his fingers in those curls, and kissed Harry deep—with tongue. Sloppy, messy, perfect.
Astoria shook her head. A wrinkle appeared between her eyebrows, like she was thinking through what to say. “I grew up similar to you, as you know. I know what Pureblood families are like—the pressure, the supposed necessity to have a heterosexual marriage. The stifling, suffocating pressure to produce an heir. It’s all so …" She licked her lips, and turned to look at him. “So archaic. They made you feel like you had to hide that part of yourself, didn’t they? They made you feel like that part of you was wrong. But Draco ... it
Harry made a choking sound; it might've almost been a laugh. He looked at Draco, wide-eyed. And Draco imagined Harry hated him to see him like this.
Draco paused with his finger over his shirt button. He stepped closer to his bedroom doorway, and found Harry there, leaning against the frame and very-slightly smiling.
Harry dropped Draco’s hand, and turned over to face him, they were just inches away. God, Draco was pretty. Harry’s glasses pressed into his temple funny though, so he took them off, folding them up into his hand.
Malfoy tugged on Harry’s clothes, and once they were both dressed, he took Harry by the hand and led him down hallways, as Harry tried very hard not to worry—not to
He nodded, turned, and walked right out of the hospital wing. His heart was still pounding as he threw the Invisibility cloak back on, and set off towards Gryffindor Tower.
Draco shrugged, and had a look around the room. It seemed dimmed, perhaps due to the grey skies and rain beating down against the window. There weren’t many people around... Just Pansy and Blaise sitting quietly at a table—Blaise caught his eye and winked. Finnegan and Thomas were at another table, hand-in-hand, and lost in their own world. And there were a handful of Muggles around. He even spotted the elderly couple he’d briefly chatted with on the first morning of their trip. The husband was sipping at his tea, while his wife looked to be prattling on about something.
He led Draco in through the crowd, pushing past blokes grinding up on one another, blokes snogging, and Draco might've spotted a hand down the back of someone's trousers.
Also, I don’t intend for any of this to be “Ginny bashing” - I just think that when you’re stuck in an unhappy relationship where needs aren’t being met, that unhappiness can come out in bitter ways
There was that familiar feeling of being sucked through a small tube, and then Harry found himself in a simple room with brown curtained windows on one end, and a white double bed in the center. There was a desk, with a laptop on it, and an assortment of papers, just like Draco’s desk at the hospital. In the corner was a small television, and a dresser.
Draco brought his mouth back, and ran his soft closed lips up the length of the cleft, breathing lightly against the skin there.
Harry clenched his jaw, fixed his eyes on the white-tiled wall in front of him, and scrubbed harder.
Harry got through it, though. He survived the journey without further incident. Eventually the making out had settled down, and they’d all wondered aloud about what an Eighth Year would be like. It felt almost normal, to talk about teachers and coursework, and listen to Hermione babble on about potential lesson-plans while the rest of them only half-listened and exchanged exasperated but fond smiles.
It was the morning of the funeral. The four houses were marched in columns down to the grounds. His mentor—his friend—was dead. Just thinking anything about Dumbledore made tears well up in his eyes.
Draco had listened to all this, with head bowed. With hands clenched so tightly that his knuckles were white.
“Wow,” Draco said out loud. His thoughts flitted to Potter for a moment. Potter had been that ‘one man’. Something twisted in his chest, an ache.
He paced in his end of the waiting room, barely registering anything going on in the centre of the room.
'Covering the dough for a bit.' Harry set the dough on a baking tray and dampened the tea towel before laying it overtop.
1. General warnings for swearing, drinking, sensuality, nudity, talk of sex/cocks, some light stalking (but Harry stalked Draco all through sixth year, so I guess they're even?), mentions of infidelity/gaslighting/possessiveness
‘You didn’t want to see me kiss Terry Boot?’ Draco echoed back. It was impossible to get a read on his tone—on whatever Draco was feeling.
Draco unwrapped it carefully, as if he planned to re-use the paper later. Once he got the gift out, he blinked down at it—evidently perplexed.
Their eyes met. There were so many memories there—memories they didn’t need to mention. ‘Do you want a different one?’ Draco asked.
Draco admired the thing, a bit awed by it. Had his mother sent it? The Malfoy wealth was largely gone, or frozen, since the war. So, he doubted it was her, but who else would even think of treating them with something like this? It certainly was nice looking … and suited the space.
Draco turned back, in time to see Potter’s jaw clench, and in time to see those sharp green eyes flash to his. Draco averted his gaze quickly, and spun back around to face the front desk. His heart had begun to pound.
“Saw what?” Draco asked, wondering why he was even bothering—because anything they talked about was sure to be nonsensical. She should probably get some water and go to bed.
An “adult bedtime story”? Harry had a feeling he knew the answer to his question. Inexplicitly, he already felt the rush of desire. Of blood pumping. Just thinking about Draco … in his bed—over in Hufflepuff with yellow curtains drawn—possibly already hard and needing something to wank to so he could fall sleep.
Draco took a step closer towards Harry. He was very much in Harry's personal space—close enough to feel the heat off him, to hear the soft puffs of his breath.
Harry smiled. How could he properly describe Draco Malfoy? ‘You’re so smart, and witty, and nice to talk to …’ He thought of the day before, thought of their easy conversation, thought of Draco comforting him as he cried, thought of him holding his hand. ‘And so
Molly smiled warmly, and patted his cheek. Then, she turned to Malfoy. “Hello Draco, dear.” And then, defying expectation, she pulled Malfoy into her arms.
Potter stared at their joined hands as he said, ‘I’m not looking to be in a new relationship right now.’
Full of gratefulness and warmth, he started to fall asleep to the steady sound of Draco’s voice. His eyes closed and the world melted away—all but Draco’s voice, speaking of stars and myths.
Their eyes met in the mirror—he had ice-blue eyes. Cold. He even did the slicked-back hair that Draco had done in his Hogwarts days, only with shaved sides. This man was a villain, Draco decided. And he knew villains.
to fuck it up. And I’m sorry I’ve been such an arsehole to you tonight. I’m … Merlin … I don’t even know.”
Draco's fingers were slow—and thorough. And it gave Harry goosebumps up the back of his arms. No one had ever done this for him, it was like he was being cared for …
‘Yeah, mate, what’s been going on? I remembered you had that nightmare last night, then you weren’t in your bed in the morning,’ Ron said, scratching a spot on his temple. ‘We thought you might’ve gone down for breakfast early … but it was like you’d disappeared.’
The treat crunched in the animal’s mouth, and it swallowed. Then, with a single hoot of thanks, the bird spread its wings and pushed off—flapping out the window, ruffling a few loose papers on Harry’s desk in the process.
He wanted to privately indulge his own fantasy. That was all. Potter need never know. Salazar—had Potter already received all of his earlier poems?
'You think it'd be good here?' Draco said wryly, shooting Harry his own lifted brow. There were sporting posters on the wall above Harry's head.
Harry stood with his back to Draco—Draco's own white t-shirt, wrinkled and hanging off his shoulders. Black joggers that were a bit short on him, showing off some anklebone and bare feet. He turned slowly, wiping at his left eye underneath his glasses as he did so. A sleepy smile grew on his mouth. 'Thought you might like some tea.'
“I wish you didn’t have them,” Harry said, swiping his thumb over a healthy patch of skin. “But they don’t make you untouchable.”
rather amusing to think of Harry's childhood as dull, but he didn’t let that show on his face. 'He was decent enough with his studies, but, er, rather impertinent with authority figures sometimes.' That earned a snort from Harry, and a laugh from Dave. 'As I said, he was quite focussed on, ah,
Draco didn’t normally like to talk about his work with people he knew at Hogwarts. He was doing what he considered the bare minimum of the right thing—after a childhood of doing everything very wrong. But, generally, it still didn’t feel like enough, and he was sure any Hogwarts students would think so, too.
He woke up with his face against Malfoy’s shoulder, his glasses pushed up on his forehead, and his arms loosely wrapped around Malfoy’s right arm. The film was playing the end credits.
Harry exhaled. This was not what he’d ever expect … Malfoy was not this upfront with him, not in person, not about the war. And he looked impossibly exposed sitting across from him. So, Harry thought about it before responding, seriously thought about it. Malfoy went back to fiddling nervously with a chip and avoiding Harry’s eye.
Harry laid out all their purchases into organised sections and began searching for a cutting board, which, Draco evidently didn’t have.
'Yeah, no problem,' Draco said, blinking at him. 'Evan.' The name felt a bit weird to say out loud, but he'd have to get used to it—and soon.
‘Yeah,’ Harry said. He should go. This was weird. He’s going to go. As an afterthought, he said, ‘Yeah. But, will it scar?’
He pulled on his glasses from the nightstand, and grabbed the spare blanket he keeps on the chair, wrapping it around his waist. Then Harry rushed over to his sitting room, half expecting Ginny to be standing there. Instead, Ginny’s firey head was in the hearth. A Floo-call. Of course. He hurried over, and knelt down in front of it.
“Ah, right there is probably fine,” Draco said, gesturing towards the strip of blank white wall behind the kitchen table.
Potter looked at him then, with something complicated written on his face. Like he was uncomfortable, perhaps. “I don’t think you’re a disaster.”
they decided to meet up, and become actual friends in person … And who knows … they already get along really well, and since they both like blokes …
Draco's slick penis breached past that sensitive ring of nerve endings, and Harry sat down slowly, grunting a bit as Draco slowly filled him up.
Harry held his arms tighter to his chest. ‘Tell me,’ he said quietly. Whatever it was, Draco obviously wanted to talk about it. And they’d deal with it. Harry would deal with it. He seriously doubted Draco had anything truly horrible to reveal about himself. Harry knew Draco, knew all the bad things he’d done, or, he was pretty sure he did.
Harry just looked at Draco in disbelief for a moment, shaking his head. Then he took one more sweeping look around the kitchen before announcing, ‘I’m going to my house.’
Harry cast a glance at Malfoy, who wouldn’t meet his eyes. Instead, he moved to sit in the empty waiting area.
He sat them down at a table on the edge of the terrace; it had a great view overlooking the square below. They sat. He handed them their menus.
Draco blinked rapidly. So that part had been true, then. He stared unseeing into the crackling flames. “I don’t hate you.” It was an admission, that’s for sure. Almost as bad as saying ‘
‘“Someone”?’ She raised an eyebrow and leaned back in her seat; her expression rather grim. ‘I take it this person wishes to remain anonymous?’
While talk of Quidditch died down naturally, and their stomachs were full of good food, Madam Rosmerta brought them fresh drinks. Hot tea for Malfoy, a butterbeer for Harry.
They all eyed him with smiles, some flirtier than others. He smiled back tentatively. Bit weird, but … but not wholly unwelcome. Was nice to have company—made him feel a bit more at ease with this ridiculous scenario he’d wilfully gotten himself into.
yes, in fact. It got his heart rate going at just the thought of it. They hadn't talked seriously about sex yet, and whether it was time to take their relationship to that level—if they wanted to or not.
Ginny let out a burst of laughter, then covered her mouth. ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry. That’s just bizarre. So bizarre. And yet,
Sodding owls. Why couldn’t the wizarding world adopt Muggle means of communication? Owls made everything need to be so urgent. One had to stop everything they were doing to open a window (regardless of weather), give an owl a treat, sometimes write a reply immediately …
Harry sucked his thumb into his mouth. Draco gasped. Because... because Harry was sucking on it like it were a cock. And staring back at him, as if daring him. Merlin...
Just to be safe, Harry took out his wand from his blazer pocket and performed diagnostic spells on the package. It contained a stasis spell and a standard protection spell—something to keep whatever was inside from become broken, presumably. Nothing dark or dangerous as far as he could tell. So, he untied the string and removed the wrapping. It was just a plain, brown, cardboard box inside, with no markings. He wedged a thumb under the flap and opened it.
Malfoy groaned, cracking open one eyelid to glare at Harry. ‘Lie down. Tell me about it when I wake up. You bastard.’
'Ah …' Admittedly, it could be fun to get out and dance again, like he had in Ibiza with those French girls. 'Yeah, all right. If you're certain the others wouldn't mind.'
“No!” Harry rushed to say. Jesus, he just asked about a walk. “Hang on, are we—? Er … you haven’t exactly told me ‘yes’, yet. But I just thought we could, like, talk ...”
Draco’s body was quivering, shaking like a leaf. It was getting wet in Harry’s hair, he realised: Draco was still crying.
‘Hey! I’m nearly 18,’ Harry sputtered defensively. ‘I just didn’t see it. Draco must’ve caught a glimpse that wasn’t visible from my angle. It was luck ... probably.’
Harry smiled, and took Draco’s hand as they set off—walking through the dungeon corridors before making the climb up all those sets of stairs. It was a path he'd taken many times... to a place that held terrible, shameful memories. But, maybe, he could make one good one there.
Draco fumbled around with the torch, trying to get it to work, while Potter was no help whatsoever. Eventually he figured out that the button was meant to be shifted, rather than pushed down, and he blasted himself with light straight in the eyes.
Draco shrugged. 'Circuses can be …' He sighed. 'Oh who am I kidding. No, it is not my choice of entertainment. Pansy, on the other hand, was on a real Muggle-discovery kick. A
Draco bit back a groan, and dipped down to fully cover himself up to his neck in cool water. 'Can't be too cheerful if I'm single, can it?'
Draco hummed his agreement. He certainly wasn't in the mood for anymore drinking anytime soon, and dancing seemed like far too much work. 'Want to order room service, buy snacks at the vending machine, and watch a film or something?'
Harry placed Rose’s drawing down and snatched up the hateful letter instead, bringing it over to where Ron was working his kitchen magic. He held it up so that Ron could get the gist of it. “He’s getting all this mail. I think, like, every day. Some of them have dangerous curses in them. I wondered if … if the Aurors could do anything about it?”
Potter snapped his head back to look at Draco again, searchingly. His drunk, concerned face was... fucking adorable. “I did—”
Harry let go of Draco’s hand, instead throwing his arm around Draco’s shoulder. The bench was in sight.
This felt like an important moment to Harry. He could tell Malfoy to keep it, to live with the proof of what he had been, and what he had done, right there on his skin. Never able to forget, and, perhaps never able to forgive himself.
Malfoy laughed under his breath. “Yes.” And then draped himself over half Harry’s body, nuzzling his face into Harry’s neck, breathing in. “Do you want me to go back to my quarters?”
But Malfoy didn’t want to stay soft and slow for long—he licked at Harry’s bottom lip, and then crushed their mouths together—making funny frantic sounds that weren’t quite moans but
They certainly had all come a long way, compared to last year. Compared to how this year had started, even. Harry wondered if his journal-mate was there, as he sipped his Firewhisky, and looked out over the rim of the cup. He eyed the Seventh Year Slytherins in particular. He didn’t know any of them really, didn’t know most of their names. His journal-mate could easily be any one of them.
Once out the bathroom, Draco burst out laughing. He swiped a hand over his face and veered towards the bar to grab another cocktail. Well that'd been something. What an absolute lunatic.
Harry nodded, not taking his eyes off the dark-green image forming. ‘Were you jealous I could talk to snakes?’
Draco schooled his breathing, squeezing his eyes tight. No, he was not going to think. He was just going to read, he told himself.
He watched as Potter and Weasley reached the front of the line, and spoke to the Muggle girl there. When she handed over the keys, Draco saw them look down at them, puzzled, then at each other. They said something to the girl. She looked mildly uncomfortable.
The class separated into small groups, huddling around various Portkeys that Flitwick produced from a cloth bag. This time Pansy, Harry, and Draco shared one—a toy horse with pink plastic hair.
“Whatever.” Pansy’s sigh echoed through the empty dorm. “You won’t be able to avoid all human interaction on the Muggle Studies outing.”
He took a long drag of beer, and watched her chat with Morgana. She hadn't said a word to Harry since they sat down. He glanced over at Frederick, noting how he watched Morgana with unveiled longing.
Malfoy’s postured stiffened as Harry sat down beside him. Harry peered at him out of the corner of his eye. Malfoy was gripping his fork quite tightly.
But as Harry looked around the room more closely, it was startling to see how many empty spaces there were on the benches. Did the spaces belong to people who had died? Or simply people who had decided to drop out?
‘Uh—’ Harry looked around the room—a stuffed bookshelf, a frayed rug, the crackling fire in the hearth—stalling for time. This certainly didn’t seem the best opportunity to talk about their relationship. Not after her brother had just died … ‘Um—’
“Why did you ask me on a date?” Malfoy demanded, looking quite angry. He seemed to take up the whole room.
Malfoy pulled away, his expression sobered. He stared up into Harry’s eyes, like he was trying to read something there. ‘I have to ask … was this just because of convenience? Because I’m your neighbour and we’re lonely and bored or whatever?’ He blinked rapidly. ‘It’s okay if it that’s the case. I just … wanted to ask.’
Malfoy tossed him a look. ‘I’m quite alright at the moment, thank you.’ He picked up an empty bottle of wine and studied the label. ‘You’re welcome to do whatever you like, of course. Watch your Doctor or whatever.’
—as his penis mostly disappeared from view inside Draco's hot mouth. And when Draco lifted up, it shone wet with Draco's saliva.
Considering Voldemort had cheated death before, it didn’t seem that improbable a fear. But Harry had been there, Harry
He spun to face her. “Ah! You’re awake! That was tricky business, wasn’t it? Well I watched after your quest for you, but I’m afraid your object fell out of Miss Hermione Granger’s satchel. I tried to tell her—but just then Peeves started wreaking havoc on the suits of armour.” The ghost made
He could see that he wasn't going to get through to her. So he surveyed the room, eyed a lone table stacked with brochures that needed to be packed away. Shaking his head, he walked towards them.
“It’s perfect, Hermione. And he has those silver eyes, and those long pianist fingers,” Harry said miserably.
Harry broke away, and swiped at his wet cheeks. 'One last one for you, there. But … Draco, I feel like you went above and beyond. And what I got you was—'
Harry sucked in a breath. He’d admitted a lot, there. But, so had Draco before that. He managed a smile back. ‘I liked what you sent, you know? Mail from you was the most interesting part of my year.’
‘I’m having trouble believing you truly want this,’ Draco murmured, raking his eyes over Harry’s face. ‘Just … just because you’re … you.’
When Ron left for the loo, Harry scribbled a memo, and sent it out to Hermione’s desk at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
