Draco surprised even himself with his next words. “We could go to a Muggle place.” Harry jerked his head up to stare in surprise, and Draco, never one to back down from a Potter Stare, met his eyes almost defiantly. Harry grinned and pried himself off the bed to go talk to the concierge.
Harry stepped forward, holding out his hand while mentally scrambling for something pleasant (but not horribly revealing) to say. “Malfoy. You’re looking well.”
But Harry was being gentle, and kind. “Hey, it’s ok. It’ll be ok, Draco, just breathe. C’mon, nice deep breaths.” He put a hand on Draco’s back and turned him up the beach. “Tell you what, we’ll go sit and regroup, ok?” The two of them took the handful of steps to the treeline, and found something vaguely like a coconut palm, whose base split into two trunks. They sat, leaning against the trunks, with their hips and thighs close enough to share warmth.
She winced a bit, looking apologetic. “Well, apparently there was someone else who needed the goodwill tour more...” He started to ask a few questions, but a posh drawl from behind him, one he knew all too well, answered them all.
They carried the conversation out into the cool night, meandering along still-bustling thoroughfares and quiet little side streets, enjoying each other’s company far more than either would have predicted a week ago. There was a lull in their debate, wherein they even smiled at each other, just a little, and then Harry heard it. Flutes, and drums, or maybe tambourines, in a cheerful, lilting melody that ignited his curiosity and drew him in. Without thinking, he turned down the next tiny lane, following the tune.
Harry slipped one more pair of woolly socks into his suitcase-
they insist I need their best Auror-” the sneer emerged for just a moment “-as a bodyguard, and it turns out he’s essentially a glorified babysitter. Come on then, let’s get this over with.” He rolled his eyes as he turned toward the Floos.
Harry gasped, and his voice was soft, reverent. “We’re not in Cardiff anymore, Toto...”
“Oh.” Draco hadn’t expected Harry to cave so easily, had been gearing up for a great row, and now he wasn’t quite sure what to do with himself. He let his head drop back against the tree trunk and stared up at the remarkable starscape. “They might not find us, you know. We might be unfindable. Still, if I have to potentially starve to death millions of miles from home, the view is certainly worth it.” He flicked a look over at Harry. “And the company’s not bad, either.”

if he did. He paid enough attention to their hosts to make the right noises of approval during the tour and the meal that followed, but most of his energy was spend attempting to wrestle this ridiculous infatuation into submission.
- and headed downstairs to the Floo point in the living room. Along the way, he stopped off in the front hall to grab his leather jacket and slip his shrunken suitcase into it. Kreacher was waiting (lurking) near the fireplace, and Harry nodded to him. “Alright, I don’t expect to be gone more than two weeks, and I know you can look after the place just fine that long. If anyone’s looking for me, you can send them on to the Ministry, they’ll know how to get hold of me.” He slung the jacket around his shoulders and activated the Floo. “Well, enjoy your holiday. Feel free to take a half-day and, I dunno, visit family, or go fishing, or whatever it is that you’re interested in.” Before he could ponder the cranky old elf’s leisure activities, he stepped through to the Ministry atrium, where his eyes alighted on a familiar figure. “Hermione!”

The second stop, Langley Wood, included a magi-natural preserve, with all sorts of interesting rare creatures, but Draco was increasingly distracted by Potter’s neatly kept facial hair. He was finding it harder and harder to resist running his fingers through the short, dark strands, and he certainly couldn’t keep himself from wondering what it would feel like, whether it was coarse or soft, what sorts of sounds Potter might make
, of all people!
!” He refused to give in to the rising panic. “
Harry huffed a laugh at him. “No, it’s from- You know what, we can talk about that when we get back to London. Right now, we should probably get back to- Oh.” He had turned toward the gate they had come through, only to find no gate there. The beach stretched on just as far in that direction, just as unbroken by built structures as the direction they’d seen first. Instinctively, Harry whipped out his wand and cast at the spot where the gate should be. “
Harry had meant the question to be genuine (nowadays he hated the thought of Draco being afraid of anything), but Draco took it as more of a challenge. “If you’re not afraid, neither am I. Come on, then, you Gryffindor, keep up.” He strode boldly up to the gate and slipped through without letting himself think in the slightest about what he was doing.
“Potter.” Harry turned around to see Draco staring at the floor. He looked up to meet Harry’s eyes. “Thank you.” Harry smiled lightly.
You helped me when no one else gave a damn, so I’m returning the favor. Thank you.
“You don’t have to be certain of what you want in order to finish your studies.” She replied calmly, almost motherly. “Take the year to finish your education and think about what you want. The time to decide can come later and there are many withes and wizards who change their path later in life if you should want to.”
“Impressive.” Draco said simply, looking quite surprised. Harry didn’t know what to say next and ended up just awkwardly standing in front of Malfoy. He seemed to be waiting for something, but when nothing happened he huffed.
“That’s nice of him.” Was all Ron had to say before returning to his breakfast. Harry had really been expecting a more intense reaction. When he only continued to stare at his best friend in disbelief Ron added, “You should probably open it. Be kind of rude not to.”
“You can do it.” Hermione encouraged. Harry slouched his shoulders defeatedly and, tossing one last betrayed look at his friends, left the common room. Hopefully Draco wouldn’t be in the room anymore by the time Harry got there.
“Good.”
Draco’s mumbled question made Harry chuckle. The only reason Draco was talking like that was because he was running a high fever.
In the space of several seconds, he’d somehow managed to replace the derision in his voice with slight boredom. It wasn’t the kind of bored drawl that expressed annoyance, but the sort of lack of enthusiasm that was, strangely enough, more endearing than irksome.
“No, wait, don’t tell me. I know it. We were daydreaming about your knight in shining armour, Harry Potter.”
“Yes, Sir.”
Charlie leant back in his chair.
He slowly moved his hands and placed them behind his back.
“I concur.”
Draco chuckled and preparing his own tea, he added some sugar and poured a bit of freshly-squeezed lemon juice into it, then briefly dithered over which biscuit to try. After several seconds of indecisiveness, he chose the bourbon, and taking a bite, he made a point of savouring the chocolate buttercream filling between the two thin rectangular slices of dark chocolate-flavoured biscuit.
“I am―”
His eyes twinkled with mischief.
She put her pen down and smiled at him.
Harry fondled Draco’s balls, teasing them until he felt them tighten. It was only then that he briefly stopped kissing Draco. He practically ripped Draco’s briefs off his hips and flung them onto the floor. With Draco now completely naked, Harry had unrestricted access to every single inch of his body, and he made thorough use of that. He caressed, teased, squeezed, rubbed, kissed, licked, and sucked, steadily turning Draco into a complete wreck. Draco moaned and begged, writhed atop the piano, and urged him to get a move on but Harry ignored him completely.
Caleb snorted.
“Say what?” he asked.
Draco was sitting in his favourite tattered armchair by the window. He had his nose buried in a thick case file, and slowing down, Harry stopped beside the empty armchair across from Draco. On the small table in front of Draco stood an empty cup of coffee, a half-finished glass of lemon-flavoured water and a plate with one half of a chocolate croissant.
“Oh, Harry you look lovely.” Hermione told him and Harry flushed at the praise. He’d never felt like he was very good looking, but the clothes had given him some confidence in his appearance. Ron slung his arm around Harry’s shoulders.
"What does that mean?"
“That’s just for helping him out with something.” Ron looked disbelieving.
Harry spotted the Slytherins who had attacked Malfoy sitting in the corner and noticed one of them was holding a camera. Likely ready to catch Malfoy running back in without clothes. Harry kept his face blank despite his boiling rage. There was no need to make a scene right now.
“Come here.” She said and led them to a couch with Harry in the middle. “We’ve noticed that you two have been paying a lot of attention to each other.” Harry was incredulous.
“Look, I wasn’t sure how well an ex-death eater would be received, and I felt it was best to just remove myself from the situation. I would have only put people on edge.” Draco’s voice had changed. He sounded sincere and he wasn’t being snarky. He looked mildly uncomfortable, but there was a modicum of pleading in his voice asking Harry to understand.
“No. I just care about you.”
“Well. Uh. Hermione and I were wondering. Are you two, um, together now?”
“Er, what about us?” Harry asked.
A few other times when he checked it he found Malfoy in the library and it was pure coincidence that Harry decided he could use a bit of study time too.
Harry turned around and had to bite back a laugh as he found Malfoy holding up the pants around his waist looking triple his size. The shirt was so baggy it made him look even skinnier than normal. It was comical seeing the prim and proper Draco Malfoy wearing his over sized hand me downs. Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the clothes. He saw Malfoy tense but continued anyway.
Narcissa merely smiled at him.
“Will you be returning to Hogwarts this fall to complete your studies?” Narcissa asked. Harry felt himself frown. That really was the million galleon question. He wasn’t sure of what he wanted right now. After the war he was so tired of fighting he wasn’t sure he could follow the auror path he had originally set out for. He still wanted to help with the efforts to get the wizarding world back to normal and he wanted to help eliminate the discrimination against muggleborns and werewolves, but he wasn’t sure he could handle the stress of getting wrapped up with more dark wizards.
The missive was rather short. It only read;
Okay, maybe every night, but he had promised to keep an eye on things. Most of the time he found Malfoy in the Slytherin dorms which is where he was tonight.
“Guess you’re not a briefs guy.” He quipped. Harry snatched the underpants from Draco’s hand. His face flushing. ‘This was really all very backwards. Shouldn’t Malfoy be the one blushing? He’s the one naked after all.’ Harry thought irritably.
“I’m just not sure what I want anymore. I thought I had a plan in mind, but after everything that’s happened…” He trailed off not knowing how to explain the conflict in his head.
“You’ll never know unless you do something about it.” Hermione told him. Leave it to her to make sense. Harry sighed.
“No you- ugh. You are not naked.” Malfoy said as if he were speaking to someone very simple.
“You can have it.” Draco told him. Harry smiled and leaned in again laying softer kisses on Draco’s lips. Draco’s hands found their way up Harry’s shirt and when they ran out of air they broke apart, breathing heavily. Harry continued dropping kisses on Draco’s neck and ground his hips against the blonde’s again. The moan Draco let out was better than anything Harry had ever imagined in his late-night fantasies and he desperately wanted more so he did it again. And again. And again. Slowly speeding up until Draco was saying his name like a mantra, begging for more contact.
“You’re welcome.” She called after him fondly.
When they finally had a handle on their breathing Draco pulled Harry’s head off his shoulder and met his eyes. He searched Harry’s face and must have found whatever he was looking for because he pulled him into another soft kiss. When they separated this time Harry pulled Draco into a tight embrace. He used the wall to hold them up and relaxed against the blonde. Draco let out a slow breath and buried his head in Harry’s shoulder.
“We’re not quite sure how his return will be received, but his education must be completed.” Harry frowned at that. He knew things would not be as they were before, but he had hoped that the ones on the light side of the war would be able to see the hypocrisy in harming anyone who had been pardoned.
“Maybe.” Harry admitted with a small voice as his throat closed and wetness gathered at the corners of his eyes. He tried to get control of himself, but Hermione scooted closer and pulled him into a tight hug. Deep down he knew his friends loved him and would accept him for who he was, but that hadn’t stopped the fear of rejection from eating at him. It didn’t undo the years he’d had to endure his relatives snide remarks whenever they saw the ‘unnatural’ couples on the street. On his other side Ron wrapped his arms around the both of them and held them. Harry was trying to calm down, he really was, but his shoulders started shaking and his breath came shorter without his permission. His friends held him until he stopped shaking. One’s of Ron’s hands was rubbing his arm and Hermione’s made small circles on his back. It grounded him and settled his nerves. His breathing slowly returned to normal and even then, they held him for just a bit longer.
“No. Just- Why don’t you- er come to the 8th year dorms and you can borrow a set of clothes to get back to your dorm. That way if they’re waiting you’re not dueling them in the buff.” Harry had absolutely no idea why he offered. He really needed to learn to think about what he said before he said it.
“Hermione, I actually have something I need to do. Any chance you have something I can put food in for later?” She thought for a moment before pulling out her wand and pointing it at a napkin. It transfigured into a takeout container. “Brilliant I’ll have to learn that one.” Harry said as he piled food into it. “Thanks Hermione.” He added as he set off.
“Either way we’ll manage. I don’t plan to get into any fights this year.” Harry took a bite of chicken before he realized there was something he needed to take care of.
“I’m sorry about-”
“Mr. Potter, to what do I owe the pleasure?” McGonagall asked.
“Now that’s over with.” Ron said looking a little relieved when he let go. “Hermione and I are doing homework in the common room, you’re both free to join if you want.” Harry was shocked and grateful for Ron’s seeming acceptance of the situation. It appeared the redhead was maturing after all. Ron started to leave the room and spotted the takeout box of food on Draco’s trunk. He turned to Harry and rose his eyebrows, giving him a knowing look before leaving the room. Harry felt his face heat but couldn’t quite figure out why. He would have to talk to Ron later. Just to clear up… whatever that was.
Later that week as Harry was putting away his books from class and getting ready to meet Ron and Hermione for dinner his hand brushed the map in his trunk. He hesitated before deciding to give the map a once over. Malfoy had been showing up at the great hall less and less and it bothered Harry a bit. He wanted to say it was because the git thought he was too good to have meals with everyone else, but he knew that likely wasn’t the case. Locating the familiar dot on the parchment Harry was thrown to find Malfoy was alone in a classroom on the 3rd floor. That was a bit out of the ordinary. Harry frowned and thought about it for a moment. He supposed he could just walk by on his way to the great hall. Just to check on things and make sure nothing odd was going on. It would be fine. He wasn’t obsessing. He decided to stuff his invisibility cloak into his bag and take it with him. If Malfoy was going to try to avoid him then he just wouldn’t let Malfoy see him.
Narcissa smiled and it made her face look a bit kinder.
“I’m going to get more clothes, obviously.” Draco snarked, but the bite wasn’t really there.
“Well just in case then.” Harry replied. Draco squinted at Harry.
“I use this room to study. No one bothers me in here.” Draco explained gesturing to his backpack that had fallen near the door. Harry frowned and pulled him close.
“Er right.” Harry replied as he turned around to face the back of the room. He heard rustling for a minute and then another frustrated huff.
“Well what else do you expect me to do? Spend the rest of my life under your cloak?” Draco said waspishly.
“Um.” Draco said. He looked like he was ready to run, but Harry’s hands were still on his hips. Gathering the last scraps of his Gryffindor courage Harry tightened his hands on Draco’s hips. His eyes snapped back to Harry’s and there was confusion on his face mingled with the slightest bit of hope.
“I suppose I’ll take care of it then.” He answered. Harry did not like that idea.
"Yeah. We're adults now. We can move on. Maybe we'll even get along." The last part of his sentence sounded a little more like a question and it looked like the words took a lot of effort, but Hermione gave Ron an approving nod and he turned his attention back to dinner.
“Let’s go then.” He said. Draco looked confused.
Harry reached the dorms and thought about how all of the 8th year boys shared the dorm, except one. Draco Malfoy had spoken to McGonagall after the welcoming feast and had apparently asked to stay in the Slytherin dorms. Harry wasn’t sure what was said, but McGonagall had agreed and made the arrangements for him to stay with the other Slytherins. He had hoped they would have been able to put the old rivalry behind them after everything that happened in the war, but was decidedly disappointed when he realized Malfoy was steadfastly ignoring him at every turn. Harry tried not to let it bother him, but it was no use. Every time he saw Malfoy he expected a snarky remark or some form of recognition at least, a sneer even, but he only received stony silence. It was odd to think about, but one of the only reasons he even returned to Hogwarts was because of Malfoy himself.
“Thank you.” Harry said, feeling a little less pressured. “I think that wouldn’t be a bad idea.”
“Really?” he couldn’t help but ask. She nodded with a slight frown.
"Just something Hermione and I were talking about. Forget about it for now. Just- if there's ever anything you need to talk about you can tell me. You're my best mate and any uh, choices you make are fine with me."
He immediately went up to the dorms and smiled as he picked up the clothes. He would still need to get some others, but this was a big start. For some reason the clothes made him feel new. Like he was a step closer to separating himself from his old life. Further from his miserable childhood, further from the war. He quickly changed into a set of new clothes. He pulled on a pair of dark jeans and tried to decide between the two sweaters. The color choices made him grin. One was green and the other was red. In the end he pulled on the green one and decided he would wear the red one tomorrow. He never really planned what he was going to wear ahead of time and the thought only had him smiling wider. He looked at his old clothes in his trunk and decided to sort through them. He pulled out all of his clothes, though there weren’t very many, and put aside anything with too many holes or stains. By the end of it aside from his school clothes he had two shirts, the jumpers Molly made him, and one pair of jeans. He tossed the rest in the bin for the house elves to dispose of and packed away his new clothes. He would have to thank Draco, if he could ever track him down that is. When Harry returned to the common room Ron and Hermione seemed to be waiting for him.
“I- please, Harry I want to touch you.” Harry slowed his hips with a lot of effort and brought his hands to Draco’s zipper. He was shocked with himself for taking it so far so quickly, but he couldn’t help but feel this was a long time coming. He met Draco’s eyes, silently asking for permission. Draco nodded in answer and Harry wasted no time yanking the zipper open and sliding Draco’s trousers and underwear down to the middle of his thighs. He took hold of Draco’s member and Draco let out a strangled sound. Harry gave a feather light stroke and Draco’s head fell back, thumping against the wall. Harry continued stroking, not moving too fast just teasing for now. Exploring what sounds he could get out of the blonde.
“The gift seems like the perfect excuse to start up a conversation.” Hermione told him.
“The others. I heard them say something about hexing you and I followed them.” Mostly true. Malfoy’s eyes narrowed on him and a frown twisted his face.
“See you later Draco.”
“Yep.” Harry said as he continued walking, leading them down to the Slytherin dorms. Draco hurried to catch up with him.
“I- It would be wrong of them to do anything. He’s been pardoned. If other people can’t see that then I’ll speak with them.” Harry felt he would do that for anyone he saw being mistreated because of which side they were on in the war.
“I respect that you care for your family, and I don’t blame you.” He isn’t sure why, but he adds “There’s a lot I would do to have some people back.” And he feels the truth in his own words. Knows now how far he would go to keep those who he has left safe, wishes he could go back and keep others alive. He feels an itch at the edges of his eyes and a lump in his throat. Harry shifts his gaze to looking intently at his cup of tea and waits for the feeling to pass. Narcissa clears her throat.
Harry lay sprawled on the floor in front of the roaring fire in the common room fireplace. He was trying to relax after a long day of classes and avoiding the hero worship from the younger students. It actually hadn’t been as bad as he thought as most of the other students had been suffering the same war. It was mostly the new first years and a handful of second years who still gawked and tried to dredge up the nerve to thank him. Harry didn’t want their thanks or recognition, he just wanted to be left alone.
It wasn’t an awkward or embarrassed laugh but one that was full of mirth and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
Draco smiled.
“Could you like, perhaps make an exception?”
Harry grinned mischievously and winked at Draco.
A rustle of leaves distracted Harry and ignoring the faint malodour, hanging in the air, he rolled onto his underbelly and twisted his head. The head of a stunning grey she-wolf appeared at the edge of the clearing, curiously poking through the thicket of green bushes, and Harry hummed. He lifted his head off the ground and stood perfectly still, waiting. The majestic she-wolf slowly approached him; her piercing crystal-blue eyes intently fixed on him. Harry didn’t move an inch. He didn’t shift, and he didn’t blink. His kin tilted her head slightly to the side and barked softly, though not to warn Harry or urge him to retreat but merely to greet him, his old and faithful friend.
“I thought so. Now, I’ve something that might help you with your nerves. It’ll make you feel like I’m on stage with you and I think it will help you to stay calm and focus on telling your story. Interested?”
For now, all he wanted to do was to enjoy the idea of thoroughly pranking Harry and teaching him a lesson he wouldn’t forget for quite some time.
Potter merely growled in response, turned his head away and continued to, presumably, stare a hole into the ceiling of their office, not that he was going to be successful in his endeavour. Then again, Draco didn’t feel the need to point that out to Potter. Somehow, he had the feeling it would only unnecessarily infuriate his partner.
“I um, think I’ll join them to get some work done. Did you want to come down too?” Harry asked tentatively.
“And we think Malfoy might at least like you too.” Ron added, bringing them back to the original topic. Harry wanted to believe him, but it felt like too much to hope for after everything that had happened.
The decision was taken from Harry suddenly when the door opened and Draco practically knocked him over. They stumbled into each other and somehow Harry ended up with his hands on Draco’s hips. Draco was speechless and Harry didn’t know what to do. His balance was off and he was certain if he moved they would both topple over. He was staring into icy blue eyes only inches from his own. Their faces were so close. Their bodies were pressed together. Harry watched Draco’s eyes flick down to his lips before meeting his eyes again. Harry’s breath caught, he swore Draco had moved his face a fraction closer. Draco’s eyes widened marginally and a hint of fear appeared on his face. Harry didn’t like that.
Harry walked quickly and planned out how he would broach the topic as he stopped in front of the gargoyle statue. He gave the password and took the revolving staircase to the Headmistresses office.
“I’ll keep an eye on things.” Harry said before he could stop himself. Narcissa looked at him with a touch of fondness. Harry felt his face warm a little.
“Um, I will be returning to my dorm and you will be doing whatever it is saviors of the wizarding world do.” Draco insisted.
“Do you like him?” She asked quietly. Harry frowned and hesitated. He wanted to deny it right away, but there was a part of him that he’d been squashing down for weeks, months. If he thought hard enough he may be able to trace the feeling back by years, but he really wasn’t ready for that level of introspection.
“All of the houses stay in the 8th year dorms.” Harry replied.
“Thank you. It would certainly put me at ease with him returning.” Harry could only nod in response. When it was time for Harry to leave Narcissa walked him to the door and thanked him for stopping by and returning the wand in person. She hesitated a moment and then actually pulled Harry into a light hug. He felt his face heat at the contact. He really wasn’t used to physical affection from anyone he wasn’t close to and even then it was still vaguely uncomfortable unless it was Ron or Hermione. He awkwardly patted her back and then she released him and seemed slightly amused at his discomfort as he walked away.
“Why would you need hand me downs? Surely your relatives were better off. Your father came from a rather well-off pure blood family after all.” Harry shrugged, his smile tight.
“You can call me Harry.” He said instead of the ‘you’re welcome’ he thought he was going to say. Draco looked stunned for half a second before composing himself again.
Harry thought about that. He supposed he could just decide later and it would be better to have the full education that everyone else got. Besides it would also keep him away from the rest of the wizarding world for a bit and maybe he could feel a little normal for a while.
Draco froze. He looked like Harry had just smacked him in the face.
“Some privacy perhaps?” Draco said.
“I assure you I’m perfectly aware-“ Harry started before Draco cut him off.
"Alright mate. It's okay if you were though. I er, support you."
“I think I’ll stay here for now.” Draco said politely sounding stiff. Harry nodded in response and turned to his trunk. He grabbed out his transfiguration book and some parchment and quills. When he looked up he spotted his cloths neatly folded on the end of his bed. His lips twitched into a small smile before a thought struck him. Draco Malfoy had worn his clothes. Without underpants. He felt his face flame and decided he needed to get downstairs as quickly as possible. He turned and hurried to the door. Just as he was about he walk through the doorway Draco called after him.
“I want you.” Harry said firmly. “I don’t care about what anyone else wants.” He could see the happiness spreading on Draco’s face, but uncertainty was trying to push it back off. Harry leaned in and kissed him again trying to make him understand that this was real, they could have what they wanted, rest of the wizarding world be damned. Draco kissed him back desperately. When they pulled back Draco’s face had cleared. He smiled at Harry.
“What makes you think you can just decide that Potter?” He demanded. Harry decided to reason with him before pulling out the big guns.
“Go where?”
"You're still watching him." It wasn't a question and he didn't have to ask who Ron meant by 'him'.
“We’ll go with you.” Hermione said with a smile. Harry shrugged and started walking out of the great hall with them.
“Goodnight Harry.” Hermione replied looking up from where her head was on Ron’s chest to give him a small smile.
“Have at it.” He said and gestured at the trunk so that Draco could pick a set of clothes and they could be through with this very awkward situation. Draco’s head popped out from the cloak rather comically. His hair stood up in one place from being rumpled by the fabric. Harry had noticed that he wasn’t gelling his hair back anymore and it looked rather nice. Harry was thrown from his musings when Draco picked up a pair of boxers and held them up.
“Alright mate” Ron acknowledged, his arms giving Hermione a squeeze.
“That’s not why we did this is it?” Draco asked mildly. Harry snorted.
Once again Harry could only feel confusion with his friends reaction, but he was also a bit too curious about the parcel to question him right now. He turned his attention back to the square package in front of him and pulled off the paper to reveal a box. When he lifted the lid his eyes widened and for some reason it made his gut clench and his throat constrict. Inside the plainly wrapped box Harry discovered two very soft sweaters, three dress shirts, two pairs of dress pants, and, surprisingly, two pairs of muggle jeans. All of the clothing was clearly high quality and aside from the sweaters Molly Weasley made him it was the first set of clothes that belonged only to him.
“Lead the way.” Draco said sounding unenthusiastic. Harry walked them back up to the 8th year dorms and said the password to let them through the portrait hole. Luckily nearly everyone was eating dinner at the moment so the common room was empty and Harry quickly led Draco across the room to the door that led to the boys dormitories. Harry was pretty sure Draco had been following him because he heard a second pair of steps the whole way, but they had been faint because Draco didn’t even have shoes on and now they were practically nonexistent. It was rather awkward that neither one had spoken the whole way up and Harry jumped when Draco finally spoke.
“The one that vanishes all the persons clothes.” He answered with a sharp smile. The other two looked surprised at first, but then they both grinned and started after Malfoy.
“I think I’ll start with getting him to actually talk to me first.” He said sullenly.
“I wonder why he didn’t just start off in the 8th year dorms.”
“Can we hurry this along please?” Harry grumbled. Draco snorted and dove back into the trunk.
“You’re not.” Draco said plainly.
“I wonder what’s changed.” She added. Harry shrugged trying to come off as unconcerned.
“Let me show you how it’s done.” The girl said once they were a few feet from Malfoy’s back. Harry pulled his wand to stop her, but the words were already leaving her lips, the spell already hurtling towards an unsuspecting Malfoy. Without really thinking Harry ran the few extra feet to reach him. He was racing the spell, but the spell was a step faster. Harry stepped in front of him just as the spell hit the unsuspecting wizard. Harry threw his cloak open and engulfed Malfoy in it. There were noises of confusion behind him, the sound of a wand clattering to the ground, and an indignant squawk from Malfoy. Harry threw his arm out from under the cloak and shot multiple curses in quick succession at the three students without really thinking about it. Within seconds large boils and blisters started appearing on the three 6th years faces and they shrieked with indignation before taking off in the opposite direction. Harry relaxed slightly as they left before he heard an indignant huff behind him. He turned around without really thinking and immediately his face caught fire as he was confronted with a very naked Draco Malfoy.
“No.” Harry decided. “We’re both going back to the Slytherin dorms so you’ll have some backup in case they decide to try to jump you again.” Harry shot back, still walking and leading them both out of the 8th year dorm. Draco spluttered indignantly behind him. Harry had a hard time not laughing.
Harry flicked a look and half a smile back at him. “Surprisingly good company, really.” He shifted, and at first Draco thought he was just uncomfortable, until Harry was properly facing him, leaning in, breath warm on Draco’s cheek. “And, you know, I have an idea or two of how we can pass the time until the rescue party gets here.” They both turned, just enough that their lips met, and the sparks that had been growing between them the past few days (years, really, but who’s counting?) burst into a bonfire, and they were lost to anything except the kissing. Time even became a hazy concept, the kisses slowing as exhaustion overtook them, until they fell into sleep still tangled together.
the Ministry official I’m going to be guarding for the next fortnight?”
Draco chuckled. “I’d lodge a complaint, but I doubt Oberon would hear me out.” He smiled shyly and laced his fingers with Harry’s. “Besides, I’m rather happy with the results.” They grinned giddily at each other for a long moment, then Draco laughed aloud. “And think of the story we’ll have to share with Granger!”
“Harry!” She smiled and pulled him into a hug. Unfortunately, it became apparent she had Motives for the hug when it went on just a bit too long. “Now, Harry, don’t be angry. I really did think it was meant to be me...”
Harry considered for all of two seconds. “Yeah, but I want to find out more about that music, don’t you? Listen, if they’re Wizarding, you can just do your ‘the Ministry cares for your concerns’ bit, and if they’re Muggle you can be posh at them, either way maybe we can get some dessert and a cuppa. Unless you’re actually frightened?”
“My fault.” Harry sighed. “I know, and I’m sorry. I thought it would be a fun little adventure, maybe even an inside joke, and I didn’t stop to think. We should be alright for now, though, and people from the Ministry will be looking for us soon enough.”
The bolt of worry was sharp enough to turn Draco’s eyes from the panorama to his companion. “Er, Harry? I’m Draco. Did you forget?”
Draco staggered into the hotel room and collapsed face-first onto one of the ridiculously large beds. “Civilization at last. Proper, comfortable beds. Meals that aren’t somebody’s Gran’s recipe. No roosters whatsoever. Bliss.” He gave a heartfelt groan, and Harry chuckled as he went around the room, doing his security checks and setting the wards. As he came around to where he could see half of Draco’s face, mashed into the duvet, the one visible eye opened and gave him a half-hearted glare. “And if you ever tell
The restaurant they were directed to was casual, but in a classy way that had Draco nodding in approval; the meal itself turned out to be lovely, succulent meat and crisp vegetables, and the conversation was unexpectedly lovely as well. They were both careful to stay away from their school years, aside from funny anecdotes and Quidditch rivalry, but they still had a myriad of topics to discuss and debate, from Shakespeare (Draco loved the audacity of creating so many new words and phrases) to comparative fashion (Harry vehemently defended the practicality of trousers rather than robes). Harry didn’t even mind paying for both of them. (He explained to Draco how he had set himself up a Muggle bank account, what his debit card was, and how one was used. Draco immediately began to get Ideas.)
“Harry!” Draco’s exasperation was shaded with fondness. “And where do you think you’re going?”
Behind him, Harry slipped through as well, but Draco’s attention was caught by the landscape around them. They were standing on a long, narrow stretch of beach, pale sand bounded on one side by a riot of lush vegetation, and on the other by the ocean, glowing both from some bioluminescence below the surface and from the reflection of the sky. For it was the sky that commanded attention, overflowing with stars, a thousand times more stars than they had ever seen from the Astronomy Tower.
Halfway across the meadow, Draco grabbed Harry by the arm. “Wait. We don’t know whose place this is. Maybe we shouldn’t.”
“And so gracious of you to give up your spot to me, Granger. One might almost think you like me.” The look on Malfoy’s face was more a genuine smile than the sneer Harry was expecting, and he was dressed in an unexpectedly Muggle (though still unfairly attractive) style of a black suit, with black shirt and black-on-black tie. It made his skin and hair glow like a star come to Earth, and Harry really needed to stop writing florid poetry in his head. He was an adult, dammit! A professional!
The spell had been elaborate, but Draco’s knowledge of theoretical magic was next to none. There wasn’t a book passage he couldn’t quote, and he possessed the outstanding ability to take just about any spell apart. He knew exactly how to lay out a spell’s entire history, how it had developed over time, as well as how it reacted with other spells, and what worked best to counter or amplify it. His knowledge of potions was equally as impressive, although for those he occasionally still needed to consult the books.
Harry shuddered and pressing his lips to Draco’s neck, he hummed.
This time he lingered for longer, teased Draco’s lips with the tip of his tongue, and even pushed past them and into Draco’s mouth.
“Thanks for the tea, pet, that was very kind of you.”
Draco snorted and dissolved into laughter.
“No, little man. Apparition is out, too. I think we’ll take Muggle transport.”
“Surprise,” he said, “family cures all ails, Teddy especially.”
Molly smiled in returned and mildly concerned, Harry instinctively knew that his adopted mother was about to say something he mightn’t necessarily want to hear. He inhaled deeply, took a small sip from his champagne flute, and inwardly braced himself for whatever Molly was about to say. What he wasn’t prepared for was Molly inquiring about his and Draco’s relationship.
“An accomplice we never caught?”
“I don’t need to prove what I already know.”
“Last I checked, Potter, this was my office, and just because you’re a wilful prat and decide to shift in the middle of a conversation that isn’t entirely going your way, doesn’t mean I’ll hand you the keys.”
Draco knew he could trust him; he didn’t have to make any decisions because Harry knew what he was doing. He didn’t have to hold himself together. He could drop his protective mask and just be.
“Can I help please?”
Harry teased him with his fingers and tongue. He fucked him, stroked his cock, and worked him up until incessant pleas fell from Draco’s lips entirely out of their own volition.
Harry grinned and squeezed his hand tightly.
His eyes twinkled with genuine amusement, and the corners of his mouth curled upward.
Libby looked even more outraged. She stomped her little foot and crossed her arms over her chest.
In direct response, Harry felt Draco relax even further and remaining silent, he gave his husband another few minutes to soak up as much fresh air as he wanted and needed.
He couldn’t work out whether Harry had played him and they were still at the Ministry or whether they’d returned home to Grimmauld Place. His instinct repeatedly tried telling him that he was home, but there was a nagging doubt at the back of his mind, and no matter how hard he tried, it refused to dissipate.
“Yes, Sir.”
Draco turned into his arms.
Harry smiled.
Combined with succulent pieces of freshly-baked fish folded into creamy blankets of white sauce and crispy-topped, buttery mash, chenin blanc was the kind of wine that turned fish pie into a dish one might order at a Michelin three-star restaurant; an exceptional meal worth a special journey. According to Harry, it wasn’t the wine that made the fish pie special, but all the effort Draco had put into getting everything just right. He’d prepared everything from scratch, refusing to use anything that had been made in advance. To a certain extent, it had stopped him from fretting about tonight’s dinner. Although, the moment he’d placed the pie inside the oven, all that had changed and he’d come very close to sinking into a state of complete hysteria.
Even though Harry loved to dominate him, and even though he loved to submit, they always treated each other as equals, and it was one of the many reasons why Draco simply couldn’t get enough of surrendering all control to Harry. Even when kneeling, with his arms tightly bound behind his back, Draco didn’t feel worthless. Harry saw his submission as a gift and treated him with the utmost respect and kindness in return. Yes, he had rules, and yes, he demanded obedience, but there was something so inherently liberating about letting go and handing the reins over to Harry that just thinking about it was enough to send a surge of excitement through Draco.
This time, he absolutely didn’t manage to hide his amusement.
Draco felt Harry push passed him and feeling like someone had forcefully yanked a rug from underneath his feet, he reached out to steady himself on a nearby sturdy-looking wooden shelf. He gripped it tightly, and thoroughly dazed, he watched as Harry, jigsaw in his hands, made his way to the front of the shop and towards to elderly man behind the counter.
Narcissa’s statement told Harry that he hadn’t done a very good job at hiding the direction of his thoughts. She’d clearly read him like an open book ― Harry didn’t feel self-conscious about that either. There was literally no force that was strong enough to possess the power to make him want to stop showing the world how much he loved Draco, and he didn’t even care how utterly corny and clichéd that sounded. Draco was his and Harry wanted everyone to know. He was quite happy to scream it from the rooftops, although he doubted that he ever would. There were far better ways to show Draco how much he cared and how deeply in love he was with him.
Harry nodded.
After about ten minutes, Harry eased up, and instead of tickling him, he simply sat astride him and beamed down at him. His green eyes sparkled with joy and he chortled with excitement.
By the third word of the first line, his gaze was firmly fixed on Harry, and without breaking their eye contact, he spoke with conviction. He felt his self-assurance grow slowly and steadily, and with each line, he lost himself a little further in the moment, relaxed, and enjoyed himself a bit more.
“Please do.”
The gleeful sparkle in Draco’s silvery-grey eyes made Harry’s lips curl upward, and he smiled.
Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but by the time he had finished about half of his coffee, Harry called out to him from the doorway, announcing his return.
Draco let his eyes linger on the open case file. He knew how long it took to complete these blasted forms and he couldn’t help but admire Harry’s attention to detail.
“I’ll hold you accountable if she does.”
“Er, I’m just going to move over here,” Charlie said.
Draco shrugged.
“Yes, Sir. I’m a bit cold though.”
Draco sat up and grinned.
“I thought about inviting you over a couple of times,” he said, his voice low and quiet, muffled by the fact that he was practically speaking into his tea.
“Take all the time in the world, my little prince.”
“Please.”
“I have a little gift for you, my love,” he said.
Harry smirked.
Draco nodded.
“Fabulous. Listen, I have a proposal, though I’m not entirely sure whether you’d be interested…”
Harry shook his head.
“Do you want help?” he asked.
Harry huffed out his prompt and Draco groaned.
“I won’t, Sir.”
Falling into a comfortable pace, Harry walked alongside Draco and together, they made their way through the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and towards the lifts.
Draco smiled.
Draco snarled under his breath and scowled darkly, but since he wasn’t looking at Harry, his efforts were entirely lost and did absolutely nothing to quench Harry’s sassy cheerfulness.
Surprised, and also somewhat taken aback, by Draco’s assertiveness and the complete confidence that oozed out of his every pore, Harry promptly closed his mouth again, and for the time being, he decided to remain silent.
Well, we're slowly but surely getting to the end of this wonderful tale but fear not, I am planning a third part, as I would like to play with a different aspect of a D/s dynamic within a relationship entirely.
“But never with my hard cock sheathed inside your mouth and my fingers tightly twisted in your hair, holding you in place like the good boy I know you’d be for me, Harry.”
“Honestly, Reid, if your wank fantasies include Harry and me having kinky sex, I really don’t want to know.”
Draco smiled softly, faintly.
“Blab about what exactly? Our weekly luncheons and your strong preference for animal-based proteins? The fact that you seem to have entirely too much time on your hands which leads me to believe that you’re either not qualified to lead the Auror force or that the job isn’t taxing enough? Or, if whatever you’re so terrified of sharing with me, is of a more personal nature, and you’re tired of being Britain’s most eligible bachelor, let me just tell you, there are much easier ways to get the press interested in your probably non-existent love life.”
“That’s some praise, Draco Malfoy. Thank you.”
“She’s going to tell everyone before the day is out,” he whined.
Draco sighed.
Harry looked thoroughly sour, and a feeling of unease spread from the pit of Draco’s stomach through the rest of his body. He tightened his hold on the two decorative pillows, Harry had asked him to fetch from the living room and pressed his lips together. A moment later, he parted them with the very intention of saying something, but Harry shook his head and motioned towards the bed.
He let a soft and warm bubble of laughter to rise up through him and allowed it to escape past his slightly-parted lips, filling the room with his signature chuckle. It was warm like the early rays of the summer sun, thick as pure, golden honey and carried the same sort of natural sweetness as the sugary nectar found deep inside the centre of a healthy beehive.
“And you’re fucking unbelievable when you do, my little prince. You absolutely are something special, and I love you.”
His attention drifted towards the large walk-in shower behind him although he was in his own bathroom, he couldn’t help but replay the memory of what he’d just witnessed. His mind remained stuck on the stunning artwork that sprawled across Draco’s back, and instead of at least trying to rein his thoughts in, Harry, now once again in the privacy of his own hotel suite, allowed them to run wild.
Draco was about to make yet another scathing remark, but Harry moved his hand and resting it just above his knee, he squeezed gently.
Harry looked so fucking smug that Draco had to swallow again.
Harry wanted to say something sarcastic in response to that, but he couldn’t come up with anything even remotely derisive to say. Caleb had a point. The higher up the chain you got, the less fieldwork was required of you, although Harry often made it a point to take a trip out into the field. He simply couldn’t stand remaining scooped up in his office all day while his Aurors had all the fun. It wasn’t so much about drawing his wand and actually participating in a duel that did it for him. The fact that he was not sitting on his behind in his office was enough to make him feel better.
“Much better.”
He shuddered and focused on the patterns Harry was drawing on his arm.
When Harry had first approached him about a possible partnership, Draco had been quite wary.
Draco chuckled, turned on his heel and left the workshop. He strode through the shop, waved at George on the way out and leaving the shop, he headed down Diagon Alley and towards The Leaky Cauldron, grinning like a complete loon all the way there. He barely resisted to rub the palms of his hands together in glee, and shoving them into the outer pockets of his robes, he thoroughly basked in his excitement.
“Yes, Sir.”
“No, thank you, my love. Thank you for being brave and thank you for giving me such an amazing gift.”
“Ready for more, my little prince?” he asked.
Walter wakes from his slumber, lazily stretches, then jumps off the sofa, and follows him, dutifully trotting alongside him. It feels like they’re a team, and Harry can’t help but chuckle under his breath. It’s true. He and Walter really are a team. Despite all their bickering and all their debates, they have each other’s back, and even though Walter doesn’t speak his language, Harry instinctively knows that his crup would protect him with his life. The knowledge of that fills him with the kind of reassuring warmth that makes his heartbeat just a little faster.
It didn’t take much longer until Harry finally exploded deep inside of him, filling him with his come, and Draco held perfectly still and allowed Harry to ride out his orgasm.
“Of course. We can all have tea together next Sunday if you like. Actually, maybe you can help me convince Nana Tonks to come too.”
“I mean it, Draco, last warning, or you’ll have to content yourself with a very sore bottom.”
But Draco Malfoy, well, Draco Malfoy wasn’t most people, and as such, he didn’t play by most people’s rules. He didn’t follow invitations to sit down, in fact, he frowned upon them. Although, some days, Harry couldn’t help but wonder whether Draco only frowned upon
Draco nodded.
Harry chuckled.
“We’ve had that conversation, Scorp, when you’re older I’ll teach you how to create those, and then you can design your very own protective sigils. In the meantime, if you ever find another Boggart under your bed, you’ll just scream at the top of your lungs, and I’ll be there to banish it in an instant.”
Whenever Draco thought he’d worked out Harry’s pattern, he changed it up, and the heavy fogginess in Draco’s brain began to increase.
“Mine?” he asked. “Why?”
A loud bang, followed by a whoosh, crackle, and then a fizz that dies off in a strange sort of whistle has Harry sitting upright in bed. His back rigid and straight and his right hand is clutched firmly around his eleven-inch-long holly wand with its phoenix feather core. Because apparently, not even the fact that he left his position as the Head of the Auror Department some twenty-two months ago can shake the habit of a lifetime. Being on guard, always alert, quick to react―even as he lies asleep in his bed―well, that’s become second nature now, hasn’t it? His razor-sharp Auror reflexes, executed with the swiftness and accuracy of a naturally-gifted Seeker, are responses to any minute stimulus, and he performs them without conscious thought or the bat of an eye.
Yes, he kneeled for Harry.
“Guess I’ll have to let the wolf out after all,” he said.
“I’m just as competitive as the next guy, Malfoy. I’d sooner consent to be put into Azkaban-grade shackles than lose a competition on purpose.”
“Hm, you do have a couple of secrets that make you interesting.”
“If you want to know whether I fancy you or not, who the fuck doesn’t? Have you seen yourself lately?”
Draco tugged gently.
“Are you close, my little prince?”
Again, this website also offers a lot of interesting reading material, so anyone who wants to learn more, I recommend it for quality information.
Teddy nodded vigorously.
Charlie watched him for a few minutes, then resolutely reached out, grabbed his wrist and stopped him. He stood up, pulled Draco into a hug and held him tight. For a few seconds, Draco attempted to wriggle free, then he slowly relaxed and eventually, he even reciprocated the embrace.
Harry turns his attention back to Walter and tells his crup precisely what he thinks of him, namely that Walter is utterly despicable. He reminds him―quite firmly―that it is Saturday, that he doesn’t have to work, that day hasn’t even broken yet and that Rose and Hugo are at Cochach’s Grange, then pauses long enough to fix Walter with a long, stern glare.
Harry snorted.
“Good boy, you’re really quite perfect, do you know that, my sweet little prince?”
“How do you feel?” he asked.
Harry clicked his tongue.
“It’s OK, Harry, I’ve got you, let it all out, it’s OK. I’m here for you, always. I’ve got you. I won’t let you go.”
Narcissa rolled her eyes, and although she tried to suppress it, she still snorted with amusement. She took a moment to collect herself, and once she had, she smoothed out her dress and reached for the ring box.
After lunch, and a brief catchup with several of the other staff members, Harry makes his way to the inner courtyard to find Teddy, who has a free period and is eager to spend a bit of time with him. They sit in the sun, backs propped up against the cool stones of a low wall, and chat about Teddy’s studies.
, he thought but not stopping to react to Harry’s statement, Draco left for the bathroom where he relieved himself and washed his hands with warm water and soap afterwards.
“Like I just said Barrister Norton appears to be under the impression that you insisted on taking over the case, maltreated her client and verbally abused him on several occasions. Could you give the court your version of events, Director Potter, Sir?”
He cleared his throat, tugged on the sleeves of his shirt, and plucked a tiny piece of white fluff off his black designer slacks.
Draco inhaled deeply and slowly opened his eyes, blinking several times to adjust his vision.
“Please what?”
“Will you help me cook tea for Harry?”
“It isn’t a kidnapping,” he says.
“Please what?”
Harry took another sip from his coffee and smiling, he waited for Draco to finish devouring a second biscuit.
“I know, and you know that I won’t take any chances and push my own boundaries.”
“Hush, not a word.”
Ron rolled his eyes at them.
“It really is OK, you know, I like you anyway.”
It didn’t matter how many deep breaths he took to try and ground himself; the anticipation refused to subside.
Harry grinned.
He threw his head back and actually laughed.
“You can’t?”
Hullo Strange World.
“This, I love this, Sir, it’s everything. Scratch me with, make me feel I’m yours, leave your marks wherever you please, I’ll wear each one with pride, knowing you gave them to me as a token of your love.”
Shiny silver sheets covered the bed on the far side of the room, and strong vines with luxurious white roses climbed up the frame of the bed, winding themselves around each bedpost, and slithering through the bed’s bondage hooks and suspension rings.
“Spare me the lecture, Malfoy, just make it happen.”
Right this very moment, Draco’s entire world revolved around Harry; he was the only thing that mattered.
He couldn’t help it.
He nodded.
Draco most definitely hadn’t appreciated his sarcastic comment about how the squeaking could also be taken as proof of a highly enjoyable intimate moment or two. His silvery grey eyes had narrowed to tiny slits, and he’d pressed his lips to tightly together that Harry had taken a cautious step back before suggesting that they look at over options. Somehow, the change of topic had satisfied Draco enough to drop the subject.
He’d very much anticipated that reaction.
Draco shrugged.
For a moment, Draco was tempted to ask Scorpius whether he wasn’t a bit too old for that sort of nonsense, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to utter those words.
“Don’t tempt me. And, may I just say, if you spent less time ogling various behinds, all belonging to the male gender mind, then perhaps rags such as
“Surely you have heard of the Hotel George V?”
Draco scoffed, then defiantly held his gaze.
“Thank you, Sir.”
“That’s just because I want to get to the bottom of all those secrets and I figured spending as much time as possible near you will absolutely help me with that.”
Harry recalled the spanking he’d given Draco late yesterday afternoon and licked his lips at the titillating memory of it ― it almost instantly ignited a spark inside of him that surged down his spine and pooled low in his groin, a definite sign of arousal. The spanking hadn’t been a punishment or part of one of their regular sessions but a reward.
He shook the box lightly, but whatever was inside did not make a single sound. Dithering for another minute or two, he eventually undid the silver satin wrapping ribbon and rolling it up, he placed it on the coffee table, beside his empty coffee mug. He tapped the lid, took a deep breath and pulled the cover off the box, then gasped.
“If he stirs, come find me immediately.”
“So is telling me to fuck off when I remind you that you forgot to buy milk.”
“Jacket too.”
“I’m scared, Harry,” he whispered into the small space between them.
It had taken him until now, a whole day later, to find a bit of time to sample the beans. Bringing the cup up and closer to his lips, Draco took another deep breath through his nose, allowing the coffee’s exquisite palette of flavours to assault all of his senses.
“I love you too.”
“If you’re good, my little prince, only if you’re good,” he simply said.
“No.”
Tentatively, and just a little scared that he was dreaming all this, Draco extended his hand and placed his fingertips on top of the bracelet. Initially, it was cold to the touch, but the moment his skin connected with the precious metal, it warmed and send a jolt of magic through him.
Knowing Harry, they were elaborate and highly detailed Shibari knotting patterns or a series of ancient runes, but no matter how hard Draco tried to discern even just a single one of them, he could not. To him, none of the motions made any sense.
“But,” he says a bit too high-pitched and hastily clears his throat, then swallows hard, “that means there’s the intent, and that makes it
“As a matter of fact, we’re not, though I’m not entirely sure why―”
Draco’s theatrics had always been and would always be a source of his amusement.
It was easy to see that Caleb was an excellent Dom. He always looked out for Stefan, cared about him, and went out of his way to make him feel safe and loved and protected. Draco imagined that their relationship wasn’t all that different from Harry’s and his. On the spot, Draco could only think of a single exception between their relationship and Harry’s and his. Caleb’s and Stefan’s D/s dynamic was a lot more defined, and whenever he was around Caleb, Stefan always referred to him as Sir.
“I can. I just don’t want to.”
He purposefully made Draco aware of the fact that he was in for a whole lot of teasing.
“I heard that,” he said.
Stepping out from behind the curtain, where he’d been hiding to be able to keep an eye on Draco, he straightened up, squared his shoulders, and cleared his throat.
“Let’s go over the top then.”
Draco laughed.
“Sweet one, I love you.”
“Such a good boy, hm, you’re perfect tonight, my love, absolutely perfect.”
She was his only daughter, his pride and joy. The two of them were extremely close, and Draco couldn’t find any fault in that ― he shared the same kind of bond with Scorpius.
“No.”
Draco made a mental note to add the invention of a concoction that cleansed his mind of anything related to Potter to his long list of potions he needed to research.
Afterwards, he gently eased out of Draco, rolled off him, and spooning around him, he held him tight and charmed the duvet to cover them both. He mumbled a half-hearted cleaning charm to remove some of the stickiness from the sheets, pressed a kiss between Draco’s shoulder blades and pulled him as close against his own body as he possibly could.
Draco chuckled.
“So, do you think that Harry, maybe, loves me too?”
“If you let me, I might be able to help with that.”
Charlie hollered with laughter.
In an instant, Draco’s mind flooded with a million and one questions, but before he could ask any one of them, Potter had already dragged the door open, squeezed through the gap, and left.
Draco melted and felt the intense urge to slide off the sofa and crawl across the room. He wanted to kneel at Harry’s feet and surrender every part of himself to Harry. The desire and need to do so was almost overwhelming, and Draco didn’t feel the slightest bit embarrassed about feeling this way.
Ron had that uncanny ability to dig his nails in and demand that they talk about things―undoubtedly a trait he’d learnt from Hermione―and Harry wasn’t in the mood to talk.
“How much?”
Draco pressed his thumb against Scorpius lip and kissed his forehead.
“Well, if you’re already asking so nicely, there’s just no way I can deny you.”
It had taken some extensive renovations, and a lot of help from his dedicated team of firefighters, to turn the three separate flats into one large house. Somehow, he and Stefan had persevered all through the chaos that came with living on a construction site and now had the pleasure of sharing a stunning and absolutely spacious home.
On Tuesday morning, after tossing and turning for most of the night, unable to sleep peacefully and refusing to down a phial of Dreamless Sleep, Harry had nearly floo’ed to the Ministry in his pyjamas. After losing a pointless battle with the fancy clasp of his Auror robes, he’d smashed his favourite mug in anger, then stormed out the front door, muttering incomprehensibly under his breath.
“I swear that I’ll always be your faithful and loyal submissive, to honour you, respect you, and let you guide me, teach me, and protect me. I promise to trust you, obey you, and accept you as my one true Master. I desire your pain, your pleasure, your love, the safety of your embrace, and the comfort of your words. I swear to love you for all eternity. I, Draco Malfoy, will always be your little prince.”
He stubbornly swallowed it back down, refusing to give up all control just yet. Instead, he focused and made Harry the centre of his attention. He watched with intrigue as Harry casually leant back against the sturdy and decorative wooden bottom baluster of the staircase that led up to the second floor of the house. A memory of Harry using a single coil of rope to tie him to that very pillar before teasing him endlessly―and until he’d seriously struggled to remain upright―flashed through Draco’s mind.
Harry forced out a raspy ‘thanks’, then glanced back at down at the photograph, Narcissa had sent him and smirked.
Somehow, that only made Draco laugh harder, and annoyed, Harry rose to his feet, downed the rest of his drink, and snatched that phial of Dreamless Sleep from Draco’s hand. As he did that, he felt the warmth of Draco’s pale skin against his own, and although he’d been determined to stalk off, it stopped him in his tracks. He and Draco had touched plenty of times on plenty of occasions but something about today’s touch had just caught him off-guard.
Draco shook his head.
For some reason, the expression reminded Harry of a thoroughly content cat that, after having lapped up a plate of kitten-friendly cream, was in a state of peaceful happiness. He briefly considered telling Draco, but then remembered what had happened the last time he’d been bold enough to compare Draco to a cat.
“You know, I think you may have a point. I should do a bit more thinking.”
“You should humour me,” Draco said, cutting his mother off.
He reached out to ruffle Teddy’s hair which turned turquoise underneath his touch, then white-blond when he withdrew his hand.
His behind tingled pleasantly, and a swell of anticipation washed over him. It rolled down his shoulders and trickled along his spine, then pooled low in the centre of his groin, increasing the throbbing sensation in both his buttocks. He swallowed hard and quietly followed Stefan down the staircase and into the airy open-plan kitchen with its light and smooth wooden flooring. The kitchen led straight into a spacious dining room, and leaning against the multi-purpose island in the centre of the room, Draco watched Stefan fill the electric kettle with freshly filtered water, then flick the switch.
try to proposition me, offering me kinky sex?”
He did so unhurriedly, starting with his black woollen vest, and pulling it above his head, he folded it neatly, and placed it on the chair.
Harry laughed.
This time, he breached Draco’s tight hole, pushed his finger in up to the second knuckle and slowly finger-fucked Draco.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him.
“No,” Draco said.
Liam smiled and pushed into his loving touch, clearly enjoying every single second of it.
“Not just yet, Malfoy, I think you can last a little longer.”
For a moment, Harry remained silent, and his expression was entirely unreadable.
He carried his precious little prince out of the cell, and through the very realistic replica of his office, then strode down the corridor and descended one flight of stairs down to the third floor of his and Draco’s home. Like he’d done so many times before, Harry carried Draco straight into their bedroom and gently placed him on top of their bed.
They woke the next morning to the crowing of a rooster, lying together in an overgrown, dew-soaked meadow circled by an old stone wall. They shifted, looking at each other and around them, and a piece of parchment crinkled between them. Harry pulled it out and unrolled it. “If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumbered here, whilst these visions did appear-” He snorted and let the parchment roll back up. “Well, Puck. I guess I’m glad we weren’t on an alien planet?”
!” Still nothing, and Draco wasn’t even sure he’d felt the magic moving through him. “
