They went downstairs to the new sports area on the ground floor and Harry praised the gym, especially the pool. When the Healer confessed to being a really bad swimmer, Harry offered to help and added, “But of course we have a professional swimming instructor as well, it’s the Muggle Studies teacher, Professor Laddley – he’s just a bit… unpopular at the moment.”
When the applause ebbed down McGonagall shouted, “Miss Malfoy, please come to the staff table and enlighten us about your motto!”
“Well, now we’ve established the fact that sometimes you’re an idiot, just like everybody else. Good. And like everybody else, Harry, you have a family. And that’s us, the Weasleys. So you better let us take part in your life, whatever is going on, promise?”
“That’s one way of putting it… you have to understand, Harry, the only witchards I’ve ever been close to are Cass, our Nanny and my mother. Most certainly not my father or any other man… hell, I never even had a close pal!” He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to tidy up the mess Otto had left.
He wrapped his arms around Hermione and said, “We have the most amazing costumes prepared! Hell, I’ve even shaved my legs already – I sure want to go to that ball with you!”
“It’s been doing this since I came to the room a few minutes ago,” Luna said, “I just wanted to fetch you. Professor Flitwick said, we should tell you immediately, if something unusual happened in this painting.”
“I only found out later, when I met him at Andromeda’s – I told you about that!” Harry said somewhat defensively.
Well, Harry had no such inhibitions. He brooded all week over Draco’s story and pondered how to find out what exactly had happened between Laddley and Lucius Malfoy. Only at dinner time on Friday, when Seamus complained they were still not allowed to go Hogsmeade this weekend, Harry finally knew what he had to do.
that he immensely regrets that and honestly tries to do better now! And you can’t blame him for me being gay either, he did not seduce me, in fact, he didn’t even want us to be together in the first place! It took quite an effort to persuade him!” He crossed his arms in front of his chest and stared at her.
Draco put his father out of his mind as he set to putting together a tray of food to bring up to Harry. Adding two freshly made cups of tea, Draco made his way back to the bedroom, pausing only slightly to appreciate the view of Harry stretched across the bed, his face pressed into Draco’s pillow.
In the days that followed Harry requested a few personal days, and despite the firm rules governing Auror training, Kingsley granted his request. Harry spent the majority of his time off at Grimmauld Place, hiding from the media and unwanted attention. He had thus far refused to speak publicly about Draco's death, and he continued to openly dismiss rumours that he was relieved by the death of his so-called “second greatest enemy.”
Draco nodded, "Yes. This is goodbye. When the sun rises in the morning, all of this will be forgotten. You will return to your role as the Chosen One and I will return to my role as not only the heir of the Malfoy estate but as a Death Eater within the Dark Lord's ranks." Draco swallowed thickly, willing the tears forming in his eyes not to fall before continuing, "This is the only way Harry. I wish it wasn't. I wish we could just freeze time but we can't. We both have obligations, duties only we can fulfil….so goodbye, Harry…" The last few words were said in a whisper as Draco's voice finally betrayed him and cracked.
“How bold of her to assume I want you to stay.” Draco spoke up, breaking the tension in the room, and Harry laughed.
What followed was an uncomfortable silence for Draco and a perfectly normal pause in conversation for Luna, as she had gotten used to prolonged pauses. Finally, Draco worked through what she had said enough to ask a question.
“And I’m always right.” Draco looked please with himself as he gave Harry’s dick a squeeze. “Don’t tell me the prospect of security protocol has got you this excited.”
The Phoenix Ward for Long-term Trauma and Rehabilitation, St. Mungo’s newest addition, would open its doors to patients tomorrow. It was a project three years in the making and was to serve both as a tribute to the victims of the War and as a place where survivors could go for support and recovery. In light of the Ward’s purpose, Draco wasn’t really sure what he was doing at its opening night, so to speak.
Not bothering to look and see if the elf had left, Harry walked into the dormitory and sighed, looking around with nostalgia, remembering all of the time he had spent in this room with Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. He couldn’t help but feel a bit grateful that his four housemates had all been spared in the battle. Setting down his food on his bed side table, Harry shrugged off his jacket, leaving it on the floor has he crawled onto his four-poster, reviling in the softness of the mattress. Rolling onto his back, Harry reached over and picked up a sandwich.
Hermione rolled her eyes and sat on a nearby stool, “That’s not what I meant you know it.” When Draco didn’t respond, she added, “He’s in pain, Draco.”
“You know my parents expect me to marry and produce a legitimate heir. They know I’m gay and it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s my duty as a Malfoy. I’ve told them that I won’t marry a woman, let alone date one, and it seems like they’ve finally started believing me because they started to arrange dates for me. I found ways to refuse all of them so this time they just didn’t tell me. They invited me out to dinner and invited someone they felt was a suitable match.” Draco let out a long breath.
Healer Morin shook his head, “We gave him something to help with the pain and to keep him asleep. He’ll be under its effects for a while.” He paused, “Perhaps it’d be best for you to return to the DMLE. We will notify you when Mr. Malfoy is awake and able to answer questions.”
With all the commotion that was unfolding in front of him, Draco watched with curious interest as Weasley and Granger returned, hand in hand, but Harry was nowhere to be seen. Draco thought about this as he watched two thirds of the Golden Trio reunite with the rest of the Weasley family, who were still sitting around the lifeless body of one of the twins; Draco didn't know which one. Looking around, Draco felt mixture of remorse and grief for the lives lost during the battle, and a sense of relief that it really was over.
Harry watched as Draco’s features softened, his shoulders sagging a bit, and carefully, slowly, Harry reached out a hand to cup Draco’s face, thumb brushing along a delicate cheekbone. Shuffling closer until he was right in front of the other man, Harry leaned in slowly, stopping a hair’s breadth away from Draco’s face, still unsure if his intrusion into Draco’s space would be welcomed.
"You." Breathed Draco as he moved his hands to rest on top of Harry's that were still cupping his face. Draco let he his eyes fall shut, and Harry was left studying a face that only he got to see.
"Oh Harry," Hermione breathed as she got up and rushed to her friend's side. Wrapping an arm around his waist, Hermione took his weight, and slowly lowered them to the floor, where she pulled Harry close as he continued hold the bracelet tightly to his lips. Ron came up behind the pair, and putting an arm across each of their shoulders acted as the anchor that held the three together for the time being.
Seeing that the other man knew he wasn't joking, Harry returned to the club and made his way back to where a few of his friends were still gathered. Pointedly ignoring their questions, Harry just stood there, his arms crossed in front of him defensively, mentally cursing himself for being such a bloody moron.
“Auror Potter,” Healer Morin said again, more sternly, “Is your interest with this patient personal or professional?”
Taking the hand gingerly, Harry moved closer to Draco’s bed. When he was close enough, he let go of Draco’s hand, instead reaching out to stroke the side of Draco’s face, tracing some of the less serious burns already healing.
“You didn’t know it was a date.” Hermione finished, “Oh Draco, I’m sorry. When we saw you, you looked like you were enjoying yourself. We never thought you hadn’t planned it.”
Smiling, Harry invited him back to a table, the two carrying on easy conversation the entire time. And when Miguel got up to get them more drinks, Harry took the opportunity the flag down Neville and ask about for some more details about his foreign friend.
Draco nodded, and turning back to his potions table, began pulling various instruments towards him. “Is there any other information you can tell me about the potion or its creator?” He asked.
“Don’t get short with me,” Hermione said mildly. She didn’t say anything else and Draco squirmed a bit under her intense gaze.
“This floo connection is for Aurors only.” The wizard said, walking closer. “Hang on. I know who you are.”
"Over the years, you and Harry have been told that you have to hate each other. Your destinies have been intertwined from the beginning. It is not hard to see how such a strong emotion like hate could be transformed into another strong emotion like love, especially with the terrors of the past year and everything you both have had to face." Luna paused, looking directly at Draco before she continued, "if you want my opinion, I think the two of you make quite the distinguished pair."
Draco was momentarily taken aback at the venom in Ron’s voice—they’d been getting along better lately but he recovered quickly and said, “Is Harry with you guys? He not home and we had dinner plans.”
“Is this a new questioning procedure I am unaware of, Auror Potter?” Auror Hanson asked recovering first, and Harry felt himself go red.
“Sorry Draco,” Harry apologized again, as he straightened up equally as slow. He placed the jars back on the table, brushing Draco’s arm as he reached to set the others right as well. “I don’t know what made me so clumsy all of a sudden.”
Harry started to reply to the elf before he was cut off by the elf grabbing his hand and leading him towards his room. "Please, Harry Potter sir, we don't have much time. Master is very sick, very sick indeed. We need to get you dressed before Master…" The elf couldn't continue as she was overcome with tears. Harry sensed the urgency in her voice and continued into him room, picking up a pair of jeans a t-shirt on his way to the bathroom.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, and Draco wrapped his arms protectively around his middle as he went on. “I came home Friday-we’d planned to have take-out and play chess, but he was gone. And Weasley wouldn’t let me see him.” Draco took a shuddering breath, “He ignored me all weekend and the wards have locked me out.”
A look of resolved passed over Hermione’s face and she stood up, reaching for a quill and some parchment.
Tilley was busy placed two enormous platters full of all sorts of food down on the table, so Draco used his wand to clean up his spilt tea and got up to refill the kettle.
Narcissa closed her book, “That is quite alright Draco,” she said, studying Draco carefully. “I trust you had a pleasant Christmas morning.”
Harry’s eyes flashed again. Draco felt a shiver go through him at the energy that was rolling off Harry and then he ducked as a figuring on the mantle behind him exploded.
“Oh,” Draco breathed, opening his eyes that had fallen shut at some point. He spun on his stool to face Harry, who was about to make a comment about the flush spreading up Draco’s cheeks but before he get a word out, Draco was on his knees, fumbling with the button on Harry’s jeans.
“Hypothetically, if I wanted a reminder…” Draco's voice trailed off as he bit the corner of his lip.
Straightening himself, Harry hurried out of the waiting area, following the Healers who had come out of Draco’s room. As it was, they had barely closed the door before Harry was standing in front of them.
The feeling of Harry clenching around him and the sight of Harry's cum covering his stomach was too much for Draco. He too came; calling out Harry's name has emptied himself in Harry.
Sure enough, it was nearly noon when Draco strolled out of the fire into the living room at the Manor. He immediately noticed his mother sitting in her favourite reading chair a little ways away. Walking over, he leaned over and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
Sensing that Draco was close, Harry gave one last long suck on his cock before releasing it from his mouth with a loud pop. Draco looked down at Harry, completely frustrated that Harry had chosen that moment to stop. Moving up to steal a kiss, Harry leaned into Draco, grinding their hips together as he whispered in a throaty voice into Draco's ear.
"I know exactly who you are Mr. Potter" Miguel smiled, and grasped Harry's hand with both of his. "It's an honour to meet you; Neville told me so much about you."
Harry was pulled from his thoughts as an uncharacteristic silence fell of over his group of friends. Looking up, it didn't take Harry long to see what they were all staring at. In the middle of the dance floor, Draco and an incredibly good looking man had totally given up on dancing and were giving a very elaborate display of public affection. Watching the couple, and knowing Draco's physical tells, Harry wasn't surprised when the couple disapparated on the spot. Why can’t it be that easy for me? Harry thought to himself as he stared at the spot where the couple had previously been.
The witch re-emerged and beckoned Harry to follow her into the back. He was intrigued when they came to a stop at the foot of a spiral staircase.
Harry raised his eyes from the report he was editing and glanced across at his desk mate, an eccentric Auror name Tim Peters who reminded Harry of  Luna. Harry shook his head, “What happened. Do we know?” He asked.
Sensing food, Harry raised his head, “Is that bacon?” His voice was thick with sleep still, but he was more awake than earlier.
He stood up and offered a hand to Draco, which Draco took if only to feel Harry’s calloused palm under his again.
Draco shrugged again, not wanting to admit out loud that for the first time he could remember, he would rather spend Christmas somewhere else than with his parents. They were both silent for a few moments, and then Harry asked, “When are your parents expecting you?”
Harry made a non-committal noise and thanked the wizard. Turning, Harry was debating what to do next-he could visit the canteen since he was going to likely miss lunch- when a familiar blonde walked slowly passed the window.
The waiting room was empty. Settling himself in one of the hard chairs that faced the door, Harry tried to focus on his breathing.
“Sorry Auror Potter,” the wizard said, “They’re still tryin to figure out that big group that came in from Beijing. And then they got a big group comin in from Egypt but it looks like some of the Chinese travelers ended in Egypt but their luggage gone missin’. It’s a mess.” Checking his schedule, he added apologetically, “I’d wager another twenty minutes at least.”
Pointing his wand at Harry’s glasses, Draco summoned them and handed them to Harry who was sitting up, rubbing a hand over his eyes.
"Where is Scorpius?" he asked in a shaking voice. Andromeda inclined her head towards the second couch, where Sophie the house elf sat with a little boy who was a spitting image of Draco. Trembling, Harry walked forward and picked up the boy, holding him close in a hug that transferred all the love he had for Draco into a new love for Scorius.
Harry remained silent as he watched Draco delicately stir a potion while adding drops of a red syrupy substance. The potion momentarily turned a brilliant pink colour before hardening into what looked like a solid cauldron-shaped brick.
Harry only moved again when he felt Draco pull back slightly. Meeting his gaze, Harry gave a small smile as he could practically see the internal battle playing out in Draco’s mind.
Reaching out, Harry took one of Draco's hands in his own and Harry moved his other hand to smooth Draco's cheek. "Shhh. It's okay Draco. You don't have to explain yourself. Your letter was more than enough explanation for me. We both have faced difficult decisions, and you acted with incredible bravery." Harry let his voice fade away, not knowing what else to say to the man lying before him.
Consulting the board in front of him, the wizard replied, “Room 416, fourth floor. They are still receiving care, but you can wait in the reception area outside of the ward.”
Smiling, Harry let himself be pulled in again, “I can do that.” He managed to get out and then he found himself to busy to say or think of anything else.
"Bring this to Harry Potter, he'll be at the Auror training centre" Draco instructed the owl as he tied the parchment to the owl's leg. Draco stroke the bird's head once before it took off, flying into the inky darkness of night. Draco watched until the owl had disappeared from sight, carrying a message that only Harry would understand—a message that Harry had to understand.
Looking down at the other man, Harry noticed for the first time a chain he wore around his neck. Reaching down, Harry caught hold of the chain and pulled up on it, revealing a gold ring dangling from the end of it.
Harry sat in shocked silence, trying to understand everything he had just read. Somebody loved him, somebody he knew. Scanning the letter again, Harry made a few mental notes about who could have possibly written this letter. It was obviously someone in his year at Hogwarts and was not in Gryffindor, the person was in the Great Hall when Voldemort was killed but did not fight with the Order. The list in Harry's mind was getting precariously short. He was so deep in thought that when he heard the loud crack indicating somebody apparated into his flat, he let out a little yell, grabbing his wand to point at the intruder. When no one appeared in his doorway, Harry got up and headed towards the place where the sound originated, moving slowly with his wand at the ready. Arriving in his living room, Harry was surprised to see a small house elf looking shaking nervously.
Draco’s eyes blinked open and he was momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar room around him. It took him a second to remember where he was and why he was there, and slowly, a smile found its way onto his face, and it kept growing until he was sure he looked ridiculous.
Harry felt some of the colour drain from his face and he swallowed thickly. The sound of his heart was so loud in his ears that he almost missed the next words.
"Call me Harry, please." Harry smiled in return, "so tell me, what would a herbologist from Brazil being doing in England in the middle of winter?"
“Shh,” Draco whispered, and he leaned in, pressing his lips to Harry’s. Sleep was definitely winning in Harry’s mind and he didn’t respond to the light pressure. But Draco relished the small sighs of contentment Harry gave as he settled back into his pillows, Draco following as he peppered Harry’s face with the slightest of kisses.
Draco opened his eyes and glanced sideways at Harry, who only grinned at him. “If someone hadn’t insisted on remaining asleep this morning, we might have had time.”
“I’m sure you have no idea,” Draco said dryly, “You know, if you stopped trying to distract me, I’d finish sooner and we could be on our way, but—” Draco sighed—“I’ll have to start this calculation over now, the spilled ink has completely ruined it.”
Deciding apparition wasn’t a good option, Harry moved towards the floo connection. He tumbled out the other end in the back room at the Leaky Cauldron, and swore as he tripped over his own feet, glasses falling and breaking as they hit the floor.
Wiping his hands on his jeans, Harry sagged back, lying down on the dusty floor, his breathing still working on returning to normal and eyes closing again.
Ron opened his mouth to say something but closed it again, recognising the look in his best mate's face. "If or when you what to talk about it, whatever it is, you know I'll be here for you mate."
Taking the vial, Draco held it up to the light, examining it with interest, “Did the others identify whose DNA was added to the potion?” he asked absently.
Harry timidly approached the bed; completely unsure of whom he would find lying there. Closing his eyes, Harry took the last few steps forward and when he opened his eyes his gaze was met by ice blue eyes that could pierce any soul.
Reaching up, Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair, moving it off his forehead and away from Harry’s eyes, which were only half-open, lazily watching Draco above him.
“Oh, you know Lee. She means well, and she wants the best for you – for both of us, I think – but everything’s so totally black and white. Maybe it’s her nature, or her age, or maybe… well, I think you can’t fight a war without realising that things aren’t always what they seem. The trials, too, and – well, it’s
taken her forty minutes and the best part of a bottle of white to make the fairly obvious connection.
“That’s everything I wanted to say, I suppose. I needed you to understand why I insisted that we keep you here, even when we thought you might not make it. Why I wouldn’t let Hannah take you to St Mungo’s. Because I still believe you deserve a second chance. The second chance you never really would have had before.” He brought his mug to his lips, draining the last dregs of his tea with a loud gulp.
for longer than a few months! Most people get crazy reckless straight away and end up behind bars, or out on the streets, or worse...”
Draco cut him off with a whine, shaking his head. It was too much, much too much. His skin prickled all over, fire spreading through his veins once more, his heart sitting high in his throat. Harry’s voice – rough and urgent – was more than he could stand. Draco reached out for him, tugging him down, skin against skin, pressed together everywhere, and still never enough.
am gonna Apparate home, take a long and leisurely bath, apply industrial quantities of healing ointments to my poor, aching limbs, and then crawl into my lovely bed and sleep for at least ten hours.”
Caught offguard, Draco’s eyelids flickered open, and he found himself staring deep into Harry’s eyes. They were the same eyes, of course, which had occupied his mind and haunted his dreams since that awful
The voices were strange – high-pitched and squeaky like house-elves. Draco fought the childish urge to giggle as they chattered away.
, missed the rush of it, the focus it gave him, the way he never had to make a decision, the sense of total invulnerability. The comedowns were getting worse and worse – pounding headaches and the constant, gnawing sensation of unease were peppered with spikes of guilt strong enough to make his heart race in his chest. And then there was the inevitable bad news which always arrived by owl early on Saturday mornings – some supplier was raising prices, some customer wanted to complain. No more letters from old schoolfriends, but Draco feared it would only be a matter of time.
Harry finds him in the study, paperwork blazing at his feet. They move as one: crockery smashed, portraits shredded, gargoyles blown to pieces. Peacocks shooed. House-elves freed.
The matches were played in the wizarding area at the Mayfair end of Hyde Park, and Draco was relieved when, on arriving at the Apparition point, he immediately caught sight of Thomas, stretching and chatting to a crowd of other witches and wizards, all wearing blue and yellow jerseys. He wandered over slowly. Thomas nodded at him, expression more wary than before. The group fell silent.
“No – no, I –” Whatever invisible force was holding Harry in place snaps then, and all at once he’s shoving the suitcase to one side, sinking to his knees in front of Draco. “Please.”
.” She inclined her head apologetically to Lee, who nodded. “And to be honest, I didn’t really believe it. I thought it might be some kind of gimmick, a publicity stunt or something. No offence,” she added quickly, as Draco winced. “But now, meeting you, I get it. Really, I do. The only thing I can’t believe is how you’ve managed to put up with Draco for so long.”
– the way the little vials nestled so comfortably in his palm, the confidence that would begin to bubble up inside him even before he removed the cork, the sour-sharp tang as the liquid slid smoothly down his throat. He swallowed, curling himself forward and tapping his fingers against the railing, watching the stream from the largest statue cascade down, disturbing the water below. He tried to empty his mind, allowing the loud rush of water to fill his ears as he stared at the bubbles, waiting for the craving to pass, just as his Mind Healer had taught him.
, Pans, and not a word from you. At least Neville bothered to show up!” As the words spilled out unbidden, Draco realised just how good it felt to finally say them, to voice all that pain and bitterness he’d kept hidden for so long. To his satisfaction, Pansy’s mouth fell open, and she floundered for a response for a while, before visibly composing herself and lifting her chin in defiance.
was, all I could think was – how could anyone blame you for doing what you had to? We might have been on different sides, but we were both motivated by the same thing. Both prepared to do whatever we had to, to defend the people we loved from Voldemort.”
“Oh, sorry,” said Potter, looking down at his clothes as though he’d only just noticed the state he was in. He waved a careless hand over his chest, and suddenly he was dry from head to toe. Draco rolled his eyes, irritated at himself for finding the casual use of wandless magic such a bloody turn-on.
“I… I don’t know quite how to put it.” She laughed, a high-pitched, false thing, which died quickly in the dusty room. The silence was deafening, and then she leant forwards.
“Draco…” Harry got to his feet, the stool scraping backwards as he moved. Draco curled the quill feather around his index finger, pulling it tight, forcing himself to continue.
talking about him, after all. But what were they talking about, dying? He wasn’t dying! He was drifting along, weightless: a feather, caught on the breeze. A boat, atop a vast golden sea.
, dancing around. Yet here Draco stood, apart, numb; fists clenching as cravings gnawed slowly into his self-restraint.

day. Six hours crouched in an alley, an evening of pointless small-talk, then jumped by you in the bloody Atrium, of all places…”
Potter looked like he might die from embarrassment, but in his eyes, Draco could see a glimmer of hope, along with a hunger which made Draco’s chest constrict and his heart beat faster with anticipation. In the silence that fell, Draco heard a small squeal from the lab and snorted fondly, casting a quick
Harry grabbed his free hand, squeezing it tightly. “I remember, Draco, of course I do. But I still don’t understand why―”

“Look,” Draco continued, “I don’t know what to say. I know nothing I say can take away what – what happened here. But my Mind Healer is always saying that avoidance never solves anything. That everything important that happens to us leaves its mark, somewhere. Sometimes it’s physical―” Draco held out his forearm, brought their joined hands to rest over the ugly, puckered skin “―and sometimes it’s all up here―” he let go of Harry’s hand, bringing his own to the side of his head “―but if you want to move forward you first have to acknowledge its presence. Make peace with your past.”
There was a faint orange glow on the horizon past the end of the pitch – the light pollution over London creating a halo above the hazy outline of skyscrapers in the distance – but elsewhere, the sky was cloudless, and the constellations shimmered and winked above them. As Harry listened to Malfoy’s soft breathing next to him, all his aches and pains seemed to melt away. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so content.
Although Pansy affected a yawn and pretended to inspect her nails, her voice rose in pitch as she spoke. “Look, darling, it’s not like I even
too much. He pushed Harry’s hand away and angrily swiped at his own face, where hot tears threatened to compound his embarrassment.
He swallowed, considering his options, when all at once he spotted an intact box tucked discreetly in a corner. He took a few hopeful steps towards it, when a sudden wave of panic knocked all the air from his lungs. The sensation of déjà vu was instant and all-consuming, and he could do nothing but stand, paralysed, bile rising in his throat, his mind trapped back in the Room of Hidden Things. Merlin, he needed to leave this place, and quickly; to lock the door and never return.
Whilst we were grateful to receive your update, I’m afraid the Dark Lord does have continuing concerns about your focus. Perhaps in the next letter you might place more emphasis on your assigned task, and less on the ‘vibrant emerald hue’ of Harry Potter’s eyes.
. He wasn’t actually as bad to the others, the ones who… I don’t know, scared him, maybe. The ones who
Draco closed the door and leant against it, regarding Potter, who seemed to also be wearing his Quidditch uniform, albeit half soaked and with that ubiquitous Auror jacket undone over the top. Potter said nothing, just stood there blinking owlishly at Draco, with his wet fringe stuck to his forehead. The only sounds were the patter of rain on the glass outside, and the steady drip-drip-drip of water off Potter’s sodden form. Draco looked pointedly at the floor, where a puddle was forming around Potter’s feet.
, Bellatrix had hissed in his ear, nails digging vice-like into his forearm as she thrust it out towards the Dark Lord. But even then – father in Azkaban, the smell of burning flesh in the air as Draco tried desperately to contain his screams – even then, he’d still

She held him tight, and he buried his nose in her hair, inhaling the familiar smell of her perfume. She swallowed, thickly, and he closed his eyes. He barely heard her whisper, so soft was her voice.
Draco wanted to scream. This was beyond his wildest dreams. Potter still actually seemed to like him, still wanted to date him,
when a few flicks of the wand were no longer an option? It gave him new respect for Muggles, along with the overwhelming desire to tell Lee, who had, after all, spent years teasing him for his inability to do anything without magic.
Draco took Harry’s hand once more, apprehension dissipating instantaneously, and let himself be led back up to the flat.
Malfoy held out his arms in surrender. “You’ve got me there.” Harry responded with a growl and a hefty but good-natured shove. Malfoy took it without complaint, flying off cheerfully to loop-the-loop above his head.
“…some fucking insane blow job―” Despite the terror of the situation, Draco allowed himself a small smirk. Harry rolled his eyes. “―Oh
He spotted his colleagues immediately – they were gathered in a group next to a large wooded area, along with the press, some Ministry officials and a good number of spectators – and headed over towards them with a spring in his step and a glint in his eye. He was halfway across the dewy pitch when his footsteps began to slow, an unpleasant realisation dawning on him. Harry was an Auror, after all – a fairly good one, by most accounts – and right now, all his senses were screaming at him that there was something very
Harry stares at the far wall, wondering whether old Mrs Rutherford still lives there; whether she’d spent the best part of the last decade with her ear pressed against the plasterboard, hoping for something to complain about.
, after everything? Why couldn’t Draco have just overcome his bizarre scruples and said yes before? What had he been
Disarmed, suddenly, both by Harry’s nakedness and the sheer earnestness writ across his face, Draco closed his eyes, so that he heard rather than saw Harry moving across the room. There came a sharp inhale, and then Harry was upon him, mouth hot and insistent, hands cupping his cheeks, crowding into Draco and forcing him back. Back, so that Draco’s legs hit the bed, and still pressing closer, until Draco had no choice but to scramble up onto those ridiculous scarlet bedsheets. Harry followed, and Draco’s bathrobe was tossed easily aside, and he fell back against the pillows, still – always – with Harry’s mouth on his.
“I’m sorry, I was just walking past and I – I thought I’d stop by. I had hoped to speak with Mr Ollivander ―”
Draco leant into him, then, shivering at both the heat behind Harry’s words and his breath against Draco’s neck. He turned, grazing their lips together lightly, letting out a gasp when Harry returned the kiss with force. Intent began to build quickly once more as Harry sent the table skidding across the floor with a wave of his hand and moved to straddle Draco. He held back for a second, clearly gauging Draco’s mood, and Draco tugged him back in, rolling his hips forwards in an obvious invitation.
After tedious repetitions Professor Flitwick finally got the class’ full attention when he said, “As I have promised you, we will also work on your Halloween costumes during the next few lessons. It will give us an excellent opportunity to explore the fine line between Charms and Transfiguration. Both subjects include spells which can change looks in a distinct way. Can anyone define the significant difference between these subjects concerning appearances?”
Harry sighed, “That’s why I have to hurry back. If they realize both of us are missing, they’ll assume we are together. So I’m going to pretend being clueless about where you are and to be only a little bit flattered by your attention but not really into you – that should do the trick.”
“I assume your lovely girlfriend had a slightly more diplomatic approach in mind,” Harry could not help grinning although the topic stung a little. Otto took off from his arm and flew three times around the kitchen lamp before taking a seat at the back of an empty chair.
“Whatever,” Ginny said, “if you’re so concerned, you’ll just have to come with us instead of going to the village, Draco!”
“Ah… of course,” Harry was relieved to hear that Cass hadn’t outed herself for his sake only and smiled at her. “You know what, I’m not sure if you’ll need my support at school – but I’m awfully glad you are here. Feels like a huge back-up for or my own coming out at Hogwarts.”
When he reached the office, the Patronus was gone and Headmistress McGonagall was sitting at her desk. She received Harry’s greeting with a stern expression and for a moment Harry was afraid, he might indeed be in trouble without knowing why.
“Don’t be afraid, I’ve never been with a guy either,” Harry said softly, “it’ll simply be something we explore together!”
“Because it’s nice? That’s why people usually put paintings on their walls. If you think Flitwick has some secret agenda, you had better been here last night after dinner instead of secretly conspiring with your side-kicks… you could have asked him.” Draco said.
Suddenly Draco raised his eyes and looked at Harry, who wanted to draw his eyes away – but was unable to do so until Draco dropped his gaze and started to fill his plate for once. Harry exhaled. At least Draco’s appetite seemed improved lately.
Harry very much doubted it. Ariana seemed totally consumed by her work which was probably a good sign.
Within the course of the week the owl seemed rather exhausted, which gave proof that Draco did not hide in the immediate neighbourhood of Hogwarts. In fact Harry had an inkling that he was staying in Edinburgh. The distance between Hogwarts and the capital of Scotland was just about the distance a well trained witchard’s owl might be able to cover twice in one night. And where else might Draco have made Muggle friends? Harry remembered Cass hinting that in previous summers Draco had fooled about at the Fringe festival. Certainly a good opportunity to meet other gay boys… whenever Harry’s mind took that path he had to force himself to stop thinking about Draco’s present companion and focus on the investigation instead.
Harry thought pouring the cup of Earl Grey he had prepared for Draco down the drain. Whatever they had shared for some days, weeks even – amity, friendship, it was obviously gone.
The silhouette of Hogsmeade appeared and Harry lowered his altitude. He landed safely outside of the village. It was considered bad manners to fly into other peoples’ property and he certainly did not want to offend the man he intended to visit. Otto on his shoulder, broom in one hand, Harry walked towards the Hog's Head Inn.
they call it, and it’s a serious crime. If Tharros were anything but correct and straightforward, she would still rot in a Japanese prison.”
Draco snorted. “You’ve got to be kidding me, Mr Potter! Remind me of that arrangement before you propose – it’ll make me reconsider.”
“I know how absurd this must sound to you. And I can hardly understand myself why, at one time in my life, that seemed to be reasonable. But so it was. Cassiopeia’s parents spoke to her in no uncertain terms about the consequences of such behaviour: she would be disowned and as good as dead to them. They argued, they threatened, they… even tried to hex her. I was shocked and begged my niece to give in for now, to confirm or to just pretend – Cassy refused firm and clear. I felt torn apart, between loyalty for my husband’s family and compassion for the child who – in my eyes – had done nothing wrong. I was desperate and pleaded with her, cried for her. She certainly must have hurt, but I cannot remember seeing her crying even once. I am ashamed to say, Draco was the only one of us standing up for Cassy. No wonder the children became even closer during that time.”
“Ron has a point. She’s a mystery in herself, having never been to Hogwarts and suddenly turning up to take sixth-year’s lessons – that’s strange…,” Hermione said.
He had just turned around the corner of the building, when an unexpected sight stopped him in his track. Right in front of the main entrance, between the mighty pillars stood unmistakably Draco Malfoy himself, back turned toward Harry and watching the path from the gate to the house.
“Everything alright, Mr Potter?” whispered the familiar voice of the same Auror who had stopped him before.
Harry at once recognised the Fat Lady. Two of the other women were dressed in the formal robes of Hogwarts’ headmistresses. The fourth woman was sitting with her back turned towards the observers. She wore an elegant dressing gown and her chestnut hair was falling in wild curls down her neck.
“Hush, trust me, just follow my lead,” Cass said with a grin and off they went, leaving Draco and Harry behind.
“We’re not leaving, just waiting for your parents in the corridor outside,” Hermione said. “We’ll prepare them for their drama queens of kids.”
“But first I have to ask you,” McGonagall continued, “do you want to be present, when I talk to him or would you prefer to avoid this? The decision is entirely yours, of course. If you decide to stay, you’ll have to be prepared for some unpleasantness. On the other hand we cannot rule out the possibility that Mr Laddley finds it in him to regret and apologize.” She looked expectantly at them.
“Look’s like another owl bred by Malfoys,” said Cass, “you know, it was actually Draco’s idea… that I talk to you.”
“Over here, Harry!” Ginny called at him. She was sharing one old wing chair with Cass and patted at an empty chair next to theirs. Tommy and Tavin slouched on the rug in front of them.
Harry frowned and paid for his order. He even tipped the guy, who took the money with one final grunt, which might have been ‘
Apparently Harry was not the only one who had stopped listening, as Kingsley Shacklebolt and Headmistress McGonagall started a whispered conversation of their own about the necessity of prolonged Auror presence at school. As far as Harry understood, McGonagall wanted the Headauror to withdraw his team from the castle, but he flat-out refused.
“Which leaves me with Josh,” Ron said, “fair enough. I think I’ll go for chatting about old times, tell him about Charlie and such.”
A rattling sound from the window made them both turn their gaze and Harry gasped at the sight of Otto. Why was the owl back so soon?
They came to a halt in front of a wide pond. Branches of a weeping willow were touching the surface and two swans were gliding on the water. It was a sight of superb beauty and peace. Narcissa Malfoy sighed heavily before she continued her story and they strolled on.
First Josh, now Draco – he really had a knack for picking the worst possible love interests ever. At least this time nobody knew about his fancy as he had refrained from making a complete fool of himself by approaching Draco. Small mercies.
“As I said, they are extremely rare,” Hermione insisted rather defensively. “If you had ever read some of the books I recommended…”
“Why am I not even surprised you know about this?” Ron said rolling his eyes, “Though I was raised in a pure-blood family, I have never even heard about let alone played with such a thing.”
“Josh admitted, that Ms Malfoy’s hexed painting might be a bit fishy, not exactly in accordance with present law.
“And that’s the point, Harry, where you might be able to help,” Minerva McGonagall said, “because as far as we know, Albus Dumbledore has refused to sit for any other portrait apart from this one – which is gone.”
“Well, it took some time to get into the site of the Manor. The Auror Department had put special security spells onto the estate for the time of Mrs Malfoy’s absence, which needed to be removed first. When we were finally ready to enter, we split up. Josh and Mrs Malfoy went to the main building to get her settled again and Kingsley checked the park around the pavilion for evidence. He actually found the spot where Taurus Malfoy must have entered – a secret apparition point inside of a hollow tree! It will be removed soon enough but is presently still open – we used it to get back to Hogsmeade!” Hermione looked both pleased and excited. “The best apparition point I’ve ever seen – I wish they would keep it.”
“He went back to the Manor ages ago, when you were still talking to Harry,” Cass replied. “I guess he’ll be in his room. What’s the matter, Aunt Cissy?”
Precisely at two p.m. the old clock on top of the chimney’s mantel piece shrieked and announced, “Visitors ascending!” and within an instant Narcissa Malfoy, clutching a worn leather bag, stepped out of the fireplace closely followed by a young Auror. The guy looked somewhat familiar, although Harry was quite sure they had never met before. He was taller than Harry, at least six feet two, he guessed. With his short afro hairstyle and a dazzling smile on his handsome face, he was quite a looker.
“How come you are suddenly interested in pure-blood traditions?” Andromeda raised her eyebrows but did not seem to expect an answer. “Well, anyway. It’s part of matchmaking traditions. Pure-bloods have their children’s portraits taken, all the sisters together on one cup and a candlestick for each brother.”
“That won’t be necessary, Ms Malfoy,” Josh Jordan said with a frown, before he continued with a hint of amusement in his voice, “But as your future teacher I would certainly prefer to be addressed as ‘
Tumblr, reddit, livejournal, facebook, twitter, instagram... wherever you post, it's fine and I'd be grateful. Cheerio!
The other eighth-years had all retreated to their bedrooms a while ago. The sizzle of the fire, Sir Cardogan’s snores and the soft ticking of the tall clock in one corner were the only noises to be heard.
When the huge raptor touched down beside her, many students cried out – and Harry immediately remembered Draco’s horror when they had first laid eyes on the beast. Daisy was oblivious to the alarm her pet caused and climbed on his back without hesitation.
The flight had been smooth enough. At first Otto seemed a little bit distracted by the Aurors but when Harry assured his owl, that their presence was no threat to the remains of secrecy, Otto relaxed and showed no further reluctance to seek out Draco’s hiding place. Harry was amazed by his pet’s ability to understand his words – and to remember their destination.
“Harry, how would you feel about me being present when Narcissa comes?” Andromeda asked looking a bit anxious. “You see, Narcissa and I have been fire-calling regularly for about two months now without having seen each other in person. She’s not allowed to come to my house obviously and I certainly do not want to visit the Manor. But still… I would like to meet her, to get a feeling about her. It is so weird, you know, we were rather close as kids…”
Ignoring her comment Harry tried to steady his voice and to sound as reasonable as possible, “You said the culprit is supposed to be a teacher. The message of Ancient Runes, remember!”
“Just to be sure I also checked which sections of the archives they searched. Professor Jordan had a look at Magical Arms and Weapons, Professor Tharros mostly studied Rare Transfigured Objects and copied some parchments as well. Their interests were exactly what one might expect considering the subjects they teach. Neither of them went anywhere near the Magical Arts section.”
Just to make sure he said, “I’d like to stay very much! Because… because I’ve never been to Edinburgh before… we could go to the city center and you could show me around a bit?”
“That is very observant of you, Floppy,” Harry felt the need to compliment this desperate being in front of him, when suddenly an idea hit him. “Do you like to look at pictures, Floppy?”
So far he had been able to push those feelings aside. Mostly. With the exception of some heated phantasies under the shower. But that was private, right? Draco just was a very handsome bastard, perfectly normal for a gay teenager to be turned on by his looks. Didn’t mean a thing. Certainly no reason to actually fall for someone.
They were well aware that Hermione Granger’s preferred remedy for unwelcome feelings was a book– or preferably a ton of books. Harry might find relief on a broom, Ron might get it from a hearty meal. Hermione’s favourite escapism was reading.
Harry was shocked. As much as he himself had suffered at the Dursleys’, at least he had been loved and cherished for the first fifteen months of his life. Also the knowledge, that those awful relatives, who raised him, were not his real parents, had made his pain somewhat more bearable. He could well remember daydreaming about being rescued by his real parents, who in his phantasies had miraculously survived the ominous car crash– and in a way they actually
“Of course I do, love,” was the answer, “David has been talking his head off about you ever since we have known him.”
“Who knows? I am most certainly no expert for criminal minds. Taurus Malfoy might take a flight abroad, this time for real. That would be the clever thing to do. Or he might be angry enough to do something stupid. Assuming he’s the one who attacked Professor Laddley – whether he wanted to get rid of an accomplice or for another reason – well, in that case he has crossed the line from malicious arts to real violence and he might attack again. I suppose you are concerned for Draco Malfoy’s safety, Mr Potter? Well, I’m afraid rightly so … he might be in danger, wherever he is hiding.”
His neighbour was Tommy, the handsome sixth-year with the ginger boyfriend. Harry had spotted them together several times since he had seen them dancing and realized they must be a couple, and a pretty cute one as well. Tommy was far better looking than the chubby redhead, but seemed to adore his lover all the more. When walking together they held hands and seemed totally confident with each other. Harry secretly admired them.
Harry found out, if he kept calm and didn’t allow himself to be irritated by Draco’s tension, the guy relaxed. Maybe Draco’s mood depended too much on others?
Eric was one of those guys, who had given Harry meaningful looks in the course of the day. Come to think of it - just like some runners from Josh’s class, mostly those who had now turned up at the pool.
“Seriously, Ron!” Hermione frowned. “But yes, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore’s Imagic should be back in his frame any minute now. Professor Flitwick took the cup to McGonagall’s office to break the hex.”
Suddenly Polly jumped to the ground from Snape’s shoulder and went off between the trees. With one surprisingly deep bark Mephisto started to chase her. Harry was slightly worried for Polly’s sake but before he had a chance to say something about it, the squirrel ran up a trunk and eyed the poodle from above. Mephisto winced excitedly and wagged his tail until Polly leaped right onto his back. Soon enough they were rolling around in a ball of fur obviously having a lot of fun. In spite of the latest news Harry could not help smiling and so did Snape’s Imagic.
Daisy nodded eagerly and said, “Of course, Draco,” she opened her book and gave the bird a final pat to the head, “Hush, up the tree you go again, Pinkie!”
“Because they don’t possess any painting that might tempt her to leave the portrait and they certainly did not have her trust,” Narcissa said. “Malfoy Manor, on the other hand, holds quite a few nasty portraits and I have found my way to deal with them.” She looked fierce. “When Draco was just three years old and having nightmares about his great-uncle Eridanus hunting him down, because Eridanus’ portrait was abusing and threatening him every day, I knew I had to do something. So I got this hexed painting and locked all the nasty relatives up.”
“Yes, you did. Sunday morning, at the common room… when Blaise suggested to… you know… to hook up with me.“ Harry gulped.
“I have some… Muggle contacts. Friends nobody knows about. I’m pretty sure… they’ll manage to hide me for some time.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “Excuse me? You refused to recount what you know about Laddley in the first place! And now you expect me to explain what has happened? Forget it, it’s confidential… as I’ve told you already, Laddley wasn’t going after me – I’m merely helping Tommy.”
This chapter includes a tale of past abuse and sexual violence. Stuff like that should not happen, but sadly enough it does.
Suddenly Harry’s stomach clenched. “Professor,” he said, “if Taurus Malfoy finds out that his attempt to frame Draco has failed and we are now on his tail – what’s he going to do then?“
“Molly, Arthur – so good to see you!” Flitwick blinked rapidly. “Yes, I’m afraid so, the Headmistress has urgent business to attaned to, no delay possible. So good to see you!” he repeated.
“… and I think I’ll manage to get those records even although I’m suspended. I’ve got my connections, you know,” Josh grinned. “As soon as I’m in London I’ll try to get my hands on the list of Draco’s alarms and send it to you. Maybe this will help.”
Suddenly someone tapped at Harry’s shoulder. When he turned around he saw Christie, the tiny girl from the swim team.
Harry, Ron and Hermione had of course missed last year completely as had many other students, such as Muggle-borns or kids from families who resisted Voldemort’s regime. Last year had been all about improving survival skills for them – which were very important skills indeed, but not enough in terms of a proper magical education.
In the early hours he had fallen asleep full of hope, even the Fat Lady’s disappearance did not spoil his good mood. Harry knew exactly, why he was feeling so joyful – Draco’s outing made all the difference to him and had raised his spirits immensely.
“G’morng,” Ron yawned behind her. He was bare-chested and wore the maroon pants to go with the shirt.
Hermione and Ron were waiting for him as usual and Draco also seemed reluctant to leave before Harry did.
“I’ll take him to the owlery, Harry, make sure he settles in nicely,” Hagrid said eagerly before babbling to the bird, “No need to be afraid, Ottie, Uncle Hagrid will protect you!”
Harry smiled. Andromeda’s affection for Teddy seemed to be her lifeline these days. And he could understand that very well.
“I’m afraid our victims of crime will need some rest before we can interview them properly,” Flitwick said.
“Right… if I manage to get there at all, that is. Most likely someone will spot me before I reach that corridor and report me to the Aurors.”
No, he didn’t. Instead the slender stag made a surprisingly elegant little jump, turned around and ran off. Harry’s stag followed in an instant. And now the silvery animals played with each other, chasing and dancing around each other in wonderful harmony.
“But how could I ever come to Malfoy Manor? I am quite certain there is no portrait of mine in the Manor and I cannot move to just any other painting in another building. You must be aware that we are only able to visit portraits of our own or paintings within the same vicinity.” Walburga was clearly considering the idea.
“I had remained at Hogwarts, because my portrait was still a draft, Professor Flitwick had not managed to finish before my death,” Severus Snape’s portrait continued, ”when the other portraits returned, it was plain as a pikestaff to me that Albus Dumbledore’s portrait was a fake. The seemingly sleeping Dumbledore was no Imagic, but just… just paint. So I alerted the Headmistress.” Snape gave Minerva McGonagall a courteous nod.
She stood up, walked towards the painting of Bellevue Beach and quietly talked to her predecessors. Soon enough the two Imagics stepped out of the frame.
“Well, if you ask me, it looks very much like Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy, wearing pyjamas and drinking tea,” said Professor Flitwick, “I want to compliment you on this very accurate drawing, Miss Daisy! You might like to use some water colours, perhaps, to flesh it out?”
“Fine.” Turning to the room at large she added, “Mr Potter will be even more eager to return, if he can eat his supper in peace tonight!” Immediately the students backed away from their table and some even retreated upstairs.
“Yes of course, Minerva,” Madam Pince said eagerly, “well, I suggest we pay her Ladyship a visit as soon as you have finished eating, Miss Granger? Take your time, no need to hurry. I will then explain everything to you, my dear, everything you want to know about her Ladyship… oh, I am so delighted that this is happening while I am still in service!” Madam Pince seemed overwhelmed by her feelings.
They reached the eighth-year’s table and all conversation stopped abruptly. Harry had the distinct feeling, he knew what his table mates had been talking about, but still felt less awkward about it than he had expected to.
, can you believe it? Made me wear peach robes for her wedding!” Josh shook his head with something in between a laugh and a sob.
“Not as good as Tommy,” Harry could not help saying. He wanted to see the swimming instructor’s reaction, when his least favourite student was mentioned. But Laddley just lowered his eyes to the floor and kept quiet.
Flitwick nodded and McGonagall explained, “We are going to my living room, Mr Potter, because we want to have a look at the crime-scene of Bellevue Beach. Professor Snape– sorry, his Imagic is waiting for us at the Beach already.”
“I’m not gay,” Harry took a breath and continued, pre-empting Draco’s protest, “I’m bisexual. I’m attracted to both men and women, I just never told Gin that. It was easier, you know and besides, I never thought it’d be an issue. We were supposed to always be together.”
Climbing up the stairs to the seventh year dormitories, Harry was greeted at the door by Kreacher, who besides looking tired, was standing proud, holding a plate of sandwiches and treacle tarts in one hand and a goblet of pumpkin juice in the other.
, you know? About magic, I mean. They don’t even know it exists. So I don’t have any magical friends; I left everyone up in Scotland, and suddenly I’m supposed to be a Muggle down here. I’m
By mutual agreement, they lazily competed for the Snitch a couple of times – winning one apiece – until Harry found his eyes beginning to ache as they strained against the dying light. He paused, and Malfoy drew alongside him, producing a teacake from goodness-knows-where. He balled up the shiny wrapper, tossing it in the air and Vanishing it with a flourish which had Harry rolling his eyes fondly, and they shared it in silence while around them the sky deepened to a soft velvet, slowly swallowing up the black shadow of the woods. As the last few rays of sunlight disappeared over the horizon, a whole host of glowing orbs appeared on the grass below, rising up and illuminating the pitch. The effect was charming, but fairly pointless: the light was barely sufficient for the Chasers’ half-hearted play, and certainly nowhere near enough for Harry and Malfoy to continue pursuing the Snitch – so, by shared consensus, they stopped.
“Don’t be silly Ron, there is no such thing as conversion, when it comes to sexual orientation.” Hermione said.
“Three Imagics gone, that’s a serious weakening of our security system,” Snape’s nasal voice said suddenly and Harry had never been more relieved to hear it. He wondered how long Snape had been back in his frame listening in? Snape had always favoured Draco.
She cleared her voice, “Considering all the facts, I’m afraid we have to treat Draco Malfoy as a suspect.”
Draco suddenly looked deflated and alarmed at the same time. He took a step back and slipped into his robes. “Yeah, that’s one way of putting it. Or one could simply say he’s a homophobic arse. What did he do to you?”
Harry groaned and gave up. Most likely he would do what he always did when totally clueless – wait for the right moment and act on an impulse. That strategy had served him quite well so far, considering he was still alive. What he needed right now was a really long hot shower… with some sandalwood shower gel.
Harry snatched his arm away, voice sharp and unkind. “That was a mistake, okay? You don’t have a monopoly on bad decisions, Draco. I was relieved to see you looking better. That’s all that was. That’s all it
Harry’s laughter, full-bodied and affectionate, echoed down the street, and Draco’s heart soared. Walking beside Harry again, able to speak freely, frankly, about their shared past – Draco thought he’d never felt so content.
, of giddy confidence and crippling anxiety. Draco hardly recalled Potter’s casual offer to Owl Charlie Weasley. His store of dragon liver was getting dangerously low, but it didn’t seem to matter.
The two of them watched in silence, pressed into a corner, as Malfoy continued to dance his macabre jig around the room. Several times he spun into the walls, bouncing off the shimmering cushioning charms with a chuckle. Occasionally he mumbled under his breath.
As expected, Thomas cut in. “Malfoy. It’s been what, nearly four years now? You’ve served your time, haven’t you? I think we should let bygones be bygones. Even Ron seems to have forgiven you – no idea how you managed that one, by the way – but if you have changed, I don’t see why you shouldn’t deserve a fresh start. I mean, it’s not exactly your fault that your family were… well, you know.”
“There’s no department in the Ministry responsible for Wizarding-Adjacents,” Potter explained. “Hermione’s been working on a bill which would require formal registration of their births, improving representation, helping those who want to work in the wizarding world find appropriate jobs, that sort of thing. I know she’s been looking for representatives; this would be right up her street. And it sounds as though Lee would have plenty to say.”
The noises Harry was making went straight to Draco’s own cock. Harry’s hand tightened on his shoulder as Draco sank down, taking Harry in further, until Draco’s mouth met the curl of his fist at the base of the shaft. He dragged his tongue back up to the head, memorising the feel of Harry’s cock – its length, girth, slight curve to the left – earning himself a small whimper of frustration from Harry. Draco took pity on him, lowering his head back down and setting a steady rhythm, sucking hard as he pulled back, his fist tight around the base.
For a split second, Draco wondered how on earth he was going to answer, but before he could even begin to formulate an appropriate response, he found himself speaking.
Draco got to his feet, rotating his aching shoulders with a sigh. He was exhausted and quite overwhelmed by the events of the day – not to mention more than a little heart-sick to have missed Harry. The room was still uncomfortably busy, so he headed off towards the door, where he found, to his irritation, that an enormous mound of coats had accumulated on top of his cloak. As he began half-heartedly sorting through it, an arm reached close around him. He stepped back, startled. Before he could turn around, a low voice murmured next to his ear.
“And on a day like today. You must really be a dedicated Cannons fan,” said Harry, mouth twitching. He still wasn’t looking at Draco.
The words tumbled out, clumsily, tripping off Draco’s tongue as though he’d taken the Veritaserum after all. It was almost a relief to finally voice his biggest secret after so long, and while part of him wondered if Harry would be putting the memory of his admission straight into a Pensieve, he mostly found it hard to care. Draco still didn’t have a clear plan for what he’d do after Harry left, but it certainly wouldn’t involve sticking around to wait for a bunch of Aurors to show up.
be ‘very pleased’ to receive Neville Longbottom as a guest at the Manor? It certainly wasn’t a possibility he’d ever entertained before. But if
Draco began to reconsider his recent interactions with Harry – could he somehow have misread Harry’s intentions? Was he going to stand out here by himself all evening… or something even worse? Draco shivered, his mind conjuring up nightmare scenarios where old schoolmates took great pleasure in telling him that he’d been the victim of an elaborate prank.
Pansy rubbed her hands together. “All right then. Now, I might have an in. Michel does some consulting work for the Quidditch League, including Potter’s beloved shitshow, the Chudley Cannons. He
“I hope it’s okay, Draco,” Neville cut in. “I met Harry for lunch, and when I mentioned I might pop by, he asked if he could come along. You don’t mind, do you?”
, you know. Being all noble and looking for a cause and…” He caught sight of Hannah’s pitying face. “Oh. Oh
Draco rolled the vial between his fingers, considering. He only needed enough to last a couple of hours. Just enough to help him feel
Ignoring the butterflies in his stomach, he picked up his first ingredient – a scarlet Ashwinder egg – and got to work.
“If it helps, Potter, I like the tattoo,” said Malfoy, the very moment they’d resumed their previous position.
“I just wondered if you wanted to grab lunch any time soon. That new café’s just opened up on the high street. I thought we might –” Harry trails off as Draco smiles at him indulgently, tugging him down and dropping a kiss onto the side of his mouth.
, there were men. Muggle men, lots of them, and I―” He paused, the very words so repulsive that his breath caught in his throat as he struggled to force them out. “Well, how can I ever know if they really wanted me – it – or not?  It makes me sick to think of it, Harry. I can’t remember most of them, even now. I suppose it’s like Lee said, I can’t bear to try. So if anyone should be ashamed – if anyone took advantage – it was me.”
“…we’ve had to stick to short-lasting Muggle sedative medicine and Nev’s herbs so far; we’re trying to stay away from potions as much as we can. Means this bit will be harder for you, but this way we avoid any unforeseen interactions, or creating different dependencies, which…” She fell silent, turning away as the bathroom door opened.
“Well,” said Harry, thinking, “I should probably be back for Neville and Hannah’s engagement party. I’m assuming you’ll be there.”
“Draco,” interrupted Lee, “as much as I hate to get in the way of this clearly overdue emotional reunion, it’s five o’clock. Do you want to go through the orders for next week, or…?”
“It’s irreversible,” whispered Malfoy, mouth awfully close, sharp gaze on Harry’s face. When he tried to return it, his eyes fell instead on Malfoy’s lips: bitten raw but appealing, nonetheless.
to know that it wasn’t going to be a pleasant experience. He also knew that painkillers were out of the question – they wouldn’t help, and they might even counteract the potion’s effects. In lieu of other analgesic options, he Summoned the bottle of Ogden’s from his bedside table, took a few good swigs, then laid on his back, letting the cold tiles underneath him soothe his aching head.
The second owl which arrived was from Pansy. She’d been his closest friend at school, and despite the recent silence he had half expected to hear from her ever since his house arrest ended. This, however, did nothing to ameliorate the swooping sense of dread he felt as he opened the missive.
-inspired confidence, his mind gone fuzzy with pleasure, his heart full of the heady excitement of finally being offered everything he’d wanted. He was more aroused than he’d ever been in his life, finally free of his own insecurities, free to just give and
Muggles wouldn’t…” Harry started, feeling strangely defensive. His voice was barely a whisper into Draco’s ear, as if the kissing couple didn’t have more pressing things to think about than disembodied voices next to them.
“Because, Harry, Merlin forbid our new neighbours see a pile of shrunken luggage and a fucking great eagle owl sitting by the door. I’ll be carted off to Azkaban for breaking the Statute before we’ve even had a chance to try out that fancy new mattress of yours.”
great to see you! God, it’s been ages. Draco this is Ro, we knew each other up in the Highlands. Ro was practically the
Suddenly, Draco was right back there, in his lab. Beside him, Leonie was measuring out the potion into jars for him to cool, while Harry, fists clenched by his sides, paced back and forth in front of them. Waves of distress rolled off him as he spoke.
“Lee?” Draco stretched his arm out towards her as she moved back towards the lab. She pushed it away, furious. “Lee, come on. Look at me.”
“You were saying you needed a dragon keeper? Charlie Weasley works at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary – have you contacted him?”
, Draco finally sat down to compose the rest of his apology letters. He wrote to everyone he could ever remember offending, and several he’d previously forgotten. Letting the
, able for once to say the first thing which came into his head without the potion smoothing out all his jagged edges.
Owl Orders from customers had dropped off, too. Some of Draco’s patrons had written to complain that they were missing items, or their potions hadn’t acted as promised; a few were even incensed enough to take their business elsewhere. The first week brought three more Howlers, so familiar from those early days at the Manor, as though the public had just now remembered Draco’s role in the war. Dealing with the blasted things was second nature for Draco by now, but delivery of each red envelope put Lee back into such a foul mood that his heart sank every time an owl arrived.
So eager was Draco to report all his news, it was almost half an hour before he realised that Neville was looking both distracted and decidedly worse for wear.
“The pleasure was all mine,” he lied, relieved, and one final sticky, too-tight handshake later, Lila left. With a sigh of relief, Draco cast a long-overdue
This morning, he’d been alone. This morning, for the first time in two decades your eyes had met, gazes held for one single, agonising second. This morning, ignoring the calls of your son, you’d turned on your heel and left.
“You… you look much better now. Hannah says you’ve made amazing progress this past week. She told me your speech is almost back to normal.”
The excited anticipation with which he used to await his Sunday Quidditch matches was also fading fast. He still loved flying, of course, but with
His mother took a delicate sip of her wine, swallowing carefully. “You know, darling, it’s funny, really. My – the wizard I mentioned, the one I’ve been corresponding with?”
After a careful afternoon’s thought, Draco concocted a plan. He would enrol in a distance learning Advanced Potions Diploma. He’d considered it before, but quickly dismissed it as inferior to an apprenticeship and (since they were usually run from abroad) often sneered at by the more traditional British potioneers. It should provide a cover for his use of the lab, and, he supposed, help occupy his mind while the
Barely a few minutes later, another burst of music and laughter spilled out from the ballroom, lasting a few seconds before fading slowly to a background murmur. Footsteps sounded on the polished floor, moving ever closer.
To Draco’s knowledge, Harry hadn’t visited since that one horrendous night. Sometimes, in those moments where Draco’s mind hovered somewhere between asleep and awake, he thought he could hear Harry’s voice – but by the time he opened his eyes, he was alone. And that was what caused Draco the most pain – he’d lost all the memories of his time with Harry, and he knew that they might never get the opportunity to start afresh.
“I want to move,” she said, quickly, words spilling from her Merlot-stained lips. “I need to move, really. Away from this house.”
As afternoon faded into evening though, Draco had to sadly concede that – ridiculous fake dates aside – Neville had been right. In a lot of the memories he’d accessed, Harry had seemed troubled, even downright miserable, with Draco and Lee doing their level best to help cheer him up.
He turned to Harry and his friends. “I have to brief Professor Weasley now, so I must ask you to leave. Looks like we can’t do much about our… our problem anyway at the moment.“
Hermione pulled a face, she was obviously not too pleased by the prospect of parting with the book but Harry left anyway.
Draco shook his head. “No. I think it’s time to do something I’ve been pondering all summer.” He withdrew his hand from Harry’s and gulped. “I’ll go Muggle.”
Harry spotted Tommy and Tevin, who were also wearing matching outfits – their bright pink tails clashed charmingly with Tevin’s ginger hair. They approached the other couple.
Draco sighed and closed his book. “Oh well, Cassy, if you want to dance, I must play,” he said and approached the upright piano.
“Have a look at the place mats – you have to find one with your name on it, that’s where you are meant to sit.” Luna explained. “Oh, yours is right next to mine, Ronald – and what a lovely pattern you’ve got!”
“Thank you. Please be seated.” McGonagall’s voice drew Harry back to the present. When he opened his eyes again, he found Draco Malfoy looking right at him… with a rather strange expression on his face. Could it be… compassion? They locked eyes for a moment, before Draco flushed in his usual way and dropped his gaze. Why was Malfoy staring at him? Slightly irritated Harry decided to focus on the staff table instead.
“Good morning, students! May I have your attention please!” shouted the familiar voice of Headmistress McGonagall from the staff table. “Before I have the pleasure of introducing our new members of staff, I want to address the latest addition to the Hogwarts curriculum. As you all will be aware, each and every student is asked to exercise twice a week from now on.”
“He said, you seem to be interested in Magical Arts lately and it might be useful for you to know a bit about famous artists and collections.” Cass gave Harry a questioning look, who just stared at her. How come Draco knew about his interest? Harry was quite surprised as he had never told Draco anything about the Imagic issue.
“Mrs Malfoy!” Harry gasped and asked Laddley, “Does she know? What her husband did to your brother?”
“Perfect,” said Draco putting down his mug to count off his fingers, “One – he’s famous and a Quidditch player. Two – I’ve already collected a chocolate-frog card with his image. Three – if there is not yet a Muggle film about his life, it is only a question of time.”
Finally they reached their destination and Harry had to admit the tea house was rather charming. Ginny obviously felt the same.
Blaise winked at Draco, pointed his wand, boomed the spell – and Draco’s shirt turned a vivid pink. “Sorry, mate!” Blaise grinned, “couldn’t resist!”
“Yes, exactly. The Imagics protected the office. They work like… like cranial bones protecting the brain. We store our most valuable and rare objects in this office –the sword of Gryffindor, the Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and many other unique items– because they are safe there. And of course the Headmaster or Headmistress is protected as well.”
Still shivering with the aftermath of pain, Harry managed to sneer. “At least I don’t pretend! You passed the trap-painting hex off as your own invention when in fact you just picked it up from an old book! You’re such a braggart!”
“Yes, indeed. And what are you going to do about it, little lady? Teach me some manners?” Taurus Malfoy smirked at the Imagics.
“Looking forward to escaping my control, I presume?” she asked with a smile. “I still advice strongly to take it easy, Mr Potter, or you’ll be back here in a jiffy! And we both don’t want that, do we?”
They looked intently at each other and just when Harry was about to move closer, Draco turned away and said, “I never expected… I don’t know, Harry… I need some time to think about it.”
“Cassy my dear, welcome home in the wizarding world, where you truly belong,” said McGonagall and her softness astonished Harry nearly as much as Malfoy’s. She gave Draco a rather friendly nod, before she addressed the others.
Ron slapped Harry’s shoulder. “Thanks for backing me up – that’s my mate! As Harry has been clueless too, I’m at least not the only door knob at this table! And if you all claim to be emotionally advanced, you’ll have to be more considerate with us door knobs and tell us what’s going on in plain English now and then.”
“Good to know,” Harry murmured before he dived into another deep kiss. Exploring Draco’s mouth with his tongue seemed like a necessity. This was good. This was it. This was not nearly enough.
At least he knew for sure Josh was single, as he had mentioned that fact at one point, chatting away while having tea with Andromeda and Ms Malfoy at Harry’s place. It had seemed a bit out of context at that moment – maybe that was a good sign? Only one way to find out, Harry thought and sighed. He needed to do something about his crush on Josh Jordan. He could behave like a true Gryffindor and simply ask Josh out for a date – the thought alone made his stomach drop. Or he could act out his Slytherin tendencies by making secret enquires on Josh’s whereabouts to arrange a ‘coincidental’ meeting. What would a Ravenclaw do? Collect as much information as possible about the man of his dreams to make sure, he was worth it before getting close? Well, he was not patient enough for that approach. And a Hufflepuff like Josh himself? Get down on one knee, declare never ending love and propose?
It was highly entertaining to watch boy and bird getting acquainted. Teddy – who had just started crawling – being the more daring one, approached Otto. The owl retreated to Harry’s shoulder whenever Teddy got close enough to touch him. As soon as Otto was out of reach, Teddy protested and crawled back to Andromeda’s knees, which made the owl eventually flutter back to the carpet – and the whole thing started all over again. Harry and Andromeda laughed a lot.
“You can keep it, if you wish! I don’t want it, and neither does Andromeda. It was her idea, that I give it to you,” Harry said.
“Oh,” she blushed, “that is very good. I mean, that he told you about his relationship with his father. If Draco has been talking to you about… about his feelings, that is… you are…” she broke off.
“No! I mean – yes!” Harry beamed, “I’ll totally be your date for tonight – I’ll pick you up at quarter to five, ok?”
“Well, thank you Harry, we’ll keep that in mind when questioning Professor Laddley,” the Headmistress nodded, still looking doubtful. “If you are right, their conflict must have occurred after they finished school… as far as I know those two were never close, but I can’t remember any significant tension either. You were younger than them, Severus, but also in Slytherin – did you hear any rumours about a previous conflict?”
Surprisingly enough Hermione did not protest about Ron’s harsh verdict on the book-shop. In fact she looked a bit embarrassed and did not invite Harry to join them either.
"He's rather serious... that’s quite disturbing in itself, come to think of it. Never expected one day I would actually miss being teased and mucked about. He’s busy with the shop, mind you, now he has to get it all done by himself. That’s probably why he hasn’t been visiting you lately… give him a fire-call, will you? I think it would do him good to meet that one, a kindred spirit of sorts,” Ron said pointing at Otto.
“I’m afraid I have to insist, Mr Malfoy. This is a matter of safety, I have to make sure every eighth-year is able to master the Patronus spell,” he said with finality and beckoned to Draco.
He was saved by a little bell flying in circles above all the tables ringing brightly. This was Deputy Headmaster Flitwick’s charming way of getting everyone’s attention.
“Is he drunk?” Ron looked puzzled by Flitwick’s enthusiasm, “I guess he is! I mean, talking about threesomes? That’s…”
“It’s good to have a bit of blokes-only time,” Ron slapped Harry’s back as they walked along, “don’t you think? Mind you, I can’t get enough of Hermione, now that we are finally together… I find it still hard to believe that she’s settled for me, you know – but yet… it won’t hurt her, when we spend some time apart. Maybe she’s even glad not to see my stupid face all the time?” Ron grinned but Harry could hear a touch of insecurity in his voice. He was painfully aware of his best friend’s lack in self-confidence.
“Brilliant!” Ron shouted, “it’s a shame Hermione won’t be able to come with us, but no way will she manage to fly long distance.”
Neville suddenly said, “King of Hearts!” He picked up some extra cards and concentrated hard on his hand. “What to keep, what to dispose…” he murmured.
“Hi Harry,” Josh said keeping his focus on a sizzling pan, which was all for the better as Harry had flushed violently.
When Harry and Ron touched down near Hogwarts’ guest house half an hour later, they were surprised to find Josh Jordan waiting near the main door, dressed in jeans and a leather jacket. Harry realized he had only ever seen Josh wearing robes, either the formal robes of a Hogwarts professor or brown Aurors’ robes. Josh looked much younger and far more attractive in his present outfit.
“That, Mr Weasley, is totally beside the point,” McGonagall raised her eye-brows. “The important question is, why are Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight playing cards with the Fat Lady and an unknown… lady of sorts? Instead of trying to get out of this… this tawdry room?”
Being at Hogwarts for an extracurricular eighth year had many advantages, Harry’s cohort agreed. They not only enjoyed private bedrooms and a common room of their own, but were also delighted to learn that they were free to go to Hogsmeade any weekend they wanted to. As they had arrived on a Thursday, Harry and his friends decided to take the first chance for a visit.
“I know, Harry,” McGonagall looked as unhappy as Harry felt, “I have to repeat myself – I most certainly do not want to believe this, but common sense tells me, we cannot rule it out. Especially if we think there is more than one person involved.”
Of course they had discussed other options as well, like Tommy offering to recount his previous experience under the influence of Veritaserum. But the use of this potion was restricted to Ministry enquiries only and if the Ministry officials were informed, the whole matter would blow up, which Tommy preferred to avoid. Harry had reasons of his own, why he didn’t want the Ministry involved, as he feared for the Imagic enquiry’s confidentiality.
“Good afternoon Headmistress, Professor Flitwick, Auror Shacklebolt and Mr Potter, good to see you again,” Snape’s Imagic seemed in a rather good mood and smiled at the humans, who returned his greetings.
“Why does the music have to stop? Just because Gryffindors can’t control their porter – that’s got to be a joke!” one fourth-year Slytherin complained loudest.
“Anyway – I’m glad you made a new friend, Daisy!” he nodded at Ariana. “Must be nice to spend some time with a girl of your own age for a change.”
Some twenty minutes later Harry had finished his tea and dawn rose above the treetops of the forbidden forest. Harry sighed, turned to Draco and said, “Looks like it’s going to be a fine day. Well… see you later, I guess…”
Aberforth looked thoroughly perplexed. “Well, that’s an interesting question! All the more as this was one of the very few occasions during our childhood, when Albus was the one to give our parents trouble and not me. He completely refused to have the damn stick painted, can you believe it! I sat for mine but Albus was stubborn, very unlike his usual good behaviour.”
Draco snorted and finally turned around for a moment, “Perfect motto, Luna, for my intended costume at least.” He grinned at Harry, who mouthed silently '
Anyway– he didn’t have time to follow this line of thought, as all of his friends wanted to know everything about Hermione’s special relationship with the library. He had to repeat again and again that, just like them, he had no clue how that worked.
Silence filled the room once more. Pulling his eyes away from Draco's stare, Harry looked out the window, over the fields and ponds that were visible. Just as Draco was about to start speaking again, to tell Harry that he did not have to take on this responsibility, Harry answered.
Draco was lost in his own thoughts and he didn't notice Luna Lovegood walk up and sit down next to him.
Harry exhaled shakily, clearly not convinced, “I don’t know Malfoy. I mean, I fucked up bad and she didn’t want to be with somebody like me. She deserves to be with someone who knows what they want. Not a fuck up. That’s what Ron said when he found out. He said I was confused, and that if I sorted myself out, maybe in a couple years she might give me another chance and that Ginny did the right thing by leaving cause I didn’t deserve her.” Harry’s breathing was coming in heavy pants now and he looked at Draco, eyes bright and a little unfocused.
"I cannot let you— no, I will not let you come Harry. The wizarding community needs you here. You represent their safety, and they're counting on you to help repair the damages from the war. You can't leave them all; it wouldn't be fair. Besides, you have Ginevra, and others friends and family who would miss you. Taking you away would be selfish of me. I have to face this alone; I have to prove that I'm not a coward, that I can take a stand." Draco stopped for the briefest of moments as he walked forward and placed his hands on Harry's shoulders, "Promise me Harry. Promise me you'll be okay after I go, promise me you'll finish your training, promise me you'll be happy, that you'll laugh again, and love again. Please, just promise."
“Of course she wouldn’t care. The Golden Boy would never do anything to damage his golden life, isn’t that right Potter? Especially something as scandalous as getting caught in a gay tryst.” Only years of practice hid the wistfulness and tinge of bitterness in Draco’s voice.
Harry saw red—cheating, in his book, could never be considered harmless fun. Turning around, he strode purposefully back to where the man was still kneeling on the ground, looking pathetic. "First, and let's get this straight—cheating in no way is harmless or fun. I have half a mind to contact this spouse of yours and tell him what an absolute asshole you are to take something like this so lightly. Second, I am not, will never be, and never was your baby, and if you call me babe on more time, I swear to god I will make you pay dearly for it. And third—stay the hell away from me, Neville, and all of my friends."
Draco shivered again as Harry bit down on his earlobe, causing Draco to push into Harry even more. Harry gasped as he felt Draco's growing erection press against his own through far too many layers of clothing.
“I was tricked.” Draco bit back, “I’m sorry you’re hurt but I can’t apologize for something that wasn’t my bloody fault, not that you waited around to ask me about it. No, you were pretty quick to believe Weasley and Granger on this one, weren’t you?”
Draco acknowledged the elf with a smile, “Good morning Tilley. Would you be able to bring some breakfast here? It does not need to be a full breakfast, just a few things will do.”
Draco nodded, and Harry let out a breath before moving slowing, careful of where he put his other hand.
“I love you too. And you’re right—you deserve more loyalty from me.” Draco shrugged and ran a hand through his hair, “I guess I’ll be going now. See you around Harry.” Turning, Draco made his way to the door.
"He might." Hermione moved to sit next to Harry. "He misses you Harry—it was pretty obvious while I was talking to him. He might have gone home with that man tonight hoping to escape for bit." Reaching out to take Harry's hand, she added "You should talk to him."
Miguel, once again misinterpreting Harry's reaction, purred in Harry's ear "Ticklish, eh Harry?" and promptly went back to sucking Harry's neck. Harry, on his part, just made a non-committal grunt, not really sure what else to do or say. He hadn't been so close to another man since his breakup with Draco, and it was seriously throwing him for a loop—it felt so wrong, like he was betraying Draco, but it felt so good at the same time. Just as Harry was getting ready to push the man away for some space, Miguel found his weakness—the soft spot behind his ear—and began sucking on the place with such fervor that all thoughts were pushed from Harry's brain, and his mind and body focused solely on the present.
"But, I thought…but, he was…" Harry did know what he was trying to say—there were so many thoughts swirling around his head he couldn't keep them straight. Finally he blurted out "But Draco doesn't have one night stands. Ever."
“Hey Draco, I have a question” he didn’t wait for a response, “did you get to skip the lesson on the stupefy charm since you’re such a natural stunner?”
The trio kept walking until they were back at the entrance to the Great Hall; Ron and Hermione kept walking but Harry stopped, not sure he was ready to face the crowds again. Instead he told his two best friends that he was going up to Gryffindor Tower. They just nodded, understanding his need to be alone.
Reaching to grasp the gate latch, Draco concentrated on the first word Hermione had given him and when the metal warmed under his hand, he pushed his way through the gate, repeating the process again at the front door.
Draco was bored, and he knew he was doing a poor job at hiding it. He dutifully twirled his dance partner one more time and quickly detached himself as soon as the song came to its drawn-out conclusion. Giving his partner a small bow, Draco hurried away before she could catch his eye or hand to engage him in another long and tedious waltz. It wasn’t that Draco minded dancing, it was actually preferable to the alternative of making small talk with the other attendees at the benefit, but that woman had the same level of personality as wet paint.
Leaning over, Draco placed slow, easy kisses the shell of Harry’s ear. And just as he reached Harry’s jaw, he noticed eye lids beginning to flutter open. Moving away a bit, Draco watched as Harry rolled onto his back, staring blearily up at him.
The two lay like that for a while and as Harry's breath slowed and deepened, Draco thought that Harry had fallen asleep. Muttering a cleaning spell, Draco moved so that he could look down at Harry's face.
“You’re right. I would hate to have to arrest you for loitering and public indecency at the same time.” Harry took a step backward, “If you have no other business here, you’d best be on your way Mr. Malfoy.”
Thirty minute later, he was still waiting. H wasn’t worried, just disappointed that Harry wasn’t apparently able to sneak out early on this Friday afternoon as he’d done so many times in the past. He wanted Harry. He wanted to be wrapped in his strong arms and held, to be told everything would be okay.
Draco looked up, caught the absolute sincerity on Harry’s face and burst out laughing, “Trying to chat me up Potter?”
“Still observant as ever Potter.” Draco’s smile morphed into another smirk and Harry once again resumed his pacing. “So,” Draco continued, “if not by your side, where is the Weaslette?”
Opening the window just enough to let a large eagle owl in, Harry immediately noticed that the letter it was carrying in his beak wasn't from the Ministry nor from Ron and Hermione, as they were usually Harry's only sources of mail. Intrigued, Harry took the envelope while absentmindedly giving the owl a few treats from the jar he kept on his dresser. The envelope, however, held no clues as to who sent the letter, and Harry wracked his brains trying to figure out who else would send him mail as he walked back to his bed.
"What do you mean 'be careful'?" Harry's tone of voice implying that he was an Auror, he could take care of himself.
"Not bloody likely Malfoy." Harry growled in a way that sent shivers down Draco's spine and straight to his groin, hardening his already slightly hard member even more. Harry continued in a low tone, "If you're going to give me a kiss like that, you better be prepared to back it up with something."
Harry chucked as Draco dropped his suit jacket to the floor and pushed Harry roughly onto the bed. "Impatient, aren't we?" Harry only managed to gasp out as Draco positioned himself on top of Harry, causing their now full blown erections to rub against each other.
Draco closed his eyes again and moaned, accepting that he was definitely not making it to breakfast on time.
"Actually Harry, I was going to come and talk to you about him. It's obvious that you are getting along well, but just be careful where Miguel is concerned."
Draco smiled as he felt strong arms reach around his waist and a head come to rest on his shoulder. He felt shivers run down his spine as a voice whispered in his ear.
Miguel chucked, "I actually split my time between Brazil and Portugal for work purposes. My mother lives here in London, so whenever I come to Europe, she insists I come and visit. I could never do research here—far too cold or rainy for my taste."
Four days after Draco's death, Harry stood in the same bedroom in which Draco had died. He looked in the mirror, straightening his tie and flattening his hair before he turned and walked out of the room. Meeting Ron and Hermione in the entrance hall, Harry took Scorpius from Hermione and the three friends headed towards the large willow tree that over looked the pond on the estate. This was where Draco was to be buried shortly and tomorrow, Harry would be moving into the house so that Scorpius could grow up in a place that his father had loved.
"It's nothing Ron," Harry sighed, "let's go back to bed. I was just…thinking about something." And with a last glance at the night sky, Harry went back inside and crawled into his bunk knowing in his heart that tomorrow would bring grim news.
“What I wanted was to make our dinner reservation that I actually made,” Harry grumbled and as if on cue, his stomach gave a low rumble.
He made his way forward and noticing the security wizard still pointing his wand at Draco, he said. “You might want to lower your wand Harolds. Draco’s not here to cause problems.”
Shaking his head, Harry knew it was likely pointless to push the issue and so he turned towards the stairs, mentally calling Draco every kind of prat, idiot and git there was.
Harry slid his glasses on and blinked at Draco, smiling, “Merry Christmas Draco.” Leaning forward, Harry pressed a kiss onto Draco’s cheek as he reached around him to grab another piece of bacon.
"Oh, that was quite easy to figure out, actually. Your family has long been the second in command to Voldemort. Your father was imprisoned because of his loyalty and you almost killed Dumbledore to prove you belonged in the ranks of Voldemort. Yet, you refused to identify Harry when he was brought to you not long ago, and when the fight broke out here, you refused to fight for Voldemort. So even though you have changed, or thought about changing your loyalties, you feel that it is too late and that you would be unwelcome among those gathered here because of your past." Luna concluded, letting  her voice die away so Draco could think about the things she said.
After a lengthy pause, Harry started speaking again, "Draco, I'm not coming…" but this time, it was Draco's turn to interrupt.
“Shame,” Harry replied with a small smile, “I was going to thank you for bringing me breakfast in bed. But we might not have the time.”
Draco shrugged, feeling awkward for the first time at his uninvited presence in Harry’s home. “It was late, and I didn’t think you’d mind.” Draco fiddled with his cup, not returning Harry’s gaze.
“We both fucked up. I should’ve asked you about the date. You should’ve stood up for me to your parents.” Harry replaced his glasses, “but we can’t change any of that, so the question is what do we do now?”
This kiss was harsh with too much teeth and not enough tongue as Harry fought to get away. But Draco kept pushing, and when Harry wouldn’t yield to his wandering tongue, he settled for nipping lightly at Harry’s lips.  Heat and energy built between them, laced with anger, frustration, confusion, passion and an edge of desperation after days of being apart from one another.
Somewhere in his now sex-blown mind, Harry registered the fact that Draco was still fully clothed. Reaching down, Harry pulled Draco's face back to his own, allowing Draco to kiss him deeply while Harry undid the buttons of Draco's shirt, roughly pushing the fabric away from Draco's perfect skin. Using his legs, Harry managed to flip Draco so that he was now looking down at the pale perfection that was Draco's chest.
"We always took a unique approach to each other." Draco said with a little laugh, then he paused, looking straight into Harry's eyes, his face suddenly grave looking and deadly serious, "Harry, I have to leave. I don't know where I'll go, or how I'll get out, but I have to. I can't stay here. I can't continue living like this…" Harry tried to interrupt, but Draco ignored him and continued, "It's not your fault, like I said previously. In this case, it really is nobody's fault, it's just the reality of the situation—the result of unforeseeable and uncontrollable circumstances. I don't want to, but I have to…" Draco hesitated and Harry took his opportunity to speak up.
"Because I love you." And with that, Harry shifted Draco over in the bed and moved to snuggle next him. Wrapping his arms around Draco's waist, Harry pulled the frail man close, moving one hand to stroke Draco's hair as Draco's head come to rest on Harry's broad chest.
Draco, still in shock that he hadn't been thrown out, let Harry kiss him. When Harry pulled back, Draco asked in a weak tone, "But why would you love me?"
Harry watched as Draco moved carefully into a more upright position, keeping his jaw shut tightly to keep any noises of pain from escaping.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice sounded from the middle of the pack and Draco let out a visible sigh at the sound.
"Kreacher though Master might like some food. Master fought bravely. Kreacher is proud to serve the noble house of Black." The elf croaked and he handed Harry the plate and goblet.
"Thank you Kreacher," replied Harry, taking the food from the elf, "you served with honor today. Master Regulus would be very proud." At Harry's words, Kreacher shook with silent tears, and Harry walked passed him, adding "You may go now Kreacher."
Harry gave a hard laugh, “I’m being ridiculous? You’re the one who went on a date, and when you got caught, turned up here expecting me to act like it’s no big deal cause you were tricked.”
Harry's green eyes fixed on Draco's ice grey ones in a penetrating stare. A thousand thoughts were running through Draco's head as he tried to come up with an answer.
"Draco, I don't care if it hurts and I don't want you to prepare me with your finger. I want your cock in me now!"
Not coming up with any ideas, Harry flopped back down and opened the envelope, careful not to rip the front where his name was scrawled elegantly in midnight blue ink. Putting the envelope down, Harry turned the multiple pieces thick parchment over only to see blank pages staring back at him. Harry looked around for his wand before he realized he had left it in his cloak last night. Sighing, Harry put the letter down and went to retrieve his wand before returning to the comfort of his bed. Taping the letter with his wand, the same midnight blue ink and elegant scrawl that was on the envelope filled the pages before him. He began to read:
“Actually, I was hoping we could talk about something else—something unrelated to my official business here.” Harry said, staring at Draco’s back.
Harry stopped the ministration he had been giving Draco's neck and moved it instead to his earlobe so that he could nibble on it as he whispered huskily in Draco's ear.
Draco wasn't sure if that was going to work on the general public, but for now, it was good enough for him. He sighed contently, cuddled closer to Harry and let himself be overtaken by exhaustion.
Harry resolutely refused to allow Draco’s probing tongue entry, but his control slipped as Draco reached a hand down to cup his growing erection.
Harry nodded his thanks and made his way over to the lift, clenching his fists to keep his hands from shaking too badly as he waited for the lift to arrive.
Pulling himself away from Harry long enough to grab his hand, Draco practically dragged Harry back into the Gryffindor's dormitory, undoing the button on his own suit jacket as he did.
Draco opened one eye to glance at Harry, but closed it again quickly, a small smug smile playing at his mouth. “So let me get this straight—a mad wizard you’ve been unable to catch blows up me and my shop and you’re blaming me? Nice try Potter.”
Harry flinched, but kept his breathing even, willing himself to not get angry. Instead, he countered, “Maybe you’re right, but then at least be honest with me and yourself, because I don’t think I deserve you either but at least I have the guts to say that I still want you.”
"I know." Harry cut in, laughing slightly at the look of earnest confusion on Draco's face. "I know you didn't want to kill Dumbledore, I know you didn't intend for everything to be this way, and I know you had no choice. You were just protecting your family, right?" Draco swallowed hard and nodded before Harry continued. "You don't need to apologise for protecting those you love, Draco."
Turning around, Draco took in all the food laid out on the table under a stasis charm to keep it warm and fresh, “No thank you, Tilley. This all looks wonderful.”
"I love you Harry." Draco whispered so softly Harry almost missed it. With that said, Draco's eyes closed for the last time and Harry felt Draco's skin go cold next to his own.
“Tap into your inner Gryffindor and I’m sure you’ll figure it out.” She said with a smile as she turned to head back to the stairs.
Hermione looked closely at him and was surprising to see he looked ready to cry. She couldn’t keep the confusion out of her voice when she spoke next, “But you had a date Friday night. We-Ron and I- saw you.” As soon as she said these words, Draco paled and gripped his sides tighter. “That’s why Harry is ignoring you.” Hermione finished belatedly.
"Goodbye" Harry finished, and Draco nodded. Draco slowly let his hands slide down Harry's arms, making their way from his shoulders down to his hands. Taking Harry's hands gently in his own, Draco squeezed them and then he turned to leave but Harry's voice stopped him before he walked too far."Don't I get one last kiss goodbye?"
“It’d actually be a nice little solution to your problem wouldn’t it? Date when mommy and daddy are around, keep them quiet and then come home to me at night after washing off any traces of lipstick or perfume. Nice little Slytherin scheme, don’t you think?”
"I know you didn't mean to hurt me Draco but you don't need to protect me. You especially don't need to protect me from you; it's my heart and I knew what was at stake." Harry let go of Draco's arm, but Draco stayed rooted in his spot.
“But Auror Potter,” the wizard, Harolds, began but at seeing Harry’s glare, he clamped his mouth closed in a hurry.
creative list. Apparently intending to start his on his list immediately, Miguel reached for Harry belt, but Harry grabbed his wrists before he could get anywhere.
When the time came, Harry put on his best dress robes and ventured out of the ancestral Black home under the protection of his invisibility cloak to attend Draco's funeral. He sat alone in the back and stayed under his cloak the entire time as the few individuals who were in attendance paid their respects. It wasn't until after everyone had left, and Draco had been laid to rest in the Malfoy family plot that Harry felt safe enough to remove his cloak and approach the headstone.
At some point during his vigil, Harry must of have fallen asleep for his eyes popped open at the groans of pain that worked their way into his restless dreams. He was out of his chair and next to Draco’s bed before his mind could fully catch up with his body.
Draco checked the mantle clock one more time and made up his mind. Standing, he walked to the floo and throwing some powder into the fireplace, called out “Auror Headquarters” before stepping through the emerald flames. Arriving at the Auror transportation hub, Draco was about to head towards Harry’s office when some called out.
Both boys fell silent, turning to watch the sun sink out of view, signalling twilight's arrival. When Draco spoke next, it was in a barely audible whisper, "But I couldn't protect you. I tried so hard, but I couldn't protect you from myself." Draco started to turn away, but Harry caught him by his upper arm, forcing Draco around so that they were facing each other yet again.
"Is there anything I can help you with Malfoy?" Harry asked in a slightly apprehensive tone. He didn't know what to make of Draco appearing in his dormitory, but he was really looking forward to finding out why he had decided to come.
Harry felt his cheeks go warm and cleared his throat, “Of course, my apologies Mr. Malfoy.” Pulling a small vial from his robe pocket, he continued, “I was hoping that you could take a look at this potion. I know it’s a modified Polyjuice potion and other potions masters I’ve consulted were able to identify several of the modifications. However, they were unable to determine the purpose behind the modifications—” Harry hesitated but then added— “they all recommended that I consult you.”
“Draco?” He kept his voice soft, and he watched hopefully as eyelids fluttered opened and registered Harry standing there.
“Shame on me then, for wasting such an opportunity.” Harry moved to straddle Draco’s hips, running his hands under Draco’s t-shirt and up his chest.
Ignoring Draco’s comment, Harry continued, “From Eastern Europe—Bulgaria or Romania most likely. He has already shown to be exceedingly comfortable with spell creation and potion making, and he’s been highly resourceful. Previous samples of his work have indicated a willingness to use dark magic,
Harry closed his eyes as door closed and he started moving up. His eyes popped open as the lift shuddered to a halt and the door slide open with a cheerful ding.
The witch nodded and Harry watched as she disappeared into the back, and for the first time, he took the opportunity to look around Draco’s shop. It was small but neatly organised, and even from a distance, Harry could tell that the potions and special ingredients on display were of exceptional quality.
Draco spent the next two days trying every method of magical communication he could think of to no avail. He’d lost count of how many fire messages, owls and even patronuses he’d sent only to have them returned, unopened, each one causing his spirits to drop lower and lower until deciding drinking to oblivion would be less painful.
, Draco thought ruefully to himself as he swiftly made his way through the crowd. Breathing a sigh of relief as he reached the outer edge of the atrium space doubling as the dance floor for the night, Draco snagged another glass of champagne as he left, and began to wander through the darkened hallways of the newly completed ward which was the cause of the evening’s celebrations.
Pulling away just enough so he could see Draco’s face, Harry prepared for some sort of violent reaction, but it never came. Draco just leaned in, his forehead resting against Harry’s. Not in a rush and content to just enjoy the other man’s closeness, Harry closed his eyes, absentmindedly he moved hand to the nap of Draco’s neck, and ran his fingers through the short hair there.
“That’s what you think,” Draco said with a filthy grin and a wink, as he entered the green flames. Harry practically ran to follow.
Pulling his partner up for a sizzling kiss, Harry melted under the heat of the lips against his, and when he felt a tongue probing rather impatiently at his lips, he gladly granted it access, adding to the pleasure he was already feeling. Wrapped in Miguel's arms, Harry lost all sense of time as their bodies naturally moved together in an elaborate cycle of snogging and grinding.
Whatever Harry was expecting, it wasn’t that and Draco watched, somewhat relieved, as confusion washed over Harry’s face, almost fully erasing the rage that’d been there only moments before.
Even Hermione with all of her knowledge didn't have an answer for Harry. As he continued to pace around the room, the anger he was feeling mere moments ago gave way to despair once more as Harry contemplated the unfairness of life. Despair was slowly overcome by pain as hot tears built up behind Harry's glasses, obscuring Harry's vision and threatening to fall with the blink of an eye.
Even though he knew Draco was joking, his words caused a new wave of guilt to wash over Harry and settle deep in his chest. And as if he could read Harry’s thoughts, Draco opened both eyes again, and this time, Harry was unable to hide the wetness in his eyes no matter how quickly he tried to blink it away.
Draco turned around to see Harry still standing there, his face shining with new tears that had started to fall, and a small grin playing at the corners of his mouth, remembering the last time he had said those same words. Draco stood rooted in place, and Harry could see he was contemplating what to do—trying to decide if physical contact would make this goodbye unbearably hard.
Harry smiled slightly as he recognised the Slytherin house crest that was carved beautifully below the Malfoy crest. He kneeled down in front of the headstone, running his fingers slowly over the serpent in the Slytherin crest. He watched in amazement as, under his touch, the serpent transfigured itself to reveal the form of a stag with his head held high standing gracefully in the middle of the Slytherin crest. In his surprise Harry pulled his hand away, and the stag was replaced once again with the image of a snake.
Harry closed his eyes as he heard the familiar voice, still strong but a little harder than the last time he had heard it. Choosing not to answer, Harry instead walked forward until he was standing next to Draco and put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly. Draco cringed at the contact and let out a shaky breath before he stood up and faced Harry. Both boys simply looked into the eyes of the other, searching faces they had once known so well, searching for some indication that they weren't so different than a year ago. But they were. It was Draco who spoke first.
Watching Draco's face closely, Luna saw a look of recognition and she spoke up again before Draco had a chance to pose the question.
Harry laughed again as he stroked Draco's back. "Who cares? I'm the Chosen One. I saved the whole bloody world. I'm entitled to love who ever I want."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slowly left the Headmaster's office and made their way back down the stone stairs, stepping over the gargoyle that was still lying on its side.
Harry snorted, “No, definitely not. She started to pull her wand, but I disarmed her before she could do any serious damage.”
Harry didn't wait for Draco to make up his mind. Walking the few steps forward, he planted himself firmly in front of Draco. He reached up, looping his arms loosely around Draco's neck, he hands finding their way to the hair on the back of Draco's head. Harry pulled himself towards Draco until their breath mixed in the few centimetres left between them.
"Harry? What's wrong? Why are you out here?" Ron stood in the doorway facing Harry, his eyes half open, still blurry with sleep.
Harry stifled a yawn and looked at his watch. He was dismayed to see only ten minutes had passed. Merlin, he hated waiting. Especially when he was waiting in the portkey travel office. Especially when he was travelling to the world’s most boring security procedure conference. If he wasn’t the main speaker, he wouldn’t be going at all, but Head Auror Robards made it clear he didn’t have a choice but to accept the invitation when it was offered. Walking up to the service desk, Harry cleared his throat and waited for the wizard sitting behind the desk to look at him.
Arriving back at the floo connection, Harry was grateful the area was deserted as he stepped into the green flame.
“I’m going to need actually food, Draco. You don’t count.” Harry responded, redoing the button on his jeans.
Harry nodded, “Yes ma’am.” Making a deliberate effort to not run, Harry turned and started heading back to the Leaky Cauldron.
“This morning.” Harry continued, “when you woke me up, I thought you were going to head to the Manor.”
Green eyes then met grey ones, and both knew it was time. Whatever they had had, whatever dream and love they once shared, was gone, changed and made impossible by war and circumstances. In that knowledge, Draco step forward, placed a single chaste kiss on Harry's forehead before whispering "Goodbye Harry", and before Harry could answer, Draco had left.
Silence filled the space between them again, this one a little less comfortable than the last as each man was waiting for the other to realize that this was, in fact, crazy and probably a monumentally stupid idea.
Peering up at Harry, the other man pouted. "Ah, come on babe, I know you want it." And as if to prove his point, he moved one hand to cup Harry's erection.
Harry nodded and turned his head to meet Draco’s gaze. “I didn’t expect you to stay.” He said softly.
Looking at the take-out still sitting on the table, Draco’s appetite was suddenly gone. Instead, he snagged the full bottle of wine from the counter and made his way to their bedroom. Settling on the bed, Draco clutched Harry’s pillow to his chest with one hand, and uncorked the bottle of wine with the other.
Putting a hand out to stabilise himself as relief washed through him, Harry looked at the Healers, “Can I see him?” He managed to get out.
Draco looked up and met her gaze briefly before looking away again. “My parents,” he took a breath to steady himself, “They don’t care that I’m gay. I mean, they don’t think it matters. It doesn’t stop me from getting married and producing an heir. Love or attraction don’t enter the equation for them, it’s an expectation they have of me.”
But alas, Harry's luck just wasn't that good. Pushing past Miguel and his new friend—clearly rejection had little effect on Miguel’s libido—Harry whispered a jinx in Miguel's direction before he disaparated. At least the bastard wouldn't be getting laid tonight either, Harry thought darkly as he knocked on the door in front of him.
Ron yelped in alarm as Hermione appeared from nowhere behind them, her expression all business. “There you are! Sorry to interrupt, Harry, but Ron and I have somewhere to be. Right. Now.”
“Sadly not,” replied Draco, surprised by the change of topic. “I was only thinking today that it was perfect flying weather, too. I practice a bit, here and there, when I get the time… just to stay in shape, though. Hardly had a chance to fly lately… and who would I play with, anyway?”
“Of course.” Draco extended his hand next to the table. “Pleased to meet you, Neville. Call me Draco.” After only a second’s hesitation, Neville unfolded his arms, reached out and clasped Draco’s outstretched hand. He shook it firmly.
always been telling him what to do: that’s how it had felt at the time, at least. As though he’d been annoyed at Harry; envious of his freedom, when Draco still couldn’t venture out safely in wizarding London. Jealous of him for having hobbies while all Draco’s time was taken up with studying.
, mostly, whenever I’m in an unfamiliar place, or feeling nervous, but also for Firewhisky, if I’m with people who are drinking, or if I’m embarrassed or ashamed, or – I guess – if I just want to escape. Most of the time they pass quickly, but sometimes they don’t, and I can’t sleep, and… oh, I still get panic attacks, as well. And I get frustrated when I can’t remember things, and I know I worry too much about what people think of me. I can be irritable…”
going to get enough of this. “Anyway,” Draco prompted, rolling his hips languidly against Harry’s palm between kisses, “as much as I’m enjoying receiving the laziest hand job of all time on your dusty stairs, didn’t you say there was a bedroom somewhere?”
Things wound down rather quickly from there. Harry’s teammates called out sleepy farewells before Apparating home, and one by one, the Unspeakables began to do the same. Harry stood awkwardly off to the side, watching Malfoy chat away blithely to the
being selfish and immature. I felt guilty that you were stuck at home while I was out enjoying myself, so I deliberately put it out of my mind. It was cowardly of me.”
Warnings: In this chapter, a very minor instance of what could be considered infidelity occurs (not between Harry and Draco).
Draco paused, trying to collect his thoughts. Being well enough to wander around the flat in his pyjamas, making toast the Muggle way and taking long, relaxing baths was one thing. Running a business and dealing with the general public, without
“Don’t – don’t, please don’t call me –” He chokes on the last word, face wet with tears. Harry’s eyes are prickling too, and he leans forward, gathering Draco up in his arms.
It was the moment where Potter’s own hand moved towards his, as if to cover it, that startled Draco out of his trance. He pulled away so quickly that he almost lost balance, and he slammed his palm down on the stone floor to steady himself. The sound cut through the heavy silence like a knife. As Draco made to jump to his feet, he couldn’t help but sneak a quick look at Potter’s groin, still covered by his jeans.
Leonie, too, was happy to chat with him, but her mind was clearly elsewhere, and no wonder – her curly-haired date kept levitating elaborate cocktails over to her in increasingly excessive displays of magical prowess, making her roll her eyes and giggle. She introduced Draco to all of her friends, who were mostly excitable and talkative. Draco nodded along, wondering how they’d managed to secure invites, and trying not to think about his own miserable adolescence.
Draco recalled that, once upon a time, there had been a reason why he didn’t want to get involved with Potter. Right now, he couldn’t have named it if his life had been at stake. He’d turned Potter down, over and over, and somehow the man still wanted him. And he looked like
“I know.” Draco looks at him sharply, then, but Harry steels himself, presses ahead. “It took me a long time to get over you, Draco.”
– but she wiped her own hand on a napkin and took his all the same, unpleasant residual stickiness clinging to her long, bony fingers. Her sauce-stained lips twisted – a smile, Draco presumed – revealing slightly too-sharp teeth beneath. Draco suppressed a shiver.
Cradling it against his stomach, Draco stumbled out to the bedroom. The tapping was so loud and abrasive it felt like it was actually inside his head, and he looked around for the source. It was Megaera, her long talons scraping against the glass. Draco sighed: of course, he’d missed lunch with Mother. He opened the window, the wind blowing warm rain against his face, and hopped aside to avoid an impatient peck to his shoulder. As expected, his mother sounded very worried, asking him to Floo-call as soon as possible. Instead he scribbled a short, messy note mentioning a Quidditch accident – not to worry, a very minor bump, but he needed his rest, of course he’d call her when he could – tied it to Megaera’s leg and watched with relief as she flew off, buffeted side to side by the growing wind.
“It’s not―” he started, but his voice was small, slipping easily away to nothing. The silence settled heavily between them, and the room seemed to grow darker: the shift in mood notable, and all Draco’s fault. Desperate to make amends, he hooked his chin over Harry’s shoulder, spoke urgently into the soft skin in the crook of his neck.

was keeping his expression neutral. He’d been neither surprised nor interested that Potter had found his inevitable happily-ever-after with the Weasley girl, and, like the rest of the wizarding world, he’d expected them to marry and pop out red-haired offspring at the soonest opportunity. News of their break-up around Christmas time had come as a shock to everyone, and not a week had gone by since without another speculative article in the

brushed it off, because―” He broke off abruptly, and Draco held his breath. “―well, because what was being suggested matched my own desires, I suppose.”
The door creaked slowly open. Familiar green eyes gazed at him dolefully from beneath a pair of enormous curly horns.
how to treat the fatigue, or what they’re even looking for. It’s all to do with latent magic, you see…” she continued, as Lee blatantly scanned the room with the obvious aim of catching anyone’s eye.
Spotting him should have been easy in the half-deserted stand, and when Draco’s eyes failed to discern that familiar form, his heart began to sink. But he dutifully walked down to Row B anyway, peering down the bench. First sat a father and son, ridiculous in cannon-shaped hats which regularly huffed out orange balls of smoke. Next, a young couple, hand-in-hand, a wind-swept pygmy puff poking its head up from inside her coat – then – then an old wizard, beard down to his waist, eating a foot-long hot dog…
“Okay, okay, I’ll leave you alone!” Lee’s exasperation was clear. “But remember, spider guy’ll be here in an hour or so. I need you down here for that.” He heard her footsteps moving away from the staircase.
Lucius’ death had heralded another change too, of course: for Draco’s benefit, her soft, elegant socialite hands had been put to use for the very first time – and not just sowing and harvesting either, but grappling with carnivorous plants and heaving Mandrakes from the earth. The fresh air and exertion had suited his mother, leaving her body toned and her skin glowing – healthy, proud, and even lovelier than before. Over the past few years Draco was sure he recalled admiring her photographs on the society pages of the

have known better. Robards had a history of picking the worst possible times to discuss these charity things, slipping them in ever-so-casually between other topics and couched in so much euphemism that they teetered on the cusp of outright lying. The ‘themed photoshoot’ he’d mentioned on that dragon poacher stakeout, for example? Naked calendar. ‘Dinner and a show tomorrow?’ dropped in while they were queuing for the Floos (‘it’ll be warm, so don’t wear too many layers’, he’d added, ominously) – a sodding bachelor auction. And then there was the Friday morning that Harry had opened the door to the briefing room, only to be met by an uncomfortably appraising look and the bizarre question ‘you’re what, a 44-inch chest?’ One nervous nod, and before Harry could back out, he’d found himself strutting up and down on a makeshift runway in the Atrium, wearing an Occamy scale waistcoat and black trousers so painfully tight that they cut off the circulation to his balls.
