She looked up, catching his eye. “Doesn’t mean it’s not progress though. That’s what you’re always saying, anyway.”
He nodded and rose before she had the chance. “I understand. Doctor’s orders.”
“That’s not exactly news.”
Draco nodded and Vanished the stem.
“If I want?”
“And,” Hermione added, “I will admit, while he certainly made an earnest case in our meetings, it was a bit unexpected, all things considered.”
them, too. Their chess pieces don’t even move.
“Depends. The objects they’re looking for are something of an indicator. That one was fairly predictable.”
“Oh.”
“Merlin.” I’m not sure if I want him to hear it. I’m not sure if I care. Seeing him, after so many months...it’s not as though it’s a masterpiece. It’s an arsehole, a pink ring surrounded by dark skin and darker hair. But it’s his arsehole, this place no one’s touched, or licked, or seen before.
Every nerve in Draco’s body was on high alert as he waited to follow Harry into the Floo.
Draco had never had Sola’s private lunch service before. He’d been hearing about the Iberico pork and parmesan foam for ages, though.
“Yes,” Harry pleads.
He loosened his grip and stepped away slowly in hopes that Potter wouldn’t retaliate.
Draco gapes, tries to recover. “Do you intend to talk from out there?”
Pansy’s been throwing tantrums all week. Huffy little snits and the usual barbs, but more frequently than even her usual. No idea what it’s about, but it’s especially strange for being accompanied by an eagerness that’s notable even for her. Very handsy. Bending over, stopping by on her way back from the shower, lots of cleavage. Which for Pansy means that her nipples are on the verge of a prison break at any given moment.
Harry whines at that, pops off with a pout. “I like your cock in my mouth.”
“How’s work?” It was out before he’d thought better of it.
“I’m very glad to hear it.” Silence threatened to reign again and Draco pressed forward, grabbing the first topic that came to hand. “And have you been able to talk more about the other things you mentioned?”
She bumped her shoulder into his without taking her attention away from Draco. “Why?
Which does not matter at all.
Pansy had to stop at least thrice for laughing so hard. I’m sure I would’ve done the same if it wasn’t almost too absurd to laugh about.
“Given the particulars of my job, it got a bit hard to ensure he never heard anything.” She grinned. “So we reached a compromise, involving very large, very unfortunately placed boils, should he ever repeat anything.”
“Yes, please do.”
He’d been stunned the first time he’d seen an irregular canvas; had stood, agog, in front of a trapezoid so bursting with colour that he couldn’t have any reaction to it that
Unfortunately, his own mind isn’t so neatly locked away. The longer he goes without thinking about any of it, the more persistently thoughts of Potter reassert themselves. He can’t shake the cruelly fresh memory of Potter’s enraptured face looking up at him, or his sleepy contentment as he’d rested on Draco’s knees. Can’t forget the heat of his fingertips.
“So it’s when he’s upset? That doesn’t make sense, if he got that mad at Pansy and didn’t destroy anything.”
Somewhere, in the back of his brain, Draco knows he should go for his wand. Or leave. Or turn Potter around and remind him of what it feels like to be pinned against a wall.
“Obviously.”
“My friends go to Muggle places. And – what are you talking about?”
At the bottom of the staircase Harry starts to loosen his hold on Draco’s arm. Draco lets him, only to twine their fingers together.
“But there is something else, of course. We at the Trauma Resource Centre strive to change the way members of the British wizarding community see one another, the ways we’re able to care for one another.” He smiled humbly at the crowd. “It may be easy to see one person or a group of people as the symbols of the war, to pretend it only happened to witches and wizards who were on the front lines. That’s not entirely true, though, is it? All of us, on both sides of the war, whether in the middle of the fight or sitting at home hoping desperately for words of missing friends and family… we all fought a battle of some sort, and we all bear the scars for it. When we acknowledge that, when we share that weight with one another instead of carrying it alone, we can begin a type of healing that isn’t otherwise possible.
J. L. Shit, this is all wrong. He has to start over.
But then, he’d planned for it. It was only a few days until classes started, and he was meant to make a trip to the Manor in between. Millie sent all British Ministry correspondence to the Manor, and Pansy sent it on to Draco, and the letters from Croaker and Robards had become more insistent. He’d been able to put them off once with a report, sent the week before Christmas and probably shelved in the rush before the holidays, but now they wanted him in person, and he’d agreed. He was to Apparate early morning on the 8th, meet with them that afternoon, and return home that same evening, or the next morning. Depending on whether he felt up to all that Apparition and, he would admit to himself, whether there were other pulls towards a longer stay at the Manor. Classes started the following Monday, but he didn’t really have to be back until Sunday evening, depending on how it all went.
There was only one thing to do, then. He gripped the neck of a very nice Bourdeaux and rounded the corner. He heard voices once he was in the dining room, and then he was looking into the kitchen.
“No,” Draco replies, stomach twisting when he hears Potter’s sigh of relief. “There’s no need for you to stay.”
- Crime scene access
“Really?” Pansy asked, her voice far more sober than he would’ve expected. “Even with Potter skulking about?”
He buries himself inside of Malfoy, fucks him until he’s well past speech, bites down on his shoulder, and comes.
Draco half expected gasps from the members. They didn’t come. Perhaps because, save the bill’s most fervent supporters, the Wizengamot appeared to hang on Harry’s every word. Draco couldn’t particularly blame them. He was hard to look away from.
“If only I’d have left the country,” Harry joked. Or sort of joked. Draco couldn’t tell how much he meant it.
“Right. Okay. I’ll, um, be right back, then.” He leans the two frames against the counter and goes back towards the warehouse.
Several members of the press stopped leaning over the bench.
“Yes.”
“That’s a yes, then. Granger. Who else? Finnigan and Weasley.” He looked to Potter, who was still pointedly blank. “Oh, hang it, I’ll get a list from Granger.”
“I – okay. Okay. Sorry.”
“You just know? That’s thoroughly meaningless.”
“Very similar to what we’ve been doing.” Draco did not object to glossing over the theoretical portion, which he thought might predetermine Potter’s answer. “Walks on the grounds once a day for about an hour.”
Potter doesn’t send another owl. Nor does he release a statement, either to confirm or deny.
Good old Longbottom.
“Harry,” Draco began, his pulse starting to flutter at the base of his neck. “I have a question for you. A couple of them, actually. And a thought.”
. I—” He pointed to the wall. “Those blobs. What do you see?”
“I’m sure.”
Draco was startled by the intensity of it, the raw vulnerability written on Harry’s face. “Gorgeous,” he said, sliding his hand up around Harry’s waist.
Was it foolish to invite him back? I’d love to claim it as the most brilliant of my Slytherin machinations. It wasn’t. There was little else to do. An extra pair of hands has its uses, certainly, and watching Potter, with all his clumsy fumbling, make an attempt at art was sure to be amusing. But the fact of the matter was, he had me on the ropes.
Then he realised there was no good reason not to.
. Mumbling things that Draco’s not certain he can stand to hear.
“Well, then. Let’s start and see where the mood takes us, shall we?”
“Does our blood predict our skill? Does it determine our morality? Our intelligence? The contribution we make? What we give of ourselves in service to the whole?” Harry lowered his head, turning away from the bench so the press, and Draco, could see a bittersweet smile cross his face before he looked back to the Wizengamot.
“I have half a mind to leave you to your fate,” he said, viciously. “I'm sure the
Potter's grin wanes.
“Well, you're missing out,” said Harry, trying to mask the excitement he was feeling. “Especially considering how – judging from how hard your dick is right now – you seem to really enjoy having things up your ass.”
“It feels like I have to go to the bathroom,” whimpered Malfoy, holding on to the bottom of his stomach with both hands. His dick was starting to get hard too, Harry saw – most likely from the immense amount of pressure the snake was putting on his prostate. “Like I have to take a huge shit.”
“I will,” he said, reaching past Malfoy's boulder of a belly to cup the rim of his ever-stretching asshole. “But you will need to make it worth my while, one way or another.”
“We’re going to die, Potter,” he groans, clutching at the  rapidly swelling mound with both hands. “Your fucking spell is going to kill us both, you stupid prick.”
Malfoy winced again, leaning against the wall with his free hand. He seemed to be in a great amount of pain.
“Harry,” said Hermione, in a reasonable tone. “Ron is right. Malfoy looked very sick, he's probably in the infirmary.”
... fuck, it hurts, it hurts so bad, fuck, Potter, I need to come, I need to...
“It is. Though hopefully they got rid of the fleas before you set them on the rug.”
His musing results in a barely repressed grin when he reaches the tables section. Potter was quite adept at furniture dodging. No wonder he won the war, really.
Millie leaned forward, her voice turning gentle once again. “His word, Draco. He’s an adult. You might not like his decision or how he’s come to it, but it’s his to make.”
“But why? Why ask for–” He snapped his mouth shut.
“No,” Harry insists.
“Good morning, Professor.”
“Rather.”
Draco gestured expansively. "Please, Potter, have a seat."
“Master Draco.” He bowed, panting. “Mistress Pansy, we is still working, but we has elf magic, we is fixing everything now.”
“It is?” Draco realised he was feeling as off-kilter as Potter looked. The way Potter was looking at him didn’t make sense. There was curiosity in it. Maybe sympathy, or some shared wonder. It felt like the first time Draco had walked into the finished room and felt as though the floor had fallen out from under him.
“And there won’t be.”
Potter’s eyebrows shot up so abruptly Draco half-imagined them launching themselves onto the ceiling and sticking there.
’s bestseller lists all the time.”
A breeze flows over them, fresh and cool. Harry has learned, in a far easier way than he ever would’ve thought possible, that Draco is not a morning person. He lingers as long as possible in these quiet, crisp moments, and Harry is content to let him. To watch him. Draco’s hair has darkened ever so slightly in the years since they left Hogwarts, but when the sunlight streams in, it lights his hair—his whole—an otherworldly glow.
“Would you like to start levitating bottles, or shall I do it on my own?”
Draco had never seen a room of politicians look so genuinely moved. Or so genuine, period. Or so silent, for that matter. But Harry’s presence held them in a sort of thrall.
Harry grimaced. “Neither. My handwriting’s shite enough as it is and you’ll just hear hissing.”
At the last moment he thought he could get away with it, he pulled back. He could still taste Harry on his tongue, and that was hard enough without the feel of Harry’s stubble on his lips. He settled for running his thumb along the line of Harry’s jaw, dropping it when he reached the point just under the centre of Harry’s bottom lip. “Be safe,” he said. “Take care. And I guess I’ll see you, for the Ministry stuff.”
“It’s a miracle no one else has,” Draco interrupted. He’d been expecting it. Prepared for it.
Harry laughed and nodded again.
“Except…” I can’t say it; can’t even entirely comprehend that fucking my arse is the only sort of fucking he’s done. “Ever?”
Draco took a step backwards, and then another. Potter made no move to follow him or halt his progress. Just kept looking towards him without ever looking at him, until his back hit the door and he slipped out of the room.
Draco responds through gritted teeth. “Madam, this
- Looks up whenever someone enters or leaves; keeps track of who is in the room

“Perfect,” I tell him, bringing my fingers back.
“This is the last bit of the Hogwarts reconstruction effort, remember? Once we’ve confirmed a result there’s to be a celebratory fundraising gala. Add to the library, create additional scholarship funds, that sort of thing.”
“I do have a wand, you know.”
My cock’s heavy in my hand. I’m so hard, and light-headed, and I half wonder if they’re related, but it’s not always the case. I don’t feel this dizzy when I’m wanking, or when it’s a stranger sucking me off behind a club somewhere. Though I’m loathe to admit it, I know viscerally that this has everything to do with him.
“Glamorous.”
“I’ve already told you, it has to be good sex.”
“Can’t I? I’ve got dozens of memories that say otherwise, a very sophisticated verification team to prove it, an in-Pensieve camera in development, and a public that’s all too happy to believe what they want to believe.”
Harry laughs. Or starts to. What if it wasn’t really a joke? If it was, it’s at his expense and, even if most of his inheritance is as hideously ugly as Draco’s suggesting, he doesn’t want Draco to really think that he couldn’t make a home. Not that he cares. But now he’s laughed and Draco’s shoulders are looking awfully tense. At least he thinks there are. Draco’s always so stiff in those robes, it’s hard to tell.
“Later,” she said quietly, keeping her eyes trained on the centre of the room. Under the cover of the seatback in front of her, she pointed to the press.
Whatever Potter might have said about his supposed reclusiveness, they managed to get more pictures of him than he’d let on. There was a grainy photo of Potter leaning on the bar at the Leaky, his head thrown back as he laughed at his companion’s joke. One of Potter, clearly taken through a window, being fitted for robes at Madam Malkin’s, the fabric hanging open over Muggle jeans, sliding over his hips as he smiled kindly and turned to let an assistant at his sleeve.
“To make the world safe for Muggles and their creations, which is, I’ll point out, exactly what I’m trying to do here.
He has a million questions and not a single one of them is worth asking if it involves taking Potter’s cock out of his mouth.
“For whom, exactly?”
“Yes, that is a key indicator of quality.”
“What’s that going to tell you?”
“Hurt him,” Harry finished. “Badly.”
Harry snorted and raised his glass. “Best watch your compliments. My head might explode under the influence of such effusive praise.”
“No,” Harry confirmed. “I thought about it right up until that evening. We practised that afternoon—it was the second time we tried conjuring charms in the conservatory—and I wondered if you remembered.”
Potter blinked, opened his mouth, and closed it again.
“The search. They’re not looking for you. For us.” His brow furrowed. He searched my face, confused, for a sign of relief, of happiness.
"Let's call," Draco answered, trying his best for good cheer even as his stomach roiled.
Draco wasn’t sure he would like the answer to his question, but he was sure he needed to ask. “Were you given the option of a conventional implant?”
Draco, in the midst of enjoying a long and desperately needed mouthful of tea, almost choked when he realised what Millie knew and Granger didn’t.
It took Draco’s eyes a moment to adjust, looking into the darkness with the light of the adjacent gallery still behind him. He thought, though, that he might have done a quicker job of it than Potter; Draco doubted that he was meant to see the look of sadness that crossed over Potter’s features.
“You’ve still got your trousers on.”
“We will also send our best team to document the charity event of your choosing, and are willing to devote several hundred words to coverage of that cause, as a gesture of sincere regret and goodwill. We do hope that—”
Next to him, Potter raked his fingers through his hair. “Quite a night.”
* * *
Harry nodded, and caught the edge of his cup between his teeth.
“And condoms, protection charms, whatever.”
“I didn’t put it there Malfoy, Christ. I told you, there were some around before. It’s probably…bred, or something. Everybody meant to check when this one started rattling, but, you know...” he trails off.
He forced himself to take a breath. “I would assume you mean former Death Eaters.” It wasn’t a question; he didn’t wait for an answer. “However, all of those witches or wizards marked as Death Eaters are either in the ground, in Azkaban, or in this room, Auror Robards. Is that incorrect?”
Harry nodded and concentrated on the tip of his wand. Again, he returned a few cups of soil to the pot, but most of it remained scattered around the room.
“You don’t need to do it like this.”
Potter looked shocked. Potter looked stricken.
Potter’s hand followed easily when Draco rolled his hips into Potter’s. He could feel his own hand, through Potter’s jeans and his own trousers, as he pulled Potter off. Could feel the delicious friction of Potter’s cock in his hand, and Potter’s hand around his cock, and his teeth at Potter’s neck, and Potter’s hand grasping at his hair, pulling back until their mouths met.
Grey eyes flash dangerously. “Already am.” Draco tightens his grip. “What do you want?”
Draco smiled.
“Doesn’t it?”
Robards hummed. “How much time do you need?”
Draco uncrossed his legs and raised his eyebrows. “Still waiting on that whisky? Thought it was your second choice.”
Harry laughed breathlessly. “Fuck, Malfoy.”
Harry smiled, a blown out grin, and tightened his arm around Draco’s shoulders. “More.”
“What did you say to her? She thinks it’s all her fault.”
. Draco, look at me.”
“You’re free to go.”
“With Croaker and Robards involved? Almost certainly.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “Not because they have anything to do with each other, but because it didn’t sound like it was about the job so much as the country.”
, multiplied across every newsstand in the wizarding world:
“Sir?”
Instead of attempting speech, he takes a drink from his own glass, and promptly chokes. It
“I—” Potter stopped and started again, plastering on a most collegial smile. No on authentic, then. “You’re the expert, and I will of course follow your recommendations, but is that safe? Hermione must have told you that my magic is rather unstable.”
—and it had seemed so snide, so dismissive, that Harry couldn’t resist a retort, and then Malfoy couldn’t resist one back, and it had all been downhill from there. They hadn’t spoken since. Harry thought that was for the best.
“Sort of a going away present.”
He imagined she’d enter the room shoe first, a heel in some outrageous colour followed by a shapely leg and some scandalous, fashionable robes. But she appeared all at once. Normally, as a human—a regular one, unembellished by imagination—would do. In plain black robes that fell to her knees and heels that, for all the racket, would’ve been more at home in a Hogwarts classroom than a nightclub. Her hair was just as he remembered it, a severe black bob that curled under her jaw, but she looked older—ten years, at least—than the Pansy that had lived on in his memories.
He turns his wand on himself. A
The bastard had probably messed with all the ergonomics, Draco realised. All of them. Even the angle on his lumbar support.
Harry nodded, inhaled, and closed his eyes.
She paused. He suddenly felt uncomfortably scrutinised. She hummed. “But you might if you weren’t his doctor.”
She nodded at him, and leaned into Finch-Fletchley’s ear. “Have you seen, Rosabelle Ollivander is flirting
Harry’s voice is so thoroughly laced with eagerness that Draco is almost taken aback, and certainly loses track of his thoughts. Has Harry been this worried about him? Because he’s said he’s fine? Which is, admittedly, not the sort of description he’s generally capable of, but he hadn’t quite realised Harry would’ve noticed and can only do so much better in the midst of a revelation. “Warm,” he offers.
“I can’t research anywhere else.”
Harry began pacing, his boots digging into the soft pile. "Great. That's just great, Malfoy."
“Always has done,” Greg said. “Reckon it’d be like… well, like a Seeker without an opponent. Off balance.”
have a memory.”
“Have so,” Harry defends. “One summer.”
Potter shrugged again.
He’s so much more open. He winces, sore around the rim, at first, but it’s easy to slide into him now. I’m almost hypnotised for a moment, watching my fingers disappear so easily into his arse, watching his cock bob against his stomach.
“You want to leave so badly—” Draco’s throat threatened to close and he had to start over. “You want to leave so badly you’re willing to die for it?”
“Ron asked, and you – oh, I guess... I guess originally Ginny did. But we all figured you’d be able to, anyway. Why does that make a difference?”
Draco closed his eyes and drew a deep, ragged breath, followed by a smooth exhale.
“No,” Draco snaps. “You’re moving
Coming wasn’t a terribly likely outcome, though, and I worried he might strain his jaw. Concern flashed across his face, and then I suppose he saw mine. I know he did, he said it was beautiful. Wasn’t a moment to argue.
decorated, perhaps, but not overtly shameful. It had been a dusty mess the last time he’d been here.
The sheets are, it turns out, satisfactory for Draco’s hands, and his legs, and his good night’s sleep. And, in the morning, for another slow half-awake press of bodies. And after that, for breakfast in bed.
* * *
It’s not a proper pitch, though, and neither of them has quite enough time to recover. Draco barely has time to push the broom away before he tears through thick silk and collides with something that is, thankfully, not hard enough to injure. He hears another thud and hopes Harry’s managed to do the same.
- Public appearances
He tried to take a calming breath. It did absolutely nothing.
Draco looked at him and looked at him. His eyes were the same. His hair was tamer, though probably for it being midday at a restaurant rather than in the middle of a walk around the grounds or a game of magical catch or first thing in the morning. Draco looked so long Harry began to squirm, shifting to one side, crossing and uncrossing his legs.
Harry’s heart pounds.
“I guess.”
He blinks. Closes his mouth. Looks up. “How?”
“You can.”
– Azkaban.
Prippa seemed, at first, to ignore his comment, holding her tiny arms out for Draco’s cloak without remark, but he noticed a shakiness to her that was unusual for an elf. “Prippa has prepared tea for Master.”
“I do want. I—“ Harry shook his head. “I didn’t think…” He turned his head, hiding it.
“Yeah, um. Morning.” Potter shakes his head as if to clear it and looks up suddenly. “Listen, Malfoy, I’m really sor—”
went next, gripping Potter by the shoulders, holding him at arm’s length and then pulling him in. Then the girl Weasley, who was gentlest of all. Certainly when compared to the remaining twin, whose handshake exploded into a shower of spectral silver snakes, which were declared to be in honour of their host. The oldest one, with the earring, settled for a non-explosive handshake, but his wife seemed to be taking lessons from her mother-in-law, and punctuated a stranglehold of a hug with a kiss to each cheek.
“Yes,” Malfoy agreed.
“What, that I secretly hate my friends? It’s nonsense. Utter codswallop. Can’t treat something that isn’t there.”
Potter’s on his third biscuit by the time they reach the liquor aisle. Potter’s scepticism about it had been enough to make Draco insist.
Draco is startled into looking at him. “Thinking of it, or did it? Is that thing sitting in my department again?”
“Are you really going to make me say it?”
Perhaps not. Harry pulls his hand away, squeezing Draco’s thigh, and a moment later his mouth pops off too.
A rousing chorus came from the bench in such a wave that Draco thought he might smell their collective breath across the room.
“That may be, but it doesn’t stop them from trying. Now that Weasley’s story about getting into the Chamber is public knowledge, it’s only so long until somebody stumbles on the password.”
Draco sets his sights on a walnut chest of drawers, dropping it into the line.
“Outdoors.” Draco raises an eyebrow.
“Dr Malfoy? Is there an emergency?” She was breathless, her bun thoroughly disheveled.
“Oh.” Draco’s stomach sinks. He hadn’t actually thought about what he would be apologising for. It seemed evident that some sort of apology was necessary for the Champagne and perhaps the blind item, but it seems, if his expectant eyebrow is anything to go by, that Potter is anticipating something more. “Would you like to have a seat?”
, that it isn’t “useless posturing” when one part of the team is able to solve a problem, while the other’s chief objective is lying to the public.”
Harry worked his mouth open and shut helplessly and Draco, otherwise unmoving, reached a hand up to cover it.
It is, however, far more literal.
“Doubt it.”
Granger paused, sharing a quick glance with Millie and then turning back to Draco. “It is elder wood and Thestral hair, yes.”
“Except for one thing.” Draco turned to face him.
The way he handles books, though. Harry had never really seen Ginny handle books, at least not so far as he can remember. He must have, at some point. But it wasn’t quite so memorable. Wasn’t quite like this, the way Draco moves so precisely, the way he uses one finger to tilt the books back off the shelf, the way he
The thing is, it's unmistakably his. If Draco saw it he’d know right away that it was Harry’s. And then if he didn't do anything, or if he sent an official notice, then Harry would know that he really wasn’t welcome. But if he sent an owl instead, or maybe firecalled, that would be a different thing altogether. Maybe he’d even invite Harry to come get it. Or offer to bring it to Harry.
“I told them,” he confirmed, “that it looks like a bunch of teenagers. Not sure what they’re using, but it doesn’t look terribly sophisticated, probably something they stumbled onto by accident.”
*          *          *
Harry rested his hand on Draco’s chest, five warm points surrounding his heart. “Depends on what you do with it.”
Malfoy shook his head.
He remembers all those eventuallys that turned into years of cold sheets. He keeps moving forward.
“Yeah, both of those,” Harry said. “And sort of open to the world? Having a sense of possibility?”
“Yes,” Millie snorted. “Will you reconsider now?”
Harry’s heart skips a beat. Did Draco say—? Does he mean—?
Draco goggled. One kiss with a man and Harry was planning to come out. It was so typical of him, so blindly Gryffindorish, that Draco could’ve kissed him then and there if he wasn’t so set on hearing the rest of what Harry had to say.
, there’s not exactly a Hippocratic Oa–Oh.” Draco stopped short. A wave of cold fury washed over him as Potter’s intimation caught up. “Oh.” Draco laughed. “She feels it’s unethical, doesn’t she?”
“This morning, when we were talking. He heard us talking about… your dad… and what he does.” Harry muttered, before looking up to Draco’s terrified expression and rushly adding, “He’s not gonna tell anyone. He knows it would piss me off and stress me out more, and lately Ron and Mione have been treating me like their injured baby. They don’t want to agitate me, and you getting hurt agitates me.”
Diggory walked in, looking proud and beaten. Harry hoped he could return just like that.
Draco looked apprehensive.
2. I wanted to write two chapters to make up for it. So expect another one real soon after.
“Because we can do the forbidden magic that according to them only their god can do?”
When the sun disappeared and the only source of light were the Lumos that the boys procured to be able to see past their noses, Draco had laid his head on Harry’s shoulder and finally breached the subject of Mrs. Weasley and his family affair. The request bothered Draco, but after a few minutes of explaining and convincing, he understood how rare and unachievable it is to catch Narcissa without Lucius. As they left the garden, Draco promised that before bed he would go to the owlery with a letter for his mother.
Both men, actually, everyone stopped, and waited for his approval. The approval of a teenager. And Harry’s seen it a few times before already where the Weasley’s would take his word as gospel and make him almost untouchable.
Mentions of domestic abuse.
“Yup, I don’t know how, but … I guess I’ll wing it like everything else,” Harry piped in, staring grim and ending more cheerful than he felt. He guessed he was counting on his dumb luck getting him out of this one in one piece.
He was biting his lips again. Not the inside. He was very nervous.
“I have to subdue a fucking dragon.” The panic in his eyes said what his tone didn’t. Help.
“Because it’s not nice to spread false rumors.”
Very few people hid their wrists. He knew of one case where this girl hid her wrists, not because she was ashamed of who was her soul mate, who she had already met and was friends with, but because who was her enemy. Because clearly, her own mother couldn’t be her soul mate.  Prof. Sprout did not take kindly to the news, and it was now a full-blown investigation into child abuse.
Harry and Ron nodded.
Finally he heard the aggressive opening of a door and the angry shuffling away of Lucius Malfoy with the rhythmic beat of his cane.
No one listened to Arthur when he told them Lucius was not to be trusted. That he was a Deatheater. And later it became more obvious why; many of them were also Deatheaters, or were benefiting from the Deatheaters’ cause. The Ministry had been rotting for over a decade, and just when Arthur was beginning to chip away at the rot, Lucius nurtured it. And it grew so much that people couldn’t even remember how it’d look like before the rotting. Many still don’t. People now see it as a given. The rotting had become the new normal, and that… angered Arthur.”
Harry bit his lips, raising his eyebrows at them, “Alright, I’m leaving tonight with more questions than answers. Thanks!”
Harry had just intended to distract himself up there while he waited for midnight to come… apparently Draco had intended to come up an hour early to prep himself up for whatever… he needed to say to Harry? So when Harry climbed the last of the stairs and found Draco muttering to himself, he accepted the glare that came soon after the announcing cough he gave.
Harry searched in his bag to see if he had any spellotape, exclaiming internally when he found some in Rob’s bag, using it to tape the lavender to the ceiling of his bed, throwing the tape away and cuddling the warm blanket on a night that seemed to only get colder.
“The murder is there. The story with Salazar getting ostracized and the gathering of his followers is not. I guess despite wanting to send a biased message that Salazar had malevolent and cruel intentions, they did not want to completely tarnish the image of the founders of our great school. But in the end, history repeats itself, regardless of how much you try to bury the truth.”
“You never know who might be listening.” Draco let out a quick chuckle.
THANKS FOR READING! See you in like a month? Hahaha, I'll try to make it shorter. But... Read the second note at the beginning.
Harry understood why. It took almost an entire semester to be in a position where he could casually have a conversation with Draco, he couldn’t imagine how it would be with his mother. But they didn’t have another semester to spare. By the end of next term Lucius would be an active member of the Deatheaters and Voldemort would be back. He would rather have Narcissa and Draco out of there before the whispers became too loud.
Draco shook his head, turning his body to look at Harry but not looking at Harry, but at the ground, “I needed that. I needed… I guess a rude awakening. I’d rather anyone else would’ve told me, but… “ Draco nodded.
Harry shook his head, one step forward, “That last thing I want is for you to get hurt. I’m trying to prevent that.” Draco’s left hand softly landed on his chest, feeling like a caress but really it was his new attempt at keeping Harry a fair distance away.
“So?”
Their stare continue until Malfoy’s smile dropped, fear replacing it as he turned to look at Dumbledore who was now staring at him dumbfounded. Harry turned to Hermione confused only to find her staring at him in horror, along with Ron. The rest of the school had a mixture of anger and confusion.
But here he was, in front of the Grand hall waiting for Professor McGonagall to call them in for sorting, and this Draco Malfoy prat was quickly making himself an enemy. As soon as he heard the name, “My name is Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”, Harry felt chills down his back as he knew he’d found one of his wrist prophecies. At only eleven.
Ron looked confused, switching between both his friends, “She knew what?”
After asserting his dominance and intimidating all the students he asked if any knew about some unforgivable curses, to which immediately, Hermione raised her arm.
Both Harry and Hermione turned to him incredulous.
“Get the ingredients.”
Hope you enjoy months of stress.
Ron shook his head, “Do you know anything about it?”
Draco looked away, “It's like.. A premonition. It's like you're asking to die. Don’t say that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s always a tone of unfinished sentences whenever you talk about him, about getting me out of there…” Harry blinked, unaware at how good at perceiving secrets Draco was, “Like you know more than you’re letting on.”
Tom Riddle was his enemy.
These people were toxic. Lucius was a threat to the wellbeing of Draco. Riddle was a threat to everybody. And Harry was destined to end that. Soul markings; one hell of a curse…
And all he said were five words.
“Are you finally going to kill me? Make it quick, and please leave my body in a flattering position.”
Again, Draco seemed impressed with the edge of a smirk, “And then you got the egg with that damn maneuver… The Slytherins think is wrong that you got first place when you cheated, clearly. Only wands.”
“Good evening, sir.”
“I already did. More like they offered it to me. I didn’t make me feel any better about fighting something that requires six or more people to subdue.”
“We’re not on a first name basis yet.”
Please share!
Ron nodded, “I’ll try and see if I can convince her to come to Hogsmead. We can explain in person, better than a letter”
“Yes.” Harry nodded, feeling proud to have a response for that as well, “And I also have a blonde who needs a date.”
Hermione shook her head, climbed off the bed and sat next to Ron, “You are new territory that he’s scared to venture to, and his family, however shitty and evil they may be,
Ron and Harry turned to Hermione, exasperated, their face telling her that it should be obvious.
“And?”
Hermione waved that fact away, like it didn’t change her facts, “Senior has disliked you ever since we first met him two years ago, and we all assumed it was because of You-Know-Who and how you brought their demise, but!” She paused for the drama, watching as Harry and Ron became anxious in wait, “Do you remember everything about that meeting?”
Draco nodded, absentmindedly, “Or where you talk about your secrets.”
And with that white lie, Harry let them drag him away.
After coming back and getting dressed, whenever Harry tried to leave the room Ron would somehow come up with something Harry needed to check or confirm or anything just to keep him there until everyone left. And once everyone left Hermione pushed the curtain away and smirked at Harry, having had enough time to contemplate what may have happened. “So what did you and Malfoy talk about?”
Returning to the castle the Gryffindors forgave him, due to his win, Harry’s not stupid. He had the fastest time and an original method, landing him in the first place, and the Gryffindors had to rub it all over everyone’s faces. After opening the egg, freaking out with everyone about the noise, and joking with Hermione and Ron for a few minutes about it giving him nightmare fuel, while Ron agreed, Harry left. He needed silence.
“Who, Birchgrove junior? He hardly knows how to spell his own name.”
“Thank you, but I don’t have any.”
Draco stopped and looked around. “There’s no one here.”
“If it had just gone in, perhaps.”
“Likely, but who on earth comes looking for items they can’t remember?”
They walked on. Draco felt Potter turn when they passed the Sycamore tree. It was exactly as it had been, leaves still piled around the dormant trunk, and the trees around it had taken on more or less the same appearance.
, but he still gets the word out before Harry has even given the question a chance to breathe. “Yes,” he repeats. “Merlin yes. Harry—“ he makes sure to catch Harry’s gaze before continuing—“yes. Yes.”
Prippa’s chin quavered. She looked down and noticed that she was squeezing the cloak, squeaked, and abruptly burst into hysterical tears. “Mistress is saying Master can take Prippa away from Mistress! Prippa does not want to leave her Mistress!”
If there was anything Harry knew how to do, it was this.
Draco folded his hands in his lap without answering.
“No.”
And then he clapped his hand on my arm and as he laughed it slid downwards. I don’t think he meant it to.
Potter shook his head, pressed his lips together, and looked away.
“That I already have informants in your department.”
“I’m not surprised. I asked Lobsey to send this one a letter and he was free to meet.” Potter shrugged. “I don’t really know how to pick. I liked him well enough.”
“That is one thing—on a very short list, I might add—of things I’ve never been accused of.”
“Kipper and Cream. Very creative.”
“A right and on to the foyer.”
Potter (with Granger’s help. Is he even literate?) would turn his big announcement into a sanctimonious lecture on the importance of, of all things, love. He can’t even advertise for a fuck without giving a lecture on the importance of Hufflepuffian tenderness.
Malfoy’s face told a million stories at once. Neither of them said any of them aloud, but Harry thought they might be thinking of the same ones.
“Not if you’re saving them for Harry, thanks.”
“Scotland Yard requisitions things like this all the time. Could’ve got a look at their safety deposit boxes that way too. You can’t seriously tell me that the Ministry doesn’t still have a relationship with them.”
Which, fuck. He’s leaving lines in the rug. Draco will know he’s been pacing. Standing here like a terrible fool, walking back and forth and waiting. He draws his wand and tries to think of a spell to smooth carpet. Or maybe he could just lie down and roll over it? Make big lines, rather than pacing lines? But then he’d get lint all over himself, but there is a spell for that. Scourgify, in fact. Which is not his area of expertise, so much as it’s –
“Want to. I want to.” Draco blinked to clear his head. “I want you.”
Draco is at a loss for words. Potter’s joke is technically at his expense, but it’s not unkind. “Yes, well,” he clears his throat. “Come in.”
“I know.”
Draco hummed in recognition, but wasn’t dissuaded until Harry pulled harder and rasped his name. “Draco, I’m gonna…” he trailed off with a gasp. It was followed by an outraged sigh as Draco pulled off.
“Is that what they’re calling it nowadays?”
Potter’s mouth snaps shut.
Potter is standing just inside the door with a sheepish smile, hands stuffed in his pockets. He looks…well. He looks perfectly acceptable. He’s wearing jeans again, of course. But he’s put an Oxford on under his jumper and – Draco does not let the surprise show on his face – they match, a light blue collar sitting over brown wool. And he’s abandoned the motorcycle boots in favour of one of the many pairs of brogues they’d retrieved together. Brogues that match his jumper
I speed up, pulling half out of him and pushing in again. The muscle of his rectum is unbelievably soft, and firm, and it feels too good for words, this.
“Oh, Merlin.”
“Your feet are wet, your socks are revolting, and you seem determined to keep carrying the perfectly functional pair you’re already holding.”
Harry hums, looks to Draco’s prick, licks his lips.
“I do, yes.”
“What?”
“Draco.” Potter sighs. “I’m asking. Are you sorry you left?”
“I can’t answer that for you, if you’re actually asking.”
“When you were trying to keep it in. Just like last time. I mentioned Hippogriffs, you pretended to be fine, and you took the leaves off a tree. Stop trying to bottle it up and it stops exploding. It’s not Arithmancy.”
“Yes?”
Potter, on the other hand, shuffled backwards towards the door. “Perhaps I should return to the library?”
He braces an arm to either side of Harry. “Ready?”
By the fourth afternoon he had come to expect that Harry would be waiting for him, but not to find him sitting on the floor across from Greg, who was dangling a piece of string over the kittens.
I knew I’d found it when he sank down further, taking my finger in to the base and issuing a groan that left me even closer to incoherence. His stomach shook and he canted his hips for more.
I lick down to suck his balls into my mouth. They’re high and tight and I can’t imagine we’re far off now.
That’s it, then. Secret’s out, or will be soon.
Harry turned the pamphlet over. There were summaries on the back.
Draco raised an eyebrow, though he didn’t look over at them. “Yes, but what for?”
Draco’s voice is a rough growl. “What do you want?”
“Er, yeah.” Harry bit his lip nervously. “I had to… There were reasons.”
This time he catches my eye as he moves. He brings his hands to the untucked hem of my shirt. He doesn’t look away as he unbuttons it. Not when he fumbles. Not when I gasp, reflexively, when his knuckles brush my chest. Not when he pushes it off my shoulders and runs his hands down my arms. His fingertips are deliciously calloused, his hands perfectly firm. He doesn’t stop until his fingers are linked in mine. “If we’re doing this, it’s together.”
“Much like the Doxy, it’s in the details.”
Once, in the middle of a case, a suspect had aimed a
Potter tries to peer over it. Draco is thoroughly satisfied that the mop of his hair barely pokes over the top. “Malfoy?”
It felt more like walking to his death than Apparating to dinner, and Harry figured he was one of very few people who could make the comparison with authority. The major difference seemed to be that no one had expected him to bring a nice bottle of wine to death.
“Oh. Well, that’s a nice idea.”
“Any tingling or numbness?”
Malfoy leaned back in his chair and raised an eyebrow. Harry wasn’t sure he was going to ask the question. Wasn’t sure he even needed to anymore, that it hadn’t just become an understanding between them. Malfoy still asked. “Shall we?”
“Pansy?” Draco sighed. “Do shut up.”
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” Potter mumbled, rolling the hem of his jumper between thumb and forefinger.
“It’s true. They’re aware of their magic in different ways, of how it sits in their bodies, of what it will and won’t do. They have to become attentive to their limits and abilities. They develop a different relationship with their magic and many of them become less dependent on a wand to conduct it. There’s been some interest in developing the implants for wandless magic, and it might work, even, but it’s only one part of the equation.”
“Then I’m afraid I’m not clear as to the purpose of your visit.”
“I don’t read much,” Potter said.
“Fine. Does it change your recommended treatment protocol?”
“As we do at least thrice weekly without any meaningful objection,” Blaise muses.
“They’re closed,” Harry pointed out.
“Fine,” Harry repeats, sitting back on his heels with a frown.
“I’ve been asked to recommend L’Arpège, if that suits?” She raised an eyebrow.
It’s a rather long list, he’s realised. But that’s not really what she’s asking, or anything she doesn’t already know.
the direction you want to move in.”
“Of course,” Draco replies, infusing his voice with the sort of false warmth best mastered at the skirts of Narcissa Malfoy. He steps forward and raises a hand to cup Potter’s cheek. “Your kindness is legendary for good reason.”
Malfoy rounded the desk, close enough Harry could've touched the fabric of his trousers with an outstretched finger. "Why do you ask?"
“Right, of course.” Potter frowns. “You’re sure we can do that all in a day? It sounds like a lot.”
“Because he won’t even
“No,” Harry admitted. “The least bit amused, though, if that counts for anything.”
“You keep saying that…”
“Do they train you in evasion, or did you pick that up on your own?”
"Oh?" Draco feels the hint of a smile coming on. "Do tell."
He grabbed his wand from the night stand drawer and his dressing gown from a chair, stuffing the former into the sleeve of the latter before crossing the room to crouch on the hearth.
“I don’t know.” Harry felt frustration building, felt as though he needed another moment, or needed to leave. To run until this was all a distant memory. “He’s an Unspeakable, who knows what sort of information they get? Plus…” He trailed off. He thought ‘
He leapt to his feet, came to me, gripped my arm, woeful, apologetic. “I needed to get you out. We couldn’t—you shouldn’t go to Azkaban for this. Not when what you’re saying—”
“Okay?” he asked.
Draco shrugged. “Well, then, for what it’s worth.”
He’d bought pieces of canvas in the Muggle world and insisted we lay them out and surround ourselves with every colour we had to hand. He wanted something grand, unmissable. That Harry can’t draw worth two sickles was a minor complication, made major by his absolute inability to sit still. We agreed that he could trace; my lines first, in charcoal, quick and sketchy, his slower and more lasting.
They were down the stairs and into the field before Potter spoke again. “If you actually believe in your crackpot theory, I can’t see why you’d think it was a good idea to hand me a wand when I’m so clearly brassed off.”
“You said nothing? Nothing about Granger? No comment whatsoever?”
Harry nodded slowly. He picked up his fork, then put it down again. “Is that really how you felt? Truly? That morning when you were leaving?”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees. “Unless—is there a better way to?”
Harry paused before he nodded. “Yeah. We can begin.”
“It’s fine.” He sticks a hand into the pile, now, perversely, half hoping he’ll come up with Marcel’s pants just for a change of subject. He comes up with a weakly fluttering Snitch instead.
“For what it’s worth, I’m arranging the schedule so I’m the assistant travelling with him.”
“There’s really no need.”
“Good,” Draco breathes. “Good. Now pull them down. No—with your pants. Stop.”
Potter steps in front of him. “Nothing to go on, except for being fucking tailed at every public event from the minute you took over the paper. Your father goes off to France and all of a sudden, every trip I make to Diagon Alley is front page news, the
Draco nodded his acknowledgement and crossed the room to take his seat. He waited until Potter had, albeit reluctantly, dropped into the chair across from him. “First, I’d like to apologise for my brusqueness yesterday. It was a regrettable lapse in professionalism and unbefitting either a clinician or a patient.”
“Bend…?” Potter blinked.
“I’ll be back to visit, as I said, and will do whatever’s necessary to keep the Ministry at a distance.” Draco squeezed the stems again and felt something crack. In his lap, nestled on top of the morning glory, the roses had turned to ice.
“They all just sort of… agreed to it. Croaker decided it would be easy, and suddenly we had more time.”
Harry laughed. “If you don’t start to believe me in the next thirty seconds…”
Draco crossed his arms and leaned back in his seat. The tasting menu sounded perfectly fine. More than. And he wanted to hear it. But letting Harry know that…
Pansy didn’t smile at all. “Will it be another decade, then?”
“All the ‘honourable’s and ‘noble’s?”
Potter shook his head. “It’s not that easy for me.”
“Not this room?”
“You, however, are never without a wand, and an exceptionally powerful and temperamental wand at that. Granger and Croaker thought it would act like an implant. They were wrong. It’s a wand, and it acts like a wand. Implanted in your body, it responds to magical stimuli beyond those you consciously intend to project. But I don’t believe it’s malfunctioning.”
There’s too much for Draco too absorb. Muscle memory takes over, and he closes his fingers around the handle, only to jerk them away again as soon as he realises what he’s holding. It clatters to the floor.
“Uh, Malfoy?” He pulled his head up an inch or two, though was still steadfastly focused on his own forearm.
“Oh.” Harry frowns. “I can move.”
“You—” Draco has the difficult task of stopping a huff already in progress as he realises they’re coming within range of attentive ears. “Of course,” he finishes smoothly, plastering a smile over the distinct urge to throttle Potter, room full of Aurors be damned. “How very thoughtful of you.”
Dean rested a hand on her arm. “Luna, do you really think…?”
The art wasn’t much better. In one room, canvases with big blocks of colour. In another, a geometric mishmash that he could make neither heads nor tails of, except to say that it came off as vaguely aggressive. In another, a collection of bulbous sculptures that left him feeling unsure as to whether he was meant to be relaxed or afraid. In another, pictures of a man covered in black latex crawling across a bench with a whip in his mouth, then lying across the rough-hewn plank languorously, and Harry was on to the next room before he could feel anything he’d quite like to avoid feeling while sharing a building with Malfoy.
“Yes?” Blood rushes through his ears.
“Do they still have their taste?”
“Out with it.”
Draco blinked twice, a smile beginning to tug at the corners of his mouth.
He knew he couldn't do anything about the heat he felt creeping over his cheeks, but Harry tried desperately to relax his jaw.
“No?”
Your mum thought you’d probably want to know what happened when you woke up. There’ll be the reports and things, but she thought I should tell you too. I think maybe she just wants to know, but I don’t know what you’d want me to tell her or if there are things that would get you in trouble, so I just told her I’d write it down.
coming at
Draco folds his arms, resting his glass on his elbow. Harry doesn’t know how he manages to be so frustrating and so elegant at the same time. “I read.”
“More?”
“Does if you try it,” Potter mumbles, dropping his free hand to younger Draco’s trousers.
It makes no sense that Malfoy should be so calm when Harry’s stomach is tied in knots. Strange that he should know so much about the shoes and nothing about what they might mean. “This says they’re a size ten.”
It was Harry's turn to raise an eyebrow, more out of habit than scepticism. Something in him throbbed at that, and he settled the leather back onto his shoulders.
They sat, in a silence that would have been comfortable under other circumstances, for several long minutes before Blaise sighed and spoke. “It would, you realise, be terribly inconvenient for you to get tarred in the press all over again, or, worse yet, carted off by the DMLE for tampering with their beloved poster Auror. We’d have to change our entire drinks rotation, and Pansy’s only got the Ogden’s 18-year at the moment.”
When they stepped onto the Rue Lagrange, Harry spoke again. “What did you mean, about it being a different country? How so?”
This client has given up on the bell and turned to study the wall, so it’s his back Draco sees first. His back and his hair, shaggy shocks of black stuck up every which way on top of a compact frame. All of it is dreadfully familiar. He’s only got a split second to gather his wits before the man turns to reveal green eyes and wire-rim spectacles and a stupid, shocked expression that rekindles every ounce of loathing Draco has ever harboured for him.
“Draco.” She reached out a hand and rested it on his arm. “Come on. I know you’re giving this everything, and I know you’d hate to be pre-empted before you find a solution, but…” she trailed off with a half-shrug and a resigned look.
“You can’t tell me that the old portrait of Walburga Black has you convinced that art is meant to be pretty and historical.”
He didn’t close the door.
“That’s not…” Harry pauses, runs his fingers through his hair. He keeps his eyes pinned on the toes of his boots. “I’m not really.” He pauses, pulls at the hem of his sleeve. Draco’s not sure why he’s suddenly so uncertain, but he continues to stumble through his words. “It’s an option, if you want. That’s all.”
“Whoever said you were in your right mind? Baiting Hippogriffs? Not a testament to sanity.”
“Do you think I would’ve reacted badly? Don’t you think it would’ve been helpful to know?”
“This photograph, the one that’s caused all the ruckus.”
Malfoy’s grip tightened and he began to plunge himself into Harry’s mouth with increased vigor.
He raises an eyebrow. “Gobstones?”
“In every conceivable way.”
Silence echoes between them. Draco’s eyes are still trained on the door. Harry’s trying not to look at him, at least not directly, though he knows Draco’s not moving. Not that he is either. Though he has his trusty “feeling like an idiot” excuse and not much of a clue as to Draco’s motivations.
“Can too.” He took Potter’s fingers between his own.
He knelt over Potter and held there, for a moment. Potter’s body emanated heat and Draco longed to press himself against it. He gave in for a moment, lowering himself to kiss Potter, to rub himself against Potter’s hips. He wasn’t expecting Potter’s hands to come up to his back and hold him there, wasn’t expecting Potter to roll his hips in encouragement, or to speed up when Draco moaned. He couldn’t help moaning; it was bliss, being pressed against Potter like this.
“You've been manhandling me for ten minutes, Potter, of course I got hard.”
“All right,” he says, abruptly, turning to face Potter. “One more time, and then we go back to bed. C'mon, off with your pants.”
“I bet,” said Harry, whose enormous breakfast was making it harder than usual to bend down. “Ok, let's get you out of your trousers. Merlin, Malfoy, I can't believe we're going to do this.”
“All right, all right, he's not dead, I'm sure he – Harry, are you still with us?”
“Then what... whoa, look at your stomach! It's changed shape completely. Does it mean that that stuff came from... ?”
“It's easy –
“I’m fine,” he snaps, answering a question Draco hadn’t had any intention of asking. He’s looking slightly bloated, Draco notices, his shirt tight over the small swell of his midsection.
“Deal,” he says, kneeling between Draco's splayed legs to examine his naked, torpedo-shaped stomach. “Worth it, honestly. How does it feel?”
Malfoy blanched.
That night, at dinner, Harry felt ravenously hungry.
“What, Potter?”
to push.”
“Didn't I tell you I was a virgin, you twit?” he said, his pale hand resting on top of his grotesquely swollen stomach. “I didn't fuck Zabini in front of the fire – I sucked him off. ”
said Harry.
“Like hell we should,” says Draco, gingerly getting to his feet. The movement triggers a shift inside his stomach, a pocket of gas painfully distending his rectum. He bears down, hoping for a silent fart to discreetly alleviate his discomfort, and then something truly bizarre happens.
– for you to talk, Potter,” said Malfoy, glaring at Harry through narrowed eyes. His flushed face looked very handsome by the flickering green-greyish light of the fire. Harry felt a powerful wave of desire wash over him.
Malfoy shook his head.
“I really don't think this is a good idea,” said Malfoy, weakly.
“You look full-term,” says Potter, gazing in fascination at Draco's flattened bellybutton.
to be a solution, a counter-spell, anything to stop whatever is expanding inside them before they both…
He nods, not caring about the admission in the slightest. “More,” he croaks.
“Good morning,” Draco replied from just inside the doorway.
Potter turned to the wall, incredulous. “Those? The faces with the window at the end?”
“Thank you,” he said.
Luna handed him a glass of wine and turned to face the room. “It seems as though we’ve all been a bit evasive, and it might be best to clear the air whilst we’re all in one place. Shall we?”
“Work breaks are not an appropriate venue either.”
going to break the Statute of Secrecy? To help Muggles? Let me guess, you also lead a double life as a Hippogriff.”
“A very wise man once told me that it is our choices that make us who we truly are.” A witch in the third row sniffled. “That same man showed me, time and again, how much our choices matter.
“The security charms make it impossible. Nothing corporeal in or out.”
“You—” He blinked, stunned. “No. You can’t.”
“Then why won’t you go outside?”
“No.”
“Draco,” Harry repeated. “Why do you call him Draco?”
“I’m sorry you—”
“We don’t expect catching the murderer will resolve petty crime, but it’s a fair sight better than a serial killer who mutilates his victims.”
Harry looked at him. Looked at the one single, real version of Malfoy, standing across a fresh green lawn off a staircase in a gallery in a building in Central London, with his one sharp jaw and his one pair of stormy grey eyes and his one pale brow knit together in thought. Malfoy had already answered. The question was whether Harry could believe him.
He leaned back and folded his napkin neatly in his seat. “Take a moment, Potter. Consider your options. I’ll give you until the cheque comes.”
“Merlin,” Harry mumbled.
There was only one thing he could have done to surprise me. Of course, that's exactly what he did.
“From any sane person, more like. But there you go. Shall we sit?”
“Oh.” Harry could feel Draco’s shoulders tighten under his arms. “I want you.”
"About—" Harry faltered and cursed his own rashness. He might've effectively cornered himself, but he wouldn't be the first to say it, and he racked his brain for an alternative. "You want me to leave about as much as I want to go."
To his relief, Harry laughed. “Doing that well, am I?”
“Of course I have. The portraits are all a-twitter about the two handsome young gentlemen in my bathroom. And Harry, how you’ve grown!” She squealed and dove through the floor, popping up again behind Draco. “You didn’t even try to kill each other. Though,” she flitted her eyelashes at Harry, “you’re still welcome to share my toilet.”
Robards leaves them standing in front of the door, Harry with his heart in his throat and Phillips behind him.
“So, if we’d just sent you a lot of Howlers, then?”
Potter stood abruptly. “Whatever. Let’s just get this over with.”
reports well enough.”
“It’s fine,” Draco said. “You don’t have to go. You shouldn’t, on my account. That was insensitive of me, and rude. I’m sorry.”
“You don’t know anything about me.”
Potter jumped and rushed to examine it. “Damnit. I’m really sorry Malfoy. Dr Malfoy. This—I’m too unpredictable, I—”
The elf appeared with such a sudden pop that Sydney jumped. Draco hid a smirk. “Galder, would you please show our guest to the Floo or foyer, as he prefers?”
He thought it should have felt like more of a success. He’d sold Muggle works to wizards, to society wizards, to wizards on the Wizengamot, to wizards who ran the most elite wizarding social circuits. Some of the same wizards who had been complicit in or right out in favour of Voldemort’s mission. It had gone well. He knew, intellectually, that Pansy and Blaise were right. It had been worth the risk. It was worth all of the effort that had gone into it.
“Of course they are. Estella’s been raised to prize status above all else. She can never reciprocate his affection.”
“Just a bit tired.”
“What was that?”
All of which would’ve been quite pleasant if I hadn’t had more pressing matters to attend to.
Draco was, once again, left perplexed by Potter’s acquiescence, especially to something he clearly didn’t relish the idea of. But Draco did need to know how Potter’s magic would behave when he tried to use it, and he was holding out Potter’s wand by the time Potter reached him. “Something simple is fine. A warming charm, Lumos, whatever you prefer.”
“Does it matter?”
This is impossible.
“Please.” Harry dropped to the floor and crossed his legs as Draco levitated them onto the settee and put up a shield.
“Your feet must be cold.”
“It’s my stuff, isn’t it? Even the stuff I don’t know about yet. I told you that might happen. And there’s probably more new stuff than you think, that you won’t know about straight away. So I could be helpful with that.”
Draco gave a heavy sigh. “About what?”
They crossed the path, approaching the doors.
And then he thinks about courage, and what that would mean, and whether it’s anything he’s capable of.
“It’s the most fundamental part of our world. To not be able to go to the shops or visit your friends. To never step foot on a Quidditch pitch or in a wizarding shop. Imagine giving all of that up. It would fundamentally change your whole life, your very identity. It did, before the implants. If you’d seen what I’d seen, seen what it meant to people to get that back, you wouldn’t think twice about it either.”
Done, Sydney collapsed against his thigh. Draco ran a hand through his hair, encouraging him to stay there until Draco could figure out what he had seen.
Once, when he was on the edge of a panic attack, Luna had told Harry to try pressing his tongue to the roof of his mouth, with the tip just above his two front teeth and the top tucked up against the ridges, and breathing in for four, holding for four, and exhaling for four. It usually worked. It was sort of working. It was working at least insofar as he was pretty sure Malfoy couldn’t tell what he was doing, and he felt a bit less like climbing the walls, and a bit less like screaming. He supposed that counted as working.
“If you’d rather.”
He lets himself collapse half on top of Harry, one arm spread across the bed, the other curled over Harry’s chest and into his hair. He can hear Harry’s heartbeat. It’s as fast as his, pounding through Harry’s sternum.
—” Harry wiggled his arse backwards, still trying to direct Malfoy’s half-buried hand, “—of your master?” The snake on the box had stopped moving. “Mister snake, I seek your contents.”
“That you want to…” Potter trailed off. He looked unmoored in a way that Draco couldn’t place.
"Excellent! Now, what shall we say? You need money? 500 Galleons in short order?" Lee offered.
Draco held up his apple and shook his head.
“Right.” Potter sighed. “You held me hostage and dangled me over a pit of hungry Nundus until I promised my firstborn.”
“Your mum?”
Draco picked it up and studied it. There was something distinctly familiar about it, though there shouldn’t have been, he thought. They weren’t all flowers Harry had already produced, the laurels were an odd touch. He turned it in front of him and it struck him. He lowered the bouquet to peer at Harry over it. “You made it in your bloody house colours.”
