The font was in black calligraphy and it read, “
“Hmm...so you were never friends.” Frida was looking off to a spot on the wall, deep in thought.
“Uh, thank you. Yes, I should go.”
.” The windows on both sides of the entrance door were long and narrow, and Harry could see the candlelights from inside the shop flickering against the glass; illuminating the darkness of the streets.
“But why? Just out of nowhere like this?” “No, I've been thinking about it for a while now,” Harry lied. “I was going to do it earlier this week, actually, but then Malfoy needed my help, so I decided that he'd be my last patient here.” “Wow....I didn't know, Harry. Well, I'll miss you, mate. Hope you visit us sometime.” “I will,” Harry smiled genuinely. He didn't think he'd ever step inside the hospital again though.
“Another finger.”
The man sighed impatiently. “I don't like talking.”
“Thanks. Where do you live?”
Harry nodded. “I am, yeah. I also need the loo.”
He walked downstairs wearing Harry’s clothes. Grey cotton trousers loosely hugging his hips and a blue knitted jumper sagging around his shoulders. But the pants and socks fit just right. He hadn’t felt this pampered in a very long time. Potter’s clothes felt brand new on his body.
It was time to go home. To leave behind the chaos of his mind and remember the peacefulness of the lonely night. As he walked away, a sharp sound, like a cloud blowing a whistle, made him turn his head around. There was a silver dragon, flying softly like a shadow between the stars, brightening the darkness with its powerful light. It was the most beautiful patronus that Harry had ever seen. The detailed scales of its skin, bellowing wings, and large eyes mesmerized him and he couldn’t stop staring until it slowly dissolved into the atmosphere. He continued to feel its magic long after it had left.
“Yes, I think so. But the less I think about it the better.”
“Draco, I. You can't leave your family. You're their only child and....I....I want to be with you but...”
“Liar.”
on the paper label, then turned to Draco.
Draco froze. “Oh…..I see. I don’t see the point, though that’s very nice of you. We’d just pretend nothing happened and forget all about it the very next day, I’m sure.”
“I’m not going to tell him. The baby is mine, I’ll do the raising myself. I’ll have to start buying furniture and clothes and all that…” Draco turned around in his chair, facing Frida directly.
The man enveloped his giant hand on Draco's crotch, cutting off his words along with his dignity.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Draco whispered. “I’m sorry. I was scared. I didn’t know how you felt about me. I’m sorry.”
“Draco?”
Harry positioned himself behind him, putting a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Malfoy's bare feet and felt the blood rush to his groin again. His nails were trimmed very short and his toes were long with knobby knuckles. They were elegant yet masculine and moved on the floor with careful determination. Harry let him go completely.
“Before he attacked me, he grabbed me inappropriately and called me a freak,” he said quickly and quietly. He saw Potter visibly swallow at this. “Did he do anything else?” Harry asked cautiously.
“But that’s not right. It’s not fair.”
“Drakon! Ver are you? Vaso is here!” A tall, striking woman in her sixties appeared in the corridor. A younger man with curly brown hair was standing next to her.
“Oh...no. Sorry. I was just thinking,” Harry put his glass down, starting to feel a bit drunk. “Surprised you’re not at your manor anymore. Thought maybe that’s something your parents would leave to you eventually.”
shimmered on the shop sign as if newly added, and included an aged giant metal ribbon with cut triangle edges flowing elegantly. It was obvious there wasn’t any intention of destroying the former history of the place, but rather working with it to create something new. Right below the dark silver letters were smaller ones that read: “
“My lad.” Frida brought the towel up to his forehead. “I can’t do much else. If I could embrace you, I would. But my body is not warm nor firm. Stay home tomorrow, I’ll take care of the shop.”
“Yes….yes. We just need to finish up a few things. We hope you’ll come back tomorrow. So sorry.” She quickly went back inside the room, concerned for Draco.
“No, lad! Go now! Forget the store for a moment, I will handle it. I promise you if I need something, I will ask you immediately. Don’t you worry.” She smiled confidently at him and floated through the door.
Submerged almost completely inside the hot foamy water, Draco had his head rested on its side, using his right arm as a pillow, with his eyes closed. He had changed the water three times already; making sure all the dirt, bad smells, and dreadful memories were washed off of him. His hand swept across the back of his head, and he remembered the tangled mess of his hair. It felt like steel wool against the sensitivity of his wrinkled fingers. Draco decided he didn’t care. He wasn’t trying to attract a mate or anything - he only wanted to get cleaned. He was awakened from his slumber by the soft knocking on the door.
“You were found at the emergency entrance behind the hospital. You were cut in fourteen different places all over your upper legs and lower torso in what was likely the Diffindo spell. You were bleeding very heavily and could've died. Another healer and I had to take off your clothes to mend the cuts, stop the bleeding, and check for all other damages.”
Ron stopped chewing, the food trapped inside his cheek.
“I look like a giant prune. Don’t get scared.”
Draco held the rim of the bin with both hands as more liquid came out of him, the smell acidic and foul. Having to smell his own vomit was making the whole situation worse.
“Potter,” he mumbled, barely audible.
He was happy to see that Draco was still sitting down in the same position. “Can I give you a foot massage?” He couldn't believe he was saying this, but he remembered the words of the old wizard.
After some time had passed, Draco was still absent. Harry told himself to wait just a bit longer. There were more people now walking into the shop. He kept hearing the front door bell frequently. He heard a particularly loud man talking a few feet away from him.
Draco looked genuinely surprised. “What's this?!”
Harry got closer to the display in order to read the names on the beautifully crafted bottles. At the very top of every label was the logo “
“The wizard he was with...at your ball. Does he want to come here? Has he been told?”
“Oh fuck, Merlin!” Harry moaned. “Your mouth feels amazing. I'll come too soon.”
“No it’s fine! I mean...take as long as you’d like. I don’t mind. Is there anything else you need?”
As Frida and Potter were finishing up, Draco went behind the register and took out his old flannel. He dabbed it with some cleaning oil and started to polish the wooden counter.
Vasilia checked his vitals and put some fluids from a vial inside his mouth. She told Harry it would hydrate him. She also wet a flannel with cold water and laid it against Draco’s forehead.
Draco was yawning and rubbing his eyes. “In the bathroom, the cabinet by the sink.”
“She was killed during the start of the war.” Harry turned his face around, clutching the bottle in his hand.
“Did I say something wrong?” Draco took to his drink as well, feeling drowsier moment by moment.
"There are a few places in Diagon Alley where I noticed them. I never did before, and….I don’t know why I didn’t….but anyway. I can bring more if you like them.” He gave Draco a shy smile.
Summer was coming to an end, and nothing had changed in regards to their relationship. One day, well into the late hours of the night, after
“They’re...um...are you going to use a charm? Maybe I can try with my wand?” He continued to stare at the floor.
His thoughts were interrupted by the ardent voice of a woman behind the cashier’s table as he slightly flinched; the decibel of her voice causing his headache to throb a bit.
He threw the empty bottle on the floor and curled into a foetal position. He felt warm and hot and took deep, long breaths to calm his restless heart.
The wizard looked at him, the pipe hanging from his mouth.
He read the note, over and over again, not being able to decide if it was too much, or not enough. He finally folded it neatly, put it inside an envelope, and sent it out with his owl.
I would've said everything in my heart and in my dreams if I had known that this would be my last time speaking to him.
Frida was closing the store when Draco walked in. “I’m so sorry, Frida-”
“I'll get you something then. Meanwhile, if there's anything else you need, no matter how silly you think it is, there's a buzzer here next to your bed,” Harry said, pointing at a red button on the bedpost. “It will send an alert to my wand, and I won't be far away.”

“Don’t be scared, baby.” Draco couldn't believe what Harry had just called him. He brought his arms over his head, grabbing Harry’s hair. He needed to feel that hair. That wild, free, and untamed hair and the brave man who owned it. He loved Harry so much. He gave another strong push, not stopping, even though it felt like fire was stretching him wide open. He screamed so loud, his vocal cords felt like they just cracked open out of his throat.
The night sky was bright with the full moon as spring slowly made her way into summer. Inside the hearts of those who yearn for a life unleashed in passion and creation, lies a secret which she knows and lovingly fulfills. She shines equally on everyone, but especially those who make wishes upon her light. The jasmines of Diagon Alley twinkled majestically beneath her sight.
Draco looked down to the thick lines. “Nothing. Those scars, I wanted.”
“Ok….” Ron was still looking right at him.
“Down the corridor that way, keep going right.”
“Uh, help yourself. Thought you might be hungry.”
"How are you feeling, Harry?” Peter asked as he wrapped his things in a towel.
“It's for fun. Like you said.” Draco said coyly and forced himself to look back at Potter.
“Oh! No, I use a washing machine. It’s a muggle device. You just throw in the clothes with the detergent and it does the work for you. It does a more thorough job than a cleaning charm, it’s great,” Harry said, reassuringly. Draco looked up, with a half smile. “Thank you. They’re so filthy, as you can imagine-”
“Malfoy, I’ll be right there!” He shouted towards his living room. When he walked in with the platter of food, he saw Draco dusting himself off near the hearth.
Draco sat at his desk, intently keeping his focus on the pages of his notebook. He picked up a quill, a small grey bottle across from him, and continued to write. He heard a soft creaking sound of the door just a few feet away. Frida floated inside the small room, holding her apron over her arm.
“Pa....”
“But your parents, Draco. Your security. Your money.”
Harry read “
“Because that's what you are. What would you like me to put in your papers?”
Draco looked up. “Hello Potter.” He continued to work.
“I’m afraid not, Kheri. Nothing that is safe for the baby. After the birth, yes.”
“Get off me!!” Draco yelled, pulling himself higher onto the mattress as the man's face dropped from pleasure to shock.
“You have an eye for detail and design, Draco.”
“So?” She asked as if having drunken sex was as normal as breathing air.
Harry led Draco into a decently sized bathroom with a tub, sink, toilet, and a large mirror. It would have been a laughing matter to Draco back in the heyday of Malfoy Manor, with its excessive, opulent, and enormous bathrooms on every floor. But now, this was heavenly. All he wanted was a warm bath. He had dreamed about it, yearned for it, on so many cold nights hiding away in the corners of dirty streets. He tried to fight back the tears that he felt gathering around his eyes. Harry was looking through a cabinet under the sink.
“Yes.”
“This one's safe for the eye area,” Harry softly told him.
“Harry,” Draco whispered with watery eyes. “I'll be leaving soon, won't I?”
“Ron...it wasn’t just because he’s a bloke. I wanted him. And that scares the shit out of me.”
“What’s wrong with your stomach?”
“No, don't.” Draco stopped him. “I don't want anyone to know.”
Harry didn’t say anything.
Bastard. How dare he?
“Yes, it normally is. But he said he had an emergency and really had to leave. I checked him over, and though he was still walking very slowly, he was able to apparate. I didn't want to force him to stay, Potter, he was very distraught. You were sleeping in the quarters and I didn't want to bother you, either. I checked over his file and read all your notes. My judgment was also largely based on what you had written.”
Draco brought a hand to Harry’s cheeks, wiping away the wetness.
“Vasilia? Is that you?” He heard Draco’s anguished voice.
Draco raised his brows. “What made you decide to work there?”
“Draco?”
Harry was packing the potion bottles and salves inside his case when Modley stepped in his office. “I'm going to take Miss Malfoy upstairs, Harry.”
“You sure do think highly of me, Potter,” Draco said, his voice low and raspy.
I don’t even know where to start, I don’t know her surname. I guess I could just search for ‘Vasilia’ section by section.” Draco sounded irritated and exhausted.
“Looks clean, Malfoy,” he softly muttered. Draco looked up, only moving his eyes. He kept his body frozen and held tightly onto the rag.
anything to do with the savages responsible for this?!”
“You have a wonderful time, dear! I’ll see you tomorrow then!” Frida had a huge smile on her face and Draco was finally able to smile as well.
“You’ll never regret doing everything you could have when you look back at it. You will, however, regret doing less than you could have.” He turned to Harry. “What have you really got to lose?” The man started to clean out his pipe against the ground, then stood up, straightening his cloak. Harry stood as well. “Nice talking to you, young man. Good luck.”
“Northern Ireland. If you don’t see me ever again, it means I’ve found what I’ve been looking for. If you do see me, please interrupt my thoughts. There shouldn’t be any secrets kept in this world. It doesn’t do anyone any good. Good night!”
“Fuck Malfoy, you look so hot right now. I want to make you come so bad.” Harry made his way onto Draco as Draco released his knees, resting on top of him. He grabbed Draco’s face with both hands.
He was sitting up and looking down when Potter came back inside. He had light pink scars all over his thighs and lower stomach.
“I felt so weak...like they’re just headaches, you know? Why couldn’t I deal with it?”
“Mmmhmmmmm…..ahhhhhhhhh!!” He stood up on his knees and Harry went in front of him, holding his hands tightly. “Harry…..I’m so tired. I can’t do this. I can’t do this.” Tears ran down Draco’s face. “Take the baby…..if I don’t make it, take the baby. Please. Tell everyone it’s yours.” Harry’s heart was silently breaking to hear these words.
Frida joined Draco in the back room after they had closed.
“Why do I keep getting told this-”
“Go tonight. And eat something for Merlin’s sake, you’ve lost so much weight.”
“You...I’ve seen you before…”
He still saw Potter as arrogant, stuck-up, and cocky. He couldn't give any examples of course, but it suited him just fine to paint a different picture of Potter than the rest of society. He hated hero-worship.
“You taste amazing. You're so fucking gorgeous.” Harry spread Draco's inner thighs carefully with both hands and worked his tongue inside.
“What did you use for those scars?”
“Please…” Draco was lost for all other words.
“No, just you.” Peter put another cold compress on Draco’s forehead. “He’ll be back soon. I reckon he doesn’t want you to see him cry.”
This was not how he wanted tonight to go. His breast pocket was full of jasmines and he could smell them all the way home.
“Modley, where's Draco?” Modley raised his eyebrows in surprise. “He didn't tell you? He left a few hours ago, it was barely sunrise.”
Draco opened his eyes and grabbed Harry’s hair again. He took a deep breath, as Potter started to enter him. He went excruciatingly slow, stopping constantly, while rubbing Draco’s face. He kissed him, again and again, and pushed a little more in, and a little more. Then, suddenly, Draco felt a sharp pain, and Potter immediately froze.
“No, that’s alright,” Harry composed himself, grinning. “My owl is losing a lot of feathers, more than usual. Anything good for that?”
“POTTER!! Potter, call the Healer!! Please quickly!”
“You’re going to deny it, so I’m not telling you,” she said in a playful manner, continuing to smile.
That moment, Draco walked in, carrying Jasmine in his arms. She was eating a bag of the ‘candy’ version of
“Who I think is a wizard, by the way, no matter what muggles think," Ron muttered.
“Yes?” Harry whispered back.
After half an hour, when the last customers had left the store, Potter was still near the fireplace, squatting near the flames. Frida gave Draco a look of surprise and Draco nodded, acknowledging who she was referring to. She flew to the back room and Draco took out his white flannel to clean some empty bottles. Harry walked up slowly to the counter.
“Where’s Papa?!” Jasmine asked.
“Yes,” Harry gave him a nervous smile. “It smells great. Thought maybe you’d like them, too.”
Draco was still staring at the door.
Draco looked at Potter, incredulously. The alcohol had loosened his tongue, and he reckoned it had done the same to Potter. He didn’t care anymore at this point.
“You feel incredibly warm, Potter.” Harry quickly took off his jacket, throwing it on the floor and gently pushed Draco flat on his back, getting on top of him. He kissed him hard on the lips.
“Here,” he said, turning to face Draco and handing him a large white towel. “Are you alright?”
“So you could technically make more than you’re saying, just not show them your entire batch.”
“Oh my sweet girl!!” Frida shouted excitedly. Jasmine and Frida did a sort of twirling dance, spinning and gesturing together. They mirrored one another’s movements, and Harry smiled warmly at his daughter’s affection for her aunt. Frida couldn’t hug or kiss Jasmine, so they came up with this special type of greeting.
“Hello,” Harry said, as he finished buttoning Draco’s shirt.
“For….not contacting you. Not showing up.”
Draco waited for her to continue, genuinely interested though his tired body betrayed him from expressing it.
Draco was silent for a few moments. He looked away when he answered.
He walked slowly back up the stairs, never glancing back.
“No.”
“None of your business,” Draco replied, smiling back. “Tell me yours first.”
_____________
“My own clothes. Have you heard of 'white coat anxiety?'”
“Thanks Potter. Its a relief knowing I won't be going home naked.”
“Oh. Alright. That's fine,” he commented civilly.
I refuse to leave this room tonight.
“Please sit down Malfoy, just need to grab one more thing.” Harry set the platter down on the coffee table and went back to get the drinks. Draco was wearing the same clothes he was in earlier at the shop. Navy blue trousers which were snug around his hips and thighs, and a white jumper which sat loose around his collarbones. Harry noticed that he had combed his hair a little neater than usual, completely away from his eyes. He had long, dark blond lashes and beautifully arched eyebrows. Harry swallowed thickly as he sat down on the sofa next to him, leaving some space between them.
How many times I had dreams of Draco accompanied with my nightmares. How many times I wanted to send him an owl. How many times I wanted to purposely make friends with his friends just so we can be at one of those stupid balls together; to be in the same damn room. He had beaten me to it. This bloody stupid idiot who didn't deserve him. Because even if Draco was a prat at school, he was never stupid. He was smart, had a soft heart, and didn't continue the hatred he was brought up with.
“I understand,” Draco quickly replied before any of them changed their minds. “We agreed. Less talk, more fucking. But this is important and it's something I tell all my partners.” It was half a lie as Draco hadn't had a sexual partner in a very long time. He'd never admit that to a man like this one.
Draco squeezed his hands very hard. Harry felt like his bones were breaking but he didn’t care.
“You feel incredible, Draco, you have no idea. You're so tight and warm and wet and I'm afraid I'm not going to last long.”
“I don't care. I don't care anymore. I've spent only three days with a load of rich snobs with planks up their arses, and I've realized how much I don't want to continue being part of that world. I'm tired of putting on an act to impress people who don't give two shits about me. I'm only worth anything if I continue my father's business, get married and breed an heir or two. I'm done, Harry. They'll rather see me dead than with another man, and if its not going to be with you, then it'll be someone else, but I WILL NOT go back. I'll leave this ship as a stowaway if I have to.”
“This one has been my guest room of sorts,” he said, leading Draco inside. It had a single bed with an olive green duvet and matching pillows. The windows to the left of it shed light through thin, translucent curtains; creating a dim atmosphere. There were a few pieces of furniture made with the same type of the light wood as the bed. Oak, or pine, Draco figured.
“Draco.”
Draco was in absolute bliss as he felt Potter’s strong, firm hands rub every single one of his toes, the balls of his feet, and his heels. He would miss Potter once he left his side. He knew this. But he was going to enjoy every moment that he could get.
Harry nodded, “I can understand.” He still stood there, looking around as if he was searching for something.
One evening when he was sitting in the living room, reading his book, he was startled by a knock on the door. It was followed by a familiar voice.
Draco looked down, smiling. “Thank you, Potter. This looks delicious, by the way.”
“Huh?” This took Harry out of his thoughts.
Malfoy picked up the paper that Harry had set on the counter.
“No, it will say male. I will be sure of that.”
“Oh I think Diana’s team works with that, don’t they? Potion control?”
“Can I kiss you?” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. Draco nodded, feeling his entire body tremble. He licked his lips, in an attempt to ask Harry not to wait too long. He was afraid of changing his mind.
“I don’t care! We didn’t hear from his parents. What about all the shit his father did to you?”
He set the tea tray and a few chocolate croissants on the table. “You didn’t eat a lot earlier.”
“She’s lovely, very special.” Draco finally looked back at Harry, returning his smile and setting down his drink. Harry instantly felt the absence of Draco’s soft hair that was touching his fingers. He wasn’t sure what was happening to him, but he wanted that back - and more. He moved his hand from the back of the sofa and onto Draco’s shoulder, and squeezed, keeping it there. “Well, I think it’s lovely that she can stay at her old place and keep busy with your shop. You did all that you know, it’s all your creation.”
He scanned the shop and noticed Frida showing some vials to a woman with a baby in the children’s section. Draco wasn’t around. He walked near the fireplace and took out the flowers he had picked, inhaling its perfume and staring into the flames.
Malfoy looked away, putting the clean bottles inside a bronze container.
Harry swallowed in heartbreak and disappointment but feigned indifference when asking, “I didn't release him. He was under my care. Isn't that the rule?”
“Can you…..get…..my pajamas?” Draco spoke through the pain. “There in….under the covers. Of my bed.”
Harry was silent and looked down again, his hands folded together on the table.
“Is there...is there anything he can take? For some relief? Please.” Harry was also desperate.
Ron read quietly. The font was in gold calligraphy with some sort of code at the top, combining numbers and letters.
Harry stretched his hand, waiting to shake Draco's, but Draco didn't look up. That goddaman belt. And those hands. The nails. The knuckles. His legs, which were standing a bit apart, thin, yet muscular. And those toned arms, covered in dark red cloth, hugging his shape.
“Daddy says Skele-Gro tastes like rotten rubbish.”
“I understand.”
“Oh I didn’t realize you were closing,” Harry said with concern.
“My dear, listen to me. You are more than capable of being a wonderful father to your child, but what harm will it do to tell Harry about it? You don’t know how he’ll react. He might even be there for you when you need help, maybe he’ll want the child.”
“The khed is out, Drakon! One more push, and the baby is out.”
“Um...yeah, sure, Potter. Uh...that sounds good.” He reminded himself to breathe and look calm, despite the accelerated speed of his heart.
“The way it works is the Ministry, St. Mungo’s, and potioneers work together to make sure nothing of this sort gets abused. Well, in reality, it starts with the Ministry. They send in DMLE employees to check our inventory and also check how much of it healers are prescribing. If the numbers match up, everything is fine. If they don’t, they’ll further investigate,” Malfoy kept his eyes on Harry the whole time, giving a small smile every now and then.
“Thank you for this.” He walked up to Frida and started to pay for the pellets. Draco watched his movements. Potter’s hair was the same as it had always been: wild, free, and untamed. His hands had shortly trimmed nails and large knuckles; neat and rugged at the same time. His kindness pulled at Draco’s heartstrings, and he was painfully reminded of why he couldn’t stop thinking about this man, even in his exile. Now he was back in his life, and made aware of what he was missing. Lonely and friendless, Frida was all Draco had, and though he was grateful for her, he yearned for a deep connection with a man like Potter. He hated having to face the reality of what he was missing.
Draco thought about this. “It, uh, actually makes sense. I prefer you looking like this.”
A minute later, Draco Malfoy entered with the potions, placing them carefully next to Frida.
“For now.” Draco sat on the rug, knees down, letting Vasilia check on him.
Harry was mesmerized by this encounter with Draco Malfoy. Leaving it behind made him feel strangely empty and somber.
“What is it, do you have a contagious disease?”
“Is it for headaches?”
“Daddy, I want candy!” The energetic little girl with dark curls and silver eyes was pulling her father’s hand towards a sweet shop further down the street.
“Where’s Harry?” He asked, squirming in pain.
“Here, take some for your stomach,” he said, handing Draco a bottle.
“Oh yes, of course! I knew he was familiar! Never did meet him in person, but the Daily Prophet always wrote about him.”
There was hardly anyone in the shop tonight. Draco took this opportunity to finalize some notes on the male conception potion. He worked right at the counter by the register, looking at the clock often. Time seemed to be going slow. They were still several hours away from closing. The sound of the store door bell took him away from his writing abruptly; the quietness of the shop made it sound louder than usual. When he looked up, he saw Harry Potter walking in, gently shutting the door behind him and loosening his thick scarf. Draco shut his notebook, put his quill aside, and grabbed his white flannel.
Draco was sitting up when Peter entered the room. His legs were bent and Vasilia was sitting behind him, squeezing his hands. He had just started to push.
Draco unlocked the door with an
“I guess,” Ron replied, nonchalantly. “Try seeing if he has this potion.” He handed Harry back the prescription. "Seems the type to dabble in rare and controlled substances." It was hard for Ron to hide the slight animosity from his tone. "It's called Eagle Elixirs. It's where Frida's Fabrics and Lace used to be."
“Nah, I don’t care. More money or less money won’t change him if he’s already changed for the better. I hope you’re right and that he has. Meanwhile, get rid of those headaches alright? That’s what I care about more.”
“Nothing. Don’t worry about it.”
He felt sick to his stomach. Draco must've panicked about something. Harry was naïve to think that this was going to be the start of a new relationship. He hated that he would even entertain a conclusion like that. Besides that, there was something else. He had broken a very, very serious ethical code in his field: getting involved with a patient. Having sex with a patient.
“Please don’t tell anyone, Frida. I know you won’t, but I just have to say it. This has to be our secret.”
I hadn't shed a single tear since the first time I spent the night here with him. I remember how dark and clear the sky was, and so full of stars that looked like they were dancing.
After the arduous process of skillfully measuring, crushing, weighing, stirring, and heating that was necessary to perfect his new potion, Draco left the shop to walk upstairs to his flat, situated right on top of his shop. Frida stayed behind as usual, dusting the floating candles to be ready for a new day.
“Sorry, it’s none of my business-”
“Draco, dear. What is it?” Frida carefully asked.
“Yes?” Harry was curious now.
Draco didn't want to see him. Didn't want to face the farce that was Harry Potter. Even if he knew that most of this was to sell papers by exaggerating the reality and hiding any imperfect details.
“Thank you,” he whispered.
“I brought dinner, and more pastries.” Draco took the box from Harry, and gestured to him to come inside.
“What?”
“I can see that. Hang on a sec.” He went to get a jar of
“You're free to go. Next time, don't bother so much about former Death Eaters. I never asked you to risk your job.”
Draco quickly checked the bath water, making sure the foam was thick enough to cover his body. “
“No!” Again, Draco cut him off quickly. “No. Not at all. I'm just...I'm...I'm born...”
An elderly wizard with a long grey beard and a violet pointed hat stepped outside the door just as Harry was about to walk in. The old man gave him a small smile and a quick wink, walking past him with a black paper bag in his hands. Harry realized he had been holding his breath and sighed slowly. He was strangely reminded of Dumbledore. He straightened himself up, patted down his coat with both hands, and walked inside the shop.
As Potter made his way towards the counter, Draco started to aggressively polish the brass money register with the old rag.
“You were pressured, used as a pawn-”
“There it is, found it,” Harry said, smiling through his sweat.
“No,” she answered. “They're not dating anymore. Please don't try contacting him, Draco wouldn’t want him here.”
and a bottle of
“I didn't come here to fight with you, Malfoy.” His tone was equally calm and courteous. Draco wasn't insensitive enough not to catch the slight twinge of sadness either. Potter sounded emotionally exhausted, almost like he'd given up every fight left in him.
“Yes. I want tea. It’s cold. Or a strong drink. Something to warm up with.”
Draco tightened himself around Harry's cock, and Harry groaned loudly in ecstasy. “Fuck....I'm coming....Draco, fuck...”
This put a big smile on Harry’s face. “Thanks, mate,” he said, taking Ron’s hand and patting him on the back.
“Listen Potter, I appreciate your attempt-”
Draco sat down at his desk, his book in front of him. “I’m pregnant, Frida. She confirmed it. I’m almost three months along.”
and a little something to give his godson and felt the need to pay Draco what he owed - no matter how much he was pushed away. He is Potter after all, and Draco knew he was a kind man no matter how much he resented his feelings for him.
Harry wasn’t sure how to say any of it.
“What are you going to name her?” Harry asked, sweeping a strand of hair away from Draco’s face.
“You’re so tight, Draco. Your body feels so good.” He kissed Draco again, then stared into his eyes, waiting for a cue to continue.
Draco had set the table with the boxes of Chinese takeaway from the bag.
“Am I hurting you?” Harry quietly asked.
Draco took a deep breath. “Its fine I can take it.”
After this, Harry visited more frequently. Mostly during the late hours when customers seemed to die down a bit, so he could spend more time talking to Draco. He kept bringing jasmines, purchasing a potion or two, and sometimes just brought the flowers and didn’t buy anything at all.
Harry sighed again. “I’m afraid of that, too.”
“AHHHHHHH….faaaaa,” he shouted loudly in pleasure, digging his fingernails deeper into the sofa’s fabric. He felt the splattering of his cum all over his stomach and chest.
“AHHHHHHHH…….AHHHHHH…….FUUUUUUCK!!!!”
Draco sighed. Both from relief and exhaustion.
“Thank you, you’re a lifesaver.” He looked around. “Is it okay if we talk?”
“I thought you were with Ginny Weasley.”
“Yea...yes?”
“Seven months. I was in France with my parents before that. Exiled for five years.”
“Well, that’s not completely true-”
“Frida, please. He was absent for two whole months, now sporadically comes in with flowers he’s picked on his way over here. I’m not saying he’s unkind, but none of those actions make me special. He still needs potions, obviously, and the jasmines are just….they’re just…” Draco rested his head against his arm, closing his eyes in exhaustion.
Harry looked down, blushing. “I don’t think….it’s not a big deal at all. It’s just common decency. I can be better, I think.”
“Hello Draco,” he said, smiling unsurely.
“Malfoy, I can’t do that. How much?”
Draco’s cheeks reddened. “Thanks to your healer,” he took another sip of his drink.
“Its already locked,” Harry said.
“Say thank you to Ms. Frida, kids.”
Draco looked down. “No.
Pansy sighed. “Yes. But not with the intention to hurt Draco. He admitted to notifying The Prophet about the ball and who was going to be there and with whom."
It was a Tuesday evening and an exceptionally cold day. The air was so frigid, it ate down to the insides of your bones. The icy moisture covered the streets in a sheen, glass-like blanket. Draco was able to just barely make out images through his foggy windows. Frida had lit the fireplace with more flames than usual in one end of the room. The candles burned bright over their heads.
Draco walked about ten feet with Potter's help.
“Mr. Malfoy, what do you think about these? What is the difference?” He looked over straight away when he heard Draco’s name, still trying to be casual and not too obvious. He saw Draco lean closer to the man’s items and say something he couldn’t hear too well. He noticed a thin book under Draco’s arm. Extremely curious to see what kind of book this was, Harry grabbed a potion off the display he was closest to and stepped in line. He was standing perpendicular to the rest of the line but he had a much clearer view from this angle. Some of the letters were blocked by Draco’s hand, but Harry was able to make out the title: “
He saw the empty sofa with the crumbled blanket laying serenely on top of it. He felt his heart sinking down to his toes, keeping him frozen on the spot. He didn’t feel hungry any longer.
Draco slowly stretched as he opened his eyes to the dimly lit room. He heard footsteps coming close toward him and saw the outline of Harry Potter turning on the lights just a bit brighter. He smiled, saying, “How are you feeling?”
“Did you find anything, dear?”
Draco liked to sleep in. Especially Saturdays of all days. Potter thought he can just demand things and everyone would listen and obey. He was praying to Merlin that it would be anyone else but Potter who showed up. He'd take Weasley over Potter. Anyday, anytime. He can take the Mickey out of Weasley easily. But Potter...Potter rubs him the wrong way. Yes, he hadn't seen him in years but his face hadn't exactly been out of sight. The Prophet usually liked to feature the Boy-Who-Lived on it's front page. His engagement (and breakup) from Weaselette, him outing himself as bisexual after being spotted with a muggle bloke, and of course, the melodramatic Harry the Hero article on the new wizarding orphanage he opened that mainly survives on his funding.
Harry felt the sorrow and helplessness in his voice. “Well I think your store is brilliant, Malfoy. You create all of it yourself, thinking of special brews and recipes for children and animals, even. I’ve become quite obsessed with it.”
“Oh, alright. I’ll go.”
Until....

“They look much better, Draco. We can put some more,” he said, taking out another bottle of dittany from the drawer. “I think they'll fade away completely, given the time.”
“You're clean, Potter,” Draco said politely, not taking his eyes off of him.
“Excuse me, ma’am, do you have two more bottles of this?”
“Let me see, Drakon.” She used a few spells on different areas of his body. Harry didn’t know why and for what. He wasn’t sure if he was allowed to be here, either. He leaned down to speak to Draco.
His image of Potter had shattered. It cut him deeply and he knew he would replay this scene in his mind over and over again. Potter always had this affect on him. Potter always lingered...
Tears started to run down Draco’s face. “I...I’m so tired, Frida,” he sobbed.
“You like to clean, Malfoy,” he said, contemplatively. Draco froze.
Sometime after nine, Draco heard his floo downstairs and jumped abruptly from bed.
“How much pain are you in?” Harry asked.
He heard a chair being dragged against the floor near him, and knew Potter was sitting down. It was much less threatening than having him stand. It was also less threatening that he was using his first name, having called each other by their surnames all throughout Hogwarts. It didn't make him feel any less abashed and he continued to keep his face hidden.
“Not my child, no. My godson, Teddy,” Harry replied kindly. Draco was sure he had crossed a line between a civil and personal question for someone he didn’t know very well - unlike some of the witches and wizards who frequented his store. They knew most by name, and others they knew more personally. He gave a quick glance towards Potter.
He saw Harry’s face fall. “I invited you over.”
“Stop it, get off me you savage! You fucking monster!” The man let go of Draco's genitals and punched him hard, blackening his vision. Draco was terrified and wasn't able to move. He willed himself to apparate, to do anything to get out of this. He wanted to scream and cry but knew that nobody would hear him. In the darkness, he felt his body being cut and slashed and finally screamed with all his might at the very top of his lungs.
“Are you insane??” Frida sounded horrified. She circled around him, her body floating ferociously around. “You go and have a good time! Use those smart brains of yours in your work, but don’t you dare over-analyze this! You accept his invitation and try to have a good time! You deserve it, dear.”
He was pushed onto his back on top of the bed that was only half-covered with wrinkled, grey sheets. The husky male grabbed both sides of Draco's head, almost covering it entirely, and crashed his lips hard against his. It was warm and wet and Draco suffocated under the heavy, sour breath. He struggled to breathe and let out a desperate moan in his throat. The man pulled up and stared intently into Draco's eyes.
Draco looked at me and I couldn't tell if he understood. His eyes were scanning my face and he squeezed my hand.
“Is Draco alright?” Harry sounded worried.
Harry took a big swig of his butterbeer, half of the liquid gone when he finally put down the mug. It was cold and sweet and immediately gave him energy.
Harry quickly undressed, and Draco rubbed his hands all over his toned and tanned arms and chest. He was gorgeous and Draco wanted all of him. When his jeans came off, Draco grabbed his pants and pulled them down, freeing his desperate erection. Harry's penis was already leaking.
Tears rolled down his bruised, tender face and onto the pillow.
The following day, Harry was carrying a white bakery box into
Harry realized this was the Frida who had previously owned this shop as a fabric store. And she was still around - as a ghost.
“Yea...yes.”
“Good.” Draco pushed his hips toward Harry's hands. Harry slipped his oily fingers further down, touching the tip of Draco's large clitoris.
Harry grabbed it between his fingers, stroking him, as his other hand went up to one of his nipples. “This is ok?”
“Great,” Potter grinned widely. He took out a card out of his breast pocket. “Here’s my Floo address. Come by when you close.” He set it on the counter, near Draco’s fingers, and left the shop. Draco stood frozen with the flannel in his hand.
This is not how Harry wanted it at all. He didn’t know what else to say.
Harry looked at her for some answers, and she just shook her head. Harry didn’t know how Draco could last so long, it felt like days had gone by.
I remember wanting to kiss more than just his temple. I wanted to cover his face with a hundred kisses and I wanted him to open his eyes and smile and see the stars that I was seeing and tell me that they looked like they were dancing and I wanted to tell him all my dreams about him and all my thoughts and everything in my heart but I was beaten and he was beaten and now everything's broken and I'm here sobbing and screaming and looking into his eyes, more beautiful than any star in the black sky.
“Yes. Just for some drinks. I can...also cook.”
Harry placed the tip of his penis against Draco's opening and pushed in, very slowly, enjoying every second of his entry into Draco's beautiful body.
“A prescription for a strong pain potion. I’ve never seen one before. Said I have to make sure the seller signs it and mails it back to them.”
“No, I’m afraid not. But that’s alright. Searching is half the fun,” he said, giving Harry a wink. “Oh look, Skele-Gro! I think an old man like me could use some of that.” This made Harry laugh.
“Harry, listen. I’m okay with you pretending it didn’t happen, alright? I’m used to stuff like that-”
“Where are you from?” Harry asked quickly before the wizard had a chance to apparate.
Draco rubbed his eyes with the bottom of his palms. He wanted to be swallowed up into the floor, disappearing from everyone and everything.
“I'm sorry mate, those looked expensive but your life matters more.” Modley sounded genuinely regretful as Harry carefully peeled off the fabric from Draco's legs. His pants came off with them, the spell cutting through all the layers of fabric but sparing his skin. Modley started to unbutton Draco's shirt, saying, “We should check the rest of his body.”
“What are you, you fucking freak?!”
Harry was startled by this. Did Draco want him to stay longer? “Um...I don’t. I can help you with that.” He took the teacups from Draco’s hands and set them down.
“No. No, Draco. The baby needs you. You’re going to be such a good dad. This child is going to be so smart and so talented and so blessed because of you, Draco. Stay strong. I know it’s awful, I’m so sorry. I wish I could bear this for you.” Harry’s voice started to break so he stopped speaking.
“Besides the cuts, nothing else, thankfully. You'll just need time to recover, practice working those muscles again, and gain strength. I'd give it about a week before you'll be able to leave.”
He took out a cotton wad from the drawer and continued smearing the oil around Draco's eye. He put some on the other as well.
Draco looked down, giving it a final thought.
“I’m not angry. I think a part of me knew. I just didn’t want to think about it.”
Draco waited a bit to speak back, taking in a deep breath.
“It’s alright, Malfoy. I’m not going to take up much of your time. I just wanted to give you these.” He placed the jasmines on top of Draco’s book, turning away towards the door.
“Then say so, don't move like that so soon, you're not ready.”
“I’m scared.” Harry didn’t see a point in pretending otherwise. “Can I ask you something?”
Potter did that thing again with his hands; holding up his palms to feign innocence.
“Hangover potion? Well, well, well…..someone had an exciting night!” Frida was smiling and gesturing dramatically, nudging Draco for more information.
Ron’s chewing slowed down. “Alright….I think you need to go see him again before you ruin any chance you have. Eight weeks is a long time, mate. He might already be over you by now.”
Harry picked up his daughter and she sat around his shoulders. She held him around his neck and bounced joyfully, enjoying her ride to
“Enjoying the novel as much as I am?” Draco said, smirking. He sat on an armchair next to the sofa Harry was on, putting up his feet on the coffee table.
“Not bad, Potter. You’d make a fine potions master,” Malfoy smirked playfully.
Was he doing this out of sympathy? Helping his former enemy because he faced discrimination and got sexually assaulted? He supposed another would think this was some sort of justice, given Malfoy's bullying during school and involvement in the war. But Harry knew his strength was in his empathy for others. Draco was a kid like he was during Hogwarts and greatly influenced by his family. Maybe he felt like he had no other choice. He remembered him lowering his wand when attempting to kill Dumbledore and not outing him to his aunt after his capture by the Snatchers. Still, their differences in upbringing and attitude may be too great for any sort of friendship. Harry took a deep breath and sighed. He had to remain professional. He would help Malfoy for the rest of his recovery and not get any more involved than that.
"I don't think I've ever seen that shop," Harry added, furrowing his eyebrows.
Draco felt defenseless at the absence of Potter's body. They were about the same height and weight but Potter's protective and gracious nature had made him feel so safe and secure.
As soon as Harry was gone, Draco got out of the bathtub, unstopped it, and wrapped the fluffy white towel around himself. He wiped off some of the steam on the mirror to look at his hair. It looked immaculate. He needed a haircut but there wasn’t a single piece of hair that looked damaged or out of place. He ran his fingers through his damp hair, remembering how it felt when Harry was doing it. He didn’t know whether it was his newly diagnosed heart condition or Potter’s generosity that made the thumping in his chest go a bit faster.
Draco had been walking back from the loo when he let himself collapse to the floor very close to his front door. Vasilia had told him to empty his bladder during their Fire-call. He took deep breaths as instructed, and kept his eyes closed to keep his fear at bay.
“I slept like shit.”
“Fuck...” Draco rubbed against it, yearning for more.
“Oh, hello young man! Well….you remembered. I was just thinking…..I forgot what I was supposed to buy.”
“Where are your potions?”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, getting up on his feet. He leaned over his desk, trying to regain some composure. The book he had been using for the male conception potion was still open to the page he’d left it on. He hadn’t touched it in all this time. His eyes scanned the writing, over and over again.
“Whiskey or brandy?” Harry started to pour them drinks.
“I can believe that,” Draco replied, contemplatively. “This book wasn’t easy to find and even harder to purchase. He sold it to me because I had just received my license to practice independently and promised him in writing that I wouldn’t start to brew this particular potion until I had at least 25 years of experience in the craft. Only thing is, the contract said 'in France,' and I knew by then that I had to come back to England.” Draco winked and smiled at Frida, whose face was in shock from surprise.
Draco smirked, softly laughing. “Who do you think?”
Harry immediately realized his mistake. He should not have questioned someone who hadn’t felt the comfort of warm water on his body in years.
“I’m going to have to, Frida. This potion needs to be heated again in two hours when I add in the stinging nettle root.”
“Even if I were, I wouldn't out them to you, Potter.”
“That doesn’t matter right now. It may mean something or it may not. Maybe he wants to be friends, get to know you better, or he’s interested in other ways, but that’s not something you’re going to find out at this moment, so it’s not worth worrying over it, dear.” She replied patiently this time, facing him and staring right into his eyes.
“I don't want you to stop, Harry, but I want you to take off your clothes.”
Harry repeated the same with his other leg. He took out a bottle of dittany from his case and poured some of the brown liquid onto his hand. He took his wand with the other  and cast a warming charm. Draco smiled; remembering his comment about the coldness of his fingers. Potter rubbed the dittany individually on each scar, taking his time and making sure that every one of them got covered.
“I can't stay very long...” Harry started.
Draco felt his emotions swimming around inside his head. “Thank you, Potter. You’re a nice man.”
“Potter, are you serious?”
“He just..asked me to go over to his place.”
“Faster breaths, Draco. Breathe through it.” Peter’s voice came from the other side, who was getting some blankets and hot water ready.
Harry stood in his place for a long time, processing everything that had just happened.
“Are you sure?”
“Pah....Ha...Har..”
“This is a body heat draught. It’s still a formula I’m working on so it’s not named and labeled yet. I just have to get it to work longer, it only lasts for about 30 minutes. You can take it.” He handed the bottle to Harry, who took it while softy brushing his fingertips against Draco’s knuckles. They felt cold and smooth, making Draco’s insides shiver.
“No Potter. There's no one. Long story.”
Harry smiled in excitement and carefully removed his fingers from Draco. He gave Draco a hard kiss right on the lips and pushed himself off of him.  Draco noticed Harry rubbing his hard cock in preparation, which was already wet from a lubrication charm he’d likely used wandlessly.
“For….not visiting you as often. And I know you said I don’t owe you anything, but Draco, I can’t pretend what happened didn’t happen, and it doesn’t feel right not to talk to you.”
“You don’t even know, Frida. I did something incredibly stupid. It was fucking amazing, but it was stupid.”
“Fuck me harder. I'm not fragile, fuck me harder.”
“Yes, Draco?” Then it happened. If he had mistaken Potter’s hand on his shoulder as just something friendly, then there would be no confusion about what came next. Harry carded his fingernails through Dracos’ hair, running them all the way to the back of his neck. He rested his hand there, pressing his forehead on Draco’s. They both kept their eyes open.
“Where am I? Where am I?! Let me go, let me go!”
“Ready when you are. I'd like to try walking.”
“Draco?”
“How does that even work?!” She was now showing concern.
I held my breath and my heart must've stopped for a few seconds. One of Draco's pupils was about twice as large as the other one. He parted his lips.
“What happened to her?” Draco asked, concerned.
“Elaborate.”
Draco shook his head, uttering a “nothing,” which sounded just a bit louder than a whisper. He started polishing harder, going in between the raised buttons.
“Hold both my wrists and take small steps. Let go when you feel like you won't fall.”
Draco looked toward the closed door. “Is he your type?”
Draco felt worse. He angrily took off his shirt, almost ripping it as he pulled it over his head.
,” which stood for the name of the shop, Harry figured.
“You go to bed. I’ll look for her. I don’t remember her surname but I’ll know it when I see it. You go rest.”
“The smell helps settle my stomach. It’s strange.”
“It all just seems so….I don’t know.”
“Your friends?”
“Yeah right,” Harry muttered bashfully. “How much do I owe you for these?”
“Its not unbearable but it hurts a lot when I move. Will the scars heal?”
“That’s alright, Draco,” Harry reassured him. “They’ve probably done this so many times and seen so many bodies. Nobody is judging you.”
“I can’t….baby is taking up all the space right now. Squishing my stomach, lungs and bladder. I have to constantly pee.” He struggled to lean over to take a croissant.
Harry sighed. “He's not my type. I want to check your legs and stomach. I know we destroyed your clothes last night, so here,” he said, taking the orange paper bag from the table and handing it to Draco.
“Why is it funny, Frida?”
Harry licked two of his fingers, still keeping his eyes on Draco. He slowly entered one finger inside of him, using his other hand to bend one of Draco’s knees towards his chest.
“So...” Harry began. “I just need your signature on this statement. At the end of it. You can read it through."
Draco’s eyes widened at the sight of his baby. It was a girl. She had dark hair and wet, pink skin. Draco’s body started to shake and he sobbed loudly, kissing the head of his child.
Harry kept his eyes on Draco's as he completely went inside him. They were both breathing hard and Draco swallowed, saying, “Move. Move slowly.”
Draco looked up and smiled back.
“No more crying. Let me come with you. Please," he softly pleaded.
It was now nearing summer and Draco had a visible bump on his belly. He had made a decision not to hide his condition, and anyone who was curious and asked got the truthful answer. As truthful as Draco decided he was comfortable with. Some of his customers knew he was expecting a baby and were told that it was a decision Draco made on purpose. There was no other father and he’d be parenting on his own. They usually didn’t intrude any more after that.
“I don’t think that’ll be a problem,” Draco said, smiling.
“I should do more,” Harry said, looking at his shoes.
“Here, let me show you,” Harry said, gently taking it from Draco’s hand and popping off the cork. He put a generous amount onto his hand and smeared it on top of Draco’s head. The contact made Draco jump and his eyes grew slightly wider for an instant.
Vasilia leaned in front of him, “It is okay, Drakon. Do not be scared, okay? Do not fight, that is very important. Let it come.”
Harry took out the shopping bag from under his desk after Modley left. He set it aside the potion case and mentally prepared himself to see Draco again. He heard Hermione's voice in his head.
. Modley adjusted Draco's legs onto the bed; holding each ankle with each hand. He looked to Harry and smiled. Harry smiled back. He was grateful Modley was so caring and genteel. He knew he could've ended up working with someone much less agreeable. Modley walked toward him, gently slapped him on the back whispering, “good luck” and left, locking the door behind him. Harry took the chair from the corner of the room, brought it closer to Draco and sat down. He set the bag and the case he was holding on the bedside table.
“Potter....you're such a sap.”
“Going to work late tonight, dear?”
Harry stepped inside Draco's room in the morning with two cups of tea and toast. He noticed the bed was empty and perfectly made with no sign of anyone being there recently. As he set down the tray on the side-table, his mind went to last night. Looking at this highly polished and sterile piece of hospital furniture that Draco slept in for the past few days, one would not think that it had provided a place of such passion, lust, and even....love between two people.
Harry was silent for a moment. He picked up his glass and took another sip, keeping his eyes on the wall across from them.
“Right above my shop.”
This wasn't what Draco was expecting at all. He hadn't even wanted Potter here in the first place. But this Potter wasn't the image in the newspapers. He needed to give Draco a reason to keep his beliefs in place. He wanted to see an egotistical, self-righteous Potter. He needed to keep convincing himself that it was better to hate Potter instead of pathetically sweating and swallowing in his presence.
“Why?”
“Go. I shout if vee need you.” She smiled at him as Harry left.
Draco thought about this.
“Your fingers are cold.”
“I...I have this prescription for a potion from St. Mungo’s,” he tried speaking efficiently with his auror professionalism. “Would you happen to sell it here?”
Draco hadn't seen Potter for years. Seven to be exact. When he had received an owl about getting his name cleared with the Ministry, he hadn't expected it from the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Draco picked up a squared glass bottle with yellow pellets inside. He handed it to Harry.
“Do not worry about that, I have good news for you!” She said, indicating him to follow her to the back room.
Draco hoped his feelings, and possible mannerisms around Potter, were only obvious to Frida because she was so keen on human behavior. She had the talent for figuring out what someone wanted and what they might be feeling. That’s what made her so pleasant to work with and befriend. Draco had kept his feelings for Potter wrapped in a heavy rug, locked inside a steel trunk, shrunk to the size of a pearl, shoved away inside a secret chamber in his heart, where no one could possibly discover it. This was a place he was never willing to open, or even entertain the thought of. For many long years, he had avoided any thoughts of Harry Potter and his past in England. Now it was becoming reality that the world of his childhood and school years might rise to the surface and this would be utterly terrifying.
“Draco, that was a long time ago! You’re in England now-”
Draco thought he was dreaming. “To...your place?”
“That will be fifteen sickles, good lady. We wish you good health and a good night!”
“Don't leave without me. Come with me. I want you to. I want it more than anything.”
“I’ve told other customers, I can tell you too. I’m pregnant.”
Draco’s heart was breaking as much as it was mending.
“Come with me,” Harry said again, letting go of his head and giving his hand a hard squeeze.
“When we dock, I want to get off this ship with you.”
“Don't be ridiculous. I'll get very angry if you even attempted.”
“Hello Draco,” he said, giving him a shy smile. Draco started polishing the bottles more aggressively.
The directory was laid open on his desk, the name
“Ron, I know….I just…” Harry ran his fingers through his hair again, tired and frustrated.
“I’ll try to be more open-minded. Tell me,” Draco replied, impishly annoyed.
Draco was breathing deeply with his eyes closed. Harry instinctively started to massage his lower back.
Harry nodded his head.
“Another one.”
“Yes…I have to go.” And he quickly ran to the back room.
“I want to die!” Draco sobbed against Harry’s chest.
Harry walked to the main office on the first floor to give his official resignation. 'Personal reasons' was all they needed to hear. He also walked through the emergency ward one last time before exiting the building. He stood right in front of Room 108, his heart heavy with pain and with yearning. “Take care, Draco.” He whispered to himself and made his way toward the apparation point at the end of the hospital.
“That’s the past, Malfoy. Everyone deserves a second chance. And you’ve really turned yourself around. I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. I’m being honest.”
“Smells a bit like...thyme, mint, lavender...and is that, sandalwood...vanilla?
Harry was standing next to a small dinner table near the kitchen. He smiled upon seeing Draco and started to serve him first. They both sat down at the same time across from one another. The food looked incredible and smelled delicious. There was a pasta dish with a red pepper sauce, stir-fried vegetables, cucumber salad, garlic bread, and a glass of water with condensation building on the outside. Draco felt overwhelmed.
“How did I get here? Where are my clothes?” His voice was raspy; his throat dry and sore.
The old man nodded. “Sometimes, you have to convince them they are worthy of being loved. You know, most of us don’t think we are. We can miss a great deal out on life with a belief like that.” The old wizard blew out a large ring of smoke, looking up at the sky.
“I...uh…...I have a bad sunburn,” he said, uncomfortably laughing and pointing to his face.” Draco laughed back.
“Its fine, Modley, thank you. I'm glad he was well enough to leave so quickly. Hopefully he won't get into trouble again.” Harry hoped that his sadness didn't lurk beneath his fake, cool exterior. He left the room; needing a private space to think.
“No, that’s alright,” Harry said, taking the bag and putting his money on the counter.
“I think your father is missing out on a great son, Malfoy. You’re talented, hard-working, and intelligent. His. Fucking. Loss.” He said the last words into the cup as he took a drink.
They both sipped the strong brown liquor, almost simultaneously. Harry refilled both their glasses.
“No Draco, he didn't. There was no evidence of rape. I'm so sorry you went through this. I'd like it if the aurors caught him. He needs to be in Azkaban..."
“Ahhhh…...make it stop, please.” He squirmed against Harry’s body, and Harry held his hands even tighter, trying to relieve his pain. “Harry….please….ahhhhh…..Potter!!”
“Draco....I'm....this is wrong, I....I'm going to get in trouble.”
Harry looked deeply into Draco's silver eyes. He wished he had met him under different circumstances. Instead they were here, in a hospital room, playing healer and patient, and struggling to keep their distance. Still, this was a job. A job he had to finish. He took the oil and went back to Draco's stomach.
That night, Frida immediately flew to the back room as soon as she locked up.
Draco was breathing heavily and desperately looked at Harry. “Keep touching me.”
_____________
“I am not!” Draco shouted, immediately realizing that he did, in fact, get into denial as she had predicted. “I mean….umm….that’s a bit extreme, Frida. C’mon!”
“Draco, its ok. You're not alone. You're safe. We're taking care of you.”
“Sorry Draco, is there uh...more beneath?”
Harry pushed in further. Draco was painfully tight. “I'm halfway in, Draco. How does it feel?”
“That’s a long time,” Ron remembered to chew and took a sip of beer.
“And you’ve been told how to use it, correct?”
“I love you,” Harry spoke right against Draco’s lips.
“Draco,” he whispered, softly rubbing his lower back. Draco's eyes were closed as he willed himself to get back up again. Pushing on his palms, he slowly stood up and Harry stepped away. He sat on the bed, took a deep breath, and looked up at Potter.
“Wait. I need to tell you something first.”
“I need to use your loo, if that’s okay.” Harry was looking around to see which direction to go.
“Oh….death?” Peter whispered the last part.
When they entered the shop, Jasmine nudged Harry to put her down and she quickly ran towards Frida.
“May I come in?”
“Do you have plans tonight? Are you busy?”
Draco shut the door behind him and sped towards the wastebasket near his desk. He threw up everything he’d eaten earlier and his stomach felt like it still needed to release more. He quickly wiped his mouth with his sleeve, turning to Frida, who was staring at him in shock and horror.
“Draco...I want to see you. Let me see you,” he spoke to him tenderly, rubbing his thumb over his cheek again. “You’re so beautiful, look at me while I fuck you.”
“Thanks,” Draco said, swallowing the whole thing.
Frida came back within seconds, handing the wand to Draco. He checked the words inside the book, muttering the spell a few times to practice, then, pulling up his shirt, placed his wand over his bare stomach below the naval. He did this over and over again, and each time, a red light glowed from the tip of his wand. He fell back on his chair, grabbing the front of his hair in frustration.
“Draco, are you alright?” Potter sounded genuinely concerned.
“What do you think, young lady?” The wizard said. “I think Skele-Gro is quite useful to have. The bottle alone is a great decoration in my opinion.”
Harry made himself down Draco’s body, kissed his breastbone, stomach, took his cock in his hand again, kissed the base, his scrotum, and perineum. He gently stroked the backs of Dracos’ thighs, finally resting them on his buttocks, spreading them open gently. Draco’s mind felt like mush and his body completely surrendered to Harry. Draco pulled his legs towards him with his hands from the back of his knees, giving Harry a complete view of the most intimate parts of his body. He felt Potter’s wet tongue gently lick his hole and he tightened the grip he had on his own legs. He firmly shut his eyes and started to slowly pant from pleasure and excitement. Harry twirled his tongue faster, covering his entire outer rim and making his way to the very center. He slowly started to penetrate him, his tongue hard, hot, and very wet. Draco let out a loud moan, not able to hold it in any longer.
“Nothing, Potter, it’s fine.”
"The khed is almost out, Drakon!” He felt one of Vasilia’s hands massage some sort of oil around the rim of his canal, and the other hand put pressure on his bottom.
spell. Harry immediately put the box on the floor and fell to Draco’s side. “Draco, hey. What’s the matter?” He tried to keep his voice calm.
Harry put his hands in his pockets.
“Yes, fuck yes.”
“Can you please give him something stronger for the pain? Maybe let him sleep for awhile without feeling anything?”
Potter raised his eyebrows. “Yourself?”
“You’ll hate me.”
“Have I found it yet?” Harry asked. “I want to find your spot. I want to hear you scream, Draco.” He gently put his second finger in, alongside the other one. Draco moaned in both pleasure and the slight pressure of his muscles adjusting to the intrusion.
“Can I go further down? You're so wet, Draco. I want to taste you so badly.”
“And the paperwork? Will it say female?” Draco asked, feeling anxious and exhausted at the same time.
“Yeah...well, it did that for me, I guess. I’ve been in love with him for years.”
“No clue, mate. There’s another potion shop a bit closer than Jiggers. I just found out about it, I can’t believe I’ve never even noticed it before. Apparently, it's been open for months. Henderson told me about it last week and I didn’t even care enough to tell you but I should. Guess who fucking owns it, just guess!” Ron’s voice got louder with a strange excitement Harry hadn’t heard since he announced his engagement to Hermione.
“Come up further,” Draco directed him, taking his penis inside his mouth as Harry continued to fuck him with his fingers.
“I wanted to make you breakfast.”
“Draco….I care about you so much.” Harry's voice got him back into focus. “You’re almost done, baby.” He saw the tears on Harry’s face. Peter had been telling the truth.
“It’s fine, Potter, I don’t mind.” Draco double checked the current bubble placement and sank into the tub a little deeper, his chin almost touching the surface of the water. Harry continued to apply more of the potion onto Draco’s hair, covering it entirely with the gooey liquid. Then Harry used the wooden comb, which easily passed through the strands. He rinsed off the excess grease using an empty jar on the other side of the tub to pour some of the bath water onto Draco’s head. He used his fingers to arrange the hair in place and Draco felt his scalp tingle at the sensation. It had to be because of the potion, he thought. He was thankful he was underwater because he didn’t want Harry to see the goosebumps running down his skin.
“Oh! Oh dear...well, that’s alright, you can say anything you like to me, dear, you know that.”
“Potter, I’m going to say this in case I look like a fool. As you probably already figured out, I haven’t had a bath, new clothes, or proper food in a very long time. This all happened out of nowhere and I don’t know how you found me, and not just that, but you decide to take me inside your home, give me my own bedroom, new clothes, a hot bath, fix my hair, and cook a meal. I did not expect my life to change like this overnight and certainly not by someone I know from school and have a less than pleasant history with. I don’t want to pretend that our past doesn’t exist.”
“Malfoy….can I touch you….here?” He lightly stroked Draco’s penis over his underwear.
“Frida…” His voice was raspy and shaking. “Get Potter out of here. Please.”
“What do you wanna do, mate?”
“I want to leave,” he said, eyes watering as he fought back tears.
Harry put his drink down on the table and sat up straight, a little closer to Draco than before. “No, you definitely aren’t.” He stretched out his arm on top of the sofa behind Draco’s head; the tips of his fingers millimeters away from Draco’s hair. Draco didn’t shift or move at all, and kept nursing the glass in his hand.
Harry looked down. “I have no wisdom, sir. I don’t know how to get close to someone I care about.”
By the time Draco came back to his senses and wanted to say something, Harry had already left.
This seemed to take her mind completely off sweets. “Yay!!”
Draco nodded, not directly looking at Harry.
Draco just looked at him, his eyes glassy, his hands still holding onto Harry’s hair. Harry tenderly kissed his lips, coming up slightly to look at him. He put his hand on Draco’s face, rubbing his cheek with his thumb.
