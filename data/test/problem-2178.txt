If it had been Harry, those rooms would have been explored, no question. Having a secret right around the corner from where you sleep? No, thank you.
“We’re going to start really basic for our first class, just to sort of get into the swing of things. Truthfully,” he says, pausing, considering whether or not he should continue his thought. “It’s going to take me a few classes to get my bearings, to be completely honest with you. As some of you know, I have a little bit of teaching experience, but it’s limited, and those circumstances were a lot different. That was about survival, and this is about… Well, ultimately, it’s still about survival, I suppose.” He pauses again, aware that he’s rambling.
“Yes, see you later,” she says, grinning, then turns on her heel and marches into the book-lined shelves.
“Er, odd question, but could you tell me exactly where it is that I am?” he asks her as she returns to the chair.
Luckily, his team seems easy enough to manage. Ron is the only person who speaks much at all, the other players opting for a listen and replicate strategy for their first practice. He’d be naive to think that his own reputation had nothing to do with that, and he hates the idea of people being afraid of him. Another reason to potentially shift some captain-related responsibilities to someone else, then. Draco doesn’t want to feel like the rule enforcer, the one to
. If you just act normally and allow things to develop the way they will, it might give you a better idea about what’s happening on his end. The other choice is…You could talk to him about it.”
Leon looks at him for a second. And then, he laughs. He laughs so hard that he has to step away so he can double over, and Harry isn’t sure what’s so funny but hearing the glee in Leon’s voice seems to sharpen the colors around him.
Draco nearly stumbles. “I—what?” His plan had been to ask Harry the same question, so he’s thrown by the reversal. “Yes, I’m fine. I’m more worried about you, if I’m honest.”
“Excuse me, I will thank you to keep your voice down!” Madam Pomfrey barks after him as he sprints down the length of the wing. He stops dead when he sees Draco, who rises from his squatting position and gives Leon a pleasant smile.
Harry has changed so much since then. He’s no longer swimming in the robes, he’s wearing them rather than being worn, essentially. He’s filled out some, still trim but with broader shoulders, a bit more muscle on him. His hair is shorter than it was then, too (thank fuck, fourth year was not a particularly wonderful year for hair) and styled much better, not just hanging wildly everywhere. And his face feels different too, he thinks. He’s has taken on a bit more color, has sharpened out a bit. He’s certain his scar has faded some since the beginning of term as well, is no longer immediately drawn to it when he looks at himself.
There’s a pause, but then she says, “Positive. My father used to cut hair to pay his way through dental school, and he taught me when I was younger. I always practiced on him, so I know how to cut a boy’s hair, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
Draco shrugs and scoffs. “I don’t know, but he’s our Head of Bloody House, so if he can’t help me I’m properly fucked.” And with that, he slips out of their room, creeps out of Ravenclaw Tower, and slinks through the hallways to Slughorn’s office.
It only takes ten minutes in Hogsmeade for Harry to forget his troubles. Leon looks at just about everything with wide eyes and wonder popping in bursts behind his irises.
“They bloody know who you are,” Ginny says. “He’s a lot cooler on paper, believe me. Ginny Weasley, seventh year, Chaser.”
Draco’s final hug is surprising but not unwelcome. Something about the physical touch and absence of speech comforts Harry more than anything that could ever be said. It’s a vow; it’s a decree of understanding.
Harry’s heart plummets, smacking some arbitrary floor and cracking in half. He puts what pieces together that he can. These Aurors had come for Draco, clearly. The
All eyes are on him, expressions slightly tense and curious. After a second, he smiles and says “Well, let’s eat, then!”
He could collapse with relief. Or maybe it’s just because he’s been too nervous to eat all day. A draft blows down the corridor and lifts the hair away from his eyes.
“Or the time I fell off my broom because I thought there were…” He stops himself. Right. Draco had been one of the perpetrators in the fake Dementor incident. He’s grateful that his name is called so he can step away, suddenly feeling uncharacteristically self-conscious. This is his territory. He knows Quidditch. Why should he care what anybody thinks?
She sounds truthful enough, and at this point turning her down would land him in detention until he’s married with children.
Harry remains in her arms for a few moments, waiting for the sting of that sucker punch of distress to pass.
Leon chooses the seat between Ginny and Harry. Luna sits to Harry’s left, then Ron and Hermione. Leon kicks Harry gently under the table and he feels himself relax, smile, breathe.
Draco swallows a lump in his throat. “All right, go on. It was never really about him?” he says with a little smile of expectation.
Hermione nods. “And this way, you can focus on the things you’ll need to be an Auror! You’ll have a much better chance at a job if you’re technically qualified for it.”
go there. I’ve spent so much of my own life thinking that it should have been me instead. But those people...they didn’t die in vain, they died standing up for something that they believed in, and everything they did made a difference. You
A murmur ripples through the crowd. That’s less than thirty people, and there are nearly sixty who had tried out.
Harry exhales carefully, not wanting the sigh to sound as frustrated as he feels. “You’ll be the first to know if anything strange is going on, with both me and Draco. And I will do my absolute best to avoid danger. Draco and I agreed that we wouldn’t return to the dungeons again, as it were.”
“Can we speak privately for a second?” Harry asks him. Leon complies, following him into an empty corner of the common room.
Draco shakes his head and almost trips over a stray item of clothing as he takes another step backward. It doesn’t matter if his father has fabricated some of the accusations.
Weasley looks down at the ground. Potter gives a twitch of an eyebrow. Draco looks between them and offers no response.
As he runs a finger along the dinged table, Draco laughs. “I’m aware, yes. In case you forgot, I’m a rather good potioneer. If I can do a Draught of Living Death, I think I can handle supper.” It’s a valid concern, admittedly. Draco never had to learn to cook growing up. At home, the house elves always kept food on the table. The same is true of Hogwarts. Was true. In all of the madness, he’s nearly forgotten that Hogwarts is shutting down.
“I can give you until Saturday, at the very latest. If you do choose to start, Monday will be your first day. I’ll also give you a week to get settled and run the class however you like, but then you’d need to start adhering to a Ministry-approved curriculum. Filtered through myself, of course.”
Harry has a ranking system for the shittiest days of his life. There are some obvious contenders toward the top of said list. Dying is up there, along with all of the other events of that particular day. The Department of Mysteries. The day Ron disappeared when they were on the run. Voldemort’s second coming. His parents dying is an honorable mention, as he doesn’t actually remember it. But it’s had such an impact on his life that it doesn’t make sense not to count it.
“You’re a lovely dancer,” Luna says as Harry does his best to lead, focusing mostly on avoiding her feet.
“Sorry to bother you,” he says, his accent not as heavy as Gabrielle’s. “I’ve been chosen as the liaison for Beauxbatons during our time at Hogwarts, and your headmistress has informed me that you are...what did she call it? Head of the boys?”
He leers at both of them. “I’m not thick, you know! Both of you already know what that meeting was about,
Hermione’s hand is the first in the air, though it hadn’t shot up with her usual vigor. Harry figures this is what saves her from the typical collective eye roll. His throat tightens as he sees another hand cautiously raise in the back of the room. Leon looks rather proud of himself despite seeming reluctant to admit it.
Harry squeezes back. “I know. Last time I was here it was so overwhelming to look at. Now…I don’t know. It’s so far in the past. And he’s gone. For good. I just have to keep telling myself that,” he says. He brushes the scar on his forehead with his free hand; Draco makes a mental note to ask about that later.
Luna shrugs, not dismissively, but in her typical Luna manner. “I hadn’t considered it much. If anyone asked, I suppose I would say yes.”
Hands on her hips, Molly heaves a deep sigh. “All right, then. Maybe she’ll be hungry later. Bill, would you help me get some pumpkin juice poured?”
is going on. I haven’t given her any of the details, but I had to tell someone. And I trust her. I hope that’s alright.”
“The headmistress told me what happened and I got here as soon as I could. I…” She isn’t able to finish as she finally gets a good look at Draco, her legs refusing to hold her up any longer as she collapses into the chair that Potter—Harry—had been sitting in earlier. He isn’t sure if there’s any damage to his face, but he
“I’m out of practice,” Harry counters, pouring himself a large glass of pumpkin juice. “And I think it’s mad to get hung up on a possibility and threaten to not play for a whole year. Our
Another tear dribbles down his cheek. “So that’s it? We just have to pack up our things and go home?”
“Me, too,” Harry murmurs. Dumbledore gives him one last nod, an encouraging smile, and then Harry is holding his breath, turning on the spot, the hazy image of a sitting room that once did and still does belong to him painting itself into the crevices in his mind; the world goes dark as he’s squeezed into nothing from all sides, shooting through space, shattering through the barrier that should prevent him from Disapparating out of Hogwarts by a combination of willpower and the remnants of a dead fragment of soul still hooked into his own, and for a moment he thinks that he’s miscalculated and he won’t make it, the darkness should be letting up, the pressure should release, it’s all pressing in, crushing him, sucking the breath out of his body—
“And what are we working on today, Mister Malfoy?” Slughorn asks as he approaches. Each student had been required to choose their own assignment for the first class. This particular choice sits right in the center of Draco’s capability, not too challenging to be perceived as flashy, but just enough so that it does set him apart from the others.
He wishes the answer was more obvious. And then again, there’s that conversation he’d overheard between Harry and McGonagall his first day in the Hospital Wing. Could it be that no wizard is directly responsible at all? Is there just something wrong with Hogwarts? He feels almost responsible for getting to the bottom of things now that he’s so entwined in them, but with no solid leads it just feels fruitless right now.
Leon is joking, but something in Harry gushes forward before he can stop it. “Of course I do. Leon, this is not about you not being enough, not at
, like I’ve already said, my summer was a rather difficult one, and responding to letters was not high on my list of priorities.
He continues to scan the crowd of people mulling around the middle of the pitch. He sees quite a few Beauxbatons hopefuls, which is something of a surprise. He remembers that…Leon had talked about a few friends who were interested in Quidditch, but he’s completely in the dark about whether or not they have a league at school or if maybe they just play outside. Either way, they could be lacking in the talent to keep up with the Hogwarts students, or they could be miles ahead of them. Harry is incredibly interested to see how things play out.
“I…” Draco says, unable to form words. His voice sounds far off, like an echo of a whisper, rebounding off the barren walls of Harry’s insides.
“Can you just get on with the bloody teaching?” Ron shouts. That shifts the mood almost immediately as most people begin to laugh again, while a few mutter complaints that comments like that would get points docked in any other class.
“I really had myself convinced that you weren’t gay,” Leon says as he shakes his head. “When we started getting to know each other, I could tell that there was
“Thank you,” Draco says. He doesn’t trust himself to remain polite if he says anything more. Slughorn is a nice enough man, but all of Draco’s skill when it comes to brewing potions comes from Severus Snape. He’s always seen Slughorn as a bit of a pushover, a bumbling man with good intentions but who lacks on execution.
“Why the hell have we stopped, Draco?” His arm is still out, his splayed fingers dangerously close to brushing Harry’s forearm through his robes. Potential energy crackles in the space between skin and skin.
“Right, I actually wanted to talk to you about that,” Harry says and folds his hands, trying to look dignified, adult. She needs to know that this isn’t some silly little crush. “And there’s…something I think I should tell you.”
“At this time, we’ll be making our exodus and reconvening with the rest of our friends in the Great Hall. If you wouldn’t mind following Harry and me, we’ll lead the way there. Hope you all have a wonderful night.” Luna takes her wand away from her throat and nods. “I’ve always wanted to do that,” she says.
“Well…you’re welcome, I guess. He’s a Slytherin, I…I hope he’s alright. I know his sister will be worried.” He remembers how protective of her brother she had been. Joetta is her name, Draco recalls.
Harry blushes, the panic of the situation disappearing for a moment. His mouth twitches into a smile. “Yeah,” he says.
going to fail this time. If he has to manufacture memories to get this fucking spell to work, then that’s what he’ll do.
Hello everyone!! The last chapter had some mixed reviews (especially everything regarding Leon) so for those of you who aren't much fans of him, I can tell you that he is absent entirely from this chapter! Nothing but Drarry friendship (?) goodness here. This is also essentially the last chapter from Draco's perspective in the first act of this fic; we'll get one more from Harry before moving into more meaty plot stuff!! Very excited that I've been so motivated to write this and hoping you're all enjoying it :)
He doesn’t know how he got to his knees, just knows that it’s so cold, he’s trembling violently, and another Dementor makes a pass right over his head and he feels something depart, ripped out from him unceremoniously. Wails sound from somewhere far away, like the muffled sound of a stab victim, and suddenly Hermione is crouched next to him with her wand out, stammering over the incantation but unable to bring it to fruition through her sobs. She alternates, failing the spell, then screaming his name and trying to drag him away.
“Fine,” Draco says politely, not interested in small talk. Slughorn, luckily, is adept enough to pick up on this.
“Enough furniture talk!” Molly says as she lays a pile of toast next to the rest of the food. “Where’s Ginny?”
Harry is laughing picturing the boy providing his award-winning team name. Even funnier is the idea that Draco had to approve this.
sorry,” comes an oddly accented voice from above him, as he’s now bent over in pain. He bites his tongue, tempted to retaliate but still reeling. “Are you alright?”
“I know,” Draco grumbles. He wants to be mad at Harry for redeeming himself the way he did and showing him up, but it’s not actually a competition.
She nods. “That’s just life, Harry. If you think you truly know what’s going on at any given moment, you might be a bit delusional.” She gives him a moony smile. “I’m glad you told me, even if I already knew. That’s what friends do, after all.”
Harry groans and falls sideways, bouncing on the mattress. “Yes. And it’s stupid. I’m just writing whatever rubbish I think of.”
question. Are you sure you’re okay? I hadn’t meant to draw attention to us like that, and then with your Patronus…”
They both stand, hands still intertwined, and exit the bedroom. There’s a cupboard of sorts at the very end of the hall, and back towards the stairs is where Harry’s bedroom once was. As they pass, Draco’s breath hitches and his grip tightens.
“You’re out of your damn mind! What happened?” she asks, her voice full of horror but, even more prominently, intrigue.
Draco sighs, something tightening in his chest now that he actually has to form the words orbiting his conscience.
One of the doors to the Great Hall bangs open and someone rushes up the center of the room—a male student, it seems—who stops to whisper something to McGonagall. All necks are craned, ears trying to pick up any information. He steps away and gives her an awkward half-bow and finds a seat at the Hufflepuff table.
He’d been turned away from the hospital wing. Again. That Pamela girl apparently has an apprenticeship there, and is even scarier than Madam Pomfrey. Their conversation had gone something like this:
“Last time I was here was not under the most pleasant circumstances, so I’m very pleased to see your castle in a better light,” she explains, her head pointed skyward. “I see the ceiling accurately matches the stars of the night sky."
The skin around Leon’s eyes crinkles as he smiles. “I know. And I want to help you through that. Baby steps, right? Maybe you come out first, and then we go public soon after?”
He eventually finds himself on his back in the grass by the lake. His eyes are shiny, fragments of golden light caught in the beads of water that form at their corners as the sun starts to massage the horizon. Draco wishes he felt different than he did before, wishes that rationalizing everything would make it better. But as much as he tries to deal with the things that plagued his conscience, he knows that there is external work to be done.
Harry has been on edge in the days following the attack of David Winslow. While the incident didn’t end in disaster as he heard it would as it was happening, he can’t shake the feeling that something sinister is happening around Hogwarts. He can tell McGonagall is withholding something rather important, and he wishes so badly that she would tell him what’s going on. He wants to help. Hogwarts is the first place he ever felt at home, and if something is wrong… Well, Harry just won’t stand for that.
Harry sighs. “We still don’t really know what it is. It’s a very new development. Actually, you’re the first person I’ve told. Well, aside from Luna, but that’s a different situation. Not even Hermione knows most of this.”
“That’s fair. I hadn’t thought about this from your perspective, not fully, anyway. But I wanted to be honest with you and let you in on this part of my life because I care about you. And despite how you feel right, I know you care about me, too.”
Draco nods but says nothing. Murmurs float across from Harry’s bed, but Draco isn’t really listening.
“Really. And she has a partner who is absolutely incredible, and the two of them are very happy together, from what I understand. So the whole concept of homosexuality is just not something so novel and life-altering for me. But I can tell that it’s really shaken you up, because the realization happened so quickly. I just want you to know that I’m not trying to undermine your feelings, and I don’t want it to seem like I don’t care. Because I do.”
” Draco screams, and the young girl closest to them lifts into the air. Draco yanks his wand backward and she zips across the space, her velocity almost disrupted by the pitch black gravity in the center of the room, but Draco pulls harder. Harry has to jump out of the way as she flies past them; Draco manages to slow her fall and she collapses on the floor. She vomits and begins to cry, and Harry wants to help but there are still students in the hall.
Mari closes her eyes for a second and tilts her head. “And that’s fine. You haven’t given me many details so, like I said, it’s hard to give you an educated answer. My word is not law, either. It sounds like maybe you need to do some reflection on your own. It is
“I didn’t say that. Maybe if you’re explicit in your desire to be his date, he’ll choose you over him. I know I would.”
Harry approaches their little group again to take his turn assuring Mrs. Weasley that they’ll finally have a calm year and that they’ll write often, but he can’t help but glance over his shoulder a few times toward where Malfoy had stepped onto the scarlet locomotive, his gentle grin still playing in Harry’s mind. He thought things might start to feel normal again soon, but he realizes now that this is only the beginning of the truly abnormal.
“Try again,” Harry says, suddenly looking at Draco with a strange fervor. “Don’t think, just go. Now!”
if you hear anything from Draco, that information will also be made available to me at your earliest convenience.”
“I’ve been considering going into Healing.” The more he mulls it over, the more it makes sense. It’s been rolling around in his mind like a stone in a tumbler, the edges wearing down and revealing the beauty within. He’s decided that being a true and traditional Healer would not quite be his speed. He may have the patience, but he worries he would lack the empathy to connect with strangers. Not that he’s a cold person, but it takes time for Draco to really develop care for people. A result of a life full of trauma, Mari would tell him. Besides, he believes his talents would be more useful elsewhere. “More on the potions and pharmaceutical end of things, though.”
“Just…watch yourself. When Leon falls, he falls hard. I’d like not to be the one who has to catch him before he hits the ground this time. That’s all.”
McGonagall heaves a great breath. “We hope he finds a way to make contact with us before the Ministry finds him. Even then, I’m not sure there’s anything we can do, aside from convincing Draco to turn himself in.”
“Oh, no problem, my boy, my door is always open!” he says, standing up himself. He follows Draco over to the door and opens it for him, another pregnant pause between them. “Glad you’re back this year, Mister Malfoy,” Slughorn says, half through his teeth. Draco simply nods and gives him a small upward twitch of the lips, and with that, he’s gone.
Molly looks to Harry, apology all over her face. He smiles at her—if Bill isn’t even straight himself, Harry has no qualms about letting him know. “I’m dating a man,” he says.
“Ron, do you remember when Draco was almost killed towards the beginning of the string of strange accidents?”
“I’m worried about you,” she says, badly attempting to conceal her anger under the guise of concern.
“Oh, just Head Boy stuff,” he says unconvincingly. He could tell her, but that feels like a betrayal of McGonagall’s trust.
“Alright everybody, watch closely. The most effective way to use this spell is to add a sharp flick along with the incantation. Ready, Ron? 3, 2—“
Not even the sight of his own body—torn directly down the middle and on display on the large desk at the front of the room—is enough to bring him to his senses.
“We can just hex whoever’s there if they don’t want to give it up,” Ron says, only half-joking. Harry laughs to himself as they exit the classroom, Hermione explaining why it’s not morally permissible to go around hexing people for simply sitting in a public place.
delusional. I know what I saw, and people are going to get hurt. The sooner you swallow your fucking pride and admit your demented boyfriend is behind it, the sooner you can join me in reality and help put a stop to it.”
“Shit, I’m sorry,” says a familiar voice, and when Draco regains his footing and turns around, he sees Potter gathering up Draco’s things from the floor.
The entire Weasley family—sans Charlie, Bill, and Fleur—and Hermione are standing around the long kitchen table, a practical feast of breakfast foods steaming in heaping piles on the table. A banner stretches across the room that says ‘Happy Birthday Harry!’ and includes a few Snitches zipping between colorful bursting fireworks.
Despite the risk, Harry pulls Leon in for a quick side hug. “That sounds like a fantastic idea. Don’t let him cheat you in trades, though.”
Harry re-emphasizes his hand motion, insisting that Draco take the black band from him. Draco takes a step forward and takes it. And still, Harry is refusing to look away from Draco’s eyes. Again, is it in his head, or is there a tension that betrays relative normalcy?
It feels like a punch in the gut. But a warm one, a soft blow that wakes him up rather than knocking his lights out. Draco feels his face flushing, unsure of how much exactly Potter knows about his life.
Harry almost stumbles. His stance is wide, a finger pointing at Draco. “You’re lying. Why would you even say that?”
“Hey, thanks, Hermione,” he says, suddenly distracted by the fact that Ginny and Ron are talking to Leon. “By the way, did he just happen to find you, or—”
“Is there anything the Ministry can actually do to prosecute you in the meantime? And what about your mother, I’m sure the paper’s got it in for her as well?”
Harry’s face is still blazing as he exits his classroom, the red tint in his cheeks betraying him for the entirety of the class period. He had failed to conjure his own Patronus, the stag stubbornly trapped just behind the tip of his wand, the silver cervine form one he’d called forward so many times.
She drops her wooden spoon and points her wand at the breakfast, which freezes. The sizzling of sausage is cut off, silence ringing.
Luna’s hand twitches in his. “Nothing specific. She just needed to calm down, I think. Though I will admit, she’s a bit unhappy to be here.”
“Lord, I don’t even know where to begin…” Leon says, inhaling sharply. Harry stops walking, turning fully to him.
“I don’t really want to talk about the rest,” he says. There. That’s close enough to the truth. She knows that more occurred, but she doesn’t have to know
“No, I understand now. Not my place to police your reaction to something like that. Please, continue.”
in its truest form, so he just straightens Harry’s glasses and attempts (foolishly) to smooth down Harry’s hair. Draco takes his hand.
She shakes her head, moving past him to enter the classroom. “Don’t be silly, come in! You need to talk about something.” It isn’t a question.
“Your concealment charm needs work. I couldn’t be sure it was you, but it wasn’t worth investigating.”
“Oh, Mister Malfoy, I can’t forget to give you this.” She reaches into one of her drawers and hands him a Prefect badge, which he slips into his pocket for now. “Wear it well,” she says. She musters a smile as Draco thanks her.
“Just because I’ve settled down with a beautiful woman doesn’t make that any less true,” he singsongs as he takes her place in front of the eggs and waves a hand to unfreeze them. “Why are we talking about this, anyway?”
“I tried to stop them, but they wouldn’t listen to me. Since you’re older than seventeen, there isn’t much I can do to protect you under Hogwarts rules.”
McGonagall offers him a sympathetic look. “Mister Laurent is going to be taken to a mind healer. His whole family. They’ve decided to erase this chapter of their lives,” she says, cutting to the chase. “In their minds, the last few months will never have happened.” She shakes her head. “It’s not easy, I know. The two of you were close. But you must understand that his family has been through immeasurable trauma.”
. As if the culture against him wasn’t toxic enough. His fucking Patronus is a snake. Everybody—especially Draco—is suddenly and abnormally aware of the fact that Draco is the only Slytherin present.
“I’ll think about it,” Draco finally says. Now that it’s been brought up, there is something about that career path that seems inviting and fulfilling. Being given the chance to spend his life trying to help others in such a meaningful way? It feels like it could be a second chance, a way to rewrite all of his past wrongs.
She nods. “Fair point. You’re lucky you caught me in the library or I might’ve hexed you into next week.”
It’s this question and the pondering of what might happen to him should he actually pass out that swirls around him as his eyes do start to close, lids blocking out the expanse of color above him.
There’s a pop and a whoosh—that might actually just be the sound of oxygen rushing back into his lungs. He spins in a circle and looks down at this body; all of his limbs are still there. A drop of blood hits the floor and he swears. One of his fingernails didn’t survive the journey. A small price to pay. Like it had before, the house seems to come alive with his presence, and a sound like distant chimes sings from the walls as his blood seeps down into the carpet.
The trek up to the Hospital Wing feels long, belabored. Draco jumps at every noise, always ready to block whatever spell may be coming his way. His trust in his relative safety while in the castle has collapsed—what little of it was left, anyway. And Merlin knows what Harry’s told Leon about him. Would he be so stupid to confess to Leon that they’d had a moment, even if that moment involved Draco throwing accusations Leon’s way?
“THERE IS NO SITUATION,” Harry roars. Draco takes a step back, still quietly crying. Harry immediately regrets raising his voice; Draco can tell by the way his shoulders slump and his eyes soften and he takes a tentative step forward.
Part of him wants to be. Might it not be easier, not to feel it all anymore? To just surrender, let them take what they want? This thought is almost warming, almost cuts through the bone-chill that has every one of his hairs standing up. He could be done. He wouldn’t have to worry about what people think anymore, who he hurts along the way. It could all just be…over.
Harry and Ron exchange a look, half amused and half nervous, as they move to separate quadrants. Harry almost yelps as Madam Hooch suddenly pulls him aside.
“You know they’ll still worship you,” she says after a silence. “Your students, I mean. Nobody is delusional enough to think that the other professors are utterly perfect, and you’re not technically a professor.”
your reasons—they do nothing for either of us now. But I think we should just put it all behind us and start over.”
Not only has he managed to send himself to have a little nap in the wilderness, but he’s slept through the entire day of classes as well. Draco swears to himself as he rubs sleep out of his eyes and shakes grass out of his long hair.
thoughts. So easy. Draco lifts his wand and hopes Harry doesn’t notice that he’s trembling. He wracks his brain, filing through the relatively small stack of happy memories he has to choose from. It makes him nauseous that he has so much reorganization to do; so many of his fond recollections from Hogwarts involve fun at the expense of others. Friendship based on mutual hatred and nothing more. Pain for the sake of reinforcing power dynamics.
Harry nods and notices Ginny and Luna coming back toward the table. “Of course, I just need a second.”
Harry’s mind shuts down as he takes another weak step forward and fights the urge to empty his stomach into the lake of blood that soaks the bottom of his robes.
“I understand that the world is confusing right now. I still wake up unsure of how to move forward sometimes. But the fact of the matter is that time waits for nobody, and it will keep marching forward whether or not we come with it. If you ever need to talk about anything—”
Joetta is in hysterics in the Ravenclaw Common Room when Draco enters. A few sympathetic Ravenclaw girls and one boy as well are sitting around her, trying to calm her down. Others are not as willing to accommodate her grief and are shooting her dirty looks.
Slughorn twirls his mustache; Draco can tell he’s only pretending to think it over. He’d put anyone through
“We pulled some strings with McGonagall,” Mrs. Weasley had explained. “Hogwarts keeps every Snitch caught during Quidditch games, and this one was caught by your father,” she said, beaming.
“It does sound that way,” she says. “This isn’t exactly my area of expertise, I’ll admit. I’ve never worked with anybody who had questions about sexuality.”
Harry Potter didn’t have some influence on the sheer amount of interest. He tries to think rationally about the situation, knowing that he has the support of the likes of Kingsley, McGonagall, and Hermione (honestly, the most comforting of the three).
“Sweet Merlin,” she mutters as she rises. “If the two of you could just remain here, I’ll be back as soon as this is handled.”
Harry flies through the door, every inch of his body on fire. McGonagall is at her desk, scratching away at some parchment. She looks up as they barrel into the office.
scared me, because you’ve turned around so fiercely and so suddenly, and it was really confusing. So I defaulted to what I knew, to how I thought this relationship was supposed to work, even though I knew it was wrong. I dug my heels in. I recognize that now. But I’m so
She smiles and nods, taking a deep breath. “First of all, I want to say that I’m proud of you for telling me, and also that I’m honored you trust me enough to tell me.”
Draco’s arms are around Harry’s back now, first wrapped around solid shoulders, and then he allows them to rub down Harry’s back, over the swell of his arse. Harry grunts when Draco gives a squeeze; even Draco himself is surprised that he’d been so bold. This is all quite new to him. He’s had some fantasies, even a stray dream once or twice, but to actually be here, hands pressed against Harry Potter’s backside, blows every scenario he’s imagined out of the water. He doesn’t have much of a gauge for how an arse should feel, but Harry’s is pleasantly round and firm.
Harry bites his lip and looks at the ground. Something warm swells in Draco’s chest as he watches Harry think.
for telling me. But overall, you just… You can’t let the world stop spinning around you, even if it feels like it has.”
“Attention, everyone!” It’s Professor McGonagall, and judging by her terse visage, she’s about to deliver the news that Harry’s been sitting on like a hot dragon egg. Everybody turns toward her and Harry takes the opportunity to turn around and find Draco at the Slytherin table. To his surprise, Draco is already casting him a knowing look, which is capped with what feels like a rather intimate smile and a friendly nod. The weirdest part about it is that Harry feels like there’s some kind of
Draco reads the letter three, four times. He runs a hand over Artemis’ head as he does, unbothered by the little love nips she attempts.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione says, her face falling, and now he feels even worse because she was just having such a wonderful moment with Ron. Because nothing can ever be normal. “Let’s get you out of here, come on,” she says and pulls him out of the crowd.
“Let’s do it,” Draco says with a firm nod, feet planted in the carpet of the Potters’ living room. Everything is moving so quickly, but he’s leaning into this momentum so he doesn’t overthink the plan and back out.
She laughs, eyes still full of sympathy. “I’m Mari, by the way,” she says, holding out a hand. Draco takes it with the hand that isn’t clutching his abdomen. “Mari Mandal.”
Draco collapses on his bed. He’s sad to discover that Blaise’s side of the room is already entirely vacant. It doesn’t surprise him. Blaise was never wholly enthusiastic to come back to Hogwarts after the war. He was above it all, really, and Draco wonders if that feeling was justified. Blaise always did have a quiet, powerful intelligence about him. Maybe this will be good for him.
in a spiral, downward velocity increasing by the day. He regrets...everything. That’s it, the one emotion that’s been slowly making its way into the vesicles of his flesh, a virus reproducing. A wholehearted desire to change the way things happened.
“You’re certain this will work?” the lower voice says, sounding farther away. They must be going deeper into the dungeons.
Bill chuckles and places his hands on her shoulders. “Mum, please sit and eat,” he says and kisses her on the cheek.
“No, no, thank you Harry. You did very well, today, you know? Handled all of that with a lot of grace. Actually, now that I think of it, would you mind escorting Mister Malfoy here back into the real world?”
“Nothing,” Draco says cooly and picks at a hangnail. He usually takes such good care of his slender fingers, so even a minor wound is yet another source of frustration. “I’m just concerned about everything that’s going on, that’s all.”
“I’m Joetta, by the way. Joetta Winslow,” the older girl says suddenly. “And this is my brother, David.”
Ron’s face suddenly goes dark, worried, and at first Harry thinks it’s something he’s said, but he turns and follows Ron’s eyes over his shoulder. Ginny and Luna have come back into the common room but something is wrong; Ginny’s eyes are bloodshot and her makeup is smudged, her cheeks a violent red. Luna pats her arm and tries to guide her discreetly through the crowd, but heads rotate toward them anyway.
“Morning,” he says when he’s finished coughing up bits of bacon. “How’ve you been?” It’s been nearly two weeks since they’ve spoken.
Plus, he still needs to ask Molly if Draco might eventually join them. And delve into the myriad of questions that will inevitably conjure.
“How does this work, usually?” he asks as she leans against the front of the larger desk across from him. “Just…jump right in?”
“How could I?” the girl fires back, annoyance creeping into her inflection. “After all of the bullshit Slytherin House has wreaked at Hogwarts, I’d sooner go sleep with the Gryffindors.”
Draco swings his legs out of bed, cautiously getting to his feet. His muscles are stiff and sore, and suddenly having to support his weight puts even more strain on them. He grimaces as his knees start to buckle. Harry lurches forward, catching him under his arms and pulling him back up.
Draco looks at Harry, the color back in his skin, his mouth slightly open in his slumber. A stray splash of moonlight spills in through an arched window and stains his raven hair, droplets of silver scattered across Harry’s chest, rising and falling rhythmically. Harry, his key, the raft that rushed him off the desolate island inside himself he fled to.
Draco grins. It’s the closest thing he’s heard to humor from his roommate since coming back to Hogwarts.
When it comes down to it, he can’t seem to avoid the utterly bizarre wish that he was…Harry Potter’s friend.
Leon moves gracefully through the throng and in seconds Harry’s lost him and is instead presented with a rather morose Ginny.
“I’m serious,” Harry confirms. Leon kisses him and pulls away. He doesn’t say a word, but the look in his eyes is enough to set Harry’s whole body ablaze.
yourself right now? You need help, Draco, help that is so fucking beyond me I don’t even know what to say to you. I understand that I hurt you, and I’m sorry about that, but what you’re doing is
Harry groans and throws his head back, his hands covering his eyes. “I just don’t know if I can commit to teaching for a whole year. I still have to figure out what I want to
Harry smiles. “It won’t.” He kisses Draco on the cheek. “I’ll be right back. In the meantime, could you please clean up my kitchen? You’ve made a bit of a mess.”
glad that you managed to save his life. We’ve had too much tragedy as it is. But the repercussions of what you’ve done…Nobody knows what kind of effect this magic has on the user or the recipient. I’m worried about both of you.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says quickly. “It’s just. That’s. Anyway. Now, I don’t want this next thing to come across the wrong way, so bear with me.”
Harry is a very good support, and Draco finds that he’s glad he has Harry’s help. He’d always considered the other boy sort of scrawny and insignificant, but with his arm around Harry’s shoulders, he feels a sturdiness that he hadn’t been expecting.
He comes to the staircases in the midst of motion, eyes scanning the maze above him for the boy. Draco scowls when he doesn’t find him and concedes, not sure what his purpose was in following him in the first place. It’s with a mild itch at the back of his mind that he instead treks to his own room, dreading whatever blasted riddle he’ll have to answer simply to enter the common room. He’d asked the Ravenclaw Prefects if perhaps that specific bar might be lifted for the Slytherins, which was met with a question of his intellectual capability. Any outward complaining from Draco has since ceased.
The loneliness usually has a sort of crushing quality to it, like something that threatens his joints and drives his feet into the mud. But now, the last thing Draco wants is company. Despite the peppering of anxious thoughts that inevitably crop up, for the first time in a long time he feels an odd sort of calm. The palette of the sky is soft and inviting, begging Draco to just let his eyes close. Just for a few minutes, of course. If he falls asleep out here, he may very well wake up in the same spot the next morning. Who would even notice his absence? Blaise, perhaps, but Draco has doubts that his roommate would do anything about it.
The door closes and there’s an immediate shift. Draco hadn’t even realized that he was holding tension in his shoulders, in his chest, and it all seeps out of him and onto the grounds of Hogwarts. He feels lighter, more himself.
He stretches, swings his legs out of the covers, and rises, crossing to the window to study the world. It’s the same lawn he’s always known with its patchy grass and incessant gnome issues, but lately everything feels different. Even the thick layer of disgruntled clouds is more silver lining than chance of rain. A strange sense of peace, even hope, sits light in his stomach, though he feels as though anxiety should be the primary emotion of the morning. Not that he’s complaining. He’ll take this unidentifiably sourced optimism over fear any day.
Harry collapses back onto his pillow, but his heart stops when he hears a shaky breath from beside him.
“I mean, you remember how it is even adding one new person to a team. They have to adjust at their own pace. So now multiply that by seven…”
knows that. So I’m just wondering what the point is. It feels like it’s some kind of setup for a joke about being a blood traitor or something.”
“He is quite cute,” Ginny says, finally thawing out a bit. “It’s going to take some time for me to fully adjust. But I can tell you two are happy together. And I do appreciate you trusting me with this. So, you really are gay? Fully?”
When the whistle blows, Harry shoots into the sky like he never has. Sure, he’d played some bollocks rounds at the Burrow, but nothing beats the wide open sky that the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch has to offer. For a second he forgets he’s technically in the middle of a tryout as he zips around, loving the balanced speed and control of his new broom. It isn’t until a Bludger whizzes dangerously close to his face that he remembers his role.
“You wouldn’t happen to have any more of that salve, would you?” Madam Pomfrey asks, joining them by the bed.
SO. Hello everyone! It's been a couple months since I worked on this. I was finishing up my senior thesis for undergrad (which I successfully defended about a week ago!!) and have been trying to adjust to/cope with my last semester being completely uprooted and moved to online. It's definitely been strange, and for a while I wasn't feeling much motivation to write, which is totally ok and something that was unfortunate but navigable. Most importantly, I'm back in the swing of things with this particular story! It had been so long that I felt a little bit out of the loop with my own fic so I had to go back and reread everything to remember where I was going with it, lol.
She hums and looks back at the page. “Oh. Emotional mirroring,” she reads, her voice far off. “I’m not sure, though I have a
Draco looks around at the single pan he used to cook his bacon and taps his palm against Harry’s cheek. “You’re lucky you’re attractive, Potter.”
Leon nods. “Of course I have! And that must be Hermione Granger talking to Gabrielle?” he asks, gesturing to them. Harry nods, making to get her attention, but Leon stops him.
“I’m close personal friends with the Minister,” he says casually, like that’s just another data point. “And you have a small army of respected voices behind you. Dumbledore, McGonagall, Ron and Hermione—”
“Right, something like that.” Harry suggests this partially because it makes sense to him to work chronologically, but also because he would rather get the discussion of his missteps out of the way.
She looks up at the ceiling, her head lolling back onto her shoulders. “Harry, you’re a very humble person, and that’s admirable. But you’re like one of those stars up there. You’re so pretty from far away, and the greater picture around you is alluring, but it’s deceiving. If you get too close, there’s no way to ignore the heat you put off. It’s not all bad, but…you just
That’s why he’s so confused about why he’d run from Leon. About why he’s been avoiding him. Shutting him out completely. And why it hurts
But then again, Leon is dangerous and holding hands with Harry. Again, Draco is torn, both grateful that Harry is still willing to be friends after everything that’s happened and crushed that it’s not his fingers between Harry’s.
The hallways are practically deserted. Draco guesses that the word of this new incident has spread quickly and people either escaped to the supposed safety of their own rooms or chose to be outside on this beautiful September afternoon. Plus, it’s Friday. The first week of class is finished, students are likely out on the grounds relaxing and celebrating things being normal again. Draco wishes he could relate.
“Regardless,” Blaise continues, “I’m just saying I care more about the continuation of our house then I do about something as trivial as blood status.”
His stomach gurgles at him expectantly and he sighs, looking down at it. He’s always been thin, but looking at the way his robes are wearing him more than the other way around, he realizes that food has become fairly low on his priority list these days. Unfortunately, something else has to win again. Maybe he’ll grab a bite after sorting out his missed work.
He figures that Potter had been expecting the same old. A classic Draco smirk with a perfectly practiced amount of disgust and patronization. But that wasn’t his intention, and he’d ventured something more understated. Cordial, even. The innocent bystander might just assume they were vaguely acquainted classmates, and it was in the subtlety that Draco hit his mark.
“Yeees? Are you just realizing this? Have you not noticed my accent? Or the fact that Bella and I speak almost exclusively French?”
It isn’t until they’re almost done that he remembers Leon is there. He almost slips off his broom when it hits him. He looks down into the stands and sees that he’s no longer focused on work but following the drills with real interest, his eyes shining against the overcast sky. At one point, he looks Harry’s way and his smile is visible even from so high up. Harry offers a little wave.
Draco stops them just outside the doorway; though they have the Cloak, he still feels odd standing in the room. They listen from beside the entrance, up against the wall.
And then there’s the matter of the culprit. Draco is about to lift his concealment charm and vacate the premises when Leon emerges. He’s pale, clammy.
Draco snorts, then gasps as she starts to spray cold water all over his head. The sharp clink of scissors sounds from behind him as she opens and closes the shears a few times.
? And you heard her, somebody going down there is likely what lead to all of this mess in the first place. We don’t know what we’re dealing with, so we should just let the Aurors reseal the dungeons and conduct their investigation without interruption.”
He’s buzzing. Floating. Living. In this moment, everything is pure light on a newfound horizon. Everything is golden.
“As you know, I, myself am learning as I go,” Hooch continues. “This is an exciting new twist on our tradition, and I am greatly honored to be part of it and excited to see what’s in store. That being said, and in keeping to that tradition, we will have four teams in total!”
Harry groans and slams his head down on the table, a bang echoing through the library. Hermione giggles but shushes him.
“Er, like I said, that’s something we can work on down the line, as it’s more advanced than what I’m expecting for this first lesson. Cheers to you two, though, for going above and beyond. Now, left side, time for your revenge. Make sure everybody gets their wand back, that’s it… All right, ready?”
She shrugs. “Start wherever you need to, and I’m sure we’ll be able to figure out where to go from there.”
He shrugs. “We didn’t get there until things had escalated in both cases, so we didn’t get much backstory. It was less about words being exchanged than jinxes, but I think at least the first one was about Quidditch. During the second one a window broke and someone stunned someone else’s owl accidentally...” He trails off, giving Draco a strange look. It’s as if Potter’s suddenly realizing exactly who it is he’s babbling to. “Well, er, I better be off, then.” He say this almost like a question.
“I’m very appreciative, Narcissa,” Kingsley says. “You’ve been an admirable host given the circumstances.”
The force of the suction is so strong that he launches past the center of the hole, uses the momentum to cut through the air on the right side of the room. When he lands next to Ginny, the blood pooled around her head makes his eyes fuzz over for a moment, but he can see that she’s still breathing.
“Seeing you so in your element somehow allowed me to look past all of the bad blood between us. It’s obvious you’re passionate about it and you have the necessary skillset. Plus, it would be a way to arm future generations of witches and wizards against danger without ever putting your life directly on the line. So yes, it does seem obvious to me. You’re quite good at it, too. And I wouldn’t just say that.”
Draco clutches his pillow closer to his chest. After being denied, he came right back to his room, put on pajamas, and crawled into bed. Cried a bit. That’s been happening a lot recently. Now, he’s considering going to bed. Yes, it’s still only early in the evening yet, but he’s certain he could sleep forty-eight hours straight at this point.
Harry hasn’t given much thought to them. Maybe it’s arrogant, but he knows he has nothing to worry about. He’ll likely be on a team no matter what.
“Because you deserve it, and I didn’t feel like being acting Prefect anymore on top of everything. And you’ll do a good job.”
Harry wraps an arm around Draco’s waist and gives him a little squeeze. “Hear that? You’re human, after all,” he whispers in Draco’s ear. In return, Draco prods him in the ribs.
Harry sidles up to him in the back of the room. “I’ve got you,” he murmurs. People are still excited about new pairings and not paying much attention. Just as well, because Draco’s cheeks threaten to flush pink at the sound of Harry’s words. The way they echo Draco’s own words bouncing off cold dungeon walls. Again, all he can do is nod.
Harry looks around at the rest of his team. He smiles at Jimmy Peakes, one of the Beaters from his team during sixth year. He gives Jimmy a reassuring nod.
Harry nods, rubbing a hand across his face. “I understand your hesitation to trust me. No really, I do. But if we’re going to take this team to the end, you’re going to need to have at least a little faith, here.”
Draco flops face-first onto his bed. He wants to hex himself. That was the moment, surely, no? Not that Harry seems the type to pull such a classic I’m-going-to-come-up-behind-you move (although, Draco is starting to question his view of Harry altogether), but that’s exactly what it had been, wasn’t it?
Ginny, whose arms and legs are crossed and whose body is angled away, merely gives him an annoyed look. Leon chuckles but when Harry looks at him, he just shrugs.
Whatever crack had formed in the wall between them feels like it’s giving way, all of the things that were unsaid flowing through with abandon. Draco’s pulse hammers in his throat, in his wrists, and his fingers tremble. Is he forgiven? Has Harry realized the truth of who Leon is, what he’s doing?
Draco’s eyes sting. The aroma of smoke hangs heady in the air, the room warm and cozy. “Do you really think I’ll make it out of this?”
Harry can’t help but smile as each pair gets into position, a look of intense concentration painted on every face. Something comes over him when he teaches: a fierce desire to see each person succeed.
Thinking back, Harry remembers how he’d emerged from the house to a very concerned Ron and Hermione, who’d been unable to enter, no matter how hard they tried. He’s never had Hermione’s brains, but the answer seems obvious enough.
“Finally, we will be offering counseling services to any student who feels they might like to take advantage of that. If anybody is interested, I ask that they be in contact with me by means of letter and we can continue from that point. This service will be completely free and the schedule of sessions will be completely up to you. In addition, I can assure you that all of our staff members are here to support you in whatever ways we can. Hogwarts has gone through a horrible, horrible battle and while we admire your bravery, you still are young people and our future. We’d like to make sure that you’re each coping well with the recent events and this is our main priority, especially in the first few months back.”
Harry gives those words a moment to seep into his brain. The world around them is so forgiving and cheerful. The grass is green and lush, some of the leaves on the trees are already starting to brown, still a week shy of October. The grounds are fairly empty. Most students are already starting to feel their knees buckle under the stress of assignments and exams and social lives and extracurricular activities.
“First off, a lot of it was luck. I was in the right place at the right time, and I did the right thing. The fact that the Hogwarts way is to blow every piece of news well out of proportion happened to work in my favor. But really, things started changing when I decided I wanted them to, Pansy. I’ve started seeing a therapist.”
“At first it seemed a little over the top,” Leon admits with a guilty sideways glance at Harry, “but there’s something exciting about the drama of it all, isn’t there?”
She shrugs quickly and bites at one of her nails. “He’s already broken one of the most fundamental rules by Disapparating on Hogwarts grounds. Plus, we never could figure out to the full extent how the Room of Requirement works. I would say…it’s possible, but not plausible.”
Draco finally forces his feet to move and he presses his fingertips to his temples, rubbing gently. Where had it
It’s safe to say it had been the worst of his life, second only to the beginning of this one, perhaps. But things have taken a drastic turn in only a month. Draco from sixth year would never believe where he ends up, that the same boy who tore him open could be the one to stitch him together.
Her face has gone strikingly neutral, and the lack of reaction is doing nothing for his debilitated nerves.
He gives up on his hair, trying to flatten it one more time with his hand as he returns the comb to his and Ron’s shared room. Ron is gone, the clothes he’d slept in thrown haphazardly onto his bed. Harry puts the comb away and takes a minute to at least give his side the appearance of being organized, and once satisfied starts to head downstairs. The lack of noise in the usually lively house is mildly disconcerting, but the smell of bacon wafting up the stairs is enough to quell his worries.
“Tell everyone I say hello,” Draco says, his throat tightening. He’s nearly forgotten the severity of the situation, and such a request feels inappropriately mundane. Still, Harry nods and runs a thumb over Draco’s left cheekbone.
Harry runs his finger along the pattern of the duvet. “I still don’t know how to feel. Processing it hasn’t really been a priority.”
The castle is downright eerie; most of the torches on the walls are extinguished, corridors vacant and echoey. Though it’s only morning, much of the castle sits in darkness. Not even the ghosts are out and about, which Draco finds especially odd.
Draco hums, resting his chin in his palm. He can tell Blaise is curious about who this mystery man is, and is appreciative that he hasn’t asked. And then he looks at Blaise, who is glancing in the way of the Gryffindor table.
Draco pauses, some kind of war waging behind his eyes. Harry hasn’t seen him up close recently and suddenly realizes there
to happen, but I need you to stop following me around like this. We have to work together, but that’s it, alright? I’m sorry that I somehow made you think otherwise, but that was
“Shit. Well, now that I’ve all but confirmed it, could the two of you just do your best to shut it down if you hear it from anyone else? McGonagall is still putting together an official statement, but it’s a right mess.”
Granger huffs and grabs the two boys by their arms. “Let’s just go, then,” she sighs, pulling Potter and Weasley (who graciously displays his middle finger) with her.
Another twist of his insides. Something about the knowledge of Leon’s presence in the class makes him even more nervous, as if he has something to prove to him. Not that he doesn’t feel that way about everybody else; there are clearly high expectations for Harry due to the short amount of time it took for both classes to fill up. Although, that could also be due to the fact that people like Defense Against the Dark Arts regardless of who’s teaching it. But it would be naive to dismiss the idea that his being
The irony of that. There’s no evidence against Draco and he’s certain there will be a social rebellion against his existence, but if he tried to bring his knowledge of Leon’s involvement to counter the allegations, he would be shut down immediately because of Leon’s ties to the wonderful Harry Potter. It makes his blood boil, the way justice is evading him, but if he doesn’t time everything correctly, Draco knows it will all blow up in his face.
Blaise nods, sitting back on his own bed. “I’m really sorry, Draco. If it means anything, I believe you, and I’ll have your back if it comes down to it.”
Harry’s stomach rotates at the thought of that. It wan’t his intention, but the idea is suddenly tantalizing. Still, he says, “No, I just meant your head. Trust me,” he adds upon seeing that Leon’s doubt has not dissolved.
Harry smiles to himself as Crookshanks finally catches the gnome he’d been chasing. Quiet footsteps approach the room and Harry turns to the door, which slowly swings open.
When things have settled, Draco takes a deep breath, trying to stop his head from spinning. He’s grateful to still be in bed, as he feels faint, and quite feels like crying himself for some reason. His throat is sore from the effort of not allowing himself too. That would be foolish. Everything is fine now.
He tries hard not to hold his breath, tries to exhale his pain as solid rock continues to crawl and crush. All cognitive function has ceased, his only thoughts
The door opens and Harry clutches his sheets, sucks in a breath through his teeth. Professor McGonagall pokes her head in. She makes eye contact with Harry and the terse expression on her face melts away, worry flowing out of her with a sigh of relief.
Draco swallows, his throat going sore from how hard he’s trying not to cry. “Who is it?” he asks, and his voice is small, broken.
“Does that make any sense at all?” he asks. Draco sees that Harry is blushing as he scratches the back of his neck.
“Oh. Yes. That is what I was getting at. Truthfully, I still don’t really know what’s going on between the two of us. You’re the first person who knows about it, actually…”
Harry’s whole body vibrates with rage, waves of shuddering anxiety rolling over him, a sea of broken glass. This can’t be happening, not after what he’s been through, everything he’s already given.
bloody term he takes potions, he swears). He knows Slughorn is going to give him top marks regardless of the content, but that being said, there needs to be content for that to happen.
Harry’s heart jumps in his chest and his mouth goes a bit dry. “Oh?” he says, trying to sound casual.
He hears Blaise sigh, then their door opens and closes. Draco fights the urge to cry again as he reflects on the disastrous previous fifteen minutes of his life, his gut clenching at the question of what happens next. The sudden added insecurity regarding the future really makes him terrified to leave his room, even though he’d joked about it.
Harry forces his mouth shut. “Hi.” Draco’s cheeks are a blotchy pink from flying around in the cool air, and he’s smiling. And his hair is in a fucking bun.
Molly sits and everybody serves themselves, the various Weasleys’ absences definitely felt. George is off working on something (which Ron
“Well, perfect. Very happy to have you on board, Mister Malfoy. Hopefully people’s attitudes will adjust over the next few weeks. There isn’t much I can do in terms of public address at the moment, but I think this new appointment will be enough to make the appropriate waves.”
Hermione sighs, still grinning. “I just think it’s nice that you’re making a new friend, that’s all,” she says.
“I’m…fine…for now…” Draco says between breaths. He forces himself to slow down and takes a few long, deep breaths and feels his pulse evening out some. “Now, before I explain, please,
; Draco has been tailing him for five minutes. Not only has Leon been utterly predictable in his destination, but he’s also failed to notice that someone has been following. Granted, Draco had also been lurking when he discovered Leon was doing the same. But that was more out of morbid curiosity than ill will. The idea of going to Hogsmeade on his own is not exactly an appealing one, and what’s his alternative? Go with Blaise and Pansy, who now seem to be spending all their time together? Or join the Potter crew? That’s not likely to work out in his favor.
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry says as he enters and takes the chair nearest the fire where Kingsley must have previously been. “Sorry to startle you.”
“Alright, let’s all get settled in then, make sure you introduce yourself to your neighbor, good, good, there you go. Now!… Let the feast begin!”
“Why are you doing this, Harry?” she asks, exasperated. “Why does everything have to be so complicated all the damn time?”
Draco shrugs. “I figured I might as well. Wouldn’t want to be missing out on something...different,” he drawls, careful not to say anything specifically positive.
“Well, anyway, Mum’s sent me up to tell you dinner’s almost ready, so you should wash up and come downstairs.” And with that, she’s gone again, the door swinging shut behind her.
“Please, don’t be. It’s over now. He won’t even remember me when his mind healing is complete.” It hurts, should hurt more, Harry thinks, but he’s already scraping the bottom of his emotional barrel, coming up with measly despondent droplets.
Harry pauses. “It was a good direction for everybody else. I don’t know if anyone ever stopped to consider that I never wanted any of that.”
“I’d imagine so. And if you ever want to talk about something and work it through, I’d be more than willing to listen.”
“I think that’s enough practice for today,” Harry finally says. His voice is tight and a notch higher than usual, as if he can feel the same level of pressure that’s nested between Draco’s lungs.
in the past, seven days doesn’t exactly offer the kind of space required to heal from that experience.
visitation.” Madam Pomfrey’s voice is a snap and Draco nearly takes a step back, his mouth hanging open.
“All of it.” Looking into his eyes is staring into a mirror underwater; Harry is overcome with the urge to sob, to wail, to cry until his body dries up and floats away. “I’m so sorry,” Draco says, his voice breaking as he looks away from Harry, buries his head in his pillow.
things, just to survive the nightmare. I had to sacrifice parts of who I was to stay alive, and I still don’t really know how to deal with that. I feel like a completely different me after everything. But what you said at the beginning, about how it felt right at the time and so it must have been right… Leon, you did everything you could to try to save her. What you did made a difference, whether or not you feel like it did. Losing someone is hard. And losing two people at the same time like that is impossible. You can’t put all of the blame on yourself, it’s just going to keep breaking you down like this.”
“For the last time, we are the Death Pixies! Have an incredible year!” the singer shouts as the final song starts up, a rowdy, peppy song that everybody around them knows. They jostle their way through the crowd, Harry’s head spinning. He wants to disappear, to run like Leon had.
“Isn’t it better to have a target for this kind of thing?” asks the Weasley girl. Ginny. She does have a first name, and Draco does know it.
Before he can say anything Mrs. Weasley is upon him, kissing his forehead. “Happy birthday, dear,” she says, her voice quivering slightly.
“Yeah, um. Fine. She’s...McGonagall’s asked if I’ll be Head Boy,” he says, suddenly feeling guilty. It had been Ron and Hermione who had been made Prefects during their fifth year, and he wonders if that position might’ve gone to Ron had Harry not just saved the entire Wizarding world. He remembers just how mad he’d been when he found out he wasn’t made a Prefect himself, and now Head Boy is right in front of him and it just feels wrong. There’s a brief silence, one of mixed emotion. Harry grimaces when Hermione gives him a weak smile and he looks down. “Luna’s been chosen as Head Girl,” he mutters, the guilt doubling.
Harry holds it in his hands now, still laying in bed and listening to the birds calling in the morning. It’s odd, being able to sleep with windows open again, no longer afraid that even a small crack in the defense could crumble the entire Order. He allows the Snitch to buzz around his head lazily, grabbing it and setting it free again every so often, careful not to damage the winds. He’d always known his father was good at Quidditch, but he himself couldn’t imagine playing two positions in one game.
we break up? What if I’m suddenly single again? After you asked me to that dance, it forced me to see what I was trying so hard to block out.”
right?” she finally says. She looks at Harry, then to Leon, and finally Luna, who just shakes her head.
“Fantastic,” Harry says. He turns to Bill to ask what he’s doing at the Burrow, but Bill’s a step ahead of him.
“Not bad,” she responds, her mellow tone somehow perceptible even in the chaos. “I would’ve liked to sit with the Gryffindors.”
Harry blinks spots and tears out of his eyes. “You were there?” He wasn’t even aware that Dumbledore had a portrait in the Potters’ home.
Draco stands and watches her disappear all of the items she’d conjured. “You really are very talented,” he concedes. She turns to him and nods. “I know.” Somehow it’s free of arrogance and instead just confident, sure.
“Okay. Perfect. Great. So we both have a support system, then. I think it’s important that we don’t rely on just each other for everything. We’ll have to communicate with each other, I’m not saying that isn’t true. But it’s good to have a friend in your corner who isn’t the other person.”
"I suppose that’s all we can ask for,” she says with a sigh. She’s clinging to the podium, her knuckles white. Harry grabs a chair from the closest table and places it behind her, motioning for her to sit.
In a last ditch effort, he conjures up a happy memory—he has to dig deep for it—and manages to utter “Expecto Patronum” through gritted teeth. He’s unable to conjure one fully formed;
Against all odds, I have allowed this chapter to flow out of me like MAGIC. I'm working with no outline from here on out which is very scary and new for me but I think it will allow me to take some fun risks and allow the story to go where it needs to :)
Take care of yourself, Harry. Everybody else is going to be just fine, and now you need to make sure that you’re going to be fine, too.
Leon smiles at him, his eyes twinkling. “I don’t blame you. There are so many twists and turns. And those moving staircases?” He laughs, shaking his head. “I can’t even imagine how easy it is to lose yourself here.”
Dumbledore chuckles and takes a moment to examine the look on Harry’s face. “I see now. We spoke briefly and Draco updated me on some important matters, but I daresay he neglected to mention the full extent of your relationship.”
“Everything okay?” Leon asks as Harry approaches. Not sure why, Harry grabs Leon’s arm and gently pulls him along, gesturing for Ron and Hermione to follow.
“Not now,” she clarifies. “And I know you have tryouts today. But afterward, you and I are sitting down and we’re talking about…you know.” She glances at Leon, whose forehead is practically touching his parchment. Harry feels his insides twist at that, trying to avoid his face from heating up.
Harry exhales deeply and looks back toward the Slytherin table. He makes eye contact with Leon, who smiles gently and continues on with the conversation he’s having. Again, Harry feels something inside him flip upside down. It’s brief, but now that he’s more tuned in, he feels the closest comparison would be the adrenaline of battle. Fight or flight. Toned down a hundred times, but the same general lurching sensation. Is there something about this Leon guy that only his subconscious mind is picking up on? Surely he can’t be dangerous if Madame Maxime trusts him to be their liaison.
Draco turns the heat up yet again, watching his cauldron closely. Ironic that something intended to heal burns requires so much heat.
“Our Slytherins,” McGonagall continues, directing her speech toward their table, “will be spending some time in Ravenclaw Tower, as the dungeons are currently in disarray and are not suitable for living. I assure that things will be sorted out soon, but in the meantime I’m sure we can all learn to get along.
“At least the same can’t be said about Defense,” Harry says. He really had been impressed with Draco’s work that day.
A second passes, then all eyes snap somewhere else. Anywhere else. The room is dead silent save for the legs of desks scraping across stones.
“Harry? Are you alright?” Hermione asks quietly, trying not to draw too much attention away from the story Ron is telling to everyone. He blinks, realizing he’d been staring down at his plate.
“I do,” Harry says with a dopey grin. “I really do. I’m just making sure you know what you’re getting into. As much as I’ve tried to reach some kind of normal, it’s become pretty clear to me that normal is not in the cards for me.”
His breath hitches as Leon reaches for the bottom of his shirt, fingers curling around fabric and dragging it upward. It feels like it’s happening in slow motion, or maybe Leon is just going slowly, but his eyes never leave Leon’s body. Harry’s chest expands and warms; Leon’s arms are over his head, exposing his underarms, his chest, which is adorned with a patch of hair that’s the color of cornsilk and looks twice as soft.
“Overwhelmed?” she guesses. “You have every right to be. Like I said, some mistakes require more serious penance. And I’m sure there are some people who will never be able to shed their perceptions of you, people who don’t have it in them to forgive. But Draco, that’s not your problem. It’s theirs. When all is said and done, that war forced a lot of people to do things they didn’t want to do. Out of necessity, confusion, fear, even just pure survival. At this point, I still don’t know your side of things, but I’m sure there are others out there who would relate to your truth.”
“No use,” she fires back, disappointed. “That wouldn’t work until the fire is out, and there isn’t enough to cover his whole body!”
She backs away immediately as Ron shoots out of bed, scrambling for his wand. When he realizes his surroundings, he exhales and flops back onto the messy covers.
Down in the kitchen Molly bustles about, preparing a breakfast. Harry is shocked to find that she’s not alone; Bill sits at the table, feet up on a pulled-out chair.
Draco isn’t an idiot. Leon has never particularly liked him, has never gone out of his way to be anything more than cordial, but there’s an acid in his voice.
Leon walks alongside him, not letting up. “So you’re really just going to keep avoiding this conversation? I’ve been trying to talk to you for a week now, and every time you just shut down.”
Harry falls into a seat, stunned. He’s glad Dumbledore continues to speak, because he is genuinely lacking any words to describe how he’s feeling, has no idea what question to ask next.
“First of all, I think your life being broadcasted so publicly all the time is a double-edged sword. Yes, I’ve seen the immense harm that can do, especially to a young person, and I’ve seen all of the pain that the world has not only witnessed but
. He tries to snap himself out of it as he nears the Quidditch pitch, slapping his own cheek to bring him back to the lush green grass under foot, the cloudy blue sky above. Maybe he’ll explore it eventually. But not now. There’s just too much going on, and so much has already changed. He doesn’t need another essential shift to come in and shake up his whole foundation now that he’s had to rebuild it so carefully.
—Draco can move on to the next priority: Leon. Because he’d been watching closely all evening. That was his job, was it not? The boy who’s already aroused so much suspicion in him seemed a worthwhile target for surveillance, and Draco would be an idiot to ignore the fact that Leon ran out of the hall in tears and minutes later, a swarm of Dementors arrived.
“I said you were right. Would you like me to repeat it again or are your comprehension skills not what I remember?”
Before Harry can even start to feel lost by their conversation, there’s suddenly another person in front of him. This boy is about a head shorter, his eyes sparkling amber and his blond hair somewhere between curly and floppy, endearingly messy.
!” and sending Ron’s wand flying to the back of the classroom. Ron’s face falls as the classroom is filled with the sound of his wand clattering to the floor followed by some light clapping and more murmuring. Hermione rolls her eyes and mutters “
It’s a familiar sight: the same stretch of hallway where he’d seen a girl attacked not too long ago, Leon looking around, clearly paranoid. Guilty.
“Some of you maybe already know exactly what your Patronuses are. I know some of you worked with me back when Dumbledore’s Army was meeting. But I assume most of you haven’t ever had the need to actually use the spell?”
Finally, he collects himself and stands up. He makes to leave and almost runs headfirst into Hermione.
The spell catches him square in the chest, so hard his heart stops beating for a moment. There are tendrils in his mind, yanking, ripping it apart. He might be writhing on the ground, he might be climbing the walls, he’s not sure. He’s fought off the curse before but he’s already off guard, unstable. Veins strain in his neck as he resists, eyes bulging from their sockets, and even as Rowan’s voice echoes like a bomb in his brain, a plan forms, a way out, to flip the script.
Harry and Draco go their separate ways, Draco to get some lunch and Harry to pay the sun another visit and remind himself of what it feels like to just exist.
Harry directs them toward the violent tree and finds himself alone with Eva. They exchange a look and then proceed into the castle.
“Draco, I…I miss you,” she says. His stomach lurches when Pansy’s voice breaks. “And I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said a little while back…”
He feels at home here, despite the fact that the regular Potions dungeon is still off-limits and they’ve been placed in a smaller room on the other side of the castle. There aren’t too many students approaching a Potions-oriented career, so what might otherwise feel cramped is somewhat cozy and relaxed.
Is he going crazy, or is there an edge to Harry’s voice? There’s a slight waver that scrapes against Draco’s nerves.
be investigated,” he says, turning back to McGonagall. “I’m not sure what reason you would have to aid and abet a war criminal, but if it is discovered that you somehow had knowledge as to how Malfoy escaped, trust that not even your proximity to the Minister will allow you to slip through the justice system.”
“Whatever the case may be, I’ll cover for you the best that I can. And if luck is on our side, nobody will ever have to find out and whatever you did ends here.”
He’s must be in someone’s bedroom. It’s void of any personality: a bed with a maroon duvet, two wall sconces that look like they haven’t been lit in years, a desk, an empty bookshelf covered in dust.
The cohort begins to move, almost simultaneously, as soon as McGonagall is gone. Ron plants a kiss on Hermione’s forehead, Luna pats Ginny on the back, and Leon discreetly slips his hand into Harry’s. Draco can see there’s a tension there; could Harry be reconsidering what Draco had tried to confess?
Harry blinks at him. “Right, you still don’t know me all that well. Planning isn’t much my thing. I tend to jump in and figure things out as I go.”
Ron shrugs. “I’m just not convinced that they’re any less slimy than they were before the war, that’s all. He deserves to know!”
He suddenly feels Hermione’s eyes on him, probably wondering what he could possibly be reading still.
“Luna, would you like to go for a walk?” Leon says cheerfully as he stands. “There are a couple of things we should probably discuss regarding the situation in the castle.”
“Just…” Harry starts, purposely bringing his voice down, “stay away from me. I don’t want you in my life anymore. Not right now. What you just did…” Harry shakes his head and turns away, bringing a hand to his eyes. Draco’s heart drops when he sees that Harry is crying now, too.
“Come in,” he says as gently as he can as he unbuttons his shirt. Blaise didn’t do anything wrong, after all. “I get that it’s a polite thing, but you really don’t have to—”
As he cleans up the rest of his station, Draco’s mind once again wanders to the Defense class from the previous day. The way he’d meandered through his assignment, waiting to be the last person in the room so he could have a moment to speak with Potter. He has to admit, it has been interesting so far seeing him in a teaching setting. He’s very direct, if somewhat awkward, and the first class had made Draco rethink his notions about “simple” spells like Expelliarmus.
He whips around to find Mari, a curious and amused smile on her face. “Didn’t mean to frighten you, sorry about that!”
. Well—kisses, plural, really. His lips tingle at the thought, that at any given moment he could lean in and do it again. And again. Again.
Harry narrows his eyes for a second, then flicks Draco in the arm. “Don’t get a big head about it. Git.” But he’s smiling, perfect teeth gleaming. “Leon was incredibly important to me.
allow himself to garner more attention in the wake of the news about his fucking father, that son of a bitch. He’s been working through
“I still don’t fully get how all of this happened,” Ron admits. “I mean, things were going so well with Leon, right? It’s not his fault that some second-rate fanatic took over his mind and used him to try to destroy Hogwarts.”
He stands. “I think you will,” he says, managing a small grin. He crosses to the door, reaching for the handle when she speaks again.
Harry blinks, his eyes stinging. It’s clear that Hermione is having some influence on Ron, more than she ever did when they were just friends. Another part of it is just the fact that all three of them have changed. The world is so different now, and they’re starting to think about their futures. It’s exciting but sad to think that they’re really starting to grow up.
There’s a look in Harry’s eyes—deep green shimmers in the cosmic light filtering into the Hospital Wing—that tells Draco he wants to talk about what happened, about the thing between them they’ve been orbiting for almost ten years.
Draco rolls his eyes, going back to his eggs. He’d never known Blaise to buy into conspiracies—especially ones started by first years.
“Personally,” Weasley says, a bit obnoxiously, “I think people will be too busy wetting their pants over being in the same room as Harry sodding Potter to care about
“Likewise! Please, come in,” she says and opens the door wider. “I hope you don’t mind beanbag chairs. The desks that are in here are so uncomfortable and not really conducive to counseling. And my conjuring magic is a bit rusty since I left school, so beanbags are really all I can do.”
