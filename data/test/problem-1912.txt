She leads him down the hallway. Harry recognizes the faint ripple of long-standing protective magic that lingers over the rusted bars of the cells. Some inmates are curled up on their rusted cots in ratty blankets, fast asleep; others are pacing back and forth, and stare at Harry with wide, blood-shot eyes as he passes. Each and every single one of them looks absolutely shocked to see him, and one woman (short and emaciated and unremarkable save a shock of wavy red hair) covers her mouth with a wet gasp when they lock gazes.
He reaches out, draws one finger along the ink. It’s old enough that the skin is not especially sensitive to the touch, but fresh enough that its bright colors are stark against alabaster skin. It’s lovely.
He glances up, half expecting one of the maids dropping by to ask after his health (he has the feeling Harry instructed them to be particularly diligent) or ask if they can clear some of the fumes. To his surprise, he sees only Harry’s pregnant friend, smiling hesitantly at him.
“So you’ve decided that hearing me voice treasonous thoughts is the right time instead?” Theo asks, wringing his hands together.
Draco looks a vision in the gentle sunlight, pale and golden amongst the bright greens and reds of their surroundings. He always smiles when he catches Harry staring at him, and once he’s done eating, scoots close enough to rest his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“I’ve listened to you talk,” Harry says, watching intently as Viktorovich pulls himself back up. “Are you ready to duel?”
The world is spinning as Harry pulls him up into his arms. Draco tries to kiss him, but he misses his mouth completely, leaving a print of his lips on one of Harry’s lenses. It’s better than nothing.
“First, the people that did it. A few have stepped forward and claimed responsibility, but it’s obvious they had help. This was a planned, coordinated, and timed attack. The person who claimed to have put it all together is a man named Fred Weasley.”
A laugh punches itself out of his chest. Scorpius grins. Then they’re all sharing breathless chuckles under the comforting weight of the cloak.
This chapter gave me capital T trouble! I finally hit some story beats I was excited to reach so I hemmed and hawed about how I wrote a lot of those moments. I hope this final product is worth it, because if I look at this chapter for much longer I may scream. You know the drill. I'll scoop up my craziest mistakes when I feel like less of a zombie.
So, of course, Draco is not expecting the Dark Lord himself to sweep into their quarters with no prior announcement. Draco thinks it’s Harry at first--the wards protecting their quarters are configured to admit only the two of them, and the sound of the various locks undoing themselves in their incredibly specific order is familiar by now.
Hermione puts a gentle hand on his arm. He shakes roughly out of her grasp, and she backs away with a hurt look, biting her bottom lip. Ginny slings an arm around her shoulders, glaring fiercely at Ron’s back. George had taken a seat when they came in and hasn’t stood back up since. It’s like the weight of the world is on him.
“I’m telling you,” Greyback is saying, resting one booted ankle on his knee. “Intensity is fine, but you have to be sweet to them. Best results. Gets them soaking.”
Viktorovich shrugs, pursing his lips. “One of us will die soon. If you, nothing to worry about. If me, maybe you tell your boss and make everyone very uncomfortable with each other back home.”
He draws his wand and spells the door open with a snarled force hex. The door does not break, but the hex leaves an ugly, spiraling mark behind.
It’s a slow, exploratory push and pull. When his finger taps over the sensitive bundle of nerves inside, Draco turns his head to bite at his sleeve. Harry pulls out and returns with two fingers, the stretch burning so good that the keening moan that bubbles out of Draco’s mouth is barely muffled by his fabric. He widens his stance and arches back further, presenting himself for Harry, wanting more, and he’s rewarded with a heavy thrust. He gasps and bucks back into it. It’s not full enough. He begs and whines and pleads, pushing back onto each movement, crying out garbled approximations of Harry’s name. It isn’t long before he’s taking three of Harry’s fingers and he’s shuddered through a weak release, come oozing out over his fingers. He feels blissful and content for all of five seconds before the need ratchets right back up again, the slick sound of Harry’s invading fingers and his hand flying over his cock only pushing him further.
Finally, one last thing. I lived in England for a few years when I was younger, but I've since moved back to the States. I'm sorry for the awkward mishmash of terminology. I hope it's not distracting! I get way too shy about asking other people to read my stuff while it's in progress. I tend to just post it and hide. So please forgive any strange narration or mistakes. I do my best to clean them up when I can.
Then the kettle breaks off into a squealing whistle, and she turns back around to pour their tea before joining him at the table.
“Wonderful. Up we get.” Mother pulls him up and briskly runs her hand up and down his arm on the way to the dining room. It isn’t the first time they’ve eaten there, but it still elicits another round of frustrated tears. He and Harry almost never eat in the dining room, preferring instead to lounge at the bar in the smaller personal kitchen, or the fireplace, or any other place not particularly built for eating.
Harry smells of ash from the floo, but his familiar musk is there underneath, too. He’s comfort and security and home. Years of careful conversation and exercises in trust eased the fervent anger of their youth, but push and pull will always be part of their relationship. Some of it is a test that Draco will never be able to abandon completely. He has to push. He needs proof that Harry will see the worst of him, plant his feet, and stay.
“If your child is an Alpha or Beta, they can hone that affinity in service to me.” The Dark Lord muses. “Any child Harry sires is likely to be powerful.”
Draco’s jaw drops, a flush building on his cheeks. It’s the height of indignity for him, no doubt. House elf work. Harry remembers how soft his hands were. He would be surprised if Draco has ever seen a number of these things in his entire life.
Harry is momentarily distracted as Draco starts a meandering path down, hot little mouth latching onto Harry’s left nipple. He sighs and arches into the feeling, earning an answering moan from Draco as soft hands smooth along his sides in a gesture both soothing and exploratory. Harry lets out a low moan at a particularly harsh suck, and Draco awards him with a little nibble.
They help him onto his feet. Being grounded shocks him back into something like awareness, and he can’t help but raise his hand to his stomach. He doesn’t feel any pain, but then, he’s so early along that he can’t feel much. Panicked tears fill his eyes, but he blinks them away as they make their way out of where an open space has been blasted into the side of one of the walls. Sonja’s garden is littered with crows--some hop about in shaky figure eights, others lay on their backs in puddles of blood, with their claws curled tightly to their breast. One of the younger Omegas--Draco struggles to recall his name on a good day, all the Smiths look the same--retches dryly into his hands.
He finds himself pausing in front of mirrors more often. He’s not even showing yet, but he still looks for imperfections regardless, hoping to find an answer for the distance between them that is shallower than his own behavior.
Gobsmacked, Harry watches as the howler shudders and rips itself apart in a show of glittery magic. He summons a pen and sketches a quick reply.
He asks, amidst pleasantries and the most euphemistically worded account of their growing attraction he can muster.
“It’s quieter, mostly. We’ll decorate and charm a Yule log, and light it the first day. It’ll stay in whichever fireplace it’s placed in, hopefully lit for the twelve days of the celebration. Father used to put a preservation charm on ours to make sure that it burned the entire time... It's a very bad omen if it goes out, you see! But, anyway. Yuletide is a time for reflection. Aside from the first two days, we could stay home by the fire and talk about how far we’ve come as a family, and where we hope to be in the future. I could guide you through some new prayers. That sort of thing.”
“Ask your little friends about that, Dolohov,” Bellatrix hisses, at once. “I don’t want to be interrupted while I cull the filth.”
“Are you still struggling to sleep?” She continues on. “How has the potion you created worked for you?”
He hasn’t forgotten Draco’s forlorn wish to return home, but while the London edict is still in place, it’s nice to go back to a space that’s their own.
He smells Draco before he feels him. Wiry arms wrap around his waist from behind, and he can feel the silky fan of hair against the crook of his neck as Draco breathes him.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco breathes out, as Harry’s hand slides under the sleek underdress, calloused fingertips playing along the fine lace of the panties he put on for this exact purpose. Harry’s words sink in fully, and he huffs. “What do you mean
He squeezes the soft globes of Draco’s arse, then gently pulls them apart. He lets out a groan at the sight of the glistening pink hole. He blows over it, and Draco lets out a juddering breath. Harry stiffens his tongue and presses the wet muscle into Draco’s hole, humming lowly. Draco whimpers his name and squirms.
“Yes. I just--Draco--I really want to apologize again, for what I’ve done.” She says, shooting a hopeful look over at Draco, who has deliberately angled himself so that they aren’t making eye contact. “I knew how important it was to you to start a family, and I didn’t stop to think that I could have put you and the others in danger. I’ll never forgive myself for that.”
“Why do you toffs have to wear clothes with so many layers?” Harry growls, pulling up first outer robe, then the inner, then the gauzy chemise.
They call Father down from his brewery, who kisses Aunt Luna’s cheeks in greeting, unfazed by Grandfather’s astonished looks. Lily feels like Grandfather does half his talking with his face. Aunt Luna asks if she can take them all out for lunch, after Lily’s interview, which Father agrees to so quickly that Lily wonders if he’s been just waiting to get them out of the house. Then she sees that his quill is tucked behind his ear, and his hair’s going all curly at the ends, and figures he probably had to put some potions breakthrough on stasis to check on them. Lily gives him a brief hug, smiling as he leans down and distractedly kisses her forehead before nodding at Grandfather and pacing back up the stairs to his brewery.
“When I was pregnant with Luca, I had the most unseemly desire for tomatoes. I’d eat them as they were, like apples! My wife thought that I’d gone off the deep end.” Sonja laughs.
“Welcome home, Daddy,” Draco says, closing the novel he’d been reading as Harry shuts the door behind him, pausing to toe off his shoes.
As if he was waiting for permission, Harry begins pounding into him, pulling him back onto his cock. It takes only a handful of thrusts for Draco to tense up, his fingers clawing into the wall against the rapidly building fluttering in his stomach.
“Harry won’t be upset if I don’t give him a firstborn child that can inherit. I just don’t know how fair it is to bring someone like me into this world.” Draco admits. He feels absolutely rotten for it.
Harry reaches below Draco’s trembling hips to hold his cock steady, and Draco eagerly shuffles back to impale himself, crying out at the feeling of his Alpha’s cock spearing him open again. He’s still a little sore, but it’s a good pain, one that he chases.
Father breathes in through his nose. “I’m sorry, boys. I didn’t mean to speak to you that way. I’ve told you how I feel about the roughhousing in my garden, correct?”
“We have a wonderful lineup for you all today! We have many familiar faces, and some new talent to introduce to you all, some of them even hailing from,” and here he pitches his voice into a hissing whisper, “the darkest recesses of Lowtown.”
Draco blinks at him. Then he smiles and steals another kiss. Harry tastes of pesto sauce and it’s never been better. “I’ll think about it.”
Viktorovich, who has been patiently waiting, suddenly turns his head and lets out a wet sounding cough. He wipes the blood from his bottom lip with a careless swipe of his thumb, shakily pours himself another shot, and squeezes his eyes shut tightly as he swallows it down. Then he slams his smeared shot glass onto the table.
There lies the Malfoy family diary, situated in the middle of a perfectly drawn circle of perfectly clean carpet. The carpet surrounding it is blackened in places and dusty in others, but the diary looks as unscathed as if someone cast a localized
Even though he unquestionably has the upper hand in the situation, Harry is still feeling distinctly wrongfooted by the time he is able to leave the Lestrange’s gilded London estate. The audacity of it all. The twisted sense it makes, given the circumstances. It's madness. When he steps through the personal floo in their bedroom, he’s relieved to see Draco is hunched over his writing desk. When Harry calls his name, he looks up with a tired smile. He’s wearing one of Harry’s old shirts, which falls off of a pale shoulder as he pushes his chair back.
“Maybe later, if you’re still in. I have a lot to do right now.” He replies, squeezing the slender fingers in his grasp.
Draco feels his face heat almost instantaneously. Harry barks out a laugh, but it doesn’t sound mocking. Just affectionate.
Their laughter is genuine, but there’s a breathlessness to it. The anticipatory energy before events such as this is contagious in its own way. Harry hates it, but there is a part of him that will always enjoy this work. It’s at war with the apathy, and he can never really tell which one will take precedence until he is staring down his next target.
“Do you remember the bloodline lessons? When they’d sit us down and tell us all about our families, and how they failed, and exactly why we were all sad little orphans? My father said no to him, remember?  He never got over that.
Draco is fascinated to see her playfully running her hands over her pregnant belly for several progress photos, and smiles in amused sympathy at a small collection of her guiltily ducking behind walls with odd snacks clutched tightly in her hands. In the last photo Draco sees, she is cradling a swaddled newborn Harry to her chest, sweaty and messy-haired and exhausted. She smiles beatifically up at the camera. Then she raises a middle finger to the person behind it. The laugh that shocks out of Draco is so loud he scares himself. Gasping, he closes the photo album in a scramble of sweaty palms and whispered curses, even though his chest pangs in longing for the pages he hasn’t looked at.
His Dark Mark throbs in quick, insistent waves, the way it always does when Harry resists the call. Harry grits his teeth and walks over to the closet on his side of the bedroom, casting a
“Draco, love, it’s absolutely imperative that you wear some trousers for this.” Harry tells him, fondly exasperated.
“You’re just chomping at the bit to murder some weepy children, aren’t you,” Greyback chuckles. “No shame in it. I get it. Children taste the sweetest... Ha, look at you all flinching! What’s the difference? It just looks good coming from you because you’re trying to spin it as some noble duty.”
, it says. It’s quite simple for the exaggerative and witty Michel, who titled one of his simplest invented spells something along the lines of
Voldemort gestures him over, and after a moment’s hesitation, he raises a hand and whispers into Voldemort’s ear. The expression on Voldemort’s face gradually transitions from irritated to enraged.
“Here’s the floo address for where we’ll be,” Harry says, pressing a folded paper into his hands. “Pop your head in whenever, I don’t care if it frustrates them.”
,” Snape calmly raises his voice to drown out Goyle’s reply, “your own grandmother’s use of the same method. It is clear that you have inherited your grandfather’s limited worldview. Careful, Goyle, it is not a sustainable one.”
“I’m not sorry,” Harry tells him, simply. “And I never knew my dad, but I’d hope he’d at least want me to thrive.”
Taking Koldovstoretz is to be the penultimate leg of their Russian advance. They bide their time in Bolotin’s home, memorizing maps of the school and basic curse breaking protocol and the profiles of talented fighters expected to be waiting for them within.
One of the few benefits to Draco’s spotted sleep schedule is that he has more time with Harry in the mornings. Sometimes he props himself up against the headboard and unabashedly watches Harry get dressed, other days he’ll bully his way into the shower and make a drowsy nuisance of himself. Always, at the end of it all, Harry will spend a few minutes playfully scenting him, ignoring all of his token (insincere) protests.
“Draco hasn’t had a heat with me yet, and we’ve only been married for nine months. I’ve tried not to make any snap judgments. In any case, I doubt that us not being able to have a child would be his fault.” Harry says. His glasses are fogging up. Frustrated, he spells them clean with a wave of his hand.
He blows lightly on his length, and then, taking him in hand, swallows him down, his free hand pressing his hip back onto the bed.
“I am on his side, and Draco needs friends. I remember how much you stood up for Draco that day at the Wizengamot. Listen, I don’t know what happened between you two that day. What I
Draco watches him go, then stares down at his tea with a frown. He should have just finished it. He feels strangely exposed, now, surrounded by other couples and families, some faces familiar and some not, nursing low-level discomfort and another frustrating bout of clinginess. After a couple of minutes of sulking, he stands up and makes his way inside the cafe proper.
Harry follows, making note of turns and restless paintings that peer down at him and mutter in Russian far too quick for him to even begin to understand. He’d interrupted half of Draco’s well-meaning lessons by kissing him until he was smiley and unfocused. He’s still muttering landmarks to himself when Bolotin stops by a deep blue door with gold embellishments.
After a long moment of silence, the Dark Lord pauses, slowing their leisurely stroll to a halt. He faces Draco fully, and pins him in place with a look. “There is a smell of Dark magic lingering on you. Were you aware?”
Dad said it took a lot for Kreacher to bounce back from his life with the Black family. He’s still a crotchety old thing, but he’s protective of them all, humbly saving the salary Dad gives him for little dancing figurines in his room, books, clothes, and not much else aside from the occasional Christmas gift. James is suddenly and intensely afraid that Lucius Malfoy will be unkind to him. He smiles at the elf and is one second away from stuffing an apple slice into his mouth before Father gives him a pointed look and tells him to wait until Dad’s served them dinner. Kreacher nods at him and shuffles off, muttering to himself. Dad sets plates--a simple lasagna verde, James’ favorite--and his worries are momentarily forgotten.
Father had reached out for the twins, laughing tiredly as they curled into him, and knelt down to press his forehead against James’.
“Yeah. We can ask the elves to cook something light and settle somewhere in the gardens, have a few hours in the sun before we have to return to London. How does that sound?” Harry asks.
“Arms up,” Harry orders, humming in approval when Draco complies. His outer robes are pulled off in short order, lying haphazardly on the floor, leaving him only in his beige chemise, underwear, and plain stockings.
“Does that surprise you? It’s not so uncommon. I’m unsure of what the papers said, but our marriage was arranged. Neither of us had much of a choice in it. I was fully expecting him to be--well, it doesn’t matter what I was expecting. He has only ever been kind. I feel very blessed to have him. He makes me laugh, he takes care of me… I can only hope I make him half as happy as he makes me.”
Harry smiles back, hoping that it masks the revulsion Draco’s congratulatory words have elicited. Draco dips through the connection to kiss him on the cheek. His sweet scent fills Harry’s nose. If it weren’t for the fact that Harry has gone so long without smelling it properly, he’d swear it was stronger than usual.
“Sorry,” says Ginny Weasley, a handkerchief clutched tightly between her fingers. “I’ll leave you be in a moment. It just--seemed like you might need this.”
He means it, wholeheartedly and not as a joke, but the adults laugh again anyways. Father smiles at him.
They draw attention wherever they go, and Draco does stand out as one of the few people wearing an Omega’s robes in Slytherin green, but the eyes on them as they file into the colosseum feel ridiculous. Harry immediately wants to turn around, but he takes one look at Draco’s searching eyes and sighs.
“Yes, you do! My pretty baby, all pink and shiny,” Harry says, which makes Draco purse his lips. “I bet you taste like honey.”
“I’ll put a little extra in your weekly Gringotts deposits while we’re there, love,” Harry promises, looking back down at his papers. “I know the place is stupidly expensive.”
“Don’t be churlish, it’s your house,” Theo sighs, tiredly. He turns around in his chair, and then his tense expression softens into amusement at the sight of Draco’s full arms. “You hate cross-stitching.”
“Will you?” Draco asks, relieved. “But please don’t say I complained? Make it sound like an observation.”
“What context do you need, Potter? Do you need an itemized list of every horrible thing I’ve done to you and yours?” He growls.
“Relax,” Harry says, cajolingly, rubbing one damp hand along Draco’s hip in a soothing back and forth. When Draco pushes back into the feeling, taking him inside, he hisses out, “Yes, just like that. So tight, Draco. Can’t wait to feel you on my cock.”
Harry just gives him a look. Deflating, Draco sets his work aside. Immediately, the whole affair levitates into the air and then floats lazily over to Draco’s writing desk. Harry holds his hand out, and Draco takes it in both of his, running his thumbs along the lines in the broad palm.
“Honestly, Draco, you seen some of the things I cook. I think I can braid Lily’s hair just fine.” Dad laughs.
Their trip back to London is a quiet one. There are quicker ways to go back, to be sure, but Harry bought train tickets instead, so they can arrive at their destination well-rested and somewhat emotionally prepared for the return.
“When Voldemort—” All four of them flinch at the name and Ron takes a step back, which fills him with dark satisfaction, “When Voldemort calls on you, you don’t refuse.”
Draco was raised amongst the filthy rich. He can tell an expensive home when he sees one, and this one is all vaulted walls and light colors, with huge windows framed by silky curtains. He stepped out into a leisure area, judging by the neatly arranged settees and chairs around a large glass table, and when he turns to gawk at the fireplace he’s pleasantly surprised to see a large collection of books nestled into artful depressions in the wall.
“My husband taught me,” Draco answers hesitantly. He hadn’t been pleased with the idea of saying such a thing, but when reminded that the alternative would likely mean the confiscation of the family diary, his protests became less frequent.
Harry could beg to differ, but Greyback does have his fellow lycanthropes to lead, so the concession isn’t exactly surprising.
When the night is over, they apparate home. Harry snogs him senseless under the stars, and the thought slips his mind entirely.
“Let’s go out,” Draco murmurs. “Just the two of us, so I can have you all to myself. We can make a night of it. Have a nice dinner and check into a hotel and pretend we’re on vacation instead of being trapped in this dreadful city.”
Once slippered feet reach the floor, Draco sets his book aside and wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, tilting his chin up for a kiss. Harry starts with a brief press of lips, but then it’s suddenly not enough, and dips his tongue past pink lips, savoring the taste. Draco easily follows his lead, fingers playing at the messy hair at the nape of Harry’s neck. When they part, he nuzzles into Harry’s chest. “You don’t look fine.”
“Please forgive me for my foolish question.” Draco finally says, worried about where his thoughts will turn if the silence stretches for longer than it already has.
The Dark Lord’s chuckle is not at all comforting. “Your loyalty is admirable, but you are not to be blamed for your husband’s decisions. It is his duty as your Alpha to guide you, and he lead you astray.”
His brows rise when he sees ashwinder eggs. Father had fretted over collecting these very eggs over a weekend holiday. Ashwinder eggs are difficult to track, because who is going to leave the remains of a magical fire unmolested, and Father hates seeing them talk to snakes, a holdover from the worst days of the war. To them, it’d just been a jolly fun trip, gripping tight to one limb or the other in one big Potter conga line as Father side-alonged them from promising location to promising location, watching nervously as they hissed around. Once they collected enough, he’d put the eggs under stasis and lined them all up for crushing hugs, muttering about how his kids were bloody brilliant.
He knows that getting her started with music is a good way to get any conversation flowing. Sure enough, Lily complains about how her fingers are hurting, and then Father frets that she’s overdoing it, and then she says maybe
Draco leans in to kiss him, and when Harry hums into his mouth it’s like the sound rolls right through him, low and warm.
On the first day of Yuletide, they decorate their log and set it ablaze in the leisure room. They both agreed to close the floo connection even to visitors with special permissions and move most of their communications to the bedroom fireplace. Draco takes his wand out and casts the charm his Lucius taught him, and then smiles up at Harry from his place on the floor. Harry kneels beside him and hesitantly joins in on the morning prayer. Then they break their fast in front of the log, still in their nightclothes.
He sends Harry out of the room to go retrieve the family tree he’d put together as a Yuletide gift. Reusing family names is a minor tradition for wizards, and Harry deserves the chance to continue that with his own family, come what may.
Finally, a rainbow bursts forth from the bubbling yellow liquid, and Draco quickly produces a vial from his pocket, filling and corking it with practiced ease. By the time Slughorn has returned to their side, he’s affixed a look of such comedic innocence on his face that Harry has to turn his head to hide his smile.
Thicknesse’s questionable early allegiances as a Ministry plant has been a running joke amongst the older Death Eaters for as long as Harry can remember. He always gets flustered about it, and today is no different, given the way he scowls at Crabbe.
The memories have the thing half full, and the vial is always cool to the touch when Harry takes it from its protected place in his desk drawer to pensively observe it. He should watch them, he knows. It won’t be much trouble for him to acquire a pensieve.
After a few half-hearted attempts, Draco gets the sweeping motion just right. He shudders when Harry tucks his hair behind his ear and whispers out, “Good boy,” trailing his fingers down the smooth column of his neck. His skin is smooth and pale, and Harry can faintly feel his pulse rabbiting underneath his touch. He can see the soft place where Draco would take a claiming bite, high up, just near where his neck joins with the underside of his chin, and abruptly feels his mouth fill with saliva for how much he wants to sink his teeth in. Remembering that he’s a Professor, that Draco is young, that he trusts him, and is likely harboring a crush on a safe adult (a safe
Draco knows better this time. Before going outside, he dips into their closet for some stockings and slippers, one of his thicker winter nightgowns, and then one of Harry’s coats for comfort. He collects the diary, waffles over his vanity before pocketing the Malfoy signet ring, and pulls a knife from one of the kitchen cabinets on his way out.
The goal with this was to be a cheekily pornish as I could manage, though I'm not sure I succeeded. This is 100% not meant to be taken seriously. It's the epitome of fantasy and would obviously be wildly inappropriate in real life. Thankfully, these are weirdo wizards. There is going to be a followup to this one, because it was getting long and unruly and the point of this whole thing is for me NOT to go overboard. I'll post it when I post it!
No more words are exchanged between them. Draco drifts off to sleep in his arms after a little while, and doesn’t wake when Harry gently lays him on his side.
“I won’t care what it is,” Harry says, as they begin their walk towards the front of the private practice. “Is it--bathroom stuff?”
One of his biggest fears is that this won't work, that they will have to keep trying, that he will be disappointing.
No more requests are made, and after an awkward exchange of pleasantries, Draco backs out of the room. He turns the corner and pauses, straining to hear. A few hesitant footsteps follow after him, and though he’s sure he ducked away in time to avoid being seen, the familiar, irritating buzz of a
He holds the dustpan for Draco, and then patiently shows him how to use the mop, which he hates. He casts an impervius charm on his hands before he cranks the wringer, and twists his nose at the murky water that falls into the bucket afterwards. They use a drying charm on the floor, and then when Harry explains how polishing the wood will work, Draco’s face all but glows red.
A surprising show of bravery for someone like that. Draco breathes out, loudly. “Remind me to send him a thank-you.”
Harry gives Draco an encouraging smile as he takes his place in the large chair. He is wearing appropriately conservative robes today, navy blue and largely unadorned saved for the lacy turtleneck undershirt and gold accents. Harry stands by the chair and crosses his arms.
“I’ll explain it better when we have the time, but for now, all you need to know is that it’s where all the er, little people live here in the city. Kind of on the outskirts.”
No, she didn’t, Draco thinks, letting out a hysterical hiccup of a laugh. “Please pass along my thanks, my lord.”
"Do you like how I smell?" Draco asks, one such morning, as Harry looms behind his chair for a goodbye kiss. He knows the answer, but he wants to hear it anyway.
“You’re so pretty, Draco. So pretty for me, so pretty with our baby inside you.” Harry whispers obligingly, smoothing a hand over Draco’s slightly rounded belly.
“I swear Kreacher’s not going to kill me!” Harry laughs. Then, he tilts his head, thinking about it. “Yeah, I don’t think he would.”
Draco's trembling with need. Harry coaxes him up onto his knees, steadying him when he sways too harshly, tugging gently. He summons one of his ridiculously plush pillows (Draco has a frantic moment to be thankful it wasn't one of Harry's pillows that he soiled in his desperation) and tells Draco to hold onto, and then after asking if he's ready, presses the tip of his cock against Draco's rim and pushes in.
After a while, someone knocks hesitantly at their door. Draco flushes for completely different reasons as Harry’s assistant, a starry-eyed little Mudblood named Colin, announces that Harry is late for his afternoon appointment with Harlan Parkinson. His voice is tellingly nasally--everyone in their household has taken to pinching their noses when they hear Draco crying out, if they don’t already have some fragrance at hand to swipe under their noses.
“Did I ever tell you,” Father says, tilting his head to murmur into Draco’s ear, “That this section of Diagon nearly died before the Dark Lord took his rightful place? A ‘den of Dark magic,’ they called it. Pah! Such arbitrary designations. The Ministry then wouldn’t have known true Dark magic if someone had used it to curse their miserable bloodlines.”
Draco pinches him. Harry lets out a yelp, and then laughs as he rubs at his shoulder. "You have no tact."
“Merlin, you’re the absolute spit of him, you are,” Black says, around a thick sob. “How old are you, anyway?”
Draco is laughing and nodding along with every word, gripping Harry’s wrists with all of his might. Harry is relieved that the tears welling up in his eyes are happy ones. “I understand. I love you, too.”
Draco flushes, looks down at where his hands have fisted into his blanket. “I’m sorry I haven’t been able to give you an heir yet.”
“She’s trying to compose a song. I think it’s for--well, it doesn’t matter. But it’s the first time she’s ever done it,” Draco explains, after Pansy stamps her foot and rushes out of the leisure room in a huff.
After a while, Harry holds his arm out for Draco to take, and apparates them to their temporary home. The walk inside the Citadel is as long as ever, but he’s grateful that they’ll be staying in the opposite direction from Voldemort’s personal quarters.
He begins the familiar long walk to the war room, nodding his head at Cantankerous Nott, who falls in line beside him after turning a corner. To Harry’s surprise, he’s followed by his son, Draco’s dear friend Theo, who tilts a shaky nod Harry’s way. Being joined by his peers on the way to the War Room is familiar enough. There are quite a few who are content to walk in silence, like the bookish Cantankerous; Snape, who does not seem to hate Harry as much as he hates enduring superfluous conversation; always the younger Crabbe and Goyle, though Harry suspects this is both because of a classically youthful disdain at the idea of riding their fathers’ coattails and their misplaced admiration of him.
The war room’s doors swing open with a gust of magically conjured wind, and Harry sighs, squaring his shoulders for the meeting to come. He will not miss when this conference season is over.
“Mr. Potter, it’s good that you’re here,” the Healer says, giving him a relieved look. “Your mate has been refusing diagnostic scans.”
He has a point. Harry tilts his head in wry acknowledgment as he sips his tea, which makes Rodolphus let out a more honest sounding laugh.
“Next time I’ll have you make it with me.” Draco promises, too hazy to even begin thinking about how it works.
“Minky raised me,” Rodolphus says, apropos of nothing. “It’s dreadfully sentimental of me, but I don’t go anywhere without her.”
He balances himself with his hands on the grass on either side of Harry’s head, and begins a quick, rocking movement, heat polling dangerously in his belly each time each downwards press. Harry’s cock is grazing his prostate with each punishing snap of his hips, forcing him open. There’s a delicious burn growing in his thighs and lower belly. Draco’s fully aware that he’s babbling, but Harry never minds that.
It’s welcome enough. Sometimes, Draco is able to coax him into spending time with their friends, who often stop by to ask after Draco’s health and unsubtly ogle at what they can see of Harry’s visitors, and things feel like something approaching normal again, even though he often has to watch in longing as they cradle champagne glasses and firewhiskey.
Al remembers one of his roommates being baffled when he learned that the Potter children got maybe four presents max, each, on Christmas day. “Aren’t you rich?” He’d asked. And sure, they are. But they also have a huge family to give them gifts as well, and they want for very little. They are lucky.
“I’ll take you to pick up some films,” Harry promises, that helplessly amused smile once again crossing his face when Draco tries and fails to hide his confusion.
Sirius considers himself a fairly thorough lover, but he's impatient and it's been a while and he feels alive, so he pulls the Omega onto his back and cups the back of his thighs, enjoying the rolling shudder that runs through his lithe form. Malfoy's wet enough for him--Sirius can smell it--but he mutters a quick incantation anyways, slicking his fingers. He slides two inside, easy as anything, curling them up. Once he finds what he was searching for, Draco covers his face with his hands and muffles a curse behind his hands. It's a sweet sight, and a fascinating counterbalance to the way his body accepts Sirius, clenching and warm. Sirius works him over with quick, impatient thrusts, and then Malfoy's reaching out for him, fingers tight on his shoulders.
Finally, they arrive at the gilded door separating Voldemort’s quarters from the rest of the Citadel. It swings open to admit them. Voldemort is sat by his fireplace with a wineglass in hand, the light radiating off of its blue flame illuminating him in a ghostly glow. The shadow cast by his stately chair is long and flickering, and for a moment Harry assumes it is shifting until he hears a familiar hiss and realizes that Nagini is slithering towards them, forked tongue poking curiously out. Draco tenses. She says that Draco smells sweet. Voldemort orders her away with a flick of his hand, and she complies, grumbling the entire time.
The rest, as they say, is history. Draco is just grateful that his Alpha has not treated him poorly so far. He is magnanimous with his servants and indulgent with Draco, routinely showering him with thoughtful gifts. He is a very giving lover, which Mother and Aunt Bella lead him to believe was rare. He’s worldly and settled, thirty-four to Draco’s nineteen, and easily answers Draco’s tentative questions about travel, and what it was like being a war orphan. He has a way of making Draco feel like he’s the only person in a room at any given time. He can’t say that he loves Harry--he doesn’t know him well enough for that--but he feels like he could, given time.
When he finds it, Draco's back arches clear up off of the mattress, cock twitching on Al's tongue. He comes with a keen, and Al glances up at him to watch it, gratified as the sight of him squeezing his own breasts, hair in disarray as he tips his head back. Al pumps him through it, heavy insistent thrusts. Draco pushes him away, but Al's stubborn, and sticks his tongue into cunt after pulling his fingers out, which sends Draco trembling through aftershocks, his thighs rising to close around Al's ears. Al groans at the taste of their mixed release. He keeps at it, jabbing his tongue in until Draco moans and comes again, a weaker thing that has his thighs trembling around Al's head. Al moves back, and those thighs fall open. Al kisses along them, and then shuffles up, leaning over Draco with a loopy grin.
Very aware that this is an act of bravery, Harry wordlessly reaches for the zipper of Draco’s robes and pulls down, revealing inch after inch of alabaster skin. He kisses the back of Draco’s neck, and follows his hand down with soft presses of his lips. They reach the end of the zipper, and then Harry holds the folds of the robe out so Draco can step out of them, all long-legged beauty. And though Harry wants to spend more time memorizing the scope of that beauty, he coaxes Draco forward, pressing his front onto Draco’s back. The boy all but melts into the desk, clearly delighted to take his weight. They stay this way for a while, Harry running a covetous hand up and down Draco's side, gentling him his scent and presence. After a moment, Draco squirms and says he's ready, arching his back and pressing the round globes of his arse against Harry's prominent erection.
“Mr. Parkinson,” comes Draco’s adorably posh voice, “Maybe some separation is the best thing for the two of you right now. What if Pansy stayed with me?”
James is the top student in his year. He gets bored easily and can’t help reading ahead. It still drives Rose nutty, even though they’re not even in the same year, that he can do so with little apparent effort and a dreadful penchant for pranks. What with his exemplary reputation, OWLs coming up soon, and a little weedling from his parents, he’s allowed to go home a little early for the break. Were it under literally any other circumstances, he knows his siblings would be raking him over the coals for it.
The focus of the inner circle’s conversation tonight is, surprisingly, Omegas. Lucius gets wind of the topic and swans off with his usual companions in a puritanical huff. Grateful for the excuse to go, Harry stands to follow him. Then, once he passes the threshold of the door, he pauses. Most Purebloods in wizarding Britain have a strange way of dancing politely around the subject of sex in some spaces, only to completely give in to depravity in the next. The holidays are usually the only time he sees them relax about it--it isn’t at all uncommon to see couples making love during certain festivals. The convention is just that you don’t talk about it later, lest you be seen as improper.
Her baffled response is to ask why someone would hate their own legacy. He shrugs and says he thinks maybe his blood isn’t pure enough. She tells him, in all her infinite snake wisdom, that this is perhaps one of the stupidest things a human has ever told her. He agrees.
The door to their room is cracked slightly. He recognizes the piping voice of Oleander Parkinson, the mother of Draco's friend. He’s a tiny, slip of a thing, Harry remembers, shorter even than diminutive Pansy. And while Pansy doesn’t look much like her mother at first glance, her various exaggerated facial expressions and tiny nose are unmistakably Oleander’s.
When Beltane finally arrives, Harry shrinks their things for an overnight stay, stuffs them into his pockets, and leads him to the floo. They hop to the Manor to collect Mother and Father, and then arrive as a family in the main hall of the Dark Lord’s home. It never becomes less chilling. The London citadel is cold and stark in black and white, the marble floors impeccably clean. It is sparsely decorated, save for a growing collection of still paintings taken from the muggles. Draco’s least favorite, displayed in a place of honor at the back of the main hall, is of Saturn devouring his son. As a child, he was convinced that Saturn’s bulging eyes were following him. After they have signed their name in the guestbook, house elves take their belongings and usher them inside. Draco keeps his potion in the deep pockets of his robes. He nods in greeting to familiar faces, curtsying and shaking hands, and approaches the painting. The click-clack of Mother’s heels and Father’s walking stick reach his ears. It’s something of a family tradition for them to privately complain about the wretched painting before making their way inside.
In a clever bid to generate post-war revenue, the newly implanted Ministry opened its cafeteria to the general Pureblood public for certain times during the day. Very rarely is it busy enough to require staff attending the food laid out in neat tables and repopulated by house-elf magic. The only time Harry ever had to force himself into ridiculous silver and green uniform had been on those days of the Wheel of the Year when Purebloods would breeze through it on their nomadic celebrations in search of food.
No matter how long they tend to work in the Citadel, the white-robed staff never looks any less nervous. Harry knows they must hate when it’s planning time--they have to endure the flight of Death Eaters passing through their halls like some twisted troupe, robes billowing behind them. Their strange procession grows in size, and the familiar chatter starts up from the back, emanating from the usual talkative suspects. Lucius breezes over to inquire after Draco’s health and is gone almost in the same instant, walking stick tap-taping with every step.
,” Sonja laughs. “Listen to you! I carried you for nine months, boy, you will call me what you always call me.”
"You're terrible!" Draco says, suddenly overcome with this frantic mix of affection and embarrassment and deep arousal.
The journey to the gardens is thankfully a short one, and the wide-open space with its many flowers and fountains. Other visitors are exploring in well-dressed clusters, heads bowed together in conversation. Despite his fears, the fresh air and soft sunlight that is able to break through the cloud cover is calming. He takes a deep breath and feels renewed.
A year gone, and it feels difficult to imagine what his life was like beforehand. After actually seeing their baby, he doesn’t think he has the heart to deny Draco anything. He endures the ridiculous amounts of jewelers and parlors and clothes stores they sweep through. Draco’s grim, overdramatic logic is that he’d like to enjoy his body while he has the time.
Ever since she was little, Aunt Luna stops by and checks in with her, asking after her health and music. There’s a little column The Quibbler keeps on her, called Lily Luna’s Corner, something Daddy and Father only agreed to because they trust Aunt Luna, it’s cute, and is mostly confined to a brief interview about what’s on her mind and where her music is taking her. Al has been collecting cutouts of the column for years, a record of her in photos and short sentences. They always take a photo of her standing beside the piano and smiling. Lily looks over the collection sometimes and marvels at missing teeth and short hair and big smiles.
Another boom sounds, louder and closer this time. It is only when the floor starts vibrating that Draco begins to feel uneasy.
“Please,” comes a wheezing voice, weak but terribly loud in the silence that has befallen those surrounding them. “Please help me.”
“We’re bringing more people in day by day,” Harry tells him. He rises from the cot and settles his glasses back onto his face, effectively sliding back into his armor. “Young, old. Alpha, Beta, even Omega. Of course, you know only the Omegas will be given leeway. Smith might be saved on account of his sponsor. The rest of you will probably get the Kiss, but not after drawn-out punishments, and then who knows how long in Azkaban before. Please, Fred, just talk to me so I can see if there’s some way I can get you out of this mess.”
Draco sneaks a hand between them, fingers playing at where they’re joined and then rubbing over his clit in tight little circles. Before long he’s moaning and coming hard around Harry’s knot, moving as much as their position will allow, walls fluttering wildly. Harry groans.
“All along the Thames, my lord, from Richmond to Battersea. And… about half of inner London. The Citadel’s wards protected the other side.”
Draco gingerly works his way out of bed and makes for the kitchen. He heats up leftover lasagna with a warming charm, still too intimidated by the microwave to even attempt it in his state. He downs several cups of water that don't feel like enough. Then he cleans up after himself and takes a cold shower in their bedroom's en suite, hoping to still the prickling heat building there. It helps a bit, but then trying to use a towel is an ordeal because it feels too rough on his skin. He tries to use a drying charm, but his magic abruptly decides not to listen to him, and sends the medicine cabinet blasting open hard enough that the glass mirror breaks. Draco stares at it in muted horror, his eyes stinging.
It breaks the tension, making them all laugh. They share what’s new in their lives. Draco makes the snap decision not to share his work on the estate with them, opting instead to detail some of the newer gifts Harry has given him. Pansy's mother is conspiring to find her an Alpha. Pansy, who has been pining after Milicent Bulstrode for years, looks put out about the whole thing. Blaise and Theo are gaining recognition for their roles as strategists, and Blaise hopes to take his place as the head of his family soon.
Harry clearly hears Rosier calling out Snape’s cutting curse, now commonly used amongst Death Eaters, and promptly reaches over to cover Draco’s eyes. He lets out a noise of protest but doesn’t fight it. Smith stumbles, a hand rising to his chest as blood seeps through the fabric of his shirt in circular blooms.
James deflates with relief. Father gives him a tired, affectionate little smile before the two of them disappear through the cozy halls of the Potter cottage.
It’s a dry one—they’ve been going for long enough that Draco’s too sensitive to touch himself and likely doesn’t have much left to give—but it still rolls through his lithe frame in a wave. He shakes through it, mewling and sighing as aftershocks settle into tender flesh.
They settle in the rarely used dining room. Sonja requests a perfectly reasonable lunch of soup and chuckles when he sheepishly asks for a plate of cheese sandwiches with a side of clementines sprinkled in salt.
He doesn’t weigh very much, but he’s so alive under Harry’s hands, soft and warm. If it were a different day, Harry would take his time preparing Draco--fuck him with his fingers until he was whining, maybe put his mouth on him, taste his slick. He’s feeling impatient, though, and strangely fractured, and a bit like he wishes they could meld into one strange being. So he guides his cock to Draco’s wet entrance, and slides inside. Draco parts his lips on a throaty moan, hands splayed over Harry’s chest. His head hits the wall with a little thunk, but he doesn’t seem to mind, channel clinging tight.
Draco has taken to wearing lighter robes around the home, but the fairly plain one he chooses to greet their guests with makes Harry’s brows raise. They’re a lovely deep red, the shiny thick fabric patterned with simple floral designs. Draco’s a vain little thing on a good day, so to see him devoid of the usual carefully constructed fashion is new, though not unwelcome.
The chuckles this elicits are well-needed, but there are still far too many eyes turning Draco’s way. Narcissa has leaned over and is whispering in Draco’s ear, too lowly for Harry to make out what she’s saying without the help of magic. Whatever she is saying has Draco repeatedly shaking his head. His ears are slowly turning red. Harry squeezes his hand, and he immediately squeezes back.
Harry recognizes quite a few people. He murmurs amusing stories about crotchety Ministry employees, which Pureblood heirs had lost half of their daily allowances making bad bets in taverns and duels, hissy fits and strange requests and ill-behaved children. They spend so much time laughing inappropriately at the Zabini estate that Blaise sweeps over to them and forces them into a sitting room. He very firmly tells them they’re on time out, but then that charming dimple in his left cheek peeks into view as he leaves, so Draco knows he’s not actually angry.
Harry tucks some of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “I’ve already thanked him as much as I possibly could, but it’s sweet that you want to. And to answer your question, yes, I will teach you how to duel.”
Sonja's thoughts are voiced with such absurd, scandalized conviction that it makes Draco laugh, despite his growing shame. He’s unsure of what embarrasses him more--her overreaction, or the fact that he’s been caught by a peer with undesirables in his home.
Anezka sighs. “When táta moved us to London, he wanted a fresh start. So we hired new staff, you know, from one of the agencies in the city? They were wonderful, but I noticed they would whisper together quite often. That’s fine, but they were throwing up charms, which my father doesn’t allow.”
Harry immediately understands what Hermione meant about the Aurors the next day, when he visits her home to bring them over. Red-robed figures patrol in neatly organized circuits, and even under his famously solid disillusionment charm, he feels a bit like he’s being watched.
She walks over to the large shelves with their neatly lined cubby holes in search of what he asked for. She finds it remarkably fast, and even thoughtfully covers the moonstone in a cloth so as not to get the oils on from her hand all over them. Harry is such an awful potions assistant that Draco quickly banned him from doing anything but cheering him on from a safe distance--the reminder makes him smile. When Hermione turns to face him, she smiles back over to him. He thanks her when she passes the stones over, and continues as he carefully grinds them with mortar and pestle.
Finally, the delayed Imbolc celebrations are upon them, to be observed in the last two days of February, and Harry is given another reprieve in preparing for it all. They decide to attend the neutrally placed celebrations in Hyde Park, where there will be food and drink and the usual prayers. He hadn’t planned to at first, but fear of returning home drives Harry to buy an obnoxiously sophisticated magical tent to house them for the full two days. They send out letters to the appropriate family members and friends, return to that upscale tailor to commission a traditional Imbolc dress for Draco and robe for Harry, and create a few talismans together. The final preparation is a fascinating few hours spent watching a runic expert paint Draco’s skin in her incense-hazed parlor, cheerfully explaining the meanings of each one. Hands, feet, and finally Draco’s belly, covered in supplication for health and good favor. They wait for it to dry and then walk home hand-in-hand, Harry staring in fascination at the swirling blue designs. The normality of it all is deeply comforting, which is something of a surprise. Harry’s always felt like something of an outsider for these holidays, even with Draco’s patient guidance.
Draco lets out a soothing noise, kissing what he can reach. His lips brush against Harry’s lightly furred chest, over his sternum. It’s nearly unthinkable, that. When he was growing up, he had everything he could ever need for indulging his instincts. A specially designated room for his heats, toys and pillows and nesting blankets, clothes doused in Alpha pheromones to ease the strain. He was attended by sympathetic maids, who would dip in to press cool hands against his forehead and coax him through light meals, then help him bathe, and finally leave him on his own. Sometimes Mother would do it herself, just to make sure he was okay. He hadn’t particularly liked his heats, but he always knew he’d be well taken care of.
Dad and Father are there to greet him when he comes back. Dad ruffles his hair and pulls him into a hug, and Father brushes his fringe aside to kiss his forehead in greeting, happy as ever to see him. It seems like every time they see him, they have to look up a little further to meet his eyes. (“Still room left to grow, too, dear,” Nan had said, a little before she passed, squaring her shoulders in the same exact show of quiet pride that Father often does with them.)
He’d spared no expense. It has two floors, the top dominated by a fully outfitted kitchen and dining area, and the bottom by a lounge area and two doors leading to a large bedroom and washroom. Draco sighs appreciatively at the sight of their plush bed and sinks down into it with a sigh. When he finds his dragon plush under the covers, he lets out a rare purr of happiness and pulls it close to his chest.
Harry never thought that planning world domination with a group of people he can scarcely stand would become so routine as to feel tedious, but it has. They create formations, plan for which areas to attack next, and share their developments. Today, Snape and Cantankerous Nott introduce their plan to combine the Muggle technology they’ve appropriated with a new potion. Harry only just stops himself from snorting the irony of it. Aerosolizing death to kill other wizards in a decidedly Muggle way.
For just a moment, Draco is afraid it won’t work, but as their words peter off, a surge of great warmth radiates from Draco’s chest, and his bond mark is tingling, and he realizes with a delighted rush that he’s feeling Harry’s magic filling him up.
“Respectfully, sir, you have had time. Give yourself time to prepare if you must. I don’t care if it takes hours. Just know that if you leave this building without speaking to him it will have been your last opportunity. And between you and me,” she adds, her voice lowering as she approaches him, “if you did, it would look bad for us. For all of us.”
He laughs when Draco plops down into his lap. Draco presses a smacking kiss onto his lips, then his forehead, and finally his cheek, endeared by the way Harry’s glasses fog up with a rare flush.
“This ring represents everything that is dear to me. It has been passed down from Malfoy heir to Malfoy heir for almost a thousand years, and I was entrusted with the duty of passing it down to the next heir--the heir I have to carry. I wouldn't dare wear it, but I have carried it with me for years, as a reminder of that duty. I offer it to you in exchange for my wish. Please, make sure I am able to fulfill my responsibilities.”
He’s reminded, with a pang in his chest, of the friends he left behind years ago. He’d done what he could to share his success with those who would have it, but quite a few of them felt betrayed by his new status. It hurts to know how near they are every time he’s in London. Harry is friendly enough with the less frustrating members of Pureblood society, but he’s beginning to wonder if Draco is the first person he’s made a significant connection with in years.
“We’ll have more time together when everything is over with the rebels. The Dark Lord’s put me on, er, something like light duty. I’ll take you back home and then you won’t be able to get rid of me outside of the usual obligations.” Harry promises.
“I’m pants at clothing charms,” Draco blurts, which is absolutely a lie (Flitwick, who had always been one of Harry’s favorite professors for his fairness, has bragged at length about Draco’s talent with charms), “and I’m not--I’m not wearing anything under my robes.”
“Ah,” Viktorovich says, wiping his bloody lip with the back of his hand. “So they send Harry Potter to me.”
“Those tend to be the busiest. Typically we pay tribute to our parents and spend the day with them. The second day, usually the twenty-first of December, will be the shortest day and the longest night of the year. We use what sunlight we have to exchange gifts and food with peers. I've heard that here in London families convene in Hyde Park for a final feast before returning home early? It makes sense. A lot of Dark wizards might attempt to commune with the Wild Magic as a sort of declaration.”
“If my husband and I can't have children, I’ll be taken from him,” Draco sobs. “I have always wanted to be a mother, but I don’t know if I can do it if it’s not with him.”
Reality twists back into relative normalcy, depositing him on his feet in a field of snow, the endless expanse of white broken only by scattered patches of yellowed grass and a squat little barn house nestled in a copse of naked trees. The faint glimmer of powerful protective charms glints off the hazy sunlight of their surroundings. Harry rights himself in a small crowd of robed figures. Some eyes find him with disdain, some with curiosity. Harry recognizes the inner circle, and a few faces that look far too young, some of Draco’s friends among them. He’d been like them, once, young and driven and impressive enough to get a chance at playing an adult’s war.
A whining cry tumbles from his lips as Harry flattens his tongue into Draco’s folds, dragging hot and slow from his hole to his clit and latching on with single-minded determination. Thighs trembling, Draco braces one hand against the wall and tangles the other in Harry’s soft, messy hair. For a moment, he misses the sight of his glasses. Usually when they do this, Harry's spectacles are all foggy and askew on his forehead. Harry loves tasting him, and is usually so impatient for it that he doesn't think to remove his glasses, or at least use a sticking arm. Draco is an expert at
Harry blows him a kiss as they part. Then he sighs, squares his shoulders, and returns to the sitting room.
He’s halfway to the en-suite before she even voices her affirmative, and takes a long enough shower that his skin is glowing red by the time he leaves. Gemma helps him towel dry, then outfits him in robes of deep purple. She sits him at a chair and kneels, helping him into gently rolled stockings and pastel yellow boots. She skitters over towards the vanity by the closet for his jewelry, and with a sigh of appreciation unearths a modest diadem fashioned in the shape of vines. Small, glittering amethysts are affixed into each interlocking stem. It was a wedding present from Father. He hasn’t worn it once--he’d been saving it for some event or another--but the sight of it does make him smile. He has always had a fondness for pretty things.
“A little, but I’m starting to think most of my difficulty with it is because of--of all the unpleasantness in London.”
a noble duty, Fenrir,” Voldemort interjects, a warning in the sharpness of his hissing voice. “Are you not committed to it?”
Harry groans, pressing his front along Draco’s back. He brushes Draco’s sweat slick hair aside and affixes his teeth right over their bond mark, biting powerfully enough that Draco briefly wonders if he’s broken skin. Now that their bond has settled, he rarely feels the feedback of Harry's emotions, but he feels the vastness of his desire in this moment. The new angle doesn’t allow for very deep thrusts, but there’s enough space for Harry to pull out and slam in. One warm hand rests low on his belly, the other curls around his throat, and this is how Harry knots him, growling into his neck, molded so perfectly against his back that it feels like they could fuse together.
Yaxley and Watcher’s duel is over in literal record time, ended by Watcher’s cleverly transfiguring the sand below into a small army of sturdy figurines and animating them with
Once he’s finally relaxed enough, Harry thrusts the tip of his tongue inside Draco’s wet hole, earning him a low sob. They fall into a slow, indulgent rhythm, with Draco eventually balancing himself with one hand, the other trailing up to tug at his own cock as he rolls back onto Harry’s mouth. The next time Draco rises a bit further up onto his knees, Harry slips two fingers inside, searching and curling. Harry quickly finds the oversensitive nub inside--it’s swollen and tender from his earlier attentions, and it takes only a few persistent presses of his fingertips for Draco to let out a keening cry and shakes apart, hot come splattering from his fingers and down onto Harry’s skin.
Harry can see the shamefaced looks overtaking Crabbe and Goyle’s faces, and the shock growing in the rest of the assembled inner circle. They are lucky Bellatrix left with Lucius, likely to flit about Voldemort’s coattails. She would have done a lot worse than giving them a tongue lashing. With a satisfied nod, Rodolphus bows to them and sweeps out of the drawing room. Not wanting to hear the fallout, Harry leaves as well, only dropping his charm once he’s sure he’s alone. He huffs through his nose, darkly amused. Motivated by self interest as Rodolphus is, it was still satisfying to see their peers silenced for once.
Music is the only thing that helped. Father sat her down in front of a piano he hauled in from the nearby Muggle music shop, soothingly speaking to her in French as he ran her through simple scales and the odd ditty. That’s where it all started, her hunger for finding new ways to make music, because how else can she focus it all?
Harry cannot stop his eyes from straying over to him. He has seen many politicians and leaders rendered broken and obedient over the years. The dead-eyed look on Sokolov’s face is nothing new, yet Harry’s heart pangs with unease each time he stares for too long. Viktorovich’s last words to him are ringing in his head. You must do something about it. You must do something about it. Do something about it.
Draco is bent tiredly over his cauldron when someone knocks hesitantly on the open door of his brewery.
Harry squeezes his shaft, leaning forward and molding his front along Draco’s back. “Okay, sweetheart. It’s okay. Come for me.”
overdoing it with his potions, and then they’re nowhere near the topic they started with. Dad talks about the silly request he got to make a magically shifting cake, apparently to surprise a “BAD MAGIC CHEATER,” Scorpius is sick with laughter remembering the way Al had once ruined their potion in class not once, not twice, but three times, until their professor had vanished it completely and asked them to try again on the weekend.
He doesn’t see Malfoy again for entire week. This happens, sometimes. Narcissa and Draco have been deeply entrenched in charity work, and they’re expected at events all over the isles, it feels like.
He gets an eye roll for his efforts, but each of the smacking, staccato kisses Harry initiates draws a muffled giggle from Draco’s mouth until all of the performative frustration has eased into a little smile.
Brows raise at the curious sight of the tray levitating beside Harry’s shoulder, and they follow him right to Davies and Beauregard’s shared office.
Draco puts on a brave face as they are led to Voldemort’s personal chambers, but Harry can feel him trembling against his side. Apparition inside the Citadel’s walls is not allowed, save for the army of house elves, and Harry is sure that the long walk from one end of the place to the other is contributing to Draco’s growing fear.
The gym is completely dark when Draco makes his way in during the wee hours. It’s fragrant with the smell of cleaning fluid. Maybe some of the staff had been in to clean. Harry’s friends use it semi-regularly, along with Harry himself.
Harry can feel a very old fit of temper creeping in, and he begins biting at his thumb. To be fair, not many people have questioned him for anything, but those who did have burrowed their way into his doubts in ways he can’t shake. Draco, wide-eyed and horrified after witnessing fights Harry shouldn’t have exposed him to; Hermione, in her own quiet way; and Viktorovich, who’d bluntly criticized him for his inaction.
Harry’s plush lips slide over his angry red tip, a sight so erotic that Draco knows the memory will haunt his dreams. He’s significantly smaller than Harry, but it still shocks him to see Harry take him down to the base, swallowing in a ripple of wet heat. He just stares down, gobsmacked. It takes Harry pinching him on the arse to begin a slow rhythm. Harry hums, his tongue swirling over the tip each time Draco pulls out. His elbows are suddenly too weak to support him, and Harry immediately cups the back of his thighs, supporting him for each shaky thrust.
Harry smirks. “Sounds about right. If I were home right now, he’d be pulling me out of bed to take him on a boat ride or something, and then when we got on the thing he’d make me hold a parasol above his head for shade. He’d want
He’s standing on the other side of the boutique, surrounded by three anxious-looking attendants weighed down by fabrics and robes. He gives Harry one of those sweet smiles he doesn’t ever seem to realize he’s smiling, and Harry’s chest tightens with longing.
Instead, they all huddle around him for a famous Potter squeeze, much to the amusement of onlookers.
"Always," Harry says, the readiness of his answer erasing the tiny bolt of insecurity that'd been trying to take root in his chest. "but I'm definitely late."
Harry kisses along the back of his jaw and down his neck, and then his teeth affix onto their bondmark, sinking in slowly but insistently. Color bursts behind Draco’s eyes, and Harry’s forcing his huge knot inside, and he can feel a wet trickle sliding from his neck down his chest and he's coming with a cry, covering Harry’s hand. He can feel the warm heat of Harry filling him up, answering that deep-seated need to be claimed, to be bred.
It’s a normal enough conversation. Before long, Lily’s residual nervousness has faded, and they’re going through the motions. Lily plays her newest song, which she knows will be subject to Aunt Luna’s colorful descriptions, and then Lily asks if Al can take her picture this time with his new camera, and he’s so pleased to be asked that he barely seems to know what to do with himself. He takes her picture, and then Aunt Luna’s, and then he calls them all into Lily’s music room for photos. Grandfather, bemused, follows his instructions, posing this way and that. He even gets a picture of Grandfather and Father, standing a few feet apart, angling similar half-smiles at the camera. They look worlds apart, Father messy and indulgent, Grandfather stalwart and proud. Lily loves it. Al promises to send copies of all of them to Aunt Luna. It’s the most they’ve ever shared a room with each other, and she almost wishes Daddy were here and not at the restaurant, but she has a feeling that Grandfather would never have agreed to this if he weren’t.
He’d thought himself childish when thinking about asking for the same thing, but Harry said it first, and he doesn’t want to make a habit of gaping into the mouths of gift horses. Harry laughs softly at him and agrees, and then rests his hand low on Draco’s belly.
He’d been sitting at the living room table pretending to go through their post, but he’s been staring at the scattered envelopes for hours, barely containing the chaotic bursts of his magic, pulsing outward in search of its partner.
She’s always ready with arguments about things Draco never once stopped to question, constantly asking,
Draco turns and climbs on the bed, kneeling and watching as Harry approaches. He sets his wand aside, impatiently vanishing his clothes on the way, and then wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. It’s nice to feel Draco skin to skin again. Draco relaxes in his arms, pressing the soft globes of his arse back against Harry’s erection.
Draco releases one of his hands, and Harry knows the exact moment Draco takes himself in hand--he whines lowly and throws his head back on Harry’s shoulder. He kisses along the pale neck, firmly affixes his teeth over their bondmark. Draco whimpers his name. Deciding to give his chest a break, Harry rests his other hand low on Draco’s stomach.
A sweet woman who Draco recognizes as Mara Yaxley, a distant cousin on Father’s side, has the clever idea of casting
Ever since Harry took the diary, Draco has been trying to put it from his mind. He has been trying to avoid the nagging feeling he has that this baby is not entirely his, because then what is he supposed to do about the bone-deep protectiveness he feels for them? What if he asked the Dark for too much? What if he did not ask for
“Betting pool. Everyone tells the elf which person they think is going to win and contributes to the pot. The winnings are split as evenly as possible between everyone who guessed correctly.”
wants to be held at least, so he doesn’t fight it the second time. Harry shuffles close and kisses his cheek.
He takes a seat in one of the chairs neatly arranged in front of the desk, clasping his hands together. Harry examines him curiously. Of all of Draco’s friends, he is the most reserved. He’s never impolite, but he’s not the most approachable either. He seems to trust Harry a great deal, and in a way that’s much different than the poorly hidden hero-worship of the others, though Harry isn’t quite sure what he’s done to deserve it.
“I thought you might help me in the brewery today.” Father says, softly, looking sleepy and content in his silk pajamas.
Lucius is watching him as Al wipes at his face and backs away. “Marriages are meant to be advantageous. Marrying your grandmother was… heavily encouraged by my father, despite the Blacks’ abhorrent penchant for madness. Narcissa and I didn’t marry for love. That came afterwards. What do you know about magical bonds?”
Anyways! Now that my apologetic ramble is out of the way, I hope you enjoyed this update. I appreciate the prompts I got! I’ll be posting fills soon and another short thingy of my own over the course of this week
Al had been told to do the same thing, but generally he tries his best not to address Lucius at all if he can help it.
Relieved that she isn’t pressing, Harry lets out his own hesitant laugh. “It’s good to see all that hair again.”
“People are expecting a show from her,” Draco whispers in his ear, as the chatter in the room rises to a dull roar.
Harry slides two fingers into Draco’s twitching entrance, and just like that, he’s off like a shot, thighs closing around Harry’s head. His cries are muffled by his shaking legs as he shatters apart around Harry’s fingers. Harry works him through it, humming in answer to every low cry of his name. Then he dislodges himself, pausing shortly enough to place a kiss on the swollen folds.
“Yes, she was very angry that he wasn’t watching where he was going. But there was something--strange. The runes on his neck… they were hurting him, Harry. It looked really painful.”
He looks at her for a long time. She thinks he’s going to say no, so she lets out a nervous laugh and wrings her hands, looking around the music room for something to start playing. Maybe the guitar today?
“I was terrified.” Draco sighs, looking back on the days leading up to their little wedding with a frown. “I thought I would have more time. Mother and Father are very protective. Nobody was good enough for me in Father’s eyes, and I didn’t want an Alpha yet, let alone a--let alone someone I didn’t know.”
“It was her or us,” Sonja says, but even she looks unsettled, the few age lines on her face showing starkly.
“Please move again,” Draco whispers. Harry obligingly bucks up into him, and he babbles out frantic words of thanks. “Will you touch me?”
Harry doesn’t doubt it, but he also doesn’t miss the way Draco swallows and glances briefly to the side. He decides not to call him on it, even though he desperately wants to. Draco snuggles close, hair pooling soft over Harry’s shoulder, and Harry casts
“Salazar,” Draco whines, arching his back. A syrupy rush of arousal is roiling through his body, traveling right down to his cock and his aching hole.
He is familiar with these trips. These conferences can last for months at a time. As a child, he and Mother would make a game of counting down the days until Father’s return. Mother hadn’t felt comfortable uprooting Draco from his home every few months. They visited sometimes but never stayed. It’d been quietly sad in its own way, but Mother made sure he knew that Father was doing his job to keep them and their world safe.
“I should hope that my presence in the whole thing would make it a rather sweet dream,” Draco sniffs, turning his nose up.
The ingredients are simple enough. Half of them he knows he can find in Father’s ingredient stores, and the rest can be plucked directly from the garden.
He pauses to remove his boots, and then scoots closer, pulling Draco against his side. Draco lets out a hiss of pain, and Harry pauses. “Where does it hurt, love?”
Harry pulls out and pushes back in, watching closely as Draco scrambles to brace himself with his hands curled into the sheets, biting his bottom lip as they join again. Then he gives up and subsides against the pillows, hands tightly clutching the sheets below. Each time Harry bottoms out, a little sighing moan tumbles past his lips.
His hands are cupping Draco’s arse, kneading the tender flesh. He pulls Draco’s cheeks apart, and Draco feels like he whimpers loud enough to make the walls shake when Harry licks a leisurely trail over his hole through the damp fabric.
(Hopefully, other customs will become a bit more apparent as I go on, if I’m not as bad a writer as I think I am on a good day. I’ve come to accept that this all reads like a dramatic Harlequin romance novel, so I’m just leaning into it haha. If anything is unclear, please feel free to ask questions and I’ll address them in the notes.  Thanks for your patience and kind comments!)
Voldemort is jeering excitedly over his victory, sweeping through the crowds with his wand in hand. There’s a ripple of flinches and recoils wherever he goes, and Harry is unsure if it is because of him, Nagini, or both. The only ones who react differently are the generally unharmed Purebloods standing in tightly-knit groups, with their shoulders wrapped in blankets. They bow and kneel and curtsey, talking in their strange thick language to Voldemort, who answers them in kind around an unnaturally wide grin. Harry has no clue at all what they’re saying, though he does understand the universal language of flattery and excessive thanks. A mother shamelessly pushes her Omega son forth, who trembles as Voldemort chuckles and pats him on the head.
Father’s irritable eagle owl Calypso interrupts a lazy morning by tapping insistently on one of St. Savior’s large windows. She holds a note containing a simply worded request for Draco to accompany Father on a visit to Diagon Alley. It’s rare for Father to have spare time to spend with Draco, so while he hates to leave Harry in their free time, he’s quick to write an affirmative reply in the margins. He spares a second to give Calypso a thorough scratch. She still nips him on the finger for failing to give her a treat, and flies away as he shouts curses at her back.
“Yes. I--I thought that she was going to hurt us. She was saying how she didn’t think we were going to survive.” Draco says, at length.
Harry closes his eyes, pained. “I’m so tired of people raking me over the coals for something that was out of my hands.
“You are surprised I know you? Help me up,” He adds, thrusting a slender hand towards Harry. “We talk, and then you will honor me with proper duel.”
To his surprise, he spots Irina Bolotin in the crowd, standing stalwart in a sharp three-piece suit. She’s got her arms crossed behind her back, smiling tightly amongst a knot of curious Death Eaters. She seems to be fielding their conversation with none of the poorly-contained irritation Harry remembers from his time sequestered away at her castle.
For one, the streets are lined with vendors and entertainers, peddling wares and basic magic tricks for children. The frost Draco saw fall last night has mostly melted, darkening the pavement and sending excitable youths slipping and skidding each time they start running. Harry is amused by the restaurants in particular—almost all of them have propped their doors open to display samples for groups walking along. They try their first round of samples, and Draco finds himself abruptly and desperately hungry. They needn’t worry about the light breakfast they had, because they fill up on tarts and scones and tiny glasses of drink. Draco lingers for seconds more than once. Thankfully, Harry interprets his enthusiasm as holiday spirit and eats just as much as he does.
“By Salazar,” Davies shakes his head, eyes wide. He quickly fixes his face when Beauregard pinches him in the arm, muttering about professionalism. “How did you come to learn such a curse?”
He reclaims his seat on the cot, pulls his small notepad and pen from his pockets, and begins writing as Fred talks. Fred paints a terrifying picture of a resistance that never died. Sustained by carefully constructed communication systems and codenamed friendlies in the upper echelons, the revived Order of the Phoenix has grand plans indeed. Hearing about the good they’ve done (pooling resources to feed children, pay tuitions for lessons or trade schools, and organizing small volunteer forces dedicated to escorting Omegas to and from work) ignites something uncomfortably warm in Harry’s heart, though it’s quickly snuffed out by how meticulously their first attack had been planned.
“You’re learning,” Harry corrects him. “Don’t get me wrong, you’re the brattiest student I’ve ever had. But you’re learning.”
It's replaced by no small amount of guilt, and then all negativity is washed away completely when Hermione gently guides him into holding little Rose.
As one of the few Half-Bloods in a high-ranking Ministry role, she is known for being sycophantic and vicious by turns. Father had dubbed her “annoying, but useful,” and tolerated her piping interjections in conversations with regularity. According to Harry, after learning that Minister Avery had a fondness for shellfish, she saw fit to pretend she did as well, despite a mild allergy. She apparently keeps a potion handy to curb her reactions. Miming throwing a vial back was a gesture bound to elicit laughter in the Ministry's kitchens.
“What’s he like with you? I must confess to bullying him quite a bit when he was first on the rise. You must have been about nine or ten at the time. He had a terrible temper and it was awfully fun to poke at him.”
Father faces them again. “I sent you here to do a very simple task and you’ve almost ruined it. Why?”
“This was the best way I could think of apologizing. I’ll do whatever you want me to. You can do what you want with what I’ve told you. I’ll understand. I deserve Azkaban or worse,” Anezka sniffles. She wipes her face on her fine silk robes, and the gesture fills Draco with such a ridiculous amount of hate that he has to avert his gaze completely. “I’ve prayed so much since that day. I’m so grateful to the Wild Magic for giving you the strength to keep us all alive, but I can’t stop thinking about what might have happened if it hadn’t.”
Then he remembers his promise and slows down with a wretched noise, gut clenching. Harry pulls away and runs the back of his hand over his swollen lips.
That is all it takes for him to fall apart. He reaches out and grasps Harry's broad shoulders for support, toes curling as his hips buck restlessly. The sensation of coming in his briefs is unbearably messy, coupled with his growing wetness, and Harry gasps out a little
The words dispel all of the warmth he’d been feeling. That’s not true, Harry wants to say, but then he imagines himself trying to profess his love, and his throat closes up. That feels like entirely too much.
“I don’t think you’ll break. But seeing that kind of stuff doesn’t leave you, understand?” Harry asks. Draco shakes his head. “Listen. Do you remember how it was whenever I got home? From the raids?”
After that, the newspapers chronicled, with increasing nervousness, Dad’s paternity leave. Then he’d resigned all together, much to the shock and frustration of the wizarding world. What were they do without the Boy Who Lived fighting crime?
Then his concentration is broken by a low thud. Draco lets out a soft noise of discontent as Harry stills and glances towards the source of the sound, noting with some exasperation that quite a few things in their bedroom are floating aimlessly in the air. He reaches into himself, so used to having to rein his magic in, but nothing happens other than the feeling of it spiking in his chest--if he believed his magic had a will of its own, he’d say it was defensively. Draco’s too busy whining and pulling at him to realize he’s the one doing it. Harry mollifies him with a harsh thrust, knot catching against his needy hole. He presses their foreheads together and gives in to the urge to just chase his orgasm, rutting forth.
The next few minutes pass in a tangle of greetings and in an absentminded conversation. More and more house elves are shooed away by their Masters, who slide into their seats in clear excitement. Waitstaff pop in and out to take orders for food and drink, and while Harry settles for water, he orders lemonade and a tray of assorted tea sandwiches for Draco, who blushes prettily at Harry’s firm instructions to eat it all. He’d only been able to stomach a light breakfast.
Then Harry’s face softens. “You can help it, Draco. We’re going to be parents soon. You’ve wanted this baby so badly. Maybe I’m a little biased, but I think you’re going to be an amazing mum. And I know you’d give anyone commenting on your baby’s ancestry what for.”
It happens again and again. He bans the house elves from serving him meat entirely, and can barely stomach the sight of lemon cakes, a long-time favorite of his. Mother tuts and fusses and pulls him outside into the cool air for walks after each episode spent hunched over the toilet, gently ignoring his complaints that he’s too fatigued to move.
Ashen faced, the Junior Death Eaters walk on. Snape sweeps past, his dark eyes lingering on Harry’s face for an uncomfortably long amount of time. From then on, if any of the various figures lying prostrate on the ground is miraculously alive--human or creature--they use the killing curse.
Sure enough, when Draco knocks softly on the open door of the room, all four stiffen at the sight of him. The table is absolutely covered in papers and pens and even a photo, though it’s far enough away from Draco’s line of sight that he can only make out a blur of color and movement before George’s hand covers it completely. After a beat, Ginny greets him breathlessly, and Hermione says, “Hello, Draco! What can we do for you?”
? What kind of question is that? Were you struck on the head in the blasts?” The one on the left asks, a vein pulsing on his temple.
“We have many, many, photos, sweet boy,” Harry reminds him. “How about you carry a few around, as a reminder?”
“No, not at first,” Draco says, shifting to cover his hands with his sleeves in a bid for self-comfort. “It was a normal day until we started hearing the b--loud sounds. There was some time in between each one, and they got closer each time. It was unsettling, but I didn’t really start to worry until I saw Sonja back away from the door. She cast
“It’s your first baby! You’re going to be doing a lot of worrying. It’s my job to tell you if you’re being silly or not.” Healer Ouedrago says, waving her hand. It’s the warmest dismissal he’s ever received.
Draco’s throat tightens. He shoves Harry as hard as he can. Then he does it again, overwhelmed with hurt and relief and an underlying frustration that has him grinding his teeth.
Draco whispers an affirmative, and then hugs his Alpha as tightly as he dares, willing away the tears he can feel stinging the back of his eyes.
He gives them both kisses of greeting, and squeezes Lily into a warm hug, smelling as always of the slight ozone of heavy magic. He joins them for their card game, not even bothering to change out of his work robes, talking happily about his day. He and Aunt Andromeda have that same resting smile, that same kind but funny manner. How Grandfather could ever look at the two of them and see them as anything less than what they’re worth, Lily will never know.
“A seamster sews,” Draco sputters. “It’s not the same as what I’m doing. I’m just--making a blanket nicer.”
The days pass in a strange back and forth, with Harry kissing him gently on the forehead on his way out of their quarters, absentmindedly dodging questions about his recent obligations, and neatly avoiding any and all of Draco’s attempts at enticing him into bed. It’s always, “I’m tired, sweet boy,” and “I need to leave soon,” and “Get some rest.” It’s petty, but this change is what frustrates Draco the most. Even during the worst of their early days of marriage, he could count on the comfort of giving himself over to his Alpha’s touch.
Draco pushes his head back down. Harry’s eyes water, and he weathers through the urge to gag, nearly intoxicated by the proprietary nature of the gesture. He shifts restlessly against his bed, and hopes that he won’t ruin his pants before the night is out.
Draco just nods. His eyes flutter closed as Harry’s hands slide underneath his robes. He wasn’t kidding. Aside from those characteristic mary janes and frilly little socks, his skin is warm and bare. Harry skirts away from his crouch, chuckling at the restless twitch of his hips, and runs his hands up the slight curve of his hips and towards his chest, brushing his palms over his pebbled nipples. Draco presses into the touch with a sigh.
“You’re horrible,” Draco remembers saying, only for him to let out a tired laugh at Harry’s huffed insistence that it was nothing he hadn’t seen before.
“Oh, good,” Harry says, shoulders drooping. “You only just got used to our estate, so I was a little worried.”
“That’s really cute, actually,” Harry says. Then, softer, he adds, “You don’t like your tea, love? Do you want something else?”
They kiss like the slow tide, Draco easily opening for him, tongue swiping across Harry’s. Draco loves kissing, likes the push and pull and the fight of it, but he yields to Harry like it’s second nature, now. His fingers file through Harry’s hair, manicured nails scratching his scalp, leaving the skin tingling. He tips his head back with a sigh as Harry moves along his body, kissing at his bite mark, the peak of each nipple, down the planes of his soft belly.
They stay tangled in a sweaty heap until Harry’s knot goes down, talking aimlessly about their classes and their plans and future dates to Hogsmeade. Draco’s bleary eyed and smiley and all Harry’s. When it’s safe for Harry to pull out, he watches raptly as his come dribbles lazily out around his cock. Draco shoves him in the shoulder and calls him a caveman. They charm themselves clean, and the moment Harry lays on his back Draco snuggles atop him like he’s little more than a pillow, breathing deeply. Harry rubs his back, very pointedly not commenting on the low purr that rumbles through Draco’s chest--every time he’s pointed it out in the past,  Draco stops and pretends that he wasn’t doing it in the first place.
They both take a seat across from Draco, the parchment between them. The first few questions are fair enough. They ask about the timing of the visit, if anything seemed strange on the way there, if Draco knows anyone who could possibly hold a grudge against Sonja (Harry can’t help but snort at this question. He would have said himself, years ago), what he remembers about who was in attendance.
“Well, I’m at the top of my class. I'm good at everything, sir,” It’s an answer, and an honest one, which he hopes is enough to distract from what is no doubt the root question: do you have a frivolous dream or not? Somehow he feels like talking about his love for Herbology won’t go over well with a man who once held an ancestral Wizengamot seat. He vows not to be seen in the gardens for a little while. He gets the brief, stupid urge to see if the snake on Lucius’ walking stick will answer to him. They’ve been able to get fake snakes to talk to them, with some success, depending on how magical they are. Maybe that will make the tightness around Lucius’ eyes lessen?
He takes the dittany from James, and then he covers his wrists with the sleeves of his jumper and busily wipes their faces clean one by one, tutting about how this is all Dad’s fault somehow. The familiar tingle of his magic runs over them both as he hits them with cleaning charm after cleaning charm. Scorpius grins.
Draco lets out a breathy little laugh. Feeling a little silly and a lot brave, he quirks up a brow and asks, “Aren’t you going to help me?”
“Hey,” Harry says, gently. He grips Draco’s hips tightly to still him, and then runs his hands up and down Draco’s back. “Do you trust me?”
Then he nips the underside of Draco’s jaw, wrenching the most embarrassing, plaintive noise he’s ever made right out of his throat, and that just won’t do.
The hazy clouds above shift into a familiar skull, parting to reveal beams of golden sunlight. As a snake crawls leisurely from between the skull’s teeth, stark against the pale blue sky behind, Harry looks away with a shudder. That familiar tingling blooms underneath his skin, makes him grind his teeth as heat pools in his stomach.
Black lets out a disbelieving bark of laughter, revealing rotten teeth in a surprisingly sweet smile. Then, the smile quickly falls, and he turns back to his cot. He dresses in what must be record time. The tattered uniform of Azkaban’s prisoners must do very little for the cold, and they practically swallow Black’s thin frame as he approaches the bars.
One by one they share their names until all twelve have been identified. Draco watches as the Auror’s face tightens with each name. By the time they’re done, she looks absolutely thunderous.
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, laughing breathily. He does it both for his overreaction and his apparent predictability, that the elves are now asking if he wants dessert after every meal no matter the time of day. “Yes, Winny, that sounds lovely. Surprise me.”
Draco tugs impatiently at him, so Al lifts his hips with a sigh as they pull his pants down. One of Draco's soft hands wraps around the base of him, teasing at where his knot is already threatening to make an appearance. He kisses Al's tip, and when Al shifts restlessly flicks his tongue out at some of the precome already gathering there. Draco hates it when Al pulls his hair--it's short and finely textured, any good grip would need to be tight--so Al moves his hand away when he can feel the urge growing. He curls his fists into the day bed and prays for self-control.
When the food finally arrives, Draco scarcely takes two bites of it before he is rushing out of the dining room with a roiling stomach.
Greyback is nodding along, pointing over at Rosier in agreement. It’s strange to see him united with any wizard overmuch.
Given the impossible task of contending with enemy forces while poisoning the forest, many of the Muggleborns are dying in droves or returning to Bolotin’s estate nursing painful looking burns or other permanent injuries. Still, the operation is successful. Voldemort’s far-reaching dominion has given them the advantage of numbers, and his army is famously dedicated. If they can succeed, he will gain more than enough to make up for the loss. With every field report, Milicent Bulstrode’s carefully constructed look of calm slips further and further. She trained many of the British forces being sent out.
They don’t adjourn until several agonizing hours later. Harry is ordered to stay. Breathing deeply, he takes his seat yet again.
Then he turns on his heel and marches for the doors. On his way out, he pauses briefly at Michel’s faded portrait. The man himself is missing (as is his wont--Draco has only ever seen him once, and he hadn’t spoken), leaving behind only the nighttime backdrop of a vine-covered swing hanging from a tree in a moonlit forest.
“My, your Father has allowed you all to grow into willful little creatures, hasn’t he?” Grandfather comments, apropos of nothing, one brow arched high.
He’s only ever seen them in passing, and only here in London. They all wear plain beige robes to signify their status. The regulation uniform is iconic, by now, but what always sets them apart are the glowing rings of runes inscribed into their necks. The runes on this Muggle’s neck pulse in a brief flash of brilliant blue light. Shocked, he takes a step back.
Mr. Blishwick hosts a gathering in their honor. Draco would have settled for a modest apology, but he supposes he should be grateful--he’s gleaned from Mother’s tongue-in-cheek retelling of a floo call that the old Beta bribed the story of their little ordeal out of the papers, fearing being perceived as a weak handler of his household.
Sometimes Draco brings a gift--an apple, which surprised a laugh out of Harry and made Draco beam; a charmingly unsubtle treatise on gender in the wizarding world for the curious muggleborn; a bottle of the first wine Harry has ever enjoyed drinking. He’s being courted. It’s adorable, it’s insistent and amateurish, and Harry doesn’t know what to do about it. So he accepts the gifts, murmurs a thanks or a word of praise, and tries not to think too hard about the way Draco lights up each time.
Voldemort begins their slow march. He is barefoot and does not seem particularly bothered by their surroundings despite his lack of protective charms. Every so often, Nagini’s large head rises above the haze, her tongue flicking curiously into the air. If she is speaking, Harry is too far away to hear her.
He’s able to convince Harry to cuddle him for a bit longer. Harry cheekily stills his hand when Draco reaches for his wand, mumbling about covering their scent. He transfigures one of the pillows into a surprisingly elaborate summer robe, helps Draco into it, and then pinches his cheek before he apparates in a resounding crack of magic. Draco pulls a blanket over his shoulders, cradles a fluffy teddy bear in his arms, and enjoys the aftershocks.
Mother gives him a small tub of light blue body paint before they retire for sleep. Draco recognizes the hue immediately. It’s spelled to fade slowly, and glitters fetchingly in the sunlight. For Imbolc, it is traditional for expectant mothers to commission a runic expert to paint their hands, feet, and belly with words of power. The paint is a way to signify someone in need of blessings for a healthy babe. Draco has many memories of seeking out blue paint with his friends, cheerfully chanting Latin wishes of good health. He frowns, realizing that this upcoming Imbolc will be the first holiday he hasn't shared with Harry since they got married.
“I must say, I’m surprised to see you here, Mr. Potter! You look absolutely radiant!” The Alpha says as she plops into her seat. Harry is glad that couples’ seats are fused together, leaving some space in between either of them and other people.
“I can’t promise that it won’t. The Dark Lord wants to expand his influence into the Americas soon.” Harry says, at length.
“I’m sorry.” She whispers. “Anyways… they slept together. And it was causing trouble because the friend was married. So I demanded that they let me help. The rest is simple. I had low-rung tasks--sharing any strange gossip, reporting on the whereabouts of táta’s Ministry coworkers, keeping an eye on Mr. Smith--that sort of thing. And, recently… getting close to Sonja Avery. They said they were just going to stage a kidnapping and ask the Dark Lord to hear their demands for change in government.”
Draco gapes. “Wormtail?” He knows the man as little more than a whipping boy. Every Death Eater he has ever met speaks of the stout little Beta as a nuisance.
Draco blinks at him. Then, with a short laugh, he reaches for his wand, wracking his brain for the appropriate charm. But the moment his hand curls around his wand, the tingling beneath his skin rushes up from his chest and down his arm, and the skin of his bleeding palm starts itching unbearably. Harry pulls his hand away, glancing down with wide eyes. Draco glances at his own hand just in time to see his flesh knitting back together.
Harry gathers his robes up with greedy hands, and before long Draco’s lower half is exposed to the air. “I want you to ride me.”
It’s true, but he’s absolutely injecting a bit more drama into his voice than is strictly necessary. He wants to be coddled and he doesn’t want to ask for it. Harry seems to sense this, though, and pats the empty stool beside him. Brightening, Draco walks over and hops up, warmed by the press of Harry’s thigh against his. Harry’s free arm wraps around his waist.
His teeth set perfectly over his bond mark--still so new and sensitive--and Draco comes with a whimper, shuddering. When he’s done, Harry slides his sticky fingers into Draco’s mouth, making him lick them clean. He can feel Harry’s cock twitch inside him, and he’s overtaken with punch drunk giggles.
Before Harry can answer, Draco knocks on the door--shave and a haircut, as he usually does unless he’s in a hurry.
“I’m going to go get you something to drink,” He begins, stroking gossamer hair as he rocks the two of them back and forth. Draco hums. “And some snacks...” Another hum. “And then we’ll make our excuses with your family and go back to our tent and we won’t leave again until you feel like it, even if that’s tomorrow.” A very long, approving hum.
Harry takes one step into the Ministry, locks gazes with Auror Beauregard, and sighs. She points at him to let him know he’s been seen, and then makes a beeline for him. She collides roughly into a few people until the crowd learns and begins to part for her.
Harry hums against him, and with a lazy sway of his hand vanishes his clothes. Sometimes he goes a little far with his charms--he can only hope that he’ll find them in a heap somewhere instead of blinked out of existence completely, because Draco will tease him relentlessly if they need to resort to transfiguring a flimsy set of replacements.
“I keep finding you here when I come home,” Harry says. “Do you like it? Want me to move in a daybed from one of the nesting rooms?”
They cover the basics over the next few days. Draco bellyaches loudly about how keeping his broom polished and maintained is going to give him callouses, but he does the work with dedication. Harry has come to learn that Draco complaining to someone is a show of trust. With Harry, it’s both that and an excuse to get kisses. Many of their early lessons are interrupted by snogging sessions, but progress is progress. The first time Draco gets his training broom to float up into his hand, he looks over at Harry with such happiness on his face that it makes Harry’s chest ache. When Harry praises him for a job well done, he practically glows.
The chatter of the chamber quiets as Minister Luca Avery strides in. He is every bit his mother’s child, down to the considerable height and loosely curled hair, but there’s a severity about him that looks nothing like Sonja Avery’s perpetually amused expression.
“It's rather simple. We send them to the forest in waves. They'll use their magic to drill as far as possible into the earth, and then pour the poison in. If they’re lost in the process,” He swallows again, “then so be it.”
Harry sits beside him on the plush couch, warm hand landing on his thigh. He’s smiling softly, though the expression slackens into genuine surprise when Draco opens the box.
Sensing Draco’s rising discomfort, he rests his hand low on Draco’s back and rubs slow circles. He leads him further away from the clusters of guests standing around the feast tables and games.
The shifting black and white image of their child is projected onto the blank far wall, and when the fluttering
“Something smells good,” Fred says, not looking up. “Gonna eat it in front of me? I have to say, your torture methods leave much to be desired.”
After gathering the packages in his arms, the Muggle gives them both quick bows, gasping apologies all the while. The people assembled part for him, more out of disgust than respect. He shuffles away. He must feel all the eyes on his back like an extra package of his own, Draco thinks.
“Sweetheart,” Harry interrupts him, bending down for a kiss. “You’d know if I were too tired for you. Are
Harry snorts into his neck, kissing over their bondmark. Draco winces when Harry kneels and gently pulls his legs down, and locks his ankles behind Harry’s knees. Harry rubs brisk circles onto his trembling thighs, hoping to soothe the soreness that is likely settling in.
“I am,” Draco huffs, frowning right back. “But not for whatever awful reason you’ve conjured up in your head. I’m afraid because I stand for everything that--well. I spoke against Mr. Weasley’s side. I should think that reason enough to at least be leery.”
Maybe it’s the hormones, or the warm water, but he doesn’t feel the usual shyness, just a calm pride.
She smiles at him, the tips of her hair lightening from the dark brown she’s settled on to a verdant green. The color travels slowly up the length of her hair as she overflows her dishes with food. He wonders if she even notices that she’s doing it.
He can feel the word rumble in his throat, but there’s a distinct lack of anything in his ears. It takes him a few minutes of gasping panic before he calms himself and tries
Starlings. Starling murmurations aren’t such an uncommon sight in Newcastle skies, but he’s never seen them this early in the year. He’s also never seen them shape themselves into such uniform, corkscrew spirals, shifting back and forth as if in search of a target. How had he not noticed them forming?
“A bit jittery, still,” Draco admits, “Maybe I should write up the experience, see if I could get it published. Under a pen name, of course. It's strange that something not explicitly brewed as an aphrodisiac could have such an effect...”
Harry parts his cheeks, and after checking that he’s wet and ready, presses the head of his cock against his hole and slides in with a soft grunt. Draco whines into his pillow. He’s still a little loose from their long night, and sore, and it’s a sweet ache that fills him as Harry pushes in. He doesn’t stop until his heavy balls are pressed against Draco’s, and he peppers a trail of warm kisses on the back of Draco’s neck as he adjusts.
He’s so stupid. This is frustrating. He hates it. To his horror, more tears sting the back of his eyes, and he rubs tiredly at them.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Harry says, resting his head on top of Draco’s. Draco holds him as he cries, solid and warm in Harry’s arms.
“You can take a seat, too, sir,” Auror Beauregard tells Harry, tilting her head towards the chair on Draco’s other side.
Harry ignores the request for now, and Draco begins bouncing desperately, taking his pleasure with single-minded focus, stripped to instinct.
There’s a lot more to that, Scorpius thinks, but it’s something he tucks away for later. For now, he’s content to let his thoughts take the backseat to the very important job of cutting things up.
Then he turns away, already pulling his trousers down. He shifts back into the scruffy dog from before, turns in a bow-legged circle, and curls back up right there on the wet floor.
The sensation pulls a loud, throaty sound from his throat. Harry nips along his jaw, down his neck, over his collarbones, leaving his skin tingling with each mark.
Draco laughs weakly. Where would they go? He knows Harry is likely thinking the same thing, so he doesn't say it aloud.
Her painted lips curl up into a lovely smile, and there’s a glint in her eyes that’s a step away from nervous and a step towards hopeful, and an acknowledgement in the wry turn of her lips that she’s not being as subtle as she could be.
He understands why they are, to be sure--Voldemort is always eager to send a message, and making an example out of a disobedient subject is a quick way to break confidence and cull unfavorable behavior. Each time the rebels are brought up during planning at the Citadel, the Dark Lord becomes almost incandescent with fury. Harry doesn’t think the man will ever get over the indignity of having such a historic victory soured by a show of rebellion. He’s scarcely spoken of the lives lost outside of public channels, though that is par for the course. He doesn’t seem to genuinely care for any living soul that isn’t his wretched snake.
In Pureblood culture, it is extremely disrespectful to fight another person with one’s bare hands. Disputes are better settled with duels or clever social maneuvering. Otherwise, one risks being seen as someone who “fights like a Muggle.” Trying to remember this had been quite the learning curve for Harry at twenty-four, fresh into a world he’d been barred from, save as a servant. In Lowtown, outbreaks of fisticuffs were as common as spontaneously arranged dueling competitions, and Harry had learned from a young age that scrapping with other orphans was often the only way to keep your most treasured belongings in your possession.
He leans in, licking a strip from the seam of Draco's bullocks up to his rim, chasing his taste. The tight skin flutters against him, and Draco nearly loses his grip for the way he sways back into Harry's mouth, gasping out a garbled approximation of his name. Harry hums against him in reply, and then works his tongue in as deeply as he can manage, savoring the answering pulse. Draco darts one hand out to grab desperately at his hair, and it's a tight, painful grip, but when Harry reaches up to replace the missing hand with one of his own, he sobs out a weak, "
Anyways, thanks for your comments! Whenever I hit a slump, I remember all the encouragement and it keeps me going.
Draco should say no. Head Auror Robards has been especially hard on Harry, like he wants him to prove that he's more than some loudmouthed upstart. Harry often works long, odd hours as a trainee. Robards had apparently been none too pleased to learn they were starting a family. It wouldn't do to push his patience further by making Harry late.
“Issues we screen for in the blood right now are all showing perfectly normal levels,” Healer Ouedrago announces, turning back around to face them. “As for the babies… Now is the time to start deliberating on names for an Omega girl and a Beta boy. Congratulations!”
“Gonna fill you up, baby,” Harry hums, bending his knees to cradle Draco’s thighs. “Give you what you need.”
Because James can’t seem to take most things seriously, a delighted guffaw bursts from his chest. Scorpius bites his lip to contain his answering laugh.
Harry holes up in there almost every single moment he’s not out serving the Dark Lord, and while he’s got free range of their temporary living space, entering the study while Harry is away feels like a grievous transgression. He doesn’t want to risk getting caught and lowering himself even further in Harry’s regard.
Draco found out in his Yuletide search just how much Harry looks like his father, but it doesn’t really sink in until he sees a photo of the two of them together. James holds a sleeping Harry up beside his face with a goofy grin.  Draco’s seen this exact same smile aimed his way so many times.
He says all of it in a furious whisper, drawing closer and closer to Draco with each word. Desperately, he hopes to catch the smell of alcohol--firewhiskey, wine, anything--so that he can forgive and forget this. The only thing he smells is agitated Alpha. A low, plaintive whine tumbles unbidden from his lips, and this seems to shock Thicknesse out of his strange mood. Eyes wide, he steps back, and his grip slackens.
Harry’s hand slides off his cock, and he lets out a sob of bitter protest, planting his feet and pushing back on the fingers pressing insistently on his prostate. Harry pulls them out immediately, and Draco can feel tears gathering at the corners of his eyes.
“Oh, please don’t curtsey, my dear,” Thicknesse says, quickly recognizing the intention in Draco’s bending knees. “I think we can forgo the formalities with no one around to scold us. May I join you?”
He settles down in the study and pores over the various letters the Aurors have sent him about the progress they’ve made. He’s gotten so used to various fussy owls tapping on the study window that he just leaves it slightly ajar during the daytime.
“See how there are four people, love? They'll fight in two one on one rounds for this bracket. The first two people to fall will duel each other first, and so on.” Harry says. Draco nods in understanding.
Draco gasps and scrambles in place. Harry’s shirt is so large on him that it may as well be a dress, but there’s still a deeply improper amount of his legs on display. Panicked, he sets the ice cream aside and kneels on the floor. He winces as his knees grind harshly into the hardwood and bows his head.
petty, and he’s always been particularly gentle with her, so that is how they find themselves shopping for dress robes. They don’t go to Diagon Alley--aside from the restaurant, Lily hasn’t been able to stomach the thought of going there for a while--but to a nice little place Nan liked on the other side of wizarding London, a family-owned business that had never had any particular qualms with serving her. The owner smiles when she sees Lily, and then her eyes widen as Daddy steps in after her and then Grandfather, looking distinctly peaky from the apparition over.
Harry laughs, heart full. Draco tilts his head back for better access as Harry kisses along his jaw and neck, complaining theatrically the whole time. He likes to be kissed and petted and told that he’s cherished, even if he puts up a show that he doesn’t. Harry is more than happy to play the game.
Draco awakens to an insistent ringing in his ears and a deep throbbing in his temples. He can feel someone shaking him with all their might, and when he weakly attempts to roll away, the hands dig in tightly enough that he can feel nails dipping into his skin past the fine velvet of his robes.
that had him so jittery. Harry leans down, pressing his front along Draco's back, his breath ghosting over the sensitive curve of his ear.
Even thinking about Harry makes him sad. They’ve only been able to have short floo talks. Each time Harry has to go, he leans through the fire so they can share long, desperate kisses that leave him aching. The urge to pull him through grows stronger and stronger each time.
“It’s no trouble. I’ve been through a lot worse,” Harry tells her, with a weak little half smile. “Just wasn’t expecting it, that was naive of me.”
He lets out a breathy laugh at the way Harry pauses, hand tight around his wand. He is not used to his enemies talking to him, and the shock of it has shaken him out of his blood lust. The world seemed to have caught on fairly quickly that attempting to reason with Voldemort’s forces is never fruitful. Most who fight back do so with the intent to kill, not to persuade.
“I’ll stand,” Harry says, taking his place behind and slightly to the left of Draco’s chair. “It comforts him. I won’t be an obstruction.”
Harry's quiet for a little while, just imagining it. His mother, with her wry smile and fiery hair. His father, ever the joker, insistent and charming.
James relearned his grandmother at her funeral, and he will always wonder how much of her Lucius Malfoy learned that day, too.
Draco reaches out for his hand, and Harry takes it gratefully, bringing it up to his hand to plant a kiss on delicate knuckles. Fighting a wave of exhaustion, he claims the chair next to his mate and pinches the bridge of his nose. Draco strokes a comforting hand over his shoulder.
“Yes, sir,” One of the Aurors says. He pauses, clearly hesitant to say what comes next. “Most of them were Purebloods, sir.”
After shooing her footmen away, she gives them a lively tour of her home--from the various lovely drawing rooms to the library (Pansy rolls her eyes at Draco’s obvious interest), to the ballroom that Sonja jokingly insists will go unused for as long as she’s able to avoid taking callers. She informs them of the only three rules. First, they are to speak freely. Second, if someone elects to pass on a subject it must be respected. Third, what is shared in the parlor stays in the parlor, or they risk Sonja making their lives very difficult indeed.
“Really?” She asks, loudly, and then she visibly collects herself with a shake of her head. “I mean, I’d love to.”
“There, not so scary, is it? Practice, that’s all it takes. We'll work on some more things like this to help you feel less overwhelmed about more complex potions.” Father says.
He walks over and cups Draco’s chin, tilting it up for a chaste kiss. He pulls out a bottle of whiskey and then plops down in the bar stool on the other side of the aisle. With a wave of his hand, the re-free-ger-ator door closes.
A low murmur kicks up. Heart in his throat, Harry watches as Theo aims his wand towards the war table, projecting an image of the Koldovstoretz grounds. Harry has only seen it in pictures. It’s a tall, multicolored building rampant with onion domes and halfway obscured by the abundant trees of its nameless forest. As Theo speaks, the image enhances, and several indistinct people point their wands at the ground.
“Oh, is that so? More for me! Good luck!” She says, taking a healthy sip of one drink. “He seems like a rather taciturn man, your husband. What’s he like?”
James, Al, and Scorpius join Lily as she approaches for a hug. Aunt Luna always gives them all separate hugs, then cups their faces gently as she checks them over quite seriously for wrackspurts. Aunt Luna is still examining Lily when she says, “Hello, Lucius. Your hair looks quite healthy. I was worried it’d stay greasy after the war.”
"I want that, too. I want to give you a baby very much." Harry says, like it's the simplest thing in the world.
“I’m okay now. Perfect, with you here,” Harry teases, reaching down to squeeze Draco’s arse. Draco lets out a little squeak, which makes Harry chuckle lowly. “But enough about that. How was your day?”
Draco mouths at the tip of Harry’s cock, but he’s clearly too distracted to stick to it. After a moment, he gives up entirely and props himself up with his hands on Harry’s chest. It takes some coaxing in the form of squeezing hands and playful love taps, but he begins gently rolling back into Harry’s rhythm, soft moans and sighs tumbling from his lips.
“It’s all your fault I’m like this, knock yourselves!” James whines, cherishing the laughs this gets him.
Theo hums, and clasps his hands together, gnawing at his bottom lip as they continue their walk. Harry has been around him long enough now to recognize the thoughtful look on his face. There is a lull in their conversation right until they make it to St. Savior’s proper, and Harry sighs as the wards part to admit them.
Draco whimpers and reaches back to push at his forehead, whispering, “Too much, too much, too much.”
Harry barks out a short laugh. “Only some of the people who compete in those duels are experts. Draco, these duels… they’re not like the duels we have at home. They’re not even like the ones at Beltane. Okay? They’re violent, messy, ugly. I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”
He impatiently removes his fingers, quieting Draco’s whine by sliding them past those swollen pink lips. He licks them clean, eyes blown wide. He’s looking up at Harry with this trusting desire. There’s no other way to describe the sweetness with which he gives himself over. Harry takes himself in hand, positioning himself and sliding in one quick thrust, exhaling shakily at the feel of those slick walls taking him in. He doesn’t stop until he’s almost balls deep, his knot already throbbing at his base. He can already tell he’s not going to last long.
Draco stands stock still as Anezka begins. She doesn’t put her hands fully on Draco’s belly like the rest, settling instead to reach out with her fingertips. She murmurs her Latin, shifting nervously from foot to foot as she does. The low hum of the music and the shouts of the dancers is a tense, clashing backdrop to her prayer, and the awkward energy is only amplified by Draco’s narrowed eyes. When she finishes, Draco rolls his head towards Harry with an impatient look.
When Harry pulls the blankets back to find Draco in simple forest green lingerie, he blinks owlishly. Draco has grown fond of little lace panties--sometimes he wears them just to feel sexy, like a little secret beneath all the layers of his robes. It’s also nice to put up a fuss when harry inevitably rips them to get what’s underneath. But Harry has never seen Draco in anything like the little matching bralette up top. The ripple of cool air that hits his form makes his tender nipples harden into peaks, straining against the fabric as he squirms in mixed shyness and anticipation under Harry’s dumbstruck gaze.
Harry laughs with him, brushing his sweaty hair away from his forehead. “Colin isn’t going to be able to look you in the eye.”
Draco squeezes his waist. “I don’t need to worry about life and death when I have you to protect me.”
Harry made it very clear that he wasn’t, under any circumstances, supposed to wait up for him when the meetings start. The first night is still difficult, especially after his long day. After a few hours of tossing and turning and pouting into his new plush toy, he gives up, throws one of Harry’s shirts on over his nightgown, and makes his way to the personal kitchen on their floor. He’s still unused to the Muggle contraption that is being used to store some of their food. He can’t even pronounce the thing and has been calling it the food box in his head. When he pulls its door open, he winces, surprised by the sudden burst of light. It’s powerful enough to illuminate this corner of the kitchen in a low glow, though, eliminating the need to fiddle with the switches on the wall. He pulls out some bread and cheese, and after a moment of consideration, a bottle of aged brandy. Then he leans over the aisle and picks at the snack.
, and then swings them in dangerous, sweeping arcs, uncaring of who exactly she is bowling over. They’re all used to this behavior, and cast
The attendants lead them towards the dressing rooms. Draco suddenly glares up at him, lips pulled into a frown.
Harry’s poring over reports in his office when he hears a familiar knock on his door. Knocking shave-and-a-haircut had been common at his orphanage, something a friend might do if they wanted to get your attention. Harry taught it to Draco for much the same reasons.
“You want my cock, baby?” Harry asks, covering Draco’s hand with his own and guiding it closer to where Draco’s wet and wanting.
"What an awful kind of clothing," Draco huffs, quickly becoming confused with Harry's belt, and then his fly.
still talk. There's a compatibility there that can't be denied. And, it's selfish, but it's been a while since Harry has been someone's unequivocal focus. Maybe it's the lack of experience, but Draco is open about his interest, and always happy to see him. There's more to life than being the twinkle in some young Omega's eye, but it soothes some of the instincts Harry has been burying since he learned anything about how wizards operate, overwhelmed at having yet another thing to learn about.
An elf pops into their section and begins walking between the rows of their seats, presenting a bucket to each person in attendance.
He wants to say something about the wish, about the diary, but he can’t. When he thinks about trying, his throat closes dangerously. Still, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t a million other things he should say.
Mother is silent for a very long time. Draco’s heart is in his throat. So many words are threatening to burst forth--his fears, that Harry loves him, that he cut into his own flesh and communed with the Dark and hasn’t slept the same since.
“You have to keep your promise. Even when I’ve said something awful,” Draco continues, squeezing his eyes shut tightly to preempt another round of tears.
Draco shudders, pressing his face into Harry’s neck. He’s too shy to voice any words of thanks, but the praise lights him up. Harry’s heated cock is heavy against his thigh, and the reminder that he’s not the only one in a state--that he made Harry feel that way--is reassuring. After a few moments of cuddling, Harry rolls him gently onto his knees, directing him with firm and steady hands.
Only two people drop coins in favor of Smith: Blishwick, and the only other Omega in their section, a baby-faced young woman Draco had pointed out as a former classmate a year below him. Their compatriots laugh and jeer playfully at them.
He nods frantically against Harry’s chest, wordless with the feeling. Harry cups his cheeks tighter, spreading him as much as he can, hips pistoning up. A pulse of heat signifies his swelling knot, eager to press in. Draco cries out each time the engorged flesh pulls on his hole, the slick noise remarkably filthy. His nails sting where they dig into Harry’s shoulders. He’s probably going to look into the mirror and find ten little crescent marks there later, and he won’t do anything to heal them. He likes the idea of Draco leaving his own mark.
Then a familiar, rolling cramp sets low in his belly, and Draco sits right back down. He gives himself fifteen minutes to panic in tense silence before he decides to busy himself. Harry left for the Ministry in a smiley hurry, excited for the chance to observe Aurors in the field for low level cases. In between excitedly telling him all the details, he'd summoned his notepad and asked Draco if he needed anything, and Draco just asked had asked for the components for homemade quesadillas, too embarrassed to admit that he just wanted to eat the cheese out of the bag, like some slovenly cave troll. If he tried to reach out, Harry would likely drop everything to be here, but the thought of it fills him with guilt.
“Sort of. My magic is, er, big. That’s how I was first discovered, actually. The Dark Lord sends me in as a kind of… shock trooper.” At Draco’s blank look, he adds, “I lead attacks by throwing our enemies off guard.”
“Whenever she stopped by we’d take turns gathering by the employee loo just to hear her struggle.” Harry snorts.
So they spend their first half-hour home convincing the tearful house elves that they’re not angry with them, and then the next few hours peering down at various mixing bowls and scattered instruments. They forgo the traditional Ostara fare for hand-mashed potatoes, chicken piccata, and the beginnings of a chocolate cake. Draco throws flour in Harry’s face on a childish whim, and then darts around the kitchen aisle until Harry catches him and hauls him up onto it for a time-out. Draco proceeds to make a show of dipping his finger into the chocolate mix and sucking it clean.
Something about the simplicity of that statement is striking. Draco watches him leave, his chest aching. Then the office assistant breaks him out of his thoughts by giving him a shaky congratulations. Draco makes sure he can see how hard his eyes roll before he cuts off the connection. A few minutes later, he can hear Harry popping into the kitchen. He finds Draco still by the fireplace, who jumps up to hug him, breathing him in. Harry kisses him in greeting, a long, languid thing, tongue exploring his mouth. When they part, Harry kisses his jaw, and then down his neck, pausing to nip over his bond mark, and then down to his collarbones. He lets out a happy purr when Draco scratches his scalp, fascinated as ever by the surprising softness of his messy curls.
“You have gorgeous hair, darling,” she’d say, whenever Lily got huffy, playfully running her hands through it.
Merlin, not the doe eyes. Harry sighs through his nose, praying for patience. Draco had shyly attempted to entice him more days than not, back at St. Mungo’s. Harry was able to distract him with a few good orgasms, but he knew what Draco really wanted: to reconnect, to tie, to feel close again. Harry was able to excuse holding off on account of Draco’s injuries, but after his discharge and that wry assurance from the Healer (he wouldn’t be surprised if Draco mustered up the courage to ask him to say that while Harry was away), there’s no excuse.
Draco slants an endearingly crooked smile his way. There’s resignation and fondness, in the crook of those lips.
He learns that there are “work-arounds” to marriage prospects and being a half-blood, especially if one shows particular drive and talent, because genetic diversity is important. Scorpius can’t help but snort at that one.
They cackle helplessly in the gardens together, years of habit pulling them into weeding the garden. Father finds them there like that, and lets out a little noise of discontent when he sees them all covered in nosy snakes. Scorpius sends them away, and then they have a silly little moment of twin telepathy and present their handful of weeds for Father’s inspection.
Harry laughs softly. Draco presses restless kisses all along the side of his face, sighing and nuzzling, breathing in his scent. He locks his ankles behind Harry’s legs when he feels him shift minutely, absolutely terrified that he’s going to be left alone in their bed.
Harry winces. The guilt-tripping power of Pureblood mothers is legendary, but Oleander has a point. Save the Half-Bloods who have clawed their way into relevancy with the help of a Pureblood relative or sponsor, Half-Bloods are generally not allowed to have children. Anyone wanting to appeal the rule would have to get approval from their parents, and then write an extensive appeal to the Ministry’s Office of Family, which would finally be reviewed by Voldemort himself. Harry has no doubt in his mind that the madman would punish the Parkinsons for even making him view a request to intermarry with a family that’d almost been wiped out completely because of
“Right this way, sir,” the junior Auror says, holding her arm out for Harry to step through the cramped door.
Harry blinks and looks away. Crabbe steps carefully over the body. They continue walking. They have genuinely seen much worse.
he hears, a vaguely feminine voice burrowing into his consciousness like a gut feeling, like the impression of words. Draco muffles another sound of alarm into his hands.
She’s a tall, broad-shouldered woman, with bluntly cut dark hair dusting over her shoulders. She looks just as bedraggled as the rest of them, with a vertical scar trailing along the side of her face and light gray dust mottling her robes.
“I wanted to be the first one to bless you, sweetie,” he hears Bellatrix say, smug glee in her voice.
His expression quickly becomes troubled before he continues on. “That reminds me of something I should have told you a while back. Your uncle Rodolphus asked for something very similar. He wanted us to consider having a child that would be named his heir and take on his name. He thinks Bellatrix has--er--cursed him. So that he can’t have children.”
“No, that’s commendable work. You’ve always been very bright, I understand why our Lord would seek you out for service,” Draco says, almost entirely on autopilot. The words are bitter in his mouth, though, and he can see his distaste reflected in the pained look Theo shoots his way. “Well… I expect it’s a lot more complicated than what you’ll be able to tell me.”
“No, that happens sometimes. Do you have a crush you want to tell me about?” Father asks, a hint of teasing in his voice.
“My friends,” the Dark Lord says, his rasping voice washing over them all, crawling into their ears. “I thank you for joining me for our annual Beltane festivities. You may stand.”
“Takes time,” Anton lifts his free shoulder in a delicate shrug, careful not to disturb his nursing child. “And heat.”
“I want to see the steward and read all of his reports,” Draco says. “I want to go into the gardens and make love under the sun. I want to walk around the city. I want to wear my nightgowns in the daytime. I want to fly! I want to ride our horses along the river!”
The day of Father’s return was the one time Lucius Malfoy stepped foot in their cottage. He’d arrived to pick up an exhausted Nan, stared imperiously down at where she had a twin cradled under each arm with James clinging to her legs, and then asked Father if he was “quite alright” as Dad led him inside.
He pushes his knot inside Draco’s needy hole right as his orgasm steals the very breath from him. He presses his face into Draco’s neck and lets go, filling him with his seed. His skin tingles right down to his fingers and toes, his ears ringing lowly.
“No,” Harry says, as firmly as he can manage. “I think you’re the best thing that’s happened to me in years.”
Laughing, Harry pulls him in for a hug, and Draco melts into him, clinging unashamedly as Harry takes all of his weight.
“I will never understand what possessed our Lord to marry you to his little... attack dog.” Father complains.
And then he’s taking off his scarf and throwing it around Harry’s neck, fussing and tutting. Sirius tries and fails to act like he doesn’t wish Malfoy was putting the scarf on him. Harry waves goodbye as Malfoy drags him off to whatever function he’d arrived to collect him for.
“Oh, love,” Harry says, hands pushing Draco’s thighs apart, so wide he feels like there’s not an inch of his body that’s not on display. “You’re so wet for me. I could smell you, but this…”
“I was just joking,” Bellatrix hisses back, though she quickly subsides back into her chair when Voldemort gives her a look of warning.
Malfoy tenses beneath him. Sirius has to hide his groan at what it does to his knot with a loud, fake cough. "Yeah, Harry?"
They undo the ties on their robes, and let them fall to the floor. Draco leads him up the dais, and then onto the bed. Mother stubbornly braved Father’s disapproval to affix see-through curtains onto the bed, hoping to afford them the illusion of privacy. A surge of contrarian pride has Draco stilling Harry’s hand when it looks like he might raise his hand to spell them shut.
Sonja herself is waiting for them outside of the grand doors, her gloved hands clasped together. Like Draco, she’s rather tall for an Omega. She favors the color black--she’d worn mourning robes after the passing of her late wife, as is traditional, and then never kicked the habit. She’s wearing a gauzy black sundress today, and her deep brown hair, streaked with gray, is piled upon her head in a curly bun. There is a classical, aristocratic beauty in her high cheekbones and slender neck.
“There you go, baby,” Harry praises, kissing aimlessly along Draco’s sweaty forehead as he slows his thrusts, working his sobbing Omega through his orgasm. “So pretty for me.”
-Harry participates in a violent skirmish with other Death Eaters (with mentions of curses, blood, vague gore(?), death, etc)
Swallowing, Draco scribbles a brief reply asking if Daphne and Pansy can attend the teas as well, and sends it off with the owl without answering Mother’s question.
“I’m not,” Harry sheepishly admits, and then makes a face of mock offense when Draco’s lips curl into a smug smile. “Oi, don’t get all puffed up about it.
Draco is content to allow his friends to dominate the conversation. The urge to wrap himself in some of the blankets is great, but he resists and settles for covering his lap. As an afterthought, though, he gently snatches a small pillow or two, gathering them in his lap. The weight is comforting. He’ll nest properly when he goes home, with some of Harry’s things. He’s never been hit with the urge to do it around so many people he does not know very well. The loneliness is hitting hard.
There’s something a little naughty about the heaviness of that gaze, Draco thinks. Harry is not good at masking his expressions, and Draco has always been very good at watching him. He gets a guilty pleasure out of Harry watching him feed their baby, knowing that he’s pleased him, that he’s brought a new life into their tiny world. He doesn’t want to say it out loud, but it gives him a head rush stronger than any cup of expensive aged wine.
She’s a tall Alpha woman, severe faced and auburn haired. There’s an impatient gleam in her gray eyes, steely and nothing at all like Draco’s light ones. As they arrive one by one, she wordlessly gestures them towards the dining room’s long table. She does not meet any of their eyes, though her expression does tighten in obvious annoyance as their numbers grow. If there is one thing Harry has learned over the years, it’s this: if a Pureblood cannot hide their emotions behind a careful mask, they are bound to be erratic. This is going to be a tedious stay.
And Harry, oddly enough, finds himself haltingly recounting the less damning parts of his life. He speaks of his travels, of that frustrating handful of years trying to absorb Pettigrew’s lessons about high society, of happily twirling Draco around ballroom floors despite his two left feet. In turn, Fred talks of everyone from back home. He talks about their work, and the friends they’ve made along the way, and how sometimes Lowton has started to feel less like a prison and more like a little city on its own, nestled secretively in the poorly kept outskirts of London.
Aunt Luna tilts her little half smile at her and briefly pops back out, and then she’s stepping into their living room, elegant and unruffled as ever. Today, her earrings are chattering little chipmunks, and she’s wearing a very pretty pink muggle sundress, even though they’re currently knee-deep in winter.
. It bounces harmlessly off of a charm Draco didn’t even hear Harry call for. Aunt Bella lets out a growl of frustration, and the next few minutes are a tense blaze of nonverbal hexes, Harry’s bright green to her deep red. Mother gasps beside him, watching in open fascination.
Malfoy glances critically at his clothing, but then he nods and says, “You need a scarf. Come along, then!”
Draco’s still riding the contractions of the last release, so it burns, really reminds him that he’s taking more. Letting out a sobbing breath, he steadies himself with his hands, fucking back onto Harry’s fingers.
awful semester of my Master's program, so hopefully, I'll have more time and energy to post regular updates to all of my fics in the summer months. Wish me luck, and also hang in there if life is kicking your ass as hard as it's currently kicking mine!
The healers say Lucius Malfoy is staring down a stint in St. Mungo’s for the rest of his life if nobody takes him in, so their dads tentatively run it past them through letters and firecalls.
Though Draco started at the very bottom, he shares aimless trivia about the various other names listed on the paper. Some exact numbers have been lost to time, some names are accompanied by frustrated little notes pointing out that
“Shhhh,” Harry croons, using the hand he’s got on Draco’s jaw to tilt his head and bring him into a softer, gentler kiss, more a press of lips than anything.
Harry pulls him close, and soothes him into a pleasant haze with kisses and sweet nothings. As Draco settles on top of him for a rest, he glances out past the bed’s curtains to the window. The sky is darkening, losing all traces of the blended colors of sunset.
Faces rotate in and out of these meetings. Sometimes Daphne or Pansy cannot attend. Sometimes Draco is too tired to go. Sometimes those who are only passing through will reportedly not be seen again for months. However, aside from Sonja, there is one constant: Anezka Newman is always there, rain or shine, smiling and watching.
Draco bites his lip. Harry is in the middle of urging him to speak when the door to the parlor sweeps open. He retracts his hand and curses himself for not thinking to seal off the door with a charm.
As they walk, Theo tells him of nightmare spells and scrying and blood magic just a technical step away from necromancy, the latter of which is a jealously protected school of magic illegal for anyone who has not acquired a license to practice, even Death Eaters. The curse Draco had used had been found amongst an entry dedicated entirely to ritual sacrifice.
Once Harry’s knot goes down, Harry gathers him up in his arms, cleans the bed with several powerful charms, and carries Draco into the en-suite. He’s all but dead on his feet in the shower, leaning his head out of the spray to yawn loudly. Harry’s hands are gentle behind the fluffy washcloth. He misses nothing, even kneels to lift Draco’s feet and scrub gently between his toes. He cleans himself with military efficiency, dries them both down with a towel, and leads him back to bed.
Catching Sirius’ gaze, Malfoy gives him a tight smile. “The Heart nebula. Do you know of it? It’s in the constellation--”
Father rounds on him, pointing his finger in Grandfather's face. “Don’t you call my children ill-behaved. They’re lovely.”
The Auror department itself was overwhelmed by spell-resistant howlers. They delivered the same cryptic message in a distorted voice:
This elicits a round of laughter, which picks up as Alecto growls and fires a weak stinging hex Greyback’s way. He takes it with a low, rumbling laugh. Amycus throws an arm around his sister’s shoulders, chuckling.
Theo stands, so quickly that his shins knock into hardwood, which he doesn’t acknowledge beyond a momentarily pursed lip. He clears his throat and glances down at his Cantankerous, who gives him a proud smile.
They're in the dining room sharing a glass of firewhiskey, as they do now that they feel less guilty about it.
Across the sitting room, Malfoy gives Sirius an evil little smile. Kreacher takes a neatly wrapped gift up the stairs, not even sparing Sirius a glance.
“I don’t think anyone would believe me, considering they’d be able to smell you all over me,” Harry says.
That seems to knock the two of them out of their tense little revere. Draco flushes, and Pansy flinches.
When at last it is time for the duels to begin, Draco and his parents wait just at the edges of the magically partitioned space reserved for it all.
The question catches Draco off guard. He stretches, glances over at Harry. He’s stood by his desk, staring carefully down at assembled papers with a quill in hand. His handsome is especially bedraggled today—they’d woken up late, and then canoodled for a good two hours before doing anything. He’s all flyaway hairs and stubble (Draco squirms, remembering the way it felt between his thighs this morning) and restless hands. Usually, these hours in Harry’s office are spent in companionable silence, Draco nesting contentedly in the safe glow of his Alpha’s presence, so conversation always stands out.
Theo nods wordlessly, and Harry takes his leave of the living room. On his way to the study, he pauses to poke his head into the bedroom. Draco is bundled snugly in the blankets. Both of their sleep schedules have taken a hit since the bombings, but Draco’s fatigue is so pervasive as to be alarming. Their first appointment with the specialist Healer is approaching, and Harry intends to ask about ways to get Draco sleeping regularly.
Bellatrix lets out a vindictive laugh. Harry glances over at Rodolphus, whose resentment is clear in narrowed eyes and tense shoulders. Then he rearranges his expression and posture into neutrality, so quick about it that Harry questions that the moment of weakness happened at all.
True to his word, he goes to the shower without a fuss this time, but not before pushing his wand underneath his pillow. The thought of the approaching hour is filling him with a peculiar dread. What if he can’t get Harry to stay where he needs him? What if the wish doesn’t work? What if, what if? Harry mistakes his uneasy silence for the usual heat-induced malaise, which he is genuinely feeling. It’s just overshadowed by other things.
“That’s right, Draco. You always ask me for what you need, I won’t accept anything less,” Harry hisses.
To his intense irritation, the next time he blinks, hot tears roll down his face. He attempts to wipe them away, but his fine leather gloves do little more than smear them. Frustrated, he plucks them off and throws them to the floor, ignoring Father’s noise of disapproval as he scrubs his face dry.
He looks darling in robes of periwinkle, all accented frills and intricate stitchings. Then he goes and ruins the illusion of the sweet little debutante by telling Sirius that he’s looking especially dreadful this morning, cousin, has he showered? Sirius realizes, with no small amount of horror, that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Draco parts his lips and draws him in, the warm wet heat of his mouth drawing a moan straight from Al's throat. He bobs his head slowly, tongue sweeping over the vein along the underside of Al's cock, and when he nose reaches the dark curls at his base, swallows. It sends a ripple of sensation along his length. He squeezes Al's hip, and with a curse he matches Draco's leisurely rhythm, enjoying the sight of those lips stretched pink and swollen around him. Draco's looking up at Al from underneath the fan of his lashes, and there's a coyness there that he loves. Al decides that he should close his eyes or he'll come way too soon. He spends the next few moments with his head pleasantly clouded, fingers flexing into the velvet of the day bed, his toes curling in his shoes.
“Father makes fun of Daddy all the time for not knowing how to dress without him.” Lily says, not wanting the moment to end.
The single word draws the attention of several portraits, who clatter to voice their own hellos. Some were dozing--who knew how long Father had been observing the progenitor portrait in silence. Grandfather Abraxas is the only one to greet him with anything approaching warmth (many of them have witnessed his scoldings more than once), and Draco gives the man an appreciative smile on his way in.
There’s another silence, and then a frustrated sigh. Draco thinks that Weasley is going to drop it. Then he huffs and says, “Not a Death Eater.”
One day, Scorpius falls asleep, right there on Draco’s chest, and Draco doesn’t have the heart to wake him and make him finish, even though he really should. Harry watches with open curiosity as Draco sighs and carries him over to his crib, not bothering to button his shirt back up. He feels silly, turning to Harry with his small breasts exposed, a lazy dribble of milk trailing down one nipple, still. Predictably, his gaze zeroes in on Draco's chest.
Sokolov attempts to right himself, rising up to his hands and knees. Voldemort shoves him back down to the floor with a wordless swipe of his wand and presses his foot onto Sokolov’s face, grinding it slowly into the intricately threaded kazakh carpet below. “I did not give you permission to stand, Dima.”
He spends a few more minutes gentling Draco and then begins anew, movements quickly deteriorating from a careful rhythm to the single-minded determination of the chase. Draco is completely spent, but the sensation is still wonderful in a shivery, achy sort of way, just this side of too much. Soft, mewling noises fall from his lips unbidden, an ache building in his thighs and belly and radiating deliciously outward.
“Don’t you understand why I would want to help them, even a little bit? The way we live, we can't keep doing this. It isn’t right. Keeping slaves, breaking up families, invading other countries? What about your husband? He’s a Half-Blood. You love each other, you talk. I've seen you. Doesn’t he ever feel wrong? Like he doesn’t belong?” Anezka says, pressing her hands together.
Draco was the first of them to marry, though Daphne and Blaise have been betrothed since they were young. Building nascent pack bonds is encouraged for pure blood children. They’re perfectly balanced--Alphas Vincent and Greg prided themselves on being their protectors, Theo and Blaise kept them in line with their beta calm, and Omegas Draco, Pansy, and Daphne rounded them out. He’s missed them, even though it’s time for him to start building a family of his own.
Predictably, Harry hooks his fingers into the fabric and rips them with a casual, impatient strength that makes his stomach flutter pleasantly. He blows cool air over Draco’s hole, and then follows up with another long lick, from the top of his crack to the sensitive skin just behind his balls. Draco pushes back into the feeling, letting out a low whine.
Draco pulls back just in time to see Mother giving Father a tired look. He has the good grace to apologize. Half-Blood or not, Harry’s magic had been strong enough to earn him a place at the Dark Lord’s side, and that will always give him power. He’d apparently been working his way up the ladder for almost a decade. The Dark Lord saw fit to revive the Potter line as a reward for his hard work--any children of theirs will be first generation Purebloods--and Draco, a rare and treasured Omega from two storied bloodlines, had been chosen to make that happen.
Draco looks up, and sure enough, there is a figure in scarlet robes standing a few feet away from them.
After debating to himself for a little while, Draco decides that this is a bridge he will cross in the future. An argument that will come years and years in the future is nothing compared to what needs to happen now. Draco marks the page, closes the diary, and eats his cake.
As usual, it's 2:19 in the morning and I've got to be up in five hours. Please forgive any odd mistakes. Enjoy!
“Perfect! Maybe you’ll stop asking altogether!” Pansy yells, sounding suspiciously like she’s in his living room.
“That’s not a terrible idea. They could serve as a buffer for the pogrebins. My contact says the forest is teeming with the things. They're not very strong, but they can be a nuisance if they're not dealt with quickly.” Dolohov muses.
“It is,” Beauregard agrees, giving him a sympathetic smile. “But you have to remember, Mr. Potter. Reputation is important for Omegas.”
Minky pops back in with their tea and leaves with a gentle pop. Grateful for the distraction, Harry blows gently on his cup.
“You’re not supposed to eat them, true… it’s more a way for people to share their blessings with newlyweds. We have to kiss each other for every berry we get. In private, Harry!” He adds, laughing and turning his head when Harry leans in.
It occurs to Draco that he’s never been asked this question before. It takes him a moment to put his reply together, and he finds himself regretting that he froze the cauldron.
-There is a Bad Touch moment between Draco and Voldemort, beginning with the sentence, "Then his bright red gaze slides over to Draco, who lowers his eyes."
It’s the smell of good food that awakens Harry, but only the sound of shouting voices is what gets him out of bed.
Harry would know, certainly, but he feels weirdly resistant to asking about it. After all that Harry has been teaching him, he’s afraid to reveal yet another thing he’s clueless about. He’s sure he looks like enough of a child as is.
Draco won’t accept any more protests. He agrees to greet Harry’s friends when they arrive, and then find something to do right away. No matter how nervous he is, his manners won’t allow him to get away with not welcoming guests to his home.
He doesn’t have his diary, but three new truths are swirling around in his head, effectively distracting him from the loss. One, Lily Potter is dead because of the man her son now serves. Two, she was the child of Muggles. Finally, she gave birth to Harry, and Draco loves her for it.
Harry gathers it up with his fingers, and then pushes it back inside, fingers crooking and scoring over his prostate. Draco lets out a little hiccup, arching away from the pleasure-pain. He’s too spent to come again, but it does leave him dizzy by the time Harry is done. Harry rolls him gently onto his back, a soft little smile on his lips. Draco has never seen this expression before.
Draco leans forward, a whine tumbling from his lips as he finds an angle that suits him. He can feel himself going deeper, spearing into wet walls that take him easily as anything, clenching tightly around him with each outward pull. Another of Al's impatient thrust stills him, though it's with clear reluctance, a little whimper falling from his lips. Al surges up to swallow the sound with his mouth. And then Draco does something with his body, rippling around him in this intense, pulsating press of his insides, pulling a loud sound from Al's throat.
“You may be right in thinking Umbridge is your enemy,” Harry says, matter of factly. “She’s an opportunist. But you’ve got nothing to fear from people who aren’t, er, like you. At least not more than anybody else. Though I know it’s easy to just say, ‘Don’t be scared,’ so who knows how helpful any of this really is.”
“Her name was Lilly. Pettigrew said she was pretty smart. He gave me some pictures of their friend group, you know, when I first started working with him. I’ll show them to you some time. I have her eyes.”
Because James can’t seem to take most things seriously, a delighted guffaw bursts from his chest. Scorpius bites his lip to contain his answering laugh.
“It’s alright, love,” Harry croons, pulling him closer. Draco clings to him with all of his strength, uncaring of the ugly noises pulled from his mouth. Harry kisses his cheek, and all along the side of his face, humming and petting him like a child. A strong, warm hand rubs briskly along his spine, the other curling around his opposite shoulder to keep them pressed flush.
“Oh yes, yes, I imagine you must be quite popular at those events,” Borgin says, head bobbing in a nod. Seeing Father linger over the artifact, he adds, “That one is fresh from China, Mr. Malfoy! So laden with traditional protective charms that it’s physically heavy to handle, if you can believe it! It would be an excellent gift for a grandchild…?”
Voldemort says the last word in a snarl of Parseltongue, but the sentiment is clearly felt by all. The temperature in the room rapidly drops. Harry tenses, and he sees more than a few others doing the same. He can see frost blooming on his glasses and the gray puff of his breath on his next exhale. He wouldn’t dare risk a warming charm in a moment like this, though.
“It is most curious,” The Dark Lord hums, reaching out and brushing some of the hair on Draco’s forehead aside.
He hurries away, following the signs leading to the bar in the back. When he catches sight of Harry waiting by the bar, he lets out a sigh of relief and walks over as fast as good manners will allow, curtseying and nodding in greeting to everyone who attempts to stop him. Harry lets out a noise of surprise when Draco sidles up to him, and then laughingly throws an arm around Draco’s shoulders when he fussily asks to be held.
Harry shoes the staff away and dresses Draco himself, dipping in and out of his closet to procure his clothing. It’s much too big for him, but Harry waves his hands and alters the clothing until it fits. The white tunic, with its dipping collar, is airy and moveable. The riding breeches, well-fitted and cut off below the knee, feels at once restrictive and far too revealing. Draco twists and turns before a mirror, frowning.
“Was this a genuine request for help or another seduction attempt?” Harry asks, pulling Draco flush to his front.
Harry takes him with deep, punishing thrusts, growling when Draco tries to move. The little push and pull is thrilling in an entirely new way. He knows that Harry would never hurt him--not in any way he didn’t ask for, at least--but the rabbiting jolt of not-quite fear that spikes in his belly each time Harry stills him makes him whimper.
“I won’t, sweetheart,” Harry whispers into his ear, grunting as another wave of orgasm rolls through him. “After all, you want a baby, don’t you?”
Harry quickly agrees, then guides him through the cafe with a hand on his back. They walk in silence until they make it to a quiet hallway and Draco’s knees feel weak enough that they have to stop walking. Harry catches him easily, murmuring words of comfort into his hair and pulling him back upright. Every place he touches makes his skin tingle through layers and layers of fabric. A spell of dizziness sends his head lolling back onto Harry’s shoulder, and his Alpha noses along his neck with a groan.
“Of course I have. He thought it was a wonderful idea,” Draco replies. “We meant to ask you together, at a more appropriate time.”
“Yes. Salazar help me, I do.” Draco answers, without a hint of hesitation. “I’ve never felt like this before.”
Harry glances up at him to check in, but his glasses are foggy and askew on his handsome face. Draco readjusts them. Harry kisses him in thanks when he’s done, and then briefly pauses to wipe the damp glass on Draco’s bralette.
The elves at the Manor let Al in without question. They've been doing it for years, ever since Al first bullied his parents into letting him spend the night with the only friend he made in Slytherin. These days, though, they let him in with a delighted little twinkle in their eyes if he comes without Scorpius. They've been some of his biggest helpers in all of this, making food and scattering rose petals and placing notes in strategic places.
He’s dismayed when their offer of dinner is accepted. Maybe he should stop saying things, because they keep coming true.
“You come back to the estate this instant, Pansy Hawthorne Parkinson,” he says, “I won’t ask you again.”
Theo orders for them all, by now familiar with what they’d like. As their waitress leaves them, Draco absentmindedly thanks her, which makes her grin bashfully as she walks away. He turns back to the table to find all of his friends giving him a range of disturbed looks.
Draco breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth, hoping to expel some of his nerves along the way. Healer Ouedraogo gives him a sympathetic smile.
Pettigrew takes the seat nearest Harry, and he’s watched curiously by several others, Blishwick amongst them. Very few members of the Dark Lord’s inner circle call him anything other than Wormtail, and the habit has spread, much to Voldemort’s dark amusement. Harry’s always made it a point to use his name.
he’d remembered someone writing for the Daily Prophet, after some student hoping for a quick buck took photo after photo of them huddling affectionately.
Harry reverses the damage with a few concentrated waves of his wand. The last thing to flutter back into place is the old family diary, and it lands on a page dominated by a magically animated drawing of moon phases. When the moon hits its zenith at the top of the page, it pauses minutely before continuing down in an arc to the other side. Harry watches the cycle repeat itself a few times, feeling oddly like something is crawling around in his thoughts. Then he shakes his head and closes the diary. It’s an old book, undoubtedly preserved by several centuries’ worth of preservation and protective charms. No typical Pureblood parents would have passed it down to their children without being absolutely sure of its safety (and certainly not Lucius and Narcissa, who adore their son), but magical items have a way of building a kind of consciousness over time. It needs to be appraised, if only for Harry’s peace of mind.
“I don’t know,” Draco wheezes, and then he covers his face and giggles again, turning away from Harry in a fit of bashfulness.
James gets an assortment of books on Herbology, which he accepts with a brief glance at Lucius and no small amount of pleasure. He also gets a stack of the newest PlayStation games, which Lily immediately declares a “group gift.” Scorpius gets the Potions kit he’s been wanting for some time now, hoping to brush up on the subjects he needs to excel in for work as an Unspeakable. Lily gets a gorgeous new guitar with a glamour on it that changes to accommodate the emotions of its player; when she strums a light, unthinking tune on it, it glitters bright pink. Al is surprised to be given the newest wizarding and muggle cameras. He’s hinted at an interest in photography, but never to the point where he’d expect his parents to encourage it. The thought of creating pictures instead of collecting them is exciting.
For a moment, it looks as though he’s about to get what he wants—Harry lines up, pressing the head of his cock against Draco’s hole. Draco rolls his hips down, biting his lip when the head breaches him. Then Harry scoots away from him, hand pressing firmly on his hip to still his movement. Draco lets out a wretched little sob and reaches for Harry’s cock.
“Is this true, Mr. Potter?” Davies asks, addressing Harry directly. “You know the use of such magics by Omegas is a serious offense.”
It all begins normally. Familiar gray and white shapes are projected before them, along with the comforting thump of a heartbeat. Then, Healer Ouedraogo lets out a little gasp, and Harry’s heart drops.
And then Harry begins fucking him in short, rutting bucks, pressing his front along Draco’s back. The position doesn’t really allow him to pull out all the way, but that’s not the goal. Like this, Draco can feel Harry all around him, mouth trailing wetly behind his ear, one hand dipping beneath to stroke his sensitive cock while the other links their fingers.
“We could draw from the stock in global dominions, surely,” says Rodolphus. “It is a promising idea, Mr. Nott.”
“I’m not. First, they’ll give the Aurors a warrant to search their homes. Then they might seize whatever assets they have. They’ll be asked why they didn’t do anything to stop you, or why they didn’t speak up, whether they knew it or not. They might even get blacklisted for work if their answers aren’t satisfactory--and they’re usually not.”
Voldemort has already made his way inside the school proper by the time the Death Eaters storm the vast green lawn of the courtyard. The dark miasma that overtakes his body during short-form apparition is distinctive, and Harry can see it lingering behind windows just before they burst in tinkling waterfalls of glass, screams ringing out into the air before falling abruptly silent.
“Well, it’s certainly a complete bond.” Mother eventually says, which is about as diplomatic as she will likely get.
“Your Father thinks it would help him for us to talk. But I’m not sure how much time he’d give to a blood traitor,” Aunt Andromeda says, wryly.
Draco is gazing up at him with such adoration that it makes Harry’s chest tighten. He doesn’t deserve that. Yet, he can’t stop himself from reveling in it.
“Well, it’s not as though they need the money,” huffs Draco, rolling his eyes outright as one of the loud new money Alphas tosses his galleons cheerily into the pot in support of the Yaxley.
The first thing he sees is a hand-drawn diagram. His own name is near the very bottom. He gasps once he realizes what it is.
I've been reading Next Gen fic for years, certainly before Cursed Child. I never read Cursed Child though, and Al and Scorpius are literally twins in this, so this is 100% not canon. None of this is canon, obviously. This fic is planned out and mostly finished, and my goal is to post one chapter a week until it's complete, but no promises. Pandemic life is kicking my butt. That said, I hope you enjoy this!
Harry interrupts him. “That’s not my name right now, sweetheart.” And then his teeth sink into the fleshy part of his inner thigh, his tongue dragging hot and wet over the stinging skin.
would give birth to. He has never worn it, but he carries it with him wherever he goes, as a reminder to himself.
(“We’re not so different, you and I,” He’d said, once, plucking grass out of her hair. She’d cut a neat little circle into the garden because Scorpius made her angry. Father hadn’t been upset with her for messing with his garden, just worried. Nothing grows in that circle, now, so Code and the other snakes like to curl up there for warmth when the sun gets high.)
"Please what, love?" Draco's not even looking at him. His silken hair is hiding his face as he stares down. Al slides one hand into it, and he pushes into the feeling with a low, rumbling purr, the sound filling him with a hint of smug satisfaction. No matter how Draco plays around with him, he can't hide what that sound means.
,” Harry says, knocking his shoulder against Draco's. Draco pushes back, but gently, ever the proper one unless someone's angered him. “Great job stopping me from making this
Greyback is a ferocious fighter, skillful at combining his magic with his lycanthropy. He’s all gnashing teeth and clawed fingers and gleeful growls, and he unseats opponent after opponent until it’s Aunt Bella’s turn. She blinds him with a Conjunctivitis Curse, and then follows up with a Blood Boiling Curse, which makes Draco flinch. One of his earliest memories is of her using this on one of the Manor’s elves. He doesn’t remember why (with her, there may not have been a reason), but he will never forget their pained cries, or the rippling of their skin. Greyback falls to his knees, baring his teeth her way. She rotates her wand, increasing the strength, he knows--sure enough, Greyback finally lets out the pained roar she was no doubt looking to hear, and withdraws.
“Calling what you did trouble is a gross understatement. You were given the chance to make your country’s transition a peaceful one. Instead, you and that little spinster you people had the nerve to call the ‘headmaster’ spat in my face. You poisoned the minds of some of your brethren. You endangered Pureblooded children by housing them in close quarters with unleashed Muggles. Containing you cost me hundreds of thousands of my Mudbloods and far too many hardworking Death Eaters. I would not call that trouble. I would call it
Draco nods, eyes falling closed. One of Harry’s hands slips from his hip to splay wide over his belly, the other sliding covetously down his arched back to curl around his shoulder and pull him back onto Harry’s cock. Draco buries his face into the sheets to cry out his name. He can scarcely catch his breath, hitching little gasps bursting from his aching throat, cock slowly filling back up, Harry’s teeth are worrying over their bondmark and he’s aching in the best possible way, feeling like he could fall into pieces if he shakes any harder than he already is.
“Right,” Ron agrees, nodding his head. “Lost his bloody marbles the moment he got some gold in his Gringotts.”
“Merlin, you’re a lucky little thing,” the tailor tells Draco, helping him up onto a stool. “Makes me want to twist your ear a bit.”
“Harry, I panicked. Please, please understand, I thought she was going to hurt us. Please don’t leave me—”
Right away, Harry understands that Rodolphus wants something from him. He’d had his suspicions the moment they established a seating arrangement without some showy display of Rodolphus’ seniority as an Alpha, but sharing a vulnerability in this way has meaning.
Father gave it to him shortly after his first heat, as a reminder of his duty to their family. He remembers the swell of pride that lingered for days after, at the thought of passing the ring down to the next family heir, the heir that
