“I didn’t…” Draco broke off and looked past Harry until he looked him straight in the eye again. “Why do you care? It’s just the facts of the case, you
"Draco –" A finger settles on Harry's lips, silencing him.
Draco nodded slightly and Harry's heart sank to his toes. "Only a little. Don't stop, I just need –" Draco's breath faltered, he dropped his head back and squeezed his eyes shut, as if he could simply wish the pain away.
frightening and he felt clearly too close to the abyss, but there was more. The feeling of freedom, which spread slowly but surely through Harry's veins, as soon as he felt the wind in his hair. And Draco. More precise Draco's body pressed close to Harry's, nipped any logical thought in the bud.
Jimar makes a vague gesture with his hand. "I quit, but they would have sacked me anyway. Both the hospital and –" He falters and shrugs. "You know."
. But they're
Draco blinked in irritation at the Muggle and only understood what he was asking when he nodded in the direction of the Devil's Stairs.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but with a glance at Ron’s plate, he realised that he wasn’t the only one who needed to recharge energy. Ron and Hermione had certainly made full use of the empty dormitory, even if Harry didn’t want to think about it. “Yes, I didn’t have any dinner last night,” he explained, which caused Hermione to look at him doubtfully. Even Ron didn’t seem to believe him completely.
Only a fraction of what was possible and yet everything I had dreamed of.
"Would you like to ride?" Draco asked and turned back to Harry, who only frowned sceptically. "Why walk when we have a pony?"
"She's exaggerating," Draco intervened. "But you can still watch it."
Each day is as eventful as it is uneventful, and Harry is perfectly at ease losing himself in the lack of variety.
"The bet was originally a joke by Krum. I overheard him joking with Granger about taking my virginity. For him, it was all just an even bigger game, he never made any promises to anyone, always made it unmistakably clear that he didn't want to commit to anything. Granger got angry, she insisted that I – that I wouldn't do it. I didn't know at the time, but today I know that despite the games, despite the disappointment, she was convinced that I would choose our friendship over the game. That I would know when enough was enough."
Harry grinned and looked down at Draco. In their position, he towered over Draco and Feykir just a little bit, and that was only because the spectator stands of the riding hall were built high. "You promised me better than good and you kept your word."
“Malfoy, we need to talk!” he said determinedly, as soon as he stopped in front of the Slytherins, who looked at him in wonder.
Harry frowned in surprise. He'd somehow assumed that Draco only did that because he knew it caused something in Harry to boil over. That was
Draco's mouth stood slightly open, his cheeks now tinted in bright red, his eyebrows furrowed, but his eyes glowed with such intensity that it drove Harry half-mad. Draco was speechless and Harry's heart turned somersaults because it had never felt so free before.
Ron sighed and yawned simultaneously as he stretched. “Because I know you, and only you would think of something like that in your situation.” Even though Ron was obviously right, Harry was annoyed that he was so easy to read. “If it makes you feel any better, I'm very sure our little Ariel would love to have a taste of your snitch,” Ron added with a chuckle.
"I'm not implying anything, Potter," Malfoy interrupted me sharply. "You're the one who's trying to sound me out, even though you're utterly unqualified to do so."
"Then why did you... Why did you even…" Draco shook his head, unable to find the right words.  Harry understood him anyway.
Draco raised his head and returned Harry's gaze. A slow smile touched the corners of his mouth, Harry was quite sure that his face spoke volumes. He would never be able to hide his fascination with the blond.
The week has already started, so the routine is only consolidated. On Mondays, Harry wishes he could get a second Sunday, but on Tuesdays, he feels engulfed by his daily routine and has long forgotten about the weekend. It is the day when Harry is most motivated, which is why George always introduces him to new projects on Tuesdays and Angelina always chooses this day to invite Harry for a visit to the Burrow.
His own magic seems far too powerful in contrast to Draco's, like a thundering waterfall trying to compete with a babbling brook. But it's not just Draco's magic that glimmers weakly. His heartbeat also drums powerlessly next to Harry's own. It is as if he is breathlessly pleading to be let go.
, would even call himself confident, but hell! This involved too much initiative and contemplations for one person. So he preferred to just go with it and let the future come to him. Sooner or later Draco would notice that Harry's obsession couldn't be of a complete heterosexual nature and then, yes, then it was Draco's turn to
This cannot be. Harry refuses to believe it. "So he is only under suspicion," he states slowly. "Has anything been proven so far?"
Draco threw Harry an amused look over his shoulder, Harry's knees felt like Molly's Jelly. Somehow, he managed to walk down the hallway without making a complete idiot of himself. Draco pushed open the door to their room, they crossed the threshold, Harry's stomach exploded with excitement. The door fell shut behind them, Draco turned on his heel to Harry, his gaze drifted greedily to Harry's lips and –
This felt like the sign he had been waiting for.
Slowly, Draco lowered the parchment, then looked at Harry with dull eyes that reflected all his hidden pain. “No.”
Draco's smile became smug, his eyes dark. "Incredibly rude. Eat me, Potter, I've thought this
But Malfoy seemed to like what he was hearing. A small smile snuck into the right corner of his mouth. "So you're saying you invaded my diary for personal reasons? Now that's heartwarming, Potter. Don't tell me you missed me."
"I see my letters have reached you," he states with satisfaction.
“I need to talk to you!" Harry explained determinedly, ignoring the little witch in her picture frame.
to Harry that he didn't want to miss anymore.
Harry grins at the memory.
saved
Several times Harry sets about writing a letter to Gawain Robards, but he has no official reason yet to appeal the Ministry's decision. Officially, he does not know anything about the cancellation of the project yet and he does not want to get Jimar into trouble. His letters to Healer Isaksen also remain unwritten – he knows that even without his request, the Healer will do everything in her power to keep her patient alive.
Harry is left alone. The silence roars in his head and his thoughts are spinning.
“Has it been like this since you were born? Is this a lifetime-thing?” Harry continued to ask unabashedly. Now it was too late anyway, so Draco could be completely honest right away.
Actually, Harry didn’t want to ask, but it wasn’t as if fate would give him a choice. "Is Draco in there?" He pointed to the office door and stopped in front of Blaise. He glanced at him briefly, then nodded slowly. Harry nodded as well, then skimmed the notes on the noticeboard. That's all he wanted to know, even though the information was of absolutely no use to him.
Draco, his gaze firmly glued on Harry, nodded slightly.
and is again drawn by the talented aceveria-art!
"Here," Draco murmured and dropped the tube on Harry's chest, Harry kept staring at the label with wide eyes. Draco placed a condom next to the tube, then sat up and began tying a high ponytail at breakneck speed. Harry wasn't sure whether to continue staring at the tube in perplexity or enjoy the seductive sight. Draco was anything but tidy, primarily he just rushed, causing all the shorter wisps of hair to fall out of the ponytail and fall back into his face. As soon as the hair tie was where Draco wanted it, his gaze fell on Harry's face. "Something wrong?"
Draco, the breathtakingly beautiful bastard, sat leaning against the bedpost next to Harry's feet, held his sketchbook in his hands and also a pencil. His hair was a little tousled but loose, his teeth were buried in his lower lip and his eyes flitted back from Harry to the paper in front of him. The blanket covered his centre, his chest and legs were still completely exposed. As exposed as Harry felt and apparently was. A look down confirmed his feeling. He lay completely naked in Draco's bed and was entirely at his mercy.
Harry just stared at Draco, barely noticing the slight pink flush on his cheeks. Draco was gay? Well, it didn't exactly surprise Harry, nobody was able to just
Harry kisses a path down Draco's neck and chest, running his tongue over every inch of pale skin. Hands buried in Harry's hair, Draco arches his back and presses against Harry, gasping. The sweet sounds spur Harry on, his lips ghosting over Draco's shivering stomach and finding their way down to his thighs.
Lost in thought, Harry shoved a spoonful of pudding into his mouth and chewed on it. Petunia would have slapped him on the head for it, but the Dursleys were far in the past.
Harry’s grey matter was in full swing. Was that an offer to…? To what exactly? He dared to doubt that Draco would suddenly give in and surrender to Harry, so what was the alternative? But the offer sounded tempting, no matter the outcome, maybe he should think less and nod more!
He brings Draco's hand to his lips and breathes a kiss on the fingers.
"I don't know." Luna thoughtfully brushes one of the long blonde locks behind her ear, where little carrot figurines dangle from the lobes. "I think it's good for all of us to talk about the past with someone who knows how to handle it. And if that makes you too uncomfortable, then I'm sure you can get in touch with Dean or Seamus."
Harry’s belt fell and Draco, leaving no space between their bodies, set about opening his trousers. Hold on. What did this all boil down to? Harry truly couldn’t get enough of Draco’s touch, but he wouldn’t be able to cope with having to neglect Draco again. No, that would be too much to ask of his pride. After all, Harry wasn’t one to be served. He wanted to see Draco in ecstasy, to hear his moans, to feel his muscles twitching – oh Merlin, he couldn’t miss out on that any longer.
In the kitchen, the drawers have been ripped open and there are dishes, pots and food scattered everywhere. In the middle, he finds a cloth bag filled to the brim, the contents of which Harry can only guess at. The same mess awaits him in the living room, where books, cushions and picture frames that have fallen to the floor have been thrown about.
"Been better," Draco admitted, his eyes glued on Harry.
is a concept that exists," Harry remarked, as soon as he had recovered from his shock.
Hermione narrows her eyes and looks sharply at Harry. "What do you mean by that?”
"Harry, he's
Later, Draco was persuaded by his friends to sit by the campfire behind the guesthouse. Alcohol was passed around and Draco would have liked to have had the willpower to refuse, but he didn't have it. Draco had to realise that not even alcohol helped after such a day and he fought the drunken feeling with water and the greasy snacks Longbottom had stolen from the kitchen.

We can talk on the phone. And text. And I'll come and visit you as often as I can."
And many thanks to my lovely Beta
"If this matter is so important to you, why have you never told Malfoy's diary that he is dying? Surely it would serve everyone's best if you just bit the bullet."
As if he is saying goodbye to his life, to Harry, to all of this.
“Ohh, how rebellious,” Hermione replied in Ron’s place and reaped an affirmative laugh from the redhead.
"It's king-size, you can't blame her." Draco shrugged, but then turned to Ron with a dangerous glint in his eye and a mischievous smile on his lips. "I'd be willing not to tell Granger about your little rendezvous if -"
Malfoy had not asked another time why he had been convicted, he had just accepted it after my vague confirmations of his theory. We did not talk often about the five years that had passed. Instead, I tried to make up for the two years before when I had lost track of Malfoy. That took up more than enough time.
Harry's jaw dropped somewhere between his feet. Judging by the look on Ron's face, he seemed no less surprised.
, I have no clue at all."
"You’re making it too easy," chuckled Draco, rose from the sofa and walked towards Harry. "Come on,
Wait, had Draco just said that
that Draco was doing the work for him, so he could use all his concentration to not come instantly. "Relax, don't think," Draco breathed to his ear, fondling his hair, the movement of his hips turned sluggish. Harry sighed, focused only on Draco's scent and the closeness of his body. He actually relaxed.
“Neither do you,” Draco replied calmly. Harry wanted to assure Draco here and now, even swear that he wouldn’t stop having feelings for him, that he didn’t have to fear unrequited love in the future, but he couldn’t. It would’ve been a lie. Draco was right. Neither of them knew what the future would bring.
"How do I know you won't lie?" I asked, keeping my wand where it was.
Draco's allusions were hardly –
After repeating her last year at Hogwarts, Hermione successfully completed her training as a Curse-Breaker at St Mungo's Hospital and has been working there as a full-fledged employee ever since. Therefore, it would not be particularly surprising if she knew about Malfoy.
to watch them train. There's something
Another thought aids him in distracting himself from his doubts. It does not leave him alone, causing him to think back over and over again to the Trophy Room with Malfoy's memories. He visualises the picture frames in front of him, their contents lingering in his mind's eye. But that is not all – his focus keeps getting drawn back to a very particular picture frame that was labelled with a six.
Harry tried hard not to stare at Draco too much during the day, but he was not successful at all. He was fascinated by him, of course. After all, he had discovered something quite captivating about the Slytherin. The teachers and students around him showed little understanding for his supposedly inexplicable staring and so he was admonished three times in Potion class alone that he should please focus more on his work and less on
Harry thought quietly to himself.
Draco tensed up even more. "I overslept, and there was no time to –"
"We support you in all your decisions," Ron adds firmly. "But we want you to be completely sure of the risk you're taking."
beautiful even at seventeen, Potter!"
“You wouldn't dare,” he said haltingly, while his angry expression morphed into one of sheer surprise.
going to help you spy on a naked Draco Malfoy!”
. At least it wasn't
Jimar smirks at Harry. "Healer Isaksen explained that he's losing magic like others lose blood out of a wound. If the dwindling magic pools into a certain bulk, it can result in uncontrolled spurts of magic. For example, a chair flies across the room, even though no one has touched it. It's a bit like children's magic."
I closed my eyes in torment but gave a slight nod. "I don't want to lose you."
“Now you're talking like your little Ariel,” Ron mocked reproachfully.
, the need to hold the blond in his arms, to protect him – which was absolutely
Harry hesitates, not quite sure what to reply to that. Draco refers to the dragon's constellation of stars that appears on the skin when the spell proves successful. Draco told him about this in the diary, but he does not know where his dragon emerges. Now, that is not entirely the truth. He suspects it but does not know it.
Their laughter slowly faded away, first turning into giggles and then being replaced by the chirping of crickets and the humming of bees. Harry turned his head towards Draco, who was already looking at him. The storm-grey eyes studied him without judgement, only gentleness could be read in them. There was a soft smile on his lips and a light blush was covering his cheeks.
“You’ve already saved everyone. My family, my friends and me. Consider your task fulfilled.” Draco’s words were empty, even if Harry could read honest gratitude in the grey eyes.
Draco took a few seconds, then sighed. "Then I guess we'd better put your theory to the test."
Hermione raised one eyebrow, glanced briefly over Harry’s shoulder, then back at Harry. “Does it have anything to do with the fact that you’re the talk of all the Slytherins?"
It took Draco a full five seconds to collect himself, he tucked a loose strand of hair behind his ear (the high ponytail had been replaced by a low bun in the neck) and then focused his attention back to his boots. "Looks painful," he said without looking at Harry.

Malfoy had gone half a shade paler and his posture had stiffened. "I –"
struck with full force and didn’t allow him to decide freely against or in favour of it.
"Would you –" Harry tried again, breathlessly. "Would you wear knickers for me?"
, Harry admonished himself and hurriedly glided his gaze across the house tables until it landed on the Slytherin table and found a certain blond there.
This was not Draco Malfoy. This in front of me was not even an actual person. It was merely an imprint, a memory, and much less.
“Promise me that you’ll return the ring to him at dawn and not use the power to harm anyone,” demanded Harry. He didn’t know how much ancient waterspirits bet on promises, but it was worth a try.
Robards' reply sat on Harry's breakfast table on Saturday morning, the invitation in it clear. It is a Tuesday afternoon appointment, which indicates to Harry that the Ministry does not consider the case a priority. The fact that he has received such a prompt reply at all is because of his name, but Harry tries not to get hung up on that.
to find the right words when the pressure weighed on him. He couldn't afford another misstep, otherwise, that would be the end of it. Then Harry had destroyed it all once more.
"Only if they catch me," Jimar interrupts her lightly. "I've quit my job and there's nothing else keeping me in England. If I get the chance to pay off my debt before I leave, I intend to do so."
Harry simply sat out the next day's lessons. He even kept himself from staring at Draco for unnecessarily long durations, which Ron and Hermione seemed to notice. At lunch, Harry finally told them about Draco's curse, but this time he made sure that nobody overheard them, especially Seamus. As expected, they were both shocked, but Hermione immediately offered to go to the library right after afternoon class to research blood curses, and Harry decided to help her with that. Ron said he would get in touch with his brother Bill. After all, the Weasleys were also a pure-blood family, this kind of curse could not have been kept secret forever. If anyone knew more about it, it was probably Bill.
Losing Draco means saving him. And letting go is a significant part of love.
Draco had seemingly returned to their room from his own riding lesson with Andvari and was, judging by his mood, no less sweaty than Harry had been five minutes earlier.
Harry had been staring at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy for what felt like an eternity. He felt pretty stupid, his only job at the moment was to walk up and down the corridor opposite the tapestry and imagine the room he needed. Not a difficult task, if he hadn’t remained rooted to the spot since he arrived. What, by Merlin, was a suitable room?
The heavy feeling in my chest pressed uncomfortably against my lungs. I could guess what this meant. First, it meant that I would have to fight for more diary visits, which I was all too easily content with. But Draco's words also proved that sooner or later I would have to choose. Between this and saving Malfoy.
If it had been possible, I would have dedicated all my senses to Draco alone. Would have looked at him from every angle, breathed in his sweet scent, tasted every inch of his skin and made him utter every happy sound imaginable just to hear him. At that minute, however, I only managed to feel Draco's velvety insides and smooth skin, felt his body hot against mine and captured his warm breath with my mouth.
"It wasn’t a rendezvous," Harry interrupted him, but Draco just kept talking.
"I’ve just as little reason to trust you. Not to mention the fact that I don't even know what exactly you are." The statement had more bite than it was intended to have, so I hastily sealed my lips again. I needed to get a grip if I was going to get this right.
"I don't hate you," I said far too quietly and relaxed my limbs a little. The feeling Draco aroused in me was still the same as it had been for the past few weeks. My sympathy towards him had not disappeared at all. It filled me with relief.
Hermione opened her mouth as if she wanted to interject that this was not the right moment to triumph, but she held her breath for a moment to reflect on something better. “And you're absolutely sure?”
On one hand, he feels cool air and soft fabric. The other hand is enveloped in the warmth of another.
"Am I dead?" breathed Draco, allowing Harry to pull him first to his feet and then a few steps away.
. It didn’t matter that Draco had spread the word, after all, it was Harry who hit the jackpot with a ten like Draco,
Harry considered mentioning that he had already made half an acquaintance with Draco when there was a knock at the door and it flew open before anyone could invite the stranger in. A young man with long blond hair appeared. His hair was now tied at his neck much more loosely than it had been a short time ago. He looked stressed and surprised at the many visitors in the office.
The two of them were indeed late, the hall was already emptying, with a few other stragglers hurrying past them, but not without giving them a curious glance. The fact that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had left Hogwarts through the Main Gate last night, hand in hand, had, of course, spread like wildfire among the students. The fact that the two of them now entered the Great Hall together and Harry hadn’t changed his clothes only confirmed what had happened.
Draco gave a barely perceptible, distracted nod as he pushed his chair backwards a bit. Harry noticed it anyway. "I already suspected it, but I wanted to have complete certainty. I’m absolutely sure that you think you’re doing the right thing in this case, but I can assure you that it won’t end the way you’re imagining it.”
was the eighth wonder of the world.
Surprised, Harry lifts his head and looks at Draco, who smooths down his trouser legs and pays Harry no attention. He is dressed in a colourful mixture of a pair of Harry's socks, an old pair of Ron's cloth trousers and a dark blue woollen jumper that Harry found in Sirius' old room. Apart from his diary, he has no belongings in this house.
Draco whimpered, spread his legs willingly for Harry and twitched under every trace of the tongue on his skin as if they were electric shocks. Harry blew gently on the hole, heard Draco wheezily curse and licked over the sensitive skin again. He could have gone on forever, his fingers massaging the cheeks, his tongue working as if it was completely independent of Harry's mind and Draco melting away under Harry's touch.
"– or if you’re competing in horse shows," Pansy added. "Draco has to train in the afternoon."
This work was beta-read by the brilliant
"Kiss me, Harry, please kiss me," Draco breathes so softly Harry barely catches it.
kind of clothing at his age is a disgrace to this neighbourhood!”. Lupin's interest, however, didn’t seem to be of a judgmental nature, which made the man thousand times more likeable.
Draco had already noticed Harry's glances, even though he carefully avoided them and punished him with cold disregard. Harry didn't mind that, it just meant that he could continue to stare unhindered. Lost in thought, he chewed on his lower lip as he watched Draco once again tense his right hand and drop his quill to press his left hand onto his right forearm. Harry held his breath. That was the opportunity to speak to him, wasn't it? But he didn't dare move, and to make matters worse, Draco looked up and gave Harry an accusing look. Harry quickly shot him a wry smile, simply to signal his good intentions, but Draco continued to glare at him furiously. Mission
As soon as they returned to the farm, they took care of the horses and Draco slowly but surely forgot that he was supposed to be pouting. It helped, that Harry constantly threw him dreamy looks that didn't remain hidden from the blond. More than once, Harry found himself forgetting the world around him as he watched Draco engage in the most ordinary activities. Draco did everything with such
tired and we have to get up early in the mo –“ Harry tried to distract him, but Ron wasn’t one to be dismissed so easily.
Hermione anxiously runs a hand through her hair, keeping one hand on her round belly as usual. "What you're asking me to do is ... ludicrous. I didn't develop this method back then to arbitrarily convince peoples' brains to be dead – it was to fight a deadly curse."
Harry blinked against bright sunlight that fell through a gap in the curtains right onto his bed. Next to him, a warm body moved clumsily, Harry only recognized a blurry blond spot and smiled.
"Why can I talk to you? What is this place?" I insisted, gripping my wand a little tighter.
Draco flippantly disregards the interjection. "It feels just as it did when it belonged to me."
“Are you aware that I don't owe you any explanation?” Draco interrupted Harry's thoughts and returned to their original topic.
Draco's lips touch Harry's hand another time, this time his fingertips.
Ron's laughter drowned in his painful howl as Harry punched him in the side.
Ron and Hermione exchange one of their love-vow glances.
. His pure fascination with the blond was more than evident. Even for Draco, who was a little blinder to it than the rest of humanity, it had to be obvious enough.

And he succeeds.
“– A natural. I know!” Harry finished Draco’s sentence with a bold grin and got an eye roll from Draco. “You don’t have to massage my ego, your moans were confirmation enough for me,” he added. But he admitted inwardly that Draco was allowed to massage something else.

Malfoy's lips parted a little, but no sound left his throat.
Draco turned to face me again and took a step closer. "And then you'll return?"
Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on Draco and his thoughts. That was just the jump-start, soon he had to break free and stay in reality.
"This would’ve been your opportunity to convince me to take a shower with you. Such a pity, Potter," Draco whispered in Harry's ear as they crossed the threshold of the front door to the guesthouse. Now it was Harry's turn to feel the heat in his cheeks and look at Draco in surprise. The blond gave him a mischievous smile, broke away from Harry's touch and strutted with his chin up and a little more swing of his hip than usual towards the stairs leading to the first floor.
, even if he couldn't name it at that point. But it wasn’t fireworks that suddenly set off either. It was more of an

Draco's memories flew past him, flashed up, faded. It was almost too fast, but Harry knew Draco was searching. This place, it was supposed to help him find it.
Harry's jaw dropped, but he couldn't gather himself before Draco turned around and disappeared back to his friends. That didn't make any sense at all! Why would this be Draco's secret? And why would he be so casual about it if Harry found out? It didn’t explain his bizarre fear of water, nor the nightly trip to the lake. The wizard tried to tell him a cock and bull story, Harry wasn’t able to explain all of this otherwise.
Hermione laughed bitterly. "No, how could I forget. All
fault.
Eventually, he asked Mrs Longbottom to use her office phone. Besides his school laptop, which he used for e-mails, Draco vehemently refused to own any other technical equipment. Mrs Longbottom agreed, of course, and Draco followed his father's instructions well-behaved, though not in person. Narcissa didn’t blame her son. She had been justifying Draco's anger for years with the pressure that Draco's father put on him. Perhaps she was right. Draco didn't care. It didn't change anything anyway.
Harry draws a small mark on the pocket calendar that sits in front of him on the counter, next to the old cash register. He has been marking the dates since he received the first postcard with the skyline of Seoul on it, exactly one year ago. He would never have expected it then, his own life had just begun to shift when it suddenly appeared on his kitchen table in his small attic flat.
Perhaps Draco wasn't mad anymore after all. For he knew his days as a coward were long over.
Harry's thumb traced along Draco's chin, the blond didn't seem sure whether to blush or grin smugly, so it ended up being a mixture of the two. "
Malfoy scoffed quietly. "Well spotted, Potter. Now then, have the courtesy to explain to me why you're bothering with non-existent beings when surely the real world needs all your salvation and therefore time."

are you asking me for a
"Does – Does that turn you on? To hear that I'm falling in lov–" Harry didn't get any further, Draco pressed his fingers on Harry's mouth, breathing heavily, and cut off his voice and air.
Harry was pretty sure that Draco and him were the only wizards who chose each other's masturbation activities as a cover-up story, but it seemed to work out fine. At least now he knew that Draco was reasonably well and he didn't want to talk to Harry about it. Basically, he knew as much as he did before, but he was good at pretending it was different.
way of dealing with this.
"You could’ve told me that a little earlier," Draco remarked, a smile touched the corners of his mouth.
If anything, you have a saviour complex,” Draco interrupted Harry’s thoughts and smiled a little. He still seemed to be lost in thought, but also as if he could slowly understand many things better.
"You'll come back, won't you?" he asked me in a shaky voice. "It would break my heart if I didn't get another glimpse of that crooked, stupid grin of yours. Or the way your eyes darken as soon as determination wins inside you. Or if I'm not allowed to feel the scratch of your stubble against my skin one more time. Or if I'm denied the opportunity to kiss the person who can possibly think I'm not interested enough to want to do it again and again."
He needed his guitar now and that more than urgently.
Oh and I strongly recommend to have the song "notice me" by ROLE MODEL ready (to get The Full Experience™), it'll play a role at the end of the chapter and also THE SONG IS SO GOOD, do yourself a favour and listen to it!
Was that all he got? Just a final
An impatient knock on the bathroom door made Harry open his eyes again. "Potter, there are other people in this room who need a cooldown, so if you would be so kind as to hurry up!"
Hermione shows up mid-morning. She converses with Draco for hours upon hours, discussing possible spells that could separate his magic from the old scars and seal them permanently. When it comes to the subject of books, neither Hermione nor Draco keeps quiet, so after half an hour of silent listening, Harry decides to take Pup to Nellie. After breaking the curse, he has no intention of staying in this house any longer. He may have gotten used to it, but despite that, nightmares haunt him more often than usual.
An uneasy feeling sits in his stomach, the sole reason for his hesitation. After all, he is here for Jimar, to work out a battle plan with his fiancée and does not want to waste any time. His gaze falls on the worn doorbell sign that reads Palmer & Waters. Something is not right here, but Harry can find no rational reason for this hunch.
Together with Healer Isaksen, he leaves the room, pushing Malfoy's wheelchair ahead of him and straining not to think about how the others are doing. Whether everything is going according to plan. Or if any of them are in trouble.
Harry's mouth curled into an honest smile and he reached out a hand to Draco's waist. Draco let himself be persuaded very reluctantly and moved only a small step closer. Harry's smile broadened. "You're very talented."
"What if you broke your leg when you fell?" Harry asked, trying to figure out exactly where Seamus was dragging Ginny.
"After my brother died, forcing me to take over the Owl Emporium, I decided to spite my family and immortalise my gratitude to Dumbledore by adding a phoenix to our emblem," Nellie says as she intently levitates the pumpkins into a neat order.
Afterwards, they organise all the equipment they need to execute the plan and prepare it carefully. Hermione practices the spells with Draco one more time. It is not until dinner that Ron and Hermione leave – Ron's belated birthday party is waiting for them at the Burrow.
, Harry remembered and suppressed a sigh.
, it was worth it!
Ron sets Draco's diary down on the nightstand while Hermione, visibly overwhelmed, pulls the covers over Draco's body. Searching for guidance, she glances at Ron, who takes her hand. He offers Harry, who has settled down at the edge of Draco's bed, an encouraging smile, and then leaves the room with Hermione.
"I like him," Harry blurts out.
Draco's face lit up in relief. "Yes. Yes! We should go."
Malfoy glared at me, he was so close I could see specks of lemon yellow in the grey of his eyes, but he did not move an inch. "Get your filthy fingers off me. I'm not going to answer your ridiculous questions, Potter."
My fist struck the jaw of the person in front of me before I could gather a clear thought.
Draco grimaced while he tilted his head thoughtfully. "Does he have another birthday present in case he chickens out like he did the last five times? Hurray to Hermione's patience, I'd have dumped him for all his cowardice long ago!"
Before the scene could start all over again for the third time, Malfoy closed the wooden door that should have led us into a broom cupboard and not into Malfoy's old childhood room. Here we were again, shrouded in silence and dim light, standing in one of Hogwarts' seemingly endless hallways that led us only to where we were supposed to be headed.
." Draco's voice trembled, but it was more than enough to finish Harry off. One last time Harry thrust his hips into Draco’s fist. He felt Draco's fingers move along his shaft with practised precision and when he finally pressed his lips against Draco's, his knees weakened and stars danced before his eyes. Harry's orgasm overwhelmed him with unplanned force, only the fact that he clung to the wall with one hand saved him from falling.
Mr Hagrid, who insisted on being called simply Hagrid, was a large man with a big beard and that twinkle in his eye which immediately told them that he must be a faithful soul. He showed Harry and Ron exactly what food their ponies were being fed and explained to them what the consequences of overfeeding concentrate or hay would be. Harry was clearly too tired to listen closely, but he was still grateful for Hagrid's presence. At least he didn't have to confess to Ron that he was possibly in the process of developing a fetish for blond hair.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Draco's blush rising on his cheeks, his heart pounded at the sight. Harry hurriedly looked around for Hedwig, if he wasn't careful, he would do something crazy and kiss the blond in the middle of the courtyard. That might have been a bit early, even though Harry had to admit that he wasn’t opposed to the idea. No, he rather welcomed it.
(See the end of the chapter for
This was his chance of gaining the being's trust and then asking it about Draco, however he fit into this picture. So Harry smiled a little more confidently now and reached out for the creature's hand to grab it. Only gently and briefly, but amicably, to not leave a false impression. Just as Harry loosened his grip on the squidgy hand again, the creature's broad mouth widened into a grin so vicious that Harry's smile was instantly wiped from his face.
bare skin… not a good combination for Harry’s confusing feelings. The fact that he apparently liked it was obvious, the sweatpants didn’t save Harry at all.

." And with that, he turned abruptly and headed for the stables. He led the horse with him.
"Have you noticed that your room is much bigger than mine," Ron asked, dropping his travel bag onto one of the two beds, which stood against opposite walls.
"There's no way I'll be congratulating Granger and Weasley!" Draco seemed certain and not like he was open for discussion.
Ron snorted bitterly. “Yeah, we got that. He is your
So why would Harry flout his loyalty? Remember when the two of them met for the first time? The upheaval of the future? Let me tell you that Harry won’t lose his sense of loyalty, not in the future. There's only one time he'll break it, and that's right now. Because without a break, nothing can heal.
bloody fools won!"
quickly. This surely had something to do with the fact that he hadn't been attacked from behind and he could actually see what Harry was doing.
Was it really wandless magic? Then Draco may have cast an Imperius on him, but it hadn't felt like an unforgivable curse. It had been different. Harry's mind had been completely clear, his body alone had responded to Draco's will. If Harry had tried harder, he could certainly have resisted, but the pain that had spread in his veins had been too much to resist seriously. Thinking about it, Draco was bloody frightening.
good, huh? I'll take that as a 'thank you'." He sat up on Harry's thighs and used the blanket to wipe the remains of Harry's orgasm off his and Harry's stomach. Harry closed his eyes with relish, floating on the fading feeling of his orgasm. "Don't fall asleep, Harry. The 'sleep with me'-part hasn't yet been fulfilled.”
Succumbed was an understatement. He had fallen for him. Completely.
Harry was just about to look around when the door behind him opened and Draco entered the bathroom. In his arms, he carried a small pile of folded clothes, the top two of which he pressed against Harry’s chest. “I’m going to assume you didn’t bring any spare clothes.”
to Harry that he wouldn't even dare say. He also wore tight dark jeans and a loose white top, which was cut just right to show off his collarbone and drive Harry half crazy. Had Draco not been besieged by Pansy, he probably would have dragged him into a dark corner. It also helped that Seamus handed out the first round of drinks.
to understand what Draco's lack of sexual experience had to do with all this, but the realisation just wouldn't hit him.
Ron gives Hermione a look, but then resolutely faces Harry again. "I'm saying that even if this situation with you and Malfoy had any realistic chance at all, you're still at completely different points in your lives."
The further time went by, the more the “useless” stack piled up and the narrower the stack of still untouched books became. Slowly but surely Harry lost hope. Blood curses were clearly not designed to be broken, which only further complicated things.
" but he was happier than ever before in his life. He had everything he had never even dared to dream of: A small cosy house, a husband who loved him more than anything, friends who would die for him but didn't really have to because the world was different now, and peace that had finally come into his life.
Harry finishes his narration and looks expectantly at his counterparts. Ron scratches his nose thoughtfully and Hermione raises her wine glass to her lips to take a sip, absorbed in thought. Harry can barely stand the silence.
from me? Haven't you done enough already? Is my misery not quite enough for you?"
“That’s… difficult. Right now? Yeah, I don’t give it much thought. In general? It should probably interest me more and I’m even sure that we will start to work on some things at some point. But not today and not tomorrow.” Harry’s answer was carefully crafted and satisfied the curiosity of his friends.
“What just happened?” he asked because he couldn’t think of anything better to say. He didn’t let go of Draco.
She rises, lets herself be thanked and leaves the office.
Draco frowns and regards Harry a little puzzled. Whether it is the sudden closeness of the two of them or Harry's statement, Harry cannot tell. Since Draco makes no attempt to retreat, Harry could care less and gingerly reaches for the hand Draco has buried in Pup's fur. Bringing their intertwined fingers between them, he looks at Draco intently.
the net covering Draco's skin, it tempted Harry immensely. He let his hand touch it, felt the coarse-meshed fabric, silky short hair, Draco's hardness... Draco moaned, pushed his hips towards Harry's hand and body and Harry obeyed the silent plea.
Draco’s eyes were still closed, but his breaths revealed that he was awake, so Harry began to run his fingers gently through the blond’s soft hair. Draco’s satisfied grumble was drowned out by him pressing his nose into Harry’s collarbone. A peppery fresh scent tickled Harry’s nose and reminded him strongly of the freesias his Aunt Petunia had grown in her garden. He liked the smell, but he liked everything about Draco.
"I'm really sorry, Harry. We all didn't mean for it to come to this."
Full of impatience, Harry's erection rubs rhythmically against Draco's thigh, almost aching with forced restraint. Draco's nerves also seem strained to a breaking point – soft, desperate sounds escape his throat and soon he is clinging to Harry's nape with both hands, silently pleading for more closeness, more heat, more Harry, just
"You're blocking the way if you don't want to go up there," the Muggle grumpily informed him.
"They're still discharging patients here at this late hour?" Filly asks as he comes to a halt beside Harry, breathing heavily.
There had also been some pleasant events at St Mungo's Hospital in the past few weeks. Events that concerned Malfoy and others that did not. I had learnt from Jimar that an "attractive but scary-looking young woman with black hair" had requested visiting hours with Malfoy. Nobody had done that before, which was why Jimar had been particularly excited to report it. Still, visiting a prisoner in Azkaban was already a lengthy process; visiting prisoners housed in St Mungo's was almost an impossibility. Parkinson, however, had yet to give up.
Harry smiled at Draco’s attempt not to say anything condescending about Ron. Meanwhile, he turned to Draco and strolled towards him as casually as possible. "How's your thigh?" He stopped in front of Draco, who stood a little helplessly in the middle of the room with one riding boot in his hand and the other on his foot.
Even though Harry didn't quite understand what Draco meant by that, he suddenly felt everything inside him insisting on opening the door. Harry gasped, alarmed when he really let go of the doorknob he had just gripped. “What – ?”
"Do I know already?" he asked after what felt like half an eternity in a low, raspy voice.
But Harry didn’t think of Transfiguration and ignored his own admonishing inner voice. Prof. McGonagall was about to demonstrate a transfiguration spell and explain the theory behind it, but Harry just stared at the tabletop in front of him as if paralysed. He could feel the curious glances of his classmates. Now that they had a lesson with the Slytherins, the rumours would only spread faster. Well, actually, it wasn’t a rumour. It was the bloody truth, but it wasn’t the
Besides, he was ambitious and neither his father nor his mother had taught him that. The feeling of winning gave him a frenzy that Zabini felt was unhealthy. Draco blamed it on his past, which admittedly meant that his parents had contributed to his ambition, but it seemed the most plausible explanation. First, he had learned that he always had to consider himself better than those around him, then reality had hit him and shaken him awake. And since then, Draco had been searching for something,
Filly's lips twist into a satisfied grin. "We need names. Names that none of them dares speak, but that every one of them knows."
The glistening of Draco’s skin began to weaken and Harry thrust again. Again and again and again until he found his rhythm and lost himself in it. He let himself fall, continued their kisses, sucking on bare skin. He couldn’t keep his fingers steady and floated in a world he had never seen before, full of ecstasy and lust that was brewing up and then suddenly emptied itself over him.
“Ron!” Hermione reproached her boyfriend and then smiled at Harry gently. “What Ron’s trying to say is that we’re very proud of you for taking this risk! We’re absolutely sure that you will... master the rest just as well!”

Malfoy's glare is cold and set firmly on Harry. He squeezes his lips shut.
just mounted the horse without help, whilst looking far too elegant for it to be considered untrained.
"She had a seizure out of nowhere. Sirius took her straight to the vet. They're examining her now. He'll be in touch as soon as he knows more."
That much should already be clear to those present. Harry may have deliberately chosen to portray the conflict as more of a discussion, but he senses that Isaksen sees through his story.
"I guess I should be grateful to her for confronting me with my personality. It made me question everything. Question myself. But first I had to get away."
Breathing heavily, I came to a halt on the shore of the Great Lake, closed my eyes, sank to my knees and buried my hands in cool, damp sand. How did one bear the consequences for something that could not be undone, let alone made right? How did one return to a normality that had shattered like a mirror into its individual parts, once one had caught a glimpse of the reflection, the true self?
And although Harry would have loved to ask if Draco didn't think he was overreacting at least a little, he knew that Draco, to himself, wasn’t overreacting. And if he was so ashamed of something that had happened in his past, Harry would be the last person who didn't take him seriously. It was Draco's feelings, and he would consider them, of course.
him, but he made him weak anyway.
Harry tilts his head, pretending thoughtfulness. "I reckon if you were an animal you'd rather be –"
Draco laughed and turned his head to look back at the fireplace.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Look, I just want to know what's going –”
"But by then it was far too late. All I felt was fear of tomorrow. And it wasn't just about me anymore. I knew that if I made even the tiniest wrong decision, my family would have to pay for it." Malfoy traced the lifeline of his left hand with his fingertip. "You may consider me a coward, but I didn't feel I had a choice at the time. Even if I had betrayed my family and friends to switch sides, I would have been left with nothing. The fear wouldn't have lessened, not to mention the fact that I couldn't be sure of finding refuge in the first place. I could only lose."
Now it was Harry's turn to open his eyes in surprise, a slight blush covering his cheeks as he tried to withstand Draco's questioning gaze. What an arsehole. Now it sounded like Harry was trying to hit on him and
, he begged inwardly. Why hadn't he just listened to Ron and had waited? Why had he brought the subject up at all? Now they were forced to talk about it
“Goyle's a joke. It's like wanting to have sex with a pet or a house-elf!” Harry made it short with the last candidate. This time the list had been processed much faster, all for nothing. None of the three even remotely suited Draco.
"That was two questions," I pointed out in a controlled manner, though I could feel my blood boiling just hearing the voice he was using. It was so easy to fall into old patterns. Too easy.
The following day Nellie pays Draco another visit and assures Harry that for now, everything is fine. It is not a state that will last in the long term, but it is a ray of light in the darkness. It offers Harry hope that he can still make a difference.
"We're not at Hogwarts anymore," Hermione says softly. "We've moved on and grown up."
“You don’t seem to have experienced yourself as angry yet,” Draco replied, approaching Harry again and stopping in front of him smiling smugly. “But apart from that, who said I thought you were a sadist, not a masochist?”
that Harry had done it at all? And could his friends stop pretending this wasn’t a big deal?
Ignoring the whispering, murmuring, and giggling, Harry turned briefly to Draco before their paths would part. There was a mischievous smile on Draco’s lips, which surprised Harry a little. But he didn’t complain, as long as Draco didn’t mind the looks and comments of the others, neither would Harry.
"It doesn't matter," Draco interrupted me gently, guiding my sandy fingertips to his lips and kissing them softly, never taking his eyes off me. "I'm not afraid."
Gasping, Harry arches his back and allows Draco to kiss him heatedly on the nape and neck, causing his blood to boil anew. Somewhere between the aftershocks of his orgasm and the rekindling lust, Harry manages to reach for his wand and whisper the spell for Draco, which also marks his consent.
Instead, I looked back at Malfoy's father, who was just handing a light grey file with a golden elderflower engraved on it to the other wizard, speaking to him in a lowered voice. They shook hands and I was peripherally aware of Mrs Malfoy appearing in my field of vision, entering the room through the very door I was kneeling in and picking up her son in her arms.
"Good," Draco mumbled to Harry's lips, then he pushed Harry away impatiently, turned on his stomach and crawled to the edge of the bed to look for something in the bedside drawer. Meanwhile, Harry's gaze lay fascinated on Draco's arse, which could only look more delicious when covered by the net. Harry let his hand roam over the soft skin, almost heard Draco's smile. Then the blond turned around, placed himself backwards under Harry again, his hair tickled on Harry's arms and he held a condom out to him.
"All right, all right," Draco laughed and pressed his palm more firmly against Harry's mouth. "I must admit I wouldn't be averse to a repetition."
"Ah." Realisation flitted across his face and he nodded slightly before facing the flames again. "I can't show you that memory."
, but a good-humoured, breakfasting Draco, who wore forbidden tight jodhpurs and on good days crossed his legs under the table, outdid any caffeine rush by far.
Draco lifted his head in surprise to meet Harry’s gaze. Harry was sure that one could read the embarrassment on his face but didn't back down. Draco raised an eyebrow, then a little smile spread on his lips and he placed one hand on Harry's cheek. "How do you want me,
"Draco, I haven't been completely honest with you," I finally voiced what was weighing heavily on my chest. "You –"
Harry shrugged. “I don’t understand it either. That never happened to me before when I was with him. It makes no sense at all, but the mere possibility that I could be his saviour… I don’t know what I… Guys, I’m screwed…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Nellie nods, glances at Harry with absent, dark eyes and lowers her wand. "Yes, that was the name of the bastard who led that pack. That night, no Healer took a break. We saved who we could save." Her expression goes blank. "I lost two of the children I was responsible for."
didn’t want to know anything about the sex life of his best friends, but he thanked them inwardly for the insight. Ron pouted while Hermione grinned at Harry with amusement. For this moment Harry felt amazingly free of burden; he really had missed laughing so easily with his friends.
awfully, jealous. When you're used to getting everything you want, then... then you don't realise that some things are just out of reach. I thought Granger had everything then. She was a talented rider, her parents would never have pushed her to compete and still supported her unconditionally, and then she even got the hot guy. You can imagine what happened next.”
Malfoy cast me a sceptical look. "Is that what you would like me to wonder so you can tell me the answer?" I rolled my eyes and Malfoy fought a smug grin off his lips. "Perhaps, Potter. Perhaps I do wonder."
"Not accepting help?" Harry asks cautiously, careful not to drown the sounds of the music.
Harry wasn't sure what to make of this. The idea, that had nothing even remotely to do with a
Knowing Draco was watching each of Harry's steps over his shoulder, Harry let one hand slowly slide over the soft muscle and rolled the condom over his own erection. He had all the time in the world and he would take Draco apart here and now, make him whimper, Harry bit his lip so as not to moan. Then he sank to his knees behind Draco and wished, once again, to be able to enjoy the sight clearly. But his imagination helped and maybe it wasn't bad that Harry didn't get to see the full picture. He might have given up instantly and surrendered to his own desires.
"How can it save you?" I asked slowly.
He continued to refuse to cooperate. It did not surprise me in the slightest, one could not expect anything from Malfoy and yet everything about his presence and his tone provoked me. "You cannot shirk this responsibility, Malfoy. You have answers to questions that could save people's lives."
"But I'm not," he replies to Harry's unspoken answer. "I can't ... live only for others. You of all people should understand that."
The "loving banter" began harmlessly with:
! Coupled with the feeling, Harry just named. Curiosity. Curiosity stronger than the warnings the universe supposedly tried to give him. They're not warnings, they're

that Draco wanted to be there for him. That he was there for him. That he didn't have to hide from him.
, because the blush of anger rose on his face while the right side of his upper lip twitched ominously. “I’m trying to save your bloody life and you dare to call me uncooperative? Charming, Potter!”
It was already the evening of the same day and all twelve participants of the horse-riding holidays relaxed in the lounge of the guesthouse. At noon they had had another riding lesson with Ms Vector and learned more gaits. Although riding was actually fun and Harry felt that he was making great progress, the sore muscles from the day before had overshadowed everything a bit negatively. After their riding lesson, they had watched the others for a while. Hermione was without question one of the best. She had Snerpa, her assigned pony, under control like no one else. Draco had been gone half the afternoon, but he had watched Harry's riding lesson (and mocked him about his sore muscles with Ginny). All in all, a relaxed day, if one ignored the incident in the morning.

she did. With Harry's luck, there could be no other option, so he wasn’t even surprised.
"Are you apologising for the punch?" Draco narrowed his eyes. "Or for the kiss?"
"Then be closer to me. Invade my heart."
supercilious Draco who was friends with Hermione. It really didn't make sense, although Blaise seemed like a sensible young man and had been friends with Draco for years. Perhaps the softcore had already shone through then.
Harry concentrated, saw the night, saw the Astronomy Tower, saw the pain, saw Draco, saw the old dying man, then released the memory for Draco and opened his eyes. His part was done, now it was on Draco to remember.
"Dramatic? If there's one thing I'm not, it's

solution. Just what Draco had wanted. There was nothing more perfect for him. He would get his freedom, that was what he wanted!
Draco, who by now was looking at Harry again, seemed to know exactly what was going on inside him, for he shook his head in bewilderment. “Please tell me you care. I know you’re not the type to think everything through, but even you should realise that the idea is dreadful.”
"I met Krum about three years ago. We were in the same team and we ran into each other a few times at shows. He was quite impressive, his riding was exceptionally great for his age. We got... into conversation, you might call it sort of a friendship if you're not too strict with the definition. First and foremost, we just tried to beat the other one, that's all there was to it. Until he spent the summer two years ago on the farmstead."
Harry's mind shut down, his heart erupted in pure euphoria. "Does that mean... Do you want to be with me, Draco? Like, officially dating and beyond the summer?"
He does not want to understand his best friend, so he does not.
I drew our intertwined fingers to my mouth, gave him a smile that carried a promise I could not make and kissed the back of his hand gently. "Of course."
No, Draco didn't know. He couldn't have known. He had forgotten.
Parkinson pulled her legs even closer and pressed her lips together, presumably to stifle another sob.
In this brief instant, there is nothing more important to Harry than that Draco knows that he wants to keep fighting for him. That Harry is dying to see him again. That Harry is the one who misses him. That Harry would not abandon him. Not any more. Those days are long gone.
"You ... must be wondering why I'm here," Harry tries as he awkwardly straightens up and folds his hands on the tabletop in front of him.
It was late afternoon by now, Draco and Harry had returned from the woods a while earlier, mingled with the group again and enjoyed the cooling in the lake. Eventually, fatigue and a second hunger had taken hold of them and they had all settled down on the picnic blankets on the shore. Draco had demonstratively sat down between Harry's legs, leaning with his back against Harry's chest and hadn't moved away since. Harry would have never complained, even if Draco's body was a tiny bit too warm to be considered thoroughly comfortable.
he had toned thighs (and a toned bottom, although Harry could only assume), riding was a
, a little blond Slytherin was nothing against it. And yet Harry’s heart was beating with a force that made him fear that everyone around him was aware of it.
Harry no longer understands a word. "But ... why?"
“Stop that now, Potter!” Draco growled as Harry’s hand reached Draco’s waistband and asked to be let in. With a sigh, Harry took his hand away and ran it through Draco’s hair instead. He knew that this was nothing personal, yet it was a shame that he wouldn’t see Draco in pure ecstasy.

way, but Harry wasn’t brilliant either. The chaos began when he tethered the pony because Harry didn't want to get the right knot, then he didn't comb properly, but against the direction of coat growth, then he placed the saddle the wrong way around on the horse's back, although Draco had shown him how to do it properly. All in all, it went quite catastrophically.
"It would be
"It all sounds sadder than it is. Sirius is my godfather and he helped out at the boarding school now and then. He used to be a student there, like my parents, that’s how they knew each other. When I was fourteen, he took me to London and I haven't seen my aunt since," Potter continued.
was seemingly no longer enough for Harry to take his feelings for certain other parties seriously.
Ron smiles placatingly. "I'm aware of that, too. But wasn't it you who said that you think Malfoy and Harry share ownership of the Elder Wand because no disarming spell was used at all?"
I had known that Malfoy was a person who clung to his survival. He fought for it, despite disdaining fighting, and chose paths that guaranteed his survival, no matter how questionable they were. I suspected that this was a trait that had led him to commit some of his worst decisions. But also his best, as I had discovered through Malfoy's memory museum.
"I was unable to figure out if fate is tied to morality," Malfoy replied, lost in thought. "Do people only fulfil their fate when they do good? Or is it possible for someone's fate to be committing atrocities? Does fate adhere to a moral code at all, or is it exempt from judgement?"
"Potter, would you be so kind as to tell me what the fuck is going on?" Draco growled. Harry dragged him along the hallway by his wrist. Right. He had somehow forgotten to tell Draco about the joyous news.
Jimar does not mind, he seems glad to have his own office and flicks his wand towards one of the long walls. A glass wall appears before their eyes, revealing a spacious hospital room.
With burning heat in his blood, he turned Draco completely on his back and leaned over him to reunite their lips. Draco was a surprisingly good kisser. At the very beginning, in quiet nights which they had spent together in front of the big fireplace in the common room of the so-called eighth years to escape the cruelty of their dreams, Draco had told him that he hadn't kissed anyone since he was fourteen years old. He had most certainly not expected to find his arms wrapped around Harry and his mouth to be claimed by his own not even twenty minutes later. But that was how it had happened, and neither of them had pulled back to take a break since.

Rationally, Harry wasn’t disappointed in Draco. How could he? He didn't know Draco's reasons for his actions. He didn't know
Draco leaned over Harry's upper body, but kept his erection in place with two fingers, greedily kissing him on his wet lips.

Ron's visits become less frequent, though not completely cancelled due to their weekly dinner. The fact that this is the result of the renewed visits to St Mungo's Hospital is not a secret to Ron either. He takes it with humour, rejoices in the fact that Harry's mood is gaining stability and only jokingly acts as the stood-up lover. On Harry's remark that he has a pregnant wife sitting next to him, Ron boldly suggests that he has every reason to be jealous regardless, as even a blind observer would notice that Harry's dates with Malfoy are becoming rampant.
The next thing Harry felt was something heavy, which hit him against the chest and pressed him backwards onto the forest ground. Harry gasped for air in surprise, but his breath was taken away by lips pressing against his own. Harry smelled vanilla, felt the warmth of a body on him and only heard the rush of his blood in his ears.
was planned for years!”
With his body as heavy as lead, Harry steps closer to the window wall, stops and presses his fingertips against the cool glass. His thoughts focus only on the regular breaths he forces himself to take.
It would probably have been wiser to leave Draco Malfoy alone after his countless warnings, but Harry thought he knew better. Although he became a tiny bit more subtle in his observations and didn't try to talk to Draco about this anymore for the time being, he definitely didn't stay away. He told Ron and Hermione nothing of the little incident that had happened between him and Draco. That Draco was somehow capable of becoming master of his deeds was frightening enough. So Harry took the rest of the day to think about everything. Draco was not just a simple sea creature, no, he apparently had magical abilities beyond the ordinary.
The honking of a car sounded and tore Harry out of his wandering thoughts. The old, blue car, a Ford Anglia to be precise, was speeding past Harry with a few unhealthy exhaust pipe noises. Through one of the rolled down windows, a red shock of hair appeared, paired with a broad grin and a freckled nose.
"Ron, would you –" Hermione protests, but Ron flings his hand in the air and motions her to walk out the door.

"Evening. Sleep well?" Draco asked, a smile emerging on his forbidden sweet lips. Harry grumbled something incomprehensible and pulled a bit of the blanket over his exposed centre. Draco chuckled again. "Nothing that I haven't seen before. No false modesty."

Draco huffed. Then he closed his eyes for a moment, took a deep breath and began massaging his temples. "You have no idea how angry I am with you."
"Gross, mate. No offence... but
Harry came to a halt in front of where Draco was seated and continued to struggle not to blush. In the Great Hall, one could probably have heard a pin drop by now, it had become so quiet. Even the teachers at the teacher’s table looked interestedly in Harry’s direction, perhaps they were worried that there would be injuries.
The corners of Malfoy's mouth twitched tellingly, but he restrained himself from any further emotion. "So you were wrong about me to some extent?"
like. Lilac, for example. Potter should consider himself lucky that Draco hadn’t complained about this horrible colour while they were… lying on the lilac sofa.
Healer Isaksen would certainly have laughed at this point, at least Harry believes so. However, he does not laugh and meets Filly's gaze unflinchingly. The only aspect of the answer which surprises him is that he got it. "Then why bother? He's not only a Death Eater, but he's also a convicted prisoner."
That's another part of my curse. That last part, mind you. The simulation spell would work if the waterspirits hadn’t cursed the blood until death. Curse breakers can simulate five years, theoretically even hundreds of years, but not the eternity of a lifetime,” explained Draco as he closed the book. He looked at Harry almost apologetically. Disappointment was clearly written on the latter’s face.

Theo was a very immediate problem which was blocking his way. His bleeding heart was another problem, but nothing compared to Draco. Draco, who was somewhere thinking about how Harry had only used him. And that was as far from the truth as nothing else.
Fundamentally, he knows why he is here. He just needs confirmation.
"Then you need to put an end to the Malfoy situation," Ron says in a calm voice. When Harry throws him a hurt look, he too sets down his cutlery. "No, let me explain: Malfoy was the reason you weren't well in autumn, we're all aware of that. And it will happen again. He's the basic definition of something that doesn't suit your way of life. He brings turmoil and risk – something you say you don't want."
with Draco, but it didn’t change his attitude. He wanted to continue to help Draco by all means possible. Harry couldn’t suppress a soft sigh, but Draco didn’t say anything.
"Your relationship with your past is incredibly complex," Hermione continues unabated. "It's taken you years to find something that makes you feel safe, but you know yourself how unstable that structure is. As soon as something challenges your view of the world or tries to intrude into your protected everyday life, that sense of security also disappears. You never told us exactly what happened at the end of August and why you suddenly went into a depressive phase again –"
Not half an hour passes before the topic inevitably turns serious again. Hermione lists reasons why ordinary disarming should prove effective enough, even with the Elder Wand, and that there is no need to put Harry at any risk.
Harry could feel the memory being wrested from him, he immediately slipped into another, a harmless one.
"Potter, what –"
In the grey of his eyes lay something restless, yet he didn't seem surprised to see Harry. As if he was expecting him. Nervously, Harry wiped the palms of his hands on his jeans and took a step closer, a branch cracked under his shoe, Harry almost flinched at the sound. Draco continued to look at Harry unmoved.
watching Shrek, Finnigan,
“So, it could be that, theoretically, quite possibly, in a purely hypothetical way, I kissed Draco Malfoy last night.” Harry ducked mentally before he could see Ron’s reaction, but when nothing happened, he peeked a little out from under his blanket. Ron was still sitting at the edge of his bed, nodding mechanically while apparently processing what he just heard.
"Of course."
"You're brilliant. Utterly brilliant. And I have to go. I –" He doesn't know where to put all his words and the big bubble in his chest containing nothing but hope.
for helping me with this project! You're truly the best!
“Yes,” Harry answered honestly, watching closely as Draco’s smile failed to reach his eyes, and struggled not to sigh. “But you have to understand me too. I can’t just let you go; it goes against everything my nature stands for. If I let you go, I’d lose myself.”
Harry returns the smile tentatively. "So you want me to ask Malfoy for names?"
“Spit it out! What happened at the lake?” Harry asked gruffly and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
Well, he gives him a scowl, but Harry is not particular. "I don't think that's funny."
Hermione's eyes find Ron's and Harry allows it without interfering. The two share a bond that Harry understands even less than love itself, and he trusts that Ron has enough faith in Hermione for the both of them.
Something was shimmering in the corners of Draco's eyes. Tears. No.
, Harry thought and pushed the door open. Inside, Draco, Hermione, Viktor and two people Harry didn't know were sitting on the leather sofas and chatting cheerfully. Harry's appearance didn’t go unnoticed and all heads turned to him.
"It still was my fault. I should never have interfered. We both made mistakes because
"Mmm?"
First impressions are strange. They are strange, even if no one is threatened with murder. But they're definitely stranger when someone
Draco's smile broadened, he placed another kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth, something predatory twinkled in his eyes. Then Draco kissed his way down Harry's neck, over his chest, his stomach, down the trail of dark fine hair from his navel to Harry's erection. Harry let his head drop into the pillow and he held on to the bedpost above him to stop himself from grabbing Draco and pressing him against the mattress.
When Harry wakes up the next morning, he is alone.
"They
He must believe that his plan will succeed. Draco explained in great detail how to access the magic reserves and transfer them to Draco's body. The fact that he will destroy the diary in the process is an inescapable side-effect. But he avoids thinking about that now.
Defenceless, Harry allowed his hand to squeeze his cock. His hips moved as if automatically into the loose fist, everything in Harry thanked him for the release. "Ex - Exactly. Harry," he panted, leaning against the tiled wall. Draco's eyes flew open and his gaze fell on Harry's hand wrapped around his erection.
The pain subsided as quickly as it had come, but still, the aftermath made Harry tremble all over his body and brought sweat to his brow. Holy shit, that had been worse than expected. Even though the pain continued to subside, Harry found it hard to see or hear properly. He hurriedly reached for his limbs as if he had to make sure that he really wasn’t injured. He heard a voice speaking to him.
"Your
teasing me," he stated when he noticed Draco's amused expression on his face.
The Malfoy estate wasn’t far from Weeping Willow Farmstead, a quarter of an hour's scooter ride that Harry enjoyed with every second. The estate was gigantic, perverse if Harry was honest. Most of it was the garden, more likely a park, which stretched out in front of a majestic neo-Romanesque manor. Harry had suspected that Draco's family had money, but he had never guessed that they had
"Never would I willingly expose you to risk – not for me. Yet I believe my fear of trust is holding me back, shackling me to a single choice."
"I'll show you
He stops right by Parkinson and the wizard speaking to her and adopts an air of insincere delight. "What a coincidence! You of all people here?"
Draco's voice trembled, Harry was still caressing his thigh with his lips, but his fingers lingered on his arse and had just grasped it firmly. "– I thought that I would at least bring the designers to you!"
Harry shakes his head and draws his wand. He stares at the blank pages, feeling uncomfortably reminded of days long past, and exhales deeply through his nose. He thought thoroughly about why he had agreed to this in the first place. Not for Malfoy, that much is certain. But there must be some reason. He places the tip of his wand on the piece of paper and watches as his name appears beneath it in curved letters.
"This
In response to the Ministry's owl, he has taken to visiting the office of the Head of Auror Headquarters, since he could not wait to hear if Draco's theory carries any weight. As he has just learnt, it more than does. Draco was entirely right. About every aspect. The only question left to puzzle over is why the Aurors could not draw those conclusions themselves.
"I like you," he tries again.
doesn't quite fit. You are all of age! However, if that should be a problem for you, we can arrange another teammate for you." Mrs Longbottom looked expectantly at Ron, who once again looked panicked at Harry.
With few words, Harry apologises – his lunch break is about to end, and besides, he has no further words left for the man in front of him. Robards takes his leave with the promise to take care of any criminal on the loose and to keep Harry informed.
Harry almost didn't let go, he was too relieved. Draco's upper body fitted to his own like a puzzle piece, he could
“Yes, you do.”
Harry presses his lips together. Getting Draco's cooperation now would have been far too easy. The world has no intention of sparing them the obstacles. But Harry has no intention of jamming on the brakes in the finishing lap.
“Okay, stop!”
funny. Hermione told me this morning about the muggle-fairy-tale
"What?" I asked, confused.
Harry kept staring at Draco. Was he right? Possibly. But he was surprisingly indifferent to that. He had taken a lot of risks in his life, one more or less didn’t make a difference at all. He should have died many times before and once he even had – somehow at least – so he was a little more relaxed when it came to his possible death.
Malfoy's expression remained unreadable, but he shifted his body weight from one foot to the other. "I have no reason to believe you. The last time I heard about you, you were an aspiring Auror."
"Your visits have been suspended, Mr Potter," she says in exactly the tone one would imagine a receptionist would use to deliver bad news. "You aren't allowed in."
Words fail to help Harry rouse him from his shaken state, so he barely registers as he rises, apologises and leaves the room with hurried steps. He rushes down the corridors, towards the Apparition Hall, only wanting to get home and gather his thoughts. Before he draws his wand to finally Apparate, he pinches his thumb, just to check that he is not just living through a very realistic nightmare.
, Potter."
Draco, but nice enough. First Harry let himself be persuaded to play basketball with Seamus, Dean and Ginny, later he played a round of chess against Ron, which he, of course, lost miserably. Then he watched Hermione, who tried to beat Ron (she didn't lose miserably, but she didn't win either) and then Harry sat with Luna and Neville in the meadow at the back entrance of the guesthouse and played their favourite songs on the guitar.
Harry stopped his nervous movements and felt a little lost standing in the middle of the room with his best friends’ questioning looks on him. He cleared his throat and fought the heat on his cheeks. “Yeah, I thought about it. Maybe not enough, but right now I really have other concerns. First, let me convince Draco to let me save him, then I’ll be happy to analyse this emotional thing in detail with you.” Harry meant what he said and his friends seemed to notice that too.
Well, in all fairness Harry could have figured that out himself, but he hadn’t. Which was why he was almost scared to death as soon as the light flared up a meter away from him and revealed the blond, who promptly folded his arms in front of his chest and pierced him with a hateful look.
"Yes. And then we have to find someone to beat Ron at chess," Harry added, stepping up to Draco, smiling softly and then opened the door for them.
need is
Most of the time, it was pleasant not to care too much, it was like taking your own emotions, putting them in a jam jar, screwing the lid on and putting it aside. It didn’t make him cold, just eased. He carried his feelings and emotions safely tucked away in his chest and let them come to light carefully rationed when he was ready. It was easy. Too easy. So why didn't it work on Draco?
Harry sighed relentingly, Draco gave him an encouraging smile and then left the shower cubicle on shaky legs, where he dripped all over the floor before he bothered to use a towel.
But Harry stays where he is, savours the closeness Draco grants him of his own volition, keeps his eyes closed and hears himself murmur a barely audible "Thank you". He will not remember whether Draco answers him or not. His mind is already floating in a world between dream and reality.
If Harry is honest, Hermione's theory as to why Draco and he share the Elder Wand actually sounds logical. At least, he cannot think of any other reason. Back when he had taken Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor after their capture, it had occurred entirely in a non-magical way. He had assumed that all of the wands now obeyed him, but it had not been sufficient for the Elder Wand. That it had changed ownership at all was something that surprised Hermione when she had done her research. She explains it by arguing that, in a way, Malfoy had probably never harboured any interest in the wand. In his mind, Harry adds that Draco trusted him even then. In what way, he cannot comprehend, but Draco wished for a victory for Harry at the time, subconsciously or not. And of that Harry is firmly convinced.
"Just think about it," Hermione pleads, giving him a consoling smile. "We're here if you need us."
“Come on, you don’t want this. Think of everyone who would miss you. Your mother would be devastated if she found out that you denied the possibility of a life on land.” Harry hated himself for saying those words. Surely it was the truth, but using Draco’s mother to get Draco in bed? He felt miserable, even though he knew that he only wanted to save his life.
Edward Pythonel went down in history as one of the cruellest evildoers when, in the summer of 1978, his life's work was uncovered and brought to light. Before he could be held accountable, he took his own life after a three-day flight, crisscrossing the metropolis of London. His wife's body was found with him; to this day it remains unclear whether he dragged her to her death with him or she willingly joined him.
"Oh Harry, get over here! You must help me to rate Draco's outfits," Pansy exclaimed joyfully, as soon as she noticed him and tapped on the armrests of the chair next to her.
He hates having to break promises. He hates having to accept losses just to make rescue possible. He hates that he always seems to be the one who has to bear the pain as a result. And he hates that each time he gets his hopes up that it might be different the next time.
"Harry," Draco breathed, the movement of his hip became steadily faster, Harry was convinced he was about to explode. "There's something I – Oh!" Harry's hand on Draco's arse went lower and slid between Draco's legs. "– wanted to try," Draco finished his sentence with more or less dignity.
There is a cold tension in Draco's body and his eyes dart hastily to Ron before he can focus on Harry again. "I could
Harry wakes up, freezing and with a sore neck, as something firmly but gently rubs his back. He flinches, reflexively groping for his wand under his pillow, but there is neither pillow nor wand. Instead, a soft voice whispers words of reassurance. A shiver climbs down his spine and he allows Draco to guide him to his bed, still half asleep.
. When neither of them said anything, Draco grabbed his wand and walked over to Harry to leave the bathroom past him. Before he could go, Harry held him by the wrist.
The other boy grabbed Draco's hand. "Call me Viper, Draco Malfoy."
"What we have just sort of happened. I'm not going to lie, Ron came up with the bet because he knew that I'd... I don't know... that I'd like you? He's known me longer than most, and he wasn't wrong, obviously. Draco, the bet didn't motivate me to... initiate this between us."
the very hottest thing I could have imagined. I'm more than satisfied because my husband is the most beautiful creature in the universe and –"
At the small reception, Jimar stands next to the young blonde woman who has since introduced herself to him as Lucy and is currently laughing with flushed cheeks at something Jimar has whispered into her ear. There is no sign of Healer Isaksen yet, although Harry is a little late. He silently hopes that the Healer has not left already out of impatience, but it seems conceivable.
Jimar nods in affirmation and walks them down the corridor, opening the door to a small, sterile equipped office and asking them to enter. Anja leads the way, not willing to watch Mr Potter's reluctance any longer.
"I'll take that humbly as a compliment," Harry retorts, almost drowned by another demanding mewl.
Perhaps time was exactly what we both needed right now.
"You know when doctors tell you to walk it off? Walking doesn't only help with pain," Harry explained and started to walk again. Draco looked bloody
This is one of those moments when Draco simply accepts Harry's words but does not take them any further. It is as if he can sense they are heading towards a minefield as Harry's thoughts drift to a Draco he misses dearly every day. In those moments, he delicately pulls the brakes and allows Harry to express what he needs to say without actually responding to it. In most of these moments, Harry can contain himself. In others, he cannot.
Harry frowned in confusion, but simply complied with the request to play along. “I don't really know. Hermione said there are several names. Mermaids, sirens, nymphs – no wait! I think it was called Merman?" Harry replied, visibly struggling to recall all the information correctly.
He trusts the Aurors. If they think Malfoy knows enough to serve them as an informant, Harry will be only too happy to act the owl and supply them with whatever he can coax out of Malfoy. Well, not
Actually, and he is becoming more aware of this by the second, he never gave Malfoy a chance to prove himself.
Because Harry could almost feel the tension, he turned back to the bay windows and gave them a moment to introduce themselves.
Resolutely, Harry lifts his head again and looks into Hermione's distraught face and Ron's aghast one. "Yes, I am."
What if he would? Would he pretend the kiss never happened? Would he keep his distance? Was Draco really able to stay away?
"Good," Draco returned with an amused grin, then rolled over to his side so that he was suddenly much closer to Harry's face. So close that Harry could

Draco Malfoy was wearing a ponytail.
Draco turned even paler. "I hate them!"
Harry didn’t know what he was doing. His
There was indeed a cake. Ron had managed to get a cake every year since Harry's twelfth birthday and didn’t disappoint this year. It was a cheap raspberry cake from the discount store that he had hidden in the kitchen freezer, Harry was thrilled to bits. Even though Harry hadn’t announced his nineteenth birthday, everyone knew about it when he entered the dining hall with Draco. They had all pitched in, moved the tables to form one big table and made a garland with his name on it. Congratulations were yelled at him, he was hugged far too often, then the cake was cut and everyone got their fair share. With twelve people each got only a small piece, but it didn't bother anyone in the least.
While Harry is still walking around the counter, strolling with Draco through the thematically sorted yet not perfectly neat shelves, he talks about songs that make him feel
A hand on Harry’s knee caught his attention and made him startle. Draco sat a bit closer to him and his hand on Harry’s knee didn’t move either, just the slightly too fast breath close to his ear reminded him that Draco wasn’t just trying to flirt with him, but that he was probably fighting an inner battle with his natural instincts. Well, his natural
Harry didn’t really listen to his two best friends anymore. Instead, he ignored his lunch in front of him and stared at the Slytherin table where Draco was eating his lunch in slow motion and looked as if he’d rather be dead.
Ron stared wide-eyed, looking just about the way Harry felt.
Jimar opens the door to his office for him and Harry passes the threshold without hesitation. When he discovers that the wall has already been turned into a glass front and provides a view of Malfoy's room, he falters and Jimar almost stumbles into him.
It was the first question that came to mind. It indicated that I still had an interest in him and in learning about him. Besides, telling me about it would require him to trust me. It was a fair combination and Draco agreed. I could sense that.
"Hey, I heard that!" complained Pansy in outrage.
Malfoy let out a faint sound through pursed lips that was supposed to indicate understanding, but I knew Malfoy did not agree with my opinion. "What would your response be if someone claimed that You-Know-Who had been a brave wizard?"
"He is and always will be a ferret," Ron notes, then grins. "But seven years is a bloody long time for a person to grow."
"The Resurrection Stone?" Harry asks to be sure.
"Draco," Harry murmured, interrupted the kiss and cast a glance over him. Framed by silky, blond hair, his features looked almost too sharp in the sparse light behind closed curtains. Although that was deceiving. Since their return to Hogwarts, Draco's features had become softer, the high cheekbones appeared more delicate than unhealthy, the dark shadows under his eyes had almost completely faded and a spark lit up the grey of his eyes. "Have I already told you today that you’re bloody beautiful?"
Why did he feel all fuzzy-headed with a bloke
That the Aurors were indeed planning to destroy the diary I had learnt from Jimar. Robards explained his decision on the basis that it was a supposedly dangerous piece of evidence. I believed much more in the theory that the Aurors feared Malfoy would claim it before it was over with him. That he had not done this so far was akin to a miracle, but I blamed it on Healer Isaksen's eloquence, which seemed to bear fruit even with Malfoy.
On this Friday, Harry will not get to listen to Dvořák again.
, Ginny! Don't you think I
I spoke in a surprisingly composed voice, considering the fact that Malfoy had just implied the worthlessness of an entire group of people. I did not let my tone indicate that my blood was boiling in my veins and that I genuinely would have liked to push him out of the window. No, I still retained that much control.
Sirius. Draco felt as though he should know who this person was. If he was honest with himself, he knew
"I know enough about the diary to be sure that I wouldn't be in any actual danger if I were to enter it without the protection spells," Harry continues in a firm voice. "The chance that the answers we seek are in the veiled memories is too high not to try. I just need more time."
"Protection. I almost forgot the spell," Draco mumbled at Harry's uncomprehending look.
"Um, Harry," Ginny said, Harry could practically see her frown. "Are you
The second part was the theory of linking spells and since they had to sit at tables for this part and not, as in the practical part of the lesson, walk around freely in the room, Harry was already looking for a suitable sitting partner. Ron had secured the place next to Hermione faster than Harry could say “snitch” and had then grinned at him triumphantly.
The tortured groan that leaves Ginny's mouth as her head drops back piques the curiosity of six guests standing not far away, who crane their necks to look at the two of them. Ginny is not bothered in the least. "Merlin, Harry, your life is as eventful as Aunt Muriel's. Which isn't to be taken as a compliment, mind you."
"Draco! Hey! How are you?" A young man with a husky voice, broad shoulders, dark hair and eyes stepped firmly out of the lounge and eyed Draco delighted.
That is all.
As Draco attempts to follow suit, Ron gently urges him back onto the couch. "You stay here and hang on for a moment. Harry, Hermione – you go on to the kitchen."
Songs that tell of freedom, change and love.
The lake lay calm and dark in front of him. Nothing moved, no gurgling, no strange shapes between the waves, only the light wind glided gently over the water’s surface. Harry squatted down and fixed his gaze at the spot where the figure had been seen a moment ago.
"Mate! Hold on, did something happen between you two?" Ron interrupted him with wide eyes. Harry closed his mouth and examined the muffin in front of him with great interest. Ron chuckled in amusement. "I
If Harry gets one thing right in his life, it is his choice of friends. He can rely on them unconditionally, which they prove to him day after day. It is something Harry will cherish forever, although he knows he does not deserve it.
"I'm trans," Draco interrupted his flood of thoughts in a firm voice. "Transgender... if you know what that is." Draco cleared his throat uneasily but forced himself to continue looking at Harry.
Draco became even tenser beside Harry. "No, there’s no time. Potter and I have to mend the fence of the paddock." Harry threw Draco a questioning look, but the blond kept looking at his father as if Harry wasn't even there.
Draco instantly lowered his gaze and stared intently at an indefinable spot in front of him as he plucked Harry's shirt from his shoulder and hurriedly spread it out in front of him to sit on it. His cheeks had meanwhile taken on a red hue. "Pretty cocky, Potter," he murmured, obviously struggling to keep the last shred of self-respect.
He didn't resist the glossy lips for a second longer, caught them with his own while he carefully massaged Draco's cock. Draco's gasping was hot in Harry's mouth, he felt Draco resisting Harry's grip on his hands. Harry whispered words of reassurance against Draco’s lips, reaping a hot moan.
“To be honest, I think ten minutes is still optimistic”,“ Ron went one better and Harry thought he was about to fall off the bench laughing. He hurriedly wiped a tear of laughter from the corner of his eye and tried to collect himself. The fact that he was so amused about this was certainly due to his inner tension, which turned into hysteria, but that didn’t matter as long as he was having fun.
Harry's fingers and elicited a surprised gasp from him. There was something predatory in Draco's gaze as he directed it at Harry's lips.
Draco hesitantly complies with the request, wincing ever so slightly as Harry gently begins to run his fingers through Draco's hair. But he does not resist and silently permits Harry. Harry wonders why he had assumed that Draco's hair was brittle and dull. Beneath his fingers, it feels as soft as it did when he wore it short. The only difference is evident in the love Draco holds for it.
Oh, God, but that also meant he was the only arsehole. Though he doubted that Draco would have forgiven him even if he'd told him sooner. He might not have opened up to Harry in the first place if he hadn't allowed the trust to grow. Harry felt so stupid, so unbelievably stupid, that he hadn't thought about how problematic this bet could become.
"And...?" Draco bit his lower lip and studied Harry's face carefully.
are the owners of the Elder Wand.
I looked around in confusion. I could have sworn that I had just been in that corridor. The diary did not quite match the reality of Hogwarts. No paintings adorned the walls, nothing but gaping emptiness and silence pervaded far and wide. I turned right, which had to be the way towards the Great Hall, but instead of approaching the staircase, I found myself once again in the same corridor leading towards the same turn-off. It was as if I was running in circles.
Because Harry only grumbled annoyed, Ron looked up for a second. "You fell off a
had tried to enlighten him? The thought was... disturbing but amusing and distracted Harry from his inner anguish.
Harry was actually hoping that his empty stomach would help the alcohol take effect more quickly, but is then tempted to try one of the chocolate tarts with vanilla cream filling. In the meantime, Ginny tells him about the countless press conferences she has to endure on behalf of her Quidditch team and how she instantly singles out the reporters, who have never so much as glanced at a sports article in their lives, and how she enjoys her pranks on them. She does not mention Malfoy again.
"Hey!" Harry complained, Ron was still his best friend. "You better get off your high horse. If I remember correctly,
at him.
"Is that his name?" Harry inquired.
"Dealing with former convicts is really a disaster," Ron confirms. "In the Ministry, everyone turns a blind eye and every time the suggestion to change something about that comes up, it's brushed off the next moment."
I cut him off, not at all interested in his flimsy excuses. "Then tell me who else was involved, if it wasn't your family."
"Harry..."
Harry smirks and shoves his toes into the cosy warmth between Draco's knees and the couch. "From something that might be more important to me than you."
He had to try something else. Something that Hermione would probably have slapped him for if she had known about it. Something that required him to exploit his boy-who-lived status with Slughorn and something that robbed him of a great deal of his dignity. But he did it, seeing no better solution. After all, Draco’s birthday was exactly one week away, which caused a certain level of panic among all involved.
But let's start at the beginning: It all began on a warm summer's day in southern Wiltshire, England. The sun burned mercilessly down on the little-used road, but the cool wind made the heat seem bearable. It was the perfect day, the meadows bloomed in a rich green and yellow, the freshly harvested corn fields lay like brown splashes of paint in between and completed the picture flawlessly. The sky was bluer than it had been for a long time, not a cloud was visible far and wide.
Draco's gaze darts distrustfully along Harry's body and visibly relaxes when he realises who is standing in front of him. He lowers his head, looks past Harry, draws his knees to his body and wraps his arms around them, trembling. Something about the sight makes Harry think that the person in front of him is not Draco, but a fragile porcelain doll that needs to be treated with great care.
He kept looking.
. Harry’s cheeks became hot at the thought and he was greatly relieved that Draco’s eyes remained closed.
“I think I have to vomit.”
I nodded in understanding. "Too many questions without an answer. Yes, I know the feeling."
"Don't get me wrong, Mr Potter. You have no idea how upsetting this news is." Isaksen's expression remains perfectly neutral as she gives Harry a meaningful look. "I can hardly believe it myself."
Gently, Harry began to run his hand through Draco’s silky and slightly tousled hair, while he watched attentively as Draco’s eyelids began to flutter. The mermaid – no,
Instead, he looked past Draco and struggled for the right words. “I – listen, I have this insatiable need inside me. My
Hermione nods affirmatively. "If I'm not mistaken, you two don't have a particularly good relationship. Do you even like him as he is now, or do your feelings solely relate to his diary?"
Edward's grinning face popped into his field of vision. "That was
It appears to be an unwritten law that people's stories only acquire importance when the respective people are no longer among the living. This is true for remarkable artists and persons of great deeds who, after their death, finally receive the praise they deserved in their lifetime. But it is also true of the cruellest of all people, whose stories inspire sheer horror and not infrequently end up as horror stories told around a campfire in the dark of night.
Every sense of Harry was fixated on him.
"Potter, you're acting utterly deranged," Malfoy's voice informed me, sounding a whole lot more in control despite the accusation. "Calm down and then we can talk about everything. It's all –"
Draco tilts his head back, giving Harry the opportunity to kiss and suck on the sensitive skin under his jaw. All the while, Harry moves to meet Draco's touch, listening to himself gasp softly as Draco's fingers expertly ghost along the cleft between his cheeks, yet never touching his most sensitive parts.
"Hey, lovebirds," Ginny called out to them. "Is this going to last the rest of the week and we'll never catch you two apart again?"
Draco excused himself to bring Feykir back to his stall and left them alone. Lupin crouched down next to Hedwig, routinely inquired about previous illnesses and the nature of the seizure, Harry answered the questions to the best of his ability. Meanwhile, Lupin took a closer look at the dog, after a few minutes he sighed and got up again.
But Draco, who moved him a little bit away from himself to take a closer look at him, seemed nothing more than worried and maybe a little relieved. Relieved that it was over. “Are you all right?”
He glanced briefly at the tower window, at the spot where a moment ago the memory had been visible. Now only the sun cast lemon yellow dots against the glass. Despite his statement, he did not seem as if he doubted his theory. Not in the least.
"Just answer me one question, Potter," Malfoy opened. "Do you believe I owe you accountability?"
Draco's tongue licked over Harry's lower lip and he hummed contentedly. "Love, your eyes are closed, you cannot see me."
! The talented ajuna_hp_art (on Instagram) also drew Draco and he looks ABSOLUTELY stunning!
"She died of what is believed to be a genetic blood curse on the seventh of May in a hospital in the south of France," Harry hastily rattles off the facts that Healer Isaksen has told him. "The Ministry has only recently discovered that the deceased witch was your mother, as she was living there under an alias. There ... is no indication yet if she left you anything."
"Yes." As sincere as the answer was, it spilt from my lips faster than I could have contained it.
“It’s definitely not Filch!”
"Before the details were settled, he started performing magic," Jimar continues in a casual tone. "Wandless, of course. It turned out to be uncontrolled magic. Anj- I mean, Healer Isaksen and the Aurors thought it wiser to keep him here where he can't accidentally hurt anyone. And he consented to that."
Malfoy's eyes widen, his entire body freezes and his already pale skin turns a whole shade paler. His lips part, but no sound leaves his throat.
Almost in awe, I opened my eyes, blinking against the light of the sunset, and caught sight of Draco kneeling before me, welcoming me with a gentle smile. My hand rested, covered by his own, against his cheek, prompting me to muse if my palm had always nestled against his face as perfectly as if made to fit.
Draco nodded slowly, followed the shape of Harry's lower lip tenderly with his thumb and then sighed. "It helps, though. Although I must admit, I'm not quite sure whether I want to slap or kiss you right now."
Jimar demands no explanation, sets aside a copy of the comic book
"Come on," Draco said, glancing intently over his shoulder at Harry. "You may slide forward again."
by the way – he had just ignored it all and now his resistance evaporated. It made sense; reason took the side of the part of him that wanted to help Draco. Harry was a bit ashamed that he hadn’t come to this conclusion before. Hopefully, Draco would forgive him.

had a girlfriend?" Theo asked, impressed, and Ginny laughed out loud for five minutes straight about it. Ron kicked her three times against the shin, but he didn't feel genuinely offended. Especially since Hermione gave him amused looks and then whispered something into his ear that made Ron blush.
Draco chuckles. "So it's not all new after all."
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted calmly, opening his eyes and gazing at Harry, who expressed pure understanding. He knew how Draco felt because he was going through exactly the same emotions.
Harry frowned intently, put his glasses on while still leaning over Draco, and tried to blink the remaining tiredness out of his eyes. Then he reached for his mobile phone and tried to decipher something on the bright display.
My thoughts were everywhere but in the here and now. The hospital's owl, which had informed me that my presence was expected at the same time on Friday, had summoned me for the day far too quickly. And now I was roaming the corridors of Hogwarts in the depths of Malfoy's diary, trying not to think about the fact that I had blithely stood Nellie up without an apology.
"Oh, Ron, it was
He rose, reached out his hand to me, causing me to take it and go after him. We crossed the room and stopped in front of one of the tower windows. Almost instantly, the glass changed colour and behind it appeared the now familiar park in front of Malfoy Manor.
Harry stubbornly keeps his eyes straight ahead as he hurries down the corridors of the second floor, the
thing – and now a case is only half as bad because it was
Hundreds.
Ron and Hermione take turns visiting Harry and are thus also the ones who inquire about Draco's condition and take on the responsibility of nursing him back to health. Draco's answers are as monosyllabic as they were at the hospital, but at least Nellie assures them that Draco's physical condition is as stable as it could possibly be at the moment. This eases everyone's minds but also ensures that Harry dwells on his newfound time.
"Yeah! It's a Vespa GTS 300, in my opinion, the most powerful model on the market. The previous model can't compete with it at all, the engine is much more powerful. Depending on the torque up to 18 per cent more power, you can't imagine what an effect this has. My favourite change, however, is that they’ve revised the continuously variable transmission, which results in a –" Under the table, Ron kicked hard against Harry's shin. Harry threw Ron an indignant look, but took the hint and stopped his rant. "– a better driving experience."
Anja betrays her morals by implying that Azkaban is a place that allows its convicts to report their ailments or the like to a staff member. She does not believe in it, truly she does not, but she does not risk her secret.
Harry felt unbearable heat flare up at the back of his neck and wondered for a moment if the timing wasn't a little inappropriate. But now it was too late anyway. "Underwear... for women?" he explained hesitantly.
Harry took the opportunity to clear his throat quietly and tap the back of Draco's hand with his fingertip. "Were
Just as Harry whispers the first word of the incantation, Draco squeezes Harry's hand tightly, throwing him off. "Let me see it."
Gently, Draco's loose fist wrapped around both of our erections, shifting his hips towards me while my senses were too blurred to capture every last feeling burning inside me.
"Well," Harry swayed his head thoughtfully from right to left, his gaze losing focus. "Yes, but also no? It's also about femininity, but about
In all fairness, it must be mentioned that Harry was not placed right next to Draco. He was seated next to Neville, whose table was next to Draco’s and Goyle’s. But still, the two tables were so close that they could easily talk without anyone else noticing. Not that Harry wanted to do that. He obviously just wanted to focus on the class.
Cool air struck Harry, much cooler than in the previous summer nights when he stepped out of the Hogwarts entrance hall and followed the path to the Great Lake. The night was clear, the stars shone brightly and the waxing moon provided necessary light. As soon as Harry was sure he was far enough from Hogwarts, he pulled the invisibility cloak off his shoulders and walked along the rest of the way to the lakeshore. If the waterspirit was already watching him, he didn't want to startle it further by only showing himself at the shore.
.” He looked up at Draco's face. The light hair fell stubbornly on his face, his cheeks flushed. He pushed his lower lip forward a little bit and frowned. Hell, he would
He crawls under the warm covers, closes his eyes again and for a few seconds can only feel Draco's fingers running through his hair and leaving a tingle on his scalp. Then he dimly remembers why he fell asleep at the kitchen table in the first place. With difficulty, he opens his eyes again, watching hazily as Draco places what must be his glasses on the nightstand and moves to get up from the edge of Harry's bed.
Completely stunned, Harry blinked quickly a few times, his jaw dropping before he gathered himself again and swallowed noisily. An unknown tingling sensation ran through his stomach area and gathered in his groin. Before he could say anything, Draco gave him a triumphant look.
Draco raised his eyebrow, then grabbed one of Harry's hands and looked at it for a moment with furrowed brows before looking up again. "They're not very long."
Slowly Harry turns and walks back, looks into Draco's eyes, in which he can read nothing but nervousness, and stops only in front of the bed. It takes all his effort not to interpret this small wish as a sign of trust and just regard it for what it is. The wish for connection, for something that relieves his fear. He probably would have asked anyone for it.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t
Draco...
to push away his insecurity and guilt. Two days and he would return to London if Draco wouldn't listen to him by then, Harry was sure they would never see each other again. The thought sent a nauseous feeling through Harry. He pulled his knees to his body and wrapped his arms around them. He felt so lost.
"No, because you –" Draco interrupted himself by squeezing his lips shut. Then he threw an angry look at Harry, which softened within seconds and sighed softly. "Forget it and come here!"
"Oh, please," Mr Potter furiously interrupts him. "Am I supposed to understand this conversation to mean that I’m the only one who has access to the book, which
Harry didn't need to see Draco to know he was grinning derisively. “Apart from the fact that you shouldn't flatter yourself about it, I'm convinced that you won't return the flirtations… or can’t.”
by a waterspirit,” he remarked unhelpfully.
Harry's mouth opens, but no words leave his lips. His mind races. He knows it is impossible for the Elder Wand to be in the possession of a Death Eater. The wand has been missing for years, but the Elder Wand does not change ownership without a fight. And he would certainly remember such a fight.
"Your body temperature is below thirty-two degrees. We have reached moderate hypothermia, from now on your consciousness will be clouded."
"Firstly, that doesn't answer my question. Secondly, since when do
Draco suddenly sat up and crawled away from the patch of grass where he'd just sat. "
The Sleeping Draught had also been a stupid idea, it had apparently had little effect on Draco, considering how agile he had been the next day. Besides, Harry hadn’t gotten the opportunity to steal the ring unobtrusively. He had the ring, but that was only due to his unrestrained luck. It was a mystery in itself that Draco hadn’t noticed.
"You were right," I whispered into the silence. "About Viper, I mean."
be the jealous type, though not without reason, and on the other hand because he felt a little satisfaction at the thought that Viktor hadn't been too serious after all. "I’m not jealous! At most I'm curious."
This time, Blaise eyed Harry, but with a more friendly expression than before. "Yes, he did," he replied quietly. "And the question isn’t what, but who."
"Check us." Harry gestures invitingly. "Check everyone who leaves this hospital. I haven't a clue about the disappearance of the 'exhibit'."
Harry nearly laughed hysterically, his head shook without his permission, he wanted to smack himself and stopped the movement immediately. "I –" Shit, this was hard. Pointlessly so, because he
, he admonished himself, as he felt something irrational was stopping him. All right, he would do it, just one little thing he wanted to do before. Touching the fishtail would have been too risky, besides, it was underwater and Harry didn’t plan to go swimming today, so Harry stretched out his hand and stroked two adjacent scales on Draco’s shoulder blade. The scales were smooth but didn’t feel slippery in any way, which was not bad at all. Harry let his fingers slide down, traced the scales that appeared sporadically on Draco’s back. It was as if Draco’s glow only intensified under his touch, leaving a trail where his fingers slid along.

As if Harry's lips were a bloody magnet, Draco followed them, also sat up, kept his hands buried in Harry's hair and continued their kisses unhindered. Harry feverishly began fiddling with Draco's shirt buttons, keeping his eyes closed and anxiously hoping Draco wouldn't notice how much his hands were trembling. It took longer than usual to pull the shirt off Draco's shoulders, but when it was finally done, Draco freed his hands from Harry's hair, interrupted the kiss and quickly began unbuttoning Harry's shirt.
Harry felt dizzy, wishing his ignorance back as he staggered backwards and slammed against the cool wall. His head hurt where it had made contact with the stone, but Harry didn’t care. What,
Being able to touch bare skin, Draco, and then touching
There weren't many activities left. In fact, there was only one activity left. The Pony-Olympics. But this was the one in which the winner of the competition was determined. Draco and Harry's score difference would be caught up in no time. Mr Longbottom had just sentenced them to lose. It was hardly a drama for Harry, but Draco looked as if he was about to lose it.
"As long as the 'little angel here, little angel there' doesn't start up again, you can all call each other what you like," Pansy joined the conversation. Draco's body tensed in Harry's arms.
Without giving too much thought to the consequences, Harry summons a chair with a flick of his wand. "Sit down. I know something that’ll help you."
February dawns inexorably upon them, providing the first snowless days in weeks. Progress in their work is slow, the constant sifting through books is tedious, yet it is all they can do. Hermione consults her colleagues but again remains unsuccessful. Over and over again and no matter in which direction they research, they return to one and the same theory: Draco is the one who has to detach his magic from the scars in order to heal the wounds completely.
Ron leaned against the door frame opposite Harry, handed Harry a chocolate muffin and threw a sceptical look at Neville, who had gone quiet for a moment. Harry thanked Ron and immediately started eating the muffin. It was indeed delicious and just the thing to distract himself from unpleasant thoughts of Viktor and Draco.
"You're here because you're quite a handful to save," Harry replies, achieving what he had hoped for: Draco looks at him.
But somehow all of them survived to tack up the ponies and made their way to the riding arena where they started to mount. Hermione, just like Draco, had decided to leave her horse in the stable for the time being and concentrate fully on her teammate. Apart from Blaise and Neville, there was no one else in the arena and they only let their ponies walk around on long reins.
For a split second, Malfoy's expression dropped, but he regained his composure surprisingly fast and a snide expression slid onto his face. "Would that explain my callousness?"
As soon as Jimar leaves the office, life rushes into his body. It was no coincidence that he ignored his friends' invitation to a joint toast at midnight, buying himself time for his mission. He hurries around the desk, rips open every drawer, lifts every file, every book and every sheet of parchment three times until he admits defeat.
, it made it impossible for me not to at least try. The waterspirit promised me that I could use the information to protect you from the curse and –”
Draco's mind voice growled annoyed, but the stream of memories actually slowed down. Harry almost sighed in relief as he began to search in rapid succession.
He does really like him. Harry really,
Draco is not even incorrect in this statement. Just at that moment, Dvořák's Romance in F minor, Op. 11 is playing, a piece Harry has always been in the habit of listening to on Fridays. He finds no reason to expand his repertoire of composers, as he always finds the right tunes for his moods.
An indefinable growl, probably Draco, who was inferior to his predator instincts, filled the room and gave Harry goosebumps. Oh god no, he wasn’t allowed to get turned on by
Fuck, Draco couldn't be serious! He hadn't imagined this desire to be that… intense. Actually, it shouldn't surprise him, it was about Draco losing his virginity. No wonder Draco's body was poised to target anyone who was available to him. Time was already running out, and making a move was the right way to get laid. Oh hell, but why him? Why couldn’t Draco choose someone else?
"Can you tell me anything about what I'm about to experience?" Harry asks, even though he already knows the answer.
Harry snorted and tried to cover it up with a hasty cough. Draco was still arrogant, but maybe he didn't need to know that now.
Edward's greatest motive was supposedly the money he generated from trafficking Squib children. Others also attributed it to his sick mind and self-hatred, which led him to want to separate himself and be above those to whom he actually belonged. It unleashed a tremendous scandal.
"Shit, hold on!"
the youthful hormones that spurred his heart to pump blood to areas that were supposed to be asleep at this hour.
Hermione nods and at last, a small smile settles on her lips. "Jimar is fine. He was already here, but you were still asleep then."
His heart skipped a beat and he stopped like his feet had been rooted to the ground. Draco was sitting at the root of the tree that Harry had leaned on when they had last been here. He had pulled his legs up to his body and wrapped his arms around them. His chin was resting on one knee, his gaze fixed on Harry. He had noticed him immediately.
"If I'd had feelings for him, it wouldn't have made my actions any better, but at least it would have justified them. But I didn't and she knew that. She held everything against me. Every mistake, every decision, every silly grin, every lie. She held my entire personality against me. It was like a slap in the face and at the same time, I could see myself clearly for the first time. Not in my own world, where I was always right, but in reality. In the eyes of my friends."
is a surprise. Harry frowns and continues to stare at the now locked door. He would have placed bets on the fact that Healer Isaksen had set Jimar to keep an eye on Harry and Filly.
We were lying on the carpeted floor of the Gryffindor common room, our arms folded behind our heads and our feet propped up on the broad sofa. The fire crackled familiarly and I could not help but wonder if Draco noticed how much I appreciated this place and therefore spent our shared time here.
"Hey, mate." A hand gently rests on his, causing Harry to turn his head in surprise to Ron, who sits down on the edge of his bed and offers him a genuinely delighted smile. "You alright?"
Anja glares at the short, bald man. "And yet, here we are."
After the flood comes the longed-for ebb.
"Your father –" I started and broke off again. To me, honesty seemed the way to go, but telling him about his father felt more like kicking a dying man.
wrong here. Only fear can paralyse him like this. Fear and memories of old days.
Draco heaved a sigh, relieved that Harry had finally understood what the curse entailed, but also nervous because he had just revealed something so intimate about himself.
An angry grumble behind the door made Harry jump. “Get lost! Or these words will be the last words you ever hear!” That was definitely Draco's voice, even if it sounded a bit distorted by the wood.
, what were they doing here? Wasn't this risky? Someone could walk past and spot them any second. But Harry wanted Draco so
"Uh, yes?" Harry returned.
For a moment, Draco seems to debate with himself, to think of words as to why the song is not suitable for a dance, but he swallows them down. He reaches for Harry's hand and lets himself be pulled to his feet and led by the waist to the centre of the room. As Harry's hands slowly slide from Draco's waist to his lower back and meet there, Draco crosses his hands behind Harry's neck.
It was nothing that anyone else would have said in response to that story. Still, it didn't surprise Harry that Draco said it. He knew that the scar hadn't saved him, but rather represented the death sentence of his parents, but Draco's view of things was so different. So full of hope. With a contradictory optimism that Harry didn't quite understand. It confronted his bitter pain and gave him a new perspective. Yes, perhaps that scar had saved him because it stood for nothing but the solicitude of his parents.
, never before had Harry been so fascinated by a human, this
. Slughorn was truly merciless when it came to exposing Harry, but the Gryffindor was not to be put off and continued his observations unperturbed.
"Your pony. Her name is Hetja," Draco explained and walked past Harry along the stable alley. Harry followed him reluctantly. "She's well-behaved, a bit stubborn sometimes, but nothing that can't be handled."
Harry's gaze finds the castle, which towers gigantically over a few treetops, close yet distant. He listens within, trying to gauge the degree to which the desire to revisit the rebuilt passages and halls outweighs the need to turn away. It is a close race with no decided winner.
It is an unfulfillable wish, they are both aware of that. Even if Harry were willing to risk using such powerful magic on Draco, it would not be right. Forgetfulness charms interfere with a person's nature and take away their identity. It is something Harry stays away from if given the option.
. He wondered who she was. Potter began to speak and walked down the hallway. Neither Weasley nor Draco followed him, giving him a moment of privacy.
Draco dodged. Only a little bit, but Harry registered the movement immediately.
has more sense of rhythm than you! Aren’t you a musician? Shouldn't you be able to master this?"
A soft splash next to Harry caught his attention. Draco appeared there, and grabbed Harry's knee. Harry immediately stiffened imperceptibly, and thought about leaning back. His face was dangerously close to Draco's, but he chose not to move. “You don't have to help me.” Draco’s voice sounded calm and gentle, in no way arrogant or mocking. He seemed serious.
“Pretty much,” Draco replied succinctly, less than thrilled at having been interrupted.
Filly stands opposite the table, slides the open book almost reverently towards Harry and looks at him with bright eyes. A mystery is about to be solved for him here; Harry wishes to be cooking in his small flat right now, listening to the sounds of Dvořák. He pulls himself together – he knows that everyone present is counting on him.
Harry may not succeed in easing the pain he can sense in Draco's body, he lacks any emotion for that. Instead, he feels his way along Draco's magic, interweaving it with his own, and finally locates what he has been searching for.
to be saved!” Harry remarked as he looked at their feet. The softness of the moment seized him and enveloped his heart with warmth.
Ron's ears immediately prick up. His father must be talking about Jimar Waters. Harry has been going on and on about him for the last few months and Hermione also seems to appreciate him as a part of the team. She has asked Ron to keep an eye on Jimar's case progress. On special instructions from Healer Isaksen. Ron has simply agreed, not quite sure what the matter was all about.
Draco grimaced, insulted. “I never said I didn’t want you.”
Draco reached for the iron door handle and opened the door just a crack without making a sound. Harry hurriedly slipped through, hardly daring to look around as his feet carried him to the door Draco had spoken of. This door also made no sound, which really relieved Harry as he walked through it and found himself in the Slytherin Bathroom. It was very similar to that of the Gryffindor’s. Some shower stalls, some toilet stalls, some washbasins with mirrors hanging over them, nothing particularly noticeable. Only that the bathroom was in dark tiles.
On Wednesday evenings, Harry visits his two best friends in their little cottage, not far from London. It is a lovely home – whenever the weather permits it, as it does today, they lounge on the veranda and enjoy the view of the green garden while chatting about trivialities. But this week is a lot different, which is why as soon as Ron has handed him a beer and Hermione has filled his plate with homemade chicken tikka, Harry tells them about his quite unusual Sunday afternoon.
Draco's stuttering, rapid heartbeat pounds alongside his own.
Draco was neither smaller nor taller than Harry, Draco towered over him by at most one little centimetre, which was not particularly noticeable considering Harry's unruly hair. This meant that Draco's eyes were just the right height for Harry to inspect them in every detail without even having to move his head. The grey was clear, like water under sunlight and yet sombre, like a thick fog on a rainy day. The eyes were framed by long, thick eyelashes, it was as if Harry was seeing them for the first time and he was no less fascinated than by Draco's scalp hair.
That was not me.
“Did you sleep well?” Ron asked cheerfully. The dark rings under Harry's eyes had, of course, caught his attention.
This question, however, was one I did not have an answer to after this conversation.
“What?” Hermione asked with raised eyebrows in Ron’s direction.
"We – We could leave it at that. It’s – Oh,
I shook my head. "No, but it gets more bearable. Most of the time, at least. It's a bit like a too-small ring on your finger. Even though the pressure is always there, you get used to it."
and Harry was too busy not to die anyway. He had no time to think of an inappropriate boner.
Oh. That was good. Not the part about Hedwig being old, but that she was fine.
There was a hint of reproach in his voice alongside the sneer. I heard myself huff. "A conversation that led nowhere because you refused to answer my questions."
"Positions!" Madam Hooch yelled and Harry hurried to position himself at the starting line. Ginny was his opponent and he would never, ever beat her without Draco's help. "On your mark, get set –"
"In a way." Draco's gaze subtly roams over Harry's features. "You should've encountered a version of me that held all the memories I'd written in the diary up to that point. It reflects, in great part, who I was at that time."
“Hmm?"
, these self-doubts were insane. Draco wouldn't have kissed him if he
"Look at me," Draco whispered, his voice piercing straight into my chest without encountering any obstruction and finding itself echoed in the eager pounding of my heartbeat.
"What doesn't exist?" Harry asks bluntly, his exhaustion completely forgotten.
For a moment Harry contemplates, but soon shrugs. "All right, but I'm not particularly good at it."
“Don’t mind him, Harry. He’s trying to be funny,” Hermione interrupted, giving Ron a reproachful look.
"Of course!"
“I'm not telling you this to… Anyway, it's – it's more than that!” Draco faltered, Harry had rarely seen him that upset. He
"Not everything you do or say, or don't do or don't say, has such an impact on those around you. Most of us are just egocentric and –"
It shouldn't have turned Harry on the way it did. But Draco's fingers, running through the blond, carefully pulling each strand in one direction and taming it, blew synapses in Harry's brain that he didn't even know existed. He would have loved to reach into the hair himself, hold it and have a little too much power over Draco.
"Granger-Weasley."
, the selection of which Harry can only shake his head at. For years he has been trying to convince Nellie to expand the range to include other small animals, but he is met with opposition.
Draco. That much was certain. Did Draco like Harry too?
My name from his mouth sounded like a melody I had never heard before and would never grow tired of.
Draco's leg bent, causing his foot to shift a bit to the side. When he tried to move it back towards mine, something seemed to stop him. I frowned, Draco's shoe was met with an invisible wall right before he could touch me. Instead of getting sceptical, he just capitulated after another attempt.
"I don't mean to make fun of you. Just understanding why –" I explained myself, but Draco interrupted the attempt.
As quickly as Ginny had appeared in the doorway, she turned around again and slapped both hands over her eyes. Harry, who was sure he had just suffered a heart attack, stared open-mouthed from the back of Ginny's head back at Draco, who had turned bright red and pulled the entire blanket over himself. The bit that covered Harry's crotch, Harry held on to before Draco could claim it for himself as well.
"All right?" Draco asked, his head still turned towards Harry, his gaze lingering between their bodies.
Ron nodded and sat up a little while he thoughtfully let his gaze wander across the room. “Does that mean you don’t care?” he then asked calmly.
Gasping for breath, eyes closed and feeling the light sheen of sweat on his forehead and upper lip, Harry groped for Draco and caught cool fingers that had lingered on his thigh. Draco returned the slight pressure on Harry’s hand, then moved, crawling back up his bed to Harry’s eye level, while pulling the blanket back over them. Harry clearly felt Draco’s erection craving for attention against his thigh.
to do it too. Then why was it so hard to convince him?
Half an hour later Harry stood next to his scooter, handed Draco a helmet and put on his own as well. Draco muttered something about "ruining his hair", Harry laughed about it, bit back a comment about unhealthy vanity, then they got on, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's belly and they drove off.
. Is that enough?" he asked, his heart pounding a little harder against his chest at the confession. This was more nerve-racking than he had imagined.
Draco nodded against my neck. "Will you promise me that you’ll delay the end as long as it is possible? That you won't forget me, no matter what?"
Ron followed him without looking up from his phone. "Hermione showed me this chess app because there are no competent opponents here and I swear I won't let a bot beat me just because it says
Not five minutes later, Ron enters the room, nods slightly at Hermione and joins them at the table. "I gave him the stone."
Harry deliberately rolled his eyes, the helmet, fortunately, covered his beaming smile well enough. He got on the scooter and waited patiently until Draco wrapped his arms around his stomach and he was ready to drive off. The wind was blowing in his face, Harry felt Draco nestle closer to him, he sighed softly and liberated.
Draco was obviously on fire, even though he looked sceptically at the buckets of paint and needed to be reassured several times by everyone that the paint was washable. Harry still suggested Hetja to serve as their guinea pig. Her red coat colour was harder to cover than Andvari’s sand-coloured one, but should
"Well," Draco began slowly, his fingers ghosting gently over Harry's skin southwards towards his bottom. "It could be that I was looking for the
Harry would’ve liked to have agreed with a beaming smile, but he had to be honest: he was scared. Not of the announced pain, not of the possibility that things might go wrong, but of losing Draco in spite of everything. Harry smiled slightly. His heart and mind had some strange priorities agreeing with his
When Harry also raised his head, he noticed that the mirror on the ceiling had disappeared. He looked down and Draco's hair was short again. Still tousled, wisps of hair wet with sweat stuck to his cheekbones, but it was back to its usual length. "It looked good on you," Harry murmured and pushed the strands out of Draco's face. "But you always look good anyway."
Draco smiled contentedly at his work, gave Harry a breathtaking smile, then lifted himself off Harry's thighs and crawled to Harry's eye level. His ponytail tickled Harry's cheek as Draco leaned down to him for a kiss that was far too short. Harry's hands found Draco's waist, stroked down to his thighs. Draco sighed at the touch, then reached between his legs for Harry's hard erection and brought it into position. One last glance found Harry, whose pulse took on unhealthy patterns. Holy shit, Draco was about to
“Nothing, I just want to call in a favour with Harry.”
A quiet smile settled on Draco's lips.
As soon as Harry moves his aching limbs, they turn to him, rush to his bedside and embrace him, laughing with joy and relief. They congratulate each other without Harry being sure what for. Once the joy of reunion has calmed down, they sit down on the right and left sides of his bed and begin to explain.
even shared his opinion for once in this case, so Harry sighed, stroked Draco’s head, gave a curious onlooking classmate an angry look, and thought about how to tell Draco about the information he had discovered.
Draco's little grey cells were churning.
“Maybe we should begin by thinking about what we really want. Not what some curse wants or your parents or our friends want, but just us. So we can play with an open hand and start over.” Harry knew he was right about what he said. They had never had enough time to think about themselves or their future. There had hardly been time to think about these new feelings and now they had the time, as well as the opportunity. Not to use it would perhaps be a mighty mistake.
When Harry played the guitar, he was free. When he sang, he was free. When he rode his scooter down empty streets on dark nights, he was free. Then there were no jam jars full of emotions, then there was just him and freedom in perfect harmony.
His tongue wet the pink skin, saliva pooled in the corners of his mouth and threatened to overflow. Harry opened his eyes, wallowing in the sight of Draco, which he caught in the mirror through long blond hair floating in his field of vision. His eyes blissfully closed, his head thrown back so that the long hair fell silvery over his shoulders and back, his body exposed and at the same time covered with beguiling fabric, he was the most captivating person Harry had ever seen.
Draco didn’t move, even though Harry could have sworn his breathing was getting shallower, but Harry didn’t dare to move either. Affection –  he would have liked that in such a situation, so perhaps Draco would like that as well. It wasn’t intrusive, just a friendly gesture to show him that Harry didn’t mean any harm and maybe because he still felt bad about the past two days.
The words left Harry's lips as if they were made to be sung by him at this very moment. The melody flowed through his body, gathered in his fingertips and was brought to life by the soft sounds of the guitar. A shiver went down Harry's spine.
The Stairs of Eternal Torment had spared him and he had only been taken up one floor.
There are voices speaking quietly to each other, perhaps to him, someone helps him to his feet, takes him into another room and gently urges him onto a soft surface on which Harry curls up and sobs into the crook of his arm, blinded by pain.
," he started and gave him a meaningful look. "
Healer Isaksen studies Harry's face in obvious confusion, thin lines appearing on her forehead before she turns to Lucy. "Send a message to Healer Sasaki asking him to cover my rounds and notify Mrs Granger-Weasley that Mr Potter has been informed of her plan."
"And was unsuccessful?" Harry asked, thinking only of Draco and the black pony.
“What was that advice you needed?” Harry hastily asked before the two parties could murder each other with their glares.
But Harry didn’t even listen to Draco properly anymore, instead turning in the direction from where he could hear Draco’s voice and feeling blindly in the darkness until he got hold of silky hair, found Draco’s neck immediately and bent forward. The kiss was uncoordinated and somehow Harry didn’t really get it right either, due to his lack of vision, but none of that mattered.
I had told him about George and his shop, even about Nellie and her unfortunate lot which had cost her her dream. I had also told him about Luna's travels and Neville's life journey and had proudly raved to him at our last meeting that Hermione and Ron were expecting a child. When he had smirked and then let me know that I talked an awful lot when asked how I was doing, but never actually mentioned anything that was happening in my own life, I had also kept quiet.
Harry turned to Ron, who was actually, well, at least
I froze slightly and stared at Draco in disbelief. Something about his words suggested that he knew all too well that he was going to be in a life-threatening situation in his future. But did that not mean that Malfoy, who was vegetating in hospital, knew about it too? What reason did he have to keep the path of his salvation a secret?
Draco’s body, which fit perfectly like a missing piece of the puzzle into his own, drove him half-mad and Harry really had to fight to slow down and not rip Draco’s clothes off immediately. For all his panic a moment ago, he was now quite gagging for more.
"I do have a theory." It is not proper to interrupt the Minister of Magic but in all actuality, Kingsley is no more human than Harry is. "But for that, I need access to the diary again."
Just in time, Harry swallows the comment that he is only playing the song for Draco. After all, it is the latter's birthday and therefore his day alone.
Ron frowned and handed him another muffin. "Why a fool?"
“No, not anymore. I used to be in agony, but that phase passed. It depends on how quickly one can accept the curse.” While Draco was still speaking, he looked out again onto the still lake. He seemed tense and as if he was rethinking whether this was really a good idea.
I had also expected Malfoy's parents to have treated him as if he were a king's son, to have fulfilled his every wish, no matter how bizarre, as if he had not been a little brat who had relied entirely on the assistance of his House-elves far too early in his life and had not ever independently tidied up a single toy. Malfoy had always acted like a spoilt brat and his memories merely showed where this attitude had been drilled into him.
Someone who is not someone.
Harry looked away from the clear eyes that fixated on him and chuckled as he turned his back to the edge of the pool so that he now supported himself with his elbows behind him. “Maybe you're right and I’m falling for you after all.”
Silence, nothing happened.
So Harry repeats what he told Hermione: "For a start, I should stop wanting to burst into tears whenever I see him."
A few blond strands of hair that had come loose fell on Harry's face and tickled his cheek, but Draco didn't brush them away, just looked appraisingly into Harry's eyes. Harry frowned; Draco's answer was taking its time.
“Since when does the saviour of the wizarding world care about following rules?” Draco muttered, making it sound more suggestive than it should have been.
On the third Saturday, Teddy visits Harry in his small flat and they spend the whole day carving hilarious faces into hollowed-out pumpkins. In the end, they paint grimaces on each other's faces with cherry jam and Teddy dyes his hair orange to match. Pup hisses at them with his hackles raised, but by evening their stomachs hurt from laughing.
"No. But you'd like to be, trust me." Harry laughed.
Surprised, Harry frowned, but then Draco grabbed his crotch a little harder and Harry forgot why he was here. Resuming the passionate kiss, he pulled the Slytherin closer to him, at the same time fumbling with his jeans until he finally got them pulled from his hips.
Draco nestled his head back against Harry's crook of the neck, a quiet smile on his lips. Harry's heart was beating faster. He had to tell him about the bet with Ron. Of course, he had to.
"But you're already helping!" Ron remarks encouragingly. "Sure, this diary project may be shut down, that was to be expected sooner or later, but you're helping him with ... what was it again?"
Slowly, Draco lifted his chin from Harry’s bowed head, allowing him to raise it. “My fate is a curse, yours is your recklessness. Believe me when I tell you that you do need saving.”
It is more likely the fog is because of the protection spells Auror Filly told him about. "There is no need to worry at all, Mr Potter. No matter what awaits you in this book, it has been banished to the point where it cannot harm you."
I straightened my shoulders, turning to close the door which had lead to Diagon Alley a moment ago, but now all I could see was an empty classroom. I took a cautious step in the direction I suspected would lead me to Gryffindor Tower.
. Harry tried very hard to calm his racing heart. "I – uh... I have to touch you for that." Draco frowned and eyed Harry curiously. He cleared his throat and forced himself to look at Draco. "
The evening began, of course, with drinking games, which particularly affected Neville. After a while the group split, some of them were drunk enough to dance (among them, of course, Ginny and Luna), some of them were going for the snacks and talked to each other in smaller groups, some of them, Neville to be exact, were too drunk to do anything at all. Harry made it his business to assist Neville and took the young man to the pillow sitting area.
Anja glances again at the clock, which conveniently hangs just above the heads of the Aurors. The hand has moved one place forward, which means that Mr Potter is now seventeen minutes late and is presumably very much indifferent to the lives of others.
Besides, it would be bizarre to flirt with Draco Malfoy, apart from their past, the guy was a (not so) straight ten. Harry fought his way up to a seven on good days, at least by his own estimate. What the excitedly giggling girls in the hallways saw in him was nothing but his heroism, which had largely faded away by now.
Nose turned up, Draco turned briskly towards the stairs, took two decisive steps towards them and stopped just as abruptly inches away from the first step.
But no grief or sorrow emanated from the Slytherin. As if he had completely come to terms with the fact that his life was almost over. Or maybe it was like the last glimmer of pure happiness and joy before the curse carried him away and didn’t bring him back. Harry had already heard about this phenomenon. Old or ill people who were taken by the hand of life shortly before their death and were allowed a few days of happiness before they collapsed like a lifeless shell and left life behind for good.
"You're thinking of asking me something," Malfoy stated in a pointedly neutral manner.
Harry placed one hand at the back of his head and raised the other to brush a strand of hair out of Draco's face. Shit, why was he nervous anyway? "Would you even –" Harry choked on his own saliva but courageously started again. "Would you like to try it?"

Hermione sighed. She seemed to notice that Harry hadn’t understood her advice. “I just don’t want you to get caught up in something, Harry. I know that you are just following your natural or rather cursed instincts, but try to think about whether you really want to do that. You have to be aware that you won’t just sleep with each other and then everything will be the same again. Malfoy will be
