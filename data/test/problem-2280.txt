“I don't think either of you want me to be there for that,” she said, smiling softly. “If you would like to come back later, I'll make myself available. I think you need to talk alone, first. Thank you for your honesty.”
After the updates were given on the current cases (Mrs Norris once bemoaning the fact that she was once again on Peeves duty instead of a 'proper case'), Bob once again called for quiet.
I wanted to help, and I thought being an Auror was the best way to do that. I wanted to show the world that I wasn't evil.”
Leaving Hogwarts meant saying goodbye to the protection we'd had from Professor McGonagall, our happy little bubble had burst. Within days of being out of school, I realised that our lives were never to be the same again.
I couldn't do it, though. I chickened out. I couldn't tell you how many times I walked past your carriage. Pansy actually asked me if I needed a stomach potion, I'd 'gone to the bathroom' so many times.
“What the—?” Harry started but closed his mouth upon noticing that nobody was fleeing from the fire or shaking their tiny fists at him. The pictures were still—it was a Muggle resort. There would be no wizards, clamouring for his attention; no worries about the press following him.
Did you have a good night down the pub? I'm sorry I missed it. Are you free for lunch? I could do with a chat.
“So, what do you want to know?” Harry asked once they were settled into their usual positions on Draco's bed, thankfully whisky-free.
Draco could only focus on Kingsley's eyes. He knew that words were being shouted at him, but he didn't need to listen to them. He'd heard them all before. These meetings always followed the same pattern:
The look of surprised confusion soon slipped off his face as Harry looked at the—positively human—face of Draco, and saw that he was unsuccessfully trying to stifle a grin. Harry knew instinctively  that the only reason Draco wasn't outright laughing was that he didn't want to upset Harry.
No. If he didn't want the whole school (and thus the entire world) to find out his problems, he only had one choice. He'd have to turn to his room-mate, the one boy in the school who Harry could be sure wasn't
Draco's smile didn't falter. A hundred (and three; he had them catalogued) insults ran through his mind, but he'd promised to behave. And, besides, it had been a while since he'd tried to get along with the git.
“Right,” Harry said immediately, grabbing the bottle. If they were going to do this, he needed to be quite a bit less sober.
Draco slowly lifted his arse, allowing Harry’s spent cock to slip out. Flopping onto the bed beside Harry, he groaned. “Worth the wait?” he asked with a laugh.
with Malfoy, he needed to. But, as he lay in his cold bed alone, Harry missed Draco terribly. The only thing that finally let him fall asleep was the thought that it might all be worth it, and Harry would get everything he ever wanted.
They'd just had the one bottle between them that night, with Draco being exhausted from work and Harry not wanting to get too drunk—especially as he had extra children in his charge. But they'd talked a lot during that bottle—mostly about the children, before touching on safe subjects like work and family—which led to Draco extending an invitation to his place 'the next time'.
Such a small, simple word. Five letters. Two syllables. Sor-ry. It should be so easy to say. It has been. I've said it hundreds of times in the past; I've said it almost daily. Bumping into someone: sorry. Walking in on your friend and their girlfriend: sorry. Forgetting your homework: sorry.
Still nobody made any movements, so Glinda set about splitting the group into two. Draco felt a pang of loss as Harry was surrounded by Ten and the Bear. Finding himself sandwiched between Frumpy and the Giant, Draco thought that maybe this wouldn't end too well.
“No, I'd really like to go to Belle Playa, thank you,” Harry answered, biting back a growl. Harry had chosen the resort randomly but once he had thought about it in depth, he found he quite liked the idea. “And I'd like to go sometime in the next month.”
“Harry.” Hermione had her patient teacher's voice with her. “It's just one night. You don't even know what the thing is.”
“Now, if you've finished with your idiot act for this morning, we are about to be bombarded with a hoard of Hufflepufferish old women, all wanting to be served tea by the great Harry Potter himself.”
Before the rest of the students or teachers could react, a buzz went around the Hall as copies of the Prophet were passed around. Most of the Slytherin students had
Harry squinted as he tried to work out what Malfoy was saying. There were definitely too many 'me's in that sentence. He stared at Malfoy, taking in his clothes, his glasses, the small changes in his face which told him that the man was slightly different to his friend.
You were polite, but didn't try to entertain me. You answered the questions; you talked in short sentences.
Dog couldn't resist it. As soon as Harry stood back to admire his handiwork, Dog carefully took the trailing end of the ribbon and ran around the tree, unravelling it. By the time he was done, Dog was wrapped up neater than one of Draco's presents.
“At all times when you're walking in the house or grounds,” Glinda continued, and Draco didn't know if he wanted to hear it or not, “unless told otherwise, every couple must be holding hands.”
“Anyone for tennis?” came the cheerful call from smiley-greeter-bloke—Tony, Harry corrected himself.
“Draco, Harry,” Glinda said, running over to them as they stood up to leave. “I'm free now, if you want to get your last session out of the way. You must be itching to leave!”
Harry swallowed.  “Yeah.  Any better?”  He’d thrown it out there as a bit of small talk, but now, with Malfoy’s intense gaze focused on him, he found himself rather nervous for the answer.  His stomach churned a bit, like it held a batch of Cornish pixies inside.
“No, you haven’t,” Draco leered, releasing his neck with a pop.  “If that were true, it’d be warning you
– that’s why I just came down your throat.”  He caught Harry’s chin in his hand and made sure the man was looking at him when he asserted, “It felt amazing.”
After a long pause, he simply said, “I don’t get why you haven’t, then.”  There was no judgment in his tone, just a general sense of puzzlement.
,” he stated firmly, voice gone quiet with a rage Draco didn’t remember ever seeing emerge like this before.
VOLDEMORT: [taking a menacing step closer] And you didn’t think that a pud of that size would require extra time to cook?  How long did you put it in – 30? 40 minutes?  It needed

miss it, and it was simply easier to go along.  Draco didn’t have time to analyze or speculate; Grant simply murmured “Oh, good,” and flipped him around to face the sink.  Without any further prompting, he muttered a spell and sank a lubed finger into Draco’s arse.
was only a “Mister” rankled a bit.  Besides, he was young, and most of the kids seemed to appreciate the loosened formality.  (In contrast with professors like McGonagall, he wasn’t that surprised.)
.  His mother, ever the voice of compromise, had stood solidly in the middle – but even she hadn’t been enough to mitigate things.  Draco had pushed his father’s patience too far this time.  He’d been disowned.
Harry stared at the pudding, beginning to perspire, his body imitating the cool exterior of the pudding container. He broke eye contact with the delectable treat, “Well, anyway… what were we talking about? Oh, right,” He straightened his glasses on the bridge of his nose, “While some Muggles do enjoy having food sex, it’s extremely uncommon. It’s like about as uncommon as
The man stopped him with a hand in front of his chest.  “Sorry sir, you need to surrender your wand before entering.  Ministry protocol.”  He didn’t sound sorry.
Her body was tense, but he also saw a flicker of emotion run through it.  “I…wow.  Thank you so much.  I… It was never the right time to look for myself.  There were always people around, and…”
“Look,” Potter said quietly, “I just…I came to ask if you…wanted to help me with one of my lessons tomorrow.”
The man sucked in a breath and held it, green eyes roaming over his face with a new brand of hunger.  Draco shivered under the gaze, hardly believing it was happening, but willing himself to wait – though it was torture.  He imagined his hands were nailed to the ground so as not to weave them through Potter’s hair and make the first move.
“Yes, yes.  I braved the lion’s den for this; don’t cheapen it.”  He swooped in to press a kiss to Harry’s mouth, which he accepted eagerly, dropping the book he was reading.  Draco drew back, savoring the way Harry’s head lurched forward, chasing his lips.
That was impossible.  The thought hadn’t even occurred to him.  There was no way Potter would come here to defend him - after everything he had done.  It was
had realized it – had Potter?  The man was stupidly Gryffindorish; he likely wouldn’t visit Madam Pomfrey until he passed out in a corridor and someone forcibly dragged him there.
Draco flinched as he felt his mother’s gaze hone in on him again with singular interest.  “Is that so?  I’d love to hear more about my son’s accomplishments, but unfortunately, he never writes or keeps me in the loop.”
He stormed into the drawing room and felt the slightest jolt of satisfaction when shock flickered across his father’s face at the entrance.  “Mother.  Father.”  He nodded at each in succession.
No, it’s a…  Never mind.  Anyway, it’s that song that’s terrible and annoying…  It’s about graveyard smashing or something…”
“Right,” she said, “then let’s continue.  Describe, to the best of your ability, all the relevant details regarding the situation that resulted in you breaching the privacy of your boss’ mind.”
the “correct and moral” thing to do when a parent was dying – Draco was clearly just a petty, unreliable son: exactly what he’d always feared.
, Harry.  Okay.  Alright…”  He glanced down at his hand, coming to a rueful realization before confessing, “I’m going to need to take one off, though.”
Draco stiffened, remembering the last time he’d seen the man during the Triwizard Tournament all those years ago.  He’d heard rumors of the Bagman’s gambling habit after that, of course – it had been a popular topic amidst his family’s “high society” gatherings at the time, those sharks loving nothing better than stories of indiscretion leading to a fall from grace.  They’d really relished the bits about Bagman being hunted by the goblins (though there had also been that characteristic shudder of distaste when speaking of goblins, of course).
It took a long time, but when the tears slowed and dried, he picked up the statue and his wand and left the room.
Then, came the long-awaited discussion of his father’s health.  Lucius fought it at every step, cutting in with snide, self-deprecating comments separated by uncomfortable moody silences.  Mother explained the details of the Dark magic – “wasting” magic they sometimes called it – and the toll it had taken on his body.
“I really don’t deserve you,” he managed at last, when he was certain Harry wasn’t about to leave him.  Relief pooled fierce and visceral in his veins, and his body sagged like he’d been running for miles.
But the first-year was not to blame, and he forced himself to focus as he completed his rounds of the room.  In the end, he only had to confiscate a few rogue blood-spewing tablets (which held the trademark branding of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes) and round off the points on a few horn transfigurations that would surely kill someone if the students were to trip.
He reread a section of “Lions and Snakes,” feeling more than a bit smug having his dirty prose in the same room as the one it was about.  Draco took his time pondering it, knowing another similarity between him and Potter was that the man hated being ignored.  He ignored him for a full count of ten before continuing.
Bagman tossed his head back and laughed.  “Right you are, my lad!  Every man’s got to go out for a drink now and again, every man indeed.”  His eyes twinkled conspiratorially as he leaned in closer.  “Even if society doesn’t think highly of you, you know?  They can’t take that away from you, at least.”
Even prepared for it, Draco felt slightly off-balance to hear it again.  He was doing a poor job of hiding the hunger in his eyes, but – for some reason – Harry was leaning closer anyway, stretching out his hand to graze Draco’s cheek.
Draco drew himself up before looking “Google” in the face and asking, “Why do people wear stripey jumpers to parties?”
Harry stood immediately, cheeks burning, and stalked to the corner of the room, where he drew a strong silencing charm around himself like a cloak.  Draco could see his lips working but heard none of the lies that came past his lips as the seconds ticked down and away.
Draco forced a laugh.  “No, of course not.  It’s just…I mean, surely you’ve heard?  He’s doing a terrible job as a professor!  McGonagall might even fire him, he’s doing so poorly.  Everyone’s complaining about it.”
Potter wasn’t up on the witness stand excusing the atrocities he had committed, because he had simply been scared.  He knew the moment Potter was going to reference, and it hadn’t been merciful.  It certainly hadn’t been brave.  Draco had been too weak to see Potter killed and too weak to set him free, so he had merely done
Instead, he tipped Harry’s chin up with a firm, gloved grip, forcing the man to look at him.  “Yeah?  And how’ve you been
HARRY: [confessional aside] My body just kind of moved on its own.  I mean, sure, I knew he was struggling, but it wasn’t until the moment the sides were collapsing that I realized I was going to help.  [He, too, glances behind him like he thinks he might catch sight of DRACO.]  Erm, anyway, no – I don’t regret it.  I think it’s important to help people when they need it, even if it’s someone you generally dislike or find infuriating or… [He trails off, cheeks pinkening.  Unsubtly, he clears his throat and tries again.]  Are we good?  For the interview-thing?  It’s just, I’ve got to…
“Hi Sam,” Harry greeted, schooling his face into some semblance of professionalism.  He still looked like an overgrown schoolboy, though, with the unrepentant smear of caramel upon his cheek. “Yes, I don’t normally come out here on the weekends, but today seemed like a good day for a visit.”
He exhaled, driving every ounce of breath from his lungs before filling them again to bursting.  In the face of such a dizzying expanse of world before him, he couldn’t help but feel his thoughts stripped down to honesty.  He was terrified.  Terrified that Hogwarts – the only place to offer him any kindness or respite following the war – wouldn’t be enough to drive the claustrophobia from his mind.  That he was too fucked up to fit in anywhere.  That if he couldn’t make it work here, there was nowhere left for him to go.
McGonagall began announcing the faculty, and he rose in a startled motion when his name was called.  Fuck, everyone was looking at him now.  They all thought he shouldn’t be here, that it was laughable for him to step into a position so clearly unsuited to him.
mean that provoking Devil’s Snare is a harmless endeavor.  Ryan and Nathaniel will be serving detention with me, starting tomorrow after the match.”
Harry wanted to tell him – he really did – but the sudden quiet from turning down the radio made him realize the way most of the conversations in the stands had hushed at his entrance.  And he noticed more than one pair of eyes trained on him now that he was just casually talking it up with
By the time the afternoon rolled around though, not even the book could keep his mind from wandering to today’s class visit.  What had possessed him to agree to a duel?  He was clearly in no mental state to hold himself together for that.  As it was, his feelings were constantly fluctuating between an easy confidence that he had Potter right where he wanted him and the debilitating realization that he was deluded and undeserving, and it would never fucking
Harry was facing away from him, but even just seeing the tense line of his back, Draco could tell he was blushing and setting his jaw defiantly.  “Well, get on with it, then,” Harry grunted.
”  He was mainly babbling out of panic now, which was why he startled when Harry grinned wider and slipped to his feet without any warning.
“I know, right?  I wasn’t even planning to start working with them on that until next week, but I ran out of material-” he caught Draco’s eye roll, “
He left Morpheus dazed and slumped against the counter and swept into the back to collect his meager possessions and the stack of letters from his mother.  He considered nabbing some ingredients, but then realized they would be useless where he was going.  He didn’t linger further.  Mechanically, he unlocked the back door and slipped out into the night.
, but like, natural?”  Harry tried.  “That sounds even dumber, I’m sorry.  I just mean that you and I have always had a lot of…”
, Draco repeated, again, in his mind.  It felt so surreal, like a line fed to him on a stage rather than his own.  “I…don’t know if it’s sunk in yet, to be honest.”
“And,” he murmured, dragging his own gaze back up from Potter’s lips, “next time you come for a visit, make sure to check my
Hell…”  Harry was clearly scrabbling for something comforting or lighter to say; it ended up being, “So what you’re saying is… I probably
to see more of him now, but that no longer seemed likely with the way things were going.  The last view he’d had of Harry was him crossing his arms before Draco was pulled around a corner.
Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco a half-hearted shove that made him ache for more casual, friendly touches.  Knowing such wishes were dangerous, he pushed off his knees and stood.  He couldn’t resist offering Harry a hand, though, and was heartened when the man took it with no hesitation.
The elf settled the soup on the table, ladling a portion into each of their bowls with magic before disapparating.  From the smell, Draco could tell that it was heavily seasoned with celery salt – a taste his father knew quite well he despised.  As had been the case with the rest of the meal, as well.
Harry’s eyes snapped to his before immediately darting away.  “I-”  He looked terribly earnest for a moment, before his face rearranged into a grimace.  “I…should head to class.”
Draco took a long moment to consider what had set him off.  Was it the savior complex, or was there something more?  Sure, it bothered Draco too that anyone would have to go through the fear and uncertainty of growing up queer in the Wizarding World.  But that wasn’t something
He hauled in deep, gasping breaths.  He listened to them, detached, like they were happening to someone else – someone who was degrading rapidly from breaths into sobs and sobs into screams.  Screams so shrill and violent they sounded more like a silent exhale.
“Sure,” Harry said. He'd barely made it two steps before he realised what Malfoy had asked for. Turning quickly, he knocked a chair over, causing the three still sitting to look at him in alarm.
“Not here, Harry me lad,” Tom called back. “Owled me earlier, Ron did, asking me to keep the usual table for you lot. And to make sure you had a drink the second you got in. On account of it being your birthday an' all.”
Unluckily for me, Professor Slughorn happened to be walking past at that very second. Now, I didn't have my wand out, so no one could prove it was me, but I very quickly removed the Jinx when I was alone. I didn't want to be getting into trouble for causing actual injury.
Theo and Ginny had only been gone for a year, but it was good to have their friend group back together again.
One thing that Harry always made sure to do, even though it pained him, was to continue to call Malfoy by his surname. He'd almost tripped up a couple of times, and once he'd even leaned in to kiss Malfoy over the counter. Harry managed at the last second to come to his senses and grab a beaker to the left of Malfoy, but it shook Harry. He just wanted to be normal.
Harry, thankfully, remembered the basics of tennis—the scoring and the game structure—from Primary school, so as Tony explained the rules to an elderly couple, Harry scoped out the competition. It might be a bit of fun, but Harry hadn't lost his competitive edge—he wanted to win!
Harry rolled his eyes and, with a swish of his wand, sent the balled up socks that were on the coffee table up towards Draco. It was a Saturday, and they had had a late night, so they were not very awake—especially Draco. They were supposed to be seeing another house this morning, and Zach was expected very soon. Harry had finally persuaded Draco to go with him; he had explained how Draco alone could help him judge if they could fit two people into the bathtub.
After that evening, I realised something. We were friends. We were spending a lot of time together and I looked forward to seeing you. I also realised something else. Something a lot more important, and something that was almost entirely down to you.
to put a label on it, I'd offer bisexual. But it's okay if you are gay, you know. No one is going to judge you. It's not the same as the Muggle world. One way we're more forward, if you ask me. Why, I was talking to my cousin the other day—”
“Zach,” Harry said, shocked. “I gave you that key for you to show the house when we were out; not for when I'm here. I nearly had a heart attack.”
As he looked around the room, Harry thought that he couldn't be happier. Draco and Hermione had been home for two weeks, and their group of friends had arranged a party to celebrate. Everyone was sitting around Harry's living room, drinking and laughing; Neville had even made it down for the weekend.
Harry screamed as he came, Draco fucking him faster and harder until he was also coming with a scream. Draco's strength finally faltered and they both slipped to the wet floor, panting and trying to calm their breathing as the hot water still rained down on them.
Harry knew that he approximately 90 seconds before Hermione broke through his locking spell and all three women forcibly dressed him.
When Harry awoke the following morning, it was to the smell of sex and an empty bed. Harry listened carefully, hoping that Draco was downstairs or in the bathroom, but to no avail; the house was silent. Looking around, he noticed that Draco’s scattered clothes were gone, but there was hope. A cup of tea sat steaming on the bedside table, obviously under a Warming Charm, with a note propped up in front of it.
Harry pulled away from Draco to see Zach standing beside the table, chair in hand and a gob-smacked expression on his face.
Draco didn't want to make a big deal out of what Harry said because Harry seemed to be in a good mood, but he filed it away—seriously, what child didn't have toys?—to discuss at a later time and started over.
“Yes, Harry. I wanted to see you. I wanted to ask you if you fancied going out tonight. Just me and you.”
“All done. I'll have to go back in early tomorrow, but there's nothing more to do today. Hermione's orders.”
Draco had one overwhelming feeling at hearing Weasley's words when he had realised exactly who Harry was snogging on the sofa: hurt.
to see him without his clothes on? Did wanting to smile when you see someone mean you liked them? Did looking out for someone and not wanting them to get hurt mean you fancied them?
“Why don't you get dressed; it's nearly dinner time. I'll meet you down there,” Draco said, wrapping his wand back into his towel and walking towards the door. “If you want,” he added with a smile.
Harry shook his head. “I know. I'm not explaining it properly. I know you wouldn't hurt me. Not physically...”
As they ate their sandwiches—and what was it with Harry and eggs?—they chatted about the coming afternoon, and Draco didn't want to push it. He was hopeful that Harry would open up again in the morning session tomorrow.
“Well, you forgot it while we were dueling,” the man sassed back – and even looked a little put out by it too.
.  “Oh, a bit of this, a little of that-” he nipped Harry’s neck and felt him shiver before drawing back to meet his eyes.  “What do you
Harry looked sheepishly relieved, though Draco had the grace not to call him on it.  “Alright – just thought I’d offer.  I’m going out with Ron and Hermione tonight anyway.”
He mustered a nod out of politeness, half-hearted as it was.  It was all pointless – they would come for him again.  Whether he walked out of here healthy or remained bleeding out on the pitch, his fate would be the same.
About ten seats down was a large man with rosy cheeks and laughing blue eyes, speaking loudly with the man next to him.  His hair was tousled attractively, though the man himself had clearly lost the matching physique of his prime years.  Someone he hadn’t expected to ever meet again.
With a sharp tug, Malfoy pulled him in close.  Unprepared for the sudden movement, Harry didn’t even have a chance to steady himself before he was splayed messily against Malfoy’s chest.  The man paused to eye him consideringly.
“Oh, I can pin you against other surfaces too, if you’d like,” Draco quipped and reveled in the shiver it sent through Harry’s body.  They fell back to kissing with fervor, Harry pressing their interlocked fingers into the wall.  It caged Draco within his arms in the most enticing way, and when they drew back for breath, Harry was watching him.
” he cut in.  He didn’t care that it was biting.  She shouldn’t be here interfering with the one good thing in his life.  It was his, and he wasn’t going to
“-at the Manor that night I was captured.  Mister Malfoy...err, Lucius, and Bellatrix wanted to turn me in to Voldemort-”
to ignore him many times in his life as well, for all the fucking good that did.  He always ended up back where he started: absolute obsession.
CEDRIC: [confessional aside] Cho told me at home that those two recipes were winners – and she was right!  I just hope I can keep up this momentum through the technical challenge.
His thumb stilled against Draco’s fang, and he realized that Harry had wiped a drop of blood from the unnoticed puncture there.  But he hadn’t drawn away.  And now his gaze was lifting from Draco’s lips to his eyes, and the intensity of it was captivating.
Even knowing it was coming didn’t soften the feeling like the wind had been punched out of him.  Everything was happening according to his nightmares, and the “
“No?”  Parkinson’s voice was flat, and now she definitely just looked amused.  “I was unaware that you had such outfits stashed away in your trunk, then.  Too bad we never had any inter-house parties back in the day.”
“I like it when you curse,” he protested.  “You’re so disgustingly posh the rest of the time.”  He sounded so petulant saying it, too, that Draco broke into a grin himself.
He landed the fourth hit just below the third, biting his lip when Harry let out a gasping moan.  Unable to help himself, he ran his hand over the reddened flesh, kneading the sensitive skin and watching Harry writhe in sensitivity against the lockers.
It was a rough game he played, but not without its virtues, and at least he was getting better at Quidditch.  That was a more marketable skill than hiding unwillingly from customers, wasn’t it?
Harry blinked a few times in shock before swallowing and saying in a small voice, “You didn’t tell me you were cut off.”  He rubbed a hand roughly over his face.  “
“Not so fast!” came a call from across the common room.  Without further ado, Fenn and her Quidditch posse emerged from the seventh-year wing.  She stood, bracketed by two enormous blokes – Manny and…Braxton, was it? – beaters both, and it looked like a dramatic entrance he might see in a play.  “Slytherins don’t give up so easily.”
.  But Potter, being a common ruffian, was bound to show up late out of spite, so Draco had afforded a half hour window to account for that.  Really, it was a basic event-planning trick – one he’d used on Pansy many times in the past.
“Oh, so he was dressed weirdly – that’s it,” Pansy huffed.  “You’re not going to find any answers in some sparking metal box.”
”  Draco grabbed him by the front of the shirt to reinforce the severity of his own confession, but Harry merely folded into him with laughter.
Draco shrugged, letting him figure it out on his own.  Giving away nothing that could ruin any surprise.  He watched with glee as Potter’s uneventful first step turned him confident, and he stepped boldly into the passage with the ghouls.
He ascended to the ground floor, taking a deep breath and steeling himself before pushing through the doors to the Great Hall.  Kids clambered about the long tables, some glancing up at him with recognition, while others ignored him completely.  He walked briskly towards the front, debating which side of the staff table to sit at before nervously taking the first open seat next to Flitwick.  The man gave him a polite nod and nothing more.
of them had, that is.  He’d been halfway through politely declining when Fenn had appeared at his side, shouting, “Oh bollocks!  You’re barely older than us.  We’re contemporaries.  And you helped us train, so you’ve gotta share in the celebrating!  This doesn’t happen every day.”
The way he said it with such trust – like he would never doubt that Draco would follow through – made a knotted mess of Draco’s heart.  Pushing aside reluctance, he marked the page in his book, sighed, and stood to gather his things.  “Very well.”
“Well, what?”  He bit his lip to keep from cackling at the idea of Harry reading it while Draco chatted on, unaware, at the party.  Perhaps he’d been playing sad music at the time, too.
SEVERUS: [stares an uncomfortably long time before answering in an impossibly flat tone] I’m making an ‘elixir of life’ log.  The flavor, when done correctly, is said to be so delicious that it extends your life.

He smirked, summoning some parchment and tilting it so he could approximate Potter’s messy scrawl.  “
that defined every foray into Harry’s mere orbit.  It was instantaneous and calamitous and shook Draco right to his core.
Draco sighed, steeling himself.  This was it.  The moment to lay it out there – McGonagall was right; she’d earned at least that much.
After breakfast, Draco would descend to the pitch, where players could train until the games started in the late evening.  There, he’d practice his dives and rolls for hours at a time – to the point he once realized he might even beat
Throughout the rant, his eyes grew wilder, his motions more emphatic.  At the end of it, he stood panting, wasted body no longer able to keep up with his rage.  Azkaban had trimmed the edges off his father, leaving him sharper and frailer than ever before.
– for some unholy magical artifact that would let him see into Gryffindor tower at the inner workings of Potter’s life.

Potter’s eyes landed on him, and Draco squared his shoulders.  If he was going to prison regardless, then he might as well look dignified in his final moments outside.
“I’m planning Slytherin’s decorating contest that will be judged the night of the Ball.  The older students somehow convinced the first-years that it’s in everyone’s best interest to do a ‘house of horror’ in the dungeons.”
He smiled, stepping in and resting his hand upon Harry’s waist.  The song changed, turning languid and waltz-like as they fell into position.  The man was still stiff as a board – enough so that Draco leaned in and muttered, “Relax.  And
Facing the ghastly stretch of cells before him, Potter drew his wand and advanced.  Some students had gotten to this point and simply turned around.
Draco didn’t ever want to leave Harry’s room, and so he didn’t.  He stayed lounging about on the furniture until Harry had the good sense to ask the elves to send up some dinner.  As usual, they demonstrated their fervent adoration of the man by sending the most mouth-watering bowls of stew – ones that Draco couldn’t recall ever being this good in the Great Hall – along with an assortment of freshly-baked rolls and a course of pudding to finish.
Draco’s mind was clear, his feelings sharp and acute.  The jolt that Harry’s glances sent through his body was immediate and reactive, nothing like the hazy touches spiraling through his dreams.  Asleep, he was free from the prisons containing him.  Awake, Harry was helping him push back the bars.
had a chance to mess around like this back in school – in a world where sports scores were the most important things to fight about.
, after all – this could all end up being some terrible misinterpretation that left him sorely disappointed for months yet to come.
Draco gave her a flat look, which she met easily for five long seconds before huffing and gracing them all with elaboration.  “We find a boggart of our own.  We stage the scene in the dungeons.  We pretend
Mother, for her part, did not look away from his panic.  “He is still feeling the effects of Dark spells that he cast and ones cast on him.  That much has been the case for a long time, though his time in Azkaban only aggravated it.  He, of course, kept this hidden from you – despite my urgings – out of pride.”
.  It’s okay.”  He ghosted his hand over where Potter’s remained gripping his shirt.  But the man couldn’t hear him.  He was hyperventilating.
He scrambled through his stack of books, then – not finding what he was after – summoned it from his room.  He
Harry’s face was blistering with heat, and he was looking everywhere now but Draco’s eyes.  “Um, well.  Yeah, I had
, now was it?  “I had every right,” he replied.  “I warned you Potter – I said you’d regret it when you messed with my office hours.”
Draco had never been to The White Wyvern, but as it was a little deeper into Knockturn than the Leaky Cauldron, he figured it would also be less conspicuous.  He hadn’t bothered to wear a glamor – at this point, he couldn’t be arsed if the reporters caught a glimpse of him.  The best headline they’d be able to write would be, “Ex-Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, Looks Miserable as Deserved.”  Or “Draco Malfoy – Still Lurking in the Shadows; He Clearly Hasn’t Changed a Bit” – about which, the cruel irony alone was enough to make him scream.
: a man so completely oblivious that he couldn’t tell when someone had daily fantasies about boning him.  And too kindly
But Potter, looking far too pleased with himself, raised the snitch for the students to see, completely unaware of this injustice.  Then, his eyes caught on Draco’s.
“What, I can’t make a social call?  Surely, someone’s come to visit The Boy Who Lived at some point in his life,” he teased.  In a lot of ways, Potter was like him – he was proud; therefore, he wouldn’t crack easily to show his true thoughts.  He’d need some working.
Anyway, we're getting into some of the queer mentor moments that are near and dear to my heart.  I just have this mental image of awkward preteen boys flocking to Harry for advice, while queer preteen girls would definitely gravitate towards Draco.  That's just how I imagine it, at least.
Grant thrust up into him, and the shock of pain drove Draco fumbling for purchase against the sink.  He braced himself better for the second thrust, and his eyes found their reflection once again in the mirror.  Flashes of dark hair and green eyes swept fleetingly through his mind, and, forcibly, he banished them.
after – it’s not like it came as a total surprise to anyone.  We just sort of fell into this relationship through shared momentum, and it just kind of
.  It wasn’t hard – Hermione had just made sure to tail Malfoy yesterday, compile all of his regular locations, and then cross-reference his
Oh yes, he remembered The Plan.  He was already regretting their decision to make one without consulting Hermione first.  Surely the discomfort of confessing all this to her would have been better than what he was dealing with now.
Draco felt his heart clench at the wistfulness in her tone; it had been a long time since such light-hearted fun, for her.  “We’re still deciding.  One of the seventh-years is scoping out the competition first.”
The last bit had been intended as a joke, really – but the effect the order had on Harry was too dramatic to ignore.  His pupils blew wide, and his nails dug into the smooth fabric of Draco’s trousers over his thighs.
“I heard an interesting rumor today.”  He flipped through the pages lazily, opening it to the section he had added.  It really had been an inspired prank idea – even if Potter hadn’t discovered it yet.  A veritable stroke of genius.  He hoped Potter would notice soon.
“I…”  His mother laid a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder – in it, all the fear she felt for him.  Clearly, she wanted to say more, but Draco covered her hand with his own and gave a quick squeeze before removing it.
It wasn’t a long journey – this week’s party was in the 8th year common room, where most of them happened.  They would occasionally switch it up and go to the Room of Requirement (which he’d been pleased to see at the beginning of the year had decided that the students
“Sure,” Harry said, voice colored with relief.  Like Draco, he was probably happy to avoid an argument – about serious things at least, since they both had agreed long ago that playful banter was a turn-on.
relationship,” she insisted, going completely ignored by the men.  “Fine.  Whatever.  Don’t know why I suggested it, really.”
“Nonsense!  This could be my last year on earth, and I’m going to spend it with my whole miserable family.”
Draco leveled him a glare that hopefully hid the desperation for answers in his eyes.  “You want to play pranks?  Fine.  I’ll make you regret this, Potter.”
There would be no pleasantries, then.  Just right down to business.  “Right,” he managed.  “Of course.”
Draco dragged himself into the dingy bathroom at the back of The White Wyvern.  He’d taken a few nasty hits – from both bludgers and brooms – and he was reminded of Grant’s words when he’d started the games a month ago: “You’d best be able to drag yourself up the stairs before you pass out.”
It tore through the air like a stinging hex, and, in less than a second, he had to swerve the handle away to avoid colliding with the ceiling.  He pulled to an unceremonious stop.
VOLDEMORT: It does.  I’ve never seen a Star of David made out of rugelach, and now I’m kind of wishing I had.  We have a lot of flavors to try here, so let’s get to it.
[The scene changes to Week 2 – which is also overlaid in text in the bottom corner of the screen, lest the audience lose track of the recap.  We see flashes of contestants mixing, rolling, and decorating as they brave the obstacles of Cake Week.  It reprises humorous moments, such as:]
“Ah, I see,” Draco replied quietly.  And he did.  Harry was still undecided, then, about telling people.  Either that, or he was feeling Draco out – but why would he need to?  Draco had practically admitted that he’d do anything Harry wanted, as pitiful as that might have been.
“Actually, I…” Harry forced the words out, “I still had it.”  It felt mortifying to admit, and he didn’t meet Malfoy’s eyes for a few beats after saying it.  When he did, the man was staring at him, wide-eyed, not bothering to brush away the bangs that had blown messily across his forehead.
He stood slowly, somehow limber despite the prolonged time spent on his knees – Harry still rather thought his own would give out.  The look Draco was giving him wasn’t helping.
“I…I-” Potter was stumbling over syllables, and Draco really should’ve stopped, but some idiotic part of him truly believed that pressing this issue would get them somewhere.  Like they were on a precipice, and if
But seriously, sorry for the gap in posting.  Unfortunately, it's probably going to be a similar gap between now and the next chapter, as I have to still write a whole story for
Draco ran a hand through his hair, not even caring that it would look tousled and distressed, just like him.  “Of course.  Why would I expect you to think
Each morning, he was caught at this impasse, and each morning, it was the image of his father waiting at the Manor that made him put off reaching an answer.  Even if he did end up going home, he could never muster up the energy to face both Morpheus and his father in succession.
“Hi Mister Malfoy!” some of them chirped, and – without quite intending to – Draco found himself breaking into a smile.
“Why’d you roll up your sleeves today?” Potter asked.  And then he flinched, like he hadn’t quite meant to.
Caught totally off-guard, Draco found his body obeying.  He slipped in next to Harry, forcing down the rampant lust in favor of cherishing this quiet moment.  His hair fell in his face, and Harry brushed a strand back in an infinitely soft caress.
“Splendid!” she continued.  “As I was saying, I’ve been meaning to find a time to chat with Harry and yourself – make pleasantries and the like.”
He blushed beautifully, color rising rapidly to the apple of his cheeks.  “Yeah, well…I probably chose this costume before you!” he spat.
That earned him a smile.  “I think ‘consort,’ ‘fraternize,’ and ‘sodomy’ all came up during our discussion.  Lots of adjectives.  Heirloom guilt.  No terms for dating past the 1800s.”
He turned to locate the voice in the crowd, but Malfoy’s hand, just coming down from spinning him, grabbed him by the chin and turned Harry’s face sharply back to face him.  Harry gulped as Malfoy’s hand slipped back to interlace with his, and those fiery, gunmetal eyes met his with infinite challenge.
[It cuts to FRED, throwing another peace sign and sticking out his tongue, before he flips the camera around and trails HARRY and DRACO shakily to their hiding spot behind the tent.  Their positions are oddly reminiscent of this time yesterday, only today there’s one major difference – they’re
Harry’s heart thundered in his chest.  Had he done something wrong?  Had Malfoy finally gotten it and
“I choose to continue,” he said immediately.  His stomach roiled with a mixture of ominous foreboding and hope – because, somehow, despite admitting to something illegal, he was still being questioned by the judge.  He couldn’t lose this chance; he
Draco felt his mania leaving him in a rush.  All the questions, all the tensions of the past two months – but at least he had
Draco glanced up, coughing and swallowing a few more times before he had the wherewithal to raise a brow at the suddenly-teasing tone.  It was as if a demon had been possessing Potter before and now was exorcised.
“So – what?” Harry growled.  “You kiss me once, and then you’re going to leave me here pining after you?  Like I’ve been doing for weeks?”
But he still hadn’t seen Potter.  And by the time dueling club rolled around the next day, he was desperate enough for information, that he decided – against better judgment – that he really ought to attend and see. And, unfortunately, his insanity was only validated when the crush of whispers outside the classroom forewarned him of Potter’s presence; they rushed into the room with a singular excitement that followed the Savior wherever he deemed to go.
Hey everyone!!  Hope you're all doing well.  I've had a bit of a hard few weeks, but I finally got my shit together to pound out another chapter.
– and it showed that Harry must’ve been thinking about him nearly as much as Draco had been thinking of Harry.  They had kissed again then, Harry asking if he could in the most adorably straightforward way…and Draco hadn’t been able to resist teasing him a bit by stripping down his pants before Harry could work up the courage.
He was out of luck. Malfoy was already sitting at the counter, measuring and making notes on a chart. He looked like he'd been there for hours.
Harry groaned into the bed sheets. I patted his hand, hoping he'd keep quiet as I desperately wanted more information, because hello! I should have been dead, not listening to story time. Not that I was complaining.
. I just hoped to Merlin that the house-elves made sure my mother didn't see it. The title was bad enough; the story was even worse.
: This is technically a prequel to No Easy Thing, but I highly recommend reading that before reading this. All the thanks and hugs to G for all her help.
He hadn't needed to worry; Draco's owl had come just before the lunchtime rush, telling Harry that he would be in a meeting all day, that he would see him at eight and giving the address of the pub he wanted to meet at. After Harry—and Pansy—had read the note, he gradually got more and more nervous about the evening ahead. Harry was used to being out with Draco—they spent most weekends in each other's company, after all—but this would be the first time that it would be just the two of them.
Once the three of them were sat at a table, Harry took a long gulp of his Firewhisky. “So, did you two try and get out of this evening's festivities?”
“Well, for example,” Harry said. “You prefer plain old Harry to Harry the All Powerful, right? It's like that.”
. Harry was completely sure that Malfoy hadn't been with him all weekend, which threw up one big question. Exactly who the bloody fuck had been eating all his biscuits?
Harry had seen a lot of Draco in the last couple of months, and they had become friends. Not as close as Harry would've liked, but friends nonetheless. Draco usually dropped into work to speak to Pansy at least twice a week and they, along with their friends, had started socialising since Harry and Pansy had become quite close friends.
“Me neither,” Draco said. “Of course. But, do you think we could get changed out of clothes for once? Grenville is going to have a nightmare getting the creases out as it is.”
“Now, Draco. I've heard Harry's account of your life before you became partners, is there anything else you'd like to add?”
“I wrote to you months ago, telling you the truth. You didn't get it?” Harry thought back to that day. Something clicked in his brain; something that Harry thought he was stupid for not realising at the time.
Draco tried his best to think of a topic to start off with, but all he really wanted to talk about was what had happened earlier in the day.
“All stable, tests running, not even Ross could screw up,” Malfoy said as he slumped against the wall beside Harry. “Shall we meet up with the gruesome twosome before anything else happens?”
“As you can see, tonight is going to be a little different. Tonight isn't just about you and your partner, it's for everyone to talk about their experience over the past couple of days. I want you to talk to your fellow guests and see what has helped and even rant about parts you didn't appreciate. Most of all, though, tonight is about fun.”
The dinners with the Malfoy family hadn't been as bad as Harry had been expecting. High-bred manners had won out over Lucius' obvious distaste for Harry's relationship with Draco. Harry had already won over Narcissa; she thought that Harry was a 'charming young man' and a 'perfect companion for Draco'. Lucius, on the other hand, still needed quite a bit more work.
They're always here. I get up in the morning, and Hermione is popping in to see if I want to walk with her to work. Ron is owling me after work about the quidditch scores and asking for me out for a pint to discuss them. The Prophet is detailing the latest in the hunt for the rogue Death Eaters and my fellow Aurors are excited and making plans. Molly is popping in with food and details of her friend's single nieces and nephews. I spend too many evenings with her so I don't have to spend another bland evening with the simpering fools she tries to set me up with.
“Now, there are some small rules everyone needs to follow for this weekend to be a success. Remember, you are here because you have willingly asked for help.”
Exploding juice at breakfast, that was a winner. Potter had had to take his jumper off right there in the Great Hall.
I kept my mouth shut and listened, wanting to hear everything, but the questions burned inside me. I was hit with Avada Kedavra. I'd seen my fair share of those cast; it's not something you get up from. I should be dead.
The cheating git who Harry knew was still in the bloody shower. He never had listened to anything Harry said.
Even people who worked with him knew not to sneak up on Harry. They'd soon learnt after Draco had tried to pull a prank on him not long after they had started working together. It had taken weeks for his eyebrows to grow back. Harry thought he might have been more heartbroken than Draco; he liked those eyebrows. And the rest of him, but that was a different story.
The Avifugum charm was simple enough. I, of course, mastered it within minutes, but Potter wasn't far behind. It wasn't long before the entire classroom was filled with flying bits of paper, and it gave me the most marvellous idea.
“Right you are; sorry.” Malfoy cleared his throat. “So you now know I'm me; can you lower your wand so I can start again?”
They talked about inconsequential things during dinner: the latest gossip, whether or not they were going out on Friday, the weather. Once they had finished, Draco swooshed his wand, sending the dishes into the sink, and sat back in his chair.
“Now,” she said when they finally shut up, “Black Widow... on the other hand, she may have been trained, but it's all her. A strong, independent woman, holding her own in a sea of testosterone—and other assorted chemical and mechanical enhancements.”
Harry stifled another laugh as he noticed that the girls were all sat forward slightly, obviously desperate for any bit of gossip. Even Blaise and Ron had stopped talking about whatever it was they were talking about. Harry didn't know what Draco was going to say. Not that he minded; he hadn't  been shy about these things for a long time. Not since—
Harry just about managed to resist tackling Draco to the floor; the fact that they were both invisible had more than a little to do with his decision.
Looking around, counting with a slimy tentacle, Bob shook his bulbous head and sighed. “Has anyone got a clue as to where Hedwig and Darius are?”
“We went through every person in any way connected to you in fine detail; all hush-hush, of course. We could only find one person who wasn't cleared. The only one who acted in any way suspiciously was Helen.”
There was something more pressing that concerned Draco: hiding their night's activities from Glinda. So, as much as Draco would have loved to have a massive full English, he and Harry quickly grabbed some tea and toast and escaped back to their room before Glinda could talk to them. Luckily, they had one of the last morning sessions, and Draco hoped they had plenty of time to fully recover.
“Let's go back,” Glinda said after everyone had retaken their seats. “Draco, can you tell me why you disliked Harry when you first met?”
Draco almost smiled at her enthusiasm. He certainly would have done if he'd been an observer and not an unwilling participant.
A woman stepped forward to meet them, and if Draco had to pick just one word to describe her, well, he couldn't think of one. Overlarge pink glasses were perched on the end of her nose, clashing with the purple of her hair. Her robes appeared to have been made out of the old sofa that had been left in the house he'd bought, but Draco noticed the cut was tailored perfectly. The harsh set of her mouth didn't seem to fit with her warm, welcoming eyes.
Well, not until Ron unexpectedly tumbled out of his floo one night, spotting Draco and spouting hateful words. Harry wanted nothing more than to punch his best friend in the face.
Harry, obviously finished with the sparkles, came back into the room with a cup of tea and some biscuits. No dog biscuits, though. Dog definitely wanted Draco to come home soon. He hoped Draco had had a day from hell and was just looking for someone to take it out on. Dog pawed at the ribbon tied around his neck and barked at Harry. He deserved it.
“He just would've come back at a later time,” Draco assured him and Harry was shocked to realise that he had spoken aloud. “We'll just have to go out again tonight. And have less distractions.”
As everyone walked through the front doors and settled in the reception hall, Draco let his Auror side out and scoped out the others in the room. He had neither the time nor the inclination to learn names, so Draco relied on his old standby: his judgemental side.
Draco had come home with it a couple of years ago. Dog remembered it vividly. Draco had placed it (Bartholomew, sorry) in front of the fireplace and warned both Dog and Cat (not Owl, though; she got away with everything) that the first one to touch it would spend winter in the garden with only Harry to feed them.
Draco gasped aloud. His first thought was that Harry was taking the piss out of him, but he knew all of Harry's 'let's make fun of Draco' faces, and he wasn't using any of them.
The cheers of the crowd erupted around him, causing Harry to finally open his grip and take note of what had happened. He'd lost. After three hours of battling high wind and driving rain, he'd actually fucking lost.
When he had bounded into the café one morning after the holidays with a grin on his face, and told Pansy about the date he had with the bloke from the Quidditch shop, he ignored the look of horror on her face and the tears in her eyes; he was simply determined to make himself happy again.
Harry was confused. It was exactly what he'd been looking for; it was exactly what Harry had asked Zach to find for him. Why
At first, Harry thought that maybe Ron hadn't heard him correctly—the phone line was full of static, and Ron simply wouldn't stop shouting—but when the next letter arrived Harry's heart jumped. It was a small note, with Ron only saying how happy he was that Harry had found his own 'cuddle bunny' (Harry didn't need to know that much about his friends' relationship) and a small joke about Draco's name, which Harry expected (after all, he'd been joking about it since they were eleven, it would be strange for him to stop now).
Thinking about it, Draco realised that all of their problems were Kingsley's fault. If he and Potter were just left alone, they'd solve crimes quick as a flash and fight criminals happily side-by-side and then not see each other until the next call came in. It sounded like perfection.
Without Harry struggling, his makeover was done in half the time. His hair was looking newly-shagged—seriously, why didn't they just call it that on the bottle?—and his clothes once again 'brought out his eyes'. Harry was grateful for the lack of robes, though. He was much too nervous to be worrying about buttons.
“K'Nex!” he said happily, trying to pull Harry into the room. He found it impossible, however, as Harry was stood still in the doorway, gaping at him.
Harry woke up on Sunday morning with another pounding head and a need to know what the fuck was going on with Malfoy. They'd spent the night, again, drinking wine and talking. Malfoy, thankfully, bypassed the ins and outs of how he'd travelled in time, and instead had focussed on the major points of trying to get Harry into bed. It was exhausting.
“Shit.” Harry grabbed Draco's hand and took a step back. Harry looked at Draco, expecting a look of annoyance at Harry giving them away and was surprised to see a defiant look on Draco's face. Harry smiled before turning back to the advancing group.
“What the fuck are you smiling about, Malfoy? I know; bet you can't wait for the stupid course. A nice free holiday. What? The villa not free this weekend?”
“Nope. No more Muggles; I'm always petrified of accidentally telling them about us. I've been out with a couple of wizards; friends of friends who I could trust to keep quiet. But I've discovered that people don't want plain old Harry. They want this all-powerful wizard that doesn't actually exist.”
The silent treatment, turning his back on Draco in bed, refusing to listen to reason—all of it. Harry was like a child when he was in a mood. He would throw a tantrum—there was really no other word for it. He'd throw a tantrum over the silliest things.
Draco tried to tell himself that it was simply because they'd spent the last couple of days together non-stop, but he soon realised he was kidding himself.
Oh, crap; that made perfect sense. All that anger Harry had thrown at him during training, and ever  since. What the fuck?
What the fuck was he supposed to do without a wand? Who in their right mind expected a wizard, and a highly trained Auror at that, to just hand over their bloody wand? How was he supposed to defend himself? How was he supposed to perform spells? How the fuck was he supposed to unshrink his bloody clothes? No, there was nothing jaunty about those words, and Draco wanted to rip them to shreds. He knew that it wouldn't help, so instead he settled for—using his wand; Draco did love irony—changing the happy little scrawl to big block lettering.
“So,” Harry said, pouring the last of the whisky into their glasses, “have you got a boyfriend who is going to be pissed off that you've been to marriage counselling with another man?”
—wrote about their 'true love' and how it had conquered all. Harry was very surprised to walk into the café one morning to see
“I didn't write it. Well, I did. But a long time ago. Sit down,” he said, pulling a bottle of wine out of his bag. “I'll crack this open and I'll tell you all about it.”
“Honestly,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “One, I don't think it can be classified as spying when she is flaunting it for everyone to see, and two, I think she was just saying what she did because she needed an excuse to break up with you.”
Harry almost laughed at the easiness between the two of them. When they'd arrived back for the first day of school, the returning 'eighth year' students were given a list of room allocations along with a lecture on starting afresh. They were given promises that spells were in place that meant anything that happened in their rooms would stay there, and were encouraged to talk to one another without the threat of any gossip spreading throughout the school.
“Everything all right?” Draco asked when five minutes passed and Harry still hadn't written anything.
was what he needed. Harry lost himself in his arousal as Draco expertly licked and sucked and opened him up. Harry didn't know how in Merlin's name his legs were still holding him up, they felt as if they were made of jelly. Draco's hand reached around for Harry's cock, and Harry jerked. No! He wasn't ready to come. Not yet. Not until Draco was buried deep inside him.
Harry looked up. He was shocked to see the flash of amusement and the small quirk of Draco's lips. Feeling very confused, Harry tried to make sense of the situation. Unhelpfully, all Harry's muddled brain could supply was
“I knew I'd win.” Malfoy said silkily as he walked—no, sauntered—back to Harry, a tube of lube dangling from his fingers. “I knew I'd beat you. I knew I'd be having you right here. I knew I'd—”
“What?” Harry spluttered. “I didn't. Well, I did, but I didn't say anything. I knew how much danger it would put you in. I didn't.”
“You just did, but you can ask another.” Harry simply laughed at Draco's raised eyebrow. “Sorry, I couldn't resist.”
Luna was adamant. She told me outright that she wanted me at her birthday party. So I went. I saw you and again couldn't bring myself to talk to you.
“Well, you don't have to.” Harry didn't know what else to say; Draco had never seemed averse to holidays before. “I'm not going to force you.”
The dates were lovely enough; he had good food, nice wine and some fascinating conversation. He even laughed with a few of them. But there was no spark, no passion. And after being married to someone who fitted better as a friend for so many years, Harry wanted—
Once the food was cleared away, Glinda clapped her hands and a small band of house-elves appeared to rearrange the furniture. The large table was taken away, and smaller groups of tables were dotted around the edge of what appeared to be some sort of dance floor. Draco was horrified. Dancing? Unless it was in a steamy club filled with sweaty men, Draco didn't want to know.
Harry was well aware of the fact that he was hiding. Two days had passed and he hadn't seen a soul other than Brewin. Draco had followed Harry's instructions and hadn't turned up, unexpectedly or otherwise. Harry didn't know if Draco had tried to send him an owl, as he'd refused to open the window, not even when it was Hermione's owl tapping on the glass with his beak.
Harry also knew that it wasn't just Draco at fault. He had started it all, of course, but Harry had finished it. He'd fallen into bed with Draco; he hadn't been forced. He kept it a secret. He continued the charade.
Instead of enjoying our last summer before we started our various training or work placements and became 'proper' adults, we were besieged by the press and the gossiping hoards. We couldn't get so much as an ice cream without someone taking a picture or calling our names. I expected Harry to receive a lot of attention, with him being the Saviour and all, but what the buggering fuck did they want with me?
“That's me. I wrote that book, and all the others in the series. I'm Joshua Starkweather and I write erotic fiction. Well, it's not so much fiction as it's mainly inspired by us. Erotic novels, porn, whatever you want to call it—”
“But,” Draco added, picking Dog up. “No dog of mine is walking around wearing this,” he said, fingering the bow around his neck.
Some of the more disreputable newspapers and magazines published a couple of rather unflattering rumours about how their relationship had started. There was talk of it just being a 'publicity stunt', and even a few murmurs of something dark that the Malfoy family has orchestrated. Harry took great delight in returning their owls with a few choice words written by his
He hadn't—to his eternal surprise—missed using magic while he'd been at the retreat. He missed the comforting presence of his wand, but he hadn't needed to make that many changes in order to function without it.
“Uh-huh.” Draco caught his breath. “Just think, if you didn't want to spend the night dancing like a chicken, we could have done this hours ago.”
Harry and Draco had talked for hours about the two acts of vandalism. Draco had insisted that it wasn't just kids, and that Harry should put his Auror training to use and find the culprit. He had told Harry that he had no faith in the Muggle policemen and Harry should 'save his holiday'. Yeah, Harry was pretty sure that Draco was drunk as well.
I was shocked. I knew Harry was working on a big case, but I had no idea that the case was me. And for him to use his status like that—it was unheard of.
“Watch your paws,” Harry said quickly, picking Dog up and plopping him on the sofa. “I'll clean this up. Merlin, Draco is going to kill me.”
“Pansy!” he cried on seeing his friend sitting at the counter, flipping through a magazine. “What are you doing here?”
Harry enjoyed their day at the beach immensely. Draco, as promised, topped up his sunscreen by hand; Harry had stilled Draco's hand and applied the cream himself to his
“Only joking, Lilypops,” Harry said, resisting the urge to ruffle her hair. “You look absolutely beautiful. Now, where are your brothers? Hope they're behaving themselves.”
“Miss Howard,” Professor McGonagall said loudly, “please escort Mr Smith to the infirmary; I will be along presently to deal with him. Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy, please could you join me in my office once you have finished eating?”
Draco's hands gripped tighter in his hair, and Harry moved a hand from Draco's hip to play with his balls. As he rolled them in his hand, Harry thought is simply couldn't get better than this. He was wrong.
Harry looked warily at the other holidaymakers and had to stop himself shouting at them to remember their towels.
Draco hastily swallowed the bit of pastry he had bitten off. “I’d love to,” he answered. “Where do you want to go?”
Except that. Fuck. Why did he have to get pissed and tell Pansy all about his crush on Draco bloody Malfoy? Harry mentally kicked himself as he nearly opened the bedroom door.
Draco obviously had the same idea as Harry, as he started to climb onto the bed. Harry allowed himself to be pushed back onto the bed as Draco climbed on top of him and leant down to kiss him once more.
“Ladies and gentlemen, please go inside and help yourself to tea, coffee and breakfast,” the booming voice of the manager sounded. “I'll have this cleared up. It's more than likely just some local children playing a joke.”
Harry had had to sit down as the thought hit him. He had a date with Draco Malfoy. And, more than likely, Pansy—and by extension, Hermione and Ginny—would know every single thing about it by the next day. Who knew that Draco was such a blabbermouth?
The Charm I was most proud of, one that I'd invented all on my own, was to be my downfall. Whenever Potter would say my name, his trousers would drop to the floor. It was, quite frankly, brilliant. He'd pass me in the hall, say my name and he'd show his pants to the world. Every single time. The best part was, because I'd discovered it myself, Granger couldn't counteract it. I'm sure one of the teachers could've done so, but I hoped Potter would be too embarrassed to go to them.
Hedwig shook her head. Fuck it. She was going to enjoy it. It worked, whether she'd been involved or not.
Skidding to a halt around the corner, Harry smiled at the secretary, accepted her greeting, and opened the door to Draco's office. Draco wasn't sitting there. Any other time, Harry would be ecstatic to see her, but not then. Harry was getting mightily pissed off with ending up with the wrong people turning up.
Harry's earlier thoughts of Apparating somewhere else came back to the front of his mind at the sight of three of his best friends and their instruments of torture. The looks on their faces didn't help as they advanced into his bedroom and pushed him into the chair beside the desk.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked. “We seem to be making progress, and Draco hasn't had a chance to talk.”
Bob actually looked slightly uneasy. “I don't know,” he admitted finally. “I just know that it is imperative that Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter end all animosity and become friendly, and the sooner, the better.”
It reminded Draco of the feasts they'd had on special occasions in school. On a much smaller scale, obviously, but the atmosphere, the joviality and, most of all, the delicious platters of food made him look to Harry and smile, receiving a wide grin in return.
Harry's back was rubbing against the cold wood of the floor, but he didn't care. He simply writhed and thrashed on the floor until he finally came with a groan, covering his hand and spurting onto his chest. Draco moaned as Harry's arse spasmed; moments later, he too came with a shout before collapsing on top of Harry.
The bottle of wine—and another one from the wine rack—disappeared as Harry listened to Malfoy explain, but he wasn't really
A groan from Grumpy Waiter caused Harry to step forward at the same time as Draco. Bloody stupid saving-people-thing. Hermione would have a field day.
Harry found him at the kitchen table, stiff backed and holding that infernal book, crossed wands front and centre. Harry sat down and grabbed Draco's cup of tea, gulping it down. It was cold.
“Come on, let's go to your room,” Draco said, showing Harry the bottle he'd brought from the table. “I've had enough of this.”
Harry nodded, smiled and accepted the glass of red that Tom offered. Grateful for his friends finally listening to him, he went to sit at their usual table, which was currently cordoned off with a grimy old piece of rope and a hand-written reserved sign.
“Gay. Me. Maybe. Men kissing men kind of gay. Not the happy kind. Although I am happy. Do people still use gay for happy? Maybe I watch too many old films. Anyway, I—”
Ah, Harry remembered why he kept Pansy around. Efficient was her middle name. Well, it was actually Elladora, but you didn't mention that if you liked your balls where they were supposed to be.
“All right, mate, leave him to wake up a minute,” Weasley said, guiding Harry into a chair. I hadn't even noticed him in the room. “And less of that,” he said, accusingly, as Harry started dotting kisses up my arm.
It turned out to be one of the nicest mornings Harry had had in a while. After the four of them had ironed out the 'small misunderstanding', Harry was grateful to just have his friends back.
Hogwarts was the same boring place it had been before the war. The classes were long, homework was tedious, and the Quidditch was marvellous. I know people didn't think I deserved my place on the team—they were vocal enough about it—but I knew that I'd damn well earned my spot. My father didn't buy those brooms years ago to get me on the team—he bought them
Draco, and had seen first-hand what a complete prat he had been in school. It was his—and Granger's—opinion that mattered most to Harry and he was aghast to realise that it meant something to him, too.
It had been weeks since her and Ron's not-so-triumphant return home, and things with Harry were almost back to normal. They saw him a couple of times a week for dinner or drinks. Harry and Draco were ever present for the Sunday roast at the Burrow. Her and Ron had even sat through a few evenings at Harry's, watching he and Draco acting like an old married couple.
Harry blushed, and Draco was sure he saw a flash of relief cross his face. “Um, I was going to say, 'I want you...to know that I don't hate you'.”
It had taken Draco a long time—and manoeuvres that only he could perform—to calm Harry down after Ron had left. Draco had managed to wrestle Harry's wand away from him after Ron and Hermione's faces had popped into the floo a couple of hours later, and Harry had attempted to blast the fireplace into tiny pieces.
I caught sight of you sitting in the corner on your own. I don't know why I hesitated. I don't know what drew me to you, but it did, Maybe it was the booze, maybe it was the wanting to do something different. I don't know. I just know I couldn't help it, so I bought two pints and plopped them in front of you.
Looking in the mirror, Harry adjusted his bow tie and had to resist pinching himself. It had to be a dream. He couldn't be marrying the love of his life in just over an hour.
It may have only been a charity match,  in aid of some charity Hermione had badgered him about for weeks, but he still wanted—
“You see what I have to put up with?” Harry asked Glinda. “And yes, yesterday you weren't being a twat and blaming everything on me. I was trying, all right?”
“—just a couple, but they are very important for everybody's enjoyment and safety.” Tony finished his talk with a smile. Harry tried to smile back.
They always need something. I want to help, but I can't do everything. I don't want to do everything. I want to be me.
Draco had then fallen artlessly to his knees, the submissiveness of the gesture lost in the sure way he pinned Harry to the wall, the flash of nails as he ran his hands down Harry’s thighs.  His tongue was mischievous and eager as he worked Harry into a shudder.
That expression, paired with his use of Draco’s given name were enough to warm him to the banter.  “And what an
[At this point, HARRY has most of his gingerbread Weasleys in position across his winter landscape, complete with fiery icing hair and each of their distinctive fashions.  CEDRIC’s is nearly finished as well, and he spends his remaining time icing snow onto his multi-tiered ginger pine trees.  DRACO, however, is nowhere near finished and cements his gingerbread cathedral together at a dizzying pace.  His stress is almost palpable, and we see HARRY glancing back at him at frequent intervals, seeming almost like he’s hesitating to speak.]
They both collapsed against the lockers in the aftermath – Draco bracing himself with both hands to stay upright while Harry slid gracelessly to his knees, boneless.
Ron pursed his lips and leaned against the door frame.  “I’m pretty sure those are for your thumbs, mate.”
The morning before the Ball, his mother stopped by on a “social visit” – though Draco suspected it had everything to do with interrogating him about his party plans and nothing to do with the “sudden urge to see him” she feigned as her primary motivation.  After an interminable sentence to tea, she finally left, making him promise to come by in the morning with news – which proved his theory quite nicely.
“You would?” Harry asked, sounding shocked.  This was what Draco had been afraid of – Harry misinterpreting Draco’s frustration over their own miscommunications as apathy for Sam’s predicament.
Potter since the trials, and he certainly hadn’t been a part of his life, like he’d naively believed in school he always would.  Back then, their rivalry seemed so large, so
the fact that he’d missed out on his chance for a dramatic late entrance.  And from the kids’ mutterings, it appeared that he’d also heard about the scrimmage promises Draco had tossed out last week when he’d been annoyed Potter was ignoring him.
The man worked him open steadily, saying nothing if he thought it odd that Draco was too tight and jumpy for someone who claimed to have done this before.  When he deemed him loose enough, he lined his cock up, and Draco fought the urge to eat his previous words and leave.
“Right,” Draco concluded.  “I think this interview should wait until you’ve thought through your questions a little more.”  He turned to the cashier, who was so engaged in watching that she flinched as the attention shifted to her and forced her from her spectatorship.  “I’m sorry Miss, how much was it that I owed you?”
Potter’s cheeks stained red at that, and Draco drew himself up from the doorframe so he could look down at the man for a closer look.  “I have to ask – and you can be honest, Potter,” he said.  “Are you
When he opened his eyes, Potter was scanning the room furiously, as if hoping amongst hopes that someone else would notice the scandalous performance that had unhinged him so thoroughly.  But no such luck – Draco was a Slytherin; he was nothing if not subtle.  He’d chosen his timing well.
“Can we please please please do the relay race thing again?” one little boy asked, and Draco felt himself melting at the excitement in his tone.
had nearly concussed him with a quaffle.  Fenn and Marla were staging some sort of coup at the goalposts, while Kyle, a weedy-looking fifth-year chaser, had given up the rules and snatched the snitch.
She breathed out a sigh, twirling her glass subtly in her grip.  “Not particularly.  And by that, I mean that everyone who was here three years ago has bad stories that they can tell.  Mine is not especially unique.”
VOLDEMORT: [reluctantly] Yes, this is one of the best gingerbreads I’ve had the pleasure to encounter.  [He eyes the mini Cho and Cedric and seems put out that MINERVA made him try a tree instead.]  And the decoration is well-executed, though it is too cutesy for my tastes.
More than anything, he hated that Potter was seeing him like this - reduced to nothing, in a place where money and influence couldn’t save him, and chained to a
It wasn’t like the wand changed things – not really.  He was still unemployable, he still had no home to return to, and he still hadn’t gotten any closer to unraveling the knot of feelings in his chest about finding love with a boy.  Ultimately, he was the same mess of a person he’d always been.
.  But now it was out there, and Harry’s eyes were widening in injured disillusionment before Draco’s very eyes.
“Well,” she said, “when you told us…I mean, I wasn’t sure what to expect regarding how you’d act around one another.  But now I’m seeing it’s not dissimilar from how you’ve always acted.”
“…Hey,” Malfoy said in return, responding like a normal fucking human being; though, he was analyzing Harry with a sharp gaze that was more intense than perhaps casually appropriate.
That was fine.  The whole night was muddled in a rosy, euphoric haze, and Draco needed time to process everything – he’d meant what he’d thought yesterday, that there would be time enough to explore each other; there was no sense in getting it “over with” in the space of a single night.
, and anyone that listened to him was mental.  As it was, he could merely clench his jaw harder and dig his nails deeper into the armrests.
Harry’s eyes flew open, and then he was coming – coming hard and jerkily over the expanse of Draco’s knuckles.  He crumpled against Draco’s body, face buried in his neck, and Draco held him with the epiphany that this was the first time he’d felt so at peace.
But their diviner, Google, was a fickle and mysterious fiend.  It remained silent, even as the pleas grew louder and more desperate.
[Overlaid above the drama now melting into slow motion, we hear FRED’s regretful tone announcing: ‘And the one leaving us this week is…(an interminable pause)…Seamus.  I’m sorry buddy.’  The Irishman sobs into Fred’s shoulder before exchanging a swift, awkward hug with both VOLDEMORT and MINERVA.  The rest of the contestants join a group hug, save ARGUS FILCH and SEVERUS SNAPE – the only two yet to smile with the typical excitement contestants feel upon entering the tent.]
Draco didn’t have to guess to know what word he’d censored.  He slung an arm around Harry and pulled him into his side, exhaling as Harry relaxed against his shoulder.
Draco spun him around gently, noting the unbridled lust gleaming in his eyes.  It was a powerful force, this lust, like something that would draw in anything around it to devour.
Harry grabbed at Draco’s shoulders for support, and Draco smirked at his flattering instability.  He continued working Harry’s dick, turned on all over again by the little breathy moans the man was making against his neck and the clench of his grip that accompanied them.
He glanced expectantly at Draco, who was mostly just trying not to choke on the leg of lamb he was holding.  “Er…pardon?”
Not that it mattered that he’d made it up the stairs.  He didn’t have a wand to fix himself, and he’d gotten by so far only by avoiding the worst of the clashes.  Draco was lucky, he was
In an instant, Draco realized what this must be about, just as he realized he didn’t have any good advice to give.  He’d heard of this – seen mentions in books, mostly – but he had never really dedicated much thought beyond the fact that it existed and didn’t apply to him; he’d steered towards learning more about being

– to see what he would do next.  He dropped his voice lower and continued.  “But you should know, you can never win by using my own tricks against me.”
Frankly, it was pitiful that he’d tired of his freedom already.  He’d railed so hard against his father for so long that he’d thought he would feel better after the culminating disownment earlier this month.
“It’s fine – later.  We have all day.”  And Draco found that he meant it, too.  The clawing urgency of his arousal had faded into the maelstrom, and he let his body settle deeper into the mattress.
Grant pulled his wand from a belt holster, and Draco felt a surge of jealousy so sharp and sudden that he nearly staggered from it.
MINERVA: The family members are all very well done though.  I can easily pick out Molly on the sidelines of the pond, and Fred and George throwing snowballs at their elder brother.  [She points at the scowling, bespectacled ‘Percy.’]  Overall, a very clever scene with a lot going on.  It just looks like you missed a chance to touch it up at the end.
But the discomfort was matched only by his hollowness; his eyes were flat and empty in the mirror before him, and he decided that if it was terrible, at least it would be over soon.  Then, he could say he’d
Draco preened as Potter’s eyes looked him up and down, eyes sticking definitively below his waist, and he jutted a hip out to lean sensually against the lockers.  There was no mistaking the interest in those eyes now.
By the time Harry stumbled into the Great Hall for breakfast, Draco had managed to calm down with a cup of tea.  He’d thrown away the article from his father, and – though one of the school’s owls had delivered him his usual copy of the
Draco hadn’t meant to land behind Potter and start an argument – he really hadn’t – but there was something about the ex-hero’s self-pitying body language that drew him there and made him do just that.
something to me.”  He held something up in the air that took Draco a moment to recognize – but once he did, it became imperative that they discuss the contents somewhere else.
Harry chugged the rest of his drink, slamming the stein down onto the table when he finished.  “Let’s do this,” he ground out.
The tension eased as Draco felt the smugness worm its way back across his face.  “She did, didn’t she?”
But Potter was cold to his attempt.  “No,” he said one final time, shoving Draco back so he could shut the door.
dead – if anything, the long shadows of the room were dragging him down to darker times; the cabinet in front of him now loomed like a different cabinet he had spent so much time overshadowed by.
“Potter,” he repeated, voice low and throaty.  It cracked over his next words too, in which all he could manage was, “What are you doing?”
Which is how he found himself at The White Wyvern that Friday night, having had only enough motivation to sneak out of the Miscellany to be wretched somewhere else.  It was one of the only times he’d left the store – other than a few midnight walks spread through the months, when he thought he’d actually go insane if he didn’t.  And it was his first time entering a pub since the war.
But he had told Draco he was going.  And Potter didn’t lie – it was one of those things that made him as stupid as he was charming.  So he was bound to be there.
him and talking to Neville.  Merlin, he never should have teased Harry about watching him too intently; he missed the hot gaze following him across the pitch.
Merlin, Harry was a dead weight on his arm.  He must have been seriously messed up to trust Draco to lead him out.
But he was at his absolute threshold with Morpheus’ Miscellany at this point – and he also had nothing to lose.
what Harry liked now.  That was a crazier notion than anything he could’ve dreamed.  To know what he looked like, eyes clouded with sheer unrepentant
And then he was in.  He fought down his nausea at the sickening familiarity of the feeling, how Aunt Bella had drilled the lessons into him – again and again – until he slowly made some progress.
Draco looked away.  He wasn’t quite brave enough to face all of Harry’s emotions laid bare – they mirrored his own too well.  “Mother…didn’t agree.  But ultimately, she is not in charge of our estate.”  He took a sip of his butterbeer.  “You see, this is why the disinheritance they mentioned in the papers didn’t affect me so much.  That news is nearly a year old; the
Mother strode, stiff-backed, to the front desk and checked them in.  The wizard there eyed them warily, but confirmed their appointment for three.  Draco took a step forward, thinking they were done.
Bagman brushed away his words with an air of false offense, “Sir?  None of this ‘sir’ nonsense, Draco, my boy!  We’re all
Harry’s mouth worked silently for several seconds before he seemed to find what he wanted to say.  And once he had, Draco wished –
Jameson shot after him a second later, but by then, it was too late.  Draco raised the snitch above his head in triumph, forgoing his customary nod to Bagman in the ecstasy of the moment.
going to be complicated, Draco.  Not for you, not for me, and certainly not for both of us together.  That doesn’t mean we can’t find new paths and comforts in the aftermath.”  Finally, he brushed his knuckles down Draco’s cheek, signaling that he was done, and Draco could feel himself crumbling under the caress.
She must have read the thoughts off his face, because her next comment was earnest.  “Draco.  While your father may wish to argue and antagonize regarding your recent decisions,
Harry, still blessedly sleep-wrinkled, ruffled his hair with a hand and considered it.  “Oh – that’s right.  Some of my fourth-year students were able to produce a partial
an office.  After long thought, he scrawled an “office hours” sheet to pin up outside his door.  He hesitated before actually writing the hours in, as he figured he’d have time to figure that out yet - and, besides, who wanted to consult the Quidditch coach about matters needing an office space?  He sighed self-deprecatingly; it was an unlikely scenario to begin with.
While Potter whipped his head side to side, examining each of the pitch-black rooms as they passed, Draco spent his time examining
“Oh, spare me the bullshit, Morpheus!”  Draco’s voice was sharp with venom.  “You got a servant out of the deal.  Someone to brew all your merchandise and bite their tongue at your astounding lack of knowledge.  Everyone knows you’re a piss-poor Potions master, and they like my potions better – admit it!  I heard Madam Wilkinson saying they’d improved significantly just the other day!”
He was shoved through the doorway and tumbled messily down the stairs.  At the bottom, he shot to his feet, unable to feel the bruises he knew would bloom overnight – if he made it until tomorrow.
Looking closer, he was fairly certain they were seventh-year Hufflepuffs.  Far too straightforward for their own good.
am here to do neither.  While I don’t expect to be thanked for this, I do expect you to at least act civilly and endure a few questions over tea.”  Her cup clicked back into her saucer, punctuating the sentence.  Her eyes stay trained on his for a long moment before flicking back to Harry and politely demanding, “Have a seat, dear.”
The man’s head snapped up, and after searching his face for a beat, he mercifully broke into a tentative grin that showed he would play along without comment.  “That’s ‘

GEORGE: While our contestants get their bearings, we’d like to introduce a little segment that we’ve never had on our show before: highlights and former contestant recaps!
So since I've been terrible about upkeeping my regular schedule for this fic, I've decided to do you a solid and post this chapter a week early 😂  (Please don't abandon it - I swear I'm going to finish it on a [somewhat] consistent timeline!)
Which was when he streaked to the opposite side of the pitch, bringing the Green Flash to its full speed with only the merest twitch of intention.
Yes, he missed his mother.  But his father – whom he was currently hiding from – was enough to keep him away.  She knew it too, he thought, by the way she glanced wistfully at him in the mirror.
,” he pointed manically at October 31st – holding the paper close to Potter’s nose – where it read: “
For a long moment, Harry did nothing – and Draco began to panic that he had thought better of this whole affair.  Either that, or he wasn’t as into men as he must’ve thought.
Harry set his jaw and pushed his way into Potions class.  A collective gasp went through the students already in the classroom – and a very startled Slughorn, who was now desperately trying to fish out the dragonfly wing he’d dropped into his cauldron in shock.
Regardless, it felt wonderful to turn his back on the thin line he’d been walking between showing interest and defensively retreating.  He could brush his leg against Harry’s under the table and know that it was welcome.  He could look into his eyes and release that idiotic grin that he’d been prone to since this morning’s desperate kiss.
“Huh?” he uttered, his mind catching on the nightmares as he looked at the bed himself.  In one, Harry had even kissed him back before revealing that things would never work.  “No.”
Draco bit back a chuckle at how carefree Harry was, here in this nostalgic place.  He was so open and
Harry hung his head and tried not to combust from embarrassment.  “But it’s so…stripey.  And the sleeves have these weird holes in them!  Like, what are these even for?”
For the first time that day, he wished he could break the silencing charm on him and speak up.  Tell them that Potter was an
She answered as such – amused, like she was just indulging him, despite being the one who had asked.  “I imagine.  Though I have full faith that you’re doing a wonderful job.”
The room was the size of a small stadium, walls stretching abnormally in the magically-enhanced space.  Players whizzed by overhead, and a cheer went up, directing Draco’s eyes to the hundreds of people watching – sloshing drinks and yelling over the noise.
”  Draco paused in the act of pouring himself a drink.  He set the firewhisky he’d summoned back on the table with a snap.
Ron clapped him on his shoulder, sending him stumbling into the sink.  “Good man – now let’s get out there!”
She nodded, impatient.  “Yeah, I know.  But it’s not what I want to be.  I feel…weird when I’m grouped with the girls.  That’s why I like Kat – it’s like she’s outside all of that, too.”
Which was really…quite a bit more transparent than Harry had clearly intended.  Draco glowed a bit with pleasant embarrassment.
was making a reappearance in his eyes.  But now that he’d brought it up, he felt strangely unable to stop.  Like this indignation welling within him was just as ripe and pressing as the moment it had been conceived four years ago.
Fawkes disappeared in a flash of flame. Lucky git, Bob thought. Looking around the group, Bob made a decision which would surely please everyone.
My friends were equally unsurprised. I was perfectly unaware that I, too, hadn't stopped talking about Harry. My mother replied to my letter telling her about my new relationship quicker than I thought possible, pleased that I was enjoying school and had found someone to make me happy. She added an invitation for Harry to join us for dinner the following weekend, and a little note to 'watch out for each other'.
“For reasons you need not know, Professor Dumbledore thought that it was time for the school to unite and for that, he needed Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy to become friendly. It couldn't have gone better. I commend you on your marvellous work.”
Bloody hell. Did she ever think the guilt trip was going to work? Yes, it worked years ago, when Harry
“If you'd won, we'd be having sex in the bloody Minister's office, and I would have done it without question. Even though I have to work there, and I'd be thinking about fucking you every time I had a meeting in there.”
Draco helped Harry stagger to his feet and half-carried him to his room, waving off the staff who came over to see what the problem was. Once Harry had opened the door, he hobbled over to the bed and flopped down, wincing as he did so.
“Well, it is wine o'clock,” Harry said before wincing. “Nope, that's just bad. This way,” he added, ushering Draco into the kitchen.
Zach looked at their still-joined hands, and nodded. “I think I will. Nice to see you, Harry. Fire-call me!”
Before I could think any more, the door opened and a rather ashamed, and a little upset, looking Potter shuffled in. I could feel my cheeks redden even before Potter opened his mouth. I ran over the words I was going to say in my head.
Harry barely registered the thunk of the belt hitting his floor, as Draco had moved on to undoing his trousers. Harry's lip darted out to wet his suddenly dry lips as Draco's zip was lowered and the trousers fell to the floor with a simple wiggle of Draco's hips.
Glinda looked slightly taken aback at the vehement response and Draco felt strangely guilty for it. “What's the problem?” she asked.
But appearances, as Draco had been repeatedly told, were deceptive. Beauty and Bear's elaborate vehicle lost a wheel halfway down the ramp. Giant and Mouse's enormous offering dropped their egg and was therefore disqualified. Ten and One's creation veered terribly to the right, crashing into the wall and causing another round of insults between the two. But Grumpy and Frumpy's car wasn't only well adorned, it was well-built. It flew down the ramp and drove straight for a good ten feet.
, but soon they were inundated with requests for quotes or interviews from every newspaper in print. Harry and Draco refused adamantly, but that didn't stop the daily barrage of owls, or the articles.
In fact, Ron even invited them to the match the following day, and Hermione asked them to meet her for dinner afterwards. Harry was back to thinking that he had the best friends a guy could ask for.
“Need what?” Draco blurted out without thinking. He hated showing himself up. Especially in front of his boss and Potter.
Draco shook his head. “No, I'm just here until tomorrow. I had to make some reports in person. I have to close up the Zagreb stuff before I move on.”
“What the hell is going on?” Harry muttered, finally finding his feet and walking over to the damage.
Harry had been enjoying their conversation so much that he had completely forgotten that both he and Malfoy were naked. Harry found he didn't care.
“We've found that alcohol,” Glinda said when Draco asked her for a whisky, “is counter-productive to the work we do here. All alcohol is forbidden at Holding Hands. We do have a wide selection of fruit juices,” she added with a smile. “What would you like?”
Harry's usual rebuttal of 'it was one time!' was lost in the crack of Apparition. They arrived outside the house to find Zach sitting on the doorstep, bag of takeaway in one hand, and bottle of wine in the other.
All thoughts of a nap flew from Dog's mind as he pondered the possibilities. Harry was always so easy to torment, but with the added pressure of the sparkles, it was going to be awesome. Dog's tail wagged happily and he barely even noticed. It was time to have some fun.
“Come on,” Draco insisted, sitting down. “It's nothing I haven't seen before. And I can't heal it without looking at it.”
The evening was going fabulously; the drinks were flowing and laughter echoed around the small pub. One thing was missing though, apart from Draco: presents.
Harry could tell the woman thought she wouldn't be making a huge sale with him; the way she resolutely looked at her computer screen instead whenever Harry tried to make eye contact was clear enough, but her conversation with her colleague on '
Harry did as he was asked and followed his fellow guests into the dining room. Looking over their faces, Harry was saddened to see the looks of upset and worry. Harry had to wonder who would do such a thing. Naturists weren't perverts; quite the opposite actually. Naturism was about embracing the natural state and enjoying the freedom to be without clothes if one so wished—not as a way of leering at the other guests.
Zach smiled. “Whenever you are. Hey, can I stay here tonight? I don't fancy going all the way back home.”
“They are some bloody awful bushes,” Harry suddenly said, jerking his head in the direction of the window to the garden. “And the smell...”
“Glinda would be horrified.” Draco grabbed two plastic beakers off the sideboard. “But I do like being counter-productive.”
The tiny owl gulped and took a minute step back. “Invisibility cloak... Ron sent me to... I couldn't... Harry.... he...”
Ron must have noticed as well as he smacked him in the arm. “What's up with you? Surely you've seen these two at it before? You got a problem with it?”
“I'm so sorry! You'd better go home and get your suit seen to,” Draco said. “You'd don't want it to ruin. You know spells won't help with wine stains.”
Harry did think about asking Draco to simply forget everything and try to get back to the way it had been before, but he couldn't do it. It was simple. He'd had a taste of Draco, and he wanted more.
Draco fully expected to walk into the bar to drunken laughter and games. He did not expect to see people sitting around, drinking juice and playing cards.
“It was a defence mechanism. We become closer as a partnership and I learned to trust you to have my back, but I still didn't
Draco walked towards him and put his arms around him. Despite what he was about to say, Harry let him. He needed to feel Draco against him, especially if it was going to be the last time. As Draco moved in for a kiss, though, Harry pulled back.
The war ended in May. I won't go into details—you all know the story. Good guys prevailed, bad guys failed. Main bad guy died and main good guy stood victorious. After the dust had settled, the wizarding world was in a quandary. Certainly, most of the decisions were simple. Pin medals and bestow awards on the good guys (well, deserved, don't get me wrong), and throw the bad guys in prison (also well deserved; sorry Father).
The second day, I woke late. Why Blaise didn't wake me, I'll never know, but I had ten minutes to make the choice between facing the stares at breakfast or face Charms on an empty stomach. Walking into the common room, my mind was made up immediately.
“You, too,” Hermione replied, accepting the kiss on her cheek. “Now, go and talk to Pansy. You're going to need someone to look after the shop. I'll arrange the Portkey.”
Harry had only just finished his tea when the front door slammed (and one of the Quidditch posts fell over) and Draco came in. Dog jumped up from his place on the forbidden sofa, barely able to conceal his excitement.
“And I saw them after lunch.” Crookshanks couldn't look Hedwig in the eye as she spoke; she felt bad, but reports needed to be made. “They were having an... argument behind Greenhouse Three.”
As soon as Harry turned back to the boxes, Dog put his evil plan into action. Moving quicker than if Draco had appeared with a steak, Dog jumped at the tree. Taking a spiky branch in his mouth, Dog wriggled the heavy tree until it toppled over.
Hedwig and Darius breathed a sigh of relief. Bob looked doubtful, which meant they were probably off the hook.
“It's all right,” Harry said from beside him. “We're one of the first here. And it doesn't look like anyone has had the lasagne yet. Why don't you have that?”
“Well, I'm no expert,” Harry answered with a laugh, “but I think I remember watching a film once.  I'm pretty sure it involves boredom and doughnuts.”
“Don't call them that. It pleases Ron too much,” Harry said, smiling for the first time that morning. “Let's go.”
“I heard Harry calling for me; maybe he wants me to deliver something. Let's just hope it's not another bloody missive about how Draco's evil or something.”
While the sale of Grimmauld Place was still ongoing, Harry kept up the search for a new house. Harry had asked Draco for help, but Draco had insisted that it was Harry's choice alone. Harry had almost asked him to buy a new house together, but—after discussion with
“Why don't you tell them how you concocted your little plan? How you asked Harry if you could stay in the spare room? How you climbed, naked, into
“Sorry; you know what I'm like when I'm under stress. Stupid jokes and rambling. I can't help it. Hermione says it's from being a writer, but I think she's talking out of her arse. See, here I go again.”
After they'd eaten, and Harry had once again cleared up, Harry pulled Draco close to him. “Do the honours?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “They got waylaid by my mum, fussing over something or other. If they're not here soon, I'll go and rescue them.”
Harry looked up from his musing at Pansy's words. They were in the café, trying to come up with new ways to get Draco to understand.
“And what a pretty dress it is,” Ron said, twirling her. Having his own little girl had brought out the best in Ron. Now he was as comfortable with ribbons as he was with broomsticks.
“What?” Harry said once he'd regained the ability to speak. He completely ignored the pool of tea spreading over the floor.
Harry and Draco both kissed her cheeks before leaving hand-in-hand. “So, the steps of the Ministry?” Draco asked with a wink.
“No, not like that,” Glinda said, as nobody moved away from their partners. “One partner in each of the teams. We're going on a treasure hunt!”
I was happily munching on my toast that breakfast time—and sneaking glances of Harry's smiling face—when a unearthly growl came from the other end of the Gryffindor table. Ginny (there were too many Weasleys; it was just easier to use her name), red-faced and extremely angry looking had jumped up from her seat, marched straight over to the Hufflepuff table and slapped Zacharias Smith right across the face. Even without knowing the reasons behind the slap, it looked absolutely brilliant.
“Okay, okay. Calm down.” Ron shook him gently by the shoulders. “You're going to be fine. Even though I'm not why sure Malfoy makes you happy, but he does, so it's going to be fine. You're going to have a fantastic wedding and then go off and do whatever you two do that makes you grin like an idiot for three days.”
The war is over and Draco has someone he wants to talk to. There's something he needs to say. A remix of
Harry, after thinking about it for a long time, didn't give a flying fuck what the wider wizarding world thought of his coming out. As Harry should have suspected, Hermione was right once again, and the only change with the papers was rather than every woman he was pictured with being his new love interest, now it was every person (and once a centaur). Speculation didn't bother Harry, so he ignored it and went about his life.
Turning around quickly, he spotted me. Unluckily, or so I thought initially, I was alone, being the only one of my friends to be taking Transfiguration. I was soon pretty grateful for my friends' absence as Weasley started talking.
Harry passed his Auror exams without a problem—not that anyone expected him to fail—and I soon worked my way up the ladder, becoming the youngest Under-secretary to the Under-secretary for the Floo Network in history. Well, according to Granger anyway. I simply revelled in having a job I loved, friends and family that I could count on and a boyfriend who I couldn't imagine life without.
At half five precisely, Harry closed the café and was immediately Apparated away by three very eager women. He hadn't even seen Hermione and Ginny arrive, but they must have been waiting outside the shop to ambush him. Why they were so excited to dress him up, he'd never know.
Thoughts of Draco, and the belt, made Harry open the door before that could happen. Harry groaned as he caught sight his three favourite women. Hermione was holding up a three-piece suit, the colour of which he had been repeatedly told 'brought out his eyes'. Ginny had a set of expensive looking robes slung over her arm; Harry was slightly scared of the number of buttons along the front. Pansy was brandishing her wand, a hairbrush and a bottle of green goo. The bottle had a picture of a witch with long sleek locks on the side. Harry was petrified.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, wrapping himself more securely in Draco's arms. “I thought you had to work late.”
“Harry?” I choked out, trying my best to raise my head from the pillow, but not quite succeeding. “Am I dead?”
Molly had persuaded Ron and Ginny to go to the Burrow for dinner, and Pansy and Blaise had dates, so Harry and Zach were putting the finishing touches to the dining room alone. Harry was expecting a call from Draco, so he put his paintbrush down and went to clean himself up. He had promised to meet Ron in the pub after he'd finished dinner and Harry didn't want to turn up spattered with olive-green paint.
Harry and Draco had spent a lovely evening listening to a play on the wireless and before long they found themselves cuddled together on the sofa, laughing at the actor's awful fake accent. Harry turned to look at Draco at the exact same moment as Draco did the same. Their eyes met, and Draco leaned forward.
The headmistress wasted no time in announcing to the school that the next student caught 'living in the past' and 'bullying their fellow students' would be promptly returned home to their parents until they could, and I quote: 'learn how to function in normal society again'. Being present at that speech did make me wonder momentarily if the tales of her in front of the Wizengamot weren't exaggerated at all.
Draco grinned and removed his fingers. Lining his cock up with Harry's ready hole, he pushed forward with a grunt. Harry screamed. It was a good scream; he loved the feel of Draco's thick cock filling him up. As Draco shifted his hips, Harry moaned. He was definitely going to remember every second of this.
Draco seemed to have an answer for everything. Harry didn't fully understand the intricacies of time travel, and Draco had tried patiently to explain all the hows and whys and what fors. If nothing else, he was certain that it wasn't the same Draco Malfoy sat on his sofa that he'd worked with all day.
“What's the matter?” Ron asked. “He's been helping us find a flat. I thought it was all forgotten. It was just a drunken mistake after all. He'll just have to remember which bed is his next time.”
Glinda then showed them all a small—magically heated, Draco was grateful to hear—pool that they were free to use when not in session. Luckily the holding hands rule was relaxed while swimming; Draco assumed he and Potter would be spending a lot of time doing just that. Next to the pool was a small building that Glinda told them held a 'relaxation room', which Draco took to mean candles and incense, but actually meant Muggle pool table and small bar; he couldn't have been happier.
“How's the book coming along?” Draco asked, wrapping his arms around Harry's shoulders. “Goblin wars of the 1500s—not my cup of tea, but you do you.”
Every time Harry saw an owl, his face lifted, expecting to see a reply from Draco tied to its leg. Every time someone walked into the shop, Harry looked up, expecting it to be Draco. Every time Ron came home, Harry jumped up from his chair, expecting to see Draco walking through the front door. It was to no avail.
Draco went to his trousers and took out a small phial. “Drink this,” he told Harry, handing it over. “That and a shower will make you feel better, and then we'll go down to breakfast. I think we need to talk.”
“Nuh-huh,” Harry said, grabbing the jar that came flying through the air. “Don't be greedy. You said you were going to give me something to remember you by. I'm waiting.” Harry moved so that he was lying on the floor, his knees bent and his legs open. Palming his own cock, Harry looked into Draco's eyes. “Do I have to do
He might as well have been with them. Actually, Ron would've preferred it if he had been. As much as Ron was grateful for Draco's absence, his presence might have curbed some of Harry enthusiasm. All day, no matter what they were doing, Harry brought Draco into the conversation.
I, in what I wouldn't describe as my proudest moment, spluttered and stammered something about needing to use the bathroom and left pretty quickly.
Harry blushed more than he had thought possible and hid his head in his hands. “It was early. I had a hangover. The bed is so comfy,” he mumbled.
He noticed Hermione's eyes glazing over when he told her how busy he was with the shop and Draco, and didn't know whether he'd be able to spare a holiday. Harry saw the way Ron's eyes rolled as Harry talked about his and Draco's plans for the upcoming weekend.
“Come on then, Harry,” Draco said with a small grin, “spill the beans. You're obviously dying to say something.”
“Yes. I'm sorry for all of that. So sorry, Harry.” Draco wrapped his hand around Harry's wrist, running his thumb over the inside of it. “I
“You didn't finish,” Draco said, but Harry was already at the bin. More than a little curious as to what Harry would have written, Draco picked up the rest of the parchment and joined his partner.
“Your case, if you choose to accept it, is to put a stop to the animosity that exists between the Slytherin and Gryffindor houses.”
Harry didn't understand why Draco was stating the obvious and didn't have time to think about it as one of the crowd aimed a kick for Grumpy Waiter's midsection. Harry raised his wand, a spell on the tip of his tongue.
Harry's smile slipped slightly as he thought over the question. “I'd had enough,” he finally said. “Enough of the Ministry and their pompous arses and of the bad guys. Everyone assumed that I would—could—save them. It was always,
“It's all right,” Draco said with a smile. “I bought some Pinot Noir for you the other day. Kreacher!”
As they neared the braying group, Harry had to stifle a gasp as he recognised the man lying in a heap. Grumpy Waiter seemed to be trying to protect his face and Harry winced as he caught sight the blood seeping out of his nose. The crowd were jeering at him and Harry had to resist the urge to hex every one stood around the poor man. From the way Draco was growling under his breath, Harry knew he was also struggling. What the fuck should they do?
Harry and Draco still weren't talking when it was time for them to meet the other guests in the lobby. Draco hoped they'd sort something out soon; they were due to go back home tomorrow, and he
. He hadn't seen Hermione since Christmas; her workload had been too tough for her to visit him in the recent months. Harry practically ran into the pub, and straight to the table they usually sat at.
Draco looked behind him, and noticed Harry still fast asleep, now cuddling a pillow instead of Draco.
The bloody cow stole my words! Anything I said after that would have seemed disingenuous. Besides, I didn't get the chance. Before you'd finished mumbling to Pansy that it was all right and that you'd see her at school, your friends were dragging you off, the loud bangs of the camera bulbs echoing in my ears.
' sign on the window. After reading the small writing underneath, Harry was saddened to read about the death of Brenda, the lovely old witch who had run the shop. Noticing people milling about inside, Harry decided to pay his respects in person, and knocked on the door.
“Sorry, sorry,” Pansy said, bookmarking her page and stowing the book in her bag. “I needed to finish that bit.”
After dying and everything else that happened that morning, I did not expect to wake up in St Mungo's with Harry hovering around my bed. I didn't expect to wake up, full stop. I was pretty sure that only Harry had the ability to come back from the dead. Confused wasn't the word for what I was feeling.
“Good morning!” Glinda said, much too cheery for first thing in the morning. “I hope you're both well.”
spend as much time there as me.” Harry laughed and lifted Draco's chin. “But then, we're having an early night. And I mean sleep.”
“You seriously want to send Draco Malfoy a love note that Harry Potter meant to send to someone else?”
*  Kingsley would call them both into his office. Invariably because Potter had started an argument over an inane matter.
Harry didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Ron simply sat opposite him with a look of utter shock on his face; the corners of his mouth were twitching but he obviously knew better than to laugh at his girlfriend.
Each of their answers was always the same: 'Don't worry, Harry. It's already sorted.' And it worried Harry something rotten.
“Harry was expecting me,” Zach said, confusion clear on his face. “We're supposed to go over the decorating plans for his house. Are you ready to go, Harry?”
Thankfully—or not, depending who you spoke to—we didn't have to deal with Smith any longer. He was expelled the morning of the article. Not only had he flouted McGonagall's 'forget the past; live for the present' rule, it was discovered that he had been sneaking off to London during school time to talk to the reporter, not to mention the Galleons he'd made illicitly.
to stop doing that. Harry snuggled a little closer and Draco had a vague recollection of something else. Had Harry
“Nice try, but we exhausted the Quidditch talk last night. My view on the Cannons chances has not changed in one day. Now—”
Malfoy had come to his door begging Harry to sleep with him, Harry might've obliged. Of course, he'd thought—fantasised—about it, but when
It was sickening. Not the fact that they were two men. No, Hermione didn't give a hoot about that. It was just the
Draco grabbed hold of Harry's hand, forcing Harry to sit back down. “Wait. Before you do that, we haven't finished talking.”
Draco pushed himself unsteadily to his feet.  It was Harry.  It couldn’t be anyone else.  But now that he was here, Draco wished he could postpone the inevitable.  It would almost be better if he
The kid – Sam’s – gaze flicked between Harry and Draco, and Draco turned away quickly to look at the nearest merchandise (which, of course, was a Liquorice
Harry stared long and searchingly into his eyes, a flash of that same fear cropping up before vanishing.  Draco wanted to press in, to step deeper into Harry’s mind – but at the same time, he didn’t need to.  Harry’s emotions were so reactive, so explosive, that just standing
“And what plan was that?” Harry asked, face rearranging into a scowl.  Even frowning, he was still far too good-looking.
Draco pressed on, backing Potter into the wall – his eyes catching on his office hours sign with inspiration.  He reached out to touch it, watching Potter watch
Harry felt it flutter beneath its armor of pins.  “Uh, yeah, various things?”  He dragged his gaze away from Malfoy’s face long enough to take a look himself.  “There’s, uh-” reading
FRED (?): [the emcees are wearing the same outfit, and with the camera cuts, the audience has lost track of who is who] Wotcher, Draco!
– he probably deserved that.  But if he backed off entirely now, he’d look like a fool, so he pushed on recklessly.  “Are you sure?  It wouldn’t be the first time, after all.”
“Sorry, boy,” Harry said, smoothing Dog's head as he passed. “Didn't mean to scare you. Just dropped a box.”
Harry finally managed to get off the bed and rifled through his bags again. Draco really hoped he didn't have any more whisky in there.
The meeting of BAHAHAHAH was in full swing by the time Hedwig and Darius had had enough of a break. Bob tutted and looked dreadfully close to tossing them into the lake when they landed right in front of him.
The applause was deafening as Harry stepped down off the stage with Dean at his side. Hermione was beaming at him with tears in her eyes. Ginny, Pansy and even more surprisingly, Ron, seemed to be in much the same boat. Draco simply slapped him on the back and veered the group back to their table.
It all came to a head the night before the biggest presentation of my career to date. I had worked long and hard on the new proposal for a new, more efficient, Floo powder, and I was determined to present it to the public at the Ministry's annual public meeting, but Harry was even more set on me not 'standing in public with a bloody target on my back'.
Harry's head cleared as Draco unknowingly spoke the exact same words as Malfoy had. He knew what he was doing was the right thing. He had to try.
When Harry's team came bounding up to them with their arms bulging with every item on their list—who knew that Grumpy was a professional tracker?—Draco couldn't bring himself to care. He just took Harry's hand as he congratulated him, fully aware as to why he felt so relieved to do so.
“It's as busy as ever,” Harry said, accepting the glass of wine Draco had poured for him. “The old ladies are still rather Hufflepufferish. How's your mother?”
Fuck. The whole world knew—it would have been plastered over the papers; I hadn't exactly been discreet. I gripped Harry tighter.
“What the actual fuck are you talking about, Draco Malfoy?” Pansy had pulled herself up from the floor and was standing with her hands on her hips. “And don't you dare leave one fucking word out.”
As Harry and Ginny approached the middle of the ballroom, Harry spotted something that had him turning around, ready to flee. At the very least he had a strong urge to bang his head repeatedly against something hard and door-shaped.
Normal, that is, until she and Ron returned home. Their life was in Australia, after all. Maybe she could persuade Harry to visit them. Once Harry saw what it was like, Hermione was sure, he'd fall in love, just as they had.
There was no abseiling, thankfully, but there were also no other recognisable exercises he'd read about and that he was confident he and Harry would excel at. It was just the ten of them and Glinda. The only props Draco could see were some sheets of parchment, some Muggle pens and a bin.
After picking up Pig and Arnold (quite literally; if Hedwig and Darius waited for Pig to fly both himself and Arnold, they'd be waiting all day), the four held a meeting in a dusty corner of the castle, away from prying (yellow) eyes. Unsurprisingly, neither Pig nor Arnold had anything to add to the conversation. It had taken more than an hour to calm them both down, as excited as they were to be on a case, and, in the squeaky words of Pig, with 'the most awesomest agents as well'.
“Who's going to go first?” Harry asked when they had taken seats as far away from the group as they could manage. “Toss a coin?”
When Harry had work, he usually just threw on whatever clothes were nearest to him and walked straight out of the door. It was different now; after his shower, Harry spent a good twenty minutes deciding what to wear.
Harry swept the glass up with his wand and banished it before checking Dog's paws for any glass. “I'm just glad Teddy wasn't here!” Harry said when he couldn't find a scratch.
Harry couldn't help but laugh. The laugh died as they walked past the boulder that had caused the damage. Sure enough, there was the word he was expecting.
Not wanting to keep anything from Harry, I showed him the bundle and finally allowed him to at least give them to the Special Auror Squad to look at. Meanwhile, without Helen intercepting my mail, I realised that not only were they a daily occurrence but they were steadily getting more explicit in their hatred.
Harry spent the rest of the day in a daze. He was too late. He'd spent too long—literally—fucking around with Draco, and he'd lost his chance with Malfoy. Harry wanted to smack himself. He wished he had Draco's time travel whatever-it-was so he could go back and fix the whole big mess.
They'd even staged an accident between themselves, hoping that Harry and Draco's worry over their pets would overcome their hatred for one another. All that happened was that Hedwig and Darius found themselves being smothered by Hagrid in his hut while Harry and Draco's friends shouted accusations at one another. Being covered in Fang's drool while they were 'recuperating' only added to their despair.
“We'll start with something you should all be used to by now: hands. Please,” Glinda said, walking around the room, “talk.”
Ron heard all about how Draco had got them a box to the world cup qualifier, and exactly how great it had been. He now knew how Draco liked his burger: lettuce, onions, ketchup
“Whatever. Where was I?” Hedwig looked around and caught sight of Pig and Arnold, looking between her and Darius with awestruck looks on their faces. “Ah, yes. Pig, you go to Harry and try and keep quiet and out of sight.”
, had been the headline—Harry decided to look for a new house. As much as he had tried to make Grimmauld Place liveable again, it simply couldn't be done. Kreacher, surprisingly, had accepted the move easily. Harry thought that the fact that he was seeing a Malfoy had greased the wheels somewhat. As did the constant need for dusting. Harry had discovered that while a great cook, Kreacher disliked dusting with a passionate hatred usually reserved for clothes and SPEW.
for not reading the Prophet, so I had no idea what was going on, but from the look of absolute horror on Harry's face as he read the front page, I knew it wasn't going to be good.
It lasted five days. Five glorious days of seeing Potter's spotted boxers whenever he said my name. You'd have thought that he'd have figured it out, but no. He still said my name, and he still dropped his trousers. Brilliant. And it would have continued if it wasn't for Weasley.
A small crowd of early-risers had gathered and were staring in horror and confusion at the mass of floats on the top of the water, all bearing the same word: PERV.
Taking their seats, they swapped plates, seasoned the food in front of them—Draco sprinkling Harry's chips with vinegar, although he couldn't help grimacing as he did so—and they were feeding each other before everybody else had sat down.
Harry and Draco had taken to eating out in Muggle restaurants, and Harry had even conceded to visiting Malfoy Manor for dinner on a couple of occasions; after ensuring that Lucius Malfoy had rid himself of thoughts of killing Harry, of course.
After one such lesson—and a run down of the inner workings of the Gryffindor boys' dorm habits—I tried to quickly gather my things and leave, when it all came to a head with Potter. I'd spent the lesson being as polite as I could, but he just wouldn't shut up. Before I could escape, though, the git had the bloody nerve to ask if I was going straight to the Great Hall for dinner as we, and I quote, 'Might as well walk down together'.
“I'm doing it now,” Harry interrupted her. He knew the beginnings of a rant when he saw one. “I just wondered if you could open up next Friday.”
“So, Hermione, what's he like?” Ginny said, leaning towards her sister-in-law. “You must have met him?”
The next time I saw you, I was too surprised to act at first. I'd heard rumours of you being there when he died, but I didn't think for a second that I'd see you at Severus' funeral. But there you were, looking uncomfortable in your dress robes, trying to look inconspicuous at the back of the crowd. Which was daft, as you had about half of the mourners and at least twelve cameras in your face.
Draco smiled and put the glass of bubbly in Harry's hand. “Of course not!” he said, initiating a toast. “I have no interest in giggling girls, but I do have an interest in fine champagne. Drink up!”
Harry was pulled screaming out of his thoughts by the blinding pain that started in his groin and spread throughout his body. Giggly Girl number one had obviously taken offence at being beaten so soundly and hurled a ball in frustration straight at the celebrating pair. Harry hadn't seen the ball coming towards his, well, balls and thus had not been able to avoid the searing pain of a tennis ball hitting him squarely in the groin.
Draco couldn't believe what a good night he'd had. He'd enjoyed a lovely meal, good conversation and he'd danced stupid dances with Harry until his feet felt like they were going to fall off. He'd had enough, though, and was feeling quite tired. He caught hold of Harry's hand as he moved towards the waiters and pulled him back.
“I thought I'd eaten enough of yours, so I went shopping.” Draco reached into his bag and took out a packet of Rich Tea. “They're your favourites, right?”
*  Potter would huff and promise to not hex his partner. Draco was certain Potter also crossed his fingers.
Harry silently wondered when his inner voice had turned into Hermione. He didn't like it; he wanted it to shut up and stop smirking at him. He especially didn't like the fact that he was now arguing with
Darius had preened when he'd first heard that, but as Arnold started referring to them as the 'Awesome Foursome', he'd taken them both in his claws and threatened to throw them out of the window if they didn't shut the fuck up and listen. Draco would have been proud.
Draco's voice was tinged with sleep and Harry couldn't help but find it adorable. Harry turned around, still wrapped in Draco's arms, and placed a small kiss on the corner of his mouth.
Well, apparently Harry had the dog now, too. It made her smile to think of Harry cuddling up to his pet after work. Maybe it would do him well, to have something to focus on until she and Ron made it home for a visit.
We may have been young, but Harry and I moved into his house in Grimmauld Place together a little before my twentieth birthday and I didn't think anything could touch us. We were too happy. I should have known.
Harry was slowly starting to smile again. He still wondered from time to time—or constantly, depending on his mood—about Draco, and what he was up to. For the main part though, for Harry, life had moved on.
“Oh, put your tongue back in, Harry.” Pansy laughed as she put on her apron. “Not like that. You know that I'm not Draco's type.”
Harry did the mature thing and stuck his tongue out. Once they were both dressed, Harry grabbed hold of Draco and tried to kiss him.
It was testament to their new friendship that Draco didn't immediately burst out laughing or make any snide comments. It had taken a long time, a lot of arguments and more than a few nights filled with awkward silences and even more awkward conversations, but they had managed the seemingly impossible and had become friends.
It was everything Harry had expected and more. The feel of Draco's lips on his own was electrifying; the gentleness gave way to passion, and Harry didn't want it to end. Wrapping his arms around Draco, Harry deepened the kiss and gave in when he felt himself being lowered to the ground. Had it been seconds...minutes...hours? Harry didn't know, and he really didn't care.
Hermione had a smile on her face as she finally drifted off to sleep that night. Ron was a genius. Harry simply needed to see that they were sorry, it had just been a shock, and that it could be the same as it had been before they'd left. The three of them—what had people (Draco) called them back when they were in school? The Golden Trio—it could,
And thus, the meeting began in earnest. The animals and creatures of Hogwarts held these meetings once a week (more when they were swamped) and had done for as long as anyone could remember. As students finished school, taking their pets with them, new students arrived, along with new animals to join the group. Not all animals joined and some (that pesky non-rat from a few years ago) weren't even given the opportunity to do so. The animals that did join, made sure they did their best for the school and everybody residing in it. It was in their name, after all.
“Has Harry Potter finally escaped from the sham relationship he had with Death Eater, Draco Malfoy to find love with another? Your reporter has evidence that indeed he has.”
As Harry shut the door behind Zach, he felt arms snake around his waist and Draco place his chin on Harry's shoulder.
This was how his kitchen table was now littered with brochure after brochure depicting everywhere from the beautiful beaches in Hawaii to the bustling streets of Barcelona. Harry knew he needed a holiday; he just didn't know
Draco moved forward slightly but obviously didn't have good enough balance; he fell off the bed. The moment broken, Harry couldn't hold in his laughter and held a hand out to help Draco up. “Come on,” Harry said as he helped him off the floor, “we need a drink.”
Zach had a strange expression on his face. Harry couldn't decide whether it was annoyance, exasperation or anger. When he thought over Zach's recent behaviour, Harry thought it might be all three. He would have to have a talk with him. Zach seemed to be perfectly happy when around Harry, but when anybody else turned up, he'd turn quite sullen.
Draco snorted. “I wish. Nope, haven't had a boyfriend since Kurt. Lovely man, but he couldn't get past this thing—” Draco pushed his sleeve up to uncover the mark on his forearm. “—so he ended things about four months ago. My mother keeps insisting on introducing me to random men she's met on her travels. I think she just doesn't want me to be lonely. What about you? Any Muggles hidden away in Chez de Harry?”
When he returned home—belly full and ear talked off—he looked at the hall table, sad that he hadn't had a chance to send his letter yet, when he noticed it had gone. The bowl of owl treats had been disturbed so Harry assumed that his owl had delivered it. Kreacher had probably sorted it out for him. He couldn't do any more than he had already; now all he
As soon as they'd closed the door behind them, Harry dropped Draco's hand and started rummaging through his bags.
“...but circumstances got in the way. Draco did some...things. Our school years weren't...pleasant, but they did make us what we are today. I guess what I'm hoping to achieve this weekend is to discover that people can change.”
“But, anyway, congratulations on becoming the new Boy-Who-Lived. I should warn you; it's a pain the arse.”
After a pleasant afternoon lounging by the pool, and a lovely dinner, Harry and Draco decided to take a walk around the hotel grounds before going to bed. Neither one wanted a repeat of the night before; one night on a hard floor with no sleep was more than enough. Both men agreed that a leisurely stroll around the grounds would suffice.
“I think I like you, too.” And, grabbing hold of that bit of courage and squeezing the life out of it, I pulled Potter towards me and kissed him. It was, after all, the only way to definitely find out how I really felt.
Hermione's was what he would expect: condolences and a note to make sure he was taking care of himself. Malfoy's was a simple note, obviously written quickly on the back of what looked exactly like a note in Harry's own handwriting.
“No buts. You must be off. It'll be breakfast soon and I'm sure you have mail to pick up. I'll call a meeting for a few days time to review your progress. Good luck.” With a huge sigh, he sank to the depths of the lake, leaving two unusually flustered owls behind.
Harry crumpled to the floor and Draco rushed over to him. The bloody bastard looked as if he was torn between worry, sympathy and laughter. Harry could hear the Giggly Girls apologising profusely but he couldn't bring himself to care. Draco's face came close to his and Harry forced himself to smile. Luckily, Giggly Girl didn't have
Draco retched and threw his pen at Harry. “Piss off. We'd kill each other before the week was out. Well, I'd probably kill him first. Doesn't sound too bad, actually. When do we start?”
Harry was sitting at the counter in the café, trying his best to work on the rota for the next week. His mind hadn't been on his job properly, and it was starting to show. He had three waitresses turning up at the same time, and he even had some days when it was just himself working. Pansy had threatened him—with castration, among other things—so he had finally decided to pull his head out of his arse and sort it out.
fest. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Eternal thanks and cupcakes to G for everything ♥
“You just want to be the first to know,” Harry said with a grin. “You grumbled for weeks when you had to hear about our holiday plans from Ginny.”
“We have thought long and hard for something appropriate to get you for this birthday, and nothing we could come up with was good enough.”
“Without further ado, please allow me to unveil a present to Harry Potter, and to all of us. This piece was commissioned by the Ministry and paid for by a very generous donor. Thank you, from all of us, once again, Mr Malfoy.”
“Budge up,” Draco said upon approaching Harry. “If you won't get off the lounger, we'll have to share.”
Harry ignored him, instead focusing on helping Draco with his hand. He ran his wand over the small abrasions, healing them, before kissing each knuckle gently.
I, somehow, also became friends with Harry's group of miscreants. Ginny was easy. I had no idea why we hadn't become friends years ago, family feuds and Bat Bogey Hexes aside. We were too similar; it was great to finally have someone who shared the same sense of humour.
I was reacting that way, but I knew it had to stop. And my sleep-deprived brain knew exactly how to stop it.
The next time Harry awoke, it was to an empty bed. Thinking that Draco had returned to his own room, Harry decided to go searching for that potion.
“This exercise is simple,” Glinda said, smiling. “I want you to talk to one another. But,” she added, “as you do, I want you to touch and caress you partner.”
Harry started laughing and Draco popped a profiterole in his mouth to shut him up before giving up and joining in.
“Zach,” he spat, jumping up from where he had been wrapped around Draco. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
“Yes, so plaster yourself in this and you won't burn. Actually,” Harry blushed and turned his back to Draco, “could you please do my back? And then I'll do you.”
Draco's hands gripped his hips harder, his fingertips digging in as he fucked Harry. Exactly how Harry loved it, wanted it, needed it.
Ron had been living with Harry since Hermione and Draco had gone. It had started off with a quick pint and something to eat after work, and soon it turned into Ron moving into one of the spare bedrooms. Harry guessed that Ron missed his girlfriend a little more than he let on.
“And I would be thinking about it every single fucking time good old Mervin cut another budget. Me and you fucking right there on his desk.”
After Harry's coming out, he was once again inundated with well-meaning friends and family trying to set him up. Even Ginny got in on the act—although the thought of dating his ex-wife's team mate seemed to be pushing the barrier. It was slightly better than Molly's though. Her suggestion that he 'visit Charlie' made him feel a little ill. It felt wrong. Incestuous, somehow.
theme tune roused Harry from his light sleep. Well, that and the crashing sound coming from his kitchen. Harry
Potter blushed harder before he stood up straighter and visibly steeled himself. “I, erm, liked the, erm, attention.”
Harry jumped when strong arms wrapped around him from behind, sending soapy bubbles flying all over the small kitchen. “Draco,” he said, relaxing immediately once he recognised the arms holding him. Harry flicked the wireless off and turned in Draco's arms, smiling as he looked at his boyfriend.
I don't know why I persevered. I don't know what I was doing. I just know that I saw you and wanted to talk to you. So I did.
While Draco was out and Harry was still to be annoyed, Dog decided to have some fun with it and actually do what he was always getting punished for. Besides, Harry might be happy if the thing got damaged. Happy enough to take off the bloody ribbon. Either way, it was a win for Dog.
Picking up the pace, Draco thrust harder and faster into Harry, holding Harry legs in the air as he did so. Harry finally started pulling on his own cock; once again meeting Draco's movements, thrust for thrust.
Anyway, McGonagall then took over, silencing the uproar with only a stern glare and a twiddle of her glasses (again, I wasn't there) and informed the old wizards and witches that she fully intended to reopen Hogwarts in September, and would need her students back.
We were thankfully quite safe when we were in school. We weren't prepared at all for the 'outside world'. If I wasn't enjoying myself so much with Harry, it might not have been worth it.
Three, and this was the big one to Harry, was how Malfoy looked. Harry wasn't blind; he knew Malfoy was attractive. Harry had caught himself staring at him on more than a couple of occasions and he wasn't afraid, to himself at least, to admit it. He'd only seen Malfoy an hour ago, and Harry couldn't believe the difference. For one, he was wearing casual clothes, something that Malfoy swore he'd never be seen dead in. And then there was the other thing, the thing that made Harry's mouth water, something he'd never thought he had a fancy for before.
Bob's tentacles twitched. “Yes, well. I have faith in your abilities. I'll call another meeting to see how your plans are coming along later in the week. Now, on to other matters. Trevor—”
Harry didn't know what to do. He was pretty sure he should be ranting and fighting by now, but, if he was perfectly honest with himself, he just didn't want to. He was on holiday, the weather was glorious and he just couldn't get himself worked up enough to bother. He was well aware that he was naked, and he had been so sure that no one would have discovered his new-found love of naturism but he hadn't felt this peaceful in a long time. A quick glance at Malfoy showed that he too had a bemused look on his face. Harry made a decision.
“That is what was going to happen, everybody said so. We had barely got through the funerals and trials before Molly was asking when I was going to propose. Kingsley had already told me that I needn't go back to Hogwarts; there was a spot with my name on it in the Aurors already. Hermione was pestering me to fix up the house as it wasn't fit for a family.
“At least my way wasn't a fire hazard,” Malfoy said without a trace of malice. “I got here two days ago; it's different but beautiful. So, how shocked were you when you saw what type of resort it was?”
“Harry,” Draco said again, scooting closer to Harry to best follow Glinda's instructions. “The man you were talking about last night. The one you like, who you think likes plain, old Harry.” Draco gulped and looked straight into Harry's eyes. “Is he me?”
“Ooh, tennis!” Harry's heart sank as his confusing thoughts came swirling back as Draco walked onto the court, towel slung over one shoulder. “Can anyone join in?”
Not twenty minutes later, and Harry had decided that Draco had the best plans. Harry sat back and let the bubbles wash over him. Why hadn't he known that the hotel had a jacuzzi?
Harry and Draco had fallen easily back into their old relationship. Draco had taken his previous post in the Ministry; he had admitted that the only reason he had agreed to move to Europe was to get away from Harry. They both agreed that mistakes had been made, but they also knew that they had to forgive and forget if they ever wanted to be happy together again. Neither of them had wanted to discuss the reason for their split, and their friends respected their decision. Harry thought that they were simply too relieved to see everything was back to normal to spoil it.
“I'll have a latte to take away, please,” Draco said. “And if you could take my meetings this morning, that would be great.”
Harry regretted having just taken a gulp of his beer as he started in shock and it dribbled down his chin.
He was turned on. Utterly, properly, turned on for the first time in his life. And it was from grinding against a well-toned blond in skin tight jeans who—he discovered after a spectacularly heated snogging session in the toilets—was called Adam.
“Much. I wouldn't have called you a cheat, anyway. I won the bet, and this was my choice. Live with it.
“Sorry for what exactly?” Harry wrenched his hand from Draco's. “Sorry for not listening to anyone for six months? Sorry for ignoring me? Sorry for believing that I would do that to you in the first place?”
At eight o’clock, Harry Apparated to the entrance of Diagon Alley and took a slow walk to the café. As he neared the shop, his heart started beating fast—the front door was wide open. Drawing his wand, Harry carefully entered the open door.
It would solve everything. Potter would leave me alone, and I'd no longer feel compelled to smile at his happy little face every time I saw him. Perfect.
“And we need to fix that, obviously.” Draco added, surprised at Harry's honesty. He was expecting Harry to blame him entirely, and was touched that he hadn't. Draco was also extremely grateful that they weren't required to hold hands during sessions, as his palms were sweating profusely.
“Two of, oh, shit. Are you still on this future thing? And I didn't know you were such a good actor. Good job today; I almost believed you spent the weekend in Wales.”
You were walking out of your room, wiping sleep from your eyes, and I knew I wasn't going to breakfast. The room was empty but for us and I had no excuses. No reason not to talk to you. Nowhere to run or hide. I struggled to remember the beginning of the big speech I had planned out.
Draco threw Harry his jeans out of his bag. “Of course,” he said, “and don't go pretending you didn't.”
Pansy tied on her apron. “Better make it half five. I'll just go and owl the girls,” she said, blatantly ignoring the question. “You'd better get the tea started. It's nearly half nine.”
Human children, Bob loved. He'd play with them for hours, he did. Human adults, he tolerated. Barely. But his fellow creatures, he had very little patience for. Every member of their little group had displeased him enough to have a soaking, except, bizarrely, their hyperactive newest member, Arnold. That little pygmy puff had Bob wrapped around his little finger. Purely metaphorically, of course, as Bob would surely squish him if he tried and the simple fact that Arnold had no fingers.
ill and hallucinating or something.” Harry held his hand to his head to check his own temperature. “Do I feel hot? Do I look clammy? Bloody hell, now I'm asking my hallucination to diagnose my hallucinations.”
Guilt passed through her as Hermione pictured Harry sitting in his old, depressing house night after night, pining after his friends.
Drug tests: negative. So he wasn't drugged with an hallucinogen. Great; he was glad he wouldn't have to call the Aurors in. Ron would've had a field day with that.
Harry once again took hold of his cock, and pulled in rhythm with Draco fingers. “Stop!” he gasped after a few moments. “Don't want to come yet!”
It was the one thing that had been bothering him all week. How the fuck was Lucius bloody Malfoy going to react to his one and only son dating Harry Potter? He was afraid to know the answer, but he needed to ask the question. He wished he could see Draco's face; he wanted to see the truth.
They had opened the wine—which Draco had commended Harry on—while they were eating. Harry hadn't had the heart to tell Draco that he had only picked the wine because the name made him giggle. Somebody who would name their brand 'Elephant on a Tightrope' deserved his business.
Harry almost fell off his stool as Pansy stormed into work, slamming the door behind her and throwing her handbag at him.
Noticing the house, Draco snorted. Palatial, it was not. The grey-bricked building, while pretty and well-maintained, looked barely large enough to house twenty people. But, Draco thought, growing up in the manor and going to school at Hogwarts had probably given him unhealthy expectations.
And then—inevitably, according to Pansy—the worst possible thing happened. He was partnered with Potter.
Harry had accepted Molly's invitation to go to the Burrow for Christmas dinner, and he'd been determined to enjoy it; he didn't want to ruin anybody else's day. As he was searching in the back of his wardrobe for the last of his Christmas gifts to take with him, Harry had pulled out a box that he had forgotten about a long time ago. As he opened the box, Harry had to stifle a sob; nestled inside was the present he'd bought for Draco before any of this had happened. Harry slammed the lid down with a crack; the buckle with the beautiful etched dragon clanging as he threw the box across the room.
We talked about the fact we were kids fighting an adult war, and neither one of us should've have been there. It wasn't our war. We were basically kids who had been fighting the same shit since we were tiny.
,” the woman spoke this time, “would rather work here, waiting on you lot than be at home with me. We're here to take him back and show him that
“Zagreb was such a success, we've been asked if we'd help out with other countries. Anyway, I don't think you want to be bored, hearing about my work. How are you?”
Harry was an idiot—a hopeful idiot, but an idiot nonetheless—to think that people wouldn't care. Optimism meant nothing when faced with judgemental wizards with long memories.
Harry had run into Draco one evening, not long after Ron and Hermione had left for Australia. He had been closing up the shop, and a noise next door had grabbed his attention. At first glance, it looked as if someone was robbing old Mr Rutherford's shop; there was someone inside lit only by a wandtip, and a great deal of rustling and muttering.
One month turned into two, and Harry still hadn't heard anything from Draco. Pansy had promised that she'd tried her best, but Draco wouldn't talk to her. Blaise had even tried to get Draco pissed when he visited him, trying to get him to open up. When Ron had gone to stay with Hermione for a week, he had reported back that Draco was looking as miserable as Harry, yet he still wouldn't listen to reason.
“Iron Man. How the buggering fuck did you come out of that film thinking Iron Man is the best Avenger?”
It had all started three days ago. Three days of the silent treatment and Harry moping around the house. Harry had persuaded Draco that they
Staring into Harry’s face, Draco finally let himself feel just a shred of the emotions whirling constantly beneath the surface.  This was the man he’d grown up in opposition to.
Harry turned around, catching the pudding cup in his line of sight. It glistened beautifully, the flame of the fireplace reflected in its plastic shell. Harry bit his lip and once again turned away.
.”  The last word was said with such emphasis, Draco could almost imagine a knowing wink and nod accompanying it.
If this was any indication of the way his year would go, then he would simply steel himself to that.  He should quash his hopes for the new job at Hogwarts returning a semblance of dignity.  That would only hurt him more later.  No, he should be focusing on mere survival, how this job was just a job - though a damn better one than its predecessor.
It sounded too much like a confession on his tongue, and he immediately regretted it; though, it had the curious effect of causing Potter to abruptly avert his eyes and flush a pretty shade of pink.
And he was.  He was clinging to Draco’s trousers with the grip of a madman, body wound up and taut with an un-releasable tension.
SIRIUS: Well, if I was still in the running, then I’d say me, but as it is…  Yeah, it’s going to be Cedric.
He hadn’t had breakfast yet.  He’d just stared into the flames, watching them sputter and fizzle out as the morning light lengthened.  Through the dark waters of the Black Lake, it never got that bright in his room, only a murky, glowing green.  But having spent seven years living in the dungeons of Hogwarts already, he was quite used to it by now.
on his tongue.  “Come back to sign a few autographs?”  He didn’t really want to start a fight, but the words came so naturally to him, he couldn’t stop.
So shocked was Harry by the guess, that he let his guard down for a fateful moment.  Draco seized the opportunity to pull off a little and loll his head back.  Without thinking, Harry chased the sensation, thrusting forward into Draco’s throat.
son.  Do you know how rare that is among pureblood families?”  Even the words themselves burned at his throat – the
Potter lurched forward a step, jaw hardening, eyes flashing.  Some sick part of Draco liked it though – liked it and wanted to make him mad enough to hit him; at least then he could feel some physical proof of this maddening tension.
Immediately, Harry’s fingers tightened on Draco’s legs.  “No!  I’ll be good.  I swear.  Just tell me what you want, and I’ll do it.”
“Draco Malfoy.  Yeah, that’s what I thought you said.”  Ron rubbed aggressively at the furrow that had appeared between his brows.  He’d set down his firewhisky glass when Harry had pulled him aside, and now it lay forgotten on the common room floor by the window.
It was its own prison; he could see that.  But better to have his foot in only one prison rather than two.
“They made him come over and try to identify me.  I know he recognized me.  But he didn’t say it.  He told them he couldn’t tell.”
The words trickled through his ears, taking a moment to understand.  Then, his head snapped up to look.
Not long after the nightmares worsened, Draco had left the Manor.  He’d had no way of telling whether they’d stop after he was gone, but he knew that anything was better than awakening in the same rooms that haunted his very dreams.
He slipped into the suit, marveling at how the lines fit him so much more cleanly than the billowing mystery of his cloak.  Tossing the jacket over his shoulder, he headed to Harry’s quarters.
He aimed his wand at it again, marveling at the slow rise and fall of the small animal’s chest, when such a creature was normally lost in perpetual motion.  Such things were only possible with magic, and, after spending a year and a half without it, Draco knew better than to take such wonder for granted.
Draco laughed.  “I don’t know – I’m hearing a lot of complaining.  Maybe I should leave you a few more hours to get the point across.”
“Discretion,” Harry confirmed.  “Can’t be too hard, right?”  His face betrayed him as Draco lifted his pair of Quidditch gloves from the bench.  “Right!  I’ve got to get going.  Gotta, er, meet Ron and Hermione, so…”
“And I hate Draco Malfoy, but that apparently hasn’t stopped you.”  He said it with a laugh and picked up his drink again, swirling it lightly before taking a swig.
” he spit the name with unbelievable disdain “-to testify against me a second time so that I’ll be out of the way while he
He glanced up at Harry’s face, suddenly wanting to see the expression there, and he felt the man’s breath stutter when he did.  “Draco, I…” His voice was thick, wanting.
.  “Granger-” he cautioned, though she only leaned closer to inspect, scribbling madly again in her notebook.
On some sites, videos would randomly begin to play, and it had taken him an embarrassing amount of time to find the mute button.  At one point, Blaise had woken up to a rude ad, and before Draco could explain, the prat had just given him a knowing smirk and put his head back down to sleep.
”  He wasn’t even acting on purpose now – he was simply too stunned by Potter’s hysteria to so much as open his mouth and respond.
,” he scoffed.  “Come Potter, can’t you do better than a tickling charm?”  It was like he didn’t want to
Malfoy had his mouth open to respond when his gaze caught on a particular pin that left him speechless.  Harry knew at once which it was.
Harry was fine.  He was totally normal and not at all uncomfortable in what he was wearing – it might even look
Draco – and that thought had to be curbed before Draco could come in a confusing mix of heat and tenderness.
GEORGE: As if that weren’t hard enough, the gingerbread landscapes have to capture a scene or a sense of what Christma-...the
“Did Rolanda give you everything you need?” she asked in the face of his silence.  “If you feel unprepared for any of the lesson plans, feel free to contact me, and I can get you in touch with her for clarification.  The first year of teaching is always the hardest, and there’s no shame in asking for help – blunders are to be expected as well.”
Like maybe the stereotypes were fashioned for a reason.  It sounded absurd to say he went trying on clichés this week to look gay and ended up finding a unique style for himself that he liked.  Maybe
wasn’t getting better.  And his six months of suffering such ill conditions and indignity had brought him nothing but a swift end to his last scrap of hope.
Draco stared at him, tensed and ready for the slightest casting movement, waiting for Potter to try and show him up before the class.  Just the slightest twitch, and he would retaliate.
was the one acting insane, and there had really never been any signs of interest or flirtation between them.
” he asked, once he gained the presence of mind to speak again.  His senses were slowly returning; his tunneled vision was expanding, and he thought he could smell the lingering burning scent that was unique to combative spells.
Harry’s breathing went somewhat erratic, and their eyes locked in smoldering, consuming tension.  Draco’s hand moved up, higher and higher, before dancing away as he lost his nerve.  His inhibitions were dancing on a knife’s blade, and ultimately it was the ambient restaurant sounds filtering in that revived his sense of propriety.
Hello all - and welcome to my favorite season: FALL!!!  I find it so funny that the seasons are aligning with my story's timeline once again (just like last year when I was posting TNFI...wow, it's already so nostalgic)!
His focus sharpened, and he thrust hard into Harry, digging his nails into the man’s hips.  He thrust again in the same place when he felt Harry’s walls spasm around him in pleasure.  Harry melted in his arms, taking each of his strokes in stride, riding it out as Draco hit the spot over and over and
.  “Call it a last-ditch effort to get me to abandon my ‘traitorous’ ways.  It didn’t work, so, naturally, Father went straight to the press with that horrid interview like he promised.”  It was less than that – and more.  Whatever fresh hell he’d endured at their hands, when they called him, he came.  He feared he might always.
They dove and raced across the pitch.  Draco did some warm-up laps as he bided his time waiting for the snitch to reappear.  The darkness seemed to throw Potter a bit at first, but Draco had long since gotten used to dangerous flying conditions.
Draco stared into the face of his former nemesis for a long time.  He catalogued the worry lines etched into his brow, even in sleep – softened only by his undeniable youth.  They were both still
FRED: It seems so, George.  [He raises a conspiratorial eyebrow.]  Maybe today’s battle can settle things between them once and for all.
Flirting with Harry was so much better now that he knew they were on the same page.  It was effortless – he didn’t even have to
The room fell to a hush to hear more of her plan.  Several students came out of their dorms, urged by friends who saw that a meeting, of sorts, was forming.  Slytherins were sneaky that way – no one wanted to miss a good bit of gossip.
He dragged a hand through his hair.  Fury was welling up in him, drowning the logic – drowning the pain.  He knew it was merely defensiveness, but he couldn’t stop the words that tore from his mouth in the next instant.  “It was just a stupid dance!”
Hey everyone!  I'm finally getting a chance to sit back down and write some more of this (hopefully this week), so I will try my best to get back on track with writing and updates.  Hope you're enjoying it so far!
Memories of earlier rushed back into his mind: of him calling Harry “professor,” of a bit of roleplay that hadn’t actually strayed too far from their normal dynamic.  Him warming Harry up with a bit of mouthwork before leaving him right on the edge.
“Yeah, the press.  I mean…I mean, we haven’t decided whether we’re going to…you know?”  His eyes caught Draco’s with embarrassment.  “Tell people.  About this.”
He busied himself with standing, attention split between whatever Harry was saying and his own impending doom.
They reached the end of the hall all too soon – and Draco lamented that it was once again time for him to perform.  He stopped abruptly, heartened by how quickly Potter flipped to face him.  How
Harry sighed, running a hand through his tangled hair before giving up and looking to the ceiling.  “Draco…I know you care-”
He shook the paper in Potter’s face again to drive home the point, but the man didn’t seem to be anything other than amused by the situation.  Okay.  Draco would just have to elaborate on his indecorum then.
“For wearing clothes that fit me?”  He pressed his knee to Harry’s groin, delighting at the strangled moan it wrenched out of the other man.
Besides, vampires had a definite sensuality – both in legends and real life – and, with Potter, he figured he could use all the overt allure he could scrape together.  That vampires often served as metaphors for homosexuality only strengthened the message he was broadcasting.
If Potter was simply trying to put the past behind them and become friends, and Draco was taking advantage of that to-…to-
Harry looked ready to strangle him, though.  The man wobbled over to where Draco was standing, and – half expecting a punch – Draco was shocked when Harry simply dropped onto his knees without prompting.
Flitwick’s confused sputtering was the only sound breaking the stillness.  “Err, with Professor Potter, you say?”  He glanced nervously at the man in question, who had foregone the wounded expression and looked absolutely livid.  “Are you, um, feeling up to it then?”
“And now,” the man whispered, “we fight.”  It sounded less of a command than a question, and for a long moment, neither of them even moved.
Draco swallowed, endeavoring to press on – if only to get some semblance of perspective on the matter.  “Well, Potter?”  If anything could get to him, it was always a dare.
