Draco flicks.
He felt frozen where he stood. Yes, that was definitely a prophecy, but—
“I know,” Harry replied. Draco’s eyes were wild, boring into him, grieving and angry and something else, something that told him Draco would never, ever hurt him. “I’ll find her.”
Harry had never before tried to bend his magic like this, using it as a simple force. But he knew what it was capable of, he could feel it. He’d seen it hurt people before; it rose and fell with his hot temper, it crackled and it burned and shattered things. There was no reason it shouldn’t be able to
“Hello, love,” he murmured, brushing a piece of her hair out of her face. “Feeling alright?”
But apparently, today, May the Second, 2006, was different.
wrong,
Draco stuck the index finger of his right hand inside the collar of his shirt and idly traced the scar there. He was determined to keep his wits about him, today—they were literally reliving a war, and he knew Harry had endured the absolute worst of it. He wanted to be strong, for Harry. He wanted to be something Harry could lean on. Draco refused to fall apart under his own emotions, this time.
“There’s got to be…” Draco mumbled, his own emotions carefully tucked away. “Aha.” This memory was small, almost irrelevant, but the glow was definitely there.
“I’ll be fine,” he replied, and prayed that not an ounce of weakness showed on his face, because Pansy would pounce on it in a heartbeat. “No matter how this ends, the demand outstrips the supply, you know.”
“You have no idea what you did to me, Harry,” he croaked. Harry took another step. “I can’t—I won’t survive it.” Another step, his chest hit Draco’s outstretched hand, the feeble fortress that separated them. Draco’s breath hitched.
Potter slurred, shaking his head slowly, regretting it as he squeezed his eyes shut against a wave of nausea. Draco felt it too, and felt himself sway and sweat in his own body. That was odd—normally he was able to remain an outsider in someone’s memories. He was able to discern emotions and feelings, but as a separate entity. Why was he
“Ah,” Draco said, “with my body, just then?” Harry nodded.
So he gave Draco a quick wink, thoroughly enjoying Draco’s sharp intake of breath and widening eyes, before calling out the floo destination.
“It’s not ideal, but we can skip the meditation, then,” Draco explained. “I fear it would only make you more tired, at the moment. We can have a nap during our break today.” Harry sat up, apparently ready to go. Draco set down his coffee, and lifted his wand, waiting for Harry’s nod.

When he arrived in Paris, he realized how lucky he’d been on the Isle of Man.
to know what Malfoy’s Patronus was. What could be Malfoy’s happiest memory? Perhaps bullying a first year? Watching Harry get in trouble?
“Don’t test me, Mother. You can owl him while you recover, and if you’re still dying to see him in a few months, I’ll accompany you to…” he looked down at Harry.
“Like what?”
“Yes. Friends can do this, too.” He climbed over Harry’s thighs, straddling him. Harry gasped a little and opened his eyes, staring at him in wonder. Draco’s heart was pounding. He was being reckless,
“He gave you a potion,” a timid, young voice finally responded, stirring something in Draco’s brain, and Draco hummed in agreement.
Draco valiantly stopped himself from rolling his eyes, but it was only a matter of time.
“I wasn’t going to eat them
“Whether I am or not, you know I can’t discuss it,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes.
snapping back to Draco’s, wide with confusion and fear.
But Potter and Granger both nodded in understanding. Weasley looked confused, and turned to Granger, as he probably did every time he didn’t understand something, since their first year at Hogwarts. Granger felt his gaze, but kept hers on Draco as she muttered, “Reference to a muggle fairy tale. Two kids are abandoned in the woods, and drop a trail of breadcrumbs behind them so they can find their way back. It sounds like the best way to describe what he’s saying, I can’t think of anything similar magically.”
Lucius’ voice was like ice, and Draco could feel sweat forming on his brow. He said nothing, keeping his face carefully blank. Lucius raised his wand again, and Draco felt him grabbing hold of the strings, like picking up a puppet.
Harry was confused, but too pleased by Draco’s fingers in his hair to care.
In those moments of separation, Draco would withdraw, close himself off. His eyes would lose their fondness, turning cold and suspicious and tired again, as if only remembering then who Harry was. He wore the same expression when Harry came back, quiet and exhausted from creating memories and fitful naps. They would go home together, and Harry would sit on the sofa and wait for Draco to want him again.
Harry waved his wand, and Conjured.
if he changed back now, but trying to slip past Harry and run out the door and maybe off the continent wasn’t an option, since Harry was staring him down with a strangely bright look in his eyes and a smile Draco didn’t know how to interpret. It could have meant anything from
Draco turned around and started walking towards his bedroom, removing his jumper as he went. He caught a glimpse of the scars on his chest in the firelight before entering the darkened hallway—the chest that Harry had pulled against him, that had pressed Harry’s body into the tree.
The kettle started whistling, and Draco reluctantly pulled away to finish making their tea, hiding his face in the curtain of his hair.
He waited a moment, taking a deep breath. He shook out his hands at his sides, trying to expel some nervous energy. He shifted on his feet, his eyes darting around, looking for something he couldn’t see. Then the room began to change.
“Er…” Draco began, shocking everyone in the room with his discomposure, “the house elves must have… just made one up for her.”
The wizard at the desk didn’t look much older than Harry himself. His sandy blond hair was combed back neatly, his robes pressed impeccably. The office was immaculate, not a single quill or parchment out of place, but it was still small and cramped. It was clearly the office of someone who believed themselves more important than they were. Harry glared at the man, who only continued staring in consternation, but Ron wrinkled his nose as he followed Harry inside the narrow doorway.
There was a small pile of post on the counter—he recognized Andromeda’s handwriting on the topmost letter.
Harry was looking at him anxiously, but didn’t appear to be in distress. These were his memories, after all, he must be used to them by now. Apparently, they flowed through him that quickly all the time. It was clearly Draco who had been affected the most.
And then the wards wobbled, signaling Harry’s arrival. Draco sighed, and pulled his hands away, resolving to listen to the tape right after their session today.
The walls began to spin, and Parkinson and Timsy jumped, looking completely panicked. Harry’s lip curled in distaste at the Department’s dramatics. Merlin forbid they have
“Not impossible, just bloody difficult, and it’s a long story, so will you please just put her back together?”
so it became a game of Draco’s teasing barbs increasing in ridiculousness until Harry finally broke and laughed.
Harry felt Draco’s tongue against his lips, and opened his mouth with the sudden flurry of sparks in his veins, wrapping his arms fully around Draco’s waist, feeling the firm muscles of his back beneath his jumper. He felt giddy and lightheaded, unable to stop himself from grinning against Draco’s lips, even as their kisses gained urgency. Draco’s hands tilted Harry’s head to the side, deepening their kiss, sliding Harry’s tongue against his own, and a soft, satisfied sound came from Draco’s throat.
“I miss her,” Draco said, ignoring him. “But I can feel her. Can you feel her?” He speared Harry with wide, wild eyes. It still felt like Harry was talking to a statue, one that simply moved from one expression to the next. He looked around at the beautiful, snow-covered gardens Narcissa had tended, back to the beautiful, complicated son she had raised.
haven’t had a real conversation, maybe ever. The universe was clearly laughing at them again—of course, the only way Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could ever speak to each other was with bitterness, with violence.

Harry thought for a moment, and shook his head, no. Draco sat back, contemplating the memory, twirling another lock of hair through his fingers with his elbow propped on the armrest. Harry watched his hand, again.
was built for speed more than maneuverability, and Draco reached the garden barely a half-second before Harry, landing clumsily and laughing in delight.
“—we hoped you’d be able to go through it with us again, give us some more information on the curse, any theories you may have come up with since you’ve been working with Harry…” she trailed off, frowning at Draco, and he could tell from their concerned faces that he probably looked terrified. He glanced to the hearth. Ron had said soon, right? What time did Teddy go to bed? Would Harry stay longer to visit with Andromeda?
“Awfully inquisitive, for an Unspeakable who doesn’t ask questions,” Draco grumbled. “Nothing nefarious, I assure you.”
“Oh, she’s not upset that you fucked it up, Potter. She’s upset that she took you away from me, and expected you to do the impossible and save the day because of a life debt. She’s guilty for
He nearly cried with the chilly gust of salty sea air that hit his face, wet with the spray of the waves on the beach; he breathed it in like a dying man. His shoes dug into the sand. Night had fallen, and the black sky glittered with infinite stars, impossibly brighter under a new moon. He felt the susurrant noise of the waves in his own lungs, spreading contentment through his veins.
“‘Cissa,

and it was so wonderfully weird to see this behavior on his long, gorgeous, human body, instead of the little white noodley one it was usually reserved for. It was his happiness, when it got too big to hold in, and it certainly wasn’t the reaction Harry had expected, but one he was unbelievably grateful for, nonetheless.
“Healer Malfoy,” he greeted in his deep, smooth voice. “May I come through?”
“Of course you did,” Ron sighed, setting down his mug and wrestling his hair into a bun. “That sounds
“That could well have been an Unspeakable, but I wouldn’t know. I’ve never actually seen one, that I know of.” Draco thought for a moment. “There’s a Hall of Prophecies down in the Department of Mysteries, isn’t there?”
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled, lifting his head and peering at him. Harry only looked amused. He was holding up The Fugees album,
wanted to spend time with him, after everything he’d put him through?
Harry remained in his seat for a moment more. His wild, dark hair was curling softly over his forehead, and Draco could faintly see the tip of his lightning bolt scar where it cut through his right eyebrow. The light from the fire danced over the light stubble shadowing his jaw, accentuating his cheekbone. He sat so confidently, taking up the space of the wingback chair—his denim clad legs splayed slightly, strong arms laying across the armrests, like he
Harry pushed him into bed and stripped him with zero finesse, nearly crying with happiness at the breathless giggles it produced. It was the first time Draco had smiled at him since June, and he found himself doing whatever it took to see it again, infusing joy into his pleasure.
A corner of Harry’s lips twitched up, and he gave a short nod. Draco prepared to start his analysis, but Harry grabbed his notebook first, glancing at Draco once before writing.

Teddy came up then to chat eagerly about Harry’s daring rescue mission, not forgetting to remind Draco that he had said they’d have a Seeker’s game, and that he better not think he can get out of it just because he was ill. Camila climbed off to go talk with Rose, bringing Draco’s Grouch stuffie with her.
“Ready for another go?” Draco asked, giving Harry a reassuring smile. Harry smirked, leaning forward and intensifying his eye contact, and Draco’s pulse sped up erratically. He cleared his throat, raised his wand, and waited for Harry’s nod.
Ron interrupted, mouth hanging open with shock and indignation. To him, apparently, there was no doubt as to what Draco had meant—Draco was just surprised Ron thought it at all compelling. Hermione whipped her head to the side to stare at her husband in bewilderment. Draco thought privately this may have been one in only a handful of moments in history where Ron Weasley knew something Hermione Granger didn’t.
“You’re all…” Malfoy waved his hand vaguely at Harry’s body. “Quiet.”
Hermione set her mug down on the coffee table. “I’ll go get the Pensieve, I’m pretty sure Harry’s pub memories are still in there.” She walked away, and Ron took a seat on the sofa, sipping his tea. Draco frowned—they wouldn’t be able to do anything until Harry arrived, why bother getting it out now? He shrugged it off and sat in the armchair, because it was closest to the corner, where the walls of bookshelves met, and from there, he could see everything in the room—the doorways, the windows, the hearth. He felt a little calmer. Hermione reentered the room, floating the Pensieve above the coffee table.
“Will you ever let that

And now he’d gone and made Draco feel
“I need Harry back in working capacity as soon as possible,” Shacklebolt said mechanically, and Draco rolled his eyes. “With the sudden retiring of Vance and Eldridge from the Wizengamot, the path has been cleared for some rather unsavoury up-and-coming politicians—Umbridge types, you understand—and I need Harry to start publicly endorsing the right candidates, to ensure the Wizengamot remains balanced.”
His heart sped up unnecessarily as he felt the telltale wobble in the wards, but he kept his face blank and smooth. He heard the low rasp of Timsy’s voice welcoming someone, and barely had time to straighten his hair out one last time before the door to the study opened and Potter walked in.
Draco set down his key on the small table by the door. He walked into his kitchen without waiting for Harry to follow.
Kingsley! Make someone else do it! I didn’t ask you to look after Draco as a
Malfoy eyed Harry’s furious face for a moment, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, a lock of flyaway platinum hair falling out of his wind-battered messy bun.
I can just filter them and steer them, if you’ll allow it.”
Teddy looked up, eyes widening as he finally realized Draco was there, and Draco noticed his eyes were the exact same shade of green as Harry’s. He gave the boy a soft smile, surprisingly nervous.
The song changed, and Draco glared at the boombox again. Classic Harry Potter, always getting him into more trouble, somehow.
“What are you writing?”
“I was tired.”
The corners of Harry’s lips twitched a little as he listened, a faint curiosity growing in his eyes. He tapped his nose with his finger, raising an eyebrow in silent query.
Harry gave him a quick nod and grabbed his notebook. Draco took inventory of himself, touching his thighs, his collarbone, his arm, his hair, over and over. Harry tried not to watch, but he was so bloody distracting.
He finally told Harry to let his thoughts drift however felt natural to him, to not try to control them, but simply allow his mind to flow how it was used to, and to open his eyes when he felt ready. Harry breathed for a couple more minutes before opening his eyes, where Draco waited, watching him. Harry grinned at him again, and Draco returned it, silently reveling in how good it felt to have Harry look at him with something other than rage or revulsion.
He sighed in satisfaction as the chime eventually ceased. Perhaps whoever thought they were worth his time had finally given up…
“Why did you come back for me?” Draco asked softly, brow furrowed, unsure if Harry would even answer. Draco wouldn’t blame him if he didn’t, but Harry didn’t hesitate. He opened his notebook, clicked his pen, and started to write.
“I moved all my other patients to different Healers,” he appealed. “There’s only one on my plate right now.”
Malfoy looked like he was trying to explain the simplest concept to an unruly child. His pale hands were clasped in front of him, leaning his elbows onto his knees. Harry noticed faded bluish ink smudges on his fingers and the side of his palm.
Malfoy turned back to him and started adjusting his bed with his wand.
Harry still looked nervous, but he nodded and relaxed his grip on the armrests.
Harry looked away from Draco’s hand, meeting his eyes. He nodded.
vocalizing Harry’s innermost regrets, his deepest pain—
Harry slowly lowered his wand and approached the bed with silent, stealthy footsteps.
“Master Draco is being in the garden, reading,” the elf croaked, walking away from Harry dismissively. Harry took a deep breath, and strode his way down the familiar path to the back door, unbuttoning the top buttons of his uniform in an effort to help himself breathe.
“Ron’s here. Go,” she ordered. Harry nodded, turning to Ron.
“The Aurors, sir?”
Granger hesitated, darting glances around the room, before she gathered herself again, clearing her throat. “It’s not a very nice story. They sort of fall prey to a cannibalistic old witch with a house made of sweets, who fattens them up like pigs for slaughter. They end up murdering her with her own oven, and barely escaping with their lives.” She shuddered. “Gave me nightmares as a child. Not a good bedtime story.” She thought for a moment. “Also a terrible portrayal of magical people, but not entirely atypical for the muggle world, especially at the time it was written, in the middle ages.”
and making Harry nearly miss said game to follow him and spy on him.
“What do you mean, ‘no?’” Harry scoffed.
“About an hour. Why, you in a hurry?”
It only abated when they were both laying on the stone, looking at the sky instead to prevent another fit. Harry’s abs hurt. Malfoy breathed heavily as he recovered, letting out the occasional chuckle.

Harry sipped his wine, letting its dry flavour linger on his tongue as he watched Draco cook. Draco occasionally hummed along to the old music, his hips continuing their subtle, hypnotic sway, until Harry forgot about the wine altogether.
He was looking at ten years of his life.
“You sure? You are doing this for her, whatever it is, are you not?”
It took them a few minutes, but eventually Harry heard Timsy’s rasping voice speak up.
Harry raised his own hand to his face, holding Malfoy’s hand there. Malfoy felt so warm, his sharp face softened with obvious
a secret. He was, unfortunately, the most famous of them. Though no one knew what it was he did.
“...Timsy performed Legilimency…?”
Harry was watching with another sad smile on his face, still absently petting Hera. Draco thought he was probably remembering his snowy owl—he wondered what had happened to the beautiful bird, but resolved not to ask. He’d most likely find out soon enough, in Harry’s head.
“You are understanding me without a wand?”
—they treated you the same way Lucius treated the Malfoy house elves, do you know that?”
While Harry meditated, Draco worked on his Occlumency walls, building them up as formidably as he could. It was more dangerous, now that he’d let his guard down like that once. It would be too easy to subconsciously do it again, while he was in Harry’s head, to pull himself closer and let himself drown in Harry, like he desperately wanted to. Draco closed his notebook and waited, rubbing the Dark Mark on his arm through his sleeve, reminding himself of exactly
Maybe it was the garden.

Draco then turned away, leading the way back to the study, berating himself again for his wayward thoughts.
and the not knowing was making him itch, keeping him frozen in time, unable to move forward. He felt restless with it.
Even now, as Harry found him alone on the balcony, avoiding the crowd of the Ministry’s holiday party and staring out over the city, he felt his stomach flutter with excitement at the possibility of seeing it again, adding another to his mental collection.
“Curious.”

he breathed. “We need Hermione. We need Hermione
But Harry took his hand back, shaking himself out of whatever had come over him, hunching his shoulders in. He glanced apologetically at Draco, once, and started writing again, and Draco tried to hold back a sob, because the fear was real, now. What if Harry was just like the other Aurors, who had laughed and watched as he suffered through Veritaserum overdoses as a teenager, who had asked him the most incriminating and embarrassing things they could think of, purely for their own entertainment?
“Alright, this way,” he led them down one aisle and stopped near a corner towards the shop door. “Well, these are all our roses,” he said, his tone flat and unimpressed. Draco looked at the selection and saw that indeed the buds were a few days away from blooming. He could still see their colours though, which was the main thing. He made a humming noise, pretending to ponder a bit. Then he turned to Harry with a flourish and gave the man a tiny smile.
“Me?” He asked.
To anyone who is going to read this I say thank you so much and pls comment or kudos if you'd like to see more! :)
“Of course, there are just too many to choose from so to make it easier on myself I’ll let you decide”, Draco left no room for discussion in his statement and gave Harry an expectant look. Harry still looked shocked and rather reluctant but turned to the plants anyway. He seemed to be debating with himself and he glanced sideways at Draco. Draco simply inclined his head towards the plants and continued giving Harry a look that said ‘well, go on’. Harry sighed in resignation and stepped closer, inspecting the rose buds carefully.
“Boyfriend? I, no, um, I’m not gay?” He said but it came out as a very obvious question. Draco couldn’t help himself and he let out a genuine laugh.
It was the softest, firmest, most passionate kiss that Harry had ever experienced. Draco moved in all the right ways and lead Harry so all he had to do was follow and enjoy. Harry was losing himself in the kiss when Draco’s tongue darted out and softly licked Harry’s bottom lip. Harry didn’t know what that meant but he instinctively opened his mouth and Draco’s tongue entered. It was like a ballroom dance, Draco would push and pull and Harry would return with his own movements and all the while Harry felt as if he had found heaven. Much too soon Draco withdrew and the kiss ended. Both Harry and Draco were panting and Harry could feel his cheeks on fire. His cock was hard as well, straining against his jeans. Harry licked his lips and Draco’s eyes darted down then back up again. “Do you believe me now?” his voice was so husky and raspy that Harry’s already weak knees nearly buckled. He didn’t trust his voice so he simply nodded and a heart-stopping smile broke out on Draco’s face. He leaned back and Harry almost whimpered at the loss of proximity. Draco however reached into his suit jacket’s breast pocket and pulled out a peach coloured rose. Harry’s eyes widened as he realised it was the same rose from the bush that Harry had sold him three days ago.
“I can’t be the person you fancy,” he said and he noticed he sounded a little breathless.
“I don’t understand,” he said weakly, his eyes still covered and his back flush against Draco’s front. Now that he was aware of it all his senses seemed focused on how Draco felt. He was as solid as a brick wall but warmth radiated from him like a heater. Harry could tell that Draco was very fit because all he felt was muscle but obviously it wasn’t bulky at all because when he had seen Draco he was very thin and lithe. Suddenly Draco’s lips were on his neck and all his senses went there.
Harry shook his head slightly and averted his gaze, trying to snap himself out of it. This was the most beautiful man he had ever seen and he suddenly felt his heart rate increase as he thought about having to interact with him. Harry tended to get nervous around attractive people and he wiped a hand through his hair in an attempt to tame it, obviously with no success. He figured he should stop standing there in awe before he was found out and cleared his throat. The man in front of him turned his head and relaxed his features slightly, looking faintly relieved at Harry’s presence. Harry heard his intake of breath because holy crap he had the most beautiful eye colour Harry had ever seen in his entire life. They were a sparkling grey, no silver, and they caught the light perfectly. Quickly regaining himself Harry took a subconscious step closer and mustered his courage.
“Nothing. Unfortunately Mr. Malfoy all our roses haven’t quite bloomed yet and won’t be ready for at least another couple of days,” Harry’s voice was cool and his eyes gave nothing away. Draco waved his hand in front of his face in a dismissive manner.
“She has a very large garden already so I want to get her something exotic and that you wouldn’t find commonly, do you think you can help me with this? Because if you can’t I’d rather you tell me now and not waste my time.” Harry gulped and scratched the back of his head. He really wasn’t the person to be doing this. He only teamed up with Neville because Neville didn’t have enough money to start the business and he had promised that Harry would just need to take care of the financial side of things and he would handle all the plant stuff. But two weeks ago Neville’s grandmother had gotten sick and he had to travel to her house which was in France and he asked Harry to look after the shop while he was gone. Harry thought it would be easy and it was for the most part, until now of course.
“Shhh, don’t scream, I’m not going to hurt you.” The voice was smooth as silk and it sent shivers down Harry’s body. He would recognise that voice anywhere because he had been replaying it over and over these past three days. He gulped.
“Because I’m awkward and weird and people like you aren’t interested in people like me,” Harry could feel the tears prick his eyes as he talked. He hadn’t let himself cry about it these past few days but now with Draco here and all that was happening he couldn’t stop himself.
“Yes, like I said, I need a plant for my mother.” His voice was icy but Harry didn’t think he meant it in a hostile way; it was just the way his voice was. Harry nodded and looked at the pansy in the man’s hand.
“Right, well since you will be of no use to me then I’m inclined to look elsewhere,” and before Harry knew it the divine stranger started to walk in the direction of the door, away from Harry. Without even thinking Harry shot forward and griped the man’s arm.
“What don’t you understand sweetheart,” Draco whispered in that same low tone and Harry swore he almost melted. Holding onto his self-control he managed a reply.
Draco’s hand came off his eyes and then both his hands were on Harry’s shoulders, turning him around. Harry didn’t have the courage to look at Draco so instead he looked down at his feet and saw his scruffy sneakers and Draco’s pointy shoes. He could feel the tears running down his face but he didn’t brush them off; he didn’t want to acknowledge how Draco made him feel. Just then Harry felt Draco’s hand grab his chin and lift his head. Harry didn’t have the energy to fight him so he just let him. He kept his eyes down though until Draco whispered gently, “Look at me love,” and Harry looked up. Draco looked the same as the last two times; perfectly styled platinum blonde hair, razor sharp cheekbones, slim and rosy lips and those goddamn starlight eyes. All of it made Harry want to cry more. Draco’s eyes were searching Harry’s face and they were full of concern then he looked straight into Harry’s eyes with a look of intense tenderness. “Do I need to prove to you that I like you?” He asked soft but assuredly. Harry gave a little nod, not sure what would happen next. Draco started leaning down and getting closer and closer and Harry’s eyes grew wider. Before he could say anything their lips met.
“Wait!” Harry yelled a little too loudly and the man turned in surprise. Harry could feel his face burning with colour and he quickly let go of the man’s arm and when he did he could still feel the warmth on his palm. He clenched his fist in a subconscious hope to savour that warmth and keep it trapped in his hand forever. Realising he should speak he hurriedly scrambled to form sentences in his head. “I think I saw some special plants out the back, if you like I can bring them out and we can see if they’re exotic enough?” Harry sort of tapered off towards the end, his gut clenching in anticipation. He can’t believe he just asked that. The man seemed to be pondering the offer and Harry could feel his confidence dwindle by the second. But then something miraculous happened and the beautiful stranger agreed.
“1500 did you say?” He said calmly, as if it weren’t the most absurd thing he had ever heard.
“Oh, well, um, tell her thank you and I hope she enjoys it,” Harry said quite awkwardly and Draco could tell he wasn’t used to getting compliments. What a shame, such a beautiful creature ought to be bathed in them.
The man was still there, his hand on the counter, those long slender fingers tapping away. Harry gulped and had to try not to imagine just exactly what those fingers were capable of doing. He set the plants down on the counter with a thump and looked up at the man sheepishly. “This is all we had, but I haven’t seen these plants anywhere else in the shop so I’m pretty sure they must be special or something.” Harry smiled in what he hoped was an apologetic way and watched the man’s eyes slither down to his mouth. Harry swore he saw a flicker of something akin to desire glint in the man’s eyes before it disappeared. But that couldn’t be possible so Harry just shook the thought away. After staring at Harry’s mouth a moment more the man’s gaze shifted down to the flowers. His fingers gave a little tap and his expression became pensive. Harry wasn’t looking at the flowers but at the way the man’s pale hair shifted to come forward. The light coming from the side windows reflected against the strands in the most mesmerizing way and Harry found himself unable to look away. His hand twitched with the sudden urge to run his fingers through them and feel their softness against his skin. He flushed and quickly looked down, distracting himself with the plants. It wouldn’t do to have these thoughts; especially when there was no way this man would ever think the same about Harry. The man cleared his throat and Harry looked up, hoping his blush had abided somewhat. The man was holding one plant with one blooming flower. Its petals were white but it had a large protruding centre that was bright pink with amber pollen bunches in the middle. Harry had to admit it was quite beautiful.
Draco paused outside the shop and took a deep breath. He ran his hands down his white button up shirt and thought for the tenth time in five minutes if he should have gone for the dark blue. It was too late now anyway, he was here and he couldn’t as well go shirtless, no matter how much he might like Harry to run his hands down his chest. Draco rolled his eyes but couldn’t help smiling. He had only met the man three days ago but he was all he had been able to think about. Yes his glasses were tacky, yes his hair looked like a flock of birds had nested in it and yes he was awkward but surprisingly none of that bothered Draco. His mind was too focused on those enchantingly green eyes and that easy smile that graced his face when he was somewhat comfortable. Draco wished he could see that smile more and that’s partly the reason he was here. Well ok, a lot of the reason. But don’t ask him he would never admit it. Taking another breath and deciding he had been standing outside long enough Draco made the move to open the door. It wasn’t like him to get nervous or excited about another person but he had never met anyone like Harry.
The church smelled like worn wood and old books, like the Hogwarts library in its silence and musty scent. Harry tipped his head back to stare at the vaulted ceiling that seemed to go up and up into endless darkness, strongly reminded of the Great Hall and its charmed ceiling. The way it had looked in third year, laying in a sleeping bag on the hard stone floor, staring up at the illusory night. Every sound seemed to echo like it did then, too, and Harry had to work to fight off the memories.

“Oh, now that
He walked Draco over to a large, metal chair, with chains dangling from the back and arms. It looked exactly like the chair on the floor of Courtroom Ten, and he shut his eyes against the image, bracing himself against the chains that bound him the moment he was sat down. It wasn’t necessary, with Lucius’ wand aimed resolutely at Draco’s head. Lucius was pulling the strings, and Draco was powerless to do anything but go along with it.
“Lucius tried to murder me when I was
They walked over to the shed, putting away their brooms, before returning to the house.
Hermione grimaced in distaste. “Understandable, Müller is so…
Harry bit his lip, and started writing.
“You may feel like someone’s standing right behind you, looking over your shoulder.”
“You said you had news, too,” Ron prodded, dusting crumbs off of a thin file on his desk. Harry couldn’t help but glance at it:
Ron stared at him, dumbstruck. “Protocol,” he mumbled, as if it was just a word he had to say before breaking the rules. Harry raised an eyebrow, waving his hands at himself to prove his point:
Draco didn’t know how long they sat there, watching each other, assessing each other, until Draco finally remembered himself enough to say, “Thank you,” and his voice came out hoarser than he’d liked, but he wasn’t going to repeat himself. Harry gave a quick nod and grabbed his notebook again, and Draco took the time he was writing to take inventory of himself. Thighs, hair, scar, Mark, Harry’s handprints, thighs, hair, scar, fingers, Mark, Draco, Harry’s magic, Draco.
“Thank you for your time, Healer Malfoy,” Shacklebolt nodded. Draco returned it shortly.
Draco pulled his head out of the fire, comfortably back on his own body, and stood up, stretching his sore back and legs. He really needed to update the cushioning charms on the floor in front of the grate. He turned and walked to his study to pen a vague, disappointing letter to the Head Auror.
Harry wouldn’t shake his hand, so Draco had threatened him with
Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out the photograph he’d stolen from Narcissa. He felt a little bad—its edges were touch-worn, the crease in the middle cutting Draco’s body in half. But Harry couldn’t help himself, sometimes.
they said, in a tone that told Harry they were not sorry at all,
He sent an apologetic thought to Timsy, who’d have to clean up the mess of expensive clothes strewn around his room. Draco planned to stop at their favourite bakery on the way home for the baklava Timsy loved, to make up for it.
He stepped back, stuffing his hands in his pockets, finding smooth, round eucalyptus leaves under his fingers. Draco let himself into the room and closed the door without another word, leaving Harry alone in the bustling corridor.
“That’s wonderful, Timsy. What’s in the bag?”
The protective potions he’d taken felt like ice in his veins, but his core was burning, like he was carrying the sun in his gut. It was impossible to hold. He wasn’t made for this. He wasn’t big enough or strong enough for this.
“I’m afraid you’ve trapped me here, Harry,” Draco mumbled, wiggling slightly in Harry’s arms to prove his point. Harry tightened them.
“She’s alive, Weasley,” Malfoy interrupted quietly, his face hidden.
Hannah stepped up without hesitation, though she obviously had a million questions. She rolled up her sleeves and flicked her wand out of a forearm holster, casting more diagnostics.
these days, when he wanted to be alone. When he felt too much like the outcast he was.
Couldn’t be helped.
Draco sat leaning against the stone wall of the cell. He didn’t know how long he’d been here—he hadn’t even needed to eat or drink or use the loo. There must have been charms on the cell preventing the immediate need for those sorts of luxuries.
dancing with me. You won’t even have to talk to a snake this time, lucky you.” Draco’s shoulders were shaking with suppressed laughter at the dismay and fear on Harry’s face, mixed with the furious blush creeping up his cheeks.
did you?”
“Why do you need to remember it? It’s already there, for you to read, no matter how many times you forget.”
The Hall of Prophecy was exactly how Harry remembered it, with its huge cathedral ceilings and towering shelves of dusty, glowing spheres. He felt overwhelmed with memories, of his friends tensing for battle around him, of Bellatrix’s cruel laughter—
She accidentally fell asleep on his shoulder, so Willem leaned his head back on the sofa and fell asleep, too. Harry took the armchair-cot, missing Draco so much it physically hurt.
Harry listened intently, his body thrumming with suspicion and rage and determination—a familiar mix of emotions around Draco Malfoy, but that wasn’t right, it
Harry looked pleased with Draco’s concession. He gave Draco a small smile, and wrote quickly.
It was everything Harry had ever pictured when he imagined

Malfoy looked slightly nervous, but he still held himself with confidence. Harry knew he didn’t
could only be solved by a Legilimens who would be able to see the right memories and follow the trail?” Ron asked, and Draco could tell he was several moves ahead, in his mind. Draco glanced at Harry, who was still looking cautious, where he sat on a large pouf on the floor next to Draco’s armchair. His head was only inches from Draco’s hand, which itched to reach out and touch that tumultuous hair, just to see if it was as soft as it looked. He clenched his fist on the armrest.
“You look like you’re in pain,” Draco remarked. “If I hurt you, I need to know.”
But Draco was a Healer, albeit an unconventional and very niche one, and he had an obligation to help when he was needed. Yes, it felt great having Weasley beg for his help. He wished he’d done it at a more reasonable time of day, but still, you can’t choose your beggars… or whatever that muggle saying is. Draco had known as soon as he let Weasley inside that he would help. The fact that
Draco toed off his shoes and tucked his feet up under him on the chair, sipping his hot chocolate. Harry had never seen him so relaxed—he wanted Draco to feel that way around him all the time. It felt like such an honour, a privilege.
“He’s a very charming boy,” he remarked. “My mother is smitten.”
That hadn’t gone well, then.
“I know. That elf doesn’t know when to keep his mouth shut.”

Draco thought, again.
“And if a Potter-themed Quidditch team is what you want, you
“You’d better.”
Harry did not hesitate before walking over to the corner and crouching down on one knee in front of Timsy’s small figure, his eyes level with Timsy’s wrinkled, anxious face. Timsy was clutching nervously at the sleeves of his green jumper, clearly uncomfortable. Harry pulled his wand out of its thigh holster and held it out for Timsy, hilt first. Timsy’s already huge eyes were nearly bulging with anxiety and disbelief.
“Harry,” Draco tried, lowering his voice and moving his head a little to the side to meet his eyes. “Are you nervous about the memories themselves—” he held up his index finger, “—or my control of how we view them?” He held up his middle finger next to the first.
The loud rumbling of the bike drowned out most of Draco’s nervous, prickly complaints. Harry slowed to a stop in front of Dudley’s modest home, hearing the sound of Pink Floyd coming from somewhere behind it.
“My mother is all I have, Harry,” he mumbled.
The glow of the breadcrumb disappeared as it passed, and Draco withdrew calmly, aiming his wand at the chalkboard and labeling a new dot “Hedwig/Moody”. Vague, but just specific enough. The only thing that connected those two beings was that they were Harry’s friends, and they had apparently been murdered on the same night.
Out with it.”
No child deserves to be treated that way.
Harry dropped one of Draco's legs to grab his wand, his breaths harsh and laboured and feral, and when he Apparated, Draco realized that was the only sound he'd heard throughout their entire escape.
“Then what
He just hadn’t felt right since the tap in Prague. He hadn’t felt right since January, honestly, and he definitely hadn’t felt right at all during this… quest. But he was now being hit with sudden, debilitating cramps and cold sweats, and he wondered if his body was finally giving up, unable to withstand all the excess magic and the fucking
is how they’ve been using their freedom, I’ll enjoy watching it burn.”
And getting warmer. Or was that just his arms? No, it was both. Draco felt warmth building in the veins of his wrists, and following his bloodstream up his arms. He looked up at Harry’s face, which was pinched in concentration, his eyes firmly shut. When he looked back down at his arms, he thought he could see a soft, pinkish glow, like a horizon just before dawn, where Harry’s fingers met his skin.
Once they were safely ensconced back in their wingback chairs by the fire, Harry looking much more relaxed having flown and eaten, Draco picked up his notebook.
“Well, good on you, Harry, for apparently being a kisser worth enduring a Cruciatus for,” Ron declared, throwing his hands up in vexation. Harry suppressed a wave of nausea at the thought of causing Draco so much pain. Things ostensibly went a little haywire, when Harry did what he

But he didn’t want Harry to see him lie. Harry trusted his friends, and he trusted Draco, and he wouldn’t

Weasley had his hands in his hair again, but seemed to heed the clear direction as he looked at Draco with blue eyes that Draco could only describe as pleading.
It had caused him some unease, at first, until he realized the things he observed weren’t anything he felt inclined to share, anyway. Simply because they were, in every sense of the word,

with Harry.
Alone, as expected.
“That would explain why Lucius wants anything to do with him,” Parkinson chimed in, still glaring fiercely at the room. “If Draco was a weapon of some sort, Lucius would either feel threatened by him or want to use him to his own advantage, probably both.”
Looking outside, Draco saw a thick coat of fog on the ground. It would probably be chilly. He frowned, thinking. “Timsy,” he called.
“A classic, sure, just like that obscure Norah Jones song about his Patronus was a
Harry looked at Ron, who was looking back at him as if he had come to the same conclusion. Ron lowered his wand and stepped back.
He was, to his dismay,

He walked down to the shore, staring at the sea. He breathed in one last lungful of salty air, letting it fill him up, and apparated straight to the Ministry.
“‘Lo, Father,” Draco said, slowly moving his body out from the wall, putting himself between the boy Seer and the worst living man he knew. He heard Boran’s quiet gasp from behind him. “See you’ve been busy.”
Teddy schooled his little face into a serious expression, and thrust out his hand. Andromeda discreetly cast a cleaning charm on it from under the table. “Pleasure to meet you,” he spoke clearly, in his best efforts at maturity, and Draco was terribly endeared. He took Teddy’s hand and shook it gently.
what Draco would be dragging up?
Draco pulled him in by the platinum chain around his neck, holding the key in his fist. He kissed him hard, and Harry swallowed his growl of hurt and frustration, allowing Draco to roll them over again.
Metal and flint,
Hermione closed her mouth, mollified, but still disgruntled. Draco checked his watch and groaned internally at the lateness of the hour. Now would be a great time to escape.
Potter arrives bubbly and bold, his laughter loud and his smile bright, surrounded by fiery, exuberant gingers, the intensity and colour in the base of a flame. One firewhisky in, he’s deflecting attention, diverting conversation away from himself. Two, he’s tapping his fingers, bouncing his leg, his eyes darting around the pub, occasionally landing on Draco. Three, he’s staring at either the wood grain of the sticky table, or whichever sorry sod is staring at him from the bar—never Draco. Four, he’s standing from the booth, knocking back the drink, and walking either out the door, or over to the bar, where this week’s loser waits with hungry eyes.
Weasley sobered quickly, clearing his throat. “Right. It’s Harry.”

“I want to stop this interrogation, because it feels like the Aurors, again. I want to sleep off the Veritaserum. I want to drink Timsy’s hot chocolate.”
“You sure?”
“What about it?”
Harry put his pen back on the paper.
“My sources tell me Potter has only become political in the last few years, making things

Draco stiffened when Harry closed the French doors behind him, isolating them from the noise of their coworkers. His crisp suit carved a severe silhouette against the glittering London skyline, all knife-edged black with a glint of silky, white-blond hair falling over his shoulders. His slim, pale hands gripped the stone bannister, his shoulders hunched and defensive. He didn’t look up.
“No fucking way,” she said indignantly. “That absolute
“I know,” Harry replied, his other hand quickly palming his wand, forcefully apparating them both to Grimmauld Place.
But Harry didn’t stop worrying. She wasn’t herself—the Narcissa he remembered from his teenage years, haughty and fearless—she was quiet, and shy, and fragile. Harry caught fleeting glimpses of the former Narcissa on occasion, whenever he said something stupid, when she’d roll her eyes at him or flick him on the head.
When Harry woke again, it was night, and he was soaking wet.
“Ah,” Draco said, giving a sly smile. “You think you’ll be beating me on my own school broom, don’t you? We’ll see.” He picked up his Comet
Potter looked uncomfortable. Draco decided to come back to that later, but first, he needed to know something.
“N—” The potion stopped him again. “Yes,” Draco said. “I know there was a prophecy that named you as the one who could kill Voldemort, but I don’t know exactly what it said. I don’t know of any others.”
“I know.”
Harry was writing again, shaking his head vehemently.
Draco didn’t see any more of the silvery glow he was looking for, so he pulled back slowly, all the way out of Harry’s head. He pointed his wand at the chalkboard, added another dot labeled “Snake Enclosure,” and another dot after that. Draco frowned as he tried to figure out how to label
He felt Narcissa’s vigilance, and remembered that he wasn’t alone.
His face popped up in another fireplace, and Draco recognized the office of the Minister for Magic. Shacklebolt was sitting at his large desk, writing something with a long quill. Draco internally thanked him for the full floo access, and cheered that he’d got him at a time when he wasn’t too busy, doing Minister things.
Draco furrowed his brows. Harry was looking at him with… concern? He couldn’t really tell. “No, it doesn’t hurt me, either. But your memories are very vibrant, you feel things very intensely. It’s a lot to handle, at first, but I’ll get used to it.”
Parkinson whispered, swishing her own wand with her free hand. The spell lit up not only Timsy, who was holding on to her sleeve, but every globe in the room. Apparently, the model planets were somehow
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, because he was. He really was. Draco growled in frustration,

good kiss, but he eventually made this odd noise so I stopped and he doubled over, he looked really ill, I thought he was just really regretting it or something, or that I’d—”
Draco looked at the outstretched hand in barely concealed wonder. Oh, what his twelve-year-old self would say if he saw
When he’d finally acquired the conciliatory bubble tea, full bag of scrunchies in hand, he steeled himself and apparated home.
“Where’s Draco?” Harry asked, poking his head into the library. He’d looked all over the Manor, with no luck.
Harry sighed heavily. “I’m rich too, Draco, but you don’t hear me complaining.”
Memory-Harry slurred, shaking his head slowly, regretting it as he squeezed his eyes shut against a wave of nausea. Harry felt himself sweat outside of his head, in his own, present-day body. Of all the things to relive.
Timsy looked down, defeated. He was standing in a corner of the room, next to a defensive looking Pansy Parkinson. “Timsy is trying, but Master Draco’s magic is being quiet, delicate, not as loud as Harry Potter’s. Timsy cannot find him the way he is finding Harry Potter.”
As they landed in their own bodies outside of the Pensieve, Draco laughed. Harry joined him, laughing silently with bright, wet eyes, watching Draco. Draco felt something cold on his cheek, and wiped at it absently—a tear. Oh, well.
“I don’t understand why you would do that,” he muttered, shaking his head faintly, bumping Harry’s nose. “It doesn’t seem real. None of this feels real. Why would you do such a thing?”
to brew—” Hermione noted.
“We’re pretending.”
The meditation calmed his racing heart a little. Draco leaned forward, raised his wand, and cast.
“Perhaps,” Draco replied, deep in thought.
The narcissus flowers were blooming again, as well as several other varieties of flora, and Harry grinned at the memory of Draco awkwardly carrying a bundle of blooms, with dirt on the knees of his expensive, pressed trousers.
Weasley looked relieved, as if he had just remembered this fact. Draco wondered if he knew about Draco’s bonds, working for the Ministry—the licenses were public records. “Right. Well, thank you. We’ll see you later today then, Healer Malfoy.” He stuck out his right hand: a peace offering, even though his face twisted a little in what looked like pain.
“Thank you,” he mumbled. “I’m not sure it’s long enough to hold.”
Draco continued glaring at the empty fireplace.
Harry stood up to face the rest of the room, and nearly toppled over at the dizziness the movement caused. He felt two slender hands grip him again as he held his own head in his hand.
Draco clicked his tongue. “I thought that was obvious.”
Before long, he realized the entire shelf, over a hundred stupid spheres, all held his name, and he sighed, suddenly reminded of how often Trelawney had predicted his gruesome death for fun. Of course, the
Harry went for his wand to clean the plate, but of course, it wasn’t in his pocket. Typical.
“You, idiot,” Draco answered. “Why you’re here, what you’re doing. Why you look like
“I’ve told—” Draco’s throat closed up again, and he coughed into his fist. “I…” he stared up at the ceiling, finding his way around this, like a maze. He could do this, he was good at mazes.
“Ron is buying dinner,” he said, frowning at Harry, who only grinned back at him, wicked green eyes sparkling with mischief.
Harry wouldn’t have been able to function properly, as sleep-deprived as Draco knew he was. He’d truly needed the nap. But seeing Harry like this, so peaceful and vulnerable, asleep in Draco’s sitting room, was causing him a sort of discomfort—a pulling, constricting feeling in his chest. Draco couldn’t discern if it was his bonds acting up or not, because he’d felt something like it a couple of times before: after the final task of the TriWizard Tournament, in sixth year after Harry had sliced him open, during the battle when Hagrid had carried Harry’s body, and when Harry had testified for him, to name a few. It wasn’t a feeling he particularly enjoyed. It felt like his chest was being squeezed, it was hard to breathe. It felt like gravity, like magnetism, an inevitable force that was futile to resist, though he had tried. He didn’t understand what it was, he didn’t
His breath quickened as he pulled out the muggle key, turning it over in his hand. It looked like the most commonplace thing, cheap metal with no ornamentation.
ones are complete nutters, I promise you.” He shuddered. “The gossip they come up with… they literally think we’re
Draco leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his lap, forcing himself to slow down and watch Potter for a moment. Potter had noticed that Draco wasn’t drinking coffee with him, which had apparently made him suspicious. He took out his wand and proceeded to check his coffee for poisons. Draco tried not to sigh.
The door closed behind them, throwing the empty common room into a tense silence. It took about seven seconds for Draco to break.
“Sandwich?” Ron pleaded in a small voice. Harry shook his head.
Malfoy furrowed his brows. “Is that what Severus did? That’s practically barbaric,” he muttered.
“So, we want to get the memories of the pub for Weasley by the end of the day. That means I’ll start with the introductory Legilimency, getting you accustomed to it, we’ll spend some time getting acquainted with the process. Every mind is different, and it takes some getting used to for me, as well,” Draco explained, while Harry listened intently, rubbing the leather on the arms of his chair with his hands. Draco spotted thin, jagged scars on the back of his right hand, that looked like words. Curious.
He should have seen that coming. He knew only the basics of human anatomy, only what Hermione had made him study before leaving.
Potter,” Draco grumbled.

“Well, I did,” Malfoy corrected, a little awkward. “She was wandless, they didn’t let her near—here. She’d prepare it, in secret, and I’d deliver it.”

Draco chuckled. “Absolutely. Isn’t it difficult to get it, though, from across the ocean? How do they do it?”
“Er…”
Potter looks like he’s barely tolerating this slimy bloke, just enough that Draco knows he’ll go home with him anyway. And Draco will go home alone, as per usual. Pansy would say that’s because he has

The memory ended, and Harry returned to his body, straightening up next to the Pensieve. He stared at the swirling, glowing memory, his mind racing.
here because I want to be,” he said. “I thought that was obvious.”
“Fine,” Scorpius grumbled, but Draco heard the rustle again as he obviously scooted closer, the movement of paper as he spread the book out for the both of them, and started to read.
Harry gazed upon the plethora of glittering vials, the thousands of glowing memories dancing inside them, trying to get back to him.
“Hi, Uncle Draco.”
“You’ve performed a miracle, boy,” he said. Harry rolled his eyes, reluctantly pleased; Narcissa let out a soft huff.
He stepped out of his trousers and climbed into his luxurious bed, sighing deeply in contentment as he finally got a hand on himself, a shiver of pleasure and relief rolling through him. It still felt like he was getting away with something, thinking of Harry’s solid weight on top of him, his wicked smirk, his brilliant green eyes full of challenge.
Now, Draco was remembering that this child was in a cell, imprisoned, with him, because of his father. His smile fell.
“Merlin, Harry, you’re even a Scarhead in your subconscious mind,” he teased. “Do you ever catch a break?”
if he was watching Draco because someone told him to, or just because he wanted to, because he couldn’t look away. He didn’t know when the switch had been made, if it had ever been a switch at all.
“Like I said, makes for an excellent homicide, very clean cut—”
Love,
Smith’s eyes widened. “Minister,” he said politely through a clenched jaw. “Leash your
“I’ll tell him,” Harry promised, “but I need Ron here to watch her. Please believe me when I say she’s in danger, no matter how secure this place is.”
He opened his eyes to see Harry, standing a couple feet away from him, staring at him with frightened eyes that searched Draco’s body frantically, his fingers absently touching his own lips, as if he couldn’t believe what had just happened. Draco wouldn’t have believed it either, if it wasn’t for the winded, battered feeling his bonds had left him in, so close to a Cruciatus. That kiss may have been a dream, but the pain was unforgettable, and definitely real.
Harry was a little touch starved and Draco was touchy, it
But other than that? Same git, with less blood purist slurs.
“I would love to,” He said and then smiled wider than he thought he’s ever smiled before.
“I’m glad you’re the owner because I do require some assistance. I am looking for a plant for my mother.” In Harry’s opinion his voice was like silk, it matched his appearance perfectly. His nose was straight and pointed and from this angle his cheekbones dominated his facial features. His lips were a light pink and slender but not too thin. His eyelashes were long and full and Harry could feel his eyes roaming over the stranger’s face. Then the man’s mouth turned into a scowl and his brows drew down. “Are you quite done staring at me?” He asked in a rough drawl and Harry felt himself turn crimson as he averted his gaze.
“I’m in no rush, just show me your selection,” he made it sound more demanding than anything and Harry looked put out that he had to comply. He sighed and seemed to think it over for a moment before he stepped around the counter.
“Hi, I’m Harry one of the owners of the shop, is there anything I can help you with?” Harry hoped he didn’t sound breathless and he could feel himself staring but couldn’t seem to stop. The man in front of him relaxed his features and his face became a cool mask.
“No, I was just, I mean you got your plant so I thought you weren’t coming back,” Harry mumbled the last part, almost to himself but Draco caught it and smirked again. Harry looked up suddenly with determination in his eyes and made contact with Draco’s. “If there was a problem with the plant or you were dissatisfied with it I can help you look for another one but I will need the one you purchased returned.” Draco could tell Harry was trying his best to be professional and confident but he had no idea just how Draco could tear that all down. Draco knew the moment he got up in Harry’s space three days ago that Harry clearly felt something for him and he was determined to bring it out into the daylight.
“As a matter of fact I do, and I would like them to know that I wish to pursue something with them,” Draco said in a light and airy tone, acting as if he didn’t notice that each word caused Harry to scrunch up his features more and more. Draco paused and Harry turned his head.
“I mean, yes I think I can help you. What, um, what did you need?” Draco could tell Harry was trying to be confident and professional again and Draco admired his spirit.
“H-Harry,” He murmured and the man just smirked wider. Then he leaned back and Harry almost groaned at the loss of proximity. But before he could ponder on it the man stuck his hand out, firm and strong.
“$1500!” He exclaimed and looked at the man with wide eyes. The man however did not seem perturbed in the slightest and simply reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet.
Hi everyone it's me majestixia!!
“Great! I mean, uh, lets take a look shall we?” With that Harry turned in an effort to hide his blush that he could just feel taking over his face. He walked to the counter and turned to the man, “I’ll be out in a minute, um, just don’t go anywhere,” Harry could have slapped himself for saying something so pathetic but instead of giving the man time to realise what an idiot Harry was he quickly dashed behind the counter and into the back of the store. As soon as he was out of sight he leaned against the wall and put a hand to his heart. It was beating erratically and Harry didn’t even have to touch his cheeks to know his face was red hot. He closed his eyes but all he could see was that man’s strong figure, his perfectly angular face and those damned eyes that looked like pure starlight. Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands. He had never gotten a crush on someone he had hardly met before but he could feel one quickly developing. He shook his head and opened his eyes. He had to be professional about this, even if he just wanted to smack a kiss on those perfect lips of Mr Strong-and-Perfect. Harry scanned the room and found the plants and put them on a tray and walked out, ignoring his shaking legs.
Hope you enjoyed!
Harry stared for a few moments more before something in his expression shifted and all emotion drained from him. He awkwardly pushed the plant into Draco’s hands, as if it had burnt him, and he shifted his gaze away but he couldn’t help the flush that rose on his cheeks Draco noticed. Draco didn’t press him but simply gave him a disarming smile that forced Harry to look down. “Lets ring this up, shall we?” He said casually, as if a heated and intimate moment hadn’t just passed between them. Harry nodded stiffly and led them back. When he reached the counter he looked at Draco with those same emotionless eyes and Draco had to hide his smug grin. Harry scanned the plant without a word and then stiffly listed off the price. Draco reached into his pocket and took out some cash and held it out. Harry went to take it but when he did Draco suddenly moved his hand forward so their fingers came into contact. Harry’s breath hitched but he didn’t move his hand. He looked up at Draco and Draco stared right back. Harry though came to his senses quickly and cleared his throat before taking the money and rather violently putting it in the register. He shut the register with more force than necessary and when that was done he started scraping his nail along the wood of the counter. He cleared his throat again before speaking.
“Is that how you greet all your recurring guests?” His voice drawled out smooth and silky and he cocked his head lightly for effect. Harry finally broke eye contact and looked down at his feet and shuffled slightly.
“Draco Malfoy,” He said and Harry just looked at his hand for a moment before putting his hand in it. It was strong and slim and slightly cool and soft and just utter perfection. Too soon the handshake ended and Harry felt the loss of contact in his soul. The man looked Harry up and down one last time before turning and walking towards the door. It was only when the bell rang that Harry registered what had happened. He slumped and lay his forearms on the counter and let his head hang and he released a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding in. God almighty, what a man. Draco. Draco. Draco. He could just imagine moaning his name during sex. Harry groaned. He didn’t know if it was possible but he thinks he just fell in love with a stranger.
“What’s your name?” His voice was low and rough and Harry almost melted to the floor. He swallowed and hoped his voice wasn’t as weak as his legs felt.
The stranger raised an eyebrow and Harry realised he hadn’t said anything. “Look, to be honest, I’m just replacing my colleague who knows all the plant stuff, I don’t really know much,” he gave an awkward chuckle and shuffled his feet. The man simply looked him up and down with those moonlit eyes of his and it made Harry shiver. He wondered if he would look at him like that if he were naked. Harry was caught back by the thought, where did that come from? The man suddenly turning interrupted Harry from his musings.
Draco handed him the rose and Harry took it, his hand trembling slightly. He looked up at Draco in awe and Draco chuckled then ran the backs of his fingers down Harry’s cheek. He grabbed Harry’s free hand and held it in his and Harry couldn’t help thinking that their hands fit so perfectly together. Then Draco spoke, “Harry, would you do me the pleasure of going on a date with me? And then another, and another, and another until you are utterly and completely mine?” His voice was as always smooth as silk, yet Harry could hear the slight nervousness in it. Harry nodded and cleared his throat before replying.
“W-what? Handsome? You think I’m handsome?!” Harry was looking at Draco with wide eyes now and his face fully bathed in a red flush. Draco simply smirked and leaned his forearms on the counter between them, bringing them significantly closer together.
“I think mother will be very pleased with this. If you could ring this up for me I would be very grateful.” He placed the plant on the counter and Harry fumbled for the scanner. He scanned it and his eyes almost popped out of his head when he saw the price.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, you fancy someone?” Harry asked but his tone was dead and deflated and Draco didn’t think Harry could help the disappointment that marred his face. Draco looked down to hide his smile and quickly arranged his features so he looked innocent.
“Well, I’m glad I could help you Mr Malfoy and I wish you all the luck with your future plans,” he wasn’t looking at Draco but all his emotion came through in his voice. He sounded defeated and hopeless and crushed and Draco wanted more than anything to grab his face and smash their lips together, but he had to be smart. So instead he simply lifted a hand and placed it under Harry’s chin and lifted the other man’s head to look him in the eye. Harry was shocked and just stared at Draco in question. Draco let his gaze roam over Harry’s features, so strong and beautiful and pure, before finally staring him in the eye.
Five minutes later the door to the shop opened and the bell tingled. Harry looked up from his counter in confusion. He was sure that he had flipped the sign. He went towards the door but no one was there. Feeling a trickle of fear he cleared his throat before saying loudly “Hello?” there was no sound or answer so he tried again. “Hello, is anyone there?” He was starting to feel panic and just as he was about to turn around a hand came over his eyes and an arm came around his chest and pushed him flush against a body behind him. He was seconds away from screaming when a voice whispered in his ear.
“Alright, I guess it’s worth seeing what you have.” Harry felt his heart leap into his throat and he couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face.
Harry turned the sign on the door so that it read ‘closed’ and walked back to the counter. He started tidying up, all with a frown on his face. It had been three days since his encounter with Draco Malfoy and he was still upset about it. He had never thought about his sexuality before but now he was certain that he must be gay or something because every time he thought of Draco butterflies would erupt in his stomach and desire would flame up deep inside him. He had never in his life felt like this before; it was like a crush only a thousand times worse because everything was so damn intense. But of course none of it mattered because Draco liked someone else. Of course he did! Why would a god like Draco go for someone like him? He was awkward and shy and had a traumatic past. Harry swore and slammed the cash register shut. He had felt rotten these past few days and it wasn’t getting any better. Draco was probably fucking the brains out of some model and here he was, alone and bitter. Harry sighed and rubbed his face. It wouldn’t do to keep dwelling and feeling like this, he needed to get over it. He gently opened the cash register and resumed his counting.
and then spend all day lazing about in a pile of them?” Snapping his mouth shut, Draco took a frantic breath in through his nose. He hadn’t known those were the words sitting on the tip of his tongue.
“It’s rude to generalize, Ron,” Hermione said absently, ignoring them all in favour of catching up on the reading material she’d missed. Even after two and a half degrees, she still couldn’t help immersing herself in a problem by
“I’ll take that, thank you,” he said, holding out his hand. He wouldn’t put it past the Unspeakables to send cursed mail.
Is that what you mean?”
“You did,” Harry replied, matter-of-fact, crossing his arms. Kingsley looked uncomfortable, but continued.
Harry seemed appalled that Draco had answered truthfully. His shock was evident on his face, his hand still holding the pen, still held carefully over the notebook, as if he’d forgotten it was there.
Potter?”
Harry furrowed his brows. That surely couldn’t be true. He’d get a trial or something, an investigation.
Draco waited a moment more, watching and experiencing Harry’s magic swirling around him, relishing in its warmth and energy, before closing it off, allowing his head to clear.
Harry set his notebook in his lap and looked at Draco expectantly. Draco sighed, watching Harry with wary eyes, and let his reactions trickle through slowly.
When Harry apparated in on Thursday, Draco was already in the front garden, helping Timsy pick Narcissus flowers for the house. The garden was nearly overrun with them, this time of year, which Draco loved. Timsy normally never needed help with this, but Draco hadn’t questioned it when Timsy had muttered, “Master Draco should be enjoying the sunshine before his guest arrives, Master Draco should pick some of the flowers for the house, he should, it is being good for him,” with an odd gleam in his eye. Draco hated denying him anything.
Harry saw Malfoy’s eyes flash, and was reluctantly impressed with his professionalism—he could tell he’d
It wasn’t
Draco thanked Timsy as he served them and returned to the kitchen, softly muttering about manners and cleanliness. Draco tried to keep the amused fondness out of his eyes, but according to Harry’s thoughtful look, he wasn’t successful.
Camila’s eyes darted nervously to Harry and back, before she cupped her little hand around Draco’s ear, bringing her face close to share a secret.
“Do you hear them?” she asked. Harry’s face hardened.
A cell wasn’t ideal, but bloody
“Wand, please,” the young, sleepy looking wizard at the desk held out his hand mechanically as Draco approached, not even looking up. Draco handed over his wand with only minute hesitation.
Pansy’s house was smaller than Draco’s, but no less elegant. It was just enough room for her and Camila, and she liked it that way.

“Malfoy,” he greeted, still grinning. Draco had no idea what was worth smiling about. “Come on in.”
Harry’s eyes were wide, red and shiny, watching Draco anxiously. He probably hadn’t wanted Draco to see that at all, but he had to. Harry’s hands were shaking in his lap, clenching and unclenching his fists, and the muscles in his shoulders were tense and bunched under his t-shirt. Draco instinctively started to reach out to him again—he inhaled sharply as he noticed it happening, and pulled his hands back to his own lap.
“Come to bed,” he muttered into Harry’s hair. “And let yourself sleep, this time. No need to play watchdog.”

torn.
Harry started to nod, but stopped himself, as if he had just remembered something. The colour drained from his face. He grabbed his notebook, writing again.

He holds out his hand, and Potter hands over the cig with a smirk. Draco holds it between two fingers and takes a long, soothing drag.
Harry’s eyes were widening, his hand tightening on the mug of too-sweet tea in front of him.
Potter scrubbed his hand through his hair, causing it to curl back from his forehead in what should not be an attractive way. How could anyone look that good with such illogical, untameable hair? His hand came down to rub over his jaw as he turned his calculating gaze to his friends. They were quiet, recognizing that he was in the process of making a decision. The room was silent but for the soft sound of Potter’s calloused fingers absently rubbing over his stubble.
“Yes, we had the wrong rune translation, in an alternate interpretation this one, here, is actually a
“Was that the first time you… you made the choice to spare someone’s life, even though they didn’t deserve it?” Draco asked.
uncomfortable, knowing that Draco’s mother was aware of his every thought. He tried not to think about it. He tried not to think at all, but that was impossible, with Draco around.
is, will.”
As they’d stood there in the graveyard, the mourners of Colin Creevey slowly dissipating, Harry wouldn’t move. He’d stared unseeing at the freshly turned earth, his hands limp at his sides, oblivious to Draco’s soft murmuring, to the gentle grip on his hand. Draco couldn’t stand it, the dullness of his green eyes, the lifelessness of what was once such a bold and vibrant boy.
Draco’s primary thought when decorating his house was that wherever he imagined Lucius would have displayed a Dark artifact, or token of pureblood ancestry, Draco would put a plant instead. The effect was that his house seemed like a bit of a jungle, at times, and Timsy had his hands full with plant care most of the time.
Draco’s face contorted with conflicting emotion. “I don’t.”
Draco retreated from Harry’s head as the glow subsided and the memory passed. He pointed his wand at the board, labeling a new dot “R&H Expecting”.
He collapsed back onto the bed and fell asleep immediately, awash with relief.
you would not believe…”
“Good to see you, too, Harry. Mind telling me what the hell that was about?”
“Master Draco is being here,” he finally croaked, and Harry’s heart leapt, then dropped again at what that meant.
“Yes, yes, oh how pureblood training has benefited me. It’s not hard, you know. It’s like learning to fly, or dueling—without all the antagonism or danger.”
Harry sighed, relieved that his friends were finally on board, that he wasn’t alone in the dark anymore. They nodded at him, and he flicked his wand to dispel the
And Ronald “Cockblock” Weasley was on his way, with curry.
Harry shook his head again, that incredible smile stuck on his face, and grabbed his notebook to write.
He found his shelf with practiced ease—it wasn’t labeled, none of them were. He’d never met anyone else with his job title. He didn’t know what any of the other Unspeakables did, he didn’t know their names, he never even saw them if they could help it. That was intentional, on everyone’s part.
Draco mumbled, grinning slyly as he looked back at his father. “A Fidelius Charm.”
hair. And I bet your husband will love them, too.”
“Oh, you like the lemon?” Draco asked, filling Harry’s glass as he nodded with a small smile. “Well, good to know. Let’s get into some more breathwork, and then resume our efforts.”
Ron raised his eyebrows, eyeing the scroll that Harry was
Draco pushed gently with his magic, searching. It felt a bit like flipping through his records, or a photo album, until—
“You may still be tired from earlier, so it’s alright if you can’t control your thoughts as well. Don’t overextend yourself,” Draco said, eyes closed, hands on his knees, breathing deeply. He didn’t have to see Harry to know he was doing the same, nor did he need to see Harry nod to acknowledge Draco’s prefacing.
“Thank Merlin for that,” Draco muttered.
On Monday morning, Draco stood in front of his music shelf in the sitting room, rubbing his chin, scowling at the boombox again. Harry’s cassette tape sat innocuously on the shelf, and Draco was dying to know what music Harry thought he would like. The curiosity was quickly overtaking his self-preservation, which was probably what Pansy had been counting on. If this thing exploded on him, he would be blaming her entirely—she’d definitely have to reimburse him for the damage, or buy him more records, or something. It’d be worth it, to her, the devious cow.
Draco, inexplicably, smiled at him. Harry’s heart stopped, then kickstarted again, pumping all of his blood to his cheeks.
Harry didn’t know at what point in the last four months he’d fallen in love with Draco Malfoy, but it wasn’t important. Not nearly as important as the conviction settling in his bones, or the pained adoration he felt pouring from Draco’s caressing fingertips.
Timsy opened the door and stepped aside to let him in, greeting him politely in his raspy voice and hanging up Harry’s leather jacket. Harry wished he could greet him back. He felt
“I won’t. Serves him right.” Smith inhaled sharply as the wand began to singe his neck. “I couldn’t, even if I wanted to, Potter. It’d require multiple Licensers, and I’m obviously the only one in today.”
least
“Of course,” Harry mumbled, “extra mayo and mustard, no tomatoes, as always.” It was actually the standard amount of mayo and mustard, and Harry had just plucked the tomatoes to insert into his own sandwich. As always. He hated bothering the canteen staff more than he had to, or being in there longer than he had to. Merlin, the
. Harry kissed him with everything he wished he’d been giving him for the last six months, one hand curled tight around Draco’s fist, the other returning home to the back of Draco’s neck. They fit together as easily as Harry’s key had fit in Draco’s front door. Harry kissed salty tears off his lips, his cheeks, the scar on his jawbone, making up for a lifetime of lost time. He kissed him like he’d die if he didn’t—it sure felt like he would, it had felt that way for six long, lonely months.
Draco snarled. “I
“Now, if I’m right, and I know what that theory sounds like, you’re probably thinking I had something to do with whoever cursed you, that I made them do it, or something, to make you come to me. I know I told you on Monday that I’d always wanted an opportunity for us to get to know each other properly, but never thought I would actually get it. I know it probably wouldn’t even surprise you if I did have something to do with it. It’s what you’d expect from me, it’s what the world expects from a Malfoy, and if you were to accuse me, no one would question it.”
Once past the front gate, Draco turned around, raised his hand and wand, and proceeded to cast some of the most beautiful wards Harry had ever seen, chanting softly in Latin, his eyes closed in concentration.
Harry’s faded Weird Sisters t-shirt was a little short on him. It rode up any time Draco lifted his arms over his head, exposing a smooth, pale stomach. An enticing trail of dark blond hair led down from his navel, disappearing under the cinched waistband of low-slung joggers, too big for Draco’s narrow hips.
He closed the front door quietly behind him, toeing off his boots. Draco wasn’t in the kitchen, or the sitting room; perhaps he was taking a shower. Harry started up the stairs, determinedly fighting off a feeling of dread.
call this?” Harry was smiling that impossibly soft smile he got when Draco accidentally said something sweet, and Draco blamed that specific flash of canine on what he said next.
“Yes, I do know, Scorp,” Harry replied gently. Draco could hear the soft smile in his voice—he ached to see it. “I didn’t know that the letters jump around for you, too. Why do you think I always ask you to read?”
“Yes, we know, you’re the only man in England who can do what you do, Merlin, you’re
“Is that a snake in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?”
Draco sighed and closed his eyes. They were on the precipice, here, of that fragile trust that Draco needed to work, which could only be formed through open, honest conversation. This was always the hardest part, but supposedly, it would be worth it in the end.
“Of being afraid. Of this.”
Harry buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, breathing in the scent he’d longed for for so long. Draco held him tight until he stopped shaking, until his breaths evened out, until he relaxed into Draco’s hold. He pressed his lips into Harry’s hair.
Harry made his choice, then.
“I’m trying—” Draco’s voice was muffled, so Harry pulled his hand away, “—rather admirably, I should say…
—” Harry tried.
Harry still looked perplexed. He pointed to the
Draco still had no clue, after puzzling over it for days. He thought about everything the attacker had said, about how Harry played the part of a hero to appease the masses, and no one really knew anything about him. But so what? So he was a private man, but fulfilled what he probably felt he was obligated to do as a war hero people looked up to. How was that a problem for anyone else? Did they want the spotlight, instead? Did they have some sort of political agenda? Were they just bored of watching Harry play his role?
“Well, Scorpius,” Harry chuckled, “if you one day have The Fellowship of the Ring completely memorized, I’ll be very impressed. But you won’t be able to remember it unless you read it.”
As her echoing vocals faded out, Draco sighed again in satisfaction. He turned his head to the side to look at Harry, who was still sat on the floor, jean-clad legs out in front of him, ridiculous socked-feet crossed at the ankles. His hands were folded in his lap, his back against the shelves, his head tipped back and his eyes closed. He looked peaceful. He looked like how Draco felt.
He remembered Draco, and re-remembered, over and over. The taste of him, the way he moved, the way he held their faces close even when they weren’t kissing. The craving for him, the intoxicating
when no one else really believed him—that Harry had
Malfoy clicked his tongue, in what was clearly false annoyance, if the tender smile was anything to go by. He set aside his book and rolled to face Harry fully, propping himself up on his elbow. His hand came up to Harry’s face again, pulling him in without an ounce of hesitation, and Harry didn’t even have time to be nervous before soft, full lips were on his, making his stomach flutter wildly.
Draco’s traitorous brain supplied again, but he ignored it, determined to prove his point. The song that started playing was nice and slow, anyway, an easy one. He sat up and stood with a swift, graceful movement, and held out his hand.
Harry looked up from his book as the bell above the door chimed. It was raining outside and the soft tapping of the water on the tin roof above his head had lulled him into a state of sleepiness. He stood up straight from his hunched position over the shop counter and stretched his arms above his head, feeling his shirt under his jumper ride up slowly and a cool bit of air tickle his tummy. He couldn’t see who had just walked in to the shop due to the arrangement of apple, plum and peach trees blocking his line of sight to the doorway. It had been a slow day, Harry blamed the weather, and people were less reluctant to go out on a rainy Tuesday. Harry tapped his fingers on the counter and stretched his neck to see if he could find his customer. After a moment of looking he saw a flash of white in between some birch tree saplings and made his way towards to it. He rounded the display of trees and was a bit taken aback at his customer. He was tall, very tall and slim and slender as an elf would be if they existed. He had platinum blonde hair in a shade that Harry thought only existed on models and he was wearing suit pants, pointy shoes, a black button down long sleeve shirt and on top a silver vest also buttoned. His long, slender, pale fingers were holding a pot of bright purple and orange pansies. Harry looked up to his face and his mouth was in a tight frown, his cheekbones looked as sharp as razors and his eyebrows were the same shocking blonde as his hair.
“Well my rose has bloomed so I’m here to give it to the person I fancy,” he whispered low and sultry into Harry’s ear and then he gave Harry a tiny kiss on the neck. Harry felt like his head was about to explode and implode at the same time. So many thoughts were running through his mind he had no idea what to think so he swallowed his confusion and went with the first thing that popped up.
as well as he’d like to.
he was sort of…
Draco looked at her gratefully, and her lip twitched in return. Her eyes were still anxious—she would
“Potter, lie back down. Are you dizzy?” Malfoy asked, and Harry didn’t bother answering as he obeyed. He simply continued staring at Malfoy. He was nicer to look at than anything else in the room, and he was looking at Harry with
“Ready to get to work?” Draco asked. Harry nodded, sitting up properly in his chair. Draco led him through his meditation, even though Harry already seemed plenty calm and content.
Harry curled his hands around Draco’s, following his instincts and bringing them to his mouth to blow warm air over them. They were probably numb, by now.
He sat, stunned, trying to catch up, smearing the floor with bloodied palms.
from it all. “What do you want to know?”
Harry stood on shaky legs, shrunk all of Narcissa’s notes, and stored them away in his pocket. He was just turning to leave when he caught another glimpse of Draco’s bright smile, surrounded by roses.
“But I told you I would be honest with you, in here, and I will be.”
Harry wondered if this was what phoenixes felt like when they burned. The rush, the heat, death and life, life-or-death.
They landed outside the imposing gates of the Manor, under another bright, snowy sky. Draco waved his wand to open the gates; the shimmering wards wavered to let them through.
Draco’s touch felt so tender, almost
Harry’s lips twitched up in what might have been amusement, but he kept his eyes closed, and when Draco moved, Harry followed the steps as he’d been told. His movements were awkward and jerky at first, but after a few bars, Draco noticed he was breathing in time to the music, and his steps became smoother, more natural.
He threw open the door and ran back into the dark, circular entry room. The walls started spinning, and when had he pulled his wand?
Find me on
Harry grinned at him, rolling his eyes again. He made a vague gesture to the other people in the room, then pointed at his mouth.
and he saw how much I hated it all—“
that she’d even allowed Lucius to open his mouth, but he pulled out the chair at the table nonetheless, and took her arm, gently leading her to it.
“I tell people I’m bound by patient confidentiality,” he said slowly, waiting for the harsh twist in his stomach. “I didn’t realize that wasn’t fully understood. I didn’t think it was a big deal—it’s annoying, yes, and painful, sometimes, but the Licensers insisted, and the Minister approved it, and no one questioned it. Now I have a career, doing what I love, what I’m
“Interesting,” Draco mumbled, looking over the top of his glasses at the skeleton map of memories on the board. He twirled a piece of hair around his fingers—soft, thick, platinum, very his. Breathed in, breathed out.
When Harry finally opened his eyes, sitting forward and meeting Draco’s gaze, Draco carefully tucked his whole self behind his barriers, and raised his wand. Harry gave him a short nod.
He’d agonized over which question he would dare to ask Head Unspeakable Kramer today, how he could possibly get the most answers in the fewest words. He leaned in the doorway of Kramer’s office, as uncaring and nonchalant as he normally was.
“Like

“Why do you think I had such good marks in school?” Draco said. “Second-best, of course,” he added in another grumble behind his hand. Harry smirked—he could

needs to be…?” Ron dug his fingers into his hair, his face white with shock. Harry felt faint.
When the green flames had died down in the fireplace, Narcissa turned to Draco, amusement in her eyes.
The circular entry room looked the same as it had earlier, only... stiller. The Aurors spread out along the walls, wands aimed at every door, moving swiftly, in perfect sync. When the door shut behind them, Harry braced himself for the spinning, but the walls remained still. Harry and Ron looked at each other, confused.
“Ron, what’s happening?” Harry asked, his gut churning with foreboding.
“As long as it takes to get results,” he answered, looking annoyed. “I’d hoped it would be more interesting for you. For us both.”
“Mistress Pansy is bringing the muggle device very early,” Timsy croaked. “Mistress is knowing not to wake Master Draco before the sun.”
He was sitting at the end of the bar, his usual seat, closest to the wall. A number of empty glasses sat in front of him, and he was slowly, hazily remembering this night, now that Malfoy had found this Obliviated memory. He didn’t realize he’d drank so much. He never had more than two or three drinks a night, there.
The Warden opened and closed his mouth a few times, before clearing his throat and growling out a quick, “Fine.” He stood abruptly from his desk in an unsubtle attempt to tower over Harry, but his intimidation was ruined when Harry stood as well, emanating the inherent ferocity of someone who’d survived two Killing Curses and four strikes of lightning.
Draco continued his search. Snape’s Occlumency lessons really were useless—did he really think Harry would understand just “disciplining the mind”? Harry had probably never learned anything by following a vague instruction. He was too kinetic, too tactile—he had to see it first, he learned by doing. But Snape hadn’t seemed to care, even though he’d taught Harry for years.
He had all of his memories back.
“Malfoy…?”
Even when you came home exhausted from Draco’s sessions, you were never upset or distressed, you didn’t itch to be
Harry’s eyes were wide. He looked somewhere between afraid and upset. He looked uncomfortable. His eyes were darting around the room, his hand twitching for his wand. Draco’s ears were ringing.
“This is a mirror journal,” he observed, drawing a flaming blush to Harry’s cheeks.
“Let’s go over the book club again,” Hermione said. Ron groaned.
Harry’s fist slammed down hard on the desk, accidentally singeing the wooden surface. “He is
“Granger, I’ll pay you a thousand galleons if you pick up Camila as well,” Parkinson added, making her way towards the floo with Timsy in tow.
Draco expected more questions. He expected magical handcuffs for no reason other than Harry could. He even hoped Harry would just let him go sleep it off. He didn’t expect Harry to lean over and gently pull Draco’s hands away from his waist, curling his palms over the inside of Draco’s wrists, his index fingers pointing up his forearms, inside his shirt cuffs. Draco could feel Harry’s fingers grazing the bottom of the Mark on his left arm, and he was too shocked to do anything but stare. His body was sweating and twitching through the effects of the potion—he knew the convulsions would start soon, he’d probably be incapacitated for the rest of the day.
So, he’d put his wand away. He felt even more alone without it.
Draco looked around the floor and saw his wand laying next to his feet—he had dropped it at some point.
Draco shook his head quickly—no point getting ahead of himself. He summoned his notebook and reading glasses from his desk, and set them on the side table—hopefully he’d have time to update his notes today. He’d fallen asleep directly after their session last time, completely unproductive.
something?”
Harry had that thoughtful look on his face again, and continued writing.
make me read it, Harry.”
“Thank you, Willem, for everything,” Harry said, hoping it conveyed everything he meant. Willem flapped his hand dismissively and stepped back.
The memory ended, and Draco allowed the early memories to flow around each other again. “Alright, Harry, we’ve found the first breadcrumb.” He gently pulled himself out of Harry’s head.
Harry smirked, looking at him with those sad eyes again. He bent over his notebook, writing once more.
Harry hated it.
“Harry, the Licensers insisted—“
Draco might prefer the quill, still. But his birthday was in two days, and Harry liked the idea of Draco having something pretty and nice to remember him by.
Harry looked over each one, running his fingers along the polished wood. He was so
Weasley shook his head, finally looking away from his cup to meet Draco’s eyes. Draco was startled by the intensity there. It felt almost threatening.
The bird had no message. It only stared, intent and full of love, silently calling him home. Harry felt its gentle, pleading pull, he felt the emotion that fueled it. His ribs fell apart under its gaze, exposing the hole where his heart had been. His hand reached before he realized it and went right through the osprey’s immaterial body.
Harry searched Draco’s face, hands still gripping the armrests, before holding up his index finger in answer.
It wasn’t that Draco wasn’t grateful for the update; this just meant that Lucius was intentionally ignoring Narcissa’s letters. She would be devastated.
blonde man, wearing an immaculately tailored, charcoal grey,
Harry couldn’t help himself—he lifted his chin and kissed Draco again, one more time. “Just seems like a good way to get to know you, s’all,” he mumbled against Draco’s warm, grinning lips. Draco chuckled again and kissed him back softly, his thumb gently brushing along the stubble on Harry’s jaw.
And if someone did push Harry to Draco, they certainly didn’t do it out of the goodness of their hearts, or with Draco’s interests in mind. This would be a terrible plan to give Draco business, which he honestly didn’t need, he did well enough for himself. No, if someone wanted Draco involved with a curse on Harry Potter, it was more likely that Draco was supposed to take the fall for it. He was certain no one would fight that accusation, especially coming from the Saviour. No one would question it. Draco began to sag with dread—this had been a terrible idea.
“I don’t know. They never wore badges around me.”
“The air around you shimmers, a bit like a heatwave coming off of the earth,” Draco began, watching the distortion of the chair around Harry. It was heady, finally letting himself observe and feel this, when he kept this part of his training so carefully locked away. It would be too overwhelming, feeling and seeing the magical cores of everyone he passed. It was overwhelming now, when it was just Harry. He could feel his own lips turning up in a small, satisfied grin.
“After you,” Harry said, throwing on his Cloak again.
“American?” Draco wrinkled his nose, this was news. Pansy’s child was watching
he thought.
“Hey,
“Found something,” he muttered as the light grew in his peripherals, and he made to grab on to it, but immediately felt another disorienting
Could this be the last straw? The moment Harry realized Draco wasn’t actually the competent man he’d eloped with, but instead a mess who wasn't strong enough to resist his own strange, ferrety urges?
“You were maneuvered into that graveyard,” Draco commented. “He needed your blood…”
He hesitated only a moment, then picked it up, opening it to a random page.
A dim light came from the kitchen window, which was opened to let in fresh air, and let out the exhaust from Timsy’s roaster. Draco’s garden smelled like crisp night air and honeyed toast. Draco smiled as he breathed it in—the beans were nearly done, then. He could hear the warble of Doris Day, muffled from inside the house.

Prompt by wheezykat!
“Because I wanted to,” the words flooded out of Draco’s mouth. “Because I knew I should, as a Healer, because I owe you a life debt, because I was curious, because I wanted the challenge, because I wanted the opportunity to really get to know you, after I mucked up so many chances, and for you to see me as the man I’ve become.” Draco gasped. The potion hadn’t let him take a breath through that word vomit. He hoped Harry’s other questions required shorter answers.
“I’m borrowing it,” Harry corrected.
his voice broke off as he whirled around and started pacing, his steps officially numbered.
“Yes, I drank the full vial, because that’s how much the Aurors gave me when they were
It felt like growing up, but not in the way Harry knew it. It felt like growing up knowing he was loved, and cared for, and cherished.
“I was so focused on Conjuring
“You didn’t,” she whispered, and Draco’s eyes subconsciously darted to the side, his most obvious tell.
“I adore you,” Harry repeated, striding purposefully towards the bed, somehow managing to hold onto both the bag and the bubble tea while kissing Draco so deeply he rocked backwards.
,’” she read aloud, her composure slipping with emotion and wistfulness.
Ron glared at each person in the room until they either nodded or looked away. He turned back to the board.
“Would you like to meet a friend?” Draco asked.
It sounded like a power issue.
Harry stared at Draco for a moment, and his eyes darted to Draco’s chest before returning to the notebook.
Draco nodded, a little uncomfortable, and disapparated back to the comfort and solitude of his own home.
. I’m so bloody angry with you. You left, in the middle of the night, without a word. No one heard from you or spoke of you for
Draco waited for a rebuttal, but it didn’t come. Harry’s tiny smile was falling on his face.
and all three of their wands were pulled without even thinking, aimed directly at the two people who had just apparated into the kitchen—no,
“Fine. I’ll just have to buy more, then.”

too drunk. He’d never been this drunk in his life.
“Quite,” Lucius replied vaguely. He turned around, walking towards a long bench on the side of the room, picking up a small, glass vial from a shelf. It was empty.
Through his daze, Draco made himself study this shape, and take in its details, though it made him dizzy to do so. He could see a small pair of denim-clad legs drawn up, a thin pair of arms wrapped tightly around them, a pair of wary, dark eyes shining at him from the shadows. Draco tested his throat, coughing slightly. He needed to speak.
to do it, that’s the point there. You’d saved lives before—multiple times, by then—but those times you were only doing what you had to do. This was quite different. This was a much more conscious decision, and I’ll bet it had an impact on you later in life, didn’t it?” Draco was musing to himself again, but Harry was following along now, and he nodded, grabbing his notebook to write.
“I’m tired of not living the life I want to live, Draco,” Harry repeats. Draco holds his own hands to his chest, as if that’s the only safe place for them. “And I’m tired of pretending that next to you isn’t the only place I want to be.”
and Harry did. Un-fucking-believable.
“Mine, then?” Draco clarified, and Potter nodded. Draco reached into his jacket pocket again and pulled out a card with his apparition coordinates, handing it over.
He steeled himself at the top of the stairs, and stomped his way down to the heavy wooden door.
“‘He took care of it,’” Hermione repeated flatly, entirely unimpressed, narrowing her eyes at him.
“Draco?”
“I don’t know, to be honest,” Draco replied. “I know we’ve got the War to get through, now, and there will probably be several in the next two years. But I don’t
“Really?” Weasley’s eyes lit up in shock and he leaned forward, reminding Draco suddenly of a labrador retriever.
with rage.
He pressed himself against Draco’s warm body, cosseted in Draco’s soft bed, breathing in the eucalyptus scent of his hair. Tonight’s moon was full, casting a beam of pearlescent light over Draco’s scarred chest. When Harry listened for it, he could hear the rhythmic sound of the waves on the shore, blending seamlessly with the breaths moving in and out of Draco’s lungs.
“Yes, sweet
Harry’s memory of Lucius’ voice echoed in Draco’s head, making him shudder.
Draco growled at the man he’d once worshipped, low and threatening, deep in his throat.
“Do you know where that—that shirt is, with the…” Draco trailed off, vaguely gesturing, unsure of the terminology to describe a piece of muggle clothing Pansy had made him buy last year, that he knew would be perfect for this weather. Timsy disapparated before he could try to finish his thought, and reappeared a second later with the shirt-jacket in question. It was a deep navy canvas, with large pockets and a sharp collar, lined with shearling wool. The muggle at the high-end menswear shop had called it a “chore shacket” which Draco thought sounded like something dirty, and refused to say aloud.
Harry was baffled as to why he was still
Draco had a brief moment of realization that she may have been hearing about him from
good at scoring goals, Aunt Ginny says I could definitely be a professional like her one day, but I wouldn’t want to play for the Harpies like her, my favourite team is the Falmouth Falcons, what’s your favourite team?”
“We have to, Harry.”
“No, you didn’t.”
“—how do you know she’s alive? Mark my words, we’ll find her, but Patronuses are either turned away or they
The Unspeakables wanted Harry showing them when Draco was in pain, the way Narcissa honed in on him when he was hurting. They wanted to use that pain to get universal knowledge from Narcissa, somehow. They wanted to hurt him themselves.
“What do you mean?”
“I have a few bottles of dreamless sleep, if you’d like,” he offered, and Harry grimaced. Draco held his hands up, “Or not.”
“Is Harry Potter being here only for admiring the gardens?”
“I mean,
Harry huffed a gentle laugh, nodding, smiling affectionately at the thought of his godson.
“My daughter loves that show,” Weasley muttered between giggles. “What a day… Draco Malfoy being polite to freed house elves, wearing fuzzy slippers of a very fitting character from a muggle,
but joined the group hug anyway, soothing Harry’s nerves a little.
Once the important work was done, Draco looked back at Harry, who had his hands gripped tight in his hair, his face still hidden from Draco, sniffing occasionally. Draco allowed himself a moment to feel, to relieve his Occlumency and react to what he’d seen.
It felt like long hair tickling his face and a gentle hand on his chest, and a life-affirming question.
Melting on his tongue. He ignored the cascade of purple crumbs on his robes. “Just told Kingsley you needed me urgently, so I could cancel that meeting with the German Minister.”
His legs were indeed draped over Harry’s lap, and Harry’s hand rested on Draco’s knee, but that was

“I can tell you’re doing something important,” Harry heard through his translation charm, “and I’ve got nothing better to do.”
years ago, because he preferred it with lemon, and he didn’t really use the charm for anything else, since Timsy took care of the plants. But it seemed like a luxury to Harry, a treat. Draco wondered what other kinds of luxuries Harry enjoyed, if any.
Draco heard a
Malfoy scribbled some more notes in his notebook. Right on cue, Hermione spoke up. It had only been a matter of time.
Draco watched him for several minutes, studying him, memorizing every detail, in case this was some sort of trick his mind was playing on him. Harry’s wide, black curls were sticking up wildly, as if he’d been running his hands through them incessantly. He was still wearing his navy Auror uniform, which was cleaner than Draco would have expected, perhaps Timsy’s doing, and the top three gold buttons at his throat were left undone. When Harry tilted his head a little, eyes fixed on Draco’s hand, Draco could see the harsh, deep purple bruises, in a ring around his neck, the horrific impressions of Draco’s fingers on his copper skin. Draco’s vision blurred, and he unconsciously squeezed Harry’s wandering fingers in his hand.
The wizard laid the wand on the little scale and waited, looking surly, until the contraption spit out a little piece of parchment. He took it in his fingers and read:
“But Draco, if you did take that much, you’d have been out for over a day—you wouldn’t have been able to work. But according to Harry, you haven’t gone a single session without Legilimency. I’m not doubting your story, but either something doesn’t add up with it, or it was terribly irresponsible and unsafe to go into Harry’s head in that kind of state—”
“Yes, Harry, the
If Draco had any air in his lungs, he’d tear him a new one, but thanks to Potter’s
“Gotcha,” he snickered. Harry groaned in annoyance.
“Well, apparently, purebloods mean that quite literally, Harry. He’s bound, magically, to patient confidentiality—among other things.”
Draco, he would have insisted Draco come to the Manor. I told him that he shouldn’t, that Draco was probably working, anything to try to hold him there, but he insisted, and when I tried to deny him, he… he Imperiused me—”
“Well, of course she is a different woman,” Willem answered, as if Harry was an idiot. “You can’t expect her to be as powerful as she was during a War. Can’t expect anyone to be that strong all the time.” He sighed as he settled into his armchair-cot. “Besides, I wouldn’t know how to be strong in a body I hadn’t used in ten months, either. You know she was plenty strong without it.”
When the flames flared green in the fireplace, louder than usual, lighting up the room, and Lucius Malfoy stepped coolly out of the grate, as if this was a dream, or a nightmare, and no time had passed at all since the War.
Harry sighed, trying to calm his heart rate, wishing he was back at Grimmauld Place, sitting on a beach in a Pensieve next to memory-Draco,

Ron stepped through the floo last, calm and authoritative. He simply stood there, behind them, with his arms crossed against his chest—silently letting Harry know that he was supported, and he could let loose. Kingsley’s eyes darted around the room as the heavy books began vibrating on the shelves, and the many portraits of former Ministers on the walls began whispering excitedly to each other.
“Ron!”
This only created even more questions. Questions Harry knew he wouldn’t find the answers to by wandering the labyrinthine corridors of the Manor, but he did it anyway. There was just so much to
“Am I wrong?”
It was dark, but a small
Draco opened the door, and remembered—
Harry’s mouth twisted in a grimace, and Draco didn’t know which part of his answer was the most distasteful. The War memories? The ones after? The amount of work they had ahead of them?
“Trees, Harry,” Draco said, unimpressed. “Nothing but trees
Harry squeezed Narcissa’s limp hand gently. “She’ll be alright?”
Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times, his face traitorously hot. He decided to be resourceful, and brought Draco’s icy fingers to his cheeks. He couldn’t meet Draco’s eyes.
“I know,” Draco smirked. “As if you need another ridiculous title to add to your list of epithets. When you do finally croak, they won’t be able to fit all of them on your gravestone,” he said dryly. Harry chuckled silently at him, eyes still shiny from tears now twinkling with amusement.
He was cranky and irascible, snapping at Harry for every possible thing, insulting his most minute and irrelevant details. He’d gone on for ten minutes about one lock of Harry’s hair that curled around his ear in a way Draco found disagreeable.
Harry had hoped to never set foot in Malfoy Manor again, after the War. The one unfortunate visit had been more than enough. He hadn’t even been able to see properly, at the time, with his face all swollen. And still, he’d seen more than he’d ever wanted to.
the wand was pointed at his head, and the drunk Potter’s eyes widened as he tried and failed to move around, away.
Harry’s face was wet, too, and Draco knew he himself must look a right mess—he knew he got red and blotchy when he cried, Pansy had always told him it wasn’t a good look. But Harry looked like a tragic angel, because of course he did, the tosser. His eyes shone brighter against his smooth, brown skin, his lips a lovely rosy colour from pressing themselves together so hard, from the straight teeth currently biting them nervously.

apparently,” he added with a pointed look.

Harry’s wand was in his hand and aimed before he could think about it. He couldn’t see a thing, but he could hear Kramer shifting on the floor, the tinkling sound of glass being brushed aside.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered again, one arm falling away from where it hugged his own waist. “I don’t know what came over me. It won’t happen again.”
“Thank Merlin,” Weasley suddenly let out a sharp exhale, as if he had been holding his breath. “That means you can call me Ron, now. There are too many Weasleys—it gets confusing, you know.”
Finally, the reveal of someone's sTuPiD mixtape... :)
Harry was watching him, and Draco could so clearly see the grief and regret on his face, in the tear tracks tracing down his cheeks. He wanted nothing more than to reach out and take Harry’s face in his hands, to hold him against his chest, to
at all. This kiss was ardent, steadfast, full of intent—less desperate, but still so eager; less pained, but just as passionate. Kissing Draco felt like the dawn of spring after a long winter, like flying through cool, night air, like blowing out the candles on a real birthday cake.
“No, Harry,” Draco shook his head. “What do

More memories flashed past him as he waited—Harry running from a gang of boys, Harry yanked around by a large man with a purpling face, Harry’s teachers telling him he’s a compulsive liar, according to his aunt, so why should they believe him, and won’t he just admit he fell down the stairs? Thankfully, he spotted a silvery glow soon enough. “I see another,” he told Harry, and latched on.
