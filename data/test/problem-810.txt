Luna sighed and glanced at the door behind them where Draco may have gone back to bed. She paused, and when she thought the coast was clear she looked back at Harry.
“Really?” Harry asked as he stood up, ruffling his hair. Draco stood on the top step, and looked at Harry over his shoulder and said with a light smile,
“Don’t touch me!” Draco screamed. Harry watched in shock as the realization dawned on Draco’s face at what he’d said. “I don’t want your filth on my clothes, these were specially tailored for me, it’d be a shame to burn them.”
“I said that I would only like to do it for my Prince.”
“Close the door.” Hermione told the Prince. Harry felt his heart sink, what was so important that Hermione could know and he couldn’t? I guess it has to do with superiority. Perhaps also that she’s the Queen’s maid and he’s the Prince’s servant. Draco glanced between the two of them and crossed his arms, and Harry tried not to look at how tight Draco’s clothes seemed to fit across his chest and abdomen when his arms were crossed like that. He swallowed thickly, and cleared his throat again, heat rising up his neck.
Draco hopped off Ulysses, and walked forward. He bowed to her and she granted him the same respect. She smirked and shifted her weight to one of her hips.
“Well I have things to check up on, I’ll leave you be Harry. Make sure you’re well rested for the trip, and please refrain from pissing off Draco,” Her smile was sad, and she walked out of the room, her boots clicking on the wood floor. The door creaked shut, and Hermione and Harry were alone. There was shouting outside the door in the common room, and then it went silent. Harry glanced over at Hermione, who had her wand pointed at the door.
~*~*~
Her explanation about Draco’s ‘duties’ was vague, but Harry had a feeling it had to do with him listening in. He wasn’t invading privacy, Draco had told her to keep the door open, for what reason he didn’t know. Perhaps Draco had guessed what Hermione had come to say and since Harry would be going with, didn’t mind if he listened in. Or if it was the case that he didn’t know what she was going to say, perhaps he simply did not want to be alone in a room with her.
He stood back with Hermione and Ron, who’d appeared from his own duties. The King walked in and sat down at the long table, the Queen following right behind him. That’s when Harry noticed the third place setting. He hadn’t even thought about it when Hermione told him to make three place settings. He was about to ask Hermione when the boy walked into the room. His eyes widened and his mouth dropped open slightly.
The boy demanded so much attention, just by his walk. He looked over at the servants and smirked. Harry felt a shudder go through him. Such a beautiful boy, with such a terrifying smile. He looked over to Hermione who covered her stomach with an arm and stared at the floor. Ron held her gently, his arm behind her back. Harry’s eyes widened, and he looked back at the boy. The boy grinned at him, his eyes flaring with pride, before going to his seat at the table.
“Thought you had more taste than this, Loony.”
Ron nodded vigorously. He held her as he moved to get up, and when he made sure she was covered, he walked past Harry to a bucket. Harry hadn’t even noticed it was there. He watched as Ron dipped the rag into the bucket, and began to dab it onto Hermione’s back. She began to cry. Harry walked over to her, and kneeled down in front of her. She tightened her grip on the blanket covering her chest.
Luna sighed and stepped back from her pile, “I overheard Lucius and Narcissa, talking about my father. That’s all.” Harry nodded, and stepped forward to take her into his arms. She stiffened, and then relaxed into his embrace.
“Buying sweets for someone special perhaps?” She asked, and he chuckled. She put the individually wrapped candies in a small pouch and handed him his coin pouch back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, I can show you where to get the blankets and pillows, but you’ll need to retrieve Draco’s clothes on your own. I don’t think he’d take kindly to my being in his personal area,” Luna sighed. She started walking up the hill, not waiting to see if Harry was following.
Luna laughed. “After what I witnessed yesterday, I decided to knock. You can blame Harry, he’s tamed me.”
“Why are all the servants so young?” He asked, before thinking about the question if he was being honest.
The redhead turned to look at the girl, who nodded at him. Harry watched their silent communication and realized they knew each other, which meant the red-head must be a servant too. The redhead grabbed Harry’s arm and dragged him out of the room as Miss Granger’s shirt was ripped open.
“S-sorry, I didn’t mean to stay out too long,” Harry apologized, and bowed a full 90 degrees to the Prince. Draco snickered, and knocked his feet out from under him, sending him falling into a small pile of muck. Anger boiled in his chest, and he got up off his face to growl at the prince, but he’d already began walking away.
“Yeah, my mother was Queen Malfoy’s servant long before I was. The Queen decided she wanted me instead, and let my mother go. It was a harsh relief. She could finally leave this wretched place, but she wouldn't be supporting the family anymore. I support them now, sad as that may be.” Hermione smiled sadly, and looked down at her hands. Ron, who'd been silent, reached over and squeezed her shoulder lightly.
The sun had begun to set on the horizon, as Harry mounted Hedwig for the first time. His thighs ached at the stretch, Hedwig could use to lose some weight. He trailed his eyes along his steed, her muscles contracting under his weight. Luna had taught Hedwig well, he knew by the first step that Hedwig knew to follow. He on the other hand, did not.
“No,” Draco said, before realizing his mistake. He had responded too quickly. Harry chuckled. “I just meant, it’d be better to talk to you than to discuss goons and goblins for my merry little cousin back there.”
Luna looked up at Harry, who was still standing further up on the hill. “What is it Harry?”
“Who is this? He’s new, a servant perhaps. Ill-fitted clothes and messy hair to boot. Oh, Draco darling where on earth did you pick up this stray?” Pansy asked, and pursed her lips in satisfaction as Harry shook with anger. He managed to keep his face from showing emotion. The Prince however, did not hesitate to answer her.
He folded the shirt over his arm, and went to find some trousers and a jacket. When he walked over to look at the rows in front of them, he rummaged through the trousers until he found some brown ones in his size. He wondered if he could fix the hem to have some gold sewn on, perhaps he could ask Luna for some thread. He also grabbed a nice leather jacket without sleeves, so it was almost like a vest, and put it together in his pile.
No wonder she didn’t appreciate what harry had said about Draco. She probably grew up with him.
Harry heard Luna before he saw her. She was humming a tune to herself, and brushing the mane of one of the horses, who he immediately recognized as Hedwig. Shocked, Harry walked into the barn and pointed at the horse in question.
“Rather a joined room, perhaps. If one is available. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with him alone, I’m sure you understand.” Draco answered and allowed Ulysses to follow Pansy behind the open gate.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he heard Hermione gasp behind him. Everything went silent as he made eye contact with cold grey eyes. A shiver rolled down his spine as a smirk formed on the blonde’s lips. Draco rolled his tongue over his lips, and bit his bottom lip, before smiling at his new servant.
“Yes, sleep.” Ron moaned, and then was out like a light. Harry watched as Hermione flicked her wand at his bed, in which the covers pulled away from Ron and over his sleeping figure.
“I wonder what Malfoy would say if he saw me now.” He smirked. Luna raised an eyebrow at him.
Draco grinned widely at the princess, satisfied with Harry’s answer.
“Malfoy, you've missed breakfast. I brought you a plate, you should get up for the day.” Harry spoke softly. He had no real idea why he was doing this for Draco but it seemed right.
“Ah, my bad. I’m used to doing that with Luna’s hair whenever she gets it cut,” Draco replied. Harry hums to himself, Luna would look really cute with short hair. They walked back up the hill past the sweets shop and Harry gasped.
“Yeah, I got an outfit for the ball. I haven’t gotten any casual clothes though.” Harry answered him, his voice grew quiet. He looked up the hill to where Luna had disappeared, probably to go get her horse. Harry felt a lump in his throat form, he’d wanted alone time with the Prince but he hadn’t meant for her to get hurt.
“What happened?” Luna asked, and Harry pulled his head out of his arms, and set his chin down on his knee. The sun was setting in the distance, growing darker, bit by bit.
“We should go to bed, I'm exhausted. I've had a long day,” Harry yawned, standing up and walking to his bed. He crawled under the sheets, and turned on his side to watch the other two. Ron groaned as Hermione moved away from him, and he fell back onto his mattress.
“Thank you, Harry.” Hermione whispered, pulling her head away from Ron’s shoulder. She looked up at Ron and smiled, despite her tears. Ron brushed some strands of hair out of her face. “There should be a cloth in a water bucket somewhere, Ron could you grab it?”
Harry didn’t look over his shoulder as he walked away. He heard the bed move. A slight creak, a shift of weight. Perhaps the sound of someone sitting up, perhaps out of confusion, or out of fury. If Harry didn’t acknowledge that he knew Draco was awake, he didn’t have to deal with that outcome.
“Harry,” Luna spoke from beside him. She’s slowed her horse down to walk beside his. “You hold those ropes, they’re called reins. You guide her by gently moving them, if they cross over her neck in either direction she turn her head to move in that direction. If you press your foot onto her right side as you move the rein to the right she will turn more sharply. To make her go faster you lightly kick her sides with both feet. Just say ‘woah’ or ‘calm’ if you need her to stop, while pulling up on the reins.” Luna demonstrated by making her horse stop.
Though he’d have to say Draco’s room was quite clean. If he has no need for a servant why is Harry doing all of his housework? Wasn’t Hermione supposed to be teaching him about leaving the castle with his Highness and Luna? She told him how to prep Draco’s pack full of supplies but Harry had no clue how to pack for himself. They were to be camping in the middle of the woods in the middle of nowhere alone. He paused his sweeping.
A serene calm settled over the two of them as Harry watched the blonde’s eyes move back and forth under his eyelids. Draco moaned a little and turned around to face away from Harry. Harry faced his Prince’s back, and he traced small circles and patterns onto the fabric of his shirt. Harry’s eyes fluttered shut to the soft sounds of Draco’s breathing, and the slight rise and fall of Draco’s chest.
They gathered together on Ron’s bed, since he was in the middle. Harry carefully moved the candles onto a book-stand Hermione set up. They were cozied up with their blankets from their beds. They chatted about pointless things, until Hermione changed the subject.
I’ve got one shots up on my Pseud if you want to check those out.
Yes, I made Hedwig a horse! I know that Hedwig is a white owl but I really wanted Harry to bond with a black horse. I don't know how long it'll be before the next chapter, hopefully not another month, but a month at most. I love reading and replying your comments! They make me so happy ^^
“What was that? It sure caught our Prince’s attention.” Pansy asked him. A smug smirk on her face, she was poised to listen.
The touch of her skin, brought back all of his memories for the hour before. The way Draco had laughed, and the noises he’d made under the touch of Harry’s palms. He’d laid defenseless on the bed, a young man over him, and he hadn’t panicked. Harry was positive he could’ve turned around and slit his throat open with a hidden blade if Harry intended to hurt him.
Hermione must have been the girl who helped him. Ron was lying on one of the beds, facing the ceiling with his arm thrown over his eyes. Harry went over to one of the three beds and sat down on it. A cloud of dust drifted out of the blanket as he sat down on it. The bed was untouched, as if it hadn’t been used in a long time.
“I just hope you’ll look appropriate, Potter. Let’s buy you some casual wear then, so you don’t have to wear rags,” Draco started walking down the row of tents and small forts. It looked like a small festival had set up along the inside of the inner town streets.
“Hello, Hedwig.” Harry whispered, and reached his arm through the stall bars. It was then that Luna walked out of the back room. She stood quietly for a moment, and then walked over to them.
“Well I bet you’re both starved after that riveting discussion about the ‘royal prat’ last night. Why you kept talking about me although I was right there I wouldn’t know, would you happen to have something to say to my face, Potter?” Draco asked the next morning. They packed up their stuff as Draco was grabbing his hunting bow and sword.
~*~*~
“Leave us!” King Malfoy shouted. Harry jumped at his booming voice, and left the room with Hermione and Ron. As soon as they were outside the door, Harry let loose.
“He’s more of a rescue really. My father let me keep him, he’s a rather good dog. How’s your pet, still a mangy bitch?”
Harry quickly ran to the bathroom, and started heating up the water, he lit the coals and watched as the water started to simmer. When he deemed it warm enough, he walked back over to the blonde boy.
Oh, that was nice. It made him wonder again, about his aunt and uncle. He hoped with a small part of him that Lord Voldemort had not spared them a single glance when he wiped them out. Or maybe if they had survived, they were far away in some outland.
“No mate, I’m just used to it only being me and ‘Mione. I’m not used to having another bloke around. Before you, it was Myrtle, but as ‘Mione said before, Myrtle committed suicide two weeks after.” Ron sighed. “You hungry?”
“You’re the Prince’s servant. You have that air about you.” That air?
“You’ll stay here with Luna while I hunt. Oh and don’t bother trying Potter, she’s not into you, she wouldn’t stoop so low,” Draco snarled. Anger bubbled in his chest as Draco removed the sword from his face and he averted his gaze to glare at the ground. Draco stalked off into the trees without making a single sound.
“Do you like him?” Luna asked him stepping towards him.
“Stop! Okay I get it. Everyone has a story. I have a story.” Harry shouted and cut her off. He took a step away from her and rose his hands up in frustration. Luna just looked at him. He sighed and crouched down. He ran his hands through his hair, and over his face. He did not want to talk about it.
Harry began to massage the area right above Draco’s pant-line and stopped when he noticed the boy flinch. It was different from the usual sensitive spot. Not wanting to be nosy, but wanting to make sure he wasn’t hurting the Prince he peered closer and noticed a darkness.
“He is a good man. Not many people see it, but I can. I see a lot of things, Harry Potter.” Luna replied to him. Her voice came out as a whisper, but she was adamant on making him believe her, so he shut up about Draco.
“Wow, you actually look like a Prince,” Harry muttered, his voice had a breathless sound to it. Draco shot a look at him, and he waved his hands in apology. “I just meant, you look like a Prince, you look..”
“Get up. We’re going to the kitchen.” Draco nudged him in the chest with his boot, sending Harry falling back onto his butt. Harry’s eyes widened and he gasped in surprise.
Merlin knows Harry didn’t want Hermione alone in a room with Draco. After what he’d witnessed the other day, he really didn’t want her anywhere near the Prince. Hermione didn’t look affected by Draco’s presence but perhaps it was a front she was putting up, Harry didn’t want to think she was simply used to it.
Harry soaked all of this information in, nodded and walked over to stand in front of Draco. He tried to memorize the pattern Draco had begun to tie, but from what he’d noticed, it was in disarray. He began to untie Draco’s shirt, sparks flying through his fingertips every time he touched the Princes skin. Draco’s gaze was fixated on something behind Harry. He began to wind the tie around in a criss-cross-x pattern making sure to tighten with each loop he made around each cloth knob.
“Fine. Should I meet you both back at the castle then?” She sniffled. Harry’s heart lurched, and he reached out for her. She moved her arm away from him. “Don’t touch me.”
“Malfoy, are you alright?”
Harry stared at Hedwig, “So um, I’ll just have you know that I’ve never ridden a horse before.” He heard Draco snicker,
He walked up the stairs, making sure not to drop the food. It looked delicious, no breakfast foods he'd ever had before. Draco's door was closed, so Harry jiggled the doorknob, it was open.
“So you came to Hogwarts? What was that bloody decision all about? If Voldemort failed in killing you, these people will finish you off!” Ron whined. Hermione turned to him again, and he squeaked.
“I really don’t need anything nice; I’ve never really had many clothes so I don’t really feel the need for them now. As long as I’m able to wash them, I can save my money to buy food or nice things for Hermione and Ron. Perhaps even Luna if I find something she likes.” He didn’t mention that he’d like to buy something for Draco as well. He didn’t want the idea to go to Draco’s head and inflate his ego even more.
Harry started with a slow touch to the middle of Draco’s shoulder blades. Draco jolted and Harry slowly rubbed a circle on the muscle to relax the blonde. Draco relaxed slowly and Harry was able to work the tensed area more. He began running his thumbs along Draco’s spine all the way from the base of his neck to the tip of his tailbone, spreading his fingers out at every knob of the Prince’s spine. He stretched the skin of Draco’s sides as he worked the kinks out of Draco’s body. He began to massage deep into the mid back, lower ribs area.
~*~*~
~*~*~
Harry looked up in time to see Cedric walk in carrying plates in his hands. They were filled with the most delicious, most delectable looking steaks Harry had ever seen in his life. There were different kinds of fruit, cut into small squares; oranges, apples, mangoes, a weird white and black speckled fruit. Harry grabbed it and popped it into his mouth, the taste was faint, like a pear but very light. It was chewy, melted in his mouth, and the seeds didn’t grind on his teeth like he thought they would, they just dissolved on his tongue. He ate the rest of the fruit slowly, enjoying the sweetness, fearing he may never taste anything so wonderful again.
As they walked down the street, they passed another sweets shop, this one a permanent store. They were making all sorts of things, and passersby could easily watch them through the window. Draco seemed transfixed on a type of candy inside the shop window. Little colorful sweets, perhaps a sweet or sour candy.
Draco hollered and rode off after her. Harry wondered if he stood a chance against Luna, the stable owner. He clicked his tongue and Hedwig took off after the two of them.
The streets were dirty, covered in a dampness from the morning dew. Luna was wearing an interesting pink dress, he didn’t know quite how to explain it. Didn’t think he could if he tried. She bounced the heels of her boots against the stirrups. Hedwig neighed softly as Harry led her towards where Luna started toward a small hut. He noticed, while following her, that there were small stands that were selling street food, and candies.
The barber began casting spells on his hair and Harry didn’t understand or know any of them. He began to notice the changes right away. The man grabbed a special knife and began to shave away at the sides of his head, and behind his ears. Harry made eye contact with Luna through the mirror and when she nodded at him with a smile, he closed his eyes.
“Not bad, you should know I like the color black. It's a must in all of my clothing choices.” Draco smirked. “Are you going to watch me undress Potter, or are you going to leave?”
Luna glared at Pansy. “As always Parkinson, such a pleasure to see you.”
Luna took it as a confirmation that she should leave, and Harry felt stung. He sighed in resignation. Draco moved his hand near Harry’s face. Harry flinched, when the hand came into view. Draco touched his hair, very lightly for only a moment, before realizing and backing away. Harry was scared, his heart was racing. He tried to make eye contact, tried to search Draco’s eyes for a hint of something, anything.
Colin dropped him off at a closed door, which Harry presumed was Luna’s. He nodded a thanks to the boy and knocked on the door. He noticed that her door was in fact in the same hallway as Draco’s room, but on the end closest to the hallway and on the opposite side.
“Boy. What is your name?” The woman asked him. His eyes widened in shock as he stared up at the woman, speechless. Was she actually going to give him a chance? “Can you not speak? Or are you just stupid enough to ignore the Queen?”
Harry shoved past him and walked back out into the commons, the boy still following him.
“I assume you’re well rested, Potter?” Draco tsked. Harry winced, he’d overslept. The memories of the previous night flooded back to him, and he looked away from the Prince's eyes. The Prince was standing with a long night shirt on, and some baggy trousers, and Harry felt flustered to see him wearing such common clothing. The baggy shirt was a scoop neck and the neckline hung just below Draco’s collarbone.
Harry said nothing. There was an emptiness that filled his body. He stared Draco in the eye, tears welling, threatening to spill over. Draco’s eyes widened.
“We should be good to leave in the morning.” Luna sighed. The air was heavy around her, something seemed off.
“Well if we’re going to make his jaw drop, let’s at least go all out. I feel better now, thank you.”
Harry scoffed, and stood up. “My apologies. I figured I’d help the weak, and make a kind gesture.” At this comment, Harry realized his sass had gone too far when Draco went completely silent. Draco stood from his chair, and walked past Harry, and Ron and out of the Throne Room. Harry watched him go, before turning to look at a very shocked Ron.
“I don’t know if that’s a lie, but you’re obviously scared. I want you to rely on me even if you’re too full of pride to admit something is wrong. Whatever it is it’s not your fault. I won’t say anything to anyone, and I won’t judge you for anything.” Harry whispered. “I’m sorry for what I said at dinner that day, it was in the heat of the moment. I’m going to leave you to change, I’ll try to go find Luna before dinner.”
“Her name is
Harry looked and saw a table, with different satchel’s and other riding equipment. She took a swig of her water, before she turned around and walked deeper inside the barn. Harry walked after her, curious to see the inside. He felt something soft beneath his feet and looked down to see muddy gravel.
He walked briskly out of the building and trotted up the hill to find Draco eyeing him suspiciously by the horse stables. Draco’s white steed seemed to also be eyeing him. He smiled and tucked his hands behind his back.
“You are to leave the kingdom for a few days. King Lucius has arranged for you to visit the Parkinson’s. The Queen thinks perhaps it would do you some good to court Princess Pansy. The Greengrass’ are also visiting the Parkinson’s, so the King should hope you would take the advantage to talk to them as well. You would take Harry with you as he is your servant now. You will also take Lovegood to care for the horses, and to act as a guide for Harry’s while you are taking care of your duties with the Princesses.” Hermione explained.
“Oh, speaking of. I haven't seen any adult servants.” Harry muttered. Not as single servant he'd met or even glanced at was over the age of 15, except maybe the kitchen help, but even then he wasn't sure.
“Armor is more difficult to put on, but since it is a dinner, we shouldn’t need any chainmail. Though I suppose you haven’t seen Draco in chainmail yet, you will when you see him joust or fight battle practice, he quite handsome in it actually.”
“You’ll explain to me what happened.”
“What’s your horses name?” Harry asked. Draco rose an eyebrow at the question. Harry shrugged, he figured it would be better to get off such a depressing and serious discussion. He didn’t want to push Draco to far and end up hurt, either of them.
So the next chapter was supposed to be out on the 28th of February, but this chapter came out a little late. So I'll have it out probably early March if not the last week of February.
“What time is it?” He asked her. The castle halls were empty except for a few other servants. The hallways were large, made out of stone, and warm from the sunlight that poured through the gigantic stained glass windows. Birds were chirping outside, and the cool breeze blew, through some of the cracked windows. Harry smiled, everything was silent, and he realized it was the most perfect thing he’d witnessed.
“What did you just say to me?” Draco nearly growled, “I could have sworn you just told me what to do.” Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach, and he took a step back. Draco tore the broom from his hands and he scrambled away from the blonde. Draco gripped the bottom end of the broom and smacked Harry with it. Harry yelped in pain and fell to the floor. Draco hit him with it again and again. Harry coughed as the broom handle hit him in the ribs.
Harry bowed to her, and looked past her to the King, who sat smugly in his throne. Harry closed his eyes for a moment, and breathed in deeply. His heart was racing. He could feel everyone’s eyes on him as Queen Narcissa continued talking.
Hello! Sorry for the wait on this chapter. Please do not drop everything you're doing to read this update, it will still be here when you finish. The chapter is over 19K, roughly 50 pages long.
“Now find his belt for him, it should be wherever you unpacked it earlier.”
“Better learn fast then Potter.”
Draco remained silent, and Harry turned around to look at him. The blonde wasn’t anywhere in the room. Harry furrowed his brows and grabbed the folded clothes and tucked them into the bag. He looked around, and walked out of the room. He carried the satchel out to the bag strung to the horse, where Luna was packing other things like blankets. The sky was pink with the sun beginning to set, it was getting cold.
“Malfoy, please. Allow me to care for them and bring them back to our room.” Harry pleaded, even bowing slightly. Draco looked over his shoulder.
Harry began to touch gently, following the darkness around to the Prince’s right hip. How had he not noticed this bruise before? It was large and an almost black purple, the edge of the bruise was surrounded by yellow. There was no way Draco hadn’t noticed that Harry had seen the bruise. Draco hadn’t made a sound, and he hadn’t moved. The heat had disappeared from the base of his neck. There was a slight tremble in Draco’s arms.
Harry scrubbed each piece of metal, two times over, inside and out, to make sure they were clean. He put both sets of armor back together, it wasn’t hard, just time consuming. He’d still ask Hermione about cleaning armor, and perhaps ask Ron if he knew how to fight, it’d be good to learn.
“Shh, Harry!” Ron hissed. Hermione glared at both of the boys. Harry just stared at them, confused. “You can’t talk like that, not near them. They’ll kill you, you understand that?” Ron hissed at him. Hermione turned to Harry,
“I needed to escape. I could not stand to be there any longer,” Draco sighed. “I don’t understand how they work, I’m not ready for this. Where are your horses?”
“Harry?” A soft voice called to him, and he looked up at Luna. She rushed over to him, Draco walking away from the scene. “Harry stay with me, Harry!”
“Harry, you mustn’t walk so quietly, it is quite dangerous to spook a horse, they are rather hard to control. Thankfully, she noticed you before I did and didn’t startle quite as badly. Um, I’m guessing Hermione sent you? Did you bring the supplies?” Luna asked, and brushed a loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear.
They walked into a store, the walls were made of brick. It was warm inside, and in the back of the store Harry could see curtains hanging around certain poles. Perhaps they changed and tried on clothes behind those.
Harry hopped down from Hedwig and tied them both to a post outside the shop.
“I’m the King’s ward. I’ve been living here since I was nine. So, I’m sorry if you don’t like them, but they’ve been taking good care of me for several years now. I simply can’t listen to anyone’s harsh comments.” Luna smiled at him. “Thank you, by the way. Your compliment was much appreciated.”
When he finished washing her, he covered her wounds with a bandage and handed Hermione her shirt. She stood up and walked over to her bed. She sat down with her back facing the boys, and removed the blanket. Ron drew his eyes away from her, as she slipped on her bra. He knocked Harry in the head and glared at him for staring.
You can find posts on my process on my Instagram: RunningRemnants
Princess Pansy was in love with Draco? How? That couldn’t be right. “That can’t be right, how does he feel about her?” Harry asked. He could hardly seal his bewilderment. Luna side eyes him, before running her fingers down a scrap of cloth.
He found he quite liked the laces, as he’d found them attractive on Draco. He figured he’d try one on. He kept looking around the shop, finding a pair of trousers he figured were in his size, and folded two over his arm, one in grey and one in black. He walked over to a section of mediums, and found a nice heathered looking red shirt. A pullover loose fitting long sleeve shirt, and he also grabbed one in black and walked back to the changing curtains.
(See the end of the chapter for
The castle was unusually quiet, as well as outside. Hermione hummed down the hall as Harry finished putting his mop and broom away. Breakfast would soon be served, and his new day with Draco would begin. Hermione walked back towards him sending her mop and broom into the closet with her wand. Oh, how he missed using magic.
“You making new little friends, Potter?” Draco sneered, once he was down the hill. He nodded to Luna who simply smiled at him. Harry watched the interaction, and grew curious. How well did Luna know Draco? Were they a thing? He’d have to ask Hermione about it later.
Harry glanced over to Draco, who hadn’t moved. He thought back to what Hermione said about him changing the clothes of the Prince, and that it was a part of his job. He swallowed his embarrassment and walked over to the bed.
Luna sighed to herself. “You shouldn’t have said such mean things, Harry. He didn’t deserve them, especially because he didn’t even instigate it.” She bent over to fill a bucket with water for the horses.
“You think he’s attractive!” Luna whispered, she leaned in close to him and held her hand over her mouth. Harry panicked, and his heart jumped into his throat.
Harry watched as the Prince practically glided down the hill, everyone spread out from him, allowing him to move gracefully at his own pace. He demanded attention with his presence, and damn if Harry wasn’t going to give him some. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, noticing his stare.
Harry smiled at Luna, who decided to join for breakfast, and grabbed Draco's plate. He bowed to the King and Queen, before turning away, and watching out of the Throne Room.
“Oh, no I was just exploring. I'm sorry to intrude.” Harry blushed, he must've looked like a fool just standing there. He rubbed the back of his neck with his hand and walked towards the barn. His eyes widened when he saw the pretty blonde girl from before.
Draco pulled Harry’s face close to his, and tightened his grip. Harry clawed at Draco’s hand, and struggled to speak. All he managed was a small cry.
Colin clapped his hands together and gasped, “Why yes, actually. She’s right down the hall from you. I shall show you the way.”
Harry scrambled to his feet, and stood facing the Queen. The King walked into the room as well, followed by Draco. Hermione and Ron entered the room after him, and shut the door.
Malfoy glared between the two of them, locking eyes with Luna seemly waiting for something that never came. He relaxed and glanced back to Harry, who stood confused. “Do you want her to stay here and watch you change?”
“Clean it up.” Draco ordered again. Harry stood up and began to gather the dishes. He held them out in front and walked over towards the door. His reflexes weren’t fast enough to move out of the way, when Draco’s hand came up from beneath the plates and knocked them on the floor. The plates shattered, and Draco grinned. Harry felt a kind of sadness pool in his stomach. He had hoped, and he was wrong. He had
“Are you okay, Harry?” Luna asked him as soon as they were out of the room. Harry held up a hand and stared her down. He was still on the verge of tears, more out of anger now than hurt. Asking someone if they’re okay when they’re clearly not is a sure-fire way of making them cry.
“How often does Malfoy come here to visit Princess Pansy?” He didn’t like to say her name, it felt bitter on his tongue. He wondered simply out of curiosity, because Hermione had made it seem like she had seen Astoria many times. Astoria hadn’t nulled that thought either when she said she’d preferred the company of Hermione either.
“You can’t believe that. Do you agree with it?” Harry asked, still flabbergasted. He could not grasp the idea of marriage for power. Perhaps it was one of the things Luna’s father had disagreed with the King about.
Draco was silent again before he cleared his throat and turned to look at Harry.
Draco’s name sounded weird coming out of her mouth. Harry wasn't sure why the thought occurred to him, each of the royals in this castle shared the name, save for Luna. A light bulb went off in his head.
“He killed my parents too. My mum first, and then my dad a few years later. How much suffering he must have been through. I ran as soon as I could, I thought my father was dead. They took the kingdom, I don’t even know where they came from. But one day, after I ran, I bumped into Draco. He was out hunting with his father and they saw me in tears and asked me what had happened. Since I was a princess, Draco and I had been set up on premature dates for possible future scenarios, so they knew me. They took me in, and I’ve been here ever since.” Luna whispers. Her tone was light and airy, and it made Harry feel better about what he had shared with her. Their lives had been ruined by the same horrid man, in very similar ways. “But don’t you see Harry? Our stories aren’t insignificant. They’re a part of our lives. Everyone has a story, Harry.”
There was a knock at the door.
“Malfoy, are you okay? Can I help you in any way?” Harry reached out to touch Draco’s shoulder, but his hand was slapped away, and he was shoved to the ground. Fear spiked in his chest as he glanced up at the blonde boy.
“I can do whatever I want Potter,” He replied with a smirk.
As Harry followed the marching boy down the hallway, a sudden thought came to mind.
“Did the mudblood give you a tour of the castle?” He asked. Harry’s eyes narrowed as he glared at Draco and crossed his arms.
Harry winced. “Well that was because I didn’t want you to get weird over what Luna said, you have the tendency to assume there’s something between me and Luna. I didn’t mean for you to take offense to what I said. I think you look perfectly fine without clothes on from what I’ve seen.”
“I apologize for that, I don't really have any money. I have a few knuts, but not much at all. I’m not sure how to repay you and Luna,” Harry twirled his thumbs. Draco shrugged.
“Silencing spell,” she said. Her voice was soft. Harry nodded and laid back. He stared at the ceiling. He heard Hermione sigh, and a slight thud of a book being set on the floor. “I’m sorry he did this to you, but really you should have known better than to talk to him in such a manner. I’m not saying this is your fault, or that it explains his reactions. I’m just hoping you’ll watch what you say to him, in order not to set him off on you.”
“We have two separate rooms for the kitchen, one is more of a prepping room than a cooking room, and the other room is to cook everything in. It’s to make sure everything is decontaminated before we cook it. You can check out both rooms if you’d like, just make sure to wash your hands in case you touch something.”
Harry barely held back a chuckle. He wasn’t sure if he was more insulted or impressed with Draco’s dog analogy. Draco smirked at the light noise that slipped out of Harry’s mouth, and smiled at Pansy.
I hope you guys enjoyed, and I apologize if there were some typos I missed.
“Thank you for saving me, I’m sorry this happened to you.” Harry whispered to her. She sobbed as Ron rubbed a particularly sensitive spot on her back. He whispered an apology and continued. “What did they do to her?” He asked Ron. Ron motioned for him to come over, so Harry scooted to where Ron was sitting.
The room fell silent, and his words echoed off the walls. Harry refused to blush in embarrassment, he would not allow the stares of the other royals bother him. He felt the eyes of Luna and Draco on him, but he held eye contact with the Princess. She raised her eyebrow at him and leaned closer, but he couldn’t look away, he had to stand his ground. Intimidation set in, and he felt the hairs in the back of his neck stand. He only broke eye contact when he noticed a movement out of the corner of his eye. It was Astoria, she laid her hand on Pansy’s and shot her a look before smiling at him.
“Do you fancy her mate?” Ron asked, his eyes widened. Harry shook his head quickly.
“Shut up.” Draco spoke to her, his voice was smooth, and cold, it sounded menacing. Harry couldn’t do anything but watch as Draco slammed her head into the stone tile of the Throne Room floor. Harry was too scared to move, too scared to make a sound. He watched in terror as Ron ran to her, but was stopped short by Draco. Draco kneed him in the stomach, and Ron dropped to the ground. He held his stomach, and stared at Harry. Harry’s heart felt like it were on fire.
Harry didn’t understand, and Luna looked disgruntled. As they followed Draco through the gates Luna began to speak.
“Sorry, Malfoy. I overslept.” He’d had a busy night after all. Draco raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t say anything. Harry walked over to the wardrobe and opened it to choose an outfit for Draco. “What are the plans for today Malfoy?”
“What do you mean, why am I here?” She asked, a hand held to her chest. “I have a spell on him Harry. It alerts me to noticeable changes in his sleep. I didn’t expect to find you in his bed, Harry. What were you doing next to him? What did you do to him?” So she knew Draco had bad dreams, or something similar.
“Many of Draco’s friends are quite odd, they’re all a rare breed. That’s what my mother used to say.” She picked up a gold and handed it to him, he stood listening to her talk. “Theo, like I mentioned before, as well as Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Crabbe and Goyle are very good friends with Draco’s father, the poor things. You didn’t hear that from me, you understand?” She pointed a menacing finger at him and scrunched up her face. She only moved her hand away when he nodded. He didn’t know who he’d tell besides maybe Ron or Hermione, but even they were miles and miles away right now.
“Cedric is taking longer than usual. I was going to give you the tour after the meal was done, but it's taking longer than expected. The castle is quite large, the meal will be cold by the time we're done.” Draco muttered more to himself than his servant. “Guess I can give you a tour of this area, though you might know it since the servants quarters are right down the hall.”
“Harry Potter, your majesty.” He looked up at the Queen. She smirked in satisfaction.
Draco turned back into his room, Harry followed suit, and shut the door. He began grabbing various shirts and pants much like the ones Draco was wearing, and placing them into a large satchel like bag that was laying on Draco’s bed.
“He’s done bad things, but he’s not a bad person.”
Draco was gathering small sticks and logs. Harry decided to gather dry and dead leaves from the area around them in order to start a fire.
When he arrived at the stables, Harry found that Luna had pretty much packed everything onto the horses already. His blankets were neatly rolled and strapped onto the back of Hedwig’s saddle, and his bags of food and equipment were strapped to the sides.
Harry stared down at the meat, he’d never eaten something as nice as this, it was always, duck or goose, sometimes deer if his father got lucky. Usually they’d eat squirrel. Harry had to blink back tears as he stared down at the wonderful meal before him. He looked up at Cedric and smiled.
Harry walked into the shop after the, and wandered off. It was a large outdoor store with the big white canopy he’d seen earlier, draped over poles rooted in the ground. There were rows and rows of tables, and on each table was a different item of clothing. Socks, trousers, shirts, belts, jackets, even hats. They seemed to range in price and materials.
Harry doubted it, as he knew rather few people.
“I’m not that great at fashion sense, I mean look at me. I just pick out clothes I think would make Draco look good. If you think he looks good then I suppose I did a good job,” Harry answered, not looking at Draco. “I don’t mind the work of being a servant, so far the hardest thing is polishing armor and learning how to deal with the etiquette of dinnertime.”
“Wha-?” Harry started to ask. Draco stared after the two of them, and Harry looked back at Draco, who merely shrugged. Hermione shuffled him down the stairs. Harry nearly fell over his own feet as she hurried him.
“Execute him.” The woman ordered. A few men came from his peripheral vision that he hadn’t noticed before.
Luna lit the fire with a spell, and while she tended to it Harry began setting up their cots for the night. He rolled out Draco’s mat first, before gathering the blankets and pillow and setting them on top to mimic a bed. He worked on his next, pausing when Luna began to talk.
“Yes, I’m not sure how I’ll be visiting with each of them at the palace but I do know that I’ll be meeting with the three princesses separately. My father chose Pansy as best for me but in the end I suppose I get to decide who I’ll marry, as long as I have the approval of my kingdom.” Draco answered.
Luna glared at Harry, removing her hand from his mouth. She walked out from behind the divider.
Harry froze, and his eyes widened. He set the shirt he was holding on the bed, and turned around to look at Draco. Draco nodded, and looked down at his feet, and then away.
“Well, well Potter you seem to have gotten better at your slave duties, imagine that. Well done, I needn’t even ask.” Draco smirked and slid his leg over the horse. Harry felt his neck heat at the praise, although it had come with the sass as well, he’d done something right.
As they neared the castle, Luna began to move things around in her bags, telling Harry to do the same. They’ll be taken to their rooms as soon as they enter the castle. They’ll be asked to change and bathe before heading to dinner with the servants, unless of course they allow Harry to accompany his Prince to dinner. Highly unlikely, she’d said. Harry felt an odd weight in his chest, like someone was standing on it. Both blondes were on edge, and he-having never met anyone from the Parkinson Kingdom-didn't understand what was going on. He simply did as he was told.
Draco shivered and moaned. Harry’s eyes widened and a strange heat ran through him. He sprang back and held a hand over his mouth, before he let out a sound. He was still sat on the boys back. His heart was thumping in his chest so loud he was sure Draco could hear it. There was a bright heat at the base of Draco’s hairline and a similar one settled on Harry’s cheeks. The sound replayed in Harry’s mind and he had to will himself to calm down and pretend like he didn’t hear anything.
“Relax, you’re too tense.”
He stared out the big stained glass windows, and saw a girl. She was blonde, pretty, and taking care of the horses. Her skin looked too perfect, her hands too dainty for her to have been a servant, but Harry didn't remember seeing her at breakfast that morning.
*~*~*~*
“Usually she likes to go through all the little shops in the village. I believe she made friends with a couple of the shop-keeps. Did you happen to bring any money with you that you’ve earned in your time working for my family?” Draco asked him with a side glance. Harry flushed; he’d completely forgotten to bring any money. Not that he has much, or has made anything substantial.
“Yes! How can I help you?” The boy smiled brightly and held out his hand, “You must be Harry Potter, Prince Malfoy’s servant. I’m Colin Creevey, it’s wonderful to meet you.”
Harry sighed, and closed his eyes tightly. He really didn’t want to go on this trip. He ran his hands down his face and was shocked by the cold. Perhaps he should bring mittens? It would get cold at night, Hermione said. He’d need several sets of blankets, pillows, clothes, and pans from the kitchen. How were they supposed to get food? Hunt? Harry had never hunted before, though perhaps Draco and Luna would do the honors. He mulled it over in his head, probably Luna.
Harry’s chest tightened as the ground began to sway beneath him. He looked at Luna, past Luna, around Luna, but avoided her eyes. His head began to ache and he couldn’t get enough oxygen. How could she know? How could she tell?
Harry put the potatoes down on a cutting board adjacent to hers. He began to chop the potatoes into small chunks. “Do you not care who I am?” He realized his pace at chopping was much slower than hers, but he was afraid that if he tried to speed up, he’d cut himself.
“No, no! But I wondered, is there something between her and Prince Malfoy?” Harry asked. “She got very defensive over him when I ranted to her earlier.”
“That's horrible!” Harry gasped. Hermione nodded. She yawned, and glanced not-so-subtly at her bed. Harry chuckled to himself.
Harry went to search the chest where he’d put the trousers and other things that weren’t shirts. He grabbed a nice black belt and held it out for Draco. Draco fastened it around his waist and then began to spread his arms out. He was still and silent, and Harry wondered what thoughts were running through his head. Perhaps he felt Princely.
It was more form-fitting than he’d first thought, and it fit him well. He’d fill out the chest later when he began to train his muscles. He loved the color. He tried the black one on as well, and it fit the same as the red. He put the red one back on and wore it with his brown pants. He walked out from behind the curtain and gave the thumbs up to Draco. Draco handed him nearly a hundred more things. Harry set the other clothes off to the side and grabbed the clothes Draco had gotten for him.
It was perfect, the steak was hot, and the inside was a beautiful red, warm not cold. He stuck the piece in his mouth and it practically melted on his tongue. He ate the rest of it hungrily, before moving onto the vegetables. Smoked broccoli, grilled carrots. He practically inhaled the rest of the food, licking his fingers when he was finished. He panted, and smiled. Best meal he’d ever eaten.
“Maybe a boy then,” Harry mumbled to himself. Draco moved suddenly, and stared at Harry with wide eyes. Harry couldn’t read his expression, seeing only blatant shock. Harry blushed and shook his head. He couldn’t tell if Luna had also heard him, but he figured she knew anyway without him saying anything.
Harry sighed and began sweeping the floor, he created a pile of dust, amazed that so much dirt can accumulate after only one day. Just what went on in this castle? It felt like hours before they finished the first floor. Harry was focused on his work until Hermione start humming, and he turned to look at her when he noticed a boy around his age walking down the hall.
“What about their ward, Luna Lovegood?” Harry asked them. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion at Ron’s response, he’d begun snickering to himself, trying to keep his laughter in. Hermione glared at him.
“I'm Harry, Harry Potter.” Harry extended his hand to her. She smiled at him, but didn't shake his hand. She nodded to him, and tossed a rag over her shoulder. She was wearing a blue button up shirt, with blue jeans, and brown boots. She was thin, and her pretty blonde hair was pulled back into a messy ponytail. She had a small knife on her right hip, and a spot for her wand on her left. She shifted her weight onto one hip and pulled out a cup of water from behind her.
The servants stared at them with wide eyes as Draco pointed out certain things. Things that the servants themselves could have shown him. When Draco turned and looked Harry in the eye, Harry saw a flicker of an emotion he’d seen plenty of times before. Draco wanted to show him the common room, because he knew the people were scared of him, and he
He didn’t feel terribly bad about thinking that since they were pitiful human beings, just such terrible people. Perhaps they became servants elsewhere. He hoped he’d never have to see them again, though with his luck it was entirely possible.
“Enough,” Harry replied, fastening the last tie on the green shirt he’d dressed Draco in. Draco had Harry turn around so that he could change into the dark brown pants Harry had picked out for him.
“Oh shoot, I forgot my old clothes in the shop. I should at least throw them out. If you want to go ahead you can, I’ll be quick,” Harry made a shoo motion toward Draco and didn’t turn around to leave until Draco walked away. Draco gave him an odd look but walked up the hill. Harry waited until he was just out of sight by some people and darted into the sweet shop. He had a few moments before Draco began to suspect. He looked for the sweets Draco had been looking at in the window earlier.
“He was too quiet.” She muttered, looking over her shoulder. She held her hand to Harry's mouth as he tried to speak. She held a finger to her lips. Draco had shuffled in his bed.
Harry decided Hermione sounded right threatening if she wanted to be. Her voice was stern enough that he would have opened the door in an instant, not wanting to anger the woman. Draco yelled from inside something that Harry couldn’t quite hear. Hermione grumbled to herself for a moment, as if contemplating something.
Harry suggested leaving the horses at a stable and walking around, Luna agreed and they left their horses at one of the stables just over the hill. Harry made sure to bring his pack with him, not that he thought anyone would steal his stuff of course. They continued to walk around looking at other clothing stands. There was a sudden flash of white through the crowd, and Harry felt a weird tightness in his chest as he watched the white blob move towards them.
Luna looked between the two of them and smiled, winking at Harry. He shook his head towards her, but it was futile. He knew she knew, and he sighed. “Why I’m so sorry Master Draco, next time I’ll just shove Harry into the room first.” She giggled.
He dug into his bag and grabbed his small coin pouch. “Please give me as many of those sweets as this pays for.” He pointed at the round colorful candies and placed the pouch in her hand. She smiled at him.
“Well, Harry Potter, it was lovely to meet you. I hope to see you at the ball tomorrow night, save me a dance.”
“Rude. Harry, I need you to please hurry with your packing. I understand you’re new at this but please work faster. We need to get out of here at a reasonable time so we don’t arrive late. Draco your mother already sent out the letter and it’d be best if we could get there at a reasonable time.” She ranted, and tucked a hair behind her ear. Harry’s eyes followed her hand down her neck to rest at her hip. She sure was bossy when she wanted to be.
“Right, okay. I see how it is. I suppose you’re right Potter, we’re not on the same level, perhaps we never will be. I’m a Prince, and you’re a slave. We should act as such, so as to not confuse the common folk.” Draco walked ahead of him. Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach, that’s not what he’d meant. He didn’t want things to return to the way they were before.
Draco curled his lip in disgust. Harry remembered what Hermione had said on his first day. Draco didn’t like meeting princesses, he never paid them any mind. Harry would never understand the need to find someone to marry at the age of fifteen.
“Don’t be. It’s not your fault.” Luna whispered and looked away. "She took a deep breath in, and Harry waited, anticipating her next words. “Harry,” and he looked at her, “My name is Luna Lovegood.”
“Ron! Shut up! You do realize these walls are rather thin? How do you think King Lucius would take it, hearing you talk about him that way?” Hermione hissed. Harry glanced between the two of them.
“Do you have to court with all the princesses?” Harry asked.
“You were the one who interrupted him first!” He furrowed his brows at her and humphed.
Draco’s voice was muffled by the pillow but Harry could just make out the words. ‘It was just training, nothing special. It happens from time to time.’
Draco was standing in the room with long black trousers already on and hanging loosely around his waist. The curve of his hip bones jutted out just above the slouched waistband. The blonde paused in his ministrations as he’d been lacing up a white shirt. His shirt hung open and Harry could see the hard packed muscle of his chest, his heart started racing as he glanced up to meet Draco’s eyes. There was a light blush under his eye but nothing more.
“Did you grow up as a servant?” Harry inquired, shifting his position on the bed, relieving his sleeping foot. He winced as the tingle started.
The man smiled at him as Luna explained the situation. The barber looked delighted to be working on someone so close to royalty, though in Harry’s mind he wasn’t even close. Not after that spat they’d had earlier. His chest ached from the memory.
With that she waved at the two boys and walked down the hallway. Draco sighed behind Harry and when Harry turned around to inquire, the Prince had wandered into the room. Rather than a joined room they had asked for there was simply a small divider with a bed behind it. Harry figured it was for him. Harry closed the door behind him when he entered into the room fully. Draco collapsed on the bed, and buried his face in the pillow.
Normal. A strange term, since he’d only been a servant for a bit now, and Draco’s mood seemed to change like the weather. At first, he had hated him, with a burning passion really. The more time he spent with the Prince made him realize that he’s not so much of an asshole, but just that he has a lot on his shoulder for his age. No kid their age should have to hold up the weight he has to. The side Draco shows in front of others is different than the side he shows when he and Harry are alone. He’s learned to actually enjoy the company Draco brings him.
Harry stopped walking and stared in the stall at the black horse. It was beautiful, it’s coat was brushed, and shining. It’s mane was long and combed, and it’s tail hung down to a little before it’s hooves. He looked at the stall door for a name; ‘Hedwig’.
“Why are you hiding it?” Luna asked him. She was walking towards him and he couldn’t seem to scoot away fast enough. His eyes flicked around the hills and saw no one, this wasn’t a trap. Everything was okay, wasn’t it?
Draco was tense as Harry touched him, and it was beginning to annoy Harry. He was here trying to relax the blonde and the boy beneath him was only growing more tense. Harry leaned forward over Draco’s body towards his ear and whispered.
“What is this?” Harry asked, finding it hard to keep the shakiness of anger out of his voice. Draco gripped the pillow beneath his head tighter. “Who did this to you?”
Harry shook his head, “His highness is dressing right now.” The words felt weird coming out of his mouth. Hermione looked up at him from where she stood a few stairs below him, and furrowed her brows in confusion.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. The prince was clad in a tight fitting green shirt that tied loosely in a V below his collarbone. His pants were black and fit to his legs in places that made Harry blush to look at. His wand was holstered to his hip, but Harry also noticed a small dagger, one he hadn’t set out in the morning. Draco had decided to wear the outfit he’d picked out, and he looked damned good in it.
Hi guys! I bought a planner to work out what days I’ll be updating. This chapter goes up tonight on the 31st of January. The next chapter will be up on the 12th of February.
“I’m sorry Luna but could you leave?” Harry asked, he didn’t even want Draco to see how pale and scrawny he was under the large clothing he had.
Luna turned and jumped when she saw him, holding a hand to her chest and calming the horse she startled by patting its nose.
“Parvati Patil, I’m a kitchen maid. How about you, royal servant?” Her question rang clear to him in his daze.
“Why not transfigure the beds? Or at least make them softer, bigger, warmer?” Harry asked her. Hermione turned to look at her bed.
His head was buzzing, throbbing perhaps, but not in a painful way. His ears were ringing, and sound was muffled. Did Draco hit him in the head? He couldn’t remember, his sides hurt, and he felt light headed when he moved.
Harry jumped, and looked over his shoulder. Draco was stood behind him holding several squirrels attached to a string. Harry stood up and brushed himself off. He grabbed the kindling he’d found and faced Draco.
The three started talking about the horrors of camping with Luna and Draco, and he couldn’t stop himself from smiling. He was walking behind the two, and slung his arms over their shoulders as they walked towards their room. Hermione and Ron gave him amused confused looks, as he gripped their shoulders and beamed. It felt like home.
“What? No!” He whispered in an immediate response to shut her up, or to quiet her down. “What makes you think that?” He couldn’t look her in the eye, and looked past her as she smiled at him.
“And what is it you’re laughing at?” Harry grumbled. Hermione shook her head, as Luna glanced over at her. Luna smiled at the both of them.
“Perhaps Draco is right to want you in a joined room. I shall request to stay in the same hall also, if they’ll let me.” Luna muttered. Her eyes were downcast. Harry reached out to touch her, he felt as though he’d upset her somehow. She moved away from his hand and walked away from them towards a guard down the hall to request a room change.
Harry listened to her gossip over the love lives of others, and wondered for a moment about hers. Not that his own love life was doing so well, he had interests like any other teen boy did, but he wasn’t serious about any of them yet. He was also pretty sure Ron and Hermione were an item, but he didn’t know if he should ask out of fear for angering Ron.
A woman walked up to him and asked him what he’d picked up, and he showed her. She let him into one of the curtains. He found the green shirt looks strange on him, but both red and black shirts fit. The trousers fit him fine, without a belt, so he figured he could wear a jacket over his long sleeve shirts and have it hang over his pants and he’d look fine.
“Sorry Princess, I don’t really feel comfortable doing that.”
They walked out of the shop and Draco sighed. “You look much better Potter, though I don’t understand how unruly your hair can be, even when it’s cut so short.” Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair, as if he hadn’t thought twice about the action. Harry’s eyes were wide, he was surprised by the action.
“Let’s go to the dining hall, dinner should be starting soon.”
“True mate, that’s bloody true.”
The kitchen was quiet, save for a few servants grilling up some meat, and others cutting up fruits and vegetables. There was a taller man with long hair standing over a giant cutting board. He turned around and bowed to Draco, who nodded in return. The man wiped his hands on a towel, and walked over to greet Harry, hand extended. Harry took his hand and shook it firmly.
He closed his eyes and breathed out through his nose. The leaves rustled in the wind, passing across his exposed skin. The air smelled sweet, like flowers and honey from the treats the horses ate. He opened his eyes, and with one last glance at the shed, he walked back up the path to Luna.
“Let my servants show you your rooms. I suppose Draco, that you expect to room with your muggle mutt?”
Draco paused, Harry noticed his boots scuff the mud as the Prince turned to him. He hadn’t really thought about his words, not that they weren’t true, but he didn’t think about how the Prince would feel beforehand. Though he probably didn’t mean to come off that way, the Prince seemed quite sensitive.
“She’s a distant cousin. Not closely related, but her father is related to my father somehow. They didn’t get along in the slightest. So he decided to run off with some whimsical princess and start his own kingdom. They produced Luna, who my father adores. It’s only because of that adoration that she’s allowed to stay here. My father is not exactly forgiving.”
His voice was different, it was an order but it wasn’t cold. It wasn’t void of emotion like his other orders could be, he was intrigued. Harry went to speak but Draco held up a hand.
Ron and Harry cleaned the table, while Hermione left with the Queen to organize an outfit for an outing with her sister. While Harry gathered up the plates, Ron gathered the silverware and wiped down the table.
“Y-yes Master Draco?” Dobby answered, looking up at him slightly from where his head faced the floor. Harry looked from Dobby to Draco and back again. He never knew royals used elves, he thought elves were only for servants.
“Do you have a problem with me?” Harry asked Ron. Ron looked up at him. He shook his head and walked with harry to the kitchen.
He brushed off the dirt and patted down the pillow to remove the dust. Perhaps Hermione could teach him home how to clean beds first. He turned away from Ron and looked at the books next to his new bed. The door to the servant’s room creaked open, and his eyes widened. He quickly glanced over his shoulder to see Ron bolting out of bed and towards the door.
“Potter.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco cried. Harry knew what he needed to do.
“It’s Prince Malfoy to you, Potter.” He spat at the brunette. He turned back to the door and walked out of it. “You have ten minutes.”
Between work, planning a wedding, and trying to buy a house my updates will be a bit choppy, but we'll get there. I have an Instagram linked for fanfiction and other things if you would like to follow me on there to see tidbits of my process. You can find me under RunningRemnants, it's on private so just request! Thank you again for sticking with me.
Harry coughed, and sat up. He watched Luna talk Draco down. She ran her hands through his blonde hair, and down his face, and onto his chest. He couldn’t hear the words they were saying anymore, everything was a blur to him. Draco’s eyes flicked over to Harry’s and they stayed locked, until Luna forced him to look at her again.
The smile dropped from Harry’s face, and he stared at his lap. He wondered if he should tell them. He quite honestly didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t even know what to say, but the look in Hermione’s eyes told him that it was okay. He bit his lip, and sighed.
Hermione smiled, looking at Harry. “Then you won’t mind Harry and Luna joining you! I’ll tell your mother you’re to leave!” She clapped her hands in glee, and walked out of the room. She turned back for a brief moment and grabbed Harry’s arm.
Harry was at a loss for words, he’d stopped sweeping and had blatantly stared at the blonde boy. He turned to Hermione who was humming to herself a little further down the hall. She didn’t seem to have seen the boy, but Harry wanted to know who the bloody hell he was.
“She's my friend, I don’t like seeing my friends hurt.” He huffed. Hopefully putting Draco’s fears to rest. Heaven forbid Draco found out Luna liked someone, else he’d send the dogs.
“It was,” long, insufferable, tiring, “not bad,” Harry responded, surprising himself. He supposed it wasn't, he had met Luna after all. Luna had most certainly brightened his day. “But I'm exhausted.”
“We barely pay you anything as is because you are basically a prisoner to us right now. We don’t know why you came here, and what you were running from so until we figure that out you make only a little. I don’t mind buying you clothes, it’s nice to go out shopping with someone. Especially if I can make them look better.” Draco explained. There was a small skip in his step that Harry did not miss.
“Oh so you admit that now,” She crossed her arms across her chest and shifted her weight to her other hip. Harry flushed, but held his glare.
“Seems easy enough,” Harry gave her a lopsided grin, “Thank you, Luna.”
Draco shot a hand out in front of Harry, keeping him from touching her. He didn’t want to hurt her, but he didn’t want to test Draco either. Draco’s forearm bumped against his chest as he blocked Harry from continuing. Harry’s skin burned under the touch, and a heat lit up under his skin where he could feel the slight touch from under the fabric of his shirt. He took a step back in order to save himself from the tingling sensation under his skin.
“Who in the bloody hell is that?” Harry exclaimed. Hermione looked at him in shock. Ron grabbed Harry by his shirt and threw him away from the door.
“What is what?” Harry asked her. She grabbed his arm lightly, and pulled him down a path. They started walking slowly down the path, and she eventually let go of his arm.
“Wh-” The boy started to ask. Harry whipped around and glared at the boy.
“Potter! You’re late.” Draco spat. Harry knelt down as an apology and panted in front of Draco’s feet. Draco looked down at Harry in amusement. “Are you hungry?”
“They must have told you about me. I’m not as terrible as they say, as long as my slaves behave.” Draco licked his lips and set Harry down. Harry dropped to the floor and gasped for breath, clutching his throat as he coughed. He watched as Draco retreated down towards the large doors. “Follow.”
“What is going on here? Why are you here?” Luna asked. She looked at Draco, stepping between him and Harry just slightly. Harry didn’t like that too much. He backed away and stood off to the side. Draco glanced at him over Luna’s shoulder. “Draco, you can’t just leave the castle. We came here specifically for this, you can’t just leave them when it’s your duty to court one and choose.”
“What do you mean you’re fine? You’re wearing rags Potter. I realize you didn’t have much with you when you got to my castle, but even the other servants have nicer clothes than you do.”
Draco turned and walked out of the woods towards the clearing they had slept in. Luna was awaiting their arrival. All of their gear had been packed onto the horses backs and all that was left were a few cooking utensils.
Harry laughed to himself, causing them to look at him. They both blushed as if they realized they’d been arguing in front of Harry. Hermione cleared her throat and nodded for him to continue again.
“Stories? She was telling the truth,” Harry gritted out. Ron glanced down at Harry’s fists, and raised an eyebrow.
“You’re the kid that Draco ordered the meal for?” Cedric asked, surprise written all over his face. He raised an eyebrow at Draco, who, Harry noticed, had a glint in his eye.
“‘Mione, you okay?” Ron asked, walking into the room to give her a gentle hug. Hermione laughed quietly, and rubbed an eye.
Draco steadied himself and stood, walking over to where Harry had set out his clothes.
This chapter has 7,072 words, which is almost 19 pages.
Draco’s room was a deep green color, with black curtains hanging across the bed poles, draping over the side. His sheets were black, and his comforter was a dark green. The wall had a giant plaque with a silver snake on it hanging above his bed. Draco walked out of what looked to be a walk-in closet. Harry looked over to him, eyes skimming the other details of the room. There was a large painted black desk with a quill and ink. There were bookshelves, filled with many books of all lengths and colors.
Harry felt heat rise to his face and he coughed and shook his head. He couldn’t, scratch that, wouldn’t ever change Draco’s clothes. He would jump out a window first before having to awkwardly remove and put on Draco’s pants and shirt. The idea that Draco shouldn’t be dressing himself was ludicrous.
Harry knelt down on the ground and began to scrub the floor where the plate pieces had fallen, double scrubbing certain areas so that he was sure he had cleaned everywhere. He tossed the rag back in the bucket and stood up.
Harry rode beside Luna down the hill to the next stop. He never noticed the motherly aura about her until this trip, she seemed wise beyond her years, for someone so young. She was very quiet, at least with him. She was watchful, as if she was waiting for something to happen. He found she was less joyful here than back at the Malfoy kingdom. So was Draco if he was honest, but Draco only seemed calm when there were no other royals around. Somewhere he didn’t have to hold his head up so high it was up his ass.
Harry was beginning to see the silver lining in being a servant to the royal ass. Harry cleared his throat and breathed in again, having forgotten that he’d stopped breathing. Draco looked over at Harry and rose an eyebrow, seeing the boy freeze, he smirked and looked back over toward Hermione.
“Let’s get going shall we? We’ve spent long enough packing. We won’t be leaving in the morning, we’ll be leaving now as to not upset my father worse.” Draco grunted, hopping into his saddle.
“Yes. I have to ‘court with’ as you put it, all the princesses. My mother says that both Greengrass princesses are going to be attending the ball in the Parkinson kingdom. My parents firmly believe that Pansy is the best fit for me.”
“Actually yes, I have quite the idea.”
“What will Luna and I be left to do whilst you ‘court’?” Harry asked, using the terminology Hermione had used at the Malfoy castle. Draco chuckled a little at his sentence. He shrugged.
He carefully began to unpack Draco’s things and hang them in the old wardrobe against the wall in the back of the room. He folded the trousers and placed them in the drawers of the wardrobe. He hung the shirts and placed all of Draco’s boots at the side of the wardrobe so nobody would trip over them if they walked past.
As always I love all of the comments I receive!
Luna pressed the back of her hand to his forehead, and Harry stilled. He glanced over at Hermione who hid a smile, and cleared her throat. He glared at her, and she went back to thumbing through her book. He knew what she assumed, she assumed wrong.
“Malfoy, that’s a lot of money! You can’t do that,” Harry gasped. Draco inhaled, making his chest puff out in arrogance.
She smiled slightly at him, “Oh, I know what they think of you, what each of their opinions of you are. I see things, remember? I keep secrets as well, so if you don’t want me to tell anyone I won’t.”
Harry’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco, the blonde was smirking. He uncrossed his arms and started walking towards Harry, his black suit defining his body well. Harry shut his eyes and cowered a little as Draco neared him, and he cursed at himself mentally for showing fear. When he opened his eyes Draco was not in front of him, but instead walking back towards Hermione and Ron.
“I bloody think you’re attractive as well!” He answered, and realized he hadn’t whispered. She’d left him feeling so flustered he forgot to remixing quiet. Draco didn’t make a noise behind them, and just crawled into his blankets behind Harry. Harry grimaced, he didn’t quite know how that sounded if he hadn’t heard the rest of the conversation. “He’s a royal prat.”
“I forgot. It’s alright, I don’t need anything.” Harry chuckled and scratched the back of his head. Draco gave him a once over and frowned.
“Yes master.” Dobby bowed, and dissipated back to what Harry thought may have been the kitchen. Draco turned to Harry, whose eyes were still blown wide.
He met Luna’s gaze and his eyes widened at the look on her face. She was grinning wide.
He walked over to his bed behind the bamboo sheet. He shuffled through his clothes until he found his nicest pair of trousers and a nice shirt. Without looking in the Prince’s direction he began to undo his loose brown pants. He dropped them to his ankles and quickly changed into his nicer dark brown pants, hooking the tie around the cloth knob. He grabbed his cloth belt, and laced it through the loops atop his pants.
“Let’s move on shall we? Malfoy said you were going to take me into town to buy me clothes. Anything else you want to do while we’re out?” Harry raked his hand through his hair. It was long, a mess, and everything he wished it wouldn’t be if he were honest. Luna looked him up and down, and a bright look appeared on her face.
