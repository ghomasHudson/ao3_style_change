One look around told he was not the only person to be taken aback. Everyone, except the Minister were shocked, because The Saviour speaking for an ex-Death Eater was not a usual sight you witness like the rising sun. Had something happened to Potter after the war? Or had someone imperiused him? For no chance in his right nous, Harry Potter, The Saviour of the Wizarding World would speak in favour of a Malfoy!
Every time he saw a younger year student jumping enthusiastically, pain began swirling in his heart; it reminded him of Colin Creevey. A small boy so happy, animated, following him for a photograph, tried to take a photo even when he was injured— innocence—; and till his death Harry never willingly posed for a photo for that young lad. And all he was able to do was give Colin his photo at his funeral, maybe, just maybe Colin would forgive him.
Draco looked at his begrimed forearm; The Dark Mark, blotched into a fugly scar. If squinted, one would be able to make the shape of the snake emerging from the skull. It was like a deformity on pristine skin. He wanted it to vanish, not just fade. With a shake, to cut short the thoughts that would drive him crazy and a sigh, he walked to the toilet and prepared himself for the foreseen day.
The soft zephyr swooshed his hair dishevelling it slightly, the only sounds were the susurrous rustles of the leaf and ripples sound. He was sitting at the edge of The Black Lake— of course with mud repelling charm. It was somewhat minutes past lunch, but he didn’t cast a tempus to check it.
For some idi-fucking-otic reason The Chosen One spoke for his trials, but why for his Mother? Of course, she didn’t carry an ugly skull and snake mark, The Dark Mark, in her flawless, unblemished skin like him. That didn’t mean Potter could defend his Mother. Something told there was more to “Why”. Except, he settled with “always the Saviour” complex.
Harry sat there for a jiff rubbing the sleep of eyes processing the instructions. He sighed and moved to do his duties.
The elf brightened at the greeting as the fear of being punished drained. ‘Good morning Master Malfoy. I is coming to tell Master that Mistress is waiting for Master at the dining room for breakfast’, Binny said.
He really should’ve expected this. Why in Salazar’s name should all eighth years be put together? He honestly didn’t want to share a common room, especially not with the Golden Trio. God! He can no longer even spend time in the common room without whispers and looks.
‘Ron!’ she hissed. ‘I think Harry is right. We were teenagers who underwent something we never wanted or dreamed for. So was Malfoy! Remember Malfoy also saved us!’
Draco bolted upright, gasping, skin trembling, lips quavering, hair damp, sweats pooling at his nape, pyjamas drenched in sweat buckets; his breathing, ragged and shaky.
‘Draco! What happened? Are you fine?’ Pansy shrieked and Blaise’s hand tightened around him. He was worried it would gather attention, but thank Merlin and Morgana people didn’t even flinch or shoot an eye. It disturbed him to be ignored but some part was happy about it. He glanced around to find who it was, but was unsuccessful.
It took some monstrous amount of self-restraint to suppress the urge to either tongue-tie or petrify them.
No! Just no! Of course, there’d be other students from seventh years, but from eighth year it’s only him and Granger. He can’t be alone with Granger and walk out alive after everything. Okay, so death in the Ancient Runes classroom.
Of all, what irked him most was why Harry Bloody Potter exonerated him during his trials. He harked back to the day of his trial.
He turned to Blaise, who was at least not loathing like he did. ‘Longbottom, Finnigan and Thomas’, he said coldly. Of course, the remaining three.
Many in the mass had remnants of war over their faces, both in face and heart. They were not rejoicing with triumph as he expected, there were grateful, small, sad smiles; eyes at the brink of tears. The smiles being shared carried faint sombreness, the effects of war legibly written in air. There was understanding among everyone around the station.
He sighed. ‘We’ll go and find a compartment’, he said, tugging them. He paused when he passed Potter’s compartment. Potter was sitting by the window, Weasley and Granger curled up next to him; opposite, Longbottom was by the window staring at the platform, Weaslette was in an animated conversation with Lovegood.
All through the years it would have taken, what, a minute to pose for a photo; which he didn’t do. At that age he didn’t want the admiration and praise,—he still doesn’t— but for someone else it was like a life wish. Colin had always admired him— which he didn’t deserve,— but for the boy’s sake he could have done it.
6. The world of advanced Herbology of the World by Woolly Warehouse (if studying N.E.W.T. level Herbology)
It was like his Father’s voice. A disgrace to the Malfoy name. It hurt to hear it said by his Father. The Malfoy name meant a lot to him and it hurt to think he is a disgrace to it.
People walked to the list and murmurs softly began. He, Pansy and Blaise didn’t move to look for it, he thought it would be better to see after everyone has moved. He saw Potter and Weasley, grinning and jumping— of course, they must be together. He wanted a distraction to avoid staring at Potter and that’s how he took a look around.
‘No. No, it’s just... Malfoy’s wand is still with me, and I must return it soon if he too received a letter and don’t know if… ’ Harry trailed off, unsure if it was the correct thing to say.
It took him years to get over the rejection which he eventually did. But still, a pang of jealousy rose in him; what it would be to be Potter’s friend, to be a part of his little group. He was not ungrateful for his friends, it’s just… it would’ve been nice to be Potter’s friend.

‘Annnd, that’s my boy!’ Ron squealed in delight, which Harry returned the gesture. The witch rolled her eyes at her friends, but was happy nonetheless.
could’ve spoken against him, conversely he didn’t! Potter was, trying to put him out of Azkaban! A plethora of questions demanding answers wanted to roll out of tongue, but laid off.
The ceiling was charmed like a fairy tale night. Thousands of candles swaying slowly, flame flickering on and off, the rich dark blue clouds reflecting the lights emitted from the candle, the four long house tables half-filled with students with goblets and plates, the house ghosts shining misty silver. It really was
‘Are you accepting the offer Draco?’ she sounded hesitant. He could make out the faint flicker of hope in them.
It was only then the blonde descried his surroundings; the sky, vivid yellow with no hints of grey and blue as seen earlier and the sun up high, brilliant. Draco grimaced at the thought of sleeping so long and waking up at some fucking o'clock. The Tempus revealed that fucking o'clock to be a half past eight and slid out of bed.
‘We have classes at nine! So no, I’m going first, then you. You will bath soon if you know you’re late.’
‘You don’t understand Ron!’ she cried, frustrated. ‘Everyone will return! There are chances for books to be stocked out! What if we can’t get it! Think Ron! Think.’
The old wards must’ve been destroyed during the battle. He could sense the strong magic of the professors.
He was tired, so tired of everything. It’s been two months and a half since the war ended, yet wasn’t able to move on. The only day he stepped out of the Manor was two weeks before, for his trial— oh! He wondered. How an ex-Death Eater— thanks very much to his Father— that’s him, moreover only him, was declared free was still a riddle.
Thank you, for taking the time to read this letter. Like I said at the beginning, you don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes.
Harry stops retching and is okay but Draco keeps holding him. As Harry had just been beaten, he did not have enough time to put on a glamour. Narcissa gasps as she sees the damage and starts to rush forward. Harry flinches and she looks horrified at herself. Draco just pulls harry onto his lap in the middle of the freaking Amazon Rainforest and cuddles him close, hands brushing calmly down his arms and sides, whispering sweet nothings into his ear. Clutching him close to him. Nothing will ever make him let go of this boy, not when he finally has him in his arms.
The train ride was uneventful to say the least. He sat with the Slytherins but didn't speak. He just looked out the window and mostly ignored them. Harry could feel all the stares on him so he turned his head and met every single pair of eyes with his cold, emotionless ones. The Slytherins all blanched and quickly found something else to look at. The one person who didn't was Draco; he had a curious look on his face and wasn't afraid of meeting Harry's eyes. Harry looked back out of the window and let Draco ponder.
Once Harry had finished in the shower and dressed in some of Draco's clothes, they headed downstairs to get some food. The adults were already seated at the table waiting for the teenagers to arrive before they started the meal. When they boys walked in side by side, Lucius started snickering quietly while Narcissa held an amused smirk on her face.
When I came around, I noticed I was in someone’s arms. They felt so safe, warm, and strong and I just wanted to stay in them forever. I breathed in an intoxicating scent – peppermint. Someone was carding their long, thin fingers through my unruly curls. They were also stroking my face and neck in a soothing manner. I peeked my eyes open and was met with Draco’s concerned gaze. My eyelids fluttered open fully and I took in my surroundings. Draco was holding me protectively, possessively in his arms whilst a furious ring of Gryffindor’s surrounded us. I clung to my mate. Oh yeah, should probably say, I am an omega. Draco is my mate. I fainted from the realisation (honestly I can handle a dark lord, dementors and an assault on my life at the end of every school year but I can’t not faint when I realise something life changing).
"Guests?" Draco asked. Lucius smirked at the two soulmates who were intertwined under a blanket on the sofa. "Yes, guests. They wanted more information and I suspect one of them is going to try and give you a sex talk..."
"That's so sad." Draco whispered. "Yes it is." Severus agreed. "Harry, do you feel in pain anymore?" Harry startled. "Ummm, no actually... did - did Draco heal me?" Tom nodded, "Yes, when you two bonded, the red light inside the golden sphere represented your pain Harry. The bit that came from Draco was due to his nose but the rest was from your beatings." He glowered darkly. "I can't believe those filthy muggles abused a magical child." Tom muttered quietly, but not quiet enough for Harry to not hear. Harry chuckled into Dracos chest. "They paid Tom, but if I could, I would make them scream more. Suffer more. Oh well." Everyone else nodded in agreement.
Harry whipped his head around as fast as lightning to look at who spoke. The man wore a leather jacket with deep blue jeans and a pair of thick black boots. His partner wore the same but he was holding a leather satchel and had many scars on his face. The one who spoke had black shoulder length hair that contrasted to his friends sandy blond locks.
I woke up by falling onto the floor this morning. It should have hurt and it should have been cold and it should not have been a soft and quiet landing. But it was. And why is that, you may ask. Well, I landed on a bed of rose petals. Pink ones and red ones and the occasional white one too. There were so many petals. They were about twelve inches deep from the floor and I almost suffocated!
“I’m sorry Ginny.” Not. “I don’t know you that well and I have no interest in you! Now, please leave me alone!” Get off me bitch!!! She is such a whore. I literally saw her and a Ravenclaw dude sucking each others faces off yesterday and she now has an interest in me?!?!
"Draco... I can't eat all this. I'll be sick!" Draco  chuckled, "Well, eat as much as you can and I will finish it. Okay?" Harry sighed and nodded. Draco grinned and started to pick out his own plate of desserts piling it high. He got a few weird looks from the adults but he sniffed and glared lightly at them, challenging then to tell him to remove some. They backed off.
As he apparated away, he remembered Harry. He had obviously done this, the abuse and anger must have finally gotten to him, he thought with a grim smile. Shame he ran away, not it will take him a while to find him and keep him on a tight leash.
why you were being nice to the Slytherins and cruel to the Gryffindors!" Harry grinned. "Yup! I wanted to show I was in control now. Not them.
"But why is living together rare?" Harry said, voicing the question Draco was thinking. Tom sighed. "As I said, soulmates can only find each other when one is in immense pain. Most of the time, this pain they feel was due to a fatal injury such as a stab wound. The soulmates would recognise one another. They try to bond quickly but most bond too slowly to prevent the death of the other. The pain of being apart from your soulmate once you find them tears you apart and the sadness makes you kill your self. It is unbearable and I hope you never have to feel it. That is why it is so rare." The room was filled with a dull, gloomy silence.
I wish to discuss what I found in person, if that's okay. I have put too much in my letter and if someone were to intercept they would most likely go to Dumbledore. I have one more thing to tell you before I wrap up. Going back to my 'wellbeing' and my treatment worse than a house elf I wish to inform you of one more thing. If you couldn't tell by now, I am abused. They call me Freak and Boy. I don't know my real name till my Hogwarts letter. But it isn't just verbal. The physical abuse is serious. I will send a copy of my 'punishment chart' and the 'punishments' I have before I return. I don't think I will be able to get to Hogwarts in time and I suspect I will be unconscious for a day or two. Could you create a portkey for me? Please? It could just ditch me into the Infirmary at school so Poppy can treat me. If it is alright with you, of course, could you make it so that it activates itself after 2 days or something? It would be much appreciated if you can conform with my request.
"Oh Harry, why on earth didn't you tell me all of this sooner? I could have prevented the war from turning out like I did! You should have told me in 3rd year you git. I love you too! And now your in my arms, you're not leaving. Ever."
"Boys! Wake up!!" Narcissa's voice pulled Draco and Harry from their sweet dreams. She had walked into Draco's room to wake the soulmates up and had found them spooning on top of Draco's covers, still in their clothes from yesterday. The dragons on the bed spread were curled around the twins boys protectively making Narcissa coo internally.
They were definitely naked but the funny thing was, the blond girl didnt have breasts... this was a guy!?!?! She peered at his face.
As one, they silently and gracefully walked over to No. 4. Lucius rapped on the door with the head of his cane and stepped back. A yell was heard from the other side of the door. "BOY!" Severus whimpered. Tom growled, Harry hadn't been lying. The door creaked open and a skinny, pale boy answered the door. His raven coloured hair covered his eyes slightly which had widened when he saw who was there.
Harry has been different since Thursday. It is now Saturday. I sent her the note earlier, no gift. She was doing her best to not look at me. I didn't realise she looked at me that often and when she started to ignore me, it hurt. Like, really hurt.
The train ride was soon over and Harry hopped off just behind Draco. He exited through the wall and spotted his relatives scowling at him. He walked briskly over, knowing the longer he took, the more painful his punishment would be at the end of the holidays. The Dursley's has made a chart. A chart for his punishments, showing what his crime was, and the type of punishment he had and the total time he would be punished for it at the end of the holiday. Last summer, he was punished for 2 hours and 43 minutes. He hated it but it meant he could get treatment almost immediately when he got back to school.

Wassup guys. 8th chapter is out. Woo! Dumbledore is a creature, can you guess what? There will be more hints later, but for now, I would love to see your ideas. Comments make me smile so :-)
I live with my gorgeous spouse in Hogsmeade. No one knows who we are as we hide. We aren't ready for the world to know. We just want peace.
This is in 1st person but I wont tell you when the person changes. It will be pretty obvious who they could be lol.
With all my planning I forgot to eat so when it was time to go to Hogsmeade, I hadn't eaten anything. I swiped a juicy, green apple off the table and bit down into it as I walked out of the Great Hall with Pansy and Blaise.
She looks gorgeous wearing that in her hair. I wonder if she knows she does. I was silently musing over which gift to give her next as I stared at her through history of magic. She turned around and looked at me. I smiled at her and faced the front of the class. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Hermione and Pansy smirking and a blush evident on Harry's cheeks.
‘Oh Harry.’ Draco whispered. He clutched the broken boy to his chest and rolled them onto their sides. He brought his legs up and moved Harry so he was trapped between his legs and his arms. ‘I love you too. Always have, always will. I’ve been in love with you ever since I saw you in that robe shop. I just didn’t realise it. Not until recently. It was Pansy and Blaise who brought it to my attention.’
As Harry tries to sleep that night, he wonders if Draco likes him too. He wonders if Draco really cares about him. If he doesn’t mind the fact that harry is broken and scarred mentally and physically.
Ron glared and spat at them before he lumbered off. The students around them were gaping; some with jaws on the floor, others squealing from cuteness overload.
"My poor Harry." Draco mumbled into the ravens hair. He stroked the back of his head in soothing motions knowing that this was a difficult topic for his soulmate. Harry smiled sadly before continuing. "Did you read my chart? The punishment one?" Everyone nodded. "If I do one thing wrong, I get a specific punishment for it. Depending on the situation depends on the severity of the punishment. Dudley, my cousin, was a bully. Not just in the house but outside too. He was the reason I didnt have any friends. Yet another plan from Dumbledore. Since my parents died my life has been controlled. Its tiring." Harry sighed.
“What do you think ferret?” I spit making him chuckle slightly. I raised my eyebrow. I was not expecting that.
I look over to Snape. He looks wasted. Like literally. Is that a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand? He bloody needs it with this two prats yelling over there. Fuck,
He saw Draco's shining eyes look back at him before he closed them and pushed his tongue hesitantly into Harry's mouth. Harry whined when he felt the Slytherins tongue swipe around his mouth, his own tongue dancing with Draco's.
"Only if you use my proper name, outloud, so everyone can hear." He gestures to the hall, especially Granger, who is now out of her seat tiptoeing over.
Ginny shrieked and ran out of the house crying as she went. Harry breathed in deeply a few times to calm himself down. When he felt he was calm enough, he turned around and slipped back into bed and clutched onto Draco. He noticed the blond was shaking and sniffling.
"Your right, Draco can't do magic outside of school. However, there are 4 adults who can." Tom said before stepping between Vernon and Harry. Draco looked over at Harry. He was just sat there on the floor gaping at Tom.
"She looked at you didnt she?!" Pansy whisper-yelled at me. I blushed darker and smiled at the ground before throwing a quick glance back at Harry. She was looking at me still. I am pretty sure my face is a tomato now.
Later on that day, in the Room of Requirement, two bodies could be seen cuddling in a huge soft bed. They had been like that for ages, comfortable to be in each other’s embrace carding gentle fingers through hair with soft, loving touches. You could hear their voices drifting slowly around the room, hardly disturbing the silence that had settled.
"Har, have you met her? She loves chocolate and snow and shopping and the colour red (even though she is in slytherin) and she loves-" "okay mione that's enough. You sound as if you have a crush on her." Hermione scoffed. "Me? I have a crush on her?? No, it's YOU! It is YOU who has a crush on her. That's why i know all this stuff about her! You wont shut up about her. Perfect Draco with her perfect skin. Perfect Draco with her perfect hair that shines so perfectly in the sunlight." She teased me making me blush.
Harry had a sinking feeling that Dumbledore was a part of this scheme too. He should watch his back. If only he had agreed with the hat in First Year then he would be with the Slytherins. Maybe he should toy with the Gryffindor's for a bit, act cunning like a Slytherin. Harry hummed, yes, he should play with the Gryffindor's. This will be fun!
Draco sighed in fake exasperation. “But harry loveeeeeee. I want to make sure you’re okay!!! I’ll carry you?”
Draco hated his 8th year. The only thing he loved about it was the fact he had a flag. It was like a massive blanket and you could use it as one too. On it, you can decide the colours, the writing and the designs. He had his as Draco Malfoy – Gay as fuck – Anti Social as fuck. It was an emerald green with silver writing. The pattern was much like the British flag but just green. It was on his bed as a throw for now.
The Gryffindor blushed at what his soulmate was insinuating. He sighs exasperatedly, trying to hide how he is really feeling. "Fiiiiiiine." He said, getting up and wrapping the blanket around himself. "Oh, dinner is in about three hours, so you have plenty of time." Lucius said, winking suggestively. "You can pack and repack your trunks as many times as you want."
Severus rolled his eyes at his husband's impatience. "Calm down love, I'm getting there." Tom grumbled and Severus smiled at him fondly.
“Get out of my way ferret.” Ron sneered as he fought his way through the crowd to get to his charm’s class.
When I saw Draco walk into breakfast I stopped breathing. She was breathtakingly beautiful. Her thigh high boots were a gorgeous black leather that finished just over her knees and that green turtleneck. Why does she look so good in turtlenecks??
Harry smiles softly watching Draco as he sleeps, tracing his facial features with his eyes watching him breathe deeply. It is so warm and Harry never wants to leave. He wants to wake up like this every day for the rest of his life. He blushes slightly at the thought. That is when molten silver eyes meet his emerald green ones. ‘Harry,’ Draco sighs, ‘Did no one ever tell you it’s rude to stare?’ Harry blushes more and looks away. Draco chuckles and tips Harry’s head back to him, forcing eye contact. ‘I don’t mind.’ He says. ‘I’m only teasing.’ Draco smiles at him making harry giggle and Draco melts. He pulls harry even closer and harry does not complain, just snuggles into Draco and relaxes. Draco grins at feeling Harry snuggle into him more. Maybe he likes him back. He gives a content sigh.
I just want to say, I have had one kiss EVER. Like, it was a press of my lips on my boyfriends for like 3 seconds. I was 15.
He pushed Draco onto his back and laid him down onto the table before claiming his mouth in a harsh, demanding kiss. Draco moaned almost instantly and bucked his hips up, still slightly hard from their makeout session out the front of the shop. The Gryffindor growled low in his throat before attaching his lips to Dracos neck and pushing himself down onto Draco's waiting groin.
When Draco settled down again, Harry breathed out a sigh of relief. He pulled his flag more securely around his shoulders to make sure it doesn't fall and wake the sleeping Slytherin, and slowly leaned down towards Draco's face. His eyes wide open, heart hammering as he took in the sleeping boy below him. Face relaxed, beautiful eyelashes stroking his cheek as he dreamed, lips partially open as his breath rushed out of them.
"Nothing to say? Well, if not, I am finding Draco's room and I am going to pound him into the bed. I have missed my husband you know."
Pansy at least had the decency to look chagrined. As she smiled sheepishly at me I looked her over. It had been a few weeks since I last saw her. She had to go with her parents for a trip to Spain. Apparently, someone was interested in marrying her and wanted to see if they were compatible. Although they were not, she still stayed the whole 3 weeks and had a gained a glorious tan that I was certainly not drooling over. Her nails were painted the usual blood red (a fresh coat though) and she was wearing her favourite skirt.
"To come into my room, kiss me and run." Draco interrupted, slightly bitterly. Harry flinched. "Yes, but there was another thing I had to do if you woke up." He trailed off, looking at the ground.
"Trying to spank me already Draco? My, my. You are very impatient." Harry teased whilst Draco stood there in mortification. "Harry!" he whined making the raven-haired laugh again.
"WILL YOU TWO CUT IT OUT ALREADY? I'm sick of hearing you yell you're surnames at each other. Why are you yelling your surnames anyway?" I screamed, effectively halting any conversation.
"What. Is. That." I pointed at her necklace, glaring at it mutinously as I fingered my own necklace with the Malfoy ring on around my neck. My fingers are really chubby and I get scared that I won't be able to take it off even though I could use magic. Pansy looked amused and played along. "Oh. This?" She picked it up with a nail and asked innocently.
Woah!!!! Harry is such a drama queen. 'Oh i just found out me and my crush are soulmates so I'm just gonna go ahead and faint into his arms like a damsel in distress'
"So, when they red ball exploded, that removed my pain?" Harry asked. "Yes child. That is exactly what it did." Harry bit his lip thoughtfully. "If I get hurt again, would it heal like that again?"
"Oh and Mione, can you do my hair please?" I asked shyly. She smiled at me. "Of course! Now, lets find you some clothes."
By the time I managed to fit all the rose petals into the bag it was 6:13 AM. Merlin, it is too early for this. A rustling alerted me that Hermione was awake. She poked her head round her curtains and frowned when she looked at the floor. "What's up mione?" I asked.
Tom snorted. "Sure Draco. Whilst you're trying to console yourself, at the same time tell me something you like about Harry's ass." "TOM!" Draco yelled before slamming his head down the table. "There there," Harry cooed whilst petting Draco's hair. He got a weak glare in response and giggled. "Come on Dragon, eat up!"
His platinum blond hair was shining in the moonlight coming from the window. It was so bright and Harry wondered how he missed it. He slunk over as quietly as possible, trying not to wake him up, as he didn't want to confess to Draco. When he reached Draco, he was nervous and his hands felt all clammy and sticky. He was about to lean down and peck his lips when Draco mumbled and moved ever so slightly. Harry froze.
I counted to five before Harry seized up and stopped speaking. "Shit." He whispered. "Shit indeed Potter." Malfoy snarled.
Harry beamed at Draco and lunged forward smashing their lips together in a sweet but soon turned heated kiss. They eventually pulled away for breath when oxygen became a necessity and just grinned at each other, their love for one another reflecting in their eyes.
“Harry! Please just go on a date with me this weekend to hogsmeade!! I’m begging you! Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee!!!” Ginny whined.
The summer included Harry being belittled 24/7 and starved for the smallest of things. Once he was starved for dropping a spoon – 2 days no food. The Dursley's were harsher this summer – as if he could take it.
He took a breath before continuing. “I know his little quirks; he bites his lip in concentration, his eyebrow twitches silently when annoyed, he chews something when he is nervous and he cards a hand through his hair when stressed. I know how he likes to cuddle – the little spoon and I know what he likes to do in the morning when he wakes up. He has two routines – one when he wakes in my arms and one when he wakes up on his own. I won’t go into detail about them because it sounds creepy how I know them so well. I know how he likes to shower with a vanilla shampoo and shower gel. I know his sweet spots, his tickle spots. I know a goddamn lot of things about my boyfriend, Weasley, so piss off before I shove a broom up your arse.”
Ron lets go of Harry to attack Draco and watched as Harry slid to the floor. He swung his arm around to punch Draco but Draco dodged and so he missed and the momentum pulled him forward almost falling over. He growled and fixed Draco with a death glare. “What does a Malfoy want with a Potter, hm? Can’t be money. You have enough of that already, so what could it be? The connections? The fame?”
With a soft smile, she proceeded to finish waking them up. "We are going shopping today, for multiple things. First your books for this year and-"
robes - and kissed him full on the mouth. Harry squeaked in surprise before he let a muffled giggle loose between their lips and Draco smirked.
Snape looks exasperated - yes I know I just said a long word get over it - and I think he is seriously contemplating taking points from slytherin.
When Albus reached Harry's home for the summer, he noticed some things that you would most definitely not see at the Dursley's. Their door was ajar, and the whole neighbourhood was outside... That was strange. Were they holding a bake sale? No cant be, the building is on fire. He wondered how that happened. The third thing he noticed was the blood. Now blood in the Dursley household was not unusual, but in this quantity it was certainly eye brow raising. This couldn't have come from someone Harry's size. So whose was it? One of the crowds? No, they all looked fine.
“And then, only then can you ask him out, but you have to give about 2 years because he will complain that you don’t know him well enough and you might take him out to the wrong place. Got it?”
"Sounds perfect." Draco whispered and kissed him again, harder and more passionate than the last one. This kiss conveyed all the emotions they were feeling; love, hope, sorrow, hurt. It was a promise to the other that they would they would stay with each other.
Harry sighs. Enough thinking, time to try and sleep. He checks his watch. Oh shit, 05:59. He has been awake all night thinking about his sad life. Time go get breakfast done. He creaks his door open silently and creeps towards the kitchen. Once he gets there, he grabs the bacon, 4 eggs, bread, butter and the orange juice. He lays the table whilst the bacon fries in the pan. He places glasses in the relevant seats at the table and adds the carton of orange juice. He puts the fried bacon on plates and starts cracking the eggs. As soon as he cracked the last one, he hears heavy thuds from upstairs indicating that the Whales are awake. They stomp downstairs and situate themselves at the table. Harry quickly finishes breakfast up to avoid a confrontation with his Uncle and hands them their plates. He never gets thank you’s or good mornings. Freaks aren’t allowed to be greeted.
‘When suddenly I realised Pansy and Blaise were right. And I started crying. In front of them as well and they were so shocked. The Slytherin Prince, crying? Was the world ending? As I said earlier, only my family could make me cry, and you. And I told them. I was sobbing my heart out as I told them I did love you, I did have a crush on you.’ He chuckled remembering their reactions. ‘Pansy squealed and kept jumping up and down, clapping her hands whilst Blaise just stood there gaping. ‘I was just joking!’ were his exact words.’
Draco felt Harry tenses in his arms and cursed silently. He needed to make sure Harry knew his real intentions. He didn’t want Harry to feel like he was using him, because he wasn’t! There was something he has never told Harry, and he hates how he has to say it now but there really is no better time.
Sixth year, well, sixth year was when shit hit the fan. I obsessed over them, I couldn't care less if anyone found out we were dating. I just wanted them to be safe.
Harry slowly wriggled out of the bed he was in admiring the bedding as he went. He needed to pee. Where was the bathroom?
"That's the second time you have done that now. Did you not even realise you were doing it?" Severus asked curiously. Draco shook his head, "No, I didn't. I just had an urge to do it but I put it off. Apparently, I did it anyway. Which, not gonna to lie, is a bit worrying because there are some things I want to do but I shouldn't..." He trailed off and Harry frowned, "Like what?"
"What?" demanded Draco, annoyed with his embarrassing parents already and the meal hadn't even begun. Lucius' snickering turned to full-out laughing and he struggled to stay upright in his chair. His wife's smirk broke out into a grin as she helped her husband try to sit straight.
When he returned for 8th year, he was thrown into the spotlight again. It was brighter than ever this time and he hated it. He just wanted to see Draco, the boy he has been in love with for 7 years now, to see if he made it.
A way to remember whom you love but cannot have, to remember them in the worst of times but to also remember what you want is impossible, to know your love is unrequited.
I woke up to just a note on my bedside table beside my glasses. I pulled them on and picked the note up.
"I agree, but first shall we finish this gorgeous meal and then head to the sitting room for comfort?" Narcissa suggested glaring slightly at Tom for unsettling Harry. Tom smiled sheepishly and nodded in agreement. "Good." Narcissa said before Lucius clapped his hands once more and the food disappeared to be replaced with lots of desserts. Lucius smiled at Harry's awed expression. "Gon on child, take whatever you want and however much you want."
He looked under the table and scowled at the dog sitting by his legs. It whined. "Food?" Draco whispered. It whined again.
“Holy shit potter! Why didn’t you say anything!?!?! I have liked you since second year. I realised the moment I put that snake on you in the duelling club. It was also the um… first time I discovered a kink of mine… parseltongue….” He blushes furiously.
"Here are your flowers. On the house today. Bye Draco! Dont get too wet!" Harry waved the blond out his shop and grinned when he got a smile in return. He couldn't wait to fix bridges he thought he had destroyed 10 years ago.
Harry scoffed. Hogwarts is his home not that blasted Muggle house. He sighed and stood up, packing his schoolwork away as he went. He walked out of the common room, down the stairs and through the castles cold corridors until he reached the Headmasters Gargoyle. "Flying Saucers" As the Gargoyle moved slowly, Harry started to get impatient. Honestly, why couldn't he have a portrait like everybody else does?
Draco places his hand on Harry’s shoulder and feels his heart break when Harry flinches and throws himself away from Draco. He crawls into the corner of the room whimpering. He keeps whispering things like, ‘Please don’t hurt me. Please. I’m sorry sir. I’ll be good I promise.’ Draco wants to cry. How could someone do this to the most beautiful person ever?
Harry woke up disoriented. Where was he? Why wasn't in pain? It took him a minute to remember what happened. He gasped when he did. He killed Vernon. The Malfoy's and Snape rescued him and Tom too! And, what was that bright golden light around him and Draco? It was pretty but very painful at the same time.
"Or, we could make bracelets? Not friendship ones of course... better ones." He whispered in my ear. Oh Merlin. I can just picture his lips as they move near my ear. My tummy is doing somersaults and I feel like crying for some reason. Does he mean what I think he means?
Six Gryffindors were inside Harry's dorm playing truth or dare. They hadn't been able to spend much time with one another for ages as school was piling up, but they settled into their old ways of joking and laughing quickly. The Golden Trio, Neville and the gayest couple in Hogwarts – Deamus as Luna named them – were sitting in a circle with their flags on their shoulders. Harry's was silver with the words Harry Potter – The Boy Who Gayed – Single Pringle in a black thread. Dean's had the writing Dean Thomas – Gay 1 - #No.2 Deamus Shipper in white thread on a purple background. His boyfriends, was Seamus Finnegan – Gay 2 - #No.1 Deamus Shipper in a purple thread on a white background. They had an argument about who was the first shipper of themselves and eventually came to an agreement that Seamus could be the first shipper only if Dean could be Gay 1.
He always tried to work out who it is, but only in his free time, never on a walk. It was fully grown, so must be an adult, or seventh year up. That narrowed it down a bit. It had multiple scars across its back and one on its face, but many were on its legs hidden by its long shaggy hair. Draco knew someone with shaggy hair like the dogs. It couldn't be him, could it?
"Draco! Why are you crying?" Harry asked frantically. "You kicked her out for me. You chose me over her. You defended me. Why? She was right! I am a Death Eater!" He sobbed into his hands.
Gasps from the students and staff surrounding them dragged Draco’s attention to them and he flushed pink before putting his mask back on. He turned to Ron and said, “Piss of Weasel. You’re not wanted here.”
He padded around in the dark trying to a light switch but then remembered. His wand! He silently accioed his wand and waited for it to smack into his hand. When his wand arrived, he cast a silent lumos and screamed when the room lit up. There they were; the Malfoy's, Tom and Snape sitting on chairs, well slumping in Draco's case, wide awake looking like they were scared shitless. Harry was breathing so hard and he had almost pissed himself with fright. He heard Draco giggle slightly before muffling it. He glared in his direction.
I was looking at it through the window on the Hogsmeade weekend previous. My admirer must have seen me looking at it. God, I don't know who this is but I feel like I could fall in love with them. I hope it's D-. No I can't hope. I have to get over her at some point. She is never going to notice me. Not in the way I want her to.
"Come along beautiful boy of mine. We must get you gorgeous clothes to go with your breathtaking body." Harry laughed before waving goodbye to his godfather and his werewolf.
Tears streamed down his face. "Surely, I deserve to love and be loved in return? Forever?" Harry's voice cracked as he sobbed into Draco's shoulder.
She kept fingering the necklace during the classes I had with her. She did it when she was nervous or unsure. She. Is. Adorable. I noticed many people asked her about it. Harry (My love) said she was being courted but was very tight lipped after that. I noticed she was getting frustrated with the questions so I decided to distract everyone's attention. It was quite easy really. All I did was ask her who it was from. She said her courter and so I said (quite loudly so everyone heard) "Your courter? Well, good luck Potter. You're very lucky. I am sure everyone wishes to be courted so grandly which is probably why they are trying to suffocate you."
“Harry what the fuck?!” Ron shouted at me. I flinched and huddled into Draco more. He stopped stroking me and instead clutched me closer whilst glaring at my best friend.
He noticed Draco was still shivering so he made himself comfy before pulling Draco onto his lap again, trying to get the Slytherin to warm up. He pointedly ignored everyone gaping behind him, smirking into Draco's hair and waited for the house elf to reappear. When it did, he covered them in blankets and dished out their hot chocolates.
“Ginny I think he needs to breathe…” I say as I see her drape herself across him. Bleugh, what a slut.
Harry merely hummed in response and looked around the room again, seeing if anything caught his eye. He sighed and sat down gracefully on the chair in front of the Headmasters desk. Albus' left eye twitched as he watched Harry sit. Since when did he get so graceful? He is supposed to be clumsy. Oh well, more important matters to discuss.
"I'm bisexual actually. Only people who know are me, Hermione and Draco. And now you." Ginny watched as Harry's hand crept around Draco's waist and pull him close to his body, making soothing motions with his thumbs.
Draco knew the nightmare’s not going to stop anytime soon, and he had classes the next day. He opened his curtains and tip-toed to his trunk, not making the slightest noise. He clicked open the trunk, accioed it, and twirled the glass vial. He knew it was not ok to take it nearly all days in a week, but it was his only hope; he gulped it in a take and walked back to his bed, sealed the curtains and didn’t see the need for a silencing charm. The last thing Draco felt was the fluttering of his eyes, the effect of Dreamless sleep.
The fact that he was not the only person in the Manor to receive owls that day was unknown to Draco.
He pondered the idea of going back where he spent half his life, escaped every year from a megalomaniac before getting himself killed; finally, killed the megalomaniac there, notwithstanding also saw his home destroyed, lost people he loved. Harry wasn’t sure if he really did want to.
‘Certainly shopping! Have you forgotten? School shopping. We have to buy books and robes and quills and caul—’ She didn’t get to finish the sentence as they groaned, slamming their heads on the table.
I hope you and Mrs Malfoy are doing well. I can neither understand nor empathise on what you’ve been through at such a young age. You should understand we were at war, and we had to make our choices. The choice you took was to save your family. I can understand if you don’t want to take up your N.E.W.Ts, but I will be delighted if you do.
Draco did his night toilette, changed his pyjamas and locked his curtains. He didn’t know if he should put up a silencing charm or not, but decided to. When he drifted to sleep he didn’t hear their sound anymore.
squawks and embracing tepid rays caress, the boy woke up. The faint sun rays flooding the room, tinged his porcelain skin a pastel beige. He nestled into the cot hogging the sheets all the way to his chin, curling up further. The bed was snuggly cuddleable and the room had a mellow warmth, swathing him like additional blankets.
‘Oh Harry’, her voice softened. ‘I know it’s too much for you with everything. Yes, the place now holds awful memories, but it’s also where we grew Harry. You can’t forever avoid and forget it happened. At some point we really will have to go there, you do understand that, right?’ she said with a sad smile.
‘And it’s called enjoying your “Me hours”’, Weasley said, Draco could literally see that self-satisfied smile on Weasley’s face.
He got dressed, gelled his hair back, all in fifteen minutes,— Weasley still hadn’t returned and Potter was reading some muggle ridicule— a record indeed. It was just half past seven, too early to go to breakfast, but he didn’t want to spend any more time there.
He turned to see who it was and was not surprised to find Potter. But Potter was not approaching him; he was walking to the other side of the trees— a row of trees and bushes hid him from Potter’s view.
‘Draco! I'm not here to play twenty questions with you, but since you asked. Theo is off to Beauxbatons, Greengrass’ too. Greg, I think is planning to move to the States. Millicent, I guess will be returning.’
Weasley and Granger were walking with entwined hands. They both looked the same,— Weasley in his ridiculous jumper and Granger with a book; bickering, smitten. He also spotted the Weaslette, but her hand was not entwined with Potter; that piqued something in him. Potter has changed.
He placed his chin on the knees, looking over the lake. His mind was calm, not a thought ran across, he was not thinking about anything; it was just blank. But to him it was calm before the storm.
‘Come on, the train's about to leave.’ He began to walk not waiting for an answer or for a question, he made it to the train without further hexes.
But in a flash, he went pale like a dead man as signs of life left his face. The tiniest hope of being a free man died that instant.
The next time he woke, it was due to a loud crack; startled, he swiftly bolted to grip the wand he used these days.
‘You in that bed Ron and I near the window.’ Potter grinned and Weasley scowled, making Potter grin wider ear to ear.
Harry smiled inwardly, gratitude in heart and didn’t understand what he did to receive such fierce loyalty.
He stood there staring into nothingness and lost in depths, ruing the decisions he made that nearly killed him, being a puppet, following his father to the shit hole, not brave enough to stand up for himself, all for what? All he did wound as naught. At last Draco Malfoy was a failure to the Malfoy name, a disappointment to his Father, a blood traitor to the Death Eaters and an ex-Death Eater to the world.
‘Us?’ he blurted out and immediately wanted to hex himself for idiocy. It was so plain, wasn’t it? If he received a letter, then everyone must have.
He was awake, but didn’t dare to open his eyes, for the fear this comfort was just a dream in his nightmare— nightmares of fire, pain, blood, suffering, death, War. He wished to sink further into his bed, if possible, and enjoy the pleasantness present instead of remembering the unpleasant days.
‘Dray, leave it’, Pansy countered, he heard a mix of pity, annoyance and loads of anger in it; which he completely ignored.
Draco knew. He knew what was in there, yet he gasped. Because in front of him, laying there in the box, wrapped in ethereal lustrous silver fabric, shimmering light only for him, was a familiar wand. The one that was snatched from him, the one he longed to get back for days, the one he thought he’d never see again. His 10 inch long, Hawthorn wood, unicorn hair core wand! It looked exactly the same as he’d seen the last time, not marred by a soil.
‘I'll let you know Mother.’ Draco placed the letter and parchment in the envelope as he rose from the chair.
‘I don’t know Mother’, Draco replied with a frown, he envisioned the idea of going back to the place he nearly destroyed, ‘I'll think about it.’ Fear intensified in his stomach at the picture of numerous What-ifs flashing in eyes.
When Draco woke up, there was literally a voice battle going on, Potter and Weasley! Fuck! He cursed for not putting up the Silencing charms. It couldn’t be more than half past six.
‘Yes. Fine.’ Hermione breathed, placing an envelope in front of him. Harry quirked an eyebrow up at her and glanced at Ron who gave a shrug. He placed the cup aside and picked the envelope.
‘Well he is’, Pansy piped in. Draco nodded in acknowledgement, absentmindedly. Because when they entered the Great Hall it quietened immediately, not even a single whisper or murmur passed, and everyone was looking at them.
‘I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
One day here and he had got hexed, shared a dorm with Potter and Weasley— and was alive—, had disgusted looks from everyone, had a heart wrenching nightmare, been throwed insults, had an article about him in The Prophet.
A sudden push, he tripped, hitting his face on the train windows. ‘Death Eater scum’, a Ravenclaw girl snarled, strode past them. Immediately his hand went to grip Pansy and Blaise to stop them from moving, he shook his head.
‘Must be the Nargles. Try to get off with it’, she cut in and continued with her pudding. Sometimes he really got confused if Luna was talking about the Nargles or the problem.
Since they were late only the last desks were free; and Harry and Ron were more than happy for a last bench,— Hermione took a seat across them— except that meant sitting behind Malfoy! But that’s alright. They can be like the other didn’t exist.
A sudden loud noise stalled them killing the silence, his hands swiftly went for his wand, a Portego ready to roll out of tongue. They turned around to see a group of reporters jolting towards the platform. Which was none other than The Golden Trio, who were hounded. Everyone on the platform sprinted to greet The Saviour, who was trying to move past them.
Ron and him shared an amused grin. Godric! That was in first year. They looked at Hermione who was all flushed, she was burning them with her eyes and grumbling.
The scene that greeted him when he appeared after quite some minutes was nothing unusual, — the couple made sure to visit six days a week, letting him sleep on Sunday for the past week— Hermione scanning The Prophet whilst Ron prepared breakfast.
The sorting hat sung on unity, friendship; a song really needed after a war. It was Professor McGonagall who placed the hat on the first years. Once the sorting ended she climbed to the Owl Podium for a moment, he thought her eyes were tearing up, but she cleared her throat and began to speak.
Distraitly he munched on his breakfast, face cold and neutral as always. One would say his looks were like everything was normal and there was not an article about him— because that’s how Malfoys are supposed to be and he pulled off the look brilliantly. But there was pain within his heart which no one needed to know; he sealed all his emotions and feelings at the back of his head, because he’s there only for the NEWTs and will never turn here again. So all he needed to do was adjust for a year, focus on studies, get good results in NEWTs and leave the place immediately. Just studies, no drama nor fun.
‘So we’re going to make goody-good memories!’ Ron sing-songed, clapping his shoulder. He exhaled dramatically as she released, causing Ron to chuckle.
He needed air, he needed to get out of bed— which grew more and more packed— and run out, but he couldn’t move. His body was limp and stiff; simultaneously. He put his hand over his heart, trying to soothe the heartbeat which went faster than normal:
‘'Mione. We still have a month and half to do all shit.’ Ron complained, which Harry knew was a terrible thing to say.
‘Yes Mother’, he said, taking a seat across from her. Draco didn’t understand why his Mother refused to take the seat at the head of the table as she was more capable than his Father. Was she expecting him to take that seat with him becoming the Lord of Malfoy Manor?
‘No! Don’t! I don’t want to know. Believe me, I. Really. Don’t. Want. To. Know! Yes, you can have my owl all day, all night, but spare me the details.’ Ron shrieked, covering his ear, colour of his face matching his hair, and Hermione no better.
‘Do go on. Continue your laughter. Don’t let me stop you.’ They doubled over laughing, Pansy’s eyes almost tearing up. He very badly wanted to strangle them and hang them upside down. He glared at them, because
‘Yes’, he returned promptly, but the smile on face still. His friends crystally knew he was hiding something, but didn’t voice it out.
They had Transfiguration the first hour which meant sharing class with all eighth years— the thing is, since only less pupils returned all core subjects are to be combined. And this meant the only peaceful hour was Ancient Runes, because none in the eighth year had taken An—.
Draco peeked to welcome the image of bluish sky fading to meet the lazy yellow, which edged to orange and red with hints of grey lingering in clouds, the amber hue sun peeping its face from behind the clouds was a perfect half pumpkin pie. Rolling over he cast a Tempus. Sighing as it was just minutes past dawn he drowsed to a dreamless sleep, lulled by the warm rays coupled with dim squawks and chirps.
He had a choice, either go or no go, but Draco didn't want a choice now. He wanted it to be a stern “Yes, you should come back!” or “Don't dream about coming back!”. He felt like one half of himself fighting against the other. As two core choices, Hogwarts and home-school were vigorously battling, trivial choices like go to Beauxbatons, States and drop studies— engaged in buffoonery.
‘What?’ Hermione questioned, who caught him smiling. Harry just shook his head, still smiling. She raised an eyebrow in question, but decided to let it go and turned to Ron to continue their— bickering like an old married couple— heart to heart talks or so they called it.
Hope you’re good. I apologise for not returning it soon. I tried to catch up with you after the trial, but wasn’t able to. Sorry.
He didn’t know who he was asking, but he begged it to stop. His already stained cheeks were washed and stained by the new tears that flowed. More scenes just came flooding into him; The Death Eater meetings, the cries in the dungeons, the shrieks of the elves; it didn’t have a look to stop and neither did his eyes.
For the umpteenth in a single day he lost himself to depths of mind. He knew he needed to make a decision soon and he did, with an aid from Potter’s owl. The owl from Potter had patiently waited for a reply all noon, not letting a hoot. Draco didn’t want to make it wait anymore. He wrote back.
They took a seat at the Gryffindor table, Ron and Hermione opposite to him. The first years walked the same way as he walked,— gaping like a fish— he smiled.
Ron.’ Potter’s voice was hurt which did something in his heart. And that was why he turned the knob and opened the door just by crack which Potter and Weasley didn’t notice. They were on the verge of catching each other’s collar and he didn’t know what they were fighting for so early.
For one, he was wearing clothes that actually fit him, a black leather jacket over white t-shirt paired with black trousers and half tied white trainers which made him look... hot. He must have worked out in the past days, his biceps were quite muscular. Sure Potter had gained some weight, but nonetheless he looked scrawny. Evidently, an attempt was made to tame the mop which had failed terribly. Potter carried himself with sort of grace and smoothness rather than with clumsiness as usual.
‘So, they’ve invited everyone or only some?’ Harry quizzed with a particular platinum blonde in memory as they completed their breakfasts.
Wait! So Potter and the Weaslette are not together? How? How? How? How did they break up? When did this happen? Was it in The Prophet? Wait! He shouldn’t listen to them talking. Draco close your ears! He was not eager. Okay! A bit.
He wanted to leave because it was creepy to listen to someone else talk. No! Why should he leave, he came here first. If it’s to leave it should be them.
Piles of food and pumpkin juice filled the plates and goblets. He grinned at Ron and they began to devour the food, Hermione rolled her eyes, but there was a glint of amusement in her eyes.
Pansy just rolled her eyes waving her hand for a chair. She sat stiff and had a stalling look, unsure whether or not to speak. He regarded her with a suspicious look gesturing her to spit out. Pansy, who didn’t get the signal, continued stalling him, but the corner of her eyes caught a glimpse of the envelope. On Seeing the letter, she slouched and made herself comfortable. Draco, watching her with meticulousness, got a vague notion of what was about to hit him— “We’re going!”
He replayed the memory of seeing Potter running towards something and being caught by the Ministry workers. He didn't for a knut think it was to catch up with him. Draco tossed the parchment to Pansy and saw her squint at the same places he did.
‘I know, I know, mate’, Harry spoke before Hermione can begin a row. ‘I’m not forgiving nor forgetting.’
Then again, Draco never had a choice, did he? Because what leverage did his words hold against The Saviour.
He glanced at The Prophet, the sight of a familiar mop of black hair over the front page welcoming him. Potter was wearing a grey t-shirt and denim trousers, and seemed to be walking down the Diagon Alley, carrying a bag and looked… hot! Not that he would admit it out loud Potter was hot or the fact he fancied Potter. He ogled for a beat as Pansy’s voice echoed, “Your gay is showing.”
Miles away from Wiltshire, a raven-haired late teen was aroused due to the banging noise on the window and roaring floo. He pulled the pillows to his ears burying his head like a sandwich between the pillow and bed to block the noise, sinking deep into the bed wishing for further slumber. He groaned when the person entered the room— at this ungodly hour— without any knock. So that must be Ron, Harry thought inwardly.
Of course he knew he couldn’t avoid and forget it, he’s just not ready to visit, yet, act like everything was normal when nothing was; as memories, no nightmares cross his mind. Why can’t she understand? He just need time to sort things out for himself. Now he can’t, can he? He frowned.
‘It’s not easy 'Mione. The place was home to me, and the last time I was there, half of it was broken to grounds. It’s like all the happy memories we’ve had has been replaced by blood and crying and… ’ he trailed off leaving the sentence unfinished, but words outspoken. ‘You don’t understand’,  Harry added.
‘Right. Right’, she said, her ears and cheeks flushed with laughter. She was trying real hard not to laugh again. ‘Enough of that. Poor Draco. We’ll go to bed now. Okay?’ He turned to storm out of the room when Pansy yelled, ‘We need details. Goodnight.’ Killing them is never going to be a crime.
After a ten long minutes’ stretch— brain supplying reasons from working as a servant to being offered a Headmaster’s post— Draco completed the meal; unheedingly. Wiping his hands in a napkin, he broke the seal.
At the high table Professor McGonagall took the Headmistress chair, there was Slughorn, Flitwick, Sprout, Hagrid, Hooch and two more people he didn’t recognise. One was a pale skin, short, lean woman, her black hair a high tight bun, square glasses, grape colour robes with silver buttons and a gracious smile. The other woman was quite muscular, maybe two or three inches taller than him, slightly tanned, some scars in her neck and face. She was in brisk red coloured robes, sandy blonde hair in a ponytail. He turned to his friends asking whether they knew who they were. Ron shrugged and Hermione shook her head and eyed him to listen.
His shoulders loosened and grip slackened only on seeing the round bulged eyes with mink coloured iris dissolving into black due to fear stared at him. He exhaled slowly as the house elf bowed so low his nose met the wooden floor.
From unearthing answers for puzzles and riddles to discovering solutions for every mischance of the hour they were in till date; was the bushy haired witch, the brightest witch of the age, his hugger.
They ate in comfortable silence, when an owl entered the room; a grey tawny owl carrying an... envelope. It was not Pansy’s nor Blaise’s, Greg and he were not talking, Theo is on vacation, so who? Perhaps it was for his Mother. His guesses were interrupted when the owl landed in front of him. The instant the letter was removed, the owl took off, not waiting for a treat.
‘Come on Draco, she’s a bitch and we know that’, she said. Draco sighed, nodding his head slowly. He glanced at the High Table and saw Professor McGonagall looking at him through the corner of her eyes. He groaned internally, he shouldn’t have come back, he knew all of this would happen and still returned.
The entire ride he talked randomly, answering and quipping at necessary places. To Draco it felt like just minutes when they reached Hogesmade, but it was hours. He could vaguely see the castle through the window, it had been rebuilt, some places were yet to be done. The Astronomy tower needed some more work to do, but more or less it was to its former glory.
Really awesome days! Days when his Father would take him flying, Mother would spoil him rotten with sweets, days playing around the Manor with Pansy and Theo. Days when his worst nightmare was to be swallowed by a chimera; and deep within he knew it’s never going to happen again;— innocence— it was childish to want it, but it would be nice.
‘Potter and Weasley’, he gritted out. Pansy snickered and Blaise was biting his lip, trying to control his laughter.
‘Now just a few more words, I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.’ Her eyes for a moment caught Harry’s.
‘Yeah.’ Harry said in a sullen voice. ‘Ummm… Ron… before that, can I borrow your owl?’ He didn’t understand why he was uncertain, though knew Ron would never say no. Then why?
With a shake to his head, he walked to the common room to find Pansy and Blaise already there. It must have been a shock— to find Pansy who would wake up only around eight, to be dressed from top to toe; Blaise however was a morning person— but he wouldn’t be ready this early. He wanted to ask if they are normal, but he knew better than to voice it and not when he was ready this early, which is not usual for him.
It was not supposed to be much of a shock because after sharing home with The Dark Lord, of course, he could see thestrals. The thing was, he didn’t know whose death it was. He turned around to see his friends, Pansy nodded with a haunted face and Blaise nodded with a shrug.
Harry went to the kitchen and put a pot of tea on the stove. Feeling ambitious, he began pulling nearly ingredients out of the refrigerator. Nearly an hour later, he sat down with his tea and eggs benedict.
“No, but we could work something out, right girls?” Jeanine looked to Cindy and Cassie, who continued to nod.
“Honestly, I don’t think I would have taken it seriously then. But now, I really want to give it a shot,” Harry told her. “Sorry to spring this on you so suddenly.”
Harry threw on some clean clothing and apparated to campus. He hurried to the alchemy building and headed in the direction of the lab Draco worked in.
“Now, as I indicated in your acceptance letter, we are happy to have you in our classes, but most of our faculty had already accepted students for their practical studies by the time we received your application.”
Ignoring that, Harry began flipping through the newspaper, tapping random paragraphs and translating them to English. Near the back of the paper, he found the advertisements. A promising ad read “ALECHEMY STUDENT SEEKING TIDY ROOMMATE NEAR THE UNIVERISTE MAGIQUE DE PARIS, ROOM OPEN IMMEDIATELY. SEND INQUIRIES TO 212A RUE DU GRAND VENEUR. NO UNDERGRADUATES.”
Harry certainly felt like an outsider, with no previous classes or work experience in arithmancy. Still, when Professor Norwood began lecturing, he was entranced. He felt like Hermione, taking more notes than he, in all honesty, ever had taken in Hogwarts.
Draco and Pansy appeared suddenly in the living room of the flat. As they arrived, Harry seemed to jolt awake on the couch.
They walked side-by-side in silence for a while, hands brushing occasionally. The shops were all closed, but under the light from the streetlamps they could still admire the displays in the storefront windows.
Living with Draco, to his surprise, was actually quite tolerable. Draco was rarely home, and when he was home, he kept to himself. He was also quite tidy, something Harry couldn’t always say about Ron, and the flat was quite nice. Plus, Harry never walked in on Draco having sex with anyone, something else he couldn’t say about Ron and Hermione.
Harry picked up his trunk and took a deep breath. He'd been planning on apparating, but he was hit with a wave of nostalgia. Instead, Harry made his way to King’s Cross. At the counter he asked for one ticket to Paris, France.
After Harry’s meeting with Vivian and Sara, he attended his second lecture of the day before heading home. With his, or rather Draco’s flat, being fairly close to campus, he decided to walk home. On his way, he passed a café which reminded him he still needed to go to the store. He made a small detour to pick up some pantry staples before heading home.
Harry took a deep breath before getting out of bed. But when he left his room, he realized the shower had already stopped. In fact, it looked like Draco had already left the flat.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco murmured. He muttered an incantation under his breath and gave his wand a flick. The leftovers and wine flew into the refrigerator which opened and closed itself at the right time.
“You have to love magic,” whispered Harry. He realized they still hadn’t released hands. He turned to face Draco.
Pansy made her way to Draco’s room. As she stepped past Draco, she shoulder checked him and said, “Nice pants, darling.”
It didn’t take long for Harry to pack. He was a wizard, after all. With a few flicks of his wand, he filled his trunk with a few pieces of clothing and toiletries. He removed the signed Cannons poster Ron had given him for Christmas from his wall and carefully rolled it up.
Draco started to move towards the refrigerator, but Harry stopped him. “Please, sit, I’ll get you a bowl.”
Puzzled, Harry walked to the kitchen. There was mail on the usually tidy table. Harry picked up the letter, addressed to him. Draco must have let the owl in as he slept. He opened it and found a cryptic message in Hermione’s distinctive scrawl across the page.
His lovely, sweet, caring and straight girlfriend was fucking around with the oppositions teams. In the changing rooms she was named The Whore.
"On the walk over to Gringotts we spoke. I learned how he has been treated, what his friends think of him and who he knows and thinks he can trust. Strangely, although we met like, 20 minutes prior, he felt he could trust me. I mean, he trusted me enough to tell me of his crush on a certain platinum blond haired, grey eyed slytherin..." Fenrir smirked at Harry's discomfort whilst Draco snorted and Harry blushed.
Draco's bed had a velvet green throw on top of a white bedding. Hiding on the bedding, emerald green dragons flew around at the sight of Harry and blew small flames. Harry giggled and walked over slowly, stroking the dragon's scales. They purred beneath his touch and rolled onto their backs. Harry laughed and gazed around the rest of the room. There was a walk in wardrobe to one side, an extra door, for what Harry suspected was a bathroom, a huge bay window overlooking the Manor's gardens and there were shelves full of books. There were so many books that the shelves were bending under the weight and some were lying on the floor in stacks.
Harry gulped. "I-I like you. Like more than a friend. I mean, I don't even know if we even are friends but I want us to be well more than friends and my friends, the bastards, pressured me to tell you 'cos they were apparently sick of me pining after you and so here I am telling you that I like you very much and its okay if you don't like me back but when you reject me please do it kindly 'cos I have like you since 3rd year and this will be hard to get over but I think I may actually love you and-"
I got dressed as she replied. "Although my mum was called Lily, Father always bought her roses. They were her favourites, especially red ones. When I was born everything I owned had a rose on it. All my shirts, onesies, pyjamas, bibs, bedding, towels- everything you name it, had at least a rose on. When I am 18 I'm thinking of changing or adding rose to my middle name or surname. I'm not sure which yet."
I slump into my arms, once again reminiscing how much I missed him. How much I missed his strong arms, firm chest, warmth, smell, his laugh. Merlin, I even missed his atrocious hair!
I scowled at Hermiones grin before walking out the dorm with a 'see you at breakfast' yelled over my shoulder.
Stepping over him, I said, “Draco chose me, you chose me. Let it be known that I choose Draco.” And with that, I threw myself back into Draco’s arms. “And I accept you harry.”  Draco whispered into my ears.
Okay, Wednesday morning and I got another hair accessory. It is so beautiful it makes me want to cry.
I slowly felt myself falling asleep, already planning ideas and colours for our matching boyfriend bracelets.
Vernon was trying to breathe but he couldn't; it was like the fire had spread to his lungs. He started coughing or at least tried too. It was quite hard with a teenage boy on his chest. He could feel blood on his back and chest and wondered where it came from. He was vaguely aware of other screams in the background but the pain in his body was excruciating. His veins felt like they were boiling. Was this how lobsters felt when they were boiled alive?
He slowly and softly placed them on his face, gently stroking his cheek with a thumb. ‘Hi Harry. How are you feeling?’ he looks him straight in the eyes that had captured his attention all those years ago. ‘Please don’t lie to me. I just want to help you.’
Harry gulped before turning to Draco's door. He waved his wand to check for any charms and found nothing so he quietly and carefully opened the door. He slipped in silently closing the door behind him. It was pitch-black meaning Draco must been asleep. He tiptoed over to a bed, it was against a wall under a bookshelf but there was no body inside. He looked around, confused. Then he saw him.
I'll ask Harry later though, they have finally finished yelling and now I can concentrate on making my potion. Mione says if I dont finish it and get at least an acceptable then she'll drag me into the library for 3 weeks straight! That's torture that is!
Draco smiled faintly, stroking Harry's face. It's silent for ages. The men had migrated to the sofa and were clinging onto each other for support. "I think it doesn't hurt as much because I think I might've moved on..." Harry said breaking the quiet atmosphere.
Harry was sharing a dorm with Neville for 8th year. Their room just so happened to be the biggest, no one knew why, not even Minerva. She suspected it was Hogwarts showing her gratitude at protecting her but she wasn't quite sure.
And a final one, I'm thinking of keeping Drarry as switches. No specific top or bottom and everyone is happy. No fights pwease 🥺
“Hmm she did didn’t she?!” he laughs and I can’t help but smile softly. I love his laugh, makes me happy. “Ginger whore huh? I call her the Weasley slut but I prefer yours more I think.” He laughs again. “Wait…!!! You like me too?!?!”
?? Have you lost your mind? Skeeter would have a field day!" Sirius scolded. Remus rolled his eyes in exasperation at his partner and Harry groaned and buried his face into Draco's chest. "Oh,  also, have you two snagged yet? That sexual tension I saw in your third year was
I turned back around to join Pansy and Blaises conversation, not noticing my cheeks had blossomed a pale pink. Pansy noticed my flushed face and poked Blaise.
Harry's lips formed a silent 'oh' before wriggling out of Narcissa grasp and hesitantly moved towards Draco. Silently, Draco opened his arms wide and Harry launched himself into his arms still crying slightly. Draco kissed the top of his head again but didn't blush. He had made Harry- HIS HARRY - upset!! How could he do such a thing?!
The movement brought a delicious moan from Draco and Harry bit his Adam's apple sharply as another moan bubbled to the surface. Harry laved his tongue over Draco's neck, sucking, licking and biting, adamant to leave a mark. The blond withered beneath him and burrowed his fingers deep into Harry's hair causing him to lift his head from his soulmates thoroughly bruised neck and moan loud, punctuating his pleasure with a desperate, hard roll of his hips.
Draco grabbed Harry by the hand and practically dragged him through the thick crowds of people doing last minute shopping. Narcissa huffed and tried to keep up but eventually lost the boys. She knew where they were heading and so she set off towards Mr Coalfield's Dress for Any Occasion.
On the 15th meet with Harry, Draco had an idea. Harry should confront her and then break up with her. Say they are over forever. Harry was a bit sceptical at first but decided he would do it like that. Ginny was unfaithful. Harry was not gonna deal with her shit.
"Uhh, I can explain!" He managed to get out whilst he had a 16 year old cutting off his oxygen. Harry laughed happily and then pulled back giving Fenrir enough space to breathe again. "Dont worry Fenny. Its okay." He reassured. "You know those muggles I told you about? I asked Severus for help and they saved me! Although that wasn't what I asked for but I'm not complaining."
This may come as a surprise and you are probably wondering why I am writing to you. Please read the whole thing. You don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes, just read the whole letter and I will be very grateful. It will be a very long letter and I suggest you sit down with a glass of something strong. It will help – trust me."
"Well, how else am I supposed to show how much I missed you?" He smirks at me and starts to drag me out of the hall, grinning wickedly at all the shocked, blushing and smirking faces in the room.
Fenrir shuffled his feet and sighed looking down at the ground. "It was the first week of July? I think? And, I was in Knockturn Alley looking for some stuff when I was approached by a child. The child was covered foot to head in soot from a fireplace. They had obviously said the wrong word when stepping into the floo." He broke off, looking at Harry asking him how much he wanted to tell them. "You can tell them everything Fenny." Harry's voice soothed his fears.
: HOT, GOOD ASS, SNARKY, SARCASTIC, WITTY, HANDSOME, AWESOME AT QUIDDITCH, HAS DADDY ISSUES, SLYTHERIN PRINCE
As I craned my neck to look up at him, I felt something in my hair. Something heavy. Soft yet gentle. I frowned and patted my head. I was
Knowing you Professor, you are probably confused as to why I called my 'best friend' by his surname. I discovered something very interesting before the holidays. I am not sure if you are aware of where the Weasels and muggleborns loyalties lie, but know for sure that they aren't with me. They never were. They lie with fame, money and Dumbledore. I know you are a spy, and I'm pretty sure it is for Riddle not Dumbledore. How on earth did you manage to convince the old coot you were on his side? I congratulate you; it must have been challenging.
Draco sneered back. “Oh, my bad, how could I get in the way of one third of the Golden Trio? How rude of me. I’ll be seeing you Weasel.” He turned to walk off but Ron retorted.
He has told Albus time and time again that they treat him like scum. He told him that they hit him, smack him, burn him, cut him, scratch him, starve him, bruise him and scar him. And does Albus care? Not one fucking bit. He said to Harry - "Harry, my boy, please stop telling lies. I'm sure you making things out to be worse than they actually are." Harry was furious when he heard those works come out of Albus' mouth.
"Yes, I do." Said Lucius as he stood up and left the room. He came back a few moments later with a dish of water floating before him. It rested on top of the coffee table beside Harry's and Draco's half finished desserts. Draco cleared them off and a house elf took them away. Slowly, Harry extracted the needed memories and dropped them into the pensive. This process was silent, no words were spoken by anyone; they were all waiting in anticipation.
My body shivered, my cheeks warmed and my pulse began an erratic beat beneath my skin. Draco grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the exit. As we reached the magnificent doors, he looked over at the teachers sitting in shock and gestured with his head. Out. Now. We then walked hand in hand to Albus’ office.
"#DRARRY IS REAL!" he yelled, arms wide open, head back as the whole school looked at each other in bewilderment. Had their Professor finally gone nuts? Did the potion fumes finally get to him?
Harry sighed, "I have been... surprised this week. I found some information about me." He looked at the old man who had a slight look of alarm in his eyes. "I discovered that... I have some powerful ancestors in my line. Did you know that? One had a demon inheritance. I read about it in one of the books in my vault. Very interesting it was." Dumbledore's look of alarm had faded slightly however he was still wary. "It was a very informative trip to Gringotts. I went over my vaults with Grapclaw and-"
"To be honest, Hermione, I thought you were Umbridge for a moment." I smirked at her as she flushed red before glaring at me. Draco giggled into my chest, his tall, lanky body shaking as he laughed.
Another package was by my bed. This time, it was a lighter red than yesterdays but was still a beautiful colour. After I had smashed my glasses onto my face, I picked up the box and unwrapped it. The note was lying on top of the tissue paper.
Draco sighed quietly and looked down at Harry in his arms who was in a similar state as the crowd. He looked at Draco in shock. “I-I-I thought-“
This may come as a surprise and you are probably wondering why I am writing to you. Please read the whole thing. You don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes, just read the whole letter and I will be very grateful. It will be a very long letter and I suggest you sit down with a glass of something strong. It will help – trust me.
"You're being a prat. Stop being mean to me." I pouted and played with the end of my hair. Blaise and Pansy just laughed. Bastards.
Severus stopped and glanced at his guests. "If I were you, Severus, I would read the whole thing. There's no harm in that, is there?" Narcissa assured him. Lucius was next to her, nodding his head. "You can choose if you want to read the whole thing aloud. It is addressed to just you so we would be imposing."
I just thought I would say, that I am actually winging this book. I have no idea what happens, I am legit making it up as I go along.  There are some things that are fixed, like Dumbledore's creature and the fact the 'Dark side' rescue Harry and that this is a Drarry book but one thing I just randomly decided was to make Drarry soulmates. What can I say? I'm a sucker for soulmate Drarry.
The hall was silent by now everyone waiting to see what would happen next. Hermione gasped again. “Oh Harry. You have just come into your inheritance right? Malfoy here is an alpha but it confuses me as to why he is so interested in you. You are clearly an alpha too. You’re a powerful one though, just like him.” She inhales sharply. “Harry! This explains your magical outbursts! You couldn’t control your power at the time but now you’re fully changed, you can!” I gaped at her, then Draco.
"Yes Dragon, that is the other plan for today. Play dress up with Harry. You can pick his clothes, if that's alright with Harry of course." She looked at Harry before being startled by Draco's shout of "Fuck yes!". A fist pump into the air accompanied this exclamation, making Narcissa frown and Harry giggle.
Looking back over the years, at our animosity towards each other, I feel like it was meant to be. Just hear me out a second. Draco and I always had our attention on one another. We were always seeking each other out and we had to see for ourselves where the other was. Looks across the great hall, small taunts that could be as concerned questions and the never-ending eye contact. Oh, and do not forget, that moment in third year when he LITERALLY CHECKED ME OUT! I guess you could say the signs were all there.
After a while of silent contemplation on various subjects in various minds, Draco spoke up. "You called us down? What for?"
Malfoy had come into his inheritance as an alpha, and a fucking powerful one too. This led to rumours spreading that if Omegas existed; he would be an Alpha powerful enough to have one. Malfoy did not taunt us that much anymore, it was crueller teasing. We all believe he is just concentrating on finding his mate (although they do not exist) to bother with annoying us.
I swagger into the full Great Hall, acting as if I haven't just disappeared for 12 years. Acting as if I own the school.
The Hogwarts potions master was in a meeting with Tom Riddle and the Malfoys in Spinners End when an owl tapped on his window.
The bodies in the bed shuffled even closer whilst they slept. Although she should be mad, Ginny found it quite cute. However, she wanted to know who the girl was that had captured Harry's attention. He was madly in love with her, so why did he fuck this girl?
He sighed, couldn't they just put trackers on the students so that they know where they are, what they're doing at all times of the day? This would make life so much easier.
"How can somethiNg be so cute yet disgusting!?!?!" Ron shouted to the heavens, as of asking them for an answer. The girls giggled and Draco chuckled at the red heads statement.
"My cousin Dudley, is an obese kid who likes to use me as a punching bag. He gets fatter everyday so he has lots of clothes left lying around because his parents buy him new ones. I get the hand me downs. Most of the time, they are too large and fall and sometimes they have stains on" He stopped suddenly. "Who on earth would treat a magical child like this?!" he asked, furious.
"Language Draco!" Draco looked suitably chastised as his mother scolded him in front of his soulmate. He blushed before muttering a short apology.
"Yes, that is how my family brought me up," Ron replied sadly. Hermione opened her mouth to say something but Ron cut her off. "But, Charlie is gay, and I'm pretty sure the twins are pansexual and I'm bi I think, so it doesn't actually bother me in the slightest. My parents were angry when Charlie came out but they eventually warmed up to the idea. Its Ginny you should watch out for. She knows all the derogatory terms for LGBTQ+ people I swear. Its disgusting." He said, pulling a face.
I tangled my fingers into his hair, tugging on his curls when he stuck his tongue as far back into my mouth as possible before sliding it out, licking my teeth and rewarding me with the most wonderful sound. I swallowed the noise and tugged his hair again, desperate to get another noise like that out of him.
“Harry mate? What’s up? Are you okay?” Ron asks me with concern flickering through his eyes. “Um no, I’m feeling a little unwell guys. I think imma head to bed early tonight. Goodnight guys.” I replied pushing back my chair and hopping to my feet. Hermione gasped, “Harry!” I panicked. “What? What is wrong Mione??” My eyes must have shown fear and panic as she immediately stood up to calm me down. “No, no, Harry I’m fine. It’s just, you look beautiful, angelic.” She sighed. “I wish I could keep you.” She was staring at me longingly now swaying slightly where she sat as if she was entranced.
He read the letter aloud to the Malfoys. "I should probably start at the beginning. The very beginning.
As one hand was gripping my arse the other came to the base of my neck; as if to hold me in place as he ravished my lips. I moaned as his tongue swept through my lips into my hot, wet mouth. His nose was squished on my cheek and his glasses were poking me in the face but I didn't care. As our tongues danced, I kept imagining scenes where we were snogging and more and the thought made me excited. I wanted more. More of him. More of this. More of
“But Harry pettttttttttttt!!! Pwease!” she bats her eyelashes in what I believe she thought was a seductive way.
"I would have done the same Fenrir." Severus said softly. Tom sighed again. "And I too, would have done the same. Come, sit down Fenrir. There is much to discuss." Tom turned to Harry. "If it is okay, may we know what you discovered?" Harry nodded hesitantly. "I suspect it may be a long explanation as I would have to go back and explain some things. So to make things easier... does anyone have a pensive?"
Draco slumped with relief before grinning hesitantly at the Saviour under his wet fringe. "Cool. That sounds great! I'll owl...?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dog launched itself at Draco who just managed to catch it and started to lick his face. "Ugh! Ew! Bad dog- Bad dog!" Draco spluttered as he tried to push his bouncing companion away. The dog ceased immediately, and sat down looking ashamed and embarrassed.
After harry had calmed down and wasn't sobbing as hard anymore he pulled back and looked at Draco who had suspiciously gone still. Draco had fallen asleep in Harry's arms with tear tracks running down his face and a soft smile, and Harry melted. He smiled softly at the boy and picked him up bridal style before carrying him up to the school.
He turns around and stalks off towards the bathroom, and I follow cos how can I not when that gorgeous ass has a chance at being mine?!
Tom had found the other two muggles in the living room watching the TV. Well, they must have been before they heard the whale's screams. He trussed them up by the fireplace and set it alight. He left them there to be burned alive and relished in their screams of terror and pain. As he walked back to the hallway, he found the two younger boys encased in a golden light, Narcissa watching with a gooey expression on her face, Lucius had just spat in the fat muggles face and Severus was looking into the cupboard under the stairs.
"Because you didnt deserve it. Someone who cheats on you does not deserve to be broken up with face to face." Harry spat.
draco and harry were partners in potions class and about half way through started calling out their own last names at each other in potions class and everyone is confused when ron asks what they were doing and harry simply says arguing about who gets who's last name before going back to arguing realising ten seconds later that he had just outed draco and himself.
Draco cooed before kissing Harry on the head. “I literally could not survive without you, Harry. I love you so much to ever let you go.” He admitted with a soft smile. “Now, come on. Let’s get you to the infirmary shall we?”
But no. His friends don't love him. They just want him for the connections, the fame, the money. The person he wanted love from the most hated his guts. This person hated him for rejecting him. But the truth was, Harry didn't want to reject him. He was too busy staring at him with awe and he panicked. It was like someone else said the words but they came out of his mouth. He wanted to fix it, but the damage was done.
He stood there shaking like a leaf until Draco slowly walked over to him, making sure Harry could track his movements. He reached out a little too fast and Harry flinched. Narcissa gasped behind them. Draco decided to try again; he reached out once more, slower this time, and placed his hand gently, ever so gently on Harry's cheek. Harry closed his eyes silently and unconsciously nuzzled into Draco's hand. Draco couldn't stop the smile creeping up onto his face, just as Harry couldn't help the sigh that escaped his lips.
He grabbed Draco by the chin and slammed him against the nearest piece of furniture. This just so happened to be the receptionists desk. (She was out luckily.)
A/N - okay, so. Thoughts? Please don't mind my red face and ignore my embarrassment at actually posting a chapter when Drarry is getting more comfortable with each other. It is so weird writing smut like scenes when I'm not male and have no sexual experience lol. All my knowledge is from sex ed classes (fuck these classes - go away Sally) or reading Drarry smut... eh.
My best friend threw me my clothes for today. Today was the first Hogsmeade weekend where it was snowy and I can't want till I get to smash Ron in a snow ball fight. Hermione calls us children (we are 14, but still) and rolls her eyes before going back to her reading. I'm hoping I may be able to tempt her into a snow war today.
He watched as Harry shakily stood up before collapsing again. Immediately Draco was by his side checking him over.
3 hours later, 3 people walked out the shop laden with hundreds of bags full of clothes for one person. There were about a hundred more shrunk in their pockets. They trudged over to the nearest cafe to wait for the rest of their group to come finish.
Just past the eighth year door, was the War memorial, and it had everyone's names on it who died. He would pick a name each day, and mourn for them on his walk. Students and children he would mourn for during the weekdays but on weekends he mourned for teachers and adults. He never mourned the same name more than once.
Harry is sick of it. He just survived his worst year yet - and that is saying something. First year he had a murder/Dark Lord after him and in second year a Basilisk was let lose upon the castle. Third year he had another murderer after him who really just wanted to have custody of him but it did not seem like it at the time. One of his teachers was a werewolf too. However, last year, in his opinion it was the most traumatizing year yet. Fighting a dragon, saving your 'rival' from mermaids and then watching a nice guy be killed in cold blood would do that to you. Oh and to top it all off, the Dark Lord, Voldemort, moldy shorts, moldy voldy whatever the hell you wanna call him was resurrected and then promptly tried to kill him. Ah, life is great.
Slytherin, grey eyes, my whole house just growled at him, male and, now I actually look, striking platinum blond hair.
Harry took a breath. "Could- could you call me Harry?" He looked up at Draco. "Please? Was added as an after thought. "A-and could I call you Draco?..."
"Harry, I don't know how, but I have somehow got stuck in my shirt. Could you, could you help me please?" he asked, blushing but Harry couldn't see thankfully. Harry barked a laugh and shrugged his shoulders. "Sure!" He walked over, telling himself to behave and not do anything stupid and placed his hands on Draco's shirt. He started to lift his shirt up almost pulling it back over his head so he could detangle it when the door opened and a shout of "BOYS!" tore them apart.
Harry sent the letter with his trusty owl the next day. He then floo called his blond to tell him how it went. "She should get the owl soon. I really am just done with her." Harry said making Draco laugh. Harry's face adopted a confused frown causing Draco to stop laughing and enquire as to what was wrong.
"What are you doing?! You can't just have sex, Harry needs rest and Draco you need to finish your homework! And anyway, we need to speak to you about what happened at the muggles house!" Narcissa was standing their, furious as her husband stood behind her eyes glinting in amusement.
"Does it hurt as bad now? Or do you feel like it is unbearable even knowing what she had done. She hasn't cheated just once. She has cheated many times on you. How do you feel now?" Harry sighed. "It doesnt hurt as much as it did when I found out. It felt like my world had shattered when one of the girls told me. Now it's just a throb on my chest making me angry because how daRE SHE?! I loved her! How could she just throw away something as special as love? I know I had a shitty childhood and I didnt get any love. But surely I deserve that now?"
The Dark Lord sighed and looked down. Severus patted his knee in comfort and Tom looked back up to Fenrir. "Why? Why did you help him?"
Harry blushed, "Uh, yes. When you reject me 'cos you don't feel the same way." he mumbled looking down at the floor again in embarrassment.
I asked her who she thinks my courtier might be. She wasn't sure, but she suggested someone with lots of money. Ron thinks it is his sister, Ginny. She had a crush on me for like, two years but she is now dating Luna. He doesn't know! Shhh!
As the Gryffindors sat in Harry and Neville's dorm, the conversation started to turn into games such as never have I ever and Truth or Dare. They played late into the night, never leaving the room until one dare...
It had all started when he took a two hour walk after class. When the last class finished, he would walk to the eighth year tower, drop his bag and books off in his dorm and don a coat. He would then walk through the corridors and outside to clear his head, mourning for all the people who lost their lives.
“WEASEL GET OF HIM BEFORE I KILL YOU!!!” Draco yelled before trying to pull the furious boy off Harry.
We have been together for 19 years, married for 13 and dated for 5 years. (yes I know, the math doesn't add up and I am so confused lol. help?) We got together in my second year.
"I remember, very specifically, saying that you were to leave Harry Potter alone. Even if he comes to you for help. Which was unlikely." Tom's voice was as cold as his glare. "Explain yourself."
“Ah, you have trouble with flirting weaselette” Draco says knowingly with a mischievous grin plastered across his mouth.
“Harry potter is my best friend! Move!” bellowed a boy of 16. This voice belongs to Ronald Billius Weasley. He isn’t a very nice person and he uses people as we can clearly see. When he first met Harry Potter, he was 11. He was a sweet boy but him being Harry’s best mate got to his head and demanded privileges he did not earn. 5 years later, he believes he owns the school and can often be seen belittling his ‘best mate’. This caused Harry to have insecurities and he often believes Ron. It’s a toxic relationship, which Harry feels he cannot escape. Not even when he found out Ron was stealing from him.
The next time Harry did it, he was surrounded by Gryffindors and Malfoy nodded back before continuing his path down to class with a smug look on his face. This time, it was the Gryffindors turn to gape at Harry. (The silence was so thick; you could slice through it with a cutting curse.) Then, he was bombarded by questions by his fellow house mates.
"Food?" Tom asked. "Of course, dear guest. Where are my manners?" Lucius said and clapped his hands twice. Food appeared on the table making Harry gasp in delight. There were foods like roast duck in a sauce that goes with it (A/N – it is obvious I don't know what I'm saying? XD) with a load of vegetables surrounding. On another platter sat a variation of salads that looked very enticing. There were multiple breads and cheese lying around too, making Harry's mouth water.
Tom took a deep breath before dipping his face into the water. Severus and Lucius then followed. "Are you sure you want me to see Harry?" Narcissa asked quietly. Harry nodded. "Of course! Draco and Fenny too."
"Of course Lady Malfoy. Help yourselves." The man looked like he was about to cry. Narcissa Malfoy had that effect on people.
over me. The one thing I had over him when we were younger was my height. Now that is gone and he can lord it over me all he wants.
Harry and Draco meet about 4 times a week. Turns out, they got along very well. They both like the same quidditch teams, have the same views on the new Minister - Hermione Granger (both think she is brilliant) and they both are stuck on what to do about Ginny.
It wasn't hard to find or lose the Weasley's. You couldn't miss their bright red hair and they were making so much noise. People would glare at them as they passed and many were shoved to the side so the noisy bunch could pass.
Draco grinned. “Yes, Potter, it’s a plant. And you’re right, it’s toxic. Normally. However, about eight years ago, an herbologist had the happy accident of reacting some of the toxins from nightshade with some gillyweed extract. Turns out, the product is harmless. Hell, it’s better than harmless, it has several great medical properties, depending on the reaction conditions. We just don’t know why yet.”
The man, who had signed the advertisement and correspondence “J. R.” didn’t even look back at Harry. “Here’s the common space, and the kitchen,” he said, pointing.
“Briefly,” he admitted. “Not for long though. She got pretty busy when she made the Harpies. Traveled a lot. Didn’t seem like the time for us to jump into anything.”
“I don’t know what your game is, Malfoy, taking me out, kissing me, then telling me to move and giving me the cold shoulder,” Harry said bitterly. He hated how much he was giving away. His words and his tone had to reveal how hurt he was. How much he really felt something for Draco.
Draco jumped and turned to face Harry. “I was, Potter. So, I’m going to pour myself a drink and go to my room, unless you have any further questions about my whereabouts.”
Hermione didn’t respond, but Harry thought he heard her mutter “boys” as she stood at the stove, scrambling eggs.
“No,” Harry whispered. Harry leaned forward, finishing the job Draco had started. Just as their lips met, a loud noise made Harry jump,
Maybe it was the second glass of wine, but Draco chose to ignore the quiet voice. “Come on,” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hand.
Harry laid his eyes on Draco’s abs. Sure, he’d caught sight of them in passing in the morning. But now he could truly appreciate them. In fact, he realized all of Draco was lean and muscular. He bit his lip as be brushed his hands over Draco’s abs and pecs.
“Draco, I don’t know how to make it clearer. Every day I spend living with your drives me crazy. And if you want me to leave, I will, but I bloody hope you reconsider.”
Despite her short stature, Vivian moved quickly across the campus grounds. Harry had to maintain a brisk pace to keep up with her.
“I’m investigating the properties of a new class of compounds that was discovered in the last decade. They seem to have a lot of interesting uses, but we don’t really understand how they work. My advisor and I are trying to develop a more mechanistic understanding of how they work. Then, maybe in the future, we’ll be able to implement rationale design when we use them. Right now it’s a bit of guess-and-check.”
“Pansy and I stopped in once. Anything more than five years old is considered an antique. I think I saw the complete collection of Lockhart’s writing in here.”
Harry knew he shouldn’t have been surprised that everyone he met already had established their living situation. They hadn’t applied to the program as late as him. In fact, they had probably all accepted their spots in the program before Harry had even sent in his application. Still, he was becoming more and more desperate to move out.
“I could,” Harry conceded, “but I really want to immerse myself in the program there. Maybe I’ll even pick up some French if I’m living there full time.”
Harry slid Draco’s pants down, releasing his hard member. Wanting now him, Harry continued his trajectory, kissing down Draco’s torso until he reached his cock.
“Well, I know you didn’t write back but…” Harry trailed off again. “I was going to see if it was still available, but maybe this isn’t a good idea.”
Sunday was the only day Draco didn’t go to the lab. Instead, he preferred to have a lie in, waking up around noon and spending the afternoon unwinding. That’s why Draco was still in be when a small, brown owl tapped at his window. At first, Draco didn’t move, but the owl quickly grew agitated, tapping harder on the window.
But Draco didn’t seem particularly interested in Harry’s answer. He didn’t dignify the explanation with a response. He simply walked past Harry to the bathroom.
“But Potter, how could you understand this if you didn’t first learn what happens when you add the powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
He tossed some heavy cream and sugar in a bowl and began beating them furiously with the whisk. Once the cream had stiffened, he began spreading it over the top of the cake.
Harry’s grin faltered. “Ah, I see. Perhaps I should keep looking then, I don’t want to put anyone out-“
Draco said nothing as he walked into the kitchen. He grabbed some silverware from the drawer and started to walk to his room.
Now, it was different. Harry felt like he was surrounded by Hermiones. No one matched her brilliance, of course. But they were all motivated to work for hours at a time without a break.
there were several cat trees, each was currently occupied by at least one cat. Another cat walked up to Harry and rubbed up against his leg.
Draco let out a strained laugh. “Of course, you drive me mad, Potter. You have since you moved in. I’m living with the savior of the wizarding world, and he’s actually just a nice guy, a gorgeous guy, who likes to cook for me and talk to me at the end of the day and he’s fucking off limits. It’s my own personal Azkaban.”
It was almost nine when Draco got home on Monday night. Harry was in his room, reading an arithmancy book Hermione had recommended after dinner the other night. He got up and headed to the kitchen to get himself a glass of water.
“What, are you not The Chosen One?” Draco asked. “Do you prefer ‘The Boy Who Lived’ or ‘Savior of the Wizarding World?’”
When Harry got back to the flat, taco shells in hand, he immediately set to work cooking. He’d had a long day of classes and research, and he was ready to clear his mind.
Draco let out a deep breath and Harry continued sucking on his neck. He made started to move lower, kissing Draco’s chest, stopping at each nipple before making his way down Draco’s abs. When he got to Draco’s waistline, he stopped and looked up.
Draco didn’t acknowledge this, but he didn’t tell Harry to leave either, which Harry considered to be a good sign.
Harry held his breath. He liked where this was going, and he didn’t want to do anything that could interfere with Draco’s line of thinking.
By the time he got home, he had already forgotten about dinner. He set straight to work mixing ingredients. He poured all of his energy into his cooking. He was trying a new recipe from a cookbook he had borrowed from Hermione, a bittersweet chocolate cheesecake that looked absolutely delectable.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco cut him off. He looked up and met Harry’s eyes. “Are you just going to keep standing there while I eat?”
“Yeah, they are,” Harry said slowly. Was Draco actually interested in the affairs of the trio he had despised so much at Hogwarts.
Harry let out a laugh as well. “Yes, they were everywhere. And the apartment was…” he trailed off. “Not a lot of good options out there, but if you really want me gone, I’m sure it’s still available.”
“What about you?” Draco asked Harry. “Did you get back together with Weasley’s sister after it all went down?”
Harry furrowed his brow at Draco’s remark. “Anyone but you,” he said coldly. Harry turned, not waiting for a reply, and returned to his room.
Harry wondered how long he had been standing there. Broken from his spell, he quickly averted his eyes and followed Vivian.
“Sara and I think you’re catching on to the arithmancy material quick enough to start meeting with her more regularly. We’ll start having these weekly meetings in her office so she can stay looped in. Shall we head over?”
Harry chuckled at that. Draco paused for a moment, deciding whether or not to be offended. He decided to ignore it and raised his wine glass.
“Consider it a loan then,” she told him. “We’ll miss living with you, Harry. Are you sure you don’t need any help moving?”
Sometimes, Harry’s obliviousness surprised even himself. How had he lifted the letter right off the stack of papers and not seen the image, blown up across the entire front page?
Harry was working in the library on Monday evening when his stomach let out a loud rumble. The look from a woman at a nearby table told him that it was, in fact, audible to those around him. Harry checked his watch. He was stunned to see it was already past seven. He had spent most of the day in the library, read old alchemy journals and planning experiments to discuss with his advisors in their next meeting. Harry was constantly amazed by his newfound work ethic when it came to his studies. If he produced the same quality work back then that he did now, McGonagall would have accused him of cheating off of Hermione.
“Goodnight, Potter,” Draco murmured. Before Harry could respond, Draco leaned in and closed the gap. Draco softly pressed his mouth against Harry’s. Then he swiftly turned and went to bed.
Finally, Draco pushed Harry back slightly. “Better stop there,” he said. “I’m close, and I haven’t even gotten to be inside you yet.”
Draco made his way to the door and opened it. When he saw the man outside his flat, his jaw dropped.
“Potter,” Draco responded. There was certainly less hostility in Draco’s tone compared to when Harry had first moved in, but beyond that it was difficult for Harry to gauge Draco’s feelings towards him.
From there, Harry apparated back to the flat. When he got home, he made himself a sandwich. He rummaged around in the cabinets for some chips and an apple.
Harry’s clarification seemed to clarify nothing as the bewilderment on Hermione and Ron’s faces grew.
Draco let out a small snort. “I’m fine. I’m just not sure that you can handle your perfect reputation being associated with someone like me.”
Harry let out a loud moan as his pleasure climaxed. Just a second later, Draco let out a similar cry and the thrusting slowed.
Ron and Hermione looked at him, not as surprised as he expected them to be. There was a pause before Ron asked, “Is that all?”
“Wait!” Draco cried out as a he skimmed the letter. But the small owl, clearly irritated with Draco, ignored him.
This time, there was no pause. Draco simply leaned in and kissed Harry’s upper lip. He pulled back and looked Harry in the eyes. “I got it,” he said in a low voice.
Harry and Vivian continued walking in opposite directions. Harry found Draco’s lab and turned the door handle. It was locked.
A picture of Harry and Draco sitting together, leaning in and raising their glasses in a toast was printed right below the headline which read “CHOSEN ONE TAKES EX-DEATH EATER ON DATE!”
From what he could tell, Draco didn’t spend very much time in his own flat. Most mornings, Draco had gone for a run, or to the gym, and showered before Harry woke up, and he usually returned home around eight p.m.
he had really only asked Jeanine. But her reaction made him nervous to ask any of the other members of his class.
Finally, Draco stood and walked over to the window. He took the letter, and the owl rapidly flew away.
Harry followed Vivian into an old, stone building and followed her through a series of hallways that felt like a labyrinth. As they passed one room, a loud bang emerged and Harry turned to look. Through a small window, Harry saw a familiar figure.
The second problem was that Harry had started getting up earlier to give himself time to read in the morning as he drank his tea. This meant he usually saw Draco return from his run, out of breath and sweaty. He saw Draco go to his room and head to the shower a moment later wearing only his pants or a towel around his waist. This sight usually derailed Harry from his reading for several minutes. He had considered taking his tea back to his room to do his reading where he would be free of distractions. But then he would miss out on the view... of the sun coming in through the window behind the sink.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other. Hermione seemed to be attempting to suppress a smile but was failing miserably.
Harry had just taken a bite of his sandwich when he heard someone else arrive. He was surprised. Draco was rarely home before eight.
“Sure, I’ve made way too much for myself. I’m used to cooking for Ron and Hermione too, so if you want any, help yourself.”
He had expected Draco to storm off and ignore him. Instead, Draco didn’t move. “I guess it isn’t fair of me to ignore you,” he said.
Draco grinned. If he was aware of his proximity to Harry, he didn’t let on. “Who would have thought we’d be roommates after all that went down at Hogwarts, eh?”
Harry heard the shower running when he woke up, so he headed to the kitchen. After a few tries, he managed to turn the stove on and put a pot of tea on. Humming to himself, he didn’t notice when the shower turned off.
Pansy let out a small huff. “It was nice running into you, Potter. We really should catch up some time,” she drawled.
Hermione and Ron continue to stare at Harry as though he were speaking in parstletongue, so he continued.
Per usual, Draco woke up on Sunday to the telltale crack of someone arriving by apparition in the living room. Unusually, the crack was followed by a piercing scream.
“It was actually really interesting, and I don’t exactly feel like I gave school my full attention when we were at Hogwarts.”
As if on cue, Madame Rosmerta set clear drinks on their table. She smiled at Harry. “Good to see you again.”
Draco took a bite and let out a moan. “Seriously, Potter, drop out of grad school and become a chef.”
Draco gave Harry a rapid, cursory tour. “This is the den, there’s the kitchen. The stove is a bit finicky, sometimes it takes a few tries to light. Your room is down the hall, just one bathroom we’ll share. I leave pretty early, so I don’t think I’ll interfere with your morning regime,” he told him.
Harry’s eyes narrowed slightly. Draco took a large drink of his wine. Had he gone too far, quoting Snape on their very first day of potions class? Would Harry even remember?
Harry arrived outside his old flat via apparition. It felt odd apparating to the hallway instead of directly into the flat that he’d lived in for years. He faltered for a moment, trying to decide if he should knock on the door or just enter. Before he had made a decision, the door opened. It was Hermione.
Because it would be silly for a normal person to be frightened of the Dark Lord after he’s gone. But Draco had become a freak, he’s not and never going to be normal again.
It was nostalgic if he’s honest. Just like his first year, where everything seemed new and questioning. He can never forget the first time he’d walked through them. He’d wasted hours thinking it was a wrong decision to come back to Hogwarts, but no, he needed this. He didn’t realise he needed it so much until he took a foot to move. It was comfort and home.
With all aristocratic pure-blood efforts Draco schooled his expressions neutral, to avoid the look of eagerness. ‘Yes Mother, it can wait’, he said, more to himself as a reminder to be calm and was relieved his throat didn’t betray him.
He pushed open the door full, Potter and Weasley stunned for a second and continuing their bickering. Draco walked to the green curtain bed, sat in the corner, watching them argue.
It was sent to him, from whom? Draco deliberated over the possibilities as the script seemed to be knowing, albeit it seemed far. His memory came up with various shots like a film roll of handwritings of all his friends, yet none matched with the one in hand. He was damn effing sure he'd seen it before, but where?
‘Ouch!’ he yowled suddenly, stumbling as a sudden bolt of pain shot through his shins before he could begin to walk. Strong arms clutched around his shoulders from falling, Blaise’s, he knew once his mind registered what had happened. He knew what it was, a stinging hex.
He saw grey, scrawny horse-like creatures pulling the carts. His heart began to race fast like it was going to fall out any moment.
He was sitting in the middle of the courtroom, head low, whilst his solicitor was dealing the Wizengamot; who were not even merely satisfied as per him. After a solid twenty minutes of arguing between the solicitor and members, he was bored. He was sitting at his trial, his life at pinpoint, one side to freedom and the other to imprisonment, with a dozen dementors hovering above his head, and he was bored; that made him want to laugh at his own irony.
His mother who must’ve taken note of the expression change in his face stopped him in a nick of time before breaking the seal. ‘Draco, it can wait till breakfast is complete’, she said in
Boys? Does that mean Potter is gay? Is that why he and the Weaslette broke up? No, wait! Weasley first asked about girls, didn’t he? Does that mean Potter is bisexual?
He entered the dining room— which held its dark appearance, stony walls, cold floor, the only difference being warm and welcoming rather than cold and gloomy, regardless still holding traces of coppery blood smell, but a distant malodour— twenty-five minutes later after his morning toilette in navy blue robes simple, but elegant and ruffled hair.
Ron placed a cup of steaming hot tea which, he sipped contentedly, offering a grateful smile to his mate.
The ambience of the place was not joyous and turbulent nor grim and dead, it was something entirely different. It was tranquil. It was not an eerie silence, but the kind of silence you experience when words are heard without being spoken, feelings are felt without being expressed, emotions are seen without being revealed.
. He always knew it was beautiful, but now it was a different beautiful. It was nothing like the last time he’d seen it, —broken walls, shattered windows, blood spilled floor— it was striking.
He and his Mother were free, imposed with a fine, whilst his Father was to serve life imprisonment in Azkaban. Not that Draco complained, he knew the odds for his Father to be free were very, very slim after assisting a psychopath for not one, but two wars. One, two; two wars, he counted mentally. Still, it hurt somewhere nonetheless.
face in Weasley.  Draco straightened his pyjamas and walked to the bathroom without a word; but he could feel the piercing gaze of Potter on him and Weasley shrugging.
‘Oh! Who is this and what have you done to my best mate!’ Harry joked, trying to lighten the mood before it continues to
People stood close to each other, huddled at some distance. None were found running or laughing or shouting. People moved in soft footfalls. Some students were found hugging and kissing their parents, some engaged in muffled conversations with their friend’s parents, some students were standing by themselves with longingness and some began to board the train.
‘But we can’t go, hex his bollocks off and be like all our lives are normal. We don’t have to make amends and become friends, but if Malfoy tries to stay low then we also can, can’t we?’
His eyes widened as he turned to break the seal, an unknown feeling began to knot his stomach at the glimpse of the emblem crested in the seal. Swallowing thickly, he broke the seal to remove the letter, beginning to skim.
Mentally he began to prepare himself to live his entire life in Azkaban. What was he supposed to expect first, perhaps a dementor’s kiss or the highest ce—.
to The Dark Lord and the other… well Blaise because he was a Slytherin and hate for him was due to the stereotype “All Slytherins are evil!” And that was just the worst thing because no one really tried to understand what it was to be a Slytherin and who they really were; and it’s no use wasting time over them.
‘Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
What loads of rubbish does she even write! He turned to the Slytherin table; Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. It must be devastating to read something like this about own self, he knew how it’d feel. Harry wished he could speak to Malfoy, at least call a truce or something like that, something comfortable enough. He sighed, no use over it.
‘Tell Mother I'll join her in a moment Binny.’ The elf nodded and apparated with another crack causing his oscitant mind a wince.
Thirty minutes later when he exited the bathroom,— in a towel around his waist and a loose full sleeve shirt; of course he’s not going to go half-naked in front of Weasley and Potter with something ugly in his hand— he found Potter and Weasley in Potter’s bed; Potter’s hand counting five fingers and Weasley’s counting two. It looked quite weird.
‘Just sprained my ankle’, he lied and wandlessly numbed his pain. He didn’t want to lie, but that felt necessary for he was sure if he told them the truth they would rage. Pansy gave him a stern look and Blaise raised an eyebrow in question clearly stating they didn’t believe him. He loved his friends, he really did, but at the same time he didn’t want to make a scene before even stepping into the train. He sighed.
He was so exasperated by people making choices for him. He breathed slowly trying to remain calm, undoing the urge to lash out his anger and annoyance.
He wanted to leave before Potter noticed, but also wanted to enjoy the silence and he went on with the latter. As long as they didn’t know the other was there, there can be no issues. And so Draco went back to look at the glossy water whilst Potter stared at the sky. Okay, maybe it was nice too.
a letter? Of all the things he imagined this was not one of it. With more thoughts he turned to the second page skimming for details.
Everything changed with the exception of those obnoxious(charming) round wire frames and the bottles green eyes glimmering like the glossiest, richest, emerald stones made by fine craftsmanship. The expression on his face was something he quite didn’t know how to put it. It was neither bright and happy nor dull and grim.
Two options popped up in his mind: Either they must have noticed me only now,— 1% of it agreed to this—or some real shit happened or is going on—99% of his brain went with this.
Harry’s mind was pleased to no extent because there was treacle tart! It’s not like he hadn’t eaten it in the past days, but Hogwarts’ treacle tart was the best as per him. He nearly filled his plate with it, smiling.
Before he could come with a retort an unknown owl landed in front of him in a whoop, which unlike earlier, had a rolled parchment and a package to it's leg. The owl took a seat at the windowsill as Pansy offered treats. He checked the parchment for curses and unfurled it once there seemed to be none.
And for that Draco didn’t have an answer. He could have refused it, but he didn’t; not because he wanted it, it was because he was scared to say no. The voice within accused and spoke all his mistakes.
He was thinking of all possibilities about who the other one was. Did Potter and the Weaslette have a child? If so it should have been in The Prophet. Did he miss it? Or did Potter have a secret child with someone else? Did Potter have some secret lover, with him being bisexual? Salazar’s left nipple, who the hell is that person? Okay, so it’s a task.
‘I’ve not yet decided’, Draco said, placing the book on the table, in a blank tone before she could begin.
Draco looked in the mirror to find his hair dishevelled, small black bags which stood contrasting to his pale skin under his eyes, crumpled pyjamas. A mess is what the mirror showed. So it’s going to be like this in the forthcoming days.
As the feast got over Professor McGonagall rose to the podium once again. ‘The Defence Against Dark Arts post will be handled by Professor Redwood’, she said motioning towards the sandy blonde woman. ‘And Professor Nora will be handling Astronomy.
The colour of his face drained when he saw the seal’s crest. The emblem— divided into a snake, a lion, a badger and an eagle—
Unexpected! Are Gryffindors really that oblivious! Even the Slytherins placed bets on when Weasley and Granger would get together, it was that obvious.
4. A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration (Book-2) by Emeric Switch (if studying N.E.W.T. level Transfiguration)
Draco very much doubted that. They were walking down the platform of nine and three-quarters, Draco scooped between Pansy and Blaise.
Sighing, he looked up to meet the mid-day sky, watery-thin clouds drifting across the crisp azure and a glowing golden medallion aloft. It felt like energy required for a century’s thinking, was spent in just a quarter day mulling over and over whether or not to go back.
‘Merlin’s beard 'Mione. We'll go today alright.’ Ron said, turning to him for back up . Harry nodded eagerly.
‘Pansy! We made a deal not to talk about my crush and especially not in the common room.’ Pansy and Blaise snickered, rolling their eyes.
But wait! Did they two forget they are sharing a room with another person, because from the time he’d had woken up he didn’t hear his name being said.
‘You-Know-Whooooo’, he remarked, eyeing Hermione. He grinned at Ron on his choice of words, making the girl flush. He and Ron doubled over, whilst Hermione fixed them a stern glare.
Harry stood gaping at the massive doors. He knew what Sirius meant back then, but now he understood what it was. It really was nice to walk through those doors as a free man, not much responsibility, no need to walk towards death, no running for life, no more drama; a good, peaceful year. The sole responsibility on his shoulders at present was to complete his N.E.W.Ts and he was sure there won’t be an addition.
‘So, how was it?’ Pansy spoke as they exited the common room. ‘Well mine wasn’t bad, not good either, Patil seemed fine, Granger and I didn’t share a glance.’ Pansy said before he could get a word out, but that was predicted.
See this was the entire problem; everyone was afraid to speak to him— not in the bad way— like he was made of glass; and would break if not been careful. He hated it. He’s a murderer, be it killing a good person or an evil person, it’s still murder, isn‘t it? And here people are pitiying him, including his friends, which he definitely didn’t need!
He saw them having an eye conversation, and Weasley walked to the bathroom. Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter, who just shook his head slightly and turned away.
‘Locomotor wibbly’, he breathed. The way it reacted was something he thought he could never get tired of. It was as if it had never been snatched from him. Fierce loyalty was what it presented. She shrieked, stumbled for a moment before her mind registered.
It was Colin’s death that said to fulfill others’ wishes, small things which he could do, not take them to dates or anything, but he can fulfill a young girl’s enthusiasm to get an autograph or a young lad’s verve to get a photo, but not to this media— because we never know what happens the next minute, do we?
! Fan-bloody-tastic! Certainly Professor McGonagall must have lost her sanity during the battle. Why else would she send
‘'Mione! Malfoy was nothing, but an annoying pest all six years, and you forgive like that, after everything he did. That git nearly killed me! And don’t forget we saved him too!’ Ron retorted.
It was almost illegible according to him. The words were messy, a bit sloppy. Some letters were slanted left, some to the right and some straight. If one observes closely they could notice that even the same letters didn't look alike, but one letter was. The g’s. So perfectly crafted that made it look apart from the letter as if it was written by another person.
‘We’re going in glamours, okay?’ he insisted,  remembering the nightmare of a trip last time just cause he forgot glamour. Hmph! Can’t even spend hours peacefully with someone he loves. Harry slumped at the thought he can’t have a normal, like really normal life.
He wanted to go to his Mother, lie in her lap and weep,— the last time he had lain on his Mother’s lap was after taking The Dark Mark— like he used to do when he was a child, fighting nightmares with her.
He handed the letter to his Mother who was scrutinising her son for the entire period. As she read the letter, he picked up the small parchment and unfolded with trembling fingers hoping it was not a prank.
‘Oww! You clotpole’, Blaise shrieked, dropping the paper and snatched it away. He didn’t want to throw a stinging hex at Blaise, but he needed to know what was in there— oh, and he was glad none noticed. He read despite Blaise’s groans.
Ah! Shakespeare! Any other time Draco would’ve picked a fight for it, but something stopped him. Something said no, don’t. They sat in a comfortable silence for some minutes before Pansy chose to return home.
