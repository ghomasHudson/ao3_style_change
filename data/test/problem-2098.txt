“You just like seeing Sev faint,” Draco teased Tobias gently. Severus growled as those present chuckled.
His gaze wandered to The Pack to find them all on their knees, bowing to the magnificent pale-skinned, black haired woman that was holding back the enraged form of one Tobias Regulas Riddle.
Lucius scowled at her and hit her with a silencing charm while Draco checked the fire and its content.
“Not a problem. I’ve checked both him and your daughter. Both are just fine and are being watched over by Miss Patil while her father aids with the old man. Your house-elf vanished just a moment ago to get your Healer, father and the Aurors. Is there anything I can do for you?”
Harry had glared at him, saying, “I don’t need to prove myself to you, Draco Malfoy, and as it is not your things that will explode if I drink, the choice is not yours to make.  If Professor Snape and Remus want to use me as a guinea pig, they can – even though I don’t like it.”
Amelia hid a smile before yelping in panic as the floor beneath her vanished. Her only consolation was an answering scream from Lucius, indicating that he had received the same treatment.
Enjoy!!!!! :3
“So in other words, I’ll be a sex-crazed cock hound with no inhibitions and a fetish list that never stops growing,” Tobias summed up, removing his face from Draco’s shirt and snuggling into him, eyes drooping slightly.
Chapter 43
“Aw Sev, I never knew you cared,” Tobias drawled from the shadows close by them, making the three of them jump. “I apologize for not being down sooner, but I had a cute blonde to convince to stay in bed. He wanted to come with me.”
Algernon and Amelia looked at the Healer with astonishment.
“What made you think that?”
“Nothing really,” he grinned at them, pulling out a sheet of parchment and quill. “So who is doing what?” As his Pack playfully argued over who was doing what, Tobias found himself thinking that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Can I give you a suggestion, youngster? Use the meditation time after this to think about what we said and about the future. Use the meal as a time to focus on your husband. Use this as a reminder to yourself to keep some time of the day for time with him and your family. If you take this advice to heart, then many of the situations that will cause problems between the two of you will be easier to overcome. Don’t be afraid to talk to him. It is clear that you both love the other.”
“Wow.”
“Are you ready, Bi?”
Hermione sat on her bed with her arms wrapped around her knees. It had taken less than an hour for her parents to notice she wasn’t herself and she had found herself sitting across from them after their dinner the first night back with a cup of tea in her hands. By the time she was normally in bed, she had told her parents everything that had occurred the previous year, leaving nothing out. She would never forget her parent’s response.
Draco nodded. Tobias closed his eyes and called up his white fire. Narcissa gasped at the beauty of the scene before her. A moonlit garden with flowers so white they looked to be made of fine china. A delicate and sweet scent filled the air and Draco locked eyes with his fiancé, both of them remembered the kiss from earlier.
When he was released, Tobias turned to the two ladies before him. “Lady Longbottom, Professor McGonagall. A pleasure to see you both.”
Chapter 7
Chapter 5
“Then seventh years are our aim for today,” Lucius stated before turning to Amelia. “Have you thought more on Bi’s proposal?”
Draco had only just walked back into the room when his father got the first – and weakest – band off.  He watched in fascinated horror as each band broke and the magic level of the room grew til he could feel it pressing against his eardrums.
Now, all she had to do was discover what Ronald Weasley and Gregory Goyle had to do with tonight’s injuries and hand them to a professor. She smirked. It had been a long time since she had seen Severus torture – I mean interrogate – students. Maybe it was time to pay him a social call.
The attached piece of metal was flattened and had a double ring at the very top with the top ring slightly smaller than the lower. It was here that the chain that was on Draco’s spine was attached, locked in place by a D-lock.
Time slowed for everyone in the Hall as the dried blood coloured spell sped towards the intertwined couple who didn’t have time to move out of the way.
The Pack crowded around the table as they watched Pansy in silence. Before the girl sat several lengths of parchment, each with a name on the top of it.
“How could you eat that?” one of the green-faced females muttered so Tobias wouldn’t hear her.
Zog grinned. “I AM here on Official Business, Akzant’tra. I am here to congratulate you on your bonding and to present you with The Mother’s gift. Booph will be arriving soon from The Father, but first, I think we have an explanation to give.”
“… care if the Queen is in there, Lucius. I want to see my son!”
Draco opened the jar and dipped his fingers into it. “I think we should start you on it right away.” With that said, he gently started massaging it into Tobias’ skin.
It's time! and we see more mediwitch idiocy. Will it ever end?
Severus sat frozen on the chair. Did he just call them mild? “Draco, what did you mean by mild? These dreams had him freaked enough to not go back to sleep after them!”
“Why do you disagree with the contract Mr Weasley?” Gapplehank asked from his seat to the left of the goblin who was currently taking charge of the meeting.
“Yes, gios ek Skotadi.”
Tobias let out a purr of contentment when Draco ran his hands over the stiff muscles in his neck and shoulders. It had been a week since The Pack had visited the library and four days ago, the teachers decided that the majority of classes were too dangerous for him after the youngest Weasley male had tried – and almost succeeded – to hit him in the stomach with whatever spell they were learning at the time.
“Give him a pipe to smoke all night,
“So Ickle WonWon couldn’t handle Kyria’s ability,” Fred stated as he poked the blank-eyed shell of his former younger brother.
Ginny looked at the parchment before her in horror, as did Lucius, Luna and Algernon.
Hermione winced at the weight of sarcasm that fell from the Italian-born wizard’s lips when Albus Dumbledore was bought up, but found she could do little else.
Stolen away, stolen away.
A soft whine from the bed made the four adults freeze before another whine made Severus run to his two cubs without a word to his visitors.
“Question: What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? Answer – one is used to keep wolves away from the garden and the other is used by monks to stop them wanting female company.”
Severus nodded, eyes still on the pendant before he slipped it over his head, closing his eyes as the familiar and comforting magic washed over him.
The girl threw herself at the boy and hid her face in his stomach. “Am now bruver mine, knoweded you would ‘tect me.”
Severus watched the cauldron closely as he added the last ingredient and smiled as it turned a deep turquoise. He was positive that both of his godson’s would like this. He looked at his clock and swore fluently. He had five minutes to bottle this into thirty-eight vials or he would be late for a teachers meeting. He carefully bottled the mix, deciding that the meeting could wait since his godsons were more important than a meeting that sounded like a broken record.
Severus shocked both of the Professors beside him by smiling back with a small but real smile. “It’s good to be back, Minerva. This is where I belong – and no one is ever going to make me leave before I’m ready to go.”
Tobias and Draco grinned.
The Pack chuckled.
Tobias laughed at that one and nodded. “I will try do what you say Professor.  It may take a while, but I’ll do my best.”
The walked for another five minutes in near silence before Draco guided him to a seat. He could barely contain his excitement – damn hormones! He fidgeted slightly as he waited for the blindfold to be removed. When it was, he stared around him in wonder. The room they were in glowed a soft pearlescent gold in the light of a thousand and one candles. The picture frames that doted the room gleamed silver and Draco’s hair seemed to be made of liquid moonbeams.
The class was going smoothly until someone’s cauldron started to give out black smoke. Without thinking, Tobias ran at Draco and called out, “Kitten!” Tobias and Draco disappeared just as the potion exploded all over Lavender. Both boys reappeared at the front of the room, next to their Godfather, who was trying his hardest not to laugh at the girl.
Tobias looked at him. “Yes. You all are my family, and as such, we are going to be living as a family when we leave here – no matter where you are, so we will be having family meals – cooked by Pateras’ house elves, or course.” He turned and muttered, “School house elves be damned if they think I will be letting them cook for my family meals.”
“As for why we were contacted to deal with this,” Fred said with an evil grin on his lips that had many people in the Hall swear they could see the devil horns growing from within his hair, ‘Who better to send? And the reason for this?” He spun around to face the Dias, face completely serious in an instant.
“I should have known it was you,” Tobias growled as the ropes holding him vanished when George was blasted into the wall behind him. “You are, after all, the only person who fucks up my life.” He turned to face his opponent, nodding gratefully at George who limped his way back to his betrothed.
‘Back to business,’ Amelia snorted internally. ‘No rest for the wicked and all that. Still, it’s better than sitting at home twiddling my thumbs.’ She turned her attention back to the girl before her.
“And if you don’t mind,” Fred added as he looked down at the woman with disgust, “We will request Algernon to suggest a mind walker – we don’t like the thought of someone so incompetent getting into our heads.”
One of the girls made a questioning sound.
“It’s time.”
Pulling away, Draco grinned cockily as he took in the slightly plump, bruised lips and glazed eyes on Tobias’ face. “When you put it that way,” he purred, lying Tobias down, “I guess we’ll just have to make it a promise.” As soon as he felt his beloved’s head touch the moss, he began devouring his lips once more.
“First time at the Manor since the wedding,” Draco explained to the questioning raised eyebrow of his godfather.
“I was,” Tobias yawned, making his jaw crack, “but how am I supposed to sleep when people yell?” he added grumpily. He looked at Madam Greengrass with eyes still puffy from sleep. “You are supposed to know better as a Healer. At the moment I think I would have been better off with just my Pack.”
Absolute silence filled the room.
“Milord, Mother, Father?”
The tension that had formed in the younger man relaxed significantly as he registered the older woman’s words and he rubbed his eyes tiredly.
“Thank you Your Grace,” Amelia said with a nod of her head. “You have been delegated a Healer and Ministry official by us,” she continued, now addressing the forty odd students that had gathered. “These groups are not negotiable and I expect each and every one of you to treat both of the adults with respect, no matter who they are.”
Narcissa watched the scene on the bed with soft eyes as Algernon cast spell after spell at her exhausted son-in-law to clean him up. Draco had seated himself behind Tobias and was holding the younger male close to him while gazing down at the small being that was greedily guzzling the formula that had been quickly thrown together once the baby had been cleaned.
With that, Severus walked out of the room, leaving Remus standing where he was with tears of true regret welling in his eyes.
“Come Love,” he murmured. “Time to eat then sleep a bit.”
Tobias returned to eating the bowl of mixed fruit before him. “Arpakitiko, can you come here please?”
The older years, visiting dignitaries and Professors, on the other hand, couldn’t remove their gazes from the sight of the white wolf latching onto the girl’s throat and tearing it out, ignoring everything as her terrified screams were joined by those of the students around her at the sight of the white wolf’s canine grin in a face stained red with blood
“Gios. We need to talk about something.”
Draco nodded. “Get the paper to me Love; I’ll see what I can do.”
“What a wonderful way to be woken up … and that’s not to mention the view,” he purred, making Tobias whimper and wriggle slightly. Draco kept his eyes on those of his husband’s as he leant down and plundered the willing mouth below him.
Remus chuckled as Bill asked, “What did he say?”
“Thank you,” Neville chirruped, making her laugh as he walked towards a rather large group standing by the doors to the Great hall.
“What would you know?” Hermione managed to spit out viciously.
Breakfast was a very nerve-wracking experience for The Pack. They had felt the mark flair that morning, calling a meeting. Neville was extremely pale and couldn’t bring himself to eat anything. Severus also was pale – well, more so than he normally was. He knew that he was going to be punished for the previous night and he knew that it would hurt. The Dark Lord and Lucius had told him why Draco had no knowledge of the ritual Tobias had performed the previous afternoon, and he was deeply ashamed of himself and his behaviour.
“What happened to the daughter in law and what was the husband’s response?”
Lucius visibly shook himself from something only he could see and turned eyes that held less warmth than ice-chips onto each member who was watching him silently. “She had been hit by bludgeoning hexes and cutting curses until she was almost dead and our child was. Tests confirmed Narcissa and I were going to be the prod parents of a little girl – the first female Malfoy born to the main line in over five hundred and sixty years. She was three month in utero. A perfectly formed human being, only just big enough to sit in one of my hands. After we had named and buried our daughter, I attended several mind healer appointments with Narcissa, watched those responsible for MY DAUGHTER’S death get a slap on the wrist and joined the Dark Lord the following week.”
Fred and George were currently sitting on opposite sides of a small table staring each other in the eye, two parchments between them on the otherwise empty tabletop. Eventually George sighed in defeat and rubbed his eyes.
Everyone nodded and went to collect something to do. Pansy was soon back with her make-up kit and a thoroughly disgruntled Millicent. Tobias and Draco chuckled. It seemed that Pansy had finally convinced Millicent to have a makeover. Theo and Blaise soon returned with a chess set and a packet of exploding snap cards. Vince and Greg returned holding books, quills, ink and charcoal – Vince being a writer and Greg an artist.
Algernon made a horrified face. “Please say you are joking.”
“I’m sorry Ray,’ Harry whispered. “I had such lovely plans for us this week and instead we are stuck in here for the week.”
“Now all we need to do is introduce her to The Pack,” Tobias whispered.
Severus blushed crimson. “I was busy making notes on a potion I wanted to experiment with and I didn’t stop when making myself a cup of tea to help me stay awake. I put that potion into my cup instead of milk – and it was marked that it was potion, I just didn’t read it.” Narcissa’s laughter echoed through the house. Lucius grinned.
Minerva froze and glared at the man before her. “Firstly, that boy is not a slut. He never has been and he never will be, and I am disgusted that you could ever call a student by that derogatory term. Secondly, he is not a weapon and you will come to regret turning him into one. Thirdly, I cannot believe that you could even think of selling any child into what amounts as a life-long sex slave, and lastly the child growing inside Tobias is not a bastard. Tobias and Draco are legally married and the child conceived on the night after their wedding. I know this because I was the one who presided over their wedding. Now, IF you don’t mind, I would also like to have something to eat.”
“Yes, but that was many many decades ago, the man replied haughtily before joining in with the soft laughter coming from his two companions.
“You were a horrible pillow last night … I feel like salmon and strawberry yoghurt.”
Severus stalked to the Slytherin common room with a scowl on his face. He had one class – ONE CLASS! – out of seven that didn’t have at least one Gryffindor in it that day. He’d had no sleep, he was out of extra concentrated pepper-up, something that he normally added to his tea when he’d had to stay up most of the night and to make things even worse, his two favourite students were unable to join today’s class!
The Death Eaters watched and listened in shock as the youngsters reported to the Dark Lord as if they had rehearsed it in advance. No one could miss the pride that shone in the eyes of the adults surrounding the Dark Lord. Some of the people in the black mass watched in shame as a group of school children gave their reports with more finesse and professionalism then they themselves had shown. A small group of followers watched their Lord’s son in jealousy as he sat down in the most coveted position – the throne-like seat that was placed to their Lord’s left. The majority of the crowd, however, listened to the words coming from their Lord’s heir in shock.
Characters: Poppy Pomphrey, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter.
With that, he slid down the tunnel, whooping with delight.
When Achalendra and his daughters arrived at Gringotts early in the morning, only he was not surprised to see Tobias, Fred and George waiting for them. He was surprised when the youngest ale nodded in acknowledgment and turned into one of the closets tunnels with a barely noticeable nod to the goblin that was closest to them.
“You have been trouble from the very beginning. I should never have befriended you. We all should have known that you were evil, Potter.”
The lady next to him nodded in understanding.
“I was trying to protect him and your child Draco,” Severus hissed, eyes flashing dangerously.
“Draco?” Tobias asked softly and slightly teary-eyed from behind Narcissa, “Where were you? I felt sick and needed a cuddle and you weren’t there.”
“He was so defiant when I found him. He may have had everything taken from him, but he was defiant til the end. Never stopped insulting the pig of a man he was supposed to call ‘Uncle’ – Not even when the rat’s arsed piece of child molesting niffler shit tried to rape him again did he stop fighting.”
“Do you remember that letter we got a few days ago from Tobias? The one asking our permission to court Draco.” Narcissa nodded, confused. “Well, Young Tobias gave him his first courtship gift this morning after getting my letter of permission!”
“Good work, everyone. He is even still alive. Now, why did you throw this pretty toy at me, hmm?” The man glared at the youth, keeping his lips sealed shut. “Aw, come on. If you tell me under your own power it will be a lot less painful for you – but less enjoyable for me. If not, then I will get it out of you with this little guy.” Tobias pulled a grub from a box. “He doesn’t look like much, I know, but let me explain what he does. I place him on a sensitive part of your body – the inside of your ear or the head of your dick, depending on how much I want to hear you scream – and it will squeeze itself into any hole it finds. If it cannot find a hole – let us say that I make a plug for the hole that lets air into your brain – it will make itself a new one. It will then hollow out the area surrounding it, and you will feel every ... single ... bite. Doesn’t it sound delightful?”
“I’m sorry,” Severus muttered softly into Tobias’s neck as he buried himself in the nearly forgotten scent. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
The second man exchanged devastated looks with the third recipient – who was also his wife - and opened his arms for her sobbing form. Internally, he was cursing himself to purgatory and back for his behaviour, after all, the day before it happened he was remarking on Draco’s luck for having a partner who didn’t throw things in a hormone-driven rage. Taking a deep breathe, he moved his wife away and dried her tears, murmuring in her ear and taking her hand, guided her into his study to compile a joint apologetic letter proper for the occasion.
Once Draco had removed his hands from his partner’s intimate areas, he pulled himself away from the tempting flesh of the already abused throat that he loved. Moving away from his pleading husband, he released him from the willow and kissed and licked the slightly chaffed skin with intensity that surprised Tobias. Giving both wrists one last kiss, he moved until he was between Tobias’ legs. Lying on top of him, he looked into his eyes lovingly and kissed the tip of his nose.
“Try not to startle either of us again. My guardians now care for us both.”
“You could do much better than him, Miss Ravel. I suggest staying away from him. As a teacher, I don’t want to have to floo your parents with the news that their daughter is pregnant before her 14
“Can you make me an appointment to see Voldemort, please? I want to talk to him about something that has come to my attention. It concerns you too, Sir.” Severus nodded once and walked out the door, hearing one last word before the boy fell asleep.
Severus and Remus were the last two to slide into the Chamber. Neither of them could help but notice the heated looks Draco was shooting at the dark-haired youth. They exchanged looks and Remus nodded. He would talk to their lord about the glances between the two.
Tobias looked at his father. “Please forgive me father, I need to go burn something.” At his father’s nod, Tobias bowed to all in the room individually then was engulfed in a hot red flame, vanishing.
“Calm down Love,” Draco panted as he opened the door, followed closely by a sickly-looking Severus that had Tom, Lucius, Narcissa and Remus to pale and flinch back jerkily.
When Tobias was ten steps away from him, Draco silently extended his hand. Tobias slowly extended his hand until it rested in Draco’s. Still starting deeply into the other’s eyes, Draco drew Tobias closer to him until he held both of Tobias’ hands in his own. Keeping his eyes locked on Tobias’, Draco slowly raised both his hands and kissed the backs of his intended’s, noticing the slight blush on his cheeks.
Amelia chuckled as she accepted the list. “I had forgotten about that,” she admitted, “thanks for reminding me.”
“Did you spring a leak?” Tobias asked, allowing his irritation to surface, “Here, allow me to finish the job. BOMBARDA!”
Severus gave a half-smirk. “How long has he been asleep? How long have I been here? How long does it take to fly to Australia from Scotland?”
“If we don’t remove them today, he will die. I can sense there are spells at work, but I can’t figure them out.  He bought it to my attention when he woke.  He asked…” Here he took a shuddering breath.
“Why? All he did was give milord some herbs that made him act … rather peculiarly” Lucius said.
Tobias chuckled, not in the least bit intimidated by the fierce woman. He made his way to the entrance. “I do believe you came to see the Chamber and the basilisk skeleton just waiting for harvesting?” The three adults looked at him, surprised to hear his amusement. “And don’t worry, Nona. I would only use his weaknesses against him in the bedroom to get him well and truly riled up.” He grinned sardonically. “I so love a dominant top.” Winking at the shell-shocked adults, he left the Snake Pit. The three adults looked at each other, silenced efficiently.
Even though the kiss was innocent, there was not one person in the Hall who didn’t understand its meaning. MINE. Slowly noise started to refill the Hall. Tobias kept a blank mask on for the rest of the meal, only indicating that he’ll speak to everyone later in the Snake Pit. They nodded their understanding and finished their meal in silence.
The aftermath ... and the twins reveal several secrets of their own
“Personally, I like the sight of blood.” He paused to remove his potions knife from a pocket and inspected it. Slowly he dragged the blade across the flesh on his forearm. The seventh year student was now up against the wall, whimpering now that he’d realised his mistake, and watching the blade almost hypnotically. Draco had to admit that the way Tobias handled the knife was half erotic and half hypnotic – a dangerous combination.
“Now!” the voice commanded.
“Firstly, you have her for five years only,” Lucius stated. “This time frame was decided upon in a meeting between me, my son-in-law and the head stallion of the resident Centaur herd. If, in that period of time, she is mounted and is proven fertile, you may keep any and all young that are not centaur. If, by some miracle, a centaur is produced, you are to send word to me, my son or my son-in-law and we will come for it ASAP to deliver it to the herd.”
“I bet it was Lucius who wanted it!”
Severus and Lucius gaped at the woman, their cheeks flaming. Tobias laughed outright at their united gasp of, “Narcissa!”
“Good Hunting,” the rest of The Pack chorused.
The rest of the Pack shook their heads and chuckled when their Alpha and Beta disappeared after Lucius interrupted the two of them. They didn’t try to stop them anymore because – quite frankly, their Alpha was vicious when interrupted … Not to mention they were used to the behaviour shown by the pregnant teen.
Tobias’ laughter drew the men’s attention back to him. “L-ly-lykos,” he gasped through his laughter. “That is so … so funny!” He continued laughing, getting it out of his system.
Remus finally pulls his head in.
“I’d start on those curses now, Miss Granger, and I’ll like for them to be handed in to me, in assignment form before you look at this book.” She tapped the book several times. “In fact, I’m going to hold this one until you finish this task satisfactorily. You also have full run of the Restricted Section – Do not abuse it.”
“Pure-blooded wizards don’t understand muggles. They see them as idiots – the peasants, slaves, servants and jesters of the realm while they are the nobility. Muggles are much more dangerous than they believe. Many muggles don’t care about their families. In the wizarding world, children are treated as gifts to be treasured. No matter what crime a witch or wizard commits, they do not harm a magical child. Not even the Lestrange trio – who are without a doubt clinically insane – harmed a child. They went for Frank and Alice, but left their son alone. In the muggle world there are people who prey exclusively on children.”
Minerva frowned. “I can’t remember making a detention, let alone multiple.”
Tobias snuggled into Draco’s chest with a yawn, “That’s good. We need at least eight pups. More might be a bit too much, but if they come, they’ll be more than welcome.”
Zog looked at his friend laying on the ground and laughed. “What happened? He miss a step?”
Luna nodded. She didn’t have much energy left, and she doubted that Ginny had much more.
“Who was the student he picked for the questions?”
Two chapter! Yay!
“Come on, time to continue the meeting if the children are to be back by a decent time.” Everyone nodded and returned to their seats, ready for the next part of the meeting.
“I’m sorry I asked,” Lucius moaned as he sank into his seat and placed his head between his knees. Tom, Severus and Narcissa laughed.
“Are you alright Amelia?” Minerva asked, taking in the exhaustion written all over the younger woman’s face.
Tom watched as Remus paced, deep in thought. Since they had discovered the bond between Tobias and the two Daemons, Remus had spent every spare moment in the Riddle Manor Library researching all he could about the different Daemon and their cultures, as well as everything he could find on the gods they served. He had found little on the Daemon and even less of the Mother and her consort.
Ron woke once more, this time due to a soft buzzing sensation in his head. He blinked drowsily and enjoyed the feeling of being gently rocked. He focused the area he could see, his mind calm now that the spiders were no longer on him.
“Oh we know that,” Luna said. “It’s that … Beta is extremely possessive when it comes to Alpha and he is the only one who has any luck with keeping Alpha calm. If Beta is angry, then it feeds Alpha’s anger.”
“Tobias is asleep,” he stated as he moved aside. “Ensure he wakes an hour before supper so we can pack everything up.”
Severus’ shock showed on his face. He had not known how much the potion Tobias had made had affected his Lord. He also had not known that his Lord had come to see Tobias as his own son. He smirked internally. He’d love to be a fly on the wall if Tom was ever to meet Dumbledore after the Headmaster had harmed his son in some way. It would prove to be extremely entertaining.
“You wanted to see me, Professor?”
Pansy grinned as she and the rest of the Pack were transferred back to Hogwarts via Phoenix. Neville chuckled and shook his head in amusement as he slowly made his way to his room in the Manor.
Everyone in the room snapped upright and wide awake when a door was slammed open by a teary-eyed blond female.
The group of four chuckled softly before hearing the start of the trial and going quiet.
“Mr Black. A word, if I may?” Everyone turned to look at the hat – which had been forgotten in what had been occurring.
“As many as he wishes to be there – as long as you leave should an emergency come up.”
Once both Draco and Tobias were seated, Severus appeared with Tobias’ potion. Once more the members of The Pack continued to do their own thing. When none of them bated an eyelid at the enthusiastic way the potion was drunk, many of those around them realised just how common this occurrence was. Severus wasn’t the only person there to watch him drink it with sorrow in his eyes.
Tobias sank into his seat in the Snake-pit with a sigh of relief. He was glad to be back and the almost mothering feel of Kitten’s magic washed over him like a tsunami.
‘But nothing – NOTHING- is more terrifying than hearing a muggle nursery rhyme sun in a dreamy, innocent voice while knowing that the woman it belongs to has a mid that is made for torture,’ Neville thought as he joined into the song.
Tobias sank into a leather chair with a sigh of gratitude. He hurt all over. He knew he shouldn’t have worked for so long at the pace he had set, but he’d gotten a great deal done – the only skeleton visible now was the basilisk one that he was going to start rendering for potions ingredients the next day, the pipe that led to the Chamber had been scrubbed till it shone and the rock fall had been removed with the rocks being levitated and welded into their original positions.
Tom and Lucius stared at Severus in shock. It was obvious to all of them that this was news to them.
He sighed deeply. Now that he was not the pain-in-the-rump’s guardian any longer, he needed to find a new way to control him. Maybe it was time to work on Slytherin House – Draco Malfoy in particular. If that didn’t work, then he’d have to go straight to the top and Lucius Malfoy. If he was lucky, he’d be the only person to obtain the youth’s fortune, including Hogwarts and he’d bring about the downfall of the most rich, powerful and influential family in the wizarding world while at it.
She looked back at George and smiled when she noticed he was looking at her.
Draco smirked. “Good luck while you’re there. Just think: you’ll be having sooooo much fun you’ll forget all about us.”
“Semolina I believe,” Draco said with a fond resigned chuckle, “With apple and cinnamon. From the disapproving look he had, I think he has concluded that the taste combinations you have been having lately are a crime against kitchen elves so has decided that simple foods with delicate tastes are on the menu these net few days.”
Draco gathered himself, took a deep breath and followed his father, hoping with all his heart that he wasn’t going to get burnt if he chose to play with fire.
Over at the Gryffindor Table, Hermione felt her ownership mark heat up along with the desire to read the Daily Profit. As she read the story concerning the Headmaster, memories started playing through her mind of everything she had done due to the Headmaster and what it had cost her. Ashamed of it, she tried to bury them without success as a strange presence in her mind kept bringing them back up, urging her to copy them and send them into the reporter’s office. She shook her head and slammed both the feeling and the presence deep into her mind. As she ran, she failed to notice the smug look of a predator stalking prey flicker across the face of a dark-eyed, dark skinned member of The Pack.
Draco was interrupted by a noise from the main sitting room. He and Tobias ran to it and opened the door slowly.
“You lot are going to be the death of me, aren’t you?”
“And the claws?” Remus prompted. He was finding this incredibly interesting.
“There is, Beta,” Neville answered softly. “I got an owl from The Lord. All it said was ‘breakfast’ with the time ‘7:15’.”
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it? It was buried under a few thousand years’ worth of bone dust, rock and dirt. It took me four days to clean the floor enough for it to come out. Well, let’s go do this.” Tobias strode down towards the Chamber, followed closely by his pack.
“He then ‘reminded’ me of the detentions I had given to the three boys, stating he would ‘find someone else to cover them’ while I ‘recovered’ form a slight dizzy spell. He also said some very … disturbing things about Tobias and the child he is carrying. I needed to know if I had been obliviated before by him due to learning something he didn’t like.”
Hidden in the shadows, an old man stood, watching with twinkling eyes, believing he had just put a barrier between the growing relationship between the werewolf and his cub
“What are the plans for today?” Neville asked The Pack as the student body gradually returned to normal.
“Product,” the two of them tag teamed, making Tom sneer at them.
Tobias looked down into the silver-green eyes that glowed with desire. “Draco?”
“I agree to that,” Cornelius blustered. “We don’t want another Black episode – what with him being in Azkaban for over a decade while he was actually innocent.” He was obviously remembering the events of the summer when he’d had to tell the wizarding world that an innocent victim had been in the feared wizarding prison. “We will have the hearing tomorrow morning. He will need to spend today and tonight in the cells, but he will be treated correctly. Will you be there?”
“What do you want? You’re not allowed in here, it’s off limits!”
The next day no one saw hide or hair of Tobias. Draco awoke to find a letter and a small chocolate love heart on the pillow next to his head – as well as a new bathrobe with a Dragon in Slytherin colours stitched onto the back of it.
Draco watched Tobias with a slight smile on his lips. It was almost time for the younger members of The Pack to arrive. He knew that Bill, Charlie and George wouldn’t be coming to this meeting as they were all required at their respective work-places, but the rest of them would be appearing in five minutes and Tobias was almost quivering with anticipation. Tonight’s meeting was being held at Malfoy Manor and when Tobias had laid eyes on the majestic building, he had become very hyperactive – much to the amusement of the people already inside.
Tobias gently extracted himself from his father’s arms and picked up the books he’d dropped. Looking at them, the three men’s jaws dropped. All the books in his hands had one thing in common – They were written in parseltongue.
Amelia raised an eyebrow, wondering why she had been asked to remain when the teen had everything under control.
“You like this, don’t you Slut?” he whispered as he pulled Draco’s head back by his hair, restricting how far he could swing. “You love the feeling of having something being continually shoved into your already full arse, don’t you?” He jammed his dick as far into Draco’s arse as he could before vanishing the ropes that held him in the air.
“Headache cure,” Lucius said with an understanding smile. “Medium strength. I know I’ve had one already today and Wu has had three. Of all of us here, you are the only one who hasn’t had at least one of these since we started. We were starting to believe you weren’t human for a while there.”
“Scotch,” Minerva answered in her usual no nonsense tone. “A muggle drink that is around forty percent alcohol.” The six purebloods watched in undisguised interest as Minerva swallowed her half-glass in one go without reacting to the fumes that they were sure could strip the polish – as well as most of the wood – from their wands.
Smirking at his father shocked face, he led his pack into the seating room. Severus followed them, his eyes lighting up when he spotted his mate. Tobias chuckled and pushed him in the direction of the werewolf. He laughed when Remus dragged Severus out of the room enthusiastically. He and Draco locked eyes, both knowing what was going to happen. Tobias noticed something deep in Draco’s eyes and stepped forwards and let his arms wrap around his beloved. “I know you don’t understand why I’ve been avoiding most contact with you lately, Drakontas. After tonight you will know. You deserve nothing but the best.” He ran his fingers over the sharp lines of Draco’s face. “I want to give you the best.”
So here he was, stuck to a seat in Severus’ Office with sixteen unopened boxes surrounding him and the contents of the only opened one scattered over Severus’ desk.
“What in the world are you doing Granger?” Theo asked a look of pure disdain on his face.
Ginny rose and after dusting herself of snow, she started to run for the school entrance. “Catch me if you can Luna!” she called over her shoulder.
Tobias laughed joyfully as he ran from a mock-enraged Draco. He hadn’t thought that having his husband chase him naked would be something that would make him want his husband’s touch more then he already wanted it – but it did.
The start of the investigation and The Pack discovers that it is not a good idea to allow Luna to choose colours
“You’re spawned of Satan – only he is supposed to have control over fire like that!”
Draco smiled. “For listening to me last night and for trusting me enough to fall asleep on me. I really enjoyed last night, Bi. Thank you.”
“I would rather give you the memory to view after all the students have been tested. I could not live with myself if something had been occurring to them without knowing about it.”
Albus Dumbledore stared moodily into the flames. Not only did someone remove the bands on his weapon, but also said weapon was no longer under his thumb. Add to this that his spies report that Tom is no longer insane, and just like a normal human, and he has an heir. An heir that no one has seen, knows the name of or even what he looks like! Trying to find information on this new variant was like looking for a needle in a haystack blindfolded and with numb hands! Not even Severus, his most loyal spy, had found information on the child.
Remus nodded, bowed and left with the goblet, which had been licked clean. Voldemort watched his son stretch again and noticed the wild, animalistic grace and strength he seemed to exude.
Severus felt his jaw drop when he stumbled over a carton filled with vials of basilisk venom and cleaned fangs in his private rooms. A note floated over them, stating the crushed bone will be getting divided between him and Professor Sprout.
Draco nodded thoughtfully.
His attempts at getting the annoyance to the infirmary to destroy the life growing inside him before anyone knew about it had failed, as had the plans of getting the Weasley boy to make the boy abort by burning the herbs he had given him.
“Prove it,” Hermione stated, calling the blonde on what she believed was a bluff.
“Tobias is scarier,” he happily informed his elder. “I never said that Tobias would never find out,” he continued seriously, “I will tell him what we do and why either tonight or tomorrow.”
It was during the second day that an idea hit her. All day this idea plagued her until she stopped and thought about it. If it worked, then Tobias would be able to do more than watch Ron and Hermione slobber all over each other. If it didn’t, she would be in a world of trouble. Would she do it, or wouldn’t she? Her answer was given to her the next morning.
Draco nodded and tried to wake his husband ... he didn’t like his chances.
Severus chuckled. “Or I could just tell him that he needs to have his paperwork sorted out and that you’ve offered to help him with both that and any general repairs that need to be done – under the guise of punishment, of course. We can’t be letting on that both you and he are on the same side of the war.”
Several hours later a dusty, disgruntled trio trudged back to the Slytherin common room.
“Delores Umbridge.”
“Lucius!” he barked. To everyone’s surprise, Lucius paled before he bowed.
Tom looked at his son and son-in-law. “What did they mean by that?”
“Dobby, remove the glamour around the one holding my daughter,” he whispered softly. It wasn’t a potion being used, nor was the person a metamorphmagus. He knew this because there was only one metamorphmagus in the UK and she had been warned away from him when it came to light that it was her who had allowed the headmaster to escape and a person’s true eye colour would not reveal itself through a potion.
Silence ruled the room until Lucius chuckled softly. “When did he do it?”
Before the Gryffindors inside it managed to collect themselves, Vincent and Gregory blocked the open doorway. Draco, meanwhile, had followed Tobias to an empty compartment.
Tobias nodded as he absent-mindedly munched on a carrot stick he had stolen from Draco’s plate. “Where is that gods-be-damned elf!” he growled. “Sorry Epikindynos, what was that?”
“It’s good to see you awake youngster. We were beginning to think you were never going to get up.”
“Did we hear correctly?” an exited voice beamed from the front of the room. “Did the baby move?”
The Pack laughed and spent the remaining time to the evening meal relaxing and talking about children’s names.
Tobias bounced over to the teacher’s table after breakfast with Draco not far behind him.
“Honest, Bi. Why would I lie to you? It goes back to the dark ages where if a witch was caught the men in the town or village she was found in were allowed to rape her before burning her at the stake. This became a magical law so ingrained that over the years the magic in us and our world made it so hard for a witch or wizard to be de-flowered that only another with magic could take their virginity, and only then with the said witch or wizard’s permission. If they didn’t have permission, the one who forced them got sick, was crippled or died. Where do you think the muggle superstition of sleeping with a virgin was bad and so had someone else do it for them came from?”
Minerva sighed softly and put a hand on Tobias’ shoulder. “Then what you do is contact the goblins asking the best times for you to go see them and talk to Amelia and Achalendra about talking with them tonight and ask to get both sets of twins an yourself seen to first thing in the morning so this can be sorted out.”
Tobias nodded thoughtfully. “I might just do that, Nonos. I think I’ll go to bed now. Goodnight Pateras. Night Nonos. Night Anadochos.”
“You used a lot of energy yesterday,” Minerva said softly. “Normally a good night’s rest would be all you need to recover, but you also have a portion of your magic going to supporting your baby, so you don’t have as much magic in your core as you normally do.”
He clenched his eyes shut as tight as they would go in an attempt to ignore – or hide; he wasn’t sure which – the tune. He jumped and screamed when something touched him.
Severus stepped through the fireplace with a relieved sigh. He was not looking forward to taking to Lucius or his Lord. He found them sitting in the sitting room with tea, coffee and ham and cheese sandwiches.
“Good slut,” Harry moaned as he thrust harder and slapped one firm arse cheek hard enough for a red hand print to be left. “You better be ready, cause this is all the preparation you are getting” He pulled both his dick and fingers from his Pet’s body and hit a button that made the desk turn a full hundred and eighty degrees before thrusting fully into Draco’s arse. Both men screamed in pleasured pain and Harry shook hard as an orgasm was ripped from him as soon as he bottomed out. Both of them gasped from breath and Harry was now very thankful for the hot, tight sheath around him that stopped him from softening at all.
“That two,” Tobias shrugged, purring softly. “Now shoo, I’m sleepy.” Once again, he fell asleep with close to no warning.
Lucius held up a hand for silence, and surprisingly he got it within a few moments. “As I was saying: We, unlike the Order of the Phoenix, are not a complaints society. We are an action and information reconnaissance group, which is my and Draco’s responsibility. So will you now remove your wand from my son’s throat, before one of us seriously hurts you?”
No one, not even the Daemon, had anything to say to that.
Tobias chuckled. “I was making my sanctuary more liveable. Yes, I have seen the Chamber – in fact that was where I have been all day – scrubbing floors, walls, ceilings and pipes. ‘Cissa, Lucius and Sev are not as young as they used to be and are immensely happy they aren’t the ones who need to try keep up with me. I only sleep for between one and three hours a night, unless I’m either really comfortable or extremely tired and I mark that which is mine – whether if it is beloved, befriended or prey.” He grinned wolfishly.
Monday morning came too early for the students of Hogwarts – even the Slytherins grumbled a bit. Blaise was the first to notice the two empty beds. Fifteen minutes later, a wide-awake and cheerful couple walked into chaos.
Harry nodded as he opened his O.W.L results. Looking at the parchment, his jaw dropped. Slamming the parchment onto the table beside him, Harry turned to Severus.
“Yes Anadochos?”
Lucius gives blondes a bad name and Dumbles is a bad bad bad twinkle pot
“But if you can silently guess, well done!” Fred beamed as he clasped his hands together. “It isn’t like we keep it a secret.”
Both Tobias and the contract glowed silver, fulfilling the last requirement of the adoption process.
Tobias looked around the room, his eyes lighting up when he spotted the back of the lounge chair. Those in the room watched silently as he stretched and made himself comfortable along the back of the chair in his sights and then fall asleep. All in the room felt a stab of affection for the dark-haired youth – a strange occurrence in men who had sworn to kill the youth so many years before.
Padma half-turned before stating, “at this point in time, I pity any person who ends up with you. Not even Ronald Weasley deserves THAT fate.”
Draco lost control and laughed till he fell back onto the cot. “I – I can’t be – believe you just did that. Y – you sh –should have seen the looks on everyone’s faces when y – you mentioned my cock buried in your arse! I’m so going to have to put that memory into a pensieve and play it in the Great Hall after showing our family!”
Amelia crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow at the gaping man.
“This coming from the man who came from family renowned for their large families in the past,” Cornelius chuckled.
Tobias wordlessly handed him another book. As he looked through it, Tom’s jaw dropped and his eyes widened. Looking up at his two closest friends. “He was a squib …”
When I feel like giving up
A rumbling growl and large pale blur interrupted the boy, who yelped in fear as he noticed the furious were-wolf on top on him, pinning him to the floor. To the redhead’s embarrassment, and his sister’s absolute delight – Ron lost control of his bladder, urine forming a puddle underneath him.
“What do you two know of it?”
“We’ll be fine, son,” Lucius sighed in relief as he sank into his own seat, Narcissa beside him. “We are just tired and -” he wrinkled his nose slightly, “dusty.” He sneezed, causing Pansy to giggle; otherwise the common room was silent at the sight before them – The three most influential people in the wizarding world grey with dust and physically, mentally and magically depleted before breakfast had even been served. The pop of apparition startled everyone into jumping – but none jumped higher than Severus when he saw Tobias.
Lucius grinned grimly. “He is a dark wizard who healed and adopted the boy-who-lived and keeps track of where both sides of the war are at using spies whom he is willing to be questioned about under Veritaserum. He is wanted by the dark because he helped ‘the boy-who-lived’ and by the light because he ‘corrupted their Saviour’.”
Severus looked down at his arm and gently ran his fingertips over the spot the original mark had sat, a soft smile on his face.
“Other than the fact that none of those in the seventh year had much to do with the teen we were bought here due to, nothing,” Amelia snarled, making the Asian man blush slightly. “What exactly is your problem Wu? You harassed Lord Malfoy for apparently keeping information from you – even though said information was, is and never will be your concern and now you are treating information from ME as suspicious.”
Draco was speechless as the snake wrapped around his lower leg. Silently he unwound the reptile and gently rubbed its eye-ridge. Looking up, he beamed at Tobias and put his snake into the snake tank set up for Nagini when she was a hatchling.
Luna hummed softly as she flittered from shadow to shadow on her way to the Ravenclaw dormitory. She still had no friends in Ravenclaw, but it didn’t bother her at all now. She had The Pack and that’s all that mattered. She had tonight all planned out. First, she would write a letter to her potential mate with a git of some importance to her – she had chosen one of the first things she had made as a young girl. They were cuff-links in the shape of the crescent moon with a tear angling precariously from the bottom point. Both tear and moon had a dull redness to them, giving them the look of being blood-stained.
Luna put the sweet back into her mouth and smiled sweetly around it. “My po’kit.”
Draco and Tobias chatted quietly for a while before Draco stood to get a book from his bag. Tobias followed him to the dorm, a small smile on his lips. Ten minutes after Draco had returned Tobias appeared holding a simple guitar. All movement stopped in the room as he tested the strings for pitch. Ignoring everyone he played through a song he had stuck in his head. To his surprise, when he played the song again, a clear baritone voice joined in, singing the words to Bryan White’s ‘Someone else’s star’. Halfway through the song Draco cuddled up to Tobias, unshed tears in his eyes. Pure silence was heard after the last note had vanished. A spell had been woven into the Slytherins by that song – A spell so strong that the silence was kept until it was time from dinner, and they were almost at the Great Hall before someone said something.
“Surprise!”
Luna gave a slowly spreading smile. “I wouldn’t mind a spare pair of hands,” she suggested. “You up for it Skoteinos?”
“It’s a music box,” Luna chimed in with a soft smile. “Mummy used to have several of them for me when I was younger. They were the only thing that put me to sleep when I was fussy.”
“The last sweet is the smallest of them, but the most potent. Remember that it isn’t the size that counts ...” he had to stop as laughter rippled through the group and he looked back at Neville, who was glowing bright red – and giving off enough heat to set a grass fire. Tobias had to grin as Neville’s blush receded.
“That’s not true,” Tobias scowled, “it’s your body I want, or does the fact I am currently carrying a bellyful of your spawn not register?” Tobias turned around and walked out of the room, throwing a triumphant – yet playful – smirk over his shoulder at the speechless blonde in the otherwise empty room.
The twins shook their heads with a grin. “No, Algernon managed to dilute everything in our blood enough that it will be flushed out of our bodies. He’s promised to give us the recipe for the potion he used so we can take it between testings.”
“What would Pateras do if an underling planned rebellion before him?”
The older years chuckled, showing their liking for this plan.
Over the following week no one saw much of neither Draco nor Tobias. Other than when The Pack trained and at meals, they weren’t seen by anyone.
Tobias turned dark green eyes towards Greg and his father. “You may release him, Skia.”
Draco sat down next to him, handing him a large Firewhisky. “Why do you think we started sharing a bed at Hogwarts, even though we hadn’t bonded? He has horrific nightmares, but sleeping next to someone seems to help him with it, but not all the time. What dream was it?”
“Per month?” Amelia asked blinking. While it wasn’t the same as what a trainee Auror earned per month in their first year, it was pretty close and nothing to sneeze at.
“Both,” George replied. “The person who hit us with the loyalty spell only bit one of us and considering t was the one that was broken completely, the other’s magic would have reacted viciously towards it, hence it breaking.”
“I bet you that he was a Weasley in a previous life and a Dumbledore before that,” Tobias snorted. “Do you still want a job?”
“Severus? Lucius? What the hell are you talking about?”
Bill rubbed a hand over his face as he read the parchment that had appeared on his desk.
With a final nod, Lord Patil exited the room and Tobias turned to the two new comers. “Where do you want me?”
The Indian man looked up and around at the group around them. His eyes settled on his sulking oldest daughter and he sighed.
The kiss started out sweet, but quickly turned into something else. By the time Draco stopped plundering his husband’s very willing mouth for the second time that morning, the three girls of The Pack were flushed and fanning themselves and Severus and Remus were no longer in the room. A growl and the thud of a body being slammed into a wall gave an indication of where they were.
“I don’t want to spoil this, but I think we should talk about Sev and Remus’ punishment. Don’t you think three weeks is a bit long to keep them separated?”
Tobias was having trouble breathing with the intensity Draco was marking his body with. The last thought he had before he felt Draco’s hands move down his arms to join his lips, tongue and teeth in the worship of his chest was to wonder if he would have a spot of unclaimed skin when they left the Mother’s Garden. He suspected not.
“It wasn’t anything bad Sev,” Neville said through his chuckles as he led his Grandmother and Great Uncle into the room. “Some idiot decided to prevent Draco from going to Tobias when he was in one of his more … oh … sinful moods.”
Draco and Lucius exchanged glances. Neither of them had ever heard him speak in that tone of voice before. It terrified the light out of them, but also fed the darkness in them at the same time.
~Thisisaline~
Draco sighed with relief. “That’s good. Sorry for over-reacting.”
Minerva sat at her desk, a frown on her face. The Headmaster had called for a meeting of all staff, and it worried her. Nodding once firmly, she came to a decision that she had been thinking about since her discussion with Miss Granger. Writing a quick note, Minerva called a house-elf with the order to deliver a copy to all teachers bar the Headmaster. She was going to do what she should have done all those years ago.
Tobias grinned, eyes sparking once more, before finishing his drink and standing. “I’m going to bed now. I’ll see you all in the morning for the spells to make me look like that Potter fellow again.” He hugged and kissed his father and hugged his godparents. He walked to the door before stopping and turning. “Drakontas?” Draco looked up with an internal smile at the warmth evident in Tobias’ voice. Tobias smiled an honest smile. “Thank you.” He disappeared into the hall.
“Blaise …”
Tom gave a half-smile to him. “Eventually I hope to have Remus, Lucius, Narcissa and The Pack; all have the same pendant. All of you have become the family I desperately wanted in my youth and it pains me to think I branded you like a muggle brands cattle. My Death Eaters will remain marked, but my family … I can’t leave my family in forced submission, not even to myself.”
“If you hadn’t have been up to funny business last night, you would have had a decent night’s sleep then, so don’t pull that one on me.”
“Remove it without letting the person under it noticing and get my daughter away from them. If possible, get her to one of the Patils because I suspect that George will react before I can escape the ropes.”
Luna rapped the under-side of the table with her fingers when Ron, Dean and Seamus entered the room. Neville smirked at her and turned the handle a bit slower than Theo had done. Almost instantly, Luna, Neville, Ginny, Greg, Vincent and Tobias started to softly sing along with it, slowly getting a little louder with each verse, ignoring the slowly spreading silence of the hall.
My fair lady.”
The sound of multiple feet running into the room woke Draco from a lovely dream. He was buried deeply inside his husband’s more than willing body. Tobias moved slightly, bringing Draco’s attention to the fact that he was buried in his partner’s body and he moved slightly, causing Tobias to moan softly in his sleep. He was about to move again when soft laughter reached his ears.
Cornelius sighed in frustration as the noise level rose. “Why did we arrive so early again?” he asked rhetorically, making the two people on either side of him chuckle.
He winced at the devastated look on Severus’ face.
George watched anxiously as Fred submitted to a barrage of tests that would have made the both of them cringe had they not become used to casting the very same spells on each other to monitor themselves when testing their new products. The frown that appeared on the Healer’s face made his heart skip a beat.
Minerva and Tobias exchanged smirks.
Chapter 34
Amelia nodded her understanding and hid a smile. “Lucius then,” she agreed when she got herself under control, “how can I help?”
“How are things going at the school?”
Algernon chuckled. “Chilled cucumber soup. I added a few extra ingredients to Tobias’ one for extra nutrients, but yours is just plain.”
Oh yeah
In the room where Draco and Harry lay sleeping, a soft voice could be heard whispering worlds of love and devotion. Harry and Draco slept peacefully with smiles on their lips, dreaming about their future adventures when the lights go out.
Fred, with the assurance of having done this over a million times before, pointed his wand at George and performed the spell so fast and smooth that it was almost missed by the others in the room.
“Well?” Tobias said, raising an eyebrow.
Tobias’s eyes snapped to those of his husband and he smiled. “Draco …”
“I’ve got some information to write down for the next meeting,” Ginny said as she stretched, “then Luna and I will be spending the night having a sleep-over in the Room of Requirement. Everyone in Gryffindor refuses to talk to me and some of the girls are getting very bitchy with me – mostly muggleborn and those too young to understand what happened and why.”
He leant over and gave Draco a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “I’m going up to our room. If Dobby doesn’t foresee it, for once, can you direct him there?”
“I can’t wait to go back,” Tobias murmured, rubbing his eyes. “All I want to do is sleep.”
“Moon flower garden?”
Hope that you all enjoy this chapter as much as you seem to be enjoying the other chapters I have posted. On a happy note, I am now up to writing the 47th chapter for this story and I am hoping that the chapters will start to gain in length since some of the later chapters are rather short. As usual, I own nothing that is known, unless you have already read the story, then some of the parts that you know are mine :p (raise hands if I confused you with that *raises both hands XD*) and tell me please if I have any mis-translations :3
When they had settled, she covered them with a soft, warm blanket and left, pausing at the door to look at the rivals-turned-lovers. She would keep this new development to herself, but when the boys decided to drop their act, she would support them fully – even if it meant dealing with the Devil himself.
Tobias grinned, blushing. “I’m sure you could make it, Sev. You’d just need to be in an area where you cannot be interrupted for eighteen hours.” He smiled at Draco. “I’m sorry I worried you on Sunday, Drakontas – but I needed time to make your present.”
With a final glare at the man who she had looked up to for most of her life, she spun and stormed towards the Hall. When she heard something muttered, she turned in time to hear her ex-mentor throw an obliviate at her, which caught her in her chest. As the spell started to work, she felt her mind being pulled back and covered in a crimson dome of magic that vanished as soon as the spell’s effects vanished.
“It’s only 7:45 Ginny,” Bill soothed. “We all got here at 6:45.”
“Allow us to reveal what we are talking about,” George stated, drawing another piece of parchment from a pocket. “Messer’s Weasley,” he began, face entirely devoid of his trickster nature, scaring everyone who thought they knew the twins. “I received this letter in the morning post from one of my people in the shadows. I bought this to the Minister’s attention and he agreed to my insisting that this creature be taken care of. I want her away from my son and grandchild, even if she is untouchable until after her current job, as long as she is alive by the time the job finishes, you have Carte Blanc permission to do whatever you wish to her.”
Luna began to prowl once more, heading towards a small table hidden in the shadows. She took a few sips of minted water and returned to the task she had set herself. “Last, and perhaps the most important aspect of this wonderful device,” she swiftly forced the blade of the third blade though one of the red-head’s shinbones with no sign of flinching, “is the blade.
“Hold on a moment. Why is he an EX-employee of St Mungos?” Draco asked, eyes narrowed as he moved so he was between his husband and the man.
The next morning everyone watched in bemusement as Tobias and Draco completed their morning ritual of courtship. Voldemort had a proud smirk on his face as he watched the exchange. The Pack, with the exception of the four elder Weasley’s just ignored them, as if this was a regular occurrence.
Pavarti was saved from repeating herself when the door to the office opened to reveal a goblin with white hair tuffs coming from his ears.
“He hasn’t.” The quiet voice of Draco in thought answered. “Didn’t you notice the way he reacted whenever he was in a crowd? Unless he was facing you, milord, or with the games keeper, or the weasel and mudblood, he almost panicked when there were more than five people. Even in the odd happy memory when someone hugged him, he froze for a bit.”
“”Such a good little kitten,” Harry smiled as he dug into his meal.
Tobias tilted his head slightly to one side, puzzled. “For what?”
“Nice shirt, Bi,” Lucius teased, watching the slight blush coat Tobias’ cheeks. Tobias mumbled something, making Severus chuckle.
“Yes, it’ll be fun! Not only will I get his detention records, but also all the maintenance records for Hogwarts, all the monetary expenditure, staff records, applications – basically everything about the school from day one to now – and as Founder’s Heir, I can challenge every single change that has been made if I can give examples of wrong doings and I have Kit’s help with that.”
“Now where is that damn house-elf!” Tobias growled.
Chuckling softly, Voldemort rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Will those chosen as godparents step forward?”
Tobias giggled softly and turned the chair around so he could hug his husband tightly. “I love you,” he whispered.
Chapter 40
Amelia smiled ruefully, “then I have no problem what so ever at meeting with you and your sons.”
Everyone paled.
When I feel like giving up
The two girls reached the Slytherin Table just as the owl post arrived. Luckily for both girls, neither one had anything, but Tobias received his usual delivery of newspaper, bank reports and correspondence from family, friends and the Ministry. Between him and Draco, their entire section of the Slytherin Table was full. Without hesitation, all Pack members grabbed a small armful and disappeared through the doors of the Great Hall to deliver it to their individual studies.
Just like Tobias had thought, as soon as Dobby succeeded in removing Melody and the glamour from the man, George snarled and attacked viciously. Everyone in the restaurant quickly left the area once they saw who the culprit was, with one young man, running in the direction the real Draco had taken to ensure the blonde’s safety.
Tobias whispered a translation into Draco’s ear. Draco’s eyes widened when he heard the blessing. Standing at attention to reveal his own height, he bowed. “Thank you for your blessing, Guardian Raithia. May the sun warm your scales for many a year to come.”
“And William?”
Build it up with silver and god,
Tobias guided the blonde into the private clearing and gave him a drink to calm him. Once calm, Draco looked around the area with eyes filled with tears of wonder. Ivy and vines enclosed the clearing on three sides. The open side revealed the lake, dark in the night and reflecting the stars of the clear night sky above it. Along one side of the clearing lay an area hidden behind a woven divider of heather with a border of white daisy and bluebell flowers. The area they were seated in held a living sun lounge of woven vines and Ivy – on which they were seated. In the centre of the clearing stood a table complete with four chairs. Looking closer at it from where he was, he noticed the antique look of it. He thought it might be made of Blackwood or Walnut.
“Do you think they are alright?”
On the ground not too far away, he noticed his two mist-people companions gently rocking together, the older boy taking most of his sister’s weight as she seemed to drift between reality and the land on dreams.
Running into the house and up the stairs, he stopped at the doorway; shocked to the core at what was I front of him.  A large, beefy man was standing in front of a thin boy of around 15 or 16, who was chained face-first to the wall.  Out of the boy’s mouth flew obscenities, aimed at the behemoth behind him.  Once again, the sound of leather hitting flesh filled the room, followed by a pain-filled hiss.
Tobias smirked. “And was it Gran’thor Gryffindor who gave you the obnoxious attitude?” he asked sweetly.
“Gios.”
“I am sorry to be rude, but who are you?”
Severus nodded and followed the teen to the Great Hall.
“Go get the contracts and bring them to me,” Draco half-ordered. “Sometimes there are specific wordings in the contract that can be twisted around to give an out.” He paused for a second and asked softly. “If we can’t break it, is it so bad that the girls join our Pack? The Patil family is a good one – not just in the fact they are purebloods either. They are powerful, neutral or grey, depending on how you see it, and they have a reputation of forming close bonds with their bonded so even if they do not find a love like ours, they will still be happy.”
“Ejaculation and then give it,”
“I can discuss business with the twins, Hermione. I am the third owner of WWW, after all and I need to have an interest in what is happening in the shop. We need to discuss a lot of things for it – any new products, what is good for business, what is bad for business, what age group they are aiming for and what age group is actually buying the stuff, if we want to sell shares, if so how many. You know, all the statistics, facts and figures that go with running a business.”
“I received that mark before I had even left school. I had been promised protection from my Father and I got it, along with a family. You have to understand that back then the Dark Lord wasn’t about violence and world domination. He was against muggles finding out about us and was trying to get magical children born to muggles taken from them and exchanged with either a squib born around the same time or a child from an orphanage.”
“Tell me just what you’ve done that makes you worthy of my respect?” Tobias countered with a slight growl to his voice. “So far all I’m getting is you putting me with the muggles, you denying Sirius his rights as the heir and Head of an ancient pure-blood Clan, you ordering my parents death when they decided to go neutral, you leading me through the nose for five years of schooling and you were the one to use those bands on me, amongst other things.”
Severus went quiet, still stroking his arm with pain-filled eyes focused intently on the bare skin. Amelia waited patiently and in utter silence. She had not expected this when she had bought up the lack of dark magic coming from him, but she was happy that it was her that was overseeing this one and not someone else.
Lucius sighed. “This is the year of mine and Narcissa’s 20
Bill gaped at his younger brother. Charlie snorted.
Tobias calmed down under the soothing hands of his intended. Looking into Draco’s eyes, he nodded slightly at Sev, then towards his office. Draco nodded and escorted Sev into his office to administer a calming draught. Looking a Millicent and Pansy, he eyes flicked to the back of the room where Lavender was still strutting.
Draco followed his husband to the section of the Mother’s garden where they would be eating. He hummed in pleasure as he watched his husband’s hips sway to the natural rhythm of his walk.
She paused to smile at the young man as she prepared to give him the same advice she had given to his mother so many years ago.
Tom sighed and shook his head sadly. “No such luck, Severus. He doesn’t see anyone but me during the day and he meditates most of the night. Since he’s been here, he’s had an hour of sleep a night. When he wakes up, he runs, swims, runs some more, swims some more. He eats only enough to keep him going and I need to force him to drink the potion he needs.”
“You look a little tired yourself, Severus,” Pomona said, sitting in the seat usually reserved for Minerva. “Minerva is having a meal out tonight. She had a meeting at St Mungo’s. Something about an elderly gentleman using a complex transfiguration spell on his daughter-in-law and getting it wrong. Now the poor thing is stuck in a tri-way transfiguration of human head, snake body and ox legs, tail and horns.”
Bowing slightly in respect for her, Neville followed the three Slytherins, leaving his Grandmother in the library with tears of pride and joy gathering in her eyes.
The device had to be put on in a particular order for it to work properly. First, a long metal thorn with a ball on one end and a flat disc on the other had to be inserted into the slit of the penis, ball end first. Once it was fully seated, the ball increased in size until its position was visible to the naked eye as a slight bulge at the base of the organ it was inserted into.
Draco sat at the Slytherin table eating breakfast when a wand tip had been shoved into his face and the screaming had started. “Potter, I have no idea what you are talking about!”
“It cannot be broken,” the goblin said, almost apologetically.
“Milord?” Madam Greengrass appeared before the Dark Lord, completely missing the look of vindictive pride in her grandson’s eyes.
Tobias chuckled and nuzzled into Draco’s neck. “Mmmm, you smell good.” Draco smiled at him. “I can spend the rest of today and tomorrow with you Drakontas. I feel as if I have been neglecting you. How does spending today in classes and homework until dinner, when I’ll take you to a candle-lit dinner down by the lake sound?”
Lucius shook his head in amusement as he read Draco’s weekly letter. It seemed like Tobias wasn’t too far gone in his hormones that he was throwing things yet. It seemed to him that his son had lucked out on that front. The elder blonde man sighed heavily. He wished that his son and son-in-law could be removed from under the old coot’s thumb, but until the NEW results came through, but were stuck there. It didn’t mean he had to like it though.
“Because you are the only person in this entire country other than a Weasley that will piss Tobias off when he is this temperamental.”
Smirking to himself, he listened to the request before denying her request. After all, soldiers don’t need to think for themselves.
Wood and clay, wood and clay.
Draco smirked. “Sev has invited us for supper, so I think that can be arranged.”
Severus hid his burning face I the table with a groan. He knew he shouldn’t have gotten up today.
Silence reigned in the owlery fear thick in the air. Ginny found herself shivering in fear of the deity before them. This was not her friend – This was her Lord, no questions asked and she was fighting from bowing down before him as her instincts were yelling for her to do. It would not do for her to compromise her position just yet. She was startled when a calming essence filled her. Her muscles visibly relaxed. Somehow she knew the feeling was emanating from her Loyalty mark, and that everyone who had one was getting the same feeling. To her surprise the boy beside her also relaxed. Ginny raised an eyebrow at him. He just grinned unrepentantly in response.
“When would you like the ceremony?” Narcissa asked when she eventually calmed down.
Xeno waved a hand flippantly in the younger man’s direction, “As if you would act differently if it was required for one of your godson’s”
Standing silently, Minerva headed over to Madam Pince and spoke with her. Fifteen minutes later, she returned with a book that had the same runes on its dried blood coloured covering as the bands that they had put on Harry. She handed it to the girl in front of her with a stern gaze.
Tobias smirked at the older woman before turning back towards the goblin before them.
Draco blinked in confusion before it hit him. “Both Bi and the Cub are fine,” he said, smiling soothingly at the girl. “Tobias just had some business to attend at Gringotts today. The reason why none of us are with him is because two of our older members are with him.”
Tobias sighed happily and closed his eyes, smiling slightly as he felt the gentle strokes on his now visible bulge and an answering flutter from inside.
“Then let’s get started on writing all this down for Tobias to put into his report for The Lord. At least someone will have good news to report at this coming meeting. I just wish it was me,” Bill chuckled.
Remus silently laughed as he watched his Neogennito, before he also stormed out of the room, growling dangerously.
Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head and he got the urge to grab the tease above him by the hips and force him harder and faster onto his still aching cock. He tried to move his hands, only to have the ties grip him tighter. He whimpered in desire as Tobias sank slowly back down and rotated his hips, obviously lost in his own world.
“Come on Bi, talk to me.” Draco said calmly, even though he was panicking on the inside. Tobias was NEVER this subdued. Absolutely never!
“So I’m going to assume that they won’t be awake any time soon,” Minerva sighed, putting her cup down.
“You’re welcome, Tobias.”
Silver and gold will be stolen away,
Draco grinned in response. “He threw a temper tantrum that any toddler would be proud of. He screamed at her for an hour before sitting in a chair and stuck it and him together by gluing himself to the chair and the chair to the ground using two over-strengthened sticking charms. Nothing anyone said would make him move until Neville got the idea to get Randal back. He got Tobias to go with the hag by saying that his Healer to stay with him at all times. You should have seen the look on Umbridge’s face when she realised that the Healer was Algernon Longbottom and she couldn’t order him around. When she tried he looked at her and said, ‘I only take orders from the parents of my patients or those who are over-run by pregnancy hormones. Last I checked you had no children and you are far too old to be pregnant so shut up and stay away from me.’”
Do you swear to sever all ties to those who do not accept our ideals?”
“Not even he knew what he was thinking when he did it,” Sprout answered with a shrug. “As to why they asked for Minerva … well …” she cleared her throat nervously. “Turns out that the old fool not only mispronounced the spell, he combined two spells – one for human transfiguration and the other for non-living transfiguration the healers are unsure as to what can be done.”
“Would.”
With one last chuckle, he resumed the job he was there for.
There is a section in this chapter that I know will not happen in real life, but I put it in there due to several reasons. If you find what it is and have questions for why I put it in there, just ask and I'll answer it for you
“Did you mention that I wish for The Pack to be there before her punishment is settled?”
“Not too much, but I’m sick of hearing all about how ‘Great and Powerful’ Dumbledore is. It’s like all the parents in Gryffindor forced the same shit down their children’s throat and make them regurgitate it on command. You get some in other houses, but Gryffindor the most.  What are people teaching their kids now days?
Give him a pipe to smoke all night,
Ginny and Luna sat together in the Quidditch stands, not looking at anything in particular when a barn owl swooped down on them.
The next day Severus awoke to the wards of his room falling. Grumbling, he stormed to his sitting room only to stop in surprise. A frantic Draco was pacing around a medium sized box, which, when opened, revealed vial upon vial of crushed basilisk bone of varying coarseness.
With deft movements, the Father/Son team had Deloris restrained and with one last mirrored smirk, Lucius enervated her.
Draco was mesmerised by the Chamber. It was everything he thought of when he heard the words ‘Chamber of Secrets’. He looked on as Tobias hissed something while facing a large statue of Salazar Slytherin. Draco turned when those behind him gasped.
An hour later, Tobias was surrounded by his pack. Clearing his throat to gain their attention, he waited, ignoring the onyx eyes that were drilling into his back.
“No.” The word was whispered so softly that Severus wasn’t sure that he heard it.
Seating themselves, they finally allowed themselves to look at their starter. Draco hummed in delight, as he tasted the smoked Haddock Chowder. Tobias watched him with a small smile. All the food served tonight had been doctored so he could eat them also. He also tried the chowder and almost purred in delight – The sheep’s milk used suited it perfectly.
Anadochos – Greek for Godfather
Draco smiled softly. “I’d love to come with you Bi. Do you want to make it a midnight picnic?”
Minerva glowered at the elderly man. “There isn’t going to be any punishment, Albus. All three students have gone through the correct channels to leave the school grounds. If you were to actually READ the forms before you before sending them to me, then you would know this. As it is, even if they hadn’t, you wouldn’t be able to punish them as Mr Longbottom was pulled out by his Grandmother for business at St Mungo’s and these two gentlemen had a Healer’s appointment.”
Tobias moved and whimpered slightly, waking a little more. “Why do we have an audience, Draco?” he asked sleepily. “Are we on a stage?”
“Now that I have your attention once more,” Cornelius stated dryly, causing most of the hall to flush in embarrassment, “You will receive a folder from the man you go to that will hold your results, the areas you are best in, the areas you are worst in and tips on what you should focus on in reviewing.”
The unknown man let out an amused chuckle, “Never fear, it happens to the best of us. It’s only when you forget for no reason that you start worrying.”
Tom groaned. Now he’d done it. So much for his quiet night in.
“ENOUGH!” Tobias roared, standing from his seat in one smooth motion. “SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE HELL UP YOU BANSHEE!”
“M’kay,” was the missed reply as a soft THUNK indicated Tobias’ cup being put down. Within only a few breaths, Tobias was sound asleep, curled up in his husband’s side.
The goblin who she had asked looked at Grapplehank before answering at his nod.
“Why the hell would you want to kiss a Weasley?”
The Hall went silent with the exception of the soft whispering that was coming from Draco as he attempted to sooth his temperamental husband.
“You two need to talk right this second!” Draco ordered, looking at his godfather, “And you need to do so alone. I will be taking Bi. We shall be in the bathroom having a good long soak.” He walked over and removed Tobias from Severus, ignoring the man’s whimpers.
Ron smiled groggily at the two kids and softly hummed along when the verse was sung once again. He felt himself turning to face the opposite direction from the two mist kids. He didn’t struggle and happily looked up … than froze. He let out a moaned gasp and his eyes bugged out to massive proportions as he came to understand what was happening.
Tobias smiled warmly at the woman and curled up on his seat. “Leave the papers the way they are, I’ll finish them after a nap. Don’t ask me why I’m suddenly so tired.”
Narcissa smiled, not at all insulted by her son’s preoccupation. It wasn’t every day that your first child was born after all.
“It’s okay, Harry,” Severus soothed, “you can let the magic out now, it won’t do any damage.”
The next morning found The Pack in the Chamber bright and early. The sitting room now held a large table groaning under the weight of the food on top of it. There was steaming cinnamon twists, apple and minced fruit bread, a large bowl of Devilled kidneys with hot buttered toast around the edge, bacon, eggs, grilled tomato, sausage, yoghurt, muesli and an extra-large fruit and cheese platter.
This was, surprisingly, my favourite chapter to write. It just flowed so smoothly
“Don’t mind me,” Lord Patil said, raising both hands in the air. “I just came along to get away from the brats. You wouldn’t suspect that they were all over the age of thirty, the way they’re acting at the moment.”
“Sorry Rem. I was miles away.”
Tobias quickly pulled the now shaking man’s head around and forced his eyes to meet his own. “Calm down. Breathe deeply and calmly. That’s it. This is what I was talking about before. You are hyping yourself up. Open the letter and read the content, then freak out about what it says, not what it might say.”
The doors of the Great Hall slammed open, just as the Sorting Hat called out the house of the last student. Lucius stood in the doorway, face alight with hidden excitement as he searched the hall for something – or someone.
“Explain for us as well, will you?” Pansy requested. “Your Grandmother already contacted McGonagall about you being out of school – as has The Lord and Lucius for Tobias and Draco. The rest of us however …” she shrugged.
Remus snarled. “No! Walrus, whale and horse!”
It was dark and completely silent when Luna opened her eyes. She slowly stood and, as quietly as she could, she made her way to the door. Just before she slipped out, a hand landed on her shoulder. Startled, she spun around and placed her hidden knife to the throat of a wide-eyed Vincent, much to the amusement of Neville – as evident by the smirk on his face.
“Neogennito? Is this what you wish?”
Lucius nodded. “How are you feeling? Nervous?”
“Ready and waiting.”
Blaise gazed blankly at the woman he used to call ‘Grandmother’ before blowing air forcefully out of his lungs with contempt and looking away from her. He hadn’t been lying when he had said that he didn’t need anyone in his life. He had The Pack, anyone else was a bonus.
Tobias chuckled. “In the same manner, Nona. The sweet cause the reaction without any stimulation, so the person who eats it gets next to no pleasure out of it – just a sense of fulfilment and, of course, horror.”
Draco growled softly in agreement. He wanted to taste his husband again, and this was the perfect excuse to. Tobias shivered in agreement as Draco pulled him onto his lap. No one in the room missed the flame of magic burning in both of their eyes.
Tobias nodded. “I do like your garden, My Mother. I remember reading that poem a long time ago and it just seemed to fit.”
Draco watched Tobias closely as said teen alternated between glaring and pouting at the plate of food in front of him. After watching it for several minutes, he lowered his fork and turned to face his mate.
“You have to understand,” Fred continued with a nod of thanks at his brother, “that we have contracts with a few people and businesses which we are magically bound to silence.”
Everyone who knew that ‘Randal Jones’ was really the Dark Lord Voldemort stared at him in astonishment. Tom just grinned.
Remus looked away, not wanting to share the reason. Harry’s face lost all emotion.
It was just after eleven o’clock when Tobias walked into the rooms he shared with Draco. He was covered in blood. Draco noticed that the raven-haired youth was giddy. Laughing softly, he pushed the slightly smaller boy into the bathroom.
Tobias swallowed his last mouthful with a soft sigh of contentment. Once everyone finished and Tom left the table, Tobias gave his husband a gentle kiss and left. Draco smiled and challenged his godfather to a game of chess.
* * *
The girls turned to look at him. “We want to be able to be together for this seating, seeing that we feel more comfortable when we see each other once a day.”
You're my safest place to hide
I know I promised you forever
“In my time in the school, I have noticed that only a quarter of the rooms in the castle are used in any particular way and of them, only a third of the rooms are used for what they were intended for. The others are used as storage areas, are too damaged for use or they hold secrets hidden in time.”
Severus watched him sadly. There was a good chance the boy would be on that potion for the rest of his life. Starting from the second week of school, he would teach both Draco and Tobias how to make that potion, there were going to need the knowledge. Internally, he cursed the Headmaster, Weasley, Granger and those muggles for what they put the boy through. He was still deep in his thoughts when the end of the lesson was announced.
“No problem Alpha,” the girl answered with a smile. “We need to ensure that the two of you are healthy. We are family, after all.”
They heard a gurgling sound behind them and Severus hoped that Draco would make it to the bathroom in time.  Instead of looking, he started drawing runes on Harry’s chest while Lucius recited a lengthy magical formula and directed it at Harry. When the men had finished, Harry let out a whimper.
“Count us in as well,” the rest of The Pack stated. They wouldn’t feel right sleeping separate after the events of the day.
“So you eavesdropped on your teachers?”
“It is such a simple design that I should have been able to think of it sooner than I did. The main component is Mercury – which is normally a liquid, but I found that boiling it with the venom of a basilisk, the saliva of a Griffin and the tears of a death phoenix for seven and a half days solidifies it into a large sphere. It can then be forged using the flame of a Vipertooth living the heart of an active volcano and then set using the chill from a dementor’s heart.
“If it isn’t safe enough for me to visit my son, then it sure as Hell isn’t safe enough for my son in his condition. Now, are you going to let me in, or do I have to hurt you?”
The room resounded with a confident and resounding, “Yes.”
Harry tied down to a hospital bed while she, the Headmaster, Ron and Madam Pomphrey welded the cuffs to his wrists, ankles and neck. Harry’s screams as he writhed in pain on the same bed as a potions scalpel coated in some smoking substance was used to cut runes deep into his flesh over and over again. The soft whimpering as he asked why over and over again and the slowly encroaching betrayal that had filled his eyes as she told him sternly that it was all for the best, and the dead look in his eyes as the Headmaster told him that he was now safe enough for his relatives to handle while the menagerie of animals he called family all had mad glints in their eyes as she and Ron told them his magic had been bound, making it safer for them to be around their nephew.
Cornelius Fudge checked his watch once more. It was almost five minutes past nine and not all of the students were ready. The Slytherins hadn’t even turned up!
“Down it Pateras.”
“Yeah, that one,” Blaise grinned. “I think Madam Greengrass would look marvellous with purple striped skin, don’t you?”
For those who are familiar with this story, the next chapter is the one many of you are probably looking forward to, for those who aren't ... You'll just have to wait for tomorrow night my time to see what I'm on about. and Ann, luv? try not to destroy any eardrums tomorrow morning XD
Tobias smiled and returned to marking Draco’s chest and stomach with small love bites. When he got to Draco’s navel, he nibbled, sucked and licked the area with a single-minded determination that had Draco melt into the bed as his dick throbbed with desire. He smirked and made his way towards his prize. He licked his lips, looking at the leaking tip.
“With so much magic, and released in the conditions both of you released yours in, the flowers reacted. For most people, the flowers would have changed either their colour, or their structure. Because the two of you decided to refrain from seeing the other for two weeks, the magic that bound you together was increased because you had proven that neither time nor distance could lessen the love that is between you.”
A soft blue light erupted from Voldemort’s wand to touch Harry’s forearm. When it vanished a black, green and blue phoenix wrapped in a black and silver snake appeared in its place. Voldemort smiled.
“So did the threat of my ‘murderous’ godfather, who would be very upset if I didn’t contact him at least once a week, but they took that away from me. My dear,” Harry put so much sarcasm and bitterness into that one word that Severus was surprised the acid from it didn’t burn Harry’s throat, “friends and Headmaster told the Dursleys of Sirius’ death, knowing of how I have always been treated there in the past.”
“Stay like that. DO. NOT. MOVE,” Harry ordered, giving a sharp tap to the base of the butt plug with each word. With a murmured spell, the ropes coiled up on themselves until Draco’s arse was level with Harry’s face. Another spell found Draco’s legs being spread painfully until they were at an almost ninety degree angle to either side of his hips. Once Harry was happy with the way Draco looked, he flicked out his tongue and fluttered it along the edge of Draco’s entrance. After that first taste, Harry released his control and licked, lapped, sucked and nibbled the muscular ring the best he could with the plug still in its place.
Tobias beamed and handed Draco his fork while he held onto his spoon. Everyone watched in horror as Draco chewed and swallowed the piece he had put in his mouth.
“Would take back the offer of having –”
Draco smiled and bowed his head slightly, vowing to do as the god had suggested and never make Tobias, their pack, parents and any children they may have feel as if anything was more important than them.”
Theo shuddered. Luna may be the best of them at torture, but Blaise was a very close second. If his victim had been anyone but Granger, Theo would have felt for them.
--END FLASHBACK—
“No,” Tobias chinned softly, “I’ve just been reminded on how much I hate Dumbledore.”
Severus had never been gladder that Tobias had been restoring his father’s humanity then at that moment. He still couldn’t believe he’d gotten away without one Crucio leaving the Dark Lord’s lips. He was relieved that he had finally chosen a side, and that it was the right side. He still couldn’t believe that Dumbledore had put his Neogennito through everything he had and still expected him to be light.
Tobias paled, as did Draco.
Instead of cowering like she would have done in earlier years, Millicent straightened to her full height, proud of her body and confident in the strength it held. She wasn’t known as Bouno for nothing and she wouldn’t allow the feeble minds of the masses shake her foundation.
‘Kyria was right,’ Remus thought as he picked the man up frowning slightly at how light the other man was, ‘He needed the security of the bite. I am such a fool. It is time and past that I pull my head out of my arse and become the Alpha my mate needs me to be. I hope I will be even a fifth of the Alpha Neogennito is to his Pack, to Severus.’
Ginny shook her head. “Weak, no sugar, little bit of milk.”
“Hermione.” Hermione looked up from her hands, which had been holding onto her now empty cup in her lap as if it was a lifeline. “We are very disappointed in you. We’ve always trusted that, before you jump into things, that you would ask or look for information about it first.”
Everyone in the room laughed as both twins held each other and burst into sobs of fear.
“That causes Premature,”
Gasps were heard around the Hall from students who didn’t know what had transpired between the so-called Golden Trio.
Tobias smiled softly at him and cuddled into him once more. “I promise, Drakontas.” Looking at him he asked quietly, “would you like to join me in my morning ritual?”
~Anotherline~
“Do you mind if I have a look at what you’ve got so far?” Filius asked, almost bouncing in joy.
Amelia cleared her throat in an attempt to not laugh, knowing by the look on the goblin’s face that he knew the words were an insult to wizards and witches, not to Gringotts itself.
“Severus Snape! What in the blazes is going on here? And why is my foster godson laying on a bed in my clothes!” a normally soft-spoken voice yelled from behind Draco, who jumped.  Unfortunately for the men beside the bed, so did Harry, who had just started to drink his next potion.
Luna smiled. “Ready or not, here I come!” Luna slowly started to run after the red-head.
Draco smirked. “When I mark what is mine, I don’t mess around. I wasn’t kidding when I said no one would doubt that we are taken.”
Lucius shocked her by chuckling – a rich, velvety sound that suited the man as though it had been made for him and him only. “Tobias is favoured by The Mother and Draco has avowed himself to The Father. Any mortal magic that is used for mind manipulation or control is null and void as soon as they touch skin or lips. Draco and Tobias are participating for legal reasons, not because there is a chance they are compromised by ill-meaning interfering warlocks.”
When Kitten had deposited the Potion’s Master and the three non-Slytherins in the Snake Pit, they were all awed at the silence. Nothing bar the notes of a guitar could be heard. The song hadn’t even completely finished when the player switched songs. Ginny grinned, waiting. At the right time, she joined in the song with her powerful voice. As she and Tobias finished Voltaire’s ‘When you’re evil’, the common room was full of laughter – Even Severus had a tiny smile on his face.
“He … Did he?”
“She did what?” Remus growled.
“What did he do?” Remus asked, a grin starting to form against his will. He was the person who was around The Lord the most so he knew exactly what he was like outside his ‘I-am-the-Dark-Lord-so-piss-your-pants-before-I-Crucio-you persona.
Tobias had just finished explaining Luna’s situation of the past four and a half years to the four Heads of House and not one of them was happy.
The twins grinned at her. “All us marked ones could have been – but who would have suspected to look for Slytherins in Gryffindor?” This bought another round of laughter.
Tom chuckled. “Yes Gios. There is going to be a difference, however. These five are not going to be obtaining my mark – they will bare yours, and you will be the one marking them. Do you know what your mark is going to be?”
Tobias nodded and opened the letter. As he was reading, his smile grew. If all went well, His Pack would be out of the school within two weeks, but for now, he was hungry, thirsty and wanted to see his husband. The four founders smiled as their heir left the rooms, not noticing the slight glow he held.
Chapter 20
“We may all have been on differing side in the last conflict in the Wizarding world,” Lucius stated, bring everyone’s attention to him while Amelia collected herself, “but whether we are dark, light, grey, neutral or foreign, we all want the same thing – a safe future for your children. In the beginning, I was a perfectly loyal member of the Dark Army. I had just been bonded to my wife and had discovered she was expecting a child. AS is tradition, we announced the good news …” Lucius trailed off, lost in past thoughts. “Three days later, three Merlin-condemned days later, I found Narcissa at the end of the charms corridor covered in blood and bruises with a note carve into her stomach reading ‘Death Eaters don’t deserve children.”
He was shocked out of his musings by a hand landing on his shoulder, preventing him from walking into a bush. Ten minutes later, Tobias walked up to them from the Forbidden Forest. He shook both escorts’ hands before bowing and extending his arm to Draco. Smiling, Draco accepted the arm and the two of them watched Vince and Greg made their way back to the castle – and their own dinner.
Draco sighed. “You didn’t tell me what type of damage he did to you. And don’t lie either, because I will check for myself, Mister!”
The sound of another body hitting a hard surface drew everyone’s attention to the newly bound couple, only for them to find Draco pinned to the closest tree getting enthusiastically snogged by an ecstatic Tobias. Smiling, everyone left them alone to enjoy their reunion after fourteen days apart.
“I wonder …” Ginny mused, eyes taking on a clouded look. “I will be right back.” She vanished, only to return twenty minutes later deep in thought and escorted by four furious men.
Severus smirked. “I will enquire of your Father as to which house-elf you are permitted to take. What will you do about a Healer?”
“That is a sight for sore eyes,” Tobias said with a gentle smile. “It’s wonderful to see a family that is as close as ours.”
Chapter 17
~END FLASHBACK~
Amelia, Lucius and Achalendra Patil looked at the man incredulously.
Remus staggered in shock. He hadn’t realised just how badly Severus was affected.
Draco let Vince and Greg escort him back to the Snake Pit. Greeting everyone he knew, he made his way to his dorm to find new clothing on his bed. A pearl-grey shirt and slate grey dress pants. Smirking, he made his way to the bathroom.
“Marriage contract!” Pavarti yelped. “That’s why we are here? For a marriage contract? With them?” she pointed to the still shocked red-headed twins. “I can’t marry one of them! They aren’t cute or rich or even heirs of their family!”
“I feel bad for the centaurs now,” George responded, “Remind me to apologise to every centaur we see for the next year. We did them a great disservice when we turned her into one of their number.”
He was answered with several murmurs of agreement before everyone left for the dining room.
Tobias pouted. “It did to me.”
“Thank you Father. Goodnight.”
Skotadi – Darkness
“How do you know that?” His Grace asked, honestly curious.
Draco shocked everyone by smiling. “It will be worth it, Remus. Speaking of the devil, where is he?”
Tobias groaned. “The seventeen I have from Filch only cover the past year!” He sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Well, I was the one who wanted to do this so I am going to see it through! What I need is a good solid period of time with no interruptions – but that is impossible. Let’s go Sev; I need a good night’s sleep.”
“Calm down Alpha,” Ginny said as she slid into the seat opposite the only mated pair currently in The Pack.
The Pack crowded around the love seat that had appeared in the Slytherin Common room. They smiled at the sight of the dozing couple.
Tobias smiled and started to walk again. “The eight families are Malfoy for Draco, Black for both of us, and from me there is Riddle, Potter –“
“Nearly eight days.”
Theodore cleared his throat. “The Hufflepuff lower years are becoming friendlier towards the Slytherin youngsters. Several of the older students are beginning to thaw towards us as a whole. I have to admit that it is easier without Draco around.” Draco pouted slightly, causing Tobias to chuckle.
The Matronly lady smiled at the younger man before walking out. The other five followed her example, each wishing the cat animagus a good night before heading to their rooms to work on their own reports.
“Harry! It’s come through! Come, come, come, come, come!” Harry had started to rise when Hermione snapped out of her silence.
A Saviour’s Depravity
He sighed again before laying down intent on going back to sleep when a soft tune caught his attention. He froze as the voice got closer and clear enough for him to recognise. “Not again,’ he silently begged, “No, no, no, no, no. Anyone but that voice!”
“Okay everyone. You know the drill. Everyone not Pack to your room. On the upside however, this may be our last meeting here. Now shoo!” Tobias made a shooing gesture at the room in general. Once the room had emptied, Tobias because serious. “Nonos. Do you have any news from Pateras, Anadochos, Lykos or Nona?”
People in the class that caught onto what wasn’t said stared at the dark-haired teen with horror. They couldn’t believe what they were hearing – who would do that to Harry Potter of all people?
“Youse called Dobby, Sir?”
“You, Mr Goyle, are an idiot and I believe that I am not the only one who thinks so. Over this summer, Severus had drilled me in potions until I could make them in my sleep. Since I have been returned to my real home, I have received Salazar Slytherin’s talent at the subject. Do you honestly thing that I would harm Pateras? And do you not think that if Nonos knew what to do and I did something wrong that he would not stop me?”
“We already know this Draco. We want to know why you will be going there instead of staying here!” Sev growled.
“Cissa, darling. Neither boy goes into detail. Tobias just said thanked me for the permission and that our Dragon accepted and that he accepted with a happy heart. We only have three more days, not including the rest of today to go before we see them again. We can ask them both then.”
“This,” he drawled in his usual bored tone, “is absolutely pathetic. There is no proof that Severus is a LOYAL Deatheater. They haven’t even sighted a Dark Mark on his flesh.”
“Now,” he stated as he removed the remains of the last tube, “We wait half an hour for them to do their job.”
Pansy sighed in exhaustion and rubbed her eyes. It had been two months since The Pack had graduated and a week since she and Ginny had been told to stop their exploration of the rooms of Hogwarts. She understood the reason – supported it even – considering that it was due to Tobias being transferred to Riddle Manor.
“What’s the matter ‘Bi?” he whispered.
Draco and Severus blinked in shock as Tobias lay his head back onto Severus’ shoulder and went slack, causing Severus to almost drop him due to the increase of weight.
“So you do remember me!” the disembodied voice said tinged with happiness, “How wondrously delightful! I’m afraid to say it, but you won’t be seeing my beautiful knives today. I’ve had to put them away so I can sharpen them; so instead, I invited a friend along to play with us. He doesn’t say much, but he has an amazing voice. I’m sure that the two of you will get along just marvellously.”
“Most of the remaining staff are neutral or have sided with Tobias. I have sworn to Tobias’ father as one of Tobias’ confidents/mentors, so I am honour-bound to Tobias.”
“Soup,” the elf answered before popping away.
Draco couldn’t keep the fond look off his face as he watched Tobias. He looked so at home. Still smiling, he made his way to the lounge the raven-haired youth was sprawled on. Tobias opened an eye slightly and smiled slowly. To everyone’s surprise he sat up, allowing Draco to sit behind him before leaning back against him. Both boys hummed in contentment.
Tobias strutted into the room, cool as a cucumber. “You wished to see me, Headmaster?”
Tom smiled with tear filled eyes. “You never will, Gios. Even if I’m no longer here in body.” He drew his son in close to him. Tobias just smiled and returned the hug.
“You are a wonderful person, Harry and now you are doubly special because you are carrying my precious children. I was planning on doing this later, and not in the Great Hall, but if I don’t do this now and make an honest man out of you, then y mother will make sure that she removes any other chance we have of having children.” Draco took a deep breath and pulled out a silver and gold box. “Will you let me make you mine for all the world to see?”
When she arrived at her destination, Andrew Stephens was holding only a rolled up scroll held together with a burnt umber ribbon.
“I don’t think any of us expected him to be like this with anyone.”
“Firstly, do you, Hermione Granger, promise to tell no one who gave you this book – nor the information you gain from it?”
Chapter 8
Tom blinked. “Where’s Tobias?” he asked dumbly.
Ten minutes later, silence reigned as Tom walked into the garden with a silent green-eyed youth hiding behind him, eyes downcast. Tom turned and lifted his son’s face with a finger under his chin. Silently he placed a kiss to his son’s forehead. The congregation was so quiet you could hear the Manor’s Albino Peacocks in the far distance.
“Draco! I need you to get two stomach potions, four nutrient potions and all the muscle relaxant potions you can find,” Severus ordered, removing the top sheets off the bed. Removing the robe Harry was wearing, he added, “and the potion in the blue jar I tell you to never touch!”
“We insist on this happening because it is what your parents wish us to do. The majority of them are worried about what they are hearing from their children and the children of their friends. All of them, however, are disturbed about just how much they are not being told by the Headmaster or the other Professors concerning their children’s health, wellbeing and education. Your families are worried about you – as is expected of them when their world has been turned upside down and one of their children are away from the safety of their home.”
“Potter.”
“It means ‘Precious One’ in our tongue. We have been calling The Mother’s Raven this since we knew of his presence.”
“My bones are resinating with it. Mother isn’t happy. I almost feel sorry for whoever invokes her wrath.”
Severus slumped into his seat once the last student left. The sight that had greeted him when he went to collect the troublemakers had shaken him more than he thought possible. He knew that punishment had been created for use on him over his house-elves – he just hadn’t truly believed the boy would dare use it.
The old man sadly shook his head. This mystery about Voldemort’s heir was taking his attention away from his problem with the brat. How in the world did he manage to get the Malfoy family Patriarch and Severus behind him? And even more importantly...What could he do to break apart the young Malfoy and the brat? A gleam appeared in the old man’s eye and he started to make his plans as he absent-mindedly ate his toast and kippers.
Draco met Tobias in the supply cabinet and hugged him from behind. “Are you okay, Bi?” he whispered.
Both Slytherins swore heatedly and sped up slightly. Neither of them wanted to miss out on today’s activities.
The Pack sat together at the Slytherin table – Neville included. They didn’t care about what anyone else thought because they were feeling incomplete without their pack members. They felt as if it had been days, not hours since they heard from them.
“Just after lunch,” the only Ravenclaw in the group said. “I was going to ask your assistance after the evening meal had finished. I love being a Ravenclaw,” she said sadly in her dreamy fashion, “but it appears my time there has come to an end.”
“Keep your mouth shut too – You’re not here to comment on my touchiness,” he snarled. Draco stepped to his side and murmured to him. Tobias pouted. “But Draco, I want to be the one to punish her,” he whined.
Harry laughed, bowed slightly and walked to his room to shower, leaving behind a smiling Draco and a grinning, spying Severus.
“We may need a little help from Kiki and Epiki from time to time,” George grinned and ducked as two spells were flung at him..
True to their word, she was not allowed out the front door without one or both of her parents with her, and all owls from the Weasleys had be delivered to her parents, who had declined their offers to have Hermione for the holidays and have since then, burnt all letters with no response. She was glad that the letters had now stopped.
Voldemort smiled at his son. “So, Rowena’s gift has been awakened fully now, has it?”
“Well Neogennito, so far he has been planning an attack on your father’s side. He is also worried about this new person he is starting to hear about. The Death Eaters do not ever speak his name – even when under Veritaserum. Even though he doesn’t reveal it to the Order, this fact scares him. All he knows about him is the name whispered among the Death Eater ranks – Gios ek Skotadi – Or Son of Darkness. This boy is rumoured to be the Dark Lord’s heir.”
As THE SONG CAME TO A CLOSE, Harry watched in astonishment as Draco grabbed the poles on either side of him and jumped, lifting his legs until they wrapped around the outer edge of his arms, spreading his arse cheeks so far that a small trickle of lime-scented water escaped from behind the butt plug. Before the last notes of the song had escaped into the room, Harry was between his Pet’s legs, slowly licking the sweet liquid from the pale lower back
Remus laughed and nodded. “He did, first night there too. I hope you’re ready for school Draco. You’re going to have to last for two weeks.”
Without changing his blank facial expression, Harry answered, “Two to three times a day, and every second day it wouldn’t be with his fingers.” Severus turned an alarming shade of green. No one else spoke, not even to answer the question Harry had asked.
Draco nodded slowly. “I am exceedingly nervous, but also excited. I haven’t seen Bi for fourteen days, and I want him back where he belongs.”
“Hello, are you alright?” a high voice asked him.
Tom and Severus collapsed onto the seat behind them in shock.
Tobias nodded absentmindedly, an almost psychotic grin on his face. Everyone around him could tell he was planning. “Ok Gin. I’ve got something for you to do. First, I want you to ask Granger what she knows of the Hell’s Gate bracelets and the Hell’s Pit curse. Make her that intrigued that she needs to know more. When she is in the study mode that we all know, leave her be. She’ll come crawling back when she realizes what they’ve done. She always does. When that happens, just leave her to me.”
Amelia nodded once and left muttering about paperwork.
Before she could get two deeply into her thoughts, she was guided – read ‘man-handled’ – into a chair. She pouted as every one of her ideas was shot down. Seems they didn’t see the beauty of deep red blood glistening in the moonlight. Pity … it was such a wondrous sight.
Both lists glowed blue then silver, transforming themselves into marriage contracts in Lucius’ hands. Blinking, Severus looked at the two before them, to the contracts then to Lucius, who seemed just as shocked as he was.
‘Yes,’ he thought as Draco placed a possessive arm around his waist and rested his hand protectively over where their child had been found the day before, ‘life is perfect.’
After that, she was going to return to the Room of Requirement and double-check that her work place was still the way she wished for it to be for her …. Guest … She smirked at the thought. Yes, he was a guest – an unwilling guest, but a guest none the less.
“Does it need to be addressed within the next three days?” George asked as he took the scroll without looking at it.
Ginny beamed, happy with the results so far.
The boys laughed softly before extending their hands and revealing the identical rings. Everyone’s eyes widened when they noticed that Tobias had the more delicate ring of the two, but they said nothing, already having been told about Tobias’ preferred position.
“It isn’t Alpha I’m worried about,” Ginny said going slightly green. “It’s Beta.”
“And can we switch out?”
“Leave him there,” Tobias ordered. Spinning around to face Severus, he asked, “Will it be like this every time I come into contact with any of them three, or just all three of them at the same time?”
Wu, Xing
Silver and gold, silver and gold.
Minerva flushed slightly. “No, I guess not – but he is there, isn’t he?”
Severus spoke softly. “Bi? Can you control what guardian you have?”
Draco bit down on the nipple in his mouth, then soothed it with his tongue, ignoring the now desperate whimpers coming from his husband. He started to nibble on the one still in his mouth while he pinched the other between thumb and forefinger before twisting them slightly. After he had reduced Tobias to a quivering pile of goo, he swapped nipples to reduce him to more of a quivering pile.
“Uncle Algie,” Neville said, nodding respectfully.
“I didn’t mean to get lost in it,” he said after another quick spoonful, “I didn’t know I could get lost in paperwork without even doing it. This is yummy. Did Dobby say what it was?”
Chapter 12
“Algernon. Randal,” Severus greeted with a smile.
Third she would talk to Neville about helping her again. Hmm, maybe she should actually ask that first … Nah, she could do it alone if she had to: she just thought that Neville would like to participate this time. She was sure that he would, he had, after all, wanted to kill the red-headed prat after almost hitting Alpha with that spell. She grinned lazily and skipped the rest of the way to her common room.
“Promise?” Tobias pouted.
By the time breakfast arrived, word that The Hermione Granger had an ownership bond and was marked for death had made its way through the house of Lions and everyone was itching to spread it around – especially the part of who had issued the mark for death upon her.
Tobias raised his lips and paused the softly to Draco’s. “Trust me? Please?”
She smirked as she found the page she wanted and read the information, scoffing at what the author was saying about a guardian of magic taking vengeance on those who use the spell for acts of un-righteous vengeance. Magic was a tool to be used. It wasn’t sentient and it didn’t have some mythical woman who surveyed its use.
“I didn’t do any damage did I?” he asked, panicking slightly.
“Pateras says that he’s going to call a full meeting in a few weeks’ time. We will have our first full meeting either tomorrow night or the night after. Our study group will be starting up once more when lessons begin. Naturally, Prefect duties and Quidditch will interfere, so we will not have any meetings on those days – or if we do, we will cut them short so that no one misses out on them. Draco and I will also start sleeping the Founder’s Rooms a few nights a week.” He stretched, groaning in please as his spine crackled. “Is there anything we need to be made aware of before the next time we meet up?”
She looked up, teary eyed. “You said you weren’t sure about the red-haired one, but I’d have a friend for life in Harry.”
“What?” they chorused, tilting their heads to the side like a littler of curious puppies.
“Riddle, Malfoy, Potter and Black,” Luna said absent-mindedly. “The other four names are even more obvious considering where we are, who our Alpha is and who we are talking to at the moment.”
Bath-time fun and a slight look into Luna's art.
He missed the thrill of the game, the chasing of the snitch – and most of all he missed competing against Draco. He missed the adrenalin rush that came from being free and in the air. He hadn’t even touched his broom since the toad had taken it away from him. He was jarred back into the present by a hand larger than his own covering one of his. He looked up into a pair of silver eyes, full of regret over thoughtless words.
“Harry Potter,” he hissed, narrowing his eyes.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Amelia began, “What are the consequences of one party breaking the contract?”
Remus shrugged and returned to what he was doing. Lucius followed his example, willing to accept this odd behaviour as a gift.
“Shut up Smith,” Draco stated clearly at the same time Tobias said:
“You must remember that once we leave here, you are not allowed to use magic at all, not even for lubricant. I know this sounds harsh, but they are the rules,” Booph cut in.
“The original plan was to talk to the few students, the staff then eventually to the Headmaster. Unfortunately our plans have been required to change. We are now cancelling all classes until this matter is dealt with. Every person in the school is going to be looked over by a Healer from St Mungos and the results will be duplicated. One copy will be cross checked with the file in the school nurses office; one will be kept at St Mungos. If there is cause for concern, then a letter will be sent to your parents or guardians telling them to come to the school at their closets convenience and we will discuss the problem to see if a logical reason is available for the anomaly.”
“Here,” Luna stood and moved to the older teen. “The strap goes around your neck, like this,” she put the machine into the right position, “and you turn the handle at the pace you want the music to play. I’d suggest a slow pace at first and speed up until it sounds right.”
Blaise winced softly at the strength of her voice. “Please lower your voice, Grandmother. We stopped for lunch at one and because Tobias was falling asleep at the table, Draco suggested that the two of them have a nap. We decided that four of us would rest while two would watch and we would change every two hours. Neville and Millie went first and they woke us up roughly an hour and 20 minutes ago so they could sleep. Neither Tobias nor Draco have woken, though they have been stirring for the past fifteen minutes. They should be awake by six so they can eat.”
“I am the scholar here,” Theo said, still puzzled.
“Can you explain something to me?” Blaise asked. Everyone turned to look at him. “Why is he getting the sickness, cravings and other symptoms now rather than them starting later like other pregnancies?”
Twenty minutes later, the darker daemon reappeared before them.
Tobias looked at his father with a small smile. “Yeah, sorry about that – but the poor excuse of a potions ingredient was trying to kill me.” A smirk lit his features, as did something no one had seen for a long time – a mischievous twinkle in his green eyes. “And there was also this smug Slytherin that came out of a diary that was attempting to killing my adopted sister as well, urging the damn thing on.”
“Always” Tobias whispered back, closing his eyes and melting back into the mattress.
“Can’t you heal him?” George asked.
“Yes and I’m sure if asked, Severus would be willing to submit the memory of his rescue of Tobias,” she answered.
Pavarti snorted, “What, like giving birth and keeping house?”
“Remember,” they heard him say, “He’s dangerous and needs to be treated with utmost caution. The Headmaster needs this to be done ASAP.”
Luna absent-mindedly ran her finger though Ginny’s hair. Both girls had wandered towards the lake mid-morning and had settled into an easy silence. She looked down at the head in her lap and smiled. She had always wished that she’d had a sister, and now she had one in the fiery girl dozing in the weak winter sun. She leaned back against the tree and closed her eyes.
She glanced to the blonde on her left and placed a hand on his shoulder, jolting him from his thoughts.
The Pack was in a room that resembled the Snake Pit, but twice as large. The walls were the black of the chamber about them. Unlike the Chamber, however, the edges were mother of pearl. The floor was covered with a lush cream and pale grey carpet. Looking at the ceiling, they found the same mosaic as in the entrance tunnel. Glancing around to find where their Alpha had disappeared to, their jaws dropped when they saw him. He was lying on a black snakeskin lounge. Before him was a large fireplace with emerald and sapphire flames leaping out of it. His eyes were closed and he looked relaxed.
Anadochos – Godfather
“No, we’re up,” Draco said as he guided Tobias into the room. “Well … one of us is at least.”
Draco sent a smile down at his bonded as he felt more than heard him sigh in contentment. It was then that the screaming started.
“We will join you,” Neville announced without consulting the others. “We are a Pack and while the rest of The Pack sleeps, Millie and I will stand guard.”
Hermione sat at the far end of the Gryffindor Table attempting to eat while ignoring her shaking hands. It felt like so long since she had learnt of the crimes against one whom she should have done her best to protect that she had almost forgotten what it was like to have friends. Her desire to live long enough to celebrate her next birthday had been proven to be a waste of hope, as she had discovered the previous night.
Draco blushed slightly at the memory those words bought up – one where a six-year old version of himself was planning on running away to Australia because he was sick of snow.
“I don’t trust the Healers,” Tobias said, pacing faster. “Healers aren’t to be trusted.”
He covered a yawn and blinked sleepily. “Kitten has agreed to reveal all hidden areas for us to explore as well in exchange for having everything cleaned and fixed. She hates feeling dirty.”
“We were ordered to,” they chorused.
“Draco, see me after class without the young Lord.” Draco nodded.
Pansy and Theo scowled at the new edition. “Did you have to do that Neville?”
“Tom,” Narcissa huffed as she spun around, “Should you be up?”
Tobias nodded and allowed himself to be lead into the bathroom. “I’ll do that in class today. Epikindynos, Skoteinos, Kyria, Katara and Hemerotes are sending me their reports by owl post this morning. I have those from the twins and ours. Arketa, Pontikos, Arpakitiko, Bouno, Dynamo and Skia will be giving theirs to me at breakfast. We have DADA and potions first right?”
“Trust Bi to,”
“Yeah. The only time the brat isn’t willing one or both of us to AK him is when a member of The Pack is with him, or he is asleep. I bet that Tobias is the same.”
“Mine!” he growled as his seed filled his husband.
“All of it,” Tobias pouted. “The peas are hard, the potato is raw and the fish is oozing greasy icky stuff … And I don’t even want to know what THAT is supposed to be,” he pointed at the sauce that lay congealed on the side of his plate.
While the three men were talking, none of them noticed that the noise level had started to fall until only a soft murmur was left as the younger years left. It wasn’t until Minerva stood again that the three men noticed the change.
“The first sweet we just call ‘Chatters’.” Severus gave Neville a half-smile in encouragement and pride before handing him a small purple set of lolly teeth – small enough to sit on Neville’s tongue. “The way the sweet is consumed determines the severity of the reaction. If they are consumed slowly – as Neville is doing now – the reaction is slower and much milder than if it is chewed. The effect is even worse if they are just swallowed. Now, if we watch Neville, you will see the skin around his eyes, lips and fingers go pale blue. His teeth will start chattering softly and he will be cool to the touch. This will last till the sweet has dissolved. A simple glass of water will heat him up again.”
She looked away from them, therefore missing the amused smirk that was sent her way by the dark-skinned Slytherin. She was his – she just didn’t know it yet.
Fred and George exchanged grins that would have sent a goblin scurrying for cover if they had been on the receiving end of it. “We can’t wait!” they almost crowed.
Draco watched her in bemusement before looking at the Head Table and catching his father’s eye. At the older man’s nod, Draco rose.
“If you ever say anything disrespectful about my husband again, I will tear you apart slowly. Do I make myself clear?” he growled, his silver-green eyes swirling in his anger.
Everyone in the room, bar Voldemort, shivered in their seats at the growl in Harry’s voice. Harry then shook himself and looked at Severus.
“What is going on here?” Minerva barked. She was not happy about getting woken at 1:30 in the morning by her student’s shenanigans.
“In the real world, apologies mean nothing,” Tobias told her coldly. “An apology is for when you hit someone with an innocent spell instead of what you were aiming at. You don’t apologise and expect everything to go back to the way they were before due to your part in attempting to murder someone.”
Tobias looked at Draco, who nodded slightly. Both boys slowly unbuttoned their shirts and pulled them off. Turning their backs on the room, they heard a deep intake of breath. In a space the size of a palm between their shoulder blades was their bonding mark. A silver dragon wrapped in a black and gold snake, holding a black green and blue phoenix all protected by an Earth Daemon’s claws.
Tobias sighed. “Can it wait til after the marking, Lykos? I don’t want to have to explain it several times over. I also think Pateras wished to talk to me about something before supper.”
“For Merlin’s sake, Ronald Weasley!” Tobias exploded. “Do you really think I need you to hold my hand when I go and have a piss? Do you really need to know how many times I get up in the night to make water? And do you think I need help shaking it off, because I can tell you right now that I am perfectly able to pull myself without supervision! If I didn’t know any better, I’d believe that you work for Rita Skeeter. I’m not allowed to do anything, not even housework. I’m not allowed to send an owl to anyone without either of you reading or writing it. AND YOU WON’T EVEN LET ME BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ANYONE ELSE WITHOUT YOU TWO BEING STUCK TO MY FREAKING ARSE! SO WILL YOU JUST PISS OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE FOR FIVE FUCKING MINUTES!”
“How about we all call it a day and head back to the Manor?” Theo asked. “School is out now so there is no reason for us to be here all the time … especially when Alpha can’t be here.”
Tobias helped himself to more fruit. Draco blinked in surprise. He hadn’t noticed that Tobias had been eating while talking. As the meal progressed, no one failed to notice the shy, tentative touches shared between the two boys.
“That’s good, Sly,” Draco murmured, “because I’ll be damned if I miss the first opportunity I have to publically stake my claim of you, so you better be ready.”
“Forgotten me already Husband?” the imposter said with a smirk.
Tobias stretched. “Are there any other things that need to be discussed? No problems within The Pack? No? That’s good to hear. Now, I want all of you to go to bed and right to sleep. Sev, the letter I asked you to write can be worked on tomorrow night. I want you all in the Great Hall at 7:30 tomorrow morning – 8 at the latest – for a decent breakfast.”
Tom visibly shrank and the three people behind him slumped slightly. “They don’t want to see us?” Tom whispered.
“Okay Love,” Draco chuckled, planting a soft kiss to the top of Tobias’ head. “I’ll wake you to go with Professor McGonagall.”
“It would make it easier for the seventh ears to be done now rather than last since it is NEWT year for them,” Ariandra responded, “though I wonder why we didn’t do them first.”
Pack meeting and Healers appointment
Lord Achalendra Patil.”
“Of course I do,” George croaked, “but I have to fulfil it. I can’t lose the shop Bi.” He looked up with tortured blue eyes, “And I can allow the Patil family to lose their seat, money and their reputation by having them break the contract.”
Tobias chuckled and nodded. “Of course Drakontas.”
Derrin – Pronounced Dare-Inn
“This is Draco Malfoy, My intended – My mate.”
“How very Slytherin of you Mr Black,” Narcissa’s eyes twinkled, reminding everyone forcefully of the Headmaster. “Are you going to be taking such games into the bedroom?”
A/N read if you wish, but if you can’t be bothered, then don’t complain : - I know that there are many things that are not possible in rl in this fic, but that’s what this is – a work of fiction in which magic is the norm rather than the exception. I’m sure that if there is a potion that can regrow bones and one that can turn you into another person, then there are potions for all types of things – including bedroom games.
