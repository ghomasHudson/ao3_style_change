"I don't know , Harry I deserve all kind of worst, filthy words why my son has to go through horrible things because of me Harry? I am sorry so sorry that I chose to be in the wrong side, but I had to Harry I had no bloody choice.  Harry. I know I deserve the worst but my son ,he doesn't . He is so much better than me Potter . Draco suppressed a sob .
"Hi Albus...  Dad this is my friend Albus . I told you remember . Albus this is my dad Draco Malfoy " Scorpius said in a very formal way and he kind of hugged Albus back in a very aristocratic way.
" No need Draco I really would like to travel back and know some of your dirty little fantasies." Harry winked .
"Well my dearest princess I am not a magician. But surely I am a good uncle with white hair who loves chocolates as much as you  do".
Draco kneeled down and said "you know, maybe you are a slow reader but that doesn't makes you any degree less than your mother . You are one of the brightest witches I have seen . "
Both the auror rushed towards him . Kingsley was vigorously shaking. Within seconds his arms caught fire out of no where and it started to burn .  The wizards tried various spells nothing was helping.  Suddenly Draco turned towards Harry .
The scene shifted to the Malfoy Manor .  He could see a Draco who was younger . There was a sign of peace and sanity written on his face . He looked more happy than the Draco who was crouching beside him . The scene Draco was  walking in the garden and Harry saw him plucking a rose . A red rose . The younger Draco hummed a tune ....and Harry saw him smile . The smile Harry longs to see more often when they are together . The smile that just melts his heart . The smile was breathtaking beautiful . The scene Draco started to walk inside the manor . Harry could feel Draco snatch  his elbow roughly , he looked at Draco's eyes and saw silver eyes full of anger and regret .  They crouched and followed the scene Malfoy into a room .
"Hmm... Maybe Scorpius could help us regarding Daphne. You maybe should not tell Al because he will take it in some other way , you know he likes him , and if the girl is not guilty then ... "
"Better than yesterday . Harry are you okay? You were so lost yesterday.  I am sorry i was not there for you"
Harry was looking at him with admiration and he wandlessly dimmed the lights . "Always Potter such a showoff ." Muttered Draco . Harry closed the distance in between them . "There it chocolate there ." Harry tried to clean it but before he could understand anything he saw Draco lowering his face and licked Harry's column of throat . Harry moaned . Harry was already hard . His precum leaking . "Daaad.... hungry...food." Screamed Lily . Draco laughed his infectious laugh . "Its okay Potter we can try this later."
"And there will be severe punishment if I catch someone plus deduction of 100 points from the respective house" The headmistress announced as she joined Harry on the podium .
"Ofcourse it is you Potter. You can't even walk. Well well Potter if you had quite  done checking me out then please excuse me I have some important works to do. Not privileged like you .  You see. Had to work my ass off to get recruited in this post . Not like you everything comes to you .....
Draco stepped inside the library . He knew all wizard houses posesses a library atleast. He wanted to know more about the whole ordeal right now . Harry went to cook the dinner. Draco took out the list of names that Minerva had provided him earlier today and scanned all the names. He was not surprised to see Delphi's name there. It means she took admission after the war . Delphi's file doesn't contains some really valuable information . It says Delphi is an extremely bright girl and she was exceptionally good at potions. She being a third year once tried to brew liquid luck! Draco previously asked Harry to give him the memories of his second year because he wanted to see Voldemort and think why on earth Harry thinks Delphi is related to Voldemort. Harry hesitated at first but he gave the memory. Draco casted a tempus charm and saw he has about an hour before Harry calls for dinner . So he summoned the pensive and poured the memory . He diped his head and saw  Harry approaching the chambers. Harry entered and saw Ginny . He ran towards him . Draco could feel Harry is extremely afraid. He shook Ginny to wake up . But she was unconscious . And then Draco heard a voice.  A voice which had no human edge.  Both of them looked up and  Draco saw an extremely handsome man wearing Slytherin robes standing. Harry refered him as Tom Riddle and a shiver ran down Draco's spike . This was the dark lord. Such a beautiful face can be so destructive Draco thought. Then he saw Riddle took Harry's wand and wrote his name. And with a swift gesture of his wand the words TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE* changed completely to *I AM LORD VOLDEMORT*. Draco was shivering . He had no clue how could Harry him . He felt disgusted with himself for taunting Harry . He would have wetted his pants if he had to do this, even now . And then Draco saw the Basilisk and how Harry fought that giant beast single-handed. Draco was in the verge of crying when the Basilisk bit Harry . But then he heard Harry calling him for dinner and Draco heaved a sigh of relief as he heard Harry's voice . His Harry is safe and alive .
"God Harry didn't you ever read the books. Maledictus is a blood curse which is carried by witches . They are animagus that means have control over their changes for sometime but after that limited amount of time the person permanently turns into the animal form ."
As Harry was sinking the new information in Draco questioned the duo about anything they found strange in Hogwarts . Both said no . So both Harry and Draco thanked their children and headed towards the Gryffindor tower. But Albus and Scorpius wanted to join them . So the tetrad headed towards the Gryffindor tower.
Harry then started kissing Malfoy . His neck his  chest . His ran his tongue in circles around Draco's pink nipples . Lapping them with his saliva . Then he took one of his nipples and bit it. And Draco moaned . The did the same for the other . Draco pulled him up and kissed him fiercely. Then Draco smirked at him . He pushed Harry against the wall and went down on his knees. " Well I guess a part of yours seeks my attention" . Draco unclasped the belt . Pulled down the zipper. Immediately Harry's erection jumped out . "Hmm nice cock Potter" Draco murmured as he kissed the slit .
"How can you work with this death-eater. They are the reason my brother is dead. Malfoys are supposed to rot in azkaban."
As Harry and Draco entered the office of the head auror they felt Kingsley is tired and afraid !, afraid of what?  they thought.
After tedious work in the potion lab both Draco and Hermione was terrified to find the end result of the test . It was indeed the rudimentary body portion Voldemort made to rise again in Harry's fifth year . The thought scared both Draco and Hermione .
With this Kingsley left Harry alone  into the office and left . Harry sighed. He existed the cabin and started to walk towards his office .
Harry rolled his eyes and pulled Draco by his collar and kissed him again . Harry felt Draco's hands snake around his waist pulling him closer. Harry moaned as Draco inserted the tongue . He clutched onto Draco's hair for his dear life because he was having a feeling that his heart will burst with all the feelings he was feeling right now.
"Master not here , master left in the morning and did not come back young master Malfoy" exclaimed Kreacher . Draco slumped down on the nearest chair and cursed himself inwardly . He was being unreasonable and a bloody twat . But what could he do . What if Harry had seen the snake . What if he figured out who it was because he knew Granger is working on the blood curse. Harry is an exceptionally experienced auror and also the most powerful wizard . He knows   very soon his secret will be be out . What if Harry hates him after he will discover who Draco kept in his basement.  Will he ever understand what Astoria was to Draco? Will he?
Oh!yes Draco had nightmares. His father used to cast crucio now and then there was that snake like lunatic and his hideous snake roaming all over the manor and made his base of operation. His main base of operation to be exact. And sometimes Draco saw the snake like man whispering something to the snake like they were making some plans . Plans to already destroy whatever small left in Draco's life .
They looked around for the snake but they saw just a huge pile of ashes . "What happened with to the snake" asked Harry .
The atmosphere of the room shifted as two first year Slytherin entered. Both the aurors were following them stealthily.
Harry said thank you and  said everything to Hermione without leaving a single detail. Hermione hummed while listening .
"Okay anyway we need to talk with you guys can you bring two Hufflepuffs and two Ravenclaw during the supper? We will be waiting for you there in the great hall." Harry asked them politely.
"Al if you blush more ....  There will be no difference in between your face and a tomato" joked Scorpius .
"I think we have to go back to Hogwarts. We need to open the chamber and talk with some of the students ." Draco said smiling back
Then life happened . Harry quit his eighth year and started to take the auror  training . He got engaged to Ginny Weasley . Ron and Hermione his best pals , his constant companions got married . He was so happy for them .
Curious who Ana was Draco peered down. To his astonishment he saw an ashwinder slithering towards him .
Draco was working in his potion lab . He always carried small vials of portion when ever he went on an assignment. It helps . Once Draco was working in a jungle in search of a death-eater with one of his American- Auror Partner. While chasing the death eater a king-cobra bit his partner. Thank god he had his anti-venom potion with him . It saved his Partner's life . After that many incidents happed were Draco's potion excellency saved life,cured injuries  while working in the field. That's one of the reason Draco was a renowned Auror in America.
The flat was super posh . The touch of elegance can be seen everywhere. Everything is well organized. Nothing is out of its place . Indeed the place feel like Draco's.
"Malfoy are you out of your mind? He will be handicapped for the rest of his life . He can't ever  an auror!
One day Harry lost his way in the Manor because it's so bloody huge and by mistake went in the basement. The basement of the Manor was eerie quite . With no lights. There were prison cells which gave Harry shivers . The place smelled odd . Harry stumbles upon something and when he casted a lumos he was a shedded snake's skin . It wasn't as big as the basilisk's though . He was about to go further to investigate when he heard his name . Draco calling him . Harry with giving a last lingering glance at the celler followed the sound of Draco's panicky shouts . He found Draco in the entrance of the basement .
"Hey I didn't make it up okay! The sorting hat sorted me in Slytherin first but I asked it to place me in Gryffindor"
" Can I take you to the manor . No don't worry we redecorated it. I didn't want Scorpius to live his life in that hell"
I wrote harry and albus's conversation like it was in the book . That's an iconic and one of my most favourite quotes so i couldn't just stop myself from writing . I had to bring draco in the place of Ginny because this is  a drarry fan fiction. I had no intentions to  alter the essence . I hope you will understand . Thank you for reading .
"Good evening Draco. Mister Potter what a surprise. Thank you for coming to the Manor . We are forever indebted to you.
Harry thought a shower might work as he found the bathroom . He showered and wanked himself obviously because of Malfoy and his sodding perfect arse with some sort of tattoo which makes his arse hotter than ever.
Well back to the business as I told you before that I had a meeting with your teachers and came to the conclusion that an invisible tracking device have to be placed. It will not only track your whereabouts but also has anti bullying system in them . If you are being bullied or being the bully this device will trace everything and it will directly alert the head mistress .
Soon they came in front of a door . It had weird curvings on it. The door similar that of the door of the chamber of secrets.
"Are you two done? I am the head auror . And I am the decision maker here . You are supposed to take orders  . If you don't want to work with eachother then Malfoy you can return back to America . And potter you can stay in your house. You two are dismissed.
"Stop lying to me Harry James Potter . But I want to warn you to be careful okay! I am happy for you and I can see he makes you happy ." Harry smiled warmly at his friend.
"Yes! I guess. I mean I have seen people die . People I love. After the battle I thought I won't lose any . You know, Kingsley became my father figure after every one died .... Today I thought I will lose him ....Harry's voice broke"
"Well Harry , I am sorry . I didn't mean to snap at you . You know . It's my bad . I am indeed sorry . I don't want us to end. Oh! God please don't say you wanna breakup"
"Yes I am Fine I guess..uh ..  thank you for asking I will now head back to my work .. Tons of paperwork You know" with this Harry hurried towards his cabin. Giving Kingsley no opportunity to ask him any further questions.
" Mr Potter some days back Amos Diggory visited here, he tried to hex James , and he was screaming that Potter killed my son . I will kill Harry Potter. James looks like you Sir, you see but ofcourse without the glasses. As he is in fifth year , maybe .. it triggered Diggory more.  You should really ask James to be careful." Scorpius filled in with information.
"Harry I think the person is trying to make this potion but failing constantly firstly the person is not getting nagini's venom . But about your blood Harry. Its easy because either James or Albus's blood can be used because they have your blood . I think this person will try something extremes now."
He met Draco after ages and still the git didn't even change ... Even a bit . But Malfoy was so beautiful in there even his face which was full of disgust... So  handsome.... Wait what the fuck is he thinking? Has he gone completely mad? Harry groaned inwardly.
"There was she told me there was another snake but it vanished as soon as it sensed Ana's presence. I thing there was some ward around the snake ." Harry said.
Amidst of everything Harry had one lingering question in his mind which he can't just not forget and above all  which he wanted to ask Draco "Why did he not say to Bellatrix that he was Harry Potter. What stopped him from saying. Why he had saved  Ron Hermione and specially Him from the manor that day .
And then they looked into each other's eyes.  God Malfoy had such intense beautiful silver eyes. It makes Harry breathless.
"Yes I was about to suggest you gentlemen that,   off you go now I have tons of paperworks" Hermione exclaimed with a sigh .
Draco tried explaining but then he thought it will be a waste of time since he was too much tongue-tied . Instead he practically jumped onto Potter and captured his lips .
As they existed the dorm Harry said "we need to do something about the bullies. I hated those kids for making our kids suffer. Why the fuck you ain't talking? Why are you so awfully quiet?"
"To some extent yes Harry , because Draco never invited anyone in the funeral only his mother and his son was there ."
"Can you just shut up Malfoy." Harry exclaimed irritatingly " I told you  I am sorry. I didn't bumped into you intentionally so if you are done with cursing, sneering and what not please excuse me I too have some important stuffs to attend " with this Harry walked away.
"It's fine Draco . I am fine . " Draco hugged him tightly and uttered "I will kill them". "No you won't do anything of that sort . Promise me you won't" . "Calm down Draco you will break all the window panes. Please . Saying this Harry hugged him tighter .
"Kingsley I am so sorry there were stuffs I was preoccupied with them . Specially in my house with ... Nevermind"
"Well I believe if she is alive then she is not an human. She is definitely a living snake . Like Nagini . And Harry do you understand what that means? If one gets the venom of Astoria if she is alive then"
"Yeah in Dumbledore's memories. May be I am overthinking. Though I think I will do sone research about that girl. I spoke to James about the attack he said Amios was not in his senses it was as if someone is controlling him , as if someone had casted an imperious curse on him."
"That's my son Potter. He name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. He is a better person than I was Potter ."
"Before you say anything Potter ... I didn't purposefully should you that time . I was angry and I forgot to turn it one more time. You think ...
While Harry was talking with the giant snake Draco saw there is a small enchanted door just behind the pillar they just walked pass. Leaving Harry with the snake because there was no point listening to them and its more pointless to decipher what they were talking and ofcourse Draco didn't wanted to interrupt Harry and ask him what was the bloody meaning of every word  after each and every sentence. Moreover parseltongue creeps Draco out . Voldemort used to talk with Nagini like this and he always feared he was either planning to kill him or harm any of his family members.  So Draco slowly left Harry's side to examine the door . The door was a normal except there was beautiful carvings on it. Draco had seen these carvings somewhere . He did read about these but he couldn't remember where . Draco stepped forward because he wanted Harry to see this maybe Harry could remember something  but to his horror  he saw the big snake was slithering towards Harry and was opening one of his big giant mouth to engulf Harry . Cursing himself for leaving Harry's side   Draco ran towards Harry without a second thought pointing the wand at the snake and screaming "avada kedavra".  The big snake fell dead instantly . No one can harm Harry , his Potter and with this thought he crushed his lips with Harry's.
"Papaaaa" Harry heard Scorpius's voice and saw a very young version of Scorpius  coming and hugging the scene Draco . The scene Draco smiled at Scorpius affectionately . "It that for mother?"
His office was so clean . Everything organized. The files are stacked properly in the cabinet in alphabetical order . There are two tables . The wallpapers are being changed to light blue . Earlier it was a horrible shade of orange. Even the pens on their tables are properly arranged . The photograph of Ron, Hermione and his was cleaned even the other photos of his parents and a photograph of his Ginny and their three kids were cleaned and was properly kept . Harry thought the cabin looked more lively now .
"I am not thrilled about this idea too by the way Malfoy . And I too can't work with someone who has no respect for me. Sorry Kingsley I can't work with this git"
"Calm down Harry. He is not that bad . He is an accomplished auror . You two have a history I know . But Harry there are cases which needs to be solved. You see the map of England behind me . If you see the map closely you will see some places are marked as "X" . These are the places which still holds some evil complex magic which were casted by Voldemort . These spells are so strong that no ordinary wizard can come out of these places alive. Many found dead near these spots specially Muggles. I had tried to send some of the experienced aurors to investigate some died some are barely alive and fighting for their lives in St Mungo's. As you know Malfoy was a death-eater he knows many complex spells advanced dark arts. Look Harry I know Malfoy can be on the nerves but we need him. He knows many things about Voldemort that we don't because Voldemort used to stay in the manor. Try to cooperate with eachother. Atleast for the wellbeing of the our people. Please Harry
"Whatever ... and look who is here with us . Blonde hair , grey eyes ... Expensive robes you must be the son of that death-eater ..Draco Malfoy . How did you even have the courage to come here back ...in Hogwarts? Tell me how does your father afford living? Is he a whore ?
Later Harry joined Draco in the breakfast table. As soon as Harry sat on the table Draco could smell the chocolate bodywash . His freaking favourite bodywash of all time. It makes Potter more edible than ever .
Draco cut him off and said" yes ofcourse you moron  I like you . Look what you did to my hair." Draco wanted to sneer but he failed miserably and Harry got a expression between a sneer and a smile.
Draco and Narcissa really did give a make over. The manor was more lively. The ugly portraits were gone." The wallpapers were vibrant . The manor was humming with positive magic .
As Draco was leaving the room Harry realised Draco's trousers are hunging low and Harry could see Draco's perfect arse. And wait oh my god is that a tattoo!
Harry heard Voldemort whispering something to Nagini something in parseltongue. He pointed his fingers towards Harry's right and Harry turned his head towards the direction of the pointed finger and saw Sirius. The snake started slithering towards him. Harry screamed and screamed begged Voldemort to stop.
Draco didn't reply  Harry , he rolled his eyes  and he took off his waist coat .  Then he took out a beautiful round object , from his breast pocket . He sighed again, and came and kneeled down in front of Harry .
"Runespoor are magical creatures Potter and this was cursed one because we all know everything of Dark ". Harry looked at him with piercing glare "okay Voldemort's" Harry smiled "is cursed , so after you kill or destroy any of his things they turns into ash and ...
"She said you love when i speak Parseltongue . It's makes you hard. "Harry said as he traced Draco's hard length with his index finger . "She could smell your arousal ."
"Well mate agreed. I need to head towards the joke shop. George is alone there . He is so lost since we lost Fred anyway bye mate bye mione" Ron kissed Hermione's cheeks and left
"Ron no! Ofcourse not . Its not me and Ginny now . We are parents  and it isn't a rash decision. I can't take it anymore. Its too much .  Ron I am sorry . I know Ginny is your sister . I just can't help it. Its okay if you don't want to talk with me for some while"
"You ah wish" Draco said because he was consumed with lust . Potter's mouth was now on him . Sucking him gently as he plays with his ball with his free hand. Harry is exceptionally well in blowing his cock and blowing his mind away . Draco saw Harry's red plump lips around his cock . He moaned when Harry licked his slit . Harry's mouth is hot around him . Draco knows very well that he won't last long . He held Harry by his hair and fucked his mouth . And very soon he could feel his ball twitch and within seconds he was coming inside Harry's mouth . And like always Potter dirty Potter drank him . There was some come smeared on his lips . He locked his eyes with Draco and licked his lips .
Harry is currently in St Mungo's . He came here to check upon Kingsley. Upon coming here he saw St Mungo's nearly bursting with people all came here to visit Kingsley . The security guards were really having a hard time in controlling the crowd . He saw many familiar faces.  Everyone either smiled or waved at him . He obviously returned the gesture.  Harry's eyes were scanning the crowd until it rested on Malfoy.  As soon as Malfoy caught Harry staring at him . He began to walk towards him.
Draco took out a small box and chanted a spell within seconds the small box turned into a big box of various chocolates.
"Look Grang... Hermione I am so sorry. I know I was an asshole to you I am sorry . I was jealous of your intelligence . My father used to use stinging jinxes on me because you were our batch topper . "Draco looked up and looked straight into Hermione's eyes. "I am sorry Hermione."
Harry huffed as he returned the offending present into his drawer. Why did his partner have to give him lube? He would have a
"Of course. We've been together since we signed the contract. We bloody have the same law firm and public relations agency. We even gift Christmas presents together. Even Ron and Hermione don't do that."
Draco stared at him in shock as he processed the information. "I appreciate the gift but I don't want you to be unhappy," he said quietly as he retrieved the letter that he had unintentionally crumpled, smoothing it carefully with his hands.
I apologise for doubting, that was rude of me. Please don't apologise about my clothes anymore. I think we can both agree that you have more than compensated by agreeing to take me on a shopping trip, for a full day, no less!
“And I know that it was creepy of me to watch you open your gift while pretending that I didn’t know anything, but I
"Don't," Harry said when Draco pulled out a fresh pair of pants. He looked at Harry with furrowed brows. "It's easier access without pants," Harry explained.
Rounding the four poster bed, Harry reached to pull Draco's glasses off guiltily, pausing when he noticed the bump at Draco's abdomen. The button of Draco's suit had come undone, and Draco had a belly.
It was close to ten when they returned to castle, heading for the Hufflepuff common room. Draco ached all over from a brutal set of five Seeker games with Harry. The sky had gone dark by the end of the fourth set, but in trademark stubbornness, they had decided to continue with their last match to determine their respective superiority.
"Because a kiss on the cheek between friends is so normal. You want Potter so much that you can't control yourself, but in the next moment you're occupied with being a martyr, and you push him away because Saint Potter can't be with a Malfoy, and because Draco doesn't deserve anything. Let me tell you this just because we're friends, Draco. One day you'll look around, and you'll realize that you're bitter and alone, and begging at the feet of everyone." She sneered at him, her expression hard.
"Second present?" Harry repeated in confusion, looking up from his shoes. Harry had gathered all of his willpower to sit through Potions with Malfoy, and now that it was over, he was back to obsessing about Malfoy's familial obligations post-war.
Harry nodded vigorously as he looked down the Gryffindor table in warning. Ron had shared that the Headmistress was still investigating the case to gather more information. Walters had been suspended, while the other students had been put on probation for the time being. The prefect also had her badge stripped.
"I'm not flirting!" Malfoy flailed, grabbing onto the table when he nearly fell off his high stool. Harry steadied him by the arm. "Thanks," he mumbled with flushed cheeks before glaring at his friends.
"Fine," Draco finally sniffed as he dusted the front of his poncey waistcoat. Even his casual wardrobe screamed old money.
Both Harry and Ron jumped, Harry drawing a line across the rude note he was crafting for Malfoy. Hermione had made that joke a few times throughout the years, but the dryness of her delivery had always ensured that it landed well.
“No!” Draco yelled as he pushed his wrist away, “don’t,” he continued, crying harder when Harry frowned at him in confusion. “Please, don’t,” he blubbered when Harry made to swipe them off the bed. Harry instead lifted and set them to his bedside table in frustration as he held Draco tightly.
“Maybe you shouldn’t pair with Hermione for projects. It’d be easier to see who’s smarter if your results weren’t tied to one another’s.”
The girls looked immediately devastated at the thought of upsetting their saviour. "We just wanted to cheer him up!" Vinegar girl suddenly burst out in defence.
"Bought it off my mother's jeweller in fourth year," Draco grinned proudly. "He was initially reluctant to let it go because he had paid a tidy sum for it. I offered him double just for the satisfaction of depriving you." He shrugged. "It just seems so silly now, you know?"
"Did I interrupt anything?" He asked Zabini, whom he privately considered to be the friendliest amongst Malfoy and his friends.
"Where is Harry then?" Draco asked as he returned to the checkout counter, simultaneously greeting his colleagues in the hallway with a nod of his head.
Draco was biting his lips as he looked at him. He suddenly leaned in to press his lips against Harry's. "You're cute," he said evenly with a small smile when he pulled away.
"And deprive people of the excitement?" Hermione said as she handed the Marauders' Map to Harry with a tilt of her head in the direction back to their dormitories. "Let's go."
"Draco's hair is a bit darker," Harry piped in, lifting a crayon and holding it before Draco's face. "Not too dark though, sort of silver and spun—" he broke off to an inaudible mumble with a slight frown. After a pulse of magic, the green crayon immediately transformed to the exact shade of Draco's pale hair. Draco pressed his thighs together as he felt his bottom clench, refusing to outwardly react to the nonchalant wandless and wordless. Trust Potter to casually display his prowess so.
His ability to plod along had been his strength when he was younger, but it was now his burden. While he could continue as it was, it would make him unhappy. However, he didn’t know where to begin if he wanted to make changes. What if he regained his memories and hated the new life that he had made for himself?
“So Ron and Hermione also rigged the exchange for me to draw your name,” he said quickly when Draco looked at him in confusion for handing him the unopened gift from Ron.
"Save those excuses for Gandie," Draco smirked before holding Teddy's hand as they crossed the road. As he did previously, Potter held onto Teddy's other hand.
"No, Potter. Wait," Malfoy sobered quickly as he caught him by the arm. "Sorry, I just thought that you were thinking too highly of me."
Harry grinned when Malfoy slapped Blaise's hand as he reached over to pull the strings attached to the bells on his jumper.
tiny cookie, because Happy is cooking spaghetti for dinner. It would have been terrible if you were too full to have spaghetti, wouldn't it?"  Draco said as he set him down.
"Expelliarmus! Petrificius totalus!" Ron yelled as he brutally stunned multiple students mercilessly while Hermione sent jelly leg jinxes at the students attempting to escape.
An amused smile crossed her lips as she lifted his leg to tip him onto his back once more. "Draco never forgets," she laughed at Harry's incredulous expression. "Apparently the Prophet misses you, and he had complains about that."
Checking that the corridor was clear, Draco pointed his middle finger at the man, pleased at the bluster that he received for his efforts. “Mind your own bloody business,” he added for good measure as he shook his fist warningly.
Harry snorted at the understatement. Harry had never heard of a revealing as violent as his own. Ron's soulmark had set in through a week long itch, the skin on his knee giving way to reveal the first words a younger Hermione had spoken to him on the Hogwarts train.
Malfoy–no, Draco–seemed torn between exasperation and glee but the latter finally won out as he laughed with Ron and Hermione.
"Draco, please," he begged, gasping when he felt Draco's hand over his briefs–the furthest that they had gone. Harry summoned the lube wandlessly and he reached into Draco's underwear to slick the warm length of Draco's cock.
"This is where I get flowers for Mother," Draco gestured at a quaint little shop with cursive letterings on its windows.
The muscle in Malfoy's cheek jumped in amusement as he waved his satchel away. Harry smiled to himself. The years of Malfoy-watching had been unbelievably handy as he tried to decipher the gestures of a waifish Malfoy. He wondered if he could ever make Malfoy happier, or at least, comfortable around him.
“Then I saw the ink stain on one of your wrappers, and it all fell in place. Who cares enough about Harry, benefitted from his gift, thinks that mundane everyday gifts are appropriate, has a terrible sense of humour and is messy?” He wiggled the fingers that he had counted off, raising his brows airily as if welcoming challenge.
Except he didn't even know why he wanted to see Potter so badly. Sure, Potter was fun, but so was Pansy, if you could take the acerbic humor. Sure, Potter was sexy, but so was Blaise, especially when he dialled his charm up to eleven. Maybe it was the effortlessness of Potter? The careless intensity of the man was pretty nice. Or maybe because Potter was a mix of both his best friends. Thinking about it always left Draco incredibly confused, which contributed to his avoidance of the matter entirely.
The morning had left Harry overcome with sympathy towards Malfoy again. If Malfoy had failed Lucius on his expectations as a successful Death Eater, would he attempt to redeem himself by settling with a Pureblood wife? Most importantly, how could Ron tell that Malfoy looked gay?
"Of course I can. I'm Harry Potter," Harry said wryly as he leaned in for another kiss. "Read the papers when I'm gone," he said casually with a jaunty wave.
Harry was leaden as he fell onto his dining chair. He had lost more than six years—no, he had lost six years and five months, and even when Draco was by his side, his future was slipping by. No wonder Draco had been uncompromising about his request. Draco had been thinking about his family, and his child, while Harry had been thinking about himself.
“I think so. Maybe they were embarrassed about this. I mean it’s a little weird. Who cares about someone else’s sleep?” He shrugged as he flicked the note out of his hand carelessly.
"Fine, Andy, gardening, Teddy metamorphmagus..." the Chosen One leaned over he glanced through Draco's letter. “There's nothing much that your mom needs to do to impress Teddy, you know?" Potter tapped at Draco's last sentence. "He's still a wee baby with diapers and too much drool."
Despite Weasley's expansion charm, they were still seated too close for comfort. His thigh was pressed flush against Harry’s while Neville shared his resolution to find a suitable replacement for the late Trevor by March. Harry elbowed Draco in the side when he began to snigger under his breath.
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, huffing in amusement, the corner of her mouth lifted in a sardonic smile. "Don't worry, I'll leave them alone from now on. I don't know what came over me, honestly," she said, shuddering as she drew her cloak closer around herself.
"Just the notebook and my Beautification potions essay? And writing materials, of course. And the anti-frizz serum. Are you sure you can come back? You can't pop in and out of St Mungo's, you know?"
Draco rolled his eyes as he waved his work robes to the clothes hamper in the corner. "Of course, I do. Does she want it, though?" He turned to tease Harry, heart jumping at the intensity of Harry's eyes that were trained on him. He quickly faced his cupboards once more. "Like what you see?" he asked with false casualness as he continued to take off his clothes, heedless of Harry's presence.
As you know, Muggle clothes cannot be expanded. I am aware that you are a busy man, but I also know that you will get a
"To Draco," the tables returned as they clinked their drinks heartily. Sitting down after reaching across the table to meet Neville's steady glass, Draco kicked Blaise's foot sharply.
Harry scratched his head sheepishly. Andromeda had said the same when he had left her house a week ago, and the comment still made him uncomfortable. He wanted to be dependable, but the idea that he was so stagnant scared him. He felt like all of his friends had made strides in both their careers and personal lives. While he had done okay for himself in the first, he was stuck with the latter.
Harry read the gold letterings for a bit before pretending to give up in disinterest. He counted the vials instead, “that’s a lot of bottles for one present. Does it have a note?”
"The post-war wizarding community has been marked by an avant-garde movement though. Generally, it's an overcompensation for our run in with fascism, but for the younger generation it's more than just a gesture." Blaise wiggled his brows suggestively at Draco. "McG would totally screw tradition to give the kids the interhouse unity they want."
“Draco!” Harry called out, running to hide behind him in laughter, leading Ginevra’s snowstorm to both of them. Draco waved the spell off in fond amusement, threatening her with a rain cloud and smirking when she gestured rudely at him.
“We’re not–” he broke off as he glanced furtively at Draco. “We haven’t talked about it yet,” he glared at Ron to convey his annoyance. They had been over this multiple times, and Ron’s clumsy meddling was only making things harder for him. He could already feel Draco's nervousness rolling off in waves.
When he finally poured the second batch of tea into the cups he had set out, it suddenly struck him that it could be his tester’s fault. Setting his teapot down carefully, Draco rushed towards his dressing room for a change of clothes. He tried to manage his expectations, but it was impossible—he had only started using pearl powder as a catalyst a month ago when his arrangement with Harry had started, and if it wasn’t his catalyst, then it was obviously his tester. Harry was the anomalous case every magical theorist speculated about in their essay conclusion—he had bloody lived through two AKs through sheer pig-headedness, and instead of being wary, Draco had so merrily taken up the offer for him to be his tester.
Harry read the note lazily. Draco and him had gone for a walk on the grounds in a fit of insanity a few days ago, and he had noticed that the Great Lake had frozen over. It had been ages since he had last skated, and he still had fond memories of the break they had between Quirrell and Snape's antics. Hoping that Draco would be able to have fun with his friends, he had asked Hermione for the spell she had previously used for their shoes.
Malfoy slowly lifted the tape from the wrapping paper as he sat on the edge of his bed. His brows raised when a mound of hair accessories fell out together with a note that Harry had carefully cut–neat perpendicular lines and all–to throw Malfoy's scent off.
Casting a discreet Tempus when he noticed some of the crowds dispersing, Draco sighed when he saw that it was a little after ten. "I think that we've just missed the ten o'clock light show," he mumbled to himself in disappointment, yelping when he received a sharp jab to his side.
"Pans, we can talk this through," Ron said when Pansy looked at him, his shoulders loosening as a friendly smile spread across Pansy's lips.
“Do you prefer French cuisine?” Harry mused, his voice airy as if his mind was already somewhere else.
Draco rolled his eyes and he flicked his own wand—it was an argument that they had had multiple times. Harry would always be swept away by a note and miss the rest, including any relevant updates to the initial note. With the majority of the Aurors' cases being pressed for time, the indiscriminate amount of memos that piled up was an efficiency gap that magnified itself in the Auror department.
Sitting through the Headmistress' reminder of the upcoming reveals for the gift exchange, Harry found himself worrying about Malfoy's response to the discovery that Harry was his gift partner. They had gotten closer after the incident with Walters, but what if Malfoy got mad about how Harry had watched him open all of his presents? It was undeniably creepy, but Ron had been right to say that Harry had always been uncomfortably obsessed about Malfoy. There really was no way to deny anything. He pressed the back of his palms hands to his eyes as he groaned to himself.
"I've genuinely never noticed," he frowned as he stroked his chin. "That's astute," he complimented Hermione evenly, "Harry, I'll protect you on Wednesday. Harry, Harry. Harry," he repeated as if testing it for a fit. He nodded after a while before looking expectantly at him.
Draco shrugged as he looked at Blaise. "Nobody, I think. Pansy will be working, Theo isn't going, and you guys all have plus ones." He looked at the small turnout around the table.
"It's sexier if you don't. I'll spend the whole night thinking about how deviant you are. Deviant and sexy! Emphasis on the sexy!" Harry quickly backtracked when Draco's mouth fell open in disbelief.
"Your hair's a mess," Malfoy said when he finally unwrapped the present, rougher and clumsier than usual.
"That's cheating. You're supposed to make alliterations with the noun," Malfoy complained after rolling and then swallowing his whiskey.
Stumbling onto his feet in the common room, Draco was grateful that Harry had retired for the night instead of waiting up for him as he usually did. He would have been openly maudlin about Potter's virtuousness and that would have led to nothing good, he sighed as he fumbled for his potions stash in the dark. Downing his sobering potion, Draco was overcome by the sudden wash of fatigue. He was too tired to even put on his pyjamas after pulling off his clothes. He folded his clothes sloppily and burrowed under his covers, promising himself to rectify it first thing in the morning.
"Would Sneezy and Worry like to follow me to Hogwarts?" Draco asked thickly when he reached the end of the letter, scaring a bit when Worry materialised behind Sneezy, eyes shiny with unshed tears.
Draco shook the other man in frustration. "I'll kill you one day and it'll be completely justified."
Harry felt his shoulders slump, recognising a lost cause when he saw one. Malfoy had withdrawn into his shell and there was no way Harry could draw him out, short of starting a fight.
"Secondly, to also beat Harry in a Seeker's Match before I graduate," he stated, rolling his eyes at Harry's incredulous scoff.
"Well, probably not an expert. But you always talk about inefficiencies, and after seeing you at work, I think that
The dares progressively got raunchier as everyone started to get more intoxicated. Malfoy screeched, falling into laughter in his lap when Parkinson was dared to fondle Hermione's breasts.
The Prophet previously covered that Draco Malfoy was auditing the Aurors as part of his mind-numbingly boring job in the Ministry's Workplace Efficiency and Extraordinary Productivity (WEEP) department. According to sources, the heir to the Malfoy's fortunes has submitted his report on workplace improvements to the Head Auror, Gawain Robards, two weeks into his attachment. WEEP reports directly to the Minister for Magic.
It was much later when they apparated to Parc du Champ de Mars with their desserts to go. Between petty squabbles, stories about Teddy and their respective careers, dinner had been an unintentionally drawn out affair. When Draco had finally noted the time, he had suggested they skip desserts to visit the Eiffel Tower. Remembering that they had arranged to return in November with Teddy and Family during the off season of Quidditch, Harry had suggested to postpone the visit. Feeling guilty, Draco had proposed to visit the lawn before the Eiffel Tower to watch the light show in compensation.
"I think so," Malfoy said when he finally set the note aside, brow raising when Harry quickly freshened the fabric.
"I'm going for a shower," Draco said as he dumped their clothes into their hamper. "I need to look good while committing murder," he mumbled, items in hand as he headed for the door. "Are you coming?"
" he insisted between tears, shaking his head against the curve of Narcissa's neck as he clutched onto the soft linen of her dress.
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter are standing beside each other. Dressed in a light pink and gold metallic finish flower print Muggle cut suit, Draco Malfoy's combover is artfully tousled. Harry Potter is dressed in a dark green velvet Muggle cut double breasted suit with shifting gold embroidery of wood nymphs from his right lapel to over his collar. His hair is in a neat low bun, his famous scar uncovered with a single loose strand falling from the top of his head. Harry Potter looks hesitant, leaning closer to Draco Malfoy, who is standing straight as he smirks into the camera, hands in his pockets
"Since we're already here, we could pack a set of clothes and your WEEPing robes? Or I could swing back before meeting you here if you would rather your house."
"You're going to shower without opening it?" Harry asked in disbelief. "I can't believe it! Malfoy, this is serious! I
"We had a fun time today, you know. It'd be nice to go up against you again, Malfoy." Potter continued lazily with his eyes closed.
Harry stared at the mark in disbelief. While the revealing and position of marks always varied depending on the nature of the couple, almost all marks were black. Red soulmarks were a marker of a couple's intensity, and he had only read about them in works of fiction.
“It’s supposed to work the other way, Harry. You’re the client. I’m the contractor—” he broke off into an appreciative moan around the forkful of dark chocolate lavender tart. Sighing to himself, Malfoy frowned when he couldn’t get another portion to balance on his fork.
It was probably of note that kisses from one Harry Potter could distract Draco Malfoy from his dessert(s).
–he had been so frightened that he would scare Draco away then, but they were so much closer now. In fact, he was instead worried that he would be lost without Draco over the holidays. As much as he loved Hermione and Ron, he did not look forward to being left out as they spent time being affectionate during the festive season.
"I'll be going. Ginny's calling for me," she said, her voice bright. Draco swallowed at the look he received before she skipped away.
Harry batted his hands away as he held them loosely in his. "Just vocalising my thoughts, love. So am I good enough? Am I able to replace an extra-extra-extra—" Harry made an exaggerated, winded noise when Draco shoved at his abdomen. Harry smiled at him lazily as he extracted himself to pull the covers over them with a loud sigh.
He had spent breakfast feigning a headache as he mulled over Lucius' last words to Malfoy. Not only did it imply that Lucius was unrepentant, he was also misguided to attribute the Death Eaters' loss entirely to his son. Surely a regiment whose success hinged upon a single lackey would be doomed to fail. Besides, Voldemort really should have placed more weight on the backing from Harry's friends and the sheer amount of dumb luck he had.
"Ah, now it's just like your hair too!" Potter beamed as he handed the crayon over to his ecstatic godson.
"Well, you can always be the obnoxious one. It comes so naturally to you," Draco tried to remove his hand again when the waiter arrived with their dessert. "Are we really going to be the couple that has to hold hands even during meals?" He asked when the waiter left.
Towards the end, Harry had to beg Hermione to request for his counsel after fictitious arguments with Ron, or he would pretend that he suddenly had very active bowels–just so that he could research and correspond for Draco's gifts. It drove him spare to learn that he had experienced all that trouble because Draco wanted to feel
Picking up the booklet in search of an explanation, Draco paused at the title—"Love and Desire: The Cupid Manual".
” he repeated in disbelief, his head tilted upwards in recollection. “I just thought that you were too busy to reply. The accident was all over the papers but I didn’t know that it was so serious.”
He pulled his classroom door open gingerly. The coast was clear. He peered around the corner before tapping the bricks hurriedly, throwing himself in, flying down the stairs, and back to his rooms.
The entrance to his new dorm was both a logistical nightmare and a psychological impediment, Draco wrote in his letter to Pansy as he sat at the Slytherin table waiting for Blaise's arrival. He had left the dormitories early in the morning of the first day of classes, and the Great Hall was still sparse.
Stopping when they reached the apparition point, Draco rolled his eyes before reaching for Potter's shoulder, quickly cataloguing the muscles under his arm before apparating near their lunch place.
“Do you have time for a seat? This is too much,” Harry said earnestly as he pulled a chair up to their table.
The conversation had dissolved to smaller ones again when Harry elbowed him in the rib. "What did Pansy do?"
As the night wound down from the drinking games that Draco had steadfastly stayed out of, Draco was whispering with Pansy who was seated on Blaise's lap.
Desperate for something to occupy his hands, he slid down the golden arrow that he had hidden in his sleeves, a reminder of his quota. Despite the pressure and the anxiety that came with it, the magical energy in the tool had come to be a familiar comfort. He had taken to play with them whenever he was alone, musing that he would use it whenever it struck him, but he had never been able to.
The two days had passed in a haze of great self-loathing until a barn owl had appeared with a partially completed application form that the headmistress had somehow acquired. As if understanding his predicament, she had filled in the form with a positive slant on his academic accomplishments and character. It was also complete with references from herself and Professor Vector.
"Yes, Potter. It's not so hard, is it?" Malfoy said with obvious impatience as he sent rolls of parchment to their respective trays labelled according to the subjects.
Draco felt his brows twitch as he tried to process Potter's words. His face was heating up as his stomach contracted. He knew that it was his fight or flight instincts kicking in, diverting blood away from his digestive system, preparing for him to react physically, but Draco simply couldn't move his limbs as he watched Potter move to kneel on his knees. Had Potter implied that he was interested in him? Potter was closing the distance between them, his hand slowly reaching over to cup his face. The image before him was exactly like some of the idle thoughts Draco would have in his shower chamber. Only that Potter would usually be dressed in considerably less. This was surely a dream. A product of his prolonged celibacy where his wank fantasy was making him dream about his wank fantasy being his wank fantasy.
"I wanted to give you a surprise. This is my third gift for you," he smiled widely at Draco, his heart full from making his lover so happy.
Draco shook his head without reply as he tried to focus on his letter. In its entirety, the school year had been a lot better than he had initially expected.
Even though it was clear that Robards was skeptical of WEEP's efficacy, Draco was grateful that the man had assigned Harry as his counterpart. The clout Harry yielded had been helpful in getting people to talk to him. Beginning with the poor layout of the office, Draco's report had continued with the induction of new Aurors on the administrative aspects, the unwieldy forms, and the filing process of reports. Despite having sat in the Aurors for more than a week, Draco was still finding areas of improvement—or WEEPables, as Fawley liked to call it—daily.
Thank you for your CV expressing interest in teaching in Hogwarts. Coincidentally, we currently have an opening for DADA as Fawley has decided to start a museum for his vast collection of teaspoons. I had hesitated to contact you, seeing that you seemed so partial to travelling.
"Sorry, but we're running a bit low on that this year. Maybe next year?" Ron joked as he squeezed Hermione's hand from across the table. Harry averted his eyes politely when they started to look at each other affectionately.
“Hey,” Harry greeted, pausing momentarily as he looked at the small space between Draco and Smith. It didn’t seem to matter to him though, dropping into the seat with a careless shrug while Draco scooted towards the armrest. Harry apologized to Smith with his usual sincerity for the squeeze.
Draco rolled his eyes long and hard for good measure. "I'll kill you with my bare hands one day, Potter."
“Are you okay?” Harry asked as he got onto his knees in a swift motion. “What happened?” He shifted closer, shocked when Draco’s face crumpled and the boy was suddenly in tears.
wanted the volunteer placement at the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) for Children. Draco steadied his breath as the queue moved. It had been ages since he had wanted something selfish for himself, and the truth was that he was afraid that he wasn’t good enough, and that the rejection would leave too big a blow on him.
"I get it, you know? But I must say, Potter, unlike everyone else, I was not surprised when I heard that you would be settling down. It gets tiring after a while," Malfoy's smile was crooked.
Draco had lost track of time when Potter suddenly pulled back, pupils blown, hair wild from Draco's fingers. Draco mirrored the dopey smile on Potter's swollen lips. Arm still thrown over Draco's waist, Potter slid off him to lie on the mat.
"No, it's okay. I'll try to be quick. Do you need anything else? Narcissa will come by tomorrow during visiting hours."
"You're an arsehole," Potter scowled when his two feet were back on solid ground. "Just for that, you're going to run across the road with me."
“You didn’t say that you were visiting!” Teddy accused, as he unceremoniously looped his arm around Malfoy’s neck to pull him close. Harry’s eyes widened at Teddy’s irreverence. How familiar were they? Andromeda had not mentioned anything about Malfoy, and Teddy must have seen him recently to know his schedule.
"Not yet," he shook his head as he tried his best to smile at his friends. He had been missing them, but now that they were here, he was reminded once more that they had coupled off and left him behind. He wished that he could stop being bitter about it. "There's still a bit-" he broke off, groaning as he clutched at the sharp pain that suddenly slammed into him, at the left of his skull.
Malfoy’s eyes were wide, his lips in a pout as he considered the suggestion. “I get to choose where we go.”
Hermione made a sharp noise of disapproval, immediately bursting into laughter when a ball of paper collided sharply against Harry's forehead. He bared his teeth threateningly reflexively at Malfoy who was already leaving the Hall his friends.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked as he tried to linger and peer into the shop. "That's not my experience with them."
"Oh, another present!" Draco exclaimed when they finally parted with Hermione and Ron. He sent the spells off as he returned his organiser to his bag.
"I'll probably end up in Hufflepuff," Potter said.They settled into a carriage with Longbottom, who looked distinctly uncomfortable with the hypothesis they were exploring.
"No worries, Parkinson. Just hoping for his Potions genius," Harry said casually as he returned to his bag, wondering if he should pass Malfoy the apple from last week.
"But I'll have to admit that it's a bit distant for us. We're not too fussed about which province the food comes from. We're game as long as it's good," he snickered unapologetically with a careless shrug. Honestly, he cared more about his mother's happiness. With his European lineage, his father had a distinctly European palette and the Chinese lineage in the Blacks had thinned considerably over the generations as they assimilated in Europe. After the incarceration of his father and the renewed relationship with Andromeda, his mother had proved to be a lot more daring in her palette, and she loved Indian food as much as Chinese food.
Harry shook his head with a wry laugh. Draco watched him closely, unsure of what Harry now thought about him.
Draco tried to peer under the table despite the tight squeeze. "Don't play footsie then! Have some bit of decency, Merlin."
Harry huffed. "Ta, Malfoy. You ruined my fun anyway. But you really should see the sort of post I get back home," he made a face at the memory of it. "Why can't everyone be like you?" He bumped his shoulder against Malfoy's in amusement, laughing when Malfoy pushed him away exasperatedly.
"You're the fine arse. Wait till I fuck you stupid," Draco grumbled under his breath as he looked through his closet for a jumper.
"You know, Teddy used to return from your Black holidays chattering about the sights, and Andie would bring exotic souvenirs back and I would wonder how it was. I think that I might have been a little jealous, to be honest? I've always wanted to bring Teddy overseas, too, but you know, me and directions," he shrugged carelessly. "I'm just really happy to be invited. Does this make me an honorary Black now?" Potter continued, as if forgetting that he was Lord Black with the passing of his godfather. Knowing Potter, he probably was unaware, or cared so little about it that he had forgotten about it entirely.
"No, I've tried. I also thought that she would be the most likely to spill, but she didn't. I have no idea what's wrong with him." He nodded in agreement at nothing in particular for image's sake.
“Been a long while. I thought that you had found a new patisserie,” he said jokingly as Teddy set a tray laden with tiny, colourful pastries on the table.
"Very funny, Potter. I'll piss on you for that," Malfoy threatened while shaking in amusement. "Piss on Potter," he said, which nearly made Harry fall over in amusement.
"In my defense, I've been telling him to watch his butt when entering the common room ever since school started," Draco explained as Weasley immediately nodded in understanding. "I figured that it was time for something drastic since he refused to learn."
Draco blinked at the argument that had seemingly sprung out of nowhere. Personally, he had always aspired to be like Michael de Montaigne – a pureblood philosopher similarly famous in the Muggle world – who had retreated from public life and produced his lifework,
Regardless of the guilt that Draco felt, the sight of Potter sneaking forlorn looks at him constantly, too stubborn to end his self-imposed misery, amused him slightly. Potter looking like a miserable puppy left Draco wondering how he had even considered the boy's similarity to Jesus.
"Payback for sixth year," Draco joked wryly, his smirk widening at the look of disbelief on the other man's face.
Draco hiked his bag higher, his mood foul, his lips in a thin line. He nodded stiffly at Madam Pince on his way out of the library. His day had been absolutely rotten, and what he needed was a bit of coddling and heaps of sympathy. He wondered if Pansy would be around for once, or would he have to spend the night alone in the common room? He wanted to put off returning to his bed as long as possible, having spent the previous night obsessively scrutinizing every line in his manual and rereading the letters from his cousin in the hope that it would help. Even if he could resist the urge to do the same today, the blank report that appeared by his pillow was a glaring reminder that he hadn’t done anything about the situation yet.
in Hogwarts. You'll need a troll attack or something," Hermione said as she took a casual sip of her pumpkin juice.
Harry shook his hair out immediately, slightly embarrassed at having it pointed out so politely by Malfoy. It had been almost
"What are you on," Malfoy complained as he pushed Harry away from the doorway, quickly masking his pleasant surprise as he hung up his cloak.
Harry shook his head while helping himself to the grilled chicken. “Probably later,” he said–more like long
"Happy Birthday, Harry," she smiled at him as she squeezed his calf gently. "May the year be filled with health, purpose, love and lightness."
"You should learn to care for your hair," Draco said quietly, following Harry's overgrown fringe and tucking it behind his ear. His hand slid to the nape of Harry's neck.
Harry nearly keeled over in shock when Malfoy laughed—a deep, genuine laughter with crinkly eyes and all—as he leaned backwards into Teddy’s embrace.
Draco gasped. "Potter, have you not noticed the way you look at boys? We used to bet about when you would jump into bed with Diggory and Chang!" He exclaimed as he rubbed his temples in horror. Were Gryffindors all so hopeless? The mental image of Weasley doing things to Hermione in the third floor alcove surfaced. Draco winced to himself. "Potter, by Merlin's staff, you've always been looking at the male models on Blaise's menswear magazines!"
Harry groaned at the woe that was his life. Clutching onto the present, he laid over it on his bed in defeat.
Harry looked at the food that he had already amassed on his plate. “I don’t really think that it’s a problem.”
since the war began, and fuelled by the Muggle concept of parallel universes, he had traced out crucial points where the trajectories of his present and parallel selves had split – his sorting had been one of them.
“Yes,” Harry replied as he looked around the small table, marvelling at the friends past-Harry had made in the six years.
"Ronald!" She slammed her quill down to glare sharply at her boyfriend. Harry groaned at the wordless conversation they were having
“Yeah, Harry’s an Auror.” Harry was smiling as he climbed back into his chair, his hair in a fresh bun.
it one day," Draco said conspiratorially. "Oh, that’s the kebab store owner that likes me. You wouldn’t believe how big they are,” he beamed at Harry.
Harry frowned at the comment. “I hate it when people tell me that,” he said sullenly as they fell into step. “I’m trying very hard to be the Harry that they want but it’s never enough. It’s like this Harry doesn’t matter, you know?”
He had written to his mother asking about the origins of the painting in the Manor, and he had been ashamed about the disappointment when he learned that it had been a Black heirloom. Malfoys had always been unashamedly blatant about their supposed superiority. In contrast, the Blacks had been more discrete, and he had initially believed that he had found a potentially tangible reason for how proud they were of their genealogy—because the Malfoys had supposedly descended from a God, but alas, both sides of his family were simply just horrible people.
"No I'm not," Malfoy snapped. "I have proper Muggle clothes, just so you know. But this is Hogwarts and you're supposed to wear robes."
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he pushed a crumb on his bottom lip into his mouth. “It’s only just after eleven, Potter.”
Harry opened his eyes as he shifted in his bed. He squinted at the blob topped with red hair on his right.
"If you stayed long enough, you probably did. You're a proper wanker," Draco said as he narrowed his eyes at him in consideration.
Harry felt his heart ache from the sheer fondness he was experiencing. He squeezed Draco's hand tightly for want of an outlet to convey his emotions.
Harry laughed when he received a kick to his ankle–he couldn't help but wonder if this was what being free felt like–the infinite possibilities before him, only worrying about when he would next see his significant other, and the impulse to fuck all of his responsibilities and do whatever his brain demanded.
Draco looked around their table in scandalised shock. "Potter, people would think that—" he ran his fingers through his hair, frazzled. "Merlin's pants, Potter. You're lucky that we're in Muggle Paris. The Prophet would have a field day. Imagine having to explain the headline to Weasley." He shuddered involuntarily at the image of Weasley turning as red as his hair in agitation.
"You're N?" He asked in disbelief in reference to the prior correspondence he had with the owner. He knew that Mrs. Malfoy had left for the continent after being acquitted, but to run a bed and breakfast in a remote countryside? He realised that the secrecy was both ways—to not only protect her lodgers but also herself.
“Of course you do! We could have dropped by earlier and had tea together or something. Or we could have gone shopping together. You should see the new seeds that Harry got me. And the Hippogriff pot! Harry, show him,” Teddy waved him over excitedly.
"And I was really shocked, because I've never, you know, bisexual stuff, and then I realised that I've actually liked you for a long while. And I was really afraid because you know, bisexual stuff? And you know, you're you. As in–" he rushed to explain frantically. "We've been friends for a bit now, and I know that you want to redeem the Malfoy name, and you want to do it right, and the lies about you using me gets to you and it made me upset because I'm so selfish and I want you so much, and I would want you even if it made you unhappy about the news, and I just got very sad," Potter said as he wiped the tears in his eyes.
"Hermione, you're scaring Harry," Ron interrupted as he tried to wave the bowls away only for Hermione to slap his hand violently.
Their hypothesis had been proven correct, and Draco had the urge to throw up as it neared his turn. Girl Weasley and Longbottom had been sorted back to Gryffindor, together with Susan Bones, who had previously been a Hufflepuff.
Teddy broke out into a smile as he dropped his menu onto the table with a clatter. "No, I'll get tomato egg noodles!"
"The next time you're doing something questionable like this, you should think about whether I would strangle you when I find out about it. I can't keep giving in just because you're a brat," Harry said seriously when he pulled away.
"Can't believe that you really have my calendar," Harry suddenly said as he moved backwards to look at him. So they were now back on the topic, Draco sighed he clung to Potter, desperate to hide his face in embarrassment.
Teddy nodded solemnly. "Just one tiny cookie," he said as he squirmed in Draco's arms, looking to be released. Worry raised his hands in an 'X' to emphasise that it was untrue.
Harry nodded approvingly at Malfoy's resignation. He had learnt over the years that some things simply couldn't be helped. For example, it was ridiculous to be six weeks ahead of curriculum only to have a peer surpassing you in swottiness anyway.
"Can't," he replied, waving grandly at Ron and Hermione when the exited the library. It was nearing curfew, and he had enlisted his friends' help for their authority and safe passage.
"Yeah, it's the same for me." Potter shrugged, slightly apologetic. "I mean with my parents, you know. And then my aunt being, well, yeah. I just go for whatever sounds fun to me, too."
Harry looked at Malfoy skeptically as he leaned away for safety. "I, erm—but I'm dressed? Nothing's on display," he touched the cuffs that he had rolled above his elbows nervously.
In the wake of Draco Malfoy's incident, I was surprised to be contacted by Harry Potter's public relations team for a private interview with their client.
Draco had spent the past week coming to terms with his hasty decision to return to Hogwarts. He had initially been contented with the idea of independent studies for his NEWTs, comfortable in the prospect of withdrawing from the public eye for a while longer. However, the opportunity to properly redeem himself had been too good to pass up.
Draco pressed his knuckles along his jaw, feeling the bone underneath. After reading a Muggle article on forensic facial reconstruction a few days ago, he had found his thoughts straying to the topic whenever his mind was idle. If he were handed great grandfather Septimus Malfoy's skull, would he be able to identify that he was at least a Malfoy? Draco was simultaneously unsettled yet coolly ambivalent about the inability to do so. Personally, he would be interested in a challenge of such morbid proportions, but alas, his ancestry had the unfortunate effect of making him a bit sick as of late. Regardless, if there was one thing Draco was sure of, it would be his ability to identify Justin Finch-Fletchley from his skull if someone did the world a favour by ridding it of him. After all, Draco had spent more than an hour scrutinising the miserable sod.
Bidding everyone goodbye, including Potter, he buttoned his coat as he stepped out into the night. He sighed to himself as the biting cold stung his cheek. Trust Potter to make things difficult for him. Had things even been this complex with Theo? He trudged towards the castle, refusing to be hopeful, yet foolishly wishing that Potter would give chase.
"Surely it can't be that bad," Malfoy said as he crossed his arms. "Is it a cock ring? A vibrator? No–you can't get a good vibrator with three galleons. A dildo then. No?" He sounded terribly disappointed at the prospect.
"These are new!" He pulled it off and tried to charm the stain off. Pansy crossed her arm, watching him flail about with a distinct air of unconcern.
"Can I tempt you with a bowl of beef noodles, Teddy?" Draco asked politely as his cousin continued to frown at the selection before him.
"Alright Weasley. I'll drop you an owl for that appointment. You wouldn't know what hit you when you put custom dress robes on," Pansy promised the redhead as she patted Draco lightly in acknowledgement. "Off you pop, darlings," she dismissed the Gryffindors after she had gotten her share of smirking at the awestruck Golden Trio. "Gotta send the boyfriend off properly." She tilted her chin in Blaise's direction, waving them off jauntily as the trio said their sincere Gryffindor goodbyes to them.
"I don't know. I've been waiting for you," Harry said as he reached to pull the present at the corner of his bed over.
The manual printed on unnaturally white paper appeared beside his pillow in the eighth year dormitory on an unusually cold morning. Set atop it was a hemp bag that clinked brightly when Draco jostled it.
"Your first Harry Potter themed merchandise," he joked as he gestured Malfoy to throw the present over. He had purchased the socks on a whim while flipping a discarded catalogue in the library. Knowing Malfoy's picky tastes, the quality of the wool had been a great relief.
Don't be an arse. Would chicken tikka masala be good? If yes, you can bring the plain yogurt and boneless chicken thighs. I have all the spices in the kitchen.
Harry leaned in to press a quick kiss on the underside of Draco’s jaw before returning to his plate with a pleased smile.
Blaise stroked the stubble along his chin pensively. "It's not half bad. You've served so many legal letters to your harassers. Potter could learn a thing or two from you."
"That's good. You did well, Draco," Luna said, squeezing his arm right at the harness that had held the arrow he used on Pansy. "I thought that I would have to interfere again after you dissuaded Pansy yesterday."
"Merlin's tits, Potter. Where is your sensibility? Many rights do not make a wrong right, Potter!" Draco said, his company falling silent as they tried to comprehend the statement.
“I’m—” Harry started to defend himself before giving up. “I’m er—not your friend,” he said awkwardly as he pressed his palms against his thighs, looking beyond Malfoy’s shoulder at the wallpaper behind him. “As in, I’m not the Harry Potter you know. I lost my memories during that incident. Six years of it. You weren’t back in wizarding Great Britain six years ago and I don’t know how to—” he gestured between them weakly. Harry didn’t know what possessed him to share about his incident. The news of his memory loss was classified information, only privy to the Ministry, his friends, and family. Was it the sheer awkwardness of the entire interaction? Or the fact that Malfoy might learn about it anyway when they worked together. It was inevitable, really.
notebook?" Harry said as he swallowed. "A bloody mess of glaring inaccuracies. So embarrassing." He shook his head disapprovingly.
Draco’s eyes widened when he recognised her. Constance Cowherd had stated in her letters that she would kill him if he set foot in Diagon Alley, and a demented smile of glee spread across her face when she noticed him. Draco had scarcely moved when a series of blue spells were sent to his face as she lunged for him. He exhaled weakly in fright as the spell connected with his neck. He was bleeding, it hurt, and the pub was incredibly loud. People were shouting and glasses were shattering, and Draco blinked as he collapsed. His throat gurgled, and he blinked at the dirty rafters on the ceiling. His vision was hazy as Harry suddenly appeared on top of him, his hair messy, his eyes fiery and his brows creased—a marvel, a classic, timeless vision that had given millions, and himself, hope, even in despair.
"I've quit the Aurors and accepted the position to be a faculty member in Hogwarts. I'm serving my three months notice with the Ministry right now," Harry said as he squeezed Draco's foot with a hopeful smile.
"Do you already know what to buy for them?" Harry asked, setting his magazine aside. He had lifted a catalogue for Scrivenshaft’s from Hermione's bag and magicked it so that Malfoy would only see a dated edition of Seeker's Weekly. He watched as Malfoy levitated his satchel bag to sort his study materials.
"Well, it was for charity?" Draco attempted, the casualness he had been attempting falling flat completely.
"Don't you feel like disappearing sometimes?" Draco asked as he laid beside his cousin under a young sycamore tree. "To become one with a foreign place," he said idly as he dozed off.
"Just a little bit higher, Teds." Draco got onto his feet as he adamantly ignored Harry's confused stare.
Draco tried his best to control the pleasure he felt. "Catch me again when you're joking about your own mistakes," he said as he shifted his weight on his foot. "But it must be mentioned that I am an Archer. A
"Yeah, sure. Anything that you're having," Potter replied quickly, dropping his menu loudly before giving Draco an apologetic look for the apparently unintentional gesture.
"Why would he think that it was just foreplay when you're this sweaty?" Harry asked suddenly as he jabbed his broom sharply against Draco's arse.
Draco watched the knee jerk defensiveness fade as quickly as it rose. Potter rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "I didn't know it was tradition to take you to lunch after his visits, and when I said that I didn't know which ward you were at, he just ran off," Potter explained with a dejected shrug that
"Oh, you'll be alright. You get hit by Bludgers on the daily," Hermione said when Ginny continued to whine at Blaise.
Harry stared blankly at the new carpet and the bright yellow curtains that Draco had purchased and installed in the dining room. Surely there was more to Harry Potter than throwing himself on the frontline.
What a juvenile mistake, Draco thought as he sunk back into his bed, exhausted from how high maintenance Gryffindor
"It's a family tradition for the head of the house to wear their hair long–" Malfoy said as he undid the transfiguration of the mirror, "but I'll probably never grow my hair longer than this. I don't want to look like how Father used to."
“Yes, well,” Harry said awkwardly. The expression on Malfoy’s face was indecipherable, he looked concerned, a little bit angry and strangely, devastated? It felt like he was intruding in something personal—Malfoy was obviously thinking about the Harry that he knew, but the person in front of Malfoy right now was
Draco had grown increasingly uneasy throughout breakfast, concerned about Harry's emotional state. On top of whatever confusion that had contributed to his distraction, Harry would also be feeling terribly guilty at having let Weasley down. Gesturing for Blaise to look after Weasley, Draco had spent the short window of time he had before leaving for his Saturday volunteering session looking for his friend. However, the Quidditch pitch, astronomy tower, and the kitchens were empty.
Harry finally relented as he trudged along with the tour of Draco's neighbourhood in Chelsea. As the cold wind blew into his face, Harry quickly ran through the list he had made to impress Draco—he only had two more items to go, and he was reluctant for the night to end. He smiled sadly as Draco continued sharing excitedly about the bits of his life and the parts that Harry had had the fortune to glimpse in the few months of their friendship.
Draco fidgeted in the seat, ashamed of his stray thoughts referencing to the Muggle non-violence moment. Oh, his tattered dignity, Draco lamented as he focused on the marble floor, the weight of everyone's eyes on him as the Hat hummed idly to itself above him.
"I didn't actually mean the things that I said," Potter continued, holding a hand up when Draco made a motion to interrupt. "I was jealous and insecure, and I've realised that I've always been a little bit obsessed with you, and not knowing what you did during the weekends really got to me, you know? And it upset me when you wouldn't tell me, when I had no right to be. I felt that you were keeping us out, and feeling like you'd just disappear after school scared me. I've come to expect you being around so much, all of that entitlement made me snap." His cheeks were pink with embarrassment as he looked down at his nails.
Draco lamented the amount of time he now spent with Gryffindors. His playacting was no longer what it used to be. "I'll make you a proper suspicions form to frame your thought process one day." Draco said while keeping an eye on his cauldron.
"A little starter before the real drinks," he winked when Thomas commented about the lack of alcohol.
Potter had lost the sallow, ill-fed look from being a fugitive, yet he had somehow managed to retain the cheekbones. Potter had also grown his hair out, and it was presently touching the collar of his button down. It was a strange look on the boy he had long considered his enemy. With the long lashes framing his bright green eyes and the strange tenderness of the way his hair was tucked behind his ears, Potter actually looked conventionally attractive in the Muggle media sort of way. It was a revelation that Draco didn't quite know how to deal with. He squeezed Pansy's arm lightly for reassurance.
Potter's eyes lit up as he leaned in with a predatory grin. Draco's heart went wild at the close proximity of their lips. He stepped backwards in sheer cowardice.
Draco was at his most charming of the semester that night. He downed giggle waters with Luna, sparred with Hermione about the rights of magical creatures and ways to provide more opportunities for their prefects, talked to Thomas about Muggle art history, found out more about Abbott's Muggle aunt who was a nurse, shared with girl Weasley what he knew about the recruitment trials of the different Quidditch teams, and listened about Greg's latest project and his trips to the Design Museum and the Geffrye Museum. He would hold conversations across tables, swap seats to talk to people, keeping himself engaged as he ignored the weight of Potter's eyes throughout the night.
Draco combed his fingers through his hair in frustration and self-loathing. "Let's walk back together," he offered amicably instead. "You can find your words slowly," he said, waiting for Potter to agree before beginning to walk.
He shot up quickly to the sight of more of his classmates on the floor. It was clear that Pansy had succeeded in her goal to eviscerate everyone.
Regardless, concerning the nature of your manual, it is (seemingly) flimsy and whimsical due to your culture’s depiction of the God of Love. Since the Hellenistic period, Cupid has been portrayed as playful, mischievous, and flighty. As a result, the manual is accordingly depicted as careless and lazy, like the work of a young boy more occupied with his other interests.
Draco pushed him back gently, and Harry finally extracted himself, his heart a frenzied beat while the bond vibrated between them like a ready spell.
"It's okay to not know what you're doing. It's perfectly normal," she repeated when Harry started to cry harder at the empathy and consideration that he was receiving. It was an emptiness and frustration that he had never let himself explore properly before.
"Thanks," Harry mumbled, heart still racing from Malfoy's prior agitation. He returned to pull at the ribbon, strangely touched by Malfoy's concern. He had checked the present the moment he had returned to his room, but it was surprising to learn that Malfoy cared. He didn't want to seem ungrateful and turn Malfoy off by telling him the truth, and privately–after experiencing it once–he quite liked the idea of Malfoy worrying about him.
“You’ll be on a liquid diet for a few more days until the tenderness fades. Do you have any other questions?”
Amidst the comfortable silence that fell upon them, Draco twisted his fingers as he warred with the urge to poke Harry in the face. Harry looked too peaceful lying on his lap, and the urge to tease a frown was strong. If it were Blaise on his lap, Draco would already have pinched his nose, and they would have ended up in a tussle while Vincent, Greg, and Pansy looked on judgmentally.
Teddy raised an amused brow at him as he held the door open for a young couple. “It’s your favourite shop, I promise.”
Rubbing his temple in frustration, Harry pushed his thoughts aside as he refocused on Teddy. Andromeda had given him the opportunity to get to know his grown godson better, and he had been tasked to put Teddy’s third year booklist together, and get new clothes for Teddy in Muggle London. There was a long day ahead with no time for self-pity.
Harry tested his own present for spells, frowning when it came clean. There was no reason that he should be getting another gift when his partner had otherwise come across as fairly normal, if not in the possession of a twisted sense of humour.
Harry sneered when Draco smirked at him in challenge. He would plan a date so good that Draco wouldn't know what hit him.
Greg made a face as he finally looked at Harry properly. “I don’t think that that’s a good idea. He’s been very busy.”
"So you do the book thing too?" Potter asked as he nodded at the coloring book when Teddy returned to his drawing with doubled excitement. Art supplies as a method of distraction was pioneered by Andromeda, and it had proven its versatility many times over.
Draco lunged for Harry. "You take that back!" he said with exaggerated offence as he shook Harry by the shoulders. He yelped when Harry managed to overturn him in a swift move. "Malfoys age well. Have you seen Mother?" He tried to pull his hand out of Harry's grasp to tickle him in the abdomen.
Harry hurriedly stepped forward to help Malfoy unfasten the edges of the box. He startled when he realised that Greg had apparently snuck seven cakes into the box.
Harry checked the parchment paper edged with spilled ink. "Nope, it doesn't," he replied, pleased by the simplicity of his gift. It didn't indicate too much thought, and he quite liked Chocolate Frogs. It was a really good haul, in his opinion.
“I’ll buy you a new broom, one that’s better than mine so that you’ll have a handicap when—” he yelped, grabbing Draco when he pretended to stand. He was laughing as he settled back down. “You wouldn’t be too busy for Quidditch after NEWTs, I’m sure.”
"Has it come in?" Ron asked as he pointed to his own knee where Hermione's first words to him were written in her frenzied scrawl.
Harry tried his best to muster enough amusement. His stomach started to churn again. Everything was an absolute disaster.
"No!" He yelled, tossing the magazine onto Harry as he shot up quickly. Malfoy's eyes were dark with arousal, the greys of his eyes completely consumed by his pupils when he looked away.
As you might be aware, Hogwarts now has multiple teachers for its core subjects such as DADA, Transfiguration, Charms and Potions to help our staff better manage the workload. I will share more when during our interview.
“Tell that to yourself,” Draco said as he reached for the cheese platter, his cheeks flushed with pleasure.
"Don't worry about your chastity, Potter," Malfoy smirked at him as his eyes dropped to Harry's crotch quickly. He gave Harry a saucy wink, "I'll defend it properly."
“This is so good,” Harry said with a sigh, looking at Goyle in a new light. “The contrasting textures and the balance of flavours,” he shook his head appreciatively.
"Merlin, you're paranoid. It's nothing, honestly. I just had French cuisine this week, and I didn't want a repeat."
"Do you not believe me? How else would I have known about the match with the Prides?" Hermione had charmed the calendars to not only include key dates of the charities the celebrity's funds would be directed to, but also selected dates they desired, which updated automatically throughout the year. For Potter, the calendar included details of the Arrows' games, and would also provide key game details after matches. It was a function that Draco deeply appreciated with his busy schedule.
"No, you are a degenerate! You cannot bring your exhibitionist tendencies to Hogwarts!" Malfoy howled as he tried to pull Harry's hands away.
Draco had visited Daphne post haste to explain his situation and express his desire to participate in her blind date service. Daphne had smirked at him before proceeding to fill out an application form on his behalf. After reviewing it with no complaints, he had signed it off, paid the required membership fee and left, relieved and buoyant.
He reached into his sweatshirt pocket to marvel at the special pass under the dim light. Casting a magic revealing spell that Bill had taught them, he huffed at its complexity. He could identify some parts of it though, for example that was a magic signature, that was a basic ownership charm, the orange was a–he jumped when it started to whistle lowly, like a Muggle kettle on the stove. The noise quickly increased,
"Thanks." Harry gave him a small smile. "Gotta go—" he leaned in with an outstretched hand before suddenly pulling away with an awkward smile— "bye. Drink your tea." He pointed at the cup in reminder.
Draco felt his dismissive amusement waiver. He knew that Harry's media shyness had allowed the media to twist his image and portray him according to their narratives. Consequently, the public had come to see him less for his achievements and more as a figure they could attach their fantasies and delusions onto—Harry Potter looked sad and troubled, maybe he needed a warm motherly hug, or the shoulder of a lover—and the circus would start. People would mob him and, apparently, also send him soiled panties. Harry was slumped over the empty glass, adamantly evading his eyes as the table looked at him in anticipation.
The curse was getting stronger my feet were getting heavier and I felt as if I was falling before I blacked out. I swear that just before I blacked out I saw Harry running towards me with tears running down his face. I also felt arms holding me as if I was a baby. I was carried gently and before I was pulled too deep into the realm of sleep I felt that I could spend forever in these arms and never regret a thing. I dreamt of Harry all throughout the night wondering if he would be there when I awoke.
“Hermione, Draco and I are both guys and even if you and Ron had children and I was an Uncle to them and I adopted children. I would never be able to have my own children because men cannot conceive.”
I felt like stone as I sunk onto the floor. I saw Longbottom staring at me, and I wiped my face to find tears. “I saw your memories, and I believe you. I won’t ask you about what I just witnessed, but I will tell you this. You better tell him what I just saw if he lives through this.”
That night Harry was like a beast, he tore at my suit, but I was no better. We tore the clothes off each other till we were naked. Harry whispered, “You look beautiful.”
“I would get hurt because you aren’t taking care of yourself and I would blame myself for not being there when you needed me. Harry, would you please at least sit with me and spend time with me? I feel so lonely without you.”
We sat together for a while and Harry sighed, turned on some music and offered his hand to me for a dance. I smiled taking the hand and going for a dance with Harry. “You know,” He said as we swayed, “ever since you said you could have kids I was sort of hoping for little ones being my present this year, as well as calling you my wife as we danced. I guess I was hoping to shout to the world you are mine by now. Don’t get me wrong the first two weeks after the war were awful with people blaming you for your fathers mistakes, and I knew then you were right in asking for me to wait, but after a month of us publicly dating things died down and I was hoping that you would change your mind about it. I kept wondering why you wanted to continue to wait.” He twirled me around and pulled me in giving me a sweet kiss before we continued our swaying.
I smiled and held him close to my chest. I purred for the whole ten minutes, and as promised I opened my wings and let him stand. I spent the rest of the day holding his hand and listening to the age old “you hurt him, we kill you” speech. The smile never leaving my face and the speech seeming to be softer in tone as the day went on.
Hey Guys! I just read my first comments on this story don't worry you will find out why the Malfoys get cursed in this story and how it affects the story overall. Some fun facts, I plan to make a sort of sequel to this story later and if you read each chapter carefully you might see who that story will be focused on. Please tell me what you think. Love it? Hate it? Title spelt wrong? Anything you care to tell me is highly appreciated!
This was how I was no longer at a loss, but now had no clue what was going to happen next. I fell asleep wondering what my fate be.
“I should not go. Even if my name is clear my Fathers is not. No one should have to look at the Death Eaters son while they bury their loved one who fought against Death Eaters. I do not wish to make this harder on the grieving. Would you please go without me?”
He kissed me. “I don’t know if I want to leave you alone right now. Would it be alright if I joined you for bed and cuddled you all through the night?”
Then reality set in. Hermione and Ron showed up, but I let him know that he wasn’t getting away from my feelings without answering them. Shortly after, Ron got weird and left us by ourselves. We needed to get the Sword of Gryffindor, it was our best chance to destroy the creepy thing, Draco didn’t like the idea Hermione and I had, but it would work. We were left alone when she went to get more water, and I was finally able to talk with him. Well, more like argue with him, I tried to get it out of him but he left me hanging. Then I saw him fall, hard, I ran to catch him tears streaming down my face, when I did, I carried him gently to his bed and messed with his hair. I realized then that the curse was really killing him, and I wanted to die right then, before death took my heart.
We were talking about Hogwarts and their wish to teach those who couldn’t be taught due to the war last year, and whether we wanted to return to school. During this talk, which lead to more laughter, Harry just suddenly stopped laughing and spoke with such sorrow. “I have never laughed so much in a summer before. Draco, this has been the best summer of my life. I must admit that if this is what summers will always be like this that it can only get better from here. Jeez, before Hogwarts I never smiled. I had no reason to smile, but thanks to you and others I have learned the importance and value to smiles.”
I was completely shocked by the words coming from Harry’s mouth. I stood solid, trying to convince myself that I would not get any closer to him then I was, but instead of standing still I took one step closer. The pull to lean into his ears and whisper the words I’ve been longing to say to him was so strong that I opened my mouth and was about to say them when Hermione apparated right next to me. I stopped, but Harry didn’t. “Draco, I expect an answer later. Don’t think Hermione popping in is going to stop me from knowing.” He walked away leaving me with Hermione. She stared at me with questioning eyes. I whispered to her, “He told me he loves me and wants to know whom I love, he doesn’t know that the curse has been activated. He still thinks I am just worried that I might have it activated. I can’t risk telling him now, maybe before but now…? Impossible.”
We eat in silence and once we are done his smile falters for a second. "Scared Potter?" I say jokingly at him. "Terrified, actually. I am terrified that what you are about to tell me is that you will have to leave me and go find your mate. I'd rather just sit here with you and watch the stars." I could feel his sadness in radiating waves of hurt and pain. I pull him in a way that he is sitting on my lap.
She looked so shocked. “You trust me with knowledge that has been lost since Merlin’s time. It has not only info on your curse, but all of them. Thank you for your trust.”
That was till I smelt the familiar smell of rain in fall, like chocolate being heated up, like vanilla in the wind, like Harry. I turned towards the door, and was shocked not to see Harry, but rather Luna. “You shouldn’t have let him go alone quiet yet, the Nargels will get you.” She handed me a shirt I recognized as Harry’s. I held it breathing without pain for the first time that day.
“Father never planted one. He said the practice was archaic and frivolous and refused to ever plant one. I’m kind of glad though because it would have rotted this garden ages ago.”
I was floored, but I smiled. “I have never been good at giving things of myself to others. In fact, as a child I was told to never let anyone know how I felt or I would become a creature, a monster. Yet, no matter how much I held it back I was always in love with Harry Potter. I had to force myself to believe that I wasn’t, but I never could believe it no matter how hard I tried. So, today, I lay all my emotions bare, for the whole world to see. I love Harry Potter; he is the one who has always held my heart through it all. I can, and will, never love anyone else more then I love him. I whole-heartily accept anything he gives to me and return it in full infinite times over. My answer to you, my dear, is… You wish Malfoy.”
His face went to scared halfway through my transformation, but I didn’t register that it was for me till much later. The pain of the transformation lead to me collapsing onto the floor, but not passing out. He approached me saying, “Draco? Are you okay? You grew wings, your eyes changed color, and your hair grew, and then you passed out. Is this the curse?” I smelt him. He smelled like the rain in fall, like chocolate being heated up, like vanilla in the wind. He smelled wonderful, he smelled like MINE. The thought scared me almost, but I had to power through. I opened my mouth and spoke. “Yes. I didn’t tell you but, the activated the curse. Now that I have told you how I feel, my body is turning into a Veela. I can smell my mate already. It takes every fiber of my being not to go and attack them.”
“All that time I was angry. Hermione let it slip that she knew who you liked and swore she wouldn’t tell me until you did. I felt like everyone else knew something I couldn’t see. I was tired of being left out. Yet, you still told me 'no' so much that I was physically in pain. I couldn’t bare it when we left you behind, but then the most unexpected thing happened you said how you felt to a mirror while I could hear you. I was ecstatic, you loved me, ME! I wanted us to be together so badly, but then you turned and I was sad again. Why did you write it all down?”
The tug of magic and pull of emotion in me made me weaker, but my will was stronger. “I told you Potter I will tell them when this is all over.”
After that we decided that we would return to Hogwarts for one more year. Though we were worried about being separated, we knew we could find ways to stay close even though we were in different houses. I decided then that every summer with Harry would be the best summer ever.
My heart hurt and twisted on those words. I turned to him ready to tell him everything, but I was stopped as soon as I saw his face. “I know it will hurt not knowing, Harry, but trust me it will be all worth it when you win this war and destroy the cruelest monster in this world. You will survive this war Harry and if you don’t I will have no reason to carry on. If I could tell you without risk of betraying my heart I would, but there is too much at risk. I can’t-won’t- risk letting the curse get me.”
He was. I awoke to a sleeping Harry Potter right next to me. Hermione was already up and making us breakfast, so I moved him gently off of me and on to the space next to me. His hair was more of a mess then I have ever seen it before and it made me want to push the hair off his face. I sat there for a while just staring at him until Hermione came to check in on me. She was rather quiet and it shocked me when she finally spoke.
We walked a path we used was the one we did when I told him the story a few days before. He brought me to the place I told the story and pointed to new flowers in the garden. They were jade dragon lilies.
Finding you the perfect gift was extremely difficult to do. I found you a jacket that I wore for a month that I will give to you, but I thought that it wasn’t enough so I found something really pretty and will show it to you later.
I decided that we had to go to Godric’ s Hallow. So, we went, and Draco fallowed. Hermione and I went into my old house and Draco stayed in the graveyard. When all hell broke loose, I was not expecting to lose him. He was gone, lost, most likely dead, and it was all my fault. I wanted to cry but, figured that at least it wasn’t the curse that killed him. Ron came back after we found another one in the vault that we stole it from. I was hollow, empty, and lost. I was remembering everything that happened that lead to this point. It didn’t matter to me anymore who he loved, I just wanted-needed-him back in my life breathing right next to me. But he wasn’t and that was my fault.
“I know, but I really want to tell my friends that I have someone who means the world to me, and most of mine know you’re a Veela so none of them should say anything about it.”
I hugged my mother close as she cried on my shoulders. “Mama you didn’t know that he would do that you couldn’t have known. I am glad you weren’t there because it would have been worse for me I would have cracked ages before Harry and his gang wouldn’t have been able to save me if you had been there. Thank you for saving Harry that day because if you hadn’t saved him I would have died that day too.”
I smiled at him. “It’s okay, now you know, and it doesn’t hurt anymore.” Which is true, when I heard that he didn’t know that my heart fluttered, and I felt extremely better.
“Are you kidding me? They caged me up and awaken a curse that has been in my family since the time of Merlin. You think I wanted to be a Veela? I didn’t I’d rather be out there trying to stop him, but my Mate told me to stay, so stay I must.”
He smiled at me and held me closer by the waist. “Rest of my life huh? Sounds like a great plan to me.” And he kissed me right in front of my mother who smiled the whole time.
He smiled at me and tugged me towards the exit of the garden and brought me inside where we had cocoa and snuggled for the rest of the day.
“Well, I saw all those hands coming over, and thought that they would touch you. I wasn’t going to let anyone but me touch you for at least another month, and I really don’t want to answer a million questions from your fans anytime soon.”
When we entered the room and he sat me in a chair that magically appeared behind me. “Draco turned into a Veela. Hermione, we need to keep him from the battle.”
He learned so much because of the lack of threat to his life, and his smile was even brighter the next day, when he finished all his classes, that I felt like I could melt into a pile of goo. Now all we had to do was wait for summer to come and give us both the best gift we could ever receive. Then Harry would give his most wonderful smile yet.
“Well no… But, oh well it doesn’t matter now. I will tell you but you must listen all the way through with no questions till the end all right?”
“Thank you, Harry.” She opened the second present and in it was a pendant necklace with a dragon and owl on the front. She teared up when she saw it.
Harry smiled, and as the music stopped he held my cheeks and passionately kissed my lips, slipping his tongue in my mouth and thoroughly tasting every centimeter of what he found. He left me breathless before he spoke. “So, what your telling me is it might not be this years present so maybe next year?”
I remembered what happened and flinched feeling the left-over bruises. I also felt the pull of a strange force, but decided to ignore it for the time being. It was then that I heard shouting coming from below us.
And we did. We snuggled, held hands, and snogged for the rest of the date simply loving being with each other.
There will be Lyrics from a Song that is definitely not mine so please listen to the original Hero by Enrique Iglesias. Thank you and enjoy!
I don’t know how long I spent in the loop of going to the girl’s room, trying to find the words, falling to the floor, and having Longbottom drag me back to the Hospital Wing, but soon news of Harry on his way to Hogwarts made its way into my ears. I was so many things at once that I couldn’t tell what it was, I was feeling so I went to the girl’s room on a day I usually didn’t faced the mirror and saw the smile on my face.
After dinner and after a quick snog Harry and Draco started to read the evidences. Harry was indeed impressed by Draco's notes . It helped them a lot . The questions they couldn't fathom Draco wrote them quickly and he knew he will consult Hermione and then will go and check the library.
"Well , how could we?  It requires parseltongue and you were kind of busy ,with Ginny . I didn't wanted to disturb you, plus you said you could not speak parseltongue after Voldemort died."
As soon as Draco saw Lily and Al his facial expressions softened. The sneer was replaced by a beautiful smile.
Pansy turned and to his astonishment saw Harry sitting there . The black hair was messed up . His shirt was half open and there is a visible love bite on his neck . Pansy smirked.
"No Mr Malfoy, Scorpius is the most brightest wizard of our batch . He is not only intelligent but sweet and humble."
He knocked the Door . A house elf escorted  him inside . Draco was sitting on a sofa reading a book .
Harry mouth hung open . Inside Scorpius's room Harry saw posters of him . He catching the snitch. He, ron and Hermione  giggling .. and underneath the picture it was written "The famous Golden Trio and there was a poster of Buckbeak and he petting him
"It's Astoria Greengrass" . Sighed Hermione . " Wait what, Draco's dead wife? Are you implying that she is alive? "Harry asked."
"Harry  you are being summoned in the head auror's office." Dean Thomas told him as he stepped inside the elevator."
As soon as  Harry heard this his eyes fell on Draco was blushing furiously under Harry's gaze .Draco was blushing even more when he caught Harry watching him and smirking .  "I ... I" Draco tried to explain " shut upp  I WAS SITTING IN THE RESTAURANT FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR YOU MORON. I will only spare you if you went on a date with Potter .If not I will hex your balls . " Pansy glared at Draco.
"Then tell me . Please tell me I am wrong . Please tell me it's just a stupid snake you are keeping down your basement because you have some wierd snake fetish. Please tell me that's not Astoria . Please tell me you didn't withheld any information . Please tell me Draco . Talk to me . Please . " Harry cupped Draco's cheeks with his hand and continued " look at me Draco please . I believe you . I.. I think you didn't had any catastrophic intentions . I trust you . Please please talk to me ."
"Don't ever say that. Both of us deserve happiness after everything. And I am happy with you and so you are ."
"Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy . I would like you to visit the safe houses immediately.  Before anyone else gets hurt. There will be a team waiting for you on the entrance. I would suggest you to look for your partner. And I want the detailed report of today on my desk at five p.m sharp . Am  I understood?
"You are an ass Malfoy.  First you evil Donkey you didn't even bothered to inform you came here back and now you are ignoring my phone calls. We were suppose to meet today you dumbass to discuss about you and that stupid scarhead  Potter and about your bloody growing affection for that dimwit.
Scorpius apparently interrupted the conversation because he had no Idea then who the hell was Potter most probably and announced . "Papa brought flowers for you. "
"Thank you minister. But how can  I work with someone who has no sense of time, duty. He arrived late here . No rules are applied for the golden boy I know that very well"
And then Harry heard Malfoy screaming the death curse towards the snake . Within seconds the snake lay life less.  .
"No . Ofcourse not . Can't you see this place us filled with ancient stuffs . What if some thing dangerous is in there? I guess we need to head back . Report about this to Granger maybe she remembers something."said Draco
In the dinning table Harry cooked pasta. But he saw Draco was not touching the food. He was completely pale . His iris blown . He was afraid. Of what . Harry washed Lily's hand and carried her towards her bedroom. Lily astonishing fell asleep . Generally it take atleast three stories to make sure the young witch had fallen asleep. So Harry tugged her covers and he proceeded towards the dining room .
Draco looked at the picture and smiled ! Malfoy can smile!!  he looks so beautiful when he does . He should smile more often  . Thought Harry .
"Not we , I will talk to him, please agree to this mione. I can't lose him .. you know I can't . " Harry said with pleading eyes
Then he put the palm right on the head of the snake. Harry automatically said open . And to his astonishment the snake started moving and it unlocked the door .
Suddenly from somewhere Fawkes came flying in with the sorting hat . Fawkes droped the hand into Harry's hand . Without wasting a single bit of  second Harry took out the sword of Gryffindor and slashed Kingsley's arms . As soon as the arm got separated from the rest of the body Kingsley's seizures stopped. He was still unconscious. His breathing was returning to the normal.
Harry headed towards the Living room . He found Ginny already sitting on the sofa. She was rolling the paper weight. She seemed nervous.
"Daaaaaaaadddddddddyyyy" screamed Lily Luna Potter as soon as she saw Harry . "Did you bring my a  chocolate frog ...you promised yesterday"
Draco stiffened beside Harry .Harry's nostrils flared. Harry was angry so much angry . How dare they called Draco his DRACO whore.  He curled his fists together .
Harry's sobs brought him back to the reality. He pulled Harry towards him , hugged him tighter . He quickly casted a cooling charm wandlessly. He took of Harry shirt and tossed it on the floor. He was about to leave when Harry asked him to stay . And to be honest he really wanted to stay .
"You know mom Scorpius is so good. And he knows so much about wands. It was quite fascinating. I learned a lot that day. He is such a great friend . You know dad we promised eachother that we will seat together in the Hogwarts Express, because its his first year too . Oh and Hi mister Malfoy . It was a pleasure meeting you."
"Without wasting any more time Malfoy shoved the papers into Harry's hand and walked straight towards  Lily.
"Avada Kedvra" and green flashes everywhere. The snake like man had killed his mother. Harry's ears were filled with screams of his mother . Voldemort turned towards Dumbledore now another jet of green flash.
“Look at him Ron, he would’ve died down there at least now he can help us since he probably knows Voldemort’s plans.”
Then as if by magic it was suddenly Christmas morning and the three of us sat down by the tree having breakfast before we started opening the presents. “Alright boys, it’s time for presents.”
“Fred and George, are currently fighting over it. Ron told them both to give it to someone else, but both said something about giving you a talk. And they cannot decide who. I think I will go ask if they figured it out.”
“Well they might if the introduction I plan to make didn’t start with. ‘When I turned Veela my mate turned out to be…’ and you know them knowing that threatening a Veela with killing its mate would get you dead they wouldn’t dare.”
“I may not know his plans, but I know enough about that monster to outsmart him. I will help you win this war and all I ask for in return is my safety and a chance for redemption.”
Then the nightmares got worse and worse until all I dreamed where them. I was lost in the nightmares that plagued my mind and it was all I could see. It felt like I spent years in the darkness, but when I awoke, I was glad to know that only a month had gone by.
He smiled back. He then whispered in a small voice that only I could hear. “I could be a dad, one day?”
I kept trying to convince him because a part of me wished it was me, he was talking about, and I wanted to know who it was. He wouldn’t budge, and that made me pissed. I yelled at him, even though I didn’t want to, I shouted and shouted until I told him how I felt. I said, “Because I love you! Because I keep wishing that the person you want to tell is me! Because I don’t think I could live without knowing. Because I am not sure I will make it out of this war alive.”
“For everyone’s safety I can’t tell you, but I can tell you that no one should be able to find you. We aren’t sure we should trust you Malfoy, but we are willing to help you heal at least.”
They were all in the same room when I entered it. “I was wondering if you would give me permission to use the library?”
I started telling him every constellation that I knew and as I said them, they appeared closer to us so to see them better. I had made it through almost all of them when he stops me. "What is that really bright star in that constellation?"
“Harry, we have been over this before. I won’t risk it not when it could mean the end to life as we know it.”
I giggled. “We can find a place together or live somewhere you are comfortable with. I have been disowned, but Mother left Father after she heard about what he did to me. She would love to meet the Godson of her cousin Sirius, and the fiancée of her son.”
I saw him, standing there with a mixture of shock and happiness on his face. All I could feel was this immense pain trying to throw me deeper into the curse. I smelt the air, and suddenly smelt an intoxicating smell. I knew that the owner of the smell was near, and that they were mine. I felt my muscles pull apart and reshape themselves. My shoulders felt heavier when my wings started to grow. All the time I can’t keep my eyes off of Harry.
The man in front of me had no nose and wore nothing but black, which made is pale skin eerie rather than luminescent like my Father who stood beside him, and had a snake that coiled around his feet as if preparing to strike.
I smiled, but I refused to answer him. He picked me up and held me to him as he ran to the room of requirement. I was being held in such a way that I could hear his heart beating. My heart in response called out telling me that it was beating at the same rate as his. I knew then that he was my mate. I wanted to tell him everything, but I knew I should not, not when so much more was at stake.
“Why? I told the one person I knew needed to hear it and he took it well, then I tell one of his closest friends, one of the calmer ones, and now the whole wizarding world will know by tomorrow. Next time I want to tell you something you should not convince me to tell others, and if you do let me not only pick the who, but the when and where as well.”
She hugged me after I finished speaking and left me to what I was doing. As I finished Harry entered the room and watched me for a while before he spoke. “You call Hermione by her first name, but Ron and I get called by our last names. Why is that?”
This was alright because after all, this wasn’t are happily ever after, but the best start to the journey ahead.
Harry was silent for a long time and I watched him as he thought about what I said. He looked sad, confused, and mad all at once. His response was what shocked me the most. “Draco, if anyone said that about me, I’d fall in love with them. Now we best be going it’s not safe here anymore.”
It had been now two whole months since I was saved by Harry Potter and co. and I haven’t been allowed to leave the room I’ve been forced to sit in for that time. Granted that’s not quite true I have been allowed to use the restroom down the hall (when I was healed enough to walk), but I haven’t been told that I am free to wonder. I was getting bored and decided to see if they would allow me to read some of the books in the library so I went to ask the three of them.
“Harry, he was caged in his own family’s dungeon, for who knows how long, we should be better than those we fight against and heal all wounded people regardless of their past.”
I giggled so that he was the only one who could hear me. “Before thinking about whether you’ll be a father. You should at least think about marrying me first.” He blushed with a smile on his face. My Veela was suddenly happy. He pulled me close and gave me a light kiss. “I’m truly sorry Draco but knowing this makes me really happy. Can you forgive me for my stupidity?”
I didn’t answer him, but I knew that since he practically ordered me to stay behind that I wouldn’t be able to budge from the room. I wanted so much to follow, but I couldn’t. I had to leave my life in his hands, and a part of me wanted to leave so much more in those hands, but I knew that it was hard enough bring the worlds savior, let alone mine. I knew that if he lived through the battle that he would be my savior too. I prayed to every god I could think of to bring him safely back to me. I just hope one of them was listening.
“Hah… It was shocking once I realized I loved them. At first, I was jealous of what they had with friends then as I got older, I kept looking at them wondering when I could be the one to make them smile, to be the one who would make them want to try harder. I thought that it was a faze, something I would grow out of, but I never stopped hoping that I’d make them smile. I felt like I was going to die when I heard that my parents sided with Voldemort because I knew that meant that I would one to hurt them the most. Then I knew no matter what would happen I couldn’t tell them, because they live in the light and I- I am stuck in the dark. They mean the world to me, and as much as I want to tell them, I am not worthy of anything they give me.”
Taking his hand for a shake Hermione said" Well I prefer if you call me Hermione but you will call me Granger anyway hi Malfoy . I read your files yesterday it was very impressive indeed . I was in a hurry so i missed your name. We are glad to have you in our team" Hermione smile was tight it was evident she was indeed uncomfortable. Seeing Draco brought her back those horrible memories from the manor and Bellatrix and the word mudblood on her wrist. Without further ado she left the cabin .
"I feel something off ... You know about that Delphi girl . I mean she looked a bit like Voldemort when he was younger."
Harry exited the Ministry and came to his favourite cafe. He sat  down in his favourite table which happens to be at  the far end of the cafe. He ordered for an earl grey and two chocolate cookies.
"What .. what are you working on?" Harry changed the subject . Hermione understood why . "Oh, do you remember I was researching on the blood curse that nagini was effected with and who were the decendants of her . Especially her present decendants who is alive . And I found that apparently the Greengrass family was effected by this curse . Especially the women of the family . And do you know who was the last female Greengrass? "No" Harry said.
"Okay I will handover the details , and its good to see you Draco. Your son is extremely promising just like you."
'Well there was a ongoing rumour that there is some kind of prophecy that if Voldemort fails in this battle he has no need to fear because he can rise again if he produces an heir with one of his trusted followers. We ofcourse didn't believe it because Voldemort was busy hatching new plans and new strategies to win the battle . He had no time to you know ."
" Granger where is the lab I have to test this immediately in the lab . I found this in the chamber of secrets . There was a cauldron . I fear this is the Rudimentary Body Potion . Which Voldemort himself invented to return .
"Harry it was just a nightmare." He hugged Harry tightly. Harry's head rested on his chest. He could feel Harry's breath returning to normal.
"You know what Ginny, Malfoy is right . I am done with you. You know . You are so controlling . Well I am signing it ... Its better if you do it too"
Ana merely smirked and slithered towards him . "You two , unbelievably loud, and also it was a fair nice display of fornication".
Harry smiled bitterly " they hated magic and my parents were freaks to them. They told me my parents died in a car accident . "
"If my cabin is really bothering you that much then clean it up. Do it you are a wizard. And please don't irritate me please I am going through a lot already."
"As you wish Potter". Malfoy took his whole length into his mouth and started to suck it. Harry started to move . He could feel Draco moaning around his cock . Harry soon felt pressure building up and with one single rough thrust he came.
James have  a good number of followers specially girls . "The green eyes and the messy hair attracts them the most. Thank you dad for your genes" once James told Harry .
"OPEN" Harry uttered in parseltongue. Suddenly the green eyes of the snake flashed open . Green emerald eyes . But the snake didn't move . Then to Harry's surprise Draco did something unbelievable. He took out his want and made a cut on his palm so that some blood oozes out .
"But that's dangerous, whoever is planning to resurrect Voldemort get's this piece of information you know what happen Harry. I can't see you die again Harry." Hermione said . Her eyes are gleaming with tears "I have to take necessary action for this, But I believe in Draco , we need to talk to him first .
Its fine Potter I understand . You would have done the same thing I know. Bloody saviour complex . "And Draco smiled at him . His beautiful breathtaking smile.
"You know your and my son is in same house" smirked Draco . "Al . I know . I don't know how he is keeping up though." "My son will watch your son's back always. Slytherin brotherhood . We always stand united. You know Potter Slytherin is the best house . "Harry snorted. "What you don't think . We are determined, cunning, ambitious and resourceful. " "Yeah yeah yeah"
"Dad will the good uncle with white hair will come today? Will he bring me chocolates?" Lily pouted and asked Harry
"Now before you begin the supper Mr Potter will like to share few words with us." The Headmistress addressed the students .
"Nothing just thinking about your boxers." Draco abruptly stopped flushed a little  and looked at Harry . And suddenly started throwing some chocolate balls at him . They ofcourse had to flee from the shop to minimize the wrath of the shopkeeper . Draco tossed a handful of galleons and ran for their dear life towards the apparation point . Why they were running like some idiot teens who stole something and was not acting like an actual adult .. they couldn't fathom . Ofcourse the shopkeeper wouldn't have said anything afterall Draco was with Harry thought Draco . But they were really enjoying themselves . They stood in the apparation point . Draco took Harry's arm as he apprated to his house . As their feet touched the ground , they could see both of them panting as they were running previously out of no reason . And then they burst into laughter and laughed untill there was some tears on the corner of their eyes. Lily heard the sound of laughter and came inside the room . She jumped up and down as she saw Draco and asked for the chocolates. Draco muttered "engorgio" as the shrunken packet came back to its original size and handed over to Lily . Lily kissed Draco on his cheeks and said"you are my absolute favourite and I love you." And then ran away inside  . Harry sighed.
“Did you know that when purebloods started popping up Merlin gave them a curse for fear they’d get together and decided to kill him? It is said that this curse can only be put into effect when the body and mind is so broken up that even loved ones don’t know who it is. I want to see what this curse does.”
“Draco, Harry was telling about going to check on the injured, but said you had something interesting to share with me.”
So, we waited, and waited… and waited, until we heard a scream. “That sounded like Ginny. She never screams, what could it be?”
I never thought a smile could mean anything, but the summer Harry spent with me was the first summer in my entire life that every smile meant something. He’d smile at my jokes, at my silliness, at everything, and every smile of his gave me another reason to love him. We laughed practically the whole summer simply loving each other. I learned so much about Harry that summer, and ones of those changed the meaning of his smile forever.
Eventually more people are put in the dungeon with me, but the most shocking was Harry Potter. They didn’t think it was him so they threw him down there with me. He spoke with his friends and I heard his voice. I nearly panicked when he approached me.
He relaxed at that answer but the tug that pulled at me wanted to get closer to him to ease him with myself. It was a strange strong pull that felt impossible to pull away from. I felt my heart grow weak and my mouth go dry. It felt like the first time I realized that I loved Harry Potter. I looked at him hoping the pull worked both ways but was surprised when he spoke. “You can go to the library and read whatever you can find.”
They had left me alone to find the first one which was at the Ministry of Magic. I kept telling them how dangerous it was to go to the one place were Voldemort had a foot hold into our government, and that could mean death. They were determined to go there and get it. Hermione gave me a place to wait for them so that I could meet up with them instead of being on my own. So, they went off to almost certain doom and I made camp, placed temporary wards, and got everything ready for when they got there.
He walked away after that leaving me to watch him as he went; he left me with a single thought. “Maybe next year…”
Red hair like fire as they danced along with black cinder. Two men, brothers fight back to back against the cinder. They are strong, but the cinder men out number them. They look at each other, at the face that they not only see in the mirror, but that they see from the person beside them. They both smile at each other, but the one with blue eyes protects the one with green. He takes the hit of a spell that kills, and falls down in silence, a smile on his face. When he lands a voice is all I hear in my ears. “Protect him, for he holds an important fate in his hands. Guide him to her when he is ready, for your sister Veela is ready.”
Then I waited, and waited, …and waited, until I was physically worried that something might’ve happened to them. I didn’t know why I was there to begin with but I knew I had to be there for some reason. The pull that I felt every time I was near Harry had only gotten stronger now that I was alone, and I had a million urges to speak how I felt aloud. I had to stop myself from it, but I couldn’t quite stop myself from mouthing the words ‘I love you’ every five minutes or so. It had started five minutes after Harry had left my sight, which had been over an hour ago. I was waiting for the three of them to get back, so I cleaned the tent … again when finally, I heard the pop of apparition. I ran to see who it was that had come back.
“Before your mother entered Hogwarts, Snape introduced the two of us and we became friends. During the summers before Snape hurt your mother, we were the best of friends. I figured you did not have many pictures of her from when she was young and would appreciate these so I gave them to you. She would’ve been so proud of you Harry.”
"You wish, Malfoy." And we kissed again. I felt that with that kiss we were finally getting to a place where we both understood each other. I could not wait to see where it took us next. Maybe we'll have more dates to come. But for now, we enjoyed the feel of the stars around us as we held each other in our arms.
When everything came to a close and we graduated properly with no Baldy, no fight for our lives, and nothing to fear but our grades I saw a change in Harry that I will never forget. I saw Harry grow in the months between Christmas and graduation. He would help the younger kids, he would gather plants for the potions master, and he would repair parts of Hogwarts that still needed it. He did everything he could and tried his hardest to continue helping others. Harry just would not stop, so I confronted him. I did it before he started our ‘do nothing’ moments. “You need to stop and take a break.”
For a short minute the Veela in me was sad because that sentence meant that the family it had, unknowingly, dreamt up for Harry and I wouldn’t come true. It was sad until Hermione gave him a question.
I freeze as I see which constellation he is pointing at. I chuckled at what he asked before grabbing one of his hands. "Are you sure you want to know? This is our last constellation, are you sure you're not wasting time?"
“She saved my life, I would love to thank her for that. That sounds like a great idea to meet your mother.”
I woke up in the medical wing of Hogwarts. The first person I saw when I woke up was Madam Pomfrey and the second was Neville Longbottom who was talking with her.
I felt the small tug that centered in my stomach tug harder as it usually did whenever I was near Harry. I was confused as to why he asked me that. The tug, and the look he gave me made me feel like I had to go over to him and tell him everything from how I felt about him to my knowledge of Voldemort. It made me feel like I had to anything I could to make him feel better.
My troubles in telling were well worth my little treat of holding Harry in my arms. After all those troubles are worth seeing his face smiling the whole day.
“Ron, I know that, but no parent would just sit by and let this happen for a year without a reason, and personally I don’t think that is the reason.”
I answered. “My mother was a Black before she married my father. She often told me stories about her childhood home and how cramped it was. She also told me that the Black library was the only one that contained information on what the curses did to each of the pureblood lines.”
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived stood in the wards I had placed very carefully around the camp site, was the one who stood in front of me when I went to check. I nearly froze as I saw him, the pull I always had around him wanted me to kiss him and beg him to never do that ever again. Instead I of course went back into the tent to make some tea for all of us since Harry returned that meant that the other two would soon be coming.
“How about this Fred? I will tell both you and him if we all survive, so please keep us both safe, so that you can tease me about it later. All right?”
I had never before heard Harry sing but it was beautiful. The song was slightly sad sounding, but he sang it with a smile on his lips so I couldn’t help but be happy. We danced the night away to many more songs, but eventually we bid our guests ado.
Suddenly, the hall was in an uproar as people traded money back and forth and many people swarmed around Harry and I to ask many questions. I, feeling threatened, opened my wings and surrounded the two of us in them. “Draco, what is this?”
He started to play with my hair as he thought about what I just said. I found myself settled into his lap when I finished talking, but I loved being here in his arms as he petted my hair, so I didn’t say anything. We sat there in silence for a while before he spoke. “As much as I would love just to have you sooner rather than later, I can respect that you would want that. To be completely honest I didn’t want something to soon anyway, so I am okay with waiting for a while. I was more worried about the summer. What are we going to do?”
I turned back and entered into Hogwarts. I went to search through the library in hopes to figuring out what caused my hard problem. It was hard to concentrate on any of the books, and it didn’t take long for me to give up the search. I sat back in the chair and realized that this, besides going to sleep, was the first time I hadn’t spent time with Harry. I suddenly felt really cold, and empty. It was as if all the light and warmth of the world was drained from it. It hurt to breath, and not smell his sent, it felt like something was missing from everything. It was like I was locked in that dark room chained and in pain.
At that point, I wished it was me he was talking about. I wanted it to be me who made him feel like that. I wanted to be the one who brought those sapphire eyes to life, that put the smile on his face, that made him glow with happiness at just the thought of them, and that was killing me. I hadn’t realized that I hadn’t answered him, so I called him by name and told him what would happen should anyone say those words to me. We left Black Manor shortly after. I hoped that one day he would tell me who it was he loved.
I never thought he would actually leave me behind. He did, but still it was shocking. I still remember them coming up to me and telling me what was going to happen. “Look Draco, Hermione, Ron, and I are going to go lead the battle and try to stop this war before it starts. We, however, cannot just leave you alone. If we did you probably would get yourself involved, so we are going to have someone guard you.”
“I can’t stop Draco. I still have things I must do, people I must help. If I don’t, I will have nothing to do and I will feel it and blame myself for all the death and destruction that was caused during the war.”
And before I could answer my tiredness and wounds caught up to me and I fainted before I could even think of what to say to my first crush Harry Potter.
“Because I love you! Because I keep wishing that the person you want to tell is me! Because I don’t think I could live without knowing. Because I am not sure I will make it out of this war alive.”
The Christmas continued with gifts from friends and a nice dinner. Harry signed the letter and we sent it to the Profit. It was the best Christmas ever.
All the while I couldn’t help but think of Gryffindor stupidity and how that was how I got here in the first place and I laughed. I also cried for the first time in years. I decided that I would hide out at Hogwarts and should head there immediately.
Anyway, getting caught by snatchers was the absolutely last thing that I wanted to happen on this mission. But then again, perhaps I had to be here in the dungeon of Malfoy Manor. Hermione had hit my face with a spell that hid my face, so the Death Eaters couldn’t recognize me. Now, she faces Bellatrix Lestrange in an unfair fight, all the while I am, sort of, safe in the dungeon. I felt like I had wronged her and Ron with this mission. I was thinking about running when, I saw something tied to a wall. I had asked it who it was, but I got a chalky voice that cracked and broke, but answered as if he owned the world. It was Draco Malfoy. I was shocked, I started asking questions, but had to stop when I noticed that he wasn’t conscious. I panicked, I told Ron that we had to bring all of the people that were locked down there with us when we tried to escape. He came with us.
Scorpius then looked at Harry and gasped . "Harry Potter oh my god dad you brought Harry Potter !! . Can I shake hands with you sir"?
And if you want a shower which I strongly recommend there is a bathroom attached to this room . The towels are in the cabinet .
"Atleast we should go ... You know inside the bedroom" Draco whispered. "I can't move I am feeling so tired". So Draco did something unexpected . He stood up and picked Harry up in bridal style. Harry was indeed heavy but he just can't let Harry to sleep on the carpet. Thankfully the bed room was close enough . Draco slowly lowered Harry on the bed and muttered "Gosh! Potter so heavy.". Harry chuckled . As Draco lied down Harry shifted towards Draco . He stroked Draco's face by his thumb . Draco snorted and said "Never thought Gryffindors are cuddle type , stop being a Hufflepuff." "As if you are not enjoying this Slytherin " Harry shot back . And Draco laughed. "Today was good you know." Harry murmured as he nuzzled Draco's chest . "So you are suggesting we should try this often?"asked Draco . But he didn't get an answer as he heard soft snores from the raven haired man. Draco smiled a peaceful smile . God he felt like this after ages . This is how Astoria would made him feel . Draco's felt immediately heavy hearted as he remembered Astoria . "Astoria I know you are Happy for me . I will love you always . " Draco sighed and drifted back to sleep.
"If I ever see you are scaring, harassing and threatening first years I swear I will lodge a complain against you guys.  You bunch of idiots." James threatened again.
Harry and Draco reluctantly went to two opposite direction . God Harry wanted to spend more time with Draco . The morning was great specially in shower Harry blushed furiously at the thought .
Days and months passed by yet there was no lead on the case. The duo searched all the safe houses but still got nothing . Draco searched the Manor and got a very less bit of information about the carvings . It was so sort of ritual which brings back a person from death which they knew already . Harry asked his son and Scorpius to keep a close eye on Delphi .  Draco searched for all the orphans and adopted kids after the battle. Delphi's case was indeed extraordinary . No one knows her exact birthdate. Amos Diggory said he found her beside a trash bin near diagon Alley. With a note pinned onto the robe of the child stating to keep her safe . Amos took her. She gave him peace , peace to a father who lost his only 17 year old son for some crazy maniac .
Without wasting a single more moment Harry pushed the door roughly and walked straight and barged into Kingsley's office
Harry could feel Draco's warm tears on his shoulder ... I just miss her so much .. Harry .. She was the only one person who never judged me . Who never felt uncomfortable when my sleeves were rolled up . She was my best friend . A unadulterated best friend . I never thought .. she will leave me so soon . I know if she would have been alive .. she would have surely once in her life time would have marched into your office and spill all my childhood fantasies about you . Or worse would have arranged our wedding . " Harry could feel Draco laughing  . Harry smiled .
"I told you Potter, Granger can help us. You are the brain of the trio needless to say both Potter and Weasley have no knowledge of anything.  It was because of you they succeeded " Said Draco smiling . "I knew you could do it" .
"Oh" Draco half moaned as Potter started kissing his chest . He pushed Draco down on the couch and sat on top of him . With a flick of his hand their clothes were vanished . "Showoff" Draco rolled his eyes affectionately .
"The lord trapped me here. Said I will be needed in the future . But before that I have to wait here until he comes."
"Yes the Rudimentary potion . Voldemort himself invented that . But what is striking me is the fact that where did the person who made the potion got nagini's venom? Longbottom did kill the snake and I will be forever thankful to him  " Questioned Draco .
"Al.... an uncle came. He has white hair . He is a good uncle no the bestttt because he brought chocolates for both of us Al and he is beautiful. " They could hear Lily running and screaming for Albus.
Draco was about to say more when Harry came closer to Draco and kissed him hard . "Shut up , you idiot I can't fucking leave you" .
Draco hugged Harry and buried his face . " I am so sorry, I didn't know Harry I am so sorry . I wanted to tell you . I thought you will not understand me , you will leave me" Draco said in between his sobs . "I didn't had any bad intentions Harry . My son, I didn't even know how my son because the best mate of your son " Draco laughed bitterly . "You can tell me whatever you want to Harry , my son isn't part of any evil schemes of mine . If you think  I have one . Don't ever Drag my son into anything please . He is an extension sweet child . "I know " Harry said .
"Stop blushing like a virgin Potter, anyway I will be heading towards the shower, want to join?" smirked Draco
Ginny and Harry they had become each-other's best friend again. Ginny is dating a hot American bloke who recently became the chairperson of Holyhead Harpies.
"Well see you around . Potter and I will do some research on this if we find something  important we will inform you."
"Malfoy! That pointy ferret what he was doing in the ministry  Hermione? Harry you had a pleasant chat! With that git?"
"What shall we do now?" Harry asked . "I can't believe Draco did this to us , he was always there with me , beside me, he knew everything from the beginning. But I believe he had his reasons . I saw him loving Astoria , He still loves Astoria. If that's actually Astoria he is never letting the snake go . "
Harry took it from Draco and started to inspect it . It was beautiful. It had some beautiful brass carvings on top of it . One can mistakingly take this as a muggle pocket watch . Harry opened it with simple unlocking spell and discovered a small time turner within the brass box .
"Actually I can" Malfoy smirked. "Go on Potter hex me By the way I can Hex you too . I have a wand too. See I am holding it already"
Draco was always interested in both sexes. Though he was more keen towards boys or men .  He could never actually tell his parents about his sexual preference because that's not some kind discussion which his father would have appreciated. Lucius always criticised him, tormented him,  hexed him  as he was never a Malfoy enough. Before he received his death-mark it was Lucius's duty to use Cruciatus curse on him thrice a day.  After war was over and everything had settled Draco met Astoria the love of his life . Astoria was not only his wife but also a  best-friend. Draco had told about his sexual preferences even his crush on the boy wonder. Everytime when Daily Prophet had pictures of Harry printed which is like everyday . Astoria used to tease Draco. She would say "look at his arse Draco .. oh my god your Potter have abs to die for" . When they used to go out they would check out guys together like who has a beautiful smile or has a perfect body .  Draco smiled. As the memories came rushing .
"Let us go and  inspect inside." Harry pointed the wand towards the door and was about to say "alhoramora" but Draco stopped him .
Draco was so close .. his breath  on his neck . Shivers ran down Harry's spine. Harry and Draco was in some sort of a closed room . Then Harry felt soft Lips on his neck . Draco kissing him? Draco's skilled long fingers started to unbutton his shirt . Harry then felt Draco's teeth on his earlobe slightly tugging them.
"Is Scorpius always that well-mannered . You know kind of aristocratic Does he ever  breaks his demeanor!" Questioned Harry as Ginny apparated away with Lily.
Muttered Harry . Draco rolled his eyes . Well well Potter I am going to bring some books and we can continue our research .
"And without the Malfoys the Mr Potter could have never been alive enough to slay Voldemort . Both Draco Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy saved his ass orelse he would have been dead long ago and you people would either have never born or would have been slaves . Such dimwit idiots . Don't you read text books or what . Check out the brief History of the Battle of Hogwarts page no 4105. The Malfoys" Rose Weasley Granger finished her lecture . She looked at Scorpius , his eyes were full of tears. Rose and James went towards Scorpius.  Rose used her tiny hands to rub off the tears. Its okay Scorp. No need to cry.
"With pleasure, well when I  went down I saw scales like you said . It was effin' long . I slithered towards its end and saw a snake weeping . Well it's not a snake actually I mean I don't think it's an offspring from two snakes . But that doesn't confirm was a human . It can be a different kind of being , a shapeshifter or a animagus . And also I sensed a presence of another snake but as soon as I could understand it just vanished . I think there was some kind of spell which alarmed them of me . So before they could attack me I came back . "
"This is how you should propose to Harry you know " and Astoria laughed . "Draco groaned and hid his face on Astoria's neck ."
" One of My father's best friend was in Gryffindor and betrayed his friends and helped Voldemort to kill my parents and send my godfather to azkaban. So you see its not the house which makes us bad . You know anyone who are ambitious and resourceful would have a place in Slytherin , and many great wizards did emerge from Slytherin. The great wizard Merlin . We all know Grindelwald and Voldemort were worse but they were great . Then we have Severus Snape. A man who risked his life and played the role of double agent for years . Horace Slughorn an Excellent potion master . And ofcourse Draco Malfoy . He is my colleague . He is a renowned Auror in both Britain and in America. He invented some really important potions and helped the aurors to put a lot of death eaters behind the bars. He was an excellent student here in Hogwarts . He was our second batch topper after Hermione Granger Weasley. You see you can't judge a person by his past.
Harry closed his eyes and wished he had the sword of Gryffindor. Something deep inside was telling him .. he needed the sword. The Basilisk's venom is required to  stop the curse.
"Unfortunately Malfoy took care of me . Mione I had nightmares and he.... He ... Calmed me . I mean I never expected anything from Malfoy."
He came !Oh god! Another wet dream about Malfoy! This is actually getting on his nerves now.... These dreams about Malfoy started since the day he left manor . Nowadays its getting more and more difficult for him  . The other day Malfoy had bent down to pick up his pen and Harry was actually checking out his Arse. Malfoy's bloody perfect arse. Another day he and Malfoy were in a case. It was a hot sultry day . Malfoy started to take off his clothes. His coat . His waist coat . He untucked his shirt . Unbuttoned the first three buttons . And his hair was all messy . Harry could feel his cock rise.
"Harry I know how hard nightmares can be . I had .. whom am I kidding I still have them. I know Harry how is the feeling"
"Yes and no" mother always tried to save me. But then Father got arrested and everything. I was taken there once and Severus accompanied me."
It was not very difficult to find the trap door . Harry opened the wooden door . And saw a flight of stairs .
"You don't have to ask my permission to come in Hermione . Harry how is parte....... Malfoy is your partner Harry? Asked a bewildered Hermione.
As he entered the room he saw Harry was writhing on the bed . And screaming. Harry's clothes drenched in sweat . Draco started to shake Harry vigorously. Untill Harry woke up . Then he did something which he thought he would never do specially to Potter. Draco hugged him and was whispering soothing, reassuring words like his mother used to do when he had nightmares.
Ana looked at him and swayed his head sideways and looked at Harry and said something . Harry's eye comically got bigger and then he started Snickering . Draco saw the snake is too nodding slightly which Draco took as Snickering too .
"Hi there beautiful princess. Wanna have a chocolate?  I have loads of them in my pocket . And I only want to share with you.
"Don't leave me Harry , You don't know what it feels like to be alone . You are the reason I am Still breathing . After Astoria I was barely alive , I am functioning like a Fuckin'muggle robot . "
"There is no information about the carvings in this book . I guess I have to go to the library of the Manor" exclaimed Draco .
The kiss was chaste and sweet . This time there was no rushing . No wildness . So many words ,so many emotions were expressed they pour their heart out into that one kiss . By the time they pulled away they were breathless . Draco smiled at Harry and Harry smiled back .
"Want to ask me something Potter?" Draco asked Harry as were heading towards the Head mistress's office . Draco's lips were curling into a smirk .
"Harry are you okay? What happened to your lips?" Hermione came running to him as soon as she saw Harry . "Err. Nothing some sort of insect I guess bit me "
"So any updates about the case or you guys were busy?" questioned Hermione as her lips curled into a smirk .
"Its better if we get divorced" said Ginny. "Look Harry things are not the way they were before. You are a completely different person. You are into your work so much tha....."
Harry was feeling suffocated  inside that cabin. He needs to get away from this place. He stood up . Opened the door of his cabin . He started walking . He didn't knew where his was going . His mind filled with raw emotions eyes unfocused  and suddenly he bumped into someone. Someone really tall and pointy.
"Dead. I am a widower." The Temperature of the room shifted . Harry can feel Draco trying hard to conceal his emotions. His occlumency is helping him . But Harry can sense how much Draco misses his wife . Too much of raw emotions Draco wants to hide underneath his stoic face . "She was a phenomenal woman . I loved her dearly Potter. She was my world and one day she was gone . Leaving me Leaving our son........"
Harry kissed him again this time with more determination . Draco could feel Harry was angry. He pulled Draco harder against him and deepened the kiss . Draco moaned as Harry bit his lower lip and released him.
"No mione I guess we require more information . Manor is quite old and maybe it's the skin of a normal snake. I think maybe i should try summoning the snake.  See if it is a normal one or not ."
All the students gathered in the great hall awaiting for their supper . Harry spotted Albus, Scorpius ,James, Rose with four other students from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff they were sitting together. Harry smiled at them as Scorpius waved at him . Scorpius recovered though his eyes were all red and all puffed up. Albus was patting him and was saying something. Rose whispered something and Scorpius giggled.
"No idea! And about the auror .Well I trust Kingsley so he generally see the whole auror department . But yesterday  I signed a paper of a new auror . I didn't had time to check his name but I saw he was in our batch from Hogwarts and he is quite experienced. He was an auror in America . He worked there for more than three years . England is his birthplace so he wanted to return here so he took a transfer. "
Draco's mind drifted towards today's events. Harry was always Draco's crush . Harry's courage, his determination is what Draco loves about Harry . He always had a thing for the boy wonder but he couldn't let anyone know about it . He knew eventually they had to seperate. He will follow a different path  . During the war days Draco was so worried about Harry specially when he didn't return for his eight year. After one whole year Draco saw Harry in the manor with his two best-friends. He couldn't do more . He could have but he was a  coward then . He pretended he could not recognise Harry but that was to him the bravest thing he did in front of this lunatic aunt and his selfish father . Draco always Loved Harry even though Harry didn't accept Draco's hand and chose Weasley over him . And today he felt Harry ...  How close he and Harry was. How their lips were  inches apart . How Harry was biting his lips to stop his moaning ... God Potter's moaning made him hard. Thank god Potter's eyes were closed. Orelse he could have seen Draco's bulge. Then Potter slowly opened his eyes open  . Draco never knew Potter's eyes were so green . Green eys dilated with desire ,want . Potter's eyes were just beautiful. But the delivery boy ruined everything by pressing the sodding bell. He cursed the delivery boy and wanted to hex his balls no Draco wanted to kill him  for interrupting them.
Draco looked up. He looked directly into Harry's eyes and  said"Please what Potter? What do you want me to do" asked Malfoy .
"Gin .. no Malfoy .. no .. I mean he is Malfoy at the end of the day he is a git only . Once a git always a git."
"DRACO MALFOY WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU." Pansy screamed . Then she stomped into the living room where Harry and Draco was sitting . Harry saw Draco was slightly scared. And was amused . She most probably didn't see Harry because she was focusing to glare venomously at Draco .
