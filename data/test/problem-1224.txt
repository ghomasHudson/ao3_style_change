Harry hadn’t had to kill Voldemort. It was so easy that he was killed by his own curse, that Harry had never needed to decide whether or not he would use Avada Kedavra when it came down to it. Or rather, that Harry had never had to ask whether his use of the killing curse would’ve been right. When he clumsily threw the Cruciatus at Bellatrix in fifth year, she’d told him that for Unforgivables to work you really have to mean them. He didn’t know what it said about him that when he cast Crucio on Amycus Carrow, Amycus hadn’t gotten up afterwards. Even if he couldn’t make himself regret it, even if it had been revenge on behalf of someone he loved.
Harry slid his hands along the curve of Draco’s waist, the dip just barely apparent under his tailored shirts and the muscle that flexed under his fingers. He felt Draco curve closer to his body like he was searching out warmth, his hand creeping up from Harry’s shirt to nestle in his tangled curls.
“Couldn’t tell ya,” Ron said, pulling a little bottle from the cabinet and pouring a bit of the tincture onto a cotton ball before swabbing it on Harry’s neck. “This might help.”
At that moment, there’s a low popping noise and a box of food appears in the center of the room, startling Harry and causing Dara to let out a long, anguished moan. “Oh of course its magic delivery, we can’t catch a fucking break.”
Draco’s already impressively pale face loses its pink tinge as he registers what Harry’s said. “You think she’s in danger?”
Draco doesn’t protest, just lets himself be held in a rare moment of docility.
As they passed by the lake on the way back to the castle, it began, quietly, to snow. The forest sighed a deep, contented sigh of relief, and watched them go.
“Not to my knowledge,” Harry says, trying to smile, trying to make nice.
Harry decides then, immediately, that’s he’s not above begging, even a little bit. “Draco, please. Faster, I—“
“Three thousand,” Draco says a few seconds later.
63. Harry knows that you should never believe anyone is dead unless you see the body. Draco fakes his own death, in the middle of Diagon Alley on a Tuesday. The blaze swallows him down with crazed precision, bright and alive, just like it’s supposed to. Harry looks into his eyes right until the end. Draco doesn’t scream, doesn’t crumple. It’s dignified.
He’s trying to summon up enough courage to push his hand up Draco’s shirt and feel the skin of his chest when a soft burbling alarm goes off and Draco pulls back, his lips wet and still so red. “That’s me.”
Harry leans over the machine, grimacing when he fits the plate in, but the band doesn’t wrap around the pin. “My fingers don’t fit,” he grumbles. lifting it back off and handing it to Draco, who pretends to look sorry for him.
Harry nods, sets his tea on the floor, and sits patiently like he does for the Healers. He feels overexposed even though he invited himself into this position, a situation that feels rapidly like its about to roll off the tracks. Draco is so close to him, examining the gouge on his face with a serious expression. Harry notices the shape of Draco’s nose, how it’s actually kind of large, as noses go, but how it makes sense on his face, with how sharp his jaw is and how high his cheekbones are. It’s all Harry can do to breathe.
He was just finishing what must have been the fifteenth line of fish description when a rustling in the leaves distracted him, the woods parting to reveal the largest snake he’d ever seen, feet longer than Nagini and thicker as well, a slightly softer green.
“You looked so terrified,” Harry says, a hand wrapped around the back of Draco’s neck, the sheet pulled over both of them. Outside, there was no moon.
“I think we’re freaking her out,” Harry said, turning to watch her go.
They stand like that in the fall chill, Draco’s head on Harry’s shoulder until Harry gets the courage to reach an arm around Draco, pulling him into his side. It’s the most they’ve ever touched, he realizes belatedly, and suppresses a shiver.
Draco glances over at Ron, who looks like he’s having a bit of an episode about the whole thing. Draco doesn’t like being on the same emotional level as Ron Weasley, but he’s concerned that this is just what the situation calls for.
“You wouldn’t be an experiment,” Harry replies, realizing only halfway through what he’s implying. If he’s not experimenting, then this means something, that all of this is more than he’s trying so hard to pretend.
after he has that chocolate lie in his mouth:
He presses his tongue into Draco’s mouth and backs him against the table, trying to wrap himself up. Harry wants to be closer to him, wants to protect him and wants to be devoured whole. Draco clutches at the collar of his shirt, shoving Harry away with a labored breath, shaking his head even as he rests his forehead against Harry’s. “You’re extremely distracting, go home.”
Draco comes down off the counter much later, and their cups are long empty, silence falling around them like new snow. He sets his mug in the sink and comes back to run his hand over the skin of Harry’s arm, leaving the kitchen without another word. Harry almost follows him but pauses to wash their mugs out instead, feeling sleepy and oddly domestic.
“Why shouldn’t it?” Harry pressed, stretching her arms high over her head.
“So you’re the Golden Boy who can do anything and I’m what, the bottom feeder you got partnered with? And together we make one full human being?” Draco asks scathingly.
proclaimed another in a cheerful red font, just above a cartoonish illustration of a sad wizard standing some distance away from his left arm, a pint glass still clutched in its hand, while a group of horrified Muggles looked on. That struck a little close to home for Harry, so he studied the floor tiles until it was his turn at the desk.
to Bartram." He gestured to the box, which Malfoy flipped open.
"Fucking perv, is what you are."
Malfoy looked between the two of them, then a slow smirk spread across his face, spelling trouble plain as day. “Well luckily for both of us, Healer-patient confidentiality doesn’t apply to fake cocks,” Malfoy said. He leaned back in his chair and stretched his legs out under the table. His feet bumped into Harry’s and he didn’t apologize.
Because it was entirely unprofessional of him, but suddenly Harry couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy looking that intently at his actual cock, about Malfoy’s hand wrapped firmly around him and sliding up and down his length in smooth, even strokes. It was horrible, and distracting, and involuntarily compelling. Malfoy’s hand drifted lower to give the bollocks a fondle, and what was left of Harry’s composure snapped.
"We're not doing everything backwards. Cocks then flowers then drinks. Everything except cocks is in the proper order."
What followed were forty of the longest minutes of Harry’s life. Malfoy was exceedingly thorough in his examination of this newest cock, laying down his quill every few pages to poke and prod at it with his gloved hands, while making exceedingly annoying little thoughtful humming sounds before returning his attention to the form and filling out each section. Harry had never cared much what Malfoy had written before, but this time he felt his curiosity rising higher and higher every time Malfoy finished a page.
Harry grinned, twisting his hand on the upstroke. Malfoy's gasp at that was quickly followed by a squeeze, and Harry’s own cock was suddenly caught in a painfully tight grip.
Harry, who had been staring a hole through the side of Hermione’s head, turned back to Ron. “More ridiculous than sticking an Auror with it?”
“What did you do to it?”
and that may have crossed the line into bad chat-up territory.
Harry decided he needed new friends. A whole new set. These ones were all terrible.
cock?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course I know what that means. Many syllables."
“Absolutely,” Harry said. “I am completely afraid. Because that thing is incredibly disturbing. Distressing. Dangerous, even. And whoever made the bloody thing is
Rosemary cackled. Harry was beginning to think this would be her usual response to anything that sucked about his life. "You were saying you wanted something to happen that would be a distraction from eight Obliviators? Well that takes it!" And then she pointed at the cock that was sitting in the middle of his desk. "This will be the talk of the department for
He could tell when Malfoy got close: his mouth went slack against Harry’s, and his hand on Harry’s cock stuttered and then stalled. Harry redoubled his efforts, sliding one hand between Malfoy's back and the wall and down, rubbing firmly down his crack to press against his hole.
Rosemary grinned, and he felt something low in his stomach drop. She held up the Containment Receptacle she'd deliberately hidden behind the wall of his cubicle, and gave it a little jiggle. "Got a report of a cock for you."
Ron and Seamus glanced sideways at each other, then broke out in laughter. "Cocks. Best thing that happened to Level Two in centuries."
Harry greatly disliked St Mungo's. The cool, dry air. The faint antiseptic smell that he knew would linger on his clothes when he left. The clean white walls and gleaming tile floor. As an Auror, he'd had his fair share of injuries that brought him here. He knew Malfoy had gone on to become a Healer, but by some entirely uncharacteristic stroke of luck, Harry had never encountered him. At least here in St Mungo's. He encountered Malfoy in other places much more often than he was entirely comfortable with. Especially when Malfoy insisted on showing up to Pub Nights. But in a non-professional setting, Harry could easily avoid him in the crowd. And alcohol went a long way toward making Malfoy more tolerable.
He glanced over to see that Seamus had flipped open the evidence folder, looking at the card that'd come with the Vicious Cockmonster, and Harry snatched it out of his hands.
“Had it as a kid, can’t get it twice,” Ron said. He thrust the plate at Harry. “Biscuit?”
Harry groaned and wondered how this had become his life.
"I thought that was you telling me how you take your tea."
“Arrgh,” said Harry again, turning into his cubicle. He flung himself onto his chair.
"I don't. You come in, bringing me a new cock each time. I do a thorough examination. Chat up a piece of heroic eye-candy, send you all on your way when I'm done. What do I have to worry about?"
“Probably. Anyhow, I had to climb up there and get it down by hand. I’m sure someone got a picture of that.”
Luckily, CopyCocks Five and Six showed up on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and each one was increasingly excited to make Harry’s acquaintance. CopyCock Five shivered eagerly whenever he spoke; CopyCock Six liked him so much that the bloody thing maintained an erection simply from being in the same room with him.
Harry blinked down at the box in his hands, then the door to the tearoom. Rosemary sighed. "Honestly." She flicked her wand, and his box sailed out of his hands and through an open doorway on the other side of the department. "Tearoom. Three sugars and a splash of milk. Get your head together, we can have a gossip, and I can catch you up for your class tonight."
Harry shook his head. "And in what universe is sending someone cocks a valid flirting technique?"
And Harry could only laugh.
"No." He grinned, and Rosemary chuckled back. "How was your Tuesday?"
"Splinching. Don't know who, but we just got a report of pieces found at the Apparition Point beside Gringotts. We'll need to collect them and take them to St Mungo's. Check for anyone missing bits, and get a Healer from Spell Damage to sign off on form 68-J." Rosemary flapped an inch-thick stack of parchment at him. "And by that, I mean you."
He mentally applauded himself for a job well-done: transferring it into the Containment Receptacle without touching it or dropping it. And then immediately worried about enclosing it like that. Presumably the box had protective charms on it, but Harry wasn’t entirely convinced that Rosemary wasn’t just fucking with him, sending him off into the field with a regular old Muggle shoebox. Better safe than sorry, he figured. Using his wand, Harry spelled a series of small holes into the lid to give it a bit of air.
"Why do they call you dim? It usually takes people a lot longer to pick up on that."
Harry's thoughts skidded to a halt, because "Hermione? What the fuck does Hermione have to do with this?"
the note read.
He didn’t see how this could possibly get any worse.
And other than a nightmare about Voldemort that night, a thoroughly ridiculous affair where Harry chased him around trying to stick a nose on his face, nothing at all remarkable happened for the rest of the week. Harry’s uneasiness grew by leaps and bounds. At least he’d made it through, he comforted himself as he packed up his things on Friday evening. It was officially the weekend, so he could just put it from his mind entirely until Monday morning.
"Sort of?" Harry tried to say, though it came out rather like a question. Technically he was new to Apparition, though not to the Ministry, and didn't feel like explaining the circumstances that'd landed him in this new (and temporary, Harry reminded himself, very
Harry gaped. "What— But what about Twycross?"
The newest penis had a vibrate function. Lovely.
"Yes, hi," Harry said, setting his box on the edge of the desk. "I need to see the Healer on duty. The Welcome Witch sent me up here. I'm from—"
“Because
"Hm. So are you here to complain about your trainee being boring or just here to chat?"
“Well, you brought me flowers. The least I could do is have your paperwork on hand.”
“Good thing,” Malfoy snapped. “You might want to stop by the first floor on your way out. Perhaps they can extract whatever crawled up your arse this morning and made you
“Yes, I’m positively sure that I filled out the request correctly and submitted it to the appropriate subdepartment,” Harry told the bored-looking wizard manning the front desk. “And
“Wish they’d use their talents for something worthwhile,” Harry grumbled.
. Do you know he examined and took notes on my cock for forty minutes? Commenting all the while, comparing it to that Vicious Cockmonster."
"Why are you taking Rosemary's side? I thought you were
"No, I. You." And then, when Malfoy broke into his stupid fucking-with-Harry grin, "You're an arsehole." Maybe the chest-clutching should’ve given it away a moment earlier, but Malfoy had always been an overdramatic git. It was sort of hard to tell when it was put-on and when he was being serious.
“I meant,” Harry went on, “you should know how to clean it off.”
“Patience, pet,” Draco said, gripping Harry’s hair to pull him away. “Let me get it nice and hard for you.” Then he was casting the spell on himself that dragged the blood up into his cock, and by now, the spell was really beautiful to Harry. It looked like conducting music, like urging an artform; it really did look like Draco was sculpting his own cock, drawing fluid inside him into it. Inches from Harry’s face it rose, and rose.
“Tell me something,” Harry said again. “I’ll give it to you.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I just need a little bit. I’ll join you later, okay?”
“And where were you?” Savage demanded of Penelope. “While I was in the Order of the Phoenix, where were you?”
“Not funny.” Harry turned away, because he had been beginning to think that Kavika was right—maybe Malfoy had moved on. Maybe he wouldn’t be a prat. Maybe pigs would fly, and blood purity zealots would move to Antartica. Ignoring Malfoy, Harry began warm-ups of his own.
“He did it to save you.”
“It’s not funny!” yelled Harry, who was eleven.
“That’s very understandable,” Kavika said. “Many people feel that way.”
“It didn’t feel cool,” Harry said.  “Though I hope the snake got back to Brazil.”
“Er, maybe a little,” Harry said.  “But you didn’t kidnap me.”
Harry opened his mouth.
Travers seemed to hesitate. “You could come.”
“Oh,” Harry said.  He hoped it meant eating cake as well, but Harry could never be sure.  Usually he didn’t get to have cake, unless it was the fruit cake Aunt Marge brought on holiday.  No one else wanted to eat that cake, so Harry always got a little—even though he didn’t want to eat it either.

“A few… wait, a few
"Like your Harpies gossip is any better."
“Be that as it may,” Harry said, “I’m not wanking that thing.”
"This one appears to have something on it." He glared accusingly at Harry.
“But you’re not the one filling it out, are you?” Malfoy said, snatching the stack of papers right out of Harry’s hands. “What the fuck did you do to this?”
The cock tapped forlornly against the glass side of the canister until Harry reluctantly took it from Malfoy. The cock pressed itself up against the glass that separated it from his palm. Harry sighed. Bad Cock Corner was nowhere near enough distance for him with this one. But he thought he had some Peruvian Instant Darkness powder that might do the trick. He could pour some into the canister. Out of sight, out of mind. Right? The cock began to rub itself against the glass, and Harry gave Malfoy a plaintive look.
"Oh my god." Harry's hand slowed to a stop, and Malfoy let out a whine. "You
wanted to see.
“Don’t ask,” Ron said again. “Don’t you care about Harry’s trauma at all?”
He stared at Harry until Harry gave in, otherwise they’d be here all bloody day. “What does that mean, Malfoy?” he ground out, and made his voice go a little mocking as he added, “I don’t understand, please explain it to me with your giant brain.”
Harry made a face at him. “Different. New. What’s with you and completely underselling how entirely bizarre this whole thing is?”
Ron gave him a sad look. "I'm
"It…should?" Malfoy reached out to steady the table, then with a second hand. "Hm. Would you Stupefy it for me?"
waiting for authorization for the address search on Accoutrements
“Bartram,” Hermione muttered angrily, pitching the cock in her hand into the box with more force than strictly necessary. Which, if she was going to toss around cocks, at least she’d picked the one most likely to enjoy it. Harry could see BDSM cock’s excited twitching from across the cubicle.
Harry scowled. “I didn’t wrap it up, the paper was already there and I just,” he said, broke off, huffed a sigh, and started over. “It’s a Containment Receptacle for—”
“...a Containment Receptacle for Acute Preservation of Accidentally Splinched Specimens,” Rosemary said, staring him down.
Harry turned his attention to the hat, desperately hoping that he was mistaken. Upending it carefully, Harry's penis rolled out. He took a moment to hope that the similarity was just a coincidence, so he nudged it over with a quill. And then that hope died; it had the same freckle on the right side, right near the base, that looked kind of like Belgium, and which begged the question of just how the
Many of the Aurors were peering over the tops of their cubicles, but as soon as Harry opened the door they all ducked down out of sight, eager to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to themselves. Harry sighed a little to himself and snagged a stack of evidence envelopes and copies of the paperwork he thought he’d need before he left the Auror Department and went back to his office in Apparition.
He forced a smile for the Mediwitch at the desk. “Hi. I’ve got—”
She had him there. Seamus was a damn fine Auror, though his methods and demeanor when interacting with the public tended to be a bit unconventional. Seamus liked to call it things like ‘easygoing and friendly’ and ‘connecting with people on a more personal level’ and ‘all these stuffy rules are a load of codswallop anyhow, Harry, you know they are.’ Kingsley, on the other hand, tended to refer to it as things like ‘a right pain in my arse’ and ‘are you trying to convince me to take an early retirement’ and, most popularly, ‘damnit, Finnegan, have you never heard of regulations?!’ Harry mostly just called it a headache and tried to stay out of it as much as possible.
No. Harry refused to have this be how he ended his week. He had to make this stop. He tried another three spells and then in desperation, he whacked the rogue penis with form 68-J.
on his
. But not quite.
"You are a horrible person."
“What floor?” asked the man who ended up nearest the panel of buttons.
That earned him another slow blink. “Yes. Well. As you were told via memo, we’re looking into it. I see here that request 7258-12 was flagged for priority analysis and sent down to the Unspeakables for a trace. They tell me they never received it.”
Scowling a bit, Harry resisted the urge to kick him in his stupid bony ankles, and shifted his chair over. “There’s really nothing to tell,” he said.
He turned and stomped off, leaving Filing behind and good riddance to them. Lost his evidence. Unbelievable. Not that he’d held out much hope that the personalized note included with the cock sent to Member Bartram would turn up much of anything, but unfortunately it was the most solid lead Harry had on the case. Hermione was so right; there was too much paperwork and the number of channels those forms were rerouted through before they reached the place they were meant to go… It was more than a little ridiculous.
"I'm sorry, sir. My head…" Harry winced a little to get his point across when the throbbing headache made finishing the sentence feel more trouble than it was worth.
"Shit friend."
Harry sighed. "I want a new Healer. This one is an arsehole."
"Hey! Welcome back! I brought you tea! And I made biscuits." Oh,
"Merlin, Potter. Are you going to fuss or are you going to kiss me?"
And indeed it was a bloke; the evidence was lying right smack in the middle of the Apparition Point.
“No you won’t. Because if you do, then Hermione will come up with a dozen better ones in about ten seconds flat, and then you’ll sulk about it.”
As the next week progressed uneventfully, Harry found himself growing more and more worried. The sudden lack of cocks made him anxious, he found. Ron told him he ought to be glad of it. Gave him a friendly clap on the shoulder at the pub and suggested the case might be over. No more cocks. (Seamus didn’t even bother trying to hide his disappointed look at that. “No more cocks,” he’d echoed desolately, and Ron gave him a clap on the shoulder too and said, “Cheer up, I’m sure something else ridiculous will happen to Harry soon. That’s how his life works.”)
"You think I'd do it?"
“Yes, but,” Harry said, holding up the box and giving it a little shake. “This is a shoebox.”
"I've got good news for you, Potter," Malfoy said, stripping off his gloves and pitching them into a nearby bin. "It's not real."
He pulled out his paperwork and began to copy down the details of his case so far. Ignoring the cocks on his desk went mostly okay. Sometimes he'd catch movement out of the corner of his eye. The big one throbbed from time to time, and the smaller one sometimes shivered eagerly. Harry angled his chair away from them, fixed his gaze firmly on his papers, and did his best to pretend there weren't two very erect penises sitting on his desk.
"Fine. I'll summarize." Kingsley gave Harry a flat stare. "Your stunt last night leads me to believe you need to reacquaint yourself with Section 12C-2 of the Auror Code. I’m transferring you to Apparition, effective immediately, where you will remain until you've administered the Hogwarts Apparition Exam in May. You will also be taking over the classes. Thursdays after dinner."
Hermione rolled her eyes. "You know what time Tom closes the bar.”
"There isn't much," Malfoy agreed, leaving Harry feeling completely wrong-footed by Malfoy bypassing the opportunity to take the piss out of him. But then he opened his mouth again. "Fabulously realistic-looking sex toys, the largest of which," he continued, measuring the length of the Vicious Cockmonster with two hands, "was sent to Bartram, I heard."
“Why not?” Malfoy asked, frowning down at the cock in his hands. He turned it over, as if examining it for some flaw. “It’s a very nice specimen. Lovely proportions. Couldn’t ask for a nicer looking cock, really.”
And they burst into laughter again, and Harry just sighed and sipped his tea. "Speaking of cocks, feel ready to release your fucking Sticking Charm? That's evidence you're tampering with, you know."
“Just wait,” Harry told him. “I might’ve made tomorrow’s
“Because the alternative is showing up with a cock in my hands,” Harry huffed, trying not to imagine the looks
The wizard shuffled some papers around on his desk. “And as we said in each of those memos, we’ll contact you when we have more information regarding…” He frowned down at the paper.
Harry snorted. It read a bit like those stupid informational posters that plastered the walls at St Mungo’s, adverts for the Knight Bus and five helpful tips to recognize Dragon Pox. He idly wondered whose job it was to print up informational pamphlets and instruction cards, and whether the staff at St Mungo’s and Accoutrements had sent off to the same person to have theirs done. He flipped the card over, and found a list of instructions for activating the cock’s various functions.
There was still bickering, of course. And Malfoy poking a bit of fun at him. But it was edging closer and closer to the sort of bickering and fun-poking that Harry’s friends did with him.
Reluctantly, Harry clambered to his feet and trailed along behind him into MLE and the briefing room.
"You already have." Harry whined, rocking his hips forward in Malfoy's slack grasp.
Harry shifted the box and paperwork, and took her hand and gave it a shake. "Harry."
“Fourth, please,” Harry said. “Thank you.”
“I can’t wait to hear what Seamus thinks of this,” was all Ron said as he attempted to stifle his laughter.
“Lucky for you, you won’t even have to leave the building. It’s in the Atrium.”
Malfoy laughed, giving the cock on the table a sharp flick. "This one's different, at least."
Malfoy's smirk faded into an expression of bewilderment. "Pav-what?"
,” Malfoy said, “did you
he was right not to trust, started whistling 'God Save the Queen' at a shocking decibel, while the Vicious Cockmonster started to throb along in time.
Malfoy snickered. “
A penis that was fucking with him, Harry, specifically, as it was laid out neatly at the Ministry Apparition Point. Right off the Atrium.
“Touch it, Potter,” Malfoy said, thrusting the cock at him.
"Alright, now you're just scary."
“Oh for the love of—” Harry muttered, then snarled off a Stasis Charm to keep his lunch warm, dumped the stupid arsehole vibrating cock into the nearest Containment Receptacle, and stormed off to St Mungo’s.
"What? Why would I be doing this on purpose?"
Then the day got worse when Seamus poked his head in with a "heard you were in today" and asked him for lunch and saw three penises on his desk where there had been two. And then he laughed as he made Harry tell him the full story.
But if he did continue, if he took off his robes, if he let Malfoy get those long fingers under his clothes, he'd likely face a future of… he didn't even know. Piss taking, definitely. Malfoy being an arse pretty much any time he opened his mouth. Not to mention that if Malfoy thought cocks were an appropriate courting gift, his birthday was going to be very interesting.
"But the flirting. And my cock. How?"
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed a box from the pile. It had a star on the top and “Converse” printed in large letters on the side. “Er,” he said. “This is…”
But to his surprise, Healer Reynolds cast one single solitary spell at the cock, then filled out the top page of form 68-J, initialed page two, then flipped all the way to the final page and ticked off two boxes before initialing again. He shuffled the papers together, tapped them on the exam table to straighten them, and handed them back to Harry. All of thirty seconds had elapsed.
Malfoy was looking annoyed when he walked into the exam room, but his face positively lit up when he saw Harry waiting for him. "Oh, wonderful! I was just thinking I needed to see another dick today."
Malfoy paused in his writing mid-word to give Harry a flat look, then went back to filling out the form. His handwriting was still the same precise cursive Harry remembered from Hogwarts. Finishing up the first page, Malfoy flipped it over and set it to the side, then took out his wand and flicked it at the box. The lid flipped back, the tissue paper folded open, and Malfoy glanced down at the specimen and did an almost comical double-take. His expression did an odd sort of twitch before settling into a bland professionalism.
Harry found himself not at all surprised. Pansy seemed to know all of the people who took the most pleasure from terrible things happening to him. "I hate you."
Harry pulled back. "Flowers are a reasonable present to send to someone you fancy. Booze. Tickets to Quidditch."
"Is it supposed to do that?"
“I am jealous. Incredibly jealous,” Harry said. Inside the box, the cock stopped buzzing. That made him nervous. “Well. Best get this back to the office. Enjoy your holiday. And, er, sorry about the tea.”
“Nah,” Seamus said. “Harvey’s quite comfortable where he is.”
“What?” Ginny asked, looking around the table.
And Pansy wasn't so bad, except for the part where she and Hermione would spend all evening trading increasingly elaborate insults as the drinking progressed, but Pansy sometimes also meant Malfoy, and Harry was feeling right about done with Malfoy for the day.
He’d only been waiting in the exam room for a minute or so when Malfoy slammed in, looking tired and grouchy. His cheeks and nose were pink with sunburn.
Then he mentally kicked himself for the thought, because if anything was guaranteed to make his life go wrong, it was thinking it couldn't possibly get any worse. He shot the penis a glare, just in case, before rolling it into the Receptacle.
, with a new cock in my hand. And you fucking planned it all, the flirting, everything else, for what? Just to fuck with me?"
“You’re honestly trying to tell me that you Aurors are so concerned with being professional?” Pansy asked, rolling her eyes. “Please. I have met Finnegan, you know.”
“You always make the front page,” Malfoy pointed out dryly. “But at least this way they’d have to blur out the hand holding it.”
"Nope," Seamus said with a grin as he set the box back down. "All yours, Auror Potter."
"You too?"
Harry snatched the quill away from him. “At least you’re upfront about it.”
comes up with will be even worse.”
"Why are you asking me?" Malfoy turned wide eyes on him.
"Come in," Harry called, expecting Rosemary, clutching a cup of tea and bringing him gossip.
certain that Malfoy was fucking with him.
be able to set foot into St Mungo's again."
Harry needed different friends.
Seamus leaned slightly, before he reached around Harry and stole another biscuit. "Nah. You're nowhere near closing this case. It's fine."
Hermione sighed. “Well. We can talk later, I suppose,” she said with a nod to Harry. And yes, they’d definitely be having words later if Harry had his way about it. “I’d best get these to where they’re supposed to be.” She gave Harry a purposeful smile. “Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll take care of everything. You needn’t worry about this case for another second.”
welcome to the department. Though I have to give you credit, you make my tea better than Twycross ever did."
And oh, Harry did not like the look on that man’s face. Not one bit.
When Harry got the memo from Rosemary on Tuesday morning, alerting him to a new cock at the British Museum, he pondered just leaving it there. The case was
read the card.
When he entered, all eyes turned to him. "Have a seat, Potter." Kingsley gestured to one of the empty chairs around the long table. Harry crept forward, sitting beside Rosemary and as far away from the fuming Bartram as possible. Kingsley's expression revealed nothing, but Robards was red-faced and Rosemary was pale and clenching her fingers against the arm of her chair.
"Hm," Malfoy said, leaning down. He gave it a little prod with his wand. The penis continued to lie there. He ran the tip of his wand up the underside from base to tip.
And then he opened his stupid git mouth. "Have fun with my cock. I know it's not as good as the real thing, but it will give you something to entertain yourself with while I'm at work."
When he arrived at his cubicle, he groaned. There was a caseboard on his back wall, covering his poster of the Appleby Arrows, and on it were pictures of cocks. Seven of them. Filling the top half of the board. Each neatly listed in order found, and then numbered, labeled, and with locations marked.
Something like his cock. His cock, which twitched at the thought. He lifted his sheet and stared at it, half-hard after the stupid dream about stupid sodding Malfoy.
“What is the point of my life?” Harry sighed.
"Debatable."
Ron, the bastard, snickered.
Ron cleared his throat pointedly. “Not the time, Hermione,” he murmured, making a shoddy attempt to use a cough to disguise his words.
Malfoy returned his attention to the matter at hand. He briskly filled out another page of paperwork, then took out his wand again and turned to the cock in the box.
And at that, Rosemary snorted. And then Harry looked at Rosemary. And that was the end, because the fact that someone had actually sent a

he’d be retrieving. She’d told him to take a shoebox, so presumably whatever Splinched bit he’d been sent to collect would fit inside. Or, Rosemary had made a point of mentioning how the box was charmed, maybe it had some sort of extension spell on it, undetectable or otherwise?
"Potter!"
Well, that and Tuesdays. But he didn't want to spend his weekend thinking about Tuesdays. Harry didn’t even like spending his Tuesdays thinking about Tuesdays.
“—for Acute Preservation of Accidentally Splinched Specimens. Yes, Potter, I am familiar with it,” Malfoy cut in. He flicked his wand again and the specimen rose neatly from its packaging, hovering in midair. He blinked at the box, and reached out to close the lid. “Why are there holes in this?”
"Is that supposed to give us more information, mate?"
"Hm," he said again, sounding for all the world like he was contemplating some intense philosophical question or contemplating some intriguing medical mystery.
It was a relief when Malfoy took off his gloves and glowered at it. "All right, Potter. It's all yours."
"Hm?" Malfoy turned to Harry. "It

Harry glanced back over his shoulder, her expression seemed to be caught somewhere between exasperated and amused. He smirked, shrugging lightly, and rounded his desk and sat in his chair. "Active case. I keep other bits of evidence on my desk. And it's not like they're
Harry had barely caught his breath when Malfoy gave his hair a light tug. He didn't want to move. Malfoy's shoulder was surprisingly comfortable for being so bony. Finally, with a chuckle, Malfoy wiped his hand on Harry's shirt before sliding his fingers under Harry's chin and tipping his head up. He gave Harry a heart-stoppingly sweet smile, and Harry found himself grinning back like a lovesick fool.
Malfoy laughed at that, loudly at first, and then a lingering chuckle as he set the penis back down on the table and grabbed the stack of forms. "All right. Yes I am, rather. But your face..."
Malfoy sighed as he came into the exam room. "You again? Didn't I just see you in here? Taking up residence?"
Peter the Penis. The Vicious Cockmonster. Harvey Porter. Willy the Weiner. BDSM Cock. Vindaloo. Sparklepenis. And a note charmed to the frame indicating all the room on the 'Bottom Half of the board for More Cock!!'
“Oh Potter,” Malfoy said, looking vaguely pained. “You didn’t really, did you?”

does it make?” Draco flapped a hand at him.  “My house was torn down.”
“Thanks.” Harry took one as well.  “You looked beautiful.”
Harry stood there, trying to think of a way to tell Draco that Narcissa ended up in Janus Thickey, until he realized that it didn’t matter.  It didn’t matter to Draco.  Maybe he’d have to spend a little less money to buy her bonbons, but—scratch that.  He’d
“She loves you,” Harry said anyway.  “So much.  She could have defeated Voldemort as well—that’s how much she loved you.”
“Quit what?”  Malfoy swaggered toward him.  He fucking
Harry could feel himself flush red.
The nose came down.  “I’m not talking about the
Harry watched Malfoy help Nyala and the other younger ones in Combat Two; he watched the way Malfoy moved, with liquid grace, flicking off spells arrogantly and almost absently as he easily bested every sparring partner. Worst of all was watching Malfoy in Sorcery (Ritual, Soul, and Spiritual Magic), where Malfoy studied hard and paid strict attention and was a model student in almost every way, except for his marks, which—whenever Malfoy was asked to do any practical demonstration—were dismal.
“Oh.”
Teddy knew the Auror Academy did not teach music. They’d talked about the fact that it didn’t—Teddy had an interest in composition; Harry had been hoping Teddy would study that, or something else peaceful that did not involve politics or anti-non-mag bias or getting killed. “Right,” Harry said. “Those battle guitar courses, where we destroy the dark arts with the power of song—those are always our most popular courses.”
Draco looked at him, startled, and then his lips twitched in what Harry recognized as a smile.  “Accio owl treats.”  A drawstring bag floated over to him.
“I thought cake-less birthdays were the new fad,” said Teddy.
“I don’t . . .” Harry gulped. How could this be happening? With
Parkinson nodded, and Malfoy went on, “Only don’t speak to me. It breaks my concentration to have someone in my ear if others are speaking.”
“On Malfoy?” Harry asked.
“Yeah. Right. Because I haven’t dealt with my trauma, or whatever?” Harry pushed himself out of the chair. “So what, if I just deal with it, it would go away?”
“Yes, Harry.”
Even his expression was the same as Hermione’s and Ron’s had been.
Harry ate his sandwich, which was cool and light and good, and drank his liverwort lemonade, which was amazing. The conversation went on for a while, in circles and inroads and then back out and over crossroads, until the crowd and heat and subdued noise outside the bubble became too much. “I’ll be back in a bit,” Harry told Teddy in an undertone.
Hermione was dancing with Proudfoot, no doubt hatching plots against Fudge, and Ron was dancing with Gardenia Greengrass. The things that man did for love. The Greengrasses were loathsome, but Hermione needed their influence and was not above using Ron to get it. Meanwhile, Ron would do anything for Hermione, and also he was fit, so perhaps Gardenia didn’t mind.
“It’s not like that.”
“Let me show you the chopping spell again.  Just to be sure we’re safe,” Draco said, his hand slipping off, body turning slightly to show Harry the spell.
“That makes no sense. Besides, you still owe me a knit scarf.” When Malfoy looked at him in confusion, Harry explained, “Last year. When we first spoke about removing your Mark.”
“I meant with the hot one.” Vinicius crooked his finger in the hot one’s direction.
“Sorry,” said Teddy. “I was thinking about him.”
“When?”  Pulling away, Draco sniffled.  “Next year?”
“I love watching a big man like you post his pretty cunt onto another man’s cock,” Draco said. “Come on, darling. Fuck yourself onto me.”
“Brilliant,” Malfoy said, snapping his fingers again. “Are we sure we want to enchant them? Mark, you’ve said holding magic items might be intimidating for some non-magicals—”
“Of course, I remember.
“She only wanted to get away from the lot of us, I imagine,” Harry said. “We weren’t good enough for her then.”
Malfoy just waggled the box, which, when Harry opened it, seemed to hold an assortment of tiny pies.
“All right,” Harry said. “I’m going to fix all the wards, make sure nothing malicious got out.”
“Boggarts!” Spragg finally lifted his voice, making Harry jump a little. “It’s so
“How could you tell?” Mrs. Mulpepper said, her puffy red eyes curious.  “You didn’t even distil it!”
“Well,” Harry said, setting down the jar of memories for them to review.  “It wasn’t much of a reunion.”
. On the bloody cover.
The next morning, however, Draco was gone.
When Harry asked why Teddy was his godson, Andromeda told him about Remus Lupin and her daughter, Nymphadora Tonks.  “They both died in the war,” she said.
Harry watched as Malfoy cast spells on his hands to protect them, then thrust them through the magic shield charms to open the bottle.  The pink powder poofed everywhere, just as it had done to Harry, but afterwards it settled down into the invisible curve of the shield charm.  Malfoy cast a few spells at the pile of pink, then funnelled the powder back into the bottle with his wand.  Dispelling the shields with another wave of his wand, Malfoy took the bottle and began to run what Harry now recognized as diagnostics.
Ron raised a brow. “Throw himself at your feet and declare undying devotion?”
, Draco had said the night before, when Harry had still been a child.
“Yes,” Harry said.
Six days after leaving Tailored Tinctures for the last time, Harry was getting worried.  Maybe Draco just didn’t want to see him, but maybe something had happened.  Maybe something had gone wrong with the cure.  Maybe Draco was lying there, unconscious, waiting for the final year and he was just—never going to wake up, and Harry would get another horrible letter about Draco hating himself and sacrificing himself for Harry.  Again.
Harry woke late Sunday morning from an extremely distressing sex dream in which Malfoy touched Harry with blue-gloved hands and each time Harry got close to coming, Malfoy would stop and make notes about his performance on a thick stack of forms, nodding thoughtfully to himself as he did.
Not that he expected Malfoy to ever beg for mercy. It didn't seem a very
At the sound of his voice, the flowers rustled ominously. Harry clenched his jaw and stared resolutely at the ceiling. The witch with the Venomous Tentacula peered curiously at the bouquet, but Harry didn’t make eye contact, and she exited the lift before she could ask him about it.
at it, and nodding when whatever he saw on it had vanished. "I suppose that's true. You always were much better at keeping your food in your mouth than Weasley."
"Cheer up, Potter." Malfoy gave him something that actually looked like a genuine smile. "We'll always have St Mungo's.”
Of course Ginny's kick landed.
"What?" Ginny looked across to where Ron was once again laughing and Hermione carefully studying her glass. Then there was a thump, and Ron jumped, reaching for his leg.
Harry held out the stack of parchment as Malfoy carefully deposited it back in the box. "68-J? It's not a Splinching."
Harry made sure he was at work on time Friday morning, bearing a mochaccino and muffin for Rosemary. He caught her mid-yawn, and she waggled her fingers at him before stretching a hand out for the coffee. "Offering accepted," she grinned. "How's Hogwarts?"
"Yes," Harry said flatly, cutting off any further rehashing of those particular events. "That."
Harry sighed, crossing the department and taking the stack from her. "Thanks. No, really."
"You're just being spiteful now."
For now, at least.
“I can’t take it back like that,” Harry said. He didn’t want to take it back at all.
“Mishandling evidence!” Seamus said, tossing the cock back to Harry, who replaced it in line on the edge of his desk.
as reasons for it. It probably wasn’t a coincidence that when the new fountain went up, all the other figures were identical to the ones that’d stood there previously, except for the wizard. The new wizard’s face bore a striking resemblance to Bartram.
Ron and Seamus would doubtless be by later in the morning to see it. Put it through its paces. Harry snickered to himself as he grabbed his quill and slid the first page of parchment closer.
Splinchings spent nearly as much time
Malfoy snorted and snatched the stack of paperwork away from Harry, flipping angrily to the first page. “It’s a sex toy, Potter. Do you think that thing is in any condition to be shoved up someone’s arse?”
When they’d both shattered to a climax, Harry kissed him and then met his eye. “I love you too. I understand. I’m ready.”
He just stopped himself from demanding if she was trying to hurt him. It wasn’t a question he needed to ask. He knew the answer: Luna didn’t try to hurt people, incomprehensible as that was to him.
More reason to be grateful for the Borgia Princess. She would distract the Slytherins—and one never knew. He doubted Salazar Slytherin’s descendant would care that he’d been a Death Eater. Perhaps she’d come up with some fiendishly clever strategy that depended on winning him over. He could hope.
“Certainly not: I’ve had enough accusations from you to last a lifetime.”
“So I’ve gathered,” Draco snarled. “But under the circumstances it seemed rather risk free, and she asked it as a favor.”
, so I guess her magic is good. She doesn’t talk much.”
He closed his eyes and leaned in, just brushing his lips against Harry’s. The reaction was instantaneous—like adding the catalyst of a potion. Potter practically exploded, gripping the back of Draco’s head, yanking on his hair almost painfully, to turn his head so he could practically devour his mouth.
Draco steeled himself. “Your highness,” he murmured as he bent over Princess Duessa’s hand, a model of perfect pure-blood breeding. Nero Borgia held out his hand to shake, so Draco adjusted smoothly, “Sir, thank you for inviting me.”
“See what?”
“Please, please do.” That was all it took: what seemed like a second later, Harry was balls deep, thrusting like there was no tomorrow.
But in a few key moments, Draco had acted to help Potter—or failed to act to harm him—and apparently for a Gryffindor sap that meant they’d testify publicly to keep you and your mother out of Azkaban, give several interviews to the Quibbler and the Prophet detailing how mother had saved his life, and generally go to considerable trouble to stop them from paying any price whatsoever.  Absolutely vintage Gryffindor logic.
“Speak for yourselves.” Blaise didn’t even bother to look up from an appallingly garish muggle magazine, fittingly named
Draco was actually a week ahead on his assignments, so it felt especially pointless to be missing dinner to “study,” but he forced his way through the Arithmancy Study Guide, and began the first sample test. The problems did not strike him as especially challenging. All those years he’d had to listen to seventh-years whinging about how impossible N.E.W.T.s were: but the last year had taught him a ruthless focus. Anything he needed to learn, he did—thoroughly and the first time. Another gift from his dear aunt.
He was trying to convince himself to find a carrel and start when he heard that haunting singsong say, “Hi Draco.”
. The best artist at Hogwarts spends his afternoons taking commissions for images of Fury and Bez. And now it appears she got her parents to travel from Italy to employ their personal publicist to further the relationship of two of her friends.

fall out of favor. When the Traditionalist faction comes back into power, we will be much better off if the Minister is the girl who saw the potential of Moonriders, who is friends with Luna and Lucy, who has built a longstanding relationship with you so you can meet on terms of trust. Otherwise odds are it will be Theo Nott, who is not someone you could ever ally with. Do you understand what I’m trying to explain to you?”
“Why are you so upset about this?”
year, had scored the highest overall marks since Dumbledore took them about two centuries ago. Weasley seemed to be following the family trend of skipping N.E.W.T.s entirely, to enter as a partner into his brother’s apparently quite successful joke shop.
Duessa Borgia raised her brows. “My goodness. I see the reports didn’t exaggerate. Is he always this hot-headed?” It could literally have been Pansy provoking him, and Potter never seemed able to keep his cool for ten fucking seconds. Next thing he’d have his wand out, which would no doubt bring the Borgia guards rushing in, etc. etc.
Pansy on the other hand… What rotten luck.  Astoria was going to think she’d strung her along, and generations of Greengrasses had made an art out of holding grudges. Pansy brazened it out of course, smirking at Astoria like she’d been deliberately mocking her, but Draco could feel something like despair encroaching on his friend.
The next day should prove amusing.
years were excluded from Quidditch and it wasn’t like he was going to join the Gobstones Club, so he stalked off to the library to pull the Official Ministry Study Guides for Arithmancy and Runes, supposedly the two hardest tests.
Harry Potter, the chosen one, was blowing off his N.E.W.T.s but he made time for Fury Moonrider, time he mostly spent lying on the floor dreaming up lurid sex acts he and Draco could perform once they had the club room to themselves.
She darted away then, which wasn’t like her, but given that Draco practically collapsed against the wall, he understood the impulse. He felt naked, raw, and there was a bizarre comfort in the knowledge that Luna felt the same—that they’d shared that.
“Interesting!”
There was so much
After a moment, he said, “There was no question that I was going to be in Slytherin, and not just because of my family connection. We all just knew. The night before I started Hogwarts, my mother told me I should always have my eye out for anyone in the House who seemed to wield particular influence, who was gifted when it came to politics or power, and I should make a point of befriending them.”
Draco threw his hands up. “Heaven forfend,” which Potter thought hilarious. He was still laughing as they entered the Great Hall, like he and Draco were the best of mates.
Of course, he felt the gnawings of doubt over his strategy the moment Potter arrived. He was barely through the door, when he snapped, “What are they doing here? This wasn’t part of the deal.”
“I don’t know—a dozen maybe.”
More giggling—because the concept of falling for him was so very droll.  “Draco, Veela power can’t change someone’s sexuality. Surely you know that.”
A bizarre idea took hold. It was beyond daft, likely unworkable, but he found that once his brain had seized on it, it wouldn’t let go.
Draco tore his arm away and shoved Potter back. “It’s not a spell, and it’s not your concern,” he mumbled. Forcing himself to at least pretend to be calmer, he said in his most clipped tones. “You’ve been invited by a member so you’ve the right to stay if that’s what you want, but all guests must obey the club rules, and if you won’t then leave.”
spell to encompass Pansy and Blaise—thank dearest aunt Bellatrix for his new skill with casting wordless, and often wandless, spells.  To see the bubble of avoidance surrounding them, you’d think it was made of lead. Despite Pansy’s optimism, Astoria didn’t acknowledge them—he suspected that Pansy had found her alone in the carriage. Surrounded by other students, she was not willing to deign even a nod.
“Oh, are you showing your friends your Veela side?” Luna, just in time to cause yet more unintentional mayhem. “Isn’t it beautiful,” she sighed. “Oh, hi Harry.”
“Not that I know of, not with you,” Draco said, “but if I ever say “stop,” then everything needs to stop right away.”
“You were eleven years old!”
Duessa looked expectantly at Draco, who quickly said, “We’d be very grateful,” and managed to elbow Harry into a grudging, “What did you have in mind?”
But rebuilding Slytherin’s reputation would be a slow process, taking years not weeks. They would be lucky if they had even days. And given that the Slytherins inhabited the actual world instead of luxuriating in fantasyland, Draco had no doubt they were grimly calculating the odds (very high) that the public would find some way to blame them when the conflagration hit.
“Nothing like that.” If he’d one that good it would be worth a fortune—possibly enough to let Mother reopen the manor. Potter just raised his eyebrows as if waiting for an answer. This was truly the most bizarre conversation they’d ever had. “Fine, it’s a
He wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that he enjoyed the club meeting even more with the Slytherins there than he had without them. But there was a comfort in the presence of people whose behavior he could predict, whose motives made sense. And they allowed him to indulge in a little cruel satisfaction at his Housemates’ confusion without feeling like he was hurting those who wouldn’t try to hurt him back.
But this wasn’t the old days, when Slytherins would have treated an event like this as an opportunity to sabotage and humiliate not just other houses but their own Housemates. Draco had deliberately crafted a strategy to maximize the benefit to the whole group—even including the Hufflepuffs—and trusted that their weeks in Moonriders had taught everyone present why it was the superior approach.
Draco felt a hand on his and looked to see Harry next to him. Draco squeezed it back and then closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against Harry’s. He didn’t want to lose this.
Everyone thought the Boy Wonder was so bloody nice and honorable, but Draco had the scars to prove that Potter could hit back plenty hard when provoked.  And why did Potter always feel so obliged to be “nice” to everyone, anyway?
All things considered, Draco recovered quickly from the appalling image of Salazar Slytherin’s descendant taking her seat at the Hufflepuff table.  Lucy Borgia had been a consideration in his strategy for less than three hours.  It was no great sacrifice to watch those hopes die.
He turned back to his own table in time to catch Blaise drawling, “I suppose someone could try to seduce her. Only child, and her parents have to be worth a billion galleons at the minimum.”
For the first minute, Draco was too overwhelmed to even think about what Potter had asked, but then he felt a growing sensation that somehow mixed coolness with white-hot lust, the one he associated with the Veela power. He forced all of his concentration into keeping it on the leash.
. And Draco would know, since his own fantasies dated back more years than he’d care to admit. Draco nudged Potter to let him up, wondering if they could convince the Room of Requirement to produce a large tub—he was feeling deliciously relaxed and could think of nothing nicer than to luxuriate in a warm bath with Potter—Harry.
Draco turned away, which of course Blaise took as invitation to crawl into bed behind him and cuddle his hair.  “It’s alright, sweetheart, you can tell Blaise,” he cooed.
“Hermione Granger,” Harry said to Duessa. “She detests Draco, but she won’t want a blow-up.”
“What club?” he said sharply.
“To prove what fucking great shag you are?”
That night at dinner, Blaise took one look at him and smirked. “Pansy, pay up.”
For once, Draco couldn’t even get annoyed.
is that you have to think of your happiest memory.” More unimpressed stares. Draco wanted to roll his eyes. Presumably, he’d been slightly more confident with Dumbledore’s Army, but the Chosen One was going to have to do better if he intended to teach the best that Slytherin House could offer. Potter seemed to realize the problem and changed tacks: “So I presume you know the incantation. Let’s have a go.”
Those were his closest friends—what the rest of Slytherin would say, let alone Gryffindor, was fuel for an entire new genre of nightmares, these destined to come true, since he could hardly expect to keep his attendance at the meetings secret forever. But it seemed he was trapped on the course he’d set—rather like a car at Gringotts there was no getting off until he’d reached his destination.
“Well I would if I could cast one,” he snarled.
The image he produced was extraordinary: the two heroes on a moonlit beach, strolling along the shore, with the waves lapping at their feet and a bird swooping and rising in the background, the loop smoother than in a professional photograph. It was clear that Antonio was a major talent—Draco would have wondered at his presence at Moonriders, but art was not a respected field in Slytherin, so perhaps the alliance offered by Persephone seemed attractive.
“Finally, something that isn’t green,” Potter grunted, and pulled Draco over and pushed him down so he could climb on top, thrusting their cocks together. Draco tried to reach for Potter’s trousers, but Potter caught his wrists and pinned them. He gave Draco a deep, filthy kiss and then sat up on top of him. “Please tell me I can get my mouth on that cock of yours—before I go mad.”
His three pupils did show a slight response in the form of widened eyes when Harry cast his own, the famous,
“How many times?”
In keeping with its new purpose, the Room of Requirement had been kitted out with piles of cushions covered in a shimmering purple silk. One wall was now illusioned to show a night’s sky with a full moon hovering on the horizon, while the others contained portraits of their hero and his bandmates. There was every imaginable drawing and scrap-book supply along with a music-player next to a full wall containing every recording ever made by
“Camouflage,” Draco murmured.
“What the fuck was that? You’re using some spell on me?”
Of course Potter was outraged. “Someone could have been killed!”
Once everyone was present, he said, “I’ll see ensembles, now—you have five minutes.” Boys and girls scurried to their respective dorm rooms. Draco strode to his own room to review his options, though he very much doubted that his ability to make exquisitely fined-tuned wardrobe choices would improve his chances of impressing the Borgias.
“Blood hell!” Potter shouted. Draco hummed over him, making small pumping motions with his entire mouth, that elicited more shouts. Now that he had Harry good and hooked, he let the Veela power off the rein.
“Whatever you say, Darling, but if you are planning a general campaign of seduction, make sure you save him for last.”
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the irony that apparently he’d restored Potter’s sense of purpose in life. The Chosen One was all bristling suspicion and hostility again. Draco realized it was partially his own fault since he’d taken advantage of his recent election to Vice President of the Moonriders to add to the club rules a strict injunction against speaking about the club to outsiders. So now he’d created a MYSTERY, which of course was not an acceptable state of things for Harry fucking Potter, who seemed to think he had an inviolable right to know every bloody secret at Hogwarts, no matter how private or irrelevant.
He almost wished the spell had blocked his ears, because for the next 15 minutes he was forced to listen to the useless rantings typical of powerless people. Apparently, during Potions that day, all the third-year Slytherin cauldrons had been tampered with to explode foul smelling oil. This was no Weasley Twin prank: the oil proved caustic, burning through textbooks, clothing and supplies that in their reduced post-war circumstances, many Slytherins could ill afford to replace. More seriously, an unlucky Muggleborn Gryffindor got a drop on their skin and ended up going into seizures from some kind of allergic reaction and was still recovering.
“Became friends because you happened to sit in the same carriage on the Hogwarts Express? Shared a dorm room? I was taught to look for useful alliances and cultivate them. I was trying to do that with you the day we met.”
. Thank Merlin, a Slytherin required nothing of the kind. The brat had his wand out in an instant and shot off a stinging hex—only to have it rebound and hit him. Draco let him suffer a few seconds and then wandlessly undid it.
“Explain yourself!” Pansy snapped.
Draco found himself struggling for his self-control as certain physical signs that had not revealed themselves for Luna bloody Lovegood now chose to manifest.
He tried to pull away, but Harry grabbed his wrist. “Wait, Malfoy. Draco wait!”
Blaise made an unconvincing front at holding out before dropping all pretense.  “Oh alright,” he said as if they’d threatened him with the Cruciatus curse.  “Well, now that you-know-who is gone, I’ve heard from a very reliable source, that His Royal Highness, Prince Nero of Borgia, is allowing his daughter to finally attend Hogwarts.  She’ll be in the seventh year.“
“Are you out of your mind?”
Draco wished he could curse the daylights out of the perpetrators, but sanity prevailed. The former Death Eater getting involved would escalate matters irrevocably, and most likely lead to hysterical public outcry accompanied by blaring headlines for Rita Skeeter “exclusives,” and a fast track to Azkaban.
descended on the school and demanded they send out Potter, whom everyone with a brain knew was going to walk out there anyway.
in his voice. Draco felt the Veela power adapt to it—filling him with a sense of belonging, of connection. He
“I’m aware of the effects of Acromantula venom, Potter!”
Draco turned to face the person who inspired more regrets than anyone else at Hogwarts. “Love--, er, Luna, uh, how, how. . . are you doing?” Good lord, he sounded like Potter.
“Because it’s permanent.”
“Next to your father then, Death Eater?”
, but he didn’t—he couldn’t. It felt like he’d be claiming too much for himself, though Luna hadn’t hesitated to claim him as a friend only moments before. But that was Luna. It was not in him to assert that their accounts were somehow balanced—they weren’t. They’d probably never be.
And to their credit, once his Housemates were able to identify a comprehensible motive for their presence at the Moonriders meeting, they turned their attention as any proper Slytherin would to working the situation to their advantage. It was clear to any idiot that the way to win over Lucy Borgia was to win over her friends, so the young Slytherins applied their considerable intellects to solving the puzzle of how to make friends with a Hufflepuff. And they quickly discovered, as Draco had, that by far the easiest method was to join in their celebration of Fury Moonrider.
“I might have had some help from Melody. But it’s all true.”
Potter knew what Draco was doing, but he’d lost control. “You little…. Fuck!” he let out a loud groan, and threw his head back. He tried to pump his hips, but Draco wrapped his arms around his waist to hold him in place. “Shit!”
Potter was being cautious enough that he must suspect something. He could be stunningly oblivious, but he’d sniffed out right away that the explanation Draco had given him about the
Draco was aware that he owed the Borgia princess a debt, though he had trouble saying exactly for what. He spent more time arguing with her than any other person on the planet, but when she used the phrase “Draco and I are best friends,” he couldn’t contradict her. She was Luna’s girlfriend, which counted for something, and whether or intentionally or not, the club she created had benefited the Slytherins—and benefited him, though again he’d have trouble saying precisely how.
“Galleons no doubt,” scoffed Rutherford.
But if Borgia would strike the blow, it was obvious at a glance that his wife would give the order. Duessa Borgia was unquestionably a beauty, though in the rather severe style common among the pureblood aristocracy. She was dressed at the absolute pitch of fashion, and those elegant, discreet jewels on her neck and wrists were worth a million galleons at the minimum. She gave away nothing at all in her polite smile to Lucy’s assembled friends, which was in itself revealing. She was exactly what Draco would have expected in Salazar Slytherin’s descendant: shrewd, intelligent and ruthless.
When she turned around Potter had his wand in hand and was shaking with rage, like he wanted to be sure the Slytherins knew exactly how to provoke him.
Draco just shrugged, secretly flattered that Potter seemed to find his spell extraordinary.
The shaking had quieted to the occasional shuddery gasp. “I’m not one of your rescues,” Draco said quietly. “We need to have that clear if this is going to go further.”
He released Potter’s waist so he could slip his hand between his legs to massage his balls, sneaking a finger just far enough to threaten his hole. Potter practically howled and came explosively. Unconquered territory, then. Draco drank him down without the slightest hesitation. Potter knew he was being challenged and his look promised retribution. He pulled Draco up to straddle his lap and kissed him, giving his ass a hard slap. Draco wished his shudder hadn’t been quite so obvious.
