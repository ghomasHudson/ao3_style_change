Ron walked in and glanced at the table, he was slightly dirty and looked like he hadn’t showered in weeks, but that was typical Ron. “Morning Harry, you slept in today.” Ron said with a slight laugh, he sat down next to Harry and stole a piece of Harry’s toast.
Molly leant in and wrapped Ron in a tight hug, “it’s alright sweetie, we all make mistakes, no harm was done.”
He had been working tirelessly for many months, trying to unite the houses so that he could claim the honour and respect of ending the silly feud, but nope, all that time and effort was wasted due to one major event appearing out of nowhere. Well, he knew it was not a waste of time, but it was still somewhat disheartening to see the entire school put on a united front that was genuine and not a sheer display.
Draco sniffed and focused back on the previous discussion, seeing as Crabbe and Goyle looked more confused than usual. “Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them. You’d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.”
Harry scoffed but decided to remain quiet and allow the others to continue the discussion, which was rather obvious by the body language of each of them.
Harry made a soft noise of annoyance, his eyes closing slowly as he tried to will away his irritation. He retracted his bare feet from the lake, his toes wriggling as he shook his feet, drying them slightly. He closed his diary and turned around, staring at the animal that had been trying to sneak up on him with an eye roll. He remained silent for a brief moment, considering what he could say to the creature, knowing it would have to be good and witty, which he had been lacking lately.
Harry couldn’t help but let out a slight laugh, “hello Draco, what brings you all the way over here?”
“Fantastic,” said Mrs Weasley, moving everyone into the kitchen. “Going to another person’s house and expecting them to be accepting of that… Would anyone like some tea before Miss Granger comes?”
The small second of weakness he just showed was enough for it to evolve from two people to four. He sneered at all four of them, twisting his head to sneer at the two sitting behind him.
“What makes you think that I’d put you on the team if you weren’t good?” said Harry, chuckling. “I want to win and that’s that. I wouldn’t put us down a Chaser if I really didn’t think you could play the position.”
“Did you hear about how Nott called him his lord?” asked Ron, looking excited. “In the middle of the library and then – and then he attacked a Gryffindor!”
“It seems pretty cool, making things float,” said Dudley softly before he gasped. “Don’t tell mum or dad I said that!”
Lily almost jumped out of her skin when she heard a sneeze. “Are you alright Harry?” she instantly said and rushed to his side with a box of tissues. “Not another cold…”
“The book isn’t illegal, Granger, it’s simply discouraged,” said Harry. “The book was written for creatures by creatures, so the Ministry, who hate creatures, hate the book on the same principle. They see it and they’ll destroy it.”
“But nothing,” said Harry. “Stop doing all the research for Longbottom while he’s off having fun with Weasley. He willingly put his name into the Goblet – it’s impossible to fool it or tamper with it. He needs to live up to his actions and not have people jump in front of things for him. Consequences and all that. Anyway, Granger, wasn’t it you that said the whole point of the Tournament was international magical cooperation? We’re cooperating.”
Regardless, it was nice to know that the stairs creaked and if he desired to leave the house, he would have to actually sneak. He found it very kind of Weasley to show him how to get around the house without making a sound.
“STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT HAD GONE…” Mrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the Hall were swivelling around to see who had received the Howler and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen. “… LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND NEVILLE COULD BOTH HAVE DIED… ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED, YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.”
“Why wouldn’t you,” said Harry instantly, not phrasing it as a question. “I personally have such a high ambition to be greater than everyone else, to prove that I’m not just a regular person and that I can do anything I want and do it better than anyone else. I want people to respect what I say, to treat me with the respect I deserve. I don’t want to be ignored and cast off to the side as if I were some reject. If I have intelligence, which means I’ll have power, people won’t question what I say.”
Harry did his homework, which was really his lesson work, as he waited to be given the all clear for him to leave the hospital wing. He really wanted to attend the Boggart lesson which was later today and he had to put on his brave face for Madam Pomfrey, who assumed something was still bothering him.
be a werewolf. This is why he preferred his mother. She at least put him first and not second to some crazed beast that attacked him and the Minister for Magic. Even if the thing was alive, it would be dead or in Azkaban for stepping foot on Hogwarts and for attacking a student and the Minister for Magic.
He blinked when he felt the train jerk and then a loud whistle. He wanted to sigh in relief and mutter about the fact that the train had finally left, but it looked like no one else shared his desire to leave the station. Something about the situation with the trains colliding felt wrong to him and he had no idea how to word it.
Harry couldn’t help but agree with Tom’s statement. His mind whirled and he couldn’t think of anyone who would dare blackmail a Malfoy and get away with it. It wasn’t prestige or money that made people fearful of pushing the Malfoy’s, it was the fact that Draco’s mother was a Black and everyone fears Black’s, at least those that went into Slytherin.
Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile and he reached into his robes, pulling out a chocolate frog. “Thanks, Ron… I’ll think I’ll have this… then go to bed or something.” He ate the frog and glanced at the card. “Dumbledore again, he was the first one I ever –” he stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. “I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here – listen to this:
Screams started again, believing it to be an attack, but were drowned out by a familiar voice, who was apologising without taking a breath, and the family curse words of Ginny, who had hit her nose on the ground.
Harry pursed his lips for a little while, “deal, although this will take place tonight, two hours before curfew, if you have detention you can ask to have it moved to a new spot but it will be doubled in time, that’s a risk you have to take. I assume it will be worth your time.”
“-that caused me to spread you rumours about being the Heir of Slytherin, in hopes you would actually come to Slytherin.” Draco ignored the ‘
“What Draco forgot to say is… what if Harry’s soul is the same as he is now, what if all we have to do is rekindle his ghost with his body?” Hermione smiled at Draco expression.
“Interesting,” said Atieno, completely unbothered by the dust. “I am thrilled to see that you have matured from a moron to someone slightly incompetent. You should have used a shelf or that light fixture, though. Dust is a fantastic distraction one that could cause temporary blindness, but you want to incapacitate your enemy, not hinder them.”
“You’re not learning much without hearing what they’re saying…” Draco let out a small sigh and cast an amplifying charm, it increased their voices just loud enough so that they could hear.
“It’s getting late Draco, you should sleep, when he gets up fully I’ll take him to bed, and yes, that means I’ll walk him all the way there and ward his bed and then wake you, now hurry up and kiss him and leave.” Snape snapped.
Harry walked towards the oaf’s hut, his shoes crunching on the slightly loose gravel path that looked like it had never once been tended to in the entire time that the castle had been around, actually he wasn’t even sure if it was meant to be gravelled or if it was just random bits of rock that formed a somewhat path. He realized that a few students were still walking around, and some coming from the Quidditch pitch, he realized that it must have been Ravenclaw’s practice session, he kept his chin up and continued walking, slightly weaving around people, not wanting to get slammed over due to his small size and the fact one of them was about three of him in body mass.
“Stop going back to these useless topics!” said Atieno, annoyed. “The Dark Arts are not combined into a small, easy to read book. It has taken me many a year to collect just these scrolls. Even the smallest collections can take a decade to just get a small collection.”
“I see the boy can move and has a reaction time greater than half my allies,” said the Master Mutilator, laughing. “I fear I will lose you, Bernard. Look at his eyes and tell me what you see.”
“Maybe that’s what happens when he taught me, I just got used to his method of teaching, and it just feels right,” said Harry before leaning closer towards the book. “I can assume you’ll be doing something advanced, so I assume that you’ll want to focus on studying those. I would honestly begin with the Draught of Living Death.”
“My Lord,” said Bellatrix instantly, twirling a strand of her dark hair. “I apologize, it was simply boring. This is where all the action is.”
“Are we leaving the library or staying?” said Draco, standing. “I don’t have much else to do and this place is clearly more than I expected.”
Lily nodded along, her bright green eyes focused on the forum of her sleeping son, who had somehow shifted from being asleep on the sofa next to Severus, to being on his lap once more. The scene was so surreal.
Harry and Draco walked into the drawing room, at least that’s what Harry assumed it was, all of the rooms seemed to look the same to Harry. Harry sat opposite Narcissa and smiled at her, “morning!” Harry said with confidence, hoping he greeted her correctly.
Rosier glared. “I mean, are they deadly?” he asked, whispering. “And don’t give me a generic ‘yes’. Are they dangerous to us?”
Harry sent Draco a glare before snapping it towards Theodore. “Hopeless,” he said, making his way towards the lavatory, hoping that he would be able to get ready in time. Seven minutes to get ready for the day.
It happened quickly and he had no idea how it happened, but the cobblestone path slowly merged into disturbed dirt, as if someone had walked across it recently. He continued walking deeper and deeper into the forest, noting that it was getting darker and darker as he progressed. He soon came to a fork in the road. He sniffed and took the right path, knowing that he was always right and going right would be the right choice. He chuckled as he walked, ignoring the growing darkness.
Blaise handed him his sheet, which was complete, “why do you collect them when you could just use a spell?”
“Sorry, Hermione, but I don’t care,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. “Potter’s just doing this for attention.”
“Everyone gather round the fence here!” called Hagrid, startling more than half of the students. “That’s it – make sure yeh can see. Now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books –”
“No one will buy that excuse,” said Severus. “I could see it working if you failed an exam or failed to do a spell right, but no one will believe it was due to your inferior teaching, especially when you are one of the top students in your year group. The only excuse I could see working is that it was accidental magic.”
“I may be amazing, Rosier, but I am not omnipotent, nor do I have the amazing ability to know everything. I have no idea what Wood’s doing. For all I know, he could be correcting his Chasers for not scoring enough, belittling his Beaters for not protecting Longbottom, or scolding his Seeker for not catching the Snitch when they have an impeccable lead.”
“No, I mean that you really shouldn’t jump,” said Harry, tilting his head. “This is a school of magic. Jumping will pretty much bring every single available professor here within seconds. You’ll be hit with a Slowing Charm before you’re even midway down.”
“We were having a friendly duel and of course I took him out by accident, I didn’t realize he wasn’t able to breath and cast the spell anyway, I regretted it as soon as the spell left my wand.” Hermione glanced sadly at the floor; the room was filled with silence. “Can we take him into the infirmary?” Hermione added, noticing Ron had already picked Draco up.
Harry glared at Longbottom, who had the nerve to stand there with a sheepish expression on his face. “Did you get a birthday card from
“This is all fascinating,” said James, “but nothing about this has told me why my son is in the state he’s in. You just told me that we focus on healing the extremes yet my son is hardly healed.”
Neville woke up, dazed, and looked around the Chamber, realising that the basilisk had come out and flung them around with its tail. He saw the basilisk as it drove one of its large fangs into the sword of Godric Gryffindor, a green substance coating the sword in the process. He clenched his eyes shut when he feared that the thing would look at him and kill him. It was hard to ignore the whimpers of Ron next to him.
Draco instantly frowned, wondering where Harry was going with this. “But…” he started and trailed off. “I know. The nimbus is just as good.”
Harry said nothing but followed behind, holding his pants up as he did so. His body was larger than he was before the change and the pants should have been tighter, not looser. “People will recognise me, just by my voice. People will know it’s me.”
“I think Arthur found the right balance,” said Lily. “He spent a few years tinkering with various things and found out how much magic can be placed into certain things.”
“Okay, I realize you may have been busy while I was at school, it makes sense, and I can forgive that,” said Harry, his face still blank. He was aware of the people staring at him, he found that he couldn’t care to address them for staring. “What is your excuse for missing my own birthday? I didn’t even get a card from you, that’s unforgivable!”
The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October, and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that each and every one of you will extend every courtesy and helpful advice you may have to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.”
They walked down a dirt path, the rattling of the armour from the guards the only defining sound as each step was taken. They saw small huts that had goods lined in the cracked and dirty windows, presumably for sale. They saw another fight, and one behind that fight; and another off to the right, right next to the hut that was selling items.
Harry played defensively, which wasn’t normally his style when doing such things, he preferred for the aggressive approach, but he was a Slytherin and he had good self-preservation and he didn’t want the opponent to catch his throw and knock him out. He did have a weak throw, he was a Seeker in Quidditch, not a Chaser. Speaking of Quidditch, this game was similarly like it, just a little different.
Once again, Professor Binns ignored the boy who interrupted him, despite the fact he wanted to ask where the boy got his history from. He glanced around and realized a lot of the class looked rather uneasy about what was just said. He soon realized that people were watching him, hoping for more information. “The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course. Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.”
Professor Snape instantly what was going on, he had used Legilimency in battles before but not to the degree that Harry was. He knew that Harry wasn’t doing it to win, but to humiliate Longbottom and make him look incompetent and forfeit the match. Too bad for Harry that Longbottom would never forfeit, no matter what. He had learned that much when he was forced to watch the boy train with Alastor Moody.
Harry rolled his eyes at the whiny voice, his whole mind just shutting down and telling him to laugh at the man, who had missed his only opportunity to get him off a broom by being careless. He lifted his left hand, using his right to steady himself, and gave a little wave, knowing it would infuriate the man. Before his left hand had even touched his broom again, he shot off into the sky, his eyes searching for Clara, who would have stopped when he had not followed.
Harry turned his head and faced his mother, moving his gaze from a portrait towards the back of the room. “Not exactly.”
“We know, but Harry has to say himself, I assume he asked his spirit to fix him and make it look like a scuffle, Harry will protect Ron for some reason, whether it’s because he’s threatened someone else or because of something else, but he will not tell, Dumbledore and I both know this.” Snaped huffed and picked Harry up.
Lucius raised his eyebrows, “anything My Lord,” Lucius sad softly, still keeping a firm eye on Potter.
“You don’t win people over with flowers,” said Robin, thinking. “I can see the appeal. It’s like how Hufflepuffs always try to be underestimated. The House system is fantastic, the best I have ever seen in a school, but it needs to be tweaked. It’s too competitive and segregating.”
Draco nodded and picked up Harry who had really fallen asleep and wrapped his legs around him, hiding his front from view and walked him out.
“Yes,” said Atieno. “Now, let us have a little duel to demonstrate the points I have made and to see your progress. I will reverse any major damage with ease, so worry not about causing harm.”
The three portraits looked at Helga who coughed, “that one is mine Harry. I wasn’t a good duellist, but I did do somewhat well, I invented that as a pure distraction, the more spells the cast throws at it the harder it grips, it cannot hurt though.”
“Just came out,” said a square-jawed wizard eagerly, his eyes going up and down the sleek broom. “They say that this is just a tease, not the finished product.”
He had gotten the famed invisibility cloak, from his father none-the-less, which shocked him as he assumed it would go to Neville, as ‘
Harry couldn’t get out of that room fast enough. He waved off Professor Trelawney’s farewell and went down the stairs at a rapid pace, almost leaving Draco behind. “Keep up, Draco, else we’ll be late for Transfiguration.”
“Honestly Albus this is barbaric, it needs to stop.” McGonagall’s words drew them from watching the fight take place.
“I honestly have no idea what his issue is,” said Harry as he dropped next to Draco and observed the small area they had. He glanced at Rookwood’s bed and wondered why the boy’s area was so tidy, compared to everyone else’s. “I could have sworn that Hogwarts would have at least provided some entertainment, but so far the lessons and the entire curriculum has been a bore.”
“What do you have planned, Harry?” said Draco, not getting sucked into that little argument. He knew that his friend would soon mention something about who would you follow… a weak person, or someone with an air of confidence and everyone would say the latter, proving his point correct. “And we’re all aware of your talents in chess. I still, however, hold the title of being the only person to beat you.”
“You can make sounds, Draco,” said Harry as Hagrid went on and on about the creatures. “I know that you look up to your father and that if you go to him with what you think is wrong that he’ll praise you for it, but he already knows. He knows that this lesson is a joke… it was his words when he saw we were taking it. If you want to impress him, Draco, you need to be yourself.”
“Or that your wand is a little less springy than someone else,” said Draco, laughing. “So sorry, young wizard, your wand bends a little too much.”
“A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years,” said Tom softly, softer than he was speaking just moments ago. He pointed towards the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary.
“Your shirt is inside out, your tie is on wrong and your hair looks as if you were outside flying in a storm,” said Draco, staring at the look of his best friend with slight disdain. He took a very small step towards his friend with a raised eyebrow and yanked off the boy’s shirt, which caused Harry to cry out in a juvenile manner. “Be quiet! It’s not like you’ve never been undressed in a room full of people before. You’re in the same dormitory as six other boys – you’re bound to see a lot more in due time.”
Hermione gave Neville a concerned look. “That must mean that you have some sort of advanced control over the language.”
Harry considered it and decided that he would indeed duel the vampire. He didn’t care about rules as it was stated to be a friendly duel, which meant that no lethal curses, hexes, or spells would be used.
“I only eat when I have to, so that would explain why I’m skinny, and I most likely don’t spend enough time in the sun to grow to a healthy height,” said Harry simply. Just throwing random answers around as he had no idea why he was so tiny. “I’m eleven, by the way, in case you didn’t know, not nine.”
Narcissa ignored the fact that her son was slowly creeping forwards, most likely in an attempt to escape the room. She stood in front of the door with her eyes narrowed on her son. She was sure that he wouldn’t lie about letting the snake in and it did seem as if he was just as surprised as her. “Very well,” she said, dropping her arms to her side. “It would be very wise of us to allow Harry some degree of rest.”
“He abducted children,” said Harry, folding his arms over his chest. “He lured them away from their parents and then stunned them, handing them over to his employer, who did God knows what to them. Thankfully, from what I saw, them being abducted was the worst of it and it was nothing more sinister. Regardless, how can you sit there and defend a man who mentally tormented children, claiming he killed their siblings and parents in the name of curing one sick boy? Sure, he went into it assuming he would have to sleep with a few desperate people, scraping together Knuts each day until he had enough. He folded after his first cut was eight Galleons and all morals vanished.”
Harry thought on it for quite some time, speaking to Salazar quietly as he considered his options. The man was far too humble about what he could and could not do. He was a fountain of obscure knowledge, magic, and tactics. He glanced toward Atieno, feeling quite despondent about the pensive look on the vampire.
Professor Lupin barely had time to see what the Boggart changed into before the spell was cast. “Five points to Slytherin,” he muttered as he directed the next Slytherin student to approach the Boggart.
Harry followed behind, finding a compartment that appeared to be empty, but only held one person. “I guess this’ll have to do,” he said, peering at the person who was asleep. “If they wake up, we can just say that this was the only compartment left.”
“Not at all, at least now Snape will have to punish him for sneaking out and not me” Minerva laughed, although it was forced.
“We don’t want a cliché name, Draco,” said Harry with a sigh. “I can safely say that if this were a book, or if a book about this situation was being made, that’d be the very first thing that an author would chose.”
When Professor McGonagall turned away, Ronald Weasley leaned in, just mere inches away from Harry’s ear. “I think Flint was right, you know, as much as I hate to admit it. I think that you and Malfoy were actually in the broom closet and you lied to cover it up –”
“I’m not going to dance around with sugar-coated words, nor will I extend any pleasantries towards you regarding this.”
“I didn’t ask for your life story!” snapped the teacher, causing a few people to remain perfectly still.
“That’s not a bad thing though, right?” asked Harry. “I mean one day all of us are going to do just that, perhaps he’s doing it just a little earlier.” He fingered the top of the bishop and ignored its complaints as he did so. He shifted it towards the center of the board and released the head of the poor bishop, who was now grumbling.
Harry woke up at his usual time, which compared to a lot of other people was far too early in the morning to be awake, at least in his age range. He disagreed, naturally, he thought that the peace and quiet that he got an hour or two before everyone else got up was the best way to start the day, in silence. He slowly crawled out of the somewhat warm bed, the chilly air took the warmth from the blankets, but he wasn’t cold, and he glanced out the small window the in the bedroom. The sun was rising fiercely in the air, demanding that it pushes its orange rays of sunlight across the earth, almost as if it was rising quickly just to spite the moon and the darkness that it provided.
The groups of students split, feeling pity of the caretaker that no one actually liked, but losing a beloved pet was enough to make them give the man the space he needed and without hassle that he would see his dead cat. The confusing part of the split was that the Slytherins didn’t split until Harry made a gesture and the second-years split, which caused the rest to follow suit.
The Slytherin team walked in a slight formation, which wasn’t unusual as the House seemed to do that often. Marcus Flint walked at the front, leading the team with the two other Chasers, Terence Higgs and Adrian Pucey behind him. Then it was the two Beaters, Peregrine Derrick and Lucian Bole. Behind those two was the Keeper, Miles Bletchley and then the Seeker, who was Harry Potter. The team stood just off the field, but in view of the cheering Slytherin students. No one else cheered for the Slytherin team, besides Slytherin.
“You may call me Lord Atieno,” said Lord Atieno with a snort. “As you can see, I am not of African descent. It was the name people began calling me because I was a vampire and they assumed we are all born or turned at night.”
As he inched closer, he realised that the group of would-be Americans were not Americans. The accents hinted at that almost instantly. He knew he had not been seen, but that meant very little in terms of the whole situation. As he inched a little closer, he could finally place the accents. They were European, not exactly English speaking as they were not speaking English.
Another issue was the French in the letter, he had no idea what the heck it was as he hardly even understood the language. He knew that monsieur meant mister, but aside from that, he had no idea.
“I honestly don’t have the patience to teach people,” he muttered honestly, not wanting to dive in the subject. “I expect people to know the exact same amount that I know, I’ll never be able to change that.”
Ernie stood up, his hand clasped around the side of Harry’s robe, face red he gently let it go. “Please stay, just for a little bit more,” he said softly. “There’s something important that I need to talk to you about.”
“You have a special wand?” said Draco, pushing open the library door. “Seems quite cliché, you know. You’ve a wand that bypasses things set in place without any difficulty. I think there was a hero in one of my childhood books that had a sword that could cut through any spell.”
Augusta Longbottom walked in shortly after, flicking soot off her robes. She turned her nose up the house and sneered down at everyone with her bird feather hat. “I assume Neville will be in capable hands? I have an important meeting at the Ministry that I simply cannot put off any longer than I have.”
James’ hesitation came back at full force at being addressed by his name and not father by his son. His glare morphed into a concerned expression and his eyes went upwards, just beyond his angry son and towards Lucius, who was gesturing for him to move out of the way in a gesture that he’d never thought a Malfoy would do. “Harry, please.”
“Loads,” said Harry. “It’s pretty much full, which can’t be said for any other class that isn’t forced on you. Many witches and wizards find Muggles interesting.”
Harry caught sight of Draco and smiled, “look everyone; it’s my boyfriend, my lover… my life. Now I can go beat Weasel in this duel and be done with his pathetic shit for a while.”
“I missed you, Harry,” said Lily, pulling back with a huge grin on her face. “I missed you so much! The house was empty without you around.”
“I was decent,” said Draco, grinning. “You would have never known if you weren’t a natural Occlumens.”
“I can only offer comforting words,” she finally said, staring the man up and down in sympathy. “Perhaps I can convince one of my friends to help your son with the Wolfsbane potion.”
“Not with me,” said Lucius, glaring at Mr. Borgin with a high amount of disdain. He followed Mr. Borgin’s eyes towards Harry, who was still examining the large black cupboard that he was looking at before.
Harry felt the warmth and smiled like a madman, it felt so good. Both Lucius and Draco chuckled at him and Narcissa had already left for the tea.
Professor Snape sneered and stopped at the door. “Mr. Potter, I require your aid on the seventh-floor. Peeves broke something and I trust no one else with potions.”
“That’s incorrect. If I eat the way you do, I’ll most likely get fat and not strong,” said Harry with a sneer. “In order to get what you call strong you need a healthy diet, not a bunch of nonsense and fried food, which is what I can assume you eat.” He mentally thanked the fact that his mother was raised as a Muggle pretty much and cooked mostly healthy food.
“Not exactly,” said Harry after a brief silence. “It was always mother and I in some sense, at least most of the time. He was hardly around and I guess I just got used to it. Mother was enough that I never actually sought him out.”
“That’s false,” said Harry, grinning. “I lived there and plenty of Muggles are around there daily, hiding in their houses.”
Harry gave Neville a light shrug, not worth much more than that and began to walk towards the front doors of the state. He wondered what they actually looked like as they looked to be made of glass. “What do you want, Longbottom?” he asked when he realised the boy was walking towards him. “I was clearly done with the conversation and your ignorance, hence why I was walking away.”
Nagini lowered her head and placed it on her youngling’s knee. She hit him across the side of his body with her tail and let out a satisfied hiss.
Harry listened to Tom for a second, who seemed to be whispering. “The soul will pass on without delay if the human or creature dies a natural death. If the death is caused by murder, the soul will linger on Earth until the killer also dies.”
He sighed and tried his hardest to keep the thoughts about that cursed mirror from entering his mind. The moment that mirror came alive in his mind, agitation would join it. It wasn’t that he hated his parents, but his greatest desire couldn’t be them. He could never be so Hufflepuff that his greatest desire would be his parents and not ruling the world, which he deserved. If Longbottom ever said anything about it, or told anyone, he would regret it.
He sat down in the chair he was offered, which so happened to be next to Draco and across from Professor Snape. “Sir, to be completely honest, Draco has no real need to be here, he did nothing wrong.”
“That’s not how it was at all,” said Harry. “I wanted you on the team because we’re friends and I thought you wanted to be on the team. You kept dropping subtle hints about it.”
Pulling away from those thoughts, he watched as the boy very carefully scooped up the potion into glass phials, which were previously littered over the work bench. It was done with the most care someone could do, carefully pouring the exact same amount into each phial as if an extra centimetre would ruin the phial.
Professor McGonagall shook her head and walked away before she was drawn into a discussion about manliness. The worst thing about what Harry had said was the fact that it was something that James would say, except maybe a little different.
“Sometimes losing is great for baiting the opponent into doing something stupid and reckless, such as thinking you’re weaker than you appear and underestimating you,” said Harry, a smirk appeared on his face. “Then you swoop in and crush them while they’re dazed about your skill.”
Ginny glared at Ron, “I know you did this and I know Harry will cover your stupid ass because he doesn’t want anyone to be hurt.”
“Can we even trust Severus? With his close contact to the old coot, he could be more of a threat than before, even if he does work directly with Potter and my dear Draco.”
Draco pulled Harry aside while the group chatted for the last few minutes and stared at him for a moment. “What do you mean, you’re good at strategy?” he asked in a whisper, his face conveying the confusion that he was feeling. “I know you use Legilimency when you –”
Lily wanted to refuse, despite being offered the tea, she couldn’t afford to repay the favour and deep down she just felt wrong for thinking of accepting it. She gave a reluctant sigh and met Narcissa’s eyes, which screamed at her to just order.
Lily heard the owl and quickly took the letter, watching as the owl instantly took flight, leaving behind a few feathers from its less-than-satisfactory landing, she picked up the letter and began to read it with a quickened pace, instantly realizing who it was from.
“He learnt that from Snape, I know Snape taught him that or Harry is smarter than I gave him credit for, he watched each teaching style closely.” Draco muttered and watched Blaise pull out his wand, “I’m warning you Blaise, don’t.”
“I’ve no idea why you’d think anything like that even matters,” said Harry. “In a few years, everything I’ve learned about them will be irrelevant as people change and anything else will be ignored and called teenage stupidity. In politics, I agree.”
“Oliver, do you want to take over Keeper? No disrespect to Ron but he couldn’t block anything if his life depended on it.” Harry chuckled, soon enough the entire team was laughing.
It didn’t take him long to find her, really. He knew where she liked to lurk around, frightening unsuspecting first and second-year students that seemed deathly afraid of her.
“D’you know how long this game’s gonna take?” he said. “I’m already bored, my butt is wet, my back hurts, and, to top it all off, I have to study for a piece of homework that a certain professor forgot to inform me about, yet kept the time and day I had to hand it in the exact same, despite leaving me with less than half the time of other students. Hardly fair, if you ask me. Could’ve at least cut me some slack for their own mistake.”
“I am merely curious,” said Albus. “There are very few who would willingly avoid a phoenix, even fewer who would purposefully avoid one. To do both and say in a dangerous situation is not something I would have expected from someone so young.”
The Great Hall filled with exciting chatter immediately, with speculation being thrown out and everyone turning towards the local over-achievers, the library dwellers, and the all-around geniuses. Most of the Ravenclaw table threw their hands up in surrender, not knowing what event it could be. There was speculation for about five seconds before the shout of Dumbledore instantly silenced the Great Hall.
Harry followed behind, wondering how far away the Divination books actually were. “How far away did you put these books?” he asked, passing down three different isles of books.
“I soon began selling the remedies I made to other people, commoners, and started off a fortune. I never did it for the money and I never aimed to. I just wanted to help people. Regardless, a few weeks later I was presented a pure white robe, which I still grin at, and was announced as a druid, my title was prestigious and many people knew my name.
“Aw, you’re crying, seeing as your Mudblood mother won’t save you, why not let’s see if daddy will?” The lady walked close to Harry and moved her wand over his body, “one more time,” she pulled back, “Crucio!”
Draco half-smiled and took off, Snape was hiding something, and maybe in due time he would find out, but as for now, rest is all he needed.
Dumbledore had this old man façade going on and no one believed him to be senile. There was something off about Lockhart, but it wasn’t his talent in magic.
“I have no idea what the letters mean, sounded like gibberish to me.” Harry read the initials of names fast.
Harry felt as if an old person was drilling him about new age things, or if he had just stepped on some old ladies flowers.
Harry laughed. “Nothing will happen to the little bunny, however you may want to give it a carrot or some lettuce for pulling it away from home.”
“Goodnight Draco.” The room said in unison, Draco waved them off and walked into his bedroom. Draco was thankful for his own bedroom, it allowed him to relax and not listen to a snoring Blaise. Draco noticed the letter from his father on his desk, he would read it later, the present however was most likely from his mother, and he would share them with Harry tomorrow, screw what Snape said.
“Why’s he sticking to Krum so tightly?” said Draco. “It’s gross. Now that you’ve pointed him out, it’s obvious.”
“I’m not nervous,” muttered Draco. “I just needed to go to the library and do some studying. I forgot that there was a Quidditch game today.”
“Like this, it’s a pretty easy shape not that you need to really do it, everyone knows wand movements are just for concentration.” Draco held his smile and showed Harry the wand movement.
“Nah,” said Harry, grinning. “That’s the only position that has an available slot. I have a theory that the position is jinxed or cursed, causing the professors to meet an unfortunate end. I had a look in the registry of former professors and the one for Defence Against the Dark Arts is considerably larger than all other professors. Ever since nineteen fifty-seven, no professor has held it for more than a year – something
Ron just turned around and blankly walked towards the Gryffindor common room, Hermione followed shouting at him, but he refused to talk to her or stood when she tried to stop him. He sat on a chair then snapped out of it.
Ron’s reply was cut short by the deafening cheer of the students. He perked up, knowing that Neville had won as no one would cheer for a Slytherin. Much to his disbelief he spotted Potter standing and then Neville a few meters away. ‘Good,’ he thought happily. ‘Neville can still win.’
Harry studied the girl closely as he sat down into a seat. The girl had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, a book was held across her chest as if it was the last book in the world and she was already in her school robes, before the train had even left.
The goblin gave a delighted look and leant back against his throne. “I could just grow to like you, wizard,” he muttered. “You think with your bloodlust and not your conscience. It will be a pity when you die.”
“This year you spent seventy percent of your time in the infirmary and twenty-five percent with Malfoy and the other five percent with us, it hurt a lot that I was a last resort or just completely forgotten, even though I expected it from day one. I have no idea what came over me, I honestly don’t, it started as a vendetta and then it turned into something more, petty hatred. For so long I was jealous and now I just wanted you gone, I began to practice spells and then tried to get you kicked off the team, when all that failed I turned to physical violence, it started with Dean and Seamus to practice for you, but I learnt that you aren’t physically strong, so when I hit you I did more damage than I intended to. For a while I found myself feeling horrible for what I did and I made my way to get checked out and then I just remembered everything and the hatred started again. I don’t hate gay people Harry, I never have and I never will.”
He actually enjoyed the Slytherin house, but at times he just wished that he was able to make friends with the other houses without being called a traitor to the house or being sneered at by the other houses. If it wasn’t for the rather large library in Hogwarts, he was sure he would have gone insane from it, not that he was sociable at all, but sometime sit paid off to have ‘friends’ from other houses. With three houses wanting a Slytherin’s blood, it caused him to spend a lot of his time in a state of disquietude.
Harry shifted, to cover his chest from view with the blanket, “I’m sorry Narcissa, I didn’t mean to be sick.”
“I don’t remember him at all,” said James, rubbing his head. “I saw pictures – he… he looks familiar, but I just can’t remember him.”
He watched as blood slowly dribbled down her chin and drip onto her already blood-stained robes. She was bleeding from her nose, mouth, and the various nail marks he had left on her cheeks when he gripped her face in anger.
Neville jumped first, then Hermione and finally Harry, who scowled about doing such a childish thing as jumping down a trapdoor.
“It is relevant, and much more than a petty squabble of teenage angst, due to that fact that if you accept, everything will about him, his past, and his characteristics will become perfectly clear,” said Salazar, speaking through gritted teeth. “You will know everything about him, no matter how dark or gritty it may be. You will be privy to his deepest feelings with no filter, nothing to suppress them. There is no stopping or severing the connection once accepted. It was lifelong.”
I honestly prefer the movie scene where the twins give Harry the map. So, I altered that instead. Don't hate me. I dislike twin speak, but it's such a good scene.
, but he assumed that would be cheating. Harry paced on the spot, thinking of something to embarrass Ron further. Harry had to block a few spells, but that was easy enough to do, at most if Ron hit him with a spell it wouldn’t do much, but Ron was playing dirty, the spells he were using wouldn’t hurt, just be a minor annoyance.
“Will think it was cast on me to make me forget the ordeal,” said Robin, a tired tone of voice. “The room will shift when the next prisoner is added and we
Harry snorted. Maybe Weasley had a point, not that he would ever admit that out loud. He relied on himself, the King, rather than the other pieces as they could be sacrificed. Every other piece was replaceable, he could not. Weasley was the opposite and spent most of his time hovering near the action, often using himself to block off escape routes. “It would be such a waste of my own time to verse someone as incompetent at chess, such as you, Weasley.”
Professor Snape scowled at being interrupted. He thought about why it took so long for the ward to tell him that the Dark Arts had been used and why it allowed a boy to suffer in the school. He dug around in his robes and pulled out a small phial of purple potion and shoved it against the boy’s mouth. He gripped the boy’s head with his other hand and forced the boy to drink it. He knew the potion wouldn’t instantly cure it, but it would dull the pain and allow him more time to think.
“Are you ready for the Defence Against the Dark Arts exam?” said Draco, keeping his voice low, not wishing to invoke the wrath of the librarian. “You know, it might not be like what you’re expecting. Lupin’s a beast of a person and’ll probably make us run laps around the Quidditch pitch.”
With a small jump and a determined expression, the goblin lunged through the air, intent on driving his spear straight through the chest of the wizard in front of him.
The issue wasn’t Dumbledore, nor was it the blatant tone of mistrust that he had used. He knew, as did most people, that the Headmaster didn’t trust him because he held far too many talents that most people couldn’t ever dream of mastering. The same very talents that took decades to master, he knew at the ripe age of eleven. Occlumency, for one, was something that took a bare minimum of three years when you were well-versed in most magical arts, but he knew it well before he stepped foot into Hogwarts. Another issue was that it was impossible, literally, to learn Occlumency unless you had the desire to hide something so valuable you would limit your own mind.
“Are you serious?” said Harry and then snorted and twisted his head towards Weasley and Longbottom, not even bothering to waste his time with Granger, who was clearly messed up in the head. “Whatever, Granger, I don’t really care what nonsense you’re sprouting off about empathy and remorse. What I do care about, and it’s an important issue, is why you three decided to drink and brew Poly juice Potion and then sneak into the Slytherin common room to interrogate me and Draco.”
“When he told me that the Stone had sadly been destroyed in the battle that happened, he promised that he’d work something out and I trusted him, if the Stone was destroyed he would move mountains to help assist me, but the Stone wasn’t destroyed.” Nicolas gave a slight shrug, which caused the boy to laugh at the absurdity of it. “I have spent six hundred years with the Stone. There’s only one person that Albus assumed would want the Stone, and that’s You-Know-Who.”
“You’d sell out your own sister for him? Half-Blood, a stupid Gryffindor who charges into the conflict-”
Blaise scowled at her, “firstly, you should address me by my name, and that is Zabini and I doubt Draco gave you permission to call him Draco, also can you not sit here? You’re drawing attention.”
“So you wouldn’t mind if I asked him out on a date or something? I know you Draco, I know deep down the line you’re going to fall for him and let me have my fun before it happens.”
Mopsy’s eyes went wide and she shook her head slightly. “Mopsy is be – doing nothing, Little Master,” she said, correcting herself. “Mopsy is just visiting Visy, Little Master… just visiting Visy.”
“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir, beware,” said Harry, remembering the bloody message on the wall with ease. “Besides, you confirmed that you know that it exists with your rather odd reaction to how I said it.”
“You’re so hot and cold with this school,” said Rosier. “One moment you hate everything in this school and everything that references it and then the next moment you love it and praise the accomplishments of the school.”
“Good morning, Mrs. Reed,” said the principle in a chipper tone of voice, his expression morphing into one of happiness. “This young lad is Harry Potter, he’s spending the day at our school to explore his horizons and test out our school in case he wishes to transfer here. Of course, I wish to see that he has full use of our schools facilities and make him feel welcome.”
Harry, having fled the dining room, made it to his bedroom in record speed. He placed the letters on his desk, trying to fit them in somewhere without leaving them scattered all over the tabletop. He wasn’t a neat freak like some, but he did dislike meaningless clutter that only served to take up space.
“Oh be quiet, you aren’t killing anyone, you’re far too easy to manipulate. No one has come to save you yet, does that disappoint you?”
Mrs. Reed jumped up and lent over the board, studying where the checkmate had come from. “I checkmated myself when I took your queen!”
“We’re heading to the Burrow in about fifteen minutes,” said Lily, slowly poking her head into the room. “Are you – would you like to come or would you prefer to just stay here?”
A soft white light surrounded Harry and Draco, it had slight gold and red strands through it, the spell took shape of a white spirit. The spirit cradled Harry who looked exhausted; it gently helped him into a lying position and tended to Draco. It then stood and walked towards the adults.
The two began discussing various methods of potion making and ways to help improve Gemma’s work and help her pass her O.W.L this year. Harry on the other hand was enjoying teaching her the complex art of potion making, his patience at an all-time high with Gemma, but anyone else would have been degraded to the point of tears or whimpering. He continued helping Gemma until he yawned and checked the time, which revealed that curfew was approaching rapidly.
“I don’t think father even has that book,” said Draco. “After you read it, I’m sure he’d buy it from you.”
Harry decided, quite quickly, that the best course of action would to be silent. He knew that a bunch of eleven-year-old children would be unable to provide a stimulating conversation that would allow him actual joy in debating it. He knew that the group would be more excited to discuss Hogwarts, their potential house, and other things that do not relate to the intricate rules of magic and how to squeeze them.
, as you put it, if we ignore the fact that Nymphadora Tonks is pushing, with everything she has, to find out anything about you,” said Severus. “Her personal investigation, when her record is so far pristine, by the Minister of Magic has her convinced that you have some deep connections and are actively manipulating them. She is determined to find them, squash them, and have you punished. She desires justice.”
Draco walked a tad faster, keeping in step with Harry’s faster pace that he was walking for some reason. “What do you think that was about? The way they were talking was like they had the biggest secret in the world.”
Albus hung his head, speechless. “I don’t believe that he’s as cold and aloof as he likes people to believe.”
Harry watched as Granger, who seemed to be entering the beginning phase of a severe panic attack, slowly got to her feet, her whole body trembling and her face slowly going into a sickly white. He leant forward in anticipation, watching as she slowly ambled towards Professor Moody, who had set up a small area for the practice to take place. From where he was, he could not see the exact details of the area, but he assumed that was done so that no one could prepare in advance.
Snape broke the spell and grinned to himself, “Harry, how do you forget to say that you love Draco?”
Harry listened, captivated, by the sheer amount of things that vampires could do that wizards could not. The list seemed endless and it got better and better as more things were listed. He couldn’t understand how vampires were so strong and so anonymous.
“Of course, I have yet to practice said spell, and it is a bit beyond my skill level, but practical testing is always a good idea, isn’t it?”
“Wait, what? Hold on just a second!” said Draco, far too late. He felt Harry lean into the turn, as if he was zooming around the open Quidditch pitch and then he oddly found himself spinning, as if he was on the verge of crashing. “What the –”
Professor Snape stopped just in front of Longbottom and Weasley and gave them his trademark sneer. “What is that you have got there, Longbottom?” he sneered at them more and watched as both boys slightly flinched. His eyes were boring into their heads, making sure to cause them as much discomfort as possible.
“You do know, Harry, that you’re younger than me by a month?” said Draco, his chin lifted. “I’m vastly more mature than you because of my age.”
Harry said his thanks, took the note, and quickly retreated from the hospital wing. He wouldn’t stay there any longer than he needed to. The place made him feel uncomfortable. The place was far too quiet and far too clean for it to be considered natural.
James paced up and down the hallway, his side pulling with each strained step, easily ignoring his wife who kept sending him pointed looks to sit in one of the uncomfortable chairs lined across the wall. He hated St Mungo’s more than he hated any sort of Muggle hospital. All of them smelled the exact same way, a distinct smell that he would never forget. Death. He had no idea how that smell was meant to make him sit down, inhale it, and be calm.
The Boggart flew back into the cupboard with a thrash and a loud whine. It began beating on the cupboard, intent on getting out. The sounds vanished after a few seconds as it slowed down, preparing to strike when the time was right.
He fled the bathroom and took a detour, wanting to avoid the offensive portrait that had vowed to make his life hell because that was the Potter way, at least according to the delirious portrait that claimed that he walked like he had a stick up his backside. The two of them ended up in verbal spats the moment the met each other. It may take an extra minute to get around the portrait, but it was worth it so he didn’t have a headache each morning.
Harry pushed himself off the wall and looked around the room, taking in everyone’s facial expressions. He knew that Longbottom would be terrified of being taken off the Quidditch team. Weasley was appalled on Longbottom’s behalf and Granger appeared to be happy just sighing as the events unfolded. “Let’s not be hasty, now, Professor Snape,” he said as he approached his Head of House. “If Longbottom is taken from the Gryffindor team, they may find a competent Seeker and that could spell disaster for our record.”
“He was brought straight back here and tucked into bed so that he can rest,” said Narcissa, putting extra emphasis on rest. “The wards must have triggered that he was in danger. Thankfully Lucius added him a while ago, else he could have spent all night there.”
“Can we not speak about Vaisey?” suggested Harry, his eyes narrowed. “I swear you’re almost as bad as Blaise, I swear it’s like you two plan to come in and harass me about him. He gave me some balloons, who cares?”
“Ugh, I see Weasley,” muttered Draco, sneering at the large family that came in and then instantly split off from each other. “Even they don’t want to be around each other.”
“We already know each other,” said Terry. “We met about two years ago at the annual Malfoy Ball. Speaking of which, I’m surprised you’re not actually with Malfoy.”
“Finite Incantatem!” cried Neville, clenching his wand tightly. He sighed in relief as his best friend quit screaming the moment the spiders vanished. “That wasn’t nice, Harry.”
“Of course you are, sweetie,” continued Lily, ignoring him completely. “As you know, nothing will be done today, we’ll just spend it as a family and then we’ll head down to Diagon Alley and get your school supplies. Of course we’ll need to wait for your letter for that.”
Harry furrowed his brow, and scowled at Neville. It was funny once, he wasn’t going to mess around again, he was told not to push limits with people, especially those more powerful than him. “Sit down Longbottom, before your
Harry didn’t like this. How could Longbottom, the clueless idiot, know how to speak Parseltongue? He had watched him since Nagini had dropped a hint about it, but he shoved it aside with a grain of salt, hoping that Nagini was wrong and he was right, like always. He wanted to say something, to taunt Longbottom but the entire Great Hall was silent and the students were just standing around, gaping.
“Couldn’t even afford his own wand, had to beg my mother for one so he didn’t have to use his father’s old wand,” sneered Harry, letting out a cold laugh. “Shove off, Weasley, no one cares about your existence, go jump off the train, I’m sure most will celebrate.”
Atieno gave a little smile as he stalked forwards, peering around a tall shelf. His crimson eyes narrowed as he caught sight of a figure climbing through the window. He pulled back and shook his head, keeping an index finger over his lips.
“The man who sold out a lot of pure-blood families for you-know-what to save his skin?” said Rosier. “And then was moved to another country, somehow securing the position of Headmaster at Durmstrang?”
Harry kept quiet about how many books he was getting and just smiled. Soon enough, he exited the shop with all his books shrunken and hidden in his pocket, and with a much, much smaller amount of Galleons in his moneybag. He found Draco in the same place he had left him, slouched over the window, watching the books fight.
“Nothing, I just wanted to sit around and wait for my letter and then we could go to Diagon Alley, perhaps,” said Harry, stabbing his plate with his fork, spearing a piece of bacon, “then do some shopping.”
“Why do you even bother paying that man any money when he has no respect for anyone in the castle, not even himself,” said Harry, looking at the massive dirt footprints that the oaf left. “I don’t think I have ever seen someone butcher the English language as much as he does. Did he not finish schooling?”
Harry shook his head. As far as he could remember, he couldn’t do anything at all that made noise. Even if he cried, it was silent.
“That’s intriguing,” said Harry as he rubbed the side of his face. “I’d love to know where exactly I am on the chart.”
“Traditionally, the other schools arrive in their basic uniform with nothing else,” said Rosier. “It’s to show school spirit and whatever else they like to babble on about. See, we’re getting different stuff than usual as we’re the hosts and we have to look the best. Our old ugly robes and hideous black caps that no one likes wearing are gone.”
“Because no one does research because they don’t feel they have to,” said Harry. “Think about it for a moment. When was the last time you actually questioned anything we learnt? How come ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ can make something float, but any other random string of Latin can’t? Words aren’t a part of magic.”
“In a way, it is,” said Gemma, turning the page. “I just struggle with Potions, it’s by far my weakest subject.”
Harry ignored Tom and snapped his eyes from the Gryffindor table and silently made his way towards the Slytherin table, waiting for his friend.
Hermione snapped her hand directly to her side. “You’re an overambitious lout, Potter, I’ll never follow or listen to what you say. Get over yourself!”
Blaise flashed red, “the first time a couple try to have sex they’re instantly apparated into a room and then instructed to dress. If you’re straight and a male you’ll have a female teacher, girls have a male, unless you’re gay, then you get a male and same for lesbians.” Blaise took a deep breath and glanced at Harry, who looked mortified, “they ask you simple questions, mainly stuff you already know and then they chuck in stupid questions like ‘is male pregnancy possible?’ It’s honestly all bull-”
She listened to the rest of the longwinded speech that the healer gave her and nodded happily to each of it with her eyes trained on her son, who was now in view and she could see his chest slowly rising and falling on the bed.
“It isn’t Snape!” said Harry with agitation. “I know it’s not him for a fact because I came here before him. He’s currently marking essays in his office.”
“Alright, let’s talk about Greengrass,” said Pansy. “What are your goals surrounding her? I detest her very existence, so I don’t care, but I need you to set up the gossip. I can’t say something and the have her coming in and making me look like a fool.”
“Speaking of boys, what do you think about the birthday boy?” said Emily, leaning towards the boy who was staring at the far wall with a strange glint in his eyes. “I think he has good hearing, so keep it down.”
He turned his attention toward Atieno, who just pushed something into the nearby tree, causing it to wither and be covered in blackness, something disgustingly similar to mould. He stared, transfixed, as the druid shifted closer and used his arm, the one without the wooden staff, to absorb the corruption, pulling it into his arm. He blinked as the corruption on the arm of the druid slowly vanished.
“I read half of it,” said Harry. “Most I already knew, but I learned a lot of new things. It’s still in my trunk thankfully.”
“I would appreciate if you could look into something for me,” Voldemort touched his new arm, “complete secrecy of course.”
‘There are two steps I can take regarding this,’ he thought to himself, watching. ‘I can break my own rule about Legilimency, looking into the mind of the injured man or I can simply ask.’
A plan formed in Harry’s mind. It was one that he had glossed over quickly and that was for dissension to form in the enemy team and drive them apart during the match, which was happening now. Glancing up, he met Terence’s eye, who in turn met Marcus’ and another plan was set in motion.
“So I should use Flint’s weakness against him, without obviously trying to discredit him,” said Harry musing over the thought for a bit. “His only talent, according to you, is Quidditch. If I beat him, he will crumble due to only being good at Quidditch. Whereas I’m perfect and good at everything –”
“Mr Potter,” said Professor Lupin as he gently opened the door. “You don’t need to eavesdrop, you know.”
“Well done!” said Asahi, stepping off the stone. “Not many would last beyond the initial attack – unclench your hands, child, you were not defeated this day.”
Harry nodded to himself and set off through the castle, easily sidestepping the students that were still lurking around in the corridors or the various classrooms around the school. He made his way towards the History of Magic classroom, which is where the lessons were taking place, oddly enough.
“All good things, I hope,” said Viktor, sitting on the vacant armchair. “I hope I’m not too late… the feeling I got in my head felt like the same one I got a year ago when I took two Bludgers to the head. I thought the [pain had returned so I just ignored it, knowing it’d go away soon enough.”
“I told you,” said Neville, his voice higher than usual. “It just started and it’s gotten worse as time goes by. I don’t know what it – ow – is!”
“Alright,” said Harry as he continued to glance out the window, watching as a few people who were walking slowly made odd hand gestures, as if telling a story.
“Harry!” said James, covering his son’s mouth. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for you using this over your classmate, despite what your mother might say, even more so because Gerald Boot, the father of your classmate, tried to hit on
The lesson continued rather tensely between the students of Slytherin. They only plus side is that there was no inter-house rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin as the two were separated by no less than half the clearing.
If he could say thank you, he would. Alas, he could not lower himself to thank the youngest male Weasley.
Snape agreed with it, “these two, they will kill each other…” Snape muttered and left, ignoring the snicker of children and the Fat ladies abuse.
“There were rumours that Noistimus Torestian was actually two different people,” said Harry. “Noistimus is an anagram for Issi Mount – another writer. Torestian is an anagram for Isa Torten. They’re both subpar writers that found some success writing, well, rubbish that lonely people read. They both vanished and Noistimus Torestian appeared.”
He retaliated with enthusiasm, keeping Atieno on his toes, which was saying something considering Atieno had inhumane speed and could move and dodge faster than he could blink.
Harry refused to believe it. There was something moving along the trees, matching the speed of the train with minimal effort. It was almost impossible for him to explain, but he was certain he saw something. No amount of mutterings would convince him otherwise.
The former could be easily disregarded, especially with all the false information about him and his two brothers. He could probably pick up a book at random and read that Ignotus was actually a phoenix that transformed into a human to fight Death and lost. The other widely known theory is that the three brothers are actually a Runespoor turned human, with each head becoming a person.
Harry paused, debating whether revealing his full name would be ideal. He knew that he was considered a ‘ghost’ and according to Muggles, Harry James Potter never existed, at least no one with his age, height, and eye colour. He had nothing to prove that he was who he said he was and therefore maybe it wasn’t a bad choice at all. “My name is Harry, Harry James Potter.”
“As I was saying, headmaster, I have been aiding Marcus Flint in various studies, mainly Potions and in return he would help me slightly with Quidditch captaincy issues and requirements,” said Harry, his annoyance obvious in his tone. “From what I have learned from Marcus’ various ramblings about his recent grades, is that he has gone from a ‘Troll’ into an ‘Acceptable’ in most subjects. Something that he is thankful for and has been teaching me the more gruelling parts of maintaining a Quidditch team.”
Before he exited the vault, he picked up a few books on alchemy. After all, now that have had the actual Stone, the real Stone, he’d have to study alchemy on a very in-depth level to understand it. He’d also have to learn how to make the Elixir of Life, which the Stone provided, seeing as Nicolas Flamel was most likely already dead.
“Yes, Harry,” said Rosier. “I mean, look at Granger! She looks like someone’s kicked her pet dog or cat, whatever she decided to buy and bring to school. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone look so distraught over something that shouldn’t involve them.”
Neville frowned as he walked up the stairs, “Oh, hello Professor, sorry I’m out after curfew, I was looking for Harry” Snape looked furious, Neville muttered the password to the portrait who shot daggers at him, before Neville was fully inside Snape called out to him, Neville turned, “yes?”
He would never hold that against her, though. She was just doing what she thought was best for her family, which was admirable. Her actions, on the contrary, had more serious consequences than what she had first thought. For a while, the Malfoy’s became outcasts in the pure-blood ‘elitist’ society, which was hardly an issue seeing as almost the entirety of that society was in Azkaban, dead, or disgraced.
“But Mopsy must!” said Mopsy desperately, her voice slightly cracking as she spoke. Her tears rolled down her face and dropped onto her clothes, which she instantly cleaned. “Mopsy has failed Little Master! Mopsy must punish herself.”
Neville watched as Harry tucked his wand away and glared before swinging open the door and storming off down the corridor. He didn’t get a chance to ponder where Harry was going as Professor Lupin turned to him with a sad facial expression.
Adrian laughed, “you honestly don’t need to worry about that, you’re the last one to hear about the events. I’m aware that Ravenclaw have already thought of a plan, as has Slytherin, naturally.” Adrian released Harry’s hand and walked calmly back towards the Slytherin table.
“Well then, but –” started Vernon, his posture anything but aggressive. He stopped right in his tracks when he realized that his wife was looking at him funnily, as if he had just failed such an easy sale at work. He watched in confusion as she mouthed something at him, but he didn’t understand it, not one bit. “I think it’s good that you’re well behaved,” he said, looking at the boy. “Kids these days, I tell you what, just the other day this kid up the road threw something at me.”
The match continued after Neville’s broom was steadied, something about a fire in the teachers’ stand and it allowed a distraction for everyone and he climbed back on his broom and resumed looking for the Snitch.
Harry glared. “I asked first,” he said in a whisper. “It’s common courtesy to answer the question you’re asked and not reply with another question.”
“Oh, be quiet,” said Draco. “It was obvious that Dumbledore was going to change his mind. The entire school rallied against him.”
“I regret that, Mr. Potter, but you must understand that I was only trying to – ah, Neville, come in and take a seat,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the scowl on the Slytherin boy’s face. “Mr. Potter and I were just having a little chat, I’m sure Mr. Weasley will be here shortly?”
Harry ignored Rosier’s cry of disagreement and turned his focus onto Granger. “You’re right,” he said when he realised that she was rather distraught. “Maybe it’s the Dementors making them all miserable.”
Draco’s eyes shot open like he was just thrown at a wall, “are you daft? Why would we want to lose?”
“Alright Harry, go and plan your lesson, I suggest you start with a practical, win over the students and don’t be afraid to assign house points for those that contribute to the lesson and remove any house points from those that disrupt.” Dumbledore handed him a few parchments, “oh before I forget, your classroom will be mixed with various students from different houses, don’t be surprised if it’s full on your first day, Severus will be there to assist you.”
“Fascinating,” muttered Harry, pulling a shirt over his head. He picked up the trousers he wore last night and slipped them on without any fanfare. “I’ll see you at breakfast, I assume. Don’t dawdle, don’t wanna get in any more trouble.”
“My Lord, why not use Sirius to get to Harry Potter? Sirius is Harry’s only real family left, taking that from Harry would drive him crazy, he would be flooded by guilt and sadness… perfect time to strike,” Lucius hated himself for it, but it had to be done. Snape agreed softly, not that he liked it either, the mutt being dead was a plus, Harry being sad because of it would just hurt Draco.
“I agree,” said the Healer, checking his wrist for a moment before standing. “Come – it’s time. However, Mr Potter, we can’t use magic on a patient that has suffered from spell damage due to potential long-term damage. Magic reacts to other forms of magic and that could cause a maelstrom inside of your son that could very well cause him death or even put a dampener on his own magic. It’s just not worth the risk.”
It had started about two years ago, closer to three, when he and Draco were messing around and Draco complained about his hair being messy and not neat, as it should have been. Armed with a comb and some sort of hair product. That’s how Harry first knew that he liked his hair being touched, it was weird to admit, but whatever.
“Reading up on Potter history? I checked that book out ages ago, it’s pretty impressive. The Potter’s history is about as impressive as yours, Malfoy.” Hermione lied, but still it made Draco lift his head a little.
Harry carefully approached the rattling cage, aware that eyes were on him. He wasn’t unnerved, not at all, but he was being extra careful. He stopped just in front of the books and pulled out his wand, catching the manager of the store frown when he did something she hadn’t. “Stupefy!” he watched as one of the books fell closed and stop moving. He smiled in satisfaction for a split-second and then levitated the other books away from the book he wished.
He had chosen a bed near the large window that was submerged in green tinged water, splashing against the glass harshly, as if it would break at any instant.
“Even a few portraits talk about this recent hate that has started between all the houses and Slytherin. Did you know that was the reason that the study group that I made between Hufflepuff and Slytherin was cancelled? Complaints were just a cover up.”
“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Neville hadn’t understood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen – the worst omen – of death!”
“I never really noticed it before, but you seem to have a way of easily manipulating your mother,” said Draco with a slightly raised eyebrow. “Not that I blame you, as I do it with father. But, I cannot help and think on why you convinced her we were called Death Eaters or anything like that. I don’t think I have ever seen someone be called a Death Eater at all, or even heard the words in passing. At least not yet.”
“Do you think they’ll let us out soon?” said Harry. “I promised a friend I’d attempt to make him a cake…”
“I’m not sure, darling,” said Narcissa, summoning the magazine with a flick of her wand. “We did our research on Lily a while ago and we found no ties to anyone that ever bore that name inside Europe and she’s not an orphan as she looks a little like her sister and parents. As for Harry, well, he’s a little different in terms of magic. He’s an anomaly.”
“The wave of magic you just felt was a vow, no one in the room can talk to Harry about the situation, only Draco may, and he will handle it how he wants to the instant you think about saying something you will forget and walk back to your common room. If you felt the wave of magic it means you were thinking about telling Harry at the time it was sent out, I suggest you clear your thoughts and keep a calm head, if Harry finds this out from anyone, it result could be fatal.”
“One more stop Harry, this one is solely for you, I hope you don’t mind.” Narcissa said while smiling at Harry.
The entire right-hand side of the classroom turned to glare at the Slytherin student that dared insult Hermione Granger. A vast majority of them had called her a ‘know-it-all’ and other hurtful comments almost daily, but they didn’t do it in the open and they didn’t make her cry.
It was a double-edged blade, really. If, and when, Voldemort came back, the Malfoy’s were going to be the first to endure his wrath.
The room was just pure cobblestone and torch brackets that had flickered to life the second he stepped foot into the room. There were also floor-to-ceiling long drapes that covered what appeared to be fake windows.
“Who do you think has it?” whispered Hermione towards Neville and Ron. “It must be a seventh-year studying to become an alchemist.”
“Alright,” said Cornelius, straightening up. He turned to James and nodded. “I will allow you a brief holiday for the Quidditch World Cup. I expect you to spend the event with your son – err, your sons – and no one else. I will have Black in my box and I expect to see the two of you not speak at all.”
Narcissa took a sip of her tea that appeared out of nowhere, “you were given a pass that let you come to Diagon Alley whenever you wanted? That is impressive.”
“You don’t have any sickness or whatever,” said Draco, kneeling on the hospital bed. “The reason why you weren’t allowed to leave is because this muteness was caused by the Goblet.
“Tell anyone about this and I’ll come back, and you won’t be able to walk, because I believe in fairness… I am a Gryffindor at that, if you can find a girlfriend by this time tomorrow, I’ll leave you and Seamus alone.” Ron spat on Dean and stormed out.
Hermione seemed to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. “But what about Nick?” she asked. “We cannot just leave during his party!”
Harry allowed Tom to just keep explaining his own theory behind Squibs and magic. Despite Tom being a voice in
Hermione pursed her lips, “not really, last I heard they were trying to catch up their grades. Both are dangerously close to failing.”
Harry paused for a moment, knowing he had not really done anything wrong and could easily signal Viktor back to explain the situation, but there was no fun in that. He gripped the broom tightly, lifting his legs up slightly, hooking them together and gently lifting himself upwards, doing it slowly so that the man behind him would truly panic and think he was about to flee at any moment. He was going to flee, of course, not wanting to stay around a crazed man who was shouting, drawing attention to his presence. He was just about to lift off completely when a dark blue spell sailed right by his right side, smashing into the ground. He watched as it tore the grass up, spraying the pristine grass all over the pitch.
“I’m not sure,” she said finally, done with her thinking. “If what we’ve learned over the years about Nagini, it’s the fact that she’s very venomous and very fast. I don’t think the headmaster would allow her in unless she lost her venom.”
“Do you know what? I think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in there.”
“I’m more annoyed by the fact you’re gossiping instead of working,” said James, clenching his teeth. “The next person to so much as whisper something gossip related will spend an entire
Harry gave a slight smile and left Draco to sleep, he flew around the corridors and assisted the students who were up past curfew and helped them get back without Filch finding them, of course, the other ghosts and portraits got mad for this, as they were snitches. Harry wasn’t really insulted much anymore; in fact hardly anyone spoke to him besides Draco, Hermione and Ginny, and some odd Slytherin students. Harry chuckled to himself, Slytherin were nice to him and Gryffindor treated him like dirt, it slightly hurt, but Harry soon forgot about it.
“No one denies that,” said Draco without hesitation. “But he isn’t some kind of mastermind that’s slowly pulling strings and controlling the world. If what my father said is true, then he has less sway in the Ministry than we’re led to believe.”
It didn’t help any matters that Harry had threatened anyone who accused Nagini that she would bite them and prove that her venom couldn’t petrify.
Harry couldn’t hear much more of the discussion and lost interest when a red-faced Percy Weasley barged in, his legs somewhat quivering as he sat down. The boy panted and cut off Ginny whenever she went to speak to Longbottom and her brother, Ronald. He sent the Gryffindor table a sneer and refocused on the discussion at the Slytherin table, who were talking about everything and anything. Despite their reputation, they didn’t discuss diabolical plans at the dinner table.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago by some of the brightest witches and wizards of their respective era. It is claimed that each of them sought to bring the three largest European schools of wizardry together and to provide friendly competition. The three schools are, of course, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. From each, a champion is chosen to represent the school in an undetermined amount of tasks that differ in requirements. It is said that a decent of Gryffindor placed a spell that would make the Triwizard Tournament fair and unable to be tampered with or swayed in any manner. It is currently unknown what enchantment the wizards from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang used.
“I know,” said Harry, grinning. “It’s just amusing to see Weasley’s reaction. See, he’s still unsure of how to function.”
“Wait… you mean Lucius, the Lucius? Surely you cannot mean Lucius Malfoy?” Harry was now intrigued, besides the fact his words came out like his throat was made out of jelly.
“That’s the only thing that I can think of,” said Harry. “Everything else is in the Restricted Section and lacks any sort of secrecy. I mean, there’s a book in there that tries to eat other books. It’s something.”
“That’s the thing, I’m not gay, he’s just an idiot who won’t listen, I have said countless times I’m just holding off on a girlfriend so I can improve my grades, Seamus is doing the same, we’re both on the verge of failing.”
Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.
“D’you think we’ve broken down?” asked Ron nervously, still glancing out the window, not that anything could be seen.
“SHUT UP POTTER!” Draco yelled, his voice cracked, “nothing in these three years has happened for a reason, and it’s not because I’m jealous. I’m offended that you’d assume that I was jealous of a Mudblood and a blood-traitor.” Draco shook his head, his pale complexion filling with a tint of red. “I actually wanted to be your friend; I wanted to be something more. I would hope we would grow up together, as best friends. But y-you piece of shit, you ruined it all!” Draco clenched his fists, “that stupid rivalry we had, wasn’t made from thin air or designed to be made by some stupid stargazer, it happened because of you. Your knowledge was so awful I was amazed you could even get to Diagon Alley! Maybe I was jealous slightly, but not because you denied my friendship. But because you denied it for the fucking Weasel.” Draco flicked his weight back and forced himself into a half laying position.
have learned something from pushing on, but he knew that Lucius was most likely almost finished rubbing his vast wealth, seeing as how he almost doubled it, into the faces of the Weasley’s.
. Harry being able to cast the spell both wandlessly and nonverbally just tempts him more than usual. He abused the fact that almost no one can defend against it either and uses it subtly, but he does use it.”
“– snicker, giggle, or chuckle…” said Robin, listing more variations of laughter from his fingers. “I mean it.”
Nothing he did worked. Everything was countered with inhuman reaction speed, even by wizarding standards. Asahi was far too good at being defensive –
“This is rumoured to be where Durmstrang Institute is,” said Harry. “It seems like there’s one at each of the three major schools, which makes sense.”
Much to Harry’s dismay, he was soon herded out the house and towards the back garden, where everyone else was. Clutching his book as a normal child would a stuffed toy he was pushed out into the bright light by the fat red-headed woman.
“A client and his family will be coming over in a few days for dinner, this’ll be the biggest sale of my life!” said Vernon the moment he entered through the door, already knowing his wife and son would be in the living room. He breathed heavily as he set his coat down. “It must be perfect – who are you?” he asked when he finally spotted the black-haired boy in the armchair. “One of Dudley’s friends, I assume, I haven’t seen you before.”
to contain nothing more than subpar journalism you would find in some low effort magazine. He was even more baffled by the supposed information on the Tournament by previous contestants.
“Yes, Draco,” said Harry, rolling his eyes. “Very few of us have massive sprawling houses that have more rooms than four buildings combined. There are no houses like that in Hogsmeade. It’s all tiny houses that have two bedrooms, a shared kitchen and dining, and then a living room with a teensy bathroom tucked off to the side.”
When the bell rang, Harry was the first person out of the class, which was unusual and would draw attention to him, but he had to get across the corridor and down another to get to Weasley’s class, who he needed to speak to urgently. Riddle had urged him to hand over the diary for good this, claiming that both of his bargains were completed, which was partially true.
“Ooh!” said Lily, quickly snatching up the letter. “I’ve been waiting for this letter for ages! You’ll absolutely adore Hogsmeade, Harry, it’s so perfect near Christmas.”
“I may not have perfect vision, but I do have eyes,” said Harry. “I know you’re not Fred or George.”
Draco then realized why his father taught Harry and not him, the words poured back into his head. Like he was standing at a memory river and it was just flowing into him.
!” said the Goblet, the word only audible for the target. “Because you exceeded all expectations, you will be granted one boon. A little bit of insight. There are two upcoming events. One is related to the Tournament, which will have
“No,” said Harry, stifling a laugh. “I’ve never heard that before, sounds like something a cowboy would say.”
“Please, call me Nicolas,” said Nicolas. “I’ll ask you three things, just three and then you may request what you want. Is that fine with you?
“Stop playing dumb Narcissa,” Bellatrix spat, “I know he’s here with your son, I know they’re dating. So of course he would be here with him for Christmas.”
He listened, silently laughing, as Dumbledore interrogated Longbottom, which should have been the highlight of his entire life, but he was livid that Longbottom had once again stolen his thunder. He pondered saying something, knowing it would be glorious, but took a deep breath and remained silent, listening as Professor Moody started ranting about assassination attempts.
Hermione watched as the two adults laughed at something that made no sense. She had no idea what was funny about Potter, both of them, keeping their wands in good condition. She regularly tended to hers, too, making sure that it was clean, smudge-free, and had no dirt or grime anywhere on it.
“Of course,” said Draco as he buttered some toast. “As long as the secret is worth knowing and not something stupid.”
“You’re in such denial Harry, one day you admit your feelings then the next you hide them again, why are you scared?”
Hermione let out an indignant sound and had a facial expression that looked as if someone had kicked, then stolen her only puppy, and maybe even beheaded her teddy bear. “Neville!” she said. “Books are a valuable source of knowledge.”
James trailed behind his wife and the Healer, trying to mentally prepare for what he was about to see. He knew, deep down, that the whole situation was serious as most magical people believed in their own methods and would never believe that more magic could create issues. Of course, healers were a little different from the standard witches and wizards that believed magic was everything and not having it would be devastating to their own wellbeing and lifespan.
Lee Jordan wasn’t happy about the result of the match. He doubted that no Gryffindor was. “Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Harry Potter receives one hundred and fifty points for catching the Snitch.”
The more time he spent in the forest, the more he felt like something was different about it. Something that he could not explain, even if he knew every small detail about it. It was steadily unnerving him, causing him to squint at nearby plants that seemed to move on their own.
That’s how Harry spent the remainder of the first month of the school holidays, hiding in the room under his bedroom and brewing a potion that he kept a secret, a very big secret. Of course, he was rather social, when he needed to be, and spoke to everyone in the house. It also led to him hunting for an alert type ward that went off in the room below when someone was approaching the door to his bedroom, which allowed him to quickly dart from the room and get into a façade of a position, mostly reading as it took the least effort to replicate.
“Draco didn’t have the idea to look at the Shrieking Shack, did he?” said Harry. “You wanted to stand outside and gape at the building from afar? How pathetic. I am not wasting my time with something unless I can see it all.”
Harry bit his bottom lip and glanced at the Slytherin table, “can I be resorted?” Harry ignored everyone gasping, mainly from the Gryffindor house.
If Narcissa noticed the somewhat cold and detached tone from the boy, she said nothing and nodded. “Farewell, Harry,” she said, making her way towards her son, who gave her a curious glance. She herded the two boys out and allowed Harry to get dressed in privacy. “Keep an eye on him, Draco, I fear that something isn’t right.”
“A different manner?” said Harry, scratching his head. “I wonder if this has anything to do with you-know-what.”
“Sir,” said Hermione quickly, her bushy hair blowing into the side of Ron’s face. “We’ve done Boggarts, Red Caps, Kappas and Grindylows. We’re just about to start on –”
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.
“Potter is over there! I swear he reads more than you,” said Ron and rubbed the side of his face. “I swear he lives in the library.”
“A bit of both, if I am going to be fully truthful,” said Atieno. “Each of the talents he possessed now has a stigma attached to them, no matter how beneficial the talent may have been. Perhaps, for some twisted reason, that was his intention. Some of them had a stigma already, such as Parseltongue, but his actions made it worse.”
“Something is off about this event,” said Vasily, sighing. “I had my suspicions from the moment I came here that something weird was happening, but I just couldn’t place it. You don’t enter my profession and not develop the ability to learn when something bad is going to happen. My stomach is churning, which means it’s telling me something bad is going to happen. I’m not sure about you, but I trust my stomach.”
“Excuse me, Weasley,” said Draco, highly offended. “Harry’s most likely going to help the first-year students as they’re scared. He’s a model student, you know.”
Harry conjured a fire whip and flicked it at Ron’s feet, Ron jumped backwards with a furious look on his face. ‘
“Harry! Happy Birthday lad!” said David, pulling up a chair next to the boy. “I was debating about getting you a porn mag, as is tradition for a boy going into his teenage years, but I had no idea what you’re into and handing minors illicit material is against the law.”
It took him by complete surprise when he was swept from the room in a twirl by something and deposited harshly onto the sand below. The cheers were deafening and the sand that erupted around him by his impact caused him to cough and splutter as it went down his throat.
“Aha!” said Professor Moody, leaning forwards. “I can see it now. Back to the topic at hand, Mr Potter is now the seventh wizard to use their head in this classroom. I had no idea the students would be so far behind and so uneducated.”
Voldemort decided to go and talk to Harry. “So, Harry Potter, why did you decide to kill yourself?” Voldemort turned his focus to Harry, “the best you can remember, we need something to do.”
“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid rather grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.” He led the students from the small clearing and passed through a rather dense forest area. “Never try an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy star-gazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”
Draco forced down the snort that threatened to rise the most Harry spoke so seriously about it and just smiled at him as he dropped down onto the stool that was lined across the back of the room. “I’m sure that in time I’ll grow to appreciate that highly dangerous technique. Sadly, I’m not a lunatic on a broom and I may never even try it again.”
“Trying to explain it to him will be a waste of time,” said Atieno, smoothly cutting in. “I have known you for more than eight hundred years and even I cannot grasp what exactly you do.”
“Of course, I don’t doubt for a minute that you believed that they asked eleven year old children to fight a troll,” continued Harry in a bored tone of voice. “Let’s just ignore the fact that most fully grown adults struggle against them because of their high immunity to magic. Use your brain, Weasley.”
“Now, as there’s a few minutes left before the lesson actually starts, let’s discuss Mr. Flint. What will you do about him? How can you know him down and attempt to take his place?”
Harry pulled from the memory and sighed. He cursed the fact that he had acted so rash and allowed his inner emotions to take over and make him do something so foolish. Even if the vase had fallen on Granger’s head, there were plenty of witnesses and various people that would be checked by the Aurors. He didn’t care about the consequences of the vase hitting Granger at that moment in time… he just wanted the girl to suffer for thwarting his plans. A very foreign feeling in his usually composed mind, but one that he was able to ignore it and push it aside as once occurring thing.
were the one that assumed he would overreact,” said Salazar, glaring. “I stated that if he was anything like myself, he would track her down with a vengeance. I hated being slandered when I was younger.”
Neville swished around the Bludger, leaving the tell-tale whoosh of a Bludger behind him as he climbed higher and higher. He looped and swooped, spiralled, zig-zagged and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open. Rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as he could. He began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium. A whistling in his ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
“Yes everything is fine, I’m going to get some tea, I’ll send up Twinky when it’s ready, as for you Draco stay here with Harry.” Narcissa smiled.
He always wondered how each descendant of Salazar Slytherin felt, at least those that had pet snakes. Many were afraid of snakes, despite being able to speak to them. That had led him to studying the Gaunt line, which was a family distressing subject to study, as the Gaunt line was once incredibly wealthy, talented, and well-known. These days, the Gaunt line was known for the insane rambling Parselmouths that didn’t know a lick of English. Bedding cousins and siblings was the downfall of that house. They believed that none besides themselves were worthy of the ability to speak to snakes.
“Deal,” Malfoy added enthusiastically and paused for a second, “however, if he does take away points, you have to be my personal slave for a week and go wherever I go.” Draco smirked at Harry, “and of course, you only speak when I say so, and it must not be negative towards me or Slytherin.” Draco laughed, knowing he would have a new slave for a week.
Harry agreed and slowly read the paragraph. He found that it was nothing more than an explanation of the spell and how it worked. There was also a warning and a small line urging people to keep it a secret, even if it was already known. The spell itself could not be cast on your own wand, which meant someone else had to cast it for you.
Lily was in her first year when Narcissa was in her fifth, not only were the two in different Houses, but they hardly even spoke, seeing as Lily’s Muggleborn status ran rampant almost instantly, with a name such as Evans, some doubted that she was Muggleborn, and instead that she was from the Evans line that was from France.
“I don’t understand,” said Jude, eating a carrot. “How’s a position on a Quidditch team relevant after school?”
Neville’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding towards them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard. “Hagrid!” Neville cried in relief. “I was lost… Floo powder…”
Mr. Weasley paled slightly. “What is Harry doing? Walking around in Knockturn Alley when he’s the son of the head Auror, he’s rather well-known and would be instantly targeted by any of the people down there,” he continued with that train of thought for a while before turning towards Neville. “As for the last statement, Mr. Borgin would instantly dislike Harry because he’s a half-blood, even if he’s friendly with the Malfoy’s. A lot of his clientele are pure-blooded wizards, therefore he took on their beliefs.”
“So?” the man’s rough voice cut across the street, not loudly, but not exactly silently. “Would you like to come in and look around the house? I have a feeling that you and your son will enjoy the house.”
He realised that, no matter whether he wanted to act on it or not, that he would need to say something and get this man off the proverbial street and into prison, where he belonged. From the few memories he had seen, he needed to be discreet and try and lure James away so that he could explain and make it seem like it was a harmless conversation that did not involve the Head Auror, as the man had no idea who James even was. It all worked in his favour, like a stroke of luck, but it needed to be handled delicately. The man, despite his injuries, would run at the first sign of an Auror.
“Harry,” said Pansy, breathing deeply. “You’re… you’re serious, aren’t you? You do know that people are going to talk – not in a good way, either – and they’re going to ridicule you in the worst way. You’ll be an outcast in every circle of society. This is more than just a statement, this is… this is… I have no words!”
It didn’t take long for Harry to give up and take on his more usual aggressive approach to duelling, bombarding the enemy with spells in an attempt to knock them off their game.
“Well, you see, back in, like, I don’t know – three hundred years ago? Anyway, two boys jumped off the Astronomy Tower together after it got out they were homosexual. They were heavily bullied and no one did anything ‘cos, well, homosexuality was a sin and wrong. Not much has changed, really. After their deaths, the school added protective enchantments on all windows and edges. People really only care when you’re dead. They’ve got a memorial thing down there if you wanna go look. It’s kind of bittersweet. Not something you go and look at when you’re feeling happy. But, yeah, jumping isn’t a good idea. Even if it didn’t bring the professors here, it’s not a good idea.”
Draco laughed, “and what did I apparently plan Potter? Merlin, you’re so paranoid.” Draco grinned as he dug through he pockets.
The sound of Hogwarts landing at the platform snapped Harry out of his thoughts, he didn’t even realize others joined him or hear them say anything to him, which was good; he had no time or patience to deal with them. Harry shoved through first years; he was trying to find Ron and Hermione. “Ron!” Harry shouted, not loudly, but louder than his normal voice. Ron clearly didn’t hear him. “RON!” Harry shouted louder, which drew his attention, plus everyone else who was in the immediate area, including Draco, who sniggered at it.
Harry picked up the note, rolling his eyes and began reading over the note. He deliberately took his time, knowing everyone wanted to know what the note said. “Dear Mr. Potter,” he began dramatically, “because you’re obviously the best flyer in the world, I’m gifting you this broom –”
The parchment flew back onto Dumbledore’s stand and Dumbledore cleared his throat, “Professor Potter’s class is not mandatory, but may be taken by anyone above year two, the class however is not a substitute for Defence Against Dark Arts, nor will Professor Potter teach any students spells under no circumstances. Professor Potter’s first lesson is tomorrow; his assistant will be Professor Snape.”
The building gave him an eerie chill, as if it was inhabited by someone who knew he was looking at it. He glanced towards his cousin and wondered whether he had seen the old building. He didn’t bother to ask when he noticed his cousin was more interested in playing with his fingers rather than looking out at buildings. This was the first time that he ever got a good look at the Smeltings Academy uniform. He just hoped that the lessons were better than the unfirm, as the latter was horrid.
“Light grey, I assume,” said Harry. “Never thought about it too much. Feelings are hard. Anyway, I never got your name. Probably the first thing I should have asked for.”
“Harry, please don’t make this difficult,” said Lily, placing her hand onto her son’s shoulder. “I’m not asking you to like them or send them constant cards and display your appreciation, but I am asking you to act like you do.”
“It’s not Fiendfyre,” he said, flicking his wand in the process. “Those spells you’re casting will be useless. Try the Cooling Charm and some spells that focus on water. It’s a fire of anger, not a fire set on consuming everything. It’s emotional, not a force of destruction.”
Eventually he just smiled and left the table, walking towards the front door with a determined gleam in his eye. He gently opened the door and slid out onto the small little porch thing that was on the Weasley’s doorstep. He stood on the front step and glanced up towards at the sun which was slowly rising in the sky. He knew that the day would be horrible, it was easy to tell just by looking at the sky and it’s slightly depressing air that it was pushing out.
He moved the letter, seeing another one hidden underneath, one that was written in pretty bad English. He saw who it was addressed to and covered it up. While his instincts told him to read the letter, he felt like it would be betraying the small amount of trust that they had formed.
“When I get angry I speak in Parseltongue, I have no idea why, it’s just easier, was I in the wrong house? Should I have been in Slytherin and not Gryffindor? I’m sure I’ll work it out in time, I’ll be back soon, with happier stories, I promise. I love you both.”
“– I personally hid a room, unlike my father, who added a useless wing which was apparently torn down six decades later. I was rather studious and I wanted to keep all my rare tomes I accumulated in my one hundred and thirty-seven years alive hidden.”
“Right, let’s go,” said Neville, jumping down the pipe. It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide.
,” hissed the portrait, displeasure clear in the man’s eyes. He took in the young black-haired boy in front of him with a scowl. “
Harry thought on it silently for a few seconds, his eyebrows furrowing in deep thought. He considered options that most would dismiss and even considered a few that people may think up, even if they were somewhat juvenile and poorly thought up.
“Okay,” Draco cut in before Harry could speak, “mother then slapped me when she heard what I said then gave me chocolates and scolded herself for hitting me. It was really funny honestly, she then told the entire school that ‘I was gay and not for women to flirt with me as I don’t know how a women’s mind works.’ A lot of people love my mother; I was able to tell them it was a joke.”
“Could be his pet snake,” said Fred. “It happened to Ron when he had Scabbers on his shoulder. We assume some pets show up on the map.”
Professor Snape surged forwards. The face the boy made no sound at all when he was hit caused worry to instantly fill him. “Harry?” he gently shook the boy, flicking off pieces of stone from the boy’s chest. “Harry?”
“The letters from my mother and Narcissa will be ignored and it won’t bother me in the slightest at all,” continued Harry, ignoring the three Gryffindors. “I’ll greet you daily as the Mudblood you wish me to call you and I’ll make sure to do it in the most scathing tone I can muster. I’ll even inform the Slytherins to constantly call you it, no matter the consequences.”
“I did know that,” said Harry as he stood up. “I know that some people dislike shoes, but it’s ridiculous to never wear them at all.”
Professor Lupin sighed and went back to folding his papers that had sat on his desk. He had planned for a surprise exam but then he realised that the students, besides a select few, wouldn’t be able to answer most of the questions.
Harry hummed as he slowly made his way towards Draco. “I’m so upset that you kept this from me. We could’ve been doing gardening together and not doing such
“As good as it can be for a Slytherin,” said Ernie bitterly, his quill tapping against his book as he spoke.
“That’s rather rude, Weasley,” said Harry, grinning at the irate girl. “I was going to give you this back, but, y’know, I may just keep it for myself and see what you’ve been writing about in your little diary.”
“Anyway, maybe none of your guards blabbed, but were overheard,” said Harry, looking up. “I’ve heard some pretty interesting things while walking around.”
Harry lifted the parchment. “Daphne Greengrass is –” he paused and screwed up his face. “It could be pissed?”
He caught them, leaning over a piece of parchment, muttering and laughing to themselves about something that was going on. He knew that he was safe from their massive array of pranks and a large assortment of potions that turn people into all kinds of animals that were in development, but he couldn’t help but feel sorry for all the other students.
The man grinned, nodding. “Alright, Harry. The questions aren’t anything personal, like your showering habits – not that you smell! You’ve already answered half the first question, so that’s some progress,” he paused and tapped the notepad with the black biro. “My name’s David, in case you’re wondering. Now, the most important question of all… what’s your full name?”
Every professor swivelled around and looked directly at the old Sorting Hat, which had its crease firmly in place, revealing a mouth.
“It has been a long time since a natural Occlumens sat on this very stool,” said the hat softly. “The only other natural Occlumens I have sorted is of course Salazar Slytherin.”
Harry spun around, trying to figure out where the voice had come from. It sounded as if the person was frozen to the core and shuddered as each letter of the word came out. It was the slow pace that the word was said that made it so creepy.
“You do realize that I could help you, right? I spend a lot of time in here, I see you and your two ‘friends’ searching for something,” continued Harry, air quoting as he said the word friends. “You cannot get into the Restricted Section without a signed note, don’t waste your time.”
“We are going to visit one to give you a small understanding of various magic and the differences that you are going to see,” said Atieno. “There is more to the Dark Arts than just casting dark curses or the stigma attached to it.”
Peter nearly jumped sky-high when he heard Sirius’ question, he was still thinking about what was said, that the war would be over before Harry could walk properly, it was true, it would be. “Nah, I dunno, really… I enjoy being in the Order of the Phoenix and such, but Auror stuff ain’t my strength, not good at it, y’know how I was in school.”
“She’s possessed, Longbottom, nothing you can do to save her,” said Harry. “Stab her with the sword and put her out of her misery. I’m sure she won’t hold it against you when she dies, instead, she’ll thank you.”
“At first you were rather timid and shy of the Slytherins, but you at least attempted to speak to them,” said Draco, his face set in an almost stone-like look. “Now you avoid them, not just them, but everyone, and scowl at anyone who even dares to try and start a conversation with you. When was the last time that you helped Rosier or Theo with their homework? You know how clueless at some subjects they are.”
Albus gave a slight clap, “seeing as Harry Potter left, Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy are the winners.”
Harry muttered under his breath and leant down, hoping to stay out of view until they left. He wouldn’t have really cared what the professors had to say about his adventures as it wasn’t after curfew and he wasn’t breaking any rules. He lifted his head and peered out towards the group of professors and headmaster, who were levitating a stiff body behind them. He heard a sharp intake of breath and glanced towards Neville, who appeared to be a tad paler than he was moments ago.
“Do you think he told the rest of them that our castle is ugly?” said Harry, watching as the rest of the students from Beauxbatons stepped out of the carriage. “A warning so they don’t outwardly offend us by screaming or crying at the sheer sight of the castle?”
“That he did, Minister,” said Severus, walking around a table that contained batches of potion ingredients, phials, and a simmering cauldron. “From what I have learned, Veritaserum aims to attack the mind, which causes the witch or wizard to go mentally numb. That is why they appear so emotionless when under the potion. However, it seems to infiltrate the mind and pull the answers from the mind with little regard to the safety of the witch or wizard.”
“Right, now that we’ve done that,” said Professor Moody, putting the list away, “I think that it’s time to clarify a few core rules. You get one warning, which comes with an instant deduction of thirty points for speaking out of turn, no matter when and where. The second offence is an instant dismissal that is permanent. You’re not children and I will not award any of you points, even if you perform a feat of complex and unheard of magic. You will call this class Defence and that’s it. I don’t want to see or hear the last part of the ‘proper’ name. I’ll teach you to defend against more than just the Dark Arts. Any questions? Yes, Potter?”
Ginny tapped her lips softly, she wasn’t fooled so easily, “that’s right Harry, “ Ginny gave her best fake laugh, “mum will always be fine, I don’t think much could stop her from getting whatever she needed done, does it concern us though?”
“This corridor is creepy,” said Neville, looking at the long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As he shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.
“They’re useful to have during school,” said Harry. “Anyway, what was the plan for today? I assume we’re doing something exciting.”
He had to act quickly. Within moments, he had another spell on his lips and his wand moving in the correct pattern. There was a dead silence as water began pouring from his wand in a funnel, filling the crater almost instantly. He grinned, amazed that it had worked. The crater of water was a future plan, something he
“Stop whispering,” said Professor Snape, directing it at the girls at the back. “A murderer has infiltrated the school, something that should
Harry sighed, feeling as if he was explaining something to Crabbe and Goyle. “Helga Hufflepuff first sought the creatures after noticing that they were cleaning dirt. No one knows where house-elves come from, nor their name prior to that. Rowena Ravenclaw had a theory that they were the lower-class elves and banished from another realm, but she dubbed that theory childish. Salazar assumed the same, except a little different. House-elves have more power than us, in every sense of the word. They’re much like goblins in the sense that they have a lot of raw power, just no way to direct it.”
Ernie laughed, his head nodding to the statement. “I must admit, they’re pretty noisy when you’re trying to do something. I was paired with Ron Weasley for a while and that was horrid. I hope that I don’t have much classes with them.”
Snape pulled his head from the Pensieve and held back the tears, he stood as firmly as he could, “Harry if you could give me a minute to process this, I would appreciate it. I’ll contact you about it at a later date.”
“But…” Neville trailed off, staring at the silver serpent that was engraved expertly into the sink. He had only ever spoken Parseltongue once, and that was when facing a snake. Of course with Hermione’s help, he had done a little study on the subject, but he never wanted to speak the language again. “I don’t – I don’t think I can, Ron,” he stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real. “Open!” he turned to Ron, disappointment plastered over his face.
“I’m so glad that you all made it,” said Nott, smiling. “I understand that the location moved and I’m sure the very few of you are curious about that.”
“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”
“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!’ cried Dumbledore. He gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snake-like into words. “Everyone pick their favourite tune,” he said, “and off we go!”
Filius stood; at least it looked like he did, “Roger Davies will be Ravenclaw’s captain.” Roger stood and gave a slight bow.
“Mopsy, if someone is going to enter the kitchen, could you perhaps vanish until they leave?” said Harry, wincing as someone walked straight by the door and knocked a few times.
The woman made a humming sound and placed the antidote to Veritaserum into the boy’s mouth. She leant back and rubbed her forehead.
“Well,” said Narcissa. “Your excuse is terrible and flaws, but that doesn’t matter. You did break one fundamental rule of Slytherin. Don’t get caught.”
“Please get the white one patterned one,” said Professor Trelawney, unbothered that her teapot had just been broken.
“They say that the issues lies with the teacher and not the student,” said Harry smugly, his smile wide. “So, really, it’s your fault and not mine. The issue lies with you and your dreadful ability to teach me French.”
Hermione sighed, “Harry wants to die, something is bothering him, it just doesn’t seem right. Harry would never charge in here and attack people.” Hermione said angrily, she focused on Harry even more. “Oh Merlin, Ron look… he’s casting without a wand!” Hermione gasped while speaking, making most of it muffled.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, conversation with you is much like it is with Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore, his beard twitching slightly. “Your greetings are genuine and proper, but Mr. Potter tends to lace his words with false enthusiasm and hidden emotions.”
Harry sidestepped another thrust of the goblin’s spear. He had long given up trying to block the spear with his flimsy sword that never seemed to cooperate in his strikes. He understood tradition and knew that the goblins favoured hand-to-hand combat, but this duel, if it could even be called that, was trying his patience. He was about three seconds away from pulling out his wand and blasting the goblin across the sandy arena.
He did debate about going for a walk, seeing as day was surprisingly warm and rather hot, around the block of the cookie cutter houses in an attempt to clear his head from the thoughts and irritation that seemed to lurk in it. He glanced out the window of his room and looking at the formation of clouds that had formed in the sky, doing nothing to hinder the heat that was pushing down on the street.
Harry sat in his bedroom, his legs crossed as he stared at the blank wall to his right. He had the blinds drawn and allowed no light into his brooding state of mind. His mind flickered with foreign feelings that would have most Slytherins concerned that he was showing weakness, even if that was just a stereotype forced to be held. No one in Slytherin cared if you had emotions or not. He was concerned about his present, about his future, and about how everything would happen.
“You can bet they have,” said Dumbledore. “Some get so angry that they would rather see the world in ruin rather than thriving. I never personally thought about everyone having the same amount of magic. It does make sense yet also lends to the theory you may become more powerful the more you age.”
“His cousin is your class, as such, it’d be wise to pair them together,” said the principle. “Mr. Dursley, make room for your cousin.”
He stood and squinted at the haze, willing it to go away. He had spent what seemed like years traversing this haze filled area. He knew where the trees, lakes, and mountains were. The voice seemed like it was last in the direction he was facing. He made sure to not turn or change direction.
“Must you be so mean to Ron?” said Neville, sounding somewhat defeated. “He’s not bad once you get to know him.”
“According to Lucius, the Ministry decided to stagger the arrivals due to something that happened years and years ago,” said Harry, ignoring the black mass that Arthur was point towards. “Something about people merging into each other due to ill-timed arrivals. Some of the cheaper tickets have had people there since the day they were sold. Most tickets, depending on the cost, have a certain time or time group that you arrive in. For example, I really couldn’t have attended with Draco because he arrives about five minutes before the game officially starts, whereas we were set to arrive the morning of the World Cup.”
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making all three of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll out cold with a bloody lump on its head.
“I’m not cleaning anything,” said Harry. “Do you remember what happened the last time that they forced me to do the dishes?”
“Look you fuck; I am tired of you and your shit. Stay away from my family, Fred and George and Ginny, neither of them like you.”
“Yes, mother, I’m done here – I’d like to ask a question though, if you don’t mind,” said Harry and glanced at the shabby looking tables in the pub with mild disgust.
Ron sat next to Seamus and Neville the three of them got rather close, since Harry was gone and Ron debated making these two his new best friends, but he still felt bad for Hermione, who had no friends really. He grabbed a plate of food and joined in the conversation about potions, and the announcement that would happen for it sometime tomorrow, Ron was really hoping Snape was fired.
“I don’t believe it, call me Rita Skeeter junior, but I’m twisting this.” Pansy laughed and let Harry through.
The following month seemed as if went by in nothing but a quick blur, as if the entire world had apparated a month into the future, which was impossible. Harry did nothing but study and read all day, every day. He did slow down when Nagini became unbearable went into ‘mother hen’ mode and saw to it that her human was healthy.
"Behave, Harry." At some point, Draco must have started thinking of him as Harry, instead of Potter. "Behave, and you'll have a very good evening."
Granger nodded, finally seeing Draco stood there. Her back straightened, mouth setting in a straight line.
"I never expected to see this wand again," she murmured, casting a quick lumos. It burned bright. She smiled.
"Don't ask." Harry and Draco said at the same time. Harry cracked a grin while Draco sat on the arm of his chair.
They watch as Teddy closes his eyes, pouting, focusing on colours. His hair flashes through every colour of the rainbow, momentarily going and straight and platinum - just like Draco's - before landing on his easy pick - black and messy, just like Harry's.
Fucking shit, he thought, dragged out of his thoughts. His finger was bleeding, a long stipe of open flesh leaking fresh blood as he stared at it.
"Ron, we help them learn colours and counting with games, read to them before nap time, and the older ones have started doing math."
"What is it? Did you hit your side when you fell?" Potter's hands were suddenly pressing against his sides where Draco's own hands were clenching. Potter's touches were soft and gentle, tracing over his sides as he searched for injuries.
Stumbling out of bed, searching the room for- for something. His mind raced to find an answer, but none came. Just the dark, thrilling bliss running under his skin.
"Harry, you know I'm not one to judge, but you have to admit this is weird. You both disappeared after the trials, nobody heard anything from you for over five years, and now you're stroking his hair."
Draco went to his rooms to change, then to the kitchens for food. The elves had all scattered at the sight of him, rushing to prepare a meal.
"He refused to kill Dumbledore, he refused to give me up to his dad, and he was forced into pretty much everything he did." Harry forced a hand through his hair, wondering why people hadn't seen that. "He was a scared kid who was doing what he could to survive. Dumbledore never exactly tried to help him get out, so the only choices he had were to go dark or die. What would you have done? What if you'd known that if you chose death, you might be choosing it for your parents, too? He went through so much, and he paid for it. He lost everything, even his family. I can forgive what he did because he can forgive the things we did to him."
The whole morning in the potions lab had been fun - the witches and wizards in there had all welcomed him, testing his knowledge and sharing gossip about the legal and auror teams.
"I love what you've done with the place, Potter," Malfoy said, eyes scouring the wall of children's drawings. "You're a fantastic artist."
"Take it off?" He asks, tugging at the edge of his T-shirt. Draco feels himself nod, pulling the top off. Potter sits back on his heels to stare for a moment, taking in the gentle swell, before leaning forwards to litter kisses over his skin.
He didn't realise he was making a noise until Potter brought his lips to Draco's ear, words dragging across his skin.
This is the last chapter I have pre-written. Now writing on a week-by-week basis, so might not be able to upload every Thursday like I have been.
"Draco!" He ran straight for the blond, dropping the trousers by Harry's chair, wrapping himself around his legs and barrelling the man over.
Draco's mind blanks out, coming back from his wolf as he straddles Potter's waist on the carpet. He doesn't know how they ended up there, but Draco's hands are on Potter's chest, twisting his nipples through his shirt. Draco doesn't want to move.
Harry shivered. He'd expected that look - the caress of his body. Not from Malfoy, but the blond of his fantasies.
"Yes," Draco bites out, straightening his back. Potter dips his head to Draco's neck, placing a faint kiss there, before kneeling and placing another kiss to his belly button.
"Last time I had a proper drink, I fell asleep at a very bad moment." He ignored Draco's snort, tapping him in the side with his foot. "I'm not great with alcohol, and I'd rather not fuck up using the floo when I haven't used one in years."
Draco was furious. How dare Potter come into his home, eat his jam, and make him feel like he wasn't allowed to wear his own bloody pyjamas at his own bloody breakfast table.
That was when Fleur looked up, presumably to greet Teddy and Andromeda, and spotted Harry sat in his armchair.
He could do it himself. Of course he could do it himself, but this was a principle. A game they always played. A game that had – as long as Draco could remember – ended the same.
"I thought you said you were going to shave it all off?" Draco asked, leaning forwards on Harry's desk to peer at the girl. "You said having hair was too much of a drama."
"That's no time to see the whole Department! I'll take you with me when I leave here, give you a tour of where you'd be working."
Draco realised he'd spent too long just staring at Harry's arms, managing to drag his eyes up to the man's face.
“Potter, you are allowed to say the word wedding without being hexed. Enduring my attempts at muggle cooking can be just as torturous, and I  doubt you want a repeat of my last attempt.”
Then he'd nuzzled up to him, inhaling the pure, sweet scent at that wonderful point on his neck, and slipped back inside.
“So he’s still trying to get the kids?” Draco asked himself, sifting through the bags Hermione had left on the counter.”
"So, this is the legal area?" Draco asked, eyeing the array of desks. There had to be at least fifty, spread out across the room.
“Did I hear someone say tea?” A voice chimes in. Draco turns to the doorway, finding Luna leaning against the doorframe. He could make out a ginger head behind her, standing on tip-toes to check the shelves.
Harry laughed, wondering if Draco would forgive him if he didn't save him. He wasn't sure, but he knew it would be ugly, painful, and definitely wouldn't follow his master plan of getting Malfoy in his bed. Or maybe he should scale that plan back to just getting him on a second date. A second date that ends in the bedroom.
It was big, white, and flooded with natural light. On two of the walls were magical windows - one showing a golden beach lined with palm trees, the other showing a vineyard. Desks were scattered around the office, piled high with paperwork. Boards speckled the space, covered in notes and papers, occasionally turned to a witch or wizard to add some new piece of information.
"I did," she agreed, grinning. Then her eyes locked on Draco's long, unstyled hair and pounced on him. "You should let the kids do your hair! I can send Kay the pictures."
"I've wanted you since the moment I saw you in my shop." Harry admitted, nose traversing the skin of Draco's neck. The place his mark should be was burning, begging for him to be claimed, but he had to hold back.
Hermione looked doubtful, watching the way her old friend ran his hands through the blond's hair, leaning down so Draco could whisper something in his ear, making Harry laugh.
Only Draco's mind didn't go to peace. It went with his eyes, straight to Potter's cock beneath his robes.
The business meeting happened in the ball pit. Harry was tired of wondering how it began, but Ron seemed to relax. Maria joined them, leaving the lunch scene to Jo and Sophie. She was juggling, explaining how they structure the day around fun learning and building manners.
Draco's hands are still on his pecs, fingers working in lazy circles. "Please?" He asks, letting his wolf beg for what it wants.
Draco shivered at the thought, carefully lowering himself onto his back. He could feel Potter's eyes on him as his head dropped over the other end of the table. Predatory.
Hermione was knocking on Harry's door first thing Sunday morning, long before the sun had risen above the houses.
"I INVITED YOU OVER FOR TEA. FUCKING TEA, SEAMUS. HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO BLOW UP AN ORDER OF WOLFSBANE THIS SOON BEFORE IT GETS COLLECTED? MERLIN'S FUCKING BOLLOCKS GET OUT OF MY SHOP BEFORE I GO OUT OF BUSINESS!"
I said I wouldn't let it affect my writing schedule, but the real world demanded I go to work and actually earn money, so that happened.
"Its the day. I'm here to take the wards down and end your house arrest. Did you say this jam is cherry?"
"Yeah, we're pretty happy with how far we've come. Although I want to start offering services for younger ones. We specify 18 months minimum, but I want to offer space for those younger. Lots of single parents out there who need somewhere to put their kids so they can work."
It felt as if everyone else had already gotten impatient, even the kids. They were always planning and re-planning the day, begging to know when it was happening.
"Made with the cherry trees in the grounds," his mother explained, setting herself a bowl of fruit. "Draco has a job at the Ministry now, thanks to you."
Harry found them in the tapestry room, Teddy sat on the floor drawing, Draco gingerly touching a burn mark.
It was bad enough that he hadn’t finished decorating the nursery – the git wanted to do it the Muggle way, for fuck’s sake – but now he had also eaten all the custard creams.
"We were thinking of putting Rose into a daycare," he answered, nodding down at the girl hugging his leg.
“No wedding talk, I know. Come on, we’ve got a three week training course coming up and I don’t want anyone leaving in worse shape than they show up in.”
“Hi,” she said, pushing past him to get inside. “Thanks for opening the door. I thought you might be low on food, so I brought some stuff over. Also got some old baby stuff that Rose and Hugo don’t use anymore, I thought it may be useful.”
"Fuck," Potter whimpered as Draco's tongue finally - finally - licked a filthy stripe over the head of his cock.
Potter had taken him by the elbow, steering him through the crowd. He'd nodded at the people on the desk, not bothering to stop as they walked straight past. Veering him through the corridors, past the elevators, deep into the heart of the Ministry.
Draco didn't wait to hear what Potter responded with - didn't even pause to see the look on his face. He simply whirled on his heel and ran all the way to his room, slamming doors and sobbing as he went.
But Harry wasn't interested in grinding like horny teenagers. He wanted - needed - to be inside him. Needed to feel Draco's heat. Taste him and mark him up so nobody else could lay a hand on him.
The Ministry had tasked him with home brewing, experimenting with new ways to make potions kinder on the drinker.
He was dressed in his best robes - dark grey, shining in the right light - paired with charcoal trousers and a perfectly tailored waistcoat.
Draco's mother hadn't been in the drawing-room. After throwing on what he'd been able to grab - underwear, shirt, trousers - he crept through the Manor. She wasn't even in the Manor.
They sat down, Malfoy putting his coat at the end of the booth. It was small - not bad small. Intimate small. Their thighs were pushed together, and Harry realised in a world where it hadn't been him, Malfoy would have taken every opportunity to touch the man he was seeing.
Potter moved forward, cock slipping straight into Draco, leaning over him until lips and teeth met flesh.
Potter pulls out, cock still twitching, staring at where his cum was leaking from Draco's arse. He seemed transfixed, tongue darting out to wet dried lips as he watched.
Draco fell off the chair laughing when Hermione started yelling at him, perfectly in time with Molly, while Ron and Arthur handed small fistfuls of coins to George.
Draco was moaning before he knew it, logic abandoning him as he dug nails into Potter's perfect hips and sucked as hard as he could with every thrust.
Potter seemed to accept this, yielding to Draco's hands and letting himself be guided into position.
"Harry, you seemed awfully familiar with Malfoy at the party last week. More than if you'd only met him a handful of times." She held a hand out for the mug Harry handed her, pausing to take a sip. "I saw the way you were looking at him."
"Just in here for the two of you," te waitress said, placing menus in a small booth. "Would you like me to take your coats?"
"Potter, I need you to understand something. I want you in my mouth. I'll control the speed, but you're the one who needs to move. Got it?"
"Since when did Potter ever know a thing about style?" Harry closed his eyes, trying to block out the sound.
While his hands worked on Potter's belt, Draco busied himself leaving bites and bruises as far up Potter's neck as he could reach.
"Keep laughing, just you wait." Draco laughed even harder, reaching a hand up to grab Harry's bicep. "Arrogant prat."
"Yeah," Jenna answers, standing a little taller. Shoulders back, head held high, smile dazzling. Her business pose. "We're at full capacity, but if we get someone else in we can look to take on some more kids. The business next door is selling their premises, and if we can secure some new staff, we can go ahead and buy it. Expand the space, combine their outdoor space with ours to make a massive outdoor play area."
"Dear, how about you have something to eat and go get dressed? I hardly think that an appropriate outfit for having guests over."
"Harry here wrote to me when you were away," his mother began, ignoring the snarl he sent at Potter. "He explained your condition had flared. Draco, you should have told me things were changing."
That was a lie. It very clearly came from one of those magazines Draco had bought. The ones he ordered his... toys through.
"Its main clientele are people who would rather not be seen in less discreet establishments. Lots of politicians and low-level celebrities. Or anyone with a preference for privacy."
"I- may have headed the initiative with Hermione. We started just wanting to reverse some of the laws Umbridge put in, but it spiralled. More people came on board than we thought, and within six months we'd started sending free potions to anyone who signed up."
"No. Walburga did. Burned off everyone she considered a traitor." Harry explained, placing the bowls on a small table in the corner. "Ted, come eat."
They were itching worse than normal - a stubborn, constant itch just beneath the surface of his skin.
Harry followed Jenna's gaze, seeing little Rose sat at one of the dining tables, legs swinging as she stared out at the other playing children.
An unbound Omega, with a young child and a sharp tongue. Nobody in their right mind would house him, let alone hire him.
He had a gentle, lopsided smile. The kind he reserved for Scorpius and the young boy he looked after - Teddy.
“Draco?” He asked, moving up behind him and taking hold of his wrist, examining the cut. It wasn’t deep, but it was bleeding heavily. “Let me get a bandage. What the fuck were you doing to not see your own hand?”
"We've got a secret entrance. Not everyone's great about the Department, so we kept things on a need to know basis."
"Till tomorrow afternoon. Maybe Monday. Andromeda hasn't been well lately, so I have him most weekends. Gives her time to rest." Draco hums, eyes wondering. "When was the last time you were here?"
He'd seen how Harry was with Teddy - how he'd become with Scorpius. He'd let himself begin dreaming that maybe - just maybe - he could have that kind of future with Harry.
Determined not to work himself up with no time to let out any pent up energy, Harry forced his mind on something else.
"I won't make it to the floo bay," Draco whispers, trying to take a calming breath. Instead, all he can smell - all he can scent - is Potter. It's thick and cloying, filled with holly wood and lemon.
Something warm and slick was... well it was leaking out of somewhere unspeakable. Draco could hear his wolf in his mind, begging for Potter's cock to push through the slick.
Draco's body aches when he awakes, cushioned by soft pillows and silk sheets. Every inch of him aches - much like after a transformation - but this time there's something else mixed with the ache. A pleasant rush, humming just beneath his skin, honing in on his mark.
"If you sign up for a whole year, you get five days a week for the price of three." Harry explained, looking to Hermione for help.
Potter's eyes fixed on him, unwavering. "No. A lot of people pushed for a lot of changes after the war. There's a team that deals with all the legal stuff, so if anyone refuses to hire you or commits a crime against you because of your condition, you can contact them. The medical team are researching the physical effects on the body, and they work with a group of potion brewers to send out Wolfsbane and any other potions needed."
“You were drifting. Merlin, you’ve been losing your head recently. You nearly walked into the road yesterday!”
Smooth skin went on for miles, the only mark from where they had cut him open to take Scorpius out. But even that scar was smooth and shining, a promise of what was possible with this man.
“You know you do have to choose a date at some point, don’t you?” This time she was brandishing wedding books, littered with pictures of red and golden leaves, forcing them into his arms. “I’m sure Harry would be delighted to have a date in mind.”
Harry's teeth had torn through the skin, sending sparks shooting down Draco's spine as he came undone once more.
“Does that mean we don’t get to have any more fun until you choose a date?” Draco sucked in a breath as he realised what Harry was doing – both with his words and his hands.
"Harry, someone's at the door!" Teddy cried, running circles around the kitchen table, hair flashing wildly between red and blue.
Once Harry had gained enough of his sense back, he picked Draco up from the floor and took him to bed.
"You are a lovely pair," Luna said, studying a jar of salve Draco had made her for the children she cared for. "You must let me know when the wedding is, I'll take some time off to help prepare."
"Ron, shut it." He shot back, glaring at the redhead before turning a softer gaze to Draco. "You've got brewing experience?"
"Can't we?" Harry asked, and Merlin the look in his eye right then. If they had been alone - if Draco hadn't been stupid enough to get pregnant - he would have been on his knees for the Alpha in front of him.
Once Andromeda had floated out the food, everyone had happily retired to different corners of the living room, talking in quiet groups. Teddy had pulled Victoire and Rose off to his room to show them his pictures, followed by a curious Luna and worried Ron, still cradling a baby to his chest.
Draco whipped around, storming back to the table, picking up his mug and the pot of coffee, before turning and heading straight back to his room.
"Lycanthropy in the new advancing stage causes an increase in fertility rates. We have a young woman at the moment who couldn't have children - tried for years, got told she had such low rates it was impossible - but now she can! Her rates have tripled over her last two changes. This could change everything."
"I've been overseeing every batch made for you," Potter said simply. "We had one incident where they found out who they were supplying and tried to change it. I make sure that doesn't happen anymore. Nobody in the brewing team knows who they're brewing for. It could be a five-year-old girl or Greyback for all they know. They make it, I check it and seal it, then an owl takes each parcel wherever it needs to go."
Draco sat down in his favourite seat - the one opposite Potter - and poured himself a cup of coffee.
Harry looked up to see a large glass building, surrounded by bags of compost and small potted plants, “Mags, we're at the garden centre. Is this really where wizards are flooing to?”
The car jolted to a stop and Harry clambered out not sparing Dudley or Vernon a single glance. Maggie would help him. He only needed to survive the school day which was easier said than done.
Flopping back onto his small makeshift bed, Harry sighed. It wasn't his fault that Dudley’s new cricket bat had suddenly shrunk… well maybe it was a little bit his fault but Dudley didn't have any proof, he wasn't smart enough for that sort of thing. Dudley just assumed that it was him and Harry had ended up pinned down in a flower bed of daffodils with Dudley trying to split his skull in two. Thankfully, like with many things Dudley had failed and Aunt Petunia had called Dudley in for dinner before any further damage could be done.
The snake replied, shifting his cool body tighter around Harry. Harry nodded along with a smile, agreeing with the snake.
Veneno was a great source of comfort to Harry, he felt that he would at least have someone he could trust left. Furthermore, his aunt had taken to giving him slightly irregular potions lessons which gave him something to focus on. Writing essays on the different applications of the wideye potion certainly took his mind off of Magdelena still not responding after four whole days.
Harry browsed the many thick tomes in a cramped nook of the library: dark curses, runic guides, blood magic… Becoming a dark wizard,
“Thank you auntie,” Harry smiled with ease before returning to his room to write out a letter to confirm his attendance to send off with the owl.
She needed a thestral for her plans and the thestral she planned to use was currently harnessed to the carriage with a ministry worker on it. She’d been studying undetectable mental compulsions for months and had found the perfect one. A sleep compulsion that would leave the target asleep temporarily for a maximum of two hours and cause them to wake up feeling refreshed with no suspicion of spell work (Magdalena felt as though it had been created with much more illicit purposes in mind, having found it in a book with spells bordering black magic).
”Well well... I didn’t know ministry workers had taken to riding thestrals, or drawing the dark mark on themselves for that matter,” Bellatrix gave a raspy laugh, which her fellow death eaters echoed.
Harry sighed as he looked down the page, Mags tended to write far too much, although he appreciated her thoughts. While feeling slightly guilty he skipped towards the end of the second page.
he is wonderful and a powerful ally, now if you will excuse us we have a game of quidditch to play.” Maggie said curtly. Walburga narrowed her eyes at Harry, but seemed to concede.
Breakfast had become easier to make after Harry had a growth spurt so he'd come to enjoy the process even more. Although the Dursley’s remained predictable, only ever wanting bacon, eggs and sometimes toast if they were feeling particularly fancy. Harry plated the food up and sat on one of the stools waiting for his aunt to come down. Harry was grateful that, after the incident with Vernon, Aunt Petunia had been a lot kinder to him. She wasn't Harry's favourite person, but she was in Harry's top ten (not that it was much of an achievement considering Harry only knew about ten people).
Maggie took a shuddering breath, “I have the means to raise him with time. I have the power and I can learn the spells. If you let me take Sirius and keep him out of your war then you have my word.”
“I suppose it would be an opportunity to buy some more exotic potions ingredients and I can’t trust you to go anywhere alone,” Petunia recalled the time Harry had gone to the park and she had to retrieve him five hours later as he was sat unmoving on the swing set in a sort of fugue state. Frankly she’d been tempted to give him multiple calming draughts in that moment, but wasn’t willing to deal with potentially overdosing her nephew and making the situation worse. Harry now carried two calming draughts with him at any time and had an entire boxful to take to Hogwarts. Wait- was she actually worrying for him?
It didn't take Harry too long to get his broom to rise into his hand and take off. The real difficulty he had was when Maggie began listing the rules. Harry felt like his brain was turning to sludge and like he was sinking into the floor, it made it hard to concentrate. Luckily, Maggie let him have some of her thin black bracelets to wear and play with, which helped Harry feel a little more real. Eventually Maggie just gave up on the complicated explanation and asked Harry which position he wanted to play first.
“Yep. I’ll be going to meet them soon,” Harry said, standing up and holding the parcel to his chest.
As Sirius leapt halfheartedly onto Maggie’s lap, the glare he gave her, even in his animagus form, assured her that they would be having a talk when she got  home.
Later that evening, Harry settled down on his bed with the book he had taken from the Black library and began to read.
He felt confusion bubble in his head and reached out to Veneno for comfort. The snake was rarely around and so Harry liked to enjoy his presence when he could.
“Oh, of course you wouldn't know, he was the headmaster of Hogwarts many years ago and now he's stuck as a portrait on Albus’s wall. It's saddening. Albus was going on and on, darling, he really wants to know more about you. Don't worry though, Phineas wouldn't tell him you've been here.”
Harry pulled the book off of the shelf and traced the golden lettering with his fingers, entranced by the feeling of the soft leather beneath his fingertips and the occasional flicker or dark magic. Harry quickly stuffed the book into his coat pocket.
“Thank you. I have so much to tell you about cousin! Aunt Walburga is dead and is now on the wall near the library. Dumbledore is up to something and Harry starts Hogwarts this autumn!” Maggie enthused, as London grew closer.
“Family, then? How lovely and what an interesting coincidence, I've just been hearing about you from Phineas. You are quite a remarkable child, Harry,” Dorea said with a smile.
“What on earth was that? You do know you just made a blood pact with Bella? You do know what you promised?” Sirius ranted at her, his voice was raspy and quiet, but he still managed to get his point across.
“Nice. Potion making shortcuts is a nightmare to try and get these days. For Hogwarts everything gets taught the long way so most shops don't sell it,” Maggie sighed.
“Follow me then, we wouldn't want to hold you up,” he replied, leading them towards the back room, “She’s through there, I hope you have your flowers ready.” Eric muttered as he opened the door.
Harry sighed. He tried to focus and found himself able to somewhat connect with his surroundings as he stroked Veneno’s scales.
“Umm, yeah?” Harry said, slightly confused, “I've got to get back to Mags now. I'll see you again soon, Lady Dorea. It was nice to meet you,” Harry returned her smile, as best he could, while backing away.
Just a warning for violence at the beginning of the chapter it's nothing particularly graphic, but just a heads up. I hope you enjoy regardless. <3
When they reached the top of the stairs they saw a portrait of a small woman screaming at them. Maggie curtsied and pulled Harry down beside her, “I have a guest, Lady Walburga. We'll be upstairs and we will be sure not to disturb you.”
Next came the matter of fixing his glasses. The sellotape was relatively easy to find but wrapping it around his glasses to make them wearable had been an ordeal, he'd thought about using magic to fix them but he was tired and not looking to push his luck and be left with no glasses at all.
Harry's hands were shaking as he put on his uniform to head to school, it was far too big but at least Aunt Petunia had given him a belt to hold up the trousers. Aunt Petunia, Harry didn't like the woman, he'd go as far as to say he hated her but it hadn't been on purpose. Right? It was an accident.
