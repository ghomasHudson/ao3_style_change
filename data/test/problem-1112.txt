Draco ducked his head, fists clenching again. He didn’t know what to say but at the moment all he wanted was to see how Potter was doing because no, he did not feel better now. In fact, his calmed nerves were making him feel even more terrible; ashamed and embarrassed.
handful.”
his mother awkwardly cleared his throat. Draco turned back sharply and sprang to his feet, wand already in hand. “
“Whatever.” James waved it off. “So I was gonna swoop down and get Lily, but then
Draco looked down at the shirt for the briefest of moments before looking up again. Luna’s pale eyes had a knowing look about them. “Most colours look good on me.” he replied, trying for a flippant tone that came out sounding too forced. “I like what you’re wearing today though.” he said sincerely. Luna looked lovely in a pale yellow spring dress, her hair tied pulled back into a thick braid with flowers woven in.
“Settle in– he’s an
The funny thing was, Potter had almost looked
Draco had forgotten about dinner with his aunt and cousin, and much as he was enjoying Ginny’s company, he was also immensely fond of any time spent with his little cousin. He rose to his feet.
to. I assure you I do.” he said with a not too subtle nod at the front of his trousers that were tented rather impressively. “But I fear that if I don’t leave soon, you won’t be checking up on the children anytime soon as I’ll end up ravishing you right here on this porch.”
“Potter, get your hand off me before I hex it off.” Draco was working on autopilot now. It was almost as if he was trapped in a body that wasn’t his own. One that had a cold face and a cruel voice and said things that hurt Harry.
“Took you long enough,” Draco grumbles, lower lip jutting out in a pout. “Lift your arm.”
This whole ridiculous ‘outing’ had been a mistake right from the start. He’d already been hexed at, had rubbish chucked at him, and been called just about every rude name he knew and then some. One witch had even
“What the fuck?”
Draco recoiled in revulsion, practically choking on his disgust. His wand was in hand with a flick of his wrist, and he would have assuredly ended up in Azkaban that very day if another voice hadn’t spoken up indignantly.
“You should dress in
“You can do it, Draco!”
“Lily,” he tried again. He really didn’t want another one of Potter’s offspring using him as a human tissue again. “If I promise to visit you all will you let go?”
“I will
“Frankly speaking, yeah.”
Draco gave himself a sharp mental slap.
Even though he was looking at him, Draco still jumped when Potter spoke. “Excuse me?”
Draco hadn’t known his aunt for very long, but he already loved her. She was delightful company and very much like his mother, if you discounted the lack of dramatics that his mother was prone to employing. More than anything though, she made his mother happy. She’d smiled and laughed more in the past few days than she’d done in years, and as Draco saw this difference, he couldn’t help feeling like an arse for ever leaving her alone. He was glad Aunt Dromeda was back in her life now.
Draco agreed wholeheartedly. “She was rather amusing actually.” He took a sip from his drink and was met with a burst of chocolate and caramel. He sighed happily.
Draco felt that he
“Harry,
Draco stared in horror. “Merlin help us all,” he groaned and the other three wizards nodded in agreement, looking equal parts terrified.
“Weasley.”
Draco laughed. “Now that, I can easily believe.”
...sticking out all over the place. He seemed to be wearing a shirt that had to be at least ten sizes too big for him and an ugly pair of baggy pants. Add to that, the fact that he was also wearing only one sock and no shoes and was looking around with the eyes of a fanatic, Draco concluded that in the years following the War, Potter had finally gone round the bend.
“What’s there to understand? It’s simple. I haven’t been in contact with Blaise since I picked the wrong side of the War, but back when we did talk, we made a bit of a bet in fifth year. I bet that the Weasel would end up with Granger while he bet that Granger would end up with
. Aunt Dromeda had obviously held more weight in Kreacher’s eyes, although Draco couldn’t say that it offended him in the least. Truth be told, he found the elf’s slave-like adoration for him quite creepy.
“Alright.”  Draco replied and he hated himself for still feeling the ghost of Potter’s hold on his hand.
Potter was biting his lower lip now. “And you... like boys, right?”
Mercury gave a hoot as if to second him. Draco pulled out of the grate and flopped onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. So apparently his friends had abandoned him after finding out what an utter prick he was. And yes, Draco was fully aware that what he’d done to Potter was beyond prick-ish.
“You already knew what I really was so don’t act so surprised,” he answered loftily. “Besides, he’s my cousin, and family has always been very important to me.”
“Okay, I’ll admit that the fact that you did that to Smith made me want to do a bit of a happy dance back there, and possibly take a picture of the whole thing to show Ron but honestly, all that for a robe! Plus he got there first.”
A sly look came into his mother’s eyes. “So, you’re on
for her. Robes of the richest burgundy with bronze trimmings, that would bring out the vivacity of her hair and the paleness of her skin. Hell, they’d even make her freckles look elegant!
“What does that have to do with anything?” Potter asked impatiently. “Al, don’t pull Daddy’s hair.”
“I’m sorry, alright.” Draco bowed his head in surrender. “You could have at least asked them to wait until you returned. Did you?”
“We don’t want you here,” someone else called out shrilly. “Diagon Alley doesn’t welcome your sort.”
. You lot better not try anything or else.”
“Is that her?” Pansy hissed from the fireplace. “Draco move, I can’t see.”
Ginny looked out at where the sun was already starting to set. “Shall we call it a draw and stop for the day? It’ll be dark soon and I need to service my broomstick before I put it away.”
“Go on then, blow,” Potter whispered, and was it just Draco’s perverse imagination, or had his voice suddenly gone husky?
“Goodnight boys.”
Potter made quick work of the curses and Draco had to admit that he
“And yet you never listen.” Potter sighed.
“And then she’ll be gone again!”
Draco gave an insolent shrug. “We all make mistakes.”
He was just finishing up with the last of the girls – Rose – when who should suddenly yank the door open and stride in, but Weasley, his wand drawn and a fierce scowl on his face. When he found Draco busily plaiting his daughter’s hair he stilled in apparent shock, his wand hand lowering.
“Malfoy?”
“Alcohol,” Blaise stated plainly. “The necessary evil. Last week we went out for a party and the both of us got seriously sloshed. I don’t remember much of the night but somehow we got back to the house and… things happened.”
” Potter said with a wry smile. “I thought I’d never get the hang of being a dad, but it turns out I’m a natural. Diaper-changing happened to be one of my specialties.” He laughed. “I don’t think Ginny changed a diaper more than five times during the whole of our marriage.”
“He didn’t say anything, it was fine.”
“Mother?”
don’t scream like a little girl.”
Bill grinned wickedly. “I was planning on Charlie for Seeker if I could get him, but let’s make this a little more interesting. I’ll take Harry.”
“Would you like some tea, Mr Potter?” Narcissa asked cordially, all smiles again.
to win; he
“So Malfoy’s cheek feels like a naked kneazle?” Weasley looked delighted. “I need to get this into a Pensieve later.”
“What about Parkinson and Zabini?” George asked. “Ron said you all were pretty close too.”
“Let’s just say that I did something rather foolish. The first thing we were taught about the beasts was that they were extremely proud creatures. One of my friends compared them to me actually.” he said with a rueful smile. The memory of Pansy telling him this was bittersweet now.
Draco froze, his eyes going wide. “What?” he whispered but she was already asleep.
A small break appeared in the crowd ahead and Draco thankfully sprang towards it, but just as he tried to make his escape, someone stepped in front of the gap. Unable to slow his momentum, Draco hissed out a curse as he forcefully slammed into them. The person gave a feminine squawk of outrage as she was bowled over, instinctively grabbing at his robes and subsequently pulling him along with her. He managed to manoeuvre himself so that he didn’t fall completely on her, but still wound up draped across her middle.
“Come on,” he said, patting the seat beside him. Draco settled down next to him with Lily snuggling up on his lap.
Ginny flopped down next to Draco and yawned. “I’m exhausted,” she announced to the room in general. They were all lounging in the Weasley living room, tired from their gruelling match and fit to bursting from the massive supper Molly had provided. She and Arthur were having a quiet cuppa in the kitchen. “Leaving the youngsters to their business,” they’d said.
Something inside him shifted then, and suddenly Draco
“Just having a bit of sport with him, is all,” George said with a careless shrug. “You don’t mind, right, Malfoy?” He put an arm around him and Draco fought the urge to push him off. He had to be polite.
“Salazar, Potter, give a bloke some warning next time.” Draco reached out to steady the other wizard. “Here, why don’t you just lie down? The floor’s clean and you can lean against one of the armchairs if you want.”
“I think you take after your mum more though.”
“Okay, okay. Let’s all just calm down first,” Pansy said in a rush, more to herself than anyone else. “Draco,
He doesn’t see Draco’s satisfied smirk.
“Your clothes are fine, Draco,” Granger assured him as she took a seat in one of his armchairs. Weasley moved to examine the pictures on his mantle, snickering at the one that showed a cake-covered six-year-old Draco grinning at the camera with an equally messy Blaise and Pansy beside him.
“You are an idiot.” he said, giving Harry a quick peck on the lips. “But then so am I.”
“Oh and Malfoy?” Potter said quietly as they walked to the nearest apparition point. “I saw you cry.”
“Ah.”
“Just resting my eyes a bit.”
Draco closed his eyes and focused on not hyperventilating.
Draco blinked and then felt his lips curve into a wide grin. “You know what your Dad and I always say.” He turned to look at Harry, listening agog to James’ tale, Al commenting from the side. “A lily in a hole is a sign of good things to come.”
to piss me off, because if you are, it’s working.
century and has been in the family for centuries. You can’t just discard such a valuable part of our heritage–”
Blaise was staring with an equally blank face, and he hadn’t uttered a single word since Draco had told them about what happened. His silence was as unsettling as Pansy’s composure and Draco was starting to feel alarmed. This alarm only further grew when Pansy abruptly cut the Floo connection, leaving Draco with his head in a cold grate.
Draco’s hands lifted from where they’d been gripping the edge of the counter to tentatively hold onto Potter’s waist, and Potter hummed happily into his mouth. His hands moved into Draco’s hair and tangled in the blonde locks as he changed the fit of their lips. A hot flick of his tongue, and Draco’s lips were parting for him to immediately dive in. He licked a heated path into Draco’s mouth and Draco choked on a moan when Potter painstakingly stroked the sensitive roof of his mouth with an extremely supple tongue.
But Draco wasn’t listening to Pansy any longer. He sprang out of bed and rushed to his closet. He needed a suitable outfit that said, ‘I’m sorry I abandoned you, but I’m also sexy as hell so it would be in your best interest to just forgive me and shag me instead’. He was trying to decide between a loose jumper that could easily be removed, and a tight shirt that left little to the imagination, when the door banged open again.
Bob returned then and didn’t seem the least bit perturbed to see Potter nearly incapacitated with laughter. “Here you are, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco sighed. “It’s fine, Potter. S’not like I have anything better to do.”
Draco and Harry gave the required round of applause and Lily patted him on the back. James scowled.
Draco gave a curt nod. “I’ll come for the children then.”
done in gold thread, and connected to his parents. He noticed that quite a few names had been scorched out and with a jolt, he gathered that these were people who had probably consorted with the ‘wrong sort’ by Pureblood standard. His aunt was one such scorched mark, as was the cousin he’d never met, Sirius Black. Teddy wasn’t even on the tapestry.
Draco gave a weak smile. “Nothing for you to worry about.” he said reassuringly but the children still looked sweetly concerned.
“Well, you silly bird, had a good hunt?”
“Isn’t it?” Potter’s grin widened. “It’s my all-time favourite. I’ll take you to the café one day. You have to try their brownies. Best in the world in my opinion.”
“Betrayed by my own children.” Potter told the ceiling with a sigh.
“I told you, Pomfrey healed me so I don’t have a scar or anything but if she hadn’t…” He shuddered before leaning forward. “I could have lost my whole arm.” he said in a stage whisper. The children recoiled, though Fred, James and Louis did say “Cool!”
When he entered the kitchen, he found the small kitchen table already set with their meal. Both he and his mother refused to ever eat in the dining room again unless extremely important guests came over and even Aunt Dromeda joined them in the kitchen when she happened to visit. She’d suggested that remodelling the room might help them to get over their aversion towards it, but as they still hadn’t gotten down to doing it, mealtimes took place in the comely Manor kitchens.
Draco could have just stood there and gone on baiting Potter but it was late and he was tired and all he really wanted to do was go home and sleep. Not to mention he really shouldn’t have been antagonizing Ginny’s boyfriend in the first place. So he pushed back the biting response that threatened to spill out and took a fortifying breath.
“Come along.” she continued briskly and shepherded everyone out as if they were all children – Harry included. When Draco made to follow though, she held up a hand with a small smile. “
Draco closed his eyes. His mother was one of the most dreadful matchmakers he’d ever known and she was relentless in her pursuits. He suddenly had a bad feeling about this visit.
Harry threw a pinch of powder into the grate. “Yes, I know,” he said indulgently. “Oh, and Draco?”
“That’s horrible.” George looked sick.
“It’s not like I’m welcome anywhere,” Draco huffed. “I feel much safer in the Manor.”
“We just kissed,” Potter finally said in a reluctant voice. “It wasn’t pleasant either. Too wet.”
“Bill!” Percy exclaimed, thus confirming Draco’s fears. “Come to say hello to young Malfoy over here?”
Harry kissed him again and Draco sighed happily. It seemed like everything was going to be alright after all. In fact – Draco gasped as Harry’s hands found their way under his shirt, smoothing over his back before dipping into his jeans and digging shamelessly into his arse cheeks – it seemed like things were about to get even better. However, just when their antics were about to cross over to best-conducted-in-the-bedroom-and-not-where-all-the-world-can-see, they were interrupted by the arrival of the Potter children.
Once he’d made certain that Potter was neither dead nor dying, Draco had fully intended to keep to his word and lock himself away in the Manor. However, he hadn’t counted on a guilt-tripping Granger storming into his room a couple of days after the accident, Weasley trailing warily behind.
Probably no more than a second after the saucepan touches the ground, Harry’s toppling onto his back with Draco seated happily on his midsection. Harry opens his mouth to tell him to get off him, but he’s soon having the living daylights kissed out of him and decides it might be better to just keep quiet.
Draco blinked as he stepped out into the sunlight. It was still light out and it took his eyes some time to adjust after being in the dark for so long.
Of all the things Draco had expected Potter to say,
Mercury hooted loudly and angrily, suddenly jumping into the fray with vengeance. He dove at Potter’s head with talons extended, making a great racket, and soon Potter was too busy trying to fend off the irate owl to hold Draco’s arms down any longer. Draco tried to scramble out from under him, but Potter’s thighs were still steadfastly clamped down on his own, and he couldn’t budge. Not to mention, with the way Potter’s arms were flaying about like mad, Draco feared a cuff to the head.
“What’s wrong with Malfoy?” Weasley joined them and placed a steady hand on Draco’s arm. “You look like you’re about to pass out.”
. The dim light is eerie but better than complete darkness, and now he can see his boyfriend’s pale face inches away from his own.
“And is that what this is?” Draco pressed, suddenly desperate to know where he stood with Potter. “Is this our second chance?”
She reached out and gave his sleeve a quick rub between her fingers. “And seriously, how expensive is this robe? It
!” Draco stared at Potter in disbelief. “No, that isn’t possible. You’re such an utter Gryffindor, it makes my teeth ache.”
Draco gave a small smile. “I don’t mind at all.”
“Oh I don’t know,” Harry smirked. “I thought it had some charm to it.”
“How about I tell you a story?” Draco tried again.
“Are they, Weasley? Are they ever
“It’s just like you.”

“….and then, there was this giant
“Well, not that many seventh and eighth year Slytherins came back, but almost everyone else from the other Houses returned. Ron and Harry didn’t though, and Hermione still grouches about that.”
Potter pulled back to place a lingering kiss on his cheek. “You’re beautiful.”
“So I’ve been told.” Draco shrugged again. “We got the robes in the end anyways and Al you’ll have one very happy mommy when you give these to her.”
. Granger and Weasley were long gone because they so conveniently had ‘somewhere to be’, and Draco had been standing outside the library door for a good fifteen minutes now, willing his legs to move. The rational part of him knew that Potter wouldn’t have asked after him if he didn’t want to see him – if he didn’t
“Oh so we’re back to Potter now?” Harry’s eyes narrowed.
“I’ll just be… going then.”
And just like that, Draco was suddenly angry; the bitter taste of yet another rejection souring his mood. He knew he shouldn’t take it personally, and really it had already been years and surely he had to be over it by now. Yet, Draco knew that deep down he’d never gotten over the fact that Harry Potter didn’t want to be his friend. His lips twisting into a sneer that would have done his fifteen-year-old self proud, he found himself snapping, “Too good to be slumming it out with the snakes you mean?”
Potter looked stunned by Draco’s sudden attack but then his eyes flared in a familiarly challenging way and he jutted his chin out belligerently. “I wouldn’t say I was ‘too good’, but yeah, Slytherin didn’t seem like an attractive prospect.” He shot Draco a cool look. “Not to mention,
Draco nodded, wondering if Fortesque’s still sold the sundae he was especially partial to. The ice cream parlour was bustling when they entered but the crowd seemed to part for Potter, and they found themselves at the counter in no time.
“Such vulgar behaviour. What
Potter huffed. “The owner shouldn’t take something like that out in public anyways. Especially to a children’s park.”
“I’ll hold you to that.”
Granger gave him a light smack as he passed but she was smiling. “Now who’s the cheeky one?”
“....and Theo would be reading a book and steadfastly ignoring both Daphne and Millie’s attempts at getting his attention,” Draco finished with a laugh. “That
Potter left but not before shooting Draco a concerned look first. Draco gulped, regarding Weasley with apprehension.
, ya know?”
Narcissa’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “And what, may I ask, would you have done if I had told you? We are no longer under house arrest, and yet you still insist on living like a recluse. If I hadn’t managed to coax you out today, you would still be holed up in your rooms.”
“So let me get this straight,” Draco needed to be certain, “All that rigmarole was you trying to ask me if I’d been harassed during my shopping spree?”
Draco recoiled when Potter suddenly reached out for him, and was immediately ashamed of himself when frightened green eyes stared back at him through a sheen of tears. Shaken out of his stupor by the desperation on Potter’s face, Draco quickly sprang to his feet and almost stepped on Kreacher when he suddenly appeared in front of him. The sound of the elf’s croaking wails echoed behind him as he raced out of the room.
“Papaaaaaa!” Lily sang as she pranced into the room, her brothers right behind her.
Almost as if timed, his mother chose that moment to sweep back in with his aunt and cousin. Draco shot her a suspicious look, wondering if she could have possibly been listening outside the door.
Charlie covered his ears. “There’s no need to shout. I wasn’t hitting on him.”
they’d slipped into routine, almost as if they’d known each other for years. Of course, they
“Oh, I still am,” Draco replied honestly. “It might not work out.”
“Why ever would you think that, sister dear?” George hurriedly retracted his arm from around Draco and patted him companionably.
“He makes MGonagall look like a schoolgirl.” Draco replied wryly. “Anyways, I somehow ended up staying away longer than expected and suddenly decided my wanderlusting had to come to an end. So I took the first international
Draco was busy arranging plates of buns and sandwiches on the long table they’d set out on the lawn. The others were either setting up the tables and lawn chairs or helping to carry plate after plate of food out of the house. Molly seemed to have made enough food to rival the Hogwarts welcoming feast. He was just finishing up when he felt a hand on his arm and he swung around at once, assuming that Harry had finally caught him.
“A reporter,” she explained when Draco shot her a questioning look. “I’ve grown quite adept at destroying cameras now. That was the fifth one this week, I think.”
Weasley let out an anguished groan and banged his head back against an armchair. Draco shared an amused look with Potter, knowing what was coming next.
“Didn’t she tell? Andromeda introduced her to Molly. If I’m remembering properly, it happened last week.”
“And you just naturally assume the boy is into blokes in the first place,” Bill remarked dryly.
furniture. But there are a few rooms that I haven’t been able to deal with yet – namely the library and attic. It turns out they’ve been infused with old magic, some of it Dark, and since I’m not a true Black heir, I haven’t been able to deal with them. The house doesn’t recognise me as its rightful owner yet.”
Granger opened her mouth to say something but Ginevra suddenly bustled in and Draco’s heart sank, knowing that Harry wouldn’t be too far behind. He really should stop calling him ‘Harry’ even if it was in his mind, but after that…
“No you didn’t.”
“Oh.” Draco had never met his cousin, but he remembered Aunt Dromeda mentioning that he’d been very close to Potter when he’d been alive. “I suppose he and Mother must have gotten their eyes from their fathers then. Grandfather and my great-uncle were known for looking startlingly alike.”
on occasion. He’s married now, has three children and another one on the way.”
Opening his eyes again, he saw her kneeling over Potter, whispering something to him, though she dared not touch him. Aunt Dromeda was still casting and a light sheen of perspiration was visible on her forehead now, wand hand firmly aloft in spite of her fatigue. Draco looked down at his own shaking hands and wanted to laugh. Here his aunt was, doing some powerful spellcasting to keep Potter alive, and he was the one shivering like a frightened crup.
The door opened just as the last of the biscuits had been eaten and Weasley came in with Granger. When he caught sight of the empty plates, he looked dismayed.
“I left because I needed a chance to be
“May I ask why?”
Potter’s jaw clenched and he jabbed a finger at Draco. “I did not make her cry, nor did I forcibly kiss her. If anything, she kissed
“What do I gain from all this?” Draco demanded, crossing his arms.
Potter shrugged and started to leave the room. “Come on, we might as well get started.”
“Not to forget, even if it doesn’t work out, at least you’ll get some good shags out of it first,” Blaise added dreamily. “Potter’s hot as fuck.”
ing terms now I see.” she said with a smirk.
The woman smiled at Al and waved before turning back to Draco. You must be a friend of young Harry’s. It’s so nice to meet you, I’m Alice Spencer.”
The child regarded him with a thoughtful expression. “You look like her.” he said cryptically. “I’m Teddy Lupin.”
Ginny and Granger looked delighted, Weasley closed his eyes with a frustrated groan and Potter let out a loud, “Oh, for fuck’s sake!”
“It’s wonderful that you’re finally home Draco.”
Al sniffed and sat up on Potter’s chest. “You weren’t?” he asked Draco.
“Yes Draco?”
” Draco repeated incredulously. “Since when have we
“I really shouldn’t forgive you just yet… but I suppose I will. After all, I’m hoping some bufflepops will visit me tonight and holding onto negative thoughts are sure to drive them away.”
Granger looked affronted. “What could I have possibly done?”
Said son ambled over, with evident reluctance, a stiff smile plastered across his face. His hair was neatly combed back and his clothes in impeccable condition, regardless of their simplicity. Draco almost found himself nodding in approval and he hastily pulled himself together. It wouldn’t do to find common ground with the pompous ex-prefect. Although, Draco noted with surprise, there was a sort of lightness in his countenance that you wouldn’t expect coming from someone who was supposed to have a permanent stick up his arse.
“Yup!” the child replied excitedly. “You knew my dad didn’t you? He taught you at Hogwarts?”
Draco found himself clasping her hand with a bemused smile. “Pleased to make your acquaintance, Ginny. Draco Malfoy at your service.”
She stared at him open-mouthed and Mrs Weasley may have pinched herself. Draco lifted his chin haughtily in response and tried to give the impression of a man who still saw them as much beneath him in every way. Not that he actually thought that – well, not anymore, at least – but appearances had to be kept and all. The flame-haired girl seemed like she wanted to say something but before she could, a loud taunt cut cleanly through the air.
“Oh Merlin, no. It caught me right on the arm. If Hagrid hadn’t stepped in after it slashed me, I might not be here today. Our matron Madam Pomfrey was able to heal it in the end but I still had to wear a sling.”
“Edward Lupin!” she barked and the boy looked sheepish, hiding behind Potter. “We’ve told you before, you cannot just change your appearance when in the Muggle world. You’re lucky no one else was around or you’d have been in big trouble.”
“So to what do I owe this impromptu visit?” Draco asked, settling down in the armchair beside Granger.
“Draco, is something actually wrong?” Pansy reached out to place a hand on his cheek through the flames.
“I usually am.” Aunt Dromeda replied airily and his mother laughed.
Harry sent Draco a bland look. “She really is your girl.”
Draco saw that Potter was now passed out on the couch and he slowly let out a breath. “I’m fine.”

Draco wiped at his mouth with a napkin. “Well, I don’t usually overindulge but yes, I eat a fair amount. Why?”
“Mr Potter, I

his mother. It wasn’t right or fair and it reminded Draco that for them, compassion was rare and not to be expected.
“It probably is,” Draco replied with an unabashed smirk. “But I’ve been taught that it’s always good to know the financial status of people of interest. It comes in handy going both ways; when one is
“June fifth,” Draco supplied helpfully. “I shall be expecting a present, of course.”
He turned back to his mother who looked as if she was about to stomp her foot like a petulant child. “Mother, I assure you I was aware of that fact.” His aunt made a sound that sounded suspiciously like a snort and his mother shot her a glare.
Draco moved his queen two spaces and then looked up. “It’s rather a long story.”
“You could have asked me,” Ginny persisted. “At least after you felt more comfortable with me. Friends talk about stuff like that.”
Draco tilted his head. “Well, I’m not sure James. You haven’t deemed to tell me
As Draco proceeded slowly, Potter leaned back on his hands and watched him. “Whose turn is it again?” he asked in deference to the conversation game they still played.
you?” Draco yelled, his hold on his temper snapping like a twig underfoot. “What is with you and not being able to just stay the fuck away? Why are you constantly barging into
At one point he saw Victoire trying to unsuccessfully plait her hair and offered to do it for her. In school he’d often had to help style Pansy’s hair when she grew bored of her bob every once in a while. He’d always had an eye for detail and such things that involved style or beauty often came easily to him – a fact that Lucius had absolutely hated. Yet another ‘pansy trait’ of his.
“Alright, alright,” Draco relented, raising his hands in a placatory gesture. “I gave him a permanent hard-on.”
Potter grimaced. “Don’t think I can actually. My stomach aches like you wouldn’t believe, and my cheeks feel like they’re permanently out of place.”
Draco smiled faintly back. “Always stating the obvious, Potter.”
There was a beat of silence before he spoke up again.
Potter stepped closer until they were nose to nose, his expression dangerous. “You were almost melting in my arms, Malfoy. I bet I
Still, it was a tad disconcerting to hear her so openly jabbing at Lucius and while it gratified him to see that the fire she’d had during his childhood was returning to her, it also saddened him to think that it had ever been put out in the first place.
Draco expected Potter to take out his wand for the job but much to his surprise, he appeared to be putting it in his mouth.
Draco let out a hissed curse as he pulled his broom up short. Ginny triumphantly held up her hand, the fluttering Snitch still struggling to get loose.
“I’ll be going then,” Draco said finally. “Goodnight Potter.” He turned to go down the steps but suddenly found himself being hauled back and shoved up against the wall.
Draco nodded mutely, suddenly feeling like an idiot. “Well, you dated in sixth year, didn’t you? And after the War too.”
“I…” Potter’s voice was still thick with desire and he paused for a moment to clear his throat. “I’d better see what that was.” he said in a more normal voice. “Maybe you could…” he nodded hopefully towards the still open door and Draco was tempted to accept his blatant invitation.
“Um, I’m not so sure…” Potter glanced at him uncomfortably. “I’m not so sure that’s a good idea Jamie.”
“We wouldn’t even be in this situation if it wasn’t for you and your bloody tricks,” Harry snaps back. “And seriously, what in the world possessed you to create
“It was only a suggestion,” Draco said slowly, eyeing them warily and wondering what had gotten their wands in a knot all of a sudden.
Of course his hopes were quickly crushed when Potter continued. “We should ask Andromeda and your mum to join us. I’d love to see Narcissa Malfoy in Muggle London.”
“I’ve left a hangover potion for you downstairs.” his mother continued and then swept out with a flourish.
to shame.
“Does he honestly think I was going to just come back and continue with the library?” Merlin help him, Potter was hopeless.
. In that split second of thought, everything seemed to fall into place and Draco felt his mouth curl into a smile.
of money, or planning on gaining favour
“Other than the apparent,” Weasley snorted and then yelped when Granger smacked him hard with a hissed, “Not now
!” A voice called from behind him and pretty soon his wife had also joined them, her curls tamed into a rather pretty bun that made her almost unrecognizable for a moment. She too seemed stunned when she took in the scene before her.
He didn’t say anything more and Draco tried to ignore the fact that the man he was harbouring a major crush on was lying with his face inches from his crotch. If that wasn’t the very definition of a frustrating situation, Draco didn’t know what was.
“Kindly allow me to pass,” she said in a stern voice, although Draco detected a small waver in it.
Draco smiled up at the two of them and then withdrew his head. He quickly changed into more respectable clothes and headed downstairs. They no longer dressed formally for dinner but he knew his mother wouldn’t approve of him coming downstairs dressed sloppily. She was constantly telling him that just because he
“It was the same with Mum. I never noticed just how worried she was until after the War was over. For one thing, she doesn’t glance at the clock every five minutes anymore.”
“I’m not asking if you find him handsome,” she continued. “That’s a bit of a given. What I want to know is if you see a potential partner in him.”
too young to die.”
“We’ve met Hagrid!” James interrupted excitedly. “He’s giant!”
for?” he yelped, hastily moving his chair further away from her. “
Potter looked torn and suddenly leant in to give him another kiss. Unlike the previous one, this was gentle and sweet. It didn’t last long, but it had Draco trembling when they pulled away.
“I’m aware,” Draco replied dryly, wishing he wasn’t. His gaze softened. “I’m happy for you.”
By now they’d reached the door but Weasley didn’t stop there and led them all up to the library. Draco hated that he was being manhandled like a ragdoll, but as Weasley looked like he would happily body-bind Draco if he struggled too much, there was nothing he could do about it. Ginny and Potter followed close behind, the former looking even more concerned now, while the latter looked… resigned?
“That Italian place I told you about, near Hyde Park.”
happen! Did he make a move? Wait, are you
“More painting!”
They smiled back and shared a look that spoke of things that Draco could only wish for. He swallowed, throat suddenly tight and eyes smarting. He truly was happy for them but he couldn’t help feeling a little disheartened. They’d been of equal standing before, the three of them against all odds, but now Draco was the one on the outside. He was on his own and the person who made him less lonely couldn’t be his.
anyone who shares my birthday, thereby allowing me to consider that day to be mine alone.”
“Bad communication,” Ginny repeated. “You two really need to sort out a couple of things, so I’ll leave you to it.” She made it halfway to the door before she turned around again. “Oh, and just to be clear, I’m dating Neville, not Harry.” And then she was gone.
Potter looked sheepish. “I know it wasn’t very fair, but I was too eager to join in catching the remaining Death Eaters to care.”
Draco took in her earnest expression and sighed. “I suppose that was… kind of you,” he bit out grudgingly. “Deals a rather solid blow to my pride, but in my defence, I haven’t been on a broom since…”
“Are you really sure these burst?” Draco frowned as he rubbed the balloon harder. “They feel quite thick.”
Draco clicked his tongue in irritation. “What is it, Kreacher?”
“I’m aware of my idiocy.”
Harry wishes he has enough breath to shout something back at Draco, but as it is, all he can do is send a sort of panted growl his way. Draco is strolling in front of him, completely at ease while Harry’s painfully lugging a cart filled to the brim with pumpkins. His arm feels like it’s about to be ripped out of its socket and he’s sure that any minute now, the cart will pull him back and he’ll die rolling down a hill, surrounded by pumpkins. What a way to go indeed.
“Ah, if it isn’t young Malfoy.”
“Okay.” Draco cleared his throat. “I’m just going to go out on a limb and ask: are Ginny and Potter dating?”
“I forgot to take off the bloody Repelling Charm,” Potter groaned, running his hands through his unruly hair and mussing it up even more. “I need to go back. See you, Malfoy.” Before he could respond, Potter was already hurrying back to Eeylop’s.
“I actually came to call you out for a drink with the boys. But I can see that you’re busy.” He looked almost gleeful, eyes wide and filled with mirth, and Draco felt that he was missing something here. Did Potter feel obligated to keep him company and was Weasley making a joke of it?
Draco was fully expecting some sort of stupid jibe in return, but Potter suddenly stopped in the middle of the street and swore loudly. An elderly witch nearby looked scandalised and covered the ears of the child she was with, shooting Potter a stern look when he swore colourfully again.
“Of course I will,” Potter promised quietly. “And I
Thin Lips tutted disapprovingly. “My, my, such vulgar language. Didn’t your mother teach you any better?”
“And of course, you jumping me and begging me to take you right there on the carpet was a welcome outcome as well.”
Instead, he gave Potter an apologetic look and said, “I think it might be better if I went home. Please, don’t try to contact me.”
“Listen, I’m not so sure if…” he trailed off as the boys’ faces fell. “I mean, I’m not busy but – Potter?” The prat only shrugged indifferently.
Draco eyed the hand for a moment and then lifted his gaze to Potter’s face with a raised brow. Potter withdrew almost immediately, snatching his hand back with mortification colouring his face. Draco slowly smoothed out the wrinkles Potter had left and wondered what the fuck he was playing at.
“Pansy, I don’t think you understand,” Draco said desperately. “We’ll be playing a game of Quidditch. Quidditch involves Bludgers. It won’t seem the slightest suspicious if one was to ‘randomly’ smash my head in
“Come, Draco.” His mother grasped his arm and gently pulled him out of the room. He expected her to lead him to the Floo to go after the others but instead, she took him to the kitchen where she made him drink a cool glass of water with a few drops of sherry in it.
Pansy looked even more delighted. “I’m beginning to seriously like you Gryffindors. We girls must get together for dinner one day.”
His mother shared a strange smile with his aunt and then gestured towards the closed door of the sitting room. “I was taking Andi down to the kitchens to get some milk for Teddy, but why don’t you head into the sitting room and wait for us? We will join you in a bit.”
sorry.”
Potter sounded angry now and Draco rolled his eyes again. Now who was being overprotective?
Once again, the room settled into silence. Draco wanted to crawl into a hole and never come out, so mortified was he by the turn of events. This was probably the most humiliated he’d ever felt in his life, and that included being caught crying in a girl’s bathroom. He supposed by now he should’ve known that if it had to do with Draco looking like an idiot or worse, Potter would be there to see it.
Everyone eyed everyone else. Well, except for Potter. He had his eyes locked on the back of Ginny’s head and Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if a hatchet materialised out of thin air to lodge itself there.
“He’s a nice kid.” Draco replied. “Surprisingly sharp.”
The owl seemed to delight in offering his opinion about everything and everyone, going so far as to engage the house elves in one-sided conversations; hooting away while the house elf in question stared at him as if he was a wonder of the world. He also appeared to be somewhat of a snob, as was clearly seen when Draco tried to call him such things like ‘Pipsqueak’ or ‘Teeny’. For some reason, he hadn’t seen the logic in those names and had only given Draco disdainful hoots and contemptuous looks in response, along with the deliberate ruin of his seventh favourite pair of boots.
“The Italian place by the bakery.” Ginevra said with a nod and a returning grin.
the one who kept whining about the clothes. I was just trying to be comforting.”
Narcissa smiled apologetically. “Molly made the same suggestion but I’ve a dinner arrangement with my sister today. Perhaps another time.”
Harry does just that, seating himself comfortably down on the porch and leaning back on his hands. It’s dusk now and the sun has begun to set, casting everything in a soft, muted light. Harry watches a couple of children pass by on bikes and smiles as he wonders if he can persuade Draco to get on one. The front door opens and closes quietly, and Harry’s about to voice his thoughts, when hands land on his shoulders and begin to knead them in firm, strong strokes.
“I’m sorry, Mercury, but not tonight.”
Potter ran a hand through his mussed hair. “I’m sure no one’s hurt or else I’d be hearing crying now. I can check up on them alright, but afterwards…”
A loud hoot sounded through the room and Draco turned just in time to see a small blur of fluff diving straight for his head. He ducked on instinct alone and managed to avoid it just in time, although his mother wasn’t as lucky. The owl slammed quite solidly into her chest and she gave a startled gasp as it literally bounced off her and landed on the pile of letters.
“Up Dwaco.” Lily said, toddling over to Draco and he swung her up onto his shoulders the way he’d seen Potter do before.
He left the room and Draco rubbed his hands over his face with a sigh. He needed to get a grip, for heaven’s sake! As his mother liked to say, there was nothing to be gained by unravelling like a badly knitted shawl at the slightest pull.
“Malfoy?”
“And I reminded him of you?”
“You know, people usually knock before entering a room.” Draco replied, taking out a pair of pants before closing the wardrobe door.
Potter let out a beleaguered breath. “What do you want, Ron?”
She didn’t say anything more at the moment but also didn’t let go of his arm. It was Luna’s way of telling him that she wouldn’t pry whilst also letting him know that she was here for him always. It was one of the things he loved the most about her. How she always knew exactly what to do. She never asked too many questions or said too much but just gave you what you needed at the moment.
Potter nodded at a book lying next to him. “Are you finished with that?”
Draco reached out to pat the child gently on the head. “No Al, I like you too much to turn you into a human bonfire.” He smiled. “You’ll find that the best way to find someone who is hiding is to scare them enough that they come to
“James, Albus!” Another familiar voice cut through the air and Draco caught a glimpse of a dark head making its way through the crowd, a tiny red head firmly on his shoulders. Great, more Potters.
gasp.
“You’re on it too.” Potter sidled up next to him and nudged him lightly with his elbow. “There.”
“There there,” he crooned in his best cheer-up-and-kindly-get-the-fuck-off-me voice. He tried to remember how his mother had comforted him when he was little. “It’s going to be alright. You’re a big boy after all, and big boys don’t cry.” Merlin, he was glad no one was around to see this little exchange.
As predicted, just as he was beginning to fall asleep again, she appeared by his bed with a
“I’m beginning to wonder if you know what ‘safe’ even means.” Draco shot back, wincing as the taxi narrowly missed a collision with a bus. “I am never taking a taxi again in my life, and I advise you to at least keep the children at home if you ever feel the need to take one again. Merlin, I think even the Knight bus is safer than this!”
?” He casually placed his arms around Potter’s shoulders and any remaining distance between them disappeared as he pressed their chests flush against each other.
“Well, I…”
“I’m not really one for accepting big expensive gifts usually,” Ginny replied with a wry look, snipping away at her broom. “But Harry was adamant I accept this, so I did. It’s to ‘make up’ for not getting me a birthday present last year.” She rolled her eyes. “Because
Draco’s breath hitched as he took in the man before him. Not too long ago he’d had that mess of hair tangled in his fingers and those stunning eyes looking at him with such
Draco smirked. “I know.”
“What do you mean ‘by now’, Mother?” he asked sharply. His eyes widened when she deliberately schooled her face into an indifferent mask. Having done so himself on many occasions, he knew
know that, Potter, but try telling that to my father. I already disappointed him enough as it were.”
“Oh… well, thank you.” Draco was oddly touched.
“Oh.” Draco knew that he probably sounded like a dunce but he didn’t know what else to say. He couldn’t help staring at the man in front of him, feeling faint as he took in the deep scars. He knew exactly how Bill had got them and a lump formed in his throat as he recalled the horrible feeling he’d had when he saw Greyback come through the Vanishing cabinet.
“The brooms,” Draco interrupted heatedly, “Were my father’s way of showing his appreciation that I’d joined the team. I suspect it was Mother’s idea though, seeing as how he’d constantly bemoan the fact that I played the ‘pansy position of seeker’ instead of being a beater like he’d been hoping.”
“Yes, but my surname
“Well, they may be divorced but I’ve still seen them here together, and they seem as jovial with each other as they’ve always been.”
. One moment he had the upper hand, and in the next, he was flat on his back with Potter’s hands firmly pressing his wrists down on either side of his head.
“Bite your tongue Potter, I’m older than you and I assure you I’m as fresh as the day.” Draco shot back haughtily.
“Couldn’t Potter just buy you another one?” Draco helped himself to a tin of polisher, spreading it along his handle with a soft brush. “You should ask for a newer model.”
“Of course Luna, don’t mind little old me.” Draco placed a hand dramatically over his heart. “It isn’t as if I’ve been gone for ages and yet you’re still ditching me to go on – Merlin help me – a
Draco circled above the game, keeping a keen eye out for a flash of gold. He swiftly ducked as a Bludger headed his way and smirked when it almost took Weasley’s head off. In place of Beaters, Granger had charmed the Bludgers to pelt about within the limits of the playing field, randomly changing direction every now and then. Potter was on the other side of the pitch but instead of searching for the Snitch, his gaze was firmly fixed on Draco.
. He rolled over onto his back and spit out a large clump of grass and soil, fervently praying that none of his teeth had been knocked out by the fall.
, it seems such a waste of energy to remember old animosities.”
Pushing his wet bangs out of his eyes, Draco turned to see that the perpetrator was little more than a schoolboy, probably in his fourth or fifth year at Hogwarts. The crowd around them was watching with interest and this only seemed to spur the whelp on even more.
think you’d go along with it.”
The couple left the room and Draco saw himself out the back door. He’d already bid his farewells to Molly and Arthur and they’d lock up after he left. He stepped out into the night and took in a deep breath of fresh air. With so many people, the room had grown stuffy and it was a relief to stand outside and feel the cool night breeze. Draco stepped off the porch, planning on walking down the path before Apparating away since the Floo had already been locked for the night. However, he stopped short when he got the strange feeling that he wasn’t alone. He reached for his wand but a familiar voice spoke up in the darkness.
“Oh Draco, what if she doesn’t want to see me? I was so horrid to her after all.” She wrung her hands pathetically.
“I eat enough,” Draco huffed defensively. “It’s not my fault I never get fat. I quite like my build as it is.”
“Malfoy?” asked Potter in a tone of the utmost disbelief. “What are
Draco’s chest clenched painfully. Potter had no business missing him.
Draco blushed as he saw that most of the room had heard the comment and were regarding him with varying looks of amusement. Though Harry looked like a veritable thunder cloud.
“He did, and I can honestly tell you that he was a really good teacher. Probably the best DADA professor I had at Hogwarts, including Snape.”
Draco inclined his head as politely as he could. “Ginevra. How lovely to see you.”
“And yet you love me.”
Many would have found their friendship to be shocking and surreal at best. After all, Luna had once been held prisoner in his family dungeons and that was a good enough reason for her to hate him for eternity. So when he’d come across her by the Lake, somewhere in the October of his eighth year, Draco had blurted out an apology and then closed his eyes, waiting for the harsh words that were sure to follow. Instead, he’d felt a gentle pressure on his arm and opened his eyes to find Luna smiling beside him, her small hand holding his arm. That simple exchange, before she walked away had left him warm for the first time since the War had ended. After that, it had been only a matter of time before he held a special place his heart for the whimsical girl, whose ideas were more to the side of mad, and whose nature was sweeter than anyone he’d ever known.
“Draco, I am not some helpless flower that you must protect,” she replied coldly. “I am a grown witch of sound mind and body, with a capable wand and a steady hand. I did not ask you out today for my own protection, but for the simple fact that I worry about my only child wasting his days away with no company other than myself and the house elves.”
Potter lay on his back and started to laugh.
Potter scratched his ear. “Is tomorrow alright for you? I have training all weekdays but I finish at four. Drop by at around five?”
“I’ll
“I haven’t seen you around before. I come here with my grandson Nigel every Thursday and I’m sure I would have remembered you. Your hair is rather distinctive if you don’t mind me saying.”
“I didn’t do anything,” he said somewhat belligerently, looking anywhere but at Draco. “He
“Yes, all the time. Now unhand me or there’ll be none of this after the ceremony.”
Draco bit back a scream. Just what he needed – a lecture from Granger’s three year old daughter. As if the adult wasn’t bad enough, he had to now contend with a miniature version too.
“Ginny!” Draco returned with what little enthusiasm he could muster – which wasn’t a lot.
“Draco did you like the film?” the little boy asked him.
“I– I can’t do this right now,” he said, edging towards the door.
There was a beat of silence and when his mother still hadn’t said anything, he finally looked up. He was momentarily rendered dumb when he found her eyes wet with unshed tears.
Potter returned with a couple of bottles and three large glasses. “Luckily I had a few chilling in the cooler for a special occasion.”
Weasley made a gagging sound. “Already gone,” he muttered, making a beeline for the door.
“Do you like chocolate Draco?” Al asked.
“I can be romantic,” Harry protested, looking insulted. “And anyways, the hot sex that followed only added to an already magical moment.”
“It’s no problem,” Mrs Weasley replied just as softly, smiling at them both for the first time ever. “And please, do call me Molly.”
“Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry says, knowing all the while that words can only do so much. “It was supposed to be a harmless trick; just to get back at you for all the ones you pulled on me. I didn’t mean to scare you so badly.”
have looked like that of a petulant child but instead turned out as if Potter was exuding masculine authority from his biceps alone. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, not liking the direction his thoughts were headed.
“I didn’t know how to bring it up,” Potter whined, embarrassment colouring his features. “It’s not like I have any experience dating blokes.”
Harry springs up as if hit by a Stinging Hex and he scrambles on the fake blood as he sinks to his knees in front of his boyfriend, feeling a sharp ache in his chest when all Draco does is give another muffled sob and shrink further back against the wall. He’s staring at Harry as if he can’t believe his eyes and Harry is scared to even touch him at the moment. Draco finally removes his hands from his mouth and reaches out tentatively, still trembling but not as much as before.
“You’re Sirius’ heir and the new Head of the House, it’s only proper that you be a part of the tree.” Draco’s words were stuttering now. “Your– your descendants will appear on it too then. Any children you might have.” He held Potter’s unwavering gaze, heart breaking at the thought of Potter starting a life that he could never feature in.
Draco stood outside the entrance of the Leaky Caldron, nervously plucking at the hem of his shirt. He’d arrived almost half an hour early but instead of sitting inside and ordering something to eat or drink, he’d stood outside like an idiot. He didn’t know where the nerves were coming from but he blamed it on the fact that he hardly knew what they were going to do. His mother had noticed that something was up but hadn’t said anything even when he’d come to tell her he was going out with ‘a friend’ and wasn’t sure when he’d be back. She hadn’t even asked about his attire, simply telling him to have a nice time and to let her know if he wasn’t coming home for the night. She most probably thought he’d gone clubbing. Speaking of which, perhaps after this he could find a nice Muggle club for some dancing and shagging.
“Yeah, good for you, Malfoy,” Weasley added somewhat dazedly.
Apparently Luna had offered to babysit the children as their parents were still busy and were due to arrive only in time for the party. The party, which was not supposed to start for another hour and a half in fact, something that Luna had kindly failed to mention. Draco now knew that it had all been a trap and he was torn between admiration for the decidedly Slytherin tactics Luna had employed, and outrage for being tricked in the first place. He had a feeling his mother had played a role in the ploy as well
“Yes sweetheart, but tell him your whole name.” Potter encouraged.
This time around there was thankfully no buggering in sight, and he called for someone to answer his call. Eventually a house elf appeared and soon he’d directed the creature to go get his friends. Draco summoned a cushion to lie on and got himself comfortable as he waited, crossing his arms and resting his head on them.
“Oh, Draco.” Ginny gave him a sympathetic pat on the cheek. “I suppose this is all down to bad communication. I was sure Harry had said something to you.” She looked accusingly at Potter.
arse cheeks and he quickly got to his knees, hands instinctively grabbing at his backside in a most undignified way. Apparently she wasn’t a mirage after all.
“Was there something you needed?” he asked blankly.
“Er…”
“Oh yes, we went to school together.” Draco replied lightly, having noticed that Potter seemed unsure of how to respond to James’ query.
His mother sighed. “Your exaggerations grow tiring, Draco.”
As Potter began to play with the toy, jubilantly exclaiming over it, Draco listened with half an ear, his heart racing.
“I think he’s angry.” Fred told James confidingly.
“Draco?” an unapologetic voice called from the fireplace and he tilted his head backwards, giving Pansy’s upside-down head his best glare.
“The thirty-first of July is still a few months away; you have time.” Draco waved his hand dismissively.
“Harry, maybe you could take the cake down to Kreacher?” He placed the cake box in Potter’s hands without waiting for a reply and pushed him in the direction of the door. “He can keep it under a good Preservation Charm until it’s time for Teddy to cut it.”
“So it was my very first Care of Magical Beasts class.” he began. “All us third years had been asked to meet Hagrid near the edge of the Forbidden Forest.”
“Black, two spoons of sugar.”
Potter smirked and nodded at the shop. “Well, he’s definitely
hadn’t been so hell-bent on leaving our wands at home, we could have Apparated back by now.”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
“Let’s just go back. I want to see if anyone survives the film.” Harry walks back to the living room with Draco close behind.
Tentatively, he looked over at Potter again, but there was no overwhelming desire to lock lips with him anymore. Draco let out a relieved sigh; celibacy for practically two years had left him frustrated, that had to be it. And so what if he found Potter attractive? That was hardly news.
Fortunately for Potter and his ears, he chose that moment to make his overdue arrival.
Draco would have stepped in then, but Narcissa suddenly looked his way and sent him a sharp look. She obviously wanted to handle this without any assistance, and all he could do was give a stiff nod and remain where he was, nothing more than another unhelpful spectator in the crowd.
Blaise wrapped his arm around Pansy and pulled her against him, whispering something into her ear that had the effect of Pansy slumping back against him and releasing a shuddering breath.
“Teddy you do not tell people they suck.” he admonished and then turning to Draco he sent him glare. “And you, not another word.”
” he gave her a pointed look, “Potter needs a bit of help and apparently I am the wizard for it.”
Draco glared. “I’ll have you know, I made the team fair and square. Higgs was due to retire anyways and apart from a couple of third years who could hardly fly a broom straight, I was the only decent flyer who applied for seeker.”
“Yes James?” Potter asked.
ago but he hadn’t dared approach Gallivander about it, and now here he was making an utter fool of himself. He began to shake the wand vigorously, barely resisting the urge to snap the bloody thing in two.
“Really Fred, what gave you that impression?” Draco asked sarcastically.
“You came!” he said with all the excitement of a child on Christmas morning and Draco was momentarily stunned.
“Ginny.”
“Well…” Draco considered the suggestion for a moment. It did sound inviting and he found himself eager to meet his aunt. “Alright.” he finally said and Teddy gave a whoop and sprang to hug him.
“’Night Dada.”
“No it wasn’t.” Pansy glared but it quickly subsided and she sighed. “But I suppose you were somewhat justified in thinking that way.”
Potter gave a brief nod and no more was said about the matter.
“What’s wrong?” Al asked, his voice laced with concern.
“Oh. That’s nice.”
Potter returned quickly and it was obvious that he held something behind his back. He shuffled his feet nervously.
Draco allowed himself a small smile. “Reception might have turned out a tad frosty.”
“You might not believe me, but as a Slytherin, I protect my own. I consider Ginny a close friend now and therefore she falls into the category of people I look out for.”
“Much,” he replied with a grin. He came over to where Draco stood and pulled him in for a quick, hard kiss on the mouth. “Go out with me tonight?”
“Any reason as to why you’ve taken to shocking the elderly?” Draco asked genially.
hear me out!” he burst out before he could try to get a word in.
Luna’s eyes spoke volumes as she took his arm and led him down the stairs. “When Cissa told me it was serious this time, I admit I didn’t believe her. But then I
“It belonged to you in the first place and it’d already served its purpose.” Potter replied with a shrug, taking a seat in one of the armchairs and beginning to set up the board on a small table he pulled in front of him.
him…”
“You know, it’s good manners to call before Floo-ing over,” he said starkly and Weasley’s grin widened.
Instead of lying still and allowing himself to be bashed into the ground like a ragdoll, Potter immediately sprang into motion, and Draco had to hastily seat himself on his midsection in the hopes of holding him down. Unfortunately for Draco, it turned out that Potter was
when he’d brought it on himself, but it still did. He hadn’t heard from Ginny either, and the dissolution of their friendship was clear evidence that the Fates had a sick sense of irony.
“I still think it might do you good to have to look after someone other than yourself for a change,” she continued, and her tone brooked no argument. “Now, why don’t you take your new
“I think he tried to kiss me.”
! Did I mention he’s sitting on the ground?”
with you? That was so messed up. I have no idea how you even did that.”
Fleur looked delighted now. “Eet is so nice to see an Englishman speaking French as eet should be spoken. Me, I have been trying to teach Bill for years now and yet zat man still cannot say ze simplest of things. His accent, eet is horrible!”
Potter looked grave but then nodded. “I think that’ll be perfect.”
James whooped again and did a small dance that made Lily squeal with laughter. “Dwaco come?” she smiled up at him and he nuzzled his nose into her cheek.
“Careful there Potter.” Draco said, reaching out to steady the other wizard. “Wouldn’t want to hurt yourself.”
Teddy
Ginny nodded. “Though I’ll admit, I did have my suspicions of you. Gay, huh? Interesting.”
closer to Potter than Ginny. Perhaps close in a way that wasn’t appropriate when she was away at Hogwarts and had no way of knowing what Potter was up to.
He’d been with Harry for a long time now and while things hadn’t always been perfect, these years together had been some of the happiest of Draco’s existence. There were still times when he’d randomly wonder how his life might have been, had he not plucked up the courage to pursue what he wanted. In the still hours of the morning when he was coming home after a long shift at St Mungo’s; during quiet evenings by the fireplace, snuggled up to Harry as he recounted the heroisms of his day… Draco would wonder for the sake of wondering, although it never lasted long. He knew that in the grand scheme of things, what was most important was that he was here with Harry
“That’s fine.”
“You’re alright Malfoy.” He suddenly glanced at somewhere behind him and gave a conspiratorial wink. “Don’t look now, but you might want to run. Harry’s on his way over.” And with that he was gone.
sorry I said those things to you. My mouth tends to work faster than my brain most of the time, and when you sneered, it was like we were back at school. I reacted on instinct.”
“And after all, you did owl me quite frequently, and floo-call too.”
Draco understood that all too well. “I know.”
“That was one time Potter, and I was drunk!”
Weasley chose this moment to enter and when he took in the sight of Draco glaring and hissing from his sheet cocoon, his face went bright red.
Potter unexpectedly gave him a smirk in return. “You’ve intrigued me now. Let’s hear it.”
could his mother want him for? He’d seen her not more than half an hour ago and she hadn’t batted an eye when he’d announced that he was going to bed. Feeling peeved, Draco didn’t bother changing out of his sloppy ‘clothes-for-my-eyes-alone’ and didn’t even put a dressing gown over them, dragging himself downstairs and taking care to walk as slowly as he could without falling asleep.
“Come on, stop worrying,” Potter pressed on. “You’re just as bad as Hermione.”
“Or perhaps… she didn’t have to whore herself out after all,” he said slowly, leaning in
The balloon finally came to a stop when it hit the Black family tapestry and fell to the ground. Silence descended on them, Potter surprisingly quiet with not so much as a teasing remark made as he stood up and retrieved the wayward balloon. Handing it back to Draco, he resumed his seat and sent a dark scowl at the tapestry.
Thin Lips looked practically gleeful as he took in Draco’s approach. “If it isn’t young Malfoy! Come to join the merry party?”
“So dramatic.” Potter sighed, rinsing James’ hair. Draco stuck his tongue out at his back and Al giggled.
“That is something that happens to everyone,” a cool voice spoke up from behind them.
“Draco darling!” His mother looked up with sparkling eyes. “I’m baking gingerbread!”
carry on.”
“Whatever do you mean Potter?” Draco was all innocence.
“Where do you want to spread this?”
“Potter,” Draco enunciated slowly, rubbing at the bridge of his nose tiredly, “I’ve spent the better half of the morning on my feet and would very much like to go home now, so perhaps you could cut to the chase and tell me if there is a point to all this. Honestly,
Ginny ignored him in favour of regarding Draco intently. “He didn’t make you eat anything, right? Smell something? Touch something? Repeat something?”
The owl obligingly withdrew his attack and perched on the back of Draco’s garden chair, still giving Potter dirty looks, and Potter watched him warily as he finally got off Draco and onto his feet, wands still clutched in his hand. When he seemed to deem it safe to look away, he turned his attention back to Draco, and after only a brief moment of hesitation, held out a hand for him to take.
like one too.
” Draco cried, appalled and still struggling valiantly. “Salazar, how are you this strong?” His mother must have cast some sort of strengthening spell on herself for it only took one more pull for the covers to get away from him.
. And what was she even doing kissing me when she’d been crying over Cedric like five seconds ago?”
and Draco snorted loudly at its ridiculousness.
“I’ll just go down to the kitchen to get some more mini pies. I’m pretty sure Weasley ate the last plate all by himself.”
There was a silence and Draco wondered why Potter suddenly looked nervous. “So…” Potter began and then trailed off, biting his lip and looking away at the dark street. Draco found himself once again waiting patiently for him to continue – something he found himself doing a lot these days – but Potter just continued to stare at the street.
“Ginny tore a right strip off of me when I told her what happened,” Potter continued. “Yelled at me for a good half hour I think, and even threatened to hex my bollocks off if I didn’t apologise as soon as I could.”
“I think your eyes are bigger too,” the Weaslette continued, tapping a finger contemplatively on her chin. “Or it could be that your face is thinner. Your hair is longer too.”
“In retrospect, I suppose it was a little foolish of me,” Draco admitted with a shrug. “But remember, I was in a kiss-induced daze and wasn’t thinking straight.”
Draco’s heart was pounding painfully and he snatched up his wand, flicking it wildly at the balloon and trying to inflate it the wizard way. When nothing happened, he tried again, frustration building. What good was he as a wizard if he couldn’t even get a stupid wand to listen to him?
“Okay, we need to stop.” Potter laughed, and Draco found himself joining in.
Draco threw the letter down, jaw tight with frustration. He thought back to the library when Potter was snuggled in his lap; how he’d leant on his shoulder afterwards while they ate sandwiches and insisted Draco feed him. Then there was what had happened as he was leaving that night… Certainly at the moment he was
“Still not an excuse for missing the ceremony.”
Draco would later excuse his sudden loss of sense to be due to too much time spent in the sun that day, because surely if he’d had his wits about him, he wouldn’t have answered James’ query with a “Not busy at all actually.”
“Mother.” he replied pleasantly. “And how nice to see you too Aunt Dromeda.”
“And what about my mother? She’s Black too.”
“I wasn’t whinging!”
Just then a large train came to a stop in front of them and Potter ushered Draco and the children through before boarding it himself. Unlike in the Hogwarts express, there were no compartments or corridors, instead there were just seats lining the walls. James, Albus and Teddy scrambled into a couple of seats on one side while Potter moved to the other side.
“We could tell them to fuck off and then run away to Romania until they find something better to report about.”
“Why won’t it work already?” he growled, glaring daggers at the thing. “We must have hit it with
“Where are the children?” Draco asked, looking around. “Aren’t they coming too?”
“Bloody buggering fuck!” he screams and then yells again when he unconsciously steps back under the shower and shampoo drips into his eyes. Snape is still standing there sneering at him and Harry quickly reaches down to cover his bits, but ends up knocking his elbow against the tiled wall and then slipping on the sudsy floor quite spectacularly. He makes a wild grab at the shower curtain but it isn’t strong enough to support his weight and he pulls it down with him as he falls, landing in a tangled heap. He narrowly misses banging his head on the ground, but his arm takes the brunt of the fall and he groans piteously.
at Ginny. “I think it might be better if I go home actually…” he trailed off as he noticed Weasley’s gaze focusing on Draco’s neck, and Draco
“Yes, why?”
“I cannot believe you did that!” Potter said for the umpteenth time since they left the shop.
known each other for years, but in Draco’s opinion, unconcealed contempt and brutal hostility didn’t really count as an acquaintance.
“I suppose that has its merits if ever they find themselves unable to perform magic.” Draco said and it was obviously the correct response as Potter gave him a radiant smile.
“Well, it needs repeating. You’ve been gone far too long.” she chided gently as they walked out onto her veranda.
Potter gaped wordlessly, clearly having expected a different sort of answer. Draco sighed.
The banter – Draco finally accepted that it was indeed banter after they’d had a particularly spirited debate of the merits of treacle tart versus that of apple pie – went on, and before he even knew it, he’d spent an extended period of time with Potter and they’d actually been engaged in civilised conversation. Now, curled up in plush armchairs in Potter’s sitting room, they were in the middle of crooning over the new Firebolt model when the fireplace flared and Weasley stepped through. He seemed surprised to see Draco there but didn’t seem too bothered by it. He did give Potter a strange smile though, and Potter’s good mood went away in an instance.
“You won’t find me complaining,” Potter replied with a shrug. “The more people looking out for Gin, the better. Okay, it’s my turn now. Ferrets.”
“He means friends,” Potter said to no one in particular, looking very amused.
“I know I was out of line when we fought over it, but also that you always look so

do we have here?” Charlie – for he had to be Ginny’s dragon tamer of a brother – gave a lazy smile, taking him in from head to toe.
Harry tries to stay mad at Draco for the pumpkin incident, but it’s pretty hard when your boyfriend employs the basest of means to get back into Harry’s good graces. That is to say, Draco alternates between putting a puppy to shame with acts of cuteness which he
“Oh, I will. A proper splurge, in fact,” she declared gleefully. “I worked at George’s shop for a while before school began and I’ve saved up quite a lot. I’m going all out with everyone’s birthday presents this year. You know, I used to think that presents were a superficial way of showing love and so I didn’t put so much effort before. The family never minded but I’ve had boyfriends who thought it meant I didn’t care for them. Hoping to change that this year and get him something to show just how much he means to me.”
He thought he could hear someone rushing after him but he didn’t slow down in his strides, and even though he hadn’t stooped to actually running away, he knew that he was still pretty damn fast. He emerged into the hallway in a matter of seconds and soon he was wrenching the front door open with so much force that it crashed into the wall. He hoped the plaster had broken.
“Night, Granger.”
approve of this?”
“Yeah,” the other man chimed in, his nasally tone grating on Draco’s already frayed nerves. “Let off with nothing more than six months house arrest with no magic. Sounds awfully suspicious to me.” He addressed this to the crowd and many gave murmurs of agreement. Draco’s hands curled into fists.
Draco smirked. “Does this plan involve a bed?”
Potter laughed. “You should have gone into theatre. You’re practically made for it.”
,” Pansy sniffed waspishly, crossing her arms. “You might try to play it off as drunken behaviour but it seems to me that anything he may have felt for Ginny just isn’t there anymore.”
“No,” he said slowly, turning back to the Al. “We weren’t friends.”
Draco smiled. “That’s the seventh time today that you’ve said that.”
even though I didn’t do anything. And finally you storm up here, ranting about how I should stop slacking off, when it was
“Just –
“Draco, there you are,” his mother greeted, and then wrinkled her nose as she took in his appearance. “My, don’t you look… comfortable.”
“Oh, he certainly should,” Pansy agreed ominously. “Gryffindor honour, my arse. One would think that our beloved Saviour would be above cheating, but I guess he’s nothing more than a fuckboy.”
“Yeah!” James added vehemently.
Malfoy.”
Potter gave a startled laugh. “Just like that? No test run?”
“Hmm, I think my house elf might like you better than me,” Potter observed, accepting the plate of biscuits Draco handed to him.
“It’s not that,” Weasley indignantly called after him. “We’re celebrating Malfoy finishing the job.”
“Some of my friends were staying back for the Easter hols, and they asked me to stay too,” he continued. “But I know that Gran feels lonely without me and I love coming home anyways. Sometimes I stay over at Harry’s and he lets me eat ice cream before dinner, but don’t tell Gran or she’ll be mad.” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “Harry’s the best Godfather in the world! He lets me do
“Good afternoon.” she said cheerily after giving the boy the initial push. He seemed capable of doing the rest himself. “Lovely day isn’t it?”
“It was nothing, really.” Pansy gave a small smile. “Anyways, did you call for a reason or just to chat?”
“We’ll see Al.” Potter replied.
Potter returned to his place next to Draco and when Weasley’s attention was elsewhere, he leant in close. “You okay? Ron didn’t bother you?” he asked quietly, giving Draco’s hand a slight squeeze.
Potter leant forward suddenly, an unexpectedly wicked grin on his face that had Draco feeling strangely suffocated. “I could offer you money if you wanted, or other… compensations.” The way he said ‘compensations’ was almost obscene, and Draco wondered for a mad moment if Potter was
“It’s so nice to meet a friend of Harry’s.” she continued. “Did you also go to that mysterious boarding school of his?”
to do it. He couldn’t fail now when Ginny was cheering him on; when she’d believed in him and chosen him as her Seeker and declared that without a doubt, he would catch the Snitch. Draco had spent a lot of his life failing, and maybe a friendly game of Quidditch didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, but in that moment, he knew that he couldn’t fail here. He simply refused to let Potter beat him to the Snitch.
“Salazar, this is heavenly!”
“I had a Burning Hex shot at me today,” Draco added before he could stop himself, the words leaving him in a rush. “I ducked out of the way, but it left a crater in the stone wall behind me.”
When his fingertips come in contact with Harry’s cheeks, both of them let out twin sighs, and then Harry has an armful of Draco and is crushing him back against the wall, feverishly stroking his soft blonde hair as Draco clings to him and buries his head in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco trudged off to bed, his feet dragging behind him. He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was exhausted and it was with a sigh of relief did he finally slip between the covers of his enormous bed. He was already more than halfway towards deep slumber when an image of Potter popped into his head, the look he’d had when Draco had tried to comfort him. With that picture in mind, Draco drifted off to sleep but not before realizing that what he felt for Potter now was definitely more than attraction.
“If you want, you should come.” he said. “The children will be spending the day at the Burrow though so it’ll just be me, but I’m sure Dromeda would love to have you. I have lunch with her every Saturday.”
“Also, it’s not that I think you can’t take care of yourself,” Potter smiled wryly. “Far from it. It’s just– people can be vicious and sometimes things go too far.”
Draco took a fortifying breath. He didn’t know what he was doing anymore. “If you don’t need anything, then I’m leaving.” He tried to turn away but Harry grasped his arm tight enough to bruise.
“Godric, who would have thought,” Ginny wheezed.
Ginny let out a horrified giggle. “What a way to put it.”
was the one doing the mooning. Perhaps she finds that I am preferable to a boyfriend who just isn’t attentive enough,” Draco finished harshly.
“You’re becoming one of us normal folk!” Draco exclaimed in a mock shocked voice. “Be still my heart, Harry Potter admitting that he enjoys a nonlife-threatening life. Wonders will never cease it seems.”
“We only broke the barriers on the entrances for now,” Potter answered. “We’ll probably start with the contents tomorrow, if Malfoy’s up for it.”
Ginevra studied him for a moment before nodding her head. “Huh, he was right. You
Only recently had his mother begun to show an independence that hadn’t been there when Lucius was around. Draco thought it partly had to do with her re-acquaintance with her sister, but mostly it was just because she was finally free to make her own decisions for once. Same as he was.
A loud, excited hoot rang through the room as he got into bed, and he couldn’t help a smile when Mercury dove in through the open window and crashed spectacularly onto his coverlet.
Potter hummed noncommittally and began to tap at the wooden floorboards with the tips of his fingers. The rhythmic
“And by ‘weasel’ you mean Ron? Whatever do you call the others then?”
“It’s not my fault you’re so jumpy.”
“Would you, of all people, really encourage this?” he asked shakily.
Draco sighed before turning to his husband who had a similar expression of weariness. “Were we honestly counting the days for the term to end? I already want to send them back.”
“I didn’t know you understood how those things worked.”
“Dwaco.” Lily said in a pleased voice, rubbing her cheek against his own as if she were a nuzzling kitten.
“Thank you,” he says as Draco helps him stand. He finally flips the trip back up and the room is flooded with light. Draco is still staring at him in concern, but the corners of his mouth are twitching and Harry knows that he’s fighting a smile.
“Perfect conditions for flying,” she remarked, turning her face up to look at the clear sky with nary a cloud in sight. “We’ve been sitting down on our arses for too long and I feel stiff. Fancy a flight? I’ll even let you use my usual broom while I take the old one.”
proud of it. Instead of continuing on as archaic bigots stuck too firmly in the old ways, they were accepting and unprejudiced, both of which were admirable traits to have.
“I’ll admit that was my first time having it, but I liked it.” Draco assured him.
Draco huffs and turns to him with a pout. “You should be taking my side.”
“He’ll be properly stuffed when I’m done with him,” Ginny promised, giving him a slightly terrifying grin. Satisfied, Molly gave him a pat and then went back in, taking the clock with her.
terribly miserable all day…”
Draco considered the note for a moment. He wasn’t sure how he felt about picking out a gift for the Weaslette but he was willing to admit that it would be worth it to spend time with the Potters. He hadn’t seen them for almost a week now, and he had nothing planned for the day anyways. Making up his mind, he quickly summoned a parchment and quill to jot down a note for Mother. She was out having lunch with Aunt Dromeda and he didn’t want her to go into a panic if she came home to an empty Manor. She seemed to think that he’d pick up and leave again the minute her back was turned, no matter how many times Draco assured her that he was back for good.
Draco waited until everyone else had gone and as soon as the door closed behind them, he dropped the flirty attitude, regarding Potter apprehensively. Potter stared back impassively for a moment and then shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and turned away. Draco internally winced. Apparently Potter wasn’t going to make this any easier for him.
Potter startled violently from where he was standing by the fireplace and opened his mouth to respond before abruptly shutting it with an audible snap, his eyes widening. For a few uncomfortable moments, all he did was stare openly, and Draco wrapped his arms around himself self-consciously. He was keenly aware of the fact that his shirt was so thin it was practically translucent and so big that even now, it had slid halfway off one shoulder and threatened to fall off completely. At least he was wearing cotton trousers instead of shorts for once – small comforts but he’d take them. He wondered what he looked like to Potter. Probably like some washed-up street urchin.
“Ow, Draco, what the–” Potter grumbled, a mix of frustration and confusion on his face.
“That’s surprisingly philosophical of you,” Draco said, impressed.
“Things
“Anyways,” Draco continued. “I finished my Mastery but had no desire to return just yet. The professor I studied under in Paris suggested that I travel and gave me a list of Masters I might look up on the way. I’d never really done much travelling before, except for the occasional shopping trip to Paris or Milan with Mother, so I thought why not?”
“Good afternoon, Mr Weasley.”
“Bugger off.”
. Very gentlemanly of him, if you ask me. We did everything else though,” he finished with a dreamy sigh. “Best day of my life, tops, and sadly my one and only real experience with a man.”
“Ah, but Potter, you can’t tell anyone,” Draco told him seriously, though he was pretty sure his twitching lips gave the game away. “I must swear you to secrecy lest I end up accused of being the perpetrator.”
Draco poured himself a cup of tea and added a dollop of milk and heaps of sugar. “It would seem so.”
“Oh, I see,” Draco sniffed. “So you’re only apologising for your excessive rudeness and false accusations because you want to keep your bollocks intact. Such a display of repentance as I’ve never seen before.”
“You have to do something–
Potter rubbed at his nose and looked away. “I was trying to be delicate about it.”
“It’s true.” Harry said with a shake of the head. “Unless you have a Hermione.”
His mother looked so carefree as she nattered on about the many things she would make for him when she’d mastered cooking, and he swallowed the lump had suddenly come to his throat.
Almost as if it understands his plan, the spider suddenly darts out from under the table and settles down right in front of the door. Draco pulls Harry closer by his collar and practically hisses into his face.
Weasley turned to Potter with a bewildered expression. “Mate, Malfoy’s talking weird again; make him stop.”
should be off,” he said as politely as he could, throwing a handful of Floo powder into the hearth. “Goodnight, Potter, Weasley.”
“Likewise.” his aunt said with twinkling eyes. “I must say, you do know how to make a scene.”
Harry gave a careless shrug. “I thought you looked simply ravishing.” he said with a wicked smile.
Weasley went over to put his arm around her and loudly kissed the side of her head. “Don’t worry, your nosiness is one of the things I love about you,” he chuckled, and Granger smacked him slightly on the arm.
“Your eyes are just like Sirius’ too,” Potter added softly, eyes downcast.
“Indeed.
A competitive gleam came into Ginny’s eyes. “No, I think we should make this a fair game. What’s your broom model?”
“I meant no offense when I suggested a new owl.”
“I may have forgotten to mention that one detail.”
“Harry, that harpy’s watching us,” Draco hisses as he glares across at the house opposite. Harry glances over as well and can make out the outline of a woman behind the curtains. When they’d moved in last week, she’d mistaken them for brothers only to have Draco politely inform her that they were boyfriends. Ever since then, she’s already told them at least fifty times that they are ‘living in sin’. It’s even starting to get on Harry’s nerves now.
“They’re ready!” Teddy’s excited voice drifted into the sitting room and his body soon followed. He bounded in carrying a plate of steaming gingerbread cookies which he thrust under their noses.
Draco looked up with a scowl.  “Mother, must you always side against me?”
James seemed to consider this. “A million bajillion times?”
Granger beamed again. “Like they say, there’s no time like the present.”
“Firebolt. I still haven’t gotten on to buying a newer model.”
His mother’s eyes softened a bit as she regarded the picture. “I suppose you’re right.” she sighed.
Draco drew a shaky breath. “More than Greg or Vince,
“This calls for celebration!” Draco announces, bounding back into the house. “Take a seat while I get us some wine,” he calls back.
Draco turned around so fast he might have given himself whiplash, and he was just in time to see Potter drop the cursed book – which Draco had
Draco probably should have exercised a little caution here, but the words had already left his mouth by the time his self-preservation came into play. He watched Ginny cautiously, unsure of how she would react to his abrupt coming out. He’d never made his preferences a secret, but he hadn’t broadcasted them either and it was unlikely Ginny had heard about him.
Draco was sure a wicked look had come onto his face. “Well…” he began but Potter suddenly intervened.
“You’re going to have to transfigure your robes again.” Harry laughed.
“But I don’t want to! I am
Mirage-Pansy rolled her eyes in a wonderful imitation of the real one. “Get up, idiot. We’re real, unfortunately for you.”
, Potter needs– I don’t–” Draco choked and clutched at his throat. He couldn’t seem to formulate proper sentences.
“Thank you,” Draco said stiffly as he grabbed at them, hoping it was too dark for Potter to have seen what the novel was.
Potter laughed. “It would make a pretty headline wouldn’t it?”
! Mind you it was stamping its paws and looking like it wanted to make us its dinner.” He made the smoke hippogriff also stamp around in agitation. “Of course in the end it was Potter that went up to the beast and managed to pet it and after that he even went for a ride on it!” He conjured up a smoke Potter and made it get on the hippogriff before he sent them both whizzing about the room. The children cheered in delight.
“No one told me any of this, alright,” Draco argued back, the idiotic feeling only getting worse. “How the hell was I supposed to know?”
“I’m fine, Potter. I may have inhaled an unhealthy amount of dust though,” he added with a forced laugh.
“Mother, how could you not tell me any of this?” Draco demanded angrily, although most of the anger was directed at himself. He should have known what was happening. He should have been there to protect her.
Potter finally sat up. “Malfoy was trying to tell me something, I think.”
“Pearl sitting room, Zabini estate.”
“I was
Draco sighed, leaning into the touch. He wasn’t sure how to tell them about his dilemma. It was just so complicated and the concerned looks they were giving him weren’t making matters easier.
Draco stared in shock. It was one thing for there being suspicions about his feelings for Harry and a completely different thing to hear it being voiced out so blatantly.
“Please, Draco, no young person goes to bed at eight,” his mother interrupted again. “I was quite embarrassed when I had to tell Mr Potter to wait as I sent Blimpy up to rouse you.”
“Then why are you here?” Blaise asked.
“Were you alright by yourself?”
A befitting name when one compared the owl’s incessant hooting and never-ending energy to that of the messenger of the Gods, known in tales for his speed and love of gossip.
Draco faltered. A question was much more difficult to deflect.
Mercury simply gave him an unimpressed stare and then proceeded to burrow deeper into Draco’s favourite pillow, no doubt getting all sorts of owl germs and fleas on it. Not to mention the damage his claws were doing to the silk cover.
after going back to the Manor.
“Is everything alright?” Potter’s voice asked from behind him and he turned to see him standing there with two paper cups in his hand.
“Apparently hawthorn wands are good for Healing magic, Hermione told me.”
“We’re going to fight a lot.”
?” Draco was scandalized. The robes that they’d eventually bought were utterly gorgeous and would suit Ginevra as if they were
“It wasn’t foolish of you to go to Andromeda,” she replied calmly. “She is a retired Mediwitch so it is perfectly understandable that you chose to go to her for aid. In fact, had you messaged St Mungo’s, we’re not even sure if they would have taken your call.”
to reduce it to rags and then hands it back to Harry. “Here, put it on.”
Pansy actually gave her a small smile and a nod. Blaise blew her a cheeky kiss and then the connection was cut.
“You know
“It’s kind of obvious that you’re both head over heels for each other.” she continued. “All you have to do is let go and let it happen.”
Pansy’s eyes widened. “The contract is
thinking of how right it had felt to have Potter’s arms wrapped so tightly around him before.
. Her gaze softened then and she finally looked back at Draco.
The elf bowed low and warbled, “Kreacher would like to bring Master Draco some biscuits but he is not knowing what flavour Master prefers.”
“Not as much as yours would say if I told her about that night in Liverpool,” Draco returned with a vicious smirk.
“Really? I’d have never guessed,” Draco retorted sarcastically.
“If we’re done here, I really must be getting home.”
“It’s a start,” Granger muttered, rolling her eyes. She came forward and held out her hand. “Good to see you out and about, Draco.”
A day past and Draco was still in a foul mood. His mother had most probably heard the whole story from Ginny, and she made sure to stay away from him. She must have warned the house elves as well, and as such, Mercury was his only source of companionship at present. Draco didn’t mind so much, finding that his owl was pretty good at listening to his rants.
“Couldn’t you have just been a prat?” Harry continued angrily. “You just had to be all friendly and understanding and sarcastic in the most refreshing way possible, not to mention being a wet dream walking! Do you know how hard it was not to jump you the first time I saw you wearing those bloody Muggle jeans? I was practically
The surprise in Potter’s voice did not go unnoticed and Weasley coughed pointedly, prompting him to immediately blush hotly.
“Yes, I heard, but I meant
Draco sighed. “Would these robes be for casual wear or for some sort of a fancy occasion?”
When they reached the library, Weasley unceremoniously let go and practically threw him into the room. Draco stumbled on the rug and almost fell over. He shot Weasley a dirty look.
“Actually, I was thinking of sticking round a bit longer.”
“Why don’t you all introduce yourselves then?” Potter suggested. “I’m here so it’ll still be official enough.”
Mercury instantly stiffened and huge amber eyes stared back at him accusingly, the hurt in them all too clear. The look made Draco feel like he’d just killed someone and he sighed, practically feeling himself melt.
Pansy scowled. “Tell us everything.”
Draco managed to hold out for a minute and was proud of it.
“Thank you. Do you like my earrings as well?” she asked, tapping one of the carrot-shaped earrings with her pinkie.
“It was nothing.” Potter replied, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “Sorry you had to have mac n’ cheese like the kids.”
Draco felt a twinge of regret at that, although he’d never entertained the idea of Potter as a Slytherin. He sometimes wondered what it might have been like to be his friend, but he’d never
“Are you Draco Malfoy?” he asked.
a fan of Joyce Gretchin?”
Instead, he pulled out the oak wand that he couldn’t quite bring himself to call ‘his’ yet. It had belonged to his Grandmother Druella and didn’t fully feel
Aunt Dromeda looked grim. “Cut the connection, I’m coming through. Cissy, watch Teddy, will you?”
Potter crossed his arms. “I’m sorry, what were you saying?”
Potter actually growled as he sat down heavily by his own pile. “I couldn’t even begin to understand you, if my life depended on it,” he muttered.
Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him along as he rushed after the children. “Here’s the plan. We find some eggs, eat some chocolate, get the kids home and in bed in less than ten minutes, and then…” He leant in so that he could whisper huskily into his ear. “You’re all mine.”
My dear aunt
Draco blinked. “Er…I wasn’t invited.”
“So you’re telling me that Potter wasn’t dating Ginny after all, he returns your feelings wholeheartedly, Weasley and Granger seem to approve as well, and you
customers.”
“I needed to hex you in person,” Pansy said matter-of-factly.
Draco snorts. “You say the most ridiculous things sometimes.”
Draco stepped forward as well, and now they were so close he could feel the warmth radiating from the man in front of him. “When I first agreed to help you, I asked you what I’d gain from it all. In all truth, I gained a lot of things. I got my wand back, I made new acquaintances–”
Draco frowned. “It’s inherited, Potter. You’ve seen my parents.”
Ginny nodded. “We’ll be off then. Bye, Parkinson, Zabini.”
suddenly popped in to join you?”
“I’m not early,
him. He’d enjoyed being friends with him and if everything went pear-shaped, he wouldn’t even have that left. It was such a gamble and Draco had never been a betting man. He preferred things to be planned out; the less variables, the less likely it was that he’d be blindsided.
“What?” Potter actually had the nerve to look affronted. “
“Oh, bugger.”
“You make it impossible not to.”
Ginny shook her head, the amusement leaving her face. “I haven’t had any need to go meet McGonagall. He’s there though, and as intimidating as ever if the tales I’ve heard are correct. The lower classes are frightfully well-behaved this year because they’re so scared of being sent to the Headmistress’ office. Apparently she isn’t there sometimes when they’re sent up and Snape takes it upon himself to lecture the kids until she gets back.”
“I’ll just take her off to bed then. It was nice meeting you, Draco.”
Draco slowly lifted off the lid and his breath hitched as he took in the sight of a familiar slim, black wand that he’d dared not hope to ever see again. He made to pick it up but stopped, suddenly afraid. After all its time with Potter, what if his wand no longer recognised him? What if it
“So you don’t hate her? Pansy, I mean,” Draco asked warily. “She did try to turn you over to that old snake-face.”
About fifteen minutes into his walk Draco came to a halt, suddenly feeling as if he was no longer alone. He was now walking in a more woodsy area, and the trees and shrubs cast shadows all around him. He listened and sure enough he heard a rustling in the bushes, the sound coming closer and closer. Draco felt a rush of panic shoot through him. What if it was some wild beast that would surely make a meal of his succulent form? Or worse, what if it was a wizard, possibly on the run from the law – a murdering psychopath perhaps? The rustling got louder and Draco finally had the sense to reach for his wand and why the bloody hell had he kept it in his robe pocket? He struggled to get it out and just as it seemed to come untangled, a small form came rushing out of the bushes.
am not a child anymore,” Draco retorted, jaw clenched. “I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and if I choose to not leave the Manor, so be it.”
When he came out, Luna was waiting for him and she held out a small vial for him. Draco fell on the hangover potion like a starving man being given food and downed it in one gulp, hardly even noticing the horrid taste. Relief was almost instantaneous and he sighed happily. Perhaps the day wouldn’t be as bad as he thought.
“Now,” she gave a sad smile. “I fear that for once you’re ready to give someone your heart and I just don’t want to see you get hurt.”
enjoyable to have the bucket talk given to you
Potter smirked. “Much better.”
“No, she did not tell me!” Draco wondered what else his mother was keeping from him. Suddenly he felt much more worried about just how much she actually knew about what had happened between him and Harry. His mother had known something was up when he’d rushed home after their confrontation, but for once she hadn’t pried. She hadn’t asked about Harry afterwards though so he’d known that she had an idea about what was troubling him. Having an idea was one thing, but if Harry had told Ginevra about what had happened, she might have told Mama Weasley and if she knew, it was almost assured that his own mother knew too.
“Draco, why did you not let me know you were back?” Narcissa asked with a frown as she came in. “Blinky had to tell me that you’d returned.”
Draco yanked his jumper back in place and tried to smooth down his hair as he got off the counter (and when had
Together, they managed to get into the attic without too much of a problem, but as Potter had predicted, it did leave a toll on them afterwards.
with a stumble but was able to right himself before he fell on his face. He made his way into Diagon Alley and headed directly to Twilfitt and Tatting’s. His mother had been quite fond of the shop and Draco knew it well. When he entered he was instantly thankful to find the shop empty apart from what he recognized to be Potter, crouched in front of a row of robes, his arse in the air. Draco might have felt embarrassed by the fact that he could identify the man by his rear alone, but he was too busy trying to stifle his laughter. He must have been unsuccessful though because Potter turned around almost immediately, a grin coming onto his face.
Draco turned to all of them, still smirking. “We’re truly grateful for all the trouble you went through, but now I ask that you all kindly leave.” He sent Potter a wicked look. “Potter and I still have some things to discuss in private.”
“So Hagrid told us a bit about the beast and then suddenly asked us to
“Oh, so I’m not the only one in the dark?” Draco asked with mock-surprise. “And here I thought I was the last to hear about this little
Draco huffed and took his place on the floor by the pile of books he’d been sorting through. “What makes you think something is wrong?”
“Potter…”
When Potter let go, he wasn’t sure whether to be disappointed or relieved. It was rather pathetic actually.
“I missed the biscuits?”
extremely charming.”
“Mother, you’re being ridiculous.” Draco said with a forced laugh. “I’ll admit we’ve put aside our differences, but Potter and I are just friends. You’ve nothing to be worried about, seeing as how nothing will ever happen between us.” He abruptly stood up. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be going now. I’ll give Luna your message.”
, not an ex-Death eater, son of Lucius and a disgraced Malfoy.”
“Prat.”
“Why do your teeth–”
Draco stared. He’d never seen Luna blush before. “Luna, are you seeing someone?”
Lily also came tottering over and held her arms out imperiously. “Up.” she commanded with all the flair of a queen. Draco could do nothing but grin and scoop her up, having grown accustomed to holding her by now. She immediately latched onto his hair and he laughed.
“You like it?” Draco has come up behind him and he looks smug as he nods at the snake. “I got it from George.” Draco brings a small black box to his mouth and says “Slytherin” to it. Almost immediately, the sound emerges from the snake in a drawn out hiss, sounding nothing like Draco’s actual voice. Harry throws the snake onto the ground in frustration.
“Well,” Draco said, staring intently at the chess board as he contemplated his next move. “I suppose you could say I’ve been just about everywhere.”
Luckily for Draco (and his boots), Mercury loved the name.
The young shopkeeper turned towards him with a cheerful smile. “Hello and welcome to–”
“Mother! Potter. Divorced. You were saying?”
Draco raises an amused brow. “Why, I believe I am playing an absolutely fabulous trick on my gullible boyfriend. Really Harry, did you honestly think you were some snake lord?”
It all sounded like gibberish to Draco and he didn’t ask any more questions for fear of looking like a fool. Instead he contented himself with playing with Lily whilst Potter made polite conversation with some Muggle woman who sat next to him. The bint didn’t seem to understand that Potter obviously didn’t want to speak to her, batting her eyelashes in a sickly sweet manner. Potter shifted uncomfortably next to him and Draco almost wished the She-weasel was here to put her in her place. The strange thing was, Potter never once told her he was married and surely when faced with unwanted flirtations, anyone would brandish a wedding ring like a battle axe. Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even wearing his ring in the first place!
“Blaise reacted much the same way you did. It was quite touching actually, watching him stalk back and forth, ranting at me for my recklessness. Then he actually had the nerve to fire-call Pansy about it and I had to contend with her shrieking at me too.”
“I’m aware of that,” Draco replied coolly.
They hear a feminine squawk of outrage and a slammed door, and laugh as they watch Harpy-lady vigorously close her curtains.
master. Who was your old one?”
Draco didn’t say anything more, instead staring around at the room. It was much more welcoming than he remembered, and he noted with approval that Potter had made use of light colours in an effort to mellow out the room a bit. There was a large tapestry that took up most of one wall and curiously, Draco moved to get a closer look.
Pansy’s hands in his hair suddenly had sharp nails and he hissed at the sting. “You’re right, you
“No! You’re going to shut up and listen to me or I swear on my life, I’ll cast a fucking
“It was a rhetorical question!”
Granger laughed. “Perhaps it hasn’t reached that stage just yet, but it sure seems to be headed that way.”
Potter made an odd noise and it almost sounded as if he was stifling a laugh, but when Draco looked at him, his face was completely serious.
“Oh, and what sort of places are you taking Ginny to?”
“Of course,” Draco continues in a mocking voice. “If
“I should hope so, seeing as how I’m a man nearing his thirties.” Draco laughed.
that.”
“I don’t know!” Weasley yelled back, arms waving wildly and face still doing a worthy impression of a tomato. “I walk in and you’re yelling at ‘Mione about privacy and knocking, and you’re all bundled up like you’re naked. What’s a bloke to think?”
as he was bowled over, completely taken by surprise. His head made a dull thud on the ground and he groaned loudly. Draco grabbed fistfuls of his shirt and pulled him half off the ground before shoving him back down again, smiling with vicious delight as Potter’s head made contact with the ground a second time. It was a shame they weren’t on the stone terrace.
“Draco, there you are!” Ginny exclaimed as if she hadn’t been the one to disappear and leave him to the wolves.
“I think you’ve broken Harpy-lady though,” Harry laughs when he catches sight of her, blatantly gawking from her front porch. Draco sends her a vicious smile and then pulls Harry in for a heated kiss, which Harry reluctantly breaks with a murmured, “We’re outside.”
Draco coughed awkwardly. Blast him and his bloody innuendoes.
. Draco looked away, disconcerted and unused to Potter’s wide smiles being directed towards him.
Ginny cooed. “Aww, aren’t you just a big bundle of love.”
After that, the tension dissipated. It was as if a dam had burst free and there were no more restrictions to what they could speak about. Draco was rapidly getting to know Potter in a way he’d never dreamed of before, and he willingly offered parts of himself in return.
The Phoenix sighed longingly, “I wish, but I know he will need time, and I have some things I need to do.” He ran a hand through his long wild red hair, the curls tangling towards the end. “I should be going, the longer I wait, the harder it will be for me to leave.” He turned to walk back towards the bed, looking down on his sleep mate, running a hand through the curly brown hair and over a white- and gold-tipped fox ear.
"Tiptop, Percival will be staying in the rooms across from Harry's to provide extra protection," Bartok informed the little House-Elf who eyed Percival up and down before popping away.
I hope you liked it.
“How are your eyes feeling Harry,” Anna questioned, back in healer mode.
“I’ll kill the fucker!” Issy’s scream rocked them all, Harry flinching so hard that he dislodged himself from her grip, falling to the cold marble floor. He started to scuttle away, but ran into a long pair of legs, being lifted the next second in large arms, and giant leathery wings bursting around them. Cocooning them in warmth and safety as Bartok whispered comfortingly, it took a while for Harry to stop hyperventilating, but his breath was soon matching up with that of his Papa.
Harry felt like his body was turning to goo, his bones becoming jelly and something deep within his belly wiggling like a worm on a hook. But he had to ignore that, Neville’s hands were still on his body, slowly making him unbearably hot under his layers of blankets. Luckily for Harry, Neville pulled back after one last sweep of curious fingers over the tip of his fox ears, and his friend was rolling out of bed, silk pants low on his hips as he made his way to the restroom.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco and Nev would totally team up to kill umbridge for this.
Harry’s observations were cut short by Issy tackling them. Only David’s much larger form kept them all from falling to the ground. Harry wiggled out of the older man’s hold so he could hug Issy properly. “Mummy, you are so pretty,” Harry whispered into her hair.
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
I also want to say that yes at this point Harry is very emotional both because he still can't see and all the Claremores do is in such contrast to what he knows that he is constantly being overwhelmed. Once he can see and gets used to this new life he will calm down a lot.
Healer Lorraine continued, "I am unsure of how long it will take to get in contact with a potions master both able and willing to help with this. They would need a level of skill most do not and have an understanding of how the brain works and how that makes up who we are as a person. I know a few people I can start contacting, like the Terradore Potion Master's Guild."
The next thing Harry knew his head was pillowed against firm thighs, a hand running steadily through his hair, blunt fingernails scraping across his scalp with each pass. Harry began to purr, tail flicking gently, and he finally looked up to see Neville looked down at him, grin soft, “Good afternoon, sleepy.”
“When I finished- I- There was no toilet paper and- It sprayed my- It sprayed me with water,” Harry stuttered out, too humiliated to just say that the stupid toilet sprayed his bottom with water. His butthole still felt strange from the attack.
As she broke down, sobbing about her lack of magic, something she barely had to begin with, Albus started planning in his mind. His biggest problem at the moment was the lack of magic. He could fake it for a while, but Dumbledore needed some way to fix that. There was a magical artifact he knew of that could temporarily borrow magic from another. It had been invented by Cortez Mogan for his squib sister, Carina, he made it so that she could use some of his magic to experience the feeling. Cortez was a well above average wizard and had the excess to support her using magic almost full time. Though they could only be small bits. The toll it took on the donor was double that of the spell used. However, Cortez rarely cast spells, a Runemaster and Arithmancer by trade.
Sirius and Remus were like a beacon amongst the mist. Their edges solid and colors vibrant.
So much had changed in these last few weeks, he had felt like he was cast adrift at sea but now, here Neville was, an island of calm in the midst of stormy seas. All he could do was hold on.
“How can Gerald help master Gryffindor?” The wizened Elf looked up at him after giving the chambers a disgusted once over.
Siles was still standing in the middle of the room, looking over Harry with a look the boy couldn’t begin to identify. Harry pulled his fuzzy blanket tighter around himself and raised his book to hid his face within the pages, looking over the edge warily.
A voice hissed, a loud thump of a hand on an arm trying to quiet the other boy.
His wolf had once again howled in distress, as it had through most of the year when he saw Harry. That was the moment he decided to embrace those instincts. So when Remus’ wolf had almost taken control to rip open the Headmaster’s throat, Remus hadn’t trusted the man when Dumbledore told them about the abduction. Remus had held Sirius’ hand within his in a death grip under the table, tapping out one of their old secret codes that meant ‘wait’. It had taken two repetitions before Sirius remembered what it was. It was Sirius himself that proposed a secret code after he snuck out one Christmas break to see a Muggle spy movie. It turned out to be invaluable while they were pulling off pranks.
Neville and Issy were both quick to plaster themselves to Harry's sides. His Mummy pulled his head into her chest, cradling his jaw in one of her soft hands, but the fingers of his left hand were tightly entwined with Neville’s, refusing to let go of his rock in this storm.
David’s eyes went wide, and before Harry knew it, he was being pulled down atop his dad. He couldn’t help but giggle and hide his face in the older man’s neck. “Dad!” Harry squeaked as David’s stubble rough face nuzzled against Harry’s forehead.
Harry pulled further into himself, unsure of what to do. After a few seconds of the man looking at him expectantly, Harry finally whispered his first name.
“Sal!” The man didn’t turn around or acknowledge him, so he tried again, voice booming and soul singing a calming tune. “Salazar Slytherin you listen to me now!” Sal turned around, eyes wild. Godric slowly walked up to him, as if the man was a cornered animal, hands clearly in sight.
Dumbledore sat there in utter shock, unable to even think.
After all these years, and now that he knew the betrayal they had committed on him, his anger finally bubbled up. “No,” Harry whispered, looking down at his bear before he finally looked up, glaring at Ron. “I don’t want to go with you. I want to stay here with my family, I am happy, and I have everything I could ever want.” Harry stated, making his position clear.
The only boy with glasses was the next to speak, “All we want is to make sure Harry is okay and to make sure he knows that we really care for him and had nothing to do with those peoples horrendous actions. We will willingly submit to truth serum to prove that we had nothing to do with this.”
David would have to consult Anna and Issy since they were more likely to know someone they could go to.
Without his wand, and with his core steadily leaking, he couldn’t cast a Patronus to try and contact Minerva, so he had no choice but to apparate to his nearest safe house.
"We have you set up in the rooms across from Harry's so that if anything happens you are close at hand. Though I would like to see anyone try to bypass Tiptop, she has set up a plethora of elven wards down the hallway leading to Harry's room, we will have to tell her to allow you access." Bartok looked amused as he guided Percival through the house, the portraits greeting them as they passed.
The twins were bouncing up and down in their seats at the news. Arthur smiled softly at his boys, and Bartok could see how much the man loved and cared for his children in that one look. Arthur looked over at Bartok, sharing a knowing look that they would be family at some point.
Then came the removal of the years of bindings and unnecessary or detrimental wards that needed to be removed. Those were much easier to deal with since they were the ones to construct the original ward scheme and were also much older than Dumbledore so knew all of the wards and spells he had used. Once they lifted the final binding, a booming voice rattled through the room.
But when Sirius learned what his wolf had called the Headmaster, the first thing he did was bar the man and all others from the house, leaving the wards open only to the two of them and Harry.
He was torn, they were all his children, and he only wanted what was best for them. But he also could not abide Ginny and Ron stealing from anyone, especially not their family. Arthur got up and went to his bedroom, not noticing his twins peeking around their door to watch his determined face.
“Albus!” Dedalus shouted voice quivering and lower lip wobbling. Dumbledore wanted to shoot a stinging hex at the man and tell him to grow up, but before he could, the other man spoke up again. “Albus… We lost the proxy for the Black, Lupin, Peverall and Potter seats. That is what I was trying to tell you. I flooed your office in Hogwarts, but there was no answer.”
Augusta relaxed back into her chair. As a Black, people doing something out of the kindness of their heart without any gain always confused her. Even Augusta doing things to help Harry benefited her.
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
Godric swallowed thickly, memories of that same tone coming from Helga after a battle haunting him. He was quick to nod in agreement and start talking again to try and distract her. “Yes, ma’am.” Godric coughed, the reply reflexive. “I came here because while retrieving the stolen Potter artifacts, we came across a dungeon full of prisoners in one of the Dumbledore residences.”
“Me?! Fat?! How dare you!” Godric hissed, no real heat in it but he still rolls off.
The adults were talking about what plans they had for the day. When Augusta started talking about Neville’s parents both boys stopped playing and listened to what the Dowager had to say. “I believe we should move Frank and Alice. With all that has been revealed about Albus, I don’t feel comfortable leaving them where he could try to use them against us.”
Bill followed his Father command without any hesitation, wand movements quick and decisive.
He couldn’t believe they dared look at him like that, he was the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He had reached for his wand, to blast them to pieces, only to find he was still in his sleepwear and his wand must still be on his nightstand in his chambers. Albus cursed under his breath, swearing that he would curse whoever had done this to him. He could barely handle the pranks the children pulled, but they were easily removed and for the most part, never directed his way.
He and his Grandmother listened to what the head healer had planned to hopefully help his parents out. Shocked that there was so much they considered trying. By the time they left Neville was overwhelmed and ready to sleep.
I leave to Minerva Brighid McGonagall of Kintail, Scotland, if she shall survive me, Vault 587. If she is unable to accept this bequest it shall be donated to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry’s Library. Aunt Minnie, thank you for always being there for me, and I hope you get to know Harry and steer him in the right direction if you are still working at Hogwarts when he starts attending. Regardless of that, with my Mother now gone, I hope you will consider taking up the role of Grandmother to Harry. The vault contains copies of most of the ancient texts my family has amassed.
“If you don’t mind me asking what was this shocking news?” Bartok queried, wanting with all his heart for a reason to believe these men. Harry cared for them so much that he couldn’t help but want them to have not betrayed his son. But he was still wary and wouldn’t believe them without using truth serum, he wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt Harry, and if there was any chance they would, he would cut them out faster than they could say lawsuit.
Neville coughed a few times, clearing his throat but his voice still came out shakily and much higher than normal. “Are you okay? I-I heard you scream?” Neville sounded so unsure but he obviously wouldn’t leave until he knew Harry was alright.
Harry was surprised that anyone would make him heir just because he defeated Lord Voldemort, but then he thought maybe the Lord was old and had lost his family and had no one else to take over the heirship. “I would like to meet Lord Gaunt at some point so I can thank him and get to know the family history.” Harry wanted to make sure he honored this man and his family history.
The impromptu cheese lesson ended then, Harry devoting all of his attention to his faithful friend. Her feathers were clean, and her beak was glossy, she hadn’t looked this good since before they left Hogwarts and Harry glad to see she was being taken care of when he couldn’t. Hedwig started talking to Harry, expecting him to understand but he couldn’t and that clearly frustrated her.
“Molly, dear, calm yourself. I am sure we can get this back under control, we were only doing what was best for the children and were trying to save them from Voldemort.” Albus reassured calmly, eyes twinkling. He needed her to believe in him completely, her faith in him was one of the only reasons he had been able to control her so completely. Well, that and the subtle compulsions he placed on her long ago. “We, unfortunately, have bigger things to worry about than the Goblins.” Albus used the tip of his wand pull over the decree from Lady Magic, unwilling to touch it. Molly snatched up the paper, hissing at the feel of the magic on it.
Remus seemed to gather himself, straightening up in a way Sirius recognized as his Professor pose. “Harry, two men can have sex, so can two women.”
Bartok took Harry back through the floo to the manor, handing over the shrunken portrait, Neville sitting on the couch in the receiving room with a book in his lap, waiting for their return. Harry rushed right over to his mate, and Bartok couldn’t help the sappy grin on his face. To see someone who cared for his little boy would always make him happy. Harry deserved so much better than what his life had been that anything that brought him happiness also brought Bartok happiness.
His mind screeched. His fists in tight balls and his feet now hooked around Harry’s calves. “Who?” Neville hissed, needed to know who to go after.
Godric had known that Dumbledore had tampered with the wards, there was no way either the Cerberus or Troll would have gotten into the school without him doing that. But something the man had done was slowly strangling the life out of the school and stealing her voice.
Harry groaned as he pulled his blankets over his head, smothering his embarrassment in the soft fabric. It had been less than twenty-four hours since his Godfathers explained sex and sexuality to him and it seemed as if Harry had gone insane. After years of never thinking about it suddenly all his thoughts were consumed by it.
Lyle grinned, every inch of him radiating excitement. “Well, son, one of my best friends, is a Technomage and he has been working towards blending Muggle technology and magic. This is his first product, he has the workings sorted out but is now looking for the backing to make it go worlds wide. He allowed me to purchase a prototype for you. I hope you like it!”
The six Weasleys men, all without hesitation, reassured Bartok that they all cared for Harry, the twins going so far as to proclaim their love for Harry again.
Dumbledore jumped up, the two Weasleys following, as he bristled at Percival’s demand. “Now see here, you cannot just dismiss me, I am the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump!” His wand appeared in his hand as he faced the imposing Auror.
“Yes, there is that brother dear.” The second rolled his eyes and Bartok wished he could tell them apart. “But we had no clue there was anything else going on. When we found out we were ready to kill them…” They both blushed but the steely look in their eyes said that they would still do it in a heartbeat.
And then Harry remembered, they had discussed it in detail yesterday what the return of his sight would be like. But red hadn’t been part of the expectations. Harry sat bolt upright, head swiveling around as he took in his surroundings. It took several seconds of constant blinking before the blur of sleep lifted. And then he realized.
Neville ate in silence while the Claremores talked, his Grandmother, Professor Lupin and Lord Black missing, still staring out into the garden. Harry kept sneaking glances between questions from his parents. When Harry asked where the others were Issy and Anna informed him that Remus and Sirius were both sleeping in late and that Madam Longbottom was out taking care of family business.
Harry then poked at his shaft, the organ easily shifting with the movement.
All five older Weasley boys looked over to Arthur sharply, shocked that he would ever do such a thing. Arthur, however, looked just as bewildered, “I never did such a thing and I promised never to do such a thing to any of my children.”
But he would rather have Salazar at his side than keep the man ignorant of the facts.
Also subtitled: Poor Neville
Sleep started to fall from Harry’s brain, face pressed into his soft blanket and body warm. He wished he could sleep for longer, but he was already at the point of no return. So he squinted. His eyes open, still a reflex from years of sight.
When Harry first stepped foot onto the Hogwarts grounds, he knew what the child would be to him. Could hear his intoxicating magic calling out mournfully to him and all he could do was sing back, reassurance in every note.
“Angry? Angry?! He kept me as a slave!” Severus bellowed, horns bursting through his forehead, causing his rage to grow with the pain now pounding his skull. He took one menacing step forward, refusing to back down. How dare this unknown Draken get in the way of his kill.
After that, Godric hadn't been able to move him from the rooms, even for sleep. Instead, the man would slump over a workbench, drooling onto the wooden tops. While a book always in hand or at his side. Godric just enjoyed his company and his babbling rants about all the new advancements.
Augusta looked up, curiosity clear across her face. "What happened last night?"
They eat a lunch of finger sandwiches cuddled together on the TV room couch while watching Star Wars. Lyle had insisted on it when he found out that Harry had never seen the movie, he had acted horrified and it had made Harry burst into laughter.
Remus shot Bartok a distressed look, the two sharing an entire conversation in seconds. Remus got up and rushed out of the room. Harry looked at his Papa in confusion.
After they finished up, Bartok wiping a smudge of grease from Harry’s lips, they headed to the bank. Harry’s head swiveling around the whole way. This was the first time Harry had the chance to see Terradore. The marketplace was grand, hundreds of different stores and stands, people going about their own business without pausing for a moment to stare at Harry.
Dumbledore froze in shock. The Goblins had conducted an audit and not only that, they were now demanding he return the money and items that were rightfully his but they were also charging him interest.
Ginny scoffed, not noticing the danger she was in, Percy however did and was quick to take his younger Brother’s wands. “Mother and Father made a marriage contract for us.”
A clearing of the throat, somehow stately, finally pulled their minds away from focusing solely on each other. They both looked over to see Madam Longbottom, appearing regal in her deep blue formal robes, watching them with the tiniest smile gracing her harsh features. “Well, it looks like your mothers’ were correct.” Harry’s eyebrows raised in confusion but the Dowager continued without having to be asked. “When you were both babies you were inseparable. You both screamed when visits were over. Both of your first bouts of accidental magic were even inspired by the other. Neville, your first sign of magic was when Harry was first starting to learn to walk, he fell on his behind, you were in your mother’s arms and once Harry started crying you apparated over to him. After that, you started conjuring flowers for him to make him smile. It was very adorable and we were all so proud.”
But his fury grew, how dare they block his entrance. “What do you mean, I am the Headmaster of the school.”
“Ah, I see… Your core bindings must have blocked your ability to form your familiar bond with Miss Hedwig. We’ll have to visit a Magizoologist to get that fixed up.” David started going through the list of trustworthy Magizoologist they could get in touch with to fix this problem. The reason they couldn’t just go to a vet was to fix Harry’s ability to bond with Hedwig they would need a Magizoologist with experiences with mind magics. And none of the Claremores would ever trust Harry’s mind to just anyone.
“Dumbledore of course, how else would we be so powerful and smart?” Ginny said a proud smile on her face. All the Weasleys were shocked, mouths gaping, unable to even process what was just revealed to them.
Lorraine pulled out a piece of paper, handing a copy over to each of them after asking if Augusta was okay with Anna knowing the treatment plan. "The first thing we will be doing is physical therapy, helping them regain their muscle tone so that they can move around easily, paired with a food program to help them gain their lost weight. We will then start healing the less delicate nerves in their body. At this point, we don't want to go anywhere near their brain, as we don't want to risk making it worse until we have a full understanding of their current brain function. We have a few Muggle-born members of staff who have studied and adapted EEG to work with magic, so we can pinpoint damaged areas and make plans to heal what we can. But until then we will work on things such as their hands, so they can regain their fine motor controls. This will allow them to participate in activities around the clinic, so they don't sit around all day. The next thing we will do is judge what they are still able to do, see if their creativity is still there, and if their muscle memory is working by doing things such as tasks they had been doing for years, like brushing their teeth.
Harry hadn’t realized that the reason Sirius and Remus were keeping him close was that they didn’t know what had happened over the last month and didn’t trust these strangers with his safety. Harry realized this when Sirius said, “Dumbledore said you were kidnapped. Thanks to Mooney, we didn’t believe him, and seeing how much better you look than the last time we saw you we were right not to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was now shocked, mouth hanging open. “Wait… but why would he want to marry me?”
Augusta wanted to fall apart in a way she hadn’t since she had witnessed her Son and Daughter-in-Law laying in St. Mungos looking like fragile children, healers swarming around them, doing everything they could just to keep them stable. Not only had she gone through that, but she had also survived the loss of her husband and the near extinction of her family.
“What spectacle?” Harry questioned.
And like that his anger deflated like a burst balloon, while he might have once thought it was worth it, now that he knew that Harry needed to be protected, his Draken side was screaming for it. Severus pulled back all his Draken features with blinding pain and turned away, head bowed as he took the key from Helix and left the room, planning to go down to the vault to read the letters now. The further he got from Harry the more his now unbound creature side screamed for him to run back. To protect.
Severus, I know you haven’t replied to my many letters and that you had Albus send me a letter stating your wish to never to speak to me again, but I can’t leave it like this. Hopefully, by the time I have passed, we have reconnected. But if not, I beg you to read the letters to you in the vault. I am sorry I didn’t listen to you during fifth year, I was clouded by hero worship and didn’t take your concerns seriously. But now I know the truth and I am so sorry, so sorry, you will never know the depths of my sorrow that I lost my brother over such things. If you still don’t want to talk to me I am sorry that I am using my death to trick you into listening to my apology but I felt it was my last chance. I have told James to give you free access to my portrait if you wish it. Regardless of if you read my letter or not, know that I have always loved you.”
"How will you improve their state of living?" Augusta inquired, obviously worried what the staff was thinking of doing.
Bartok was peeking out between his wings watching and listening. His scales had flared down, going from their angry blood red back to their normal chocolate brown as he heard about the oath and Lyle read the letter. Bartok ducked his head back down, watching Harry stare up at him trustingly. “We are sorry about the misunderstanding, Harry. There was quite the display of magic when you bonded with your new wand, and none of us were expecting it. We thought you were in danger and the one to give it to you was trying to hurt you. That was who Issy cursed. She loves you very much and thought you were harmed.”
While Percival loathed child abuse the thought of being held captive was still a sore spot for him. So for a man who many magicals looked up to do both made him want to rage. To fly off and rip and tear and destroy.
Percival took a long sip of the smoky drink. “Of course, I will. However, I would like to know why? We both know you are more than capable of protecting yourself and those you care about?”
Molly just scoffed, “You married my disgusting brothers. Good riddance to the filthy faggots.” Molly’s arms were crossed fingernails digging into her forearms.
Thank you to the lovely Amycat8733, Aspen_N_Grey, and mldeal89!
Percival leaned back in his care, thoughtful until he finally seemed to realize who Bartok’s son was. “Your talking about the Potter boy.” Bartok nodded his confirmation. “I know the case was partially sealed to help keep the boy’s identity a secret. But since I am one of the Head Aurors I have at least heard of it. But I haven’t heard about anyone I know being involved.” Percival frowned, going over all he heard about the case looking for anything he had overlooked. But nothing came to mind. Percival knew Bartok and knew that the man would never accuse anyone without solid proof, so it worried him that someone he knew might be involved in the abuse of a child. He liked to think he was a good judge of character, but if Bartok was right then, he had overlooked something significant.
Sirius was still stiff on the floor, looking more confused now than anything. Anna left him stunned, if Godric was correct the mere presence of Salazar could make Sirius unstable. The two healers were quick to start their scans, taking in the many ailments the man developed during his time in Azkaban.
A loud thumping started, Harry looked over to see Remus now thumping his head against the wall. Sirius just started laughing again in response. Harry tried to jump up to stop Remus from hurting himself but Sirius held him tight. The thumping continuing.
Neville took the charm in hand, Harry’s in the other, and attached the charm, running the pads of his fingers over the blemish-free skin so gently, the hair on Harry’s arm raised. Neville lifted Harry’s hand to his face kissing the back of it, lips lingering. Electricity passing between them.
Godric stepped from around Sal, trying to mimic his mate's gentle tones, “We have actually met before, though you won’t recognize this form. You would know me better as Fawkes,” Godric spat out the name, obviously disgusted.
“Moony, how are you? Have you heard from Padfoot? I want you to meet the Claremores… they saved me… and… they adopted me.” Harry had started off excited but soon he was obviously worried. Ears laying flat against his head and tail curling up between his legs as if trying to protect his belly from possible attack.
Harry took the open space between Remus and Sirius, looking around one last time before the stillness ended.
“Please, Father, remove the evil man’s bindings from me, I am dying!” She screamed and went silent, the bindings strangling her voice.
When Godric presented him with the renovated potions lab with a connected library that Godric made him just for him, Salazar had squealed. His smile wide and cheeks bright before knocking him down and ripping his robes open to take him down his throat in one swift movement. Buttons flying everywhere and Godric dizzy with the sudden change in altitude.
Remus had shakingly offered it to Harry, but by the worn-edges and place so close to Remus’ heart Harry knew this photo wasn’t for him. Even if he wanted it desperately. When he told Remus to keep it, the man had almost burst into tears of relief and that was when Harry knew it was the right thing to do.
But until then they couldn’t move him. The spell Godric used couldn’t work miracles and if moved Dumbledore would wake.
“Come now, my boy, I am sure we-” Dumbledore’s thin voice was cut off by Percival’s much more commanding one.
While Anna and Lyle did their checks, Harry read the short letter. Once he finished, he looked over at David, knowing if anyone had the answers, it would be his Dad. “Who is G. G., and what is The Elder Wand?”
Harry relaxed some, relieved that he was wrong about Neville’s laughter, but also curious now why his friend wasn’t as shocked by the toilet as Harry was. Neville continued to speak, “This toilet has a feature called a Bidet, you might have heard of it before…” Harry shook his head but when he realized Neville’s gaze was still locked on the ceiling Harry told him that he had never before heard of it. “Okay, well, a Bidet, it… It washes your- ummm- bits after you have used the restroom and then dries you off. It is very common in Creature homes to help keep their tails clean, but most purebloods also have them.”
At the insistence of Albus Dumbledore, we switched Secret Keepers from Sirius Orion Black to Peter Anthony Pettigrew with Albus as our binder. If something goes very wrong, I know everyone will suspect Sirius, this, however, isn’t true. I have signed this statement below with a Gringotts official blood quill.
“Yes,” Lyle answered, ruffling Harry’s hair with a soft smile on his face.
Severus had no plans of doing what the man commanded, he would force his shadow self to mess up potions, every once and a while throwing Dumbledore a bone when it seemed like the man might finally snap and kill him. But only small things like cutting out a step of a well-known potion.
Severus took in a heaving breath, reaching up to caress the line of his collar bone fingers resting momentarily in the hollow of his throat, counting the beats of his racing heart before trailing down his chest, nails scratching against lightly hairy skin, something he hadn't had the last time he had full control of his body.
They kept their conversation light as they all sat tensely, Molly interrupting their talks, scolding them all in turns without even walking into the room. And even though Arthur had made plenty of food for all of them Molly was in the kitchen cooking, and she was outraged when they said no to more food. Coming into the living room to scream at them for not appreciating all her hard work. Arthur shooed the boys up to their room so they didn’t have to listen to their Mother’s screeching. An owl swooped through the kitchen window, dropping its burden right atop Molly’s head.
He nodded, knowing that if he were in the Draken’s position, he would ask for the same. A screech broke into their conversation, and he looked over, spotting the snow owl he had gotten to know. “Hello, Mistress Hedwig, I also promise you I shall take care of your human.” He gave her a small bow, knowing that the sign of respect would go a long way in earning her trust. Harry probably didn’t know what Hedwig was his familiar and would live as long as he did, so the Phoenix wanted to make sure she liked him.
annnnndddd heres another.....
Signed,
Arthur’s knees buckled and it was only a strong set of hands gently setting him into his seat that kept him from falling to the floor. Soon a voice Arthur knew all too well was speaking up. His little boy was here. Arthur looked up to see the furious face of Bill glaring at the woman sitting across from them. “Are my Fathers still alive?” Bill interrogated, expression like a freshly sharpened dagger.
Issy hugged the much larger man goodbye, whispering for his ears only, “If you hurt my child no one will find your body.” Her smile was innocent, and Godric was thankful that she and Helga never met. The destruction they would have rained down on the world was unimaginable.
Lyle’s grin grew wider, which seemed impossible, his arm wrapped tightly around Harry’s shoulders. “Yes! Siles, let me introduce you to Harry Potter, my clan’s adoptive son.” Harry squirmed uneasily under Siles’ attention, he didn’t know why, but the other man made his tummy flutter.
He stood there for three minutes, warm hand pressed to cool canvas. Finally, a head of wild curly blonde hair peeked out of the edge of the painting. Helga… She was so beautiful, looking like she did the day the school first open, eyes going wide in shock before she ran out to the middle of the painting, screaming in excitement. “Godric!?” She reached out as if to hug him before realizing that he was out of her reach.
They were lost in their own world, unable to see how his break down was affecting the others. Augusta clutched a delicate flower teacup in her hand, fingers curled so tight that if the porcelain hadn't been reinforced it would have surely shattered at her touch. David and Lyle looked on anxiously, both wanting to do something but knowing they weren’t wanted at this moment. Anna was contemplating handing over a calming draught but believed that this would happen sooner or later and it might as well be now.
The other man hid his face in long wild red hair, "Never to be parted again… Did you… Did you find them? Salazar hesitantly asked it had always been a sore subject between them. They both knew there would eventually come a time when there would have to be someone else. It was just in Godric’s nature. Phoenix’s had one true mate. That in no way meant they couldn’t find love outside of that, that they couldn’t marry and bond with others. But they would only return to their human form with the meeting of that one person.
“As soon as I received the letters from the bank about the charges, I was surprised and took actions to find out the truth. What we learned was shocking, to say the least.” All the others looked sour at the reminder of what they had discovered.
He leaned into Neville’s muscular arm, allowing his head to rest against the broad shoulder next to him. The warmth of the sun and body next to him along with the feeling of fullness started to lull him to sleep.
By then they were running out of time, so all they could do was quickly portkey all the prisoners to the Gryffindor manor. The few House-Elf still living in the manor were happy to have fresh magic beyond just that of the ley lines and wards and were fast to help get everyone settled. When the Gryffindor clan was large, the manor had been used in times of emergency, a fortress against all that might stand against them. There was plenty of space in the healing ward for all thirty-six prisoners to rest, but the equipment and potions stored there were terribly out of date.
Fred and George jumped forward, both furious and confused. “What do you mean you are going to be Lady Potter?” They spoke as one, not even a millisecond behind each other. The only reason their Brothers could tell them apart was that Fred, who they had always called Fiery Fred, was looking much more furious than George, who they had nicknamed Gentle George. Though George looked enraged himself, just a hint more confused.
Harry brought this up to his family, everyone looking contemplative.
They pulled him into their sides, squishing Harry between their larger bodies. “Of course, Harry.”
Of course, Lady Magic takes into account the reasons for breaking an Oath that is outside of one’s control. And if someone purposefully forces another to break their Oath in hopes of the Oath giver losing something Lady Magic will punish the ones responsible.” David finished his speech.
Neville looked down sharply at him, examining every inch of Harry’s body, looking for injury, until he once again saw Harry’s naked thighs gaze forcibly redirected to the ceiling once more. “What- I mean- How did it attack you, are you alright?” Neville asked voice still riddled with worry, though now it held a note of something that Harry didn’t recognize, it made the other boy’s voice deeper than normal.
Before Bartok could ask what they meant, their Father gave a great heaving sigh and spoke, grief obvious in every line of his body. “What my sons mean, is that Molly, Ginny, and Ron have all been disowned and stripped of every tie they held to the Weasley name.”
Dumbledore flinched back at her barb but had the presence of mind to stop Molly, who was building up to a rant with just one look.
Harry listened to the two brothers talk for about an hour, mostly just enjoying the tight hold his Daddy had on him and the comfort of his blanket and teddy. They discussed the Courts, Siles workshop, and his schooling. He learned that the man was attending the Arthur Technical Institute for a degree in Business Management. They also talked about their other siblings and what was going on in their lives.
Harry blushed again and walked out of the toilet room, going to stand in front of the sink. Every step he took shooting small sparks up his spine his tail wagging behind him like a dog who had just heard the word ‘
Harry couldn’t wait for the day when such things didn’t make him want to cry, but for now, he had to handle that this was his state of mind. Take this time to think over his whole life and deal with the emotions he had long suppressed. Luckily Harry now had a caring family who was willing to give him this time. Who were strong while he was so weak.
Harry immediately jumped up, rushing towards the oncoming dog. Padfoot bowled him over, and they both landed on the ground, Harry laughing while Sirius licked his cheeks, tail wagging and whining.
Harry was so focused on staring over the grounds that he missed when Tiptop brought in breakfast and sat down. He only noticed it when the scent of bacon filled the air and Hedwig came zooming in through the open window, landing right in front of the plate of her favorite snack. She shamelessly started munching on the bacon, ignoring Tiptop’s glare. Harry, however, smile fondly at his friend, reaching out to pet down her back.
It took a few moments as Godric guided Salazar’s magic until the bond was formed. Godric’s bond developed over many years, slowly wiggling its way into his core but it settled. With Salazar, the bonding was a sharp shock of magic, causing him to jump and gasp in fright. But the smile soon grew, expression full of peace as a tear rolled down Salazar’s cheek. “Oh Godric, she, she is beautiful.” He, of course, was talking about the feel of her magic, no matter how much taint Dumbledore stained her with or how weak she was, they could both still feel her.
“Me…” Harry replied, tears forming in his eyes as he looked up at them. Devastated.
Neville was devastated, and he took it into his own hands to do all he could for Harry when they were together. He had unlikely partners in crime with the twins. They had seen him trying to slip a general healing potion into Harry’s goblet during their first breakfast back. Their intense blue eyes pierced him and stilled his hand, they were soon manhandling him off to an empty classroom.
The screamed that ripped its way through his body was soul deep, the birds nesting in nearby trees fleeing in alarm. Albus dropped to his knees, mind furiously going through all possible circumstances that would cause this, but he came up with nothing. There was no way this could have happened, but somehow it had.
Charlie had always worried about the two. While they were family, and he loved them dearly, their close bond set them apart in some ways. And no matter how they hid it there had always been a loneliness to them. Charlie had honestly been a bit jealous to see how easily this young boy made his little brothers light up. Both because he wished he could have been that person for Fred and George and because he wanted a love that easy and innocent.
Their relationship was forged amid battle and was as strong as the Dwarven silver that made up their blades. They were madly in love, and Godric couldn’t imagine a life without Salazar at his side. Godric just hoped that one day Salazar could find his place in their family to come. So much had changed since Salazar went to sleep. Sal had only been slightly okay with the thought of one other person being part of their relationship, he didn’t know how the man would handle more.
Now that she had access to her full core size, they could open the tap to the ley line. They only opened it the slightest bit, not wanting to flood her body. The small trickle already had the young girl relaxing further into the bed.
Harry finally looked up to meet Siles eyes again and was shocked by the concern he saw so blatantly displayed there. Harry could tell that the man wanted to comment on his size, but thankfully he didn’t
Harry opened it just as gently as the others, paper coming away whole, revealing a beautiful hand-knitted green sweater. It was the softest thing Harry had ever felt, and he was putting it on as fast as he could.
When they first visited the bank by the point they got to the Heirships, Harry had already been too overwhelmed to even listen to what the houses were so this was a shock to him. When Helix announced the first ring was the Black ring, he was shocked.
“It is nice to see you all again, and to meet you, Mr. Potter,” Percival said, voice gravelly, as he bowed deeply.
Anna looked up from her paperwork to watch both of them, Issy’s face was still hard, judging Godric’s truthfulness. Anna reached over and gently slapped Issy’s arm, “Issy, love, he’s telling the truth.”
Bartok loved these quiet moments where he could just study his family’s faces. Even Anna, from where she sat going over the medical scan she had taken of Harry when she first woke, looked peaceful.
Bartok lifted the bracelet from its box. “This crest,” he indicated as he raised one with a sword and stage with an unknown gemstone hanging from it, “Is the Potter family crest, the family gemstone is a Fire Agate. You, of course, recognize the Ravenclaw crest. This one here, with the thestral and tome, is the Peverell crest, with its opal. Lastly, this is the Le Fey Crest, with its dual swords striking through a man with the family stone being an emerald.”
For the first time that day her features loosened with a small pleased smile as she shooed him off, waiting until he apparated away before marching her way back up to the school.
Sirius reassured his pup softly that nothing bad would happen if he explored his body. Remus was much more careful now that he knew Harry had such a dysfunctional relationship with his own body. Remus gently explained that there were spells to clean your bottom if he wished to explore anal stimulation. When Harry questioned why anyone would do that, Sirius cautiously explained that some people, including himself and Remus, really enjoyed it. And that it was part of one of the main acts of sex between gay men. They were also careful to make sure Harry knew that if he didn’t like it, he didn’t have to participate in that act and that there were many other ways to achieve pleasure alone or with partners.
“He’s going to get Mr. Black and bring him here. We will wait until they get back to start our discussions.” Bartok called for Tiptop, the House-Elf popping in with a full tea service. She was in her best dress, Claremore crest over her breast.
Issy was sitting cross-legged in her rich wooden chair, a smile splitting her face in two and her mid-length wavy white hair which shimmed blue when she turned, blew in an invisible wind. Her skin fresh honey-colored skin and vibrant blue eyes welcoming like a warm hug. She looked very young, but her eyes were motherly. Tears started to well in her eyes as soon as she saw him, though Harry wasn’t sure why.
Another owl came swooping through the window, dropping another letter atop his head. The parchment slid down into his lap. He opened it up hollowly, brain short-circuited.
Fudge, my Guardianship will remain with
“Sorry, Dad, I was just… Inspecting my tail,” Harry reluctantly let go of his tail and got dressed. As soon as he was finished, soft fabric hugging him and sweater covering most of his hands, Harry gathered the new appendage to his chest, cheek pressed into the tip. “I’m done now.”
“And what will you both be doing about getting that evil man out of our castle?” Rowena’s eyes went sharp, her brilliant mind obviously already planning five steps ahead.
I leave to Lily Rose Potter nee Evans of Godric’s Hollow, England, if she shall survive me, the bulk of my estate with the exception of my other bequests. In the case, she is unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Sirius Orion Black of London, England, for Hadrian James Potter of Godric’s Hollow, England. My dear Lily flower, I am sorry I have left you early, but you will forever be in my heart. Know that I love you and Harry dearly and that I wish I could be there to see our son grow into the good man I know he will be and watch as our hairs turn white together. I have left letters in the main vault for you and Harry for each birthday. Please wake my portrait when it is safe for you to.
Harry allowed himself to be guided through the rest of the house, taking in everything he could while not allowing it to overwhelm him. Soon they were back in the breakfast room, an obvious favorite over the other dining rooms for its magnificent view. They elected to eat lunch a little before noon since they wanted to get to the bank early.  After their lunch of sandwiches and soup, they sat around waiting for Percival to arrive.
.” Harry just wanted them to leave so he could be with his family.
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
Next, to Albus Dumbledore, I once again request you leave my family alone. Now that I have passed there is no use asking for Lily to give you access to our vaults or the Potter Wizengamot seats. We have withdrawn from the war.
He wished that he could go to his mate the moment he arrived, but he knew if he did Dumbledore would realize what was going on, so he had to keep his distance. All he could do was soar around the grounds when his mate was outside, going to every Quidditch match and practice. He almost broke into the matches twice when Harry was at risk of dying, but before he could, Harry was once again safe. He swore those times had taken at least twenty years off his life each.
And now, almost twenty years after Bartok finished his Mastery, they still got together at least every other week. Even if it was just a quick lunch together at one of the cafes outside of The Council of Terradore’s main buildings. They always made the time. At least until the last two weeks, all Bartok had time for were a few letters and a short floo call, but Percival was more than understanding and was happy that his friend was now a father.
Bartok apparated them to his favorite cafe near the bank so that they could have breakfast together. Harry, while still tired, was very talkative asking about Bartok’s plans for the day.
Severus nodded, keeping his eyes trained on her as he opened the door to his chambers. Minerva marched her way in, calling an unknown pair of House-Elves to start packing Severus’ belongings. Minerva instructed the two Elves to allow Severus to pack his own potion lab.
“Next the will of Lily Potter will be read, please continue to remain silent.” Helix opened the second scroll, a musical voice filling the room. Harry didn’t know what he expected but it hadn’t been the deep rich tone his Mother had. The basics of her will were the same, except for her message to her husband.
David watched this intently, trying to figure out what was happening. “Harry, have you not completed the bond?”
While Bartok was working on calming Harry, David was doing the same with Issy. Anna and Lyle inspected the black box that had fallen to the floor. Inside the box was a rolled up piece of parchment, after check it for spells Lyle opened it, the usual hint of mischief completely missing from his gaze.
I appoint my spouse, Lily Rose Potter nee Evans, as the sole Executor of this Will, but if my spouse should predecease me, or should refuse or be unable to act or continue to act as my Executor, then I appoint Sirius Orion Black of London, England to be the sole Executor of this Will in the place of my spouse.
Now that she had Albus backed into a corner, Anna took this chance to calm herself, to seem like the more mature one in the situation. To pounce on the moment of weakness he was showing. “Mr. Dumbledore, if you did not have the time to take care of a child directly under your care maybe you should have considered either not making yourself his Magical Guardian or dropping one or two of your positions. If you missed something so big pertaining to a child you were tasked with protecting, how many other abused children at Hogwarts have gone undiscovered?”
And while he would love to think her attention was captured by the sight of him at seven, dirty and working in the garden. But he knew it was just wishful thinking, even before the addition of such memories she had always spent her every waking moment looking out the window.
