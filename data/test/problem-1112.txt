“Shut up, arsehole,” Harry laughed. He felt warm inside. Different from the afterburn of firewhiskey in his stomach, or the swelter of the heat wave. “I’m just saying, if everything that happened, hadn’t - like, if Voldemort had never been born, or drowned in a cave as an evil little bastard kid-” Malfoy snorted. “I think we could have been friends. You annoyed me,” Harry grinned. “But you were always a funny little prick, and obviously we still would have belted the shit out of each other on the pitch.”
Harry gulped his drink. He wasn’t sexy. He wore cardigans and lab coats, and frumpy old pants with snitches on them. Who in their right mind would find that sexy?
Harry smiled against his mouth. Breakfast was his favorite part of the day, and it was nine-tenths because he shared it with Draco.
“Really, Draco? You don't think after the last eight months, I might have a few feelings about us? About you?”
Potter had not spotted Draco yet; he was busily tipping his head back, presumably savouring the final drops of what was most certainly tea from his upturned paper cup. Draco considered ducking into the nearest office, cupboard, or quite frankly behind a potted plant, and hiding. But that was absurd. Really, what was the worst that could happen? Potter could apologise for being drunk and flirty, and they would both laugh it off and forget about it. Well, Draco wouldn’t really forget about it, but at least the wild fantasy that there might be something there between them could be put to bed. So to speak. He would do his best to be casual, and dismissive, as if it was not a big deal at all, and things like that happened to Draco all the time. He could totally maintain his dignity.
Harry was not what anyone would describe as fashion conscious. Or naturally blessed with any sort of style. Hermione was largely responsible for anything to do with Harry’s clothing, including the system of fitted wardrobes she’d convinced him to install about five years earlier. They had been disgustingly expensive, but even Harry’d had to admit, kind of amazing. All he had to do was toss his clean items onto the floor of the wardrobe, and magic took care of the rest - steaming and pressing, hanging, organising. The
“You just said fuck in front of the baby, too.” He elbows her back, but she somehow manages to deflect him, and instead he just smashes his elbow into
Draco was laughing as he set the glass down on the bedside table, then moved it with a groan onto the coaster Harry had put there for that very purpose, before Harry could do more than pull a face in complaint. “And you’re my average looking barbarian who cannot abide water rings on furniture.” Draco curled one long finger around a thicket of Harry’s hair, then pushed both hands into the mess. Harry couldn’t help a little grunt of appreciation. Draco had strong fingers, but was so gentle, and Harry had a very sensitive scalp, so really it was a match made in heaven, with or without the constant insults.
“The rest is easy. Marry my best friend, Mr Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Boy Who Lived, et cetera, because people already think we’re a throuple, so why not make it official. And kill - myself, obviously, as I’ll have recently got off with Anders, and between the flashbacks and my wife, I’ll be better off dead.” Ron took a swig of his beer and looked very proud of himself. “Now, are we going clockwise, or playing by Weasley rules?”
There were no defensive wards around the barn, only a series of environmental spells, warming charms, wind blockers, rain shields and the like. It took no effort for Draco to slip through a gap in several rotten planks, and quietly round a large bale of hay. Owls were everywhere, on every beam and turret, watching them silently as they softly approached the only other human occupant, who was sitting in a pile of straw in the middle of the barn, looking up at the owls above her.
“This is the King Dong,” Malfoy said, ever so calmly, while Harry’s eyebrows made a break for his hairline. “Go ahead and touch it.” Harry looked at Malfoy, alarmed, and Malfoy gave him another of those slow smiles. “Feel the difference in temperature.”
Someone was knocking on his door. Draco was hard pressed to think of how things could get any worse, as he levered himself out of the bath and into a towel, and stomped, dripping and almost nude, to answer the door.
There was comfort in his weekly routine, everything planned out just so. Comfort even in his uniform of business shirts, bland ties, and boring novelty pants. He liked the security of a normal, average life. He never had to plan a social calendar or even an outfit. He revelled in the humdrum; going to the toilet whenever he felt like, which had been a luxury in the years before Hogwarts, and having the freedom to leave the door open when he was in there if he liked, and the seat up without anybody complaining. He could wander around the house in just his pants, or less, back and forth from his bedroom to the bathroom blissfully nude, and he took as much time as he wanted in the shower without any Weasley’s banging on the door telling him to hurry up because it was their turn, or dorm mates accusing him of having a wank. And if he
“Kiss him!” Ron’s voice bellowed, and there was a racket of whistles and catcalls from the kitchen, where everyone was watching, Hermione, Ron and Ginny in particular, jammed together in the open kitchen doorway.
He was bare chested, and up to his hips in the water, glowing blue waves breaking gently around him. There’d been tourists on the shore earlier, but a few well placed charms had taken care of that, and now he was free to collect his samples, his wand refreshing the Warming charm wrapped tight to his skin like a wetsuit. He was thinking about the last time they’d been together. Always at Potter’s house. His bed was never made, but the sheets were soft and clean, and smelled of Harry, and Draco smelled of Harry later as well, and it was an effort sometimes to push himself through the shower, and wash it off.
They packed their kit, Draco dried himself as best he could and dragged on the rest of his clothes. Longbottom was still fucking around with the phone by the time he’d finished, and it pinged several times in rapid succession.
Harry was dancing on the balls of his feet by the time the Floo roared to life, and Draco hopped through. “Finally.”
“I suppose I must have, once or twice.” He put down his biro - possibly his favourite of all Muggle inventions - and stretched, flexing his shoulders until he felt them pop. “What are you still doing here?”
Malfoy knocked his shoulder against Harry’s, and signalled to the bartender for two more of the same. “You sure?” He tilted his head and looked at Harry. “You’ve been quiet. And you seemed like you couldn’t get away from us fast enough just before.”
There was a knock at Draco’s office door. Marjorie Pierce stuck her head in, an odd expression on her face.
!” Potter said with exasperation. “I can’t go back in time and change that! I could, however, have altered my approach if you’d only mentioned something earlier, Malfoy. Why didn’t you just call a meeting with me to discuss it? I’ve been working here for six months and you’ve never said a word about it.”
Bujalski had got pork scratchings for the table, which Harry didn’t really like, but he was hungry, and was trying to be polite, and he was also stuck in the back corner of their banquette and couldn’t get out easily to go and find some crisps. He supposed he could Apparate, but that seemed a bit drastic, so he nibbled the edge of one of the sharp and salty curls, and tried not to look like he was literally starving to death.
“No,” Potter hummed, cutting in front of him and opening IR7 without wand nor apparently the proper access charms, which was absolutely infuriating. Fucking Unspeakables. “What about your pants?”
The less they looked like Potter, the more alcohol Draco generally needed to reach an acceptable level of satisfaction. He’d try nearly anyone with that diabolical combination of dark hair, light eyes, and glasses. He wasn’t fussy - well, he
Draco hadn’t stopped urging Potter on, and finally Potter replaced his fingers with his prick again, pressing against Draco like a delicious threat. With a low hiss, Potter pushed in, and Draco actually laughed, a stuttering, breathy noise.
I don’t want to talk about or to Potter if I can reasonably help it. Did he do something? No. He did nothing, absolutely nothing, and that’s basically the issue. If his ego’s bruised from his first taste of rejection, then I guess he’ll just have to suck it up. It wasn’t meant to last, anyway.” He stared angrily across the stands at the top of Potter’s head. “So now it’s done, and we’ll both make nice at work and in front of Teddy, and he can move on to his perfect match. That enough for you, Rita?”
“No,” Harry said sullenly, splashing more broth in. If Hannah took offense at not being invited, he would bloody well
? Surely you know the answer to that, Potter. There's no point asking questions we already know the answers to."
“Shhh,” Harry kissed him firmly again. “Crying is healthy. It releases oxytocin, which is a chemical in your brain that can make you feel better.” He brushed his fingers through Teddy’s fringe, which flickered a warm pinky-purple in answer. “Hermione told me that, so it must be true, because she’s the cleverest person I ever met.”
, so Harry should be able to do the same. Malfoy hadn’t noticed, as he was tapping the next phone number into his mobile.
“I don’t need a nanny, Potter,” Draco said with annoyance. “Perfectly capable of giving an update on my own.”
"Yeah," Potter's lips twisted into a sort of smile. "I didn't get a chance last night…I think by the time I got over the shock, you were already up in your room."
Pansy’s eyes glittered, and she licked the rim of her glass in a way that had Harry looking anywhere else. Ginny smirked and pushed a heavy fall of long hair over her shoulder. “Harry, babe, you look smashing. Been at the gym?” Draco materialised as if Summoned. “Malfoy.”
The door to the lab burst open and Harry looked up, startled, to find Devlin in the doorway holding an enormous branch from what looked like some sort of flowering bush. Harry pushed his glasses back up his nose, from where they had slowly slid down to hang precariously from the tip. The branch, and Devlin, came back into focus, and Harry realised that what had at first appeared to be flowers were actually large, semi-opaque rubber cocks.
He shrugged. “It’s only Malfoy, Harry. I’d have had a few things to say about it if you’d told us you’re going to live as a hermit in the Forbidden Forest to try and seduce a centaur. Shagging Malfoy is probably one of the least alarming things you could’ve done, in the scheme of things.”
Ron frowned at them. “You’re not going to be humping each other all over the flat, are you? That’s not good housemate etiquette.”
The scar in the middle of his chest was something Harry normally tried to avoid thinking of, let alone looking at, but tonight it didn’t make him feel like a freak. It was just a scar, after all. It’s not too bad, in the scheme of things - he hadn’t lost an ear, or worse. A Muggle might ask, someone from their world might know what had caused it and be frightened, or turned off, or fascinated, and Harry never liked the thought of that very much. But someone like Malfoy. Malfoy might run his fingers over it. Malfoy might kiss it. But he didn’t think Malfoy would let it come between them. Malfoy had scars too, ones Harry had given him, and others from the war, maybe some you couldn’t see or touch. Malfoy would understand. Malfoy would want him anyway and it wouldn’t be just because he was the famous Harry Potter. Wouldn’t he?
Harry looked at Malfoy, who looked back, utterly unfazed. “How fortunate that he saw someone he knew. Almost like magic.”
A small bell jingled above the door on the way in. Harry was struck immediately by how...well, how little it looked like he expected a sex shop would. It was bright, for a start, a very clean, sterile white sort of lighting, and there was some kind of nondescript music piping softly through the place, the kind you might expect to hear in a suburban Tesco. Actually, the whole effect was very much like a supermarket; a faint scent of bleach, bright white tiled floors and walls, and neat aisles filled with all manner of toys.
“You look nice,” Potter said, and Draco reached out and snatched a fresh glass of champagne from a passing waiter, deliberately breaking contact between his shoulder and Potter’s chest. Potter moved to stand beside Draco instead, to his great relief, and sipped from a short, square tumbler of amber liquid. Champagne was Draco’s preferred poison, but whisky and Potter were a disturbingly attractive combination.
Potter swore forcefully, and gripped Draco’s hip. “Don’t say things like that, or I’ll come on the backs of your legs before we even get started!”
“Of course you do,” Harry said fondly, watching the last of the cartons of quidditch kit float through the Floo into Draco’s small suite of rooms at the castle. “Am I getting a list, or do I have to pay attention?”
“The Longbottoms, Luna and Rolf and the kids, the Patils and whoever they’re dating this week, Nick, Gaetano and Liz from Potions Division, Jules from Creatures, Sara-with-an-A and Sarah-with-an-H, Rhys, Justin Finch-Fletchley, but only because I want to get him on the donor list for another two charities, and Rahim, who has recently split up with Seb, FYI, so don’t mention his name if you know what’s good for you. Minerva, even though she might be a bit old for a boozy night out.” Harry thought that was underestimating his boss quite a bit. Draco cracked his knuckles loudly and smoothed down the page again. “Now, additions? Further objections?”
Draco looked out across the amphitheatre, crowded with every witch or wizard with any kind of influence in the whole United Kingdom, and some from abroad. An elderly, white-haired witch sat in the middle of the Wizengamot, engulfed by a deep purple robe of crushed velvet, appearing, at first, old and frail. Upon closer examination, her spine stood ramrod straight; her dark eyes almost black, glittering with satisfaction, and the self possession of one who held a great deal of power. It had been she who had pushed for Draco's initial sentencing, who had insisted that the parents of Hogwarts children deserved to have justice for the danger their children had been put in the night that Draco had let in the Death Eaters, and Greyback. She'd been the one to suggest the specific mode of his punishment - five years as gamekeeper at Hogwarts, no magic allowed unless handling magical creatures or in the event of a life-threatening situation. Alma Fivepennies, his prosecutor. Harry Potter was appointed to supervise, and report to the Ministry weekly on Draco's performance. And somehow, today, she had been the one to insist that Draco deserved to be released - six months served, exemplary behaviour. The glowing character reference from Harry, and a few words from Granger. He couldn't lose, with those odds. And he had not. He was free.
Draco made a noise of annoyance. “Why have you fixated on that? It was just a passing comment from Longbottom, that’s all. Pureblood families have a lot of custom and ceremony when it comes to finding a partner, but I’m not taking part in any of it!”
well that ends well, eh?” Weasley looked so pleased with himself, that Draco only shook his head, rather than say any of the snide remarks he would otherwise have liked to. “Come on, that was pretty good!”
A queue snaked its way down the street, kept in formation by a velvet rope strung between regularly spaced brass bollards. Harry wondered how these Muggles could stand to line up in the cold like that, especially the girls, who seemed rather under-dressed for standing outdoors on a cool mid-September evening. Harry was glad of his leather jacket, as a puff of cold wind ruffled the sweaty hair at the nape of his neck.
“Yep,” Potter gestured for Draco to alight the lift first. “If we’re lucky, that wind will be something, and if not, we can rule that out and look through the rest after.”
The thing was, really, that Harry couldn’t work out which would be more awkward; being seen entering a Knockturn Alley sex shop, or seeing someone he knew from the Ministry actually inside the sex shop. “Or being caught loitering in the doorway of said sex shop,” Harry muttered under his breath. “Grow a pair, Potter, you used to be an Auror for fuck’s sake.”
- and began to spend longer periods at Grimmauld with Harry, he’d nosed around the various floors and sleeping quarters, which at the time, were merely a bit musty and old fashioned. At that point, it was all Harry’s clutter in the attic, but when Draco had moved in and warned he had lots of stuff that would need storing, Harry hurriedly got all his hoard out and shoved it in various bedrooms, and planned to sort it all out for once and for all. Draco hadn’t really bothered to look in any of those shut up rooms again, so he wasn’t really aware of the state of them. Meanwhile, the clutter had grown a bit. A lot. And nothing had been sorted at all.
having a wank, which he often did, he could do that too for as long or as little as he felt like, and he didn't have to hold in any noises either which was quite an extravagance after so many years of sharing dorms and bedrooms, and tents.
He shouldn’t be awake. It wasn’t part of the itinerary. At 7.45am today he was scheduled to be asleep, and to remain so for several hours yet, sleeping off a champagne hangover from last night at Pansy’s (tick), before a light breakfast (fruit, a pastry, and a latte, ready and under stasis in his kitchen), a soak (no longer than ninety minutes in duration, coconut oil, organic goat milk, and a sprinkling of rose petals), and an international Portkey (precisely 2pm) to a Greek resort where he would linger, marinating in coconut-scented suntan oil, for two glorious weeks.
“Pegging, probably,” Malfoy said calmly. “The woman will wear the harness, and the dildo will be strapped into the holster at the front. She’ll use it to penetrate his-”
There was a pause. "Potter, are you calling to tell me you plan on using this thing, on yourself? Because that sounds neither safe, nor like it’s any of my business-"
Malfoy was thrusting the dong in and out of Amy with a look concentration, and Harry imagined he could hear his Subconscious Hermione silently screaming that things were not going to be even remotely fine, at all. Malfoy flicked his hair out of his eyes with a quick jerk of his head, and caught the tip of his tongue between his lower lip and his teeth. Harry was mesmerised, his eyes drifting from Malfoy’s mouth, to his hands, to the dildo squelching in and out of the pussy.
It was 11.58pm, and he lay in bed, staring at the shadows, thinking about Malfoy, and waiting for his new year to begin.
“Thanks,” Ron grinned. “And you have a gift for acting like a fucking helmet.” He put his elbows on the table, and leaned forward. “Now, stop changing the pissing subject, and get back on what you’re going to do about the fact that you like him, and he likes you, and you both want to go out with each other?”
Theo looked unimpressed. “Why would this necessitate the urgent acquisition of a fucking Muggle mobile at fuck-thirty on a Sunday morning, exactly?”
“What are you talking about, Ron?” Harry tried to pull him back towards the Potions classroom, but Ron was a lot bigger than Harry, and just applied both large hands to Harry’s shoulders, and pushed him down the corridor. “He’s clearly up to something!”
“I think this week you should come out to a club with me, instead.” Malfoy settled back in his chair, and waited. Harry’s throat felt dry, and he took a huge mouthful of tea.
!” Harry shook his head with amazement. “Still in their boxes! And I was doing the Academy, and then I was an Auror, and I was so busy all the time, and I had so much space here, so I just closed the door and didn’t look unless I had to throw something else in.”
The outline of the door they had just entered through was still visible –  easy to find, despite the fact that it and the wall around it was now a sort of slightly green glass. And more surprising, he could see people – customers, he supposed, lots of them, milling up and down the aisles, mostly singly but some who were clearly couples. He could see a man and woman not far from the rear wall; she was holding what looked like a harness of some kind against her waist as if to test the fit, while her partner compared the length and girth of two rather intimidating dildos. “What...?”
"You let Death Eater's into the school. You let a werewolf, known to be dangerous, especially to children, into the school. It was a sanctuary, and you let them inside. Thousands of children could have died that day. Thankfully, only one person did. It was a mistake Malfoy. I know it was. And I know you've paid for it dearly. But the Ministry is making a point. They could have sent you to Azkaban for it. They could have had you Kissed. Instead, they chose a symbolic punishment, one that would satisfy the hundreds upon hundreds of parents who were calling for action."
Honeysuckle was heavy in the mild breeze, and Harry felt a restless beat of emotion rise in his chest; not one emotion, really, but several. Amusement. Affection. Gratitude. Other things, that he’d been trying his best to pretend weren’t there. Trying for a long while, actually.
“Right-handed, Potter?” Malfoy snapped on the gloves smoothly. “I’ll need your forefinger and middle finger.” Harry obediently held out his hand, and Malfoy took it in one of his, and squeezed a liberal quantity of lube onto his fingers. “Now - keep those fingers together, and firmly press them into the hole. Two or three pumps should do it.” Pushing his glasses up with his left hand, Harry determinedly positioned his fingers at Amy’s opening and slipped them in.
“Oh, I don’t know. Reckon there might be someone out at Sourton who wouldn’t mind being here instead just now.”
Givenchy didn’t deserve the rough handling Draco was currently giving his, in his hurry to cover himself up. “Didn’t I tell you to get fucked already?”
Weasley waved him off. “Dont worry about it, I know how much of a bitch you can be when you’re hungover. You should have answered your phone, though, or I wouldn’t have had to sic Bog on you.”
Draco sneered. “Catching up at last, are we? Potter, this is precisely why your presence on this team fills me with irritation. If
Draco looked at his aunt guiltily, and then away again before her shrewd eyes picked up anything he didn’t want her to know. “Uncle Harry is the boss in a different area. We’re both Aurors, but I’m in the Potions Division, remember?” Ted just looked at him, unhappily. “Uncle Harry and Uncle Ron will still be there, and all the Weasley’s. Mum will come too, and I’ll get her to wear the scarf, what do you think?”
It had been many years since he’d seen or really heard much of Malfoy, before meeting him at the shop. One evening spent molesting a sex doll together, and one spent half-drunk and leering at near-nude clubbers wasn’t really a foundation for much. They’d talked a bit, but Harry really didn’t
He was starting to laugh, as he dumped Harry on Draco’s side of the bed, and Harry winced and moaned in pain, and Ron pulled off his boots, then socks. “Yes, mate, you both love me very much, and think I’m hot, but not the hottest, and not the subject of any sexual fantasies.”
There was something in Draco’s tone that made Harry sit up properly and drop a kiss on his shoulder, then his collarbone, then several more on his throat. He didn’t want Draco to think that. Harry was bloody thrilled to be engaged, ecstatic to be getting married, completely in love with Draco in ways he couldn't have imagined loving
The dildo was half forgotten in Harry’s grip, until he thrust it at the whiteboard with an unsettling thwack. “Oh, erm - sorry. But yes, I think you’re right.” Harry moved the grey thread too. “So that leaves us with what looks like two other spells. I can’t say I’ve ever seen that one before,” Harry pointed to a thorny looking green strand.
Draco tasted, as always, like everything Harry wanted. There was nothing like the feeling of his hard cock under Harry’s fingers, between his lips, the chafe of his stubble against Draco’s soft inner thighs. Draco’s thighs, falling further apart and trembling the deeper Harry took him. The soft noises he made, little sips of air, curses, praise, declarations of love and occasionally violence if Harry wouldn’t
Harry always complained that conjured water never tasted as refreshing as the real thing, and Draco always complained about tap water and grimy pipes, and the horrible things that could be living within them. One of thousands of disagreements and compromises in their life together, that Harry sometimes marvelled over. Draco took several eager sips of water, with a little gasp of satisfaction, then knelt on the bed and handed Harry the glass.
“Get dressed, and come home with me. I’ll give you a back massage, sort out the last of that stiffness.”
Draco said Blaise would know what charity auctions would be coming up, that Harry could donate some of the more expensive, non-Muggle items to. He would be allowed to keep
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Mad bastard. You’re the only person I know who gets off on being insulted.” Malfoy grinned at him, and Harry knocked their glasses together.”Happy birthday, git. You should have told me.” Harry should have bloody known.
Harry snorted. “You can’t call him Hot Weasley! I’ll fuck up one day and call him that to his face, then we’ll be in a right mess.”
As it turned out, Potter had not been completely exaggerating when he claimed he was excellent at soliciting donations. It was quite something, actually, and Draco allowed Potter to guide him from group to group, the hand on his shoulder dropping by degrees until it was a hand on his waist. Draco tried to remain focused on the conversation, and not on the warm pressure of Potter’s palm, his thumb pressing ever so slightly into Draco’s hip every now and again.
Harry watched Shacklebolt’s back until he had left their offices entirely, then blew out a sharp breath, and called for Devlin. Within the hour his desk was clear, with the exception of a single red folder. Harry opened it with resignation, and began to flip through the reports within. According to the documentation, the bushes had continued to sprout new growth even after the originating dildo had been unearthed and removed to Harry’s lab. In fact, so far nothing had worked on them, and the Auror’s had tried almost everything in accordance with Throttlebottom’s requests, including poisoning them, burning them, and ripping them up by the roots. The growth rate was rapid, with an individual cock blossoming within twenty-four hours, and an entire bush regrown within three days.
He did, actually, not that he would admit it. Still a stubborn, proud arsehole, despite his best efforts. He turned slowly, flexing in the water. That fucking hurt, but the look on Potter’s face was worth it. “If you wanted an excuse to see me in my altogether, Potter, you need only have asked.”
Neville cut his hands through the water, and the blue surged like magic under his palms. “Gran’s starting to put the pressure on. She wants grandkids within the next two years, or else.”
“Oh, right,” Potter tapped the side of the pot with his wand, and steam began to pour from the spout. “I’ve knocked it off my desk a few times, it’s better off in there. The charm to keep the tea at the perfect temperature without stewing the leaves is actually kind of fiddly, a real pain in the arse to have to re-cast all the time.” Potter poured Draco a cup, then retrieved his own from beneath an assortment of balled up parchment. “So I take it postponing the Cup itself is out of the question?”
“I was trying to make a joke about your mouth, and my pickle, but you’re far too good at this, so I just said all my best swears in one go.”
“Yeah, because Ron will have hurt feelings that you haven’t deemed him the hottest one,” Draco said with a smirk. “He’s so jealous and possessive when it comes to you.”
Harry held aloft a thing that seemed just to be a bunch of metal squiggles. They’d been in the attic for around an hour.
Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s ear, his mouth wet. “Maybe you’ll have to give me a detention later.” Draco gasped, and his cock twitched unmistakeably. Harry raised an eyebrow and felt his own pulse racing. “
His shoulders slumped a little, and he nodded at Fivepennies again. This time she nodded back. Message received.
Harry flicked his nail against the ring pull on the can. “Don’t get excited. Ted had an accident, jumping off the roof to impress Victoire, and landed himself in Mungo’s with two broken arms and a concussion. Not to mention the teeth.”
“Right. He claims her recent memo to the department about remembering to empty the shredder was specifically directed at him, and caused him significant embarrassment in front of his peers, and he thinks we should discipline her. Julie, for her part, doesn’t even know who Bryce Gardner is.” Draco could not help laughing out loud by this point, and even Potter looked like he was starting to see the funny side. “My personal favourite though would have to be the request made by Mona Cordwell, whose favourite stapler was taken without her permission, and she wondered whether I might be able to call in a favour at the Auror Corps to see about getting it back.” Potter shook his head in bewilderment. “And those were just the highlights.”
make tea, which is a start, and I worked out how to make some juice by squeezing it myself. I've been practicing all week. And fruit salad, that's easy 'cause all you have to do is peel and slice really. I thought about eggs, but I figured more could go wrong there than go right, so I settled on toast instead. Those muggle contraptions make it hard not to fuck it up, once you work out the dials, and plugs. I wasted a bit of bread, but the birds don't seem to mind charcoaled toast…" His voice trailed off, and he gestured proudly to the kitchen table. "What do you think? Is it a good welcome home surprise?"
Hermione gave Ginny a hard look, before beaming at Harry again and placing a gentle hand on his wrist. “That’s lovely, Harry. It’s nice to go slowly. Ron and I went slowly.”
“Ah, no. Expensive though, goblin made. They were a housewarming gift from...” The last bit was mumbled. Harry narrowed his eyes.
“What did you have?” Harry interrupted. The best way to knock Malfoy off course was to interrupt him.
Harry grinned again, and Summoned the Liberty carry bags, and a small glass phial. “Way ahead of you, Malfoy.” Draco’s eyes widened.
Draco prepared for the Junior Quidditch round-robin tournament the way he prepared for most things these days. By getting blackout drunk the night before, chugging Hangover potion in the morning, and with the largest pair of sunglasses money could buy.
Harry lit one bedside lamp with a snap of his fingers, and the room slowly brightened with a golden glow. He didn’t want it to be too bright; it felt like that might somehow break the mood, the growing feeling of anticipation and urgency, a hot crawl in his belly and between his legs. It felt like the slow gathering of a storm that promised thunder. It’d been a long time since he’d felt like this. He wasn’t sure he ever had, not quite this way.
Harry stared at them. “Could we please get back to the bit where you started laying odds about me and Malfoy getting involved?”
“Get out, Agatha,” Draco said with exasperation. “I don’t understand how you can just mouth off to your direct senior as calm as you like, but then quake at the mere suggestion of Harry bloody Potter.”
Neither of them looked sure, but Slytherin’s didn’t cajole, at least not each other, and Draco moved across the crowd towards the rear exit. There was no fucking way he was passing by that bar, again. He caught sight of Pansy and Longbottom, the latter’s mouth shiny with what appeared to be cherry lip gloss, and they’d both seen him as well. They wore twin looks of concern, so Draco gave them his best smile, and then put his head down and pushed on.
Taking the file into the lab, he cast a spell to pin the crime scene photographs and the various reports to the cork board at the back of the room. Working quickly, he retrieved two cauldrons, one pewter and the other iron, and set both to heating with a little water in the bottom. Next came the racks of test tubes, and several beakers, and his potions tools, a handsome set of silver knives, tongs and tweezers which Hermione had given him at Christmas, and a tray of glass stirrers. When he could avoid it no longer, Harry grit his teeth and lifted the tarpaulin from atop the cutting Devlin had brought down on Friday, and the cocks rustled gently on their leafy limbs. There really was a quite disturbing sensation that each cock was watching him, each with their single, small eye at the head, and their constant beckoning motion. Pulling on a pair of gloves and frowning down at the nearest dick, he took hold of it, noticing again the warmth of it seeping through the glove, and gave it a sharp tug. It broke free of the branch like a piece of fruit. Harry placed it on a fresh safety mat in front of him, and gave it a few experimental prods before selecting a scalpel from his knife kit. Carefully, he sliced a thin sliver from the shaft, only about a half an inch in length and as thin as an onion skin, and transferred it carefully to one of the many test tubes.
Malfoy frowned. “I feel like I know this one as well, but-” Harry realised he was staring at Malfoy’s neck again, and gripping the dildo with enough force to cause the cock to bulge out either side of his fist. Malfoy shrugged, and quirked his lips in another half-smile at Harry. “I’m sure it’ll come to me. No doubt in the middle of the night.” His smile widened slightly, and Malfoy’s eyes swept quickly up and down the length of Harry once again. It was doing weird things to Harry’s insides. “I’ll call the moment it does.”
Potter came closer, and reached for Draco’s hand, pulling him to his chest. “I learned from very early on that ‘not angry, disappointed’ was code for ‘really fucking angry’. Actually, Hermione’s best spells were perfected while she was disappointed in Ron. Sometimes I think the War might have gone on a bit longer if Ron had been
That was actually pretty funny, and Harry was too sleep-drunk not to laugh. Malfoy seemed to preen a little, before he remembered he was cranky.
with him. Somewhere in his rational brain, Harry was starting to process the things that had been going on with him, going on since he’d walked into Malfoy’s sex shop yesterday. He definitely found Malfoy attractive, and there was no use trying to bury that away - his body was simply not cooperating with the plan. He had been alternating with hot flushes and goosebumps, he was virtually having
“I have to admit I wasn’t totally honest about the favour, Harry. I wonder if you’d mind very much if I stayed here tonight.”
“Going to write about it in your journal, are you? ‘Dear diary, this morning I woke up and Draco was already sucking me off. He rode me like I was a pony. Draco is so handsome and clever. I’m the luckiest boy in the world. Love, Spexy xoxo’.”
“Everything was written all over it. This is serious. Way past casual. How have you kept this from us for so long?” Theo shook his head in amazement. “I can’t believe you’ve been shagging hot Potter for half a year, and fell in love with him and everything, and you managed to keep it a secret!”
Grimmauld Place was still Unplottable, but Draco knew the secret. He was allowed past the wards, the Floo unlocked for him and a select few. When he came through around ten minutes behind, he expected Potter to be on him instantly, but the parlour was empty. Draco followed the faint sound of movement downstairs to the basement kitchen, a room he’d rarely been into.
“What?” Oldmeadow tried to take a chip from Harry’s bowl, and was repelled with a hex. Malfoy must have charmed the bowl just for Harry. Ron’s face was insufferably gleeful. Harry was headed rapidly for a heart attack.
- the fundamental you.” Malfoy sipped his mead. “You’re exceptionally capable, Potter. Talented. Think about how easy flying was for you, how easily you picked up Quidditch. You mastered defensive magic literally years before it was on the curriculum and from what I’ve heard, that was just the start. But don’t forget that you were a bit shit at other things.”
“Yeah,” he said again, and flashed Malfoy a smile, and hoped his current weirdness would be indistinguishable from his usual weirdness. “Let’s get the rest of the rabble, and make some bad choices tonight.”
“Parkinson,” Harry nodded, but she seemed distracted, casting her eyes around the room. She was drinking something electric pink and glittery.
Blaise had given him quite a bit of advice about the proper composition of a nude portrait. Draco drew the curtains in his bedroom, then blocked out the remaining window-light with magic. He lit just the one bedside lamp, so the room was yellow-lit. There was a full-length mirror on the wall opposite his bed. Draco took a deep breath, attempted to locate the promised hidden Gryffindor within, and pulled off his pyjama trousers and pants. He Banished them to the washing hamper before he could change his mind, and picked up the old Slytherin jersey from the foot of his bed.
, but he was also pragmatic. He had basic needs which had to be met, and he wasn’t too proud to settle.
“Shut up,” Draco could see his reflection in the glass table top, and his face was brick red. “I’m not a Victorian spinster!”
Draco stood on the podium, determined not to squint even though the sunlight was glinting off the water directly into his eyes. There were half a dozen giggling children, wriggling around in bathing suits and pinching each other on the step just below him; three of them were Pansy’s brats, adorable, photogenic, and absolutely incapable of sitting still or keeping out of mischief. The press loved them, and Draco wasn’t sure who was getting more attention, the kids at his feet, or Scrivener on the podium beside him, booming out a pretentious sort of speech to open the Summer Swim program that effectively awarded all of the praise to himself, and didn’t mention the rest of the team even in passing. St Adjutor’s Public Baths for Witches and Wizards was full to the brim with members of the media, parents and children, nearly all of the staff from the Department of Magical Games and Sport and a handful of assorted VIP’s.
Draco showed his teeth. “It was a very long time ago, I’ve quite forgotten. But I think it went something like ‘Weasley is our king’.”
somehow pull tonight? The other person might be disappointed when they got past the wonderpants and found that Harry was, in fact, just average in the cock department. On the other hand, what if a prospective pull got a look at the old, loose, snitch-and-broom patterned boxers he normally got around in...well, that would turn anybody off. “Jesus Christ,” Harry said, twisting to the side to get a view of how the jeans plastered themselves to both his arse and his crotch. He was going to get arrested for public indecency.
“I did tell him. I always do. I’ll tell him again on Monday.” Harry frowned. “Why does he always have to pick on you like that?”
“Ink on you,” Malfoy said under his breath, pulling out a chair for Harry right beside his. Harry’s gut lurched in a familiar way.
Ron, sitting in the rear passenger seat, turned to Harry and confided, “Hampton Wick is rhyming slang for prick, Harry.”
He felt mad with it. He was too rough with Potter, his fingers twisting inside with the barest slick of Conjured oil, and his kisses were more akin to bites. But Potter kept moaning,
There were cufflinks from Hermes, a long coat from Balenciaga, two more from Burberry (a lovely mustard leather trench, and a black military style which reminded Harry a little bit of Draco’s old Auror uniform). A black suit from Dior, and a velvet one from Ferragamo...a dark, tarnished gold puffer jacket from Ferragamo too, Harry seemed to recall he’d bought quite a great deal, even by his standards, from that particular collection.
Draco sighed, miserably. Theo placed a cup of fresh coffee in front of Blaise and gave him a peck on the lips. “Made with love, darling.” For Draco, he placed a tall glass of cold orange juice on the worktop, and said, “This one’s made with deep annoyance, you prat.”
“You know this one, everyone’s played in school.” Ron gestured around the table at them all with a long orange fry. “You have to pick one person from the Auror Corps to shag, one to marry, and one to kill. It’s a forced choice game, so you can’t cop out by saying your spouse, or whatever. I’ll start.” Ron shoved the chip in his mouth and clapped his hands loudly together. “I would shag Anders for three reasons: first, if I’m going to cheat on my wife in a fuck-or-die scenario, I’m picking someone I cannot fucking stand so she knows there’s no chance I’ll develop any feelings.” The table laughed and jeered at him, and Ron grinned. “Secondly, his hair is
Harry shook his head. “No. I know you’ve been flirting with me. My question is this: at the end of the day, I love cock, and you love cock. So are you coming home with me tonight, or am I going back out on that dancefloor to find someone who will?”
There were pages of transcripts from interviews with suspects, all of whom had so far been ruled out. It was apparent that this would come down to lab work, and probably some fairly tedious fieldwork. He would have to make a start on some of the tests right away to give them time to develop, if he wanted to get started on his fieldwork. He definitely didn’t want Shacklebolt to come down and shout at him again.
“Granger,” Draco said dismissively. “Harry, listen. I love you, alright? All of you, from the brilliant to the incredibly stupid. All your trauma, all your resilience, every messy, wonderful bit of you. I want to marry you. Even a bag of hair and scabs wouldn’t stop me.” He cupped Harry’s face in both hands. “But if I don’t get my engagement party, I will murder you with my own two hands, are we clear?”
“Well, here’s some good news for you,” Ginny said, elbowing him in the side again, and holding out the orange creams. “I’m not your friend.”
Home. He didn’t really want to go. He wanted to conjure a cot, and kip on the ward beside Teddy. Or go home with Malfoy, and fall asleep pretzelled around him. “Yeah,” he said, instead, and sighed again. “I’m fine.”
Harry kissed around Draco’s thighs, and cock, and moved up to lay beside him, his middle finger still petting Draco gently between the curve of his arse, his balls warm against Harry’s palm. Draco’s mouth was soft, but greedy, hot and wet, and they kissed slowly, slowly, and Harry rubbed Draco just as slowly, in no hurry.
“Come on, you little prick...I’ve almost got you...” With a short glass rod Harry pushed aside the now spent threads of yellow spellwork, which dissolved on contact with the safety mat with a quiet sizzle. With great care and precision, a single yellow thread emerged from his wand tip, hardly the width of a human hair, and Harry placed it upon the exposed parts very gently, turning his wand in a careful loop until the strand broke free and settled completely on its target. This time, the toaster pieces themselves turned a shade of mustardy gold, and Harry readied his wand and an empty phial. It took only a few seconds, and the various pieces of toaster simply disintegrated before his eyes, leaving a curl of sallow vapour behind, and a strong odour of sulphur. Harry collected the vapour in his phial with a pleased sound, and firmly pressed the cork back into the neck of it. By the looks of it, that was about the best quality sample he had ever collected, and there should be plenty of the stuff to combine with the tracking charm, which would lead them right to their culprit’s front door. He or she would be in Auror hands by the end of the week.
Draco did his best to straighten his hair and robes. “It’ll remind me of you, and then things will be more than a little bit stiff in that area.” He smoothed his hands over Harry’s chest, then pushed him gently away. “Go and get dressed, or you’ll catch your death.”
“Why?” Potter did move towards him this time, and he looked - hurt, perhaps. Disappointed. “Why would I lie about this? There’s literally no advantage to be gained by me lying to you about this. Draco I know, this must seem like it’s coming out of nowhere, but it’s been happening for a while, it’s just…” Potter shrugged. “I didn’t think you wanted this. I didn’t want it to stop if you found out it was more than just sex for me.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco started to feel panicky again, and Blaise guided him over to the settee to sit down before he fell down. Theo got more coffee. Except for Draco, who received another glass of juice.
Aunt Petunia’s voice shrieked immediately in his head, and Harry felt his heart begin to hammer. “No,” Draco said firmly, and took his hand. “Whatever just went through your head, Banish it.”
“More like her cunt,” Malfoy said mildly, and Harry almost choked. “But I get your meaning. Amy, as you can see, is in the ‘doggy’ position and is quite stable when placed on a flat surface, like a table or bench.” Malfoy slapped a hand firmly onto one cheek, which jiggled slightly, then shoved it a little; the toy didn’t move, but the cock bush nodded alarmingly as if in approval. “She can take quite a bit of thrusting without any slippage -  at least, not the kind you wouldn’t want in the heat of the moment. Both the anus and the vagina are fully functional and textured internally for realism. Even the skin is quite lifelike,” Malfoy’s hand stroked, feather-light, over the buttock and barely fluttered over the crease, and Harry wondered suddenly if it was possible for one’s spectacles to fog up from the heat of a blush alone.
If Draco wasn’t sitting with them, Potter would eventually seek him out, and Draco would unfailingly be looking at him when he did; and there’d be a raised eyebrow, and a quick jerk of the head: want to get out of here?
“Probably not, but that’s sort of what brings me here,” Harry said smoothly. “I want to raise some funds for St Mungo’s, and I thought you might be just the man to help.” He had Zabini’s full attention. “I know you normally deal in art, but you seem like the kind of fellow who could pull something like this off.”
he thought he'd see there, her face…no. A bright, white-haired older man, sort of informally interviewing people, like Stephen Fry, and Michael Flatley, and Sir David Attenborough. He liked it, and Potter made sure it was always on at ten thirty on a Saturday evening.
“Do you need me to send through the preliminary interviews for the Keepers?” Weasley said, holding open the Refectory door for Draco. He shook his head.
was to Pansy, asking for Neville’s number. She provided it readily enough, with numerous questions about why he wanted it and when he’d got a mobile, and
“Alright.” Draco wasn’t going to argue with that logic. “This has happened all over London, but our best bet is starting the search here. It's convenient and probably the largest volume of birds were taken from the Ministry Owlery. We need to start a cross query on the archives for any complaints, legal cases and so forth that relate to owls, the post system, animal welfare and birds generally. I think we also need to get into the Ward Room and see what we can find in the surveillance records. We need to interview the Owl Keepers and find out who was on the overnight shift, and when the last time was that the owls were accounted for.”
“That was a holy show,” Longbottom said, and Draco turned back and looked out at the crest and break of the water. It was beautiful, and he must have said the same aloud, because Longbottom muttered something Draco couldn’t quite catch. He was pointing the phone at Draco now, and Draco grinned and made a half-hearted swipe at it.
“You – in the shirt,” Draco snapped his fingers and a passing server stopped in his tracks. “I need you to do two things immediately. Firstly, go over to the buffet table and make sure that drunken fool in the orange robes does
It was hard to argue, when Draco was kissing him like that. It was hard to remember all the reasons why.
With what he hoped was an appropriately authoritative flourish of robes, Draco made his way to the nearby meeting room to address his staff. Potter, to his immense satisfaction, seemed inclined to do what he was told for once, and had filed in behind Draco, closing the door after himself.
“Is that the Throttlebottom case you’re working on, Potter?” Harry cringed. It was apparent by his tone that Shacklebolt knew very well that it was not, and it was equally as apparent that he was fairly unimpressed by that knowledge. The fact that the Minister for Magic was taking time out to make a personal visit at all was hardly a good omen.
His mobile was ringing. His mobile almost never rang. It was strictly for emergencies. Why was his mobile ringing?
Ron fiddled with the buttons until he found something less offensive to his tender ears. “So, I imagine it’s early in the investigation considering it only happened last night, but any leads on this forest of knobs situation?”
For whatever reason, Harry hated doing admin tasks. He’d hated it at school, he hated it at work, and he hated it in his personal life, even when the admin would lead to lovely things that he
“Sorry sir, thank you. The files you requested are on your desk. Can I interest you in a cup of tea?”
He laughed, and brushed the wetness from his eyes. “No. It’s fucking horrible.” Draco held out his glass, and gently clinked it against hers. “Thanks for coming.”
“I will, I will,” Potter soothed, moving one hand to his own cock, dragging it up and down Draco’s crevice. “But I like to hear you beg for it first.”
She uncovered her face. “For what it’s worth, I did bet against it, however in my defense I was rather keen on getting in your pants myself at that point. Having said that, I did always harbour a bit of a fantasy about you and Malfoy in the Quidditch changing room.” Ron gagged and took a large mouthful of orange juice as if to wash away a bad taste.
Potter really needed to take more responsibility for his own actions, actually. It was hardly fair of him, wandering around in unbuttoned uniform - worse, when he unbuttoned it, one handed, fingers lazily slipping button after button from their loops, while Potter leaned against this very same door. Chatting casually to Draco like he wasn’t all but stripping for him.
Potter laughed, and popped a vol-au-vent in his mouth whole. There were a few flakes of pastry on the lapel of his jacket, and Draco’s fingers itched to brush them away. “This thing – what is this thing?” He popped another into his mouth, and a shower of crumbs followed.
“If I remember correctly, you don’t have anything on tomorrow, is that right?” Malfoy slipped a small, rectangular object out of his waistcoat pocket, something the size and shape of a matchbox. “Just the gym in the evening?”
Theo shrugged. “Isn’t that the same as what’s happening now? You’re miserable, why not enjoy yourself for as long as it lasts and be miserable later, instead?”
Draco didn’t look at him, but nodded, and Potter sighed again, and strode out of the room. Draco put his arms on the mantle and leaned his head down, letting it hang between his shoulders, and tried to breathe. This was the most scared he’d been in years. Ridiculous, but there it was. Potter was an engulfing flame, wildfire, a force that could burn down his life if he let it, and might anyway despite his best efforts.
Teddy mulled this over. “Nan and Auntie C told me I had to stop talking about my farts.” Draco pursed his lips for a long moment before responding.
Harry turned to him, scrubbing a hand up the back of his neck and into his hair. “Fucking hell, Malfoy. He knew what I said about him. He
— to be roused from it. The dream was already vanishing, and Draco could hardly recall which of the Beaters precisely had been worshipping his calves, nor the exact shade of the tight, brown nipples of the Keeper whose thumbs had pressed firmly into the arch of his left foot. He’d never get back to it, now, not even if his mobile stopped ringing immediately and he went directly back to sleep.
“Cheers,” Harry said, and when Malfoy looked away to Conjure a quill to take notes, Harry brushed his fingertips over his lips as nonchalantly as possible, as if he could draw Malfoy’s magic right in with his breath and keep it inside him forever.
Ron was towards Harry’s left, so Pereira went next, and immediately and without shame admitted to wanting to boff Etchells’ brains out. Oldmeadow said he’d marry Dawlish, because Dawlish was close to retirement and hopefully would be persuaded to do all the housekeeping once on home duties, as Oldmeadow apparently hated cleaning more than anything, including Dawlish.
“Actually,” Potter pushed off the door. “I’ve got something else you might enjoy. Not coffee,” he smiled, “but not tea, either.”
Malfoy, who smells like warm sugar and tobacco. Malfoy whose voice was low and sweet in his ear, calling him a good boy - fuck. He didn't know he'd like that so much. He never guessed. It was probably something about being called a bad child so often in the past -
“Harry, mate, light of my life - I say this with the deepest love and affection, but I don’t think you’ve ever had a good idea in your life.”
“Well enough,” Draco said, leaning back in his chair and stretching. “I feel sorry for the girl, but it looks like Granger will let her off relatively lightly. Thanks for that, by the way.” Weasley shrugged.
“-and I happened to comment that sometimes apparent dislike could actually be a sign of attraction.”
“No,” Draco extended one long leg, and turned a box over with his foot. “This seems to be mostly Quidditch kit, rather than bags of hair and scabs. So far.”
Weasley laughed for a long moment. “Dennis was oblivious, and Harry was getting redder and redder, while Den told the whole Common Room how Harry had been super interested in these specific pictures, and had Colin make him copies. Which Col did, and he even
“Good boy?” Malfoy had absolutely no business looking so virtuous, when saying something with such wicked innuendo.
Draco pulled at the sleeve of his jersey and wondered if this had been a huge mistake. “I need to let Ted know I’m here.”
, we’re considering the owls hostages at this stage until we know better. I know you’re meant to be on leave. I know you deserve it very much. I know you’re going to make me pay for calling you in, but please, for the love of Merlin, could you do that
He imagined Malfoy was behind him on the bed, watching him in the mirror. He tilted his hips, spread his legs wider; imagined it would give Malfoy a glimpse of his balls which were growing higher and tighter as he stroked. Malfoy would be softly giving him instructions in his low sweet voice; telling him to move faster, now slow; to twist his wrist
Ron slouched down in his seat, poking the nearest air vent with obvious annoyance. “Other than those ‘came’ twits? Not really. The guy is exceedingly unpopular, it could have been anyone – it could have been his own
, yes. That changed everything. Harry felt for the small grooves on the toy, and pressed firmly to start the first speed vibrating.
The Quidditch hoard was boxed up and shrunken, and stacked in a pile ready near the fireplace so that Draco could levitate it through the Floo to Hogwarts on Wednesday. This lot would need to be managed differently. While Draco got started Conjuring boxes and putting up labels for ‘Donate’ and ‘Keep’ and ‘Auction’, Harry gave Hermione a call on the mobile, and organised for she and Ron to come by on Wednesday night for that Chinese. Hermione would drive their car, and they’d fill the boot with all the shrunken boxes and take it together to the charity shop. Ron would manage the charms to discreetly resize everything, and it would be sorted as easily as that. Harry closed his eyes and breathed deeply, and told himself that the important thing was that it was being sorted now, and it didn’t matter anymore that it should have been sorted out a long time ago.
“Very manipulative of you Potter, well done. But there’s no need. He’s also a proud little fuckweed, so he’ll say something nasty about everything being out of season, and then silently seethe over it until he can find something else to one-up me on.”
“Thank goodness you’re here to clarify that, Potter. If you would, perhaps you can also explain to me just what I’m supposed to do on my unexpected day off?”
That shed no further light on why in Salazar’s name the elf was here. Why not an owl, or a Patronus? Why was
“A regular here, are you?” Harry asked Malfoys arse, the sound of the street falling away as they ascended the stairs. “They all seem to know you. I notice we didn't have to line up. Or pay the cover charge. ”
want to live here anymore…" Draco frowned and wiped a sweaty palm on his thigh. This was already deviating from the imagined scenario. "What I meant was, you took me in when I didn't have anyone else, or any
“Yeah,” Harry said, even though he hadn’t really thought about it at all. Hadn’t thought of a single spot he might put up a solitary balloon. “That sounds good. Because of the hot weather.”
“Obviously not strictly, otherwise I wouldn’t have been-” Draco stopped and waited while the elf served Weasley his drink. “I’m traditional in principle only. Mother isn’t actively looking on my behalf, I’m clearly not keeping celibate, and there certainly won’t be any sort of announcement about my availability. I’m well past the point where I could be persuaded to marry a woman, so children are entirely off the table. We don’t go to the pureblood events, and we won’t start, either.”
She patted his hand. “We’re fine, Harry. I’ll call you if anything comes up.” Her dark eyes sparked. “Or I’ll call Draco, since you’re always together.”
Harry said nothing, but he didn’t really need to, because Malfoy shuffled out of Harry’s bedroom looking rumpled, well rested, and rather delicious. He went brick red when he caught sight of Harry and Ron, who both raised their mugs of tea in greeting, and stomped off to his own room, slamming the door.
He was vaguely familiar with most of London, a byproduct of his former Auror days, and Tabernacle was only a few minutes walk from the station. Not far enough to account for the redness in Harry’s cheeks, but he was determined to go through with this, every agonising moment of it, no matter how much he blushed or sweated, or how much Malfoy rinsed him for it. He needed this. Malfoy and Hermione were right (which would probably cause either of them to die of shock if they knew they were in agreement), and like everything else he’d overcome in his life, it was a matter of throwing himself into it and letting his body find its natural rhythm. Just like it had with flying, with Quidditch, with magic in general.
“About nine hours, give or take,” Hermione said, putting take away boxes on the coffee table, and Summoning cutlery. “Fork or chopsticks?”
“Leave me alone so I can finish this paperwork. I want to get home as soon as. I have a holiday to re-start tomorrow.”
“Do you really think that pairing is a good idea?” Blaise countered. Draco thought it was sort of nice, actually. Longbottom was a good sort, and Pansy could be very sweet, in her own way.
“Completely useless,” Harry agreed, and he bent his head. Malfoy looped it around his neck. His eyes were bright, his face red. His fingers worked quickly, touching Harry briefly on the throat, grazing an earlobe. “I’ll wear it every day. You might need to help me, sometimes.”
“Fine,” Draco snatched up the parchment and shoved it back into his In tray. “If Deputy Head Potter wants the report from me, that’s what he’ll get.”
...but he’d never been harassed so much in his life. Not even right after the war. He was approached, constantly, he received unwashed knickers in the post around the clock, and the nudes -
“So what does that leave us? Mischief? Psychopathy? Someone wanting to do a major crime, something with Gringotts?”
my arms, and bashed my head on the ground, and chipped a tooth. I’ve got a con-con-” he looked at his grandmother, unable to remember.
Merlin’s pants. “You really went for it,” Harry said, relieved, impressed, ready to strangle him, all at once. “Your cousin Sirius would have been very impressed, I think. But he definitely would have wanted you to be safe, so no more wings, and leaps of faith, alright?”
Orange Singlet Paul seemed to like that, although Harry regretted the words as soon as they’d left his mouth. “So. Care for a dance, Harry?”
“Potter. Either it’s the end of the world, and your early arrival is one of the signs of the apocalypse, or the rest of us arrived so early for work that we actually ended up in the middle of yesterday.”
“Hey, big fella,” Harry murmured it through a kiss pressed to his hair. “You’re alright. You’ve had a bit of a fright today, haven’t you?”
Harry looked at Malfoy with what he knew must be a pathetic expression - grateful, besotted, dumb as a bag of hair - but Malfoy was talking to Pereira, and pouring himself a glass. Dignity intact for the moment.
There wasn’t much more to do, other than to pass Malfoy some gloves, and try to stop sweating by sheer force of will.  “Right. So - erm. We just…”
“Of course, darling,” Draco said sarcastically. “Red Beard- I mean, Ginny, will of course bring her not-girlfriend.”
“Right. Alright. Here’s the thing. I have a bit of a problem, ah, letting go of things. And so, I mostly, well, don’t.”
“Harry Potter,” Draco sat at the bar like a common drunk, and realised, through the haze of vodka, that he’d ranted this aloud, when someone seated to his left responded. “What’s this Harry Potter look like?”
“Case,” Ron said, too quickly. Harry narrowed his eyes, and Ron looked firmly at the bowl of mixed nuts on the table between them.
Malfoy grinned back. “Sounds like she hasn’t changed much. So, what’s a week like in the life of The Workaholic Who Lived?”
The deep clean of Teddy’s room only took around two hours, and would have been far less, had Harry been allowed to use magic. Draco had written him a list of tasks, such as using the long-handled duster to sweep for cobwebs in the cornices, and wiping all the furniture down with a damp cloth
, the twat - and shoved them in his mouth, a testament to how tired and probably tipsy he was. He would never normally do something so crass as stuff his face with crisps straight from the packet, especially not so many at once. That was rather Harry’s department. “Yeah, well. You’re special, aren’t you.”
“And didn’t realise the two spells would conflict due to their common ancestor. They’re too closely related, it confuses the magic.”
Draco glared. “Whatever could have happened to it? It’s almost as if an exemplary staff member who hasn’t had a break in a very long time was interrupted on their holiday! Clearly this person was pushed to the edge, Weasley. You should give them some latitude. Poor soul.”
Harry maneuvered the car into a parking spot with relief and turned the engine off. “Maybe we can discuss it once we’ve eaten.” The relief was short lived. Now he’d have to talk about it. Which he wanted to do, that's why he’d asked them to brunch after all. But at the same time, he absolutely did not want to talk about it. Ever. And especially not with them.
After a moment, he lifted a hand to Summon the pack of chocolate Hobnobs he kept in his desk drawer, for emergencies, and had stuffed one into his mouth whole by the time Vicky was back with his cuppa.
Draco pushed the button to call the lift. “Right, so you’re thinking focus on the ward record between two and three, then?”
“It depends on the circumstances. We do a lot of in-home care for the elderly, but in your case it was more that your condition wasn’t as serious, so we decided to keep the ward clear for more urgent care patients.” Hosford sighed. “St Mungo’s resources are spread a bit thin these days, I’m afraid. The enduring product of the War. Kids born with inherited curse damage, a larger disabled community, conditions which have only emerged or worsened over time.” The Healer gave Harry a sad smile. “I suppose I don’t have to tell you, Mr Potter.”
“He’s right,” Ginny said. “You do look exactly like a toe. Now, throw down your fucking card, Ron! A quick game’s a good game.”
Harry nodded. It was quite surreal, sitting here with Malfoy, who he hadn’t spoken to in – well,  probably years, with a room filled with sex toys just behind them, calmly talking about rubber cocks. “Thanks, that’s really helpful. I guess I’ll go and visit the other lot at,” Harry looked over at the scrap of paper again. “
Draco stared at him again. “Yes, Potter, and I like a clean office, but you don’t see me pushing house elves over to get to a mop and broom, do you.”
Draco realised he'd been asleep only when he woke. His eyes were gritty, and felt sore. Crying eyes. He sighed to himself. At one time, he could say he hadn't had those eyes since he was a child, but then the war came along and changed all of that. The rumbling in his stomach prompted him to look at the clock - one in the afternoon. Lunchtime. The smell of cooking was suddenly all around him, prickling at his nostrils and tastebuds, only just penetrating the fog of his brain - he knew the smell. Roast lamb and red wine gravy. Draco's favourite, and the lunch they ate together every Sunday since the first, at the Muggle pub after Draco was freed. He got out of bed, and pulled on some clothes. Now was as good a time as any to face the music.
was certainly not worried about being single at his age, and thirty-two was still practically juvenile, actually.
“Is there a statute of limitations on saving the world?” Hermione mused, reorganising her hand for the dozenth time.
“I’d like to stay the night, please.” Harry said it firmly, but it was still a question. Draco could refuse. Instead, he nodded, and kissed him again and again, and eventually Harry pulled him up from the sofa and asked to be taken to bed, and Draco led him there with their fingers tangled together, and sticky with sweat, and come. The rest of his clothes were on the floor of the sitting room, except for one sock and his tshirt, and Harry silently removed those too, and climbed into Draco’s bed. Draco pushed down his pyjamas and stepped out of them, and after a moments pause, left the jersey on.
Harry shuffled his own cards, and silently cursed Ginny for taking so long. Honestly, was she fermenting the booze herself? “Seven diamonds. And yes. No. A bit.” He sighed. “I don’t know.”
He finally settled on three items. A squishy, clear cylinder with bumps and ridges on the inside that you apparently put your cock in when having a wank, or so the instructions said on the back of the packet. There was a funny white dome that worked like a kind of dick helmet, placed on the head of the cock and set to vibrate. And finally, a proper vibrator, a prostate ticklerr to be precise, which looked something like a thick wishbone, one prong to thrust up the backside, and the other to press up behind the balls.
Harry laughed a little hysterically. “I don’t know how peculiar it is, Malfoy. Throttlebottom’s making a lot of noise about the case, and that means the Minister’s been breathing down my neck to get it done. I’ve just been working a bit too hard this week. I probably just need a nap, and something to eat that didn’t come out of a packet.”
each lash of Malfoy’s fist on his own cock, and he cursed himself again for not having taken care of his sex life some time ago.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “It’s a spontaneous occurrence of a multiplying dick tree, Malfoy. We’ve well and truly passed strange some time ago.”
“Quidditch. Colin had tried to help Harry when he took over as captain, and he went off and spied on the other teams at practice, and took a bunch of pictures. Essentially, totally useless, and Harry hadn’t asked him to do anything like that, except some of the photos were rather interesting.” Weasley was starting to outright laugh. “Quite a few pictures of a certain Slytherin Seeker in his practice greens, looking very tousled and posh, and a few more where said Seeker was pulling his jersey off and showing off a rather impressive rig for a sixteen year old.”
“Sort of. Not just here. I’m testing this place out for a couple of weeks, but I think I’ve already fished this catchment to exhaustion.” He picked at the beer mat with his thumb. “I’ll give it another week, I think.”
They reached what Harry supposed must roughly be the middle of the dance floor, and Malfoy stopped prodding him forward and instead gently squeezed Harry’s hip to indicate he should stop. The air was sort of hazy, with purple and red laser lights cutting in and out of the smoke. Harry’s ear was still tingling from where Malfoy’s lips had almost brushed against it; he felt a sudden need to see Malfoy, and twisted around to face him. Malfoy was really there, his pale hair glowing red, purple, red, as the lights flared and subsided. He looked glorious; incongruous in his waistcoat and grey in a sea of neon and glitter, and bare skin. Malfoy smiled at him and leaned closer to be heard. “What are you thinking, Potter?”
“I don’t think you’ve thought this through, though, mate,” Ron said, feeding Twiglets in one by one in rapid succession like a Muggle wood-chipper. “I don’t think you
The engine rumbled to life, and Harry grinned at Ron. “They got old. We’re not so far behind them, you know.” He eased the car out of the laneway and onto the main street, and before long they were cutting swiftly through the quickly thickening Muggle traffic like a hot knife through butter, courtesy of a combination of Disillusionment charms, and the sorts of spells which allow a car to pass directly through the middle of a roundabout, shrubbery and all, without harm. Harry was particularly fond of that part.
“Are you really?” Hermione’s voice was soft and encouraging, a tone he’d heard her take many times with her children. Harry felt himself beginning to sweat.
When Harry woke, it was a good while later, and to a raging thirst, and a thumping headache. He drank the water Ron left him in almost one swallow, and stumbled to the ensuite for a record breaking piss.
wizards, but Hermione’d insisted it was all part of the experience - and he’d set up his home office, and allocated a place for everything. But all that had resulted from that was slightly more organised piles of stuff he just couldn’t get motivated to sort out.
When Draco had received the memorandum requesting an analysis of the runespoor case, and saw Potter’s signature scrawled at the bottom, he did the sensible, normal, not cowardly at all thing, and delegated it to Perkins.
It occurred to Harry that there was no reason to trust Malfoy. Then again, there was no reason not to, really, not anymore. Harry had always been proud of his intuition, and historically his gut had always been right about Malfoy. It had been right when they were eleven, and right when they were sixteen. And later...Harry pursed his lips and tried to just
Draco held Harry a little tighter. “And you never will.” He kissed Harry on the top of his head. “Come on, let's do that last room.”
Draco looked up from his report, distracted. Potter leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest and a smile twitched at one corner of his lips. Around Draco was a graveyard of partly drunk, stone cold cups of tea, some nearly full, others further along. Some, disconcertingly, had formed a light scum on the surface, which was revolting, and unbecoming of a Malfoy.
Draco found the round dimple in the glass, like he’d seen Longbottom do, and pressed his thumb to it to close the message.
He tried very hard not to breathe Malfoy in, but Malfoy smelled unfairly delicious, and then there was the matter of how lovely and warm, and firm, his body felt where it was pressed against Harry’s. He could feel his glasses slipping slowly down to his nostrils, aided by the sweat gathering on bridge of his nose. Malfoy hadn’t looked all sweaty and weird when
Harry crashed over the edge, barely breathing, come hot and thick where his cock had laid hard against his belly. He hadn’t even touched it, hadn’t needed to in the least, but now his fingers fumbled with the toy’s speed dial, already easing it out of himself while he found the wherewithal to switch it off.
He laughed. “I had an unfair advantage. Famously good at lip reading.” He leaned in close, and spoke directly into Harry’s ear. “Famously good with my fingers, too, for future reference.” Harry’s mouth was dry. He wasn’t quite sure how to respond. His body knew, but apparently it hadn’t let his mouth in on the plan. Orange Singlet Paul jostled Harry’s waistband again. “This is your first time out, isn’t it?”
“Fellas! As much as I’d usually enjoy this weird mating ritual of yours, I don’t have the time, so can we please all focus on the issue at hand, which is several thousand missing owls.”
Harry shrugged on his outer robe, and patted his pockets for his wallet and wand. “I am a department head, Ron. That’s what that fancy dinner was all about, the one where you ate most of a whole roasted pig?”
“Yes, well. It doesn’t matter what you want. Smith is acting Head Auror, he’s the one with the power. By the end of the week, you’ll be assigned to some fucking idiot with no idea what they’re doing, and within a fortnight you’ll be killed in action.”
Harry let himself be led back into his office, Malfoy guiding him with a warm, sure hand on the small of his back, and he sat down on his creaky divan without saying his usual prayer to ward off it’s imminent collapse.
Potter sipped his tea. “I never used to think I was lucky – actually I would have said I was probably the most cursed bloke around, but I suppose you don’t survive Voldemort by having bad luck.” Draco cast his eyes around the office for a space to put down his teacup, and finally pushed it back into Potter’s free hand. Potter grabbed it awkwardly, narrowly avoiding a spill. “You’re leaving?”
They’d decided on the same service for the catering, even though Molly had insisted, but Harry had been just as insistent that he wanted her to enjoy every second of the party, and that if she loved him, she would comply. She’d narrowed her eyes and called him a wicked boy, and Draco had laughed so hard he had to leave the room, but she’d given in, and now she was swaying around the sitting room in Arthur’s arms, red-cheeked and giggling that she couldn’t feel her feet. The champagne was clearly very good.
Right. He was already a little bit hard just from the thought of playing with Malfoy’s toys, so he wasted no further time, uncapped his lube, and took himself firmly in hand.
“I can finally be under you,” Potter said affectionately. Draco twisted his neck to look up at Potter, who was carding his fingers through Draco’s hair with a smile.
with him? Even with as little experience and apparently as little emotional intelligence as Harry had, it really seemed like Malfoy was maybe
“Thank you, Pierce, send him in.” Draco didn’t bother to look up from his paperwork, even when he heard Mister Ten-Thirty enter the office. “Sit.” He pulled a folio from the pile near his right hand, and flipped it open. “So, you say you have experience, Mister…” Draco looked up, his expression serious. “How is it that you pronounce your name?”
Malfoy gave him a sly smile. “You’re attractive, Potter. Even this guilelessness is sexy. You’ve got the body of an athlete, and you fill those jeans in a most pleasing fashion. What you’re wearing is simple but it plays to your physical attributes perfectly - well done, you. You claim to have no idea what you’re doing, but you’ve done it very well indeed. And even that-” Malfoy gestured at Harry again. “The blushing. The absent minded biting of the bottom lip, the hair that looks like you spent all afternoon with your head in someone’s lap and their fingers pulling on it-”
Past the toilets, he was unceremoniously manhandled into an alcove, and pressed face-first to the laminate door of a maintenance cupboard.
“Give me a kiss, sweetheart.” Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck and tried to keep stirring without knocking the pan off the stove. “You’ve never told me that before.” Draco didn’t reply, but turned his face and allowed himself to be kissed as thoroughly as one could be when one’s fiance was still cooking one’s favourite risotto. “Do you want to know when I knew?”
“Seven diamonds,” Harry said, peevishly, and messily poured himself another drink. “You were gone for ages.”
for Circe’s sake. He’d also been just a little bit hard since Malfoy had picked up his call earlier in the day, and that hadn’t flagged at all; if anything, he was oscillating between fully erect and half-mast. He’d been completely distracted and had only managed to regain some focus on his work by meditation, which had never happened to him before. And Malfoy...well, Harry could see Malfoy perhaps being a little saucy with his customers to help along a sale, or even just getting a rise out of provoking Harry, considering their history at school. But it still sort of felt like Malfoy might be flirting a little. On purpose.
“Pay attention, please.” Draco slid a thin folio of research notes into his satchel, and fastened the clasp. “Forget about what I said last night.”
Draco felt his face going red. “What? Is my-” Draco looked down at his jersey, which was admittedly stretched across the chest and biceps. “Is my top too tight?”
moment, and this moment was about pleasure, not pain. Harry set the thought aside and tried to focus on sweeter things.
“Fine,” Draco said with a put-upon sigh, one that he used when he was just putting on a show of being a grumpy shit. He got up to retrieve a wine glass, and a bottle of what he liked to call ‘dirty kitchen wine’, which just meant a lovely, reasonably priced bottle of very drinkable Muggle vino. “Out with it. What am I being manipulated into this time?”
He wrestled off his slightly muddy and leafy outer robe as he eagerly headed for the kitchen, catching sight of himself in the hall mirror on the way. He frowned at the foliage in his hair but was too impatient to do anything about it. Yanking open the door which led to the dining room and adjoining kitchen, he allowed the ridiculous grin he'd been restraining all morning to run wild across his face.
Now, with the former Quidditch Room restored to a pleasant twin, sans bedding, there were two more rooms to tackle, and both of them gave Harry stomach cramps.
“Where were you thinking?” Malfoy said, starting to pack away his files and forms, and gathering his belongings into his lovely leather satchel. He looked unfairly good with that thing slung across his chest.
Draco’s laugh was honestly the best thing in the world. “Most excellent. He’s such a competitive little fuckweed, this will absolutely kill him.”
events,” Harry amended. “I went out with Ginny Weasley for about five years, and we’ve been split up for almost ten now. She was my first, erm, you know. Sexual partner. I liked it, to be clear. I liked sex, and I liked having it with her.  I loved
“A disgusting amount,” Draco said, Levitating it down the stairs to the landing below. “Some sycophant gave it to my parents for a wedding anniversary in the eighties. It’s fuck ugly and we all hated it, but I bet it could raise a few sickles for Mungo’s.”
“It’s barely six, Draco. Surely you can spare me ten minutes? I won’t see you all week.” Draco raised an eyebrow, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, twenty minutes,
“Should we wait until after we’ve asked him the huge and inconvenient favour of sorting out the results of my childhood poverty and poor impulse control?”
“It’s called magic. You may be familiar with it from such places as our seven years at Hogwarts, or your current job in the Ministry of Magic.” Draco waved his wand in Potter’s face. “Don’t touch anything in my office, Potter. You’re a fright. You have ink on your fingers already, and it’s only a quarter after seven. How does that even happen? You’re yet to actually pick up a quill today, I’m sure.”
“What?” It felt like he’d fallen through the looking glass. “What photo, what the fuck are you on about?”
like, such as having engagement parties. He sometimes wondered whether it was genetic, perhaps a Potter thing, that he’d inherited from his Dad. He could imagine his Dad being useless at this sort of thing, and his Mum probably the one who kept them all on track. It would have been nice to know for sure, but there was nobody left to ask, aside from Petunia, and there was no chance he’d be reaching out to
Draco couldn’t help the small smile that twisted his lips, and Potter grinned back. “I’m sorry I called you ‘Pinhead’. Lashing out.” Potter shrugged it off. “And I don’t want you to think I’d hate working for you, or that you’re not good enough for the job. You are.” Draco sighed again. “I guess I’m just frustrated that I’ve spent ten years jumping through hoops for a man who hasn’t appreciated it for a second.” He let his head fall against Potter’s shoulder with a thunk.
She and Malfoy have some sort of stare-off at the door, before he moves, and she exits. He looks fit to hex by the time he sits stiffly on the bench in front of Ted’s high chair. Teddy has spotted the bowl and is reaching with both chubby hands. Malfoy has a variety of roasted veggies in the bowl, potato and carrot, and beetroot, and Teddy’s current favourite, chunks of mushy pumpkin. He tries to grab the duck as Malfoy brings it to his mouth, as if he can help get the sweet orange pulp into his mouth faster. Instead he knocks it off onto the tray, and immediately mashes both hands into it, smears it around, then shoves his fingers into his mouth with a happy babbling yell.
“You like photos of my body, Potter,” Draco pulled the top on, and pushed the cuffs up to his elbows. “Well, get ready.”
“Holy fuck—!” Draco ripped the eye mask off, his wand in hand in seconds thanks to years of drills and training, and pointed dead in the face of whoever was now in his bedroom, mumbling directly into his ear.
There must be twenty items in the box, now sorted neatly across his duvet by category and size, at least where Harry could figure out what they were actually for. Far too many to use on himself in one afternoon, especially after indulging himself so thoroughly much earlier in the morning. Some Harry discounted immediately. Too much, too soon. He would definitely need to work his way up to some of them, and he only had so many hours left of his Sunday as it was. The largest dildos and plugs went right back in the box, along with a life-size rubber hand and forearm - for fisting - fuck no, too much. What was Malfoy thinking! Jesus.
Potter laughed, and it was even more annoyingly attractive than his pasty-less smile. “Alright, I’ll go get my risk assessment reports. May I spare a minute to get a cup of tea, though? I promise you that I’ll be next to useless if I don’t have one soon.”
using the Hoover (then carpet powder, then vacuuming again). He’d moved every piece of furniture as he’d cleaned, as per the directions. He’d polished every pane of the sash window with his own two hands. Every toy was in its place, every book straight on the shelves, the duvet crisp and smooth, and the decorative pillows had been given a chop in the middle like Draco had shown him.
“I think you’re a very specific kind of idiot,” Ginny said, watching Hermione like a hawk until she finally threw down her first card. “You’re completely stupid when it comes to your heart.”
“Well if you’re officially not working, Malfoy, then it's not appropriate for you to be in the Hub. Golsby!”
Potter looked at his hand again, and rubbed at a splodge of blue along the side of one forefinger. “Well, it’s probably there from yesterday, and if I can’t budge it, it’s probably not going to rub off onto your precious stationery anytime soon, which, by the way, you are very weirdly attached to. Now come on, Malfoy. Why don’t you tell me why you’re actually annoyed with me so we can sort it out instead of shouting at each other every day.”
“So! Because you wanted to snog the both of them! Which is exactly what I was doing! Like recognises like, Harry.”
Harry slicked the wand quickly, and pressed the tip against his hole, breathing out slowly as he pressed it in. It went easily, felt quite nice.
Draco gave him a look. “It troubles me that you’re comparing hunting for Horcruxes favourably against cleaning the house for our engagement party.”
“Dunno, I guess you must have mentioned it a couple of times.” He’d mentioned it just the once. They’d both been pissed as newts. Harry thought it might have been the moment he realised his feelings had gone beyond just friendship with Malfoy, listening to him talk about introducing the near extinct species to the copse at the bottom of his mother’s estate, his eyes alight and his hands gesturing gracefully between them.  “Happy birthday, anyway. Next year I won’t forget.”
“No, I mean - I just realised I left the jacket at the nightclub. Fuck, I hope someone handed it in and didn’t make off with it.” He sighed and slumped in his seat. “That was Sirus’s too.”
“So this is where the magic happens,” Harry said with a nervous laugh, and gestured for Malfoy to go in ahead of him. Not so that Harry could look at his backside, or anything. “Um, lab coat if you wouldn't mind.” Harry handed Malfoy the spare coat which he kept on a hook near the door, and Malfoy obediently shrugged into it, and then turned to the bench.
He couldn’t wait to be in the thick of it; giving an emotional toast, having his cheeks pinched by Molly and Andromeda, being threatened with murder by Narcissa and all the Slytherins should he ever hurt Draco, dancing into the wee hours with both hands on Draco’s lovely bum, and all the rest of it. It was the lead up that he was dreading. Planning, yes, but worst of all -
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Draco said again, and he came in and sat on Harry’s bed, right by his legs. His eyes were twinkling with the reflected flame of the birthday candle, and he picked up the cupcake with his long fingers, and held it out for Harry to take. “Make a wish.”
Potter’s wand was tracking the magical signature. Draco was using his own to sweep the area for threats, of which there were none so far, unless you counted the peat bogs, or the incessant wind, which frankly, Draco did, particularly after the third time he stumbled. An old barn was just ahead, and Draco could detect a massive, but benign magical presence, consistent with a very large number of Ministry owls.
The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office occupied a small suite of rooms at the far end of Level Two. Small gold-painted letters marked their territory on the rippled glass of a faded wooden door, opening to a modest foyer that housed two plastic visitor chairs, a dusty potted plant, and a frazzled-looking receptionist behind a narrow counter. Harry’s office was behind the first of four adjoining doors; a meeting room that was barely the size of a broom cupboard squeezed immediately beside it. The third door led to an office shared by his four long-suffering field officers, and the final door led to Harry’s favourite place in the whole Ministry: the lab.
Ten minutes into a conversation about the uses of Friar’s Balsam in the treatment of mermish fever blisters, and Harry was sliding his hand dangerously high on Draco’s thigh.
The very idea was ridiculous, Harry thought to himself, not for the first time, as he sat down and flipped open the first of the waiting files. Hermione’s constant fretting that he was becoming anti-social, was burying himself in his job as a way to avoid dealing with the world at large, and such apparently catastrophic issues as his status as a bachelor, had been steadily driving him up the wall.
“Secondly, his little mate works at The Pheasantry Cafe at Bushy, and he always gives him an extra sausage with his full English.”
“Harry, breathe, it was a long time ago,” Hermione was rubbing his shoulder soothingly. “It was just that you were so obsessed with Malfoy-”
Ron snorted, re-arranged his arm around Harry’s ribs, and virtually dragged him along the ward to St Mungo’s Floo. “I value my life, and my bollocks, so I’ll be Owling your intended as soon as I’ve got you home and in bed.”
"It's not okay," he blurted angrily, getting to his feet and walking a few paces away to glare at a tapestry. "It's not okay that you did this for me, and I can't do what I need to do in return. Because you saved my life - you forgave me, and you let me help you, and you saved us all. And then you didn't just - you didn't just
“Dunno.” That wasn’t really true. Mainly he didn’t want anything to change, if Malfoy wasn’t interested in him the same way. Malfoy was a good partner, but if he transferred, if things got awkward and Malfoy couldn’t stand being Harry’s partner anymore,  it’d be Malfoy himself that he’d miss.
“About the phone…” Draco put the smashed remnants of the Nokia on the desk between them, and Weasley sighed.
“Mate, here’s the thing. You were super intense about Malfoy for like, the whole of school,” Ron started.
The pissing noise stopped, but sadly, a very long and loud, and slightly echo-y fart replaced it. Malfoy clenched his fingers around his wand.
“In the orange singlet.” The vest was a horrendous colour, like a traffic cone, but the man underneath was gorgeous. “Looks like he has nice thighs.”
. His legs were wrapped high around Harry’s waist, heels pressed into the divots at the base of Harry’s spine. Harry fucked him, it was always fucking because it was always so raw, melting hot, brain-cell destroying pleasure, but it was love, too, in every thrust and stroke, drop of sweat, soft curse, hard bite. Draco had asked him the other morning, why it was never enough, and Harry hoped it would always be like this, simple, desperate need for each other, satisfaction, then the slow build of want all over again. Draco had his hand on his cock, jerking himself with his strong, graceful fingers. Harrys hands were underneath him, splayed across the small of his back, and the top of his spine, holding him to his chest as if perhaps this time they might actually merge into one.
, better than anything I had, and sometimes I feel...like it's better than I deserve. And so many people don’t have things, like I used to. I know I should do something with all of this, but...I get stuck, and I don’t know how to start.” He looked up at Draco. His hair was slipping out of its tie again, and his eyes were soft. “Then I feel guilty about it, and anxious, then it kind of spirals until I just shut the door.”
Both Ginny and Hermione had told him that the tight fit had made them suit him even more (Ginny mentioning something about being ‘thick’ more than once), and the jeans had really been very expensive, so Harry didn't feel right about chucking them out. So he’d kept them, and was glad of it when trying to work out what the fuck he was going to wear to this Muggle club Malfoy was dragging him to, because he really didn’t have anything else that would remotely do.
That caught the girls’ full attention, and Harry favoured Ron with his most withering look. “You only sent it up this afternoon. I’ve barely read the case file.”
Draco added several orange creams to his own saucer, and walked out of the tea room fully expecting Potter to follow. He wasn’t disappointed.
“I’m a cheese man.” Harry grinned, and cupped Draco’s backside. “Nothing I like more than a big, round bocconcini.” Draco rolled his eyes, laughing as he pulled away with one last kiss to retrieve the pasta bowls, and the fine grater. “You know, my middle name is actually cheese. It’s true. James is short for Jarlesberg, you know.”
“That’s an understatement. Why didn’t you let me know?” Draco gave him a look, and Potter held up his hands. “Yeah, alright, point taken. Is there anything I can do?”
Draco unclenched his hand from it's grip on their pricks, and Harry stroked himself quickly, the grease from his palm glossing his cock thoroughly. The absolute first instant he let himself go, Draco tilted his hips and sank down on his dick, all the way to the root.
Bujalski elbowed Harry directly in the ribs, and he blinked, realising they were all looking at him expectantly. “Get on with it, Potter.”
Draco was holding up a dark grey, leopard print jumper, that Harry had ordered from the 2009 winter collection because it had looked amazing on the model, but when it had arrived it just seemed busy and weird. He held it up against himself, and then looked at Harry incredulously. “This is my size!”
“This is forking insane.” Harry picked up a polished walnut case and flicked the latch with his thumb. “What are these ones?”
Hermione answered Ginny, thoroughly amused. “The Chief Warlock is up to his eyeballs in rubber willies.”
Harry was glad to be able to do something useful with his gifts, but it was also a little embarrassing when people called him heroic.
“Unfair,” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Why does he get kisses and coffee, and I get juice and insults?”
Malfoy hadn’t stopped looking at him with that half smirk. “Never tried one, or did and didn't like it?”
Draco bit his lip happily and practically skipped to Harry's side, grabbing him by the arm and escorting him to his chair. He shook out the napkin and tucked it carefully into Harry's collar, smoothing it flat over his chest. He poured a china cup full of tea and a goblet full of juice, and filled a bowl full of salad. He counted out four slices of toast and transferred them to his plate, and proceeded to coat them with criminal amounts of butter. Harry simply sat there, in mind-numbing arousal, and tried not to let his mouth hang open. Draco had made him breakfast, and naked. Draco had been practicing all week so that he could get it right, so he could have a special welcome home surprise. He felt so fuzzily happy and in love he almost couldn't operate.
Malfoy’s mouth was still twitching slightly. “High praise. I always liked Charms at school, and Potions. I actually have a lab of my own, for work. I always prefer to test out any Muggle products before I stock them, for safety and such. You’d be surprised at the sorts of things that could go wrong when wizarding folk start messing about with Muggle gear - or, maybe you wouldn’t, given all this.” Malfoy waved his hand in the general direction of the cock bush. “I normally get a sample of anything new on the market and then hit them with all the usual charms people might like to use on their sex toys. Cleaning charms can really deteriorate the materials in rubber items, for example, but silicon holds up rather a lot better. So if you were to come into my shop looking for, say, an anal toy.”
Potter found him in the shower block later that afternoon. Draco had one hand braced against the tile beside the shower head, letting the hot water pummel him. His left shoulder was bruised to hell, in fact he could feel the muscle along his ribs beginning to ache as well, the adrenaline slowly waning.
Harry took out his wand and circled several suspicious advertisements, the words sucking right up into the tip of his wand from the page. “You have porridge on your robes, you lunatic.” Ron looked down and said several very rude words, then rubbed at the stains with one sleeve.
Malfoy followed him in and closed the door, before taking his place behind the desk. It was a modest office, not what Harry would have expected from the proprietor of a sex shop, nor from Malfoy - not that he’d spent any time thinking of what either would be like before just now. It’s only, he’d expected a sex shop to be dark and seedy, and probably rather sticky, and this was very clean and modern, with a glass-topped desk that held several wire trays holding scrolls and parchments, and what looked like catalogues, all in neat stacks, and a large ledger, and a glass jar full of quills. There were no lurid images tacked to the walls; he hadn’t seen a single poster of anyone’s vulva or anus, only several certificates in plain frames which looked to be registration of the business with the Ministry, and licenses to operate as an adult retailer. And he’d always sort of figured that Malfoy would be into heavy antiques and such, fussy, gilt monstrosities, but this was all very Scandinavian in its simplicity. It didn’t even smell funny.
“That is truly the pot calling the kettle.” Harry adjusted the temperature, and gave the rice a quick taste, before adding a tiny pinch more of fresh thyme.
There was a loud bang in the offices beside the lab, followed by a chorus of muffled laughter, and Harry nearly fell off his stool in his haste to drop the cock. He could feel his face burning, and he cleared his throat loudly and pushed his glasses as far up on the bridge of his nose as he could without forcing them into his actual eyes. The cock swung wildly on its branch, its brothers bobbing away around it. “That’s so wrong,” Harry said under his breath, eyes darting between the cocks and the door. It wouldn’t do for someone to come in and find him like this, face beet-red and a shrub covered in pricks nodding away at him like an obscene dashboard ornament, regardless of whether they were part of an official investigation. There was a tarpaulin under the bench, and Harry unfolded it quickly and tossed it over the tabletop, covering the dicks and the residue of the formerly fire-breathing toaster in the process. He could hear them batting softly against the tarp.
Draco lifted the phone to his face, and raised himself from the pillow enough to see the new message.
Draco sipped his juice. It was delicious. It wasn’t coffee. He hated it. “For someone who claims not to be into cock, you seem very on board with all things homo this morning.”
It took hardly any time at all. The water slipping down his back, over the swell of his arse and between it. It was almost like meditation, the pounding spray thrumming around him, over his body, his focus moving with the water, with the touch of his hand. The slippery thickness of his hair at the nape of his neck, the smooth length of his throat, the tendons flexing there, the jut of his collarbone. The swell of his chest, his nipple hard under a fingertip. He found he liked that, in the hours he’d spent thinking about himself, touching himself instead of sleeping, imagining Malfoy’s voice in his ear like a wet dream, whispering  “Are you ready?” and “Is that what you like? A hard cock in your mouth, and a couple of digits sliding into your tight hole?”. He did like it. He wanted it all.
Draco tugged Harry’s hand, and drew him out of the shower. “Take me to bed, and show me how much you love my hips, then.”
Ron held his hands up. “I know! But the point shouldn’t be that you’re fobbing the case off because you’ve got a personal problem with the Chief Warlock, either.”
There was no sign of his wand, and he certainly hadn't had the foresight to have left himself a glass of water the night before, and now Harry was in need of something to drink as a top priority. A dusty jumble of Muggle change sat on his bedside table, and Harry seperated a 50p coin from the pile and transfigured it into a passable cup, and filled it with water. Not his finest charm work, but hungover and wandless, it would absolutely do. He gulped it down in about two swallows. The taste was horrible, lukewarm as well, and Harry belatedly considered that he probably should have given the coin a quick scrub before using it as a cup. Well, if he was going to be killed by germs from Muggle money, after everything he’d been through in his life, so be it.
His friends left him just before nine, with instructions. Leave the phone to charge, have a shower, go to bed and stay there, ideally asleep, until at least two. Then, have a light lunch, take some suggestive photos, text them to Potter, and report back on the progress.
“I don’t know why you’ve suddenly decided to wind him up,” Weasley said with amusement, hefting his copy of the report as the rest of the team filed out. “But you should know he’s swiftly reaching the point where he’s going to really blow his stack.”
“I love how you’ve turned my sweet gesture of devotion into some grubby plot to exploit you somehow.” Draco held his gaze in silence as he sipped his wine, then he rose and came around to Harry’s side of the table, and stopped beside his seat. Harry felt his breath catch in his chest, just slightly, then Draco twitched his wand, and Harry’s chair slid away from the table just enough that Draco could lift one, long leg over his lap, and settle himself down into a straddle on Harry’s thighs. Harry’s hands came up instinctively, and he smoothed his palms from Draco’s knees right up to his hips.
Operation Yellow Stripe took nearly three full weeks to wrap up. Well, it wasn’t wrapped up, per se, more that the all-hands-on-deck part had concluded, and there were a couple of informants cooling their heels in the lockup, and a couple of Aurors deployed under cover in the field. Harry wasn’t best suited if domestic deep cover was needed. His face and voice were too recognisable, which meant a heavy reliance on Polyjuice or Glamours, and by extension, a greater chance of getting caught out. Malfoy was in much the same boat. They were more likely to get assigned on cross-border missions, and anyway, everyone knew Harry was better in a brute force scenario, than one which required patience and strategy.
Potter opened his mouth. “Good. If you’re having difficulty preparing, let me know. You have two hours – I’ll see you all in the board room at nine o’clock on the dot.”
“Happy birthday,” Harry said again, his voice softer, a little rougher. “I’m sorry I didn’t realise. Bit thick, sometimes.” He pulled away, realising that Malfoy was just standing there, with his arms raised slightly, not touching Harry. Malfoy’s face was quite pink. Harry laughed, embarrassed, and took another step back, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “Sorry for that, too. Just wanted you to know, I...appreciate you.”
Draco had shuddered. “God, no. I want front row seats even less than Ron does.” Harry snorted, because that was certainly not accurate. “Anyway, there’s only one spare up there after we converted the other into the walk-in and expanded the ensuite, and I think it’s full of my shoes, anyway.”
“Again,” Ron put far more jam on than was reasonable, and got a great deal more on the table. “You must have hated that.”
“No.” Malfoy’s hand was biting hard around Harry’s wrist, and he worked his hips hard into Harry’s lap. “No rubbing and running off this morning.”
“It looks like we don’t currently stock the Sensual Lover,” Malfoy said. “I’m sure it’ll be the Sensual Lover, rather than the King Dong. From what I could see from the
“It’s a good thing I had the foresight to set record for Bake Off,” Draco was smug for only a moment, then frowned. “God, Potter - what have you done to the television?”
Right on cue, Draco whipped his wand at the Senior Auror’s office door and strode in without waiting.
“CHIPS!” Ginny bellowed, letting herself in the front door. “Hot chips, coming through!” Hermione moved around the kitchen getting plates and cutlery, and Ginny stomped in, bringing the salty smell of fried potato, and an unmistakable hint of honeysuckle. It made Harry think of Malfoy again, flushed and surprised under the light of a pub lamp, freshly hugged.
Harry blinked. Malfoy was standing beside Harry’s bed, in Harry’s room. Malfoy was wearing rather skimpy briefs, and a thin, silky robe that wasn’t tied up, and nothing else, other than a glare, and some impressive bed head.
Ginny made a noise that nearly made Ron gag again. “I’m gonna try and make this one day, when I have someone I really want to get in my knickers.”
He wasn’t going to ask Malfoy out, but he could still celebrate him. So on Monday morning, Malfoy was greeted by a small take-away cup of espresso and two lemon madeleines, the former with a small, silver-and-green striped foil bow on the lid - but no card. Harry’d made sure he had two junior Aurors on his side of the office, sat around their small meeting table to go through the particulars of an upcoming case. As such, he could enjoy the small look of pleasure on Malfoy’s face, and feel Malfoy’s eyes on him as he studiously concentrated on his meeting, and there was no chance for Malfoy to confront him about it before the Monday morning all staff briefing.
with said item. He felt flustered and continued to sweat in a very annoying way that caused his wand to slip around in his fist, and his hair to form damp spikes which poked him sharply in the eyes.  Would Malfoy hang around to watch? He would probably need Malfoy’s help if there were special instructions for operating - it. Or maybe you just stuck it in. Could it be that simple? Harry recalled that it probably hadn't been quite that simple when real people’s privates were concerned, but this was just a lab test and there should be no need to perform any fancy moves...right? But what if Malfoy judged him for his
Harry drew in a fortifying breath. "Listen, Malfoy. In relation to my investigation. I’m at the point where I need to do some practical tests with the specimens. I need to test the cursed objects during their usual function."
“I’ll just…” Draco gestured to the compactus behind him, but stood still looking slightly stupidly at Potter instead of going to get the files he’d requested.
Draco didn’t need to be asked twice. He levitated a stack of orange files directly into Potter’s arms, where they landed with enough force to push him back a step. “I’ve been putting off meetings with personnel about operations matters for months.” Draco flicked his wand, and about a third of the flying memos swooped toward the door and commenced buzzing around Potter’s head, instead. “There’s a short preamble at the front of each file explaining what the problem is. I’ve scheduled all the appointments in Meeting Room 2 starting at half past twelve, which gives you-” Draco looked at the clock on his desk, then grinned at Potter, “-one hour to prepare.”
“Now, historically he likes to make decisions in patterns of three; two ‘no’s, then a ‘yes’. Make sure you make your real request
“Hello, trouble,” Harry said warily, sliding into the banquette. Ron looked slightly guilty, which was even less reassuring. “What were you muttering about?”
At Harry’s delighted hoot of laughter, Teddy releases Ginny’s finger to grin at him, and his eyes turn bottle green.
“Do you want another cup?” Potter’s fingers moved, and the cemetery of deceased beverages winked away, Banished somewhere. That was another of Potter’s irresponsible habits. Just wandlessly doing things, constantly, right in front of Draco like it was nothing special. As if it didn’t make Draco want to immediately get horizontal. The impudence.
The last time he fucked Potter, was this morning. He’d stayed every night that week. Draco wasn’t sure when he was planning on going home, but Harry didn’t seem in a hurry to go, and Draco was in no hurry to change what was becoming a new routine. Besides, it was convenient on a Saturday morning, when they went to brunch with Draco’s mother. Apparently that’s what boyfriends did. Draco wouldn’t know, since he’d never had one. But he was a quick study, and Harry was a willing teacher.
about it, honestly.” Weasley put a hand on his stomach, puffed with laughter. “Oh, I reckon that might almost be my favourite part of that whole year!”
Malfoy smelled sweet and distracting, and his teeth were very white where they bit into the fleshy part of his bottom lip. And his chest was sort of warm, and his thighs, which were spread a little apart, felt firm bracketing Harry’s, so he nudged one closer, and pressed it right between the supple warmth of the fork of his body.
Malfoy had been to Harry’s place before, and if he thought about it, he’d probably been to Grimmauld as a child, perhaps, when old Walburga was still alive. He probably didn’t need to be shown the way, but Harry went ahead of him anyway. The kitchen would be cooler, being in the basement. Maybe his face would cool down a bit while they were down there.
Weasley waved off the Junior Auror who came promptly to the door. “Shut your trap, Malfoy. Harry’s consulting.” Potter lifted his visitor lanyard and waved it smugly in Draco’s direction. It was Draco’s turn to raise an eyebrow.
“I’d never,” Draco’s fingers dug in, and as Harry came he could only hold on, and murmur, “Draco, Draco, Draco,” until Draco tumbled over, too.
“-in explicit detail,” Ginny continued, completely ignoring the others. “No detail is too small. Or large. Or long. Or thic-”
“Congratulations, Mr Potter – it looks like you are our new Security and Risk Assessment Consultant.” Draco held out his hand, and Potter shook it vigorously.
Harry ran his left hand down, from his chest, across his belly, feeling one kind of tension leave his body in favour of another. His muscles twitched, the soft scratch of hair below his navel under slick fingers which moved across his hip and behind himself, over the wet flesh of his arse to skim between and stroke across the furled skin deeper within. He’d barely worked a fingertip inside himself when he came, grunting with the force of it, grunting Malfoy’s name as he spattered hard against the shower tile, before warm water rinsed the mess away again.
There was a hamper full of tshirts with their tags on them. None of them fit, but Harry had never taken them back. There were several rice cookers, brand new in box, because he kept forgetting he’d already bought one that he never used anyway, and a tower of CDs and DVDs still with the plastic on. There was a machine to grind your own mince meat, and another one to fry your own doughnuts, and another to make ice cream. A bucket hat with an owl on the front. There was a lot of Tupperware -
“Why do you still pretend you can’t dress, Potter? Any idiot can see you’re in a small fortune of designer gear.” They passed the Senior Auror’s office. “Well. Maybe not any idiot. Weasley wouldn’t recognise designer even if Karl Lagerfeld were kicking him directly in his no good, freckled face.”
Draco ran one hand down the front of his dress robes, smoothing away wrinkles that could not possibly exist, considering the enthusiasm with which the fabric had been charmed with anti-creasing spells mere hours earlier. He swallowed the final few inches of champagne in his glass as casually as possible. What he really wanted to do was position himself directly under a barrel of the stuff and shamelessly guzzle until his liver was pickled, or he died of alcoholic poisoning, whichever came first. That, however, was not an option; instead, he had to keep an eye on the circulating wait staff, and their silver trays of glassware filled with golden, fizzing liquid, and carefully arranged circles of canapés. And the Undersecretary. And Potter.
“Verity Parsnip.” Draco recognised her from the personnel file, and quickly disarmed her as she started and dropped her wand.
“And the rest of it we need to sort out. I suggest we do a bit of donating again. There’s a lot of Muggle stuff here, we could drop it off at a charity shop. What do you think?”
Draco snatched the note from Bog, shaking off Potter’s warm, large hands, which had gently clasped him by the biceps when he’d stumbled. “Hello, Bog,” Potter said cheerfully, but Bog apparently was no more impressed by Potter than he was Draco, and promptly disappeared again without further comment. “He seems nice.”
He tried to focus on his breathing, which was shallow again, and his pulse was rapid in his throat. He looked at his eyes, heavy lidded and dark green with arousal, and he laughed, a low, hoarse sound that he hadn't heard himself make in a long time. Impossible that he could still be this turned on, but he was; thirty-two and behaving like he was a teen again. “You can’t spend all day bringing yourself off,” he told his reflection, sternly. But that’s exactly what Malfoy had suggested he should do, wasn't it.
When he lay on the bed, the smell of Potter surrounded him. The sheets were soft, and dark red like sweet wine, and his pillows were a mellow clementine-orange velvet. When Potter finally touched him, his fingers were warm, gentle but firm, slippery with an oil that smelled of sweet almond. He tried to hold back a groan of satisfaction, entirely unsuccessfully, and Potter settled his weight on the back of Draco’s thighs with a low laugh. “Just relax, Draco. Let me make you feel good.”
“Nobody thinks you’re an idiot, Harry.” Hermione said reassuringly, and then after a moment, when neither of his other so-called best friends said a word in agreement, she scrunched her nose apologetically, and amended, “not
“Yes, you can check my calendar. It clearly says ‘Brandy Alexander’ at 4.30pm.” Potter snorted his laughter into his tea, and Draco maintained an expression of determined innocence. “Very difficult to re-schedule, that one. Quite a shame.”
He felt Potter’s exasperated groan right through his chest. “Ron told me it’d be hard. I knew it would, but I didn't expect this.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” Ginny said. “I think that lovely head of yours is absolutely empty, except for one thing.”
at all three, whisking away the sticky lube. Another swish and flick, and a tarp was settling neatly on top of the whole lewd collection. For the first time in a long time, Harry locked the door of the lab behind him, and charmed it to open strictly to his magical signature. The very last thing he needed was the weekend custodian stumbling in and lodging a formal complaint with Facilities.
“It’s what Teddy thinks,” she said. Her voice was neutral. “It’s what he told Harry. He actually got Andromeda to phone Harry so he could see if Harry could get you out of work that weekend. Harry’s furious, by the way. I’ve never seen him like this.”
It was hard to remember the last time he’d been so turned on, and never just by looking at himself. His skin these days had a warmer look. Not the sallow paleness of a starved child. It’s soft. His fingers chart the terrain from his chest to his throat. He’d always liked being kissed there. Bitten. Stubble was beginning to show along his jaw, and he liked that too, a man’s stubble now, not a boy’s. The contrast of rough and smooth. His fingers chase a shiver over his collarbone, shoulder, over his biceps; he flexes for a moment, pleased by the play of muscle in the low light. Forearms. Wrists. He felt strength there, capability, but also tenderness. The slight glint of hair. His hands are a little rough these days, and there are all sorts of scars there too. He imagined running his fingertips through Malfoy’s hair, over his lips, between his thighs. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed but he forced them open again and put his hand on the waistband of his jeans.
Draco turns again to Teddy. His face is entirely red, now, and he pulls out his wand and retrieves the spoon, charms it clean. Ted has claimed the bowl and has mashed its content into a bright pink smear, with roasted veg remnants up to his tiny plump elbows. No sharp points, there.
“There’s an obvious way around that, isn’t there?” Ron pointed the tongs at Harry. “Just order the artificial arsehole.”
“It was a bit much to take in,” Draco said. “It’s hard to believe you might have feelings for me, when it seems like you don’t know me at all.”
Speech was near impossible. Draco understood, and Harry was in receipt of a happy lapful of naked blond within seconds. He crushed his mouth to Draco's, tasting the salty butter, the toast, a hint of tea that he must have taken earlier. He could smell his favorite, warm Draco-smell, and feel his favorite, warm Draco-skin beneath his hands. He was kissing like he was attempting to enter Draco via his mouth, and crawl right down his throat, and Draco was kissing back in much the same manner. The room was filled with heavy puffs of breath and 'mmm-mm' noises, and the occasional 'oh'. Harry's face was dotted with the residue of Draco's breakfast, and Draco's hands had dislodged most of the twigs in Harry's hair whilst roaming through enthusiastically. Together they wrestled his pants to mid-thigh, kissing all the while, and now their bare cocks were touching, batting against each other as they communicated in a simple language of licks and bites. Draco took them both in hand, fisting them lightly and slowly until Harry couldn't concentrate on the kissing anymore and had to drop his head back against the chair and just moan.
Hermione tossed her card in the middle, and Harry looked distractedly at his, before chucking the highest one in the same suit on the table.
And Harry laughed around his cock, because Draco was the funniest person he knew, even seconds away from orgasm, and Draco was really moaning now. Harry traced his fingertip over the tight furl of Draco’s hole, closed his eyes and reached out with his magic, and
“Hey,” Harry said as they reached the topmost step. He caught Malfoy’s elbow and pulled him to a stop. “I wanted to say thanks. For tonight. I had a good time, even though I sort of didn’t want to come, and - and also, thanks for being so...understanding. For being so kind to me. I didn’t expect it.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow and Harry quickly realised how that might have come off. “Uh - no, that sounded horrible. Sorry. I mean to say, it’s not exactly how we’ve behaved in the past, with each other. This was - you’re - erm.” So much for the control over the flush.
,” Draco was furious, his temper rising fast. “And recommended I put them on before trotting off home. Not sure how many ways that can be interpreted.” He held up his hand to cut off whatever Potter was about to say in retort. “It’s fine, Potter. Message received. I left, didn’t I? My apologies if it’s been a little inconvenient for you to have to find another willing body, but rumour has it you’re up to your ears in offers. So just, find yourself a new routine and,” Draco waved his hand dismissively, “carry on.”
“Healer Barnfield called them intrusive thoughts. It sort of goes along hand in hand with the hoarding, and the anxiety and stuff. As soon as I’m allowed to use magic again, I’ll send her an owl and book an appointment.”
“Get going, tart, you’re wasting vital seduction time. And be gentle,” he called after her. “Don’t break all my friends.” Merlin knows, it wasn’t like he could just Conjure up more.
Harry tossed the tie on his desk. Now he was starting to get pissed off as well. “Well, it doesn’t affect you, Malfoy, so I don’t know why you’re being such a fucking bitch about it.”
“Here’s what I think,” Granger leaned in, tapping her nails on the glass table. “You look like someone is ripping your heart to shreds in small increments. He’s bumbling around in a black temper, completely confused and frustrated. I would guess that neither of you has bothered to have an actual conversation about your relationship, like a pair of utter nitwits. You quite obviously have deeper feelings than just casual sex, and you’ve decided the best solution is to just vanish from the radar.” She raised her eyebrows at him. “Go on, tell me I’m wrong.”
-” Now he pinched his fingertips gently and prised a jagged red thread away from the rest. “That looks a lot like a Warming charm to me.”
Draco raised his eyebrows in amusement. “You think I’m that devious? How dare you.” Potter made a face. “Seriously though, I really appreciate this.”
“I’m right here, Draco, keep your hair on,” Granger levitated several jugs of foamy beer, and a stack of glasses, and managed to get them onto the table without spilling a drop. “Ron, I’ll need to share your chair, there isn’t enough room.”
“One with an enormous sticky beak.” He paused, and Ginny hooted with laughter. “Similar situation with the location of the nest.”
“Too fucking hot, mate,” Ron said, which was true, even with the strategically placed electric fans, and a cooling charm that had Hermione written all over it. “Gin’s going to the chippy on the way over, so we only have to have the hob on long enough to fry up a couple of tenderloins each.”
Ministry business, in which case,” Malfoy looked down at his potion, and stirred it until it turned thick and lucent, “in which case my answer will be ‘come back with a court order’.” He paused, looked up again briefly, and added, “and then probably still no after that.”
Merlin’s tits. Draco shook his head. “Yeah, well I am. Traditional, I mean. Not - not seeing anyone.”
“Which bit? ‘Your cock is amazing, Potter, don’t stop’? I’d rather remember that, if you don’t mind.”
The tables were cold glass, the floor polished concrete, and the lighting was a frosty blue-white.  In these surrounds, Draco looked like he’d just Apparated in from one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, hopefully one of the ones where he could have a cool gimmick like a hammer or something, but probably one of the ones where he was an evil blue demon, knowing his luck.
“Are you going to fuck me, or play with me, Potter?” Draco was still breathing fast, and his cock had softened but was still heavy - it wouldn’t take much. Not much at all. Harry’s next kiss was almost a bite. “I’m not a fidget spinner, you know.”
Harry buried his face in his hands, and groaned loudly, and the table cheered and pelted Ron with bits of pork scratchings, and torn up beer mat.
“What’s the use of being married to the Chief Warlock if you’re not willing to abuse the privilege from time to time?” Draco smirked. “So,
Ron’s cheeks bulged, and he swallowed with what looked like difficulty. “Yeah, but I’m clearly incompetent. Wouldn’t it be nice to be a department head?”
“Wicked skeleton.” This one’s hair was really on the borderline - more medium brown than dark, the more Draco looked -  and the eyes were blue and a bit uninspiring. Square glasses. Whoever started
“Perhaps you should let her know,” Malfoy’s face is getting red. His neck was already blotchy. “I hardly think fantasising about what your babies might look like is a sign of two people being over each other.”
Potter was like a new man. He sat bolt upright in his seat, and put away his biscuit. “My place, a take away vindaloo for dinner, and a blow job on the settee while the cricket replay is on the big television, and then I get to fuck you in the shower after.”
“I don’t know! Get me whatever I need to make calls and send those messages. The sooner the better.” He paused. “Please.”
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “I know, you can imagine how awkward it’s going to be for me at work on Monday!” He chanced a look over Ted’s shoulder, and Potter was staring at them, his expression dark. “Better get out there, Ted. Uncle Harry looks ready for warm ups.”
“But seriously though,” Hermione said, sipping on jasmine tea. “Are you prepared to do a Fellowship, if you want to teach?”
“Are you?” Potter turned from Draco’s bookshelf, where he’d been running the tips of his fingers along the spines of Draco’s books. “How long have you had the phone?”
Harry coughed and pulled self-consciously at the hem of his t-shirt, then ran a nervous hand through his hair. “Yeah, sorry. I don’t really have a clue about clothes. I probably should’ve asked Hermione for help. You look-”
“We all made mistakes, mate. I only went and left you two in the forest, didn't I, and you forgave me.”
Potter’s mobile pinged, a little bell-like sound. Draco ignored it, but it pinged a second time, then a third, then twice more. “What the fuck is your problem,” Draco moved to the coffee table and picked the thing up. It was just like the one Longbottom had, and the face lit up with a little rectangle that said ‘Andromeda Tonks’. Draco looked at the door, but there was no sign of Potter yet, and the phone pinged again, persistent. It could be an emergency with Ted. Draco followed the instruction on the glass face, and slid his finger to the right to open it.
Marching down the hallway, he found himself slightly disappointed that the usual authoritative clomp of his uniform boots was missing, as it would have emphasised the air of seething fury he was attempting to exude quite nicely. Sadly, he had chosen joggers and trainers, in a hurry to get in and hopefully back out again quickly, and Prada sneakers lacked the necessary stamp to match his mood. On the plus side, Weasley wouldn’t hear him coming, and if Draco slammed open his office door hard enough without forewarning, the git might even spill his tea on himself.
“Of course we can wait,” Hermione said, in her calmest and gentlest tone. “Let’s find a table and order, and then you can tell us whatever you feel comfortable telling us.”
Blaise sipped his coffee in silence for a long moment. “I’m not sure who to blame for the way we all are. Like, was it Snape? Our parents? Is it something we learned in Slytherin?”
Ron leaned back in his chair, a look of great amusement about him. “When we did Eighth year, Dennis Creevey brought in a big box of photos that his brother Colin had taken a few years before. All sorts of stuff, Den told us we could keep anything that took our fancy. There was Yule Ball stuff, and Hogsmead weekends, just snaps from the Common Room and things. And then,” Weasley grinned widely. “There were his reconnaissance shots for Harry.”
He wasn’t sure whether he was supposed to laugh, so he took a chocolate, and then Lovegood arrived with Granger in tow, and the ensuing chaos pushed the lingering tension, and any further questions about he and Potter, firmly off to the sidelines.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ve cast an Impervius on my clothes, it’s not my first week Potter. I’ve been charmed to the back teeth since I got here this morning, and in case you haven’t noticed, the shit isn’t confined to the Owlery just at the minute.”
,” Ron laughed. “Malfoy will actually kill you, and I’m really looking forward to being best man!” He watched Ron move around the room, pulling the drapes, Conjuring a glass of water - yuck - finding a pair of worn trackies for Harry to pull on once he’d managed to wrest his work trousers off. “Get into bed, mate, you need to sleep this off. Healers said the bruising should clear up in a few hours, but the concussive effect will take a bit longer, and the weird truth compulsion will hang around for at least 48 hours.”
Malfoy had shed his Auror robes back at the office, and had rolled up the cuffs of his shirt, which was white, and had lots of fussy little holes in it. Malfoy had laughed, when Harry had mentioned it earlier, and told him it was something called
“Yeah, he’s with me...is he alright?” Malfoy looked up at Harry, and put one hand reassuringly in the middle of Harry’s chest. He started to feel his heart pick up, a rush of adrenaline in his blood. Something must have happened with Teddy. “We’ll be there soon. Do you need anything?”
wait,” Malfoy spat like an angry cat. “I won’t stick around for it. As soon as they split us up, I’ll take the offer from the Unspeakables, and you can die alone like you clearly want to.”
. I still love her now, she’s one of my best friends. But, erm.” His glass was hopelessly smudged now with sweaty fingerprints. “I started to realise somewhere along the line that I also sort of wanted to…” Harry cleared his throat again.
Hermione blinked several times, looking between them. “Well, I suppose it was my own fault for asking.”
“Only another fortnight, you git.” Draco bent close to the mirror and fixed his hair. “I’ll be home on Friday at four, like usual. You’ll cope, like usual.”
After a little while, Theo took Draco to BT and got him the iPhone, and Blaise went out for macchiatos and brought them back with warm croissants filled with lemon curd, and honey
Draco scrawled little pictures in the margins as he went on. There were several bats, an improbably woolly sheep, and what looked a lot like a cherry bakewell tart.
A small argument erupted about who had broken Harry the most, today and cumulatively over the past twenty or so years, while Harry stared into his now nearly cold coffee. Was he the most oblivious wizard in England? How had be been such a successful Auror? How was he Head of Misuse now? Apparently, he couldn’t see clues that Seamus bloody Finnegan could see when he was barely out of short pants. He should be sweeping up owl shit in the Ministry mail room rather than any sort of law enforcement.
They queued for the Floo, other discharged patients and departing guests looking at them curiously. Ron was grinning widely, too widely for a man who had a visibly battered Harry Potter clinging to his shoulder. “I knew it! This explains so many things from when we were partners. I can’t wait to tell Hermione.”
“From you, you bloody git!” Harry forgot himself and used his wooden spoon to gesture at Draco, causing grains of arborio to spatter on the flagstones. Draco shook his head in what may have passed for genuine disdain to the untrained eye, but which Harry could see was full of teasing mirth, and pulled out his wand to clear up the mess. “The only reason you got away with it was Smith didn’t realise it was you, and I refused to tell them who I was with.”
“Kill…well. Robards, obviously, no need to spell that one out. Marry...Potter.” Harry’s eyes jerked up, his whole entire head hot with blush. Malfoy’s face was full of mirth. “We’re like an old married couple as it is, and I might as well make an honest man of him if I’m going to have to put up with the nagging and lack of sex anyway.”
Draco fiddled with his wand, as Potter did a brief circuit of the room, his fingertips barely brushing the glowing ward field. “What do you need me to do?”
“Sorry. On the pitch, everyone.” He stalked off, whooping kids jumping and running excitedly around him. Draco tore his eyes away from Potter’s shoulders with great difficulty.
Harry’s throat was aching now. Sometimes all you needed to do to manifest a thing, was to name it, but Harry couldn’t name this one. Because, what if he was wrong. He closed his eyes, and wished he wasn’t, and blew out his candle.
Harry tilted his hips, fucking sharply in, and Draco made a noise of pure, sticky pleasure. “I’m willing to test that theory.”
- and the flagstones were hell on both of their knees, but were otherwise clean as a whistle, and most importantly, right there, as they apparently couldn’t hold on long enough to reach a room with a rug, let alone any soft furnishings.
“Red curry chicken and coconut rice, with a double serve of curry puffs because I know they’re your favourite.”
“It doesn’t. Sometimes things just end,” Draco said, his head pounding with the sound of his racing pulse. “We ran our course, and that’s it.”
He looked lovely in this light, hazy warmth around him like a halo from the nightlamps in the hall. He was a velvet silhouette, with green eyes and red lips and white teeth that glistened in the shadow. Draco imagined he could see fine golden hair on those thick forearms, catching the light just so. He could get lost like this, looking at Potter. He had, a time or two. Draco needed to be extra careful about it lately. As time went on, that task was harder. Poor choice of words. More
“I know you did.” The wine here was rubbish, vinegar-dry. The floor was tacky underfoot, the bartop sticky, too. The toilets reeked of a sweet industrial cleaner, and everywhere was the oppressive sour fug of beer. Draco tells her every week that he doesn’t know why they keep coming here, but they both know why. He doesn’t bother to say it now.
was leading, right now, in his softly lit bedroom and his fingers that already brushed over the front of his jeans. But Malfoy. It felt good to want things again, to feel desire, to not know what was to come. Maybe that’s what all this had been about, the last ten years of nothing much. Nobody could argue that Harry hadn’t had more than his share of drama in his life; after school, and Voldemort, well, it hadn’t exactly stopped, had it? He’d chosen the Auror life, four years of intense training, then another six on the job before it had come to a head: take a promotion to Senior Auror, with a five year pathway to Deputy Head, then Head; or jump track to Misuse and live a quiet life for once.
“Don’t think so,” Potter took a long sip from his cup. “There’s been nothing like this in intelligence for a long time, it doesn't seem to be politically motivated. I know we’re only getting started, but I’m not getting the sense this is anything to do with the government.”
Hermione huffed out a laugh and finished off the last of her chocolate croissant. Ginny smiled at him. A bubble of relief grew in his chest. It was all going to be okay, no matter how things turned out with Malfoy.
“Yes...well, you probably know the story, I suppose. It’s been well covered in the press – my tragic childhood.” The ladies clucked in sympathy, swiping away tears with lacy handkerchiefs, and the gentlemen murmured somberly. “Of course, my situation was a bit different to most, but when I think about how something like the Summer Swim program could have changed my childhood experience...making friends, having fun, an escape from things at home. All while learning something valuable like swimming and water safety...well. What was it all for, if not for the next generation of kids, am I right?”
“It’s been about fifteen years, actually,” Ron said. “She’s going to be a nightmare about this Harry, honestly. I’ll never hear the end of it. Every crackpot theory she’s had since first year will be trotted out again as if she’s Nostro-fucking-damus.”
Harry groaned. “You’re a sneaky shit, Malfoy.” Draco had specifically asked for risotto for dinner, as they soaped each other thoroughly in the shower in the late morning (and nearly starting round three as a consequence). A demand for Harry to cook something fiddly wasn’t unusual, but this time it was clearly also a trap.
Draco grunted. His skin was chafing slightly from the sea water. “Nice. Listen, I saw a chippy not far from here, and I’m fucking starving. Let’s pack up the van and get something to eat.”
Ginny appeared at his side, wearing satin tuxedo pants, a blue velvet blazer buttoned once around her sternum, and very possibly nothing else underneath. “Parkinson. Have you fallen on hard times? It seems you couldn’t afford a whole dress.”
“Right-o.” It was a curious sensation, the blunt feel of the dildo butting up against the opening. There was a resistance he hadn’t expected, the dong bending slightly under the force of his push. Harry seemed to have thought it might go in more easily; he used a little more effort, and then it breached, and the dong slid swiftly to the hilt. Harry was pressed shoulder to navel against Malfoy’s back equally swiftly.
“-people kept sending me gifts and things. Like, just ordinary people, you know, but also  business, stuff like that. Sometimes they cried. I didn’t want to accept it all, but I felt like I couldn’t say no sometimes.” Harry looked around himself, helplessly. “I always meant to do something with it all. Not bin it, that would be horrible, and such a waste, but do something good with it. Like, an auction or a raffle, maybe, to raise money for Janus Thickey, or donate it to Hogwarts, or maybe set up a fund and distribute it to families who can’t afford it.” Harry shrugged. “Something good.”
It was a minor miracle that Ginny was still upright and breathing, considering the eye-daggers Hermione aimed at her. She took Harry’s arm. “You tell us what you want to, when you’re ready, and in the meanwhile we can have a nice meal together.”
No matter how or when the vows ended up being exchanged, Harry was all in, til death, et cetera, though he still liked to remind Draco that he’d bounced back from that life event twice already without much trouble. Marriage should be a piece of cake. And Harry loved cake.
Helena’s tits. What the fuck had happened? Weasley knew better than to contact him on leave. They’d had a talk about it. They’d had several. Draco was in dire need of a break and Weasley had promised him there was nothing the department couldn’t handle without him while he was away. “Maybe someone really is dead,” Draco murmured, squinting at the elf again, who remained standing silently by the bed, staring at him.
“Potter,” Malfoy said again, presumably, because he must have said it at least once before in order to wake Harry in the first place. “Your fucking friend woke me up.”
“Yes, famously your heart resides in your knickers,” Pansy leaned over the bar, flashed more than a bit of nipple, and turned back with a fresh glass of champagne in the blink of an eye. “You know how to reach me, if-”
Harry closed his office door behind him and wrinkled his nose at the immediate and sour odour of ink, no doubt originating from the tall stack of files now residing on his desk. If Harry disliked one thing about his job, it was the paperwork; but then, he never had been particularly fond of it, not as an Auror and certainly not when he was at school. What he had learned, however, was that if he buckled down and got it done, he could play for as long as he liked in the lab without various department heads breathing down his neck about late reports. He
“Only normal,” Ron said sadly. “I finished the pot the other night, and it’s been so hot I haven’t been bothered to go out and get another one.”
