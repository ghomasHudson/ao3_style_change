Before he could stop himself, Harry did his best impression of Ron after too many beers. “Wha’ssat?”
The moon had risen to its zenith, shining in through the open window and illuminating Harry’s living room far more than should be possible at two in the morning. Draco stood in one of the only shadows, just beside the doorway. Harry thought Draco might be watching him, but he couldn’t be sure—not because Draco’s face was hidden, but because Harry couldn’t bring himself to look.
The little girl raced up and hugged her. Granger acknowledged Draco with a little wave, and he nodded politely, trying desperately to ignore the comatose elephant in the room.
Plus, he thinks old Dazza who works at the petrol station has been giving him the eye, and after several strained conversations that Harry swears weren’t in English, he isn’t certain he possesses the vocabulary to let the man down gently.
With a flick of his hand, Potter summoned a jar of lube from the nightstand and slicked his fingers before slowly starting to work Draco open. He closed his eyes and tried not to embarrass himself, but before long he was gripping the headboard and writhing beneath Potter’s skilful hand.
It was a horrible, useless circle. They couldn’t get their memories back without the original cursed item, fully intact. They couldn’t get the item without their memories.
Draco noticed with a start that his voice was now entirely normal. More than that—he was smiling. So, it seemed this strange new Potter wasn’t evident in all situations. Curious.
“I doubted you,” he said simply. “I judged you for how little you helped Potter. I was too harsh on you, and whether you were aware of it or not, it’s not something I’m proud of. I want to make it clear that you did everything you could for him, and it’s no one’s fault that things became as severe as they did.”
In the centre of his beacon, there was no light. There was a darkness there that had somehow been darker than shadow—not just the mere absence of light, but an unearthly pit that swallowed the rest whole. When the tiny witch with the bright pink hair had Apparated next to him, startling him out of a trance he hadn’t known he’d fallen into, she explained that it had been that centre that drew her here.
The dust coating on his medical texts was so thick, it floated into the air in giant chunks when Draco blew on it. At age seventeen, these books had been a constant bedside companion as he poured through page after page explaining his symptoms. At twenty-eight, he hadn’t looked at them in years.
As he pulled his shirt down, he glanced up and realised Malfoy had been watching him intently from the door. As soon as their eyes connected, Malfoy looked away hastily and stepped out of the room.
Potter’s kitchen was just as bare as his living room. Worn cupboards lined the walls, their white paint coated in a thin layer of dust—testimony to just how little Potter opened them. Nonetheless, the mugs he placed on the bench were clean, and his tea was the good kind, so Draco supposed the situation could be worse.
“Writhing in paradoxical jealousy?” Draco offered, dropping his hands to Potter’s jeans. “But maybe we shouldn’t do this. There are more important things. And the anchor!” He was quite impressed with himself that his sentences were coming out with even an ounce of coherency. Ten points to him.
with the need to push Potter down onto the bed and explore him with unhurried ease. He wanted to take Potter apart until Potter’s eyes were closed and he’d sunk back into the mattress with the blissful headiness of sex that was poised on the edge of sleep.
Adrenaline overtook Draco’s confusion, and he laughed, breaking into a run before he’d even agreed. Potter easily caught up to him, and they raced side by side, their lingering tears burning away in the wind, gasps of exhilaration and pain and grief turning into laughter as tiredness crashed into them and they fell upon the sand at the base of the finish line.
Harry was deaf to anything anyone might have said after that. It was one thing to know that Malfoy was in it and wanted to keep it going, but it was entirely another to know that he was happy, and that Harry specifically was making him happy.
She knew. Or at least suspected. Thankfully, Potter’s immediate reaction was one of shock. He leaned back in his seat.
“No,” Harry said, feeling himself beginning to soften despite his words. “I don’t. I just—what exactly did you want to do tonight?”
But Potter just mumbled something that sounded like, “I make my own choices, Ron,” and switched the device off, and Draco had to run back to his kitchen before he was caught eavesdropping like a little kid.
messed up. I don’t know how it ties into this ridiculous bet—or even if it does at all—but all I know is that Potter is happiest when he’s with me. He’s happiest when we’re making stupid plans and trying to trick our friends. It’s like it gives him… purpose, I don’t know. Sometimes I wonder if it takes him back to Hogwarts, to the kind of pranks the Weasley twins would play. Like, maybe because it’s so light-hearted, he can shove all the rest of it aside. But I don’t know, Blaise. I just don’t know.”
,” Pansy’s dry tones interrupted them. “Look at these two! What are you playing at, Draco? I’ve known you since you were small and stupid. I’ve seen you try to trick your poor mother into at least three different kinds of sponsorship schemes; don’t think you can fool me like this.”
as Potter gripped his arse and guided him to start thrusting, fucking Potter’s mouth in steady strokes.
Sensing the successful dismantlement of the curse, the wards and the Pensieve began to glow, and the last lingering remnants of the connection between himself, Potter, and the curse ignited. No longer in danger of being pulled in by the curse—no longer needing to disguise themselves as part of it—he felt a burning rush of emotion as the wards came down, tore away the barriers keeping them separate from everything that happened inside the trance, and returned his memories to him.
Harry looked up, trying to read the expression on Malfoy’s face. “Would it be alright if we only did that? Slept, I mean?”
Draco huffed a laugh, keeping his face turned away so his father didn’t see. “As if I’d want to,” he said quietly.
“Because the man was completely socially ignorant,” Draco snapped, pasting on a saccharine smile when the shopkeeper turned their way. “How do you know that he wasn’t teaching to the best of his ability? Perhaps the true extent of his knowledge couldn’t be revealed in any way other than his own annotated textbook.”
“Thank you, Binky,” he muttered, ignoring the faint squeak and pop that signalled the house elf’s departure, and pulled Potter close to him.
“When are you going home?” Harry asks, shifting his hat so at least his face is covered in shade. That’s sun-smart enough. His eyes are closed and he keeps having to catch himself against falling asleep.
Draco shook his head and walked back into the waiting room, where he found most of the Weasley clan huddled around Potter like a red-headed Protego. He slid through a gap between Ginny and Fleur, nodded briefly to Granger, and handed Potter his tea. He wanted to ask if all Weasley’s grieved like there was a punch-line waiting to happen, but a quick glance at the rest of their solemn faces answered the question for him.
“I’ve thought you were a lot of things, but stupid was never one of them,” Harry said, his lips quirking into a grin despite the sorrow dragging his chest to the floor.
“I can’t believe you thought Professor Snape was a bad Potions Master,” Draco muttered, leaning in and smiling so that it looked as though they were discussing something secretive and amusing. “Do you know how many awards he won?”
it. Not witnessed. We didn’t change the past, but it was a shared dream anchored on the crux of a prophecy, which means it was once a possible future.”
He stumbled and felt warm, strong hands steady him. Potter had crossed through the circle and was holding onto him, his full weight falling forward into Draco’s chest as if he could barely hold himself up.
When Draco arrived in France, it was the middle of the night and—fittingly—pouring with rain. The old apartment blocks had changed a little since he’d been here last, but the alleys looked the same. He picked his way over the broken bottles and piles of trash until he reached the dumpsters at the end of the lane. There used to be squatters here, when he’d been here last, but the apartments were cleaner now, trendier, and they didn’t stand for that sort of thing anymore.
“Are you purchasing supplies to break the hellfire curse?” she asked, taking down a bottle of powdered mushroom and setting it in the basket on her elbow.
It appeared in the centre of the kitchen, and he picked up his glass of wine and walked over to it, so he might better explain certain pieces.
The thought that his life might very soon lie in Potter’s hands was both nauseating and disturbingly familiar.
He might not ever know Potter’s love, but Draco could love him tonight. He could show him how it felt to be worshipped not for the pieces of a destiny you’d followed but for who you
Potter had got himself caught up in a Veela soulbond. And like a responsible wizard lover, he’d come straight to his mate’s doorstep to resolve it.
“I guess it must have been too much to finish in one sitting?” Potter suggested, looking unconvinced.
“Let’s just stay in Australia,” Harry murmurs, trailing open-mouthed kisses down Draco’s chest. “We can talk like chavs and get a proper tan. It’ll be great.”
How could he possibly figure out the curse when Potter was looking at him like that? He swallowed, searched for the words, and then swallowed again. It was pointless. No matter how many mysteries Potter kept throwing at him, he had to just shove them away or he’d never be able to focus on the task at hand. It’s not like he was going to get any answers anyway.
“What?” Draco gaped at him. “No—it’s new. It only got set off when Potter ignited the curse and sent me back into fledgling.”
Then, they were all covered in a mass of yellow. The boy stood there, staring up at the house with a dumbfounded expression.
“George,” he said, nodding at the redhead tucked into the corner booth. “Morgan. Enjoying dinner at the Leaky?”
His second thought connected the dots. Mind melds did not allow the alteration of physical boundaries. If Draco had experienced something physical, it was because he had physically been there, transported via a dreamscape. And, given the unusual scope of the dream and that this wasn’t the first time he had dreamed it, had likely done so more than once.
Between the slickness of precum and the smoothness of their skin pressed together, Draco was becoming quickly incoherent as he thrust into the hollow of Potter’s hip. He reached between them, leaving one of Potter’s hands free, and took them both in hand. Potter twisted his hand back to grip the headboard and ground upward.
Draco was prevented from saying more by the arrival of Potter, himself. The doors to the Ministry cafeteria swung open, and Potter stood in the doorway, looking around until he spotted them.
He meant had something happened with Ron, but another meaning popped into his mind and his face suddenly flamed. Potter’s cheeks turned pink, and Draco wondered if it was too much to ask that the dream-state open up a pit for him to crawl into and die.
He hears a faint snicker behind him, but he doesn’t turn around. Somehow, he knows the expression Malfoy will be wearing without having to see it. It will be soft and warm, gentle in the fading light of the evening. He will look at Harry with cautious hope, now that the first of the barriers between them are broken down and they can begin to be open with one another. It will be everything that Harry always wanted.
Seemingly satisfied that everything is packed away, he waves his hand and shrinks the suitcases down to pocket-size.
Malfoy slid back and guided him with a knee to roll over, eyes dark with want—and something deeper. When Harry rolled onto his stomach, almost too sensitive against the sheets so soon, Malfoy braced himself on either side of Harry’s chest and pushed in, slick and hard, without giving Harry a chance to even catch his breath.
. Okay, so Potter isn’t ready to see anyone yet—we don’t even know what the problem is—but that doesn’t mean
With a jolt, he realised Malfoy was watching him too. He quickly turned away, struggling to focus back on the conversation that had moved to how good Parkinson looked in her white jeans, and whether or not Zabini and Bulstrode were together.
But then Malfoy had shown up, and the old flare of anger and restlessness had ignited. He’d always used to feel like that, hadn’t he? Righteous. Angry. Ready to take on the world.
Draco’s hands stilled, clenching the teapot with a white-knuckled grip as Potter charged headfirst into the neighbourly fence of decorum Draco was attempting to erect and knocked it all to the ground.
“You’re doing this deliberately,” he said, keeping his voice slow and careful. “I don’t know why, but you are. And while we’re at it, how exactly were you going to finish that sentence before? You never took me as a what? Because if you’re going to start trying to use—” he trailed off and waved his hand vaguely in the air, “—this against me, what we have, what we’re doing, then… Well, why are we even doing this in the first place?”
The sun shining down on them warmed Draco’s shoulders, taking the edge off the chill that suddenly suffused him. Pansy was never one to let things go, and yet she wasn’t latching onto the drunken bet like he’d thought she would. If anything, she seemed to have forgotten about it.
“I was going to wait,” Harry said slowly. “And I mean, it’s probably bad form to do it at a wedding. But I thought… when are we going to get another shot at being—” he looked around, his eyes catching on the tiny vines that curled around the pillars in the center, covered in strange flowers Draco had never seen before, “—wherever this is,” he finished.
Potter laughed, a little broken, and they fell silent. Just when Draco couldn’t stand it any longer and was about to make his excuses, they both started speaking at once.
“That’s all we really have, when you get down to it,” Harry pointed out, thinking of the two metre distance he was required to keep from people at all times. “Maybe that’s why this one hurt the most; it took that too.”
Potter’s eyes sparkled with mirth. It was just the tiniest bit electrifying, sharing a joke with Potter like this. Even if Draco did desperately wish it were true. He wondered momentarily what the papers would print, if the bartender ran his mouth off.
“So,” Hermione cleared her throat when the silence had stretched on to become inappropriately long and it became apparent that none of them were going to say anything and save them all. “Nice weather we’re having.”
hiding something, and hiding things right now was stupid. Secondly, because Draco didn’t want to think about the fact that he hadn’t cared about anyone like this since…
He’d arranged to meet Potter at the bar that night, just the two of them, so he said goodbye to Blaise and went home to shower and get ready.
“I’d probably be able to tell better if you actually did something other than just sit there,” Malfoy retorted smartly. He must have read something on Harry’s face, though, because he amended a moment later, “Weird good. Keep going.”
Their fingers brushed deliberately as he passed the glass over, and Draco made a point of lingering before he drew away. He glanced at Potter, fighting back a smirk at the way he flushed and looked away. Surprisingly, it turned out Potter was a good actor after all—at least, when they were trying to be painfully obvious. The true test would come later.
They slide together, the room filling with the sound of their soft moans. It always starts the same: they try to stay quiet, years of dormitory life leaving a lasting impression, before their surroundings fade and they lose themselves in each other. Draco’s voice abandons its aristocratic edge, breaking into harsher sounds as he loses control, and Harry forgets the constant mantra to be quiet, out of sight. He wants to be seen by Draco, wants to be filled by him.
He’d just spent the last thirty minutes explaining why he and Potter had decided to pretend they were dating. It had only taken so long because, after their display the other week, hiding in dark corners at Pansy’s party, Blaise had been utterly convinced they
“Oi,” interjected Ron rudely. “What about you? You’ve been quiet this whole time. What’s in it for you, Malfoy?” He was already going red in preparation for whatever he expected to hear.
“Me?” he gaped, incredulous. “What about you? Open up the dictionary to ‘anger issues’, and it’s got your face printed right there beside the definition!”
Draco knew with sudden certainty that he never wanted to be on the other side of Potter during an interrogation.
You may go wherever you wish. I’m not keeping you here. Just pretend I never owled you in the first place. I’m certainly trying to, but some speccy git is creating unforeseen problems in my flawless plan.
For a moment it felt like the walls were closing in. There was something in Potter’s voice, something that was all twisted in upon itself until there seemed no clear way free of the darkness. Was that really how Potter felt? Was that really how the
With slowly creeping clarity, the room came into focus. It was smaller than Draco remembered—emptier too—and the colours didn’t seem right. He sat up with a small groan, rubbing his head where it had clunked against the floor.
It was both practicality and believability that led them to choose the library as the location for their first date. They were able to continue the charade of Potter helping Draco with his security charms by doing research in a public space, but also give the carefully cultivated impression that there was chemistry between them.
Potter turned to him, green eyes wide and guileless. They hadn’t planned this, but it was hardly out of the bounds of what they had discussed. Now Draco just had to get the words out without feeling like he was somehow doing something he was going later regret.
“Did you want to stay for the kick off?” Harry asked, smiling up at him. “Or is this just a quick visit?”
Shifting in his seat, Draco blinked rapidly and forced himself to remain calm. Unfortunately, pathways long dormant in his mind had fired up again, and he found himself drawing unconsciously closer to Potter. Trying to dissect him. Wondering what it would take to turn all that fire and righteousness in Draco’s direction.
“Not anymore.” Professor McGonagall’s lips pursed. “All affected persons have been moved to the Hospital Wing, with only one unaccounted for.”
“Are you sure about that?” Potter’s eyes flashed—again with that curious mix of pain and anger. “Because you went through the plan so many times, I felt like an actual child by the end.”
Harry watches him, and something old and forgotten constricts tightly in his chest. He hasn’t felt like this in a long time, but he must have been a fool to think it was gone forever. The longer he watches, the more the feeling creeps through his entire body. His face tingles with a strange kind of heat, and he quickly leaves and hides in the bathroom before Draco sees him.
Somewhere in the distance, a group of teenagers are playing beach cricket and chugging back tinnies. The harsh cries of “Howzat” float down on the wind, accompanied by the raucous screeching of a flock of seagulls eyeing off a nearby tourist’s unguarded chips. Harry spares one final moment to stare out at the ocean longingly, silently farewelling this sun-kissed land and all the joy it might have held for him.
Draco laid their two wands side by side and studied them. “Phoenix feather?” he asked, glancing at Harry.
The voice comes from down the stairs, in the kitchen, and for a moment Harry’s heart stutters. He thinks back to the last time he heard that voice, only hours before.
“I think you weren’t really looking close enough, Malfoy,” George said, but the twinkle in his eyes showed he wasn’t really angry.
Malfoy pushed Harry’s pants down around his thighs, lifting himself up and back so that Harry could do the same to him, and then he dropped back down beside him, his hand resting against Harry’s hips.
“Draco!” a familiar voice called, and they turned to see Blaise strolling up the path. “And Harry Potter.” He lifted his eyebrows. “You weren’t lying, Draco. I thought it might be code for something.”
Drawing deep on recesses of strength he hadn’t known he’d ever need, Draco finally managed to stop thinking about Potter. The room faded into the background until all he could see in front of him was the set of three brass cogs he had chosen to focus on first. He had decided it didn’t matter where he started—the most important part for now was to get beneath the curse’s outer shield.
Potter turned to him, and as their eyes met, the harried irritation on his face suddenly melted away.
“What do you suggest?” Potter finally asked, leaning forward on the counter as if he didn’t want to miss a single thing Draco said, a single movement he made.
Potter’s face closed over, and the anger Draco had seen just before rose to the surface again. “And I suppose you think you know the answer?”
“No,” Draco snarled, and the tone of his voice was unrecognisable—all pitched and screeching on the edges.
Draco had written those resources out to give to him. There was every chance Potter would tear it up, but at least he would know it was there. It would give him a light at the end of the tunnel, even if it took him years to see it.
Draco snorted at the realisation of how little Potter understood his father’s distaste for impure blood. “Not quite.”
Any second now. Potter wasn’t stupid, no matter what he wanted others to think. He put two and two together better than most.
So many things were a mystery to Draco these days, when only last week, his life had been blissfully dull and ordinary. Perhaps it had been a mistake to embark on this ruse with Potter. It had seemed such a laugh at the time—make people think they were in love, collect on the debt, throw it in Pansy’s face. What could go wrong?
Harry took a sip from the bottle, coughed up most of his insides, and then took a longer pull now that he knew what he was in for. “Don’t really fancy being an Auror,” he said, passing the bottle across the floor to Neville. “Sorry, it’s not much more exciting than that. I figure I can’t go wrong with a Transfiguration specialisation, and I can work the rest out later on.”
If he took a little bit longer than necessary so that his inconvenient erection had faded, it was no one’s business but his own.
Draco smiled at him. It felt like a weight disappearing from his face, like a mask being taken off. “I understand.” He took a breath, tasting the crisp autumn air. “I’m glad you told me.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Maybe. Maybe not. It would have been a help to know for sure when we were approach risk levels, just in case. Particularly with you.” He gave Harry a pointed look. “Let’s face it, Potter, you aren’t exactly what one would call Balanced.”
“Did whatever it was have to do with Malfoy?” she asked kindly, and Harry sent her a grateful smile.
“Just don’t move,” Draco suddenly says, just as Harry is contemplating flipping him over and exploring the valleys of his neck. “I have one more surprise. I think you’re going to like this one.”
At first, he thought he’d tumbled from a pleasant dream into a nightmare until it came back to him. He scrambled for his glasses on the bedside table and blinked repeatedly until Malfoy’s face sharpened into view behind the lenses.
Draco’s mind went back to the other night, when Potter’s rage had seemed to surround them, buried in the walls like embers, and all he’d wanted to do to resolve it was fuck Draco’s brains out.
“No, I just don’t really fancy hanging around here all day. I’m not the most well-liked among the centaurs, you know.”
Draco couldn’t find it within himself to laugh. What the hell was going on with Potter? He looked down at his glass and found he’d already emptied it, compulsively sipping and sipping while Potter talked until it was all gone and he hadn’t tasted a drop.
It would mean both he and Potter had to give up the chance to re-engage with their lost memories, passing up the opportunity to recall an experience that few wizards had the opportunity to see, but—much as he hated to admit it—there were more important things at stake.
“Yeah,” Harry admitted lamely. “Them.” He shook his head and soldiered on. “You’re one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and I love watching the way you just lose yourself in what you’re reading, like you’ve suddenly found hidden treasure.”
Malfoy’s face was so blank it was starting to become scary. The fact that he couldn’t read it even a little bit, with all of his practice practically living in Malfoy’s pocket lately, and with him trying to be more expressive, made Harry’s skin feel like a million ants were crawling on it and his stomach go wobbly.
There was something about that—no hugging allowed—that stirred a memory in Harry’s mind. He knew what it was, knew why it hurt. Didn’t have the space to examine it. So he ignored that too.
Music filtered around him, emitting from the walls thanks to one of Pansy’s clever entertainment charms. He thought it might be one of the songs that had played that night, which explained his little trip down memory lane. Though, if he was honest with himself, he had known tonight was going to be a mess no matter what he did. His thoughts were too full of Potter, too full of the increasing unease that something was building beneath their feet—an explosion waiting to happen.
Draco felt certain he was intruding, but a pointed look from Morgan told him to stay seated. She entwined her fingers in George’s and squeezed gently, the two of them sharing a look of such deep affection Draco felt something hollow inside his chest cry out in longing.
“I was searching for something for Millicent’s boys for Christmas,” she said. “You know how I like to get my shopping out of the way early. So, I went by that Weasley shop in Diagon.” She smirked suddenly, hiding it with her glass. “I was a smidge before opening time, it turns out, but they’d forgotten to lock the door on their little pre-work celebration. They were quite abashed when they realised I was there, but the cat was already out of the bag, so to speak.”
In retrospect, he was surprised it had taken him this long to realise he was falling in love with Potter; he had only ever been a hair’s breadth away from it in the first place.
There was almost a peace in that. Peace and a fierce, aching, sadness that Harry thought might never go away.
He sits up and tilts his hat at an angle so he’s still protected from the sun but can study Draco from beneath the brim. Draco is pretending to read a magazine—a fact made obvious by how he’s been staring at an advertisement for sanitary pads for going on three minutes now.
“Some of them were difficult to move, but since we still don’t know what we’re dealing with… we thought it best to confine… the items.”
He dropped his head into his hands to hide from the shock on Potter’s face and spoke into the space between his fingers. “You need help. You’re sick.”
Harry looked up to see a shrewd expression appear on Malfoy’s face, his eyes flicking to the balcony, only to vanish immediately. He blinked, but Malfoy was the picture of innocence.
Six months ago, Harry would have burst out laughing at anyone taking Lockhart seriously. But since recovering his memory, the man had proven oddly useful. It seemed that taking the time to relearn basic human necessities had meant he learned a few other things as well, and his return as the Potions Professor had been… normal. Sound. A good decision.
Draco was working his way through his neglected pile of correspondence, when Potter showed up in his fireplace.
But he had a plan now; that was something. It was a better plan than the ridiculous mess of the last weeks, that was for sure. He was no longer going to pretend there was any way he could handle this on his own. He was going to do away with this stupid façade of a fake relationship and tell Potter what he really wanted, whilst making it clear that Draco’s biggest priorities were respecting whatever boundaries Potter put into place and getting him the help he needed.
He glanced down at the bag by his feet. His planner was at the bottom, filled with pages and pages of scribble about past therapy sessions and upcoming dates. He had three sessions booked; he could make all of them with a pre-arranged Portkey.
Draco scoffed. “I’ve asked twice now! You’re refusing to answer because if you actually told me then you wouldn’t get to brood and claim the moral high ground.”
They never did. His great aunt Tremidia had sprouted wings whenever she got into a spat, which was frequently, but Draco remained wingless. The beak his great, great, great grandfather Vermillion had claimed as an eccentric mask worn only on the new moon served as little more than a cautionary tale.
Potter watched him, quiet and intense, as though he could read Draco’s thoughts. “I can’t turn back time and take you with me,” he said. “But I wish I could have. I wish I hadn’t left you there. I left you under Voldemort’s control when you’d saved me by refusing to recognise my face, and I…” He trailed off, looking confused and lost. “I’m sorry.”
They stare at one another. In the span of several heartbeats, Harry imagines Malfoy storming out, pushing him away, even hurting him in the sudden onslaught of fear and insecurity that could so easily guide his next moves. He holds his breath, fingers still loosely grasping Malfoy’s hair, too scared to pull them away.
“Were you having trouble focusing today, Harry?” Hermione asked, concerned, when he’d sat down at dinner. “I saw your parchment was blank for most of that session on bimodal seedpods.”
“You’re being totally unreasonable!” Morgan’s voice reached their ears as she began to shout. “What do you think he’s going to think of you now? Going to welcome you into the family business with open arms, you think?”
George nodded slowly before tilting his head down to look at Morgan. “And you didn’t want me to meet your brother because you didn’t want me to know you’re fae?”
Malfoy stared at him, his pointy face suddenly sharp and cruel. He opened his mouth to say something, and then Harry watched as that same restraint and caution Malfoy had been using these last few weeks kicked in and he pulled himself back. But he didn’t apologise.
“I think I know why the curse started to play up last time,” Draco said when he’d caught his breath.
George eyed Kalen, one arm hooked around Morgan’s shoulder. His face was unreadable, which was surely not a good sign.
Weasley caught sight of his reflection in a newly scrubbed pan and began rubbing furiously at the soot on his nose. “Exactly,” he said, his voice slightly muffled as he pulled his sleeve across his face. “If you let guilt rule you, you’ll never move forward. I learned that after Fred.” He cleared the spot and turned back to face Draco.
“No,” Draco said icily, stepping away from the table. “Don’t think I will, Pansy dearest. Enjoy your night.”
The parchment gave a little shimmy and split in two, one half fluttering into Malfoy’s hands just as a pair of quills and a pot of ink floated over from the Professor.
—that it wasn’t going to be easy to resolve. When he thought of the way that Potter’s face shifted from superficial happiness to blind rage to that terrifying mask of apathy and back, all in the span of a night, his chest tightened with so much fear he almost felt like he was back in the middle of the war again.
“You’re… surprisingly pleasant… as well,” he managed, ignoring George’s bellowing laughter and Morgan’s one-armed hug.
Malfoy’s voice jolted Harry out of the strange train of thought he’d fallen down, and he frowned, trying to parse sense from the words. “About what?”
“Magical mishaps are a bit of a rite of passage with us—welcome to the family, little brother. Now, what if—”
As he closed the gate behind them, a puff of pink smoke wafted through the chain link, and Potter furrowed his brow in alarm.
Potter grunted, apparently annoyed that he had overlooked something that Draco hadn’t. Draco mentally chalked up a win, and then he put it out of his mind and focused on their surroundings.
The thought thrummed through him, bitter and dark. Things could always be worse; it had no bearing on the intolerability of the present.
He had looked away, so he didn’t see Malfoy’s exact reaction, but the inhale that followed his words was sharp, and he could almost perfectly imagine Malfoy’s eyes widening, his nostrils flaring, the way his mouth might have fallen just the tiniest bit slack in response.
“He said he didn’t want to be with you anymore?” Ron’s voice is gentle and soothing, full of the pain that he feels for his best friend.
He wonders if Draco ever ate lasagne at the Manor; somehow, he doubts it. There’s always something a little sheepish in his expression when he eats it, like he’s expecting his father to walk in at any moment. Even after all these years, the sheer normalcy of it seems to give Draco a little thrill, and Harry lives for those moments.
A strange look crossed Potter’s face. “Wait.” He picked up a previously abandoned text and flicked through until he obviously found what he’d been looking for. “Curse words.”
For a while, there was nothing but the sound of gentle whimpers and breathy sighs. Harry's awareness was narrowed right down to the sensation of Draco's strong fingers gripping him, sliding against his cock with slow reverence. And then the world came rushing back with glorious heat when Draco stiffened and gasped, dropping his head to mouth at Harry’s neck as he came. Harry cried out—realised that maybe he’d been crying out for a long time, that maybe he was actually a good deal louder than he had intended—and thrust upward into Draco's hand, sliding against oil and the increasing wetness of Draco’s come until he was spilling over too.
Potter shook his head. “I hadn’t seen you for months when the dreams began. I don’t think so. And I studied them for years before I stepped foot on your property.”
There was silence for a while, and then Potter asked, so quietly Draco almost missed it, “You mean like a gift?”
Draco had been seen in public with Potter before, but there was something different about this. Usually when they were seen together it was in a group. They would stand on either end of their strange collection of friends and shoot insults at each other over everyone’s heads. It was safe, normal, expected.
“Don’t want to make it too easy for you.” Draco’s eyelids fluttered closed, and Harry watched, enthralled, as several emotions passed quickly across his face. He bit his lip, clearly trying not to moan. “Merlin, Harry, move faster, will you?”
She nodded at that, taking in the words and just absorbing them without commentary. For half a second, Draco had fallen in love with her, just for the simple reason that she had been given the opportunity to weigh in on his life choices and had chosen not to.
Draco had appointments all of the next day, and half the day after that, so he didn’t see any of his friends until lunch time two days after the fight. They acted like nothing had happened. Even though it suited their purposes, since they clearly didn’t suspect anything was up, a part of him strongly objected to their apathy.
“About all those things you promised,” Harry murmured, fighting to concentrate on the words. “Are they still on the table?”
. The words remained unsaid, but Harry heard them all the same, felt them somewhere deep in his chest that ached to return them.
Objectively, Potter was his best chance. He could always ask another Unspeakable, but even when he’d thought that his only option, he’d been hesitant. He’d worked with several Unspeakables before on smaller matters, and he never got along with them. They knew too much about him—or he felt like they did. No matter how essential it was that they remove their personal lives from their work, he’d never met one who could, not where he was concerned. He didn’t trust them to hold the spell. He didn’t trust them to anchor him without having that small moment of indecision, that one tiny moment where they looked at him and thought
It must have been only a moment later that Malfoy walked up to their table. Harry, who had been facing away from the door, didn’t see him coming, and so it was only by the way the table hushed unexpectedly and Ron went bug-eyed across from him that he knew anything was up.
That was when it hit him—the thing that was bothering him about Hannah’s reaction. She had certainly responded as he’d wished, but she hadn’t been responding to the game. They hadn’t even been playing at that point. They had been so deep in their argument that they’d entirely forgotten to act out any believable chemistry. Which meant that Hannah had thought they acted like a couple simply because… they acted like a couple.
“Pansy wants a pub night,” he said, standing and retrieving his clothes from where his spell had Vanished them. “She closed a major deal today and wants to celebrate.”
To Draco’s horror, Potter’s voice broke on the final words. He wondered distantly if he was about to see him cry. The cold, clinical walls of St Mungos were oppressive and bleak; Draco could think of nowhere worse to spend your final days, lying in a coma before dying on a surgery table. At least there were no barbaric practices like in Muggle hospitals, with knives and skewers and whatever else they jabbed inside you, but it was a small relief.
“You’re still wearing a shirt,” Malfoy pointed out, his fingers trailing up to tug at the buttons of Harry’s pale blue shirt.
For a moment, he thinks about telling Draco all the things he was never able to explain: the cupboard, his fear of small spaces that prevents him using the Floo, the way Aunt Petunia would scream and scream if he so much as put a plate back in the wrong place. Draco might still want to change the furniture around, but at least he’ll know why Harry doesn’t take it well.
This time, the room materialised far quicker, and he didn’t have the aching head he’d had yesterday from the fall.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not messing with you. The curse is mine, so we just need to work out how I can rescind it.”
Potter opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. Then, he looked at Draco with an odd expression that made Draco’s heart race.
know. It wasn’t your area of expertise, and you’d known him for so long that there was no reason for you to think to look deeper. It’s not your fault.”
Morgan and Potter rushed to him, holding him, telling him it was over, long over, but when George looked up and met Draco’s eyes, they were cold and empty. Nothing like this was ever over, and they all knew it.
“It’s a surprise, yeah,” Potter said, shrugging off his coat and holding out his hand to take Draco’s. “I’ve only been here once, but it made me think of the Gryffindor common room.”
“I don’t think I even really did before,” Harry continued, shaking his head incredulously, “but now that I can’t, it’s like… it hurts. It physically hurts that I can’t touch people. How bloody stupid is that?”
Draco shivered at the words, unable to fight it back in time so Potter wouldn’t notice. To the untrained eye, it would appear they were simply having a conversation, pressed close together to be heard over the sound of the music. Bloody ironic, really, since that was exactly what Potter was avoiding.
“Malfoy,” Potter said abruptly, wetting his lips and looking nervous. He paused, and Draco waited expectantly. “If you’re Veela, shouldn’t I be… well… falling at your feet or something?”
He’d crept around his property after midnight for Merlin’s sake. Would it have killed him to knock on the door once and say,
Potter suddenly frowned and looked around the room. “Why would a curse that was bound to an ancient symbol manifest as something modern and mechanical?”
Potter opened the door to the bedroom, and Draco took it all back—first, he was going to buy a bed. He was going to buy a king-sized four-poster bed with thousand thread count sheets and the softest duvet money could buy.
As he glanced up at Potter, he was struck with an overwhelming surge of longing. Potter looked different somehow. Draco’s eyes were drawn to the smooth planes of his face, and he thought he almost knew how they would feel under his fingertips.
His bones ached; he must have been out here for hours. Potter rose behind him, dusting down his trousers and staring at the sky with a calculating expression.
“They couldn’t just put me in a tent by the lake, could they, Potter?” Malfoy spat, shouldering his way past Harry. He was just as pointy as Harry remembered him; he rubbed at his chest where Malfoy’d struck him and turned to follow him into his—
Thankfully, he seemed to be in somewhat of a benevolent mood today and took pity on Harry’s obviously frazzled nerves.
“You don’t understand,” Draco said in painfully polite tones. “I didn’t have a hickey when I woke up this morning—I’ve had no occasion to
Draco pocketed the vial and checked the time. “There. Still ages until dinner. We could go and check in with Professor Slughorn, or…” he trailed off.
Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, a sheepish look crossing his face. “Sorry.” His voice was rough. “Is that better?”
The redheaded boy who had been desperately trying to levitate his broom was eagerly helping Emily with her commands. Squibs tended to vary for how well the brooms responded to verbal commands, and it seemed Emily was one who would have to control it on her own. As he watched, the redheaded boy widened his stance, held his hands out dramatically with Emily’s hands hovering in the air above his, and yelled “UP!” so loudly that they could hear it from the stands.
It took a second or two for Draco to register the rise in volume in the conversations around them. By the time he had, the Patronus had already reached them. A beautiful wolf skidded to a halt in front of Potter and howled.
Carefully, softly, he began to place small kisses along his jaw, down his collarbone. Harry felt strangely tense—not in the sense that he wasn’t enjoying it, but simply because there was something different about Malfoy’s movements, something that made him want to melt back down into the covers and bring Malfoy with him.
When he stumbled through into the surprisingly sparse living room—a mystery for another day—he was faintly shocked that the wards had let him through at all. Then, he spotted Potter sitting at the kitchen bench, the light from the lamp barely reaching him, two thirds down into a bottle of Ogden’s Old.
Malfoy’s quill scratched somewhere in the background while Harry leaned over the edge of the balcony and stared blankly at the succulents arranged below it. There was nothing he could do, and that felt like shit.
The crowd surged to their feet, and Draco took his cue to go back and join the parents waiting on the side lines. One mother was standing on her own, her hands clutched around a steaming cup of coffee, so Draco stood with her.
Potter snorted, though his face turned quickly sombre once again. “Look, Malfoy, I really am sorry about yesterday. I don’t know how to explain it except things are kind of complicated right now, and I’m not expressing myself well, and I didn’t mean to lash out at you.”
Draco mutters something sharply under his breath that sounds an awful lot like “Fuck it,” and then he throws the magazine across the balcony and straddles Harry in one swift move.
Pansy continued to watch him, her expression giving nothing away. “We could arrange for a holiday,” she said thoughtfully, “if you think it might make a difference. Or would you still be unable to let it go?”
“Should I dress up in my Hogwarts robes, then?” he muttered, searching for levity. “I think I’ve still got the tie somewhere.”
Nathan had been wonderful, but they’d ended on bad terms. Nathan had insisted Draco was using him as a “fill-in” for what he couldn’t have. Draco had called him a self-obsessing idiot, and that had been that.
“Right,” said the first one. “Is that it, then? We’ll get a curse breaker on scene to remove and secure immediately.”
He did not need to ask to know the past had not been changed. His two opposing memories of the war ran alongside each other, but one was visceral, imprinted in the scars left behind on his body and the weariness in his hands. And the other was the golden memory of a dream, something that never happened.
He opened his mouth to offer a Sober-up potion, but Potter had already grasped his hand—eyes oddly glazed and intent—dragged him into the corridor, and Apparated.
Draco felt hands on his shoulders pulling him back. He fell into the person holding him and began to shake.
It was like second year all over again. Frozen people everywhere, and no one knew yet if they could be saved.
, Malfoy? Maybe if we can find the specific prophecy that started it, then we’d have a shot of undoing it.”
The shelves of the apothecary were so dusty, Draco had to tie his scarf around his nose and under his eyes just to be able to breathe. As such, it took him a few moments to notice the woman beside him, and a second more to realise she was laughing at him.
Draco closed his eyes and focused. He could feel the curse working against them, trying to disorient them until all the parts of themselves had fallen away and were lost, no longer able to remember how they ever fitted together.
Draco had no idea how he’d never seen it before, except that he mustn’t have been looking; none of them were. But now, he was, and he couldn’t escape it. It was everywhere.
Malfoy’s eyes roamed his face and down his torso one last time before he hummed lazily and retreated to the other side of the room. Harry watched him go unabashedly, admiring the pale curve of his arse until it disappeared behind a new pair of pants.
Then it shifted, and he thought for a moment he was back in his own nightmares, in the memories Potter had stirred up by talking of borrowed wands and drastic measures. But he couldn’t be. These dreams were Potter’s.
His hands fluttered to his jacket pocket and then down again. Draco felt the slow rise of anticipation spreading like warmth through him.
Then, he closed his eyes and pushed aside all the thoughts and memories he didn’t have the energy to think about. He’d keep them hidden for another night at least, and then, when he was able to find someone who could help him, he would let them all pour out.
It was a slow trajectory through the air, the eggs sailing in a beautiful wave towards the space where the wards began. A sound like cracking glass surrounded them, and for one shining moment the boy’s face was alight with triumph.
Except he hadn’t. He’d gotten away early because the file clerk had stuffed up, and the department wasn’t able to release any paperwork until the morning.
Draco and Harry leaned closer to the window to watch. Down below, a group of kids were huddled by the fence line with several cartons of eggs in their hands.
With an aching heart and blurry vision, Draco stood up and navigated a path to the bookshelf so he could research his newfound predicament.
They fell into a comfortable silence, shoulders brushing against each other occasionally but for the most part they were separate, enjoying the company but lost in their own worlds.
Reaching up to grab him by the back of the neck, Harry pulls him back into a soft kiss. “Can’t you do that thing you did to the shoe?” he mumbles against Draco’s lips.
The room fell awkwardly silent. Potter stared mulishly at Ron, some kind of wordless communication happening between them, while Draco discretely but firmly mutilated his palm with his nails to distract himself from the possibility of just Apparating out of this whole situation.
Pansy jabbed a finger straight into his chest. “That’s what I’m talking about—that, right there. You’re obsessing over Potter again.”
“She isn’t all you have,” Harry protested. He didn’t say she wasn’t gone. “You’ve got your parents, you’ve got—”
Shock cut through his anger and left him reeling. “Get hurt? How on earth am I possibly about to get hurt? Potter’s going to help me with my security problem, and while that’s happening maybe he’ll realise he can actually come and talk to someone when he loses his temper instead of being abandoned by the people who call themselves his friends.”
Potter sat. Their eyes met and the furrow of Potter’s brow eased somewhat; a fact that signified how quickly the curse was moving, and served only to raise the tension in Draco’s shoulders.
Draco blinked, trying to process what response would be required. “Why not try for three?” he asked faintly.
Harry follows the sound of waves to the beach across the road and sinks into the fine, white sand. This is the life. This is relaxing. This is what it means to not have people hounding your every move and breaking into your house because they’re convinced the scar on your head makes you a great shag.
“You can’t,” Draco agreed, his mind already whirring with ways he could pick up the project and keep it running. “I’m glad you’re leaving.”
If they took the second box and fused it with the psychical inhibitor from the original, they could overlay it with an echo so that the spell was just confused enough by the familiarity to let them in like nothing had changed. It would be like using a carbon copy.
“Because I think I’m falling in love with him,” Draco’s voice cracked and broke, and suddenly his eyes felt embarrassingly wet, even though no tears were falling.
He made a strangled noise, shook his head a little, and said, “Thought I must be in the wrong place.”
“So, you became an Unspeakable to do what they wouldn’t,” Draco guessed, the words sending shivers down his spine.
Draco glanced over at the crowd of eight years olds huddling excitedly in the centre. One of them had got their hands on a spare broom and was already trying to levitate it. His red curls whipped around his face in the wind, and his cheeks almost matched his hair with the exertion of how hard he was trying to make the broom jump into his hands.
Draco allowed himself to smile, ignoring the slight shake of his hands and the way Potter’s eyes were dark with something other than shadow. “Except when I step in. This Sanctuary is home to forty-seven peafowl, six hippogriffs, eighteen Thestrals, twenty-three chickens—don’t ask—and one unicorn. There were more peafowl at one point, but, delightfully, many went home.”
He ran the tiny wand over the space above the cogs, feeling for the slightest shift in air pressure that would indicate a weakness. The wand was attuned to the smallest movement, but even with its advantage all Draco could feel was smooth resistance. He had been hoping he could at least slip beneath some of the curse’s defence mechanisms without risk, but luck did not appear to be on his side.
“Absolutely not, you complete pillock. We need access to your stupid archives in case this thing is worse than we thought. If you go and die on us, I’ll have to put in an application, and then you’ll be wasting my time even in death—I don’t think I could stand the gall.”
“Do you need to go through the procedure?” he asked, feeling a perverse need for Potter to say ‘yes, please, Draco, guide me and hold my hand’.
“Don’t. Ask,” Draco reiterated, doing his best not to recall the sheer panic with which he had survived those first few months with his new flock.
Mind Healer Scottsbury had long since drilled into Draco’s head that humour as a coping mechanism was rarely acceptable if one was in company, and yet it still took all of Draco’s willpower not to make a dick joke. Not that Potter would likely have noticed; the man was barely coherent. Draco set to work making the living room habitable for the infirm, lighting a fire with his wand and setting the kettle boiling and an all-purpose tincture pouring with a few more well-placed flicks. He had no idea what Potter had done to himself, but if he’d come
They stared at one another. Malfoy’s face was open and honest. Harry had no idea what his own face was doing.
They both looked over at the box, but none of the wards had broken, and none of the diagnostics indicated anything had changed.
Draco turned in time to see Potter racing off to another corner of the room. He looked back to Granger and Weasley, but they were deep in conversation, so he had no choice but to jump to his feet and race after him.
“Why does this have so many fucking buttons?” he growls, hands tearing at Draco’s miniscule white buttons to no avail.
His entire body cringed in embarrassment, and he moved to take a step backward, but suddenly Malfoy’s hand enclosed around his wrist, and Harry couldn't breathe.
“I’d like it if you stayed,” Harry said, reaching for the bottle of Firewhiskey he had left out the night before and Accioing two glasses from the kitchen. “But only if you want to.” He held up the bottle, raising his eyebrows in question, and waited.
Harry nodded furiously, gasping as his hand ran across the tip of his cock, twisting around the sensitive head. Malfoy smiled a little crookedly, his breath coming quick and shallow, and lowered his wand.
It was quick work this time, after so much practice, finding Draco’s prostate. He massaged it relentlessly until Draco was gasping and moaning obscenities at him, writhing down onto his hand and begging for more.
He nodded, but just as he stood up to get back to work, Potter reached out and grabbed him by the wrist.
His head snapped up. He caught sight of his reflection in the crystal cabinet: his eyes were wide and crazed, the candlelight sending erratic shadows dancing across his face. Surely not. Surely it wasn’t
“How long has it been since you left the Sanctuary?” Potter asked suddenly, catching the Quaffle with ease and lobbing it straight back to Draco’s chest.
Potter’s eyes darkened, sending a wave of heat in Draco’s stomach rushing south. He could see why Blaise had taken so much convincing; Potter was a far better actor than Draco had realised.
The sound of violent hammering on his door the next morning sent him stumbling to answer before he could even think about a hangover potion. For the third time in as many days, he opened the door to Potter with the smell of alcohol wafting between them.
Draco thought of chandeliers shattering, scratching his face as the meaning of Dobby’s words sank in.
Harry barely even waits until he’s home before consuming the sweet. It’s chewy and tastes a little like cabbages, but he is already salivating the second he pops it in his mouth, eager to experience the latest ride that Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes has to offer.
“Malfoy!” The voice broke through his mounting rage, and when Draco turned to study the room through the leaping blue flames of retribution, he found his mate kneeling in supplication at his feet.
“Come on, Harry. Do you really think that Draco sodding Malfoy would stay in a relationship he hated?” Ron asks, giving Harry’s wrist a little shake and grinning.
Something tugged in Draco’s chest, a sensation he was familiar with but had never really followed before. Whether it was from exhaustion, or desperation, or the possibility that, somehow, they still lingered in the dreamscape with Harry holding his hand and pulling him forward, Draco followed it. Veela flame flickered across his vision, tingeing the world blue, and he saw the knot in his magic that was tied to Harry’s.
Harry fell to his knees between them, running his hands along Draco’s calves, his thighs, his hips, and waited for permission.
Potter laughed, an odd look in his eye. “No,” he said, glancing at the device on his wrist and jerking his head towards the door. The herbs must be done. “No, my house is very quiet,” he added, chewing on his lip thoughtfully. “Most of the time, there’s only myself for company, really.”
The next few weeks were like a dream, but it wasn’t the murky, uncomfortable dream he’d lived for so long, the one where the only thing he could do was wait for it all to shatter apart.
Draco grinned, speeding up a little and pressing deeper, firmer, until Potter gave up attempting to keep quiet and just gave over to the sensations Draco was giving him. Light traces around the hole made Potter squirm, pressing forward until he was practically fucking himself on Draco’s tongue, while long, flat swipes made him fall back, loose, onto the sheets. His legs went slack, all the tension draining away, and his constant litany of swearing turned into something more languid—soft moans that vibrated through his whole body and made Draco’s cock jump.
Draco reached for his magic, grimacing in anticipation, and found the same sick guilt he always found. “Yes. Look, if I could heal this I would. But this isn’t how it works—neither of us have custodian flocks to heal. Or any other group of animals. Our magic damage is purely in our bodies.”
Blaise’s eyes were steady, his expression gentle but impassive. “You’re playing against him like he’s some skilled opponent you’re trying to outwit. Really, you’re meant to be working on this together. If you’re terrified that taking action without his approval will ruin what you have going on, along with any chance to help him, and if you already know that what you have can’t last in its current form, then you only have one option left.”
They spent the rest of the evening going over the books and picking out bits that seemed interesting or that they might like. It was hard not to get excited at the thought of experiencing them very soon, and it was difficult to not kiss Malfoy right then and there and start something. That wasn’t the point, though, and he felt that if he had tried, Malfoy wouldn’t have stood for it. Probably. It was hard to tell with Malfoy. He’d been more than eager last time.
“Longest three hours of your life, I’m sure.” He pulled her into his chest and patted her hair consolingly.
He felt a strange familiarity at the urgency that was building between them. It made him think of Quidditch games, racing side by side for the snitch, or even of arguments where they were standing two feet away from each other, each desperate to gain the upper hand. Funnily enough, he didn’t care who had the upper hand right now, and when they both began to slide their palms down each other’s chests, reaching blindly for buttons and zips, panting into each others mouths, he felt a momentarily overwhelming sensation that they should have tried this earlier.
The second George disappeared, he moved casually over to Potter’s side of the room to cast a couple of diagnostics on the wall. He managed to resist the urge to cast them on Potter.
“Don’t act like you don’t know we’re divorced.” Harry points out, rolling his eyes beneath his hat, visions of the words ‘Silver Fox’ outlayed in crimson bursting through his mind. “And there’s no need to be a misogynistic twat about it. Ginny’s her own woman and she controls no one but herself.”
“Therapy can take years,” Eleanor said when he expressed this to her. “And our relationship will change over time. We try to stay vague about this at the start. Can you imagine how you would have felt in those early days, if I’d told you there would be years of this?”
Tan fingers reached across the table and squeezed Draco’s hand gently. “Absolutely,” he agreed with a warm smile. “Whatever you need.”
Now that he was looking closely, Draco could see how bloodshot Potter’s eyes were. There were dark circles underneath them, and although he was alert, his body seemed to sag.
Rose led her parents off to see Molly and Arthur, leaving the two of them to take their seats. Harry nodded his head toward the best man, who was standing beside George in front of the alter.
Draco scoffed. “Care? About the Weasley brood? Absolutely not. About upholding the credibility and reputation of my name and profession? Of course.”
Potter made a noise similar to a dying chicken and tried to explain himself using several words simultaneously.
His voice was casual, but something in it made Draco look up. His posture was stiff, the leather jacket sitting awkward and bulky on his shoulders. He remembered suddenly his confusion when Potter had walked in that morning.
“There’s no room. McGonagall only commissioned a few dorms to be available for us; the rest are being cleaned and having their spellwork refreshed. It’s why we can’t use the common rooms at all.”
There was probably something pathological about the twists and jumps Draco’s mind had done to take joy in this situation, but since it presently involved Potter being wrong, he didn’t question it.
Draco turned to see George standing to the side. The tall woman’s arm was around his waist, so Draco assumed they must be dating.
With a jolt, Harry removed his wand from its holster in his sleeve and handed it to Draco without hesitation.
“It could change their views,” he said slowly, eyes still on the parchment. “They’ll have to work with half-bloods and Muggle-born families, and they’ll have to do it right or the Ministry won’t sign off on their work. They’ll have to get to
“A fire fighter,” he said, not looking away. Someone shrieked with laughter on one of the floors far below them, the sound carried up on wind that tasted like smoke. “My aunt and uncle used to tell me that my parents had died in a car crash—a horrible wreck of cars and flames—and I thought… I thought if I was a fire fighter, maybe I could have saved them.”
Draco had watched Harry tell the story, watched the way his face lit up with pride and triumph and love, and he’d realised suddenly that everything had worked out. He still saw Eleanor, and Harry regularly met with a variety of Mind Healers and rehabilitation specialists, but they had weathered the worst part of the storm and come out flying.
He swallowed. The future opened up before him, and Draco suddenly felt more scared than he had in years.
Kalen cleared his throat, looked at his feet, and then forced himself to look up and meet George’s eye.
He fell back into easy kisses, light and eager, until Draco was filled again with heat and pushed Potter back down on the ground so he could palm him more easily. They stayed like that for several moments, Potter moaning and pushing into his hand, the layers of fabric between them growing wet.
After the party, he and Potter made sure to keep their distance for a few days. They wanted to give people time to speculate, to guess what might be happening between the two of them. Someone had obviously gone to the press, since articles in the
The seconds before she turned back to them passed like years, and Draco felt his stomach sink right down to the floor. Not now. Please, not now.
It was over in seconds. Never one to shoot down anyone’s throat without warning, Draco tried to pull back, but strong, insistent fingers held him there. And when he spilled over the edge, cock pulsing in the wet heat of Potter’s mouth, Potter moaned with pleasure.
Draco shook his head. “It would seem I was in a rush and forgot.” The world seemed to slow around them, his voice sounding distant and faint.
When it was clear that he’d finished, Draco lifted himself up so that he was propped on one elbow, looking down at Harry with an unreadable expression.
And the nature of the item made it very clear what the curse’s purpose was: something was inside the box, and unlike obligatory gifts and misguided festive cheer, this
Draco was struck by the firm, unyielding belief that Potter could not remember Blaise’s name. He grinned.
All at once, Malfoy pulls away, steadying himself against Harry’s hips and looking up at him. His breath comes in rough pants, and his pupils are blown wide with lust. Yet, the expression on his face is not one that Harry would imagine on a familiar lover; it is shocked, rapturous, and a slow flush creeps along his neck and chest.
For a long moment, they just stared at each other. The strange openness and borderline interest from last night was entirely absent, and they were back to their usual distaste and rancour. All the possible ways this could play out flickered through Draco’s mind in the space of a minute: polite, stilted conversation; social niceties; formal workplace procedures. Or, the more likely scenario: screaming matches reverberating off Silencing charms until they drowned in their own vitriol.
each other. I don’t know what she was thinking—sticking you two together. I reckon one of you’ll be in the infirmary by the end of week.”
“Believe me, Ron,” Potter said sharply. “I know Malfoy’s the wrong sort. I’m not about to forget that.”
The smirk on Draco’s face grows wider until he’s grinning. To his surprise, Harry finds himself smiling back.
He cleared his throat, trying to think how to turn Potter down without rejecting him. But even as the idea of going ahead chilled him, something inside began to sing, calling out to Potter, begging him to come closer because
“Perhaps I’m giving her a little too much credit.” He twisted his expression into something like wry amusement, when in reality, his heart was beating so fast he thought he was going to be sick. Something wasn’t right here, and he just couldn’t figure out what it was. “I’m sure if we play it carefully, we might have a shot at winning.”
Even he snorted at the blatant lie in that one, startling a resting owl on the sign beside him into taking flight and showering him with cold droplets of snow that he probably deserved. His life was a mess. But then, he’d been given the chance to study an area in his field that no witch or wizard had been given for hundreds of years, and in return, he just had to take the teensy tiny problem of developing a crush on the least available wizard of his generation. Surely, it was worth it.
“Right,” he said, snatching the parchment off Malfoy and sitting down. “Welcome to Orienteer’s Orienteering,” he read aloud. “A well-rounded team knows itself in and out—it’s time to get to know your partner. Have a go at guessing your partner’s answers yourself, and then compare results. The answers might surprise you.” Harry looked up at Malfoy with an expression of dread. “Surely we can just skip this part.”
The sound broke through his dreams, snapping Draco wide awake in his bed. He sat bolt upright, staring at the moonlight on the opposite wall and shivering as he remembered how it had felt to survey the ground with murder pulsing in his veins.
“Do we need you to swear an Oath?” Potter asked, one eyebrow raised. “We didn’t realise Parkinson had heard anything, or we’d have made her swear one too.”
“How does it feel?” Draco asked, his accent even sharper than usual as he watched Harry’s hand slide up and down the length of Harry’s cock.
It was the cue for them to transition their study date into something more serious for the watchful eye, but Potter regarded him for several moments more before he finally nodded and began to pack away their books. Draco tried to ignore the curious faces that turned their way as they cleared away the mess they’d made over the last couple of hours. He knew the other patrons would gossip as soon as the door was shut behind them. He knew they were paying attention to every little detail—noting how close Potter was standing to him, watching the way Potter held out Draco’s coat to him, helped him juggle his books and scarf.
He knows exactly what he’s going to dream about, now that there are no Weasley brothers waiting for his report with knowing winks and friendly ribbing. When he had been testing the line, he had felt compelled to daydream the most innocent of fantasies—strictly missionary, wine & dine first, Mills & Boon approved. Nothing that would mean he couldn’t look people in the eye afterwards. Now that he is alone, he feels no such obligation. And after the week that he’s had, he intends to make sure that for one magical hour at least, he can forget everything.
He watched the front photo loop back on itself for a moment until someone cleared their throat behind him.
“I didn’t know things needed spicing up?” The uncertainty in his own voice is so painful he has to close his eyes, but Draco doesn’t seem to even notice.
Draco crossed the room to the mantle and tried to turn the hourglass onto its side, like the right-hand one. But it wouldn’t move—obviously. “These must represent the three phases.” He ran a hand through his hair. “It’s found us compatible, and once this phase concludes, the execution will start.”
. You’re acting like this is the first time you’ve ever met me. For all that you’re a sanctimonious twat, Potter, you’ve never let me get under your skin like this before. What has you so worked up that you can’t even be in the same room as me?”
Well, damn. Wasn’t that just a sentence that begged clarification. Draco closed his eyes and counted to ten, forcing himself to swallow down the insatiable need to know more about Potter, always more.
Harry did. When he’d buried his finger in as deep as it was going to go, he started pulling it back, fascinated by the drag he could feel inside Malfoy.
had him shuddering and clenching his arse. “I can use them on you if you want, but I don’t think I want any of these things in me.”
“I got your owl,” Potter said, still in that same tentative voice he had used last time they met. “Are you sure about this? It seems a bit… rushed.”
“That’s a rather inelegant way of putting it.” Draco sighed. “But unless you have any better plans?”
“That symbol was etched into it as a kind of repellent to the Fae. They can’t pass through doors where it’s written, or hold objects that are etched with it, which is why the witch carved it into the wand when she stole it. They tricked the step-daughter into scratching it against her thorns while she was an enchanted rose and stole it then, condemning her to live out her days trapped there while her lover married someone else. Of course, the enchantment was broken and she won back her beloved Roland, but I’ll never forget the faces of the Fair Folk in the story as they taunted her and stole back the wand she’d tried to hide from them.”
“Speaking of,” he said, the words muffled as he was still halfway through chewing, “Could I get your help with something, Malfoy?”
“Oh for fucks sake,” he mumbles, leaning back and scrubbing at his face. “S’too early for that rubbish.”
Harry bit his lip to avoid commenting on the innuendo, but then he looked up and saw the heat in Malfoy’s eyes, and he realised with a jolt that Malfoy was flirting with him.
“And does the Great Harry Potter have a plan to appease this nesting mother?” Draco couldn’t resist asking, rankled that Potter had come up with so many ridiculous theories without ever thinking to ask for his help.
Harry grins, turning away and pulling out ingredients at random; he’s still in a bit of a daze. “I guess they don’t work when you already have your heart’s desire.”
Potter’s eyes held his for the longest moment, like he was studying Draco—curious, interested. It felt real, even though Draco knew it wasn’t. Then, he nodded and the moment passed.
Having few other options, Draco followed him into the kitchen. Potter looked around, clearly about to start rifling through cupboards, so Draco stepped in. He found a bottle of aged mead on the top shelf and poured two glasses.
“I’ve got to go,” Potter said reluctantly, sliding his glass back across the table. “Work’s calling me in early tomorrow. Got to run through a new operation.”
Normally, Draco was the kind of person who tore clothing off in seconds. He loved the sheer beauty of the naked body. Man, woman, anywhere along the gender scale—he loved to admire the unique differences of the human form. The valleys and peaks, the beauty of shadows on skin, of sheets pooling around limbs. He loved it all. But tonight, he was so consumed by touch that he couldn’t begin to think of what he might see if he opened his eyes.
“I know the procedure,” Potter confirmed when the silence had stretched on too long and Draco didn’t know how to break it without starting an argument. “It’s my specialty.”
They met up with the Weasleys again, and before Draco knew it he was being shepherded into the hospital room with Potter. He tried to object, but it sounded rude, and by that point it was already too late.
that he was more than just a brute with an overabundance of luck? How dare he prove he was capable of more than blindly pointing his wand at targets and exploding things at will?
This dream didn’t burst. Draco still felt like he was floating, drifting through the air in some kind of perfect haze, but his world was no longer narrowed to one man and all the problems that lay there with him. It expanded from Potter outwards and drew the whole world in.
Harry can’t help it; he begins to laugh. Three days of sun and drinking catch up to him, and soon he’s sliding halfway down the deck chair and laughing so hard tears are leaking out of his eyes. Draco reluctantly joins him, his own laughter quiet at first until he loses control and is cackling just as loudly as Harry. Harry can’t even find it in himself to be mad at Hermione because, in truth, he suspected something like this would happen. There’s just one thing he doesn’t understand.
Nothing happened. Potter continued to stare at him with that same broken, wretched expression, and neither of them moved, chests heaving as they stared one another down, and his charms Did Not Work.
Draco took him in, relishing the taste of sweat and arousal and clean man that filled his mouth. Above him, Harry’s breath came in rough pants, interspersed with Draco’s name in a tone of voice that made him feel like a god.
“I…” he began, searching for the words to stop this before it began, and then trailed off, feeling every inch the fucking coward he was.
When he finally turns back around, his eyes are wide; Harry thinks he can see shock and fear there, but there is something else too: longing.
Harry nodded, and, with meticulous grace, Draco uncorked the bottle and poured it over Harry’s cock. It was warm and viscous, like oil, and Harry barely had time to register the pleasant tingle of it before Draco lowered himself over Harry, wrapped his hand around both of them and pumped slowly.
Still, he knew that Draco understood. It was in the tightness of his hands, the urgency of his lips and tongue, the desperate groans that kept spilling from his throat. And if Draco somehow missed all that, it was in his words as he said it again and again, mouthed it against Draco’s skin, his neck, his collarbone.
“I recall how you sat,” Potter mumbled, mopping the last of the sweat from his brow with his sleeve and closing his eyes. “Like you had a stick up your arse.” He snapped his eyes open again. “Oh look, you’re doing it now.”
“Merlin, you really were sulking when you came into the workroom this morning, weren’t you?” Draco drawled. “You didn’t even notice the package was unwrapped.”
Harry tossed back the gin that Malfoy had bought him twenty minutes ago—it burned on the way down—and left.
“I’m not sure I’m quite ready yet, if you want to go again,” Harry said hesitantly, but Malfoy was already shaking his head.
The scent of strongly brewed coffee wafted through the house, and Draco bit down on his tongue—hard—to avoid giving a moan of appreciation.
“You could’ve splinched us!” he protested, but Malfoy only laughed and stumbled away, sitting down on the edge of roof and swinging his legs over the side of the building.
“Not stupid.” Malfoy’s voice sounded strangled, and when Harry looked up, he swore Malfoy was standing closer.
He nearly stumbled when Potter’s eyes met his. The unsteady Apparation had left his hair even wilder than usual, sweeping across his face and shadowing his eyes. If he didn’t know better, he would have said Potter
It was too much, and suddenly all he could think about was how much of a farce it all was. He’d been so anxious to get it right, for it to be perfect, and here he was: slipping out of Draco every other stroke. It was too funny. He couldn’t stop the laughter as it spilled out of him, and looking at Draco was only making it worse.
He first touched Malfoy’s stomach with his other hand, splaying his fingers wide and just feeling the motion of his breathing and the sporadic twitches as he moved at a quick, unrelenting pace.
George shrugged. “No one knows. It’s driving Ron crazy,” he broke off, his face a sudden mask of undisguised pain.
, but Draco maturely ignored it. He waited for Potter to continue, still not certain how Potter had thought feathers were the answer to the Veela Curse.
“But when those behaviours overlap so much with the signs of something more serious,” he hedged, watching closely for her reaction. “How do you know where one ends and the other begins?”
After a few seconds where Harry scrambles to his feet and backs away to the window, he discerns that three intruders have invaded the room and are fighting to get through Draco’s weakening shield charm. The frantic racing of Harry’s heart fades as he realises they aren’t trying to hurt anyone. At least, not in any way they recognise as pain; the result is subjectively different.
moments of weakness since this whole thing started. I’m beginning to think you’re just one big limp noodle.”
There was something in his voice that made Draco swallow whatever quip he might have made and just listen.
Draco’s mouth fell open as he stared up at the enormous house. He was positive it was held up with magic alone; there was simply no way a building could lean like that on its own. Flocks of tiny birds swooped around the uppermost tower, building nests in the alcoves from the bits and pieces they’d salvaged from the front yard. Even from this distance, Draco was sure he could see a nest made out of a Gryffindor scarf.
Harry chokes a little on his own spit and clears his throat, feeling more wrong-footed by the second. “Um. I’m Harry Potter?”
“The key is to make sure that the group you’re trying to help don’t suffer for the inclusion,” he continued, “because you’re right—those crime statistics need to be addressed. We just need to sell it right so that the marginalized group is given preferential treatment
Draco waved a hand. “Not you and I, obviously. But I need an anchor. The spell hasn’t been used in centuries—it hasn’t been needed. It’s highly complex and involves dissecting the spellwork while engaging in something like a meditative state.” He grimaced a little, his mind wandering to several readings he’d done on the process. He knew he was rambling, but he couldn’t make himself stop. The whole situation was just so unbelievable. “You enter a dream-state where you can see the curse manifest as something physical and tangible, like tree or a wall or something that can be analysed. But, of course, to do that you have to trick the curse into thinking you’re not a threat, and the easiest way to do
“No leads. The only other thing I didn’t already know is that the curse can be cast unconsciously, but since the Veela probably sensed me cross its territory line and cursed me without thinking, I don’t see how that’s helpful.” He gave Draco an odd look. “But I can recognise the Veela in you now.” When Draco turned back, Potter had moved closer. The fear was still there, but curiosity had joined it. “What if we tried to draw your Veela blood out?”
Harry moaned, the sound longer and lower than he intended. As Malfoy settled back on the ground, leaning against the door in the middle of the roof with his long legs stretched in front of him, Harry found a place to stand. He leaned against a tall metal box in front of Malfoy—it probably held the power for the building—spread his legs, and unzipped his fly.
So he resigned himself to the knowledge that, for now, all he could do was give Potter space. He’d wait a few days and then check in with Blaise. It killed him to leave Potter alone so long, but he was in good hands—better hands than Draco had proven to be.
His voice was broken, catching on the syllables like a sob, and out of nowhere Draco was bombarded with long-repressed memories of the Battle of Hogwarts where—he found out later—Potter had chosen to die, and had then come back only to find it still hadn’t been enough to save everyone. He felt a tearing sort of pain in his chest, and he staggered forward to cast spells over the circle, trying to figure out what had happened, where they’d gone wrong.
The harsh, urgent side of him piped up, pointing out that by doing so, he had lost Potter. Was it worth it? Was he a better trade than the Boy Who Lived?
“Don’t!” Draco whirled around and glared at him. “You’ve said your part, now do as you like to so eloquently put it—shove a sock in it. What am I looking at?”
“I don’t think forgiveness is about right or wrong,” Draco said slowly, staring at the feathers growing up his forearms. “It isn’t about being just—it’s the opposite of justice, actually, Potter—wrap your Gryffindor head around that one. It’s separate from it. Forgiveness is just something you offer. If you want to.”
“I wouldn’t have thought the Weasel had it in him,” he commented, handing the glass over and watching as Harry took a tentative sniff. His eyebrows lifted in amusement at Harry’s expression. “You don’t drink gin?”
Draco looked up at her, but instead of the suspicion he expected, he saw only concern. “Fine, fine,” he said, waving a hand. “Work has just taken off lately. You know how it goes.”
As he fell asleep, his thoughts shifted into something new. The urgent voice faded and the gentle, compassionate one took over. It assured him that what he’d had with Potter wasn’t a trade. There wasn’t a finite amount of love, and he wasn’t some consolation prize compared to the Boy Who Lived. They had built love between them in whatever messy, stilted way that they could. The only thing that remained to be seen was where they allowed that love to go—to themselves, to each other, or to everywhere it was welcome.
He felt Potter melt back against him, and then he was turning, and Draco was pushing him back against the bench and kissing him.
And then they tumbled from their broom, and Potter kissed him, pressing him against the wall and holding him with a desperation Draco recognised in himself, and Draco realised it didn’t matter what Potter noticed after all because the courting had worked and neither of them were lost anymore.
Suddenly, Draco’s uncertainty was drowned by a flood of rage. They were Potter’s friends, and for all they knew Potter had just exploded—irrationally and full of pain. It was obvious something was very, very wrong, and they were just going to let him isolate himself for days?
The Veela waved its hand, and the middle of three hourglasses Draco had not noticed before turned over. The one on its right was suspended in the air, horizontal, its sand not yet ready to fall.
Draco moaned, covering his mouth with his fist and biting down in an attempt not to give them away. He didn’t know if anyone still lingered after the match. But soon enough, he gave up his attempts for control and just let the sensation consume him, every touch and caress driving him closer to the edge.
“There’s a hidden balcony up the stairs and down the end of the corridor,” he whispered, hating himself with every word he spoke. “I’ll meet you there in two minutes.”
He couldn’t quite connect to the idea. It didn’t feel real. So much so, that he was still trying to find an appropriate expression of joy when Potter emerged from the shower, clothed in loose black pyjamas he had borrowed from Draco and towelling his hair.
Harry cries out, gripping Malfoy’s hair so tightly it must hurt, but from the sounds it draws forth, Malfoy isn’t complaining. Never in his wildest dreams had Harry allowed himself to imagine these filthy noises, but the realisation of what is actually happening right now seems to have broken something inside of Malfoy. His perfect restraint has gone, and he moans, long and loud, as he sucks and licks Harry, keeping him right on the edge.
new things. Draco doesn’t seem satisfied with anything anymore, and Harry wonders when the penny will drop and Draco will realise he isn’t satisfied with Harry at all.
“Good?” Draco asked above him. He was holding him by both hips, massaging small circles with his thumbs as Harry got used to the sensation of being stretched.
Several chickens scurried past his feet, breaking up the conversation as they dove at the vines of peas lining the yard and began to jump up at the leaves, pecking at the fresh pods in unbridled delight. Draco scattered grain around the garden, turning his back very deliberately on Potter—who seemed to be stewing—and led the way back out onto the path.
“Easy now,” someone was saying. “No one’s coming here, Malfoy. You can strengthen the wards, do whatever it takes.”
“I took a wild guess that the peacock keeper would manage just fine.” Potter bared his teeth in a smile, watching Draco over the top of his coffee mug. “Do you want to know what the plan is?”
“I think they’ve thought of that,” Malfoy said mildly. “All right, Potter. Let’s get this out of the way.” He studied the parchment and began to jot down his answers.
For several alarming moments, the strange room around them seemed unfamiliar. Draco stared at Potter, seeing only confusion on his features as he looked around at the walls that appeared to contain the contents of every clock known to wizard-kind.
“Good for you,” he said placidly, fingers drawing lazy circles on his hip where they rested. “Takes a lot of courage to come out of the closet.”
Blaise’s brows had drawn together in confusion, but he didn’t interrupt. Draco tried to distract himself by staring at the ornate ceiling of Blaise’s second drawing room, but even the gold-flecked paint on the architraves made him think of Potter—Gryffindor gold. More importantly, it made him think of how Potter used to be, and how much that wasn’t the man he was now.
Harry led the way over to the centre of the pitch. The grass crunched beneath their feet; it smelled as if it had been recently cut, and the scent mingled with the rich scent of hot food that carried over from where the mums and dads were hovering in the stands.
“Malfoy, look, I know you’re trying, and I’m glad. It might be nice to get to know a Malfoy who isn’t a prick through and through.” He ran a hand through his hair distractedly, taking stock of what Malfoy’s face was doing. He’d started pinking again, though this time probably not from embarrassment. Harry rushed on, trying to beat him to the punch if only to avoid an argument and so he’d still be in time to grab a slice of toast if he was lucky.
Harry huffed a laugh, slightly offended, but before he could say anything, Malfoy suddenly put down the quill and turned to face Harry properly.
Draco shuddered. “I stopped feeling my magic a long time ago, Potter,” he gritted out, admitting something he hadn’t wanted to think about until the last of his debt to Fate was paid. If he reached for his magic, guilt and sorrow came with it. It was better not to reach at all. “It’s there when I need it, and that’s all that matters.”
“Which feather do you like best?” Potter asked, peering around the glass to stare at him with an eerie intensity.
It was amazing the curse hadn’t noticed them—a testament to Potter’s strength and skill, to be sure, and Draco didn’t even have the energy to be annoyed.
Beside him, Potter did the same, sighing with relief, teeth chattering. It was easier to see, down by the water, where the ocean reflected the moonlight. He watched Potter stare out at the infinite expanse of sea before turning to glance at him, a strange light in his eye.
Granger had tried to ask him what he knew at first, but she’d quickly given up. Draco wasn’t about to share Potter’s secrets, especially since he’d never given them freely in the first place.
He opened his mouth to resume their conversation but was struck mute by the fury in Potter’s eyes. For a moment, he expected Potter to get out of his seat and march over there, wand blazing, but he didn’t. His face twisted into something horrible, and then he turned away and slouched against the counter.
Potter nodded, and the woman gestured for them to sit down. “Thanks to your message, Mr. Malfoy, we were able to locate the source of Mr. Weasley’s mysterious illness.” She held up a small, metal object, the size of a pea.
Draco watched Kalen and George laughing and joking together, and he was filled with a quiet sense of sadness for everything they had lost along the way, all of them. George caught his eye and smiled, waving to both he and Harry, and they waved back.
“Well…” All amusement faded so abruptly Draco had whiplash. “You’ve changed the future before. Don’t forget, Harry—you still don’t know what you’re dealing with. Veela are creatures of fate.” His voice was loaded with so much meaning, every cell in Draco’s body vibrated with the need to decode the mystery before it leaped out of the shadows to bite him.
“I don’t suppose you ever really do,” she admitted. “But we’ve spent a lot of time together. I think I’d know if something was wrong or if something had changed.” She leaned forward suddenly. “Draco, are you up to something?”
As his racing heart began to slow, Draco was left wondering why it felt like he’d just lost something very important.
it. The burning need beneath his skin had consumed him, and eventually he’d reached a limit on all that he could achieve with her. But this new part… this slower, more accepting part… he thought he might be able to work with that.
Still, he didn’t know what Potter thought, didn’t want to rush anything when it was still so new and meant so much.
He didn’t see Potter for about a week after that. Occasionally, they’d pass each other in the corridors at the Ministry, and there was an aborted mid-week lunch attempt with the five of them, but everyone was simply too busy to do anything more than a quick greeting.
Potter ducked behind the garden doors and stood in the shadow. Draco rather thought this was getting a bit ridiculous, but he followed all the same. Apparently, it was not a moment too soon, as a tall, blonde woman immediately emerged and looked around the garden, eyes piercing. She eventually decided on the far corner and set off down the path.
He straddled Harry, Vanishing the mess of with a wave of his hand and sliding their mouths together with unbridled desire. He kissed like it was the first time, like it was the last time, and Harry drowned in it without ever thinking to come up for air.
Blaise laughed, eyes lighting up with warmth and affection. He squeezed Draco on the shoulder, and Draco leant into the touch, just for a moment. It was grounding and real, and he needed that.
He wasn’t sure they’d let him in, since he wasn’t family, but as it happened it didn’t matter. Five steps into the foyer, and he found Potter pacing up and down in front of the entrance to the Spell Damage.
“I have a place in England.” Draco’s glance slides away. “A home, a job. I worked hard for that. I had to face a lot things I’d rather have run from just to exist.”
Draco snorts. “Fucking Gryffindors. Fine. I followed you here because Granger let slip that she was worried about you. However, it seems she was misinformed about your itinerary—”
You giant, insufferable twat. Luna tells me you’re going to bribe Draco Malfoy into letting you stay and follow him around France. Firstly—ew. Secondly, do you really, truly think that Luna—
Draco shook his head. “You’re mad. I think we should commit you once this is all over.” He squinted at the words. “Kalen O’something—sounds Welsh, but it’s too smudged to make out. Actually, no I can read it. It’s Kalen O'Fearadhaigh. Followed by the profound words: Sweetheart Rolex. Roland.” He froze, recognising the next symbol just as the words clicked in his mind.
someone. Always try to come up next to them. We’ll have a few accidents—we always do—but that’s all right because what are we doing?”
“No—” Draco’s tone grows sharp, pointy features twisting into something familiar and cutting, but before he can answer, the door to their hotel room bursts open and chaos ensues.
Draco had tried not to let the obvious teasing get to him, but his body had other ideas. Just thinking about the words and their casually flirtatious tone made his heart race, his skin tingle with anticipation. He told himself he was just starved for affection, but he knew it was a lie. He knew something was building inside him, as much as he tried to pretend it wasn’t.
Harry shut the door and crossed over to his own bed, sitting down so he was facing Malfoy. Finally, Malfoy looked up.
Harry thought that Malfoy would sit with him at dinner, and maybe he could try to bridge whatever bizarre gap had opened between them by bringing him into the conversation with everyone else, making it less about the two of them and more about Malfoy being a part of the group. Because maybe that was the problem? They’d just been spending too much time together, and Malfoy was getting snippy that he was forced to act like there was something more than their casual fooling around going on, like they were friends.
Draco let out a long, slow breath. Potter might be closer to some semblance of normalcy than he had been yesterday, but he still looked like he’d just leaped off the back of a motorbike while it was still moving. How did someone like that become an Unspeakable? Everything about him—his beaten-up leather jacket, his arrogant slouch, his untameable hair—screamed brawns-no-brain. And yet, even Draco was finding himself forced to admit that Potter was hiding a level of intelligence with unknown depth.
Draco’s words cut through the silence, and the room fades away. Harry is dimly aware of everyone leaving the meeting, but he can’t tear his eyes away from the expression on Draco’s face. He can’t see anything but the way Draco is staring at him, bursting at the seams with love and affection. He was a fool to ever doubt it.
And it seemed Draco appreciated that, liked it even. It had surprised him. Harry wanted to keep surprising him.
Since the explosion, the Aurors had come through and swept the place for evidence, leaving only a shield charm around the remaining packages.
It was as he was falling asleep that Harry realised he had found one small thing he could do without fucking up. Powerless over everything of importance, he could still water a succulent and watch the bees collect pollen.
“Did you find anything useful?” Draco asked, opting to ignore Potter’s vulnerable admission in the same way one might attempt to win over a wild animal by not looking at it straight on.
At the end of the corridor, two bluebirds landed on the balcony surrounding the landing and chirped. They obviously didn’t know about the quarantine. Thankfully, it didn’t seem to affect them… yet.
Draco’s eyes snapped open and he sat up to regard Potter, who was sitting several feet away from him and looking as breathless as if he’d just run a marathon. Neither of them spoke.
“I’m not good at this, okay? This…” he floundered, looking for the right word, “Closure and trying to get along thing. I’ve been told I’m pretty clumsy when it comes to people, but if you want to give it a go, I want to try, alright? Maybe we can be… I don’t know, friends? At some point?”
But he’d said he would worship Potter—all of him. So he stepped back and ran his eyes over Potter’s figure, relishing the hitch of breath he received in return, the strange hint of shyness. He put aside his feelings for the night and focused on the man before him.
Draco was hard-pressed to deny the owner of such a welcoming smile, even if she wasn’t exactly his type and was remarkably more demonstrative than he was used to in acquaintances. Ignoring his usual voice of restraint and warning, he nodded, ordered a glass of wine from Tom at the bar, and sat down.
Potter groaned and obliged, his hands gripping Draco’s hips so hard he was sure to leave bruises. Draco dropped a hand down between the wall and his cock, gripping himself and sliding up and down in smooth strokes. He was close, and judging from the urgent sounds behind him, Potter was, too.
“Um, so, I need some feathers,” Potter said sheepishly when the contents of Draco’s crystal cabinet failed to occupy him any longer. “Also, I can’t get your front gate to work—is there some trick to it?”
Potter nodded. “Beyond that, I don’t want to talk about it. Can you accept that as the answer, Malfoy? Or is it still going to distract you?”
“Right,” Draco huffed, laying out his apparatus on the floor. He selected a tiny wand—the size of a chopstick and used for locating the first loose thread in a curse’s shield—and picked a wall at random. “Then just focus on keeping us anchored and shut up.”
Somewhere deep down inside, Draco knew Potter wasn’t insulting him—the lowly peacock keeper hosting the Unspeakable—but it still felt like it.
He still wasn’t entirely sure how they had gotten here, to this. When he thought about the individual moments that had led here, it didn’t add up. A few conversations under the stars, a dance or two, fingers on skin—it was an equation that didn’t make sense. But perhaps it had always been something more. Draco viewed it as waiting, but Harry didn’t see it like that. Waiting was passive and stagnant; they had been building something different, something new.
“I’m surprised,” he said carefully, not wanting to start up an argument when everything seemed to be going so well. “I thought you’d, I don’t know, have questions or you’d be against it or something.”
“Are you just going to stand there all day, or are you coming in?” Potter didn’t even bother to turn around.
Draco yelped at the sudden cold of the metal, but the sound died—transformed into an embarrassing moan—as Harry dropped to his knees and took Draco into his mouth.
“You mean, all those pure-blood lines, they’re connected to the earth as well, they just don’t know it?”
Harry felt a rush of affection towards his friend as he realised that Ron was making an effort to include Malfoy in the conversation. He froze, wondering why the hell he cared.
Harry suddenly realised what they were all talking about, and he felt his ears grow hot. One look at Ron, who had his hand clamped over his mouth trying not to laugh, told him he’d just heard it too.
“Tell me what to do,” Harry demanded, shuddering as another wave of pleasure coursed through him. “Please.”
Harry dropped his head back on a gasp, his fingers entwining in Draco’s hair and pulling almost unconsciously. “Yeah?”
Draco opened the bag of pastries, selected the largest and took a bite. He let the sweetness pool on his tongue, filling his mouth with the delicious mix of chocolate and pastry. It was rich and light and real.
Potter looked at him oddly, before reaching out to take the inhibitor and turn it over in his palm. “Funnily enough, no. Though I did just buy mine. Why? Do I smell like a tree?”
Harry pretended to join in with the others as they laughed and made increasingly ridiculous jokes, but really, he watched Malfoy. Their eyes met several times, and each time Malfoy’s gaze was just as sharp as if he hadn’t drunk at all. He needed this, Harry realised. He needed to think that no one was watching him closely, that he was more alert and prepared than anyone else. That way, no one could catch him unaware.
He knew instantly that he had gone too far. The colour drained from Potter’s face, leaving behind tightly controlled rage. A distant part of his brain acknowledged that it was a testament to just how much Potter
Potter ignored him. “We went in to make sure we hadn’t missed anything. Then, we came out early, and didn’t leave any important notes to ourselves. Logically, it was probably fine.”
“I’m home,” Harry calls, his voice remaining steady even as his knees feel weak with the enormity of what he is pretending.
The part of him that was still in full-blown flight mode after their ‘fake’ argument flared into life the second he saw Potter’s face. A thin sheen of sweat covered Potter’s face, and his eyes stared blankly ahead. If Draco didn’t know better, he’d think Potter had just been tortured.
” Potter snapped the book closed triumphantly. “It’s a Veela blood curse, which makes it a prophecy, and prophecies have words. What are the
They had never really done that, had they? He knew how Malfoy played quidditch, what he looked like when he was taunting someone, even what he looked like when he was terrified for his life, but he didn’t really
“We’ve only got about an hour left of the potion before we wake up,” he said, his voice coming out rough. “I’d better get to work.”
“Tell you what,” Pansy said, wiping away several tears with a napkin. “If you two ever manage to pull off a relationship, we’ll all have dinner at
“Something happened that night,” Pansy went on. “I’m still not sure it isn’t some big scheme of yours, but I’m beginning to think that less and less.”
It wasn’t the fast, urgent prelude that Draco was used to when he took men home from the bar. The heat simmered below Draco’s skin, begging for an outlet, but he refused to rush. He wanted to savor this, to capture every moment in his memory. Potter’s eyes were heavy-lidded now, and it wasn’t just with desire. They were both a little tired, a little lethargic in a way that made Draco
Draco had said he’d learn to live with him, and, well, Harry was quite alright with that. He could learn to live with Draco, too. Though, maybe not without insisting he wear socks to bed.
They’d have to start with an investigation at the scene of the crime, just to make sure there weren’t any lingering effects he’d missed, and after a moment’s indecision he decided to invite Potter. It was better he was there, just in case there was something in the Unspeakable archives that rang a bell.
But Draco was watching him with a fierce resolution, his body simultaneously relaxed and full of new tension, and Harry knew that he had made up his mind.
Harry gasped, his eyes rolling back in his head as his cock began to pulse in his hand, growing slicker and somehow harder as he stroked it and sent white ribbons of come shooting across his stomach. All the while, Draco watched, eyes dark and heated as he whispered quiet praise under his breath.
“Don’t burst my bubble, Malfoy.” Weasley closed his eyes, a blissful expression overtaking his face.
Malfoy gaped at him, for some reason unsure of how to answer. Harry was just about ready to take it as a ‘no’ and reassure Malfoy that he was still happy to be friends, or whatever the hell they were, when Malfoy pulled himself together and visibly relaxed.
He rolled them carefully back and stared in horror for several moments. He could feel Potter shaking with laughter beside him.
Perhaps he could at least work out what it was and get a message to McGonagall. Then he could confer with whatever expert they actually needed. Be a third party go-between or something.
As Potter groaned and stretched beside him, Draco couldn’t help but feel he looked different. There was something about the hard set to his jaw that looked familiar now. Or… Draco frowned. Not familiar, but… recognisable. Something. Like there was a secret there that he just couldn’t quite remember. It made his chest ache, and for the second time in as many days he had to catch himself just before he reached out to hold Potter.
Seriously, Malfoy. Do we have to keep wasting time like this? I’ll tell you what you said when you agree to meet me. All this writing is making my hand sore.
The words seem to echo in Harry’s ears as he tries to process what Draco is saying, and then his heart swells with such an overwhelming burst of love and affection for this man before him that his knees feel weak and he nearly stumbles from it. Draco’s answer isn’t what he expected at all, and he is relieved. There isn’t suddenly some part of Draco that Harry hadn’t known existed, that Harry couldn’t satisfy. Draco is still his.
Draco snatches the book out of the witch’s hand and throws it behind him, but she’s relentless and charges forward with slapping hands instead while another takes her place with her own book. Behind the intruders, a hotel clerk wearing double denim emerges in the doorway, wild-eyed and frizzy-haired, yelling something about “ya fuckin’ drongos!” and giving chase like Benny Hill never went out of fashion.
“‘Romance’, he says,” Malfoy grumbled, but complied all the same, shimmying further onto the bed and making a space for Harry to crawl onto after him.
“The fight after I cheated,” Draco murmured, wishing he’d taken a moment to get rid of both their shirts.
“You make it so easy to forgive you.” Potter looked up at him, and at last the rage had given way to what was beneath—fear. “Is this Fate, trying to pull us together again? Or do I just want to forgive you this badly?” he whispered. “What if you’re the wrong person to forgive?”
“It wasn’t meant to go on so long!” Kalen whimpered. “It was meant to spit him straight back out, not bring him to me.”
“Go slow. You wouldn’t want to get too carried away and end it before we even begin, would you? Since this is new.”
He ran a comb through his hair, slowly slicking it back and then tousling it until he looked some semblance of put together. He imagined Potter doing the same thing on the other side of London. Imagined the dark bathroom with the flickering light, the way Potter’s eyes would turn haunted whenever he looked in a mirror and thought no one else was watching.
having sex for real, was overwhelming, and several times, he had to reach down and give himself a squeeze when he got too excited and thought he might come right then and there, just from fingering Draco and seeing and hearing him respond. Soon, he had three fingers thrusting in and out.
Draco cleared his throat, as uncomfortable as if this fight was genuine. Potter was too good at this; it felt real.
Malfoy leaned forward to rest his forehead against Harry’s, and Harry could feel Malfoy’s smile against his cheek. “Of course,” he said.
Still nothing. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the others starting to take note, sitting up taller and reaching forward.
“Umm, thanks, Malfoy,” Weasley said finally, shooting a glance at Granger before looking Draco in the eye. “You don’t have to apologise, though. We get why you were ticked off about it.”
“Pretty good,” he said, and yelped as Malfoy turned his wand on Harry and the uncomfortable, sticky mess on his thighs and abdomen disappeared and was replaced by a cool, tingly sensation.
Dread sank in Draco’s stomach, but he didn’t know what else to do—didn’t know what other options he had. He really needed to talk to someone, to get the advice that Blaise had insisted he get. But every time he went to get in touch with an old therapist, something sharp and bitter would overcome him and he couldn’t do it. Tomorrow. He would do it tomorrow.
Eleanor leaned back in her seat, getting comfortable. “Therapy is an ongoing process. It looks different for everyone, but that’s not to say that you were doing it
“Okay,” he rose, and the two of them walked stiffly out of the Great Hall. As they left the table, Hermione and Ron started furiously whispering to each other.
