There were still deatheaters…
“Not all of us spend all our days playing dress-up, Malfoy.”
“How can you get sick of treacle tarts?” Harry asked in mock horror from beside him.
“Well I was thinking I would pack and make sure everything was organised while you two are at work today and then leave tomorrow morning…? If that’s okay?”
“You know this doesn’t change anything.”

“You still are.”

life.
“No silly. That was yesterday. Remember? When we had to rebuild my entire kitchen. But now we have to go back.”
Everyone’s eyes were grey. They were that way from birth. They were bland and singular and identical to every other person in the world. It was a soulless grey. That is, for all but two.
“Well?” he asked hopefully.
done! Isn’t that great?”
Harry stared at the ceiling. His thoughts swirling around him, like cement. A glass of half-finished scotch rested on the nightstand beside him. He probably should have had a headache. He might have, had he been sober in the last…
He was going to do it anyway.
“Darling. Draco needs you more than I do. Now go make a cup of chamomile tea. I have a feeling Draco might need it when he wakes up.”
Sirius and Draco have a heart-to-heart. Turns out they understand each other better than they thought?
The rain drizzled on around them as Sirius watched the boy eat his meal, one hand stroking his sleek black fur. He was so much like Harry. They were probably around the same age.
fashion sense?”
This,
“I'm sorry,” He told Molly. “I'm causing problems in your family by staying here.”
“You're
"Then don’t ask him to help, Harry." Says Ron, dragging Harry towards the door. "Leave  Dean to deal with his soppy love life and you and I can go down to the pitch. Ginny's  waiting." He adds.
“So?” Harry asks nervously.
His trunk followed them, floating close to the ground. It occasionally kicked him in the shins. Draco gritted his teeth and ignored it.
Having Draco pressed against his side was a bit painful for his pining heart, but the warmth lulled him to sleep soon enough. And you don’t remember pain in sleep. At least, Harry didn’t.
“But I do,” Draco whispers. “I deserve to be hated. I earned it. By bullying
"Now that they're gone," Draco intertwines their fingers. "How about doing something fun?"
“Don’t push it.” Sirius said, though he was dying to know what was going on.
The three of them spent that day in the kitchen, fumbling around with potatoes and onions. And Harry could feel them. His parents laughing along with him and Remus as Sirius tried to get egg off his hair.
“Yeah,” Potter whispered back, awfully close. “Otherwise they taste really bitter when baked.”
“Mum have you seen…” The music stopped dramatically when Ginny Weasley walked in. Draco froze, eyes wide as the girl turned hateful eyes at him.
Harry flinches when Draco makes a pained sound. Did he think the knight was going to hurt the dragon?
She shook her head. “In two days.” Narcissa thinks she might be next.
Neville managed to prop the door open despite the very much unconscious Ron perched  against it. "Hey Harry, Malfoy. Ooh, is that knife monopoly?"
Draco understood. Even as his thoughts dropped back into his head one by one, he remained calm. The Party had led Draco here for whatever it was Potter would take, and what he would take at the moment was this. Draco had never been particularly generous, but he stood still and gave these things to Potter: the place Potter wanted to breathe at his throat; the narrow ribs Potter wanted to compress with his arms; and the hands wandering over Potter's back, which Potter seemed to like, considering when Draco paused, Potter squirmed very slightly until Draco began again.
“Well, when you’re ready.” Pansy laid her hands briefly on his shoulders, then pulled them away before it could be clear they were offered in comfort.
Draco rolled onto his back so they wouldn’t see whatever his face was doing when he said, “Theo and Blaise say they’ve been.” He fixed his eyes on the elaborately-carved beams in the coffered ceiling, where a single, determined spider had apparently begun construction on a new web.
“Now, it’s Lav’s turn,” Dean said, smug in the aftermath of his success, and pointed at Lavender in command, a gesture that might have been more forceful if he could do more than just uncurl his index finger from around the plastic cup in his hand and aim it at Lavender.
the wine,” she muttered. She still couldn’t believe she’s drank from the jug just as copiously as everyone else. But at the time it hadn’t occurred to her to hesitate, which was the
“Fairy wine,” Padma said grimly.
Thank you so much for your comments! I treasure them! ❤️
Heads swiveled in Harry’s direction. Harry guiltily lifted his gaze from Seamus’ backside.
“It’s an invitation,” Seamus said with forced calm. “That’s all. If we don’t accept it, everything will be f—”
“Potter.” Draco’s own voice rang out in his empty head. He sounded dazed. He supposed having a clear head was the same thing as being dazed. “Are you hugging me?”
?” Her lower lip was probably wobbling by now. Daphne hated to be left out.
In sixth year on the train Draco had felt it, the enormous satisfaction of getting his hands on Potter, of interrupting him physically. He’d seen stars when his boot had connected with Potter’s face that day.
He gave his wand a three-pointed wave and incanted, and with a subtle shimmer, the bit of elf magic that was warding the ceilings from spiders and dust evaporated.
The scar slanting over Lavender’s eyebrow and down her cheek was still dark red and angry, but with her flushed cheeks and her sly smile, Harry was sure she’d never been lovelier.
“No,” she snapped. “Don’t be sarcastic.”
Parvati rolled her eyes. “This is not the way the game is played.”
“Are you going to leave me for Parvati?” Ron asked later when she was helping him make sandwiches for the crowd. Molly had appeared briefly, observed the guests with uncharacteristic silence, then trudged back out to the garden.
“Okay there, Harry?” Seamus poked him in the ribs and then furrowed his brow and engaged in a more thorough examination of Harry’s prominent ribs. Harry yelped and batted his hands away.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, disheveled and distinctly repentant-looking. That look on his face filled Draco’s mouth with a sour taste. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to—" Then his eyes slowly narrowed and refilled with heat, if a more cogent sort than they’d held when he’d stalked across the clearing. Draco preferred this face, one capable of malice, over the regretful one. Immensely. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
Presently, Draco noticed that the sky past Potter’s head was starry and moving. While considering that phenomenon with distant curiosity, Draco yawned. He yawned so widely his jaw cracked. He was overcome with a deep and startling tiredness. He sagged against Potter’s embrace.
“That was the last one!” Dean moaned, holding the second bottle, now mostly empty, against his chest like a newborn.
Pansy snorted and jerked the strands of hair even more tightly, so that Draco wondered if he would retain the ability to frown or close his eyes.
Harry unnoticed, picked up one of the jugs and closed his eyes as he inhaled the intoxicating smell of its contents.
“It’s very fashionable, being eccentric,” Draco said sullenly. He wasn’t sure whether he was defending himself or his mother. He lifted a hand to touch the braid at his temple, and Pansy easily transferred the hair she was holding into one hand so she could bat him away with the other.
“Why are you so skinny?” Seamus demanded.
Daphne must have obeyed, because her voice was a little quieter, a little lower, when she insisted, “But if
They had been there for a terrible reason, of course, one he had been reminded of in short order, when the Wizengamot had come in and sat. Draco’s eyes had skimmed over the many empty seats, people killed in the war in service of one side or another, a few more of them in the holding cells that had been set up in the scrap of spare wizarding space the Unspeakables allegedly maintained for experiments. The
Potter was still about an inch shorter than Draco. They’d both grown a bit. On reflex, Draco kicked Potter in the shin as hard as he could. Which wasn’t that hard because they were standing so close to one another. But of course Potter wasn’t nearly as tough as he pretended to be, so he sucked in a breath and winced like he’d been stabbed. His hands closed harder on Draco’s arms and it was Draco’s turn to growl out a complaint, even as Potter jerked their bodies closer together, and then the world tilted again and this time, Draco was too entangled with Potter to regather his balance. They both fell hard into the ground, Potter mostly on top of Draco, his knee in Draco’s thigh. He tried to hold onto Draco’s arms, too, but one of them landed beneath their combined weight, and sprang loose. Panting, Draco took advantage of that break in Potter’s hold and pulled away. In the process the arm still caught in the vice of Potter’s hand twisted horribly, and Draco let out an undignified howl.
Parvati squinted down at Lavender over the rims of a pair of smart half-moon spectacles Harry was sure he hadn’t seen before. “I know they’re
“It’s not?” Potter looked horrified. “Then why—why the fuck would you be here?” His shock cleared to suspicion after a moment. “You’re making this up. I don’t believe you.”
Draco’s head cleared. It was a strange feeling. He didn’t know when it had ever happened to him before. His thoughts vanished and left him alone with the warm pressure of Potter’s body against his, shoulder to hip and, after Potter shuffled closer still and shoved one foot between Draco’s, thigh to thigh, calf to calf. Potter’s hair smelled of all the finest notes of fairy wine—not the sweetness or the tang of alcohol, but the earth and vines at its core.
“I think I did,” Harry said quietly. “It’s hard to — to be sure.” Harry had a sense that death was one of those human terms, a word meant to label a concept that couldn’t be contained by just one syllable.
Potter had looked, then, as though when the war had ended for others it had in fact dragged on for Potter and continued to batter and starve him. Draco had already known from seeing him in the last year of the war that he had gotten dramatically taller than Draco was used to picturing him, though still not quite Draco’s height. He had looked rumpled in his simple dark robes of obvious quality, like someone had handed them to him but he hadn’t known quite how to put them on. There was a place on the side of his head where his hair had turned up sharply in a cowlick like he’d recently slept, but in an awkward position. Draco’s hand had curled on his thigh with the urge to smooth it.
Everyone who later heard the Party was invoked that day would assume it had to do with Harry — his general, overall exceptionalism. Hermione knew better, and even she would remember how he looked that day and wonder if the Party was the magical world’s last ditch effort to tether its Savior to Earth before he wasted away.
The Party is in your head, just like it’s in Pansy’s, Draco thought. It was like being drunk; or more, the soaring high of certain potions that he rarely trusted himself with.
The Party was presently in a clearing and spilling over with guests. The crowds didn’t shock Draco, really; he’d always known Potter liked an audience. Apparently he
“Yes. I was gone for a while.”
Maybe the crucial ingredient delivered that day to the graveyard was George, wielding the dark, unfocused power of a twinship severed. Though he stalked off before the service finished and long before the wine was inadvertently sacrificed, he did spat on the paving stones hemming the graveyard as he went.
Hermione made a strangled sound, but Seamus forged ahead before Harry’s smile could even fade.
“I can’t believe
Hermione couldn’t determine the extent of his inner turmoil, but she could guess. He looked terribly gaunt and silent, standing there staring at the Charmed sod where upturned earth had been. Hermione hovered a few steps away, and behind her with their hands shoved in their pockets were Dean and Seamus, and behind them, Lavender with her arms around Parvati’s and Padma’s waists.
“Pansy,” Daphne protested shyly, then sniffed. “I wouldn’t want to go without you, anyway.”
He sat apart from the throngs of guests. He leaned against a low stone wall with his arm slung over it, alone except for the witch beside him who Draco distantly recognized as one of the Patil twins. Potter had his legs stretched out in front of him. They looked too long for him, and his shoulders broader than they should be. At the trial, just weeks ago, he was gaunt and angular. All dark hair and bright eyes and lips and carved bone.
Instead he was wearing jeans and an untucked button-down shirt, and the sun was unspeakably radiant. Birds sang and threw themselves onto the low limbs of the verdant trees sheltering the graveyard.
Hermione gaped at Lavender, torn between disapproval and horror. “Not Slughorn?”
Now she just looked relieved. “Alright then. Make yourself at home.” And out she went again
Seamus rubbed his forehead and sighed. “Well, then,” he said in a resigned tone. “Invitation accepted. I guess we’re having a party.”
Padma made a retching sound and everyone else laughed again, including Harry; his abs were sore with it. It felt so much like crying, a cousin emotion, that same aftertaste of exhaustion, catharsis.
Over the years when their eyes had locked, Draco had felt a variant of what he’d felt then, in the chamber, staring over the small wooden barrier, the tables containing the barristers, the odd little gate penning Potter onto a small daise from which witnesses gave their testimony. It had been anticipation of violence, a heady thrill, but not of the variety he had Potter had visited upon one another before, with one exception.
“Hey,” Ron started to object, but when Parvati and Hermione both looked at him patiently, he sighed. “Alright, fair enough. I want to be on Hermione’s team.”
George shed his shoes and socks. Harry had already done that the night before and had no need for them since; now he wondered absently where they were. The grass was always smooth and cool here, the stones smooth and comforting, the soil a dense cushion.
“Oh, thank you, Potter. Those words are
Hi! Sorry for the delay. I hope this chapter can offer a pleasant distraction for you. I know that reading has been an ever more welcome escape for me in recent weeks.
to appreciate ten-thousand-year-old wine?”
“Oh, hey, where’d you get those?” Harry asked, looking at the row of earthenware jugs that had appeared in a row where she’d just been sitting. A scent wafted from them, oranges and hyacinth and the unmistakable sting of strong alcohol.
Draco jerked his head back around. “What did you do!” he snapped. Potter was getting to his feet, and paused with one knee raised and his hand braced upon it to peer up at Draco.
George kicked at the water, dropping his chin to his chest. The moonlight put patches of silver amongst the ruddy waves on the back of his head. Harry saw that the water reflected George’s face, and that’s what he was slapping his foot against: his own reflection and all it had come to mean to him now.
“What?”
The spider looked very small from this distance — just a speck, really. But if Draco squinted, he could see it moving cautiously down a length of silk of dubious structural integrity, the whole half-spun structure swaying slightly with the force of its own tiny body on the precarious journey.
“An angel, as I said,” Pansy repeated, sounding a little breathless. Even Pansy, and even after all these years, didn’t entirely know what to do with Daphne. “I’m all done with you. Scoot. Your scalp will be sore if this continues. Draco, come. You’re next.”
It was a very curious sensation, to feel those two things commingled: desire and revulsion. The worst kind of stomach-knotting, heart-racing illness. He thought curiously that Potter seemed to be showing outward signs of the same symptoms. His face was again undergoing all that unflattering shifting. And then he lurched forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s unguarded torso and pressed his face against Draco’s throat.
They rolled up their trousers and waded out ankle-deep. The slope of the pond’s edge beneath the water was paved in tiny shells that seemed to have no sharp edges. A school of phosphorescent fish startled away from them and sped toward deeper water. Above, the stars pivoted and turned.
After clinging to Ron for a few more moments, Hermione pulled back. They met one another’s eyes with twin expressions of worry, and then Ron led her by the hand into the Burrow.
“Come along, Draco,” she said, low and velvety, and Draco could see that the Party had begun to seize her already. Her eyes were black and hard as onyx, which might have been a trick of the light, but the final proof was in what she said next. Pansy was manipulative, but she would never have uttered the words that next poured from her mouth. “Are you really going to pass up a chance to give Potter whatever he needs, even if what he needs is a bit of your blood?”
This general existential despair left Harry standing at Fred’s graveside long after the service.
, and yet Harry hesitated. He knew what George was really asking, just as George seemed to understand Harry’s half-answer before. He didn’t know whether they’d stumbled upon the same wavelength somehow, or if the Party had placed them there, but for whatever reason, he knew that Fred’s question had nothing to do with Dumbledore or Voldemort or Horcruxes. It quite possibly had nothing to do with trains that came and went, and the universe-upending decision whether to step off the platform and board, or to stay.
“Err… thank you Draco.” Then Sirius went a bit red. “And Harry, it
“I don’t think so, though now that you mention it…”
And wasn’t he a death eater? Wasn’t Sirius afraid they’d be tracked?
Draco opened his eyes, blue and grey eyes sparkling. “Of kissing you? No.” He looked down, pressing Harry’s hands between his. “I’m afraid of what’s going to happen after.”
with him?”
“Yeah, what’s so funny?” Malfoy grumbled from beside him. Apparently, he’d been hogging Sirius’ sofa for a while. And the turd had the audacity to act offended.
There was a knocking from the other side of the house; Remus asking to be let out.
The end credits of yet another muggle movie plays while an audience of three huddle together, too busy chattering to care who played the part of Whatever-His-Name.
Merlin, Harry. Now’s not the time for a crisis. His heart was catapulting now, loud and stupid.
Harry saw red. How dare she! What right did she have to say that to someone she didn't even know?
"Is it true you went down on Krum after Fleur’s annual Fête Nationale party?" It must be a  trick of light, because Malfoy looks fairly pink-cheeked.
“Malfoy?” Potter’s voice was unmistakable. His tone was undecipherable.
“You're right. What you did cannot be excused. You did earn the hate.” Every sentence made him want to bury himself six feet under. “You’ve been punished for what you have done.”
Yes, Remus still beat himself up sometimes when he remembers what he is, but he grows his own herbs and always knows how to cheer them up. Sirius spent 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn’t commit and he had sentiments for muggle appliances, but he was the one that saved Draco from the alley and gave Harry a place to call home. Harry lacked in the emotional department but he was good at making people smile and didn’t royally suck at Defence. And that’s something.
. Wherever that was. "Oh, err. Hello Malfoy." Or  he could do that… Dying on the inside is good too.
She flinched. “I assure you, cousin of mine, I have no intention of
“Yes, dear?”
The Slytherins, Zabini and Nott almost never stayed there, preferring to crash either Malfoy’s  or Parkinson’s dorm. No one knows where Ernie goes. Just that he attended classes and ate at  the Great Hall. If you tried to find him outside of that, well, good luck.
The two of them then turn to see Percy Weasley calmly sit on the chair. Tonks slumps while Charlie pouts a little. They slink down to lean against Fleur’s settee, looking chagrined.
Harry didn’t know how, but he knew Malfoy just looked at him the same moment Harry did. They were knee-deep in huge trouble.
“-yes, and I’m sure it’s fascinating, really.” Harry patted his… seatmate? Friend? Did this new proximity make them mates now? They weren't really fighting, and Harry was far too tired to think up the schematics. Let’s call Malfoy a Significant Annoyance and leave the ponder about details for later.
“Great.” Hermione beamed. “I’ll see you then!”
. One that was being forced to battle in a war, not having any other choice. Like Harry.
“Yeah, I saw.” Sirius rolled his eyes. “But Draco’s my cousin, yeah? And I brought him home from…”
“Right, Voldemort. Happy now?” Malfoy shuddered. “As I was saying, (before I was rudely interrupted) I refuse to spend my Christmas with a long face just because I have to spend it with you.” He declared pompously.
Fake geese. Mafloy woke him up to watch fake geese. It could have been because they’d reached the resort, or maybe even because the train was being hijacked by an evil megalomaniac and they needed to save the world. But no. It had to be fake geese.
Harry can understand where Ron is coming from, but he’s not the one that has to listen to  Seamus and Dean rant about how ‘beautiful his eyes are’ or ‘how are his hands so long and  elegant, Harry, HOW?’ or even ‘god dammit Harry I want to shag him so bad’ without knowing the other says the exact same thing. Harry is. And he’s getting bloody tired of the pining losers.
“I have to go,” Malfoy… Draco turned to leave.
Hermione, Luna and Ginny looking radiant in their bridesmaid gowns. (well, Ginny looked disgruntled, but otherwise beautiful).
The next chapter happens after a time skip, post war.
When the boy in front of him bites his lip and looks away before unbuttoning his shirt, Harry thinks it might be the Dark Mark, or even Sectumsempra scars, that Draco might want to show him.
It bubbled, steam curling in the frosty air. The tub was empty and it looked so, so inviting. The warm air seemed to swirl around Harry - beckoning him. It was tantalizing.
"Actually," Draco dragged his hands along Harry's robes. "I was thinking of something more fun to pass the time."
Sirius watched in horror as three great claw-marks scratched themselves on Draco’s arm. The work of a Hippogriff, no doubt.
“Does this mean- does this mean what I think it does?”
Bruises followed his eyes everywhere he looked. Purple and red and fading pinks painting a gruesome picture no critic would appreciate.
Light creaked in from the front door. “Harry? Draco? What are you both doing with the lights off?”
“I…” His grip on Teddy tightened. Merlin forbids anything like that happened to his baby. “I’m sorry.”
“Which do you want to hear first, the good news, or the bad news?”
“Well, perhaps not in that specific context, but yeah.”
Harry laughs, wrapping an arm around the blond. “You say that every year. Last year we just hung ornaments on the Halloween props.”
” he blurted.
Mrs Weasley turned back to him. This time, she had a handful of carrots. “Can you cut these for me? I can’t move from the stove for a while and if we want carrot cake we must have carrots, right?”
Then again, perhaps he had underestimated Moony’s reaction.
“I might have an idea, though.” and Draco whispered it into Harry’s ear, once again inciting shivers from the latter.
“Nah,” Sirius could feel the heat creep up his neck. “I’m the lucky one. Now go shower, you stink.”
Sirius let go, running that hand through his hair. He liked to consider himself a man of economic movement after all.
She hugged him. Sirius noticed she smelled like the Rose Bedroom. Or perhaps, the Rose Bedroom smelled like
him and I thought he did too but when I woke up the morning he’s… he’s gone. Sirius how could you let him go?”
All Blacks had this
Malfoy nudged him, and Harry slid his plate over to him this time. The blond turned around to give Harry a blinding smile. It was nice.
Yet hearing from the mouse is easier than from the lion. Because the axe tells a different story than of the tree’s.
. Straight lines, crisp and almost invisible, added to the mess.
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry thought he saw a tiny smile too. “Alright, Harry. You can wear a Santa hat.”
But it was too late. The fork jabbed into the opening the moment Harry grabbed the other boy's arm. And that's how the both of them ended up standing in the dark with their hair standing up and feeling thoroughly jolty. Or maybe that was just Harry.
Harry could hear his heart doing somersaults inside his chest, ever so often crashing against his rib cage. The old Draco Malfoy wouldn’t do that. He’d probably recite a stiff ‘thank you speech’ memorized age 5.
They had crashed and burned and broken. And here they were now, frantic touches and tentative kisses. Whispering apologies and consolation.
Harry didn’t want to deal with people who thought being expressive was wrong. That
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. They’d already tried every single spell they knew and Malfoy’s even dug around the Library of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and came up empty. The walls just wouldn’t stop bleeding.
“I still hate you!” Shouted Harry.
In the meantime, he should probably work on an escape plan before he got spotted by any redheads. Really, he’d be doing both parties a favour by leaving!
“I like you and I have for a long time. And even if it hurts to tell you, it hurts more to keep it inside me.”
Great. Once Harry had feelings for someone (and figured it out) his brain would stop at no ends to make him look like a blubbering fool. Like when he liked Cedric and Cho at the same time and fucked up with both of them.
At least he got to see Malfoy gawking at all the muggle stuff. He’d had to drag him away from the traffic light because
“Oh.”
Harry meekly folds the jumpers. Malfoy seems to think they’ll need an insane amount of socks and beanies. “Otherwise your toes and ears will fall off,” he’d said with a smile.
Harry had died and come back to life. Draco had relived every curse every sent his way.
"I gave them to Blaise."
“Its okay,” Harry says, the same way Sirius did when he had nightmares. He’d place an arm around him and sit with Harry until the shaking stopped.
How did Malfoy manage to use this place for a whole week?
Hermione snorted into her hot cocoa. "I hope you haven't forgotten our ski trip, Harry. We'll be in Bulgaria for the hols this time."
Harry decided at that moment that whatever happened, he would get on the sled and he would make Malfoy ride it with him. Not that the other male had any choice in the matter. What with the potion and shit.
Draco left him with a choice, but without the subtle coercion that laced Ginny’s. Harry didn’t need to fuck around with Draco. He could teach him about muggles as friends, if Harry liked.
The darkness made him worry. Alleyways made for the perfect place to pull heists or illegal drug trafficking. Muggles were very particular about their nightly recreation. The boy risked getting killed here.
Harry nearly flew him back to Grimmo, but when he saw the look of contempt on Ron’s face, he couldn’t.
That afternoon, Sirius took them shopping because ‘Harry dressed like a granny and Draco didn’t have a change of clothes’.
Draco looked thrilled. His face brightened and there was a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Yes! That’s it.”
“But you were at the other end of the hall,” said Harry, finding an opportunity. “So you must’ve had to be listening to have heard that.”
“I do.” Draco smiled, and it was more beautiful than any magic. More special than any snowflake. More magical than any mistletoe.
Okay. This really
“Stop overreacting, Potter.” said Malfoy, who had not, in fact, given Harry his pillow back. It was under his feet now, with his own pillow under his head. Geez, Malfoy, why don’t you take the pillows off all the other beds and make yourself a fort?
“You might have found the right person at the wrong time.”
“But I thought you weren’t boycotting Christmas anymore?”
Harry wanted to turn around and flee. Hogwarts might’ve been in ruins, but even that was more comforting than what his home had turned into.
“Me?”
Neville snickers from behind his
“You came back.”
Just like the ponce to throw Harry’s words straight back. Harry thinks it fondly, not unkindly.
Harry doesn't remember going to bed last night.
“Shut up. Git.”
Somehow Parvathi and Lavender managed to convince Mrs Dabney and Luanne to spend the night at their relative’s house. Obviously so they could throw a party.
Now it was Harry’s turn to scoff. Then the scoff became a laugh.
“Watch me.”
mattered.
They both grimaced at the mention of Wimbledon. Horrid man, really.
All of a sudden, Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head. He flinched as if he was being Crucioed. It was terrible to watch. And just like that, he was wheezing again, gasping for breath.
I suck at Herbology. If Ron and I fail this term, Hermione is going to put our heads in a  jar." Which was true. Hermione did threaten to do that. No faking there. Harry tried to suppress a shudder at the memory of her fierce tone.
might be a bit off. Also I shoulda mentioned it earlier but better late then never right? lol
It never came.
Sirius knew that Draco’s departure affected Harry deeply. He knew that expressing feelings was hard for his godson and that Draco was special. He was important. That it was likely Harry would never be able to love another the same way.
He wanted to say something more, but a crash from near the staircase stopped him. Walburga’s distressed voice called, “Sirius! Come quick!” in the most un-horrid tone he’d ever heard her use.
Both of them had terrible colds when they woke up, though.
Draco flicked his wand, the not-Hawthorn, and a pale violet cloth draped over their table. Two plates floated on followed by a pretty vase filled with Gardenias and Spring Gentians. Then the cutlery arranged themselves by each plate. Glasses and a pitcher of water were the last to go on.
When he walked back to the living room, the blonds hunched over a herbology book. Their eyes puffed red and Remus sniffled a bit, but Sirius decided they were okay.
“And you just made this the most unforgettable one of all.” Harry admitted.
Seamus approaches him in the Great Hall, looking too much like a kicked crup for Harry's liking. "You guys are having a  sleepover and didn’t invite me?" He said, doe eyed as ever.
Sirius felt glad Andromeda and Tonks had offered to take Teddy with them.
He’d called them blood-traitors and laughed at their financial condition, all the while being jealous of their large, happy family. He voiced the question to Madame Archibald.
What?
"Fine." Dean rolled his eyes. "We'll open the door. Nev where's the key?"
“Don’t worry about that,” Draco whispered back to him, his breath hot on Harry’s neck. It made the hairs on his neck stand.
What wizards did with magic, muggles did with technology. They replaced magic with numbers and circuits and voltage. Harry thought there was something inherently beautiful about that.
They stayed like that, unbearably close, until the embers died down and the dawning sun filtered through misty winter clouds.
And it
Okay, maybe he
Draco turned a brilliant red, which Harry didn’t really think possible because he was already so flustered. It was so cute. And it was because of
that it was wrong. My mother thinks so too…” Here, Sirius glanced up in surprise. “But she thinks our hands are tied. Nothing to be done.”
Draco leaned his head back and Harry once again got to admire his glittering blue and grey eyes. They were like two pools in the middle of a cornfield maze, the sky reflected in their glassy waters. His face was a labyrinth Harry wouldn’t have minded getting lost in. Eyes oceans he wouldn’t have minded drowning in.
Malfoy didn't speak, so Harry pressed on.
He’d been trying to avoid rowing with Malfoy ever since Toasty died. In retrospect the git’s been acting even more annoying than usual. “Maybe you should talk to the portrait again. Walburga let you guys fix up downstairs didn’t she?”
Grimmo’s magic, no doubt.
“This isn’t about
Now here he was here. In No.12 Grimmauld Place.
In the end Zabini and Hannah declared Ron the winner because obviously seeing his own handsome face in Harry’s mirror jumper wouldn’t be considered ugly.
"Can you guys go be mushy somewhere else? Your absolutely adorable daughter needs her beauty sleep."
Then all of a sudden, Draco was crying. Well, he was tearing up, but still chopping away at the vegetables. Worry bubbled in Harry’s throat. “Shit, are you alright?” Did he cut himself? Harry should’ve known better than to have-
Harry found his godfather behind him. Sirius had deep purple pockets under his eyes. He looked thirty years older and so, so very exhausted.
Draco caught his mother’s eye and smiled weakly as the Auror shoved him towards the gate.
Sirius almost didn’t recognize her. Her blond-and-black hair was pulled up in a half-hearted bun, mixing the two colours. Her normally youthful face had wrinkles and dark circles around her eyes. Dressed in all black. In mourning.
Harry wondered if he was supposed to answer.
He was the reason Draco was so happy. Oh, Merlin, was this a dream?
“I see. Is there something I can do for you, Mr. Potter?” she asked, gesturing towards one of the adjacent rooms.
It wasn’t that though. Logically speaking, it should have been. They were all about to die for Merlin’s sake! But, no. His heart had other ideas.
“Harry, where are the toothbrushes?” Dudley called from upstairs. It had barely even been three hours since he’d arrived and Draco was just about ready to hand him over to the Dementors. Unfortunately, they had all been abolished after The War. So, it seemed he was out of luck.
A faint smile crossed Narcissa’s lips.
“With an arse like this? I’m not anyone’s secret anything,” and strutted back out, leaving Harry gripping the table, trying not to fall off his chair from laughter.
“I don’t have to deal with this.”
“That’s... absurd.”
“Biscuits. I think. And yes, you will, and you are going to be a good sport about it.” Draco pouted, but with a soft glare from his husband relented and trailed after him into the dining room, arms laden with bowls and spoons.
One week into his holidays, he heard the news. The teachers had been murmuring to each other all morning. The news reached him with the post. On the headline was none other the Saviour himself, with the caption ‘The Boy-Who-Lived Dead!?’ Absently Draco noted porcelain falling and breaking, but he didn’t care and the teachers didn’t have the heart to comment. They just watched him sadly.
Seven came quickly after that, distracted in his own thoughts, and barely second after his alarm rang, he heard a knock on his front door.
“I meant for you, Harry.” He took a breath.
“Don’t worry about it, Malfoy. We were young and forced into a war we never should have had to fight. I did just as many things to hurt you, if not more, and… I’m sorry too.” He paused. “So, can we just call it quits?” Malfoy gave him a shy smile, finally looking up.
with Hermione. He would have to apologise for that. He had sent a letter to Minerva, explaining that he needed at least a year off, but didn’t try to explain his absence.
“I’m sorry. Did I wake you?”
“Well alive or not, there are issues with this scenario. Honestly Harry. What did you think? That I was going to wake up and we go about our lives like an old married couple?” He snorted. “We certainly fight enough for it, but in other areas… I am afraid we are greatly lacking, communication being top off the list.”
But that’s all it was.
Was storming into the git’s office and demanding an explanation a terrible plan?
It didn’t really matter though, Mr. Oblivious stayed true to his name.
A little while later, he was able to excuse himself unnoticed by the rest of his family and head downstairs. As he walked in he noticed three things: 1, Harry was watching to door - watching him; 2, Luna had a rather curious look in her eye as she watched Harry; 3, Hermione was watching Harry out of the corner of her eye as she tried to talk Ron down from whatever it was he was getting upset about. What had they all seen in Harry? He shook his head to clear the thought. He could agonize over the boy later. Right now, he needed to make sure there would still be a boy to agonize over.
His heart was palpitating, his breath came out quick and short. Harry had never been so close. He really, really wanted to curse, over a million things. He wanted to curse over the ridiculousness of his heart; over Voldemort starting this stupid war putting his mate in danger; over Harry being so freaking handsome; over his body just refusing to do anything he told him if the boy was within a ten-metre radius, obedience that got worse the further into that radius he was. And, right now? Well he was about to implode.
“… and this is your room,” Harry said, finishing the brief tour as they arrived at what, according the Harry, was to be his room.
Instead of making his way straight to the blondes side as he had yesterday, mirroring the blondes frozen stated, he opted the look around the room. It was large, as far as bedrooms go, but not uncommonly so for the manor. The large bed in the centre obviously took precedence in the room, but it also housed a series of reading chairs, and a floor to ceiling bookcase. There were no desks present. Harry assumed he probably had a separate study in one of the next rooms. There was on en suite though.
““You did… what?”
He still wasn’t sure why Harry kept coming back. It was hardly for the company. They didn’t even speak to each other. He suspected though, that that was part of the appeal. He provided Harry with a place no one would bother him. It wasn’t really the company Draco was looking for, but some days it was better than being alone. Better than the other ‘company’ he had come to know. He had noticed a considerable lack of hexes flying in his direction with Harry’s more frequent visits. Figures. The boy only had to breath and people ran off to do his will.
Taunting Harry was somewhat bittersweet, but he knew he had to, for various reasons. He loved the way those green eyes would settle on him whenever he made some snide remark, and he had to make sure no one suspected them of being close. But, more importantly, he always tormented him more on the days the boy looked defeated. He hated those days. He needed to see a spark of fire return to the boy, he had to do something. It killed him just to watch.
“I left after taking all the younger students back. I didn’t stick around. I don’t think I am everyone’s favourite person at the moment.”
Wings wrapped around him. They looked, sharp, but they were soft to touch.
In Harry’s defence, he didn’t actually know how it had started, and technically speaking, they weren’t hexes…
He was rarely wrong, and some days he hated that fact.
He had looked pale the last morning he had passed him in the hall just before holidays. Both parties silent as they went to pass each other. His hair was dull, missing that usual Malfoy gleam, and his eyes had dark circles around them. Not that he had been paying any attention.
“I’ll talk to McGonagall later. She’ll have enough on her plate with all the other student-”
“No, but so were you, and look where we ended up,” he smiled, looping his arm through the blonde’s.
Draco heard a fluttering behind him on his lunch break in his office, before finding another one of the soft golden flowers.
The blonde swore once before scrapping off the top, lathering it with some butter and marmalade, and rushing out the door.
This year they were doing a decade memorial for the ‘legend’, but to be honest, Draco wasn’t sure how many would show up. Sure, Harry had been a hero in his time, and he may have affected the lives of many but very few truly impacted on, or cared for,
He had finally told her everything at Christmas, little Victoire cradled gently in her arms sleeping soundly. She had stared at him for a while after he had finished talking, but even after her pause, he didn’t think he would ever have been ready for what she said.
Malfoy hadn’t returned after break.
“I don’t see why not,” he shrugged.
“Narcissa,” he amended, “why- why does Tibby call me young master? Why did she when I first got here? Why did the estate just let me in…?”
“I’m afraid he’s dead.”
Draco hadn’t really been focused lately anyway. His coworkers at St Mungos had been giving him a hard time due to his ex Death Eater status. He was trying so hard to earn his place, but some days he just came home and collapsed into a pile of tears on the inside of the door. Some days were just hard days.
Not five minutes later a mop of curly brown hair surfaced above the top of the book Draco was reading, and with a smile and an offered hand, the two were off to their weekly lunch together.
“Really? That’s a shame. I mean, I thought you might’ve liked to switch tonight…” Draco stared at him blankly for a moment before closing his eyes.
“Draco…” he heard his godfather murmur. He knew they were alone. He never sounded so close or so weary unless it was just the two of them.
His breath hitched. If Harry noticed, he didn’t comment. Maybe the boy thought - ignorantly - it was a result of the fiendfyre rising around them, almost certainly about to kill them all.
“No I’m fine. I’m pretty sure you stopped anyone from getting within ten foot of me,” he snorted.
“There’s a lake there and well, I’m…”
“Your eyes are more unique than mine.” Draco froze. He thought his heart might have stopped but he wasn’t paying much attention. “They remind me of the night sky, full of clouds with little bursts of starlight poking through every so often.
“No, you don’t. And last, I checked, you came on your own. So, you’re welcome to leave,” the boy retorted.
He just nodded, still numb.
“Sorry…”
With a deep breath, he stepped inside. He wasn’t sure what he expected to see. An elf, or maybe Narcissa? Maybe the blonde awake. But nothing had changed. Nothing from the angles of the chair he had been sitting in, to the angle of the drapes, nor the one lock of soft blonde hair falling softly down the side of Draco’s pale face had changed. It was like it was frozen. A dream.
The room was dark. Unsurprisingly, he couldn’t see anything at first. There was perhaps a bare crack in the window drapes, but if it was there it was almost imperceptible. Everything was pitch black. It took a minute, but his eyes adjusted, and came to rest on the pale bed in the centre of the room. At first that’s all he though was there, but he realised some of that sickly pale complexion was skin.
“Uh huh.” The blonde muttered something else that Harry didn’t catch as he reached back into the cabinet to try and rewire the last switch.
“Yes. Yes please. That would be amazing, Harry,” the boy said, as Harry just smiled. It didn’t mean things were alright, but it gave them the option to move past what things had been.
Absently he used a series of detection charms, but he knew it would come up empty. He plucked the flower off the top of his desk, twirling it between his fingers.
Draco practically flew around the room, though Harry was fairly certain he wasn’t flying. He  was too busy using his wings to disarm his opponents to be bothered flying, but he was so fast.
Regardless, he was more than a little happy.
Oh well, no point worrying about it now.
” his brain supplied, internally, or was he screaming? He wasn’t even sure anymore. No one interrupted him. “Why? I—Why Harry?” He cried harder, his tears blinding him, his sobs deafening him to his surroundings.
“I don’t see what is funny here,” the boy huffed, crossing his arms. Draco just smiled down at him fondly. Ducks.
Everything was white. Why was everything white? There was no stone castle or floor. There was no blood and no screaming. It was silent, painfully so. Draco glanced around, or what he assumed was around, because nothing changed in his vision.
The moment passed.
Hopefully he would be able to put the past behind him after today. He just wasn’t sure Harry Potter was likely to hold their childhood grudges.
“And what is that supposed the mean,” the boy half snarled, somewhat offended but mostly curious.
“Wow…”
Several of the children split off from their group as they walked, usually when they saw their family, or sometimes, when they saw their bodies. Nobody was going to make it out of this war unharmed.
Yes, this was where he had ended up. This was home.
Page after page, Harry read on about the Warlock, and his inability to love, for the Warlock had removed his own heart. He was prideful to be so fortunate yet not weighed down by familial attachments, until it was seen as a shortcoming by his court.
The war had had more of an effect than most people would ever know.
“Hardly, Mr. Potter,” she said disapproval plain in her voice.
A grin spread across the raven’s face as it came into effect.  The two glared at each other as they left for their classes, Draco resolutely not speaking.
He couldn’t find any sort of motivation to do anything. The days seemed long and tiring. He hated being in crowded places, but he hated being alone too. That was when the voices would start.
That’s how Draco knew something was wrong.
Harry was still for a moment, trying to take everything in. He rose clumsily after a moment, nearly knocking Mrs. Malfoy’s tea on her lap.
“Yeah well, that makes two of us, I hope,” the blonde started, hesitantly returning Harry’s hug, concern written plainly on his face.
Everyone avoided his wings like the plague.
“If there isn’t going to be enough time, then why on earth did he call me here? What was the point?” Harry almost shouted, the tears starting to stream down his face.
“Mr. Potter,” she continued, now standing before him, “I wasn’t aware we were expecting your company today.”
“Malfoy.”
“Draco’s… Draco’s alive?” His features wavered as he stumbled backwards into one chairs, his knees crumpling under him. Narcissa watched him silently.
“Hey Harry. Long-time no see,” the blond began as he laid a bouquet of white lilies at the boy’s grave. “Work’s been really busy lately. Madame Pomfrey has decided to retire and she wants me to replace her at the school. I filled out my St Mungos resignation yesterday. It’ll be a change, but I think it will be good for me. Anyway, I had better go. I am heading to the School with Hermione. I’m sure she’s told you that she’s going to be the next Gryffindor Head of House, and is going to teach Arithmancy, The Study of Ancient Runes and occasionally Muggle Studies. I swear that girl can do anything. So, I guess I’ll say goodbye, and I’ll see you next week for the memorial…” he trailed off and took a breath. “Bye Harry,” Draco said quietly as he went to join the girl standing at the edge of the cemetery, watching him.
“Potter, I- I wanted to apologise for everything. For school and the war, and-” he paused, not looking at Harry.
Turning around to face Harry, Draco melted, and before he knew it his hands were wrapped around the back of the other boy’s head, pressing their lips together.
Dudley’s stunned exclamation from the exterior turned into stunned silence as they toured the house and pointed out the various rooms that he might need. They had made a lot of repairs since the war. From the exterior alone it was unrecognizable, but the inside… it was clad in neat but homely furnishings of silver and gold scattered throughout the various rooms and levels of the house. Dudley would have sworn it was bigger on the inside than the out but it was either his imagination or simply another form of the magic that seemed so prolific around them.
Draco, unlike Harry, hadn’t taken his shirt off. It was a rather large shirt that made Draco look a bit boxy. The shirt ended just short of his knees, and Harry found himself gasping as he took in the way the fabric looked against Draco’s pale skin. So pale, the flesh and fabric could’ve been one.
He’d switched from Malfoy to Draco the moment he’d started talking about forks and spoons. He’d had to be explained how parents moulded children to understand Draco’s ordeal. And now he was Draco. Not Malfoy.
The boy, Narcissa’s boy smiled when he saw the black dog come in, tugging a pack of goodies.
“This,” Draco whispers in his ear. “Is the part where it gets cliché.”
“Accio Christmas, we've waited so long…” Mrs Weasley bobbed her head from side to side.
Harry grinned back. “Fuck off.” He said without malice.
Mrs Weasely planted fat kisses on his cheeks.
He used to be jealous because she was always picked for the best part in musicals.
“They tried to make me eat soup with a fork. I failed and they left me at the knife’s mercy.”
The other side of the room was tamer. A single poster of the Weird Sisters was hung above the bed. Well, their faces were replaced with those of the seven Weasley siblings, and Potter right in the middle.
And anyone with a right mind would be if they saw Malfoy  after Quidditch. It should be crime for him to look that good. Harry thinks dreamily.
Draco Malfoy, bandaged beyond recognition, sat in an uncomfortable heap near the fireplace. He looked more disgruntled than hurt. “I’m
Another visitor rang the bell while Sirius was making soup for his three boys.
The boy, it was starting to get difficult to call him that, pursed his lips. “You understand me, don’t you? No, it’s okay, don’t leave.” He dragged long fingers through the fur, almost tugging. A silent beg.
Harry and Draco interacting. Also there's an incident with Sirius' toaster pastries.
It was perfect. More than perfect in fact. If only he could make it-
"Dean Thomas. You have officially run out of excuses." Harry groans as the Gryffindor in  question screams into Neville's Hippogriff-feather stuffed pillow.
Harry feels someone kick him under the table. Oh, Dean was
The way Draco turned all prickly and pointy in a matter of seconds was a bit frightening to watch, Harry had to admit. He’d thought Draco's just softened after the war or something. He’d softened, yes. But only when talking to Harry?
“In her defence,” Draco smiled sheepishly. “Ski trips do tend to have casualties.”
That was what Van Dyke did to Clarisse when he wanted her to declare her love for him.  Except she professed her undying love for Abram instead of Van Dyke. Plot twists really were something.
Oh, and apparently that bloke liked plants too. Odd, the combinations you find these days.
Draco didn’t understand why he decided to testify for him. Draco had been nothing but horrible to him, all those years.
“What on earth is this?” said Malfoy, holding up a black shirt. He stared comically at the neck.
Narcissa didn’t cry when Sirius nodded, but he noticed she squeezed Teddy a bit tighter. Teddy giggled and yanked at a stray blond lock. To Sirius’ amazement, if not despair, the woman didn’t even flinch.
“Yeah, okay.” Harry pretended to understand what she’d said, but he was pretty sure he sounded as lost as Malfoy looked.
Of course, the conversation would have to drift to the boy at some point. Might as well be then.
Draco and Fleur chattered excitedly in French, some of which Harry understood to be about… his hair? Perhaps it was time Draco learnt of his French lessons.
Harry’s mouth went dry.
"That's not what you said but okay."
"What heart?" Ron says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry hovered next to the counter, anxious for Draco to be done. Then, the old lady muttered something rude at Draco. “Rich kids,” she spat. “All the same - disgusting little leeches.”
Harry showed him how to plug the toaster in and let Malfoy push the frozen pastries into their place. He tried to ignore the look of pure fascination Malfoy had the whole time. He'd get on wonderfully with Arthur... had things been different and stuff.
“Gift time!” Victorie exclaimed. Teddy whooped. The children imminently dove into the pile of presents under the tree.
Why hadn’t he burned them? Harry thought sourly.
He pointed his wand at the ceiling, and it lit up, like an explosion of bright light. Like what Harry imagined would’ve happened in the Big Bang.
For some reason, it felt like this was a play on her part, her way of convincing him to go. And it was bloody working too.
why he was so keen on declaring his love to me that  night."
He’d never understood what was so
Harry pressed his lips against Draco’s, gently at first, but then his emotions got the better of him and suddenly Draco was kissing back with just as much enthusiasm.
She breaks into the most beautiful grin and Draco can’t help a smile of his own.
“I don't know, Harry,” Draco grinned cheekily. “I still think you have a chance. All your sweaters are ugly.”
Sirius and Remus exchanged a look. “I think we’ve officially become a family today. Four dysfunctional idiots.”
Seamus turned red. Which was a good sign.
Needless to say, when Sirius finally stumbled into the kitchen, he was not happy to find the remains of an explosion instead of his favourite muggle appliance.  Oh, and he did not laugh at the burnt toaster pastries stuck to the ceiling like they hoped he would.
(See the end of the chapter for
That way, Harry reckons he can minimize certain schemes to dapper-up his coiffure. At least in his presence.
"Just promise you won't do anything stupid," Dean says, barely audible.
Remus had a lovely glow and Sirius looked terribly smug. Harry could already tell they’d be great parents. “Yeah, he’s with his mum until we can fix this place up for him.”
“It’s a mirror of the outside sky,” Draco had told him. “Each constellation at its rightful place.”
wasn’t pointless murmuring.
“I want to fall in love with you.”
Was this the happy ending y'all expected? Probably not XD
Immediately Ron brightened and scrambled over to the tree, where everyone else was gathering.
His boyfriend starts to laugh. Draco’s gesturing at the Christmas tree. There are pictures hung all over it. Moving pictures.
“Harry!” Molly Weasley pulled Potter into her chest, effectively depriving him of oxygen. Potter looked utterly squashed by the time she let go. “Here to help out?” She asks, eyes twinkling.
promises to hold up.
“-No, I mean. Did you
The warming charm was like a wave. Washing over from his head down to his toes, which curled in pleasure.
“Well, I’d like to for you fuck off.”
Winter’s Watch, true to its name, was very wintery. Very wintery and definitely the sort of place couples would go on dates. Harry had to admit Luanne had very good taste in romantic spots. Just not the people to go there with. Krum was going to have a good laugh at Ron’s expense at the family dinner - that Harry would make sure of.
“But what if I keep going back and saying the things I’ve been saying. I still find myself thinking the bigoted things my father drilled into me and it makes me feel so awful…”
Draco glared up at him bitterly. “Come to hark at me, have you? I’m in your life debt now. D’you want me to get on my hands and knees for it?”
It was always warmer in the corners, he remembered Lily telling him once. Or had she meant something else by 90 degrees?
He picked up little Teddy, who immediately changed his hair from brown to black.
Draco sighed and lay down, resting his head on Harry's lap. He opened his book and began to read.
"You read my mind."
A cool breeze brushed past him, making his hair flop onto his face. Draco’s hair went just a little past his shoulders and was incessantly annoying. He made a mental note to cut it sometime.
. With Potter! Making friends with him, perhaps? Was this how making amends felt?
He stared at Harry, but it seemed like Draco was looking through him. At the wall.
It made Harry think Ron knew something he didn’t. It unnerved him.
“He made it for Lily too, on their first date.” Remus had told him.
“I found him in an alleyway, pretty much dead. He’d given up, Harry. Ran away.”
Harry sits on the bed, peach sheets clenched in his fists. Whatever Draco had to tell him, Harry meant to take it well.
going to get it now.
Just because Teddy liked Narcissa doesn’t mean Sirius is going to go easy on her.
The bruises kept forming faster than Sirius could heal them. Impacts from dark curses, constant falls and accidents.
"No!" Harry flings himself on the bed, draping a hand elegantly over his forehead. "I'm not okay, Dean. How can I be okay when my friend is pining over my other friend who is also pining over him?" Harry piously ignores the part about the weird dreams.
“Sit down here,” she leads him to sit on the thankfully orange-free bed. “Listen here, Draco. And listen carefully, okay?”
His muscles relaxed immediately and Harry let out a contented moan.
He didn’t think he was capable of maintaining friendships. Pansy and Blaise were in too deep to back out. That’s why they stuck to him. Not because he was a good friend or anything…
Harry freezes. His heart starts pounding against his chest at a rate much too quick to be  considered normal. He wonders faintly if it's beating loud enough for the blond to hear.
… What did you put in those chocolates?"
“And your hearing must be brilliant.” Yes, Harry was enjoying this. Thank you for asking.
“You don’t have to hide it, Harry,” Hermione whispered, brows furrowed as she tried to ice one of the shortbread biscuits. “It’s obvious you like him.”
Harry never really knew where he stood in Malfoy’s life. Just that  he’d sent one of those paper cranes to Harry, almost a week after they started eighth year. After a week of dodging each other like bludgers.
“I’m leaving.” He reiterates, gaze lowered. As if awaiting backlash.
“No chocolate until after dinner,” Remus and Andromeda say at the same time. They both start laughing.
Draco’d never been to the Weasley residence before, but he knew it well enough to recognise the topsy-turvy cottage. Even from a distance, it looked so utterly
Kids didn’t need to see Father Christmas to believe in him. They did it because of the stories told by those they loved.
Harry figured cuddling his godson would be better than pondering
Hermione shoved him. “You didn’t have to make it sound so vulgar!” But then she turned to Harry expectantly. Oh great. She wanted to know too.
“Can you... Turn it back?”
“Ha ha. Very funny.” Zabini threw a charming smile at Harry. He was indeed soaking. And wearing a towel around his waist. Harry didn’t think he’d last much long. “The lakes are all frozen over, Draco. Surely you know that.”
The flower was a weed. Sometimes used in teas or herbal brews or natural medicines in some cases. However, the plant itself, was largely ignored, and often poisoned or weeded. It was considered a nuisance, something to be overlooked and ignored.
Draco laughed lightly at that, leaning done to kiss the top of Harry’s hand.
“I… What-”
“Glad-” was all he managed before he voice was silenced by the other boy’s lips. It had taken them roughly six years to find each other, but they weren’t giving up now. Not even death cou- would stop them (never dare death, it doesn’t end well).
He blinked, and blinked again, but the note didn’t disappear.
“Dudley and I went shopping last night…”
--------------------------------------
“Well if you must know they are the most beautiful shade of emerald green with a soft grass undertone and little flecks of gold through them, but they burn like fire when you are upset! Happy?” he blurted, before clamping his hand over his mouth, realising a little too late, what he had just done. Harry just let out a low chuckle. He loved that laugh. It was soft and a little carefree, as though they hadn’t both spent their lives in the middle of a war, and almost died practically every single day.
“Think of the worst mistake you’ve ever made Hermione. How about… I don’t know- irreversibly wiping the memories of you parents? How does that stack on your list?”
“You okay, Harry?” Draco asked, concern plain in his voice, a whisper of magic moving around them as the blonde placed a silencing charm.
“Nooooooooo. Don’t go. Warm. Soft. Stay. Mine.”
“Malfoy.”
“When is it?” he asked, voice barely above a whisper, knowing she knew exactly what he meant. She sighed.
Draco passed countless families crying and holding on to one another or their deceased loved one. A group of red-haired individuals were sobbing around a body. He hated the fact that he knew what that felt like, and he hated the fact that so many were feeling it.
“It lacks structure.”
“Just stay with him. He needs to feel you here. To feel your magic around him strong and protective and welcoming. Just stay here. Talk to him. Read to him. Sing if you wish. Read to yourself. Lay beside him, or hold his hand. It is all up to you, Mr. Potter, but stay. Just stay.”
Everyone that was, except Draco and Harry.
------------------------
He just couldn’t understand it.
It didn’t take long for their routine to fall back into place. The sleepy days off. The strolls in the park, or leisurely hours spent together in coffee shops and cafes - though Draco always protested saying that his food was better, which it was, but Harry couldn’t let him get too big-headed. They had even been able to get tickets to see one of the most recent theatre productions. Though the people trying to network sometimes became tiresome, it was nice to get out of the house. They had been invited to the new production of pretty woman. It was one of Draco’s favourites, not that he would ever admit it. And so, their lives fell back into place.
Still, the blossoms didn’t halt entirely. They just slowed for a time… until Draco was able to return his attention to them.
“Young Master Harry, Tibby has prepared a room for you and some dinner. The mistress said you might prefer to dine alone. Should Tibby bring it to your room for you?”
“I’ll be expected to attend.” He sighed. “You know, it hardly counts as a date if your partner is
“I believe the proper response is ‘good morning,’” he smirked.
If he hadn’t been studying said face for years, memorizing each and every curve, he might not have recognized it. He had though. Not only that, green eyes bored into him. There was no way it was anyone else. It was Harry. It was his Harry.
The boy’s hands were careful and hesitant, but Merlin’s beard were they cold. He flinched once before the boy wandlessly cast a warming spell on them. It felt like an eternity between each breath, or each none-breath, before the tie slipped from his neck, as though it wasn’t enchanted. It was though, and that meant…
Harry Potter, the one and only, saviour of all, boy who lived, was sitting opposite him; his hair ruffled; eyes red and downcast; clothes looking as though his cupboard had thrown them at him; carrying books that looked like they weighed more than he did. He looked much the same as he always did, terrible, as though he had just walked off the battlefield. In truth, Draco wasn’t really sure any of them had ever left.
No. He had nothing to worry about. Besides, Hogwarts was safe.
It was, perhaps the only storybook on the shelf.
“Awww, what’s the matter Malfoy?” he said, pouting at the other boy.
The next morning felt lazy, but, with a ringing alarm, Draco was reminded that they did in fact still have to go to work.
“Of course, Headmistress.”
“Finally got some sense knocked into you and developed some semblance of taste, have you, Potter?” the blond asked, gesturing around the tailors shopfront. A shopfront Harry would not be frequenting too often if he was to see Malfoy again. “Vast improvement from your current, ummm…. attire,” he said, eyebrows raising as if to goad Harry on. He didn’t want to say it was working but… it was working.
“Shhhh,” a voice hushed, from somewhere to his… left? Harry didn’t know. Directions were confusing. He blinked wearily, finally looking up at the nurse. He was at St Mungos? “Good morning sir. I’m just here to do a quick check-up,” she whispered, and then glanced down to his right, and smiled gently. “Best not to disturb him. He hasn’t been sleeping.”
----------------------------
“It’s fine. Tell you what, why don’t you stay here, and if you like you can help the elves clear everything out, and Draco and I will go shopping for supplies?”
“Could you show me to my room please? And, yes, I will eat in my room.”
He spun the flower round in his grip before setting it down beside the last one he had preserved in water with a few charms.
Draco was one of three returning Slytherins. The other two played a smaller part in the war, and they had younger siblings still in the school, so it made sense. He seemed to be the odd one out even among his own house.
“Crystal.”
So, when a letter came weeks later, Harry was surprised to find it was from Dudley. He was even more surprised to see that one letter turn into a weekly correspondence between the two. Eventually, they would become longer, monthly letters, but the two always made sure to keep in touch. Harry would sit down to read the latest one and reply each Saturday night at his desk, as Draco came in with a warm cup of hot chocolate, plant a kiss on his husband’s temple and head off to read in the living room, a soft melody of whatever Draco was listening to that night echoing through the halls.
“The Ministry.”
Each of his classmates woke up differently. Some woke soundlessly, silent tears running down their cheeks. Some woke sobbing into their pillows. The worst were the screamers, and not because of the noise, the noise was just a given now. But the screams… The screams gave way to a kind of pain no physical injury could ever hope to incur or understand. Draco was convinced the pure agony in their voices would give him more nightmares. He had never heard anything like it, and he really hoped he never would again. Only one problem. He was one of those people.
it worked, it was going to take time.
The war had been hard on everyone. Harry and Draco most of all.
The two began spending more and more time together like that. They would sit and study or read together in silence during their ‘eighth’ year, more often than not trapped inside their own minds rather than in what they were reading. In the weeks and months they had come to spend in each other’s company, they had barely spoken a whole sentence to one another. Greetings often consisted only of brief nods.
“Friend? He wished he was my friend back in school?”
The gate swiftly closed behind him as he ventured forward. He wandered slowly toward what he assumed was the front door, gazing around at the various arrays of flowers and ornate vines. He kept expecting the be apprehended or trapped or kicked out or something but no one came. Not even an elf in sight.
“No. Neither of us will cause him any harm,” he said pointedly.
Before long he reached the front double doors of the manor. Tall glass windows lined either side showing what he assumed were drawing rooms or libraries or something.
“Sunday? It had to be Sunday, didn’t it? Seven days in the week and you chose Sunday?”
Draco didn’t reply. He didn’t need to. He knew that his Godfather would watch over them both. It was unspoken, but it was there.
Slowly the flower withered and died on his windowsill, as he was so consumed by his work he barely noticed it.
But… for courtesies sake, of course, he ended carefully pulling apart the satin bow to find a deep midnight blue suit. For merlin’s sake why did the man have such good taste? He wanted to hate it. He really did.
“I know,” he grinned. “Hey, you want to go out for a drink this weekend? Put the whole ‘prank war’ thing behind us?”
“Potter,” a voice called. A voice that Harry kind of wished he didn’t recognize. Unfortunately for him, he did. And even more unfortunate, this particular voice, he knew, wouldn’t be easy to get rid of. Merlin knew he’d been trying for years.
They were all sitting down for breakfast the end of the first week. Everything was much the same as usual.
The world could be pretty morbid and cold, but he was always there. Harry was always there; his tie never tied properly; his hair messy from constantly running his hands through it; his eyes always red and swollen from lack of sleep and tears; his robes always disorderly, and invariably covered in something - usually treacle. He was just always there. A little sad, a little broken. A shadow of the man he was before the war, but always there. But he wasn’t there anymore, and that simple fact alone left a gaping hole in the world. A hole that could never be filled. A hole that was red and painful and cold.
“Something wrong, dear?” Harry grinned, a little smug. Or maybe a lot smug.
“…better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.
“That’s fine Headmistress. Someone must teach the students after all. Who’s got you so concerned?”
“Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy. I want to know though…”
“Harry, I have been in love with you for years, but I know that you haven’t. So, it’s up to you. Whatever you like. Whenever you ready. I am drawing the line at casual dating with multiple people though,” Draco added sternly, at which Harry just laughed.
looked tall, much to Harry’s disgust, but the suit just seemed to make him taller. The black fabric slimming him, despite the fact that he already looked like a posh piece of spaghetti.
Another dandelion was on his windowsill when he returned in the morning.
! What a beautiful confession that was,” he snapped, venom dripping with every word. He turned from Harry then, and moved towards the edge of the bed to stand, not bearing to look at the raven anymore.
He really wished he believed he could believe his lie, but as he felt his eyes turn black, like a shadow overtaking his life, he knew once again a lie was all it was. Oh, how he hated his miserable life.
The story was… bizarre to say the least. Harry wasn’t sure the relevance of the story, nor the fascination, but he continued reading aloud.
He wasn’t sure how long it had been since he first went down to the dungeons, but he now found himself filing back up the stairs with a cohort of younger years, and the few Slytherins that had stayed behind to keep them safe.
As he walked out he saw Weasley laughing next to a concerned Hermione that kept watching Harry’s door. When she saw him walk out she raised her eyebrows in silent question, but Draco’s answering grin relieved any lingering stress on her face.
“Nor was I expecting to be here.”
“Depression? What? When-” Draco almost shouted, confusion overtaking his face. Harry was fine. Harry had been fine.
“Very well. Then you are both dismissed.”
No one slept the night anymore. No one was okay.
“And you were a git.”
-----------------------
He sat there alone, or he may have well as been, for all the talking he had gotten out of Draco lately, lost in his thoughts. He sighed.
“No, but it might be a good start if you even got ‘dressed’ at all. I’d hardly call what you are wearing, well, clothes,” he said, his eyes scrutinizing Harry’s loose-fitting jumper and strangely coloured trainers.
“Harry?” Dudley started abruptly, causing the raven to almost choke on his cereal.
--------------------------------------
He wasn’t really sure how long it had been, since he had arrived. He supposed someone might have come to look for him, and maybe they were trying, but it was less likely given the snippets he could remember from his last
“Ahhh. I was wondering when you might ask that.”
One moment there was a soft tingling sensation as the feathers brushed up against him, tickling his cheeks and nose, then he watched as those same feathers drew away from him and in less than an instant had cut clean through the rows of attackers, throwing them left and right.
He should attend more Galas with Draco. Maybe the Ministry events weren’t quite as dull as he counted them out to be.
“Oh, hi Draco. Sorry, I was a bit distracted.”
“We did it, you know that? We finally did it, my sweet darling valentine!”
The two boys sat in silence for a while, just enjoying the night around them, both lost in their own thoughts. Mostly they were lost in their own thoughts about each other. Not that they would mention that little fact to each other.
--------------------------------------------
They kept talking but Harry drowned them out, only paying enough attention to pretend that he was invested in the conversation whenever someone tried to approach him. He watched the blonde converse easily with Hermione, changing conversations and topics as though he was born to do it, and smiled.
“So help me Harry if you just said what I think you said-”
It was unlikely to result in another war, but the field Aurors fought them week in and out trying to wipe out each and every one of them, trying to bring them to justice. Each mission seemed better than the last, but as the wizards carved their way into the heart of the rebellion, they seemed to be facing darker magic with every curse. Harry had been in Draco’s ward more than once in the last week.
“Harry! It’s so good to see you! It’s been so long,” Dudley said smiling as he dragged his luggage towards them, at which Draco rolled his eyes and muttered something along the lines of ‘Strange that…’ but Harry glared at him out of the corner of his eyes and Draco focused his attention on shrinking their ‘guest’s’ luggage for the trip home.
“… I hate you.”
“Shhhhhh. Head. Pain. Quiet,” he murmured hands coming up to hold the sides of his still ringing skull.
If only he believed the lie.
“Fine, but then what about this afternoon?”
Life had become a little crazy. He had been trying to develop a new line of potions as a quick response measure for wizards in the field. Not all of them were making it home.
He watched Malfoy pause, steady himself closing his eyes as he did so, and then make his way towards the raven.
He left for the library later that evening, but had little luck in tracking down anything useful. There was barely anything there on Veela. They were a closed community. The only way to find anything out was the be a Veela, or their mate. And sadly, Harry was neither, so his research excursion did exactly nothing.
“At least one of actually spends our time focusing on things that matter.”
“What seems to be the issue?” Draco asked, voice becoming shakier by the second.
He was stupid. He should have seen it earlier. After all it was the bloody Saviour, when was he ever quiet, or without his friends? It made sense that the war changed him - it was going to be a very broken, albeit powerful, generation - it had changed a lot of people, him more than anyone. He had noticed the circles under the raven’s eyes getting a bit darker but didn’t pay it much mind - sleep had become a luxury many couldn’t afford.
Nineteen hours…
And just like that, with the brushing of a few feathers, the tables had turned. Harry was now the one avoiding a somewhat confused Draco.
“Git.” He paused, seemingly lost in thought for a moment before continuing, “You know, if you’re going try this whole ‘not dressing like a hobo’ thing, I recommend you acquire a descent cologne. There is a shop I know in France. I’ll call and tell them you need something less… like a homeless person.” Malfoy grinned, but Harry just glared at the blond. “Goodbye, Potter,” he said, as he breezed out, leaving a trail of what Harry had previously assumed to be the shops candles. He breathed in deeply, watching the prat walk away, never so much as glancing back, leaving a trail of scented air in his wake.
“Harry!” he shouted, wordlessly casting a silencing charm around the room as he walked - or maybe stomped - into the startled boy’s office. Ron, Harry’s partner, glanced at Draco briefly and just grabbed his jacket and started to leave.
He supposed he was probably used to it by now.
“Spoilsport,” the blond muttered, but it was accented with the of barest smiles, full of love and warmth for the man now dragging him towards to platforms.
“If this doesn’t work and you die, I will bring you back to life just to make you suffer for putting me through that. Clear?”
“Potter,” he returned. For the first time, he did actually look at him briefly and, Merlins above, the boy looked freezing. How long had he been out here? Without a word, he draped the blanket over the boy. He attempted to make it look nonchalant and uncaring, but based on the grin he received back, he wasn’t doing very well.
--------------------------------------------------
“Is there some reason you are endeavouring to intrude upon our grounds then?” she asked politely, lowering herself onto one of the expensive armchairs. She gestured for Harry to do the same but he wasn’t really paying attention, and instead started pacing back and forth before her.
The afternoon passed slowly as the group gradually repaired the damage. They probably could’ve called in someone to fix it, but it was easier doing it themselves. And, the publicity, and privacy - or lack thereof - was a bit of an issue. Besides, they were two of the most powerful wizards around. What could possibly go wrong?
“Trust you to ruin a perfectly good moment, Potter,” the blond drawled.
An even more familiar tune among fiancés.
Three weeks in and it still hadn’t gotten better. Quite the opposite in fact. Minerva had arrived one morning to find the Great hall coated in chalk dust, and the teacher’s lounge charmed alive. What made everything worse, was that because everyone knew the professors were engaged in such a war, many of the students had begun pulling pranks with no danger of being blamed.
“No. That wasn’t. But you know what else isn’t fair, is you bursting in here, pretending you know anything, and an assuming you can fix anything, when you can’t even make the people who loved you most remember your own name,” he snapped.
“Come on. You can do this,” the boy beside him whispered.
“Good morning, Headmistress. It is a lovely morning after all, and the castle seems excited. It’s rubbing off on me, I’m afraid.”
The room was dark.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” the blonde muttered sarcastically. “I must have missed the psychopathic murderer prompting his every decision. How could I have been so blind?” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Get inside with the other Slytherins. They are down in the dungeons with the younger years. Go!” Granger said, giving him a quick as she shoved him towards the castle entrance, and for a split second he thought he saw a trace of a smile and something that might have been relief cross her face. What on earth was that about? He took one last glance at Harry, before rushing inside and downstairs to the others. He had done all he could.
The next one appeared perhaps a week later. Maybe two? He hadn’t really been keeping track.
He didn’t know how long he had been there when a voice broke him out of his rumination.
“I swear to Merlin you are going to be the death of me, Potter.”
Draco was running out of ideas, and was only succeeding in spiralling down into a deeper abyss when the bell rung for eight o’clock, signalling the younger years’ curfew. An hour. He had made them wait an hour, potentially. The least he could do was say hi, or at maybe just hide in the bushes and see who it was.
“I’ve had them every morning for months! I need sustenance without treacle! I am seriously considering getting down on my knees to beg one of the elves at this point.”
“That’s great Dudley, really. So, when will you go?” Harry asked, his smile tight.
“First of all, it was a guess, and can you imagine how ridiculous it would have been if I came up with the romantic idea that my school nemesis was also my Soulmate? If I was wrong, I never would have lived it down. Secondly, tell me honestly, if we hadn’t been through all the terrible stuff we have been through, that you would still be here sitting beside me? We don’t like each other Draco. Sure, I stalked you a bit, but that only serves my point.”
“Till death do us part, Harry, and even beyond,” Draco said softly, gently pressing a kiss to his husband’s temple.
“Now,” the raven said, pulling away to look at his now blushing partner, “come on. We can’t make Dudley wait all day. He looked so excited.”
“It’s… it’s a -hostility thing. Instinctually, I know you have no ill intent towards me and therefore the feathers don’t sharpen around you.”
“Tibby thinks it should be just after midnight, young master.” He sighed.
“Master Potter, sir. What can Mitsy do for you?” the elf asked, popping out from nowhere, and scaring Dudley half to death.
-” Harry said, elbowing Draco, “-appreciate it. Come on. Let’s have some cereal-”
Having said that, Harry’s hair was now bright green. He wasn’t particularly concerned by this, especially given that Draco had just accidentally eaten a special herb amongst his food that would make his voice high-pitched for the rest of the day, as though he’d been breathing helium.
! Yes, I would love to.” He watched the blonde’s face light up and Harry almost let out a sigh of relief. His stupid body. First, he stopped breathing, then his heart stopped functioning, and now he’d just given up on facial expressions all together? Great.
“Excuse you. I had Crabbe and Goyl-”
The next week only improved when Harry arrived for his first class of the day only to find the entire classroom charmed to the ceiling. He glared at Malfoy during lunch, but the blonde pretended to pay no notice, feigning a look of innocence, his wings twitching gleefully.
“Hi Draco,” the boy said without turning around. He didn’t need to. Draco would have known that voice anywhere. He really wanted to run inside and pretend this hadn’t happened but he was here now. He sat down beside the raven-haired boy without looking at him.
----------
Some years it even managed to mess that up, as some people ended up walking around with no ties and some people with several - the year Dumbledore had accidently made it so your tie was on the person you were currently crushing on. Potter was damn near strangled that day, and of course each of the ties couldn’t be taken off until midnight. Though technically the exception to that was if the original owner of the tie took it off for you. That didn’t happen much though so the technicality was all but forgotten.
-------------------------------------
“He’s… He’s okay. There really hasn’t been much of a change. Nothing concrete to go on. We could lose him today or he might wake up tomorrow. I thought perhaps I had noticed a change in his breathing, but it was very late, and I couldn’t tell. But I don’t think it’s gotten worse, Lady Malfoy.”
Maybe he was just after the attention.
“Merlin save me,” the blonde groaned.
“Focusing on the wrong point here Potter,” Draco said, tapping his foot and pointer finger impatiently, though his ears had turned a little pink. “Why do you always refuse? Are you that afraid of being alone with me?” he said, more hurt escaping through in he’s tone than he would have liked.
-----------------------------------------------
“I found you in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom torn to shreds by Potter. He should watch himself-”
-------------------------
One minute.
“Oh, well in that case I’m done,” the blonde said making to leave but Harry only chuckled turning him around and pressing his lips to the blonde’s.
Maybe he knew how bad Harry was at making decisions.
“And we might have stopped by the ministry on our way home and… gotten us an extra day off to ‘spend with family’,” Harry concluded, a sleepy, but now also meek look covering his features.
“Draco Malfoy, is going to be our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,” she eyed him. “That won’t be an issue will it, Mr. Potter?”
overcooked- No, they were burnt. No getting around it… Burnt biscuits - well, Harry assumed that’s what they were - right under their noses. “Well, I mean, technically I didn’t bake them myself, because you know… the oven… But I got Misty to help and we made them together!” the boy continued to ramble.
It took a long time for Harry to go back to being himself. Months passed before Draco even thought about working again. Eventually though, at Harry’s insistence, he did, but Harry never returned to being an Auror.
The raven stepped into the hallway, softly closing the door behind him. He wasn’t sure what time was, but he didn’t really want the company. Well not the company on offer at least. He made his way to the door of Draco’s room, pausing for a moment. It was stupid. It was just a dream. Draco was fine. Draco was … Draco was dying.
“Harry Potter is dead.” Merlin Draco hated those words, and he hoped beyond hope that Harry had somehow managed to pull off his ridiculous plan and they weren’t true. It didn’t stop his heart from beating a little faster out of fear. Regardless, he followed the plan, and when he saw the mop-head’s head move he almost couldn’t contain his smile. Everything happened so fast. His parents were calling him. Harry was on his feet then he had tossed him wand. Harry was battling Voldemort as the people around surged forward to fight. Things were happening so fast it was hard to keep up. Harry’s ‘death’ had been the one eerily peaceful moment in the centre of the hurricane.
“It’s been a long time coming, mate,” Ron mumbled, patting Harry on the shoulder, before promptly walking out the door. Harry, after recomposing himself in the face of Ron’s
“Fine. He wanted me here. He wanted to say goodbye. Well here I am, and if he wants to say anything he can damn well wake up and say it to my face.” He took a breath. “I am staying. I don’t know for how long, but I will be damned if he thinks he can decide this on his own.”
“Or it being an option” Draco muttered from beside his husband, receiving an elbow to his ribs for it, though Dudley seemed not to notice either, or he was being very polite about it.
---------------------------------------------------------
. I am so sorry. Originally, I just thought you were really good friends, from school or something I guess.”
One hundred and sixty-three days, nineteen hours, and seven minutes since he had told Draco he knew about him lying to him.
He had decided to become the flying instructor a little while back. He had realised that he wanted to work, but much to the Minister’s displeasure, he was done fighting. Done fighting for something, done trying to be better, done ruining lives to ‘help’ other people. He briefly considered becoming the teacher for the Dark Arts position but quickly realised he didn’t want to be doing that all over again. He certainly didn’t want to end up there for the rest of his life. He was ready to find a semi peaceful position. He was ready to stop fighting.
The blond was leaning over Harry’s bed. Both hands over his. Hair messy, clothed as though he hadn’t changed in days, if Harry wasn’t mistaken, and looking far too malnourished for the raven’s liking. He didn’t hear the girl leave. His eyes found nothing else after landing on the sleeping boy. He didn’t know how he had gotten so lucky. Draco truly was an angel, even looking like a half-starved mess. His thoughts were interrupted when the hot mess spoke.
“To freedom,” Harry said, raising his now-returned wand, the others echoing it, and with that they were gone.
But several had appeared lately almost out of nowhere. Draco wasn’t sure what to make of it, but still they kept coming.
A visibly distraught Dudley just gazed on with confusion as he watched the two bicker back and forth. What confused him most of all is that towards the end, it looked more like they were flirting than fighting, but… that made no sense! They were- Were they even fighting?! He just- He wasn’t sure.
--------------------------------------
“Then give me an idea!”
“Hello?”
“Dies, Mr. Potter. Yes.”
“No hexing each other in the halls?”
But Harry could tell.
“Come here you.”
She took a breath.
He could hear his mother calling him, and absently he walked across the grounds to her. It was more lifeless and automatic than anything. He wasn’t really concerned where his body was taking him. It just didn’t matter anymore.
“Right, just… Draco?” the raven asked, his eyes pleading with the blonde to make this as painless as possible. Draco sighed, pulling out a hat.
It was only the house tables that were staring though. Nobody from the year eight table looked up. Most had stayed over the holidays, either to help repair the damage or with lack of a place to go, so they all knew. At the teachers table, Draco could have sworn money was being passed - as discreetly as possible - along the length of the table to the Headmistress, but he reasoned that he must have been seeing things.
It was coming up to the holidays. Draco had planned to stay in the castle and work under the Mediwitch in hopes of practising himself one day. He wanted to do some good in the world. The two hadn’t spoken - surprise, surprise - but he knew that despite Ron’s invitation to the Burrow, Harry was going to go back to Grimmauld Place for the holidays. He didn’t blame him. Some days it was easier to be alone.
“Trust you to be the only moron who doesn’t think that being a Veela’s bonded is a
He picked up the book on the bedside table,
“Harry James Potter! How dare you!”
He looked up when someone coughed above him. He’d gotten so lost in his little daydream, he hadn’t even seen Draco enter and ask for him.
“For what, Harry?” Draco asked, as he placed down a set of bowls.
“I tell you mate I am getting sick of these bloody treacle tarts and bacon and eggs. I’ve had them for well over a bloody month now,” Ron said, not even raising an eyebrow at their interlocked hands. He had been one of the first to be told.
The next day they waved Dudley off, suitcases - regular sized again - in hand, and the mistakes of past, if not repaired, then on their way to being forgiven. The pair walked back inside, hand in hand, Harry’s head on Draco’s shoulder as they went about making coffee and treacle tarts as another day began.
“Thank you, for saying that. It means a lot, but,” Harry hedged, unsure how to continue, “for the sake of honesty, I can’t tell you I’m okay. A lot of things happened in that place, more than either of us will ever be able to name, and I am not going to pretend it’s suddenly okay.
“Thank you, Mitsy. That will be all.” The elf bobbed once more before vanishing again. “Right, so, Mitsy will be keeping an ear out for you, so just call for her and she will appear. Please let her help you. I don’t need to replace a different room each day,” Harry smiled, as Dudley blushed.
“Draco?” the Headmistress said to his right, but he didn’t look up.
“Wasn’t really a choice, Mione.” She glared but it was half-hearted.
He didn’t come back for the rest of the week, but he returned the next Wednesday and the Wednesday after that, and most Wednesdays since.
“Third year.” Draco’s head snapped up, his frustration easily outweighing his hesitancy.
Dudley, still grinning clenched the tray of cookies harder and followed after Mitsy as she lead him into the dinner room. As the two left Harry snaked an arm around the blonde’s waist, his chin over his shoulder.
One hundred and sixty-three days, nineteen hours, and seven minutes. The number was burning into his skull.
“Malfoy, what in Merlin’s name are you talking about?” he asked after a moment.
Harry wasn’t a fan of clothes. Truthfully, he just wasn’t a fan of dress codes. Hermione had come by ages ago and organised and labelled his closet and outfits in order of formality and labelled each with examples of appropriate events to were them too. But nothing was labelled ‘potential make up/date with your ex childhood nemesis at a formal Gala with all of your co-workers, and the entire Wizarding world watching you’. Hermione’s labelling was failing him.
Harry took a breath, and reached for the clean set of clothes set neatly on one of the chairs. He didn’t know how or why he had clean clothes in his size, but he wasn’t sure he cared. He shrugged himself into one of the dress shirts, because apparently, that was as informal as it got.
Discarding the tie on the floor and he returned his attention to the shoes and cuffs. He unbuttoned several of his top shirt buttons.
“I think I can I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,” the other boy replied curtly, avoiding his outstretched hand.
“Hang on,” the blonde instructed, glancing his watch. “15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 …”
“That’s not fair-”
“… I love you.”
“Finish up,” the man half grunted. “Your parents want you upstairs when our Lord arrives.”
“I’d like to speak to Mr. Draco Malfoy please,” the voice said as Draco’s heart clenched. There was never a good time for ‘Mr. Draco Malfoy’. It was never, ever anything good.
Two people, alone, together. An impressive feat when you think about it. What’s even more impressive is that people feel lonelier in a crowd. Not when they were surrounded by their best friends obviously, but in a group of strangers, in a school, in a workplace, it felt lonelier than being alone in a small clique. That was how it started, being alone together.
This year was going to be a good year, he could feel it.
“Yeah I know. I know. That was underhanded and mean and I am sure I will feel terrible about it tomorrow, but last I checked  Hermione, it was still today. So, leave me alone.”
“You could never be a burden, not to me!” the other boy insisted, but Harry only smiled sadly.
He had come in a black suit, even his dress shirt and tie were of the same hue, though perhaps not the same fabric. Harry wasn’t certain. A Malfoy emblem, was planted atop a chain brooch fastened to his left lapel. The diamonds and silver of the brooch the only contrast to the blonde’s pitch black attire.
“Nope! You said it! No take-backs!”
“I didn’t know he was still- Can I see him please?”
“The transition is not so easy. He’s-” she gestured vaguely in the dark “-the reason you are here. It’s like a last sign. An SOS if you will. A precaution so that the Veela does not simply make the decision on their own. Had you known and rejected him, you probably wouldn’t have felt anything. Had you not known, you might simply have felt a drive to see him. But you came here without knowing how or why. It’s rare, but not unprecedented.”
Some days he swore he had seen a little colour return to the blonde’s pale features. Harry wondered though if that was simply due to a lack of sleep, or concentrating too long.
Draco’s eyes were downcast, both hands still wrapped around Harry’s. “Why in Merlin’s name didn’t- I could have helped. I love you Harry. Do you have any idea?” he asked, voice quiet. Harry felt tears fall to his hand, clutched in Draco’s.
And so, this is where he ended up. He glanced around at the soon to be filled tables, and could almost hear the deafening chatter that would soon echo through the halls.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said softly, the words barely audible. “I didn’t know.”
“Hmmmm. I wish I could undo this for him, you know. Go back and change his decision. Reverse a few conversations and misunderstandings, but it is not to be. For the record though Harry-” He glanced up. “-I understand his choice, even if the communication between the two of you is appalling,” the witch said, drawing a smile from the boy.
----------------------
“What?”
He simply assumed that something got in the way. He thought perhaps he was too work-driven. Too emotionally unattached. Too outspoken. Too much baggage. Too much trouble. Not worth the effort.
---------------------------------
It had been two years now since Draco had received his first flower. He was kind of sad he had let the first two wither and die, but he found them later and pressed them into bookmarks and kept them with him.
“So, boyfriends then?” Harry smiled, and Draco swore he felt his throat close. Instead of answering he pressed his lips to the green-eyed boy once more. “Is that a ye-” Harry was cut off as Draco enveloped his lips once more, pressing his tongue on Harry’s lower lip, deepening the kiss. Damn he loved this man.
“… how do you always know what to say?”
“I didn’t do it,” he managed to choke out.
“Hmm…”
“So…”
Maybe that was the best thing people could do for him now.
“Draco. Draco doesn’t have much longer, and any remaining side effects will die with him.”
“Well, I guess you have found me. What can I do for you Potter?”
Potter was wearing the same green tie he always wore on Valentines. He was never shocked at the tie around his neck and he never looked upset. Frankly he just looked like he was wearing his own tie, and damn he looked good in green. Draco never got close enough to really look at it, or see if he could recognise the knot style, but it looked like an exceptional knot all the same, not that he was paying attention.
“I nearly walked out so many times that die. I tried leaving when I saw the gate. I thought I might be hunted in the gardens, or turned away at the door. I saw Mrs. Malfoy, and wanted to run out of there. I walked in here and everything was so dark. And I saw you… and I knew I could have left you there. Not because I didn’t love you, but because I didn’t think I could go through that again, Draco. I’m not strong enough. I couldn’t be hurt again. Do you even know how many people I have killed now? How many loved ones I have buried? I couldn’t live with hope and I couldn’t fail to save you and I couldn’t kill you too. But I stayed.
! Are you serious? I am sick of this, Potter!” he almost screamed, quickly reverting back to the name he only ever used when he was upset with the git - thank Merlin for those silencing wards. “For once in our lives we seem to be getting on, and seemed to be on the same page, and yet whenever I ask you to come for a walk with me during our breaks, you turn pale and refuse! What is your problem? Make a choice and stick to it! Stop messing with my head. Merlin knows that if it wasn’t for you being such a bloody arse about the park thing I would have kissed you by now!” he finished, and watched Harry blink a few times.
“Congratulations to you too Harry. You played your part splendidly,” he almost smiled, but refrained. “Now, here are your wands. Get out of here before that buffoon comes back. I’ll see you on the battlefield…” he paused, “I would… appreciate it, if you didn’t kill me during… you know,” he continued hesitantly.
. He's lucky it's a hardcover. Harry would have chucked some socks at him, but that episode with Dean  yesterday had wounded his pride.
“May I?”
, not block the door?"
” He said in disgust. Sirius almost rolled his eyes.
“I haven’t given you my gift yet.” Harry said instead of the thousand other things he could have said that would have been less insensitive.
Also this might be kinda cliche (toaster thing) but I thought it was cute so...
“Accio Christmas every girl and boy.” Mrs Weasley and Potter sang in chorus. Potter spun him around a couple more times. Mrs Weasley shook her hands from side to side. They were laughing, having fun.
” He purred. He had the same look Millicent did.
"Let's make it so that they can't tell if we're fighting or fucking."
That dragged him into flames. Harry didn’t think he would ever forget the way the Feindfyre burned. The way Draco nearly killed himself trying to save his friends. Silent tears on his shoulder. Fingers just barely holding onto his jacket, like he was afraid.
“And then?” Sirius asks, but he doesn’t think he wants to know.
What? It wasn’t like Harry was going to eat the blueberry pie or whatever it was anyway.
His gaze fell on the left arm.
Draco stared after him, puzzled.
People thought karma was a bitch. Well, irony is a
have a hero-complex!
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Potter said softly, going around him and pulling his hair into a knot. Draco felt the ribbon being tied securely around his hair.
“Because you hate it.”
Fleur and Bill curled on a settee with the twins and their significant others in chairs near them. Charlie’s in a heated argument with Tonks over who gets the last chair.
Draco swats her playfully. “My arse is off-limits.”
So yeah, life didn’t turn out exactly how Harry planned it.
“Listen I-” they both said at the same time.
Batter splashed on the floor as Potter and Molly danced around. Draco yelped when Potter took his hand and twirled him around. He’d been more than okay just enjoying the scene from afar. “Come on, Malfoy. Sing with us! Accio Christmas…”
This has both Sirius and Harry's POV.
“Really I think she just felt left out.” But then again, the Marauders were always up to no good.
“He said he doesn’t transform, but Fenrir’s venom might still be affecting him somehow.” Remus rasps. “There’s not enough wolf in him to be able to transform, but I bet it’s tearing every muscle of his from the inside.”
Merlin. Sirius was right. He
Harry still hadn’t replied. It had been three whole days!
“Potter.”
Sirius shuddered. He casts a calming charm over the tense body.
They’d managed to fix up the living room, kitchen and Sirius’ bedroom that week. Harry wondered if he and Malfoy would have to share the other bedroom, or if Sirius would let one of them use the third floor. There was no way Sirius would let either of them make the sofa permanent residence.
“Now, where were we?”
Hermione and Millicent (??) had slipped into one of the tiny shops, leaving Harry and Draco in the rear.
“How are you so calm about this again?”
Harry leaned over to whisper to Lavender and Hermione- "He's becoming self-aware." To which both girls started cackling loudly.
Draco flushed, but this time he didn’t look angry. Just kind of embarrassed. “I think a simple ‘thank you’ wouldn’t suffice. I’d like you to help me… make something for him. And Professor Lupin.”
“Listen here, sickly Victorian boy,” uh-oh. Harry knew that look. It meant Malfoy was going to get completely and utterly annihilated. “I don’t know what kind of fucked up privileges you might have gotten, but people like my sister and I have had to literally drag ourselves through the mud to study here.
Their teenage years long gone, outbursts like those only meant love. The war left them burned and bruised. Desperate to keep one another safe. Alarm was understandable. Guilt often followed.
The danger was imminent. Panic bubbled in his throat. “Moony, we have to help him.” Sirius gripped his shirt, crumpling the logo of Queen, Moony’s favourite band. “He’s going to
Seamus had taken up an apprenticeship under renowned Pyrotechnician, Damini Inigo, which meant he was probably out blowing stuff up at the moment.
Honestly I don't know what to name these chapters but I feel obliged to cause I love it when chapters have names.
"Bye Harry, Malfoy." Neville shouts, dragging Ron between himself and Dean. They shut the door.
Molly tsked and squashed him in a fervent hug.
P.S Don't forget that Au Revoir means
And when Harry looked lower, he saw those lips - pink and a little bruised from their earlier tumble. The lips moved, but Harry was so enamoured he couldn’t hear a word. Not a bloody word.
The bed… left much to be desired.
“Harry, love, we know you love him.” Says his godfather. “He loves you too. Harry, he loves you so much.”
have five feet, Pomfrey really didn't have to put Malfoy that close. Not that Harry was complaining or anything. It was really easy to admire him when he was this close, and you know, not yelling or sneering. He looked pretty, actually, when he wasn’t trying to glare Harry’s head off. Not that he did that a lot these days. Just a lot of blank-faced staring and-
"Should we tell him the knives have a jelly jinx on them?"
“Like, he would always be dusting or making sure we had our coats on and shit. And one day he invited us to his place. It was the first time. James and his mum – that’s grandma Euphemia, Harry – they made us this poached egg in tomato soup. It was brilliant!”
“You’re Sirius Black.” Draco said, looking detached. Like he couldn’t care less. He probably didn’t. The boy lived in an alleyway for crying out loud. that can't be easy after spending half his life in a manor and the rest in a castle.
It was the
Harry nodded vigorously, half curious and the other half wincing from how tight Sirius was gripping his shoulder.
Sirius allowed a sigh. “I was in a muggle area Moony. I went as Padfoot. Now if you would-“
“You mean you had no idea before?”
He handed it to him wordlessly, and then watched as Malfoy marvelled over the intricate patterns. It was nice, if not a bit jarring, to see Malfoy with such open expression on his face. Harry wondered why he thought the Slytherin looked much better smiling. People don’t think that sort of thing about their former arch-nemesis. Actually, Malfoy was more arch-pain-in-the-arse than nemesis.
“If you must,” Draco sighed, his cheeks getting pinker as he held a hand to help Harry up. It must be getting really cold.
“Er… Thanks, I guess.” He mumbled, pushing his annoying locks off his eyes.
“Going to sleep.” He said, simply. The sentence felt incomplete without a ‘duh’ at the end, but Harry knew better than to expect Malfoy of all people to say ‘duh’. “Wouldn’t want me to have a cramped neck now would we?” Ah. There it was. The Malfoy bit.
It didn’t look odd, Draco sitting on the floor with them. The three of them huddled around the coffee table, which was just a pallet box turned upside down. Remus enlarged and thrown one of Walburga’s lacy coasters onto it to make it 'look pretty'.
“Save it.” Sirius says, leaning into Remus. “We aren’t mad, Prongslet. You were hurt. It was only natural.”
Snape, dressed like Father Christmas, with his trademark scowl on full display.
“So…” Tonks slurred. “When’s the big wedding?” She gestured between Harry and Draco.
He was grinning like anything, the bastard. “When did you get so flinchy?” he said instead. Potter wasn't saying it to be
"It's not just
“Uhm, yeah! Yeah, I did, actually. Thank you for asking.” Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard Malfoy sound as flustered as he did at that moment. And he
“I can’t trust you.” Draco said finally. “I don’t have a reason to.”
“No you don’t Harry James Potter.” Draco had tears in his eyes. “You being the bastard you are probably think I fucking hate you when it’s the opposite.” He let Harry hold him and buried his face in Harry’s kurta.

A cold, clammy hand on his shoulder made him jump.
"Yes, Dad." She rolled her eyes. "Cute dorks. Now go away, I'm trying to sleep and your bedtime story didn't even help. What even was the moral? Playing knife monopoly and  watching an unhealthy amount of soap operas finds your soulmate for you?" Trust a Ravenclaw to try find the
Wimbledon made a show of stuttering and protesting, but even he, the ever insolent fool, had to give way to the ferocity that was Della Archibald. She was the only reason they were conducting a proper trial instead of just extending his sentence.
“Okay ‘Mione.” Harry smiled. “Where is Ron?”
The carrots had a leathery texture. Draco always though they all came smooth and round. They also had these long, green stalks protruding from their heads. Perhaps this was a different type of carrot. He tried to push the knife into it, but the dratted vegetable kept rolling away. Draco held onto one end of the carrot and pressed the knife into it. Yes! Finally.
“When Draco wakes up. Tell him I’m sorry. And we love him. Both of us. We always have.” She apparated, leaving nothing but three white rose petals in her wake.
Draco didn’t like to believe the man had an ounce of musical talent, big-headed oaf. Nothing very religious about him or his beer belly either.
Harry had made little snowflakes and tiny trees on his. They looked colourful, if not completely unintelligible.
Hermione found that Seamus was within arm’s reach, conveniently, so she pinched his arm. He jumped and his wine sloshed onto the front of his white t-shirt, which was clinging to his softer-than-remembered midsection, not that she was
“It’s not fair! Depression’s just made

her frown. She was a fascinatingly emotional person for a girl who grew up as a Pureblood and then Sorted Slytherin House at wartime. She was so likely to burst into tears when teased or smile radiantly at the wrong people that all her Slytherin year-mates carefully guarded her to avoid an egregious social faux pas. Still, it was impossible to hold her own tendency to disgrace herself against her; she was too endearing.
look, complete with a delicate shudder. Draco reluctantly smiled, and she winked and returned her attention to Daphne’s shiny brown curls, conscripting two more sections with her pinky fingers and an expert’s ease.
Seamus blinked, then smiled slyly.
George noticed and followed suit. They grinned at each other.
“Of course,” Hermione admitted, “I don’t know that I was really objective. There was definitely something about it that — affected me.”
was invited rather than both of them, but that the Party grasped the concept of a plus-one. However, it seemed evident that she was at least half right, because while the wind’s warm tugs around his calves turned to sharp jabs in the small of his back, and Draco flinched and staggered like a puppet on hidden strings, Pansy stood a few feet away, still and unmolested.
Then they had paraded in his father, and Draco had only seen that his father’s hair was loose, lank and tangled, before he had averted his eyes.
George laughed much harder than the look of relief on Harry’s face could possibly have warranted. He grasped the jug, opened it, and took a few long swallows. He passed it to Harry, giggling, and then he was laughing again, loud, open-mouthed. Harry drank, and smiled, and listened to George laugh.
drinks?” Hermione couldn’t help pointing out.
For some reason the thought made him a little wobbly rather than high on remembered triumph. Draco hastily tucked his chin before Potter noticed, taking two slow backward steps.
“Are we calling these glasses?” Padma asked, frowning doubtfully at the small paper cup in her hand. Seamus had found a dusty, somewhat-squashed stack in the boot of his car to accompany the wine.
“Here,” Ron said, pulling out a chair for her at the kitchen table. There was an unmanned scrub brush churning busily away at a pot in the sink, wreathed in bubbles, but they appeared to be alone otherwise. Ron turned a second chair around so that he was straddling it backward, leaning against the back, and picked her hand up again. “Now, start at the beginning. What happened?”
fat!”
“Obviously,” said Parvati. “And you can have Seamus as well.” Neither Seamus, Ron, nor Hermione were sure how to take that pronouncement, but they rearranged themselves with two of the books on the end of the study closest to the window. Hermione saw a flash of light, and when she looked out in alarm, found that a burst of flame had erupted in the garden and already disappeared.
Later he’d realize it wasn’t a hammer, but a portion of a limb. Resembling that of a horse, but oversized, because it belonged to a Centaur. Binns had never lectured on the near-eradication of the Centaurs centuries before, but there had been a book about it in the library at home. He’d curled beside a window and read by Lumos, and then by the blooming light of dawn, the doors snugly closed so he would not be disturbed by Narcissa’s weeping.
“No. Don’t be silly. I’m fine. We’ll find him together.” He kissed her forehead. Hermione nodded and sniffed, trying to rein herself in.
Draco held his ground until she paused in the doorway and looked over her shoulder. Draco could see that beyond her was not the sad ruin of the family’s once-famous gardens, but a grass-paved lane lined in smooth ivory-trunked trees laden with leaves so dark a green, they looked black in the night air.
Up until a few months ago, telling Molly Weasley there was nothing she could do for you was like throwing down a gauntlet, sparking in Molly a deeply personal need to prove you wrong.
. That single clear and focused thought bobbed to the surface of Draco’s tumultuous mind, and then he
Draco stared over the heads of the trio clustered at the fringe of the Party where he and Pansy had come out to the trees. He barely registered them as two sixth-year Hufflepuffs and an older Slytherin whose name he barely remembered, four or five years ahead of them in school at least. And then his gaze caught on Potter. All of him, all at once, unmistakable.
“I think there’s something else. Something more. I’m not sure about anything beyond that.”
Draco remembered looking down at Potter on the train. The fire that imbued Draco in the moment before he’d raised his leg. It had possibly been better than sex, stepping on Potter’s face.
He turned, beaming, to Pansy. “It was just charmed into the plaster, not the wood. It was probably one spell meant to treat the whole Manor, and most of the ceilings don’t have the beams . . .” He trailed off at Pansy’s blank look, recalling belatedly that he hadn’t mentioned the spider to her.
had advertised the installment of cells and prisoners there as a great mercy, a first step toward the justice system reforms promised by the new order.
Ron looked up sharply, took in her expression, and shook his head, hurrying out of his chair so he could kneel in front of her and hold both of her hands instead of one.
“But you weren’t here, at least for a while,” George said.
“Oh, it’s an all or nothing sort of magic, you know?” Ron said seriously, but he caught her eye and winked to let her know he hadn’t missed the fact she was teasing. “They never managed it. I don’t know if Fred would be thrilled or furious to hear that Harry did.”
“Harry, what are you doing?” Hermione exclaimed, but it was too late. Of course Harry had picked up the mysterious jug of unknown origin and drank from it.
“This isn’t my natural hair color. I once flirted with Slughorn to get out of a disaster mark on a potion. This is the first time I’ve had Muggle wine, and it’s not so bad.”
“Seamus will drink,” said Lavender, “and get a boost to his ego, based on the way Harry’s ogling his arse.”
Potter’s spiteful expression fell away again, and in its place was another unfortunate variation, this one bordering on self-conscious. Draco could not look away, it was too fascinating, too cringe-inducing, too awful, like watching someone cry or the ritual sacrifice of a small furry creature.
Pansy lifted her sharp chin. “I’ll teach them how to appreciate the wine, I suppose.”
Just under an hour later Harry was bent over his knees, quaking with laughter, and Hermione had found a few tears after all, she laughed so hard in turn.
“Well, I’m not doing that,” Draco said, his voice getting louder and higher with every word. “You go! I’m staying here!”
And then, like someone had reached inside his mind and tidied up, the jagged edges of his emotions smoothed. His thoughts calmed. He got slowly to his feet and stretched. Then he strolled calmly back toward the clearing, wondering who might be waiting there.
The funeral had brought all the Weasleys back to the Burrow over the past few days, but the house was quiet now, like perhaps they’d dispersed again. Hermione almost wanted to apologize on Harry’s behalf, that he’d had the nerve to get himself into trouble when Ron should be mourning his brother, but an instant later she chastised herself for the passing thought. Harry hadn’t done anything on purpose. And it wasn’t fair to begrudge him his boldness and impulsivity now that, in a postwar world, they were no longer convenient.
Or it could have been sparked when Luna pricked her thumb on the thorns in the bouquet she’d brought along to leave on the coffin. The tiny wound didn’t close for hours, so that she left a tiny trail of herself from the hedge where she’d gathered the brown, twisting brambles in the first place to the hallowed earth they broke to bury Fred, and in the hot, damp clasp of Ginny’s hand, and on Harry’s temple when she’d reached up to brush back his hair.
Heads up for some mentions of Fenrir Greyback doing his bull and also past self harm. Lotta scars. Also it doesn't coincide with the HP timeline at all but idc about that.
Whispy curtains floated around the cherry wood bed, like clouds just minutes before sunset.
Usually Sirius didn’t let confirmed-death-eater-and-probably-abusive women hold his baby. Yet, for some reason, he trusted her.
“I’m leaving,” Draco says, suddenly. Narcissa’s blue and Lucius’ grey eyes stare back at him, and for a moment, Sirius just stares.
For Merlin’s sake. What was wrong with him, thinking about wading inside Draco Malfoy and all. What he should be doing is apologising.
“Ready?” Wait, what?
He wasn’t able to participate in the war.
Behind him came Blaise Zabini. “Was a serial killer in here? Oh, it’s just Potter and Draco.”
Sirius laughed again. It sounded hollow. “Trust me kid, it was better when she didn’t notice me.”
“How would you react when an absolute
“M’ arm’s cramping.” Draco says, breath warm against Harry’s neck and he really shouldn’t be turned on by this but he is.
Idk what I just said lol. Cannon stays cannon, even if cannon is stupid. That's it.
“At least Ron and Hermione are helping.”
“Potter!” Harry jumped at the hiss.
“Slept in the slums and ate out of the trash for a while before James found me.”
Draco looks like he is about to have another panic attack. “I… Thank you for that. For everything.”
If fact, Malfoy seemed to be… steering them? Since when was Malfoy an expert of sled riding? Was that something that happened to people? You get shoved down a mountain and suddenly you become adept at winter sports.
“I’m sorry.” Harry mumbled. It wasn’t the right thing to say, but it was the only thing he could.
Potter grins widely. “I can help make the carrot cake?”
A pair of mismatched eyes stared at him from above. One was a light grey and the other a blue so pale, it was hard to tell they were two colours. But they were. And under those eyes was a pointy nose dusted with the softest of freckles - inconspicuous, just like the difference between the two eyes.
Sirius gave him the closest thing to a shrug a dog could manage.
Harry didn’t regret staying back to help repair Hogwarts. It was his first home. In a way, he kinda owes it to the place. He does, however, feel bad about not visiting his godfather.
“Oh yeah? Then why the bloody hell did he get Crucioed when he was five? Was that your idea of a birthday present?”
Y'all. I know it's been thirteen days, but I admit I didn't start writing this chapter until yesterday, lol. Enjoy?
Draco took a deep breath. “I can’t do this anymore. Being so close to you these past days has only made it worse. I thought maybe it would go away but it didn’t and I really can’t take it anymore.” See? Draco hated him.
The rain made his hair stick to his forehead and Sirius couldn’t help but wince at the fresh cut on his lips. They were turning blue from the cold.
“So I just have to trust that when the time is right, the right person will just show up at my doorstep or something?” It sounds stupid. It sounds so, so stupid.
“So you’ve already had the baby?” Draco asks.
Draco tries not to glare at the Wizengamot official, strutting in his ugly plum robes. They weren’t even a
Now, after one too many shots of eggnog, the gossip had begun.
Blabbering excuses for whatever abuse he'd sustained.
Seamus pouted and Harry felt Dean's fingers dig into his sides through his robes. And to  think Harry was doing this all for him. Atrocious.
"It was nice knowing you, Harry." Nev shrugs. He was back to being a stonehearted troll again, it seems.
Harry felt a grin tug at the ends of his lips. "Would you happen to have a secret stash of  alcohol and an unreasonable amount of knives?"
Harry coughed a bit in surprise at the amount of potions. "W-What do all of these do?" He asked hoarsely, still in disbelief at the fact that there was a baby growing inside him. This was just too weird.
Those words made both of them freeze. Harry felt the strong urge to throw himself into Draco's arms and kiss the living daylights out of him, but he wouldn't dare carry out that urge.
Draco's face twisted with something between annoyance and confusion. "Can we not just apparate? Or Floo?"
Healer Denbright was writing his symptoms down on a pad of paper, almost at such a speed Harry couldn't believe it. He brushed a hand through his unruly raven colored hair while waiting for the Healer to finish.
Draco shook his head incredulously. "You are
Denbright gestured for Harry to sit on the examination table, which he gladly did so. He sat with his hands in his lap, fiddling with them.
Harry could almost see the grimace that likely sat on Malfoy's pointed face as he wrote it. He simultaneously felt elated and a bit confused. Malfoy's apartment is atrocious? Where has he been living these past two years? Harry could only guess. He sincerely hoped (for some reason, he didn't know) it wasn't as bad as he was imagining; he'd thought Malfoy at least had a decent house, something worthy of a poncey Pureblood like him.
"He says he can't 'turn up his nose' at my offer anymore," Harry rolled his eyes, putting up air quotes. "But...he said something else a bit, eh, concerning, I guess." He touched the line on the letter and let Hermione read it. Her face scrunched up a bit, a telltale sign that she knew something he didn't. Harry raised his eyebrows at her.
