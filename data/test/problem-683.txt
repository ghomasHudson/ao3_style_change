They decided to call it a night around 2AM and most walked away feeling like McGonagall’s goals were more attainable than they had just few hours prior.  It would be an interesting year one way or the other, that was for sure.
As far as it making news, there’s potions to help with addiction and withdrawal.  Between those and a story about a strong case of laryngitis, it was easy to keep it hidden.  Actually, the only people besides the healers that know are Benji, myself, and now you.   The band all believes the story about sickness and vocal rest.”  Draco sighed.  “Harry, I’ve done so many things I’m not proud of in my life.  I couldn’t begin to even pick out a worst but I’ve never felt as empty or as lost as I did last night when I found out what I’d unknowingly left behind.  Please, give me a chance to show you how sincere I am in saying I want to be a part of his life.” He looked up into Harry’s eyes and didn’t know if he was imagining the flash of hurt or not but decided to lay all his cards on the table anyway.  “I would also like a chance to be a part of yours if there is a place for me.  If not, I understand, but I would like to get to know my son either way.  Can you please tell me about him?”
Harry decided to go for a walk after breakfast.  There was so much to decide that he felt he was drowning in all these choices.  He knew living with Sirius and Teddy was working for now, but long term it wouldn’t.  He loved Teddy with all his heart but he had just turned 18 years old himself.  He wanted to be the fun uncle that you visit, not the other parent you live with.  Besides that, he felt Sirius deserved the chance to raise at least one of his godsons.  He took the loss of Remus hard and it nearly killed him when Andromeda said she could raise him alone.  Thankfully they worked it out where everyone was happy.  Andromeda agreed to remain in her role as grandmother and got Teddy on the weekends and occasionally took him for several days at a time through the week to give Sirius a break.  If he was going to get serious about living his life wouldn’t he need someone to share it with?  Did he really want to attempt to start a relationship with someone only to bring them home to a crying child and the questions that would entail?  What if things got heated?   Would definitely kill the mood if mid snog your godfather walked in or worse a big black dog jumped on your lap to halt progression.
As he felt the last of his hangover leaving he started thinking about Smoke once again.  The elusive person had not been far from his mind since the day he read Dumbledore’s letter.  He had no clue how to go about finding out who it was or what might help track them down.  He had debated simply writing a letter for Luna to publish in The Quibbler explaining just how much the wizarding world owed Smoke and urging them to come forward.  Upon further thought he realized that even though that was the easiest route, it could prove fatal as well.  There were still a handful of rouge Death Eaters out and if any suspected who it might be they could be killed.  On top of that, Smoke might not like the notoriety.  They hadn’t come forward themselves and short of being killed in the final battle that seemed to be the case.  Harry couldn’t fault them for that.  He hated that every tidbit about him was reported as if it was the world’s right to know.  For now, he’d wait and listen.  Hopefully by Christmas he’d at least have a few more hints.
Before Harry replied he realized it had been a while. He saw them after the final battle and then they attempted to go out to celebrate a week later which had ended when they were mobbed when walking into the Leaky. They exchanged owls discussing trying again but Harry felt too much pressure from Ginny to rekindle their relationship to go to the Burrow and plans just became vague and drifted away. The last owl he remembered sending off was well over 3 weeks ago. He was both shocked and ashamed. How had he not realized he had ceased communication with his two best friends? Why was it so easy to let it slip away? Shame faced he looked Sirius in the eye and admitted he couldn’t even recall when it was or what they had spoken of. He had no idea where they were or what they were doing.
“Wow, thanks Pans.  Love you too.”  Pansy held a dear spot in his heart.  Contrary to the school’s rumor mill the two had never dated but were instead simply the best of friends.  He was thankful to call both Blaise and Pansy his best friends and his love for both ran very deep.
With that Harry felt his heart tighten and wondered if it was possible to fall in love with someone more every day.  They spent the next couple of hours exchanging stories that had happened to each of them through the past few years as well as reminiscing over their years at Hogwarts. “Well, I won’t lie, I’m ecstatic to know you’re planning on staying and Caelum will be too.  I haven’t told him you are in town or that I was meeting you today.  I wasn’t sure how it would go.”
“You misunderstand me.  I don’t mean to lecture you, I’m actually planning on asking you a favor.  As you know, last year there was no Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Therefore, we have not only this year to teach what is on the O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s for the fifth, sixth, and seventh years, but what they should have learned last year as well.  It’s why we had to bring in a separate professor for your class.  Professor Daniels just doesn’t have time to add in any more classes.”
floor. I have few new professors to introduce to you before I dismiss you.  Please join me in welcoming Professor Charlie Weasely as our new Head of Gryffindor and Care of Magical Creatures professor.”  She paused to join the applause.  Hagrid would remain as keeper of grounds and keys but she could no longer allow him to teach students.  His class sizes continued to shrink and while a few students sat for their N.E.W.T. none continued past his O.W.L. classes.  Charlie had been looking for something to keep him closer to home and she couldn’t think of a better Head of House to replace her.  He was young enough to relate to them and hopefully help them heal.  “Also joining us this year to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts is Professor Allison Smith.” She again paused for the applause.  Allison was a former Auror from the States. She would be fair to all houses as a fresh pair of eyes.  “And finally, filling our Transfiguration opening, Professor Gemma Farley.”  Gemma was a Slytherin and former prefect who excelled in her teaching.  “While Professor Slughorn will remain as our potions professor he is stepping down as Slytherin Head of House and Professor Farley will be taking over for him.”  The applause and shouts of cheer from the Slytherin table was nearly deafening.  Most of the students remembered Gemma and how fair and caring she had been as a prefect.  When she approached Horace with the idea of him stepping down he grabbed on to the idea like it was a tin of his cherished crystallized pineapple.  He wanted to retire completely but she somehow managed to convince him to stay another year or two while she looked for a replacement.
Pansy knew Draco was nervous about a few of the shops and wasn’t sure if the shopkeepers would even accept his money but she didn’t mention it.  Instead she agreed and they set off to Flourish and Blotts to add the books new to the shopping list to what they already had from last year’s attempt at their 7
“As unbelievable as it is, no, I did not.  Father, as you can imagine, was not happy that I preferred wizards to witches.  It was not acceptable behavior for the Malfoy heir.  My responsibility was to bury any ‘perverse’ thoughts and desires, marry a respectable pureblood witch, have her bear me a son, and raise him into a proper Malfoy.  He would have removed any book that mentioned it from the library and banned Mother from even speaking of the possibility.”
He made his way into Caelum’s room to wake him and got him set up at the table with a bowl of cereal and some juice.  He then pulled out this mobile and sent off a text asking Hermione if she or Ron could be on call to pick up Caelum.  He didn’t know how long the talk with Draco would take or how it would go so a backup plan was the safe choice.  Then he checked in with Fred to make sure George was feeling better today and let them know he wouldn’t be in today.
on himself.  He cleared his throat and began “Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are all doing well tonight.  Just wanted to say a few things before you all make any more of an arse of yourselves. I have heard many of you say there are those among my group that deserve The Kiss, Azkaban, to be homeless and without a knut to their names, and most worryingly I’ve heard several comments about how to aim an unforgivable at them without getting caught.”  He looked around at the guilty faces and noticed the Slytherins trying to slink into the shadows.  “Absolute bollocks I say.  I don’t care if you agree or disagree with what they did, or in most cases what you assume they did, but piss off.  The war and the trials are over with and those found guilty are either dead or locked away.  All you are doing is setting us up for another war among ourselves in another 20 years or so.”
Hermione nodded and noticed Harry making his way down from upstairs.  “Good morning, Harry.  What are your plans for the day?”
year entry into any common room is ‘Moving Forward’, do not take advantage of the fact that this allows you to enter another house’s common room.  If reported, you will be cleaning bedpans without magic for the rest of the school year.
“Draco?!” Theo shouted in wonder.  The looks of disbelief and shock on his friend’s faces were quite humorous.  Theo was joined by Blaise, Daphne, and Millicent.
They had finally reached the castle and began walking towards the Great Hall.  “I suppose we sit with the rest of the Slytherins?” Pansy asked them.   The room looked the same as it always had.  Large table at the front with professors slowly making their way to their seats and the four long house tables pointed the opposite way.  No one had come up with a satisfactory reason for why they weren’t to purchase new Slytherin robes so her confusion was understood.  The three agreed and made their way to the end of the table.
“10 points from Ravenclaw, Miss Fawcett.  I will not let hatred and anger fester in my school.”  Headmistress McGonagall said as she passed on her way to the head table.  Albus might have ignored the way the Slytherins were treated in the past but she refused to do so.  There were many reasons so many had joined the ranks of the Death Eaters over the years but his refusal to stop the blatant favoring of other houses didn’t help.  She turned and acknowledged the surprised faces of the Slytherins.  “Glad to see you all made it back.  Settle in, sorting should start soon.”  With that she made her way to the head table and took her seat.  She had a long road ahead of her to change the deep seated views but she was determined to try.
Draco had heard of The Dragon’s Lair but had yet to visit it.  It was a newer club that straddled Diagon and Knockturn Alley known for loud energetic crowds and heavy-handed bartenders.  He had hoped the party would be a private affair but when had fate dealt him a fair hand?  He sighed and bowed his head in defeat knowing he still had to go as he had given his word.  He knew if he did his mother would simply use it as ammunition for her campaign for his return to school.  He penned a quick reply to Blaise, sent Artemis off with it, then set off to brew for another hour or two before he had to start getting ready for the party.  He was close to a break through on improving the taste of Skele-Gro and could soon move on to ways to reduce the pain the potion brought.  Hopefully that would improve his mood enough so he’d be fit for company tonight.
This isn’t really the ideal location to talk about it though.  It’s a highly sensitive subject for a member of our year and while I
“You might be a knobhead, but you are our knobhead.  Besides, I’ve done worse to you over the years than whatever slight you’re imagining you’ve done to us.”  Ron hugged Harry back before asking “We’ve not missed breakfast, have we?”
We were doing a show in New York about a year after I joined when I overdosed.  We were on the last leg of the tour and were planning on taking some time off before recording the next album.  I didn’t know mixing alcohol and cocaine was dangerous and probably wouldn’t have cared if I had known.  One minute I was backstage waiting to go out for our set and snorting an insane amount of lines, the next I woke up in a hospital I’d never seen before.”  Draco paused and took a deep breath.  He never imagined he’d have anyone to tell this story to because he didn’t think anyone would ever matter in his life.
Draco and Theo were lost in talk of potions and Draco did nothing more than nod in acknowledgement that the girl had joined them.  During Voldemort’s siege of his family’s manor he had spent most of his waking hours locked in his room behind as many wards as he knew just theorizing how potions could be changed or revolutionized.  Many times, Severus would serve as a sounding board for ideas that either helped push him in the right direction or point out potential failure.  It had become his outlet for the war, for the fear, and if he was being completely honest with himself, for the yearning for his mate.
You would still reside with the 8th years and take all the classes you requested.  You would of course, be paid monthly and it would give you an idea on if full time teaching was something you wanted to do.  While we could provide you with a lesson plan, you might do better to provide your own.”
After the breakout she was instructed by my father to ‘teach’ me occlumency and how to be a good little Death Eater.  Her training left much to be desired and for every time I failed to block her intrusions into my mind I received a
At a quarter past 10 the guest of honor finally arrived.  “This party seems extremely boring.  I’m here to elevate it from snooze worthy to spectacular.” Pansy haughtily joked “Obviously, you morons can do nothing without me.”  She finally lowered her upturned nose and noticed Draco among the crowd of her friends.  Tears immediately fell from her eyes.  All the unanswered owls and refused invitations were forgotten.  By some miracle Draco was here.  She refused to question why she had been given such a wonderful gift and instead threw her arms around his neck hugging him tightly.  “Draco,” she sobbed “I’ve missed you so much, you idiotic prat.”
“Harry, people are going to gawk, gossip, point, and whisper be it at Hogwarts or the Ministry. Unfortunately, you will never be able to walk down Diagon Alley without someone noticing and making a production out of what kind of underwear you picked out or why you chose fish and chips this week when you had shepherd’s pie last week and what that might mean for the rest of us. However, you cannot let that keep you from going out and living life. Hell, go out and get a brainless job in muggle London, find a club and get a little rowdy, organize the library, or plant a garden. I don’t care what you do as long as you actually do something other than stare out the window watching other people walk by living their lives. When is the last time you actually spoke to Ron or Hermione?” Sirius asked.
Ron and Hermione both tried to dissuade him but he over ruled them by pointing out they would not be the only ones and if they didn’t want it they did not have to use it.  He continued on with his other thoughts that were vaguer that he felt he needed more direction for.  “I know that you will disagree with me Padfoot, but I know he saved my life more than once, gave up his chance at happiness and eventually his life to help defeat Voldemort.  I want to somehow honor Snape.  I’m not sure exactly how yet but I am determined that his name will live on hopefully for as long as mine will.  Which serves two purposes, it will both honor him and annoy him for the rest of eternity.”
With that an elf popped in with two plates and a jug of juice.  As they served themselves and got settled in to eat, Minerva collected her thoughts.   She had a lot she wanted to change and she hoped that this young man before her would be part of the Hogwarts family for years to come so sharing her vision with him didn’t seem out of order.  “I have many things I’d like to see happen.  The most radical thing I’d like to change is the house system. I’ll be the first to admit that my pride in Gryffindor is abundant.  However, we split the students on their first night in the castle and most of the time they never cross house lines again.  It is important to have classmates and friends who understand you.  I doubt a first year Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could have found a single thing in common enough to wish to spend even 5 minutes of time together pleasantly.  Having a safe place to return to, such as the common room, is very important.  But so is meeting others outside of your comfort zone.  I’m hoping that the rest of the school sees the people in your year having fun together both in the halls and outside of them as well.  One tiny spark sometimes is all it takes.”
Pansy couldn’t hide her amusement at how frustrated the pair was.  Sure, she could have warned both that shopping wasn’t a quick trip for any of them but an all-day event, but she decided to see instead how far they were willing to indulge the whims of others.  Draco and Blaise could happily spend all day in this monstrosity of a building looking in every corner of every store and still want to do more shopping afterwards.  She had to admit, a lot of the clothing wasn’t terrible.  There were a few outfits for her she had stuffed in Draco’s mountain of clothes.   Plus, it was nice to be over looked by people walking by.  The public outcry hadn’t been as bad for her as it had been for some, but she still faced a lot of vitriol from the wizarding world.  Not one person glared, spat, or yelled at her so far.  A few even smiled at her as they walked past.
Godric’s Hollow was also easily ruled out.  Harry had no desire even if it was renovated to live where his parents were brutally murdered and it seemed too obvious of a choice.  When the papers got wind that he moved out of Grimmauld and renovations were occurring in the tiny town most would be able to put two and two together.  With that, Harry returned his eyes and thoughts to the list in front of him.
years stay behind as I need to escort you to your new dorms and explain a few things to you.  The rest of you are dismissed.”
Hermione smiled happily.  She adored ‘her boys’ as she’d come to think of Harry and Ron, but there was a part of her that had always longed for someone to share this part of herself with.  Before finding out she was a witch her parents and her could be found spending hours talking and debating all kinds of historical facts and thoughts about new scientific advances.  Weekends were spent at museums and public lectures whiles summers were filled with trips all over the world to satisfy the thirst she’d always had to learn.  There was a knowledge gap now that just couldn’t be crossed between them and it sometimes broke her heart.  She had come to accept that while she could still soak up everything she could find in books she’d never really have that connection with someone again.  “I would love that, Theo.  We’ll see you back in the common room later, Harry.”  She kissed Harry’s cheek and walked away with Theo with a hope in her heart that her new acquaintance would soon become her friend.
“I’m not setting out to change his legacy.  I know who he was but I feel this is the right thing to do.  Now I just need to figure out the how.  There’s no rush though and if it makes you uncomfortable to help me figure it out then I understand completely.”
“Wow.  Um…It’s a great offer.  I’m not really worried about the money but I guess it’d be harder to complain about grading homework and dealing with troublesome students if I was getting paid for it.”
“I know my parents left me theirs, but I don’t know who else could have left me anything.” Harry replied.
But then at the same time I remember who I was when I did walk away and wonder if it wasn’t for the best.  I don’t know if you realize how broken I still was.  I started drinking heavily but soon that didn’t numb the pain enough.  After joining the band, I discovered muggle drugs and never imagined they’d have much affect on me.  It didn’t take long until I was spending a few thousand a month on cocaine and sleeping with whoever happened to look my way.  The future I had always imagined for myself was gone so what did it matter if I screwed up whatever life I was faced with now was my thinking, I guess.
They all seemed to agree and began discussing who wanted to room together.  Neville and Hannah asked for a room alone as did Dean and Seamus.  Justin and Ernie invited Stephen to join them in a room and Pansy offered for Susan and Morag to join her and Millicent in a room.  Padma and Pavati requested a room alone together leaving 5 rooms empty with Harry, Hermione, Draco, Theo, and Blaise remaining.  They each decided to take advantage of having a room to themselves and walked upstairs to change and pick out the rooms.  Harry took the first door he came to and Hermione took the one next to him.  Neville and Hannah had climbed the stairs behind them and followed suit by taking the next room they came to.  Dean and Seamus took the one after that and Padma and Pavati finished out that side of rooms.
Draco opened his eyes after landing and huffed out a laugh.   They stood in the stands of the Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts.  “While it’s obvious I’ve missed a lot of news and gossip over the years, I’m pretty sure McGonagall is still Headmistress so how in the world did you get through the wards with apparition?”  It wasn’t the first question Draco thought he’d ask Harry nor was it the most important, but it was at least a way to start a conversation.
Draco raised his glass in agreement as the two walked away.  He was nervous but felt at peace with his choice to open up.  He couldn’t wait until tomorrow to see where it would lead the three of them.
“It says I have manners and the faith that one day you might find yours as well.  I hold out hope that it will be before I bludgeon you to death with a clock but you never know.” Draco grinned and rose from his table.  “Let’s get this over with.  I have little desire to spend the entire day in Diagon being glared at.”
Draco’s laughter was filled with mirth and pain.  “Indeed.  So, care to tell me how it’s not that bad again?”
As far as plans go, I’ve been feeling disheartened for several months with the life I’m leading now.  I’m no longer the angst-ridden teenager trying to run from his problems.  I talked to the band and it’s one of the main reasons we decided to add on a small tour here.  I wanted to see what it felt like coming back home and if I felt ready for that.  It’s safe to say, there’s nothing that could keep me away from getting to know Caelum and being here for him.
As Draco sat there lost in his thoughts he didn’t notice Hermione’s gaze settle on him.  She had been trying to figure out how to approach him all day and ask him what he knew about Smoke, but she couldn’t come up with a plausible way to bring it up in conversation.  All things considered it didn’t really matter that much since he had someone by his side all day long.  The topic was entirely too sensitive to let too many ears hear it and she didn’t want to spook him if they were interrupted as it’d take even longer to get him alone again.
They found themselves in front of the school with only minutes to spare before the bell rang.  Harry informed Caelum’s teacher of the possible change in pick up people and wished his son a good day.  There was nothing left to do but make his way to the Leaky and begin a talk with the blond he had never managed to forget.
After Seamus made his toast to the group and drifted off to dance, Harry had made his way to the bar.  He had just ordered a drink when Pansy sat down on the stool next to where he was leaning.  He began to glare at her before laughing out loud at her ridiculous attempt at a pout.  “Merlin’s tits Pansy, you might at least try to look remorseful.  These damn things are so tight I can’t even sit down properly! If I get a hard-on the front page of the paper tomorrow isn’t going to be about Neville’s speech, but give intimate details of my cock!”
“So, today’s Prophet says Draco Malfoy is back in town this week.  His band apparently is extremely popular, and they are on a world tour.  Doing a few shows in London.”
Ron nodded and said “I doubt I’ll ever see the method to your madness on this, but I know you and you won’t give up on it.  I’ll help if you need me.”  Sirius agreed and the conversation moved on.
Draco had held on to his temper but his nerves were thin.  He knew it wouldn’t be long before he lost it but he just managed not to snap back a reply to Pansy.  “No.  If we were meant to know before the feast, we would have been informed.  Let’s just pop into Malkin’s and get out of here.  You can join me at the manor for lunch.”  With that Draco pushed through the crowds and made his way into Madam Malkin’s.  They were both measured without much fuss and requested the robes be delivered by owl instead of waiting on them then began walking back to the apparition point to return to Malfoy Manor.
Please make good use of your free periods to study and complete homework.  If you are caught up on both, might I recommend asking your professors if there is a younger year that could use a tutor or other assistance.  Today is Wednesday and while the rest of the students will start classes tomorrow morning you all will not start classes until Monday.  This is to give you each time to get to know each other and settle in.  You will be spending the majority of your time with each other so use this time to iron out the rough spots.”
As he walked along the abandoned halls of his childhood home he wondered if it all had been worth it.  Had he walked away from his only chance at happiness and love simply because he was afraid of what others would think?  Why was there still some emptiness and yearning in his heart if he had accomplished what he had set out to do?  Did it even matter?  Surely Harry had found someone by now who loved him as he deserved to be loved.  There was no reason to get maudlin over the past simply because he was back in the same area as the man.
“I can’t decide if I like you or not but at least you aren’t boring.  One drink.  I’ll buy you one drink only.  I saw how much you put away last night and I don’t know that my wallet can handle your tab and mine tonight.”  Harry waved the bartender down and ordered Pansy a drink and another round for him as well.
year Defense class will be held in a different classroom than it is currently taught due to scheduling difficulties so I will have you meet your Professor in the Great Hall after breakfast on the first Thursday morning of your classes.
Draco wasn’t fairing as well across the hallway.  Unlike Harry, he didn’t have a Hermione to anticipate his agony this morning and had forgotten to grab a potion on his way up last night.  Nevertheless, he was feeling pretty good all things considered.  He gingerly rolled out of bed and dug in his trunk for one of his own pain relief potions.  As he swallowed it he reflected on everything that had been revealed at the feast and after last night.  To say he felt relief was an understatement.  He had no doubt someone would attempt to curse him sooner rather than later, but after hearing about the ward and the sincerity in McGonagall’s voice as she spoke he was confident it wouldn’t be tolerated.
“Darling, don’t be that way. Blaise just stopped by to talk to you as I called Nippy to summon you so he decided to wait here for you instead of tracking you down in the manor.” Narcissa beamed back at him. Draco highly doubted this as all Blaise had to do was call for an elf and ask where Draco was but he decided he’d not explicitly call his mother out over it.
“So….you have how many houses and you choose to live in this dump?” Ron wondered.  Unfortunately for him Sirius had apparated back just in time to hear his insult.  He smacked the back of Ron’s head and began handing out the takeout he’d brought in for them all.  “HEY! You know what I mean, Padfoot.”
Harry was flummoxed.  Dumbledore made Harry his heir?  But why?  Surely there was someone else.  What about Aberforth?  They were never close to hear Aberforth talk but they were at least family.  Harry began to feel extremely uneasy and guilty.  “I’m sorry, I had no idea. Scrimgeour came to see Ron, Hermione, and myself and gave us each one small thing saying that was what he’d left us.  I was unaware he left me anything more.  I’m not sure what to say.”
Harry did not even care if she picked out a purple tutu at this point.  He had tried to convince the group to leave for the past hour and his pleas were falling on deaf ears.  “Done.  Grab it and I’ll meet you at the register.”   He wasn’t giving her time to realize he wasn’t trying it on in the store since a resizing charm would take care of any issues on that front.  He saw the shoulders slump of Draco and Blaise and pushed down the guilt he felt for bringing the shopping to an end.  They could always come back another time.  He made his way towards the front of the store where Hermione was talking to Theo.  “Hey, we’re about to head back towards the castle I believe.  Did you guys get everything you need?”
birthday.  Compared to other’s transitions mine was relatively painless.  It started with a pounding headache that woke me and from there to what I’d compare to a muggle flu.  I lingered in that misery for just over 2 hours and then felt as if fire was racing through my veins.  Thankfully, this didn’t last as long as the flu symptoms, but did last much longer than I liked.  After the fire came full body seizing.  How I managed to stay awake during it all is something I’ve yet to figure out but thankfully after about 15 minutes it all stopped.  I then passed out and had the most vivid dreams I’ve ever had that were filled with someone’s face and body. The next thing I knew I was awake with a raging hard-on knowing I had just dreamt of my mate.  I cursed my traitorous cock and drug myself to take a cold shower before heading to the library to see what the fuck was going on.  I then discovered that, while rare, it is possible for creature blood to bring on a small inheritance to strong wizards in the bloodline no matter how far back the creature was in the family.  Wouldn’t you know it that I’m lucky enough to qualify as a strong wizard so here we are.”
“As you also no doubt noticed there is a kitchen to the rear of the room.  You are all welcome to make use of this at any time but please be courteous to others with its use.  I understand that a few of you are superb cooks and I personally know one of you is a most accomplished baker.” She winked at Harry.  He spent much of his time at Grimmauld baking to keep his mind off things.  Her personal favorite was his lemon bars and she hoped he made a batch soon.  “You are welcome to eat here as much as you would like and can request food from the house elves as well.  I do ask that at least a few of you attend dinner with us in the Great Hall through the week as that is when any announcements will be made and report them back to your classmates if so.  The fireplace behind me is set up with a partial connection to the floo network.  You can floo out but not in and it cannot accept or make fire calls.  Your curfew is 11PM.  You are all adults and therefore can come and go from the grounds as you please.  If you will return late and risk missing your curfew I urge you to seek a room in Hogsmeade as breaking rules with as much freedom as you’ve all been given will require strict punishments.  Alcohol is allowed to be consumed within this dormitory only.  You are not to be found wondering the halls hungover or participating in drunken activities.  Stock up on hangover potions and practice your sobering charms, ladies and gentlemen.”
Draco looked up when he heard the sound and found himself gazing into eyes he never thought he’d see again.  The years had only made Harry more attractive.  The look of a gangly teenager was replaced by a man with just the right amount of muscle and a fierce look in his eyes that showed a vast amount of inner strength.  “Harry, I don’t even know where to begin.”  He sighed and bowed his head before saying “I have no idea what to say.  I doubt, however, you want to have this conversation here so where to?”
“I’m an acquired taste I’ll admit, but I know what I’m talking about.  So, what do you say we get to know each other?  Tell me something no one else knows about you and I’ll do the same.  Anything at all, large or small.  Fuck it, I’ll even go first.  My favorite color happens to be Gryffindor red.  I’ve got everyone convinced it’s actually cornflower blue.”
There was a small pop and a house elf was standing before him. “Master Draco, Mistress Narcissa requests you join her in the conservatory.”
Relationship.  Ha, bloody, ha.  As if what they had could be called a relationship.  Harry had approached Draco on the train ride back to Hogwarts for what was termed their eighth year.  They both mutually agreed to bury the hatchet and simply get through the year.  After the feast they discovered that since there were so few returning students from their year, they’d all be placed in visiting professor’s quarters and only have one roommate.  Wouldn’t you know it that the two of them were roomed together?
“Thank you, Nippy. Please tell her I will be there shortly.” Draco wondered how long it would take for his mother to bring up her desire for him to return to Hogwarts this time. She had been after him at least once a day since McGonagall announced the castle would reopen as normal in September and welcome back all students just as they always had. Draco walked towards the conservatory stopping off along the way in his potions lab to check on a particularly troublesome potion he was working on.
Draco sighed. It was a very tempting offer. He was feeling a bit stifled after nearly 3 months without leaving the grounds. He did miss a few of his friends and it would be interesting to see how his reentry into the group would go. Plus, if it did all go tits up he had his mother’s word she’d stop the incessant pleading. “Very well. I’ll go to Pansy’s party. I will hold you to your promise though, Mother.”
Hermione knew Harry had described the way his class selection would go exactly as he said it would and refused to be too offended.  After all this time they each other as well as they knew themselves.  “Ok, fine.  I concede that you have summarized our likely conversation, but I do think you should take more classes than I know you are going to pick.  As long as that is on record we can move on.  Where are you wanting to go shopping?  Muggle or wizarding clothing?”
“Next, you surely have taken notice of some of the features of your new living area but I will point out a few things you haven’t seen yet.  Above us in the loft area accessed by these stairwells,” she pointed to the areas Hermione had noticed earlier “along the longer walls, you will find 10 bedrooms, 5 along each side. Each bedroom can comfortably sleep up to 4 students and has a small toilet attached to it.  The loft area wraps around and along the shorter halls you will find one end features a bathroom.  There is a tub that is a bit larger than the one in the previous prefect’s bathroom as well as 10 shower stalls. As for room assignments, you can make those choices yourselves.  Co-ed is acceptable as I’m not under the illusion that keeping rooms to the same gender cuts down on any sexual activity.” She stared pointedly at Seamus who was basically sitting in Dean’s lap by this point.  There was quiet laughter as Seamus blushed but he refused to move.
“Maybe, I’m not sure.  If not, we can always head over this weekend.” With breakfast finished he sent his son upstairs to get dressed.  While Caelum brushed his teeth, Harry hopped in the shower quickly to wash off the stench of a night of too much alcohol and regret.
Harry shot her a grin and said “Sorry Professor, I’d say I’ll try to prevent it in the future, but I don’t like lying to you.”
“I hid because that’s all I’ve ever known.  I cared about you, but I had no reason to believe you wanted anything more out of our situation that what we had.  Maybe if I had thought there was a chance at a relationship I would have been more open, but I doubt it.  I was still too self-destructive.  I would have lashed out at you, so that I felt able to walk away and destroy myself.
Draco let out a sigh of relief.  He was terrified Harry would have changed his mind after hearing all that he’d revealed today.  “Perfect.  Should I bring anything for dinner?”
A soft cry came from the floor above him and he smiled. Teddy was awake. He stood to go get the infant when he heard Sirius shuffling his feet overhead. “I’ll get him changed if you’ll start breakfast and put on the kettle.” Sirius barked down the stairs. He’d never really been a morning person and having a wailing alarm clock that went off every few hours had been an adjustment for them both. Harry shouted his agreement back and set off to see what they had for breakfast.
He put his quill down and rubbed his eyes.  Focus.  He couldn’t control other’s opinions or actions.  He didn’t even know how he’d be received for trying for a Potions Mastery at this point.  Graduation was a long way off and there was no need to borrow troubles.  He picked back up his quill and began writing his class list again.  He was taking everything offered except Care of Magical Creatures.  Even with a new professor he had no desire to start that class back up again.  With that decided he made his way towards the showers to start his day.
“Draco, that’s a huge accomplishment.  Congratulations.  I knew you were skilled in potions, but to be honest I never realized just how skilled.”  Until Slughorn took over as Potions professor Hermione had always been beaten by Draco in that class.  She assumed it was nothing more than house discrimination by Snape, but the fact of the matter was there was no way she ever could see herself coming close to what Draco had started to attain in his 6
They all explored for the next hour or so with Harry calling Dolly back once to inquire about how many bedrooms his new home offered before dismissing her again.  He had no idea when he would ever fill all 15 bedrooms but it might be fun to try.  Maybe he should plan to host Christmas this year.  It was definitely something to think about.  As they departed Harry gave one last longing look at his new home and felt a warmth like he’d never felt before knowing he would be returning soon.  For now, it was time to start unraveling Dumbledore’s last web.
Draco looked over at Harry and saw the tears streaming down his face.  “I never knew.  How – no, why did you hide how hurt you still were before you left?  How didn’t your overdose make news?  God, Draco, why did you do that to yourself?”
“I like it better than bearing my soul via Veritaserum Truth or Dare.  Let’s do it.” Millicent agreed.
The day went as Harry thought it would.   Fred, Caelum, and Harry had lunch at the Leaky, Molly agreed to watch Caelum, Harry helped Fred close up the shop, and Harry picked up his son from the Burrow covered in dirt, flour, and some substance he was afraid to examine too closely.
Harry understood what McGonagall was saying, but didn’t see how it applied or mattered to him.  “Okay, what kind of favor are you needing me to do?”
What about house common rooms and year common rooms?  There are dozens upon dozens of unused classrooms.  Let each year decorate their room as they wish.  It stays theirs until graduation and then is cleaned back to its default before the next incoming first years come in to claim it as their own. No one is forced to join in, but as more do, the desire to see what everyone is talking about will win out so that most will at least check it out.”
With that the image flickered out.  Harry sat so still he appeared to be in a full body bind.  His mind though, was racing.  Another mission?  Ashes?  Smoke?  What the hell was the old man talking about?  Obviously, Dumbledore knew the Ministry would meddle but did he have to continue to speak in riddles?  How much did Dumbledore leave him?  He had no need of money as his parents had already made him one of the richest wizards alive.  Harry wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.  Well, he was looking for something to give him a drive and meaning just a few short hours ago.  The saying about being careful what you wish for was never truer.
“Draco,” Hermione said between sobs, “you are an amazing person to even attempt to try this.  I’d be honored to help.”  She peeled herself off of him and began to compose herself.  “Tell us what you’ve worked out so far and where you’ve hit a snag.”
Draco was not sure who was more surprised at his easy acceptance. His mother called for tea service and the three of them talked for the next hour before Blaise left after telling Draco he’d owl him with all the details of the party later. He nodded his acceptance and kissed his mother’s cheek as he left the room. He had a potion to check on.
Pansy liked this side of Harry.  She’d always seen him as too straight laced and uptight.  Maybe there was more hope to the hopeless situation than she knew.  She glanced over and made eye contact with Draco.  He was not a fan of this conversation in the least.  Most of the others wouldn’t notice his tightly clenched jaw or angry glare. “Potter, good to know I’m not alone in my wicked ways.”  She took a shot and decided a change of topic would be the best route to go before Draco gave himself away.  Hopefully the next selection would be harmless.  “Millie, why don’t you pick next?”
“Well, I’m not saying it’d be easy, but I refuse to let you not even try.  There has to be a reason the two of you were always circling each other and why he spoke up for you at your trial.  Rumor has it he’s returning next week too so we’ve at least got until June to see what we’re working with and give it a shot.  What’s the worst that could happen?”
“I’m glad to hear it.  I have a lot of faith in all of my students but fear the changes I’d like to see happen during my time as Headmistress will be out of reach without your year showing the others there can be a different way.”
Sorry for the delay.  I hit a snag on where I wanted the story to go and where the story was taking me.  By the time I worked out that snafu I discovered my charger cord was missing and my laptop was dead.  Amazon Prime to the rescue!  Hope you like this chapter and I'll have at least one or two more uploaded in the next few days.  Thank you for the kind comments and kudos!  It helps to know I'm not completely screwing up on this first attempt at fanfiction.
He also spent time working with the goblins at Gringotts on how to disperse some of the money and properties Dumbledore had left behind.  He set up vaults for Hermione, the Weasley’s, Luna, Neville, and Teddy and deposited 25,000 galleons in each of those.  The other members of Dumbledore’s Army all received 5,000 galleons each.  For the members who had lost their lives along the way a memorial was being erected depicting them and listing their accomplishments.  Harry donated 50,000 to Hogwarts for rebuilding and remodeling that was needed after all of the destruction.  St. Mungo’s received 50,000 to go towards a ward for werewolves to be named the Remus Lupin Ward.  He donated another 50,000 to start a werewolf outreach program that required collaboration between the Ministry and St. Mungo’s.  Greyback had turned many innocent witches and wizards during the last few months of the war and there was a huge struggle to help them all.  After visiting the small cottage near Hogwarts Harry discovered it wasn’t quite small at all.  It was a rather spacious 2 story home with a huge yard.  He hired a wizarding architecture firm to renovate it into a small primary day school and named it Deerfield.  With a lot of help from Professor McGonagall he had found a Headmistress and quickly was able to set up a fund for her to use as she needed to hire teachers and for scholarships for students in need.
“A roadie named Benji had come into my dressing room because I was late to the stage and found me mid seizure.  I didn’t know it at the time, but he was a wizard as well.  He knew who I was and apparated us to the closest magical hospital.  I was dead for several minutes according to the healers and the paperwork.  Benji demanded they continue to try to revive me and thanks to his stubbornness I’m here today.”
It was a somber crowd that now gathered among the couches at The Dragon’s Lair.  Seamus was never one to dwell on depressing thoughts when it was much easier, even if not healthy, to drown them with alcohol.  “Okay you wankers, we aren’t letting those arseholes ruin the night completely.  Let’s all raise a toast to Neville Longbottom!  Beheader of man eating snakes, leader of the rebellion, defender of us all, and the man with the biggest bollocks I’ve ever seen.”
“Death Eater scum shouldn’t be allowed back in the school.  You’d better watch your back, Malfoy.”  Draco rolled his eyes at the passing Ravenclaw.  Expected or not you’d think they could at least come up with decent insults and threats.
“Call me Harry.  I suggest if we are going to all live, attend classes, and eat together, we might as well be on a first name basis.  Plus, I kind of hate Zabini, but I wouldn’t mind getting to know Blaise.”  Harry was sincere in his offer.  He knew the hostility would continue if they all stubbornly stuck to spitting last names at each other.  “And you’d have to get either the Firewhiskey or the Veritaserum in me before I admit my actual fetishes.” Harry smirked.
Pansy held Draco tighter than she ever had and began to calm.  “Well, if we are done being mushy then let’s get down to business.  Who is your mate?  How does this really affect you?  Do your parents know?  Do you have wings?  Oh Draco, please tell me you have wings.  I demand to see them.  Strip right this instant and show them to me.” She smiled lecherously at him and batted her eyelashes.
The four of them stood in front of a house unlike they’d ever seen.  The exterior was a light cream stone that gleamed in the sunlight.  Upon closer inspection it appeared to be marble.  There were palm trees decorated thought the grounds as well as more tropical looking plants that Harry had no idea what to call.  It looked to have at least 3 levels but it wasn’t as overwhelming as a manor would be.  Harry spotted a beautiful pool to the side of the house that he walked towards.  The beginning of it that was on the side of the house was shaped more like a river, winding and shallow.  It would be perfect for Teddy to wade around in.  The pool continued to snake its way towards the back of the house where it went wide into a freeform but rounded shape that was much deeper.  There was seating for at least 50 scattered around with several structures built in to offer shade.
“As for the properties, I’m not sure.  I’d like to go to Phoenix Perch today and see what we find there.  I want to check out the house near Hogwarts and the cabin in Wales, but I don’t think I want to keep either.  I could either sale them and add the money to what I plan to disperse or gift them as well.  I don’t think I’ll know until I see them and see what kind of condition they are in.”
Ten minutes later found most of them back downstairs lounging on the couch and bean bags.  Justin, Ernie, and Stephen decided to stay in their room and the Patil twins decided to get some sleep and join the next time.  The Gryffindors (and Hannah) all changed into pajamas while the Slytherins remained in the clothes they had worn upstairs to begin with.
year students popping into their compartment to insult and sneer at them but they found it easy to brush off since it wasn’t unexpected.  Draco hadn’t agreed with Pansy’s plan to “bag a Potter” but that hadn’t stopped her wild planning either.  He had no intentions of going along with her.  Harry deserved more than what Draco had to offer and as far as he was aware Harry was still with Ginny Weasely.  Pansy pushed to tell Blaise and while Draco didn’t disagree there hadn’t yet been an opportunity to do so.  Perhaps after they were settled this evening in a corner of the common room behind heavy privacy spells.
“Nah, you will be more than enough.” Harry winked at Draco teasingly.  “You can help Caelum and I bake cookies before everyone heads over.  Did you want me to apparate you down to the gate or anywhere?  I’m going to head out to meet Ron.”
Harry cycled through so many emotions over the next few seconds he couldn’t catalog them all if he tried.  He made his best attempt at nonchalant and said “Is that so? Well, good for him.  Where were you wanting to eat for lunch?  Should we grab anything for George while we are out?”  He knew his attempt to change the conversation wouldn’t fool Fred, but he needed more time to process the fact that Draco was back in town.  It would no doubt require multiple breakdowns and several bottles of Firewhiskey.
Hermione threw back another of her shots and laughed.  “Oh, if you only knew how many times I’ve found Harry wrapped around someone on Prefect rounds.  We’ve all caught him at some point or heard him complain about me giving him a detention after catching him after curfew on his lustful expeditions.”
Tonight?  That bastard.  Draco was angry at subterfuge Blaise had employed with this invitation. No, he didn’t have plans but did Blaise think he would back out if he was given too much time to think about it?  The thought was unfair but maybe not entirely untrue.   Between that and the cloying endearments his anger at the situation was close to boiling.
Harry sat up suddenly in bed.  He smiled.  Godric, he had missed that bossy voice.  How had he gone so long without it?
Blaise laughed and admitted defeat, “Ok, you caught me. We’ve teamed up to try to show you how refusing to go back to Hogwarts is a terrible idea. You can’t plan on wasting your days away in this place. You’ll never know how the public is going to treat you if you don’t leave. Potter spoke for you and your mother and essentially pardoned all your actions. If the Chosen One is on your side do you really think you’re going to be lynched in the streets?”
In the end though, it was Ron who put us onto the right track.  I’ve never seen him so uncomfortable or cringed so much when he asked about our sex life.  Hermione was upstairs digging through the library after dinner as she normally did, and Ron and I were outside relaxing.
The incoming first years were sorted and the feast began.  She looked over the tables and her heart ached at the empty spaces that had in the past held students that were lost in battles and raids along the way. The house system was broken in her view.  She saw the need for it and didn’t want to abolish it by any means, but there needed to be something to break up the exclusion that each house had to the other.  She was hopeful that her plans with the 8
Hermione and Ron were in with me when I had him.  It was evident as soon as Poppy handed him to me whose he was.  Your hair is quite distinctive.”  Harry looked up and shared a smile with Draco.
“You had a lot thrown at you yesterday, Harry.  I’ve no doubt you would have thought of it yourself as soon as you calmed down from the surprise on your own.”  Hermione stated believingly.  “What are your ideas to do with what he left you?”
Back at the kitchen table in Grimmauld the box sat in front of them.  It was both benign and menacing at the same time.  Harry could open it and find Dumbledore had left him a letter explaining exactly what he meant but didn’t feel able to say with the chance of Ministry interference.  Or it could be another wild goose chase looking for unknown objects with no clue where to begin. Could he simply push the box in the back of his closet and pretend it never existed?  How important could this really be?  And most importantly, why did Dumbledore seem to think Harry was the one that needed to deal with it?
“Morning Hermione, what are you up to?” Hermione looked up and smiled at Neville as he sat across from her on the couch.
“Yes, Draco, we discussed this less than an hour ago.  Clothes here don’t have to be custom made unless you want to spend the extra money for a personal tailor.  Mass production keeps costs low.  Remember?”  Hermione grumbled.  She muttered under her breath something about how she was beginning to doubt the house of the snakes held any intelligence.  She wasn’t sure how a quick shopping trip to grab Harry a few outfits had turned into such a huge excursion.  She thought she’d be the one dragging him into more than one store, so he at least had a variety of styles and options.  Instead, the Slytherins had fallen in love with simple muggle clothing stores.  So far, they had been to 4 different stores and were currently in a huge shopping mall in London.
All of this filled him with a sense of accomplishment but he felt his crowning moment was the day he signed the paperwork to begin turning Eagle’s Nest into The Severus Snape Orphanage.  So many children were left behind in this war just like he was in the first one.  He wanted to make sure there was a place for them to go that was safe and where they could grow up if not knowing their parents, at least knowing love.  The renovations on it were going to take at least another month but the goblins had helped by putting him in touch with a highly recommended law firm that set up the board and began making everything legal.  He donated 1,000,000 towards the start of this venture as well as a 50,000 annuity.
Pansy sat and soaked in all that had and hadn’t been said with Harry’s comments while his eyes scanned the crowd sipping at his drink.  She knew he had grown up with his Muggle relatives, but assumed he had met wizards before going to Hogwarts.  How did he have no knowledge of houses, Quidditch, or his parent’s murder? There was more to the story than what he was saying but she could wait and learn. “Well, ok then.  Shit, now I’m trying to imagine your years as a Slytherin.  Although, you might be right in the potion ingredients, because Professor Snape always did have a grudge with you.  I admit, I was quite impressed with your naming your orphanage after him.”
Anyway, I guess I’m getting ahead of myself.  At this point, I know the potion would need to be administered before the spell, but until I finish it, I’m not sure how long before or how many doses would be needed.”  He grabbed his notes on ingredients and past failures and the three spent the rest of the day locked in his room discussing theory and interactions.
Harry felt his brain and his heart both might explode with all this information.  He knew today was going to be full of possible heartache and revelations, but he never would have pictured Draco’s life going as it had.  And while he assumed he’d want a place in Caelum’s life, he didn’t allow himself to think that Draco would also want a place in his.  There was so much to process and work through and Harry still hadn’t really told Draco anything about Caelum.  He settled in and began to speak.
With that, I will leave you. As with classes you are not required to join us for meals in the Great Hall until Monday, although you are welcome to do so if you wish.  I bid you good night and point your attention to the box on the kitchen counter.  I think you’ll find the contents interesting.”  With that she turned and left the room.  It had been a long day and she was ready for a glass or two of scotch before turning in for the night.
“I’m still doing the same thing today that I was doing last night when you came by. Working on streamlining and simplifying potions. But if you are that interested in my work that if I recall correctly you called boring and needless last night, I would be happy to send you updates every hour by house elf or owl.”
“Thank you.  Um…well,” He cleared his throat and continued after gathering his thoughts, “a lot of my research so far is pure conjecture since I do not have access to any medical records or previous tests so, please, feel free to disagree with me and offer you opinions.  From my research into what continual use of the curse would do to the neurological pathways I’ve determined that the framework is still there, just extremely damaged and dismissed as impossible to fix by all.  It could be, but I think it’s highly probable to repair with a combined effort of spell work and potion.
All thought left his mind when he saw Harry begin to descend the stairs.  There was not a word that could describe the way he looked with any degree of fairness.   Perfection seemed too bland.  Draco wanted nothing more than to rip the clothes from him and bury himself deep in his mate’s body.  He heard the inhaled breaths and whispers around him and remembered he wasn’t the only one seeing Harry right now.  For the first time since coming into his inheritance he felt himself start to lose control.   He began to snarl deep in his throat and started to crouch down to pounce and protect his mate from the view of others.  Someone touched his arm and he turned to growl and his eyes locked with Hermione.  That was enough to pull him out of the haze he had fallen into.  He took a deep breath to calm himself before turning away.  He made his way over to where he noticed Pansy smirking in the corner.
Pansy knew this was going to be good.  She had placed herself with her back towards Potter’s room with a view of everyone’s faces but mainly Draco’s.  She couldn’t wait to see just how he held himself together.  He’d always been a bit obsessed with Potter through the years so this whole mate business just made things more interesting.  As the room went silent she knew Potter had come into view.  “I’m positive you look stunning so get your ass down here, so we can get going.”
Harry then asked the question he had been wondering ever since he had the conversation with Ron all those years ago. “Draco, did you know this was possible?  I wouldn’t say I was angry when I found out, but the way Ron talked, it was common knowledge in pureblood homes.”
No one failed to notice how much meaning and emotion was behind such a simple sentence.  Harry had lived at a few different places yet he had never had a place he could completely call his own home.  He couldn’t recall the first year of his life at Godric’s Hollow and the Dursley’s was never even close to a home.  Hogwarts was the first place he felt he could call but it was never his.  So many others felt the same towards it.  Phoenix Perch he could call his own.  His cheeks had begun to hurt from smiling when he started back around the front to make his way inside.
Minerva chuckled to herself.  She hadn’t seen this group so quiet ever before.  “You are welcome, and even encouraged, to return to your house common rooms if you wish to visit.  You do not need to wear the uniform though, just the plain black school robes that you should have purchased.  As long as it isn't inappropriate you can wear your own casual clothing beneath your robe.  The password for 8
“Anyway, it was decided that they’d move in to both keep an eye on me and kick me in the arse when needed.  For a month things seemed to be going better, I was eating a bit better and we’d venture out somewhere at least once a week and life seemed to be getting back on track.  But I couldn’t shake the tiredness and had begun to put on weight unexpectedly.  I’d randomly be so exhausted I’d fall asleep at the table almost in the middle of dinner.  Hermione, being Hermione, was determined to figure out what was wrong as I had refused to go to Mungo’s.  She researched curses, depression, muggle illnesses, magical illnesses, you name it and I can almost guarantee you that she looked into it.
By the time they graduated they had discussed the possibility of coming out and trying to make it work, but the public still hated Draco and felt he should be in prison with his father.  After many fights and sleepless nights, Draco made the decision to leave the wizarding world all together.  He never told Harry how he felt about him or asked Harry how he felt.  It would hurt too much to acknowledge it and walk away.
“Ok.  I don’t see why not.  I will have plenty of time and I did enjoy teaching the D.A.  It’d be nice to see how that translates in a classroom environment with homework, detentions, and surly students who don’t want to be there.  I have all of Friday free, would it work to take them starting next Friday?  It’d give me time to figure out what I’m doing.”
Finally, Professor McGonagall entered and began to speak.  “I have quite a bit to say so why doesn’t everyone take a seat?”  She waved her hand towards the couch and conjured herself a chair by the fire.  “I think the rumor I heard the most was that you were all to be resorted and split up.  As you can see, that isn’t true.  We felt as adults you all deserved a little more leeway than most students and felt this dorm would assist in that.  You will always be a member of your house and should pride yourselves in that but you will no longer earn or lose points for them.  You are a no longer just a Slytherin or Hufflepuff.  You are an adult and I urge you all to work together in helping me break down the walls that currently are holding all the houses apart.  Mr. Nott, when you look at Mr. Cornfoot now you simply see him as a Ravenclaw that you have shared a few classes with.  It is my hope that before long you forget the house lines and simply see him as a classmate.  Maybe someone you can study potions with or play a game of chess with.  If the school can see the 18 of you walking to classes together, laughing, talking, and letting the past remain in the past it will help us all.  You each bring something to the table someone else can learn and benefit from and vice versa you all have something to learn from everyone.”  She looked around the room and saw her message appeared to be sinking in.  It wasn’t going to be quick, but she was sure that this group of young men and women would make her proud before the school year was out.  “Now, on to the rules and class information.  Most of you were here last year so some of the knowledge is already there.  The exception to this is your Defense Against the Dark Arts class returns to replace Dark Arts.  With that in mind classes for you all are going to run quite differently.  I must first ask if any of you are wishing to attend Muggle Studies?” she inquired.  Everyone shook their heads so she carried on, “Great, you are all welcome to sit the N.E.W.T. for it if you wish but that does make scheduling much easier.  I recommend you all get a parchment and quill and copy down this schedule as it might apply to you.   Keep in mind most are giving up their free time to squeeze these lessons with your year in so please be polite and respectful by showing up on time.”  With that she waved her wand and a chart appeared in on the wall next to her with the list of classes.
Without even stepping inside Harry knew this relaxing slice of paradise was exactly where he wanted to be.  He turned to tell the others and noticed they were just as entranced as he was.  He smiled and cleared his throat.  “I have no idea what the inside looks like but I don’t find I care very much.  This is my home.”
“He was a very complicated and secretive man.  I don’t think many people ever really knew who he was and I can relate to that even if it is for different reasons.  He was a complete dick both in public and private to me and many others.  However, he is one of the reasons I’m still alive today so ignoring that feels untrue. Most importantly is how absolutely furious he’s going to be about it.  I can’t wait until his portrait is finally hung in McGonagall’s office so I can tell that version of him.  I’m sure he’s watching over us all and fuming now as it is.”
As the wind blew through the stands Harry couldn’t help but feel everything was falling into place almost perfectly.  It had been a long time since things had lined up so well and he couldn’t help but fear that things were almost too easy.  “Draco, are you sure?  I don’t want you to give your life up only for you to regret it and be resentful years down the road.  If you want to continue with the band, it will be difficult, but not impossible.  With all the technology out there now and portkeys, we can figure something out.”
Harry spent the morning finalizing his class schedule and while he knew Hermione would be upset with him only taking 4 classes, he knew it was the right choice.  There was nothing saying he couldn’t sit the N.E.W.T.s for classes he did not attend and he planned on pointing that out to her when brought it up.  Not that he intended to do so, but he knew it’d at least get her to drop it.
“That’s an excellent idea and I can’t say why we’ve not done it before.  You are correct in saying there is plenty of room.  I do worry that the first few weeks might have a few verbal altercations while everyone gets used to each other, but I do love the idea.”
“Keep in mind that Smoke may not want to be found and may make themselves that much harder to find.” Hermione pointed out.  She had a suspicion who Smoke could be but wasn’t going to say anything to the others.  Harry was too obsessive and would approach him without thinking it through.  Ron would blow up and refuse to help because he didn’t do it to help anyone but himself as he is a worthless prat.  She wasn’t sure what Sirius’s reaction would be.  The man owed his life to Smoke but there was a lot of history there too.  She thought it best to simply quietly investigate herself and let the others know when she had enough proof to rule him out or prove his identity.
Harry did want privacy that the Leaky was unable to provide but didn’t want to invite Draco into his and Caelum’s home just yet.  His normal solution to avoid the gossiping public was to head to a muggle area but with Draco’s fame that was out as well.  He’d prefer a neutral site so mentally crossed out the Manor before deciding on a location.  “Let’s head to the apparition area and I’ll side along you if you don’t mind?”
Ron sat in front of Harry with his mouth gaping open.   He appeared to be more shocked than Harry had been the previous day.   Hermione just had the intense look of concentration on her face she got when she was studying for exams.  Harry just hoped after laying it all on the line for the both of them maybe they could help him figure out what to do.
The crowd’s reaction was mixed to say the least.  Some were in tears and some were angry at the insinuations the Longbottom heir was making.  No one noticed the junior reporter for the Prophet in the back making their way towards The Leaky Cauldron’s floo to hopefully get the Gryffindor’s speech into the morning’s edition of the paper.
“What?!  Twenty galleons?!  That’s all?  Seriously, what’s the catch?” Draco cried.  The Slytherins were in awe of the vast amount of selections the store held as well as how cheap the products were.  While Harry and Hermione were amused with their disbelief at the first two stores they stopped in, the two were now at the point of merely rolling their eyes and moving on to the next rack of clothes.
“If they do does that mean I get to go back to Grandma’s today too?” Caelum loved spending the day with his Grandma because she let him bake all kinds of fun experiments and told him he was the best kitchen helper in years.
The night continued on.  They all took turns dancing and singing along to awful songs, drank too much, laughed too loudly, and reminisced on all the stupid and silly things they had done before.  At last call the group gathered their belongings and decided they’d gather again the weekend before the train for Hogwarts left.  Draco was pleasantly looking forward to it as he stumbled to the floo to make his way home.
He heard a pecking at the window and noticed the owl with a package attached to its leg.  He walked over to let the owl in and wondered who would have sent him something.  “Hello.  Aren’t you a beauty?  I’m sorry I don’t have any owl treats on me, but if you make your way to the owlery you’re welcome to rest and grab a bite to eat.”  He removed the package and noticed the handwriting on it.  Harry?  Why would Harry send him anything?  He placed the package on the table in front of him and settled into a chair to read the letter.
While the two of them were talking the others had made their way downstairs.  “Shopping?  What kind of shopping are we talking?”  Pansy asked.
Theo was hooked.  He had no idea what or who Draco could be referring to but knowing what he had already accomplished he knew that Draco had the ability to achieve the impossible.  He would offer any assistance he could without knowing anything more simply to acquire the knowledge.   Hermione was also excited about learning more from Draco’s experiments but couldn’t fail to notice the determination in his eyes as he spoke of this potion.  She couldn’t wait to find out what he was working on and who it could benefit.
Hermione’s eyes widened.  She was quite surprised with what Draco was asking.  A Wizard’s Oath was a step below an Unbreakable Vow.  It wouldn’t kill you, but if you broke it you would lose your magic and many witches and wizards then fell very ill and some would die not long after.  It was a big risk and was very rarely taken.  “I will agree depending on your wording.  I have no intention of sharing what I’ve learned but I can understand wanting caution.”
With a sigh he climbed out of bed and gathered his things for a shower.  He figured he could take advantage of the freedoms they had been given and finally get a few decent sets of clothes.  Hermione would probably join him, but he’d also invite the others along if they wanted to go.  Maybe they could make a day of it and have dinner out at a nice restaurant to relax as well.  Couldn’t hurt to ask at least.  He made his way to the shower with a smile on his face and a spring in his step.
On the opposite side and across from Harry’s room was Draco’s room.  Next was Blaise’s room, then Theo, then there was the girl’s room, finishing out with the boy’s room.
“I was thinking ‘I, Draco Malfoy, request a Wizard’s Oath from Hermione Granger and Theodore Nott that they not reveal any personal information learned in this room today with anyone other than the three of us until a time that is agreed upon by all three parties involved.’ As I said, some information I’m pretty sure you are aware of Hermione so if you couldn’t talk about it if it came up then that would be peculiar.  If you already know what I reveal then magic will understand that and not enforce the penalty.  I do hope that one day this potion works and then the Oath can be released, but until then….”  Here he trailed off and wondered if he might have gone too far.
Anyway, there’s so much to tell you about him and I could go on about him for days.  The letters are just the tip of the iceberg of how amazing our son is.  He’s fiercely loyal to his loved ones. He craves learning anything and everything he can.  He comes up with the most insane plots and doesn’t think twice about following through with them.  He can manipulate a situation to suit his desires so well that you don’t even realize he’s done so until the conversation is over.  I don’t think that the hat will know what to do with him.  He’s extraordinary.
The edges of Harry’s lips began a small curve upwards.  He threw up a powerful Notice-Me-Not charm and several privacy wards to prevent anyone who happened to venture out during classes from seeing or hearing them.  “Hogwarts likes me.”  He shrugged and took a seat.  After noticing Draco’s glare from his avoidance, he continued, “Caelum got really sick when he was 2 and no one answered the floo in the infirmary or Minerva’s office.  I have never taken him to St. Mungo’s because I don’t trust someone not to leak information to the Prophet for a pocket full of galleons.  I knew Poppy was my only option, so I grabbed him and intended to apparate to the gates and head in but was surprised to find myself standing in the middle of the infirmary instead.  After making sure Caelum was alright Minerva checked the wards and found an exception for me weaved in by Hogwarts.  It can’t be overridden or removed by the Headmistress or anyone else who has tried.  It’s all a bunch of conjecture but the best we can figure is that Hogwarts felt I protected it and allows me privileges and freedoms because of that.”
“Last I time I checked, yes.  How have you been Theo?” Draco inquired.  He had just begun to realize how out of touch he had gotten with his friends not only since the end of the war, but since his 16
Umbridge.  Fuck no.  The ministry was changing and had good people in place now but there was no way he’d take the chance of another ministry flunky in his school if he could prevent it.  “How can I help, Professor?”
Sirius was thrilled Harry had finally started to make choices.  “Sounds great, Harry.  I’m proud of you.” He stood and hugged Harry tight.  “I’m going to pop over and pick up Teddy from Andromeda’s.  She mentioned dinner earlier so I might not be back for a while.”  He said his goodbyes to Hermione and Ron and went to the floo.  He was so proud of the man Harry was becoming and so grateful that he had the chance to see it.  Prongs, Lilyflower, and Moony would be too he knew.  He still felt the loss of his closest friends deep in his soul and knew he always would.  He’d do the best he could to honor them by helping their cubs and guiding their way.
Harry was certain being trampled by a herd of hippogriffs would feel better than he currently did. He cracked his eyes open to the nightstand next to his bed and saw, like always, Hermione thought of everything.  He reached for and downed the hangover potion as quickly as his body allowed and then laid in bed letting it soothe away the worst of his symptoms.
Harry nearly startled at seeing Draco’s smile aimed at him.  He couldn’t remember single time he’d seen Malfoy smile at anyone without lacing it with mockery and scorn.  Maybe that was the point?  Malfoy was an arsehole but Draco seemed as if he could be decent if given the chance. “I recommend we go upstairs and pick out rooms, change into something more comfortable, then come back down here and play a drinking game or two, Draco.” Harry smiled back at him. “It’s not like any of us have to get up early in the morning.”
“It didn’t take long to discover Ron was right.  Shocked the hell out of me and her both.  It took another month before I agreed I needed to at least find someone to help with delivery and such.  From there we let in Poppy and Minerva.  Eventually, I told the Weasleys I was pregnant, but Ron and Hermione were the only ones for a long time who knew you were the other Father.
“I’m positive.  Before your owl came last night, I was walking through the manor and realized I hadn’t been happy with the life I was leading for quite a while.  I was complacent and bored.  I don’t know exactly what I set out to prove to myself when I left, but I can’t help but feel that it either doesn’t matter or I’ve done it now.  There’s no longer a drive to stay away from Britain and all things magical.  Knowing of Caelum and the possibility to have a relationship again with you one day?  No way could I walk away from that.”  Draco smiled looking at Harry’s gorgeous face.  “Besides, the boy needs his Dragon Daddy full time as much as his Dragon Daddy needs him.”
Last night was still surprising to him.  He had never had a problem with other houses exactly.  It was more that he had a problem with certain people in houses.  If someone had told him when he was in his 6
“Thank you, Theo.” Draco then turned to gauge Hermione’s reaction to his news and saw the tears streaking down her face.  Before he knew what had happened he had a head of hair in his face and arms wrapped tightly around him.
As he made his way in the back entrance to the shop he was surprised to find the area empty.  He made his way through the curtain that separated the front of the store from the back of the store and saw Fred at the register.  “Harry!  I’m so glad you’re here today.  George is sick and will be out of it for the rest of the day.  Can you either take over for me here or start restocking some of the products?”  Harry quickly agreed and made his way to the back to grab the boxes of their most popular items.
Theo was flabbergasted.  Draco knew what this could mean and what was at stake with it but he agreed that the wording of it could make or break his agreement of assistance.  “I agree with Hermione.  How are you going to word the Oath?”
birthday when his world changed.  It was a sobering realization that he’d have to ponder on later.  He sat and let the conversation with Theo flow.  The two had once been extremely close and had experimented together a time or two before Theo began to develop feelings that Draco did not return.  To keep it from getting messy and ruining a great friendship the two ceased their actions.  The two of them didn’t meet until Hogwarts but quickly became close.  Both shared a love of learning and could spend hours discussing magical theory and history.  Sliding back into that comforting friendship was like a balm to Draco’s soul he didn’t realize he needed.  No matter how badly the night went he wouldn’t regret coming out simply for this alone.
“I’d need loads of help but, I guess I could try.  Maybe the 8th years could work together to figure out the events and how it would work?  We don’t have enough to compete so it could be our legacy if you will.”
Before he even realized he was getting lost in his thoughts he had made it to Gringotts.  The glamour wouldn’t fool the goblins, but would keep the curious wizards and witches inside from catching on at least.  He made his way to the nearest goblin and made his request to go over his inheritances.  He was led into a small room off to the side of the main entrance and introduced to Ragnok who apparently was the manager of the Potter vaults.
“Brilliant!” Harry rejoiced.  “How did I miss that? What would I do without you, Hermione?” He felt a drive like he hadn’t in a while to figure out what the hidden meaning behind Dumbledore’s words were.
shot, “Bisexual.  No, he was angry because I ‘let a snake defile me’ or some such bullshit.  I don’t think he’ll ever see past house lines.”  He sighed and continued “Little did he know I brought that snake up to the dorm a time or two under my cloak right under his nose.”
“Back in my muggle school they had what they called Field Day.  Individually and as teams we would have to work together for a goal in competitive events.  Families would come and watch their loved one’s race around to see who could run the fastest and jump the highest.  Give it a month or two for friendships to form with other houses.  Announce before we leave for Yule there will be our own Hogwarts Field Day in April or May.  Teams must consist of more than one house.  We will have to change the events obviously, but it’d make people work together if they want to win.  Maybe we could charge a small fee for tickets so we could have a cash prize for first, second, and third place over all events?  I don’t know…. it’d need some more work and fleshing out but it’d be easy enough to put together.”
Kind of lost inspiration for this fic.  It’s a rather open ending but I’m ok with where it ends.  I have a vague idea to come back and turn it to a series in a while.
Draco knew this was coming.  He had seen her fidget and begin to start this conversation at least 3 times in the last few times they had seen each other.  He was impressed with her self-restraint but annoyed she knew him too well for him to pass it off.  It’d just waste time and she’d convince him to tell her eventually. But what to tell?  A half-truth would suffice but he was also so tired of keeping these secrets.  If he was going to tell anyone he couldn’t chose a better confidant.  Pansy was a notorious gossip but she saw Draco and Blaise’s secrets as off limits.  He took a few more seconds to compose his thoughts and began his story.  “Did you know that Malfoy’s have Veela blood several generations back?” Pansy’s eyes widened and she shook her head.  “Neither did I until I woke up just after midnight on my 16
You are angry at these Slytherins standing among us for things their family or close friends have done.   How long will it take for that anger to fester into hatred of all Slytherins?  Slytherins are mainly made up of purebloods so if we just get rid of the purebloods we won’t have a problem with those nasty snakes, anymore will we?  Let’s just round them up for the slaughter.  How long?  10 years?  20 years?”
“I appreciate the offer, but I think I’m just going to sit here a while and think.  I can’t wait to see you and Caelum in a couple of hours.”  Draco felt his heart was going to burst with all the joy he was feeling.  Harry nodded his acceptance and smiled before disappearing in front of Draco’s eyes.  As Draco sat in the stands processing everything he had learned in less than 24 hours he couldn’t help but wonder what his son would think of him.  With a grin he stood and made his way to the gates.  He was meeting his son in less than 3 hours.  He couldn’t show up empty handed so he was off to Harrods.  He had to find the perfect gift for his dragon loving little boy.
Theo blushed as he rose to offer his hand to Hermione.  “He’s a liar.  I am a superb dancer.  I can’t help it if no one else can understand my moves.” He joked with her as they walked away and shot Draco a grateful glance.  “Don’t get too tipsy, Malfoy.  I’m too intrigued by whatever your brain has cooked up to let you sleep in too late tomorrow.”
Draco was at a loss for words.  He looked at the bottom of the box and saw the book Harry mentioned in the first letter.  As he opened it he saw glimpses into his son’s life.  So many pictures filled the pages.  Some from the day he was born, some from birthday parties and holidays.  As the pages turned and he watched his son grow up in pictures before him.  Closer to the back there were additions of artwork and anecdotes from day to day life written among the pages.  This was his son.  He had missed out on so much and he was so angry at himself for the choices that had lead him away from the child.  He started sobbing and screaming out his anger at the universe.  After he had worn himself out and ran out of tears he realized that there was nothing to say to make it better or erase the past but there was the possibility to have a future together.
Draco looked upon the tear streaked face and felt shame so deep and heavy he thought he might fall.  “I find this acceptable I suppose.” Draco groaned.  He wrapped his arms around her tightly, kissed her temple, and whispered in her ear how much he had also missed her.
“I refuse to allow you to remain locked away in that stuffy manor any longer.  You will join Blaise or I at least once a week, in public, doing whatever we deem appropriate.  That is your present to me.  I will accept no less.” Pansy demanded as she dried her eyes.
Ron felt a little guilty for being happy he had the chance to start Auror training without Harry.  There was no doubt that Harry was one of his best friends but if Harry joined with him Ron feared he’d always just be seen as Harry’s sidekick instead of someone who offered something of worth as well.  “Makes sense, mate.  I see your point and will do what I can to help from here.  Maybe we can meet up on weekends to brainstorm now and then or just have a pint at the Hog’s Head?”
“Couldn’t hurt. I’m sure it will make things easier on us both and this place could use more than just well-aimed scourgify can fix.”
“Are you ever going to call me Harry?”  He sat down next to her and motioned everyone to gather round.
He thanked Merlin he had thought ahead to convert a large portion of his vault into muggle currency before he left because the first few months were anything but easy.  He had no knowledge of how to live in the Muggle world and no skills to benefit them.  He had almost given up more than once and found himself drinking in a seedy bar in New York when the band that was set to play that night came out and said they had to cancel the show since their lead singer was sick.  Very few people knew that singing was one thing Draco did well.  He had learned a fair amount of muggle songs over the past couple of months and was just drunk enough to offer to step in.
