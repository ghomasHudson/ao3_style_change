and I ask:
who helped me understand where my scene went wrong and why I was stuck and who wrote me lengthy comments about foreshadowing and
Then, the feast was over, and it was the early hours of the morning, and they found they weren’t ready to let go of the other quite yet.
(The thought of it is unbearable.)
Then, the anxiety constricted his lungs and filled his mouth with cotton wool, and there were no words left to say anymore. All Harry could do was shake helplessly in the cold silence of an empty house, with hands clutching his heart and tears streaming down his face.
I dream about you, sometimes. About touching you.
Until then,
I’m sorry I’ve pestered you. You’re my best friend. I really need you, right now.
“Close the door when you leave, will you?”
You’d been lying on the floor of your bedroom again, crushed under the weight of every emotion you’d ever felt in your entire life. There were ants in your bloodstream and your heart was beating like a tribal drum against your ribs, and you were half-convinced you’d have thrown up your liver and lungs if organs worked that way. And you knew how to deal with that, you did. All you needed to do was hold on until it passed, was fight the waves of nausea and choke back the tears. (You couldn’t.)
“We couldn’t figure out which one, though. Couldn’t find any mention of a potion that does anything similar anywhere.”
When you see Malfoy, it is a punch to the gut. He’s sitting at a table, and the low light of the pub is making his hair glow like liquid gold. His eyes shimmer like quicksilver. You remember that you hate him.
You send him another owl. A third. A fourth.
You end up firecalling Lee.
It’s just sex you tell yourself, when Malfoy shows up at your door at two o’clock in the morning, unshaven and wild-eyed.
“Haven’t we been happy, this past week? Haven’t we been good for each other? Draco, we could have this. It could be you and me and a crowd of ghosts in an empty building. We could build things back together slowly: the house, our relationship too. And when all the floors are waxed, when all the walls are white and all the windows clean, we’d realise all our old pain has been painted over by new memories too. We could be happy here, Draco. I could be happy with you. I could make you happy if you let me.”
Harry didn’t have a plan for the refurbishment, but he had money and an obsessive sort of fascination for the large, empty sanatorium. Eventually, the historical building committee decided it was enough, and less than a month later, he was handed the keys to his new home.
“Yes, what, Potter?” Draco’s voice is half-drowned out by the loud blare of the fire alarm charms.
It is an entirely absurd way of harassing your ex, and of course, no one but you would ever [words smudged]
“It didn’t ruin his relationship with me,” Harry answers because what else can he say? Despite her graceful posture and soft voice, there is unbearable pain in Mrs Malfoy’s words. There are admissions of guilt like bruises on her skin. (Regret like broken bones just underneath the surface.) “He could have come back. I would have forgiven him in a heartbeat.”
It was different, in the soft light of October. There was no rage, only a bone-deep sense of loss that filled Harry’s airways with quicksilver and his veins with lead. Then, Draco stepped in front of the casket, the mourning-black a stark contrast to the pallor of his skin, and the world grew still.
“I’d say so. Have you any idea how impolite it is to just disappear after you’ve come, without even offering some release to your partner?”
This is how Harry finds himself in the chapel, hollow-hearted and paint-speckled, almost two weeks after Draco left. It is every bit as beautiful as it was the first time Harry saw it: light is still pouring in and leaving watercolour-puddles on the flagstone floor and the wooden pews are still dust-covered and finger-polished by the years. Harry sits silently as if to pray. Then, he closes his eyes and tries to pull the past week out of his memory like a weed (tries to dig it out of his flesh like a splinter or a bullet, tries to spit it out like a mouthful of gravel or sand.)
Harry stands up. Turns around. His chest is filled with fog, warm and soft. He smiles.
“Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself, Potter. It might have escaped you, but the world does not always revolve around you. You do know that my good friend Pansy works in the Ministry, right? You do know that you are not the only human in the building?”
“I want you inside me,” you finally manage when he’s worked you open and pushed you to the brink of madness and desire. The words punch the air clean out of his lungs and silence curls around you for a second. Then, Draco pushes you on to your hands and knees, whispers soft words of praise into your ear (
I want you. I don’t want to wait anymore.
. The words rang hallowed and solemn like footsteps in a church.
“I’m so sorry I hurt you,” you continue, “I know I’ve kept you at arm’s length because I was afraid, Draco, I was terrified. Of what it meant that I could never stay away from you, that I always sought you out. I tried to tell myself that it was just out of curiosity, but…”
You run away.
He’s good at this kind of ruthless honesty too, the kind that makes my heart ache and my fingers long for his. From our talks, I’ve gathered we weren’t on the same side of the war. I was surprised to realise I wasn’t put off by this realisation. I’d changed so much, since the war, I figured maybe everyone else had too.
things like war and death and having curses fired at you—they sit on your lungs and crush your airways.)
Maybe I would. Want to kiss you, I mean. There’s no way you can know for certain.
Something is seriously wrong. I notice it as soon as I’ve stepped into their living room. The air is tense and electric, Ron standing next to the fireplace with his shoulders hunched and a worried look on his face. Hermione pacing the length of the room with both hands pressed against her temples.
“What are you going to do about it?” Iris asks, cocking her head slightly to the side.
My breath catches in my lungs at his words. Everything, I want to say. Everything you want. I would do it all. I would give you everything I have. More than that even, if you let me.
I drink the potion.
“You’re not dead, Draco.” Harry crouches down and grabs Draco’s shoulder. The linen shirt is soft under his finger and the flesh is firm underneath, and that’s when he remembers that it is warm and soft, remembers that it smells like leaves and smoke and fog.
, Pansy Parkinson. The hero of the Wizarding World was seen nursing a glass of wine, wearing a frown. Not even best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, managed to bring a smile to the face of the heartbroken saviour as he watched the love of his life marry someone else. Witches wishing to mend that heroic heart will have to find the man first: since he dropped out of Auror training, our Harry has been virtually invisible and his London residence has been empty. Where has the lovelorn lad been running away to? We wish we knew!
(You didn't deserve it, and he came back to you.)
As always, many thanks to
When the journalist shows up, you’re tired and depressed and the side of your neck has turned an upsetting shade of purple. You’re ready to go home, roll yourself into bed and have a good cry about everything. You’re doing a pretty good job of ignoring him and his pointless pleading for an interview, until he opens his mouth and says:
“And yet, nothing shows up on the diagnostics.” He sounds tired, defeated. I realise he was hoping to find something too. I realise he was hoping he might see his friend again.
“What do you mean, you bought a house?” Draco asks, his eyes like sea glass (unknowable and smooth. Unbearably gorgeous too.)
When they finally kiss, it’s slow and tentative at first, like a peace treaty after an endless war or the first signs of spring after a long winter. Harry cups Draco’s face in his hands, and Draco runs his fingers through Harry’s hair. When they finally break apart, they stare at each other, wet-eyed and unmoving, their faces all painted in awe and disbelief and a fragile sort of hope.
As always, all my gratitude goes to
“You still could. Hold onto me. Draco, Draco look at me. I still miss you. I’ve spent the past five years going from country to country, never settling down anyway, restless and ever-moving, just to forget I still missed you like a broken tooth or a severed limb.”
Hawthorne’s Apothecary ends up being a tiny shop in Horizont Alley. It looks respectable enough, from the outside. Although it doesn’t have any windows, the grey-green wood door has been left slightly ajar; it boasts a small wooden sign upon which the name of the shop is written in the same curly script I had noticed on the receipt Pansy gave me. I sneak a glance at the inside of the shop through the glass panelling of the door: it seems empty. Before I can second-guess coming here at all, I push the door and walk in.
“How can you ever have thought that, Harry?” Draco’s face is cracked open by a bright kind of pain, and Harry finds that he can’t remember how to breathe. “I loved you so much. I loved you more than life itself. It wouldn’t have hurt so much if I hadn’t loved you with everything I had.”
Harry doesn’t know why he opened the message this particular owl brought. There were many owls, tapping at every window and sitting on the roof and all over the street outside his door too. He did his best to ignore them.
I’d take your finger into my mouth. Suck it gently until your breath turns uneven and your skin turns hot.
spell, you idiot.
If you were to ask him what he feels for Draco Malfoy, he’d tell you he hasn’t thought about him since the end of the war. It’d be a lie, of course, but this is what he would tell you anyway.
There are no words inside Harry’s mouth, then. They’ve all been replaced by desire as violent as a tidal wave and as destructive as a forest fire. He pulls at Draco’s jumper and fumbles with his belt. Draco throws his head back and whispers Harry’s name like a binding spell.
Piss off, Draco. You know full well I’m on a date with Lavender tonight. If Pansy put you up to this, she will pay. If this is about Potter,
There’s Draco’s naked skin on his, Draco’s soft-hard erection against his belly, Draco’s warm-solid thigh against his groin, and this—this is when Harry knows it’s really happening. They’re going to make love there, on the forest floor, and how can he ever survive this? How can he ever remember how to be alive again now that he’s a lightning storm, now that he’s forest fire and a tidal wave and an avalanche?
“Hello,” Harry says, feeling oddly out of place in his own house. Like he’s interrupting a reunion between two old friends.
(Because this is the thing about words: they make things real. And you’ve been thinking about what happened in indefinite articles and vague terms since yesterday, you’ve been carefully avoiding naming it, defining it, describing it, for fear that you might make it unforgettable. And still, it is all you can think about.)
officially opens as a structure for troubled youth less than three months after that.
The words go clean through your chest. He can’t talk about this, not here, not now. Not ever.
“What other choice did they have?” As the words left Harry’s mouth, he knew with unbearable certainty the topic would lead to another screaming match. It always did. “It’s not like they wanted me to get hurt or killed, it was just a choice between me and the rest of the world, really. My life wasn’t worth everyone else’s.”
I step through the Floo immediately, only too happy at the prospect of delaying the inevitable moment I will need to fall asleep,  coffee cup left sitting cold and forgotten on the kitchen table.
“It called to me,” he answers as Draco ponders over the results of his diagnostic spell, hanging in the air in glittering gold lines. “I saw it and I knew I had to save it, no matter how much it costs or how much work it would be, you know?”
She rummages through her small handbag (smooth charcoal leather,  posh and expensive) until she finds a torn piece of paper that she sets on the desk and pushes towards me.
Iris pauses, her finger pressing hard and painful against Harry’s sternum for a second before her hand turns intangible again, going straight through Harry’s chest like fog. She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose as she continues:
“I’m not going to tell you not to do it, but—is he worth it, Harry? Is he the one who’s going to make you happy? Is he worth everything you’re going to have to go through if we do this interview?”
And then, he does.
“I want you inside me,” he says, his quicksilver eyes burning with a beautiful sort of passion. “I want to feel you, I want to be yours. Oh for tonight, just for tonight, I want to be yours.”
To the discord channel who knows this chapter under the delightful title of "ghost porn": thank you for making me laugh and giving me motivation to do this.
Okay. Yes. Well, first, you need to know that if you’re a woman, I’m probably not going to be interested in you, so I’m assuming you’re male. Am I right?
is all he can think. And:
Left thigh:
Pansy! Would you believe who came into my garden today under the pretence of degnoming my lawn???
There was something different about Draco in those moments where they were both naked and panting, something open and vulnerable that went straight through Harry’s heart. There was something in the way he let Harry pull him apart slowly, with his fingers and tongue and cock, the way he moaned Harry’s name as Harry plunged deep into the tight heat of him. It drove Harry entirely mad with desire. Entirely mad with an abominable kind of love too (the kind of love that filled the entire room or flooded the entire city. The kind of love that might have been infinite, had Harry let it.)
Almost instantly, I feel the skin on the inside of my right elbow tingle.
he doesn’t say.)
“Auror Potter.” She takes a sharp breath in. “I have known I was a lesbian ever since I was thirteen and kissed Millicent on a dare. I have never as much as liked a man for a single second in my entire life. Yet, today, I woke up in the middle of my engagement party to Miles Bletchley.” She says the name like she’s spitting out a slug. For an instant, I think she’s going to start crying. She doesn’t. (She presses her lips tightly together instead.)
you wordlessly tell him with every whimper and every moan. You watch him come, and it’s the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen.

“And I hate it,” she continues, ignoring me entirely. “I hate it. I hate the message whoever did this decided to write on my skin. I hate the fact that it’s written on my skin. I hate the fact that they’re making me carry this on my body.”
We make small talk as he works. I learn he doesn’t have any children although he would want some in the future and that he dedicates all his free time to this shop until he can find a suitable girl to marry and settle down. I hum a vague sort of agreement. For all his commitment to his business, I can’t help but feel slightly ill at ease. It’s not something that I can pinpoint exactly, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to settle down, but he’s using turns of phrases that remind me of how people used to talk before the war and it’s apparently enough to make me feel faintly sick. I tell myself that it’s perhaps just that I am not yet at the point in my life where I can imagine a future that isn’t just another version of the present.

“He’ll see you now,” she says and motions for me to follow her. “I didn’t mean to be so curt with you,” she continues as we walk, “but we’ve had bad experiences in the past, not everyone’s keen on having a werewolf clinic down their street. Especially after the war... We like to be careful.”
And this, reader, is why Harry Potter decides that the thing where half the shop explodes and there’s a pissed-off Ministry official taking notes about everything and he has to sign at the bottom of several incomprehensible forms? It’s better than another second not seeing Malfoy, and it’s the only way he can go about it.
“There, go in. He’ll be waiting for you.”
In a lot of ways, it stuck needles through Harry’s lungs and turned heart to dust, but there were also the good bits. There was the way Draco looked at Harry right after they kissed sometimes, with a reverent sort of wonder. The way Draco would trail his fingers along Harry’s chest and whisper in his ear that
Iris’ eyes widen.
And then, every single feeling you’ve ever had comes crashing down on you.
He’s done it, he thinks. The house is his, now. His to love and cherish and restore to its former glory. It’s what he’s always wanted, isn’t it? He should be happy, now. Grateful, at least. Counting his blessings and finding silver linings.
“Please, Harry, I beg you. Don’t make me stay…”
PANSY!
It happens like this:
Draco doesn’t move. Doesn’t say anything. Tears run silently down his cheeks and kiss the corners of his mouth. (Harry’s heart breaks at the sight.)
She shakes her head like a stern, disappointed matron, then laughs before adding: “It’s okay. I’ll translate.”
“Thank you, for helping out. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without you, and you really didn’t have to help, considering how things ended between us. I’m glad you agreed to help, though. I’m glad we’re doing this together.”
Draco leaned against the wall, pinching the bridge of his nose with his fingers.
I gasp for air like a drowning man as I wake, clutching my sheet with both hands. Before I can register the dampness in my cheeks and the hoarseness in my throat, there is a loud sound in a corner of the room. I turn my head. Nott has just dropped his tray of supplies to the floor and is staring at me in shock.
“Haft en bra dag, eller?” the man at the welcome desk asks in a booming voice as Harry walks past him to go out for dinner that night. “Himla synd att det har regnat så mycket på sista tiden, vädret brukar vara mycket bättre så här års. Men jag hoppas att du har haft några sköna dagar i alla fall?”
[left blank]
Harry raises his hand not holding Draco’s and gently runs his fingers down Draco’s cheek. Draco’s breath hitches softy.
“What happened?” I ask because there’s no sense in asking if they’re alright when it’s so clear they’re not.
The ghosts move away from Harry as Draco starts the intricate incantation. The glittering gold patterns that shoot from his wand climb like ivy on every wall, gorgeous and mesmerising. Harry casts his half of the spell too, then: cool blue light washing over him and diving deep inside his flesh to pool in his magical core.
Iris swoops delightedly, then stills in mid-air, stretching her stocking-clad legs out before her and crossing her legs at the ankle. She’s wearing peep-toe shoes with chunky heels.
you let your eyes confess.
PANSY! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!
He doesn’t answer.
They’re in each other’s arms. How did this happen? It doesn’t matter. Draco’s skin is fire-soft; Draco’s hair is ember-bright. The fog in Harry’s chest turns to woodsmoke as Draco trails a warm tongue on the side of his jaw.
Harry would whisper into Draco’s ear with fingers digging bruises in the soft flesh of his hips.
The weather is dreadful, the rain falling in thin but cold and unrelenting sheets. Still, in a desperate effort to forget that he loved Draco once, in a desperate effort to cleanse his skin of nostalgia for a past that sticks to it like glitter, Harry decides to go and work on the garden. It’s a ridiculous idea, but Draco’s already locked himself in the piano room and so he doesn’t tell Harry as much. (He doesn’t tell Harry that he’s impulsive and ridiculous and always doing the wrong thing either, though Harry knows he would if he knew.)
The same is true for you. I can assure you we definitely know each other. I’ve known for a while, since you’ve told me your age. I'm twenty-six too. We were in school together. Please… Just… Please. Give me a chance too.
He steps away. You tighten your fist until your fingernails dig into your palms. You think only of the pain in your hand and not of that in his eyes. You’re not gay, you remind yourself, and you need to be clear with him if this is going to work out. Establish boundaries. That’s what people do, isn’t it?
“Look, Potter. I’m not going to coddle you, here. You’ve hurt him. You’ve been hurting him for months, and I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve begged him to just walk away from you. You’re very distraught now that he’s gone, of course, but how do I know you’re not going to go straight back to hurting him the minute he comes back?”
“There wasn’t any other choice because they never bothered to look for one!” Draco roared.
“I want to, Harry. I really do. But—I don’t think I can.” Draco’s face is tear-stained and fractured by a deafening sort of pain. “I’m still the same person I always was. You’re still the same person, too. People don’t change, not that much, and the thing that broke us apart in the end? It was so much bigger than either of us. It was the weight of the war and the wounds on our souls and the darkness that will always live at the bottom of our chests. We both know it’s never going to work between us.”
Tears rush unbidden from your eyes when you feel his pleasure-stroke fingers inside you.
Today. Before we can both overthink it. Muggle London?
Draco rubs his neck, naked and glorious amongst the satin sheets. And how can you not be in love when he’s this beautiful?
“It’s you,” Harry whispered into Draco’s skin when they eventually broke apart.
“What would you say your headaches are like, usually? Stabbing? Pounding?” He searches through the shelves on the wall until he finds a book and thumbs the pages as he waits for my answer.
I love you.
I’d take your cock in my hand while you stroked me. I’d learn the hardness of it, the softness of it, too. I’d commit it all to memory. And as I come, I’d tell you that I love you. That I’ve loved you for a while. That I don’t think I've ever loved anyone as much as I love you.
It’s not okay.
“So you’re telling me that if I promise the ghosts they can stay and if the house believes me,” Harry answers slowly, “it’ll let me bond with it?”
“So he left.”
The trees are tall here, their crowns reaching into the blue-grey fog, their branches all weighed down with humidity and vines. The floor under Harry’s feet is moss-soft. Leaf-crisp. It is autumn and everything has turned into taxidermy fireworks of reds and golds.
When you finally remember the syllables that make up his name, he Disapparates.
You’re sat on the floor of your office late on a Tuesday night after everyone’s already gone home, and you’ve already drunk half a bottle of fire whiskey in a desperate attempt to forget your own name, when you see Malfoy again. You don’t know why he peers through your half-open door. You don’t even ask.
You still can’t figure it out.
On the day the writing first appears, I break down in the loo of a Muggle cafe and cry for an hour, sitting in a dirty stall. I don’t know why it happens, some face on the street looked too much like Fred, I suppose. The couple at the table next to mine made me think of Lupin and Tonks, perhaps. Later, I’ll think about it and realise these things are bound to happen. I’m still grieving, I’ll tell myself. I might never stop grieving. It’s normal. When it happens, though, it feels the furthest thing away from normal. It feels wrong and hopeless and unreal, so I fish a pen out of my pocket. It is black and it feels smooth in my fingers. My mind healer made me carry it with me in case I feel like journaling. I did not tell her that no one outside of books ever felt like journaling. I did not tell her I wasn’t a gothic heroine and I wasn’t paying her to make me sound like one, I was paying her to make my emotions be normal again. So I pocketed the pen and here it is. I take the cap off. Press it to the textured peach wallpaper above the tiles. “I FOUGHT TO LIVE AND NOW I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF,” I write in big, shaky letters.
(Then: sadness washes over his face, and you wish you had told him something. Anything.)
I toy with the idea of finishing that paragraph with: you. I want him to be you. Anything you are. Anything at all. This is what I want, if you’ll have me.
Sometimes, after Draco leaves, you take showers so hot they scald your skin, the burn-red caress of boiling water erasing all the evidence Draco bit your neck and scratched your back. It hurts, the water coming into contact with your skin. You tense your muscles. You don’t move. You let the pain bite into your flesh. And if you cry? No one can tell.
At the words, Harry pulls Draco into a hug and holds him tight, in the glorious sunlight of early afternoon. The air smells like monk’s rhubarb and goosefoot. They do not let go for a very long time.
I visit Hawthorne’s Apothecary the very next day.
You aren't entirely sure how it happens, but you are sure that it happens and it’s all that matters because Draco's mouth is on yours, soft and sweet and impossibly warm. You kiss him, and you kiss him, and you kiss him, and this is it, isn't it? This is what the poets write about, this is what the singers sing about. This is everything humanity has been celebrating since the beginning of time, and it's glorious, and you've only just come to understand why.
“Mrs Malfoy,” he grits out, trying to keep his disappointment in the cage of his teeth.
Harry’s voice echoes in the hallowed space like a gunshot, violent and loud and entirely out of place. Iris’ features harden and she furrows her brow.
He answers almost immediately.
You knock again.
His voice dies out and Harry forgets how to breathe.
They shift until Draco’s laying flat on his back on the bed, and Harry’s positioned between his legs. (Harry’s chest fills with fireworks at the sight of this beautiful man under him, willing and undone, kissed and touched and so entirely loved.) He pushes inside Draco, and it’s—
I realise they probably don’t know.
“I’m a ghost, Sara,” Iris replies, a playful pout on her lips. “It took some creative thinking, making things work between us! What is their excuse? They were both tangible from the start!”
“I know what you’re going through,” he does not say because no one says those things here.
“Goodbye,” Harry whispers as he closes the door behind him.
he remembers. And:
And you never regret it.
You fall asleep eventually.
I squeeze her hand briefly. I feel guilty for making her spell it out for me, guilty that she’s shocked and shaken, yet she still has to do the work of explaining why she’s hurt.
(Because here’s the thing about Malfoy: it hurts like an open fracture or a heart attack that you love him, but you love him. And you need him like you need air, and you’re entirely certain that if you were to leave, your flesh would turn into chalk and you’d crumble down entirely.)
Harry would like to say it was easy, loving Draco Malfoy. He would like to believe that it was one of these love stories that inevitably end because people change and ways part, but that was beautiful and soft and full of light before it was over.
I take a deep breath. No helping it now. I was in school with the man. He was on the other side of the war. I realise I don’t even care who he turns out to be, I realise I love him whoever he is. I take another deep breath. Then, I set out to find our meeting place, striding quickly across room after room of delicate objects and priceless treasures. When I finally find the shield, there is a man in front of it. A slender man with hair a shade of blond I’ve never seen on anyone but…
Harry wants to say. And:
“I… I really need you to say something, Draco.” (A soft, sad plea, whispered by a breaking boy, in a broken voice.)
You owl Draco again. Your owl comes back with the parchment still tied to its leg. Unopened. You owl Pansy, then, out of sheer desperation.
I think of Draco in his potion lab. He would know, I think before I remember that I may never see him again. I clench my fingers around the cool, smooth glass of the beer bottle and I don’t say anything.
“Go get him,” she replies with a wink.
“We’re all glad you promised we could stay, Harry, don’t get me wrong. But it was never about us. It never was about the house either—your magical core was closed off, love. It’s not that you couldn’t bond with the house, it’s that the house couldn’t bond with you.”
where women had come to stay in hopes of curing lung conditions under the watchful eyes of nuns. It was turned into a summer camp after that, which in turn had closed ten years ago; the building had been sitting empty ever since. It broke everyone’s heart, seeing it in that state. It had once been the pride of the entire valley, the most modern sanatorium in the whole country. T
Right shoulder:
“That will do very nicely, Iris. Thank you,” he says softly as he takes out his wand.
Draco does not stop crying.
(You don’t mean for the words to sound bitter as they roll from your tongue but they do.)
Your grandad and I, we didn’t always love each other. We didn’t always like each other, in fact. Don’t hold it against us,
“Oh no,” she adds in a softer voice. “Darling, you’ve got it all wrong.”
You try talking to him, but it’s no use. He can’t hear you over the screaming in his chest. (And you understand, you want to tell him, you do. You understand how it much it hurts to be rejected and betrayed. You know how it feels to burn with shame until you want to disappear.)
If you could think clearly, you’d realise that you’re entirely fucked, because you’ll never love anyone else like you love him. Not with this all-encompassing intensity. Not with this wild fervour. Not with this bottomless trust.
Pansy’s quiet for a little while. She stares at your face with think-serious eyes, like you’ve somehow written hidden answers in the lines around your eyes or the skin of your cheeks. You stare at your knees and the floor and you try not to tell her how certain you are that he’s the one.
“Hey,” he whispers instead.
This is what we’d see if we went inside, but let us not, reader, for the story does not begin in the shop. The story begins in the office on the first floor, with a dark-haired young man looking longingly out the window. The young man’s name is Harry Potter. He does not work here, not really. He’s agreed to help out because his friend Ron, who does work here, is on Paternity leave, but this does not matter to our story. No, what really matters to our story is that Harry Potter, who is currently sitting in an office on the first floor of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes at a desk full of bills and tax forms and paperwork, is desperately in love with one Draco Malfoy, Master Potioneer and owner of “Patrician Potions.”
You don’t mean to turn back into an Auror the minute your boss’ Patronus gallops through the room. You don’t mean to dart up from the bed and start gathering your clothes, but your boss’ voice is frantic and talks of raids gone wrong and hostages, and what else can you do?
It was awful and it hurt, seeing Draco so distraught, fists clenched tight and mouth drawn, but there was a little piece of Harry, there, right there, at the bottom of him, that was glad of it. (At least Draco was looking at him now. At least Draco was talking to him now.)
Her voice light and matter-of-fact as though she were talking of the weather, but there is steel in her spine and, as she opens a small cabinet and takes out an ornate crystal bottle, her fingers clench around the glass so tightly that her knuckles turn white.
There is safety in those words. It’s something you might have said in the courtyard at Hogwarts, or in the Great Hall, or on the quidditch pitch. Something warm and heavy settles behind your ribs, like a brick, or warm milk, or a pulsating swarm of bees.
Fat tears roll down his chin and along the line of his jaw. He does not move. He barely breathes. In his hand, there is Draco’s, still and warm.
“So… Potion?” Ron asks.
“Oh, he loves you.” Pansy says the words like she would spit a cherry stone, hard and quick and like she doesn’t want them in her mouth.
Draco’s eyes grow cold and hard.
The journalist looks surprised for a second, but then, his dicta-quill is taking notes, and you’ve gone and made a statement because of course you have. (Lately, every word that spills from your tongue is something that should stay forever in your mouth.)
And it doesn’t even matter. What matters is that it was real when you kissed me by the frozen lake. What matters is that I took your hand, and I gave you my entire heart and my entire soul, and I fought for you, Draco. I really did. I still would, if only you gave me a second chance.
“I feel like I’m drowning in the pressure of everything,” Harry told him when he didn’t ask. “I can’t even take wallpaper down and my own home hates me—how can I be expected to keep smiling at cameras and lie to everyone that I knew what I was doing in that forest and not actively trying to get myself killed. I know they need me to be their symbol of hope, I know they need me to tell them it wasn’t in vain, the pain and the loss and the grief. But I can’t! I can’t! I don’t even know it myself!”
“A lot of things are fucked up when you’re a woman, Ron.” Hermione’s voice is brittle. “I am frustrated and angry and scared. I am a lot of things right now but you know what? Surprised is not one of them.”
A little over an hour later, I finally find the letter. It’s written on disgustingly pink, disgustingly rose-scented paper and it goes like this:
It’ll hurt, later, the way your broken edges cut into each other’s skins. You never think it won’t, because how could it not? But you offer everything you’re able to give all the same because he’s worth it. And he’ll tell you he loves you, months down the line, when you’re naked and satiated and still so very much in love. You’ll cry at the words. They’ll heal you, too. And in the soft darkness of your bedroom, you’ll listen to Draco’s sleep-rhythmic breaths and you’ll be so happy that you think your bones might break from the intensity of the feeling.
Harry thinks (and he does not ask himself whether he’s referring to the sunset or to the man watching it.)
And he kisses Harry again.
I’m not sure I believe the spell works. I’m not even sure that I believe in the concept of soulmates if I’m honest. But all I thought I knew turned out to be wrong so maybe I should see where it goes. Maybe we should see if perhaps we’re meant to meet now, to… fall in love or help each other be happier. I don’t know. I figure, that if we hate each other, fine, we’d know that stupid spell didn’t work, and then we can share a kiss and be done with it forever, but what if it worked? What if we’re missing out on something beautiful?
It was beautiful, inside, all solid oak floors and high ceilings and large windows that let light flood in. Harry walked slowly through all the rooms, his footsteps the only sound in the rich silence of the place. In one of the rooms, there were several ancient pianos; in another, the original art deco lamp still hung from the ceiling, all gleaming chrome and frosted glass. In the small chapel at the back of the building, the stained glass windows bathed him in vibrant hues of blue and red and gold, and he lay down on the flagstone floor with tears in his eyes and something fragile and precious like crystal inside his throat (tears or words or the feeling of coming home).
And it was all you could think about, that hope. The brightness of it dispelled all the shadows of your doubts and your fears. It filled you entirely with something anxious and restless until you pulled on your travelling cloak and stepped outside. It’s all you could think about, and now, you’re standing on Draco’s doorstep and it suddenly dawns on you, the immensity of everything you’re doing. Everything it means. How terribly badly it could backfire.
“I love you,” Harry tells him, again and again and again with every rhythmic trust of his hip.
Draco smiled.
Then: you scream for ten minutes straight.
“Yeah,” I say because I absolutely don’t, and give his hand a firm shake, “I can’t say I expected to find you here! Is this your shop?”
I take a step towards him and take his hands in mine. His skin is warm and solid under my fingers.
Harry raises his hand and cups Draco’s cheek. Draco’s still and soft under his fingers, shoulders trembling and hands clenched tight together. (The phantom-memory of their pain is heavy and throbbing in the air between them.)
They are standing on a rock surrounded by sea and the hesitant sunlight of dawn, and when the saltwater of their tears falls to the ground, it is embraced by the vastness of the waves like long lost daughters coming home. (
Draco’s voice is breathy and high, shattered by pleasure, by his own incommensurable want, and Harry can feel the desire in his bones. There’s Draco’s hand on his cock, and there’s Draco’s hair in his hands and Draco’s hands on his face, and fireworks erupt inside Harry’s chest as he comes with Draco’s name on his lips.
(I remember everything: the way the air stuck to my lungs like tar, and the way rain fell straight through my skin and pooled inside my chest, and the way the darkness behind my eyes swallowed the sun until the colours bled out of everything.)
who cheered me on, and wrote with me, and picked out all my mistakes.
I find myself, days later, irredeemably lost in some back alley of wizarding London with nothing but a glamour on my face and an address on a bit of parchment.
“I’ve been drugged,” she declares, standing in front of my desk with her arms crossed and her manicured fingers pressed tight on to the baby-blue cashmere of her sweater.
Then: Draco moans, and it all goes to shit.
Harry hesitates for an instant. It was not supposed to go like this, Draco was supposed to be at the door, and Harry was going to tell him that he loved him, and that he couldn’t live without him, and that he was tired of not fighting for the things that mattered. He knows he shouldn’t tell Draco’s mother any of this, not when she’s standing in the doorway like a Greek statue, beautiful and dignified. Not when the truth is messy and painful and shaped like a secret you lock away behind your ribs and never speak of again. But Harry’s come this far, and lies have been eating holes in his chest like worms for years, so he answers:
“I’m glad you’re both here,” Hermione says when we break apart, wiping the wetness away from her cheeks with the sleeve of her jumper. “Now, I need you to help me figure out who did this, so I can make them pay.”
“Mina föräldrar tycker inte om att du äter myror,” he tries again.
(I fail.)
“Mr Potter,” she answers in a voice that sounds like pearls falling on a marble floor. “I’m afraid Draco is not home at the moment. May I inquire as to the object of your visit?”
(But here is the thing about Harry: he’s been careful for longer than he remembers. He’s been building walls and wearing insolence like armour ever since he was old enough to talk. He’s been hiding all his life, and the bone-tiredness of it is unbearably heavy, now. Unbearably lonely, too. And it’s felt the opposite of lonely, this whole disaster of a thing. It felt good, Harry realises, falling in love with a ghost by the seaside. It feels good catching fire under the hands of a dead man in the stillness of an October-rust forest. He’s not entirely certain that he wants to survive it at all.)
Let it go. Move on. I did.
Every word is an ice-cold storm-wave, crashing over Harry’s lighthouse heart until it’s extinguished entirely (black with soot and drenched in salt, crumbling and broken: a ruin.)
“I need you,” he told the emptiness around him.
Jemima Graves clears her throat. She riffles through her forms for good measure.
No, I don’t, but I know who I am. Trust me. You wouldn’t want to kiss me if you knew.
He took Portkeys to anywhere, after that, visiting most of Europe and half of Africa. He walked through the arid heat of deserts and through lush oases. He stood on the edge of the Bering sea and watched the ice crack slowly in the tentative heat of spring, and he stood in the bogs of Denmark thinking about the people who had once died there and who might lie underneath his feet still.
Fortunately for you, you can’t think clearly, because Draco is still fucking himself on your cock, still making sinful noises as he pleasures himself with your body, still moving in all the ways that make you writhe and moan and beg, so all you can think about is that fuck, he feels good, and fuck, he’s gorgeous. You complain about the ropes tying you down. You beg him to make you come. He sucks at your earlobe, and he pins your wrists down with his soft, warm hands, infuriating and wonderful.
The first thought Harry had when he arrived at the dragon sanctuary was that Romania was breathtaking. Everyone was lovely, and looking after dragons was hard physical work, the kind that made Harry’s body tired and heavy at the end of the day, the kind that stilled his thoughts in his head and wrapped all his anxieties in the gauze of exhaustion. Still, it wasn’t enough.
You grasp at the thin air where he was a second ago.
, and there are regrets that I will take to the grave - but this is not the whole reason. You may think of him only as an old man now, but your grandad was breathtakingly gorgeous in the cool, crisp light of April, he really was, with his deep green eyes and his awful hair. I’d have followed the man anywhere.
“I need time,” he says after a while. You kiss his shoulder. “And I need to take it slow. And I don’t want the public to know, at least not now.”
But as August hung the sun high in the hot air of the sky, and as September drenched the cobbled street with rain and wind, Harry found that he couldn’t move on. Draco wrote that couldn’t either.
He turns around and straightens his instruments on the table behind me. I stay silent. I’ve said all there was to say and there are no words left now. When he speaks again, I hear grief in his voice.
“I’d like you to give both,” Harry smiles as he stops in front of the front doors. “But informed consent is important. I want you to agree with my vision for the place.”
He walks up the stairs.
Draco snaps, at those words, kissing you with so much violence there’s the taste of blood on your tongue. You’re incandescent with want. He sees you, he knows who you are. He’ll show you your place, he’ll force you to be everything you are, everything you don’t want others to see in you. He pulls at your dress robes, his caresses leave raised-red streaks on your chest. You moan and whimper under him.
“I’m… I’m not gay.”
Wait. Let us stop here, reader. Can you feel it? This is the moment where everything finally falls into place. Come. Look closely. Look at the way Harry’s eyes widen almost imperceptibly as he realises he’s been in love with Draco for longer than he remembers, look at the way his mouth hangs open and empty of words. And look, reader, look at Draco’s face, too. Look at the soft light of hope behind his eyes, look at his careful armour of distance fissuring like ice shelves in the summer.
I let out an undignified moan at those words. It is ridiculous how much I want it, how much I want
I’m coming through the Floo and you’re telling me everything.
You get thrown out of the bar.
Draco has gone.
“How does it feel, Draco?” you coax him. “How does it feel, fucking the golden boy? How does it feel making him come undone underneath you? Do you like it? Do you?”
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” he concludes after a solid hour. He’s done countless spells, he’s taken my pulse, and my temperature, and a vial of my blood. “Everything is perfectly fine.”
You lie down on the floor. You stare at the ceiling, wondering where your life went so wrong.
He had his reasons for asking me, of course. Do you remember
And this, is the moment Harry chooses to kiss him. Draco immediately forgets the number Harry’s eyelashes or the count of his breaths
“I would bet on it,” Hermione says.
I’m sorry to hear, though I really should have expected you to have some bad memories because of the war. You did tell me you were twenty-six. Same year as the Saviour of the Wizarding World, isn’t it? Did you know him? What did you think of him?
A plump lady dressed in a flowing silk dress and t-strap heels asks what kind of living people Harry is talking about exactly. Her tone is commanding, the question precisely-worded and incisive. Harry thinks she might one day have been a press journalist. He half expects her to take out a quill and start grilling him if he’s honest.
Draco,
“Hush, darling,” she whispered back, her hands warm on his back. “He’ll come around. Give him time.”
(In the hollow cave of your chest, your heart suddenly grows loud.)
Really, it’s not that Harry ever meant to buy a sanatorium, but the mountains were breathtaking in the cool February air, dressed in white like brides or shroud-wrapped bodies, glittering in the late-afternoon sun, tall and silent and austere. And when Harry saw this house, sitting on a hill, nestled against the steep slopes how could he not fall in love? It was a thing of beauty, all sharp art deco lines and large glass conservatories, an impossible shipwreck in the middle of an alpine valley. On the beige facade, red letters read: “Le Rosaire.”
He was wrong.
“You didn’t tell me he would be funny,” she whispers loudly at him before turning back to Harry and clearing her throat.
I pretend I don’t know where I’m going. I pretend that a bit of air will do me good. To tell the truth, all the talk of Malfoy’s funeral affects me more than I expected. That’s saying quite a lot, really, since Malfoy’s death has been hanging over my head for the past two years. It’s not even that we were friends, Malfoy and I, not strictly speaking. We were—friendlier. After the war. We spoke to each other when we met at Ministry functions, swapped a couple of awkward platitudes here and there. He used to work as a potion expert for the Aurors, I’d bring him samples to test every now and then, and I’d wish him a good day. It makes no sense that I’d miss him so much, and I know Ron and Hermione think I’m somehow using his death as a shorthand to talk about all the others—Sirius and my parents, Fred and Remus and Tonks. It’s not entirely wrong, but it’s not entirely right either.
Instead, I busy my mind with work and try to forget that I am increasingly unsure of what I want to do with my life. I don’t always succeed. I try my hand at journaling again.
Later that night, after they’ve gone back to their inn, Draco knocks on Harry’s door. He’s wearing the same soft cashmere sweater but he’s changed into a pair of flannel trousers and there is a certain domestic softness about it that fills the well of Harry’s chest with all sorts of dangerous feelings.
Harry exhales softly, sitting back on his heels and letting his fingers fall to his lap. They sit in silence on the too-cold floor for a while as they try to make sense of the sadness in their chests and of all the pin-cushion words in their throat.
I don’t pause to think about what I write next.
When Draco shifts his hip against you, the heavens split into halves and lightning strikes your chest. Suddenly, your groin is rubbing against Draco’s firm thigh, and everything underneath your skin catches fire in the wake of that feeling. Draco guides your leg between his thigh, and this is when you lose it completely. It feels better than anything ever has, than anything even has the right to. He’s breathing against your neck, hot and heavy and wet. You moan and whimper, and you grab him by the hip, and you go fast, fast, fast, oh faster, like that, like that. You know in your bones you’re going to come hard, you can feel it in your teeth, and you can’t find the strength to care. You’re going to come against a wall in a back alley, against a man you’ve always felt more comfortable hating, and it is everything your life is not.
The interview was a disaster, of course, and the papers are dripping with drivel about you and Nicholas, about your perfect romance and how much you deserve a man who makes you happy. Draco must have read it, you know, and Draco must have believed it, too. He’s broken, when you see him, the way the face of a cliff is broken when sheets of it crash down into the ocean below. It’s a deafening kind of broken.
“Pounding?” I say because I figure I have to say something and that’s as good as anything else, really.
I let the nib of my pen rest again the paper, immobile, for a little while. I want to argue that he deserves love and forgiveness, but I know him well enough by now to know he doesn't take kindly to be told he deserves anything at all. So instead, I write:
“Vous avez la mienne,” says an old woman wearing what appears to be a nightdress and slippers.
Harry walks back to the inn. He crawls into bed and tries to forget he’s awake and breathing and alive.
“Then tell me what you need, Draco,” you whisper against the crook of his neck because you know he’s broken too. Because you know it won’t be easy, being with Draco Malfoy. You know there are fissures running along his bones too, cracks on his heart and bruises on his skin, and you’re going to have to learn how to love him in ways that don’t hurt him.
“I think I’ve figured out what I’m going to do about the house,” Draco tells Harry the next morning. “I’ve been thinking about Wilmine Witbooi’s work on buildings with what she calls a
“The public wants to know about you, Mr Potter, about your life. Such a great hero for the wizarding world, people look up to you, they care about you. They’d love to hear about your new boyfriend.”
“Oh, I can’t understand,” Draco hissed. “No, I wouldn’t understand what it feels like sacrificing myself, would I? But let me tell you something, Harry—you’re never going to get better if you don’t stop putting every single person in the entire world before yourself. You’re never going to stop having nightmares, and you’re never going to stop feeling like you’re made out of guilt, and you’re never going to figure out how to be happy. And I can’t be there to hold your hand through every anxiety attack because you felt like sacrificing yourself—again—for people who couldn’t care less about you. That’s not fair on me, is it? You go play hero for a crowd, then you come back and you expect me to pick up all the pieces of you and somehow be okay with it. Well, I can’t. It’s too much for me, Harry. I can’t always be your crutch. You need to learn to stand on your own.”
What about you? What would your ideal man look like? More importantly, what would he be like?
I am a terrible liar. Aaron adds a crimson powder into his cauldron, carefully stirring it in with slow clockwise motions. I feel the mood in the room shift.
“My father.” Her reply is sharp and stinging like a whip. I write it down too and add a question mark.
You can’t be gay. Fuck. You can’t be gay. Not on top of everything else. Not on top of the nightmares and the trauma, not on top of being singled out and hunted down by the press every time a minute detail in your life changes.
Before I can assure her I understand, she stops in front of a door.
You meet Draco in Diagon alley, and he avoids you.
“Kiss me, you coward,” I whisper against his lips.
I’ve been getting carried away and falling in love, but I don’t get to do those mundane things, do I? Because as soon as he sees me, I’ll be Harry Potter again. I’ll be the hero and the saviour, and he’ll forget all about the anonymous boy leaving chicken scratch words on his skin. I take out my journal, hoping he’ll see my words.
Draco pushes inside, and the entire world melts away until there is only the sensation inside Harry, pulsating and warm and entirely overpowering. Draco stills, his cock entirely sheathed inside Harry, and Harry shuts his eyes, covers them with white-jointed fingers pressing against his eyelids because it’s too much, that feeling. It’s too much for him to bear, too much for his body to contain. Draco pries them away gently.
“Can you talk me through what you remember?” I ask because her story resonates strangely inside my chest; because every single one of her words awakes something behind my ribs, something terrible and ancient that I didn’t even know was there before it started to stir, and I need to know more.
Harry told himself. (At the back of his mind, the clawing creature grew teeth.)
No. No, we don’t. One last question.
When you’ve finally realised he isn’t going to answer you and you’ve gone almost entirely mad with the loss of him, you pick the lock and break into his flat.
“It… Harry… We can’t….” There is no violence in Draco’s words, no conviction (only the utter terror of a man standing on the edge of a different cliff.)
There are tears burning behind Harry’s eyes. He stares at the sun and tries not to cry.
Wait, no, that’s too personal, isn’t it? Let me put it this way: I’m twenty-six. Do we have more than a five year age difference?
That would be enough to make me come. Your voice and your words and your hands on me, stroking and twisting, blinding me with pleasure. I’d tell you I’m in love with you too. That I’ve wanted you for longer than I care to admit. That you can have me, all of me. Everything I am and everything I’ll be.
And sometimes, Harry could hear the confession in the sound of his own name.
Harry smiles.
you let your fingertips whisper against the smoothness of his back.
The words dance around Harry’s ears like angry wasps, maddening and terrifying all at once. This can’t be happening, not now, not when they had finally found each other again. (Not when Draco held him and touched him and kissed him. Not when Draco finally told him he loved him after years of silence. Not now, not now not now.)
“C’est pas qu’on voudrait pas le vendre,” a man in green wellies told Harry, leaning against his tractor, “mais il va falloir des garanties, vous comprenez? C’est une partie de l’histoire du coin, notre Paquebot. Faudrait pas qu’il soit dénaturé, voyez?”
is beautiful in the early morning sun.
“We did it,” he whispers into Harry’s neck as Harry embraces him.
“You want it, don’t you, Potter? You want someone to finally see you for who you are, don’t you? You want someone to show you your place, someone who won’t pretend like you’re perfect. You’re broken, Potter. You’re broken and bruised—tainted goods. But I’ll have you, Potter. I’ll have you.”
Your hand doesn’t hurt anymore. You can’t move your fingers.
At the words, Sara picks Iris up by the waist and twirls her around as peals of laughter echo through the room.
Draco keeps on crying, sobs wracking his slender shoulders. Harry does not know what to do with himself, or about it, or at all, really.
And everything goes to hell.
And maybe you’d even live through the whole ordeal, you think, and there’s a smile living just behind your teeth, and you might even be alright. You might even be alright.
Draco has stopped in the garden and is staring at the house like the world is ending.
Instead of dwelling on it, Harry treads slowly through the meandering street and breathes in lungfuls of iodine and lilac. There is a blocky castle sitting atop a hill, and Harry strolls along its ancient bulwarks, staring at the sea in the distance. He realises he doesn’t have the first idea on how to find Draco, but it’s only noon yet, and how difficult can it be to find someone on an island, after all?
“No, what happened is that some absolute
“No, Ron, that’s not it.” Hermione’s voice is tense. Shrill. I can tell she’s about to break. “It’s not ‘threats’. That’s not even remotely the problem.”
“I love you,” Draco pants against Harry’s mouth. “I’ve always loved you. I’ve never stopped. I wouldn’t know where to start if I tried.”
I could cry at the words. (I smile instead.)
They made it all the way to the edge of the forbidden forest before Draco took his hand. Everything was a blur after that. There were trembling bodies and breaths not breathed; there were hands fisted in soft jumpers and fingers carding through hair and lips—oh, there were lips on lips, and it was unbearable, that sensation. It was pleasure, bright and cutting like a knife, and Harry thought he might die from it. Minutes passed, hours perhaps. Above them, the star-speckled sky shone softly like hope.
“It’s you,” Draco whispered back, and in that moment, Harry could have sworn they wouldn’t ever part.
I am not going to ask how you got into my home. I am also not going to ask why the letter you left is full of teeth marks and smells like gnome.
You go through everything once again, as she taps her foot restlessly on the wooden floor and nods sharply every time you finish a sentence. You’re glad the chat you had with Lee did at least spur you into taking a quick shower and getting dressed in appropriate clothes because when you make it through less than three sentences before your voice turns sob-broken and shaky, she doesn’t offer any comfort. Her dark eyes pin you down, silently appraising how honest your grief is, and you have never felt so small in your entire life.
has stepped in and agreed to beta the rest of this fic. Her input and her kind words of encouragement have been invaluable from the very beginning, and I certainly wouldn't have written as much without her reliable presence in the sprint channel on discord. Thank you for making it all happen.
When he closes the door, Harry falls back onto his bed and closes his eyes, trying to imagine there’s another body here with him. He does not even pretend he doesn’t want it to be Draco.
Iris rolls her eyes and swoops nearer to them.
who wrangled my swearing into proper Englishness and my punctuation into readability.
“Can you hear me, Draco?” Harry asks in a futile attempt at dispelling the memory, his dry-twigs fingers stiff on Draco’s shoulder. “Listen, you’re not dead. You’re not dead.” (On Harry’s tongue, the words taste like grief all the same.)
There is a lake in the forest. Is it deep? It doesn’t matter. It is bottle-green and sunlight kisses it’s calm surface. Harry crouches down, plunges his fingers in the cold, clear waters. The lake licks at his skin like a gentle lover. Harry closes his eyes and exhales.
“Harry, you need to come over. Now. Just drop everything and come over, okay?”
Before Harry can protest, the girl with the pink hair kisses her cheek.
Investigated the parchment. It is full of words. Strongly dislike those. Nibbled the corner. Did not taste as good as fudge. Lost interest and dug up five carrots from the vegetable patch instead. Boring day. Would like another treat.
The anger in her voice sets fire to the terrible, ancient things in my chest. I look down at my quill. I haven’t taken a single note since she started talking about Draco’s funeral. I write
It was from Draco Malfoy.
He could run, Harry could. He could still run, now. He could avoid rejection, avoid confrontation. He could go home to his hotel, to his empty house at the foot of the alps. He could never go home at all, could take a Portkey again, move to the desert and the forest and the arctic ocean and try to lose himself entirely there, try to forget his name and his face and spend an entire life trying not to be alive at all. It wouldn’t be good, but it would be safe, oh it would be safe and it would be familiar, and—Harry would be lying if he said he wasn’t thinking about it at all, because the vulnerability is cracking his chest open like a crayfish, and it is unbearable, it is—
It is not exactly a lie, about not being a Muggle-born. Besides I imagine the second day you’re talking to a boy is a bit too early for a detailed exposé about your abusive family.
“You will explain to me exactly what this is about, Potter,” she demands, all high heels and sharp nails. “And if you even think about hurting Draco more than you already have, so help me, Potter, I will end you.”
You don’t.
“—it’s no use thinking about it, he’s gone now,” Harry bites out. In his words: a barely contained rage at the universe for letting him have the love he’s craved his entire life before taking it away for good, for letting him heal only to tear him apart again.
We need to share a kiss. Don’t get your hopes up. I’m not kissing you.
Blond hair. Definitely. I’ve got a thing for blond men, it’s gotten me in trouble more than once. Elegant. My ideal man needs to have some sort of charm to him, class. He needs to make up for the fact that I have the social manners of an Erumpent and take the focus away from me in public. Quick wit, definitely. He’d have to make me laugh, but most of all, I think he’d have to make me think. He’d have to be able to challenge me when I have my head too far up my arse to make sense, too. I want someone who isn’t afraid of being blunt but who will also always be as kind as he can be. I want someone who’ll put up with all my weird quirks and accept me as I am, for who I am and what I can offer.
Jemima Graves swoops in before Harry can think of a good answer. She needs eyewitness accounts. She’s soaked, and the left side of her head is covered in dark patches of burn-frizzled hair. Both of her shoes make soft sloop-gush sounds as she walks, but still she needs them to fill in form 562-37 A. She also needs a signature, if you please, here, and here, and here.
That evening, Harry has spent hours slowly meandering through picturesque streets and beautiful little shops, has gotten coffee and soaked by two separate rainstorms, and has spent several hours sitting on jagged rocks and staring at the sky while the splash-cold sea lapped at his feet and covered his skin in white-scrub salt. He’s seen people too: families and off-season tourists, shopkeepers and innkeepers and casual sailors stepping off white boats, but no one with starlight hair or quicksilver eyes.
Sometimes, something in Harry’s chest breaks and the world turns silent and grey. It never lasts, not really, and the loud brightness of reality always finds a way to open him up again like a sharp blade in an oyster shell. Still, in every single one of these grey instants, Harry goes back to the
“I’m so sorry I couldn’t tell you how much I loved you,” Draco continues in a broken whisper, “I don’t think I’ve ever loved someone as much as I loved you. I don’t think I ever will again, you know? Some days, I feel like you were my soulmate and I’ve missed my chance at being with you. Some days, I almost can’t live with myself for not having held onto you. But I wasn’t in a good place then, and I couldn’t do things any differently, and I just need to learn how to forgive myself for it.”
He balls his hand into a fist until his fingers hurt, white-crushed at the joints. He bites his lip. He does not say anything.
We need to set some ground rules if we’re going to do this. One: We do this one month. If there’s still nothing after a month, we meet and kiss and never talk about it again. Two: You never try to find out who I am. Three: We do not tell anyone about this.
“It’s what I have to do. You can’t understand. It’s the right thing.”
“I didn’t know you died,” Draco says softly.
“I wouldn’t,” Harry says immediately. “I wouldn’t want to make this place anything it isn’t. I don’t mind a few ghosts. I’d like you to stay.”
Lee doesn’t understand a word of your grief-drunken speech. And you must look entirely insane, in that moment, standing in front of the fireplace in nothing but your boxers and an old, alcohol-stained t-shirt, half-sobbing and half-screaming words he doesn’t have the context for.
“No, Harry. I think I would have been targeted either way because the message about Draco, the one on my arm? That’s the important one.
He promised.
“Draco,” you moan, because you’re entirely incapable of using words anymore. “Draco, oh, Draco.” His name has become a mantra that keeps you safe, that keeps you sane, that keeps your demons at bay, and his fingers on your skin. You taste every syllable of it on your tongue like citrus fruit and brown sugar. You swallow up all the words he spills onto your naked skin, and you beg for more.
Just as I’m about to give up, I realise that whoever is on the other side of this, whoever is writing on my skin—they know what this spell does. They also knew what I wrote to Hermione earlier, and I’m almost certain that whatever I write shows up on their skin.
It’s done.
I squeeze his fingers in my hand and move closer still, our faces almost touching. He smells like vetiver and pine. His eyes are bright and beautiful and grey in the same way that a stormy sky is grey—dangerous and gorgeous and ever-changing.
Two weeks into our discussions I ask him:
“And I don’t think I can make it through another breakup, Harry. Not again, not with you. It hurt me too much the last time. Believe me when I say I barely made it out alive. I can’t do that again, Harry. I just can’t. I’m sorry.”
It is gone.
It was first described by Aethelred the Alarming in his 1124 Manuscript
You knock.
I’ve got dark hair. I've been told have pretty striking eyes too. And you know I work with animals, shovelling manure all day has definitely given me muscles. Dubiously scented muscles, but you never said anything about smelling nice. So I ought not to be too much of a disappointment when we meet.
The first time the exploding extension explodes, it is an accident.
Harry seems a little better after that, and in Draco’s chest, his heart gleams heavy and bright. And it would be enough for Draco because he’s always done these strange things to make the world make sense, and no one’s never noticed. But it’s not enough for Harry, it seems, for he catches Draco unaware and alone in the library and, without a word, sets on the table: a coin. Three crystals. A wilted flower.
I don’t admit it to myself, but I feel unreasonably hurt at the thought he wouldn’t even kiss me to break the spell. It chafes uncomfortably with all my fears of being alone forever, all my doubts about my life.
(An awe-inspiring one, too.)
Draco’s opening the buttons on Harry’s shirt with trembling fingers, and Harry can’t look. He can’t look—he’ll catch fire if he does, he’ll combust and burn with blackened flesh and charred-chalk bones.
And, just like that, there was hope, growing brighter and brighter inside your chest, until you turned into a lighthouse.
(Then, your mouth is on his, and there isn't a shadow of a doubt anymore.)
Draco’s voice is breaking and broken, a landslide of hurt and infinite sadness. He does not look at Harry.
Harry told himself,
“Talk to me,” Harry Potter tells Draco Malfoy in the background.
You freeze.
“Fine. Just this once. For old time’s sake. And never again.”
“Draco,” Harry whispers, but no sound comes out of his mouth. Around him, reality starts to bleed and dissolve, colours blurring into each other like a watercolour kaleidoscope.
It becomes a regular thing, after that. He shows up at your door. You meet up at ministry functions, in shitty hotel rooms (but not in his home, never in his home). You trade barbs, you fuck each other, you never stay the night and you never talk about it. And it’s fine, it is, why wouldn’t it be? It’s just sex, after all. People do it all the time. It doesn’t have to mean anything.
Pansy stumbles into your living room the same afternoon, brandishing your drunk-panic message.
“Please, Draco,” he tries again as he’s led through the ancient corridors. “I know it’s a bad time, I know it was always going to be a bad time, but I’m really just asking you to take a look at this house. Just this. Fix it for me, and you’ll never have to see my face again. Please, Draco. Please.”
The case Robards called you for turns out to be a disaster. It’s a hostage case, and several of your colleagues are in danger, and the adrenaline burns clean through your veins. You get hit with a curse on the side of your neck, and still, you keep fighting. And when it’s finally over, you’re on edge and in pain, and everything around you tastes like war and death. Ron grabs your hand and squeezes.
Draco is crying in earnest now, sobs shaking his thin frame as he buries his face in his hands. Gently, Harry pulls him close and into a hug. Draco doesn’t stop crying, and Harry rubs circles onto his back as a terrible kind of sadness submerges him like a heartbreak-ocean until he is drowning in the undertow.
“Oh, Harry, you’ve been missing for the past forty-eight hours and we were so worried!” Hermione hugs me tighter still and Ron places a comforting hand on her back.
Draco did not come around.
“I thought you didn’t love me,” Harry admits, sitting on the bed and staring at the tarnished pine boards under his feet. “I thought it was what it meant.”
Charming. This morning, my skin was inquiring about my mental health but it appears it’s moved on to judging me now. I toss the parchment aside.
Still, the building is every bit as beautiful as the first time Harry saw it, and Harry can see that it steals Draco’s breath away too, as he walks on the ancient oak floors and lets the sunlight kiss his face through the ancient glass of the large single-pane windows. Draco runs his deft fingers along every wall in silence, closing his eyes to better feel the magic held therein. Harry does not stop watching him.
“You complete and utter madman,” he whispers again, “you have no idea exactly how in love with you I am.”
Draco’s face fissures entirely at the words (an avalanche: cold and bright and deadly.)
“I’m happy you came back, you know,” Draco eventually whispers, “I’m happy you’re here. I’m happy it’s you who shows up here when I can’t bear being alone anymore.” There is a small silence, a sharp inhale. “I know it didn’t work out between us at Hogwarts,” Draco continues, his voice fragile and shaky, “and I don’t think I’ve ever told you that I was sorry about how it ended. It was an awful time, wasn’t it? We were so young and so afraid and in the middle of a war. It was so hard keeping it a secret even when our lives depended on it. But I really am—sorry, I mean. And I’m happy you didn’t choose to  die.”
“It’s magical, Draco, and well... You helped with Grimmauld. It’s your job, isn’t it? Fixing magical houses. It’s what you do. It’s a purely professional request, I assure you. How much do you want for the job? I’ll pay you.”
“I was going to tell him I love him, and I’m afraid I was going to be extremely persistent about it until he agreed to have me.”
Do you think it’s possible to know another person entirely?
“Come on,” Harry tells him as he makes his way into the corridor and up the stairs.
“You think you’re so smart, don’t you, Malfoy?” you spit, and you can feel the tension between you, and you can taste the hate and the violence in the air. (You are entirely drunk on it.)
When Draco finally starts stroking your cock, your vision blurs entirely and you cover your face with your fingers. The sensation of Draco’s fingers tracing colour-bright strokes of pleasure on your skin is almost too much to bear, and you’re entirely sure you’re going to catch fire or turn to liquid. You’re entirely sure you’re going to physically come undone from the feeling, entirely sure your muscles will dissolve, entirely sure your bones will turn to chalk or dust.
That night, after I fall asleep, I dream of him. I’m holding him in my arms and he’s whispering his name into my hair and, though I can't quite make it out, I am filled with the bone-shattering certainty that I have never felt this happy in my entire life.
“I think so. I really do. We’ll see tomorrow, won’t we?”
He moves, then, just a little. Harry whimpers and grabs Draco’s wrists, kisses the palms of his hands and sucks his fingers. He moves again, and again, and again. The motions slow and gentle but unrelenting like a rising tide or a setting sun.
When I finish writing, my eyes grow heavy. I don’t even read my words again. I feel satisfied that I’ve helped fate along, free now that I’ve opened my heart. Nothing to lose, I tell myself as I slip underneath the covers of my bed, and quickly fall into a dreamless sleep.
(You remember how to hate him because it is what you’ve done your entire life. You remember how to hate him because it’s what you did when the world was still painted entirely in black and white, when it was still easy to know right from wrong, when you were still going to be so bone-shatteringly happy after the war.)
No identifying questions, remember? Also, even if I knew him, I don’t think I’d want to tell you about him. With all that’s been said and written about him, I think it’s high time the boy gets a bit of privacy, don’t you?
(“Oh, Draco, oh love, oh love.”)
Draco doesn’t answer. His eyes are still closed, his entire face tense. He’ll break, you think, if you touch him too roughly. He’ll shatter like glass or turn to dust. And you—you’ve been quiet for so long, and you’ve been careful for so long, and you can’t keep the words on your tongue anymore. Everything you are spills from every pore of your skin, and your words dance around your head in the silence of the room.
(You remember how to watch his every move because he’s gorgeous, he’s gorgeous, he’s gorgeous—he’s luminous and warm, and you can’t tear your eyes away.)
I would anyway. Touch you. I would explore every part of you. Every inch, every fold, every hill and valley. I’d take you into my hand whispering soft words of praise all the while. You’d let me do that, wouldn’t you? I would caress you, taste you, worship you. I would make you come as I stared into your eyes and whispered your name.
“I’ve been thinking about the bonding ritual,” he says as Harry steps aside to let him in.
“I think that will be enough, don’t you?” she asks Draco, who’s leaning against the wall in a corner of the room, face pale and spine stiff. When he smiles, there is sadness behind his eyes.
Harry learns that Draco does indeed come to the island regularly and usually rents a little holiday cottage. He doesn’t come into the town much, but there is a lighthouse on the far side of the island, where everything is flat rocks and seawater as far as the eye can see. He might be there, the man tells Harry. And: go find him.
once looked. It might be a while, they said, until the plans were formally approved, but the renovation was respectful of the soul and the structure of the building, so they were confident approval would ultimately be delivered. Still, Harry felt oddly out of place in this bright meeting room in the historical city centre of Fribourg, where there was a river snaking between the grey-stone houses and high cliffs towering above him, but not a mountain in sight.
“Harry.” Draco’s breath leaves a burn-humid trail on Harry’s collarbones. And Harry—falls apart in Draco’s arms.
And then, Draco’s coming too, and Harry is holding him through his orgasm, and kissing his collarbone, and runs soft hands down his back, and—
Each word is like a blow, straight to your face, and you can feel the copper-salt taste of blood on your teeth. You feel tears, heavy-hot behind your eyes. Shame, too. Of course, Malfoy’s right. Of course. Malfoy sees straight through you, to the darkest parts, the parts you need to keep buried and never think of again. Malfoy knows that he’s struck a nerve with his words: you can tell from the glint in his eyes and from the shape of his scissor-sharp smile. It fills your stomach with liquid-cold fear until nausea wraps its green fingers around your throat and you feel like you’re drowning. You can’t let those parts of you see the light of day again, you can’t. You need to go home to Ginny, you need to take her soft hands in yours, and you need to make her smile, and you need to be happy with this life, with just this life, with this lovely girl and your lovely home. You need to remember it’s everything you ever wanted, it’s everything you survived the war for (and not bone-sharp shoulders, not stubble-rough chins, not comet-blond hair.)
Fuck you. Fuck you for making me feel like I do. Fuck you for making it impossible for me not to love you when you went and rejected me. Rejected me, Harry. Do you have any idea how that feels? I loved you so much. I loved you. I still do. I can’t stop loving you. [words angrily traced.]
Below left nipple:
This is when you realise you’ve just had sex. With another man. And you’ve enjoyed it.
“It’s a beautiful house,” Harry says, the softness of Draco’s magic still clinging to his skin like the scent of soap. “I promise. It’s incredible, and it’s broken, and it deserves to be saved, Draco. It deserved to be saved so much. Please, help me save it. Won’t you help me for old time’s sake if nothing else?”
This time, laugher crinkles the man’s eyes.
So, this Amorae spell. What does it do?
There are nights when you feel everything at once, and your chest is so full of despair and sadness, of shame and anxiety that you think you’ll combust from the intensity of it. There are nights you spend lying on the floor, half convulsing and half crying, and you can’t bear it, you can’t, you can’t. Your blood turns to fire ants, and they’re burrowing into your chest, digging tunnels through your flesh and into your bones and you’d do anything for it to stop, but nothing works, nothing works, nothing works. And you don’t know how to stop being alive, because alive burns all your nerve endings, because alive shatters all your bones. The sounds are entirely too loud and the colours entirely too bright and the air you breathe is made entirely out of steel wool and wasp stings, and you can’t live like this, you can’t.
“I guess I thought that because he didn’t love me, I had the right to hurt him as much as he hurt me,” you finish. You feel defeated and broken and entirely overwhelmed by everything, like reality is suddenly too much for you to take in.
There was much to do, age had run her grey fingers down every wall and over every floor. There was damage from the ravers too: broken windows and empty bottles forgotten in every hidden corner. Graffiti that read “Styx was here” scrawled in royal blue letters across a wall in the stairwell. It was broken and stained, that house, but the bones of her were beautiful. It was worth being saved, Harry decided. (
“I love you,” Draco continues after a while, raising his grey-storm eyes to meet Harry’s. “I love you more than I can say, and I want to stay more than anything. But I can’t. I can’t. I’m so sorry, Harry. I wish I was a better person. A stronger person. Someone who could stand the pain of losing you a second time, or someone reckless enough to take the risk. But you’re the sun, Harry, and I’m forever going to be Icarus—flying too close and burning my wings and falling to my death. I’m sorry, Harry. I’m so, so sorry….”
You’ve forgotten how many owls you’ve sent. You keep sending more.
sits like a stone on his tongue (heavy and cold.) Before he can find a way to form his lips around it, Draco turns around.
(And again.)
There is every emotion on his beautiful face, like time-lapse clouds in front of the sun sweeping patches of shade across the ground.
that he finally felt like he had arrived home.
“You…”
Have you ever been in love?
He looses control then, grabs at Draco with lust-clench hands, moves his hips to meet Draco’s thrusts, faster and faster and faster until he can’t think anymore, until everything is blinding and burning and not enough, still not enough, never enough. And he begs him for more and Draco grabs the side of his head, and kisses the centre of his mouth, and calls him
He answers that he loves me too.
“Vous êtes un brave homme don’,” Mrs Brodard tells Harry in the reverent silence of the room. "C'est une ben bonne chose q’vous faites là. Une ben bonne chose. Si mon Henri, l’avait eu un endroit comme c’ui là…”
Thank you.
“I hate that I can’t seem to make the words go away,” she adds after a beat. Her voice is small and wet and radiating with pain.
Your turn to ask questions.
I follow him behind the counter through a heavy plum curtain and to a cluttered table in a tiny room full of books and paper.
We are lucky men, your grandad and I. Lucky that we found each other, lucky that we were allowed to have each other for so many long years, lucky to have you, our grandchild, to spoil with sweets and stories. I wish that you are this lucky too, one day.
“I’ll save you,” he whispered to the star-high vaults of the ceilings. “I’ll love you with everything I have and you’ll never be empty again.”
I am not. Since the war, it’s been easier to use Muggle things, though. Fewer memories associated with them, I guess.
Remembered where I heard the word “Draco”. My biscuit-bearing friend kept talking about a Draco who did not listen. Am beginning to suspect it refers to the blond-haired nuisance. If it is true, he is the one keeping the biscuit-giving human out of the garden. Unsure whether I should exact revenge. Have nibbled on his gardening gloves, just to be on the safe side.
It’s the first time he’s been this forward with me. This honest. We’ve always danced around the issue of our attraction to each other before.
The next day, the paint sat on the floor in clean stripes, like an invisible hand had pulled it off the walls.
“I love you,” Harry says again, with tears in his eyes.
“I keep having hallucinations of a dead man. Or a man who’s disappeared at the very least. I keep falling asleep on the floor and dreaming about the same thing over, and over again.”
If he could, reader, Draco would talk to him then. If he knew how to, he’d take Harry’s hands in his own and tell him that he’s been waiting for this moment for months and years, for decades maybe. If he were a different person, he’d kiss Harry right there and then, in the rubble and the flames, and it’d be an ode to the fact they did more than just survive a war: they survived the awful, fragile, brittle kind of quiet that came after it, too.
You wave a gentle cleansing spell over him, and you lie down against his body. You pull the duvet over your body. (It smells like him.) You listen to him breathe deeply in the dark silence of the room and you pretend that you have this. That you have him. You don’t move. You don’t cry.
“I only kiss people I’m in love with. I should have been clearer with you last time, I’m sorry”
If there was one thing you could change in your life, what would it be and why?
The question takes me by surprise. I pause.
“You have me now,” Harry wants to say, and: “you don’t have to forget ever again,” but he finds that every syllable that comes out of his mouth is forever a rosary of
“I want this place to be a safe haven for magical and squib teens who need a break from the world while they deal with stress or trauma or any kind of mental illness,” Harry answers, his voice suddenly more serious than he would like. (
“I loved you so much, Draco,” Harry continues, the words spilling from his lips like water breaking from a dam, “I couldn’t deal with how much I loved you. I don’t know how I would have made it through the first months after the war without you. And even later, even when it hurt so bad, it was still beautiful, you know? It was still everything.”
Harry,
“The biscuits might have been laced, though,” I interject. “They were in your desk. No one except you was going to help themselves to them. Do you keep your desk locked?”
“Please,” Harry acquiesce. Then, he lets out a brittle little laugh. “I think we all needed to build ourselves anew after the war,” he says, perhaps more to himself than to his interlocutor.
Draco’s hand, freed from Harry’s mouth, finds its way to his cock and starts stroking. Draco’s motions are quicker now, more frantic, and he’s babbling in earnest. And Harry loves him, Harry loves him, Harry loves him.
You’re hurt and afraid and it doesn’t matter because life is giving you a chance at being your broken, half-healed self with the man you love by your side, and you want it more than you’ve ever wanted anything in the world.
I smile. He’s not wrong. I’ve grown fond of his quick wit and propensity to find fault with my questions. I rephrase.
I don’t know how to explain everything to you. I’ve never been good with words, have I? It’s what got us into this mess in the first place.
"I’m never letting anyone read that," I decide as I close my journal and get ready for bed.
They’re standing at a safe distance from the last dying flames. Harry is wearing a ratty pair of jeans and the Holyhead Harpies T-shirt Ginny gave him last Christmas; Draco is wearing impeccably pressed gabardine trousers in an elegant shade of slate-grey and a soft linen shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
A beat.
“Nice to see you haven’t changed either, Draco. I almost thought you’d grown a heart when you agreed to help, but I should have known better. I should have known you wouldn’t understand what it means to love something, to want to save it or fix it. My bad.”
As Harry ran his hands over his face, he found his cheeks were wet.
Who Will Heal Our Broken-Hearted Hero?
Blond nuisance came into the yard today. Yelled so loud that even deaf old great-grandpa Gnoctavius ran back underground. Did not understand what the yelling was about: Blond nuisance went nowhere near the prize roses. Black-haired nuisance yelled too. Very bad day. Strongly dislike both of them.
“There you go, Harry,” he finally says, pouring the brightly coloured potion into a cup. “The finest headache potion you will find anywhere in London if I do say so myself.”
The first day, Harry walks along the port, breathing in the salty scent of sea air and letting the wind blow through his hair. The skies are grey and heavy with clouds, but Harry finds he doesn’t mind. He loves it here. It is too early in the season for tourists yet, but there are young children with their parents and loud seagulls fighting over fish, and everything feels so beautifully alive that Harry wants to commit it all to memory, hold it in his hands and cradle it to his heart. He’ll show Draco too someday, he thinks, when they’ll be so deliriously happy that this entire ordeal will be just an anecdote, a laugh and a kiss and
Her face turns serious, as she draws her small dark mouth into a pout. Harry thinks she looks like the star in a silent film, with her carefully applied makeup and the way she flickers in black and white in the stillness of the room.
Do you sometimes imagine what it might be like when we meet?
“I couldn’t stand the thought I was loved, back then. I didn’t think I deserved it. It hurt too much. I couldn’t tell you I loved you either, I was so afraid to let you down. In the end, it’s exactly what I did, isn’t it?”
A well-wisher.
It’s not that you don’t want to stay. Oh, it’s not that you don’t want to watch him wake up, it’s not that you don’t want him to smile at you with sleep-fogged eyes. (You’d give your right arm for that. You’d give an eye or your lungs. If it was still yours, you’d give your entire heart, too.)
Draco’s face is unreadable and still like a granite cliff (but Harry is the waves, is the sea—there is desire enough inside him to wear the stone down.) When Draco finally speaks, his words are hard and sharp, with no softness around the edges:
“I want to touch you,” you finally manage. “Please, let me touch you.”
“You’ve always been one for hopeless cases until they get too hopeless and then you run away, you mean?” he hisses, before turning around and adding in a deadly, quiet tone: “You ran away from your entire life when it got too difficult for you, then ran right back into it by impulse, buying something and letting everyone else fix all the messes it made for you. I should have known, really. It’s what you’ve always done. Still, I expected you to have changed at some point in the past five years because I am, apparently, an idiot.”
back.
The interview comes and goes. You do well, you think. Well enough that you don’t want to pick up all your words from the floor to shove them back into your mouth. Lee shakes your hand and thanks you and—it’s done, you think.
It’s not that you’ve carefully planned it, of course it’s not, because grief takes up all the space inside your skull, heavy and thick. (A sponge sodden with dirty dishwater.)
“I wanted to, you know?” Draco’s tissue paper voice is barely louder than a whisper, all tear-stained and fragile. “Fix you. Make you happy. Deserve you, even. I really wanted to. I went about it all the wrong way, though. I’m sorry.”
“I was with Luna. We’d been dating for three months when Draco died. She saw me at my worst, Potter—she saw the days I started crying in the wee hours of the morning and didn’t stop until I fell asleep. She was there when I couldn’t get out of bed, and when I didn’t shower for a week, and when I spent hours under scalding water, rubbing at my skin, hoping I could wash the grief away like mud. She held my hand through everything, and she never once told me I was too much. If there’s one thing I can tell you, it is that I decided I’d marry her that day. Right there and then under the pouring rain, I vowed to myself I’d spend the rest of my life with this wonderful woman if she’d have me.”
The witch does not smile at me. “Shh,” she hisses, a tattooed finger pressed over her blood-red lips. Then: “Come in”. She points me to a Muggle-looking plastic garden chair in the middle of the corridor. “Sit,” she orders before she leaves.
Then, they’re both naked, and the contact of Draco’s skin on Harry’s is electrifying and they crash together again like magnets or tectonic plates.
When Harry steps into the deserted streets of the town, the sky is still dark and stretching the bright jewels of its stars above him. He walks: past the port and across the beach and on the small earth paths amidst the Queen Anne’s lace and the maritime oak. There is a dash-dash-dash glow of the lighthouse in the distance, guiding ships safely to port. Harry lets it guide its footsteps too. (I
One last kiss, he told himself. One last time.
What you must understand, dearest reader, is that Harry Potter doesn’t want to think of himself as being in love with Draco Malfoy. There are many reasons for that, many complicated reasons, some of them having to do with how the two of them were enemies for the longest time and all of them having to do with the fact that Harry Potter has been steadfastly refusing to take a good look at his emotions since the end of the war.
The trees open for him, close behind him. The path winds and turns and doesn’t go anywhere.
“You’re everything, Draco. You’re everything, and you’re worth fighting for, and I’m so sorry it’s taken me so long to realise. I know you’re always going to be the same person, Draco. And I’m always going to love that person, whether you’re by my side or not. And yes, we might make each other miserable sometimes. Yes, we will fight and we will cry and we will want to quit, because that’s what love is. And when we do, Draco? When we do, we will fight for each other. We will fight for our relationship. We’ll talk it through, and we’ll listen, and we’ll put in the work. And it will be beautiful, Draco. You and me. It will be beautiful despite our traumas and our hangups and the cracks on our souls. I promise you, Draco, it will be beautiful because we will make it so.”
“Yes,” Harry tells Draco as soon as he rushes out of his shop.
“Oh, love, oh love,” Draco answers in a litany of his own, “don’t stop, oh don’t stop… Yes, yes…”
“I love you,” Harry manages. “I love you so much I can’t sleep some nights. I love you so much I can’t breathe or think straight. You’re everything that I want. You’re everything, Draco. You’re everything, and I never want to let you go.”
As soon as I’m able to hold my pen again, I tell him that I love him.
“There will be a part of the house for you, I promise. There will be an entire wing where no one will ever come without your explicit permission,” Harry continues. There is some ghostly clapping and a loud whoop from Iris. “That doesn’t mean you won’t have access to the rest of the building, of course, but I’ll need you to cohabit with the living as best you can there.”
“I had tea from the tea trolley too,” she adds. “But everyone has tea from there. I don’t think whoever did this could have known exactly when I’d want a cup of tea and which cup I’d want to drink it from.”
The words feel like lightning, cutting you clean into halves from the top of your head to the soles of your feet.
When Jemima’s report ends up on her boss’ desk, for the first time in Jemima’s long career, it is not properly filled in. She’s taken liberties with the Infractor’s name and she’s got the name of the business all wrong. There’s not even a violation code. Instead, her writing sprawls over the entire page. The word “third” is heavily underlined and several words are written in capital letters - words like “EXPLODES” and “ME” and “NOT ANYMORE.” Next to Jemima’s report, on her boss’ desk is her Official Ministry Badge and a set of half-burnt Ministry Robes.
There are a few teens too, those whose home life was dire enough that Harry was compelled to ask them to come and help with the renovation. “As a favour,” he said, remembering that kindness is sometimes barb-covered and cutting when you've known nothing but indifference or violence your entire life. They’re good kids, the lot of them. Each of them hurts in their own way, with the spiderweb cracks of abuse and loneliness visible on their souls, but they’re full of life and laughter, and they’ve all started to heal.
), and you feel him push into you, slowly. The feeling is bright-sharp, heavy with pleasure and edged with pain. Draco moves tentatively, and the sinful sounds he makes are almost enough to bring you over the edge.
“I didn’t fight for you when we first broke up,” Harry continues as he slowly closes the gap between them, “and I didn’t fight for you in that hotel room either. I was so sick of fighting after the war, it was all I’d done my entire life, and though everyone kept telling me I’d won, I felt like I’d lost everything that mattered in the process. I was so sick of fighting, and I thought I could get away with not doing it ever again in my entire life. That was why I kept going to these galas, that was why the word
As the grounds of Hogwarts welcome them again, and as they frantically try to cover up the hole the war left in the linear course of their lives, Draco notices it.
Just as I push myself to my feet and prepare to go back to work, I feel the skin of my calf heat up.
“It is indeed!” He beams with pride. “It’s not as big as I’d like, not yet, but I can sell you some of the finest potions in London! Are you looking for something in particular?”
It’s empty.
“I’m not saying I did everything right, Harry. You know that as well as I do. You know exactly how much I regret my past actions, and how much I loathe my former self. I will not begrudge you for bringing it up: I was wrong in every single one of my beliefs then and too comfortable in my own sheltered life to change. Let me say this, though: you’re miserable because you want to be. I keep telling you, over and over again, that you need to put yourself first. And you keep not listening to me. I can’t save you, Harry. I can’t help you if you aren’t willing to change. You’re in love with your hero status, and you’re in love with your sadness, and there’s nothing I will ever be able to do about that, is there? It breaks me, watching you crumble down time and time again because the Ministry called and they want you to talk at some stupid function or other. It exhausts me, having to piece you back together again because you gave them everything you had and there’s nothing left for you anymore. You can’t expect me to watch you fall apart time and time again, I’m not strong enough for that. You need to save yourself, Harry. I can’t be there for you if you don’t.”
Pansy pauses for an instant and rubs at her cheeks with her hand, smudging the wet traces of her carefully applied makeup. She doesn’t notice, and I don’t tell her.
is the reason I’m being threatened. They want me to stop looking into Draco’s disappearance. But see, I think that if I had been a man, I would only have gotten that one. The one about minding my place, that one is about hurting me as a woman. It’s about making me feel scared, and violated, and intimidated.”
“Under no circumstances.” (In Draco’s mouth, Harry muses, every word is a knife. Gleaming and precise and capable of cutting gashes through his flesh.) “You’re welcome to come in and use the Floo like you’ve heard of civilisation, though. You look a fright and you’re drenched to the bone.”
I couldn’t go to Saint Mungos, Ron insisted. Not until we knew what we were dealing with and who we were against. I was only too happy to agree. I didn’t particularly fancy my boss knowing that I spent my lunch hours in shady shops, drinking unknown potions made by suspects. But I still needed to get a proper check-up, and at some point in the discussion, Hermione said something about Theodore Nott. I remembered him from school, barely. Slytherin, friends with Draco. A bit of a wanker. He was different, now, she insisted. He was in a relationship with Lavender and ran an activist clinic for werewolves in a discreet part of town. He was a trained healer, and he wasn’t going to tell anyone about me. And he was my best choice, wasn’t he? My only choice, too.
It’s not that Harry ever meant to buy a sanatorium. Some days, Harry thinks he meant to do very little of what he actually did in his life. On those days, he hits the pub or moves to a different country or lies down in the woods and cries his eyes out. He avoids thinking about it too much, his life. The direction it’s going in too.
Then, there were bad days: dark and awful and too many to count. Days when Draco didn’t want to be touched at all, and there were days when Harry thought the loneliness of not being truly loved would crush him entirely. There were days that were bad for other reasons too, because the atrocities of the war weighed like a stone on Harry’s lungs or because Harry drowned in the wine-dark sea of grieving for everyone he had ever loved. Draco never stayed, on these days. He never knew what to say or how to act. “I can’t always be there for you,” he told Harry. And: “you’re not the only one who hurt. I’m not strong enough to pull you back to your feet.” He never said he was sorry, and Harry gasped for breath in empty rooms, trying to slow the panic-scramble of his heart, trying not to drown in the dark air around him.
It took me by surprise when your grandad kissed me. We were covered in dirt, then, and drenched in sweat. We’d finally found the first of the artifacts and had a solid lead on where to find the others. We were elated by the perspective of a warm meal and a soft bed, and this is the moment he chose to pin me against a tree and cover my mouth with his. And in this instant,
Harry bought more paint. He did not leave it in the house overnight. (
Blaise, are you doing anything tonight?
Harry takes Draco’s hand into his, closes his fingers over the slender palms. Draco closes his eyes.
All three of you, thank you. This fic would not be the same without you.
“Thank you,” Harry says softly as Draco opens the door. “For helping. I know it was a lot to ask. I’m grateful you agreed.”
They kissed after the war, Draco and him. It started with an owl. This was unsurprising; there were many owls after the war (love letters and apologies and thank you, thank you, thank you.)
In the upstairs conservatory, he finds Draco sitting cross-legged on the floor, a mess of glowing lines and figures around him and suddenly,
he didn’t say.
I gesture towards a chair, she pulls it up and sets her handbag on her lap, smoothing the grey wool of her skirt with her left hand. She still doesn’t say a word. I feel her chestnut eyes trying to bore a hole at the base of my throat.
I add. Then, I read it again and cringe. “So much for not being a gothic heroine”, I tell the krup with a broken leg that’s curled up on my bed. “Merlin, I sound like such a mental case.”
I pause. I made my bed, might as well lie in it, right?
“Oh, fuck, Hermione,” I say, because I can’t remember how words work.
Harry sighed and kept staring at the ceiling.
The words seemed to hit Draco harder than Harry had anticipated. He leaned back against the wall, knuckles white and cheeks burning red. He stilled for a moment, took a ragged breath and closed his eyes. Then, he opened them slowly and when he spoke again, his voice was measured and quiet.
“Don’t,” he whispers instead, staring at his hands and without moving even an inch. “We could be happy, Draco. This time around, we could make it work.”
You nod. You don’t even need to think about it. You know he’s worth it. You know you want him. (You know he’s the one, you realise, and the knowledge of it spreads through your veins like liquid nitrogen.)
They sit in silence after that, their hearts heavy and raw with secret but their bodies warmed and soothed by touch.
He pulls you into his bedroom and pushes you onto the bed and you don’t resist. Every cell of you is alive with the sight of this beautiful boy, every inch of your skin is singing from his touch. You run your hands all over his body, and your mouth, and your tongue. You pour everything you feel for him into working him open. He moans and writhes under you and it fills all the holes in your chest.
“Of course,” Harry answers.
Draco lets out a strangled sound and presses his fingers to his lips. There is unspeakable pain in his face. (An unbearable brightness too, sharp and scorching like love or hope.)
Potter,
I decide and pick up my pen before I can think about the fact they must have read my pitiful attempts at journaling.
In the aftermath of the war, Harry Potter became a tidal wave.
Dear Harry Potter,
It might start earlier than that, if I’m honest. Several days earlier. It might start with the newspaper article. I don’t read it, of course. I never do. But still, it goes like this:
“Talk to me,” Harry says again as an ember falls on Jemima's shoulder and her hair promptly catches on fire too.
Then, before I can write Hermione’s address, I feel a warm, tingling sensation on my wrist. I push up the sleeve of my ratty cardigan to reveal yet more writing.
You come hard, face pressed against Draco’s collarbone. For a blissful moment, your brain is entirely silent, entirely empty, entirely bathed in light and warmth and happiness.
Later, you’ll think back to this moment and you’ll wonder why you decided to run. Later, you’ll drink and drink and drink and let alcohol dissolve reality around you, and you’ll will yourself back to that moment. You’ll close your eyes tight, and you’ll imagine what would have happened if you’d run after him, if you’d told him you loved him, if you’d fought for him, but in that moment, you don’t do any of these things. Instead, you rush down the stairs and bolt onto the street and run until you’re out of breath. Then, you collapse, half panting and half sobbing, onto the dirty, rough concrete of the pavement.
Harry doesn’t know if his heart soars or sinks at the words.
“Really?” she asks, twisting a strand of hair around her finger. “Do you mean this? We could really all stay?”
“The one on my thigh, though, that one’s about minding my place as a woman.” She takes another long drink. “Asks me if I know what happens to women who are too loud and don’t know when to shut up and insinuates it might happen to me too. I think the placement of that particular sentence gives me an excellent idea of exactly what it is it’s talking about.”
“I’m not homophobic or anything!” is your brilliant reply, and you’re not entirely sure you should be allowed to speak ever again, not when you keep saying the worst possible things at the worst possible times.
There were days that didn’t hurt like being burned at the stake, of course, there always are. There were days when Draco let Harry be there for him, when he inevitably broke down under the unbearable weight of being alive, when he let Harry hold his hand and talk him through the tears. There were soft moments of silence as they sat on the floor in a bedroom or a bathroom and slowly cast a myriad of spells that glittered around them like fairy dust. There were rare moments when Draco melted in Harry’s arms too, where he let himself be touched and be kissed, and when Harry almost believed it didn’t matter that he always loved more than was loved because this was good, wasn’t it? This was good, and it was beautiful, and it filled Harry with light and hope.
“I can’t live like this, I can’t,” you’d sobbed into the skin of your wrist while a violent wave of nausea wracked your body, making it convulse and shake. “I can’t live without him. I love him, fuck, I love him. I’m fucking gay, and I’m fucking in love, and I can’t go on pretending I’m not.” Your voice grew louder and louder with each word, and you couldn’t bring yourself to care because you needed to tell someone, anyone, about everything you were going through. And suddenly, you weren’t going to be fine at all. Suddenly, none of it mattered any more: all your fear and carefully crafted protection from the world, the press headlines and the interminable interviews, the inevitable hate letters pouring from every window and the word “gay” branded upon your forehead. Suddenly, all that mattered was how sad and defeated Draco had seemed the last time you saw him, how he’d seemed to want you to admit you were gay, to want you to stay or go after him or show him it mattered, what you did together.
who read this chapter as I was writing it and dutifully sat through several scenes more than once in all their different iterations as she reassured me it wasn't entirely rubbish and pointed out all the sentences that broke her.
, for age has made me realise I may very well die tomorrow without having said all the things I wanted to say.
Instead, Harry accepted.
Your hand is black and blue and swollen at the knuckles. You’ve cried, and you’ve yelled, and you’ve begged every single item of furniture in your house to tell you, just tell you how to make him come back. Tell you how to make it right.
He immediately decided that he wouldn’t ever ask Draco for help with the house.
“I remember going to my parents’ for Sunday dinner. Then, my memories start to fade. I remember my parents’ Equinox ball last summer, Miles had a hand over my shoulders and it was the happiest I have ever felt. I remember shopping inon Diagon Alley—a new dress I think, an awful mess of light pink chiffon I would never normally wear. I remember thinking it was wonderful. I remember the smell of roses in Parkinson Manor Park, and I remember thinking Miles was going to propose. I remember bits and pieces, in no particular order, like puzzle pieces that don’t fit together. And I hate it, Potter. I hate it. I hate not having my memories. I hate that there is a hole in my mind where the last two years should be.”
Iris does a small, stilted curtsy. She doesn’t speak.
Who wrote this? Were they being paid by the word? Were they even trying to speak English? My brain hurts from trying to figure out the meaning of the sentences and I feel like I haven’t learned anything useful. I thumb through the book. The chapter is sixteen pages long and I immediately decide I’d rather die without ever breaking the spell than read it to an end. I let the book drop to the floor and sprawl dramatically on the sofa.
I wish your fingers were stroking my skin right now instead of your words. I wish I could touch you right now. I want to touch you so bad.
Draco runs his fingers over the skin of Harry’s chest and around his erect nipples as he pumps Harry’s cock in long, slow strokes, and desire builds in Harry’s chest, bone-shattering and bright.
Draco’s eyes are still closed, and his face is a renaissance painting in the low light of the bedside table (A pained Madonna without a child. Saint Catherine walking to the wheel.) There are no tears on his cheeks, but when he speaks again, his voice is ocean-wet and bark-rough.
“I need to talk to you,” you say so you don’t have to think about the way his body felt against you, about the way his stubble rubbed against your jaw, about the way his leg felt between your thighs. (You realise you’ve grabbed his wrist at some point. You let it go like it’s made entirely of sharp needles and burn-glow embers.)
, I’d have agreed to spending my entire life in that godforsaken forest if it meant I could keep him. I loved him fiercely, then - I had loved him in silence for months.
You mutter something about needing to consult Nicholas about how much to reveal to the press and invite the dicta-quill wielding nuisance to interview you in your home the next day.
I find a quill and a parchment and I write in capital letters:
Harry decided to start with a fresh coat of paint in the downstairs rooms. He bought white paint and stashed it in the piano room overnight. But by the time Harry stood there in the light of morning, dressed in an old pair of jeans and his hair gathered into a messy bun, the paint had vanished entirely.
“Walk the grounds with me?” Harry asked in the soft hum of departing guests.
Have changed my mind about the black-haired one. When I decided to climb up his leg, he did not swing me all dizzy and throw me over the fence. Instead, he gave me a biscuit. He said some things about a man named Draco who would not listen to him. The biscuit was very good so I did not bite him.
“Threats,” Ron says with a sigh as he runs a hand through his hair.
PANSY!!
“I’m sorry,” I tell her. “I’m sorry I’ve spent so long without seeing all that awful stuff that seems so obvious to you. I’m sorry you had to explain all this to me. I’ll try to be better, I promise. I want to be better.”
(And again.)
This story begins with Ginny’s tears and her shaky voice yelling to
“Fuck you, Malfoy.”
That’s a hard question. I think I have, but I didn’t know it at the time. The family I grew up in, they wouldn’t have approved of the boy I had feelings for. Because he was a boy, and for other reasons too. And you’ve got to understand how important it was to me that I pleased my family, then. It was the most significant thing in the world. It sounds silly now that I’m not a child anymore, but for the longest time, I was taught that family was all that I had, and all I’d ever have, and that if I didn’t live up to their expectations, I wouldn’t have anything anymore. So I never admitted I had feelings for the boy, not to anyone and especially not to myself. Might have been just as well, really. I don’t think he thought very highly of me. I would likely just have embarrassed myself.
Then, the door opens and a blond figure is standing in the doorway, and Harry’s heart stops for an instant.
“It’ll be about twenty minutes before you can feel the effect, you really want to take it at once.” He smiles as one would smile at a scared dog or a fussy child, reassuring and patronising. I take the cup from his fingers. And then, because I can’t think of any excuses, I make my third mistake:
Draco’s face is split open by loss and grief.
He moves forward towards you, moves in to kiss you. You turn your head.
And between the lines, Harry read:
Kissing Harry Potter is heady like drowning, and Draco finally, finally lets go, lets himself be submerged, lets himself drift in this vast sea of quiet.
Ron raises an eyebrow.
It feels good, saying it out loud. Freeing.
Then, Draco finally touches Harry, finally palms his cock in warm hands, and Harry thinks he will go entirely mad with the friction and the pressure and the mere thought that it’s Draco touching him (finally, finally, finally.)
“Oh, is that him?” she asks Draco with a girlish sort of curiosity as soon as she spots Harry. Draco turns his head, then nods.
“I am, actually,” I lie, and it is my first mistake. “I can feel a terrible headache coming on and I really can’t afford to take the time off this afternoon.”
“I want to learn you by heart,” Harry continues as he slips a wet finger into the tight heat and Draco bites down a cry, “the whole of you. I want to know every inch of beautiful skin, every curve and every edge.”
“Pounding,” he repeats as he finds the right page and sets the book down on the table. He busies himself with clearing the table to make space for a small silver cauldron; I crane my neck and try to make out the contents of the book. It is some sort of potion recipe. I don’t know what I expected.
Then, every ghost is speaking at once, assuring Harry of their consent and talking excitedly among themselves about how it will feel to share their space with the living once again.
Hermione shakes her head. “I usually lock the door to my office when I go, but plenty of people have keys that give them access to the entire floor.”
She stumbles into my office on a Tuesday morning, all perfect makeup and sleek shiny hair, her stiletto heels striking the flagstone floor in sharp, short, deafening taps.
Behind the mountains, the sun is slowly starting to set and the last rays of it are setting fire to every wall. The sight of it is breathtaking.
What I don’t expect from him is to take several steps back while repeating that “I can’t… it can’t...” before turning around and running away.
“Can I help you?”
Inside Harry’s chest, everything is fragile and crumbling like chalk or old clay with every word. Harry ignores it. It’s just that he needs to fix that house. (It’s not Draco. It’s not. Not anymore.)
Harry pulls Draco to his feet, gently.
He listens carefully through all of it, tense and serious.
“He… He never did anything to me.” The air is thick in Harry’s lungs, the words heavy as lead on his tongue. “Not… Like that… Not in the magical sense.”
Useless. I crumble it up in my fist and toss it at the wall ragefully. One hour, I’ve searched through inane love letters from idiots! One hour! And for what? For this? For this drivel about soulmates? I am no nearer to understanding the whole thing than I was before my trip to the library!
I don’t point out that he’s breaking our unspoken rules. Instead, I answer:
“I don’t think we’re working out, Draco and I,” he sobbed into her hair as she drew him into a tight hug, her face full of concern.
Draco kisses you. It’s not a pretty kiss. It’s not gentle and soft and romantic. You bite his lip. He claws at your shoulders, bruise-hurt fingers digging deep into the flesh. You moan. You writhe underneath him. He pins you to the floor and kisses you harder. You lose yourself entirely.
Ginny’s already asleep when you get home, half-drunk and petrified with fear. She looks so small and fragile in your large bed, you’re overcome with the desire to protect her and keep her safe. Then, you realise what you’ve just done, you realise how much it’d hurt her if she knew, and shame rolls over your body like a tidal wave.
And all the while, the rhythmic glow of the lighthouse washes over them like the verses of a rhyme long forgotten. (
Draco starts fucking you in earnest after that, grabbing your shoulders and your hair, biting vicious kisses into the skin of your back and calling out your name. Pleasure overcomes you, blinding-white and scorching-hot. You make embarrassing sounds, you lose yourself entirely in him, in the motion in the act. You want it to never end—the feeling of him inside you, the sounds of him and the smell of him. You want it to never end, but it feels too right, too good, and you feel your orgasm in your bones a split second before you come all over the floor, Draco’s name on your lips. Draco comes at the same time, clutching at your hair and groaning curse words into your neck.
You end up firecalling Lee and declaring that if Draco won’t listen, you’ll just have to yell at the entire world until he hears.
The words are the first thing I see when I wake up, lazily stretching along my right arm. And that’s when I finally realise something is seriously wrong.
“Anything,” you soothe. “Anything you want.”
“I was there too. I remember it too. It’s unbearable tonight,” he does not add because you’re Aurors, and you’re professionals, and you’re not supposed to be affected by these things.
I touch myself again, before I go to sleep, all the while imagining his hands on me, his mouth on my neck and his name on my lips.
She doesn’t let me answer, which is a good thing because I don’t want to remember anything about that awful day at all.
You don't speak for the longest time. You've never been good with words, and what is there to say? Nothing, or perhaps everything. Perhaps every single word in the English language crowds in your mouth, and you don't know which one to begin with. You don’t know, so you kiss Draco until both of you are out of breath, exhausted and exhilarated all at once. When you finally part, his eyes are closed, soft blond eyelashes on soft porcelain skin, and you’re overcome with a wave of indescribable emotion, sadness and hope blurring into one. You cup his face in your hands, caressing the skin behind his ear in soothe-soft strokes.
(This is a list of the things he also notices : there are three patches of moss in the schoolyard. One hundred and seven stones are missing from the walls. Eleven rooms have doors that don’t shut right. None of these things matter, but Draco notices them anyway.)
I’m glad we’re doing this.
Draco.
“I came for you,” Harry replies, still and breathless. (Teetering on the edge of a cliff, arms extended and eyes closed, a second away from the void.)
“Upstairs! Hurry up!” The faint echo of her voice rings in the empty room.
You’re tired and in pain, and you’ve just realised you aren’t going to be able to go back home quite yet. You’re still a bit drunk on everything that happened with Draco, on his skin and his hair and the softness of his mouth when he kissed you. And this, perhaps, this is why you turn reckless all of a sudden.
You yell at him to wait.
He does none of those things.
You kiss him through his orgasm, and you kiss him through yours, and when the waves of pleasure finish coursing through your skin, you're still kissing. You want to kiss him forever. You want to die right then and there, with his mouth still on your skin, because it would mean you’d get to die happy and that’d be enough. Draco keeps kissing you, and your chest is alight with the intimate knowledge of all the perfect ways his mouth fits against yours, so you don’t die. So you kiss him. (You kiss him. You kiss him.)
“It’s okay. It’s not so bad I’m dead. I don’t mind. My parents were going to marry me off to a man anyway, so you know, when you weigh up the options, tuberculosis isn’t all that bad,” she continues. “No offence meant, of course, since you’re both men and all that. I just prefer girls by a lot. It wasn’t something I could just tell my parents when I was alive, though. I would have had to marry the bloke and have children and...”
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
“The public deserves to know you are gay, Mr Potter!”
You nod. You don’t thank her. You don’t think she’d take kindly to it if you did. Instead, you tell her about the interview on the radio that Lee is letting you do. You just want Draco to hear it, you say, just that, and you’ll let him make his choice once he knows the truth.
That night, when Harry lets his hand snake across his belly and down into his pyjama bottoms, he thinks of all the good bits and nothing else.
Mrs Malfoy hands him a glass and sits down opposite him.
. She worked on schools and sacred sites in eastern Namibia, but I think I might be able to apply her framework to your house since it was a hospital once.
“I don’t… I don’t and I do at the same time... I remember some of it...” Pansy withdraws her hand from mine and buries her fingers between her knees in a nervous motion. “Have you ever had those dreams that you can’t remember entirely? Like there are entire chunks missing from the story, and it’s right there at the edge of your brain but you can’t seem to ever remember them? That’s how I feel about the last two years.”
And in the warm light of afternoon, surrounded by happiness and friendly faces, with his hand in Draco’s, Harry finally thinks he knows what it’s like to be home.
Harry took a Portkey to Romania the very next day.
(He doesn’t need to know that you watched him sleep and, in the soft, silent darkness, pretended you were good enough for him to love you. Doesn’t need to know the awful feelings spilling inside your chest, choking you with shame and unbearable desire for what you can never have.)
who took time out of her day on a very short notice to deal with all my typos and random commas, to help me be as vulgar as I wanted to be and to give me very good advice.
for being lovely and betaing this chapter so very quickly after it took me several months to write.
When they finally break apart, Harry whispers onto the skin of Draco’s neck that he can’t understand the world anymore, but he finds it oddly comforting that Draco is willing to fabricate sense, just for him.
“I’m sorry too, honey,” Ron says from behind me. I lift my head from Hermione’s curls to see him standing behind her, his hand on her shoulder. “I should have understood it was about more than threats the first time you explained. I should have listened better.”
, darling? You used to love eating apricots in the garden of her house in
Iris’ voice is firm and matter-of-fact. Harry does not open his eyes, does not lift his head from the soft, dark wood of the pew.
He always has, really, it’s not a conscious decision as much as something that happened while Lucius was ignoring his son (Draco counted the floorboards in his playroom: Fourty-two. Draco divided it by two and six and seven, and everything hurt a little less). Later, when Narcissa stroked his hair softly, Draco made a mental list of all the flowers that were as beautiful as her voice (it went : lilies, peonies, orchids.)
“I’m going to fuck you, Potter,” Draco whispers into the skin of your shoulder. “I’m going to fuck you like you’ve never been fucked. I’m going to make you scream, and I’m going to come inside you, and it’s going to feel so good. Oh, you’re going to be so good for me, aren’t you, Potter?”
“What did you say?”
It’s the only thing you can think of. You grab his wrist and tighten your fingers around it. Your joints hurt. You want to squeeze more. You want to hurt him. You want to bring him down and make him sob, you want to ruin him and break him and make him forget how you moaned and whimpered under his fingertips.
I pick up the receipt: Hawthorne’s Apothecary is written on top in a curly script. Underneath, an amount of galleons is penned in ink. No mention of what the galleons have been exchanged for. I turn it between my fingers for a while, then I spell it attached onto the pitiful notes I’d taken. I look at her and her face is equal parts anger and loss, confusion and resignation. I can’t think of any more questions to ask.
“Right. Because that would be awful, wouldn’t it? Really fucking disgusting.”
You think of it again the very next day.
Harry’s almost ready for bed by the time there’s a soft knock in his door that evening. Draco’s in the corridor, wearing the same soft jumper and flannel trousers as the day before.
“You don’t owe them anything,” Draco drawled when Harry told him. There was a cold kind of fire in his eye, something that reminded Harry of ancient descriptions of hell. “It’s not like they care about everything you had to sacrifice to save them the rest of the year.”
His soft grey eyes are on you and you forget everything about leaving and healing. You want to smile and kiss his forehead. You want to yell at him that you know you’ll never be good enough for him or right enough for him, but would he let you pretend just a little more? Would he love you today, just for a while, would he kiss your hair and hold your hand?
“Well, the one on my arm here tells me it’s better for everyone if Draco stays dead.” She pulls up the sleeve of her cardigan as she speaks, revealing words in a bold black font sitting neatly on her skin.
Slowly, Draco pulls away and brings his wrists to his chest, his face split open by pain and regret. There is something different there too, something harder and sharper like resolve. (Harry suddenly knows Draco is not going to stay.)
I know you won’t open this letter. I don’t even know why I keep writing. Hope, I imagine. Stupid, stupid hope. Love, too. So much love. Love really does make fools out of us.
Then, I turn the page.
they said to each other. And:
Me neither.
Draco opens the door. You stop thinking again because he’s here, pained and lovely, struck by your presence as if by lightning. You don’t tell him you love him, but you walk up to him, slowly, and he lets you (he lets you, he lets you) and it is a first step.
for her invaluable advice, her input, and for organising the summer workshops.
Harry’s heart sinks and soars all at once.
I sit in front of the Battersea Shield and I open a new page.
But he’s lived through a war, Lee has, and he knows how to keep a cool head. He makes you repeat yourself. And then, he makes you explain it all from the beginning.
You still come harder than you’ve ever come with Ginny.
Draco’s fingers map him, at first, with soft-trace fingertips. They learn all the curves and crooks of him, they classify and catalogue the colours and the texture of the skin, and only when they have explored him entirely, only when they have discovered every last secret spot, does Draco palm his cock in earnest and start stroking, in gentle, rhythmic motion. Whimpers and moans spill from Harry’s mouth like a strand of pearls or a waterfall. The sensation is blinding and deafening, pleasure courses like molten metal in Harry’s veins, curls into his every bone. It feels better than any sensation has the right to, Draco’s fingers on him, Draco’s soft lips kissing his side and whispering praise into his hip bone. (
“And what did he come here for exactly, to break your heart? Was that your deal? I’m not one to judge, but that sounds like an incredibly ill-conceived plan if it was.”
The words sliced through Harry’s skin,
So this is the chapter that earns this fic the tag "Quite a mess with POVs really" but I think it's also where things start to get interesting. I hope it'll work for you.
Then, next to it:
“He was ashamed,” Mrs Malfoy answers softly. “I’m afraid I taught him that too—in a world where only perfection is good enough, forgiveness is an unbearable reminder that you failed. He might be able to accept it now, but you must be certain you’re able to offer it. My son has suffered so much already and I can’t bear to watch him hurt any more—please, don’t break his heart again.”
“Potions and misogyny…” I say after a while, “do you think the same people responsible for this are also the people responsible for drugging Pansy?”
Draco doesn’t say anything, but he stops and turns around. When Harry feels the soft, familiar magic of a gentle drying charm wash over his skin, he resists the urge to close his eyes, even though it feels like cashmere and Earl Grey tea (like lilacs in a vase in front of an open window.)
“Just stay the fuck away from me,” you say, letting go of his wrist and turning away.
“Getting desperate, Potter?” he taunts as you close the door behind him. “With your fame, I’d imagine witches would be all over you. Maybe you can’t get it up with them, mmh? Is that the problem, Potter?”
Does it work?
Draco eventually noticed.
So Harry loved Draco. He loved Draco immensely and patiently like the sea loves the sky. He loved Draco with everything he had, with all his blood and every single one of his breaths. Still, Draco sometimes wouldn’t speak to him for days at a time. Still, Draco wouldn’t tell him he loved him, and Draco wouldn’t move in with him. “Don’t rush me,” he told Harry.
Draco nods, and joy fills your throat, sweet and tart like lemon sorbet. You take him in your arms, and you hold him because you’re allowed to, now. You’ve gone through hell, and you’ve made it to the other side, where there is sunshine on your skin and a smile on your lips, and where you can wrap your arms around the fragile form of Draco and never let go.
When Malfoy fucks you into the mattress, later that night, it’s rough and vicious. He pulls at your hair, and he leaves bruises all over your skin, and he doesn’t try to kiss you.
In his letters, Draco had felt like an endless stream of promises and secrets, like the sun in the sky, like a fire in the night. Draco had felt like a kindred spirit, like the only other person in a world populated by the painted-on smiles of mannequins. Draco had understood the pain, had understood the rage, and when he kissed Harry in a moonlit forest, surrounded by trees and silence, Harry thought his heart was going to burst open with brightly coloured happiness-confetti.
“Let me tell you what you’re going to do, Harry, since you’re too stupid to figure it out on your own. You’re going to go to your hotel this very instant, and you’re going to pack your bags, and then, you’re going to Apparate to wherever Draco’s dragged his sorry arse and you’re going to convince him that he needs to take a chance on you, or you’re going to die trying.”
Harry smiles and thanks her as he walks on, slowly. Iris floats gently beside him. Draco trails slightly behind.
Draco categorises things in his mind.
I smile. Maybe I shouldn’t be too quick to judge people either after all.
Before Harry can react, magic washes over him, acrid and earthy like pine needles and fire-smoke. When the man speaks again, Harry understands every word. When Harry asks about Draco, perfect Swedish flows from his mouth.
“You were always too good for me. I caused you too much harm,” he continues in a broken voice, “I’m sorry I ran. That was not my most dignified moment, I’ll admit, but I couldn’t take the rejection from you. Not again. Not when I’d finally let myself believe there was some happiness to be found for me in the world. Not when I’d finally let myself believe I could have this.”
Pansy! Where are you?
he realised at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth coats. And:
I still love him, you know, even after all this time. I loved him through the aftermath of the war. I loved him the first time he took your mum in his arms and cried. I loved him when your mum grew up, moved out, married your dad. I’ll love him until my very last breath because his eyes are still the same shade of green, his hair still the same horrifying bird’s nest it always was - I should have expected that his scalp would steadfastly refuse to go bald.
She stops pacing and turns towards me. Fear and anger paint her face in equal measure. She looks me straight in the eye and unbuckles her belt.
Draco kisses him.
Still, that night, when he comes back to the inn, mud-covered and wet, disappointment is sharp as a needle in his chest. He thought he would have found Draco by now. He thought he would have an answer.
Harry does not answer because he’s forgotten how words work. There is the sun inside his chest, glowing bright and warm, and he’s entirely sure he’s combusted already and risen like a phoenix from the ashes. He throws his head back and grabs handfuls of leaves from the forest floor as if he’d find eternity or time there. As if he could hold the seconds between his fingers, ball his fists tight and stop them from escaping, as if he could make the moment stretch and stretch and stretch until the entire universe caught fire and collapsed on itself, and then longer still, until every star turned silent and dark, until galaxies died and were born again.
It is the first thing Draco says when Harry shows him the hilltop building. And he’s right, of course, he’s right, but Harry can’t bring himself to care because Draco’s there beside him, surrounded by the austere mountain slopes  and the crisp air of April. Harry can’t stop watching him. They walk towards the house in silence, mismatched companions (One slow, the other quick. One dark, the other light. One a wound, the other a knife.)
I ignore it. A part of me knows I shouldn’t. A part of me knows I should be alarmed. A part of me knows I should floo Hermione about it, or talk to my healer about it, or do anything at all, but I can’t find it in me to care. There is much to do here, I need to nurse an ill mooncalf back to health, and I need to prepare the enclosures for when the Thestrals give birth, and I can’t afford to waste time worrying about my skin. So I push it down and I don’t think about it again.
(Finally.)
The whole mess starts with Pansy Parkinson because of course, it does.
In my veins, my blood turns cold with the unbearable certitude that everything is so much worse than I thought.
Then, the word
One man reaches out to the other, with bright smiles and loud words, and the other recoils for fear he’ll break apart entirely. And then, there’s only one man in that street, alone in the soft heat of an early summer evening with a smile that feels like a knife gash across his face. And all the while, Jemima Graves writes her report and thinks about the charred holes in her robes and doesn’t notice anything at all.
Draco doesn’t turn his head towards Harry. Cows are grazing in a lush green field, their bells echoing throughout the valley. The mountains are still snow-capped, a stark contrast to the way spring unfurled wildflowers and thick grasses at their foot. He lets out a long breath.
And when Harry’s anger turns him into a geothermal spring, boiling and fuming and bubbling, Draco leaves three rock crystals in the pockets of his school robe while he’s at quidditch practice, because they too were once warm and liquid, and they’ve cooled down into something beautiful (still, he counts : fourteen shoes and eight socks strewn across the floor, two brooms leaning by the door. It adds up to twenty four which is divisible by two and three and four and six and eight.)
I don’t know. It’s not that I’ve not done things that I regret. I mean, I was in a war. People I loved died because of the decisions I made, and I can’t ever say that I don’t regret that. But I’m not that person anymore. And I’ve also learned that the stuff that happened happened, you know? You can never take it back. You can never change it. You’ve got to accept it if you want to stand a chance to forgive yourself for it.
“Yes,” he sobs. “I’ll have you. Oh, Harry, I’ll have you. Oh, you’re everything I’ve ever wanted.”
“I’m leaving,” Draco answers softly, still folding the same shirt. (One sleeve, then the other, then unfolding it again.) Still not looking at Harry. “Just this once, remember?”
“I’m going to the bathroom,” he says, draping the sheets around him and getting out of bed, “and when I get back, either you’ll have your shit together, or you’ll be gone, understood?”
There’s a bottle of firewhiskey on the table.
Yes. Today. Four O’Clock? Somewhere public but not too crowded. British Museum? In front of the Battersea Shield?
“Slow,” he whispers against Draco’s neck. “I want to savour every last piece of you.”
An excited whisper runs throughout the room.
“You shouldn’t be expected to, Harry. It’s not right. This whole rotten thing never was, can’t you see? They were adults and you were a child, you should never have been expected to put yourself at risk to save them.”
Malfoy answers with something snarky. You fall back into the familiar ebb and flow of trading blows until you spit out:
“Okay,” Lee says softly. “Okay, Harry. It’s your choice, and I respect it. I’ll see you tomorrow for the interview.”
I think better of it.
Malfoy’s face darkens. He pushes himself to his feet and puts his clothes back on in angry, brusque motions.
"My colleague Ermelinda already did when I first saw them. She’s pretty good at diagnostic spells too. She couldn’t find a magical signature. We couldn’t come up with a counter-spell either, as you can see.”
The bastard is looking at you, one eyebrow arched and a challenge in his eyes. His lips are inches away from yours, and you could bite them to stop the words from coming out, you could kiss them, you could crowd him against the wall and...
“Kiss me, you coward,” I hiss at a helmet with odd eyebrows and a moustache sitting in a display case. “You said you were going to,” I add, barely above a whisper.
“I…” Draco starts, then stops to run a hand over his face. “It can’t have been easy being with me,” he continues, quieter. “I wasn’t the best boyfriend. Hell, I was pretty shit, if I’m honest. I was in a pretty shit place too.”
“I want you,” he whispers all the same. And it is all he ever wanted—this, just this. Draco and him and the trees above their heads, this hushed-soft intimacy of brokenness and desire. It’s all he’s ever wanted, it’s everything he thought about when he came into his own hand in the darkness of his room, when he cried into his pillow at night—and it’s finally happening.
“Come, lie down for me, love.”
The reality of it hits you like an avalanche.
When Jemima Graves, Ministry Official and Qualified Specialist in Architecture Legality Assessment is called to the scene, her report goes thusly: “George Weasley did not mean to invent the exploding extension, and Harry Potter did not mean to set it up. It is all a big misunderstanding, and I have been assured it will not happen again.” There is a note spellotaped to the bottom of the page, requiring a new set of official ministry robes on the grounds of hers being charred black and burned to a crisp in several areas.
Draco’s voice is soft like snow and cracked like frost-fissured soil.
There is someone standing at the edge of the sea, and the sight of it fills Harry with lightning, crackling and violent and bright.
“Do you have any recollection at all of anything prior to that engagement party?” The question is awkward, of course, if only because my voice sounds deafeningly loud in the wake of her pained whisper, but I figure it is the best way to help her stop crying. Pansy’s never liked having people pity her, and I can’t quite bring myself to entertain the emotion anyway.
You can’t fault her, you’ve been a shitty boyfriend. The press is all up in it, of course, and your life is hell for a while. You don’t mind. It keeps you busy, avoiding the reporters and turning away all the owls. It stops you from thinking. Then, Celestina Warbeck wears the wrong dress at a gala or serves breakfast tea at four o’clock or something and the media frenzy dies down.
I think I could find a man beautiful no matter what he looks like, but if we’re talking about purely physical criteria, my ideal partner would probably have dark hair. Striking eyes. A gorgeous smile. I imagine he’d be quite muscular, too. The type of muscle you get from an active lifestyle, mind you, not the type you get from the gym. More importantly, he’d have to be kind. He’d have to be able to remind me to be brave when I’m not. I think I’d want him to be passionate too. Able to learn from me and teach me new things in turn. It would definitely have to be someone I could talk to, about everything. Someone I could trust blindly and who would know how to make me feel loved.
“Fine,” she exhales even though you’ve not asked her for anything at all. “I will intercede in your favour, Potter, but only because my best friend’s been moping over you for the past few months, and because he’s currently locked up in his childhood home, having an idiotic breakdown over you. And, if you hurt him, Potter—if you hurt him, I will kill you myself. Have I made myself understood?”
And Harry knows he’ll never be the same again, never be alright again. He knows he should push Draco away. He knows he should keep his shirt on, should keep his head on his shoulders and his heart inside his chest because it’ll ruin him, the burn-shock contact of Draco’s skin on his. It’ll gut him like a fish and turn him inside out.
“Do you remember who I was with, Potter?”
Ron waves his wand in the general direction of the kitchen and summons three bottles of beer from the fridge. He uncaps one for Hermione who grabs it with a grateful “thank you” and takes a long drink before she answers.
“I love him too.”
“Oh,” she says, and clasps a hand to her mouth, in an old-fashioned sort of gesture.
, where Björn Bottlebottom describes the use of the spell in rural Herefordshire in the following terms:
“Draco,” Harry whispers back because the words have all left his chest, and everything that’s left is the feeling of home and the tangible form of the man he loves between his arms.
You can’t hurt her anymore, you decide. She’s done everything for you; she waited while you were walking to your death, and she held you in the aftermath, and you love her, you love her so much, you’ve always loved her. (You do, oh you do. Don’t you?) You need to be better, for her, you resolve. You need to make it right, take every feeling that bubbled up to the surface when you were held tight in Draco’s arms, when his breath was on your neck and his leg in between your thighs and shove it down, down, down into the deepest pit of yourself and keep it there forever.
His entire face is alight with the challenge of cracking the mystery of Harry’s house, and Harry remembers the glimmer in his eyes better than he’d like.
I'm awoken by a warm sensation on the skin of my stomach the very next day:
A look of utter confusion creeps onto the man’s face.
“I want you inside me,” he whispers into the crook of Draco’s neck as his roughshod fingers work open Draco’s trousers. There is something, dancing at the back of Draco’s eyes when Harry leans in to kiss him. Something hotter than the sun and sharper than flint. (Something dangerous and bright, like fire or hope or desire.) When they kiss, it’s urgent and rough, and the lightning in Harry’s chest spills out entirely, in bright-burn arcs. Harry places a careful hand between Draco’s legs, stroking at the hardness through the fabric with infinite reverence. It steals his breath from him, that Draco wants him.
“I’ll burn this entire street if I damn well have to,” Harry continues over the sound of sirens filling the air. “I’ll burn this entire town if that’ll make you talk to me because I can’t take the silence anymore. I can’t take the silence that covered the world after the war, I can’t take not being in your life, I can’t take not having your name on my life every single day because I—”
“Well, you know me,” Harry answers with a small, self-deprecating laugh. “Always been one for hopeless cases, really.”
Ate some roots. Had a nap. Productive day.
Harry turns his head, slightly, and Draco’s face is inches away from his.
, perhaps greater than you’ll ever realise, but for all his virtues, careful planning has never been one of them. This is how we found ourselves in a Swiss forest with nothing but a collection of incomplete memories your grandad had managed to extract from an old acquaintance of my father and half a pack of crackers for sustenance. It really is a testimony to the power of love that I didn’t murder him there and then.
Behind Draco’s eyes, a storm is raging.
, Harry thinks. Draco’s eyelashes flutter shut, he lets out a small, shaky breath. They’re still holding hands, and Harry can barely remember how to breathe because if they can kiss in this dream, and if Draco isn’t really dead, perhaps there is hope after all. Hope that one day he can kiss Draco in the real world instead of in forests and by the sea and empty labs. Hope that if this version of Draco wants him too, kisses him too, perhaps so might the real version of Draco one day. Harry’s heart catches fire, bright and hot and hungry at the thought.
When Harry thanks her and shakes her hand, Mrs Malfoy’s cheeks are perfectly dry and her face perfectly composed, but when she smiles at him, there is an ocean of sadness and regret dancing across the tight line of her lips.
He steps inside anyway.
Harry offered to buy it the very next day.
Every word is like a sea urchin between Harry’s teeth, their sounds scratching long bloody gashes on his tongue and inside his cheeks.
There are pictures of me too, looking… well… sad. I guess that’s one thing they didn’t have to make up. It’s not that I am not happy for Ginny, I am, I really am—it’s just that lately I’ve been finding it a little harder to smile. There’s no reason for it, not really, Luna talked me into working at her sanctuary and rehabilitation facility for magical creatures after I quit the Aurors and I love it more than I’ve ever enjoyed firing spells at people and getting yelled at in training sessions—it’s just that I’ve grown increasingly unsure that it’s all that I wanted or hoped or expected out of life. Watching Ginny in her white tuxedo, with her arms wound tight around a beautiful girl and happiness all over her face, I wondered if I was ever going to find someone too. I wondered if I was ever going to be this happy, this certain that I’m doing the right thing. And as much as I tried to hide it, I still look like a wet, miserable cat in every single picture.
Draco’s still sleeping when you wake up. You feel wrong-footed, waking up in his home. (In his room. In his bed.) You stand up, carefully. You slip on your clothes. He doesn’t need to know you were here, you decide. He doesn’t need to know you didn’t go yesterday, doesn’t need to know you spent the night in his bed.
“Iris told me she was sent to
It’s familiar and immaculate. Empty, too.
“And if you have, indeed, been drugged, Miss Parkinson, can you think of anyone who could have done it?”
Then, all of a sudden, there are three empty pint glasses in front of you, and you can’t take it anymore. You push yourself up, your palms coming into hard contact with the wood of the table. Heads turn to you, suddenly. You don’t look at them. You walk across the room.
