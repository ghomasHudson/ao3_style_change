Draco lazily laced his fingers through Harry's in response, their hand loosely intertwined together.
"Fair enough. So think of a new happiest memory," said Draco. "Preferably something that has happened since the war."
The hint of nostalgia Harry got when a glimpse of the broom at the beginning of the game caught him off guard momentarily but he knew that he couldn't let that distract him.
They kissed passionately and fiercely, Draco threw himself over Harry so that he was straddling the younger boy's lap, fingers buried in his dark, and still slightly damp, hair, as their faces touch, hot and salty tears smeared against their cheeks, intermingling and drying as they fought to forget.
He returned to his bed and picked at the breakfast he had been left as he gazed out the open window.
"I'm sure that can be easily arranged. Quite a few parties have already expressed interest in... sponsoring you," she watched his reaction.
"I swear to God," Harry growled. Malfoy opened one eye and looked at his visitor. He rolled his eyes and closed it again. "Those little shits will be sorry."
"Peppermint toad?" Harry offered, holding the box out toward Malfoy. The last thing he wanted tonight was for Draco and Ron to argue.
"Harry." The use of Harry's first name on Draco's tongue made his heart skip a beat. "You seem to forget who you're talking to," he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm. "I've hurt so many people, and I hurt myself because of it. Everyone grieves in different ways. As much as I hate to admit it, you and I are very similar."
The group peered around at two tables where the special guests were sat, attempting to suss out who was in attendance. Harry could see Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic sitting with several other ministry wizards and witches. A surprising guest was Madame Maxime with two older looking students to her left, perhaps Beauxbatons' head boy and girl. The recognisable uniforms of Durmstrang also caught his eye, next to a very grumpy looking man in his late thirties who Harry assumed was their new headmaster. There were another two guests in complementing blue and deep red uniforms that Harry did not recognise next to a very old looking witch.
Harry saw Ron stare daggers at the Ravenclaw across the room at the mention of Harry and Malfoy getting along.
"Come on 'Mione," Ron places a hand on his girlfriend's shoulder. Ron still did not know how to dance so Hermione was teaching him before the ball tomorrow.
From a distance he could tell four of them were boys, around fourth year, and there was one girl whose dark blonde ponytail swayed as she walked. They rounded a corner and Harry sped up, careful not to make much noise, so he would not lose track of them.
"You'll be happy to know that under me, Slytherin will be playing fairly this year, none of those dirty tactics that spoil it for everyone," said Vaisey. Harry couldn't immediately think of a repy to that. He was surprised, of course. Where had this kid been hiding for the past few years?
"And he already comes around for dinner about four times a week," said Harry. "Why don't we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?"
Harry was used to people staring and whispering whenever he went anywhere in the wizarding world. Every year in Diagon Alley or a new batch of first years arrived Harry felt like they saw him as this amazing spectacle.
Ron grumbled something inaudible but took his girlfriend's hand to join the few couples that had already taken to the dance floor.
"I'm so proud of you all!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed as she caught sight of her two ginger haired children as well as Harry and Hermione, tears streaming down her face. "You all did so well!"
As Harry slowly made his way to the grass he swore he spotted a single tear run down Ron's freckled cheek as he threw his arm around his best friend.
Harry did, in fact, split the roll, buttered it and spread some jam on it. He ate it all, taking McGonagall's words to heart. He felt very full after consuming it, considering his stomach was not used to the calories. He saw, out of the corner of his eye, Hermione watching him with a smile on her face. He felt a ghost of a smile tug at his lips as he lifted his yes toward her.
Soon enough, they were neck to neck again, reaching out to the golden snitch which fluttered erratically just out of either of their grasps.
Harry lost track of time as he and Ron through the Quaffle, taking it in turns to defend the goal posts. Ron felt very proud of himself never letting a single one of Harry's shots get anywhere close to the three hoops. Harry was definitely not the greatest Keeper either, laughing along with Ron when most of his attempts to block his best friend's attacks failed. They both heartily joked that Harry should definitely stick to his position of Seeker lest Gryffindor suffer the greatest defeat in history.
Harry walked out into the frightfully cold air of the English countryside. The sun had almost completely set, a thin blanket of orange light still peeked of the trees in the distance. Without a wand, Draco couldn't have gotten far.
The trio managed to ride up to the castle in their own carriage. Ron kept craning his neck out of the windows to look at the Thestrals in awe. "Wicked!" He remarked.
One thing Harry noticed was the Slytherin prince no longer had his head held high and a smug grin on his face. In fact, his shoulders were slumped, making him appear smaller than he was, dark purple rings hung beneath his eyes, twisting his face into a garish and hollow facade. He didn't even spit a poison-laced 'Potter' in Harry's direction as he passed. He had just sat down, avoiding eye contact with the rest of the room, and with a lazy flick of his wand, drew his deep green curtains around the bed.
He had received a note from McGonagall at breakfast that he was to attend the first of his tutorials with Malfoy that afternoon. He was still not permitted to leave the Hospital Wing until further notice so all rendezvous with the Slytherin had to be performed under the watch of Madame Pomfrey, who Harry is sure, would not be happy with this arrangement.
"You'll write to me, won't you?" Regulus asked his parents immediately, capitalising on the momentary absence of his brother.
"Well," Harry sat down on his bed facing Malfoy. "I was thinking about staying here... with you." Harry's voice was so quiet that Draco had to stop what he was doing to hear him.
The three boys were staring at the large clock on the wall. She had promised only three hours until they could leave, two hours and fifty-nine minutes had elapsed.
That was easier said than done, however. The fast motion of kicking himself off the ground and into the air made Harry extremely dizzy. He took a second to regain his composure.
"It is tradition that the seventh years of Hogwarts leave the grounds for the last time, the same way they arrived all those years ago," McGonagall explained. "In twenty minutes the boats will set off across the lake toward Hogsmeade. Siblings of those graduating are asked to leave the Hall and join the rest of your house in the Entrance Hall to board the carriages now rather than later unless you wouldn't mind walking. Thank you, parents and guardians, for attending. Carriages will be set aside for your transportation off the school grounds where you will be able to apparate home. For our non-magical attendees, you will be escorted by a Ministry representative just as you arrived here. I won't keep you any longer, congratulate your children and enjoy the rest of your time here."
"Ron don't be ridiculous," Hermione interrupted Harry. "He has to spend time with him for his tutoring and being friendly isn't a bad thing."
"I want to travel," Malfoy shrugged. "If I'm careful about how I deal with my father's frozen accounts I shouldn't have to work at all."
"Funny that," Harry turned adjusted himself to face Draco, propping himself up with one elbow and draping his other arm over the pale boy's chest.
"I need to talk to you, or Hermione will probably kill me," Harry shrugged. Justin placed his toothbrush in the cup on the counter with his initials on it and walked out into the dorm room.
"Arresto Momentum!" Malfoy shouted. The ball slowed as it landed in the Slytherin's hands. "You're going to have to change up your strategy, Potter. You're getting lazy."
' respectively in a delicate cursive print. Harry looked to the bed beside his, the one closest to the wall. He tilted his head to see the name and his face turned white as his eyes landed on the jade snake, coiled around itself with its head held high and the cursive name printed beneath it '
He sipped a goblet of pumpkin juice and ate a slice of buttered toast while the post came swooping in. Unexpectedly, a large package was dropped in front of Harry as the breakfast was cleared. From the shape of the object, he already knew what it was. He and Ron shared a look of excitement before rushing back to the Eighth year dorm with it leaving Hermione with Ginny.
"He's been doing that for the past eighteen years!" Ron called out, turning the snickers into outright laughs. Harry looked down to the stone floor as to hide his bright red face and he dropped his arm from Parvati.
"This is nothing to be sorry about, I understand that your accident opened wounds that were not yet fully healed and all that progress we've made has been wiped away."
"After dinner in the common room," Malfoy shook his head with a smile still lingering on his lips. "If you're late I'll hex all your socks to bite you."
Harry arrived in the common room with his potions things and sat at a two-chair desk. Looking around the room, he could not see Malfoy. He chuckled to himself about how Draco had such little faith that he'd be on time yet was late himself.
"Did you even tell him where to meet us?" Hermione asked. Harry stopped in his tracks and groaned in realisation at the crucial detail he left out of his letter.
"He's alright now," Harry tried to defend Malfoy, something he never thought he'd do. "He's a lot more mature than what he used to be."
"At least I get to escape this hell hole of a dorm room," Terry muttered, clearly intending to be loud enough for the entire room to hear.
"Potter, Granger." Draco's voice appeared behind the two. Harry turned to face him and for a second he wondered how he somehow moved from one place to another before his brain caught up to the reality of magic. He smiled, he loved magic.
"Yes, I did," Harry shook his head. "You are not what they think you are. And if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing people of who you really are, so be it."
"Draco, what are you doing?" Harry whispered into the Slytherin's hair, not on purpose, of course, their distance made it impossible not too. He tried to look around the common room self-consciously. There wasn't many people around but the ones that were happened to be too focused into their schoolwork to notice them.
"It's a bit weird," Ron mused as he sat with Harry in what used to be their favourite armchairs. "Being back here, you know?"
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably from foot to foot. As no one spoke up to break what was becoming an increasingly awkward silence.
He could think of a million better things to do than being here in the brisk November air waiting for Malfoy. He could be playing Wizard's Chess with Ron or finishing his Transfiguration homework to name a couple.
"Malfoy, Draco. Outstanding in Arithmancy, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions and Transfiguration. Exceeds Expectations in Charms and History of Magic."
He was almost deaf to the cheers of the crowd as he stared in disbelief at the dormant snitch that lay in the palm of his hand. His chest heaved, struggling for air after the physical stress he had been under.
Draco caught Harry looking at him and smirked before giving him an over exaggerated wink to which Harry rolled his eyes and turned away but could still see the Slytherin in the mirror's reflection.
Draco sat by the end of Harry's bed and waved his wand silently and flicked it so a small light appeared.
Draco said nothing after that. Harry noticed how thin Draco really was as he rested his hand on the other boy's thigh inside the jacket. He noted how Draco was sitting so stiffly and wished he would relax into him. Harry, again, assumed it was because he was cold and decided to rest his head on Draco's shoulder and into his scarf.
"I'll be outside the door," Draco assured. Harry turned the handle and went inside before poking his head back out again.
"Potter I am amazed at how you even passed you O.W.Ls with note taking of this calibre," said Malfoy. "Were you even paying attention?"
. Was Draco gay? Harry weighed the evidence in his head. Draco had never had a girlfriend that anyone knew of, he did have a great sense of fashion and kept himself well groomed. Surely that wasn't conclusive evidence. He couldn't just ask him either. That sort of question is way too personal and Harry didn't want to offend Draco.
"No!" Said Harry far too quickly for his liking. He saw Draco's lips twitch into a smirk and a wave of embarrassment swept over him.
"Well, I decline," Aberforth went back to cleaning the bar. Draco turned to leave but Harry grabbed his wrist.
The store was bustling with Hogwarts students, especially third years and it took the Eighth-years a while before being able to leave with their own brown paper bag of sweets.
The Ravenclaw seeker hung in the air beside him, clapping solemnly in defeat as the rambunctious Gryffindor team all descended around Harry, cheering along with the crowd.
Harry never once argued. The bell soon rang for the final class of the day and the three of them packed their things for Charms.
"I'm sorry about Ron," said Harry in a quiet voice. "He just needs some time to come around to you."
Few people turned their heads at Malfoy's arrival. The Gryffindor scarf resting on his shoulders camouflaged him to those who were not already looking in their direction.
He began running drills focused on the chaser position but he found most of the applicants bull-headed and seemed to just have shown up to get a glimpse of him. He had Ron play keeper as three at a time Harry assessed how willing they were to cooperate as a team and if they could actually get a quaffle past Weasley.
Harry had two slices of toast the next morning feeling considerably more hungry after not having dinner the previous night. The familiar swooping of owls delivering the morning post arrived in feathery style, amazing the first years who stared up in awe. Hermione had immediately stuck her head into the Daily Prophet and Ron had received a skiving snack box from his brother and successfully hid it from his suspicious girlfriend.
"Accio Quaffle!" Harry pointed his wand at the broom shed. A small red ball flew out the open doors toward him, he tucked his wand up his sleeve just in time to catch the Quaffle with both hands.
Neville had caught up with them and was conversing with Hermione about the theory of Switching spells which he could just not understand. Harry and Ron stood on either side of the two of them, silent and looking ahead. Harry was in no mood to grovel to Ron, he believed that his apology was enough, he was here for Hermione. He knew in the back of his head that they were both right about his lack of subtlety in ditching the two of them to go flying with Malfoy, but it was just a onetime thing. He wasn't going to become Malfoy's best buddy and spend all his time around him. He was just tired of school work and he needed a break. That is, at least, what he was telling himself.
"I don't need an apology, I was already awake," said Draco, leaning back on one of the poles of Harry's bed cautiously.
"I assume he was unaware that you cannot use the pitch if it is reserved!" Ron crossed his arms. "Why are you still here?!"
It had barely been an hour till Ron came bursting through the common room doors at full speed, looking around wildly.
His seeker's reflexes kicked in and he raced after the golden snitch, dodging passed Demelza and Dennis and under one of the Slytherin beaters.
"Yes," he admitted, walking over to her and sitting on the desk next to her to have a conversation face to face. "It's true."
"Uh, I'd like to thank the best team in the school," said Harry, an echo of cheers filled the room. "All the hard work put in over every training period and any free time paid off for the win!"
"Maybe that would have earned some praise back in the Slytherin common room but here, you've got to remember who you're talking to," Harry nodded in Ron's direction. "He'd do almost anything to have what you have:"
The edges of his vision darkened and pulsed. The voices and sounds around him became harder to hear, becoming drowned out by strange noises ringing in his head.
With a flick of her wand, the tables lined themselves with food and music began playing from somewhere Harry could not see.
"You have the face," said Draco. Harry wondered if he expected him to understand what that meant. "The face you make when you're having an emotion," Draco rolled his eyes as he made his way over to his bed, planting himself right in the middle. "I refuse to tutor you if you're going to be depressed the whole time. Out with it, what's wrong?"
Showered and dressed in jeans and his Gryffindor jumper, Ginny Weasley invited Harry to the Gryffindor common room for a victorious after-party, telling Ron about it as an after-thought.
"Ooh, so the rumours are true," he smiled. After eight years of rumours, Harry still groaned and rolled his eyes. "That's exciting."
"Do you think I should get it cut?" Draco asked. "I can't decide if I actually like it this long or not." He twisted a finger through the hair at the base of his neck thoughtfully.
"It's okay," Harry says in a quiet voice, not wishing to aggravate him further. "Why didn't you do it on the Mark?"
The initial shock of Malfoy's sudden appearance seemed to wear off after several minutes. Usual conversation resumed and Harry began to dig into his dinner. He kept glancing at Malfoy, attempting to decipher his body language in order to discern whether he was okay.
"Well, if I had my wand and I happen to accidentally use it on an insolent little weasel like yourself, it's not just me who would get in trouble. You would be aiding in the resist of my arrest!"
Ginny pushes past the other students and into the common room and then presumably up to her dormitory to compose the letter.
Draco didn't say anything but Harry watched as his barriers drew up behind his eyes and he smirked. "You're such a dork. Obviously, I'll be your boyfriend, Potter."
"I can't believe it's finally here," said Neville as he tripped over a shoe he had left by his bead. "Nineteen Ninety-Nine. We're actually graduating!"
"Dumbledore," said Harry as the gargoyle that guarded McGonagall's office looked at him expectantly.
"Yeah, you keep reminding me," Ron sat on his bed and leant on the side of the desk. "But are you going to actually tell me?"
Basically, Harry had a freaky ass nightmare about Voldy and Draco was there. He woke up and found Draco in the common room being a tad emo in front of the fire. They talk about life and Draco reluctantly shows him his self harm after his sleeve falls a little and Harry sees a little bit of it. Harry does try to comfort him but Draco is like 'yeah right'
Over the summer Harry's affections toward Ginny had almost been extinguished. Yes, she was very pretty, and she was always there with a mug of hot chocolate for him. His overwhelming guilt and depression had overshadowed that.
The image of his brother's face as he lay dead in the Great Hall flashed across Harry's mind, the sight of the underage boy who died because of him etched into his brain forever.
"Six thirty-ish," Harry rolled back to face Draco who was now a lot closer than he remembered. Something was up with Malfoy, why was he acting in such a vulnerable manner?
Draco reached out to touch the corporeal beast but it disintegrated as his fingers ran along its side.
Draco stepped past Harry with no word to him. He stood very still for a few seconds before brandishing his wand. "Expecto Patronum."
Harry used every ounce of his energy to push himself forward and beyond Summerby's grasp. He was quite a bit taller than the Hufflepuff fourth year but in no way did that impede the seeker in his attempt to win. But in the end, it was Harry who wrapped a single finger around the delicate silver wing of the snitch, causing it to fall still as it hung between two of Harry's fingers.
Harry joined Ron, Hermione and Neville in a couple of armchairs by the fire discussing what they were planning to do when they left Hogwarts.
"I'm good to go," he struggled with a smile as much as he could. He suddenly felt very underdressed standing across the table from Malfoy in his smart attire when Harry was wearing dirty sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a maroon jacket. Draco also seemed to notice his underwhelming outfit, looking him up and down, clearly unimpressed.
As expected both Ron and Hermione jump back (with a small squeal on Ron's side) as the black leathery Thestrals came into view. Harry heard Hermione muttering under her breath about how fascinating they were but he chose to ignore her.
An eternity seemed to pass before the large doors of the Great Hall opened, signalling for everyone to make their way down to the river.
"Potter!" Yelled Draco, grabbing Harry's wrist and pulling it away from the desk. "I doubt the potion calls for your blood."
"Are you two quite done?" Hermione sighed, getting to her feet and heading toward the door. "I'm going to spend my afternoon with the more civilised members of this household. If the two of you would like to have a conversation that doesn't include arguing about Draco bloody Malfoy, you can come to get me then."
Harry didn't say anything in return while he followed the Slytherin boy, staring at the back of his head.
Harry felt a horrible blush rise in his cheeks as he heard the snickers from his peers, especially Draco behind him.
Soon even Harry joined in cheering the other students on as they sent their spells at the dummies, a deep breath of normalcy flooded his body and for a while he was not lingering in the past, but rather living in the moment. Neville had produced a spectacular impedimenta jinx and a Hufflepuff seventh year performed a blasting curse that disintegrated her dummy and a nearby table. The energy in the room was exhilarating.
The names continued. Ginny seemed very pleased with herself upon hearing she had received two more Outstanding N.E.W.Ts than her brother. Soon Brian Yellowbird returned to his seat and the hall became silent again.
Harry knew that he shouldn't tell Ron. Draco had opened up to him in confidence about his troubles. But he also knew that for Ron to trust him he had to tell him.
Harry only nibbled one slice of marmite toast and half an apple at breakfast which Hermione scolded him for wasting. First up, they had transfiguration which Harry wasn't too excited for but at least he didn't have to bear the sight of Malfoy until last period according to their new timetable.
Harry sat next to his best friend and pulled out the last remaining empty chair for Malfoy. He studied at Arthur's unsure expression as the son of the man who despised him and his family sat at his table next to him silently, fully aware of all the eyes upon him.
Draco placed a hand on his son's shoulder and Harry crouched down so that Regulus' face was slightly above his own. Regulus was a splitting image of his father, they had planned it this way. With the help of a surrogate, Draco fathered their first son and Harry their second. Lily was not theirs, however. They had previously decided they only wanted two kids but upon meeting the beautiful orphan girl they fell in love with her instantly, Harry couldn't let this child grow up without loving parents as he did.
But then he turned to face him, and Harry's complexion turned as white as the ghost in front of his body.
"Oh, and Potter?" McGonagall called just as he reached the door. He turned to face her. "Please make an effort to eat something, we can't have our star seeker off his game."
They left quietly, Draco making sure no one important was watching them. They walked in silence in the direction of the Eighth year's wing, Harry heard Draco huff in disgust every time they passed a couple making out against the wall. Harry smiled to himself at this and nudged him a little.
"Last time I checked, you weren't the captain Weasley!" Park scoffed. "What? Does little Potter need his friends to speak for him?"
Harry took a deep breath in and took his mind to the Burrow where his body, and Draco's, would duly follow.
Ernie Macmillan snatched the box out of thin air and leant back on Justin Finch-Fletchley, who apparently was his boyfriend.
It was clear that Hermione was mostly angry at him for abandoning their free period of study. When Ron had dragged him by the back of his robes all the way to the Eighth Year common room she had lectured him about the importance of their N.E.W.Ts and how abandoning his friends was a dick move. Harry had listened to her words his head hung low. Ron, who was standing beside her, was intent to make this all about Malfoy. He yelled at him, exclaiming that the Serpent was getting inside his head, feigning the act of the innocent before taking advantage of Harry.
After five minutes of Hermione glaring at him from the opposite couch, Harry finally got to his feet and walked over to the desk where Draco Malfoy was studying alone.
Harry thought on this for a moment and realised that Ron was right. He popped a bean into his mouth.
Draco waved. He was wearing a Gryffindor scarf and pretending to be miserable. The sentiment almost distracted him from catching the Hufflepuff seeker darting toward the ground. Almost.
On their arrival, they could not see Draco in the vicinity so they took a seat together on a metal bench facing the brick wall where four times a year, magical teenagers poured in and out.
"Potter, Weasley!" A voice shouted from the ground. It was Draco Malfoy, hands in his coat pockets and Nimbus 2001 held between his elbow and his waist.
"Oh, Harry!" Hermione got his attention as she threw a small box of Peppermint toads at him. "I got you those because you didn't request anything. Also, a third year told me that there is someone to see you outside."
"No, tell me. Was it them again?" Harry asked, reaching out to Malfoy's arm. He pulls himself away and jumps to his feet away from him.
"Oh, Mr Potter," she seemed surprised that he had approached her. "It's a pleasure to meet you properly. I have to thank you so deeply for what you have done for me, and my son."
"I didn't think about it like that," Harry pondered this for a minute. Did Draco really ask him out on a date?
Harry took his usual seat near the back of the classroom with Ron and Hermione as Professor began her lesson on the unforgivable curses, something that the whole class had already been taught during their fourth (or third) year by Bartimous Crouch Jr who disguised himself as the Auror, Alastor Moody.
"This is the match that will decide our fate!" Harry bellowed, standing atop a wooden bench in the Gryffindor team room. He looked at all his teammates dressed in their scarlet and gold robes, a sight he would be seeing for the very last time. "If we win today's game by at least fifty points Gryffindor will win the Quidditch cup!"
The crowd begin to disperse soon enough, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione on the landing in front of the portrait. The three stared in disbelief at Fred who was very amused at this reaction.
"I don't want sorry," Ron finally looked at him, fire in his eyes. "I want you to promise me, right here, right now. I want you to promise me, and Hermione, and Neville bloody Longbottom for that matter, that Malfoy will never pull you away from us. He will never, ever, distract you from what matters. Us."
"Put a little pep in your step, would you? I can't work with your depressing attitude," Draco rolled his eyes.
"I'm not sure it would be such a good idea," Harry looked down along the Gryffindor table. "And I'm sure he'd agree."
Potions was a tragic mishap for Harry. He has forgotten how easy it was with Snape's old textbook and even with Hermione whispering in his ear that he had to add the porcupine quills slowly as he stirred the cauldron, his concoction ended up an off-white instead of bright purple.
He managed to get all the right buttons into the right holes, save for the top which he left undone for now. He looked at his outfit in the mirror as he tucked the shirt into his pants. It was quite simple for the most part; no ruffles, no lines. But the golden buttons and belt buckle caught the light perfectly. He glanced to the long jacket on his bed, black but hardly simple. A single line of golden thread swirled across the surface of the fabric creating a beautiful storm of colour that remained intricate without becoming an eyesore.
"I know," Harry huffed. He leant over to grab some toast but as soon as he picked it up it disappeared from his hands. He frowned. He tried to grab an apple from the fruit basket but that too vanished from his grasp.
"That's not what this says," Draco tapped two fingers against his sleeve where underneath sat the Dark Mark.
"That's all very well but I had someone else in mind," she informed him. Harry frowned. "As a senior member of the school I want you to set an example for the younger years in my efforts to break down these silly boundaries between our houses."
It was an accident, that's what Harry told himself anyway, when his own green eyes darted down to Draco's pale lips and back up to his eyes.
"Well, now that they're here I think we can begin dinner," Hermione cut through the silence of the room, taking a seat next to Ron at the table who was glaring at Malfoy. Mrs Weasley collected herself and nodded in agreement, flicking her wand and causing the lids of the pots on the table runner to lift off and pile themselves in the sink.
"You know McGonagall will take you off the Quidditch team if she finds out you skip breakfast or dinner," Draco folded his arms across his chest.
"It's a figure of speech," Malfoy grumbled, placing his left elbow on the arm of his chair and resting his head on his fist.
"Mr Potter?" Harry looked up to see Professor Slughorn clasping a piece of parchment in his manicured hands. "It's good to see you returning to your previous standard, perhaps Mr Malfoy's tutoring is paying off." He places the parchment down in front of Harry before returning to his desk at the front of the room.
"Can we not make this a big deal," Harry looked around hurriedly, thankfully Ron's raise in voice didn't attract any attention.
From the embarrassed look on Draco's face, the blank reactions of the people around him were not what he was expecting.
"Mhmm," Harry folded the parchment carefully before Ron snatched it away from him. "Your disdain is duly noted."
"Outside, yeah, but at school, he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love," James rolled his eyes "I'm sure he was flattered enough when he met Reg." Shaking his head at his aunt, who technically wasn't really his aunt, he vented his feeling by aiming a kick at Regulus. "See you later Reg, watch out for the Thestrals."
"You're getting slow, Malfoy!" Harry teased as he flew beneath Draco and grabbed the snitch out of the air.
The day past sleepily, nobody was really present in their classes, everybody daydreaming about going home that weekend.
"It's going to be weird not having to deal some life threatening nonsense this year," Ron mused earning him a glare from his girlfriend for his bad grammar. Harry just grunted in reply. He hadn't slept well last night, leaving him drowsy and with a dull headache. Images of the crumbling and broken walls of Hogwarts swamped his mind, the lifeless bodies of those who fell victim to his own failings strewn amongst the debris. Ron's bedroom wall was a much preferred sight to his nightmares.
"Morning Weasley, Granger," Draco paused. "Potter." Draco was wearing what could only be described as his 'casual' attire. Long sleeve shirt buttoned all the way with smart pants and sensible shoes, all in black of course.
Harry mouthed the word to feel it on his tongue. "Bisexual," he said out loud. "Thank you, Justin. You've been a lot of help."
"Is that a challenge, Malfoy?" Harry lifted his arm above Draco's head to twirl him around, causing him to let out a repressed sort of giggle. This did not go unnoticed by the group ahead, who turned and looked suspiciously at the two boys before going back to their own business.
"What are you up to? Didn't you think we'd notice you slipping away from the feast? Why's that? Are you gonna do dark magic to bring You-Know-Who back? Or is it just because you don't have any friends?" Another boy teased.
It was Tuesday afternoon and Harry was already confident in saying that the next two weeks were going to be the worst of his life. The N.E.W.T exams were definitely living up to their name. Harry has just come out of the Herbology practical exam and yesterday he sat his Charms exams.
It had grown a lot over the past year, at the back of his head, the strands were almost reaching the base of his neck and Harry took the pleasure of sinking his fingers into it, it was as if he was holding on for dear life.
"Every so often," Draco was clearly getting annoyed with him, but kept his tone at a condescending monotone. "Nothing but a wisp of smoke."
"What?!" Ron groaned. Charlie shot him a warning glance which shut the youngest Weasley boy up instantly.
Draco took no hesitation in retreating away from Harry's touch and onto what had been the black haired boy's bed for the past few days. Draco leant against the wall, never ceasing his glare at Harry who was feeling all too confident for his liking.
McGonagall snapped her fingers and Harry looked back at her. He stole a glance at Draco and he looked as flustered as he felt.
"By what he learned over the past seven years, are you possibly referring to how you groomed him to die?" The familiar sneer of Professor Snape entered the conversation as he reappeared in his frame.
"Tomorrow, I understand you share a free period. I want the two of you to go down to the Quidditch pitch and... resolve your differences."
"A broken radius and a dislocated shoulder. Fixed in a jiffy. But what I'm more concerned about is how you fell, Mr Potter," the nurse eyed him over a clipboard. Harry opened his mouth to reply but she gestured with her hand to silently tell him not to. "Fatigue, dizziness, loss of body mass. I've been a nurse long enough to know the symptoms of under-eating." She said accusingly.
Harry could not remember when exactly they had made this 'pact'. Harry assumed he was joking, or rather hoped.
He said it was mostly Neville and Luna who snuck into the forest, often during their Care of Magical Creatures lessons who kept him posted on the happenings inside the school.
Harry finally got to see the parchment. It was his latest Potion's essay, marked with a large 'E' circled in green ink.
"Maybe I need more tuition," said Harry cautiously. He just wanted to keep the conversation alive, but he knew how strange that sounded. Malfoy stopped what he was doing and looked at him with his eyebrows furrowed.
"Firs' years over here, come on don't be shy," the familiar voice made Harry's head snap up and a smile ghost over his lips as his eyes landed on the tall figure of Rubeus Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts. Hagrid saw the three students and gave them a wave before going beck to rounding up all the frightened first years.
Harry could no longer recall what had happened from that point, he simply rolled onto his side and stared at the wall beyond Malfoy's still empty bed.
"Many guests from the Ministry of Magic, as well as international representatives, will be in attendance so I ask that you will be appropriately dressed and on your utmost professional behaviour. More details will be posted on the common rooms' notice boards. That is all."
There were a few other students who had taken the day to sit outside. Clumps of students talking, studying, and enjoying the air dotted the lawn. However, none of them were in earshot of the odd pair.
Harry forgot about school, he forgot about Malfoy, he forgot about the war, he forgot about his exams and he forgot about the whispers in his mind. The Weasleys were the family he never had.
Neville pointed his wand to the opposite side of the room to the first bed by the door with an ornate yellow and black badger adorning the wall behind it.
Last night was the End of Term feast, Gryffindor was crowned the victors of the House Cup and they were sure to celebrate it in traditional Gryffindor fashion.
"Parked all right then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you. She thought I'd have to Confund the examiner."
Again, Harry waited for Draco's nasty remark but he refrained. Harry smiled softly at him as Ginny threw him a Cleansweep.
"Don't mention it, please don't talk. If you keep talking I'm probably going to cry again," Draco rubbed his eyes with his sleeve.
"Filch is letting the first couple of people leave if you're ready," Draco pointed toward the entrance hall.
Draco Malfoy was lying deathly pale (more than usual). He was nowhere near as disfigured as the last time he was here, perhaps he had even defended himself.
"Are you okay?" Malfoy whispered. Harry did not register the question until Draco nudged him with his elbow.
"Nonsense, have some more!" A large serving of the meal neatly carried itself to Harry's plate without a drop of sauce hitting the wooden table. Harry sighed. This confirmed that McGonagall had written to Molly about his, problem. Harry reluctantly picked up his fork. He knew he had to make an attempt, even though his stomach was protesting at the idea because Mrs Weasley would only push the matter further.
"I've been almost sure for about a week but if I think about it, ever since he started opening up I haven't been able to help myself being a little interested," Harry admitted.
It was after ten more tedious minutes of this in which Harry only wrote another hundred or so words when Hermione kicked him in the shin. He looked up at her, obviously annoyed but she simply nodded in the direction of the boy's dorm. There, Justin Finch-Fletchley had obviously decided that he was done for the night and was heading up to bed.
This caused some murmurs across the hall. Harry felt conflicted, on one hand he knew that reuniting with his old dormitory would bring a comfortingly sense of nostalgia, while also bringing back hoards of unsavoury memories to the front of his mind. Ron and Hermione shared looks with the other eighth years around them.
Their plans, however, were brutally disrupted by Hermione bursting into the common room declaring that they were meant to meet her at the Quidditch pitch after tryouts to visit Hagrid.
"Harry's acting like a child so McGonagall is treating him like one," Ron elbowed his best friend in the ribs. "A little packed lunch for every meal."
"Stop distracting me, Potter," he said. Harry knew that arguing would be futile so made no attempt to dispute him other than the slight raise of an eyebrow. "You didn't go down to lunch today."
"Go on, get going the lot of youse. Don't want you three holdin' up the train," Hagrid smiled, Harry could've sworn a single fat tear rolled down his cheek.
"Why would you even say that?" Harry scoffed. "Malfoy has changed but he will never come before you. Any of you."
"Merlin, Harry, sometimes I forget you know absolutely nothing," said Ron. He pointed to the two students and older witch in the least subtle way. "They're from Ilvermorny, the American wizard school."
In his visual search, his eyes landed in the stands where he picked out Hermione, Draco and Neville all cheering for him.
After a lap or two, the team made their descent. Harry dismounted his broom and walked to the centre of the field to meet the Ravenclaw captain, Victoria Smith.
"Whatever you say," said Harry before craning his neck to plant a small kiss on Draco's lips. "What was the happy memory that finally did it."
Harry couldn't complain. He couldn't even think. All reasonable thought disapparated from his mind. His hands left Draco's waist and travelled up into his white-blonde hair.
"How are you feeling today, Potter?" McGonagall smiled at him. Harry shrugged, nibbling a white chocolate chip biscuit from a plate on the Headmistress' desk.
Harry nodded and looked at the floor. Hermione nudged his arm and signalled that they should go before Filch does his rounds. It took a while to tear Ron from his recently departed brother but together they headed to the Eighth year's wing. Harry wasn't sure if seeing Fred had made him feel better or just worse.
He and Hermione walked on either side of the Gryffindor table till they met at the end. Hermione grabbed Harry's arm and dragged him out into the corridor and in the direction of the Eighth year wing.
Harry looked across the room to Ron and Hermione who were snickering as Draco pulled him toward the boy's dorm.
"That wasn't exactly his choice," said Harry. "He didn't know any better, and when he did, he was forced to do all those things."
"I think you should stay away from things you don't understand," said Harry, making eye contact with Malfoy. "Go on, go back to the Great Hall." None of them moved. "Now!"
"Slughorn explained it like this; the potion at that stage was very unstable, the small splash on your hand sent you into a fit where it forced you to relive all of you darkest memories and then manipulated them to attack you. Thankfully the antidote was easy enough to throw together and Madame Pomfrey gave you a dose of Dreamless sleep."
"Well, easy test, did you become my boyfriend because I was there? A distraction? Because you were bored?" Her voice was shaky as she spoke and Harry's heart broke for her.
"Nope, don't care," Harry laughed, releasing the snitch from his grip and it flew off. Draco shot off after it with Harry following close behind him.
"Hey, Justin," he said nervously. The Hufflepuff looked in his direction with his toothbrush in his mouth, a small amount of toothpaste dripping over his lip.
For the first time in the last eight years of Harry's life, he really didn't want to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The two could have sat like this for mere seconds or even hours, time had ceased to exist in Harry's mind.
"I tried to tell him not to go," Dennis said quietly. "He told Mum he was going to one of our muggle friend's houses but he told me what was happening here and that he was going to fight. He showed me the Galleon, the one from the DA. I had lost mine. He said he'd be back before Mum and Dad found out," he wiped his face on his sleeve, determined not to cry.
"Thanks," Harry muttered. "It's just, nobody understands. I have caused so much pain for not just myself but so many other people. I gave up after the war, I really did. It's like, my brain couldn't function."
"Uh, thank you, Professor," Harry nodded, looking at his scuffed shoes. "It was mostly luck really."
"I'm fine," Harry cut her off in a calm voice. He wasn't crazy. He knew that if nothing else. Madame Pomfrey didn't attempt to press the issue any further. Harry watched her as she made her way to the bad to his left, curtains drawn around it so visitors, and Harry, could not pry at the student inside.
They both looked to the overexcited owl in its cage across the room before looking back to each other.
The doors flew open and each team member scrambled for their brooms. In a triangle formation, they flew onto the pitch to the sound of cheers from the half of the stands dressed in red and gold.
The look on his face warmed Harry's heart so deeply that he completely forgot about his anger. He smiled as Draco raised a hand to his mouth, his grey eyes threatening to spill tears.
"Don't tell me you're also going to be a stuffy ministry man too," George scoffed at his younger brother which earned him a punch in the shoulder
"Well, before I knew I was a wizard, I didn't have an attempt on my life every five seconds," Harry snapped.
"He didn't know any better, he was just a kid brought up with a different view of the world than us," Harry calculated his words very carefully. "And he, you know. Hurts himself," Harry rubbed his left wrist.
"Sleep well everyone, and wake up nice and early for classes tomorrow. Prefects, come get your passwords from me and lead your houses to the common rooms, eighth years, stay behind please."
"I don't know, it just sort of happened, I didn't plan it. It's just been a lot harder to do anything lately."
"Yeah sure," Harry looked back to his friends hesitantly. Hermione was motioning for him to go while Ron was glaring at Malfoy, great signals.
"So are you going to tell him why he's an idiot?" Ron asked desperately. "I don't care, obviously, that you like guys. But...
Harry looked at Draco, and Draco was looking at him. He could not tell what the blonde boy was thinking, it was like Draco was trying to understand how he worked. This made Harry uncomfortable, so he scowled and looked back to McGonagall.
He dashed back over to Ron's bedside and shook him awake. In the Weasley household, if you wanted the best serve of breakfast and you wanted it hot, you had to get there first.
"I'm going to go find him before he does anything stupid." Harry took his own coat and sneakers and left Ron alone.
Harry placed his hands on Draco's chest for support as Draco flicked his tongue across Harry's bottom lip. He couldn't help but let his lips part and Draco's tongue entered his mouth.
On their way to the dungeons, the two spotted Madame Hooch, the Quidditch coach and new Head of Gryffindor house. They told her the news of Harry's new broom and continuation of his captaincy. She, of course, was ecstatic and couldn't wait for tryouts. She tossed Ron the key to the Quidditch shed as they were about to head into the depths of the castle so they could toss a quaffle about while breaking in the new broom.
Harry sat at the Gryffindor table and looked around for that all too familiar box. Ron sat beside him and grabbed a bowl and began to ladle some soup from one of the large bowls in the middle of the table.
"An outing between one probably gay guy and one straight guy with gay feelings for the first guy," Ron raised an eyebrow.
Harry watched as Malfoy showed up to breakfast late on Monday morning. He wanted to talk to him but he knew with Ron by his side so soon after their fight that he could only watch the boy from the other side of the Great Hall.
"I never thought I'd say this but I am so relieved for these holidays to be over," Ron leant on the window.
Harry saw something he never thought he'd see in Draco Malfoy's eyes. Tears, threatening to spill over but the blonde haired boy refused to let the weakness show.
They landed softly on the grass and Harry tucked the snitch inside the pocket of his jacket. With their brooms tucked under their arms, Draco led Harry to an old tree by the stadium and sat at its roots, leaning against the sturdy trunk.
He spotted him in the far corner, talking with his mother quietly. It was evident that the other guests and even the students were glaring at the two of them, keeping their distance warily.
Double potions on Monday morning got off to an awkward start. Harry replied to all of Malfoy's inquiries with single worded answers. He could tell that Draco was becoming increasingly more frustrated with him like he had every potions lesson since, the incident.
"Perhaps after spending the holidays with us he realised that not all Mudbloods are that bad," Hermione laughed.
McGonagall had confirmed Harry's fears that he would have to speak to some of the guests so Hermione and Draco helped him pick out some handsome new robes so he would look somewhat presentable.
The seventh and eighth year Gryffindor and Ravenclaw students headed down to the Transfiguration corridor to be greeted by a young witch with dirty blonde hair twisted up into a messy bun. She ushered them inside and Harry took his seat with Ron on his left and Hermione to his right.
Until Ron gripped Harry's shoulder and pointed it out, he did not even notice the unfamiliar incorporeal figure of a ghost who was entertaining a group of second years.
He made his way down the wooden stairs, making sure they creaked as little as possible under his weight.
"It's me. She hates me, also you probably, she hates nearly everyone," Draco explained. "She's making a point, using you because she knows it'll hurt me the most."
He pondered this for a second. Was he really just there for Malfoy. The blonde-haired boy was a few feet in front of him, humming the tune to a song Harry couldn't recognise. Did he consider Malfoy a friend now? He wasn't sure. There was just something about him that intrigued Harry. Was it his dark past? His hidden but genuinely caring personality. His troubled present? His uncertain future? Or maybe something else entirely., something Harry could not put his finger on. He simply felt the need to be with Malfoy as much as he could. To watch out for him, to protect him. And maybe even to let him protect Harry.
"Avada Kedavra!" Voldemort shouted. With a burst of green light everyone fell to the ground dead. Harry tried to scream but no sound would emerge from his throat. He turned to face Voldemort again, but this time Draco Malfoy was standing by his side with his wand raised. "Do it, Draco," Voldemort hissed. "Kill him."
The two figures stopped and descended in front of the team. The Harry's stomach plummeted when he saw that the intruders were Draco and Chloe Park, Slytherin's official and reserve seekers.
"That's not up to you," Hermione shook her head. "I don't want to baby you Harry but you're acting like a child."
"I'm so glad you came, Mal- Draco," Hermione smiled, Ron stared at her, mouth agape as if she had said something so incredibly controversial.
Walking out of the dungeons on the Friday afternoon, the two week's of N.E.W.T examinations over, Harry breathed a unanimous sigh of relief with every other seventh and eighth-year student also exiting the Potions classrooms.
"You just forgot one thing, however," said Draco. Harry's eyes opened and looked down at the boy who still had not moved, his eyes still closed as well. "Are you going to ask me to be your date to the ball?"
"I haven't done anything all year." Draco glared at Ron, balling his hands into fists. "If I had my wand I'd teach you a lesson about disrespect-"
"Friends is fine," said Ron defeatedly as Harry took Pig to the window. "But don't expect me to get all cozy with him."
Harry received a scarlet sweater from Molly, as he did every year. This one had a large '99' on the back with his last name above it. Ron Ginny and Hermione all got one too. George got him a package of various Wizard Wheezes merchandise, Ron gifted him a box of broom biscuits that flew around while you tried to eat them, Hermione bought him a study journal which he pretended to love, and an array of presents from the other Weasleys like socks and sweets.
"No, this is for your own safety Potter," said McGonagall firmly, she picked a package off the table next to his bed and gave it to him. "While you were unconscious you missed dinner. You can return to your dorm when you've finished it. Goodnight, Potter."
Harry's eyes widened. For a moment he couldn't tell what it was. A beast of some sort emerged from the tip of Draco's wand. Harry's took a second to adjust to the brilliant light in the room. A silvery Thestral trotted around the room, leaping gracefully over beds and shaking its beautiful head every so often. Draco turned his whole body as he watched it dance around him, he stumbled over himself as it brushed past him as if he could feel it.
"No, of course. And congratulations on your wonderful N.E.W.Ts. I'm sure your parents would be so proud."
He glanced down the row to see Ron and Ginny arguing quietly over something at one end, and at the other Hermione waiting patiently for the ceremony to start.
The team entered the common room, except for Harry, who remained rooted to the spot in complete shock at the simple but heart-stopping word.
Harry felt dread settle in his stomach when he glanced at the watch on his wrist and saw that it said that there were merely five minutes until the end of the day.
The air was chilly and the sky was overcast but this did not stop plenty of students, second through to seventh year, from coming down to the pitch to try out. There were many familiar faces in attendance but Harry tried to keep in mind that he needed to be strict and without favouritism, well, maybe not when it came to Ron.
What did snap Harry out of his blissful daydream was when they entered the Great Hall and Draco still did not leave his side as he made his way to the Gryffindor table. He looked at Draco strangely which caused him to shrug.
Harry was beginning to reach his breaking point and just elect Michael Timms, a chubby fourth year who almost fell off his broom while taking an impressive shot at the goal posts which Ron just barely missed. That was when another boy stepped up (figuratively, they were on brooms after all) and managed to weave his way in and out of the other chasers and score a goal to the cheers of the team.
He took his seat next to the blonde haired boy and decided that there wasn't enough time to start making his own notes. He leant towards Malfoy till their shoulders were a hair's breadth apart, his eyes scanning his notes made in his elegant penmanship. Harry noticed Draco's cologne for the first time, it was this that made Harry realise the two had never been so physically close. Harry had the sudden desire to know which brand of cologne that the Slytherin was wearing, he seemed intoxicated by it. He had never been so enraptured by such a masculine scent, he remembered the sweet and flowery fragrances that followed both Cho and Ginny around and how he had become infatuated by them, he tried to tell himself that this was not the same.
He grabbed Hermione's arm and pulled her off the bench toward the Slytherin who was looking around for him.
Malfoy threw the parchment at Harry who quickly picked up his bag and stepped well away from the angry Slytherin. He turned to leave but stopped himself just before he did.
"Well, I'm honestly not sure," Fred placed his translucent hands on his hips and sat on the balustrade. "I was doing a brilliant job of kicking some Death Eater's arse, and then I died, and then I was watching everyone else run around and my body being carried off. No one could see me at first which confused me, but slowly over the summer I've been able to make myself visible."
During lunch, Ron talked animatedly to Hermione about Harry's new broom while Harry pretended to look over his notes from that morning. His stomach growled in protest but he ignored it.
"I know. We've got potions next, I'm sure Malfoy won't mind me leaving the potion to him, lest I ruin it," Harry tried to lighten the conversation with humour. Ron didn't seem impressed.
"Hey!" Harry laughed but it was too late, Malfoy was clutching the snitch triumphantly above his head. He flew over to the blonde in defeat while Draco gloated terribly.
"Yeah, sounds perfect," Harry sighed in defeat. Malfoy seemed pretty happy with himself and pulled out his textbook and notes onto the table.
"Oh, I was beginning to worry you dreamt of me often, Potter," he said with a hint of the old Malfoy cockiness in his voic, clearly wanting to steer clear of any topic close to him and Voldemort.
The Burrow was more of a home to Harry than the Dursley's had ever been. It's whimsical quirks never failed to make Harry smile, no matter his mood. The sweet smell of gingerbread enticed Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to the kitchen where Mrs Weasley was waving her wand around the cozy kitchen, silently casting an array of household spells.
He watched Dobby die in his arms, he cried as he saw Fred's sold corpse on the floor of the Great Hall. He saw the life drain from Severus Snape's eyes and he lost consciousness as all his friends stood around him with tears in their eyes screaming one thing.
Hermione proceeded to drag Harry Potter across the school to the Hospital Wing with Ron following behind laughing his arse off. Many students stopped in their tracks as they watched the spectacle of bushy-haired Hermione Granger dragging the Chosen One down stone corridor after stone corridor as a mother would drag her moody toddler out of a toy store.
It was all his fault, if it wasn't for him, so many people would still be alive right now, his own parents included. It wasn't fair that Harry had come out the other side of the war, when so many better witches and wizards did not.
With a dramatic wink, Draco walked off again leaving Harry very confused and had to jog a few steps to catch up with him.
The Great Hall had been returned to its former glory over the summer. The night sky projected on the ceiling was a brilliant deep blue, decorated with all the shimmering stars in the heavens. The floating candles swayed gently out of reach as mischievous students tried to jump up and touch them. The four house tables stood proudly with individual coloured table runners continuing down the impossibly long tables.
The presence didn't speak, that was fine by Harry, he wasn't in the mood to speak. The silence continued and Harry could eliminate the suspects in his mind. Ron and Neville could not stand silence for this long, Terry was not the sentimental type and Justin and Ernie weren't likely o seperate on a day like this.
"Oh, shut it," Fred rolled his eyes. "We were going to have to give old Voldy a fight at some point. And anyway, it wasn't your fault. I could have been quicker with my wand work. Your grumbling isn't going to change the fact that I died."
Draco was already in the dorm room when Harry, Ron, and the rest of the Eighth year boys entered for their first night back after the Christmas break.
"Fair shout," Ron rolled his eyes. "Come on, Boot's going to notice that we've stolen his stuff," he said, referring to the blue and bronze tie he had tied around his head.
"Oh, I have the Weasleys," Harry forced a smile as he straightened his collar. "They'll always be looking out for me."
Then he was in the graveyard during the Triwizard Tournament, staring at Cedric's lifeless body as Voldemort sneered down at him.
Double transfiguration moved similarly as the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff students listened to Professor Larrowreed list every possible spell that may appear on their N.E.W.T exam.
Many students congratulated the team as they walked through the corridors, even some of the Slytherin team smiled at them as they headed in the opposite direction of the dungeons for the night.
"Without his father to run off to, I bet he's less likely to be picking fights with anyone," Harry added halfheartedly.
"Headmistress said she'll be with you soon, she just had to take care of something," the gargoyle said in a nonchalant tone. The door opened and Harry walked up the stairs cautiously, making his way into the room. He looked around and saw many new things since he was last there. McGonagall seemed to be a fan of simplistic interior design, hanging many white and gold tapestries around the room as well as furnishings that adhered to that colour scheme.
"Well, I'm sure you've decided on an excellent team. Now that I have stepped down from my position as Headmaster, I can officially say that I will be rooting for you," said Dumbledore. Harry shot a glance at Snape. 'Stepped down', more like murdered. Harry had to remind himself of the circumstances of his death. How it was all planned out to save Malfoy's innocence. He had to remind himself that he couldn't be angry at Snape who had to murder the man who had given him everything because it was him who had asked him to do it.
Neither of them said anything more for a while. Harry even felt himself slipping back into unconsciousness.
As usual, the sorting hat sung it's song, this one about new beginnings and friendship, and sorts the first years into the four houses. Harry's stomach gave a familiar grumble reminding him that he had passed up the sweets on the train and hadn't eaten anything since that slice of toast this morning.
Harry said nothing as Ron and Neville both ordered a mountain of food enthusiastically. Hermione left for the main crowd of students, almost regretting her offer.
Harry pushed through the other students in order to catch up to Draco ending up on the stone stairs before he could grasp the back of Draco's robes.
He made a dash for his slippers and his robe, pulling it around him to conserve the small amount of heat that he had. He headed to the door to make his way to the bathroom but as soon as he opened Ron's bedroom door the smell of bacon, eggs and toast filled his nostrils.
"You know, this is so much better than the Three Broomsticks," Neville nodded, looking around the slightly dingy pub. "It's way too noisy in there."
"Well, you have seen Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley lounging around the common room and dorm, practically on top of each other," Draco piled the beeswax into his hands.
"Enough already!" Hermione yelled, slamming her hand and her mug of Butterbeer down on the table. Neville let loose a little squeal, clearly realising he has just walked into something he did not know the backstory of. "For the last seven years, you two have been driving me insane! Ronald Bilius Weasley, Harry James Potter. Will the two of you look each other in the eye and talk!"
"The creature that 'haunted it' has... passed on," Harry felt a pain in his heart as he thought of Lupin. "It's just an old house now."
Harry grabbed his white shirt from the pile on his bed, tapping his wand to it lightly in order to remove the creases. He slipped his arms through the light material and checked in the mirror on the wall beside his bed that he was buttoning it right
"Of course," Draco replied, not looking up from his book. "Though bear in mind that now I know of its existence and know it's whereabouts, I may be borrowing it."
"I said leave it!" Malfoy growled. "I do not need your help! I do not need perfect Potter to come to save me! I can handle my problems by myself believe it or not!"
"Obviously," said Draco, "But I think you're going to be occupied for a little while." He nodded behind Harry who turned to see Professor McGonagall heading his way.
The other two young people and their aging supervisor were in fact from the American wizarding school as Ron and Draco had pointed out. The Head boy and girl were eager to chat to him but Harry only spluttered out few syllable answers in a monotone voice.
"Oh;" Harry snickered. "That is kind of old news now. But no, Malfoy and I had a discussion about it and came to the conclusion that some people exist to cause trouble."
The blonde haired boy collected himself, rubbing his hand across his eyes quickly and turning back to Harry. "See, easy."
Harry needed to catch Draco while the two of them were alone, perhaps on the way to potions later, surely it would be easy enough to shake off Ron and Hermione for a few minutes.
"No!" Harry yelled, jabbing the him in the stomach to make him double over, grabbing the parchment from his hand. He picked his wand up from the stretcher bed and tapped the parchment lightly with it so a thin ribbon snaked out of it and around the letter as he rolled it into a cylinder. The ribbon tied itself off in a neat bow and left a little for Harry to tie to Pig's leg when he opened the cage.
Hermione didn't say anything but grabbed his hand and she apparated them to the station as she was, like most things, more proficient at this form of magic.
"I will not hesitate to kill all of you and then myself if we do not walk in there and impress," said Ernie as he placed his hands on his hips. "Smiles please, and Harry you look positively depressed. Could you please at least pretend to be straight for five minutes?"
"Oh yes, you can go from living with me at your own house to living with me at Hogwarts," said Draco.
"Seems fitting," Draco folded his arms, smirking at Harry who rolled his eyes. "You only prove my point."
"Honestly? I don't know," Harry looked up, locking their eyes. He could see his bright green eyes reflected in Draco's grey ones which were studying his face carefully as if trying to deduce whether Harry was lying or not. "I feel something. I want to be around you, I want to impress you, I want to make you smile. I never thought I could feel this way about a-"
Ron and Harry probably should have been practising their Protean Charms with Hermione, Ginny, and Luna during their first-period charms class. Instead, they sitting at the back of the class playing Gobstones under the desk.
Now everyone's eyes were on them. Draco took a seat next to Hermione before she could look up either and didn't meet her gaping expression. He looked back to Harry who was still standing, dumbfounded at the Slytherin's boldness.
"Like hell you are!" Said Hermione. "You both have Defence Against the Dark Arts tomorrow. The paper in the morning, and a practical exam in the afternoon! You're not sleeping until you've had at
"And, I would like to address another matter," McGonagall said gravely. Harry inhaled slowly, he was not in a mood for a lecture about his diet, or his grades, or tutoring. "Would you happen to have any insight as to why, a mere five minutes after breakfast, that it was brought to my attention that five Gryffindor fourth years were found with bright purple skin, unable to provide any evidence of their attacker because all that could come out of their mouth was, and I quote, 'I will never bother Draco Malfoy again'?"
"Again, who would believe you? Who would believe any of this?" Draco reconnected his lips with Harry's with a sense of urgency that would seem unnecessary, they had all the time in the world to be here together, or so it seemed. Harry let himself be pulled closer to Malfoy who's hands travelled under his jacket and rested just under his shoulder blades where he could keep them together.
He and Draco were no longer holding hands as they entered the common room last. Some still looked at Draco with judgement heavy in their eyes but that was so beyond Harry's ability to care anymore.
In a world of powerlessness, what he ate was one of the only things he could control. The hypnotic ache of hunger had also become rewarding to him, a punishment for being for being alive, taking up space in the world where so many people who had given there lives to him should be.
"Expecto Patronum!" He cried. All heads turned to him as he shouted the incantation but his iconic corporal stag did not erupt from his wand but rather a wispy string of silver light slivered from his wand tip before disappearing almost immediately leaving a cold feeling in his chest. He could not produce a Patronus, and every eye in the room was fixed on him, a tsunami of pity hit him in the chest.
Harry could see the hesitation in Malfoy's grey eyes. He looked terrified. Harry watched as his wand arm trembled, and he kept biting his lip, trying to gain the courage to cast the most unforgivable curse.
"I've tried, sure" Draco shrugged, leaning against the brick wall that his bed sat against. "I guess I don't have any truly happy memories."
Harry found it hard to answer. The answer, of course, was yes but he felt stupid to say that out loud. If he had just died or handed himself over to die sooner, Lupin and Tonks would be raising Teddy, Colin Creevey would be studying for his N.E.W.Ts and Fred Weasley wouldn't just be a trapped soul and would be running his joke shop with his twin brother. So many others wouldn't have had to lose their lives protecting him. Even his own parents died for his life, wasn't that enough?
"I hated you because you didn't want to be my friend, I hated you because you were on the Quidditch team, I hated you because everyone was so fascinated by you, I hated you because Dumbledore liked you, I hated you because you had a better broom than me, I hated you because you would never understand what it was like to be unappreciated by your own father. They were so real at the time, but no that I think on them, they're so childish."
"Ginny!" He calls, making all present company lookup toward Ron's sister who was approaching the group with her husband Dean Thomas who held their twin girl's hands as they made their way through the steam. "I thought you weren't going to make it."
Ron turned quickly and headed out of the room before both Draco and Harry could burst out into laughter. It felt wrong, to laugh on a day like this. Harry's chest stung with the force of it.
There were a few seconds of silence before Harry spoke again. "Is that what McGonagall wanted to talk to you about?"
"Me and Dra- Malfoy? What exactly has Ron told you?" Harry leant against the door, his hands behind his back and unable to meet her eye.
The chatter was comforting. The warmth of the crackling fireplace and his full belly only added to the comforting atmosphere. He felt safe.
"If I could still throw up, I think I'd be doing so right now," Fred spoke in a deadpan voice before disappearing back into the wall.
The whole class groaned when Slughorn assigned partners for the rest of the year, claiming that no one should be slacking off in their most crucial year. Harry was not surprised by the Potions master's decision to assign him to Malfoy but that was not to say that he was happy about it.
He laughed as the force of the wind around him flattened his unruly hair to his skull and stung his cheeks. He looped around himself and made himself level with the goal posts where Ron was already waiting for him.
"Self-Preservation," Harry muttered, remembering his and Malfoy's conversation in the common room. "He's a through and through Slytherin."
"You expect one from Malfoy?" Ron sniggered. "The ungrateful git would rather eat a bucket of Flobberworms before he tarnishes his pride."
"Sorry about that Harry, wasn't looking where I was going." Harry's gut turned and he looked up to see the one face in the Weasley family he felt the most guilty about. George Weasley used his wand to collect the contents of the box and lift it back up into his arms. Harry could see him open his mouth to say something but he dashed past him before he could say anything.
Harry watched him as Draco scanned the room for him. Their eyes met. Malfoy bowed his head as he made his way over to him. Harry worried that the reason he was late was because those nitwits tried to harass him again.
"You have to understand, that's probably for the best," Draco's voice was very quiet. He yawned. "It's for your safety, after what I saw yesterday it was probably everyone else's too. You dropped like a stone."
"Right." Could Draco be regretting the kiss, the declaration, everything? His gut clenched. Harry froze at the idea of having Draco reject after he had made such a fool of himself in front of him. "But just wanted to talk about... your... flying during that Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. You were amazing!"
"If it wasn't for my 'help' you'd be you wouldn't be here with your full course meals and your comfy bed. You'd be in Azkaban with dear old daddy-"
"After the kiss, my stupid and over the top declaration of affection, this right now. What are we, Harry?" Harry realised that he was witnessing a Draco with absolutely none of his barriers up. This Draco's voice cracked and wavered as he talked and this Draco held him tight.
"Fine," Harry nodded. He slid his hands down Draco's torso and around his waist. It was quite satisfying for Harry to see Draco's breath hitch in the back of his throat as he did so.
He found himself back inside an hour later, walking up the stairs to Ron's bedroom, looking at his feet the whole way up. He bumped into someone and the contents of a box they were holding crashed into the floor.
The library contained many sixth, seventh and eighth-year students making the most of a free period. Harry made his way to their previously decided upon table. It was in a section of the library that was mostly empty, in amongst the Advanced Alchemy books.
Harry watched the two Slytherin's leave. When Park shot a glare in his direction, Draco hit her over the top of her head with the palm of his hand.
While arranging silverware around the table, Harry watched Ginny. Her red hair was tied up haphazardly and her white dressing gown was tied tightly around her, accentuating her waist nicely. He frowned as he remembered how infatuated with her he once been. He wondered why the feeling had faded. Love in the books he had read as a child promised a feeling that was true and never ended. He straightened a fork that was angled slightly odd before Ron elbowed him, noticing his strange behaviour. Harry smiled thinly as to reassure him that everything was fine. But was it? Harry wasn't really sure.
"I'm sure you don't actually want to talk about my mother," Draco sighed "I'm sorry that you don't have anyone today."
"Let's go," Draco whispered in Harry's ear. They headed back to the eighth year common room and their dorm to put away their things.
Harry kicked off the ground hard, determined to get a high vantage point to watch the game from. He sat on his Firebolt as the quaffle began racing across the field.
Harry was having the time of his life on a lovely spring afternoon, on top of his covers and engaging in a light afternoon nap when he was so rudely awoken by a pillow hitting his face.
Harry watched her slowly ascend the boy's dormitory staircase curiously, wondering what she could be doing. He sat back into the red armchair and folds his legs underneath him. Soon enough Professor McGonagall returned from the dormitory with a basket of clothes floating in front of her. Harry didn't say anything, in fact, he pretended not to look at her but he couldn't help but be curious as to why she has taken a basket of clothes from his dormitory.
"I mean, it's not an 'O'," Malfoy pulled out his own essay which he must have received at the beginning of the lesson which did, in fact, have a green 'O' on it. "But, you exceeded even my expectations."
"I'm writing home tonight for my broom, Potter, you best be lucky you've already played Slytherin," said Malfoy warningly as he picked his black school bag off a bench.
Right on queue, Athena flew by and dropped four small packages and one larger one as the breakfast cleared. The brown paper that wrapped the parcels had a name written in neat cursive. Harry picked up the package with his name written neatly on it. It was identical to the other three smaller ones printed with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. The last package, the bigger one, Ron was holding in and staring at as if it were something otherworldly.
But James merely laughed, permitting his blonde father to kiss him on the forehead and gave Harry one last hug before leaping onto the rapidly filling train.
As the eighth years entered the hall there certainly were some turned heads admiring their coordination and style. The hall itself was beautiful. There was a subtle spring theme with large vases of flowers on every surface, pastel tablecloths and candles. There were small lights floating around the ceiling that Harry had to assume were some kind of bewitched fireflies. They danced beautifully through the air, illuminating the twilight sky in the heavens.
He re-joined the two-person race with gusto, his eye's locked onto Park's small body who had found the snitch again. Though the girl had just given up an unbeatable advantage, this was still a Quidditch match, and Harry was determined to win.
Harry could not bring himself to focus on his Transfiguration essay, instead, he kept looking around blankly at the other students dotted around the room. He could see the back of Malfoy's head as he sat alone on a table near the restricted section. He couldn't help but wonder to himself if Malfoy felt lonely or upset in his own little corner of the library where any other students were giving him a wide berth as to not disturb the former Death Eater.
"Hermione would, I would like you to come study with us," Harry said nervously. Draco stopped writing before he looked up at him.
"Goodnight, Potter." Draco flicked his wand and pushed himself off Harry's bed calmly, slipping past the curtain and returning to his own bed a few feet away.
Harry rolled his eyes. He still didn't want to go back. He knew what would happen when he walks those halls, when he sleeps in that four-poster bed. The memories will flood back stronger and faster than they already have been. The nightmares will seep into his conscious mind.
"Then you're not gay," said Ginny with a sad smile. "If you feel the same way about him as you did me, you're not gay."
"Like what?" Harry shrugged. "My aunt Petunia tried everything to make it lie flat and it didn't work."
Harry sat on the end of Draco's bed as he waited for him to return from the en-suite bathroom which he had excused himself to.
Ernie levitated the box of sweets over his empty bed and toward Anthony Goldstein who stared at the box for a while before plucking a white bean from the box and inspecting it thoroughly before placing it in his mouth tentatively.
"This is you," Harry pointed to the stretcher bed next to his own, placing both their coats on the stand behind Ron's door. "Sorry, it's no four poster."
"Mostly, I guess, I just see flashes from my memory. Sometimes they're more abstract, like just darkness with odd shapes. Once I wake up they aren't distressing, but when I am dreaming them they just seem so real," Harry explained.
"Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley are being absolutely ghastly about Hufflepuff's loss, so I decided I'd enjoy the company of the victors both to escape their inescapable whining and to anger them further," Draco explained with a sly grin on his face.
Silence fell between them as it so often did. Draco was playing with his hands while Harry fell deep into thought.
As soon as Harry stepped onto the platform, a conflicting wave of emotion crashed down onto him. The evening was clear, in the distance the Hogwarts castle was visible and standing proudly against the horizon. Hogwarts was the only place Harry had ever felt at home for his entire life, he had found his first friends there, he had found things that he was good at there. But now, it was the site where so many people had died to make sure that he didn't. He swallowed the lump in his throat and quickly tore his eyes away from it.
"What happened?" Draco asked. The first silent spell must have created a soundproof bubble around Harry's bed.
"In memorial and celebration of this anniversary, I have decided that we will host a ball in honour of those who fought and of those who gave their lives."
He had not recognised him for it had been over a year since he had seen the now fifth-year boy. His shoulders slumped as he turned and Harry saw the face of Dennis Creevey as he high fived his friends.
"I can tell you don't," Draco rolled his eyes. Silence fell between them and Draco took a calming breath and laid his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry smiled a little. "What did McGonagall say when you woke up?"
He smirked as he plucked a purple bean from the box and placing it in his mouth. "Blueberry muffin."
"I've had so long to think about it. Too long actually. Second guessing myself, bailing at the last minute because I was nervous. But I guess I can't wimp out now," Harry closed his eyes, steadying his nerves before turning his head to look Draco in the eye. "Draco, do you... do you want to be my... boyfriend?"
"Absolutely not," Draco snapped his head around to him. "I will not have you clambering over me in the middle of the night."
"I liked it better when you weren't talking," he whispered back. Harry lowered his hand and let it rest on the bed.
"It wasn't on purpose, I promise," Harry gave Draco a small smile and reached for the blonde haired boy's hands.
The dorm watched in anticipation as Anthony's face remained untelling. He seemed to swallow and he looked around the room. "Under-ripe banana."
In the past week, since they had returned, Draco and Harry had shared many encounters that he couldn't describe in any other fashion than flirtatious.
Harry was beginning to feel uneasy. The uncomfortable feeling he got in his stomach whenever his mind was taken back to the war was settling in place and his brain was beginning to relive memories he would rather forget. His knee began bouncing erratically, and hands began twisting around each other. He loosened his bow tie just a little and tried to slow his breathing as he attempted to look like he wasn't panicking.
He took a deep breath, shaking off any unnecessary doubt or worry, and opened the doors to the wing slowly. He saw Madame Pomfrey glance at him curiously before recognising him and walking toward the bed he knew belonged to Malfoy.
He continued to dodge and swerve as he followed the Golden Snitch on its manic path through the air, swooping around, over and under, up and down.
"I'm so sorry, Harry," Hermione tried a supportive smile. "McGonagall mentioned something like this might happen."
One thing that had not changed was the portrait wall. The portraits seemed to all be whispering as they laid eyes on Harry, a few dashing out of their frames, presumably to alert their two-dimensional friends of his arrival. Harry's eyes immediately fell on the two newest looking portraits, their frames the least burdened by dust and dulling paint. He slowly walked toward them. One was occupied while the other was vacant. From the occupied one, the blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore twinkled at him through the paint.
Draco's eyes snapped up to meet his. Their breath intermingled. Neither of the boys moved for several seconds. Harry purposefully flicked his eyes down toward Draco's lips before returning to his grey eyes to encourage a reaction from Draco.
Harry felt the familiar rush of adrenaline racing through his body as he prepared to kick off the ground and into the air. His grip tightened around the handle and with the Quaffle tucked under his arm he kicked hard into the ground and sent himself upwards at amazing speed.
," McGonagall said loudly so they can all hear. The metal patterns came to life and retreat back into the hinges letting the doors swing open.
The letter did not come with a sender, Harry already knew who sent it. Harry fumed at the pompous attitude of Malfoy. Why would he leave Ron and Hermione to hang out with him? Homework is more important than flying anyway.
The Boy who Lived crashed into the ground unceremoniously and when he didn't move Ron rushed to the ground after him.
Begrudgingly, the five Gryffindors shuffled off back in the direction that they came. Harry approached Malfoy cautiously, not knowing how he was going to react.
Harry sat by himself at one of the many tables in the Entrance Hall laden with food. He picked at a dinner roll as he looked around at all the commotion.
"It was worse before. Stop gawking and get out your homework," Draco rolled his eyes. Harry felt rather embarrassed as he rummaged around in his bag to pull out the parchment he had been using in Potions earlier that day. Malfoy held out his hand for it and Harry passed it to him carefully. Their fingers touched just for a moment and Harry pulled his hand back suddenly as he came in contact with the near burning sensation of Malfoy's cold hands.
"Do you wanna, uh, go?" Harry offered his forearm to Malfoy. The Slytherin boy looked down at the arm offered to him, uncertainty in his silver eyes.
He wallowed in his thoughts as they entered the common room and sat down by the fire to start on their charms homework.
"Well, without getting uncomfortably sappy," Draco sighed, glancing towards the eavesdropping ghost for a second. "It's not really the victors I came to see. Just you."
He sat down and didn't bother taking out his potions work, straightening his tie and running his fingers through his hair pedantically.
"Yes, Potter," she said calmly, clearly expecting this reaction from him. "And I expect the both of you to be adults about it and get over your petty past."
Harry emerged into a clearing where Voldemort stood alone waiting for him, his blood red eyes fixated upon him.
"In your dreams, Draco," Harry grabbed the end of the Nimbus 2001 and pulled the smug Slytherin closer until their knees almost touched.
Harry glanced around the dorm room where he saw that most of its occupants were looking at the two of them, eyebrows raised.
"Well, I guess after the war we spent a lot of time together. I couldn't come to school last year, I'm Muggle-born, so Ernie sent me letters every week without fail. I guess I started realising how much I need him. So hanging out all summer made us both come to terms with our feelings and he asked me to be his boyfriend."
Harry extended his arm in front of Ron's plate and picked up the glass jar slowly. He turned to George, watching him carefully as he extended the jar toward him. George smiled at Harry as he took the salt and poured it over his breakfast in alarming amounts.
"I'll take them back," Terry sighed dramatically. "The journey may exhaust me, don't expect me to make an appearance at this stupid party."
He had little trouble catching up to Malfoy as he neared the stadium, he rolled around him, teasing him lightly before speeding off.
Draco didn't reply. Harry nudged the seemingly empty space where Draco should be just to make sure he hadn't disappeared. He sat down next to him with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny on the opposite bench.
"I..." Harry scrunched up his face and dropped his head into his hands. "It's the Patronus study. I can't conjure one anymore."
Practically the whole school headed down to the Quidditch pitch, everyone wearing their jumpers and scarves of all house colours but there was an abundance of red and green to support the teams playing that morning.
"I'm not!" Harry insisted. It was clear that Hermione didn't believe him but she didn't press the issue further.
The shrill blow of the whistle triggered Harry's muscle memory and he thrust off from the ground at incredible speed, rising higher and higher into the air. This was it.
Harry hesitantly slid into the bench next to him, looking up at Ron, who sat opposite, and Hermione's amazed expressions.
"Nonsense, my boy," Dumbledore chuckled. "Everything you have learned over the past seven years prepared you for what was to happen. You vanquished Voldemort again and peace has been restored to the Wizarding, and Muggle, worlds."
"I believe you are really trying to improve yourself," McGonagall smiles. "You did not deserve the childhood you received, at least we can try to make your adulthood as boring as possible."
Ron and Hermione both laughed at his nonchalant attitude and his concern about his broom rather than himself. "Hardly a scratch," Ron assured him.
Draco sat down by the window and pulled the hood of the cloak back to reveal a floating blonde head.
Hagrid seemed close to tears when he opened the door of his Groundskeeper's hut to see Harry, Ron and Hermione beaming up at him. He quickly engulfed the three in a rib-crushing hug which left them gasping for air.
Harry, Draco, and Ron headed to dinner that evening on Hermione's orders as she had some 'urgent matters' to attend to before she was to join them.
Harry walked to the Owlery alone. Every step he took reminded him of Hedwig, the owl he had formed a deep bond with before she became but another casualty in his war. The dark clouds had returned to the sky and promised rain, perhaps even snow, in the near future.
"Not every day," said Regulus quickly. "James says most people only get letters from home about once a month."
Together they walked to her desk, Harry sat himself down in a slender white armchair facing the Professor.
"I thought we'd play a little game," Voldemort chuckled, lowering his hood. "Before I kill you, you have to choose which one of your friends for me to kill."
"She's proud of you. I'm sure of it." Harry pulled the red and gold tie around his neck and began tying it for the very last time.
"Come on Harry," Neville called from inside the common room with Hermione at his side. "We can't start the party without our captain!"
"I'm just glad you didn't get any on the grass or I would've had you try the potion. Maybe you would've grown an extra brain, so you can concentrate on what you're doing." Harry swore that beneath that snark, Malfoy was actually smiling.
Draco slowly made his way over to Ron who was a few meters away now, returning to his and Harry's previous positions.
"What happened?" Harry asked curiously. Malfoy did not answer. He just continued reading the notes as if the boy sitting next to him were not even there.
The boys laughed about stupid things until Hermione returned a few minutes later, dumping an armful of packaged sweets and snacks into each of their laps.
"My dear, Harry," Slughorn peered into his cauldron with a disappointed look as the clock threatened the end of the day. "It seems your year off has offended your potion skills. Perhaps you need a tutor," he sighed as he vanished the contents of the cauldron. "Fifteen points to Gryffindor, Miss Granger. I'm looking forward to the rest of this year with you."
Harry sat at the back of the table, only engaging in conversation when prompted by Ron or Hermione. He sat and stared at the plaques on the back wall, listing the students who gave their lives whether underage or barely seventeen. He couldn't tear his eyes away, it was like seeing them dead again.
The first bench of students stood, blocking Harry's view. One by one, McGonagall called the name of a Slytherin student along with the N.E.W.Ts they achieved. Each name was followed by polite applause from the students and the parents but Harry's eyes were fixed on the back of Malfoy's head.
They continued to lounge into the afternoon. The couches were filled with drowsy or reading eighth years. On opposite couches, Draco and Hermione snuggled into their boyfriends' chests as they dozed in the sunlight pouring in through the window.
Harry didn't say anything for a while, simply studying Draco's face. "Who are you and what have you done with Draco?"
Harry awoke on Christmas Eve clutching his duvet around him. He curled himself into a ball as his conscious mind made him so much more aware of the freezing temperature. He looked up to the window to see nothing but white sky. It was snowing.
"Our bonding moment?" Draco laughed. "Have you not sat in the dark with a boy, confessing your deepest darkest secrets before, Potter?"
"Thank you, Granger," Draco pulled his lips into a thin line. "But I just need to conclude this essay and then I'll be done for the night."
"Student, Staff and guests," she began. "I would like to welcome you here tonight in remembrance of the lives lost throughout the First and Second Wizarding wars as well as the battle that occurred within the walls of this very castle a year ago today. But we must also celebrate the new age of prosperity that has befallen the wizarding community across the globe. Our decorations tonight were chosen to reflect this prosperous season that we find ourselves in, but also it symbolises the new beginning of our society into a more accepting and beautiful future. With that, I encourage you to enjoy the evening and enjoy the hospitality our school has to offer!"
Harry extended a hand toward Draco. Sure, it was only a small step into the common room but he felt like it was the right thing to do.
Harry didn't want to admit it but he had been avoiding Draco for the past two weeks. He wasn't exactly sure why. Any excuse to avoid alone time with the Slytherin, Harry took with enthusiasm. Ever since the incident, as he called it, he tried not to think about it. It was like a dream, Harry wasn't sure it had even happened.
Draco began moving and Harry struggled to keep up. He was constantly looking down at his feet, unable to grasp the pattern that they made.
Every time he saw George's face his stomach twisted and hot bile creeped up his throat. It is all his fault Fred had died. Fighting in his stupid battle Fred Weasley had lost his life in the halls of Hogwarts no more than a few months ago battling a Death Eater just as so many others had. Looking at George was like staring a ghost in the face, a ghost that he had caused.
"No," Harry admitted, looking around frantically. He pulled up his coat sleeve to glance at his watch.
"This is it," Harry pushed open Ron's bedroom door. Draco's face said it all and Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. "Nine days, I'm sure you can survive. It's better than being locked up in the castle."
Voldemort seemed to grow impatient and shoved Malfoy to the ground. He held his wand high and yelled; "Avada Kedavra!"
"And absolutely none of that," Draco said. "Who knew that the Chosen One would be so desperate for me?"
"Perhaps, if someone knew to value their friends over traitors, we wouldn't have a problem," Ron smiled cynically, not looking at Harry.
"I don't think so," Charlie hit his younger brother in the back of the head. "I'm the eldest, I'm pulling rank. George, Ginny and I versus Ron, Harry and Malfoy."
"Hagrid telling me that I was a wizard," Harry looked to the floor. "Learning that I was worth more than what my aunt and uncle told me."
Harry's eyes instinctively looked over to scan the Slytherin table. He found Draco bear the end of the table. A third year of his house was talking to him animatedly.
"I think you've been hanging around Justin and Ernie too much," Harry shook his head, picking up the quill from the ink pot adding a few words to his letter.
"So I have some rather odd news," said Hermione as the three of them were making their way up to the castle from the Green Houses. "Guess who decided to accompany me during History of Magic."
Harry pushed himself up into a sitting position and fumbled for his glasses on the bedside table. Around the room, the other boys were stirring, most refusing to come to terms with the reality of getting out of bed.
"I thought for a moment they were hoodwinking my favourite assistant," said Draco without looking up from the potion when Harry returned to his side.
Harry dragged himself to the ensuite bathroom, forcing himself not to think about the gruesome images that his brain had conjured. He saw himself in the mirror and sighed at his complexion. He pushed his hair back off his forehead and peered at the thin lightning bolt scar as if he was expecting it to be different. It had not pained him in exactly a year but he couldn't help but trace a finger down the mark.
The Boy who Lived forgot how to breathe for a second. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione who were both looking at them with completely different expressions. Ron's face showed clear signs of disparagement while Hermione was visibly containing her excitement.
"Oh Harry, Hermione," Mrs Weasley pulled them both into a hug. "Your parents would have been so proud to see you up there. Young adults now."
"I think it's time for studying," Draco said as he broke the kiss, resting his forehead against Harry's. "Granger will have my head if I keep you too long."
He sat up and swung his legs off the side, rubbing his eyes with the heel of his hands. He sighed and gazed across the room at the other blurry boys sleeping soundly, some had their curtains drawn while others let the breeze from the slightly open window brush across their skin.
"What happened to you?" Harry asked again, this time he was not going to let him avoid the question.
For a second Malfoy's head shot around to look at him before returning to focus on whatever he was doing. "Yes?"
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Regulus' face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outline of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Regulus jumped onto the carriage and Draco closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on and off the train, seemed to be turned toward Harry.
"Harry?" Hermione tapped her bowl nervously before looking behind her in the direction of the other tables. "Why don't you ask Malfoy to come sit with us during meals? He's just so alone over there and I'm sure McGonagall wouldn't mind, we are eighth years."
"Draco. You've helped me more than you can imagine. I can't tell why you've chosen me, but I'm glad you did," Harry said out of nowhere. He meant every word though. Having a boy sitting in his lap, Draco Malfoy no less, made Harry feel so full. Like there was a little over missing that he didn't know was lost until it was filled.
Harry's eyes fluttered open and he received a blurry view of Ron's bedroom ceiling as he had done every morning for the last week. Except today was different. Today there was another presence in the room. Also, it was Christmas Day.
"You know how we said that this, whatever we're doing, was just 'testing the waters'?" Harry paused, waiting for Draco to respond but he only nodded. "I think... I think that I want something more than that."
"In the Easter holidays of the fifth year my Mother, Father and I took a trip to France and we stayed at the home of a family friend. Beauxbaton boys really do know how to dance," Draco smiled cheekily.
Harry stared at the clock on the stone wall all through double potions waiting anxiously for the bell to ring, signalling the end of the day. Thankfully, Professor Slughorn had them writing out the theory behind Polyjuice potions instead of actually making them which would have just embarrassed Harry further after last lesson's mishap.
Draco tore open the brown paper and two items fell onto the table. The first being a small paper box, presumably filled with chocolate just as the other packages were and the other made all their jaws drop.
"Uh, yes, right," Hermione pulled herself together. "Any reason though? For your sudden change of heart?"
Today was Saturday and a Hogsmeade visit day. Harry did not want to go with Ron when he was acting so childish, but Hermione insisted and the two gave in. Harry was now hoping to slip away from them at some point to hunt down the malignant Gryffindors who decided that they themselves would punish Malfoy for his crimes.
Creeping over to him, Harry felt very surreal. Time began to move very slowly, the length between himself and Malfoy seemed to never get any shorter. He caught himself wondering just for a moment whether it would be creepy if Harry neglected to announce his presence and remained silently watching Draco from a distance. He ultimately decided it would be so he eased himself into the burgundy armchair next to Malfoy as to not startle him.
"I know! He has sat by himself all year but he took the empty seat beside Parvati and I." Hermione explained. "He even corrected some of my notes I had misheard!"
"Great," McGonagall smiled, flicking her wand so a piece of paper on her desk folds neatly and slides into an envelope.
"Huh? Sorry, yes," he shook his head, staring down at the parchment before him which still needed another four inches.
"There's quite a few of them this year," Hermione observed as they headed toward the carriages with the other students.
He waved over the Professor who tapped his wand to the tip of Harry's finger. A strange feeling shot through Harry's body as the magic mended the cut.
"Stay away from things you don't understand? A bit hypocritical from you. If I recall correctly, you never knew how to do that," Malfoy folded his arms across his chest as his face faded to its usual pale complexion. Harry was surprised to detect little to no malice in his voice, it even sounded like he was attempting to joke with him.
McGonagall had whisked Draco away some time ago to discuss an urgent matter and Harry had given up searching for Ron and Hermione after a matter of minutes.
In the week since the announcement of the Remembrance Ball, Hogwarts was filled with excitement. Rumours were spreading about who the guests of honour would be. Some speculated that the presidents of Magical communities across the globe would be in attendance while some were convinced that McGonagall was inviting magical celebrities to the castle.
That left Draco. Now, he made sense. Harry had an inkling that Draco would understand his current condition. It was on this day, or perhaps early tomorrow, the Draco's life had changed forever.
The ball had no chance of touching Harry. He swiftly moved out of its path, laughing mockingly as he did so. With a flick of his wand, he summoned the ball to him and had it hover in front of him.
"Yeah, whatever," Draco grumbled. "I'm sure Weasley will come up here any second for you, Merlin forbid he catches you talking to me."
He hit the grass ungracefully, thankfully he was only a few feet in the air on collision. He sat up slowly, testing out any injuries, there weren't any. But there was, however, a golden snitch laying quiet in his fist.
"I... uh," Harry dropped his hands below the table and fiddled with his fingers, staring at the angry burn on the bak of his hand.
"I never said that," Harry sighed. "But it doesn't matter, he doesn't have to tell me if he's gay. I'd prefer not to know anyway. It's not like he'd try and get with anyone we know."
The team got down from the tables and joined the crowd of rowdy students. Someone begins to play music out of an enchanted speaker and everyone began to enjoy the ruckus of a traditional Gryffindor style victory party.
"Then it's settled," she pulled her hands away from Harry and stood up, only reaching Harry's nose. "As long as you weren't in the closet for our relationship and you didn't break up with me for him, I have no problem with it. Go and be gay, whatever you want."
"It's alright, Potter," Professor Dellow placed a hand on his shoulder, he didn't react. He simply stared into the middle distance ahead of him. "Come with me, the rest of you, continuing practising, uh, stuff. Don't break anything!" She ushered Harry into the hallway who still stared blankly at the wall.
"I don't think you get it," Draco rolled his eyes. "You're never going to escape the cameras or the reporters. Your whole life is going to be documented."
"Does someone need me to give them a right jinxing?" With a flick of his wand, the Gobstones returned to their box.
Draco laughed, finally looking at Harry. "You can tell me if it isn't. I'm just 'testing the waters'."
"At the trial. You told the Wizengamot that my mother and I saved your life, saving us from Azkaban and sentencing us to house arrest. After all the shitty things I did to you, why did you defend me?"
"You know, I think you may be on to something with this friendship thing," Hermione admitted, much to Ron's disgust. "I'll come."
"Pardon?" Draco frowned. Hermione passed the parcel across the table and Draco held it in his hands delicately. "Why would she?"
"Way to go, Draco!" Harry laughed. Draco beamed, as in a genuine, ecstatic expression. Harry hadn't seen that in a long time.
Ron and Harry headed up the stairs first and found themselves in a long rectangular room with nine beds lined up on the opposite walls, four on one side, five on the other. On the walls behind each bed was an ornate animal, the house mascot, with a name underneath each. Ron and Harry found their beds next to each other, close the far side of the room on the left side with their trunks at the end of their beds. On the stone wall behind them, there was an image of a lion reared up on its hind legs composed of different shades of red metal with the words '
Although Harry was sporting a Ravenclaw scarf that chilly morning he couldn't help but cheer on his, well, he wasn't quite sure what they were.
Harry fought a smile as Fred Weasley got into the spirit of Halloween, scaring the first years who weren't so used to the ghosts. No one could be melancholy during the Halloween feast. There were pumpkins everywhere, spiders along the walls were bewitched into creating beautiful art pieces of their webs. The sky above was clear and starry and the food on the table was rich and delicious.
"Too right, there is a fine line between fashionably late and embarrassingly late. Pull yourselves together back there and let's get a move on!" Said Ernie.
"Well, I'm sure the Ministry wouldn't mind if I teach you a lesson myself," Ron reached for his Willow wood wand.
"Ugh," Draco rolled his eyes before walking around Harry's bed to stand in front of him. "You are so thick, Potter. It's like you forget that magic exists."
Harry was stunned. He looked at Malfoy with concerned eyes, he reached out to touch him. Draco shivered under the slight brush of Harry's fingers against his bicep.
"It's fine, I figured as much lately based on you avoiding me most of the summer," she sighed, placing both her hands on Harry's upper arms. "I'll be here for you always and if you ever want to try again, I'll be more than happy, okay?" She smiled. Harry nodded.
"There's barely anyone here, anyway," he said. "And I'm making sure you weren't lying earlier." He was right. It was Easter tomorrow so students had the option of returning home for a week.
In a clearing up ahead he saw a tall cloaked man facing away from him. Harry's foot hit a root and he toppled to the damp forest floor. He looked up to the cloaked figure who was slowly turning around to face the source of the noise. The blazing red eyes under the hood locked into Harry who scrambled to his feet, terrified, and ran behind a tree.
Harry laid on his back, happily watching an uncomfortable Malfoy attempt to maintain his aloof front.
"See you Reg," Harry said as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't let James wind you up. And don't duel anyone 'til you know how." Draco's eyes met Harry's with a slight smile
The nurse signalled for him to wait before she headed back to her desk briskly. So there Harry stood, rather awkwardly while he listened keenly to the soft rustling of fabric and clinking of metal against metal.
Much to his surprise, a large horned owl dropped a letter onto Harry's empty plate. A pang shot through his heart as he was suddenly reminded of Hedwig, his late owl who died trying to protect him. Just another soul caught in the crossfire.
Ginny and Ron performed brilliantly as always. Demelza Robins was adamant that she resumed her position as a chaser as well. Jimmy Peakes and Richie Coote both gained their old positions on the team as beaters as well. Harry only became uneasy when the tryouts had been on for nearly an hour and he couldn't find a suitable player to fill the final spot on his team.
"Don't have my wand sorry," Draco showed his hands. "Maybe I should play Chaser not Seeker, I'm alright at this."
"Yes, but Slughorn thought Harry was good even though he was just copying Snape's work," she pointed out with a disapproving tone. "You've never been very good at potions." Ron shot her a dirty look but she was right.
Harry suddenly felt as if there was a weight in his gut. Somewhere below his intestines was a feeling that made him feel both hot and cold at the same time. His brain was running in overdrive; telling him to be closer to Malfoy at the same time as running far, far away. He twisted his wand in his right hand as it was the only part of his body that felt safe to move.
Harry stood up, thinking that a walk would be best for him right now. He grabbed his glasses, invisibility cloak and his slippers and made his way as quietly as he could out of the dormitory.
"Yeah, I get it," Harry looked down at the half-finished letter in front of him. "He's been having a hard time."
"Ron, I love you, but, you have the emotional capabilities of a lump of Gillyweed," Hermione made eye contact with Harry and nodded to the doorway.
"Let me play Quidditch, that's all I ask," Harry adjusted his position on McGonagall's orders. "And I guess Ron, Hermione, and Draco can help me."
Harry refocused himself on labelling the parts of a Venomous Tentacula but his mind kept returning to Draco as well as Hermione's words at dinner. He didn't know what he and Draco were and he wasn't sure what he wanted them to be.
Excitement was thick in the air during breakfast; it was the day of the first Quidditch match of the year
"Outstanding in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration. Exceeds Expectations in Herbology and Potions."
"I'm glad to see your grades are beginning to resemble those of your sixth year, I know you can put in that little extra effort, however."
He passed the box to Justin who laughed. "No thanks, I'm not in the mood to potentially bring up my dinner."
He had been in the office on many occasions, most of which was when Professor Dumbledore was in charge. There was the last time during the battle when Snape had been Headmaster. He remembers it being darker, plainer. Harry had thought it empty without Fawkes the Phoenix and all Dumbledore's intricate possessions. He wondered to himself how Professor McGonagall had changed it.
"I didn't," Harry replied shortly. He couldn't see Draco's face but he smiled to himself knowing it would be one of confusion.
Harry had never been more anxious for his potions tutorial to start. He walked briskly down the halls, holding onto the strap on his bag with one hand against his chest.
Harry stayed mostly silent during these retellings, the memories playing in his mind like a theatre as he relived every dark and terrifying moment. Hermione sensed this and placed a hand on his forearm which he felt tethered himself to reality, even just a little bit.
Harry closed his eyes as he tried to think of why McGonagall had lied to him about the reason for Malfoy's disappearance. Harry found himself losing consciousness after a while and let himself fall into what would be an uneasy sleep.
It was the small brushes of their hands during their potions tutorials, the antagonising whispers during their potions class, the purposeful nudges and glances in the dorm room. These were the things that made that strange feeling in Harry's stomach appear and distract his entire self from what he is supposed to be doing.
Together, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Harry had apparated to the station, the last with Draco under the invisibility cloak on his arm.
"Dra- Malfoy was just raised with that mindset. Now that he's an adult, no longer under his father's command he can make his own decisions. Most importantly, to be less of a dick," Harry commented.
There he was, in his dress pants, shirt hanging off his shoulders and bow tie hanging around his neck, humming some tune Harry did not recognise. He sauntered over to his bed and picked up his own jacket to throw over a chair.
As embarrassing as it was for Harry to be forced to eat out of a box picked my McGonagall for every meal, everyone around him could see that was working.
He had been finally cornered in the Headmaster's office, no wand to defend himself with. The undead bodies of Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, Lavender Brown, Nymphadora Tonks and Colin Creevey stalked toward him, a hoard of others behind them.
"It's a cursed burn," Draco explained, taking the hand in between his own gently. "Your dreams of becoming a wand model are over, I'm sorry."
"I think it's... uh, cute," Harry lowered his voice to barely above a whisper. He shuffled closer to Draco so that their sides were touching.
Harry, unsurprisingly, was was one of these people. He woke late and remained in bed, feigning sleep until he could no longer hear anyone else in the dorm. That's when he got up and saw the plate of food someone had brought up from the kitchens for him on his bedside table. He was grateful, he didn't feel like talking to anyone until he had to.
Harry looked at Malfoy and watched him close his eyes. The Adam's Apple in his throat moved as he swallowed thickly, clearly he was thinking about the distressing day or days where he tried to rip open his skin. Harry couldn't help staring at him like this; the messy hair, the unguarded nature. Harry did nothing to stop his eyes raking over his body. He had never seen Malfoy like this, even Harry could admit that with his guard lowered he appeared quite handsome, though he would rather take a swim in the Black Lake than admit that to him.
"And another ten points to Hufflepuff from Smith!" Parker Williams shouted through the megaphone. Harry was beginning to become anxious. Hufflepuff was in the lead by fifty points and the Gryffindors were losing morale fast.
Something hit him in the back of the head. He frowned as he turned around. There was no one behind him. He looked to the floor and there was a small piece of parchment, crumpled up into a ball.
Harry picked up a goblet from the table, thankfully it did not disappear, and quickly swallowed the orange juice inside and pushed himself off the bench.
"Yeah?" Harry lay on his stomach next to the blonde haired boy with his arms folded. "And then they'll cart your sorry arse off to Azkaban."
"It's sensitive... he's sensitive," Harry said uncomfortably, drawing a small scribble in the margin of the parchment. "I doubt he'd be very civil if he found out I told you."
"Aberforth Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, Aberforth Dumbledore," Harry introduced the two. The mention of Draco's name caused every head in the Inn to turn. Draco elbowed Harry in the gut.
"So what is going on with you and Malfoy?" Ron abruptly changed the subject. "You never told us what you two did on your,
"I was on house arrest, Potter, with nothing to do but dwell on my self hatred," he spat, his tone changing dramatically from the calm and sleepy voice that he had been using previously.
"Oh, cool it, Potter," Malfoy sighed in a tired whisper. "Or would it kill you to not save the day for once?"
The next morning Draco returned to sit at the Gryffindor table at breakfast. This time Harry and Draco sat opposite Ron and Hermione.
He continuously saw Draco out of the corner of his eye, looking in his direction during meals or perhaps across the common room. But now when Harry caught him, Draco no longer glanced away hurriedly. Instead, he preferred to place a mysterious smirk on his face and initiate a battle of the wills, refusing to be the first to look away.
"You expect me to ride a Shooting Star?" Malfoy asked with disgust as he ran his hands over the handle.
"There's a photographer coming around!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed, wiping her tears furiously. "The four of you bunch up!"
The boys went about shuffling around, taking turns in the ensuite and getting ready for sleep. Harry laid his head back on his pillow, staring up at the blurry canopy above as his glasses sat on the nightstand. His mind raced with thoughts as it so often did. He was hyperaware of the presence of Draco Malfoy, lying in the bed mere feet from his sign who hadn't made even a sound since his arrival. Harry didn't know what to think. Malfoy was a Death Eater, pledged to the cause of his death and the oppression of Muggles, yet, he seemed so defeated, so ashamed. He clamped his eyes shut and fell into a disturbed sleep riddled with the nightmares he was now painfully used to.
Brooms and other Quidditch gear in hand, the Gryffindor team made their way down to the pitch to begin their first training of the term. Their next game wasn't until March but there was no way Harry was taking any chances during his last year at Hogwarts. He'd work his team to the bone if he had to.
That was a loaded question. Harry suspected that he had been thinking about asking him about that summer's day in the Ministry of Magic.
He swung the door open and grabbed the first broom he saw, tucking it under his arm and flying back to an unimpressed Malfoy.
"That's enough, Park," Malfoy stepped in front of her, making direct eye contact with Harry. "They reserved it, let's go."
Harry turned his head so he was looking up at Malfoy. "I'm just glad that I never have to step foot in that sweltering greenhouse again."
"Was it really that bad?" Draco whispered in Harry's ear while Neville and Ron were arm wrestling much to Hermione's embarrassment. "What I said before?"
"I cannot believe we have to convince her to come to our games," Harry laughed. "And you wanted to come anyway, it's Quidditch! It doesn't matter who's playing."
"Harry James Potter, you stupid idiot!" Having Professor McGonagall use his full name as well as call him a stupid idiot definitely made his list of top ten most terrifying experiences. "And a day after our meeting at that!"
"How long are you on probation?" Harry asked. He knew there was an unspoken rule between them to not talk about Draco's unfortunate situation but Harry couldn't help himself.
Harry breathed in deeply, his gut telling him that this was the perfect opportunity to talk to Draco. He slowly brushed Draco's hand with his and Draco responded by wrapping his thin fingers around Harry's.
"And I think Potter has seen the snitch with Park right on his tail! Remember, catching the snitch ends the game and grants the team of whichever seeker caught it one hundred and fifty points!" Parker Williams shouted into his megaphone.
"Hey! Don't ignore me," Harry frowned, holding the strap of his bag as he caught up to the Slytherin. "What's up your arse?"
The walk to the Headmistress' office was long and solemn. All Harry could think about was the game he was missing and how he hoped the meeting would not take too long, so he could be able to watch at least some of the game.
"So, you have nightmares every night, what are they about?" She asked softly after taking a sip of her tea.
Harry couldn't fight the smile on his face as he saw the common room. It was large and homey, a fireplace crackled against the far wall and there was a staircase either side of it. Around the room there were couches and chairs in the middle and desks and bookshelves against the walls. They entered, marvelling at the size of it for their small number.
Something cold touched his shoulder, causing him to jump and turn around. It was Draco, or at least a vaguely Draco shaped blob, peeking through the curtains and resting a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"No. But it wasn't out of the ordinary. It was Voldemort." Draco shuddered at the sound of his name. "He told you to kill me but you didn't"
"Even after a frightful collision, Potter has caught the snitch, earning Gryffindor one hundred and fifty points!" Parker yelled into the microphone over the cheering of the crowd. "Slytherin end the game on eighty points and Gryffindor leave victorious with two hundred and twenty points!"
"I don't have a broom." Harry spun on the spot quickly to see Draco in his school robes with his arms crossed against his chest.
He heard the door to the dorm open but he didn't turn to look. He ate the last bit of toast as he felt his mattress dip a foot or two away from him.
Harry shuffled closer to Ron, looking around the room and lowered his voice. "Don't say anything, don't react."
"Everything is still a little blurry," he murmured and he began re-buttoning his shirt. Harry sat down in the visitor's chair by his bed and tried to give the boy some privacy as he tried to redo his buttons. Harry couldn't help glancing up at the exact moment the entire shirt was apart, revealing Malfoy's pale chest. He frowned at the large scar running down it.
He reached the bottom of the stairs where he waited beside the Gargoyle awkwardly. The stone figure occasionally turned it's head to look at him with a confused look before giving up.
Harry grit his teeth and tried his best to memorise the pattern that Draco was creating with their feet. He steeled his nerves and slowly looked up from the floor to meet his eye. Draco smiled at him and began to add more movement to their stiff step.
"You don't get it, do you?" Malfoy yelled, Harry backed off again shocked at the change of tone. "Potter, you and I both know I could rearrange their vital organs with a flick of my wrist, but you know what happens if I even get one negative incident here? I get to go share a cell with my dear old father. I can't fight back Potter, and it hurts me more than these goddamn scars. No one may believe but I still have a shred of pride left and every time I am beaten to the ground by some fourteen-year-olds I am stripped of even that."
He takes the toothbrush out of his mouth and uses a towel to dab the corner of his mouth. "Daunting, exhilarating."
Harry looked back to Hermione who mouthed 'go' to him and he felt his stomach knot. He nudged Draco with the shoulder he was resting on who lifted his head with a half asleep but confused expression. Harry stood up slowly, placing his still unfinished work on a nearby sofa table and headed in the direction of the boy's dorms.
"I'm so sorry," Harry apologised when Draco locked the door before leaning against it and running his fingers through his own hair.
Draco had not noticed his staring as he was looking the other way which Harry could not be more thankful for. Malfoy had barely made it out the large wooden doors of the Entrance Hall before mounting his broom and racing off across the Hogwarts grounds.
"Do you reckon she's gonna last?" Neville asked, sitting on Hermione's other side. Harry watched the exchange between the professors, she seemed familiar but he couldn't put his finger on it.
"I... I don't know," Harry stammered. Harry really didn't know. He had this urge to be close to Malfoy, to figure him out. Harry needed to know why Malfoy was acting so strange as of late, and also why he himself was so anxious to find out.
Harry watched him out of the corner of his eye as he tried to focus on his Herbology diagrams. Draco stretched his arms above his head, causing his untucked shirt to reveal a slither of pale skin before leaning back into the couch.
"Hey, Harry!" He spun on his heel to see Ginny behind him, her face serious and eyes darting between him and Malfoy.
With Ron and Harry still refusing to talk directly with the other, the four discussed their current homework assignments and classwork as they made their way to the Hog's Head; their preferred pub.
Draco was bent over a porcelain sink, toothbrush hanging lazily from his mouth as he fussed over his hair. He had his shirt on, unbuttoned of course in dramatic Malfoy style. His black belt had been laced through the belt loops of his pants but had not been fastened.
The Slytherin robes draped over a chair by the vanity gave away the identity of the early riser but it wouldn't have been hard to guess anyway.
The whole room had quietened to watch Malfoy's outburst. Harry sat in stunned silence and stared at Draco's face reddened with madness, his hands curled into fists at his side.
Harry pressed his glasses onto his face and pulled a fluffy robe around him as he tip-toed past the beds of sleeping boys toward the door.
If life was a cartoon, steam would be billowing out of Draco's ears as his face turned bright red and his eyes bore holes into the boy next to him. Harry stifled a laugh and smiled at him apologetically.
"You're sorry?" Draco let out a sarcastic laugh. "Not everything is about you, Potter! This is only about me! You were just an easy target."
"For Merlin's sake!" Draco slammed his hands down on the bench. Harry glanced up from the potion to look around the room. The few heads that did turn in their direction quickly returned to their own potions. "Can you please talk to me?"
"Come on now you lot, let's get you settled in," McGonagall strode up the hall and the four got to their feet to follow the Headmistress. As they all left the hall no one looked to the back of the pack to see the scrawny boy following them at a distance.
"I guess that's this year's defence teacher," Hermione tried to get Ron to stop eating for a few seconds to see her.
He got up slowly, tearing open the top of the box and popping a toad in his mouth. He stepped up onto and over the sofa toward the portrait hole, chewing on the mint chocolate sweet.
"Now, I wouldn't want you to miss the feast tonight. Why don't you go back to the common room to put your things away and go down to dinner with your friends," she smiled. Harry got to his feet and picked his bag off the floor. He thanked her for her time as he left and wandered back to the Eighth year's wing to throw his stuff on his bed and meet up with Ron and Hermione.
Harry had still not spoken to George after nearly a week after returning to the Burrow. He had avoided both the Weasley twins, the living and the ghost, for so long that the idea of talking to George made him feel sick to the stomach. It was the same feeling he got when he had to speak to Dennis during Quidditch practice or a game. Perhaps he had been forced to get used to speaking with Dennis, he didn't freeze up or feel the need to vomit anymore but every encounter left him with a shaky and hollow feeling. But Harry was too stubborn to see the logic in forcing himself to speak to George, so he didn't.
"I think we should go back inside, it's getting late," said Harry, barely above a whisper. Draco pulled away from him harshly and nodded. Harry retracted his arm and got to his feet, watching Malfoy nervously as he followed suit. They walked back to the house in silence but Harry was thinking of only one thing; the image of Draco Malfoy's face so close to his own
"What is happening between you two?" Ginny asked as she sat down on a desk, her feet swinging just above the wooden floor.
"You and him, did something together? For me?" Harry brought his legs up onto the bed and down the other side to sit beside Draco.
In the distance, he could see a thin stream of smoke billowing out of the chimney of the small hut belonging to the Groundskeeper Hagrid, he must remind himself to go and visit him soon. The surface of the Black Lake was still, reflecting the sky and the clouds above perfectly. The Whomping Willow stood proudly, nothing giving away the fact that it was sentient. Harry decided at that moment that maybe coming back to Hogwarts wasn't such a bad idea after all.
He sat next to Hermione at breakfast who had Ron on her other side. She looked between them silently and groaned. Harry knew she was annoyed at him, but more annoyed at the fact that he and Ron were fighting. He elected to ignore her however, grabbing some toast and a goblet of Orange Juice.
"So now you've both lost it," Ron threw his arms in the air. "Am I the only one who's seeing sense?"
Harry shot off to the centre of the pitch and did a loop, just to show off. He wasn't sure why, it just felt good to out-do Malfoy.
What was it about the Slytherin boy that captivated Harry so? Was it their shared history entangled with the Dark Lord? Or perhaps something more? Draco's neatly combed fringe fell forward, almost touching his eyebrow and Harry couldn't help himself but study every detail of his face. Harry wondered to himself how he had never heard of any girlfriends of Malfoy's. He was, of course, handsome, Harry wasn't insecure enough to admit that. He cast his mind back to a conversation he had with Ron a few days ago. He had never considered the possibility that Draco could be gay. Surely he wasn't, someone of his proud heritage couldn't, could he?
Harry reached for the bowl of scrambled eggs and scooped some out onto his plate with his toast. He decided that it would probably be wise to eat something that morning despite the protest of his body.
The few that did notice the blonde haired intruder scowled but Harry paid them no mind, walking close to Malfoy as to indicate to everyone that any shenanigans will not be tolerated.
"Oh, well. I guess I can hold on to it for just a little bit longer," Harry smiled, turning and tucking the wand in his suitcase. Just as he stood up to return to Draco, he was leaving the room. "Where are you going?"
"No, I just never thought..." Harry trailed off. He wiggles his fingers a little in Malfoy's hold. "Do you moisturise?"
All while this was going on, a young wizard was constantly taking photos of every handshake and smile which began to hurt Harry's eyes after a while but he managed to resist the urge to rub them.
Pretend retching noises could be heard from the door. Both boys looked up with flushed faces to the source of the noise.
Harry knew the answer but was too stubborn to admit it. Making eye contact with Draco only made him feel worse as his smug expression only reminded Harry that he was, in fact, right.
"If you say another word about it, I'm going to break your ribs," Draco snarled. Harry only laughed, grabbing his broom and walking over to Draco.
He had a moment of self-realisation. Why was he doing this? As much as he wanted to, he wasn't sure if he could trust Malfoy, the kid was still unpredictable and highly sensitive. He knew Ron and Hermione would be furious when they found out that his bathroom break was just a rouse to slack off, slacking off with Malfoy would just make things even worse.
Harry's senses were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of two hundred screaming teenagers. He laughed as the room finally came to a sort of settle, as settled as you could get any number of Gryffindors.
"What is going on?" Harry was deeply confused. Everyone was forcing him to eat but yet he wasn't allowed to.
"Let me finish, Potter," Draco elbowed his boyfriend in the side. "The Ministry are letting her come to my graduation."
Instead of going to the Great Hall for lunch, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco all paid a visit to the house elves who were all too happy to see them. They ate scones and drank tea before saying their goodbyes and retiring the common room.
